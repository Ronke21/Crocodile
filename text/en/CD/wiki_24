<text>Marcel Joseph Aimé Lambert (August 21, 1919 – September 24, 2000) was a Canadian politician and Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada from 1962 to 1963.

==Life and career==
Lambert was born in St. Albert, to a French Canadian father and a Belgian mother. He served in the 14th Armoured Regiment (Calgary Regiment) during the Second World War and participated in (and survived) the Dieppe Raid. He achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

After returning to Alberta, he was named a Rhodes Scholar in 1946 and in 1947 he entered Hertford College, Oxford (University of Oxford) to study law.

Lambert was a candidate for the Alberta Progressive Conservatives in the 1952 provincial election, but failed to win a seat in the provincial legislature.

He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) from the riding of Edmonton West in the 1957 election. He was returned in the nine following elections, and remained an MP until his retirement prior to the 1984 election.

Lambert served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence from 1957 to 1958, and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue until 1962.

Following the defeat of Speaker Roland Michener in the 1962 election, Lambert was nominated to the position of speaker of the House of Commons by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker.

Lambert presided over the House of Commons during a tenuous minority government situation. As speaker, Lambert strove to be very correct in his interpretation of standing orders, ruling opposition questions out of order during Question Period if they were not strict inquiries and strayed at all into argumentation. This displeased the Opposition and led to his rulings being appealed unsuccessfully.

Lambert refused to allow an emergency debate on the issue of Bomarc missiles that the opposition demanded when an American State Department press release was issued contradicting arguments made by the Diefenbaker government against accepting the missiles. Lambert asserted that the matter was not of sufficient urgency to warrant a special debate. Liberal leader Lester Pearson challenged Lambert&#x27;s decision, and the House overturned Lambert&#x27;s decision by a vote of 122 to 104.

This incident indicated that the government had lost control of the House. Soon after, the government was defeated on a motion of no confidence on the Bomarc issue. Diefenbaker called an election, and appointed Lambert to Cabinet as minister of Veterans Affairs. While Lambert was re-elected in Edmonton, the Progressive Conservative government lost the election, and Lambert&#x27;s two-month career as a cabinet minister came to an end.

With the Conservatives in Opposition, Lambert sided with Diefenbaker&#x27;s critics, and refused to sign a petition declaring loyalty to the Conservative leader in 1966 when Dalton Camp attempted to force a leadership review.

In Opposition, Lambert was a leading critic in the areas of National Defence and Finance. During the short-lived government of Joe Clark, he was chairman of the Miscellaneous Estimates Committee, and led it through a flurry of activity.

After being defeated in a bitter nomination race by his eventual successor, Murray Dorin, Lambert retired from the House of Commons at the 1984 election. He was appointed to the Canadian Transportation Commission by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney following the election.

<doc id="880336" wikidata="Q2447786" url="?curid=880336" title="Bobby's World">
<text>Bobby&#x27;s World (originally known as The World According to Bobby) is an American animated comedy children&#x27;s television series that aired on Fox Kids from September 8, 1990, to February 23, 1998. The show was created by Canadian actor/comedian Howie Mandel, who also performs the voices of both Bobby and his father Howard Generic.

It was produced by Film Roman in association with Mandel&#x27;s company Alevy Productions, Fox Children&#x27;s Productions and distributed by Splash Entertainment. The theme song for &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot; was composed by John Tesh and Michael Hanna.

==Premise==
The series follows the daily life of Bobby Generic ( ), with his very overactive imagination and how he sees the world.

==Episodes==

==Characters==

===Main===

* Robert Adelvice &quot;Bobby&quot; Generic (voiced by Howie Mandel) – The main character of the series. He is a four-year-old boy (five in seasons 2 through 6, then six in season 7) who loves to fantasize. An imaginative Bobby claims however that he came from his dreams. Scenes with Bobby most often involve elaborate literal interpretations of the popular or colloquial sayings uttered by other characters during the show (i.e. a &quot;traffic jam&quot; becomes Traffic Jam, as Bobby imagines spreading tiny cars and trucks on a piece of bread and taking a bite). When he enters contests, he tends to end up losing because Bobby ends up being himself instead of using his common sense. Bobby has spiky black hair. He wears a white shirt with red short sleeves (which also reveals his stomach exposed), red shorts and blue sneakers.

===Family members===
The Generic family&#x27;s surname is pronounced &quot;JEN-uh-rik&quot;, but mispronounced as &quot;juh-NEHR-ik&quot; by other characters as a running gag.

* Howard Generic (modeled upon and also voiced by Howie Mandel using his normal voice) – Bobby&#x27;s father. Using his strict temper, he usually punishes his son Bobby by sending him to his room for his misbehaving.
* Martha Sven-Generic (voiced by Gail Matthius) – Bobby&#x27;s mother, who has red hair and is often seen wearing a sky-blue tracksuit. She has a prominent Midwestern accent, and often peppered her speech with phrases like &quot;Fer corn sakes&quot;, &quot;Fer cryin&#x27; in the mud&quot;, &quot;gee golly&quot;, &quot;gosh darn&quot; and &quot;dont&#x27;cha know&quot;. Gail Matthius based Martha on her &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; character, Roweena, a chain-smoking hairdresser.
* Kelly Generic (voiced by Charity James) – Bobby&#x27;s 15-year-old tomboyish rebellious sister, the eldest Generic sibling, sporting a blonde shag haircut, purple eyeshadow, pink-striped tights, and a valley girl accent and manner, and often uses her catchphrase &quot;Get real!&quot; 
* Derek Generic (voiced by Benny Grant from Seasons 1-2, Kevin Michaels from Seasons 3-6, then Pamela Adlon from Season 7) – Bobby&#x27;s 10-year-old brother, who is a bully with a rat-tail hairdo, slashed blue jeans, and a sarcastic manner. He always teases and insults his younger brother and tends to call him a &quot;dork&quot; or a &quot;dweeb&quot;. Bobby has a bad habit of listening to him and Derek is often reprimanded by his parents for fooling his kid brother.
* Jake and Alex Generic – Bobby&#x27;s younger twin brothers, who were introduced in Season 3 but mentioned in Season 2 as Martha was pregnant with them.
* Ruth Sven (voiced by Edie McClurg) – Bobby&#x27;s aunt and Martha&#x27;s sister, She is a blonde, amply-contoured lady with a sweet, pretty face and her hair tied in a bun, and kindly ways. She is loving and affectionate toward her younger nephew and particularly likes to pinch his cheeks, which Bobby really doesn&#x27;t go for. Like her brother Ted, she is unpartnered but unlike him, makes no attempt to seek a sweetheart. Part of her signature attire is knee-high stockings rolled into a ring at the cuffs.
* Ted Sven (voiced by Tino Insana) – Bobby&#x27;s uncle and Martha and Ruth&#x27;s brother. He is a blond, portly, jolly gentleman with a deep rough voice and his signature garment is a yellow shirt printed with red hearts. Uncle Ted is a fun-loving fellow who loves to joke around with Bobby and is a collector of various things, one of which is a novelty item called Socks in a Can. His last name is revealed to be Sven. He is unpartnered and his attempts to find a sweetheart end in disaster. He is also affectionate toward his youngest nephew and often calls him by the nickname &quot;Bobbo.&quot; Bobby likes hanging out with Uncle Ted because he thinks of all kinds of fun stuff to do including giving Bobby noogies.
* Roger (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker) – The Generics&#x27; pet dog.
* Webbly – Bobby&#x27;s stuffed toy spider.

===Recurring===
* Howie Mandel (portrayed by himself) – The show&#x27;s creator in live-action who interacts with Bobby in the hybrid opening and ending scenes. In first-season episodes, the live-action Howie &quot;is&quot; Howard Generic and has the ability to change into his animated alter ego. Beginning with season two, and continuing until the end of the series, Howie and Howard Generic are two separate individuals.
* George (voiced by Pauly Shore) – The boyfriend of Kelly.
* Tiffany (voiced by Candi Milo) – One of Kelly&#x27;s friends. She wears a hat.
* Amber (voiced by Candi Milo) – One of Kelly&#x27;s friends.
* Andrea (voiced by Candi Milo) – Another one of Kelly&#x27;s friends.
* Jackie (voiced by Debi Derryberry) – Bobby&#x27;s best friend with the floor-length pigtails who has a crush on Bobby. She always kisses him (which he hates, having to constantly wipe her kisses off). Jackie speaks with a monotone voice.
* Charlotte – Rambunctious and sassy, Charlotte was the fun-loving adventurous girl who was famous for her dislike of chocolate, and her tendency to tease Bobby incessantly over minor things he does.
* Mrs. Orso (voiced by Susan Tolsky) – Bobby and Jackie&#x27;s teacher at Little Red Preschool.
* Meeker (voiced by Pat Fraley) and Snurd (voiced by Jeff Doucette from 1990 to 1991, then Rob Paulsen from 1991 to 1998) – A bumbling duo seen doing various jobs around town, whether it be mall cops, paramedics, or stage hands.
* Captain Squash (voiced by Gary Owens) – Captain Squash is Bobby&#x27;s favorite superhero. He often appears to help Bobby in his imaginations.

==Production==
===Development===
Howie Mandel explained that he accidentally created the voice that would be later used to voice Bobby when he was choking on a piece of cake. Two of Mandel&#x27;s friends Jim Fisher and Jim Staahl signed an agreement with the Fox Broadcasting Company&#x27;s then newly created children&#x27;s division in 1989. Fisher and Staahl asked Mandel to join them in creating a show based on Mandel&#x27;s Bobby character and voice. Mandel explained that he believed Fox did not think his stand-up routines were &quot;family entertainment&quot;. He, Fisher, and Staahl (co-producers) recalled stories from their childhoods as they discussed the formation of the show. Mandel said &quot;that was the seed of &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot;&quot;. Later stories from the childhoods of writers Dianne and Peter Tilden along with Mitch Schauer were used as the basis of many of the stories. The other characters on the show were mixes of characteristics of the creators&#x27; parents&#x27; friends and relatives. Specifically, Uncle Ted was based on Fisher and Staahl&#x27;s former comedy partner in a comedy trio formed by the three after leaving Chicago&#x27;s Second City, called The Graduates. Ultimately, that partner Tino Insana read for and won the part of Uncle Ted.

Mitch Schauer drew the designs for the main characters. Bobby&#x27;s character design was based on Schauer&#x27;s then-4-year-old son.

On February 12, 2007, the character Bobby made a surprise appearance on an episode of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;.

===Show format===
Episodes often consist of a short live-action segment either before or after the main story (and sometimes both before and after). The segment would include Mandel describing some aspect of the story and often relating it back to his personal childhood. Sometimes during these segments, the character of Bobby would appear in animated form and converse with Mandel. Other times, a live action child would appear and exchange words with Mandel. Endings of the show also featured Mandel breaking the &quot;fourth wall&quot; by talking to viewers about the preceding episode. In some part of the episode, Bobby will break the fourth wall by telling the audience his perspective on life.

===Music===
The series&#x27; music was by Mark Koval. The theme music was by John Tesh and Michael Hanna.

===Possible revival===
In an April 2006 online interview, Mandel expressed his desire for a possible reboot of the series.

In November 2014, it was announced that Mandel told a crowd at Comikaze that plans to revive the series were in motion.

In May 2018, Mandel again made reference to his efforts to get the series revived in an interview with Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s Dave Quinn.

==Broadcast==
During its original run, &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot; was seen on Fox Kids. After it was cancelled in 1998, reruns began airing on Fox Family until 2001.
The series was available in its entirety on Netflix instant streaming and Kabillion as well. It was available on Amazon Prime Instant Video. Episodes can occasionally be seen in syndication, on a variety of websites, on Netflix or on Comcast&#x27;s OnDemand service.

In the United States, starting in 1996, the show was open-captioned; this was intended as an aid to help younger children learn to read.

In Brazil, it was aired on SBT, being known as one of the most well known cartoons in the 90s.

In Canada, it aired on YTV and later, Teletoon Retro.

In Russia, it aired on REN-TV, TV-3 and Jetix Play.

In Kazakhstan, is aired on Raisovka Television.

==Home media==

* Volume 2 – Bobby&#x27;s Big Move / Bobby&#x27;s Big Broadcast
* Volume 3 – Swim By Me / Jets, Choo Choos &amp; Cars

In 2004, Anchor Bay Entertainment released two best-of compilations, &quot;Classic Scratch &#x27;n&#x27; Sniff Episodes&quot; and &quot;The Signature Episodes&quot;, on DVD in Region 1.

On December 15, 2011, it was announced that MoonScoop Group had acquired the distribution rights to the series and planned to release all seven seasons of &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot; on DVD in early 2012 All seasons were made available for purchase on March 13, 2012.

==Video game==
A video game adaptation of &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot; was made for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1995. It was developed by Riedel Software Productions and published by Hi Tech Entertainment. A version for the Sega Genesis was in development, but never released.

In the game, Bobby&#x27;s mother tells him to clean his room. As he is cleaning his room, Bobby starts daydreaming about a toy. After beating a level, Bobby has another daydream about another toy that he puts away.

Bobby&#x27;s World is a platform game. In some stages, the gameplay changes to something similar to a shoot &#x27;em up. The player is asked to control Bobby and make him jump, squat, walk, run, and throw objects at the enemies – the objects often change according to the level&#x27;s thematic – and use Webbly to defend Bobby. On some stages, Webbly can be used to do other things too, like reach higher platforms, throw it at their enemies or even using it as a mount.

A Game Boy game based on the series was also planned, developed by Unexpected Development and published by Hi Tech Entertainment. The game was originally based on &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;, taking place in Kevin McCallister&#x27;s dreams, before being retooled into a &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot; game during development, retaining the same premise but replacing the characters with those of &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot;. However, the game was never released.

<text>USS &quot;Prudent&quot; (PG–96), originally ordered as HMS &quot;Privet&quot;, was an patrol gunboat in the United States Navy.

&quot;Prudent&quot; was laid down by the Morton Engine and Dry Dock Company, Ltd., in Montreal, Quebec, on 14 August 1942; launched on 4 December 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Vincent Godfrey; delivered to the U.S. Navy on 14 August 1943; and commissioned on 16 August 1943.

==Service history==
Following shakedown off Bermuda, &quot;Prudent&quot; steamed to New York to begin a series of east coast-Cuba escort runs. Sailing with her first convoy on 7 December 1943, she completed her 11th run, at New York, on 21 December 1944. During January and into February 1945, she patrolled the sea lanes off the New England coast, then on 20 February, departed New York on her last escort assignment to Guantanamo Bay. Returning to New York on 15 March, she resumed patrol duties, and for the remainder of World War II in Europe plied the waters off the northeast coast.

Ordered inactivated at the end of the war, &quot;Prudent&quot; sailed south on 11 June, to Norfolk, Virginia, thence to Charleston, South Carolina, where she was decommissioned on 11 October 1945. Struck from the Navy List on 1 November 1945, she was transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal on 22 September 1947.

In 1949 the ship was acquired by the Italian Navy and renamed Elbano. In 1951 she was converted to a hydrographic survey vessel and renamed a fourth time, Staffetta. She continued to serve the Italian Navy under that name until she was discarded in 1970.

<text>John Ray Dunning (September 24, 1907 – August 25, 1975) was an American physicist who played key roles in the Manhattan Project that developed the first atomic bombs. He specialized in neutron physics, and did pioneering work in gaseous diffusion for isotope separation. He was dean of the school of engineering and applied science at Columbia University from 1950 to 1969.

==Early life==
John Ray Dunning was born in Shelby, Nebraska, on September 24, 1907, the son of Albert Chester Dunning, a grain dealer, and his wife Josephine Dunning née Thelen. He graduated from Shelby High School in 1925, and entered Nebraska Wesleyan University where he became a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, and received a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in 1929.

After graduation, Dunning commenced a doctoral program at Columbia University. In 1932, James Chadwick discovered the neutron, which influenced Dunning&#x27;s career, as he thereafter devoted much of his professional interest to the characteristics and uses of this particle. Dunning&#x27;s research was enthusiastically supported at Columbia by George B. Pegram. In 1933, Dunning was an instructor at Columbia University from 1929 to 1932, and a university fellow from 1932 to 1933. He received his Ph.D. in 1934, writing his thesis on &quot;The Emission and Scattering of Neutrons&quot; under Pegram&#x27;s supervision.

Dunning married Esther Laura Blevins in 1930. They had two children, John Ray Jr., who became a professor of physics and astronomy at Sonoma State University, and Ann Adele.

==Manhattan Project==
After gaining his doctorate at Columbia, Dunning continued teaching and research there, becoming an assistant professor in 1935, and an associate professor there in 1938. Dunning was a central figure at Columbia on neutron research, and went on to publish 24 papers on neutrons between 1934 and 1938. In 1936, Dunning received a Traveling Fellowship, which he used to meet and discuss his neutron physics research with many eminent European nuclear physicists including Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, and Ernest Rutherford.

Dunning closely followed the work of Ernest Lawrence on the cyclotron. Dunning wanted a more powerful neutron source and the cyclotron appeared as an attractive tool to achieve this end. Government funding was not available for such projects in those days, and university budgets were tight. Nonetheless, during 1935 and 1936 he was able construct a cyclotron using many salvaged parts to reduce costs and funding from industrial and private donations. It was announced in 2007 that Columbia University has decided to junk a 70-year-old atom smasher, which is the nation&#x27;s oldest artefact of the nuclear era. After being decommissioned in 1965, the machine sat in the basement of Pupin Hall, home of Columbia&#x27;s physics department. It was scrapped in 2008, although some components are in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.
In December 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann sent a manuscript to &quot;Naturwissenschaften&quot; reporting they had detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons. They communicated these results to Lise Meitner, who, with her nephew Otto Frisch, correctly interpreted these results as being the result of nuclear fission. Frisch then confirmed this experimentally on January 13, 1939. Even before it was published, Meitner’s and Frisch’s interpretation of the work of Hahn and Strassmann crossed the Atlantic Ocean with Niels Bohr, who was to lecture at Princeton University. Isidor Isaac Rabi and Willis Lamb, two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton, heard the news and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi said he told Fermi; Fermi gave credit to Lamb. It was soon clear to a number of scientists at Columbia that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium from neutron bombardment. On 25 January 1939, Dunning was a member of the Columbia team that conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States. in the Other members of the team were Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, Enrico Fermi, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack.

Bohr argued that it was the uranium-235 isotope that was responsible for fission. Dunning realised that if this was the case, then an atomic bomb would be possible. His thoughts turned to devising a process for uranium enrichment, and by 1940 he was investigating gaseous diffusion, which he felt appeared to be more effective than the electromagnetic method of Alfred Nier and offered the best route to enrichment on an industrial scale. The researchers at Columbia became the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. Dunning headed the laboratory division responsible for all aspects of the gaseous diffusion program, including engineering problems, pilot plants and research activities. Four papers co-written with James Rainwater, William W. Havens Jr., and Chien-Shiung Wu appeared in 1947 and 1948, but much remained classified. Due to the secrecy of this work, Dunning and three of his colleagues were awarded $300,000 each in lieu of patent royalties. For his part, Dunning was awarded the Medal for Merit by President Harry S. Truman. His citation read: 
==Later life==

In 1946, Dunning became Thayer Lindsley Professor of Applied Science at Columbia. In the immediate post-war years he was scientific director for construction of the Nevis Laboratories, a collaborative effort of Columbia University, the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and the Office of Naval Research. He became dean of the school of engineering and applied science in 1950. This ended his active research career, but he was active in fundraising for what became the Seeley Wintersmith Mudd Building and the Terrace Engineering Center extension. By the time he stepped down as dean in 1969, he had raised $50 million for the school.

During the 1950s, Dunning was often consulted on nuclear technology matters by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Rear Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, the head of the Navy&#x27;s nuclear powered ships project. Dunning was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1948, and the Phi Kappa Tau Hall of Fame. Over the years he served as chairman of the New York City Board of Education Advisory Committee on Science Manpower, the President&#x27;s Committee on Supersonic Transport and the Science Advisory Council to the Legislature of the State of New York. He was a member of the board of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the science advisory committee of the Department of Defense.

Fascinated by nuclear technology and eager to share his knowledge with the public, Dunning gave numerous public talks on the subject, and made frequent appearances on television and radio. He helped write a &quot;Blondie and Dagwood&quot; comic that explained nuclear energy in simple terms. In one experiment, he drank irradiated salt water, and used a geiger counter to demonstrate to his audience how his fingers became radioactive as sodium-24, with its half life of 15 hours, circulated through his bloodstream.

He died from a heart attack at his home in Key Biscayne, Florida, on August 25, 1975, and was buried at North Cemetery in Sherman, Connecticut, near where he had another home.

<text>Raith Rovers Football Club is a Scottish professional football club based in the town of Kirkcaldy, Fife. The club was founded in 1883 and currently competes in the Scottish Championship as a member of the Scottish Professional Football League.

The club has won four national trophies, the 1994 Scottish League Cup, and the 2013–14, 2019–20 and 2021–22 editions of the Scottish Challenge Cup, and were runners-up in the 1949 Scottish League Cup and 1913 Scottish Cup. They have won the second tier of Scottish football six times, been runners-up four times, and reached its highest ever league finish in 1922, third in Division One.

As a result of winning the League Cup in 1994, Raith Rovers qualified for European football for the first time, entering the UEFA Cup the following season. The club managed to reach the second round, only to be defeated 4–1 on aggregate by eventual champions Bayern Munich.

Raith&#x27;s home ground is Stark&#x27;s Park, an all-seater stadium in the south of Kirkcaldy. The club has been based at the ground since 1891.

==History==

===Beginnings and name===

The modern Raith Rovers were founded in 1883 in the Scottish town of Kirkcaldy, playing first at Sands Brae, now part of the Esplanade, then Robbie&#x27;s Park. Though there were other teams who incorporated the town name, such as Kirkcaldy Wanderers and Kirkcaldy United, Raith became the most successful of the local teams, winning five trophies in the 1890s. There had been a much earlier (and unrelated) Raith Rovers which merged with what is now Cowdenbeath in 1882.

Although it lends its name to many entities in the region, Raith is not itself a settlement. A Raith Rovers victory in the 1960s led to a BBC commentator&#x27;s blunder that the fans would be &quot;dancing in the streets of Raith tonight&quot;. Although commonly attributed to David Coleman, it was actually said by Sam Leitch. Raith (, &quot;fort&quot; or &quot;fortified residence&quot;) as an area once stretched from south of Loch Gelly as far as Kirkcaldy and the Battle of Raith was once theorised to have been fought here in 596 AD.
Raith House and Raith Tower sit on Cormie Hill to the west of Kirkcaldy and several parts of the town are built on land formerly of the Raith Estate, although the modern housing estate bearing the Raith name dates from long after the origins of the team.

A mixture of local success and ambition took the club into the senior leagues where they established themselves and thereby became the pre-eminent team in the town. The club became a senior team in 1889 around the same time they were forced to leave Robbie&#x27;s Park which was incorporated into a new public park called the Beveridge Park, named after Provost Michael Beveridge.
The team subsequently moved to their current home of Stark&#x27;s Park named after and run by councillor Robert Stark in 1891.
The club turned professional by 1892 and were the first football team in Fife to be elected to the Scottish League in season 1902–03.
The club were incorporated into a limited company: the Raith Rovers Football and Athletic Company, Ltd in 1907. After two consecutive successful seasons in 2nd Division, the club elected to join the 1st Division in 1909–10. Three years later, the club made their first (and only) appearance in the Scottish Cup Final, losing 2–0 to Falkirk.

===Setting records===
In 1921 an innovation in training, previously unknown to the Scottish game, was introduced by directors following a visit to England: the use of a ball in training. As noted in the Fife Free Press, &quot;Hitherto, ball practice has been an absentee from the training curriculum on the grounds that being away from the ball for a week imparted eagerness on the Saturday.&quot; This heralded an era of success.

The club had its highest ever league finish in the Scottish top division, when they came third to the Old Firm in 1921–22 under manager James Logan (a former Raith player who had fought in World War I having enlisted in McCrae&#x27;s Battalion, along with several teammates who died in the conflict). This was followed by the unusual incident where the players were shipwrecked in 1923. Along with a cargo of chilled meat bound for Buenos Aires, the team had been en route to play friendly matches on the Canary Islands when the SS &quot;Highland Loch&quot; ran aground off the coast of Galicia, near Vilagarcía. The players were able to safely disembark, being rescued by local fishermen. They continued on their way a few days later, winning all four of their games on the islands, including one against Third Lanark, returning from a tour of South America. In July 2023, the club marked the 100th anniversary of the shipwreck with its new away strip in the yellow and blue colours of UD Las Palmas, a team based in Gran Canaria, and including a map of the archipelago and the date of the shipwreck.

The team battled on during tough times between the 1920s and 1930s but things improved by the season of 1937–38, which saw Raith setting a British League Record with 142 goals in just 34 league matches while winning the 2nd Division championship. The record still stands today. The forward line of Glen (5 goals), Gilmour (35), Norrie Haywood (47), Whitelaw (26) and Joyner (21) scored 134 of the record 142 goals.

Around this time, a then record crowd of 25,500 filled Stark&#x27;s Park on a Wednesday afternoon for a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay against East Fife (The first game had attracted 19,000 to the old Bayview ground). East Fife won 3–2 and went on to become the only 2nd Division club to win the Scottish Cup until Hibs matched the feat in 2016.

Record appearance holder Willie McNaught first appeared for Raith during the war before signing on a contract basis when normal football resumed after the end of global hostilities. McNaught went on to make 657 senior football appearances (many as captain) for Rovers. Raith reached the League Cup final for the first time in 1948–49 but lost 2–0 to Rangers. In an echo of what would happen four decades later, the club also went on to win the 2nd Division title. In the period of the club&#x27;s greatest high level consistency, Rovers stayed in the top division until the season after McNaught&#x27;s 1962 departure. In 1951, Raith had their largest ever gate for a Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden Park watched by a crowd of 84,640. Raith lost 3–2 to Celtic.

===Promotions, relegations and &quot;Footballer of the Year&quot;===
A disastrous season came in 1962–63, when the club finished bottom of the First Division conceding 118 goals in 34 games.
After leaving Queen of the South, George Farm became Raith manager in 1964. Farm took Raith to promotion in 1966–67 before leaving for Fife rivals Dunfermline Athletic and was never able to repeat the formula when he returned in the season of 1971–72.
Raith managed to avoid relegation in 1967–68, thanks to striker Gordon Wallace, who became the first player outwith the Old Firm to be voted SFWA Footballer of the Year. He scored 27 goals in 34 matches. However the club did find themselves being relegated again at the end of the 1969–70 season. Nonetheless, the Rovers during this time managed to get through to the quarter-finals of the Scottish cup for the second year running between 1970–71 and 1971–72 – although the latter saw them beaten 3–1 by Kilmarnock with a crowd of 10,815.

In 1975–76, the league set-up changed from Divisions 1 &amp; 2 to a 3 tier system (Premier Division, Division 1 &amp; Division 2). In the inaugural year of this system, Raith were promoted to the 1st Division, but were promptly relegated the next season, before bouncing back up the season after. Raith then performed reasonably well in the 1st Division, hovering around the top four until the early 1980s.

A new manager, Frank Connor took charge in early 1986, bringing many new faces onto the team which resulted in promotion on goal difference after a 4–1 win against Stranraer (while Ayr United lost to Stirling Albion) on the last day of the season.

===The League Cup winning era===
Raith reverted to being a full-time side again for the season of 1991–92 which was soon followed by winning the First Division title in the season of 1992–93. This was to start the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history – which saw the team&#x27;s first foray into the Scottish Premier Division (now the Premiership).

On 27 November 1994, Raith, managed by Jimmy Nicholl, surprisingly beat Celtic 6–5 on penalties to win the Coca-Cola Cup, after a 2–2 draw. Future Raith manager, Gordon Dalziel, scored the equalising goal for Raith in the dying minutes of regulation time. The same season, Raith were again promoted to the Premier Division after winning the First Division title.

As a result of the Cup win, Raith qualified for Europe (UEFA Cup) for the first time in their history. After eliminating both the Faroese and Icelandic champions (Gøtu Ítróttarfelag and Íþróttabandalag Akraness respectively) in the first two rounds, the club finally succumbed to eventual UEFA Cup winners Bayern Munich. They were beaten 2–0 by the German side in the 1st leg, which was not played at their home ground but at Easter Road, home of Hibernian. In the 2nd leg, at the Olympiastadion they led 1–0 at half time against all odds, eventually losing 2–1. This was the first time a Scottish team had qualified for a major European competition while playing outside the top league. The same season, Raith finished sixth in the Premier League.

Winning the Coca-Cola Cup, selling Steve McAnespie and playing in the UEFA Cup generated the money needed to redevelop Stark&#x27;s Park as an all-seater ground with North and South Stands. It was completed in time for the 1995–96 season, and Bayern Munich were invited to play a friendly in the first match in the redeveloped ground, with Raith securing a narrow 1–0 win.

===End of the fairytale===
After the club were relegated from the Premier Division, they also struggled to succeed in the First Division. For the 2001–02 season they were relegated to the Second Division for the first time since 1987. The club returned to the First Division (with the lowest winning total, to date, for champions of 59 points), under the leadership of Antonio Calderón in 2002–03 season.

At the start of the 2004–05 season, Claude Anelka (brother of French striker Nicolas) offered £300,000 to any team who would offer him a manager&#x27;s job and was subsequently appointed the manager of Raith Rovers, with Antonio Calderón refusing the offer of a coaching role and leaving the club. Anelka signed a team of (mostly) continental players from the lower leagues in France. A disastrous season followed, despite Anelka resigning halfway through the season (replaced by Gordon Dalziel) and his signings either leaving, or having their contracts terminated, and Raith were relegated to the Second Division, after finishing bottom of the First Division with just 16 points in the season.

===Local takeover===
During 2005–06, the future of the club looked doubtful after the club, and its traditional home of Stark&#x27;s Park, were both placed under threat by previous owners Colin McGowan and Alex Short. The Glasgow based property developers had repeatedly threatened to sell Stark&#x27;s Park for housing in a bid to find a buyer for their 50% stake in the club and after months of legal and financial wrangling a deal was struck with their company, West City Development.

Former chairman Turnbull Hutton and director Mario Caira, who were part of West City retained their investment and were joined by major investor John Sim, a Thailand-based senior financial figure with liquidator KPMG.

The &quot;Reclaim the Rovers&quot; fans&#x27; campaign, which was launched in a bid to secure a local future for the club, also secured a place for a Supporters&#x27; Representative on the new-look board after raising £100,000 towards the final figure.

On 30 December 2005, Raith Rovers&#x27; future was secured after a £1.2 million community buy-out (The New Raith Rovers Limited consortium) (assisted by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown who later became Prime Minister, a fan and shareholder of the club). Previous chairman David Sinton also completed work on the takeover.

On 2 May 2009, Raith secured the Second Division title with a 1–0 win at the home of Scottish football, Hampden Park, with a travelling support of over 1500. They lifted the trophy in front of almost 5000 the following week following a 0–0 draw with Arbroath.

On 6 April 2014, Raith won the 2014 Scottish Challenge Cup Final 1–0 against Rangers after extra time.

In early 2022 the club signed David Goodwillie. Days later, after an outcry regarding the rape ruling against him, chairman John Sim announced Goodwillie will not play for Raith Rovers and the club would review his contract. Raith&#x27;s women&#x27;s teams had moved to sever ties with the club. Goodwillie was released from his contract in September, no details being given by the club.

==Colours and badge==
Raith&#x27;s kit consists of dark blue tops with light blue detailing, with white shorts and dark blue socks. Raith&#x27;s current badge has been used since 1998, replacing the previous lion and shield motif used in different colour combinations (including being framed in a shield shape from 1995 to 1998) since 1985.

==Stadium==
==Fife rivalries==

There are three other SPFL clubs in Fife: East Fife (based in Methil) around 8 miles to the east, with Kelty Hearts and Dunfermline Athletic 13 and 14 miles respectively to the west. Raith&#x27;s traditional derby is with East Fife though the biggest rivalry is against Dunfermline, with an encounter at East End Park in April 2011 attracting a crowd of over 11,000. Cowdenbeath dropped from the SPFL into the Lowland League in 2022 but historically were another regular derby rival in various divisions.

==Supporters and culture==
In addition to former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, fans include author Ian Rankin, Coldplay bassist Guy Berryman and writer Harry Ritchie. Author Val McDermid is a former director but in February 2022 cancelled her sponsorship and ended her lifelong support of the club in protest at the signing of David Goodwillie to the playing squad. Current St Johnstone manager and former Scotland and Hearts manager Craig Levein has supported the team since boyhood.

===Literature===
The team is often mentioned in Ian Rankin&#x27;s Inspector Rebus novels, Rankin stating that Rebus is a supporter. In Giles Foden&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last King of Scotland&quot; the protagonist, Nicholas Garrigan, is a Raith Rovers fan.

===Music===
The Raith Rovers anthem is &quot;Geordie Munro&quot;, with its prominent mention of Kirkcaldy.

=== Fan friendships and contacts ===
Supporter contact is maintained with fans of the German football club FC Ingolstadt 04, from the twin city of Ingolstadt.

Rovers managers since World War II:
==Women&#x27;s team==
Raith Rovers Ladies and Girls F.C. was the oldest affiliated women&#x27;s team in Scotland. In February 2022, the team resolved to cut ties with Raith Rovers due to the controversy over the signing of David Goodwillie, who was ruled to have raped a woman. The women&#x27;s team renamed themselves McDermid Ladies, after the writer Val McDermid.

<text>Queen of the South Football Club is a Scottish professional football club formed in 1919 in Dumfries. The club plays in Scottish League One, the third tier of Scottish football. They are traditionally nicknamed the &quot;Doonhamers&quot; but are more usually referred to as &quot;Queens&quot; or &quot;QOS&quot;. Their home ground is Palmerston Park.

The club won the Division B Championship in 1950–51, the Second Division Championship in 2001–02 and 2012–13, and the Scottish Challenge Cup in 2002–03 and 2012–13. Queens led Scotland&#x27;s top division until New Year in the 1953–54 season: their highest finish in Scotland&#x27;s top division was fourth in 1933–34. The club reached their first major cup final in 2008 when they reached the final of the Scottish Cup, where they were runners-up to Rangers. The club&#x27;s current manager is Peter Murphy.

==History==
==Stadium==

Palmerston Park is located on Terregles Street in Dumfries. The club has played there since 1919. South of Scotland League club Heston Rovers have shared Palmerston since 2013. The stadium has a capacity of of which 3,377 are seats.

==Supporters and culture==
Robbie Neilson, the former manager of Hearts, said about Queens from his loan period at the club in 2002: &quot;It&#x27;s a well-run club and a real family club with a good spirit about the place.&quot;

Marc Horne wrote in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; following Queens appearance in the 2008 Scottish Cup Final: &quot;In the Palmerston Park club&#x27;s songbook, it is clear there is no room for songs which feature religion, violent vendettas or centuries-old battles that took place in other lands.&quot;

In the 2008 UEFA Cup qualifying trip to Denmark Queen of the South fans were hailed as &quot;a great credit both to their club and to Scotland&quot; by Danish police. About 850 supporters of the Dumfries club travelled to Denmark to watch the UEFA Cup clash with FC Nordsjælland. Even though their team was eliminated, local police said their behaviour was impressive. Inspector Rune Hamann said: &quot;It was a pleasure hosting such a visit by Queen of the South whose supporters were extremely well behaved and a great credit both to their club and to Scotland. Copenhagen was particularly busy in the build up to and after the match with a carnival, party atmosphere being evident. I look forward to welcoming Queen of the South and their terrific supporters back in Denmark in the future.&quot;

Chief Inspector Mickey Collins from Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary said the fans were a &quot;pleasure to work along with&quot;. He added: &quot;Despite the huge numbers of supporters who travelled to Denmark there were no arrests, incidents or issues of any concern. Great praise should be passed on to those fortunate enough to be at the match&quot;.

A notable Queen of the South supporter is the DJ and producer Calvin Harris, who grew up in Dumfries. He considered writing a song to celebrate the team reaching the 2008 Scottish Cup Final, but the idea was scrapped due to the time constraints of recording his 2009 album &quot;Ready for the Weekend&quot;.

Bill Drummond, musician, producer, and former member of The KLF, is a supporter as well due to their proximity to his hometown of Newton Stewart.

===Mascot===

The club mascot is &#x27;Dougie Doonhamer&#x27;, a human-sized border collie dog. The character has been played for many years by local supermarket worker Brian Harkness.

On 25 August 2017, Dougie Doonhamer won the Ladbrokes SPFL mascot race at Hamilton Park, having been runner-up the previous year.

On 31 August 2018, Dougie Doonhamer won the Ladbrokes SPFL mascot race at Hamilton Park for the second consecutive year.

===Biblical references===
Queen of the South are often humorously cited as the only league club in the United Kingdom to be mentioned in the Bible. Luke 11:31 states &quot;The Queen of the South shall rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them...&quot; Queen of the South is similarly quoted under Matthew 12:42. In the biblical quote the &quot;Queen of the South&quot; is considered to be the Queen of Sheba. In 2005, the issue was investigated by &quot;The Guardian&quot; website in their series &quot;The Knowledge&quot;, which also found full references to Arsenal, Bury and Reading, as well as partial references to &quot;hearts&quot;, &quot;wolves&quot;, &quot;forest&quot;, &quot;hammer&quot;, &quot;spurs&quot; and &quot;man&#x27;s field&quot;.

<text>James John Maitland Flegg, OBE (23 April 1937 – 7 May 2024) was a British horticulturalist, broadcaster, ornithologist and writer on bird-related matters.

==Life and career==
Flegg was a zoology graduate of Imperial College London and spent much of his subsequent professional career working in horticulture at the East Malling Research Station.

Flegg also had a lifelong interest in ornithology, having joined the Rochester and District Natural History Society as a junior member. As an ornithologist, he became well-known, having become president of Kent Ornithological Society in 1977, and was Director of the British Trust for Ornithology. He was a national household name because of his role as a presenter on the &quot;Coastal Ways&quot; and &quot;Country Ways&quot; television programmes.

Flegg was a bird ringer and ringed over 30,000 birds. Among the books Flegg authored are the Photographic Field Guide: Birds of Australia, and a number of books designed to interest children in living things from an early age.

Flegg died at home on 7 May 2024, at the age of 87.

<text>The Polish Scouting and Guiding Association (, ZHP) is the coeducational Polish Scouting organization recognized by the World Organization of the Scout Movement and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. It was founded in 1918 and currently is the largest Scouting organization in Poland (142 692 members in 2023). The first ZHP was founded in 1916, the current one is the fourth organization with this name. It is a public benefit organization as defined by Polish law.

==History==

===Pre-war history===
The Polish Scout movement was started in 1910. Initially, the ideas of Scouting were implemented by Andrzej Małkowski and his wife Olga. The three main branches of Polish Scouting included the Strzelec paramilitary organization for boys, a sport and education society &quot;Sokół&quot; and the anti-alcoholic association &quot;Eleusis&quot;. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the Partitions of Poland came to an end that the ZHP would be officially founded by the merging of existing groups.

Soon after the merger in 1918, the ZHP members fought in all the conflicts Poland was engaged in around this time: Great Poland Uprising, Polish-Bolshevik War, Silesian Uprisings, and Polish-Ukrainian War, much like their predecessors during the Siege of Mafeking.

All of the units joined in 1918 and formed the ZHP, one of the founding members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. Although many units retained their own traditions, a common law, common symbols, and a common oath were introduced. The primary difference between most Scouting organizations and the Polish &quot;Harcerstwo&quot; was described by Andrzej Małkowski:
&quot;Harcerstwo is Scouting plus independence.&quot;

Before 1939 the ZHP was one of the largest social and educational associations in Poland with over 200,000 members. Among the &quot;sponsors&quot; of Polish &quot;Harcerstwo&quot; were all the presidents of Poland and several high-ranking officers of the Polish Land Forces, including general Józef Haller.

===Grey Ranks===

After the invasion of Poland of 1939, the ZHP, many of whom joined defense militias, were branded partisans and criminals by Nazi Germany, who had executed many scouts and guides, along with other possible resistance leaders (for example during the Katowice massacre). Nonetheless, the ZHP carried on as a clandestine organization. In 1940, the Soviet Union executed most of the Boy Scouts held at Ostashkov prison.

The wartime scouts evolved into the paramilitary &quot;Szare Szeregi&quot; (&quot;Grey Ranks&quot;), cooperating with the Polish underground state and the Armia Krajowa resistance. Older scouts carried out Deez sabotage, armed resistance, and assassinations. The Girl Guides formed auxiliary units working as nurses, liaisons, and munition carriers. At the same time, the youngest scouts were involved in so-called small sabotage under the auspice of the Wawer organization, which included dropping leaflets or painting the kotwica sign on the walls. During Operation Tempest, and especially during the Warsaw Uprising, the scouts participated in the fighting, and several &quot;Szare Szeregi&quot; units were some of the most effective in combat.

In December 1944 the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN) reformed the scouting movement under the name of the pre-WWII scouting organization, though with authorities loyal to the new government and an ethos in line with that of the Soviet Pioneer Movement, pressuring the organization to become a member thereof, eventually altogether disbanding in even in that form in 1949. The organization was integrated into the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party, with most of its members now part of a new Soviet-style, government-sponsored pioneer organization – the Scouts of the Working Youth of Poland (Scouting Organisation of the Association of Polish Youth – &quot;Organizacja Harcerska Związku Młodzieży Polskiej&quot; or ZMP-OH), which retained the original Polish scouting movement&#x27;s motto while adopting pioneer traditions of Eastern Bloc countries, save for the uniform and the pioneer salute used in the Soviet Union and other pioneer associations of the Eastern Bloc (the scouts retained the two-finger salute in honor of the young boys and girls who fought in the Second World War with both the Polish People&#x27;s Army and the Home Army). The only existing part of pre-war ZHP is the ZHP pgK, established to serve Polish scouts outside their homeland.

===Modern history===
In 1956, after Stalin&#x27;s and Bolesław Bierut&#x27;s death, the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party youth movement ZMP OH was transformed and renamed to ZHP. However the new ZHP did not consider itself as a continuation of the pre-war ZHP, but as a new organization (until 1980). After 1958 many pre-war instructors were removed from the new ZHP or marginalized (like Aleksander Kamiński) and the original oath, law, educational content and methods were changed (mention of God was removed from the oath, Lenin introduced as a hero, the Bolshevik Revolution was commemorated, the brigades became co-educational similar to Eastern Bloc Pioneer associations). The two-finger salute common to the Polish Scouts was retained, and a new uniform debuted.

Despite this, the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association became one of the very few official organizations that retained some independence from the communist party. Because of this, its growth was rapid, and in 1980 it had more than three million active members. The Polish Scouts were engaged in a variety of duties, varying from helping in the fields of the poorest regions to organizing the visits of Pope John Paul II. After the martial law was imposed in 1981 the ZHP was the only large social organization not to be banned. The &quot;VIII ZHP Convention&quot; even supported the martial law. However, many of its high-ranking officials were interned because of their involvement in the Solidarność movement, as well as several Scoutmasters. The ZHP would later be admitted in the 1980s as part of the Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth.

In 1989, after the period of peaceful transformation began, many groups of instructors formed separate Scouting organizations (like the ZHR, Stowarzyszenie Harcerstwa Katolickiego Zawisza or ZHP-1918). These moves were prompted by political disagreements with the character of ZHP; they felt that its communist takeover left a permanent mark upon the organisation, and that the only way to effectively reform the movement was to found a new organisation. ZHR&#x27;s founding will serve as an adequate example of this principle. After pope John Paul II&#x27;s first pilgrimage to Poland in August 1980, some &quot;non-conforming&quot; instructors inside the ZHP created the Andrzej Małkowski Circle of Scout Instructors (KIHAM), with the objective to restore original Scout ideals. These instructors presented reformative motions to the 7th Congress of ZHP at the beginning of 1981, but these were all rejected. When martial law was imposed in December 1981, a large number of organisations were outlawed, so ZHR was forced to conduct their activities – weekly meetings, yearly camps and so on – underground. The underground movement came to light in the fall of 1988. After they were unsuccessful in reforming the ZHP their way, the ZHR was founded.

In this reformative climate, ZHP did adopt some of Polish Scouting&#x27;s pre-war traditions: e.g. the original oath and Scouts Law were reintroduced, and of course the overt communist aspects, such as the glorification of Lenin, were removed. However, the organisation remains co-educational. In 1993 Lech Wałęsa became the honorary protector of the ZHP, just like all former Polish presidents. In 1996 the ZHP rejoined the World Organization of the Scout Movement. The Scout Association is also a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (since 1996), International Scout and Guide Fellowship, International Catholic Conference of Scouting, International Catholic Conference of Guiding. These memberships have allowed ZHP to claim the greatest legitimacy, successfully dominating the other organisations of Polish Scouting, such as ZHR and ZHP pgK, the organisation which brings together Polish Scouts in the international Emigree community, with members in Australia, Argentina, Belarus, Canada, France, Great Britain, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Sweden, the United States, Ukraine, among other countries with Polish residents in the diaspora and as such the organization is affiliated to the International Link of Orthodox Christian Scouts. ZHP PGK, also known as ZHP Świat, has adopted policies similar to those of the Boy Scouts of America, where agnostics and atheists are not allowed to be instructors.

==Structure and age groups==
===Age groups===
There are four age groups, although the age limits are not strictly adhered to:
* &quot;zuchy&quot; (Cub Scouts and Brownies) – 6–10 years
* &quot;harcerze&quot; and &quot;harcerki&quot; (Scouts and Guides) – 10–13 years
* &quot;harcerze starsi&quot; and &quot;harcerki starsze&quot; (Venture Scouts and Venture Guides) – 13–16 years
* &quot;wędrownicy&quot; and &quot;wędrowniczki&quot; (Rovers and Rangers) – 16–21 years

===Structure===
The basic unit of ZHP is a &quot;drużyna&quot; (troop), consisting of approximately 30 boys or girls. Each &quot;drużyna&quot; is formed by several units named &quot;zastęp&quot; (patrol) consisting of about seven people. A few troops (especially working at the same school or housing estate) can be connected in one &quot;szczep&quot; (group). Several groups or/and troops from a specified area (borough, village, town) form a &quot;hufiec&quot; (district) which in turn is a part of one of the regions called &quot;chorągiew&quot; (literally &quot;banner&quot;). For example, a particular Scout can be a member of
* zastęp starszoharcerski &quot;Pantery&quot; (patrol of senior Scouts &quot;The Panthers&quot;)
* 156 Warszawska Drużyna Harcerzy &quot;Dżungla&quot; (156th Warsaw Troop of Boy Scouts &quot;Jungle&quot;)
* Szczep 156 Warszawskich Drużyn Harcerskich i Zuchowych (Group of 156th Warsaw Troops of Boy Scouts and Girl Guides and Cub Scouts)
* Hufiec ZHP Warszawa-Mokotów (Warsaw-Mokotów District)
* Chorągiew Stołeczna ZHP (Warsaw (Capital) Region of ZHP)

<doc id="880376" wikidata="Q155984" url="?curid=880376" title="Saalfeld">
<text>Saalfeld () is a town in Germany, capital of the Saalfeld-Rudolstadt district of Thuringia. It is best known internationally as the ancestral seat of the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha branch of the Saxon House of Wettin.

==Geography==
The town is situated in the valley of the Saale River north of the Thuringian Highland, south of the German cultural centre Weimar. Saalfeld station is currently served by Intercity-Express trains running from Berlin to Munich.

Saalfeld has 28,000 inhabitants. Together with neighbouring Rudolstadt and Bad Blankenburg, Saalfeld forms a tri-city area with a population of about 70,000.

The local mountain is the Kulm, which is 481.9 metres above sea level.

==History==
Saalfeld is one of the historic towns of Thuringia, possibly founded by the 7th century around a Thuringii (Gothic) fortress today called Hoher Schwarm or &quot;Sorbenburg&quot; (Sorbs&#x27; Castle). The area was first mentioned in an 899 deed. Kitzerstein Castle standing on an eminence above the Saale River, was said to have been originally erected by the German King Henry the Fowler, although the present-day building was not built before the 16th century. In 1012 the last Ottonian emperor Henry II ceded the former Carolingian &quot;Kaiserpfalz&quot; to Count Palatine Ezzo of Lotharingia, whose daughter Richeza bequested it to the Archbishops of Cologne.

According to the local chronicler Lambert of Hersfeld, Archbishop Anno II of Cologne in 1071 established a Benedictine abbey here, which quickly became an ecclesiastical centre in eastern Thuringia but was destroyed during the German Peasants&#x27; War in 1526. A Franciscan monastery was established about 1250, which also was dissolved during the Protestant Reformation. The Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa had ordered the layout of an Imperial city, parts of its medieval walls and bastions are preserved up to today. Nevertheless, the citizens in 1208 had to receive town privileges from the hands of the Counts of Schwarzburg as their feudal lords.

===House of Wettin===
In 1389 the town finally was acquired by Landgrave Balthasar of Thuringia, a member of the House of Wettin. Saalfeld&#x27;s economy prospered from surrounding mines, transport on the Saale River as well as from fishing (expressed by the barbels in the town&#x27;s coat of arms). The Wettin rulers had the Gothic Saint John hall church erected at the site of a Romanesque predecessor building until 1514. The Gothic town hall was completed in 1537. The ruling dynasty reached its height of importance, when in 1423 all Wettin lands including the Thuringian estates were incorporated into the Electorate of Saxony (Upper Saxony).

However, already in 1485 Elector Ernest of Saxony agreed on the Leipzig partition with his younger brother Duke Albert III. Ernest retained the southern Thuringian estates with Saalfeld; his grandson John Frederick I lost the electoral dignity in the 1547 Capitulation of Wittenberg ending the Schmalkaldic War, along with all his possessions outside of Thuringia. Confirmed by Emperor Maximilian II at the 1570 Diet of Speyer, John Frederick&#x27;s Ernestine descendants only retained the duchies of Saxe-Weimar and (from 1572) Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach. Upon the death of Duke Frederick William I of Saxe-Weimar in 1602, Saalfeld passed to the newly established Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg, from 1673 Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.

===Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld===
After several blazes in the early 16th century, Saalfeld had been rebuilt in a lavish Renaissance style. In 1675 Duke Albert V of Saxe-Coburg upon his accession chose the town as his residence and from 1677 onwards had Saalfeld Castle erected on the site of the destroyed Benedictine abbey, which in 1680 fell to his younger brother John Ernest IV. After Albert&#x27;s death in 1699, John Ernest also claimed Saxe-Coburg and called himself a duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.

The Castle, which has been renovated and is today the town administrative building, was home to four generations of the Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld branch. Until 1825, Saalfeld remained one of two capitals of the duchy, together with Coburg, its Franconian sister town to the south. The 4th Duke Ernest Frederick (1724–1800) was the last to be born in Saalfeld; in 1764, he moved the capital from Saalfeld to Coburg, where in 1805 his son and heir Duke Francis (1750–1806) would buy Rosenau Castle as his residence.

Francis&#x27; children were linked to many of Europe&#x27;s royal families: His daughter Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1786–1861) by her marriage with Prince Edward became the mother of Queen Victoria. Her brother Duke Ernest III of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1784–1844) was the father of Queen Victoria&#x27;s husband, Prince Consort Albert. This line continues unbroken from Queen Victoria through to King Charles III today. At about the same period, their brother Duke Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1790–1865) became the ancestor of the royal House of Belgium in 1831, while their sister Princess Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1781–1860) married Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia. Other descendants of Duke Francis include Wilhelm II, German Emperor, Alexandra, Empress consort of Russia, Victoria, Queen consort of Spain, Ferdinand II, King consort of Portugal, Carlota, Empress consort of Mexico, Ferdinand I, King of Bulgaria, Sofía, Queen consort of Spain, Princess of Greece and Denmark, Maud, Queen consort of Norway, and Marie, Queen consort of Romania.

During the time of Duke Ernest III in 1826, the neighbouring ducal line of Saxe-Gotha and Altenburg became extinct. Ernest received the former Saxe-Gotha but in exchange had to give up Saalfeld in favour of his Ernestine cousin Duke Bernhard II of Saxe-Meiningen.

===Modern times===
On 10 October 1806 a united Prussian and Saxon contingent met with a corps of the French Grande Armée under Marshall Jean Lannes at the Battle of Saalfeld, whereby Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia was killed. The opening of the Leipzig-Probstzella railway further boosted the town&#x27;s development. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, Saalfeld became part of the newly established Free State of Thuringia. As a railway junction and garrison town of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; armed forces from 1936, it was strongly affected by strategic bombing during World War II.

Upon the post-World War II division of Germany, Saalfeld was an Inner-German border station on the Saal Railway—one of two routes that could be taken by trains between Leipzig/Halle and Nuremberg. As a border station its steam locomotive shed assumed extra importance as Saalfeld essentially became the southern terminus of GDR train services. Due to the continued use of steam locomotives in East Germany after the end of steam working in West Germany, the area became a mecca for railway enthusiasts for some years. However, despite being very close to the Inner German border to the south, it was only accessible by a very roundabout route.

In July 2018 the former municipalities of Saalfelder Höhe and Wittgendorf were merged into Saalfeld. The former municipalities Reichmannsdorf and Schmiedefeld were merged into Saalfeld in January 2019.

==Economy==
Traditionally, Saalfeld was known for its silver mines. Today, Saalfeld has a number of prosperous industries, including the manufacture of machinery, bricks, paint, malt, cigars, hosiery, chocolate and vinegar. Other industries are brewing, printing and iron-founding, and there are ochre and iron mines in the area.

Tourism and recreation-related activities make up a significant part of the local economy. Saalfeld is located in the mountainous forests of Thuringia, a province well known for its winter sports, supplying half of the gold medals for overall medal table winner Germany in the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics.

Saalfeld is a popular base for hikers taking on the mountainous 168 km Rennsteig ridge, one of Germany&#x27;s best known hiking trails.

<doc id="880378" wikidata="Q2020073" url="?curid=880378" title="Oliver Belmont">
<text>Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont (November 12, 1858 – June 10, 1908) was an American banker, socialite, and politician who served one term as a United States Representative from New York from 1901 to 1903.

Belmont was a member of the banking firm of August Belmont and Co., New York City. He became publisher of the &quot;Verdict&quot;, a weekly paper.

== Early life ==
Belmont was born on November 12, 1858, in New York City, New York. Oliver&#x27;s father was August Belmont, a Hessian Jew who came to the United States in 1837 as an agent for the Rothschilds, and accumulated enormous personal wealth. The oldest race in the Triple Crown, the Belmont Stakes, is named for August. His mother, Caroline Slidell, née Perry, was the daughter of Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry, who was renowned for commanding the naval expedition that opened Japan in 1853–54. His maternal great-uncle and namesake was Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, the victor of the Battle of Lake Erie in 1813.

Belmont attended St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire. He entered the United States Naval Academy at the age of 14 in 1874. He graduated one year late, near the bottom of his class, in June 1880. He was commissioned as a midshipman and served for one year, resigning as a Cadet-Midshipman in June 1881 while serving on the USS &quot;Trenton&quot;.

==Career==
Belmont was a member of the banking firm of August Belmont and Co., New York City. He became publisher of the &quot;Verdict&quot;, a weekly paper.

Belmont served as delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1900, and was elected as a Democrat from New York&#x27;s 13th District to the Fifty-seventh Congress serving from March 4, 1901, until March 3, 1903. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1902.

===Belcourt===
Oliver received a huge inheritance when his father died in 1890. Oliver was a bachelor at the time of his father&#x27;s death and decided to build a summer house in Newport. Richard Morris Hunt was the architect for Oliver&#x27;s Newport mansion, Belcourt. Belmont designed Belcourt as he pleased. Hunt was hesitant with the design of Belcourt, but he concentrated on his guiding principle that it was his client&#x27;s money he was spending. The first floor had stables and carriage areas incorporated into the main structure in order to accommodate Belmont&#x27;s prized horses. The monumental Gothic rooms with their huge stained-glass windows were emblazoned with the Belmont coat of arms.

===Memberships===
Belmont was an early member of The Lambs, elected in 1887. He was a charter member of the Rhode Island Society of the Sons of the Revolution in 1896. He was eligible for membership in the Society by right of his descent from Captain Christopher Raymond Perry who served as a privateer in the American Revolution.

==Personal life==
In 1882, without his parents&#x27; consent, Oliver proposed marriage to debutante Sara Swan Whiting, a popular and beautiful socialite. His parents, August and Caroline Belmont, objected to the engagement, thinking Oliver was not mature enough for marriage because of his gambling and playboy lifestyle. As a result, he was sent to Bremen, Germany, to learn the banking trade from the Rothschild family, where his father had been trained. Oliver became dissipated and developed a penchant for absinthe. When Mrs. Belmont realized his decline, she agreed to the marriage. Oliver Belmont married Sara Swan Whiting in Newport, Rhode Island, on December 27, 1882, at her family home, &quot;Swanhurst&quot;.

The newlyweds traveled to Paris for their honeymoon, where they were joined several weeks later by Sara&#x27;s mother and two older sisters. Oliver, having originally agreed to the visit, now objected. He took to frequenting gambling houses and brothels, drinking absinthe to escape the situation. His personality was affected by the absinthe and he had a violent and abusive argument with his new wife, leaving her terrified. Oliver abandoned her in Paris and was later seen in Bordeaux, traveling with a French dancer. Shamed and heartbroken, Sara and the Whiting family returned to America. In April, Sara realized she was pregnant with Oliver&#x27;s child, but the two divorced and he was prevented from seeing the child. Natica Caroline Belmont (1883–1908) was born on September 5, 1883. Oliver disowned her, claiming that she was not his daughter and not a Belmont heir. Sara remarried; Natica was adopted by her stepfather, former Assistant Secretary of State George Lockhart Rives and took his last name. Natica became a prominent New York socialite. In 1907, Natica married Williams Proudfoot Burden, brother of James Abercrombie Burden, Jr.

Belmont remarried on January 11, 1896, to Alva Vanderbilt, the ex-wife of his good friend William K. Vanderbilt. He had been a friend of the Vanderbilts since the late 1880s, having accompanied them on at least two long voyages aboard their yacht the &quot;Alva&quot;. According to scholars, it seemed obvious that he and Alva were attracted to one another upon their return from one such voyage in 1889. After his death, Alva took on the new cause of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

===Death===

Oliver Belmont died on June 10, 1908, at his Brookholt estate in East Meadow, New York, from appendicitis. He was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx. His mausoleum, designed by Richard Morris Hunt, is an exact replica of the Chapel of St. Hubert at Château d&#x27;Amboise in France and features a set of Renaissance-inspired painted glass windows designed by artist Helen Maitland Armstrong. His second wife, Alva Belmont, was buried alongside him after her death in 1933.

<text>Ross County Football Club is a professional football club based in Dingwall, Scotland. The club currently play in the Scottish Premiership, being promoted after winning the Scottish Championship in the 2018–19 season. 

Prior to the 1994–95 season Ross County played in the Highland Football League, a competition they won three times. They have also won the Scottish First Division, Scottish Championship, Second Division, Third Division (once each) and the Challenge Cup on three occasions. In 2010, they reached the Scottish Cup Final, and in 2016 they won the Scottish League Cup. Nicknamed &quot;The Staggies&quot;, County&#x27;s colours are dark blue, red and white.

==History==
The club was formed in 1929 in what was then Ross and Cromarty after the previous local club from the North of Scotland Junior League Dingwall Victoria United (the &#x27;Dingwall Vics&#x27;) successfully applied for Highland Football League membership. The club was subsequently renamed Ross County. Playing in the Highland League from 1929, they won the championship on three occasions, first in 1967, then in 1991 and 1992. They also gained a reputation for their good performances in the early rounds of the Scottish Cup, upsetting league teams on eight occasions. The most notable of these upsets came on 8 January 1994, when they won 4–0 at Forfar Athletic, and were elected to the Scottish Football League three days later.

At the beginning of season 1994–95 the Scottish Football League was restructured into four tiers, and, following a vote on 11 January 1994, County were allocated one of the two vacancies in the new 10-club Division Three. County gathered 57 votes. They were joined by a new club created as a result of a merger of two teams to form Inverness Caledonian Thistle, who amassed 68 votes.

In 1998–99, Ross County were crowned Champions of the Third Division and thereby won promotion to the Second Division, where they finished in third place. This resulted in promotion to the First Division thanks to a reorganisation of the League, with the Premier League being expanded from ten clubs to twelve. After seven seasons in the First Division Ross County were relegated back to the Second Division in 2006–07. They won the Second Division in 2007–08, and were promoted back to the First Division. Ross County finished their first season back in the First Division in 8th place.

Their manager for a very short spell until October 2005, was former Inverness and Hearts manager John Robertson. He left the club on 24 October 2005, due to differences of opinion on a number of fundamental issues with the chairman. Gardner Spiers, a former Aberdeen coach, was appointed caretaker manager, but he too left in April 2006 after being told he would not be considered for appointment on a permanent basis. Director of Football George Adams took temporary charge before former Motherwell player Scott Leitch was appointed on 18 April 2006. Ross County won their first ever nationwide trophy when they won the Scottish Challenge Cup in November 2006 on penalties with Jason Crooks scoring the deciding spot kick on his competitive debut. Leitch, after winning the Challenge Cup but suffering relegation, stood down at the end of the 2006–07 season, almost exactly one year after his appointment. Former Partick Thistle manager Dick Campbell was announced as his replacement in May 2007. However, after a good run of results to start their Division 2 campaign, Campbell and the Ross County board decided to part company on 2 October 2007. Derek Adams (son of George Adams) took over as caretaker, and was confirmed as permanent manager a month later after the side&#x27;s good form continued. County again reached the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup in 2008. They played Airdrie United at McDiarmid Park. Unlike two years previously, County lost in a penalty shootout where four penalties were missed. Ross County also reached the Challenge Cup final in April 2011 in which they beat Queen of the South 2–0.
In November 2010 Derek Adams left to become Colin Calderwood&#x27;s assistant at Hibernian. Former Celtic player Willie McStay was appointed as his replacement in November 2010. McStay&#x27;s tenure was short – lasting only 9 games. Jimmy Calderwood was then appointed until the end of the 2010–11 season. In May 2011, it was announced that Derek Adams was to return as manager.

On 23 March 2010, they defeated Scottish Premier League club Hibernian 2–1 in a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay at home at Victoria Park. In the semi-final, they played Celtic on Saturday 10 April 2010. In one of the biggest upsets in cup history, Ross County won 2–0 at Hampden Park and reached the final of the Scottish Cup for the first time in their history. More than 7,000 Ross County fans travelled to Glasgow to watch the game.

In the 2010 Scottish Cup Final on 15 May 2010, County lost 0–3 to Dundee United at Hampden Park. The match was watched by more than 17,000 Ross County fans.

Ross County secured promotion to the Scottish Premier League for the first time on 10 April 2012 when their nearest rival to the title Dundee failed to beat Queen of the South. During this push to promotion, Ross County embarked on a 40-game undefeated run in league football, which continued into the Scottish Premier League. The run was ended by St Johnstone on 22 September 2012. The Staggies parted company with George and Derek Adams on 28 August 2014 following a poor start to the 2014–15 campaign. Jim McIntyre was appointed manager on 9 September 2014, with Billy Dodds as his assistant.

On 13 March 2016, Ross County won their first ever major trophy when they beat Hibernian 2–1 in the final of the 2015–16 Scottish League Cup. The team&#x27;s fortunes declined after this success, and they were relegated at the end of the 2017–18 season.

The club secured an immediate return to the Scottish Premiership after a 4–0 win at home to Queen of the South on 26 April 2019 saw them lift the 2018–19 Scottish Championship.

== Kit history ==


==Rivalry==
Their main rivals are fellow Highlanders, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, with whom they contest the Highland derby. This, unlike many rivalries, is generally friendly as both sets of fans live and work together given their close geographic locations. Due to the geographical proximity of the clubs and despite the rivalry, Inverness CT have signed many former Ross County players over the years, including Billy Mckay, Barry Wilson, Stuart Golabek, Roy McBain, Graham Bayne, Richard Hastings, Steven Hislop, John Rankin, Andrew Barrowman, Lionel Djebi-Zadi and Don Cowie. Many former Inverness CT players have also &quot;crossed the bridge&quot; in the opposite direction, most notably Grant Munro, Michael Fraser, Ross Tokely and Coll Donaldson in recent years. Both Stuart Golabek and Andy Barrowman had two spells at County each, with the former also having two spells at ICT. A notable player is Iain Vigurs, who is one of (if not the first) few player(s) to cross the bridge more than twice, having spent two spells with both County and Caley Thistle.

==Nickname==
The club&#x27;s nickname is the &quot;Staggies&quot;, taken from their badge which is a Caberfeidh, or Stag&#x27;s Head. This in turn was taken from the regimental badge of the Seaforth Highlanders, the regiment in which many locals had fought and died during the Great War.

==Mascot==
Ross County&#x27;s mascot, due to their affiliation with the stag crest of the Seaforth Highlanders, is a stag named Rosco, a play on the club&#x27;s name.

<text>William Henry Playfair (15 July 1790 – 19 March 1857) was a prominent Scottish architect in the 19th century who designed the Eastern, or Third, New Town and many of Edinburgh&#x27;s neoclassical landmarks.

==Life==
Playfair was born on 15 July 1790 in Russell Square, London to Jessie Graham and James Playfair. His father was also an architect, and his uncles were the mathematician John Playfair and William Playfair, an economist and pioneer of statistical graphics. After his father&#x27;s death he was sent to Edinburgh to be educated by his uncle John Playfair. He went on to study at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1809. He was first articled to the architect William Stark and when Stark died in 1813, he went to London.

In the 1830s Playfair is listed as living at 17 Great Stuart Street on the prestigious Moray Estate in Edinburgh&#x27;s West End. This is not a building of his own design, but is by his rival James Gillespie Graham.

Playfair joined the Free Church following the Disruption of 1843, losing his right to burial in the parish churchyard.

Playfair took David Cousin under his wing and was responsible for the latter part of his training.

==Freemasonry==
Playfair was Initiated into Scottish Freemasonry in Lodge St David, No.36, (Edinburgh, Scotland) on 18 January 1815.

==Death==
Playfair died in Edinburgh on 19 March 1857, and is buried in the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Row&quot; on the western wall of Edinburgh&#x27;s Dean Cemetery, where he designed monuments for others, including Lord Jeffrey.

==Major works==
Two of his finest works are the neoclassical buildings of the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy which are in the centre of Edinburgh. The Playfair Project, completed in 2004, joined the two historic buildings with an underground link. Many of his architectural drawings are held by the University of Edinburgh Heritage Collections.

<text>Tsiame Kenneth Mopeli (20 September 1930 – 1 October 2014) was the former chief minister of the South African bantustan of QwaQwa.

Born in Namahadi, Mopeli earned a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) at the University of South Africa in 1954 and worked as a teacher and radio announcer for the South African Broadcasting Corporation before being nominated for membership of the QwaQwa Territorial Authority.

Mopeli founded and led the Dikwankwetla Party to victory at the 19 May 1975 QwaQwa elections and subsequently become the chief minister of QwaQwa. He spent much of his time as chief minister confronting the South African government over various issues, most significantly over demands for more territory to be annexed to QwaQwa, and could boast of South Africa acquiescing to his demands, with some adjoining land (albeit small) added to the bantustan.

During his time as chief minister, Mopeli oversaw the foundation of the University of Qwa Qwa, which in 2003 was incorporated as a campus of the University of the Free State; the soccer stadium Charles Mopeli Stadium and the Mofumahadi Manapo Mopeli Hospital were built and opened during his time in office.

Described as &quot;rotund, avuncular and unbending&quot; by one observer, Mopeli ruled QwaQwa until 26 April 1994 when the bantustan was reintegrated into South Africa.

Dr. Mopeli died at the age of 84 on 1 October 2014, at Mofumahadi Manapo Mopeli Hospital after a long struggle with cancer.

<text>Stirling Albion Football Club is a Scottish football club based in the city of Stirling. The club was founded in 1945 following the demise of King&#x27;s Park after World War II. The club currently competes in Scottish League Two as a member of the Scottish Professional Football League. Its highest league position came in 1958–59 with a 12th-placed position in the top flight. Its only major success is in the league where it has won the second tier of Scottish football on four occasions, the last coming in 1964–65. The club has more recently competed in the third or fourth tier following league re-construction in 1975 and 1994.

Stirling&#x27;s home ground is Forthbank Stadium, a 3,808 capacity stadium in the east of the city near the banks of the River Forth. Before the stadium was opened in 1993, the club was based at Annfield Stadium which had been the home of the club since it was founded in 1945.

==History==
===Origins===
Stirling Albion was founded in 1945 after the town&#x27;s previous football team King&#x27;s Park had failed to survive the Second World War. King&#x27;s Park&#x27;s ground (Forthbank) had been damaged during the war, having been hit by a German bomb on 20 July 1940. This was one of only two bombs to fall on the town during the Second World War.

The new club was the brainchild of local businessman Thomas Fergusson, a local coal magnate, and he purchased the Annfield estate to build a new stadium. Annfield was situated within a quarter of a mile from the town centre and would be the home of The Binos until 1992.

The name &#x27;Albion&#x27; supposedly came from the make of Fergusson&#x27;s coal trucks. This however is an urban myth. Albion Coal lorries were used as grandstands but the club was named at a meeting of fans long before a ball was kicked. (Reference, Stirling Journal Newspaper, 1945.) The name Albion was chosen because it was an old word for Great Britain and held meaning for the founder.

===The yo-yo years===
Between 1946 and 1968, the club gained a reputation as a club that was too good for the lower league but never quite good enough to establish themselves in the top flight, being relegated and promoted several times, hence the club&#x27;s nickname of The Yo-Yos. For a time it was a saying in Scotland that something or somebody was &quot;going up and down like Stirling Albion&quot;. In 1966 the club became the first British team to play in Japan.

===The 1970–1980s===
Under the vastly experienced Bob Shankly, Stirling made progress, achieving consecutive third place finishes in 1971–72 and 1972–73, narrowly missing out on promotion to the top tier.

On retiring to the boardroom, Shankly was succeeded for one season by Frank Beattie but then handpicked his long-term protege, former Albion player Alex Smith, who had been cutting his managerial teeth at Stenhousemuir. Smith&#x27;s first season in 1974–75 saw the club finish 8th, three points behind Alex Ferguson&#x27;s St Mirren in 6th. That slim margin would prove crucial as league reconstruction meant it was the difference between staying in the Second Division or starting afresh in the new third tier.

Over the next two seasons, Smith began a major rebuild of the playing staff that would create one of Albion&#x27;s finest squads. To a core of long-standing regulars including midfielder Robert Duffin, half-back James Clark and goalkeeper George Young, he added, among others, centre-half John Kennedy from Partick Thistle, Clyde full-back James Burns and Hibernian youngsters Allan Moffat and David Steedman. Midfielder Robin Thomson and teenage winger Graeme Armstrong also arrived from non-league football.

Albion opened the 1976–77 season with a League Cup campaign that saw them nearly topple Premier Division Aberdeen in the quarter-finals, losing the first leg 1–0 at Pittodrie but then winning the return by the same score at Annfield with a Robert Gray header. The Dons won the replay at the neutral ground of Dens Park, Dundee, 2–0, before beating both Rangers and Celtic on the way to lifting the trophy. Albion went on to win the Second Division crown that season, conceding only 29 goals in 39 matches and taking the title with several games to spare.

Back in the second tier, Albion finished a creditable 5th in 1977–78 and enjoyed comfortable mid-table finishes in the subsequent two seasons. However, despite consolidation on the pitch, Annfield&#x27;s infrastructure was in dire need of repair and the club&#x27;s cash supplies began to run low.

The 1980–81 season started memorably with a stunning 1–0 win over Celtic in the first leg of their second round League Cup tie thanks to a Lloyd Irvine goal. They took an early lead in the 2nd leg at Parkhead too with a Matt McPhee free kick, but minutes away from a famous victory, a late Tommy Burns strike took the tie to extra time. Albion were eventually overwhelmed and lost 6–2 on aggregate, a teenage Charlie Nicholas coming off the bench to grab his first two goals for the Hoops.

Following a third match against Celtic – a 3–0 defeat in the Scottish Cup in February – goals and confidence dried up and 13 games without finding the net led to relegation back to the 3rd tier. Through necessity, Albion began to cash in on the squad&#x27;s better players, and Smith was given the task of developing a conveyor belt of local talent to sell on and keep Albion afloat.

George Young had already signed for Rangers for £20,000 in 1979 but the exodus began to pick up pace. Defender George Nicol went to Dundee United in 1981 and John Kennedy to St Johnstone a year later.

Three of Smith&#x27;s local discoveries left in quick succession in 1983 and 1984: striker John Colquhoun to Celtic, midfielder Brian Grant to Aberdeen and Scotland youth defender John Philliben to Doncaster Rovers. Meanwhile, stalwart goalkeeper Gordon Arthur departed for Dumbarton. Despite the calibre of the players leaving, Albion maintained consistent top-half finishes and, in 1984, racked up a record 20–0 Scottish Cup victory over Selkirk, which made headlines around the world.

Following a bright start to the 1986–87 campaign, Smith was prised away to take charge of St Mirren, and his assistant George Peebles took over at Annfield. Albion finished third and missed out on promotion only on goal difference.

Three more local players were poached from the club between 1986 and 1987: Willie Irvine by Hibernian and Robert Dawson and Keith Walker by their old boss at St Mirren, bringing the total revenue raised from player sales linked to the Smith era to nearly £1 million.

However, off the field, the council had decided to make as much money as possible from Annfield, and the grass pitch was considered not to be cost effective. The main stand was also demolished after being declared an unsafe building. An extra large crowd turned up in September 1987, to see Stirling play Ayr United on the first-ever game on artificial turf in Scotland.

One consequence of the pitch change was that clubs could decide not to play on the surface in cup matches, and so for the next five years all of Stirling Albion&#x27;s home cup games were played away. With the supposed advantage of the artificial pitch not working, St Johnstone defeated the Binos by six goals on the artificial surface, Peebles was relieved of his duties and Jim Fleeting was appointed.

Fleeting was manager for six months but shook the club up and served as a launch pad for the next 10 years. When Fleeting left to manage Kilmarnock days after declaring his &quot;loyalty to Stirling Albion, a sincere loyalty I&#x27;m proud to say&quot;, Bino&#x27;s star striker John Brogan was promoted to manager and would finally lead the Binos out of Division Two in 1991. The club went unbeaten away from home for a whole calendar year, and easily saw off the challenge of Montrose to clinch the title at Links Park on 7 April 1991.

===The 1990s: between Divisions 1 and 2===
The next three years in Division 1 were eventful. The club stayed up, but Annfield was no more and a new ground was built outside Stirling town centre on the banks of the River Forth. After many years playing at Annfield in the centre of the town, the team now play at Forthbank Stadium which is owned by Stirling Council.

The club was relegated to Division 2 when the structure of Scottish Football was changed again to create a four division setup. Brogan was sacked and replaced by Kevin Drinkell. Drinkell had a terrible first season in charge: by February the club were third from bottom, and after a defeat at Brechin City the fans revolted against Drinkell. Sensing he was in the last chance saloon, he quickly brought in Paul Deas and Garry Paterson who shored up the team and took them on a 10-game unbeaten run. This run lifted the club into second on the last day of the season, when a point would have secured them an immediate return to Division 1. The Binos hosted Dumbarton at Forthbank but Dumbarton won, and the Binos were resigned to another season in the second division. However, in the 1995–96 season the club went on an amazing run and had the league sewn up by Christmas, and were regularly scoring six goals in their games.

During 1996 to 1998 the club returned to the First Division. The 1996–97 season saw a respectable mid-table finish. The 1997–98 season began with good early cup form, but the club were relegated after the introduction of foreign players failed to compensate for the loss of several key players. With one game remaining, Drinkell was replaced by his assistant, former West Ham United and Scotland star Ray Stewart.

Between 1998 and 2000 the club played in the 2nd Division under the management of John Philliben. Philliben was criticised as manager after the signings he made throughout his reign. He was sacked at the end of the 1999–00 season and replaced by Ray Stewart, who returned to manage the Binos for a second time.

===Recent years===
The 2000–01 season saw Stirling Albion go on a run of 17 games without a win, and finished at the bottom of the Second Division and were subsequently relegated to the Third Division. The following season was equally poor as The Binos finished second bottom of the Third Division, avoiding the bottom place by the narrowest of margins – a single missed penalty. Their Scottish Cup campaign was similarly weak, with the team being knocked out by East of Scotland League team Gala Fairydean. Ray Stewart was sacked at the end of the season.

Allan Moore was appointed manager at the beginning of the 2002–03 season, and the club saw immediate improvement in its fortunes. The Binos were promoted to the Second Division at the end of the 2003–04 season, and the following season saw a respectable fourth-place finish in the league. This improvement continued into season 2005–6. Major changes to the promotion/relegation issues had been put into place, with the advent of the play-off system, but Stirling just missed out in competing in the play-offs. The following seasons the Binos went on an 18-game unbeaten run. This successful run saw the club climb to 2nd place in the Second Division, where they would finish the season, guaranteeing them a play-off place for promotion to the Scottish First Division.

Stirling Albion went into the play-offs after a run of four defeats against Stranraer, Brechin City, Ayr United and Peterhead. The Binos played Raith Rovers in the playoffs semifinals. The first game was at Starks Park, where the game finished with a goal less draw. In the second game of the tie the Binos defeated Raith Rovers at Forthbank with Chris Aitken scoring two goals and Colin Cramb scoring a third, to secure a play-off final tie with Airdrie United. In the first game of the play-off final the Binos had to come from 2 goals behind at half time, to go into the second game all square at 2 each. On Saturday 12 May 2007 the Binos travelled to Airdrie to play the final game of the season and play for promotion to Scottish Division One. The game was played in front of a shared support of 3,465 people. Stirling Albion secured the win with Robert Snodgrass two goals and Stewart Devine scoring the third goal to gain the Binos promotion from the Scottish Second Division to the Scottish First Division.

It had taken the Binos nearly ten years to return to the Scottish First Division, after dropping down to ninth in the Scottish Third Division. Slowly over the past five seasons Binos boss Allan Moore took the side from the lowest ebb in the club&#x27;s recent history to gaining promotion to the Scottish First Division. However the team entered the First Division as the sole part-time team in that league and failed to sustain their position, finishing in the automatic relegation spot.

In May 2009 various groups of Stirling Albion supporters, concerned about the future ownership and viability of the club, came together in a campaign to buy the club, inspiring car stickers and postering campaign to that end.

Due to the forced relegation of Livingston, the second division for 2009–10 contained three teams from the previous years Third Division. In addition, newly relegated Clyde were forced to build a squad from scratch and were thus seen as nigh on relegation certainties. This meant the division appeared to be as weak as it had been for many a season. Stirling Albion therefore began the season as one of, if not the, favourites for the title.

A good start from Stirling saw them set the early pace and for a while they appeared to be on their way to pulling well clear of the pack. Unfortunately for the Binos a combination of poor home form and an inability to keep clean sheets saw them fall from the top of the table. The extended cold spell of weather through the early months of 2010 hit Stirling worse than any other team and soon they were as many as four games behind their promotion rivals. Defeat to Alloa in early April appeared to be a fatal blow. Soon Stirling were 15 points behind the league leading Wasps and the title looked gone.

However, when all looked lost things suddenly began to turn. Eight games compressed into the final 21 days of the season saw the team come together and the gap to Alloa was reduced. As the long time leaders began to lose games the Binos consistent run of form saw them regain top spot on the penultimate weekend of the campaign. Stirling then had two chances to win the title. A dramatic 3–3 draw at Cowdenbeath knocked the Fife side out of title contention and meant only a draw was required four days later at Brechin.

An early Michael Mullen goal had Stirling in control but a Charlie King leveller and a red card for on-loan defender Brian Allison saw Stirling hearts skip a beat. However, the 10 men of Stirling held firm and earned the draw which won them their first divisional title for nearly 15-years.

In the aftermath of promotion, Stirling manager Allan Moore finally got his much sought after move into full-time football as he took charge of Greenock Morton. His replacement was John O&#x27;Neill, who stepped up from being assistant manager. Club coach Roddy Grant was appointed the new assistant manager.

On 2 July it was announced that chairman Peter McKenzie had agreed to sell his majority shareholding to the Stirling Albion Supporters Trust. Thus the BuyStirlingAlbion campaign which was launched in May 2009 had finally reached a conclusion. Stirling Albion became the first Scottish League club to be 100% owned by a fans trust.

A poor start to season 2010–11 saw John O&#x27;Neill and assistant Roddy Grant under pressure. After six straight league defeats, including three by five or more goals, the management team were let go in the wake of 6–1 drubbing at Partick Thistle on 15 January. Former Dundee and Aberdeen manager Jocky Scott replaced John O&#x27;Neill in the Stirling hot seat. Jocky was assisted by ex-Hibernian manager John Blackley. Only months after their appointment, the Binos were relegated back to the Second Division on 9 April 2011, with four games to spare. Jocky was able to finally secure his first win as Stirling Albion manager on the final day of the season in a 3–2 victory over Greenock Morton.

In the summer of 2011, the club requested a £200 payment from potential players attending &#x27;So You Think You&#x27;re Good Enough?&#x27; trials with the club, hoping to gain a contract for the 2011–12 season. Twelve of those who attended were invited back to attend pre-season training to aid their attempts to gain a contract. Despite criticism from Players&#x27; union representatives, the club announced that a further trial would take place for another 17 players hoping to secure a squad place. Two players who took place in these trials, goalkeeper Sam Filler and defender John Crawley were awarded professional contracts in July 2011.

After seven consecutive defeats between October and December 2011 Jocky Scott and assistant John Blackley left the club by mutual consent. During their period in charge the club won only 5 of 38 competitive fixtures. Defender Greig McDonald was placed in temporary charge, and after ending a losing streak was appointed full-time manager, making him the youngest in the UK at the age of just 29. Despite the appointment, Stirling Albion were relegated to the Third Division on 29 April 2012 following a 2–1 defeat to Dumbarton.

On 6 October 2012, Stirling Albion defeated Rangers while bottom of the Scottish league thanks to a Brian Allison goal. Albion then maintained their unbeaten home record against Rangers that season by earning a well deserved point in a 1–1 draw on 26 February 2013. On 9 March the club recorded a 9–1 home win against East Stirlingshire, with Jordan White scoring four goals.

In May 2014, Stirling Albion were promoted after winning the League One playoff final, beating East Fife 3–2 on aggregate. However, this spell in the higher division lasted a single season, and the club were relegated after finishing bottom in 2015. The club have remained in League Two from 2015 onwards, achieving mostly mid-table positions.

In December 2021, Stirling Albion parted ways with Kevin Rutkiewicz who had managed the club since October 2018.

In December 2021, Stirling Albion appointed Darren Young as the new first team manager.

<text>Stranraer Football Club is a Scottish semi-professional football club based in the town of Stranraer in Dumfries and Galloway. The club was founded in 1870, making it the third-oldest football club in Scotland behind Queen&#x27;s Park and Kilmarnock and one of the 20 oldest in the world. The club currently competes in Scottish League Two as a member of the Scottish Professional Football League.

They have won the Scottish Second Division on two occasions, most recently in 1997–98, as well as coming runners-up in 2004–05 and 2014–15. Their only national cup final came in 1996, when the club defeated First Division champions St Johnstone 1–0 in the Scottish Challenge Cup final.

Stranraer&#x27;s home ground is Stair Park, which has the capacity to seat around 1,830 spectators and a total of including standing. The ground was opened in 1907 and is located in the east of Stranraer.

==History==
Stranraer were founded in 1870 and play their football at Stair Park. Most of Stranraer&#x27;s football was played under Southern Counties auspices until, in 1949, the club was admitted to C Division where they came up against the reserve sides of the established league clubs. However they had taken part in the Scottish Cup since their debut in the national tournament in 1877–78. In 1955 C Division was abolished and the Blues found themselves in B Division and playing first team league football. They would remain in the bottom tier until their first-ever promotion eventually arrived under the club&#x27;s legendary manager Alex McAnespie in 1993–94.

With the league reformation at the end of the 1993–94 season, champions Stranraer found themselves leapfrogging six relegated teams and playing in the new First Division in season 1994–95, finishing last, with only 17 points from 36 games. With Campbell Money at the helm Stranraer spent three seasons in the Second Division before winning promotion back to the First Division at the end of the 1997–98 season. Once again, they finished bottom of the league, with the same points total as before and 29 defeats. During that season a notable league win was secured at Easter Road against Hibernian. During Money&#x27;s reign the club lifted the Scottish League Challenge Cup, defeating St Johnstone 1–0 at Broadwood on 3 November 1996. Saints&#x27; Danny Griffin was the unfortunate scorer of an own goal.

The club, now under the management of Billy McLaren, then spent a further four years in the Second Division, with the most notable event being a strong Scottish Cup run in season 2002–03, which saw them go to the quarter finals, where they were beaten 4–0 by SPL side Motherwell. However, the team&#x27;s cup run did not reflect their league form, as they finished ninth in the Second Division, and thus were relegated to the Third Division for season 2003–04. The team&#x27;s fortunes improved from there as, under Neil Watt, they won the Third Division at the first attempt, gaining promotion back to the Second Division. In season 2004–05, the team stayed in the top two for most of the campaign. A 1–1 draw with closest promotion rivals Morton on 30 April 2005 saw them gain promotion to the First Division for the third time, although they were relegated to the Second Division the following season after finishing ninth and losing out in the play-offs to Partick Thistle.

The team had a largely unsuccessful campaign in 2006–07, with heavy defeats by relegation rivals Peterhead and Forfar Athletic. They finished ninth, which resulted in a play-off with Third Division promotion contenders East Fife. A 4–2 aggregate defeat (despite winning the second leg 1–0) saw them relegated to the Third Division.

On 21 January 2009, club chairman Nigel Redhead stated that Stranraer owed £250,000, and had a 50–50 chance of survival to the end of the season. In response, on 22 January 2009, a small consortium launched the Friends of Stranraer F.C. to try to secure the club&#x27;s future through donations from the football community at www.savestranraerfc.com. On 23 January 2009, as part of efforts to reduce costs to a manageable level, key player Gregory Tade transferred to Clyde. On 24 January 2009, Stirling Albion defeated Stranraer 8–2. Shortly after the game, Stranraer and team manager Derek Ferguson parted company by mutual consent and Keith Knox took over the reins. On 4 April 2009, after a 3–0 loss to Raith Rovers, Stranraer&#x27;s relegation to Division Three was confirmed, meaning the club had played in a different division for each of their last eight seasons.

On 23 July 2011, they lost 8–0 to Morton in a Ramsdens Challenge Cup game. A year later, they lost 8–0 at home again, this time in the Scottish League Cup against Livingston.

The 2012 financial problems of Scottish Premier League side, Rangers, and the subsequent decision by SPL clubs to expel Rangers from the SPL, led to Scottish Football League member clubs voting Rangers into the Third Division. This meant that an additional team from each tier of Scottish football was promoted for the 2012–13 season. As Stranraer were runners up in the previous season&#x27;s third division promotion play-offs, they were promoted to the Second Division. They secured their place in the third tier of Scottish football after a 2–1 win at Stenhousemuir on the final day of the season, but only after Stephen Aitken had taken over from Knox in October.

The club then settled well in the third tier under manager Stephen Aitken, finishing third behind full-time Rangers and Dunfermline Athletic in 2013–14 and second behind full-time Morton the following season. Stranraer&#x27;s Boxing Day draw at Ibrox in 2013 saw the club scoring their first goal against Rangers and taking their first point off the Glasgow club. In both of these seasons, however, they were knocked out of the promotion play-offs at the semi-final stage. During this spell the club also performed well in the cups – defeating Ross County in the League Cup, taking Inverness to a Scottish Cup replay, and only losing out on penalties to Livingston in the semi-final of the Petrofac Challenge Cup. Aitken impressed to the extent that he was recruited by Championship side Dumbarton in May 2015 and was quickly replaced by former Ayr United manager Brian Reid. Stranraer started the 2015–16 season horrendously and were bottom of the table at Christmas. A great run afterwards, however, saw them finish 4th and qualify for the promotion play-offs for a third successive season.

This was the seventh time Stranraer had taken part in a relegation/promotion play-off in only 11 years of the system&#x27;s implementation. They failed to achieve their target in the first six times, although in 2008 and 2012 they eventually achieved promotion as losing finalists because of another club&#x27;s misfortune. In the semi-finals they faced Livingston, who had finished 9th in the Scottish Championship. They were victorious 5–2 at Stair Park but two late goals for Livingston in the second leg made it 6–6 on aggregate (away goals not counting in the playoffs), forcing extra time. Stranraer scored twice to lose the match 4–3 and win 8–6 on aggregate. They faced Ayr United in the two-legged finals for a place in the second tier.

Stranraer drew 1–1 with Ayr in the first leg at Stair Park, with a late goal from Ayr&#x27;s Ross Docherty to deny Stranraer a first-leg advantage. The second leg finished 0–0 with the game being decided on penalties, Ayr winning 3–1 and being promoted ahead of Stranraer.

2016–17 also started dreadfully for Stranraer and, following a 1–0 January defeat at Stenhousemuir which saw the hosts leapfrog the Blues at the foot of the table, Reid departed to be replaced by Stephen Farrell as manager.

Stranraer had a poor 2023–24 season, finishing bottom of Scottish League Two and facing East Kilbride in a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off. A 2–2 draw away from home meant that Stranraer needed to win at Stair Park to avoid dropping into non-league football.
A 3–1 extra-time win sparked a pitch invasion from 1,800 Stranraer supporters, their largest support in almost a decade.

The club hold the record for a shirt sponsorship deal. Stena Line have been on the front of the shirts since the start of 1996–97 season (and Sealink from 1988 to 1989). As the Sealink brand was renamed Stena Line, as of the start of the 2023–24 season the club&#x27;s sponsor has remained the same for over 35 seasons, making it one of the longest-standing sponsorships in world football, and the current longest unbroken sponsorship record in UK football.

<text>An antenna analyzer or in British aerial analyser (also known as a noise bridge, RX bridge, SWR analyzer, or RF analyzer) is a device used for measuring the input impedance of antenna systems in radio electronics applications.

In radio communications systems, including amateur radio, an antenna analyzer is a common tool used for fine tuning antenna and feedline performance, as well as troubleshooting them.

Antenna bridges have long been used in the broadcast industry to tune antennas. A bridge is available which measures complex impedance while the transmitter is operating, practically a necessity when tuning multi-tower antenna systems. In more recent times the direct-reading network analyzers have become more common.

==Types of analysers==
There are several different instruments of varying complexity and accuracy for testing antennas and their feed lines. All can also be used to measure other electrical circuits and components (at least, in principle).
* The simplest is an SWR meter, which only indicates the degree of mismatch; the actual mismatched impedance must be inferred by measuring several nearby frequencies and performing a few simple calculations. The SWR meter requires a transmitter or signal generator to provide a few watts power test signal.
* An antenna bridge is able to measure at low power, but also requires a supplied test signal; depending on the bridge circuit, it can be used to measure both reactance and resistance by reading values marked on knobs that have been adjusted for a match.
* The noise bridge and network analyzers both supply their own very low-power test signals; both are able to measure both resistance and reactance, either by calculation or by reading knobs adjusted for a match. Modern analyzers directly display resistance and reactance, with the calculations done internally by a microprocessor.

===Antenna bridge===
A bridge circuit has two legs which are frequency-dependent complex-valued impedances. One leg is a circuit in the analyzer with calibrated components whose combined impedance can be read on a scale. The other leg is the &quot;unknown&quot; – either an antenna or a reactive component.

To measure impedance, the bridge is adjusted, so that the two legs have the same impedance. When the two impedances are the same, the bridge is balanced. Using this circuit it is possible to either measure the impedance of the antenna connected between ANT and GND, or it is possible to adjust an antenna, until it has the same impedance as the network on the left side of the diagram below. The bridge can be driven either with &quot;white noise&quot; or a simple carrier (connected to drive). In the case of white noise the amplitude of the exciting signal can be very low and a radio receiver used as the detector. In the case where a simple carrier is used then depending on the level either a diode detector or a receiver can be used. In both cases a null will indicate when the bridge is balanced.

===Complex voltage and current meters===
A second type of antenna analyzer measures the complex voltage across and current into the antenna. The operator then uses mathematical methods to calculate complex impedance, or reads it off a calibrated meter or a digital display. Professional instruments of this type are usually called network analyzers.

Modern analyzers do not require the operator to adjust any and knobs as with the bridge-type analyzers. Many of these instruments have the ability to automatically sweep the frequency over a wide range and then plot the antenna characteristics on a graphical display. Doing this with a manually-operated bridge would be time-consuming, requiring one to change the frequency and adjust the knobs at each frequency for a match.

===High and low power methods===
Many transmitters include an SWR meter in the output circuits which works by measuring the reflected wave from the antenna back to the transmitter, which is minimal when the antenna is matched. Reflected power from a badly tuned antenna can present an improper load at the transmitter which can damage it. The SWR meter requires about 5–10 watts of outgoing signal from the radio to register the reflected power (if any), and then only indicates the relative degree of mismatch, not the reactive and resistive impedance seen at the end of the antenna&#x27;s feedline.

A complex-impedance antenna analyzer typically only requires a few milliwatts of power be applied to the antenna, and typically provides its own signal, not requiring any test signal from a transmitter. Using a low-power test signal avoids damaging the analyzer when testing a badly-matched antenna. In addition, because its signal power is very low, the analyzer can be used for frequencies outside of the transmit bands licensed to its operator, and thus measure antenna performance over an unrestricted range of frequencies.

<text>The Volkswagen XL1 (VW 1-litre) is a two-person limited production diesel-powered plug-in hybrid produced by Volkswagen. The XL1 car was designed to be able to travel 100 km on 1 litre of diesel (), with a fully charged battery, while being both roadworthy and practical. Without using electric, the XL is able to travel 100 km on 2 litres of diesel. To achieve such economy, it was produced with lightweight materials, a streamlined body and an engine and transmission designed and tuned for economy. The concept car was modified first in 2009 as the L1 and again in 2011 as the XL1.

A limited production of 250 units began by mid 2013 and pricing started at (~ ). The Volkswagen XL1 plug-in diesel-electric hybrid was available only in Europe and its 5.5 kWh lithium-ion battery delivered an all-electric range of , had a fuel economy of under the NEDC cycle and produced emissions of 21 g/km of . The XL1 was released to retail customers in Germany in June 2014.

==History==

=== 2002 VW 1-litre model ===
The prototype VW 1-litre concept car was shown to the public in April 2002 when Ferdinand Piëch, then chairman of the board of management, drove the concept between Wolfsburg and Hamburg as part of the Volkswagen annual meeting of stockholders.

For aerodynamics, the car seats two in tandem, rather than side-by-side. There are no rear view mirrors and it instead uses cameras and electronic displays. The rear wheels are close together to allow a streamlined body. The total aerodynamic drag is minimal because both the drag coefficient and frontal area are small (see drag equation). The drag coefficient (&quot;C&quot;d) is 0.159, compared to 0.30 - 0.40 for typical cars.

The external dimensions of the car are long, wide and tall. There is of storage space. The car features an aircraft-style canopy, flat wheel covers and an underbelly cover to smooth the airflow. The engine cooling vents open only as needed.

For light weight, the car uses an unpainted carbon fibre skin over a magnesium-alloy subframe. Individual components have been designed to be low weight, including engine, transmission, suspension, wheels (carbon fibre), brakes (aluminium), hubs (titanium), bearings (ceramic), interior, and so on. Empty vehicle weight is .

The body and frame are designed with crush/crumple zones and roll-over protection, and the tandem seating means large side crush zones. Volkswagen claims protection comparable to a GT racing car. The car has anti-lock brakes, airbags with pressure sensors, and stability control.

The engine is a one-cylinder diesel producing just . It drives through a six-speed transmission that combines stick-shift mechanics, weight, and drive efficiency with automatic convenience and efficiency controls. There is no clutch pedal. The gear selection (forwards, reverse or neutral) is made using a switch on the right-hand side of the cockpit. The engine is switched off automatically during deceleration and stops, and auto-restarted when the acceleration pedal is pressed.

According to Volkswagen, the vehicle consumes , giving it a driving range on one tank of fuel.

At the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show senior VW exec Ferdinand Piëch claimed the car would be available by the end of the decade.

Around June 2008 car magazines were reporting a powerplant change to a two-cylinder diesel-electric hybrid. Volkswagen only expected the car to be a limited production run, and prices were expected by one industry insider to be between €20,000 and €30,000.

=== 2009 VW L1 model ===
The second Volkswagen 1-litre car, named &quot;L1&quot;, was first shown to the public at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. Limited production of the VW L1 was expected to start in 2013 but with the announcement of the XL1 in 2011 this was considered unlikely.

The L1 continues the two-seater tandem concept first shown in the 2002 1-litre concept. It has a curb weight of , with a low coefficient of drag of 0.195. It is in length, tall and wide. Frontal area is , giving a drag area (CdA) of .

It uses one half of a 1.6-litre TDI engine in a hybrid installation. The 800 cm3, twin-cylinder, common-rail turbodiesel is joined by a electric motor and has a emission 39 g/km. The engine operates in two modes: &quot;eco&quot; mode, giving , and &quot;sport&quot; mode giving . The electric motor provides extra acceleration and can power the L1 on its own for short distances. Volkswagen claimed the L1 can achieve a top speed of , with acceleration in 14.3 s.

=== 2011 VW XL1 model ===

The &quot;XL1&quot; is the third iteration of the Volkswagen 1-litre car, unveiled at the 2011 Qatar Motor Show. The diesel plug-in hybrid prototype is branded as a &quot;Super Efficient Vehicle&quot; (SEV).

According to Volkswagen, the XL1 can achieve a combined fuel consumption of and emissions of 24 g/km. Like the L1, the XL1 uses a two-cylinder turbo-diesel. Displacing , it is rated at and of torque and transmits power to the rear wheels through a seven-speed DSG transmission. The electric motor pitches in with and of torque, and can work in parallel with the diesel or drive the car independent of it. Fully charged, the XL1 can travel up to on electric power.

The XL1 has a curb weight of , and a (a similar drag coefficient to the General Motors EV1 electric car). Frontal area is 1.5 m2 giving a m2.
Just 23.2% of the car () is made out of either steel or iron; the drivetrain weighs . The XL1&#x27;s length and width are similar to the Volkswagen Polo, with a length of and width of . However, the car is much lower with a height of only , and has a coupe-like roofline, reducing interior volume. The design incorporates butterfly doors, with the interior seating layout using a staggered side-by-side arrangement similar to a Smart Fortwo, rather than the previous versions&#x27; tandem seating.

Performance credentials include a governed top speed of , with acceleration to in 11.9 seconds.

==Production version==
In February 2012, Volkswagen confirmed that it would build a limited series of XL1s starting in 2013. The production version of the plug-in diesel-electric hybrid was unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show.

As with the 2011 concept XL1, it is powered by an 800 cm3 two-cylinder diesel engine with and a electric motor. The combined power output is and torque is . Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox. The wheels are fitted with low rolling resistance tyres sized 115/80 R15 (front) and 145/55 R16 (rear). The drag coefficient has increased slightly from 0.186 to 0.189. The production version delivers an all-electric range of , in addition to a 10-litre fuel tank which allows for over of real-life driving until the car needs to be refueled.

In February 2013, Volkswagen announced that it expected the XL1 to achieve a fuel consumption of and emissions of 21 g/km of . The test cycle allows for a re-charge of the battery every which results in a high mpg value.

Using diesel alone the car is capable of up to . One reviewer found that, in real-life traffic, with air conditioning on and without attempts at hypermiling, the car is able to reliably achieve .

==Production and sales==
Production began by mid 2013 and was limited to 250 units. A total of 50 units had been built by early September 2013, and the remaining 200 XL1s were scheduled to be built in the second quarter of 2014. Prices started at . The XL1 was available in Europe only. Retail deliveries began in Germany in June 2014.

Of the 250 units to be produced, 200 were to be sold to retail customers. Volkswagen opened a registration process for interested customers that closed on 18 October 2013. Because more than 200 potential buyers registered, a drawing was conducted to select the customers with a purchase option for the available cars. They were offered a purchase contract and after the payment of a deposit, the purchase agreement for an XL1 was binding.

==Reception==
The Volkswagen XL1 was selected in February 2014 as one of the top five finalists for the 2014 World Car of the Year.

<text>The Royal Scottish Academy building, the home of the Royal Scottish Academy, is an art museum in Edinburgh, Scotland. It is situated at the junction of The Mound and Princes Street in the centre of the city. It was built by William Henry Playfair in 1822–6. Along with the adjacent National Gallery of Scotland, their neo-classical design helped to transform Edinburgh into the cityscape known as &quot;the Athens of the North&quot;. Today the structure is a Category A listed building.

==History==

The building was originally proposed by the Scottish Board of Manufactures and Fisheries in 1821 to provide shared accommodation for three separate cultural organisations: the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts and a museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. The building was known as the &quot;Royal Institution&quot; from 1826 to 1911.

The Royal Institution building was designed by the noted Scottish architect William Henry Playfair and built in 1822–6. According to the antiquary James Grant, 2000 piles were driven into the ground to stabilise the foundations on the site above the Nor Loch. The construction works are depicted in an 1825 painting by Alexander Nasmyth, in which Playfair can be seen supervising the erection of the fluted Doric columns.

In 1826, a group of artists broke away from the Royal Institution after disagreements over its policies, taking the name of the &quot;Scottish Academy&quot;. From 1835, the group leased gallery space in the Royal Institution building to mount exhibitions of its growing art collection, and in 1838 the group received a royal charter and became the &quot;Royal Scottish Academy&quot; (RSA). One of its key aims was to found a national art gallery for Scotland, and this was realised in 1859, when a new gallery building was built by Playfair, the National Gallery of Scotland, adjacent to the RI building. The building housed RI&#x27;s collection of Old Master paintings along with the RSA collection.

In 1831–6, the Board of Manufactures and Fisheries extended the Royal Institution.

At the end of the 19th century, the Society of Antiquaries relocated its museum to new premises on Queen Street (the building that now houses the Scottish National Portrait Gallery), while the Royal Society moved to 22-24 George Street, and in 1907, the Royal Institution moved to the new Edinburgh College of Art. In 1911, the RSA, which had been sharing space in the National Gallery building since 1859, was granted permanent tenancy of the old RI building and the right to hold its annual exhibition there. The building became known as the &quot;Royal Scottish Academy&quot;, a name it retains to this day. The former RI building was remodelled in 1911–12 by William Thomas Oldrieve, with the addition of new galleries on the upper level.

Today, the Royal Scottish Academy Building is managed by National Galleries Scotland but a 1910 Order grants the RSA permanent administration offices in the building.

==Architecture==
The RSA building is designed in the neo-classical style, modelled on a Greek Doric temple. The rectangular structure is faced with sandstone ashlar stone from Culallo, Fife, and Craigleith. It is surrounded by a colonnade of fluted Doric columns on a stylobate. A Doric entablature runs above the columns, consisting of a sculpted acanthus frieze with triglyphs. The north and south elevations are fronted by prostyle octastyle porticoes surmounted by large pediments decorated with scrolled foliate carving. The east and west sides feature smaller pedimented projections.

The north portico on the Princes Street side is topped by a large statue of Queen Victoria styled as Britannia, sculpted by Sir John Steell (Playfair&#x27;s original drawings indicate that a Britannia statue with a reclining lion was originally intended for the building). Each of the four corners of the building is topped by a pair of carved stone sphinxes, also by Steell.

In 2003 railings (lost in World War II) together with a series of traditional lamps, were restored around both the academy and the National Gallery behind, isolating each building from the public space here.

In the 2010s, the RSA building was refurbished as part of the £32 million Playfair Project, and linked to the Scottish National Gallery by a subterranean public area to create a single, integrated arts complex with an additional entrance in Princes Street Gardens.

The Royal Scottish Academy Building is frequently confused with the neighbouring building, the Scottish National Gallery (SNG), due to their architectural similarity. The RSA Building is surrounded by fluted Doric columns, while the SNG is distinguished by its colonnade of plainer Ionic columns.

==Exhibitions==
Exhibition space is shared throughout the year by the RSA with the NGS and other exhibiting societies: the Society of Scottish Artists, Visual Arts Scotland and the Royal Society of Watercolourists.

<text>Elgin City Football Club (also known as City or The Black and Whites) is a professional senior football club based in Elgin, Moray.

Elgin was founded in 1893 and originally played their football in the Highland Football League. The club was granted league status in 2000. They currently compete in the Scottish Professional Football League in Scottish League Two.

==History==
The present Elgin City club was formed on 10 August 1893 by the amalgamation of two Elgin sides, Rovers (Formed 1887) and Vale of Lossie (Founded 1888). However the name Elgin City was used by two clubs prior to this. The first was formed in October 1879, but lasted for only a short time. The second Elgin City was formed in October 1884 and lasted until early 1887.

The present club&#x27;s first major honour came in the 1898–99 season when they became the first team outside Inverness to win the North of Scotland Cup, beating Clachnacuddin 2–1. However, they failed to record any more success aside from the Elgin District Cup until 1924 when they again won the North of Scotland Cup a second time. Since then they have won honours with relative frequency.

In 1968 the club reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup, the furthest into the tournament that a Highland League club has ever progressed.

The club was granted league status in 2000 when the SPL was expanded to twelve clubs leaving two places to be filled. Peterhead joined them in the Third Division from the Highland League. Since joining the SFL, Elgin have struggled with consistency, and to this date have neither been promoted or relegated, but in season 2003–04 they recaptured the North of Scotland Cup.

In December 2005, assistant manager Kenny Black saw a takeover bid thwarted at the eleventh hour. Many fans saw his bid as the best chance to move upward through the leagues, but a controversial sale of shares in the club meant Black&#x27;s bid was defeated. David Robertson, manager at the time, also chose to leave the club. Former Lossiemouth manager Graham Tatters was subsequently named as Elgin&#x27;s new chairman. Club captain at the time Jamie McKenzie was appointed caretaker manager and a run of good results was rewarded with the Manager of the Month award for December 2005; at the time he was the youngest serving manager in the UK.
Early in 2006, former Aberdeen, Ross County and Scotland international, Brian Irvine was appointed manager. However, following a very poor start to the 2006–07 season, he left the club despite having forged a good relationship with the fans.

After a brief spell under interim manager Graham Tatters (during which they lost to Highland League Deveronvale in the Scottish Cup Third round), former Clachnacuddin manager Robbie Williamson was appointed in January 2007. Williamson quit on 20 December 2008, before a game with Berwick Rangers. He left the team bottom of the Third Division after just two wins from 15 matches.

On 23 January 2009, former player of Everton, Norwich City, Dundee, Dunfermline Athletic and Kilmarnock, Ross Jack was named as the club&#x27;s new manager, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract. He was a former player-manager of Montrose and former assistant coach at Ross County. On 5 January 2013, Elgin City became the first club to take a point from Rangers at Ibrox in the season, with the game finishing 1–1. Ross Jack left the club on 22 January 2014 after five years in charge, with the club lying in second bottom position of the division. In his time at the club, the high point was reaching the divisional play-offs at the end of season 2011–12.

Former player and assistant manager Barry Wilson was appointed as manager on 28 January 2014 and announced his intention to have a squad of north-based players. Barry Wilson resigned as manager on 17 November 2014 and was replaced by Jim Weir 10 days later. On 30 April 2016, they sealed the runners up spot in Scottish League Two and entered the promotion Play-offs. However, they lost 5–1 on aggregate to Clyde and remained in League Two. The club finished fifth in 2017, missing out on a play off spot by one point. 2018 saw another mid-table finish, as the club ended the campaign in sixth place on 49 points. In 2019, the club finished in eighth place, 24 points clear of the playoff spot.

==Ground==
Elgin City have played at Borough Briggs since 1921 when it replaced Cooper Park. The ground currently has a capacity of (478 seated) and is the most northerly football league ground in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="880406" wikidata="Q3492725" url="?curid=880406" title="Caustic (mathematics)">
<text>In differential geometry, a caustic is the envelope of rays either reflected or refracted by a manifold. It is related to the concept of caustics in geometric optics. The ray&#x27;s source may be a point (called the radiant) or parallel rays from a point at infinity, in which case a direction vector of the rays must be specified.

More generally, especially as applied to symplectic geometry and singularity theory, a caustic is the critical value set of a Lagrangian mapping where is a Lagrangian immersion of a Lagrangian submanifold &quot;L&quot; into a symplectic manifold &quot;M&quot;, and is a Lagrangian fibration of the symplectic manifold &quot;M&quot;. The caustic is a subset of the Lagrangian fibration&#x27;s base space &quot;B&quot;.
==Explanation==

Concentration of light, especially sunlight, can burn. The word &quot;caustic&quot;, in fact, comes from the Greek καυστός, burnt, via the Latin &quot;causticus&quot;, burning.

A common situation where caustics are visible is when light shines on a drinking glass. The glass casts a shadow, but also produces a curved region of bright light. In ideal circumstances (including perfectly parallel rays, as if from a point source at infinity), a nephroid-shaped patch of light can be produced. Rippling caustics are commonly formed when light shines through waves on a body of water.

Another familiar caustic is the rainbow. Scattering of light by raindrops causes different wavelengths of light to be refracted into arcs of differing radius, producing the bow.

==Catacaustic==
A catacaustic is the reflective case.

With a radiant, it is the evolute of the orthotomic of the radiant.

The planar, parallel-source-rays case: suppose the direction vector is formula_1 and the mirror curve is parametrised as formula_2. The normal vector at a point is formula_3; the reflection of the direction vector is (normal needs special normalization)
:formula_4
Having components of found reflected vector treat it as a tangent
:formula_5
Using the simplest envelope form
:formula_6 
:::formula_7
:formula_8
:::formula_9
which may be unaesthetic, but formula_10 gives a linear system in formula_11 and so it is elementary to obtain a parametrisation of the catacaustic. Cramer&#x27;s rule would serve.

===Example===
Let the direction vector be (0,1) and the mirror be formula_12
Then
:formula_13   formula_14   formula_15   formula_16   formula_17   formula_18
:formula_19
:formula_20
and formula_10 has solution formula_22; &quot;i.e.&quot;, light entering a parabolic mirror parallel to its axis is reflected through the focus.

<text>Montrose Football Club is a Scottish semi-professional football team, based in the town of Montrose, Angus. The club was founded in 1879. They are members of the Scottish Professional Football League and currently play in Scottish League One, the third tier of football in Scotland.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The first Montrose Football Club was formed on 25 February 1871 after a meeting of local young men seeking to organise the practice of the &#x27;national game of football&#x27; on the Links of Montrose. The variety of football played at the time did not resemble the modern game and was more akin to rugby. Friendly matches amongst club members and townsfolk, Montrose Academical, Arbroath and Aberdeen University were played over the next few years before the club was dissolved. On 8 September 1877, a new football club was formed at a meeting at Montrose Academy.

During the new club&#x27;s annual meeting on 13 October 1879 at the Town&#x27;s Buildings, the committee unanimously resolved to change the rules of the club to those of General Association, with an association rules match amongst club members played later that week on 18 October 1879.

The club played their first external association rules match against Arbroath Wanderers on 8 November 1879. Given the fact that the Montrose side were unfamiliar with new rules of the game, the team unsurprisingly lost 4–0. They are the 18th oldest association football team in Scotland still in existence.

Montrose first played on the Links before eventually moving to the first Links Park, which was situated to the east of Dorward House. The original Links Park was not considered to be suitable for football and the club moved to the present-day Links Park in 1887 on land rented from the &#x27;Auld Kirk&#x27;.

Montrose made their Scottish Cup debut in 1887 with a 5–7 win away to Broughty. By 1890, Montrose had one of the stronger teams in the Scottish game. In the intervening years since the club&#x27;s formation, they had beaten Aberdeen and played several teams from the West of Scotland such as Dumbarton, Third Lanark Volunteers and Glasgow Thistle.

In 1891, Alex &#x27;Sandy&#x27; Keillor became the first Montrose player to receive a Scotland cap in a call-up for their win against Wales in Wrexham. Keillor received one more cap during his time at Montrose, scoring the opening goal in a 3–2 victory over Ireland in Belfast during the 1891–92 British Home Championship. Fellow &#x27;Gable Endie&#x27; George Bowman was also capped in that match. To this day, Bowman and Keillor remain the only players to be selected for Scotland whilst playing for Montrose.

George Bowman also captained Montrose to their first piece of silverware, the Forfarshire Cup, with a 5–3 win over Dundee East End in the 1892 final at West Craigie Park.

In 1921, Montrose won the Scottish Qualifying Cup after defeating Nithsdale Wanderers 2–1 in the second replay of the final at Ibrox.

They joined the Scottish Football League in 1923, along with near-neighbours Brechin City, in the newly founded Third Division. In 1923–24 they achieved a creditable fourth-placed finish. However, the following season Montrose finished at the bottom of the table, and despite signs of a recovery in 1925–26, lost their league place when the Third Division was scrapped owing to the financial difficulties experienced by many of the member clubs. Montrose are one of only two teams from the sixteen teams in the 1925–26 Third Division who are still competing today in the SPFL.

The club was re-admitted to the Second Division in 1929–30. In the 1930s, the first few league seasons after re-admission were difficult, with the club regularly finishing in the bottom four of the table. Montrose did however reach the quarter-finals of the 1929–30 Scottish Cup, drawn away to eventual winners Rangers. Perhaps the best result of that difficult decade came in the 1938–39 Scottish Cup, when in the first round, Montrose sensationally knocked out holders East Fife by a 2–1 scoreline at Bayview Park.

=== Post-war Period ===
In the immediate postwar period, Montrose spent time playing in the newly formed Division C, consisting of provincial clubs and some first division reserve sides. In the 1947–48 Scottish Cup Montrose played Celtic at Celtic Park in the quarter-finals, losing 4–0. With the re-formation of the Second Division in 1955–56, the club once again joined that league.

=== Halcyon Days ===
The club&#x27;s halcyon period was the mid-1970s when, under player-manager Alex Stuart, Montrose reached third place in the old First Division, and were a feared and respected cup side, notably reaching the semi-final of the 1975–76 Scottish League Cup and the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup in 1972–73 and 1975–76 - to this day their best performances in both respective cups. In the second round of 1974–75 Scottish Cup, Montrose recorded their largest victory in modern times when they beat Vale of Leithen 12–0. Although this was an &quot;away&quot; fixture, due to a fire at their opposition&#x27;s ground this tie was played at Links Park. In the 1975–76 Scottish Cup quarter-final, Montrose were only 90 seconds away from a famous victory in front of over 8,000 spectators at Links Park against Hearts, until an injury time equaliser from Graham Shaw sent the match to a replay. If Montrose had beaten Hearts, they would have potentially earned a match-up against Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1976–77 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup as probable Scottish Cup runners-up.

Montrose won their first championship under the guidance of Iain Stewart in 1984–85, as they triumphed in the old Second Division. Relegation followed in 1987 as the part-time club found themselves outgunned in a league largely consisting of full-time teams.

=== The 1990s ===
Under co-managers Doug Rougvie and Chic McLelland, Montrose won promotion to Division One in 1991, after finishing as runners-up to Stirling Albion, but were relegated after one further season in the higher league.

Montrose have spent the vast majority of their recent history in the relative obscurity of the Third Division. At the end of the 1994–95 season, they were promoted to the Second Division after finishing second behind champions Forfar Athletic. However, the team&#x27;s first attempt at this higher level was not successful, as they finished bottom of the table in 1995–96.

=== 21st Century ===
In the second round of the 2003–04 League Cup, Montrose were drawn away to SPL side Hibernian where they were crushed 9–0.

Following a disappointing beginning to 2005–06 season, manager Henry Hall left the club by mutual consent, shortly followed by assistant Ian Gilzean. Former Montrose player Eddie Wolecki was appointed new manager of the team on 12 December 2005. In July 2006 Aberdeen businessman Kenny Black invested money in the club and was offered a place on the board which he accepted. David Robertson (ex Aberdeen, Rangers and Leeds United player) became co-manager with Wolecki, but the latter parted company with the club in September 2006. Following a very poor run of results David Robertson left the club in early 2007, replaced in time by ex-St Johnstone stalwart Jim Weir, assisted by experienced defender Kevin McGowne.

Links Park underwent a transformation ahead of the 2007–08 campaign. A new artificial pitch was laid, so the game on 21 April 2007 was the last game on grass for the foreseeable future. A smaller training pitch was installed beside the main stand. New state of the art catering facilities and changing rooms were also installed. The fortunes of the club on the pitch also improved with several big name signings and a great start to the season propelled Montrose into the top four for the majority of the season. Montrose came in third in the league and were pitted against Stranraer in the Second Division playoffs. A 1–1 draw in the first leg at Links Park, was followed by a second leg in which Montrose went down 3–0. They were thus confined to the Third Division for yet another season.

The 2008–09 pre-season was very quiet and few new signings were made; rumblings of discontent and rumours of behind the scenes fighting were proved to be true as boss Jim Weir was sacked by the Board after a 2–1 defeat to Cowdenbeath with six months still to run on his contract. U17&#x27;s boss Steve Adam took the reins before ex-Dundee United and Celtic defender David Hannah became caretaker boss. Hannah left the club in mid-December after a poor defeat to Cowdenbeath. During this game, fans made their feelings felt after Hannah threatened a fan and criticised the away support from the previous week after the dreadful 5–0 defeat away at East Stirlingshire. Director of Football Kenny Black took the reins over the Christmas period until Montrose appointed Steven Tweed as player-manager. During January many of the players from Jim Weir&#x27;s reign were shipped out and a number of new loanees appeared. Things began to gel and Montrose won six out of their last nine games with a smaller, much younger squad who narrowly missed out on the playoffs.

The 2009–10 season began terribly for the Montrose faithful, with the team failing to win any Division Three matches at all up to 16 January. However, the club reached the 2009–10 Scottish Cup fifth round, where they were defeated by Hibernian at Easter Road. On 10 April, Brian Winton stepped down as chairman. The club finished bottom of the Third Division for the first time in eleven years.

2011 saw Steven Tweed finally step down due to work commitments with the RBS. Ray Farningham &amp; Stuart Garden were given the job of leading the team till the end of the season however the board moved quickly to secure the pair on two year contracts. In the final game of the season popular player Hugh Davidson chose to retire from the game.

During the 2012–13 season, Montrose faced Rangers four times in the league due to the latter&#x27;s financial troubles and subsequent placement into the Scottish Third Division. Montrose managed to draw both home and away matches against the Glasgow team but lost the other two encounters. The home games attracted crowds of over 4,500 at Links Park. Notably, Montrose&#x27;s 4–2 home defeat against Rangers was televised on ESPN, marking the first live televised match for Montrose.

At the end of the 2014–15 season, Montrose came last in League Two, but maintained their status in the SPFL after a 3–2 aggregate win in a play-off against Highland Football League champions Brora Rangers. Two goals in the second half of the home leg by Marvin Andrews and Gary Wood saved the club from dropping into non-league football.

=== Stewart Petrie Era ===
Stewart Petrie was appointed manager in December 2016 after the sacking of Paul Hegarty a month earlier due to a run of poor performances, which led to the club sitting bottom of League Two. The appointment of Petrie vastly improved the fortunes of the team, achieving a 4th-place finish at the end of season and qualification for the League One playoffs for the first time in nine years. Montrose ended up losing 4–1 on aggregate to Peterhead in the playoff semi-final.

The 2017–18 season was more notable for altogether happier reasons. Montrose were promoted as League Two champions finishing one point ahead of Peterhead, who had pushed them all the way to the last game. This saw Montrose end 22 consecutive seasons in Scotland&#x27;s fourth tier.

After promotion, Petrie continued to steer the club in a favourable direction in League One, achieving top four finishes and Championship playoff spots for four consecutive seasons. Montrose also reached the round of 16 of the 2020–21 Scottish Cup, their best performance in over a decade, losing to Kilmarnock 3–1 at Rugby Park in the fourth round. Their third-place finish in the 2021–22 League One season was the highest for the club in the Scottish football league system since their 12th-place finish in the 1985–86 old First Division.

During the 2023–24 season, Montrose had three matches televised live on BBC Alba, including a 3–2 win over Queen of the South at Palmerston Park.

== Rivalries ==
Montrose share a strong rivalry with local side Arbroath, and matches between the two are usually intense and widely anticipated by both sides. Montrose also share local rivalries with fellow Angus sides Brechin City and Forfar Athletic, with games played by two of any of these teams (including Arbroath) being known as Angus derbies.

=== International capped players ===
&quot;Bold denotes player still actively playing international football.&quot;

In November 2022, former Montrose forward, Martin Boyle was named as a member of the Australia squad at the 2022 World Cup. He is only the third former Montrose player to have also been a member of a World Cup squad, with the others being Jimmy Rooney, a member of the Australia squad at the 1974 World Cup, and Marvin Andrews, a member of the Trinidad and Tobago squad at the 2006 World Cup. Unfortunately, both Boyle and Andrews sustained injuries prior their respective World Cups and thus Rooney is the only former Montrose player to actually play in the World Cup.

<doc id="880409" wikidata="Q378178" url="?curid=880409" title="Bitch (magazine)">
<text>Bitch was an independent, quarterly alternative magazine published in Portland, Oregon. Its tagline described it as a &quot;feminist response to pop culture&quot;, and it was described in 2008 by the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; as &quot;a respected journal of cultural discourse&quot;. As a feminist publication, it took an intersectional approach.

&quot;Bitch&quot; was published by the nonprofit feminist media organization Bitch Media. The magazine included analysis of current political events, social, and cultural trends, television shows, movies, books, music, advertising, and artwork. Its print magazine had about 80,000 readers. The magazine&#x27;s publisher, Kate Lesniak, estimated that it had an online readership of 4.5 million. On April 12, 2022, it was announced that Bitch Media would cease operations in June 2022.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
The first issue of &quot;Bitch&quot; was a ten-page feature, &quot;Bitch: Feminist Response to Pop Culture&quot;, which started as a zine distributed out of the back of a station wagon in 1996, published in January 1996 in Oakland, California. The founding editors, Lisa Jervis and Andi Zeisler, along with founding art director Benjamin Shaykin, wanted to create a public forum in which to air thoughts and theories on women, gender, and feminist issues, interpreted through the lens of the media and popular culture. In a 2008 interview, Zeisler stated that the zine published content of interest to the editors and which wasn&#x27;t available elsewhere. Prior to founding the magazine, Jervis and Zeisler had worked as interns at &quot;Sassy&quot;, another feminist magazine. 

Later speaking about the decision to name the magazine &quot;Bitch&quot;, Zeisler stated that it was inspired by reclamation of the word &#x27;queer&#x27; by the LGBT community. The editors viewed the word &#x27;bitch&#x27; as associated with a derogatory description of outspoken women so thought it best to claim the word in advance.&quot; Other reasons for the name included its capability to intrigue people, and the word&#x27;s use as both a verb and a noun. Zeisler stated that: &quot;Having the word &#x27;feminist&#x27; in the magazine subtitle has been far more controversial than having the word &#x27;bitch&#x27; in the title... the word &#x27;bitch&#x27;, for better or worse, has become part of our cultural lexicon. Yet &#x27;feminist&#x27; is still one of those words that people find very hard to understand.&quot;

=== Expansion ===
In 2001, a loan from San Francisco&#x27;s Independent Press Association allowed Jervis and Zeisler to quit their current jobs and work on &quot;Bitch&quot; full-time and the magazine officially became a non-profit. Around that time, Shaykin left the magazine. By the early 2000s, the magazine had achieved a readership of about 35,000, which grew to 47,000 by 2006.

The magazine was the subject of an obscenity controversy when it published a dildo advertisement on its back cover for its Fall 2002 issue. Responses to this were mixed, and &quot;Bitch&quot; later published varying opinions about the incident from letters sent by readers. Later interviewed about the events, Zeisler expressed that there had been a certain naivety about the impact of placing the advert on the back cover. The U.S. Postal Service contacted the magazine and stated that copies of the issue would be considered obscene literature and would have to be distributed in black polybags.

&quot;Bitch&quot; celebrated its 10th anniversary in August 2006 by publishing a &quot;Bitch&quot; anthology entitled &quot;BITCHfest: Ten Years of Cultural Criticism from the Pages of Bitch Magazine&quot;. Edited by &quot;Bitch&quot; founders Jervis and Zeisler, &quot;BITCHfest&quot; includes essays, rants and raves, and reviews reprinted from previous issues of &quot;Bitch&quot; magazine, along with new pieces written especially for the anthology.

In March 2007, &quot;Bitch&quot; relocated from its offices in Oakland, California, to Portland, Oregon. In 2009, the &quot;Bitch&quot; nonprofit changed its name to &quot;Bitch Media&quot;, covering expansion beyond publication of the magazine. The magazine&#x27;s 50th issue was published in 2011. That same year, &quot;Bitch&quot; won an Utne Reader Independent Press Award for Best Social/Cultural Coverage.

In 2011, &quot;Bitch&quot; partnered with feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian to create the video series &quot;Tropes vs. Women&quot;. The series examined common tropes in the depiction of women in media with a particular focus on science fiction. As of 2012, &quot;Bitch&quot; hosted the Bitch YA Book Club for young women and girls, which focused on young adult literature. The reading group&#x27;s online blog included a forum for club participants.

&quot;Bitch Media&quot; also hosted podcasts, and a college speaker series, &quot;Bitch on Campus&quot;. &quot;Popaganda&quot; was hosted by Amy Lam and Sarah Mirk, who discussed politics, news, and media. &quot;Backtalk&quot; was hosted by Amy Lam and Dahlia Balcazar, who reviewed and discussed the week in popular culture through a feminist lens.

=== Decline and closure ===
Bitch Media experienced difficulty funding its magazine in its final years. On April 12, 2022, Bitch Media announced they would be shutting down the publication after 26 years. The magazine&#x27;s last issue was released in June 2022, for its Summer edition. &quot;Bitch Media&quot; ceased all operations the same month. According to Bitch Media, its website would keep archives of its publications available for the &quot;foreseeable future&quot;.

<doc id="880412" wikidata="Q1186629" url="?curid=880412" title="Nordic Games">
<text>The Nordic Games were the first international multi-sport event that focused primarily on winter sports, and were held at varying intervals between 1901 and 1926. It was organized by Sweden&#x27;s Swedish Central Association for the Promotion of Athletics, and more specifically by Viktor Balck, a member of that association and one of the five original members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It was, in many ways, a to the modern Winter Olympic Games, whose success was a contributing factor (along with the social and economic turmoil following World War I) to the Nordic Games&#x27;s discontinuation in the 1920s.

== History ==
The Nordic Games began in Stockholm in February 1901, after being conceived in 1899 by the Swedish Central Association for the Promotion of Sports (SCFIF) led by Viktor Balck, a well-known Swedish sports figure. He is quoted as saying, &quot;Above all we placed the national goal of rendering a service to the fatherland and bringing honor to our country.&quot; The Nordic Games have now become a national concern for our entire people.&quot; They were held every four years thereafter through 1926. Many believe that this event led to the implementation of the Winter Olympics as we know them today. The Nordic Games began as an effort to bolster both Swedish national sentiment along with Swedish tourism. The Nordic Games featured not only the snow and ice related sports that the country excelled in but also showcased Swedish cultural events such as theatre, opera and folklore. Tourist attractions were also highlighted.

==Games through the years==
Similar games were held in Helsinki in Finland in 1907. According to some sources these were Nordic Games, but it is unclear whether they were formally named Nordic Games or not.

== Sports ==
The Nordic Games consisted of the winter sports that were popular in Scandinavia at the time, such as ski jumping, downhill racing, cross-country skiing, skeleton, speed skating, figure skating, hockey (which at the time was a term used for bandy) and curling. Some non-winter sports were also included like fencing, swimming and a long-distance equestrian ride. Many other sports that are rarer or less commonly thought of as winter sports today were also included, such as horse-driven sledding, glima, hunting, skiing behind reindeer ( skijoring), military sports, car racing, motorcycle racing, ballooning, kick-sled, and pulka racing.

===Bandy results===

The sport of bandy was featured at the Nordic Games beginning in 1901. The final match in 1901 was the second real bandy match played in Sweden. The first took place between the same teams earlier the same year and was won by Stockholm 4-1.

As many as 16 teams took part in the 1905 game.

In the 1909 game, AIK participated as &quot;Swedish Football Association A&quot;, while the &quot;B-team&quot; was beaten in the final which consisted of players from IFK Uppsala, Djurgårdens IF, IFK Gävle, IFK Stockholm and The Sea Cadets. On the way to the final, AIK defeated the Copenhagen Skating Association 3-0.

In 1913, seven teams participated and IFK Helsinki was responsible for the non-Swedish element. The Finns lost however, already in the quarterfinals with 4-2 against the final winners AIK. Even a German team, Leipziger HK, would have participated in 1913, but was absent because the event clashed with the 1913 European Bandy Championships (Bandy-EM) in Switzerland. The 1913 European Bandy Championships had been won by England and had six more participating nations: Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France, Belgium and Holland.

Denmark&#x27;s Bandy Union participated in the 1917 tournament and came fourth (out of six teams) after losing their matches with 0-13 (Stockholm, semifinals) and 0-16 (Västmanland, match for third prize). The Danes were also invited to the 1922 game, but despite an unusually bandy-friendly winter in Denmark that year, they abstained.

During the Nordic Games in 1917, the bandy SM semi-finals and final were also decided as part of the arrangements.

In 1922 it was a national team tournament and Sweden beat Norway 13-1 in the semifinals in the first meeting between the two countries. Because the Norwegians at that time played 7-man a side bandy, a match was also arranged between Norway and a Stockholm by combining it into a smaller one, the variant. It was this match that Stockholmers won 7-2.

In the last Nordic Games in 1926, the bandy tournament existed between provincial teams with Norway as foreign element.

== Ties to Winter Olympics ==
The Nordic Games were one of the first to lead to international championships in winter sports. For example, the skating championships raised the international appeal of the Nordic Games. Viktor Balck, the founder of the Nordic Games, was also a charter member of the International Olympic Committee and a president of the International Skating Union. He is credited with holding the ISU together through the end of World War I. He also established the World Championship Events for Ladies and Pairs, who were not recognised before this. Balck was known as the ISU president with the longest tenure of 30 years of any president before him. He was elected the first honorary president of the ISU. All of his participation helped the Olympics take hold. The Winter Olympics as we know it today began in Chamonix, France in 1924. Prior to this time, some winter sports such as figure skating and ice hockey were held during the Summer Olympics.

== Decline ==
The Nordic Games mainly included only competitors from the Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, and Norway. These countries ended up opposing the establishment of a separate Winter Olympics because it would take away from their nationalistic efforts. Sweden and Norway had political differences during this time which led Norway to cease participation in the games, which caused some controversy. After Viktor Balck died in 1928, there was no one to champion the cause, particularly after the 1930 games had to be cancelled due to a lack of snow. The Winter Olympics turned out to be highly successful right from the beginning and their international appeal overshadowed the Nordic Games.

<doc id="880416" wikidata="Q1599204" url="?curid=880416" title="Illocutionary act">
<text>The concept of illocutionary acts was introduced into linguistics by the philosopher J. L. Austin in his investigation of the various aspects of speech acts. In his framework, &quot;locution&quot; is what was said and meant, &quot;illocution&quot; is what was done, and &quot;perlocution&quot; is what happened as a result.

When somebody says &quot;Is there any salt?&quot; at the dinner table, the &quot;illocutionary act&quot; is a request: &quot;please give me some salt&quot; even though the &quot;locutionary act&quot; (the literal sentence) was to ask a question about the presence of salt. The &quot;perlocutionary act&quot; (the actual effect), might be to cause somebody to pass the salt.

==Overview==
The notion of an illocutionary act is closely connected with Austin&#x27;s doctrine of the so-called &#x27;performative&#x27; and &#x27;constative utterances&#x27;: an utterance is &quot;performative&quot; &quot;if, and only if&quot; it is issued in the course of the &quot;doing of an action&quot; (1975, 5), by which, again, Austin means the performance of an illocutionary act (Austin 1975, 6 n2, 133). According to Austin&#x27;s original exposition in &quot;How to Do Things With Words&quot;, an illocutionary act is an act:
* (1) for the performance of which I must make it clear to some other person that the act is performed (Austin speaks of the &#x27;securing of uptake&#x27;), and
* (2) the performance of which involves the production of what Austin calls &#x27;conventional consequences&#x27; as, e.g., rights, commitments, or obligations (Austin 1975, 116f., 121, 139).

Thus, for example, in order to make a promise I must make clear to my audience that the act I am performing is the making of a promise, and in the performance of the act I will be undertaking a conventional obligation to do the promised thing: the promisee will understand what it means to make a promise and fulfill it. Thus, promising is an illocutionary act in the present sense. Since Austin&#x27;s death, the term has been defined differently by various authors.

One way to think about the difference between an &quot;illocutionary act&quot; (e.g., a declaration, command, or a promise), and a &quot;perlocutionary act&quot; (e.g., a listener&#x27;s reaction) is to note how in the former case, by uttering the object — for example, &quot;I hereby promise you&quot; — (and assuming that all other necessary features of the performative situation pertain), then the act has taken place: a promise was made. The perlocutionary result (how the promisee reacts) might be acceptance, or skepticism, or disbelief, but none of these reactions alter the illocutionary force of the statement: the promise was made.

That is to say, in each case a declaration, command, or promise has necessarily taken place in virtue of the utterance itself, whether the hearer believes in or acts upon the declaration, command, or promise or not.

On the other hand, with a perlocutionary act, the object of the utterance has not taken place unless the hearer deems it so — for example, if one utters, &quot;I hereby insult you,&quot; or &quot;I hereby persuade you&quot; — one would not assume an insult has necessarily occurred, nor persuasion has necessarily taken place, unless the hearer were suitably offended or persuaded by the utterance.

== Approaches to defining &quot;illocutionary act&quot; ==

Whereas Austin used &quot;performative&quot; to talk about certain kinds of utterances as having &quot;force,&quot; his term &quot;illocution&quot; rather names a quality or aspect of all utterances. They will have a locutionary sense or meaning, an illocutionary force, and a perlocutionary result. This approach has encouraged the view that even true/false constative statements have illocutionary force (as in &quot;I hereby state and affirm&quot;) and even performatives can be evaluable as true/false statements (as &quot;guilty&quot; verdict might be right or wrong). 
It is also often emphasised that Austin introduced the illocutionary act by means of a contrast with other aspects of &quot;doing&quot; by &quot;speaking.&quot; The illocutionary act, he says, is an act performed &quot;in&quot; saying something, as contrasted with a locutionary act, the act &quot;of&quot; saying something, and also contrasted with a perlocutionary act, an act performed &quot;by&quot; saying something. Austin, however, eventually abandoned the &quot;in saying&quot; / &quot;by saying&quot; test (1975, 123).

According to the conception adopted by Bach and Harnish in &#x27;Linguistic Communication and Speech Acts&#x27; (1979), an illocutionary act is an attempt to communicate, which they analyse as the expression of an attitude. Another conception of the illocutionary act goes back to Schiffer&#x27;s book &#x27;Meaning&#x27; (1972, 103), in which the illocutionary act is represented as just the act of meaning something.

According to a widespread opinion, an adequate and useful account of &quot;illocutionary acts&quot; has been provided by John Searle (e.g., 1969, 1975, 1979). In recent years, however, it has been doubted whether Searle&#x27;s account is well-founded. A wide-ranging critique is in FC Doerge 2006. Collections of articles examining Searle&#x27;s account are: Burkhardt 1990 and Lepore / van Gulick 1991.

== Classes of illocutionary acts ==
Searle (1975) set up the following classification of illocutionary speech acts:
* assertives = speech acts that commit a speaker to the truth of the expressed proposition
* directives = speech acts that are to cause the hearer to take a particular action, e.g. requests, commands and advice
* commissives = speech acts that commit a speaker to some future action, e.g. promises and oaths
* expressives = speech acts that express on the speaker&#x27;s attitudes and emotions towards the proposition, e.g. congratulations, excuses and thanks
* declarations = speech acts that change the reality in accord with the proposition of the declaration, e.g. baptisms, pronouncing someone guilty or pronouncing someone husband and wife
The classification is intended to be exhaustive but the classes are not mutually exclusive: John Austin&#x27;s well-known example &quot;I bet you five pounds it will rain&quot; is both directive and commissive.

== Illocutionary force ==

Several speech act theorists, including Austin himself, make use of the notion of an &quot;illocutionary force&quot;. In Austin&#x27;s original account, the notion remains rather unclear. Some followers of Austin, such as David Holdcroft, view illocutionary force as the property of an utterance to be made with the &quot;intention&quot; to perform a certain illocutionary act—rather than as the successful performance of the act (which is supposed to further require the appropriateness of certain circumstances). According to this conception, the utterance of &quot;I bet you five pounds that it will rain&quot; may well have an illocutionary force even if the addressee doesn&#x27;t hear it. However, Bach and Harnish assume illocutionary force &quot;if, and only if&quot; this or that illocutionary act is actually (successfully) performed. According to this conception, the addressee must have heard and understood that the speaker intends to make a bet with them in order for the utterance to have &#x27;illocutionary force&#x27;.

If we adopt the notion of illocutionary &quot;force&quot; as an aspect of meaning, then it appears that the (intended) &#x27;force&#x27; of certain sentences, or utterances, is not quite obvious. If someone says, &quot;It sure is cold in here&quot;, there are several different illocutionary acts that might be aimed at by the utterance. The utterer might intend to describe the room, in which case the illocutionary force would be that of &#x27;describing&#x27;. But she might also intend to criticise someone who should have kept the room warm. Or it might be meant as a request to someone to close the window. These forces may be interrelated: it may be by way of stating that the temperature is too cold that one criticises someone else. Such a performance of an illocutionary act by means of the performance of another is referred to as an &quot;indirect speech act&quot;.

== Illocutionary force indicating devices (IFIDs) ==

Searle and Vanderveken (1985) often speak about what they call &#x27;illocutionary force indicating devices&#x27; (IFIDs). These are supposed to be elements, or aspects of linguistic devices which indicate either (dependent on which conceptions of &quot;illocutionary force&quot; and &quot;illocutionary act&quot; are adopted) that the utterance is made with a certain illocutionary force, or else that it constitutes the performance of a certain illocutionary act. In English, for example, the interrogative is supposed to indicate that the utterance is (intended as) a question; the directive indicates that the utterance is (intended as) a directive illocutionary act (an order, a request, etc.); the words &quot;I promise&quot; are supposed to indicate that the utterance is (intended as) a promise. Possible IFIDs in English include: word order, stress, intonation contour, punctuation, the mood of the verb, and performative verbs.

== Illocutionary negations ==

Another notion Searle and Vanderveken use is that of an &#x27;illocutionary negation&#x27;. The difference of such an &#x27;illocutionary negation&#x27; to a &#x27;propositional negation&#x27; can be explained by reference to the difference between &quot;I do not promise to come&quot; and &quot;I promise not to come&quot;. The first is an illocutionary negation—the &#x27;not&#x27; negates the promise. The second is a propositional negation. In the view of Searle and Vanderveken, illocutionary negations change the type of illocutionary act.

<text>Cove Rangers Football Club is a senior Scottish football club currently playing in Scottish League One. They are based in the Altens area of Aberdeen and play their football at Balmoral Stadium, having left their former home at Allan Park, Cove Bay in April 2015.

==History==

Cove were formed in 1922 and played in the local amateur leagues until 1985, when they became a junior team. However, the club applied and were accepted to the senior Highland Football League in 1986, where they played until winning promotion to Scottish Football League division 2 in May 2019, after beating Berwick Rangers 7–0 on aggregate in the pyramid playoff. They have also racked up a formidable reputation in the lower rounds of the Scottish Cup, reaching the 3rd round three times. In 2001 they won their first Highland League championship – but even more impressively won the &#x27;treble&#x27; of Highland League, Aberdeenshire Shield and Scottish Qualifying Cup.

In the 2007–08 season, Cove reached round four of the Scottish Cup for the first time, beating Brora Rangers away 5–0, Keith 3–0 and Edinburgh University 1–0 on the way, before losing 4–2 to Ross County.

However, the south Aberdeen side claimed their second ever Highland League Championship with a 3–0 home win against Lossiemouth on 3 May 2008.

Cove Rangers were one of the clubs who prepared an application for entry into the Scottish Football League following Gretna relinquishing their league status on 3 June 2008. The other clubs were Annan Athletic, Preston Athletic and Spartans. Annan Athletic were eventually awarded the place, due to their superior facilities.

One of the club&#x27;s most famous players is the young Scottish midfielder Paul Coutts who joined English League One club Peterborough United during the summer of 2008 for a nominal fee. Coutts won the club&#x27;s &quot;Young Player of the Year&quot; award for the 2008–09 season and won eight caps for the Scotland under-21 squad, after being touted for a call up by his former manager Darren Ferguson.

In 2016 the club regained their Highland League crown. Due to the introduction of the &#x27;pyramid system&#x27; in Scottish football, Cove elected to say goodbye to their Allan Park home due to the stadium not meeting SPFL minimum stadia requirements. This in turn meant the club played all of their games at an away ground with Inverurie Locos, Formartine United and Banks O&#x27;Dee offering the use of their facilities so the club could compete. Cove went on to win the league and advance to the first play-off game against the winner of the Lowland League, Edinburgh City. The tie was won by City 4–1 on aggregate who subsequently progressed to Scottish League Two after beating East Stirlingshire in the second playoff tie.

===Back to back promotions and rise to League One===
In the 2018–19 season they were promoted to SPFL League Two for the first time in their history after defeating Berwick Rangers 7–0 on aggregate in the League Two play-off.

In their first season in the SPFL, they won League Two after the season was terminated early due to the Coronavirus pandemic. This resulted in back-to-back promotions for Cove, with the club gaining promotion to SPFL League One for the first time.

=== Promotion to the Championship ===
In their first League One campaign, Cove narrowly lost out on promotion by 4 points to eventual winners Partick Thistle, finishing 3rd in the League and losing 4–3 on aggregate to Airdrieonians in the Play-offs.

In the 2021–22 season, Cove won the League One title by 7 points, only losing 3 league games all season, securing promotion to the Scottish Championship for the first time in their history.

The 2022–23 Championship season saw Cove go into their final match against Greenock Morton one point ahead of Hamilton Academical at the bottom, however a 1–2 defeat at a foggy Balmoral Stadium coupled with a goalless draw for Hamilton at Arbroath meant that both Cove and Hamilton finished level on points but Cove were relegated to League One after just one season due to an inferior goal difference.

== Stadium ==

From 1948 to 2015, Cove played at Allan Park, which was located in Cove. The ground had a capacity of 2300 spectators, with 200 on seats or benches. Its largest attendance was 2,100, in the league playoff in 2008–09 vs Deveronvale which they won 3–1 to lift the league title for the third year running. Allan Park was named after a local farmer, who sold the club the land on which they built the ground in 1948.

On Friday, 30 July 2010, an article was placed in the local Aberdeen paper, the &quot;Evening Express&quot; that Stewart Milne, the chairman of Aberdeen F.C., had bought Allan Park. This scheme was thrown into doubt, however, when Aberdeen City Council rejected an application by the two clubs to build a new ground for Cove Rangers that Aberdeen would also have used as a training ground. Nevertheless, on 18 April 2015, Cove Rangers played their final game at Allan Park following progress being made with Aberdeen City Council in terms of planning permission. In this game Cove marked their departure with a 4–0 victory over Fort William. Allan Park had been bought by housing developers for a figure believed to be around the £3m mark. The sale also included a social club, also owned by the football club, which closed its doors the following day.

Cove then began construction of their revised new stadium. The new facility, known as &#x27;Balmoral Stadium&#x27; is located in Altens, next to a new secondary school, with the merging of Kincorth and Torry Academies into one larger school. In a clause made by Aberdeen City Council, this new school will have access to the new stadium&#x27;s artificial pitch.

In July 2018, Cove moved into the Balmoral Stadium, having played home games at Inverurie Loco Works&#x27; ground in the intervening period. The first match at the Balmoral Stadium took place on 16 July 2018, but had to be abandoned after a Cove player was seriously injured.

<text>Deveronvale Football Club are a senior association football club currently playing the Highland Football League in Scotland. They were founded in 1938 and play their football at the Princess Royal Park in the town of Banff, (formerly Banffshire, now officially Aberdeenshire), Scotland.

The club was formed in 1938 when Deveron Valley and Banff Rovers joined, five years after the demise of the previous senior club in the town, Banff F.C. The name comes from the River Deveron, which has its mouth at Banff.

After they were formed, it took them one year to get into the Highland League. In August 1939, Deveronvale played their first league game. Their first win came a month later. In 1948 Deveronvale signed James ‘Jimmy’ Williamson from Dunipace Juniors, Jimmy would go on to play for Deveronvale for 7 years and in the process set the record for highest number of individual goals in the Highland League at 197 goals. The crest of Deveronvale FC was designed during the early 1970s by local school teacher, Mr. Chris Murray. He chose a &#x27;heraldic&#x27; seagull to represent the twin fishing towns of Banff and Macduff.

In 2003 the Vale won the Highland League title for the first time in their history and repeated this feat once more three years later.

Due to them being a senior team, they can play in the Scottish Cup. In the 2006–07 season, Deveronvale made it into the fourth round of the Scottish Cup after a 5–4 defeat of Third Division side Elgin City, before going out at home to First Division side Partick Thistle.

In the 2011–12 season, Deveronvale entered the Scottish Challenge Cup for the first time.

The club celebrated its 80th anniversary in the 2018–19 season.

<text>Forres Mechanics Football Club are a senior Scottish association football club from the town of Forres, Moray, currently playing in the Highland Football League. They play at the town&#x27;s Mosset Park. Forres Mechanics are the oldest association football club in the North of Scotland and are one of only two original teams to play in the Highland League since its first season in 1893, the other being Clachnacuddin.

==History==
Their unusual name is variously stated to come from the town&#x27;s Mechanics Institute or most likely when a group of craftsmen or mechanics split from an earlier Forres team to form their own club. Forres Mechanics have won the Highland league twice: in the 1985–86 season and in the 2011–12 season.

On 26 November 2016, Forres Mechanics played their most high-profile match in recent years when they held League One side Stenhousemuir to a 2–2 draw in 2016–17 Scottish Cup, however they lost 3–1 in the replay.
During the 2020–21 season, which was greatly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, 
Forres withdrew from the Highland League before returning the following season.

<text>Fort William Football Club is a senior football team from Fort William, Lochaber, Scotland. They play in the North Caledonian Football League, having been relegated from the Highland Football League in 2022 after 37 seasons.

== History ==

===Origins and the early years===

The club was founded in 1974 by then chairman Colin Neilson and started out playing mainly friendlies and cup competitions, such as the Scottish Qualifying Cup, the North of Scotland Cup and the Inverness Cup.

In the late 1970s, their most famous player to date, John McGinlay made his senior debut for Fort William at the age of 14, coming on as a substitute in a North of Scotland Cup tie with now Scottish Professional Football League side Elgin City (formerly of the Highland League). 
At the age of 17, he moved to Nairn County, and would later go on to play in the Premier League with Bolton Wanderers and eventually represent Scotland. He was childhood friends with another, now former, professional footballer Duncan Shearer, who also hailed from Fort William.

Ever since forming in 1974, the club campaigned for entry into the Highland League, but were rejected many times. In 1983, Fort William were admitted to the North Caledonian League. The club enjoyed wins in the two-year spell in the North Caledonian League. They won both the &quot;Chic Allan Cup&quot; and &quot;Morris Newton / SWL Cup&quot; in successive seasons, while also winning the &quot;Football Times Cup&quot; and finishing as runners-up in the league in the 1983–84 season. 

In the 1984–85 season, the club won the division outright, making it their only league championship victory to date.

In the 1985–86 season, the club was admitted to the Highland League. Fort William played their first Highland League match against their nearest league team Clachnacuddin, with striker Gordon MacIntyre scoring the goal in a 1–0 home win. 
In that season, they recorded their highest-ever attendance of 1,500, against the Scottish Football League side Stirling Albion in the Scottish Cup 2nd round, with a 0–0 draw, before losing 6–0 in the replay at Annfield a week later.

===Recent times===

The club was unable to build upon their relatively competitive start to life in the Highland League, and gradually, season-by-season, began to struggle to the point where they had finished bottom in 14 of the 18 seasons between 1996–97 and 2013–14. Their struggles included a record 17–0 away defeat in 1998, to now Scottish League One side Peterhead. Despite this, &quot;The Fort&quot; did not finish bottom that season, with the wooden spoon going to Nairn County. In the 2008–09 season, they accumulated only a solitary point from 28 matches, making it the Highland League&#x27;s record lowest points total since its inception.

During the 2008–09 season, an exciting future appeared forthcoming, when television producer and former Lochaber resident, Paul MacDonald, unveiled his vision for the football team. In conjunction with his American Entertainment company, &quot;PMAC Tonight&quot;, he planned to create a reality TV series based around the toiling team. The premise was to import some of the best young American talent from college campuses across the USA, in an attempt to take Fort William &quot;From Worst to First&quot;, in what was envisaged to be the ultimate underdog story. However, after much initial media hype, the project failed to materialise.

The club formerly fielded a reserve side in the North Caledonian Football League, but were forced to disband this team prior to the 2011–12 season due to a lack of playable pitches in the Fort William area – something that has always plagued the club. They were, however, able to set up an Under 19s team, which was formed with the sole purpose of participating in the Scottish Youth Cup.

In January 2015, the club made history when it recorded four consecutive league victories for the first time since joining the Highland League, after a 2–1 success over Clachnacuddin.

The club&#x27;s continuing presence in the Highland League was threatened in early 2018 as all six directors announced they would be stepping down at the end of the season. However, despite a poor season (picking up just five points and conceding over 180 goals), it was announced that Fort William would continue its involvement for the 2018–19 season.

Five games into the 2018–19 season and still pointless, the club was deducted nine points by the Highland League after fielding an ineligible player on three occasions. They finished the season with no wins and two draws from their 34 games, ending on −7 points. This led to them being dubbed in 2019 &quot;&quot;The worst football team in Britain&quot;, by many news media publishers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lillibury/worst&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Merritt/worst&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2019, Scottish Championship club Inverness Caledonian Thistle loaned nine players to Fort William to both prepare the youngsters for professional football and bolster the Fort William squad.

On 31 July 2019, Fort William won their first competitive match in 707 days when they defeated Nairn County 5–2 in a North of Scotland Cup tie, ending a 69-game run without a victory. This win came one day after BBC Scotland broadcast &quot;The Fort&quot;, a documentary on the club&#x27;s winless run. After another winless month, Fort William finally recorded their first league win in 882 days on 11 September, with a 1–0 home win against Clachnacuddin.

In the 2021–22 season, Fort William finished bottom of the table and were relegated to the North Caledonian League after forfeiting their play-off match against North Superleague side Banks O&#x27; Dee F.C.

&quot;Fort William became the first team to be relegated from the Highland League last season and were unable to play in the play-off final after being unable to raise a team.&quot; — &quot;Strathspey Herald&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;S-H/299959&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (January 2023)In November 2024, it was announced that the SFA had rejected Fort William&#x27;s re-application for an entry level SFA Licence, leaving the club ineligible for promotion back into the Highland League and ineligible to compete in the Scottish Cup unless they win the North Caledonian League.

== League positions ==

All final positions are from the Highland League.

== Claggan Park ==

Their ground, Claggan Park, has a capacity of 1,800 – and is sometimes regarded as one of the most picturesque grounds in the United Kingdom, mainly due to the views of the nearby Ben Nevis mountain range.

Claggan Park consists of standing areas on all sides of the pitch, with one &#x27;rustic&#x27; stand that can seat 200 spectators.
To date, the record attendance is 1,500 – recorded in a 1985 Scottish Cup 2nd round tie against Scottish League side Stirling Albion.

Often during the autumn and winter months, many home matches are postponed (usually due to a waterlogged pitch) – a consequence of the heavy rainfall the town experiences.

<doc id="880429" wikidata="Q7674080" url="?curid=880429" title="Tactical Neural Implant">
<text>Tactical Neural Implant is the sixth full-length studio album by electro-industrial artists Front Line Assembly. Third Mind Records originally released it in 1992 on both compact-disc and LP formats. The album has also been issued by Roadrunner in a two-disc set that includes the &quot;Millennium&quot; album.

The album contains what some reviewers regard as some of Front Line Assembly&#x27;s best songs, including the singles &quot;The Blade&quot; and &quot;Mindphaser&quot;. The album still receives heavy play in industrial and electronic music dance clubs and is considered &quot;a classic among clubgoers, DJs, and musicians even now.&quot;

==Musical style and writing==
&quot;Tactical Neural Implant&quot; veers away from the more abrasive elements found on the &quot;Caustic Grip&quot; album. Vocals, while heavily effected, are often paired with vocoders and more melodic elements of which can be heard on the drum and bass opening of &quot;The Blade&quot;&quot;&quot;, the latter parts of &quot;Bio Mechanic&quot;&quot;&quot; and the overall composition of &quot;Lifeline&quot;&quot;&quot;. Like on earlier releases, Front Line Assembly worked with multi-layered samples.

&quot;Tactical Neural Implant&quot; is an example how the band&#x27;s side projects influence the writing of Front Line Assembly songs. &quot;We got some ideas for FLA songs during the Intermix sessions, for example, &quot;Outcast&quot;&quot;, said Rhys Fulber to Electric Shock Treatment Magazine. &quot;We keep everything separate because we want to keep the visions of each separate&quot;, he continued, &quot;It&#x27;s nice to work on a bunch of things and then do a new FLA album. [...] It keeps us interested [...] I think you can grow musically during a short period of time if you do lots of different things. [...] On the FLA album we were spending six hours a day at least on it.&quot;

===&quot;Mindphaser&quot;===
&quot;Mindphaser&quot; is the first single taken from &quot;Tactical Neural Implant&quot;. The single was released April 7, 1992, on Third Mind. It includes two versions of the title track and the tracks &quot;Toxic&quot; and &quot;Mutilate&quot; that were also released as bonus tracks on the Japanese edition of the album. A promotional music video for &quot;Mindphaser&quot; won &quot;Best Alternative Video&quot; at MuchMusic&#x27;s 1992 Canadian Music Video Awards. The award-winning video was directed by Robert Lee and produced by Gary Blair Smith and took two months to make. The video depicts Front Line Assembly inserted into clips of the Japanese science fiction film &quot;Gunhed&quot;. The Japanese film company let Front Line Assembly use any footage of the film in exchange for the right to use any changes the band would make for themselves. The video also received airplay on MTV. &quot;Mindphaser&quot; was voted the sixth greatest industrial song of all time by COMA Music Magazine in their feature article &quot;101 Greatest Industrial Songs of All Time&quot;.

After having won the award, Front Line Assembly shed some light on the production of the video on MuchMusic. Bill Leeb considered their approach to writing to be quite unconventional. &quot;I was shown some footage first&quot;, said Leeb, &quot;we actually wrote the song to the footage. Also the lyrics were written to the footage.&quot; &quot;There was a lot of brainstorming between us and the people involved in the video&quot;, added Rhys Fulber. According to the band it was rather the images than the actual plot of the film the video clip is based on that inspired writing. &quot;The actual storyline is kind of hard to follow because it&#x27;s all in Japanese obviously&quot;, Fulber explained. Although &quot;even just visually it&#x27;s hard to follow [...] it&#x27;s just the imagery we found quite amazing.&quot; Leeb commented on concerns that the imagery might push the music into the background. &quot;A lot of times videos actually wreck songs&quot; by pushing the listener in a direction, he said. In contrast, &quot;this way it worked hand in hand really well.&quot;

Lyrically, &quot;Mindphaser&quot; is an example of what S. Alexander Reed calls Front Line Assembly&#x27;s many references to &quot;industrial music&#x27;s intellectual heritage&quot;. &quot;Mindphaser&quot; borrows a few lyrics from industrial band Clock DVA&#x27;s song &quot;The Hacker&quot;, which appeared on their 1989 album &quot;Buried Dreams&quot;.

The single was re-released in 1998 through Zoth Ommog on the compilation album &quot;The Singles: Four Fit&quot;.

===&quot;The Blade&quot;===
&quot;The Blade&quot;, the second single from the album, was released through Third Mind in two versions with different artwork. The North American version contains four tracks, namely two versions of &quot;The Blade&quot; and non-album tracks &quot;Re-Animate&quot; and &quot;Laughing Pain&quot;. The European version is an eight-track single and features the songs of the North American version along with two additional remixes of &quot;The Blade&quot; and additional non-album tracks &quot;Target&quot; and &quot;Heatwave&quot;. &quot;Laughing Pain&quot; is featured on the soundtrack of 1999 American horror film &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;. &quot;The Blade (Technohead)&quot; made it on the list of the favourite dance remixes of music magazine The Quietus in 2014.

==Release==
&quot;Tactical Neural Implant&quot; sold more than 70,000 copies. It was the first Front Line Assembly album to be officially released in Japan.

In October 2019, Canadian label Artoffact started a crowdfunding campaign in order to obtain the album licenses and to re-release the album on vinyl on May 4, 2020.

In 2022, American independent record label Wax Trax! Records issued a 30th anniversary edition of the album on vinyl that was remastered by Greg Reely.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Tactical Neural Implant&quot; is widely viewed as one of Front Line Assembly&#x27;s best releases. Theo Kavadias of Allmusic said, &quot;Front Line Assembly, one of the premiere electro-industrial acts, has done much to help define what the genre is about. &quot;Tactical Neural Implant&quot; is one of the releases which has contributed most to this claim, setting a standard with its cool, calm, and collected electronic harmonies and driving bass.&quot; Billboard wrote, &quot;Wisely, the act keeps the beats heavy, while continuing to explore loosely structured melodies and dark lyrical interludes.&quot; The song &quot;Mindphaser&quot; was ranked No. 6 on &quot;COMA Music Magazine&quot;&#x27;s 101 Greatest Industrial Songs of All Time. Bill Leeb said the video for the song was the only one by the band to receive regular airplay on MTV. The blog io9 ranked &quot;Tactical Neural Implant&quot; among the &quot;100 albums every science fiction and fantasy fan should listen to&quot;.

<text>Fraserburgh Football Club is a senior football club based in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire. The fishing port is known locally as &#x27;The Broch&#x27; hence the club nickname. They currently play in the Highland Football League in Scotland and also enter the annual Scottish Cup.

==History==
The club were formed in 1910 and play at Bellslea Park. Prior to 1910, they played as a select side made up of the best players from the local amateur league. The club&#x27;s colours (consisting of black and white stripes) were acquired from a local fish merchant who had links with Newcastle United, and the tradition has since been kept, with the traditional away kit consisting of a sky blue shirt, white shorts and sky blue socks. 

Fraserburgh&#x27;s first ever match was an away tie in the Scottish Qualifying Cup against rivals Peterhead, which Fraserburgh won 3–1. In their first season they went on to win the Aberdeenshire Cup, defeating Buckie Thistle at Pittodrie Stadium.

They were granted admission into the Highland Football League in 1921 and up until that time they competed in the Aberdeenshire Cup and Scottish Cup.

Fraserburgh&#x27;s most famous victory was in the Scottish Cup on 31 January 1959, where they defeated Dundee, one of the top clubs in Scotland at the time, 1–0 at Bellslea Park. This is widely regarded as the biggest ever &#x27;giant killing&#x27; shock in the Scottish Cup.

On 21 January 1970, the Fraserburgh lifeboat &quot;The Duchess of Kent&quot; was lost, being turned over by a freak wave approximately from Fraserburgh while trying to escort the Danish fishing vessel &quot;Opal&quot; to safety. Only one of the six crew members survived. After the disaster, Jock Stein took his Celtic side to the Broch for a fundraising game, which Fraserburgh lost 7–0.

Another one of Fraserburgh&#x27;s most memorable games was a 10–0 victory away to local rivals Peterhead in the Highland League Cup on 14 August 1974. They have always had a rivalry with Peterhead but as Peterhead got promoted into the Scottish league the rivalry has wavered somewhat.

During 1984, Charlie Duncan was named new manager due to Brian McCann&#x27;s departure; he eventually went on to manage his 1,000th game in charge during October 2009 in a Scottish Cup tie against Bonnyrigg Rose. Duncan&#x27;s tenure brought huge success to the club; becoming champions for only the third time in the club&#x27;s history, winning the Highland League Cup for the first time in 47 years, the two Qualifying Cup wins in 1995–96 and 2006–07, as well as an Aberdeenshire Cup in 1996 and five Aberdeenshire Shield wins – 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1999. Duncan&#x27;s tenure ended when he was sacked from the club in July 2011, after an eventful 27 years at the helm. 

Fraserburgh are now the permanent holders of the Qualifying Cup (North), as they won the last competition at Princess Royal Park, Banff when they beat Keith 2–1 in November 2006, with goals from Marc Dickson and Michael Stephen.

The club has progressed to the fourth round (last 32) of the Scottish Cup three times. In 2013–14 they lost 3–0 away to Stenhousemuir. In 2017–18 they lost at home to Rangers 3–0. And in January 2025 they lost 5-0 at Ibrox, again to Rangers. 

In 2022 Fraserburgh secured their fourth Highland League title – their first for 20 years. As champions, Fraserburgh progressed to the Pyramid Play-offs where they played Bonnyrigg Rose; losing 3–1 away and winning 1–0 at Bellslea, thus losing 3–2 on aggregate. 

Also as a result of being Highland League champions, Fraserburgh qualified for the 2022–23 Scottish League Cup, being drawn in Group B with Kilmarnock, Montrose, Stenhousemuir, and Partick Thistle.

==Stadium==

The club&#x27;s home ground is Bellslea Park. The capacity is 3,000 and the stand can hold 480 people.

<text>Huntly Football Club are a senior football club, currently playing in the Highland League in Scotland. The club was founded in 1928 and plays at Christie Park in Huntly.

==History==
Huntly F.C. was formed in 1928. They were unanimously accepted to the Highland League at the league&#x27;s AGM in June 1928. The club entered the league in season 1928–29 and the first game was against Inverness Thistle on Saturday 25 August 1928. In only its second league campaign, Huntly became only the third team outside Inverness to win the league, finishing two points ahead of closest rivals Elgin City and Inverness Thistle. However, the club would have to wait 64 years for another championship win and to many supporters the greatest moment in the club&#x27;s history. The club then won the Highland League in a record five successive seasons between 1993 and 1998.

In December 1975 the Referee&#x27;s Committee of the Scottish Football Association ordered the closure of Christie Park for two months following an incident in which a referee was knocked to the ground by a supporter making his way home across the pitch after a match. The club were also fined £100 and ordered to have Police on duty at all future matches.

In January 2008 Huntly reached the 4th Round proper of the Scottish Cup following victories against Fraserburgh, Annan Athletic and Culter, and although drawn at home to Division 1 team Dundee, they eventually lost 1–3. In September 2009, the club became part of a match fixing probe after a 7–0 win against (then) East of Scotland side Hawick Royal Albert in a Scottish Cup tie. Suspicions arose due to alleged irregular betting patterns surrounding the final score and the awarding of a penalty to Huntly during the game. Nothing was proven and no further actions were taken.

<text>Eric Lee Martin (born October 10, 1960) is an American rock singer who was active throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, both as solo artist and as a member of various bands. He rose to prominence as the frontman for the hard rock band Mr. Big, which scored a big hit in the early 1990s with &quot;To Be with You&quot;, a song that Martin wrote during his teen years.

==Early years==
Eric Martin was born on October 10, 1960 to Frederick Lee &quot;Pepper&quot; Martin and Iris Martin. His father was from Cincinnati, Ohio, having been a drummer and was stationed in the military. As such, his family often moved where he was stationed, including to Germany and Italy. As a child, he had plenty of records and listened to albums to musicals such as &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Hair&quot;. They eventually moved to Sacramento, California.

The Martin family finally settled in the San Francisco Bay Area in about 1972. Martin met up with some of the band members who would join him in his first successful venture: Kid Courage. Kid Courage opened for AC/DC for two shows in the Bay Area, which were AC/DC&#x27;s first shows in America.

Martin was a drummer for a short while. Realizing it fit his personality better, he opted for frontman/lead vocalist in the next bands he joined. He played in a handful of teen rock groups with Randy Richardson, Fil Pearl and Ric Walz-Smith, such as S.F. Bloodshy and Backhome while attending Foothill High School in Sacramento, California. He performed in a punk band in the mid-1970s called The Innocents with Walz-Smith and Connie Champagne. In 1974 Eric played college clubs with Jim Preston in The J.C. Michaels Band. 

Also in 1974, during the summer break , Martin joined a musical comedy workshop held at Mira Loma High School in Sacramento. He auditioned for the part of Judas; although he ultimately did not get the role, he did become the understudy. Martin credits the honing of his voice to his teacher, Judy Davis. She taught him diction, stamina, and breath-control.

Eric started to make it big when he joined Stark Raving Mad (which also included future Winger guitarist/keyboardist Paul Taylor) in Santa Rosa, California. Stark Raving Mad, which also included Donavan Stark and Brian Stark, cut a demo with Bearsville Records that was produced by Chris Nicks, brother of Stevie Nicks.
==Musical influences==
Martin grew up listening to both soul and rock icons in the 1970s, such as Otis Redding, Paul Rodgers, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Edgar Winter, Free, and Humble Pie. When he was about 13 to 15 years old, while living in Italy, he was introduced musically to different artists under Motown Records and Stax/Volt Records.

==Career==

===415 / Eric Martin Band (1978–1985)===
Martin had decided to live independently by the age of 18. His first job was selling ice-cream. Later, John Nymann, guitarist for the band Mile Hi, gave him a call and asked if he would want to form a new band together. The two had known each other since their former bands (Mile Hi and Kid Courage) had played together at the Mabuhay Gardens on Broadway in San Francisco. In agreement, Nymann and Martin got people together from both their previous bands, and formed a new group named 415 – which was the telephone area code for the San Francisco Bay Area, since every person in the band was from there.

415 was formed in late 1979. It marked the start of Martin&#x27;s career as lead vocalist. He stated, &quot;415 played hundreds of shows at area nightclubs, beer parties, even high school and college dances, before eventually headlining San Francisco&#x27;s premiere night club – the Old Waldorf. Selling out in advance, word quickly spread about our dynamic live shows and soon we were opening for established acts like Billy Squier, Hall &amp; Oates, Rick Springfield, Molly Hatchet, the Marshall Tucker Band, and Foreigner, to name a few. Eventually, without yet being signed to a recording contract, we played in front of 60,000 fans at Oakland Stadium at Bill Graham&#x27;s Days on the Green Concert.&quot; The band became a popular local draw, all the while still being an unsigned act.

415 was later signed on to Elektra/Asylum Records under the management of Walter &quot;Herbie&quot; Herbert, Ron Chiarottino, and Sandy Einstein. These three persons managed and worked for the band Journey. The management decided to change the name of the band to the Eric Martin Band (EMB), as singer-named bands were popular during that time. EMB debuted their first album in 1983, entitled &quot;Sucker for a Pretty Face&quot;. The LP received a gold disc &quot;(certification&quot;?), and consequently led to the band&#x27;s appearance on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and in various arena tours as the opening act for ZZ Top, Night Ranger, and Journey. In one interview, Eric mentions that they &quot;worked thousands of shows, from clubs, to frat house parties, Bill Graham concerts, opening for anybody and everybody.&quot; One of the most acclaimed performances of the band was a solo tour in 1983 held at Honolulu, Hawaii. But despite continuing to land high-profile gigs as support for some of the most popular acts at the time, the band decided to split up in 1985 after returning from the ZZ Top tour.

===Solo career after Eric Martin Band (1985–1988)===
After the break-up, Martin continued involving himself in several recordings and gigs. He contributed to the track &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop the Fire&quot; from the movie soundtrack &quot;Teachers&quot;, as well as &quot;These Are the Good Times&quot; and &quot;Eyes of the World&quot; from the movie &quot;Iron Eagle&quot;. In 1985, Eric Martin released the album &quot;Eric Martin&quot;, featuring the minor hit &quot;The Information&quot; which peaked at No. 87 mid-year. It was followed later on in 1987 by &quot;I&#x27;m Only Fooling Myself&quot;, which was re-issued in 2008 by Rock Candy Records. The album is a compilation of songs written by such people as Myles Hunter, John Waite, and a whole host of other established songwriters. It also included top West Coast session musicians such as drummers Mike Baird (who worked with Rick Springfield and Journey) and Mickey Curry (with Bryan Adams and Hall and Oates), guitarists Richie Zito, Tim Pierce, Michael Landau, and Rick Nowells. A compilation of the two solo albums are available on &quot;Soul Sessions – The Capitol Years&quot; CD.

===Mr. Big (1988–2002, 2009–present)===
In 1988, Martin teamed up with Billy Sheehan, Pat Torpey, and Paul Gilbert to form Los Angeles supergroup Mr. Big. The band combined &quot;shredding&quot; musicianship with melodic vocal harmonies. The reputations of the players generated immediate interest in fellow musicians, and the band was signed to Atlantic Records in 1989. That year, the band released their eponymous debut, which received critical and commercial success in the US and Japan. In June 1990, the group toured America with the Canadian band Rush.

The group&#x27;s 1991 release, &quot;Lean into It&quot;, featured two ballads that established them as a commercial success: &quot;To Be with You&quot; (number one song in 15 countries) and &quot;Just Take My Heart&quot;. The album was followed by a British tour in April and May of the same year, supported by bands The Throbs and Heartland.

After another British tour, the band released the &quot;Mr. Big Live&quot; album in 1992. Mr. Big continued work on a third album as they headlined shows across the U.K. in 1993. In December, the band broke away from this run to play as support act for Aerosmith&#x27;s three-night, sold-out stand at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena.

In 1993, another ballad from Mr. Big&#x27;s new album &quot;Bump Ahead&quot; rose to the top 10 of the charts – a cover of Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;Wild World&quot;. Although the band was unable to sustain commercial success in the US, their popularity in Japan continued to soar, leading to several Japan-only live albums as &quot;Raw Like Sushi I&quot;, &quot;Raw Like Sushi II&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Big in Japan&quot; In 1996, Mr. Big released &quot;Hey Man&quot;, which sold strongly in the Far East. In 1997, the band released the album &quot;Live At Budokan&quot; before taking a break from recording and touring.

While recording their fifth studio album, Paul Gilbert announced his decision to leave the band, and new guitarist Richie Kotzen was added to the lineup. The new line-up of Mr. Big released &quot;Get Over It&quot; in September 1999 in Japan. &quot;Get Over It&quot; yielded &quot;Superfantastic&quot;, a number one hit in Japan that went multi-platinum. Mr. Big put in a 20-date tour of Japan followed by a New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999 show with Aerosmith at the Osaka Dome in Osaka. &quot;Get Over It&quot; was released in the U.S. on March 21, 2000, followed by a short club stint at The Roxy Theater in West Hollywood.

In the summer of 2001, Martin and the rest of Mr. Big released &quot;Actual Size&quot; in Japan and the rest of Asia. The CD stayed on the charts in the number three spot and &quot;Shine&quot; the first single off the album was number one. The song was also used as the ending theme for the animation series, &quot;Hellsing&quot;. Though headed for a breakup, the members of Mr. Big performed a farewell tour of Japan and Asia in 2002 as part of a contract they were obliged to comply with.
A near Mr. Big &quot;one-off&quot; reunion took place on May 13, 2008, in Los Angeles, at the House of Blues, when Paul Gilbert was joined onstage by Pat Torpey, Richie Kotzen and Billy Sheehan for renditions of Humble Pie&#x27;s &quot;30 Days in the Hole&quot; and original Mr. Big composition &quot;Daddy, Brother, Lover, Little Boy&quot;. Reportedly, the three had such an amazing time that they decided to contact Eric Martin a few days later, and a reunion of the four original members (Paul, Eric, Pat, and Billy) was put into motion.

The reunion was first officially announced on February 1, 2009, in a Japanese radio program called &quot;Heavy Metal Syndicate by Koh Sakai&quot;. The interviews and press conferences that followed shortly within the first two weeks of February revealed plans of the band to tour Japan in June 2009 and to release new albums. A world tour followed suit, with dates all across Europe, and several gigs in South East Asia, particularly in India, Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, and South Korea.

In 2010, Mr. Big recorded a new album titled &quot;What If...&quot; produced by Kevin Shirley and released in early 2011.

On May 10, 2011, after almost two decades, Mr. Big played the Araneta Coliseum in Manila, the Philippines. The band performed most of the songs from &quot;Lean into It&quot;, and also introduced new songs from &quot;What If...&quot;. The band embarked on a very successful South American tour that ended with two dates in Brazil, at the last of which in the city of Porto Alegre on July 10, according to Eric Martin, Mr. Big had an &quot;end of the tour party&quot; live in front of over 2,000 fans at the local rock venue Bar Opinião.

In October 2014, Mr. Big released &quot;...The Stories We Could Tell&quot; with 13 new songs and a bonus live track of &quot;Addicted to That Rush.&quot; They embarked on a world tour to support the record and an unofficial fifth member of the band joined them on the tour: Matt Starr (from Ace Frehley&#x27;s band,) is a drummer and singer, and Mr. Big recruited him to sit in for Pat Torpey, who had recently been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. While Torpey did tour with the band, he played drums on only a few songs, and typically sat on a stool and sang with the band while Starr handled the rest of the drum duties. Additional dates were planned for rock cruises and West coast dates in early 2016. On July 7, 2017, Mr. Big released &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, its ninth studio album. The record was recorded in six days to accommodate the schedules of the band members and the producer, and was released on the Frontiers Music SRL label. It featured 11 new songs and was produced by Kevin Elson, who also produced Mr. Big&#x27;s debut record in 1989. They embarked on a tour of the United States, followed by tours of Europe and southeast Asia, including a return to the Philippines on October 12, 2017.

On February 7, 2018, drummer Pat Torpey died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at the age of 64. His last show was at the Wulfrun Hall in Wolverhampton on November 23, 2017. A memorial show took place on May 23, 2018, at The Canyon in Agoura Hills, California, with former member Richie Kotzen as a special guest. The all-star finale of &quot;To Be With You&quot; included, among others, Matt Sorum, Dave Amato, Ricky Phillips, Keith St John, Prescott Niles, Kelly Keagy, Jeff Scott Soto, Ace Von Johnson and Gregg Bissonette.

In October 2018, Eric Martin said in interview with Friday NI Rocks that the band is in the process of planning their next album. According to him, once the band is done with its 2019 touring commitments, they will subsequently disband: &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s the last hurrah – that&#x27;s it. It feels a little uncomfortable to keep going without Pat Torpey.&quot;

===Solo projects (1998–present)===
====Solo albums====
While in Mr. Big, Martin was also involved in other projects on the side. In 1995, Martin was the vocalist in The Power Rangers Orchestra, which also featured Guns N&#x27; Roses member Matt Sorum. Their version of &quot;Go Go Power Rangers&quot; was featured in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;. Martin&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;Somewhere in the Middle&quot;, was written during the two-year hiatus from Mr. Big. The CD was completed in 1998 and released in Japan, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Strong Japanese sales prompted a 1998 tour.

In between promoting and preparing for Mr. Big&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Farewell Tour&quot;, Martin continued to record songs for his fourth solo album. He promised a return to his &quot;rawk roots&quot; and he definitely did so with &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; Sane&quot; which was released in Asia, Europe, and the US in late 2002. After the success of a Japan tour, an appearance at the European &quot;Gods Festival&quot;, and a 23-city US tour, Martin decided to go back to the studio to record &quot;Pure&quot;, an EP that covers his hits in an unplugged and stripped-down acoustic form. In 2003, Martin contributed his version of &quot;Cheer Up&quot; to the Japanese release &quot;Sincerely 2 – Mariya Takeuchi Song Book&quot; album. He also came to attention outside of his priority solo activities, portraying the character &quot;Mr. Niko&quot; for a 2004 &quot;Genius&quot; outing &quot;In Search of The Little Prince&quot;.

Martin later recorded another album entitled &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot;, which would then be released in Japan, Europe, the US, and South America in 2004. The album&#x27;s sound is something Eric calls &quot;distorted pop&quot; with a focus on his rock roots.

====Tak Matsumoto Group====
Later in 2002, Martin was contacted by Tak Matsumoto. Tak&#x27;s band, B&#x27;z, has sold over 80 million records and held onto success for over 20 years in Japan. Tak decided to put together a rock band called Tak Matsumoto Group, or TMG, with his favorite players; this would include Martin on vocals, Jack Blades (Night Ranger/Damn Yankees) on bass, and himself on guitar. They spent four months writing and recording an album in Los Angeles, did a 10-day promotional tour in Japan, quickly followed by a Platinum album, and a 20-city sold-out tour from July to September, ending at the Budokan. The Japanese tour for TMG saw the inclusion of Mr. Big&#x27;s &quot;To Be With You&quot; in the set list.

TMG was among the top five bands on &quot;melodicrock.com&quot; during that time, but the band no longer pursued tours beyond Japan.

During the same year TMG was in the works, Eric and Denise were also expecting twin boys by December. In light of this, Martin decided to lie low for the next couple of years.

On March 8, 2024, the band announced its reformation, with a second album and a nationwide tour across Japan in the works.

====Work on different projects====
From 2004 to 2007, Martin was involved in numerous projects while remaining near home. A more comprehensive collection of his works are available on Eric Martin&#x27;s Official Site. His projects included singing tracks on albums of different composers/artists, singing for karaoke games, video games, and TV commercials, and joining benefit concerts all year round. Martin wrote and recorded the theme song for the &quot;Pride Fighting Championships&quot;, which was a major mixed martial arts organization. The song &quot;The Last Man Standing&quot; debuted New Year&#x27;s Eve 2006 on pay-per-view to millions of viewers.

Martin also wrote and recorded a song for guitar legend Ronnie Montrose&#x27;s CD, &quot;10x10&quot;. He sings along with nine other singers including Sammy Hagar, Edgar Winter, Davey Pattison, and Mark Farner. The &quot;10x10&quot; album sparked interest in Eric&#x27;s vocal performance and he was asked to sing the classic song &quot;Guitar Man&quot; with Ronnie Montrose, Denny Carmasi, and Ricky Phillips to take to the Sundance Film Festival. Martin also composed and performed a song called &quot;Fly&quot; for the commercial of Asahi Super Dry Beer in Japan, which was accompanied by a music video.

While taking his family on a stroll along the Marin County Fair, Martin was able to watch a performance by the Nelson Brothers and was later introduced to them by a common friend. The Nelson Brothers, Matthew and Gunnar, invited Martin to join them in the new all-star band they were forming called &quot;Scrap Metal&quot;. Generally, Scrap Metal would be a band dedicated to performing classic heavy metal and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll hits from the 1980s and 1990s.

On February 3, 2007, Eric Martin, together with Matthew and Gunnar Nelson of &quot;Nelson&quot;, Mark Slaughter of &quot;Slaughter&quot;, Jani Lane of &quot;Warrant&quot;, and Kelly Keagy of &quot;Night Ranger&quot;, performed under the &quot;Scrap Metal&quot; banner for an MTV filmed concert at the Mohegan Sun Hotel &amp; Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. They would compose the core of the band. A few months later, he made an appearance as a Guest Vocalist of Japanese Jazz Fusion Band T-Square on their album, 33. The song he was featured in is called &quot;Tell the Truth&quot;, which is based on T-Square&#x27;s hit from 1987, &quot;Truth&quot;. Scrap Metal would tour around the US all year round.

In 2010, Martin participated in a tribute album titled &quot;Mister Bolin&#x27;s Late Night Revival&quot;, a compilation of 17 previously unreleased tracks written by guitar legend Tommy Bolin, prior to his death in 1976. The CD includes other artists such as HiFi Superstar, Doogie White, Troy Luccketta, Jeff Pilson, Randy Jackson, Rachel Barton, Rex Carroll, Derek St. Holmes, Kimberley Dahme, and The 77&#x27;s. A percentage of the proceeds from this project will benefit the Jackson Recovery Centers.

In 2013, Martin was invited to be part of the metal opera project Avantasia, by Tobias Sammet. Martin played the role of a beggar on the album &quot;The Mystery of Time&quot;, performing &quot;What&#x27;s Left of Me,&quot; with Sammet. Martin was also part of their 2013 world tour in support of the album as one of the guest vocalists. He was also part of their 2016 world tour in support of the album &quot;Ghostlights&quot;, notably performing the guest vocal role in the songs &quot;Dying for an Angel&quot;, &quot;The Wicked Symphony&quot; and &quot;Twisted Mind&quot;.

====&quot;Mr. Vocalist 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, solo touring====

In early 2008, Martin was approached, again, by Sony Japan to do a project wherein he would cover (translated) famous Japanese Ballads sung by women. The album, entitled &quot;Mr. Vocalist&quot;, was released in November 2008. The album included ballads such as &quot;I Believe&quot; by Ayaka, &quot;Yuki no Hana&quot; by Mika Nakashima, and &quot;M&quot; by Princess Princess.

Seeing the success of &quot;Mr. Vocalist&quot;, Sony Japan opted to follow it up with another one. &quot;Mr. Vocalist 2&quot; was unique from the first because all the songs included in it were famous international ballads, and were voted in by fans either through the Internet or through mobile phone. Martin and Sony Japan lined up about 30 international ballads sung by women, such as &quot;Hero&quot; by Mariah Carey, &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; by Celine Dion and &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; by The Bangles. The top 12 songs were taken from the list and were covered by Eric and Sony Japan&#x27;s team of top musicians. The resulting album was released on March 4, 2009, and topped the charts in Japan at its debut. For months, it continued to move along the top five albums in Japan.

From 2007 to 2009, Martin toured Europe, South America, and India, with different local bands backing him at each stop along the tour.

It started as an idea a few years before; Eric and Denise were figuring out how to make tours overseas cost effective and fresh per performance. They would call promoters all around the world and book shows 5 months in advance, find the best rock musicians or the most popular bands in the big cities and have them learn 18 to 20 of Eric&#x27;s tunes, send mp3&#x27;s back and forth (and pray for the best). Martin performed across the world with bands such as The Road Vultures from Argentina, Hayseed from Norway, Raw Like Sushi (a Mr. Big tribute band) from Italy, and John McNamara&#x27;s band from Australia.

Martin was invited by the King of Tripura, Kirit Pradyot Deb Burman, to perform Mr. Big songs during the Rock Festival at Shillong. Shillong is well known in India as a place for avid music-lovers, especially rock. Martin and the band members (the Road Vultures) were graciously treated as state guests and were escorted upon arrival in India and during the concert. Amit Paul, a singer from the show &quot;Indian Idol&quot;, together with other Indian celebrities, joined the show and sang part of &quot;To Be With You&quot; with Eric. The gig in India was meant to be only a seven-to-ten thousand seat show; but, as people started to break into the barricades, the crowd got larger (to about 20,800 people). 

Martin also toured with Richie Kotzen in South America, a former bandmate from Mr. Big. On October 10, 2012, Martin released the cover album &quot;Mr. Rock Vocalist&quot;. It features covers of Japanese songs such as &quot;Alone&quot; by B&#x27;z, &quot;Honey&quot; by L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel and &quot;Forever Love&quot; by X Japan, and guest musicians such as Steve Stevens, Marty Friedman and John 5.

<text>Telephone numbers in the Netherlands are administered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation of the Netherlands. The telephone numbering plan may be grouped into three general categories: geographical numbers, non-geographical numbers, and numbers for public services.

Geographical telephone numbers have nine digits and consist of an area code of two or three digits and a subscriber number of seven or six digits, respectively. When dialled within the country, the number must be prefixed with the trunk access code 0, identifying a destination telephone line in the Dutch telephone network.

Non-geographical numbers have no fixed length, but also require the dialling of the trunk access code (0). They are used for mobile telephone networks and other designated service types, such as toll-free dialling, Internet access, voice over IP, restricted audiences, and information resources.

In addition, special service numbers exist for emergency response, directory assistance, and other services by the public authorities.

==Numbering plan==
The telephone numbering plan of the Netherlands is divided into geographical, non-geographical, and special public resource telephone numbers. The dial plan prescribes that within the country dialling both geographical and non-geographical numbers requires a national network access code, which is the digit 0. The following list includes this national trunk access digit when it must be dialled before the number.

066, 084 and 087 are often used by scammers, because they are easy and cheap to register and make identification very hard.

Previously, 06-0, 06-1000 and 06-4 were used for toll-free numbers, 06-8 for &quot;shared cost&quot;, 06-9 for premium rate, and other 06-numbers for mobile numbers. 0011 and later 06-11 was used for emergency services before this changed to 112. 09 was used as the international access code before this changed to 00.

==Geographical telephone numbers==
Since the reorganization of the telephone system in 1995, Dutch geographical numbers consist of 9 digits. The numbering plan implements a system of area codes. An area code consists of two or three digits. The larger cities and areas have two digits with a subscriber number of seven digits, permitting more local numbers. Smaller areas use three digits with a six-digit subscriber number.

Geographic numbers are allocated in blocks to telecommunications providers. However, a telephone number from a block allocated to a certain provider may no longer be serviced by the original assignee due to number portability; subscribers who switch providers can take their number with them.

When dialled within the Netherlands, the domestic trunk access code 0 must be dialled before the telephone number, extending the dialling sequence to 10 digits. If dialling from overseas, the 0 (Zero) in front of the prefix must be omitted.

Before the 1995 reorganization, area codes were restricted to towns. This was lifted and multiple towns may now share an area code. The following table lists only one town for each area code, and it includes the trunk access code (0).

==Non-geographical telephone numbers==
The non-geographic numbers do not have a prescribed fixed number of digits, but are usually kept as short as possible. Mobile telephone numbers, however, always have 10 digits, just like geographic numbers.

The non-geographical telephone number categories are, including the trunk access code:
*06: mobile telephone operators,
*0800: free service numbers,
*084, 085: used for VoIP
*087: voicemail and virtual private numbers
*088: large companies with more than one address
*0970: machine to machine communication, numbers are 8-11 digits long
*0979: machine to machine communication, numbers have no fixed length and are reserved for network internal usage
*0900: paid information services
*0906: adult lines
*0909: entertainment

Toll-free numbers (0800) can always be dialled for free, even from (public) payphones; other numbers starting with 08 are not free.

==Public resources==
The emergency number is 112. GSM mobile phones may accept different numbers, such as 999, 000 or 911, depending on the firmware. Additionally, calls to 911 are forwarded to 112 (in the Caribbean Netherlands, this is reversed - 112 redirects to 911 in that case).

Directory assistance is available from several commercial providers, on 18xx (e.g., 1888 from KPN).

==Caribbean Netherlands==

The islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, which form the Caribbean Netherlands after the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, retained the numbering plan of the Netherlands Antilles using country code +599, followed by 7, 3 or 4 for Bonaire, Sint Eustatius or Saba, respectively. Calls between the European Netherlands and Caribbean Netherlands are billed as international calls.

<text>Inverurie Loco Works Football Club are a senior semi-professional football club from Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, who currently play in the Scottish Highland Football League (SHFL).

==History==
The club was founded in 1902 by workmen from the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR) who had their Locomotive, and Carriage and Wagon Workshops in Inverurie, from where the football club got its name. On National Railway Company &#x27;Grouping&#x27; in 1923, the GNSR became part of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway, one of the UK&#x27;s big four railway companies at that time, and the football club lived on.

In the 1945-46 Aberdeenshire &amp; District Junior League, Inverurie Locos scored 146 goals in 22 games, averaging 6.64 goals per game. They won the league that season, remaining unbeaten throughout the entire league campaign.

The Locomotive Workshops themselves were formally closed in 1970 on the forming of British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL), a wholly owned subsidiary of the British Railways Board at that time. Despite the closure, Inverurie Loco Works F.C. continued to play in the Aberdeenshire and North East Junior Leagues for many years.

Rising up from successful years in junior football, in 2001 the Locos applied for membership of the Highland League and were successful. In the 2003–04 season, the Locos came second in the league, two further consecutive 2nd-place finishes followed in the seasons to come. In 2005, they first got their hands on silverware by winning the Scottish Qualifying Cup, then repeated the feat the next year. They also won the Aberdeenshire Shield after being runners up three times before winning the trophy. Then they won the Fosters Cup (League Cup) twice in two years, in 2007–08 and 2008–09. They also won the SFA North Region Challenge Cup in 2008–09.

In the 2008–09 Scottish Cup, the club were paired with Scottish Premier League side Motherwell at home. They reached the fourth round of the competition that season. After four postponements, the match was finally played at the fifth time of asking. Despite a capacity crowd watching, the Highland League outfit could not prevent a 3–0 loss to their top-flight opponents.

== Harlaw Park == 

Inverurie Loco Works have played at Harlaw Park for their entire history. Originally, it was an open field, but now it is a fully-enclosed football ground with a seated grandstand and a standing shelter.

It currently has an approximate overall capacity of 2,500; 175 seated, and the rest standing.

In March 1931, a pavilion and a grandstand was opened and in 1950 the installation of new dressing rooms was completed. Harlaw Park got new turnstiles in 1962.

In 1981, the Banchory Golf Club clubhouse was re-located to Harlaw Park as the Social Club.

Floodlights which were surplus to requirements at Aberdeen Airport were installed, and new dugouts were created in August 1983. New changing rooms were built in 1992.

In preparation for Inverurie Locos first Highland League season (2001/02) £75,000 was spent on upgrading Harlaw Park and a new enclosure was opened for the 2002/03 season.

The 2012–13 season saw the current grandstand erected, replacing the old one.

Harlaw Park hosted 3 matches in the 2014 UEFA Women&#x27;s Under-17 Championship qualification in August 2013.

<text>The National Basketball League was a professional basketball league based in Canada that lasted only one and a half seasons in 1993 and 1994. It rose from the ashes of the World Basketball League which folded after the 1992 season, which had teams in various Canadian and American cities; the new league combined several former WBL teams based in Canada and new franchises. The NBL&#x27;s first game was played on May 1, 1993 when the Cape Breton Breakers visited the Halifax Windjammers. The Breakers won the regular season championship with a 30-16 record, but they lost the championship finals to Saskatoon three games to one.

During the 1994 season there were rumours that the Cape Breton team was going to move to Saint John in mid-season, which never happened before the league folded on July 9, 1994. Halifax, which finished last in 1993, was in first place at the time the league had folded.

The league&#x27;s president was Sam Katz and the commissioner was Tom Nissalke.

<text>Lossiemouth Football Club are a senior football club from Lossiemouth, Moray, Scotland. They play in the Highland Football League.

Founded in 1945, they were admitted to the Highland League for season 1946-47 and have played in this league since that point. The club&#x27;s home stadium is Grant Park.

Traditionally a team hovering around the lower end of the league table, Lossiemouth have enjoyed several cup successes, including a period in the mid-1990s that saw the club win a hat-trick of North of Scotland Cups and a Highland League Cup over a period of three seasons as well as several top three placings in the Highland League.

Lossiemouth are full members of the Scottish Football Association, and are therefore permitted to play in the Scottish Cup.

==History==
Before Lossiemouth Football Club (1885 — 1944)

A number of early football clubs sprung up in Lossiemouth during the 1880s, the first recorded being Lossiemouth Rangers in 1885, who merged in 1888 with Lossiemouth Artillery to form Lossiemouth Artillery Rangers. Another early club, Lossiemouth Rovers (founded 1889) reached the Elginshire Junior Cup final in their first season, but lost out to Elgin Rangers Athletic in the final at Auction Mart Park in Elgin.

From the formation of the Morayshire Junior league in 1905–06, Lossiemouth were represented by a succession of Junior football clubs playing in the Morayshire Junior League in most seasons between 1905–06 and 1936–37, most notably Lossiemouth Rangers who competed from 1925–26 to 1936–37, with particular period of success in the late 1920s at that level that included back-to-back trebles of the Morayshire Junior League title, Robertson Cup and Nicholson Cup in 1927–28 and 1928–29.

However, unlike many similarly sized population centres in the North of Scotland, Lossiemouth had no senior football club during this period, although an attempt was made to form such a club in 1934 but it did not come to fruition.

Formation and Early Years (1945 — 1955)

Following the end of World War II, Lossiemouth Football Club were founded on 12 October 1945 following a public meeting in the town to form a senior football club with the intention of joining the Highland Football League, which was on hiatus at the time due to World War 2. The club was formed in time to enter the senior Nairn &amp; District Cup (also known as the Stuart Cup) for season 1945–46, which commenced in December 1945. Lossiemouth were drawn against Elgin City in the Nairn &amp; District Cup first round, the first leg of which was played at home on 29 December 1945 with Lossiemouth winning the leg 3–0. This was the first of only four competitive fixtures during the 1945–46 season, all in the Nairn &amp; District Cup.

Lossiemouth Football Club were accepted into the Highland League at the league&#x27;s AGM at the Workmen&#x27;s Club in Inverness on 22 June 1946 and began participation in the Highland League in the 1946–47 season. Lossiemouth began the 1946–47 season with a 5–2 home win over Forres Mechanics in the Highland League Cup on 10 August 1946 and made their Highland League debut two weeks later with a 4–1 away win at Fraserburgh. Lossiemouth went on to win the Nairn &amp; District Cup later that season to give the club its first trophy, a feat that was later repeated in 1948–49.

Scottish Cup run and first major trophies (1955 — 1962)

Season 1955–56 remains Lossiemouth&#x27;s best performance in the Scottish Cup with the club reaching the Fourth Round, defeating Wick Academy, Duns, and Selkirk before being defeated by Berwick Rangers at Shielfield Park.

Lossiemouth&#x27;s first major trophy came in season 1956–57 with a win over Fraserburgh in the two-legged final of the Scottish Supplementary Cup (North), which was a temporary rebranding of the Scottish Qualifying Cup (North) during the period where all SFA member clubs were allowed direct access to the Scottish Cup.

The club won the Highland League Cup for the first time in the 1961–62 season, defeating Deveronvale 2–0 in the final at Boroughbriggs in Elgin.

Decline and financial difficulties (1962 — 1985)

Lossiemouth generally struggled in the Highland League over the next few decades which culminated in a period in the early 1980s that almost saw the club fold due to financial difficulties. Between 1978–79 and 1984–85 the club finished bottom of the Highland League six times in those seven seasons.

Late 1980s resurgence and 1990s success (1985 — 1997)

Improved fortunes thereafter saw the club start to climb the league table in subsequent seasons, and also reached North of Scotland Cup finals in 1985–86, 1986–87 and 1991–92 although the club was unsuccessful on each occasion. This resurgence ultimately led to three third-place finishes in the Highland League and several cups being won in the mid-1990s, including a hat-trick of North of Scotland Cup triumphs in 1994–95, 1995–96, and 1996–97. Season 1996–97 also saw Lossiemouth win the Highland League Cup for a second time as a result of a 2–1 win over Fraserburgh at Christie Park, Huntly.

Downturn into the new millennium (1997 — present)

A period of downturn then followed from the late 1990s onwards, although the club added two more North of Scotland Cup wins in 2000–01 and 2002–03 - which remains Lossiemouth&#x27;s last trophies to date. Lossiemouth&#x27;s most recent cup final was in the 2017–18 season where they were defeated 2–0 by Brora Rangers in the North of Scotland Cup final at Clachnacuddin Park, Inverness.

==Stadium==

Lossiemouth play at Grant Park in Lossiemouth. It has a capacity of 3,250, including 250 seats.

Grant Park was opened on 4 May 1925 by Lady Grant, the wife of Sir Alexander Grant, a local philanthropist who had facilitated the purchase of the land for the town for recreational purposes, including laying out a football pitch. Lady Grant kicked off a local football match in the Lossiemouth Fishermen&#x27;s Cup competition to formally open the ground.

The ground became the home ground for Lossiemouth Rangers FC for season 1925–26, who began competing in the Morayshire Junior League.

In 1934 the town council made a series of improvements to Grant Park including fully enclosing the pitch, building up banking for spectators and surrounding the ground with corrugated iron fencing.

In 1945 it became the home ground of the newly formed Lossiemouth Football Club, and was also used by Lossiemouth United (who were formed in 1949) for some time before they moved to the Lossiemouth Playingfields.

The ground was purchased from the council by Lossiemouth Football Club in the late 1970s and the club continued to make improvements to the ground including new boardroom and changing facilities, the erection of floodlights and a covered enclosure. The original wooden grandstand was replaced by a new modern stand in 2009.

Recent success was achieved in the 2005–06 season, with an unexpected North of Scotland Cup win. Nairn County also won the North of Scotland Cup in 2012 by defeating Wick Academy 2–1. During Nairn&#x27;s Scottish Cup run in 2012, Nairn defeated Preston Athletic and Clyde, whilst in the third round were trailing 3–0 at half time against Forfar Athletic and staged a remarkable comeback with the game ending 3–3.

Striker Conor Gethins was awarded with the Highland League Player of the Year for the 2012–13 season.

The club&#x27;s record appearance holder is Glenn Main, who made 496 appearances.

<text>Wick Academy Football Club are a senior football club founded in October 1893, who currently play in the Scottish Highland Football League at Harmsworth Park. They represent the Caithness town of Wick, making them the most northerly professional football league club in the United Kingdom.

==History==

The club was known in Wick simply as Academy and sometimes in other parts of Caithness as Pulteneytown Academy. An indirect and unofficial connection with the local school of the same name was maintained with the election of a teacher, John Davidson as the first captain or &#x27;leader&#x27; as it was termed in the minute book of the first meeting. The club&#x27;s first game was a friendly away to Castletown. Home games were played at Harrow Park, now known as Harmsworth Park. Ten matches, with only two defeats, were played in that first season against teams like Dunbeath, John O&#x27;Groats (formed that same year in Wick), Lybster Portland, Thurso Thistle and Wick Thistle.

The Wick League was started in 1896, and Academy won the championship in the third season in 1898–99, the first of 17 league titles. From 1907 to 1914, Academy had virtually a clean sweep of league and local cups and in 1911, applied successfully for full membership of the SFA, so they could play in the Qualifying Cup.

Academy&#x27;s Qualifying Cup début was a home tie on 2 September 1911, and a crowd of about 800 saw a 4–0 win against Inverness Thistle. Men paid 6d, boys 3d, ladies were admitted free and gate receipts were £17. Caledonian won a 2nd round tie in Wick 4–1.

The right winger in those games was Jimmy Miller, who was later secretary and president of the club, his commitment to the club continued almost 50 years to 1954.

A Caithness County League was started in the 1926–27 season, by which time the Harmsworth family had bought the park and donated it to the town with the Burgh Council as trustees and local sports clubs formed a management committee. Only the football clubs seemed prepared to do the work of the ground improvements and building a stone wall to enclose the park. Changing rooms were built and were saved from demolition in 1973, when Academy agreed to keep them in a good state of repair. The building now houses an office and tea hut. Academy won the county league in 1927–28 and again in 1928–29, 1930–31, 1935–36 and 1937–38.

As the only SFA club in Caithness (Thurso Pentland were also members for three years from 1936), Academy was allowed to sign players from other clubs to play in Qualifying Cup games. From 1928 onwards, they were unbeaten at home in Qualifying Cup ties. In 1933, they beat Nairn County, Caley and Keith, all away, to reach the Scottish Cup proper, losing 3–0 to a strong Division Two side, St Bernard&#x27;s on 20 January 1934 at the Gymnasium Ground in Edinburgh. In 1936, Academy drew 3–3 in Wick with local rivals Brora Rangers, won the replay and two more games at Forres Mechanics and Buckie Thistle to earn a tie at Stirling. Academy scored first against King&#x27;s Park, but lost 6–1. Several prestigious friendlies were played, Aberdeen and Celtic were among the teams who appeared at Harmsworth Park in the 1930s.

Academy had also joined the North of Scotland FA in 1914, but had been unable to play their first tie away to Forres Mechanics as most of their players had been called up by the Territorials. They had to wait until 1954 to be readmitted, but made up for lost time with a 4–3 win at Brora Rangers, before losing 3–1 in the semi-final away to Caldeonian.

In 1960, the Caithness Amateur Football Association switched to summer football and to retain its SFA membership, Wick Academy had to stay with the normal winter season, playing only cup ties and friendlies for the next 12 years.

In 1972, with Clair Harper now as chairman, the club joined the North of Scotland 2nd XI Association to have regular league fixtures, drawing 2–2 at home to Dingwall Thistle in the first game. Academy were a strong team in this North Reserve League, (later to become the North Caledonian Football League) and were champions four seasons running from 1978 to 1979 to 1981–82 under manager John MacDonald, and also won several of the league cups. With former goalkeeper Pat Miller as manager, Academy won the league again in 86–7. In July 1984, Heart of Midlothian fielded a full strength first team in a friendly which attracted 2,400 fans to Harmsworth Park. 900 copies of a souvenir programme sold out five minutes before kick off. Richard Hughes scored for Academy in a 7–1 defeat.

After having several applications knocked back, Academy were at last voted into the HFL in 1994 when Caledonian and Inverness Thistle amalgamated and left to join the SFL, along with Ross County. The first game at home to Cove Rangers drew a crowd of 1,700, but ended with a 3–0 defeat. After a draw with Rothes, Academy beat the then league leaders Forres Mechanics 1–0, and after three straight wins in October, were briefly fourth in the table.

In the 2001–02 Qualifying Cup, wins over Lossiemouth and Nairn County saw Academy in the Scottish Cup proper and BBC TV cameras were at Harmsworth Park where, Threave Rovers won 3–2.

Midfielder Martin Gunn represented Scotland in the Four Nations semi-professional tournaments in May 2005 and May 2006.

In January 2007, the club appointed Richard Hughes and Ian Munro as first team joint managers after Peter Budge resigned to join the SFA as football development officer at the Highland Football Academy. Hughes and Munro have long been associated with the Caithness side. After finishing usually between 10th and 13th, Academy completed a run of ten successive league wins in the 2008–09 season to finish fifth. Co-managers Richard Hughes and Ian Munro received the league&#x27;s Manager of the Year Award, with Richard Macadie voted Player of the Year.

In the 2009–10 season, wins over Clachnacuddin and Girvan put the team in the third round of the Scottish Cup for the first time, earning a home tie with Second Division side Brechin City. Academy almost pulled off a shock, but an equaliser for Brechin five-minutes from full-time saw the game finish 4–4. Brechin won the replay at Glebe Park 4–2. Academy finished the season in ninth position and midfielder Sam Mackay was voted the Sunday Post Young Player of the year.

The 2010–11 season saw the Scorries under-achieve in the league with a disappointing 14th-place finish, but the Club reached their first senior Cup final in September 2011. Academy beat Brora Rangers and Thurso to reach the North of Scotland Cup where Wick produced a magnificent performance in beating a strong Inverness Caledonian Thistle side 3–1. This set up a final against the current cup holders Forres Mechanics. The final was played in Brora at Dudgeon Park and Academy took over 1,000 supporters over the Ord where they created a sea of black and white inside the ground. Unfortunately Academy had a poor first half and went into the break trailing by three goals to zero. A battling performance in the second half saw the score pegged back to 3–2, but as Academy pushed for an equaliser the clock ran out and Wick hearts were broken.

It was a similar story in the Scottish Cup in season 2010–11. After a first round bye, the club drew Whitehill Welfare in the second round away at Ferguson Park in Rosewell. Academy travelled as far as Perth the day before the game and woke up on the Saturday morning to the news that the game was postponed due to a water-logged pitch, so had to turn tail and head for home without a boot being dirtied. The return trip the following weekend also ended in disappointment. The sides went in at half-time with the spoils shared at a goal each, but Whitehill scored three-second half goals in a five-minute spree that put them in a commanding 4–1 lead. Academy however fought back and pulled the score back to 4–3 but again the sands of time ran out and Whitehill went on to face Montrose in the third round while Academy headed back up the A9 for another marathon trek home.

At the end of season 2010–11 co-managers Tichie Hughes and Zeeky Munro announced their resignation and the hunt began for a new manager. Former East Fife, Rangers, Hearts, Airdrieonians and Raith Rovers player Davie Kirkwood was appointed into the hot-seat. Davie who had previously worked as head of youth with Raith Rovers, Rangers and Ross County duly appointed Tichie as his assistant and Gary Manson bolstered his back-room team as a player coach.

The Harmsworth Park also had a make-over during the 2010–11 closed-season. The club are striving to apply for a SFA National Club License for the start of 2012 and work necessary to take the park up to the required standard was completed. This included the upgrade of the floodlight, creation of a medical room and a successful safety inspection and associated &quot;letter of compliance&quot; from Highland Council. In additional both stands received a freshen up with bench seating installed against the south stand back wall, boarding was erected around the park perimeter fence, new goal posts were erected and a massive amount of work was done to the playing surface to take it into tip-top condition.

As a result of all the hard work the club was one of the first Scottish Highland League sides to be awarded a SFA National Club License in February 2012. As a result of obtaining Club licensing the top two licensed SHFL Clubs were invited into the first round of the Ramsdens Cup. Wick Academy along with Inverurie Locos secured the two slots and Academy drew a home tie against Raith Rovers. The Scorries gave the 1st Division side a real fright and at 2–2 it looked as if an upset was on the cards, but unfortunately Raith went on to win the game 4–2. Wick finished 8th in the league in the 2011–12 season

Pre-season 2012 saw the club draw 3–3 with Aberdeen and 0–0 with Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

At the end of August 2012 Manager Davie Kirkwood resigned to join local rivals Brora Rangers. Richard Hughes took over as caretaker manager but the shock resignation of Kirkwood was taken in the stride of the players as they did their talking on the park. As fate would have it Academy met Kirkwood&#x27;s new team in the semi-final of the North of Scotland Cup within a few weeks of his sudden departure, and the Scorries thrashed Brora 3–0. Academy faced Nairn County in the final, which was played on 20 October 2012 but lost 2–1 with Nairn&#x27;s winner coming in the first period of extra time after the game had ended 1–1.

In the Scottish Cup Academy became the first Highland League team in over 10 years to beat Cup specialists Spartans 2–0 down at Ainslie Park, and then drew another mammoth away trip to Berwick Rangers in the second round. Academy missed a penalty in that game and with the score at 0–0 in the 90th minute and a re-play on the cards Berwick were awarded a penalty of their own which they converted to win the game 1–0.

Barry Wilson was announced as the new manager on 14 October 2012 with caretaker manager Richard Hughes staying on as his assistant. Barry Wilson&#x27;s first game in charge was a 5–1 demolition of Keith which took his new side to the top of the Highland League.

In November 2012 a new sponsorship deal was announced with Scotty Youngson of PHD\Barga Ltd. Scotty owns the Comm Bar in Thurso which will be used by the club as the main sponsorship logo until the end of season 2014–15. As well as the Comm Bar in Thurso Scotty also owns the Central Bar and Hotel, Top Joe&#x27;s and Caffe Cardosi.

Academy ended the 2012–13 season with a 4–1 win over visitors Deveronvale and finished in third spot in the table, the highest league finish achieved to date for the club. Other records also tumbled as the Scorries went the whole of season 2012–13 with a 100% home league win record (17 wins from 17 games), and extended their unbeaten home league run to 29 games. Fraserburgh being the last team to win a league game at the Harmsworth Park back in October 2011. 2012–13 also saw the Scorries score over 100 league goals in a single season, and keep the most number of clean sheets – 12 in total. Their best previous clean sheet total in a single season was six.

Barry Wilson left the Club in January 2014 to take up the Managers post at Elgin City following the departure of Ross Jack. Gordon Connelly was appointed as the new Manager with Richard Hughes staying as his Assistant Manager. At the same time Wick Academy also appointed Ross Suttar as the Club Development Officer and first team coach.

At the beginning of the 2014–15 Highland League season, Wick Academy introduced new club mascot &#x27;Norrie The Scorrie&#x27; to Harmsworth Park. The Club reached the semi-final of the North of Scotland Cup where they were beaten 2–1 at Harmsworth Park by local rivals Brora Rangers in an evenly contested game. 
There was disappointment, however, in the Scottish Cup as Wick were dumped out of the competition in the first round away at Huntly. In the Highland League Cup Academy beat Fraserburgh, Clachnacuddin and Nairn County to reach the final. That was played at Grant Street Park Inverness in front of over 1,000 Scorrie supporters but Academy disappointingly lost 4–0 to Cove Rangers.
League form for season 2014–15 was excellent and Academy finished the season in 4th place. In the process the team racked up a record 12 away wins and broke our record of unbeaten league games with an impressive run of 14 matches (13 wins and a draw). Our defence was pretty solid and only conceded 43 goals in 34 league games, a ratio of 1.26 goals against per game. &#x27;Between the sticks&#x27;, Academy also managed 13 clean sheets – a club record.

2015–16 was arguably one of Academy&#x27;s best seasons when in November 2015 the club won its first piece of silverware since joining the SHFL defeating Nairn County 6–2 in the final of the Menzies Distribution North of Scotland Cup. The club also got to the 3rd round of the Scottish Cup. All three games went to replays with Academy beating Whitehill Welfare and Nairn County before being knocked out by Linlithgow Rose. League form was also good and a 5th-place finish was secured following a great run-in finishing with a fantastic 4–0 win against Fraserburgh down in Bellslea in the last game of the season.

In 2016 Academy beat Dalbeattie Star and then Whitehill Welfare to reach the 3rd round of the Scottish Cup. Unfortunately, they lost 2–0 to Stirling Albion at Forthbank Stadium, thus ending the Cup run for another year.

2017–18 was a somewhat disappointing season for Academy. A poor start to the League campaign was compounded with a first-round penalty shoot-out defeat in the North of Scotland Cup at the hands of Invergordon. Gordon Connelly stood down as Manager in August 2017 and he was replaced by Tom McKenna. &quot;The Scorries&quot; bowed out of the Scottish Cup in the first-round. They drew 2–2 with the University of Stirling in the first round at Harmsworth Park, but lost 1–0 in the replay at Falkirk Stadium. A first-round exit in the Highland League Cup followed as Nairn Country ran out comprehensive 4–0 winners at Harmsworth Park. League form did however pick up including a run of 16 games with only one defeat. Wick finished the season with a League position of 12th.

<doc id="880454" wikidata="Q2558606" url="?curid=880454" title="Whānau">
<text>Whānau () is the Māori language word for the basic extended family group. Within Māori society the whānau encompasses three or four generations and forms the political unit below the levels of hapū (subtribe), iwi (tribe or nation) and waka (migration canoe). These steps are emphasised in Māori genealogy as a person&#x27;s whakapapa.

==Early Māori society==
In pre-contact Māori tribal organisation the whānau historically comprised a family spanning three to four generations, and would number around 20 to 30 people. It formed the smallest partition of the Māori society.

The kaumātua (tribal elders), senior adults () such as parents, uncles and aunts, and the sons and daughters together with their partners and children. Large whānau lived in their own compound in the pā. Whānau also had their own gardening plots and their own fishing and hunting spots. The whānau was economically self-sufficient. In warfare, it supported and was necessarily supported by the iwi (tribe) or hapū (sub-tribe).

The whānau would look after children and grandchildren collectively, so the loss of a parent was less likely to be devastating to a child&#x27;s upbringing. In the case of orphaned children, the child would be taken in by the process of whāngai adoption. This form of adoption is still practised and has some legal codification in New Zealand.

==Contemporary conceptions==
Contemporary conceptions offer whānau in one of two ways:
# An &quot;object or construction based on descent, cause or a mix of the two&quot;; or
# &quot;A collection of ideas&quot;.

As a descent construct, has been variably described as &#x27;extended family&#x27;, &#x27;extended family or community&#x27;, or simply &#x27;family&#x27;.

<doc id="880462" wikidata="Q1511867" url="?curid=880462" title="Coat of arms of the Northwest Territories">
<text>The coat of arms of the Northwest Territories was granted by a Royal Warrant of Queen Elizabeth II on 24 February 1956. The shield is featured on the territorial flag. The coat of arms was designed by Canadian heraldry expert Alan Beddoe in the early 1950s.

==Symbolism==
The crest consists of two gold narwhals guarding a compass rose, symbolic of the magnetic North Pole. The white upper third of the shield represents the polar ice pack and is crossed by a wavy blue line symbolizing the Northwest Passage. The diagonal line separating the red and green segments of the lower portion of the shield reflects the tree line. The green symbolizes the forested areas south of the tree line, while the red represents the tundra to the north. Minerals and fur, the important bases of the northern wealth, are represented by gold billets in the green portion and the mask of the white fox in the red.

<doc id="880468" wikidata="Q532698" url="?curid=880468" title="Mount Sipylus">
<text>Mount Spil (), the ancient Mount Sipylus () (elevation ), is a mountain rich in legends and history in Manisa Province, Turkey, in what used to be the heartland of the Lydians and what is now Turkey&#x27;s Aegean Region.

Its summit towers over the modern city of Manisa as well as over the road between İzmir and Manisa. The contiguous mass of Mount Yamanlar, also overlooking the Gulf of İzmir, has often been considered an extension of the Mount Sipylus massif, with which it shares much history, although it is actually an extinct volcano and a distinct geographical formation.

==History==
The Manisa relief, a full-faced statue carved into a cliff face, is found near Mount Sipylus, several kilometers east of Manisa. According to the Byzantine commentator John the Lydian, the unknown author of the 7th-century BCE epic poem, the &quot;Titanomachy&quot;, placed the birth of Zeus not in Crete but in Lydia, which should signify Mount Sipylus.

The names &quot;Sipylus&quot; or &quot;Sipylum&quot; are mentioned by Pliny the Elder, supported by other sources, as the site of a very celebrated city called &quot;Tantalis&quot; or &quot;the city of Tantalus&quot;, after the name of its founder. Presumably located on or very near the mountain, the city&#x27;s ruins were reportedly still visible around the beginning of the Common Era.

The same Tantalus is famed throughout Greek mythology thanks to the accounts that he had cut up his son Pelops and served him up as food for the gods. His son Pelops is said to have later migrated to the Peloponnese, named after him, and to have founded a kingdom there. Tantalus&#x27; daughter was the tragic Niobe, who is associated with the &quot;Weeping Rock&quot; (&quot;Ağlayan Kaya&quot; in Turkish), a natural formation facing the city of Manisa. The Greek deities Apollo and Artemis were said to have killed all 14 children of Niobe at Mount Sipylus, whereupon the grief-stricken Niobe was turned to stone.

Later in ancient times, Mount Sipylus () rose above the site of Magnesia ad Sipylum (the southern portion of modern Manisa), whose existence is traced back as far as the 5th century BCE. Magnesia was located along the Hermus River (Gediz River) on the plain below and was the scene of the defeat of Antiochus III &quot;the Great&quot; by the Romans at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BCE. The city of Smyrna lay nearby.

==Spil today==
An important reforestation effort was begun in the 1960s, covering thousands of hectares on and around the mountain. Since then, Spil Dağı National Park has attracted many foreign and domestic tourists. The famous &quot;Weeping Rock&quot; is still widely visited.

The mountain as a whole presents an area of dense forests and is known for its wild tulips. The mountain is also a common spot for camping, parachuting, hiking and other mountain sports.

The motorway connecting the two regional metropolitan centers, İzmir and Manisa, crosses between the two neighboring masses of Mount Sipylus and Mount Yamanlar through the Sabuncubeli Pass, which was much described by ancient travellers and writers and which descends from an altitude of 600 m to sea-level in only a few kilometers. The highest point of the pass corresponds to a point near the boundary between İzmir Province and Manisa Province. To bypass the steep and twisted Sabuncubeli Pass, the -long Sabuncubeli Tunnel was built from 2011 to 2018.

<text>The Hyper Neo Geo 64 is an arcade system board created by SNK, and released in September 1997. As the successor of the popular Neo Geo (MVS), it was the first and only SNK hardware set capable of rendering in 3D, conceived to bring SNK into the 3D era that had arisen during the mid-1990s.

The system never managed to match the huge success of the 16-bit Neo Geo. Only seven games were produced, none of which proved particularly popular, and only one of them, &quot;Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition&quot;, has been ported to home systems. A home console version was rumored to be in development but was never confirmed by SNK.

==History==
The system was first announced in late 1995, and planned for release in late 1996. It was officially unveiled at the February 1997 AOU show, though all that was demonstrated at the show was a videotape containing a few seconds of footage of &quot;Samurai Shodown 64&quot;, which SNK announced would be the first game for the system. By mid-1997 test units were on display in Japan.

The system was released, only in arcade form, in September 1997, featuring a custom 64-bit RISC processor, 4 megabytes of program memory, 64 megabytes of 3D and texture memory, and 128 megabytes of memory for 2D characters and backgrounds. The first title released for the system was &quot;Road&#x27;s Edge&quot;, with &quot;Samurai Shodown 64&quot; following soon after. Neither was particularly well received. The system was a failure and by 1999 was discontinued, with only seven games released in total. SNK resumed releasing games on their older Neo Geo system.

Reportedly, SNK had been working on a successor hardware. This was reported in 2021 and dubbed &quot;SNK Millennium&quot;.

<text>Charles Benjamin Dudley (July 14, 1842 – December 21, 1909) was an American chemist who was an early proponent of standardisation in industry.

Dudley was born in Oxford, New York, and owing to family circumstances, had to wait until 1867 before he could enter Yale College, supporting himself as a night editor on the &quot;New Haven Palladium&quot; newspaper. After graduating with a B.A. degree in 1871, he eventually earned a Ph.D. from the Sheffield Scientific School in 1874.

In 1875, he became a chemist for the Pennsylvania Railroad and started to investigate the chemical composition and metallurgical structure of rail tracks, breakage being a major hazard at that time. He discovered enormous variation in the properties and quality of steel and the 1878 publication of his results caused an uproar in the steel industry, who saw it as their sole domain to determine the quality of their products for sale. Dudley championed the development of the company and industry standards and demanded rigorous testing of materials to verify conformity. He developed a complete range of standards for the Pennsylvania Railroad, not only for steel, but also for fuels, lubricants, paints, and even locomotives.

In 1879, Dudley was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

In 1882, he was made a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In 1896 and 1897, Dudley served as president of the American Chemical Society.

In 1898, he was one of the founders of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), becoming president from 1902 to 1908.

He died in Altoona, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="880481" wikidata="Q7342735" url="?curid=880481" title="Robert Cantwell">
<text>Robert Emmett Cantwell (January 31, 1908 – December 8, 1978), known as Robert Cantwell, was a novelist and critic. His first novel, &quot;Laugh and Lie Down&quot; (1931) is an early example, twenty years before Jack Kerouac, of the American classic genre the &quot;road novel&quot;, and also an important example of the &quot;Depression novel&quot; period genre. His most notable work, &quot;The Land of Plenty&quot;, focuses on a lumber mill in a thinly disguised version of his hometown in Washington state.

==Background==
Robert Emmet Cantwell was born on January 31, 1908, in Little Falls (now Vader), Washington. His parents were Charles James Cantwell, an engineer, and Nina Adelia Hanson. He had an older sibling James Leroy and younger siblings Frances Dorothy and Charles Harry. He attended the University of Washington (1924−1925) and then spent the next four years working at Harbor Plywood Co., (1925−1929) in Hoquiam, Washington.

In 1919, the massacre during a strike in nearby Centralia, Washington, deeply disturbed him and left a lasting impression that appeared in his major writings.

==Career==

In 1929, after selling a short story &quot;Hanging by My Thumbs&quot; to &quot;The New American Caravan&quot;, he moved (with help from childhood friend Calvin Fixx) to New York City, landed a book contract with Farrar and Rinehart, and began work on his first novel, &quot;Laugh and Lie Down&quot; (1931). From 1930 to 1935 (and during the Great Depression), he wrote a second novel, &quot;The Land of Plenty&quot; (1934). He published a number of short stories in &quot;The Miscellany&quot;, &quot;American Caravan&quot;, &quot;Pagany&quot;, and &quot;The New Republic&quot;. In December 1933, he accepted work already passed over by Whittaker Chambers, namely to co-write a biography of Boston&#x27;s E. A. Filene, in collaboration with Lincoln Steffens. The same month, Steffens suffered a heart-attack and died in 1936; Cantwell handed the manuscript to Filene in 1937.

Throughout the 1930s, Cantwell began to meet New York writers and editors such as Edmund Wilson, Malcolm Cowley, John Chamberlain, Erskine Caldwell, Matthew Josephson, and Harry Hansen. Over time, his circle expanded to include James T. Farrell, Meyer Schapiro, John Dos Passos, Newton Arvin, Kenneth Burke, Granville Hicks, Kenneth Fearing, Fred Dupee, Elof Holmlund, and Whittaker Chambers.

In the 1930s, &quot;After he settled in New York, Cantwell was always short of money and therefore generally in a rush to finish a piece and get paid... All the more remarkable, then, that his short stories are of such a generally high aesthetic quality.&quot;

Meantime, to support himself while writing, Cantwell took on regular-paying jobs. From November 1932 until its close in 1935, he worked as literary editor of &quot;New Outlook&quot; magazine. He also wrote for the &quot;New Masses&quot; under pen name &quot;Robert Simmons.&quot; At some point between 1933 and 1936, he worked as assistant literary editor at &quot;The New Republic&quot; under Malcolm Cowley, who was literary editor, according to Mary McCarthy in her 1992 posthumous &quot;Intellectual Memoirs: New York, 1936–1938&quot;; McCarthy also remembers him in the mid-1930s as &quot;a Communist, a real member.&quot;

===&quot;Time&quot; magazine===

On April 23, 1935 and through 1936, Cantwell joined the editorial staff of &quot;Time&quot; as book reviewer. In 1937, he joined &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s sister magazine, &quot;Fortune&quot;. In 1938, he returned to &quot;Time&quot; as associate editor (1938−1945). In 1939, he helped his friend Chambers get his old job as book reviewer. In 1940, William Saroyan lists Cantwell among &quot;associate editors&quot; at &quot;Time&quot; in Saroyan&#x27;s play, &quot;Love&#x27;s Old Sweet Song&quot;.

In 1941, Cantwell suffered a nervous breakdown. He took off work and received treatment at the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum. He spent three years researching and writing the biography, &quot;Nathaniel Hawthorne: The American Years&quot; (1948).

From 1949 to 1954 he worked as the literary editor of &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

===&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine===

In 1954, he took up freelancing again until 1956 when he began an association with &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

He worked for the magazine from 1956 until his death in 1978. He worked on a number of articles, three of which became books: &quot;Alexander Wilson: Naturalist and Pioneer&quot; (1961), &quot;The Real McCoy&quot; (1971), and &quot;The Hidden Northwest&quot; (1972). Subjects of his articles include chess, ornithology, sports in the movies and literary figures in sports.

==Personal life and death==

Cantwell married Mary Elizabeth Chambers, known as Betsy, a teacher, on February 2, 1931: she (no relation to Whittaker Chambers) was a cousin of Lyle Saxon, whom Fixx had been serving as secretary. They had three children: Joan McNiece (Mrs. George Stolz, Jr.), Betsy Ann (Mrs. Walter Pusey III), and Mary Elizabeth Emmett (Mrs. Lars-Erik Nelson).

He later married Allison Joy, a noted portrait painter, and, briefly, Eva Stolz Gilleran shortly before his death in 1978.

Cantwell was rumored to have been the inspiration for many of the scenes in the Eric Hodgins novel Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. While working together at Fortune, Cantwell had encouraged Hogkins to purchase a property not far from his own house in Sherman, Connecticut, and Cantwell&#x27;s two daughters at the time had the same names as the two daughters in the novel: Betsy and Joan.

During the Hiss Case, the FBI often lurked around Cantwell&#x27;s home in Sherman and questioned neighbors.

Cantwell dismissed his radical affiliations of youth obliquely in later life, saying &quot;I had no interest in politics&quot; and no (public) political aspirations. Nevertheless, his circle in the 1930s was a strong Leftist one that included Schapiro (Marxist), Cowley (Communist Party fellow traveller), Holmlund and Calvin Fixx (Communist Party members), and Chambers (Soviet spy). Further, his correspondence shows a strong interest, for example, in the CPUSA ticket for 1932 elections, which included William Z. Foster for president and James W. Ford for vice president. He also joined the League of Professional Writers for Foster and Ford. (Cantwell noted that he voted for Roosevelt so he would not &quot;throw away&quot; his vote.) Also in the fall of 1932, he traveled to Washington, DC, with Cowley to cover the National Hunger March for &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Biographer Per Seyersted concluded, &quot;That Cantwell did not use correct Marxist terminology would seem to indicate that he was no CP member, that however to the left he was and in sympathy with the Party&#x27;s aims, he was an independent person doing his own thinking.&quot; This reflected his background in West Coast populist-progressive-anarchist political culture, something quite different from New York City European-oriented doctrinaire Marxism—the Grange, the Progressive Party, the Wobblies, rather than the regimen of Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist party discipline. The Centralia strikers were Wobblies.

He died in 1978, aged 70, in St. Luke&#x27;s hospital in New York City, after suffering a heart attack two weeks earlier.

In his obituary, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote: Bob Cantwell was with us during the last 22 years of his life, in which he wrote dozens of memorable articles, among them a portrayal of Cecil Smith, the Texas cowboy who became perhaps the greatest polo player the world has ever seen. When Cantwell wrote of Banjo Paterson, the virtually unknown author of Waltzing Matilda, he made sure that a colorful footnote to history was not going to be lost, at least not to SI readers. As he once said, &quot;History is a natural resource, just as much as fossil fuel. It&#x27;s what is there. We should not ignore it.&quot;

Bob Cantwell was a unique intellectual resource and a friend. We shall miss him. Cantwell&#x27;s correspondence includes: James T. Farrell, John Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, Van Wyck Brooks, Erskine Caldwell, Malcolm Cowley, Henry Luce, Clare Boothe Luce, Marianne Moore, T. S. Matthews, and Edmund Wilson.

Other members of his family are of note: his great-grandfather was Michael Troutman Simmons, known for establishing the first permanent settlement in what is now Tacoma, Washington, and his nephew, Colin Cantwell, is known for, among other things, designing the Death Star in &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

==Impact==

===Literature===

 Ernest Hemingway considered Cantwell &quot;his best bet&quot; in American fiction.

F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote of Cantwell&#x27;s first short story, &quot;Hanging by My Thumbs&quot;: &quot;Mark it well, for my guess is that he&#x27;s learned a better lesson from Proust than Thornton Wilder did and has a destiny of no mean star.&quot;

T. S. Matthews wrote, &quot;Before I met him, I knew that he was reported to be the best book reviewer in New York; after only three book reviews, everybody admitted it.&quot;

===&quot;Time&quot; magazine===

Cantwell, his close colleagues, and many staff members as of the 1930s helped elevate &quot;Time&quot;–&quot;interstitial intellectuals,&quot; as historian Robert Vanderlan has called them. Colleague John Hersey described them as follows: &quot;Time&quot; was in an interesting phase; an editor named Tom Matthews had gathered a brilliant group of writers, including James Agee, Robert Fitzgerald, Whittaker Chambers, Robert Cantwell, Louis Kronenberger, and Calvin Fixx... They were dazzling. Time&#x27;s style was still very hokey—“backward ran sentences till reeled the mind”—but I could tell, even as a neophyte, who had written each of the pieces in the magazine, because each of these writers had such a distinctive voice.

===Hiss Case===

 In October 1931, Cantwell attended a dinner party in honor of his first novel, &quot;Laugh and Lie Down&quot;, where he met Whittaker Chambers, friend Mike Intrator, and Intrator&#x27;s wife Grace Lumpkin. At the time, Chambers had become an editor at the &quot;New Masses&quot; magazine; he and Cantwell became &quot;very close friends.&quot; Soon after meeting, Cantwell joined the John Reed Club.

When Chambers went into the Soviet underground in mid-1932, Cantwell knew; he declined to let Chambers use his home as a letter drop. In April 1934, Cantwell met Chambers&#x27; underground comrade, John Loomis Sherman, whom he knew as &quot;Phillips.&quot; For the rest of his life, Cantwell would remain unclear about just how much he knew about or was involved in Chambers&#x27; underground activities. In May 1934, when Chambers started working with the Ware Group (according to Cantwell&#x27;s papers), Cantwell accompanied him; about this time, Chambers let Cantwell know that he was using the alias &quot;Lloyd Cantwell&quot; in Baltimore. Biographer Seyersted notes that in his 1952 memoir &quot;Witness&quot;, Chambers may have changed dates for his first meetings in Washington for the Ware Group to June and later in order to protect Cantwell.

Cantwell helped get Whittaker Chambers a job at &quot;Time&quot; magazine, as Chambers recounted in his memoirs: The morning mail brought a letter from my friend, Robert Cantwell, the author of &quot;Laugh and Lie Down&quot;, and later, the biographer of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Cantwell was then one of the editors of &quot;Time&quot; magazine... But his letter... urged me to go to New York at once. As sometimes happens at &quot;Time&quot;, several jobs were suddenly open. Cantwell thought that I might get one of them... Cantwell thought I should try for a book reviewer&#x27;s job. I wrote several trial reviews. A few days later, &quot;Time&quot; hired me. Chambers had used the alias &quot;Lloyd Cantwell&quot; during his time in the Soviet underground, including the formation of the American Feature Writers Syndicate with comrade John Loomis Sherman (using the alias Charles Francis Chase) and literary agent Maxim Lieber. During the Hiss Case, Cantwell&#x27;s name came up, and he found himself under FBI surveillance. When Chambers published his memoirs, Cantwell wrote a negative review.

Cantwell&#x27;s mental breakdown in 1941 plus Chambers&#x27; use of his surname in the 1930s may well have led the Hiss defense team to conflate the two Cantwells and thus question Chambers&#x27; own sanity. (&quot;Is he a man of sanity?&quot; Hiss publicly questioned as early as August 25, 1948.)

In later years, Cantwell would express skepticism that Chambers even was in the underground; at others, he would express great fear of Soviet retribution (for Chambers&#x27; defection–and Cantwell&#x27;s role in it?).

<text>In number theory, a self number or Devlali number in a given number base formula_1 is a natural number that cannot be written as the sum of any other natural number formula_2 and the individual digits of formula_2. 20 is a self number (in base 10), because no such combination can be found (all formula_4 give a result less than 20; all other formula_2 give a result greater than 20). 21 is not, because it can be written as 15 + 1 + 5 using &quot;n&quot; = 15. These numbers were first described in 1949 by the Indian mathematician D. R. Kaprekar.

==Definition and properties==
Let formula_2 be a natural number. We define the formula_1-self function for base formula_8 formula_9 to be the following:
:formula_10
where formula_11 is the number of digits in the number in base formula_1, and 
:formula_13
is the value of each digit of the number. A natural number formula_2 is a formula_1-self number if the preimage of formula_2 for formula_17 is the empty set.

In general, for even bases, all odd numbers below the base number are self numbers, since any number below such an odd number would have to also be a 1-digit number which when added to its digit would result in an even number. For odd bases, all odd numbers are self numbers.

The set of self numbers in a given base formula_1 is infinite and has a positive asymptotic density: when formula_1 is odd, this density is 1/2.

== Self numbers in specific bases ==
For base 2 self numbers, see . (written in base 10)

The first few base 10 self numbers are:
: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 20, 31, 42, 53, 64, 75, 86, 97, 108, 110, 121, 132, 143, 154, 165, 176, 187, 198, 209, 211, 222, 233, 244, 255, 266, 277, 288, 299, 310, 312, 323, 334, 345, 356, 367, 378, 389, 400, 411, 413, 424, 435, 446, 457, 468, 479, 490, ... 

== Self primes ==

A self prime is a self number that is prime. 

The first few self primes in base 10 are
:3, 5, 7, 31, 53, 97, 211, 233, 277, 367, 389, 457, 479, 547, 569, 613, 659, 727, 839, 883, 929, 1021, 1087, 1109, 1223, 1289, 1447, 1559, 1627, 1693, 1783, 1873, ...

<text>Frances the Mute is the second studio album by American progressive rock band The Mars Volta released in February 2005 on Gold Standard Laboratories and Universal. Produced by guitarist and songwriter Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, the album incorporates dub, ambient, Latin and jazz influences, and is the first to feature bassist Juan Alderete and percussionist Marcel Rodriguez-Lopez. The album also includes contributions from future saxophonist Adrián Terrazas-González, who joined the band during its subsequent tour.

&quot;Frances the Mute&quot; made multiple &quot;Best of&quot; lists at the end of 2005. In the &quot;Q&quot; &amp; &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine Classic Special Edition &quot;Pink Floyd &amp; The Story of Prog Rock&quot;, the album came #18 in its list of &quot;40 Cosmic Rock Albums&quot; and was also named as one of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine&#x27;s 10 essential progressive rock albums of the decade.

==Background==
Jeremy Ward, audio artist for The Mars Volta until his death, had previously worked as a repo man. One day, Ward discovered a diary in the backseat of a car he was repossessing, and began to note the similarities between his life and that of the author—most notably, that they had both been adopted. The diary told of the author&#x27;s search for his biological parents, with the way being pointed by a collection of people, their names being the basis for each named track of &quot;Frances the Mute&quot;.

==Writing and recording process==
Some of the material which would end up on &quot;Frances the Mute&quot;, including &quot;The Widow&quot; and &quot;Miranda That Ghost Just Isn&#x27;t Holy Anymore&quot;, pre-dated &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot;, having been originally demoed by Omar Rodríguez-López in the early days of The Mars Volta. While touring in support of &quot;De-Loused&quot;, the band would incorporate more and more extended improvisational sections into some of their songs, often trying out new ideas. Parts of &quot;Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus&quot; (&quot;Facilis Descenus Averni&quot; and &quot;Con Safo&quot;) were first performed live in the middle of &quot;Drunkship of Lanterns&quot; (as heard on &quot;Live&quot; EP) and &quot;Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt&quot; respectively, while parts of &quot;Cassandra Gemini&quot; originated from improvisations during &quot;Cicatriz ESP&quot; (as heard on &quot;Scabdates&quot;). The album was initially to be titled &quot;Sarcophagus&quot;.

Rodríguez-López arranged and produced the recording sessions himself. Unlike &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot;, which was recorded in producer Rick Rubin&#x27;s mansion, sessions for the new album took place in multiple studios, with most tracking done in what Rodríguez-López described as &quot;a shithole… Basically a warehouse with one little air conditioner on its last legs, awful wiring and a console you couldn’t rely on&quot;. Rather than bring his ideas to the band as a whole and working them out at group rehearsals, he met individually with each player to practice each part one-on-one. &quot;We&#x27;ll sit there and play it forever and slow—real slow—to understand what&#x27;s happening. It&#x27;s easy to play something fast and loud, but to play it soft and slow takes a certain amount of discipline. Then once we understand the part, everyone&#x27;s free to elaborate—their personalities come out and it&#x27;s not my part anymore; they get into and give it that swing that I can&#x27;t give it.&quot;
Rodríguez-López took the additional step of recording the band member separately before layering the various tracks to create each song. Drummer Jon Theodore was the first to record his parts, and he spent time arranging and mapping out the songs with Omar and in the process figuring out what the rhythmic structures would be stated on the recording process. &quot;This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been so methodical about recording. Normally I would go into the situation with as good an idea as I could, whether that was from performing the songs on tour or having a general road map. But this was the first instance where I considered every single hit all the way through, every figure up to and including every change. There were no question marks. So when I was tracking with the metronome it was just a question of right or wrong.&quot; An exception of such recording method was the middle section of &quot;Cassandra Gemini&quot;, edited from a lengthy jam session.

Tracking this way had a mixed reception in the band; Theodore and bassist Juan Alderete responded well to the individualistic approach while keyboard player Isaiah &quot;Ikey&quot; Owens didn&#x27;t like it at all. However, as Rodríguez-López stated, &quot;People filling in ideas can become tedious and counterproductive. You find yourself working backwards. When you&#x27;re in the studio &#x27;what ifs&#x27; are your biggest enemy, so my general rule is, if it&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t live with—if a sentence begins with &#x27;I can&#x27;t&#x27; or &#x27;I will not&#x27;—then we examine it. But if it&#x27;s &#x27;maybe we should&#x27; or &#x27;I think that&#x27; then it&#x27;s like, hey man, full steam ahead. Not that there isn&#x27;t a lot of refinement to what we do—obviously there is— but I consider it a balance of raw energy and refinement.&quot;

&quot;Frances the Mute&quot; featured the largest array of guest musicians on any Mars Volta album to date. Flea, who played bass on &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot;, this time contributed trumpet to &quot;The Widow&quot; and &quot;Miranda...&quot;. &quot;L&#x27;Via L&#x27;Viaquez&quot; featured guitar solos from John Frusciante as well as piano solos by Omar&#x27;s childhood hero, salsa pianist Larry Harlow. Rodríguez-López described the session with Harlow in Puerto Rico as &quot;a childhood dream come true&quot;. &quot;Cassandra Gemini&quot; featured flute and saxophone contributions from Mexican woodwind player Adrián Terrazas-González, who would join the band full time for the subsequent tour. All the tracks also included full string and horn sections, arranged by David Campbell with the help of Rodríguez-López. According to Cedric Bixler-Zavala, while recording a section in &quot;Cassandra Gemini&quot; one of the orchestra members played so hard that he broke his antique bow: &quot;And you could see his ‘classical’ side come out – like, ‘I broke this playing a fuckin’ rock song??’ He was pissed off. But I was like, ‘Fuck yeah, man, that’s on the record! You’ve got to realise things like that are cool.’”

In 2012, Juan Alderete noted that &quot;Frances the Mute&quot; is the studio album he is most proud of.

===Sound and lyrics===
&quot;Frances the Mute&quot; is comparable to The Mars Volta&#x27;s 2003 release &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot;, with its cryptic lyrics and highly layered instrumentals, although the progressive rock influence is stronger on &quot;Frances the Mute&quot; than it was on &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot;. &quot;The Widow&quot; is notably the only short, pop-structured song on the album, although the last half of it features a lengthy, non-radio-friendly outro of manipulated tape loops of organs and electronic noise; for the single release, this part was edited out. Ambient noise plays a larger role on &quot;Frances the Mute&quot; than it does on &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot;: &quot;Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus&quot; ends with the recording of children&#x27;s voices and passing cars (made by Omar Rodriguez-Lopez in front of the house where he used to live with Bixler-Zavala and Ward), while the first movement of &quot;Miranda That Ghost Just Isn&#x27;t Holy Anymore&quot; (&quot;Vade Mecum&quot;) features 4 minutes of coquí frogs (credited as &quot;The Coquí of Puerto Rico&quot; on the album sleeve) singing while a thick soundscape is slowly built from guitars, synthesizers and Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s voice.

According to Rodriguez-Lopez, &quot;Miranda...&quot; was influenced by the music from western movies: &quot;I&#x27;m a big fan of spaghetti-western and I think it shows on &quot;Miranda&quot;. Our Morricone-influence has always been there, but on &quot;Miranda&quot; we let it all out. The last song [&quot;Non-Zero Possibility&quot;] on the last At the Drive-In album, the best thing we ever did by the way, had touches of spaghetti-western.&quot;

The fifth and final song of the album, &quot;Cassandra Gemini&quot;, clocking at 32 minutes and 32 seconds is to date the longest studio song released by The Mars Volta. Rodriguez-Lopez said of the song: &quot;Ever since I was a teenager, and had various listening experiences with the likes of King Crimson, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, I&#x27;ve always wanted to do something like &quot;Cassandra&quot;. Something deformed and out of control. Something enormous and violent, a whole album fitted into one composition. Something ruthless that no one can remain careless to.&quot;

Regarding the album&#x27;s lyrical content, vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala stated:

==Release history==
In December 2004, a full copy of &quot;Frances the Mute&quot; was leaked to the Internet from the vinyl version. The rip was of poor quality. Encoded as a 96 kbit/s MP3, other versions were reencoded to 192 kbit/s WMA from the source mp3, resulting in even worse audio quality. Gold Standard Laboratories issued a statement decrying the Internet release for its subpar sound quality, and suggesting that fans should respect the band&#x27;s request not to share the leaked music.

&quot;Frances the Mute&quot; was released on February 11, 2005 in Japan and February 21, 2005 in Europe; the US release followed on midnight, March 1, 2005. The Japanese version included a bonus DVD with three videos from the band&#x27;s live performance at the Electric Ballroom, London in 2003 as well as an audio of non-album track &quot;Frances the Mute&quot;. Gold Standard Laboratories issued two vinyl versions of the album, a standard 3-LP set on black vinyl, and a limited-edition 4-LP set printed on glow-in-the-dark vinyl and packaged in a red plastic case; the fourth disc was a bonus 12&quot; featuring &quot;Frances the Mute&quot; and a live acoustic version of &quot;The Widow&quot;, recorded at The Wiltern, Los Angeles on May 6, 2004. A CD single featuring the same two tracks was given free with the purchase of the album at Best Buy stores in the US.

&quot;Frances the Mute&quot; sold over 100,000 copies within the first week of release, and debuted at number four on the Billboard Album Charts. As of February 2007 according to Nielsen SoundScan, 488,000 copies were sold in the United States. The album was the band&#x27;s career best at No. 4 until their fourth album &quot;The Bedlam in Goliath&quot; came out almost 3 years later on the Billboard 200 at No. 3. The album was certified gold by the RIAA in the US for shipments of 500,000 albums on October 5, 2009.

In 2008, the edited version of &quot;L&#x27;Via L&#x27;Viaquez&quot; was featured on the video game &quot;Guitar Hero: World Tour&quot;.

==Reception==

The album so far has a score of 75 out of 100 from Metacritic based on &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. &quot;The Aquarian Weekly&quot; gave it an A and called it &quot;a very heavyweight fight for a listener to get through&quot;. Punknews.org gave it all five stars and said, &quot;Leave the hating to the real playa hatas, like Buc Nasty and Silky Johnson, because &quot;Frances The Mute&quot; will blow your mind. So give up your qualms about how pretentious this is, and how overindulgent, because given the chance, you&#x27;re in for a hell of a ride.&quot; &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; gave it a perfect score of ten and called it &quot;a compulsory purchase.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; gave it an A− and said it &quot;explores an explosive groove &quot;Comatorium&quot; only implied.&quot; &quot;Kludge&quot; gave it a score of ten out of ten and called it a &quot;multi-layered album that can be enjoyed through multiple artistic perspectives&quot; which &quot;works beautifully&quot;. Playlouder gave it four-and-a-half stars out of five and said, &quot;Miraculously the lyrics never &quot;sound&quot; like the pompous shite they undoubtedly are. They fit the music and make the whole picture even more laughably and absurdly brilliant.&quot; In 2005, the album was ranked number 440 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

&quot;Blender&quot; gave it four stars out of five and called it &quot;a visceral, powerful muso&#x27;s record, a nerve-jangling explosion in a drum clinic.&quot; &quot;Paste&quot; also gave it four stars out of five and said it &quot;bursts at the jewel-case hinges with &quot;Comatorium&quot;&#x27;s trademarks: musical inventiveness and wildly emotive vocals.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; gave it a score of seven out of ten and said, &quot;Within this impressive, ambitious, often stupid whole, are moments of melting human beauty.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; gave it a positive review and said the album &quot;unfolds upon multiple listens, sometimes threatening to collapse under its own pretensions (meandering musical passages, sound effects), but ultimately, it is an ambitious and rewarding album.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; also gave it a positive review and said, &quot;On the whole, the record sounds more like the blueprint for a stunning live show than like a viable document of a top-flight hard rock band.&quot;

Other reviews are average, mixed or negative: &quot;Uncut&quot; gave it a score of three stars out of five and said it &quot;smells like another concept album, is far too long and so pretentious as to be farcial. Amazingly, it&#x27;s also mighty entertaining.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; also gave it a score of three stars out of five and said of The Mars Volta: &quot;You have to give them credit for ambition, though, because you&#x27;re not going to find this particular witches&#x27; brew anywhere else.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave it an average review and said, &quot;The music combines the kitchen-sink inclusiveness of psychedelia with the swerves and jolts of the hip-hop era, to approach the ravenous eclecticism of Latin alternative rock.&quot; Yahoo! Music UK gave it five stars out of ten and called it &quot;An incredibly accomplished record, a true testament to the band&#x27;s imagination, intellectual curiosity and outrageous musical talent... Unfortunately, &#x27;Frances The Mute&#x27; is also awful.&quot; &quot;Under the Radar&quot; also gave it a score of five stars out of ten and said, &quot;Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala are fantastically talented musicians and arrangers. But until they rein in their astronomical pretension, they&#x27;ll always look more important than they truly are.&quot;

==Track listing==
The album was initially slated to have six songs, however the title track &quot;Frances the Mute&quot; (which was going to be the first song) was left out due to time constraints. The lyrics for the title track still appeared on the inside of the CD jewel case tray, while the song itself was released on &quot;The Widow&quot; single. The ending of &quot;Frances the Mute&quot; reprises the album&#x27;s bookend, &quot;Sarcophagi&quot; filtered through radio static.

The finalized track listing had five tracks and was intended to be released as such on all formats. Because of disputes with Universal Records, &quot;Cassandra Gemini&quot; (listed as &quot;Cassandra Geminni&quot; on most versions of the album) was arbitrarily split into eight tracks on the CD version, taking up tracks 5 through 12, since the band would otherwise only be paid an EP&#x27;s wages for a 5 track album. The splits also were not done according to the song&#x27;s actual five movements (except the final one, &quot;Sarcophagi&quot;). On some digital stores such as iTunes and Amazon, &quot;Cassandra Gemini&quot; was available as a single track; currently, on streaming platforms it also appears split into 8 tracks with incorrect names which also do not accurately match the movements (some of the track names are erroneously taken from the movements of the previous song &quot;Miranda That Ghost Just Isn&#x27;t Holy Anymore&quot;).

===Original track listing===
All lyrics written by Cedric Bixler-Zavala, all music composed by Omar Rodríguez-López.

===CD pressing===
===Japanese bonus DVD===
&quot;Frances the Mute&quot; is presented as audio only; the rest is video.
===Best Buy exclusive===
The Best Buy version of the album included a download card for one bonus track:
A second Best Buy promotion included a free separate CD of the song &quot;Frances The Mute&quot; itself along with the live acoustic &quot;The Widow&quot;.
===Vinyl pressing===
On vinyl, &quot;Cassandra Gemini&quot; was split between two sides, in the middle of &quot;Faminepulse&quot;. Each side of vinyl (save the final one) ends with a locked groove, repeating either a sound effect or a bar of music endlessly until the needle is lifted. The end of the first side and the start of the third side also contain the bookends of &quot;L&#x27;Via L&#x27;Viaquez&quot;; these small portions are indexed separately from both &quot;The Widow&quot; and &quot;Miranda&quot;. This was more than likely done to allow the loops ending each side to function properly.

<text>A gait is a manner of limb movements made during locomotion. Human gaits are the various ways in which humans can move, either naturally or as a result of specialized training. Human gait is defined as bipedal forward propulsion of the center of gravity of the human body, in which there are sinuous movements of different segments of the body with little energy spent. Various gaits are characterized by differences in limb movement patterns, overall velocity, forces, kinetic and potential energy cycles, and changes in contact with the ground.

== Classification ==
Human gaits are classified in various ways. Each gait can be generally categorized as either natural (one that humans use instinctively) or trained (a non-instinctive gait learned via training). Examples of the latter include hand walking and specialized gaits used in martial arts. Gaits can also be categorized according to whether the person remains in continuous contact with the ground.

== Foot strike ==
One variable in gait is &quot;foot strike&quot; – which part of the foot connects with the ground first.

* &quot;forefoot strike&quot; – toe-heel: ball of foot lands first
* &quot;mid-foot strike&quot; – heel and ball land simultaneously
* &quot;heel strike&quot; – heel-toe: heel of foot lands, then plantar flexes to ball

Sprinting typically features a forefoot strike, but the heel does not usually contact the ground.

Some researchers classify foot strike by the initial center of pressure; this is mostly applicable to shod running (running while wearing shoes). In this classification:

* a forefoot strike has the initial center of pressure in the front one-third of shoe length;
* a mid-foot strike is in the middle third;
* a rear-foot strike (heel strike) is in the rear third.

Foot strike varies between types of strides. It changes significantly and notably between walking and running, and between wearing shoes (shod) and not wearing shoes (barefoot).

Typically, barefoot walking features heel or mid-foot strikes, while barefoot running features mid-foot or forefoot strikes. Barefoot running rarely features heel strikes because the impact can be painful, the human heel pad not absorbing much of the force of impact. By contrast, 75% of runners wearing modern running shoes use heel strikes; running shoes are characterized by a padded sole, stiff soles and arch support, and slope down from a more-padded heel to a less-padded forefoot.

The cause of this change in gait in shoe running is unknown, but Lieberman noted that there is correlation between the foot-landing style and exposure to shoes. In some individuals the gait pattern is largely unchanged (the leg and foot positions are identical in barefoot and shoes), but the wedge shape of the padding moves the point of impact back from the forefoot to the mid-foot. In other cases it is believed that the padding of the heel softens the impact. This results in runners modifying their gait to move the point of contact further back in the foot.

A 2012 study involving Harvard University runners found that those who &quot;habitually rear-foot strike had approximately twice the rate of repetitive stress injuries than individuals who habitually forefoot strike.&quot; This was the first study to investigate the link between foot strike and injury rates. However, earlier studies have shown that smaller collision forces were generated when running forefoot strike compared to rear-foot strike. This may protect the ankle joints and lower limbs from some of the impact-related injuries experienced by rear-foot strikers.

In a 2017 article called &quot;Foot Strike Pattern in Children During Shod-Unshod Running&quot;, over 700 children aged 6 to 16 were observed using multiple video recording devices in order to study their foot strike patterns and neutral support. Rear foot strike was most common, in both shod and unshod running, and in both boys and girls. There was a significant reduction in rear foot strike from shod to unshod: boys shod - 83.95% RFS, boys unshod - 62.65% RFS; girls shod - 87.85% RFS, girls unshod - 62.70% RFS.
As of 2021 there was a very low level of evidence to suggest a relationship between foot strike pattern and runner injury. Studies used retrospective designs, low sample size and potentially inaccurate self-reporting.
== Control of gait by the nervous system ==
The central nervous system regulates gait in a highly ordered fashion through a combination of voluntary and automatic processes. The basic locomotor pattern is an automatic process that results from rhythmic reciprocal bursts of flexor and extensor activity. This rhythmic firing is the result of Central Pattern Generators (CPGs), which operate regardless of whether a motion is voluntary or not. CPGs do not require sensory input to be sustained. However, studies have identified that gait patterns in deafferented or immobilized animals are more simplistic than in neurologically intact animals. (Deafferentation and immobilization are experimental preparations of animals to study neural control. &quot;Deafferentation&quot; involves transecting the dorsal roots of the spinal cord that innervate the animal&#x27;s limbs, which impedes transmission of sensory information while keeping motor innervation of muscles intact. In contrast, &quot;immobilization&quot; involves injecting an acetylcholine inhibitor, which impedes the transmission of motor signals while sensory input is unaffected.)

The complexity of gait arises from the need to adapt to expected and unexpected changes in the environment (e.g., changes in walking surface or obstacles). Visual, vestibular, proprioceptive, and tactile sensory information provides important feedback related to gait and permits the adjustment of a person&#x27;s posture or foot placement depending on situational requirements. When approaching an obstacle, visual information about the size and location of the object is used to adapt the stepping pattern. These adjustments involve change in the trajectory of leg movement and the associated postural adjustments required to maintain their balance. Vestibular information provides information about position and movement of the head as the person moves through their environment. Proprioceptors in the joints and muscles provide information about joint position and changes in muscle length. Skin receptors, referred to as exteroceptors, provide additional tactile information about stimuli that a limb encounters.

Gait in humans is difficult to study due to ethical concerns. Therefore, the majority of what is known about gait regulation in humans is ascertained from studies involving other animals or is demonstrated in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging during the mental imagery of gait. These studies have provided the field with several important discoveries.

=== Locomotor centers ===
There are three specific centers within the brain that regulate gait:

* Mesencephalic Locomotor Region (MLR)- Within the midbrain, the MLR receives input from the premotor cortex, the limbic system, cerebellum, hypothalamus, and other parts of the brainstem. These neurons connect to other neurons within the mesencephalic reticular formation which then descend to the via the ventrolateral funiculus to the spinal locomotor networks. Studies where the MLR of decerebrate cats have been stimulated either electrically or chemically have shown that increased intensity of stimulation has led to increased speed of stepping. Deep brain stimulation of the MLR in individuals with Parkinson&#x27;s has also led to improvements in gait and posture.
* Sub thalamic Locomotor Region (SLR)- The SLR is part of hypothalamus. It activates the spinal locomotor networks both directly and indirectly via the MLR.
* Cerebellar Locomotor Region (CLR)- Similar to the SLR, the CLR activates the reticulo-spinal locomotor pathway via direct and indirect projections.

These centers are coordinated with the posture control systems within the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum. With each behavioral movement, the sensory systems responsible for posture control respond. These signals act on the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. Many of these pathways are currently under investigation, but some aspects of this control are fairly well understood.

=== Regulation by the cerebral cortex ===
Sensory input from multiple areas of the cerebral cortex, such as the visual cortex, vestibular cortex, and the primary sensory cortex, is required for skilled locomotor tasks. This information is integrated and transmitted to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and premotor area of the cerebral cortex where motor programs are created for intentional limb movement and anticipatory postural adjustments. For example, the motor cortex uses visual information to increase the precision of stepping movements. When approaching an obstacle, an individual will make adjustments to their stepping pattern based on visual input regarding the size and location of the obstacle. The primary motor cortex is responsible for the voluntary control for the contralateral leg while the SMA is linked to postural control.

=== Regulation by the cerebellum ===
The cerebellum plays a major role in motor coordination, regulating voluntary and involuntary processes. Regulation of gait by the cerebellum is referred to as “error/correction,” because the cerebellum responds to abnormalities in posture in order to coordinate proper movement. The cerebellum is thought to receive sensory information (e.g. visual, vestibular) about actual stepping patterns as they occur and compare them to the intended stepping pattern. When there is a discrepancy between these two signals, the cerebellum determines the appropriate correction and relays this information to the brainstem and motor cortex. Cerebellar output to the brainstem is thought to be specifically related to postural muscle tone while output to the motor cortex is related to cognitive and motor programming processes. The cerebellum sends signals to the cerebral cortex and the brain stem in response to sensory signals received from the spinal cord. Efferent signals from these regions go to the spinal cord where motor neurons are activated to regulate gait. This information is used to regulate balance during stepping and integrates information about limb movement in space, as well as head position and movement.

=== Regulation by the spinal cord ===
Spinal reflexes not only generate the rhythm of locomotion through CPGs but also ensure postural stability during gait. There are multiple pathways within the spinal cord which play a role in regulating gait, including the role of reciprocal inhibition and stretch reflexes to produce alternating stepping patterns. A stretch reflex occurs when a muscle is stretched and then contracts protectively while opposing muscle groups relax. An example of this during gait occurs when the weight-bearing leg nears the end of the stance phase. At this point the hip extends and the hip flexors are elongated. Muscle spindles within the hip flexors detect this stretch and trigger muscle contraction of the hip flexors required for the initiation of the swing phase of gait. However, Golgi tendon organs in the extensor muscles also send signals related to the amount of weight being supported through the stance leg to ensure that limb flexion does not occur until the leg is adequately unweighted and the majority of weight has been transferred to the opposite leg. Information from the spinal cord is transmitted for higher-order processing to supraspinal structures via spinothalamic, spinoreticular, and spinocerebellar tracts.

== Natural gaits ==
The so-called natural gaits, in increasing order of speed, are the walk, jog, skip, run, and sprint. While other intermediate-speed gaits may occur naturally to some people, these five basic gaits occur naturally across almost all cultures. All natural gaits are designed to propel a person forward but can also be adapted for lateral movement. As natural gaits all have the same purpose; they are mostly distinguished by when the leg muscles are used during the gait cycle.

===Walk===
Walking involves having at least one foot in contact with the ground at all times. There is also a period of time within the gait cycle where both feet are simultaneously in contact with the ground. When a foot is lifted off the ground, that limb is in the &quot;swing phase&quot; of gait. When a foot is in contact with the ground, that limb is in the &quot;stance phase&quot; of gait. A mature walking pattern is characterized by the gait cycle being approximately 60% stance phase, 40% swing phase. Initiation of gait is a voluntary process that involves a preparatory postural adjustment where the center of mass is moved forward and laterally prior to unweighting one leg. The center of mass is only within a person&#x27;s base of support when both feet are in contact with the ground (known as double limb stance). When only one foot is in contact with the ground (single limb stance), the center of mass is in front of that foot and moving towards the leg that is in the swing phase.

===Skip===
Skipping is a gait children display when they are about four to five years old. While a jog is similar to a horse&#x27;s trot, the skip is closer to the bipedal equivalent of a horse&#x27;s canter. In order to investigate the gait strategies likely to be favored at low gravity, a study by Ackermann and Van Den Bogert ran a series of predictive, computational simulations of gait using a physiological model of the musculoskeletal system, without assuming any particular type of gait. They used a computationally efficient optimization strategy, allowing for multiple simulations. Their results reveal skipping as more efficient and less fatiguing than walking or running and suggest the existence of a walk-skip rather than a walk-run transition at low gravity.

== Gait patterns in children ==
Time and distance parameters of gait patterns are dependent on a child&#x27;s age. Different age leads to different step speed and timing. Arm swinging slows when the speed of walking is increased. The height of a child plays a significant role in stride distance and speed. The taller the child is the longer the stride will be and the further the step will be. Gait patterns are velocity and age dependent. For example, as age increases so does velocity. Meanwhile, as age increases, the cadence (rate at which someone walks that is measured in steps per minute) of the gait pattern decreases. Physical attributes such as height, weight, and even head circumference can also play a role in gait patterns in children. Environmental and emotional status also play a role in with speed, velocity, and gait patterns that a child uses. Besides, children of different genders will have different rates of gait development. Significant developmental changes in gait parameters such as stride time, swing time, and cadence occur in a child&#x27;s gait two months after the onset of independent walking, possibly due to an increase in postural control at this point of development.

By the age of three, most children have mastered the basic principles of walking, consistent with that of adults. Age is not the only deciding factor in gait development. Gender differences have been seen in young children as early as three years old. Girls tend to have a more stable gait than boys between the ages of 3–6 years old. Another difference includes the plantar contact area. Girls showed a smaller contact area in plantar loading patterns than boys in children with healthy feet.

== Sex differences ==
There are sex differences in human gait patterns: females tend to walk with smaller step width and more pelvic movement. Gait analysis generally takes biological sex into consideration. Sex differences in human gait can be explored using a demonstration created by the BioMotion Laboratory at York University in Toronto.

== Efficiency and evolutionary implications ==
Even though plantigrade locomotion usually distributes more weight toward the end of the limb than digitigrade locomotion, which increases energy expenditure in most systems, studies have shown that humans are economical walkers, but not economical runners, which is said to be consistent with evolutionary specialization for both economical walking and endurance running.

For the same distance, walking with a natural heel-first gait burns roughly 70% less energy than running. Differences of this magnitude are unusual in mammals. Kathyrn Knight of the &quot;Journal of Experimental Biology&quot; summarizes the findings of one study: &quot;Landing heel first also allows us to transfer more energy from one step to the next to improve our efficiency, while placing the foot flat on the ground reduces the forces around the ankle (generated by the ground pushing against us), which our muscles have to counteract.&quot; According to David Carrier of the University of Utah, who helped perform the study, &quot;Given the great distances hunter-gatherers travel, it is not surprising that humans are economical walkers.&quot;

==Key determinants of gait==
A normal gait pattern depends on a range of biomechanical features, controlled by the nervous system for increased energy conservation and balance. These biomechanical features of normal gait have been defined as key determinants of gait. It is therefore necessary for the refined neurological control and integration of these gait features for accuracy and precision with less energy expenditure. As a result, any abnormality of the neuro-musculo-skeletal system may lead to abnormality in gait and increased energy expenditure.

The six kinematics or determinants of gait, described below, were introduced by Saunders et al. in 1953, and have been widely embraced with various refinements. Recent studies have suggested that the first three determinants might contribute less to reducing the vertical displacement of the center of mass (COM).

These determinants of gait are known to ensure economical locomotion, by the reduction in vertical center of mass (COM) excursion leading to reduction in metabolic energy. It is therefore suggested that the precise control of these determinants of gait leads to increased energy conservation. These kinematic features of gait are integrated or coordinated in order to ensure a circular arc trajectory of the COM, as theory proposed as the &#x27;compass gait (straight knee)&#x27;. The theory underlying the determinants run contrary to that of the &#x27;inverted pendulum&#x27; theory with a static stance leg acting as a pendulum that prescribes an arc. The six determinants of gaits and their effects on COM displacement and energy conservation are described below in chronological order:
#Pelvic rotation: This kinematic feature of gait operates under the theory of compass gait model. In this model, the pelvis rotates side to side during normal gait. In effect, it aids in the progression of the contralateral side through reduced hip flexion and extension. Its effect on the reduction of metabolic energy and the increased energy conservation is through the reduction of vertical COM displacement. This notion of reduction of metabolic cost may be disputed by a study done by Gard and Childress (1997), who stated that there may be minimal effect of pelvic rotation on vertical COM displacement. Furthermore, other studies have found pelvic rotation to have little effect on the smoothing of COM trajectory. Pelvic rotation has been shown to account for about 12% reduction in the total COM vertical displacement.
#Pelvic tilt/Obliquity: Normal gait results in tilting of the swing phase side, in relation to the control by the stance side hip abductors. As a consequence, there is the neutralization of raising of COM during the transition from hip flexion to extension. Its effect on the reduction of metabolic energy and the increased energy conservation is via the reduction of vertical COM trajectory or peak form compass gait model. Pelvic obliquity&#x27;s effects on reduction of vertical displacement of COM has been examined and been shown to only reduce vertical displacement of COM by at most, only 2–4 mm.
#Knee flexion at stance phase: The knee usually supports the body weight in flexed position during walking. The knee is usually fully extended at heel strike and then begins to flex (average magnitude of 15 degrees) when foot is completely flat on the ground. The effects of the stance-phase knee flexion is to lower the apex of vertical trajectory of the COM via shortening of the leg resulting in some energy conservation. But recent studies testing this third determinant of gait have reported varied results. It was found out that stance-phase knee flexion did not contribute to the reduction in vertical trajectory of COM. Furthermore, Gard and Childress (1997) indicated that maximum COM is reached at mid-stance when knee is slightly flexed, depicting minor reduction of the maximum height of the COM by a few millimeters.
#Foot and ankle motions: Saunders et al. showed relationship between angular displacement and motions of foot, ankle and knee. This results in two intersecting arcs of rotation at the foot during stance phase at heel contact and heel rise. At heel contact the COM reaches its lowest point of downward displacement when the foot is dorsiflexed, and the knee joint fully extended in order for the extremity to be at its maximum length. The ankle rockers at heel strike and mid-stance leads to decrease COM displacement through the shortening of the leg. Studies by Kerrigan et al. (2001) and Gard &amp; Childress (1997) have shown the major role played by heel rise in reducing the COM vertical displacement.
#Knee motion: The motion of the knee is related to those of the ankle and foot motions and results in the reduction of COM vertical displacement. Therefore, an immobile knee or ankle could lead to increases in COM displacement and energy cost.
#Lateral pelvic displacement: In this key gait feature, the displacement of the COM is realized by the lateral shift of the pelvis or by relative adduction of the hip. Correction of disproportionate lateral displacement of the pelvis is mediated by the effect of tibiofemoral angle, and relative adduction of the hip, which results in reduction in vertical COM displacement. It is clear that these kinematic features play a critical role in ensuring efficiency in normal gait. But there may be the need for further extensive testing or validation of each of the key determinants of gait.

== Abnormal gaits ==
Abnormal gait is a result of one or more of these tracts being disturbed. This can happen developmentally or as the result of neurodegeneration. The most prominent example of gait irregularities due to developmental problems comes from studies of children on the autism spectrum. They have decreased muscle coordination, thus resulting in abnormalities in gait. Some of this is associated with decreased muscle tone, also known as hypotonia, which is also common in ASD. The most prominent example of abnormal gait as a result of neurodegeneration is Parkinson&#x27;s.

Although these are the best understood examples of abnormal gait, there are other phenomena that are described in the medical field.

* Antalgic gait: limping caused by pain that appears or worsens when bearing weight on one limb, due to injury, disease, or other painful conditions
* Charlie Chaplin gait: occurs in tibial torsion.
* Circumduction gait: occurs in hemiplegia
* Waddling gait: occurs in bilateral congenital hip dislocation
* High stepping gait: occurs in foot drop
* Scissor gait: occurs in cerebral palsy
* Stiff hip gait: occurs in ankylosis of the hip
* Trendelenburg gait: occurs in unstable hip due to congenital dislocation of hip, gluteus medius muscle weakness

Abnormal gait can also be a result of a stroke. However, by using treadmill therapy to activate the cerebellum, abnormalities in gait can be improved.

==Literary references==
The author of the Deuterocanonical Book of Sirach observes that &quot;a man&#x27;s attire, and excessive laughter, and gait, shew what he is&quot;. Biblical writer J. J. Collins suggests that this verse quotes a traditional maxim.

<text>Three Chrysler Imperial Parade Phaetons were produced in 1952 by Chrysler as ceremonial vehicles. They were styled by Virgil Exner and were in many ways a preview of the new &quot;100 Million Dollar&quot; styling that would debut in 1955 on the newly separate Imperial marque and on other full-size Chrysler Corporation Cars.

== Details ==

The cars were based on stretched (to 147.5 in) 1952 Imperial Crown Limousine chassis and carried completely custom bodywork with the exception of the 1951 Imperial grille, bumpers and front and rear trim. Almost uniquely for a postwar car, they were dual-cowl phaetons, with separate front and rear passenger compartments, each with its own windshield. There were no side windows, and a lightweight Dacron convertible top covered only the rear compartment during inclement weather, and was manually retracted beneath the rear-hinged deck lid when not in use. The rear doors were suicide doors and had no exterior handles. In 1940, Chrysler built six limited production cars with the same approach to uniqueness called the Chrysler Newport Phaeton also using an Imperial chassis.

Under the custom bodywork, the mechanicals were standard top-of-the-line Chrysler for the period, with a 331 cubic inch (5.42 L) FirePower V8 engine, torque converter transmission, and power steering.

Three cars were built. One was for New York City, the second for Los Angeles, and the third was intended to be a gift to the White House, but the gift was refused as against the then rules for receiving gifts. Instead, the third car was nominally based in Detroit and was used around the country. The cars continued to be owned and serviced by the Chrysler Corporation.

After three years of service, the cars were brought back to the factory in 1955 to be updated to 1956 Imperial appearance, in which form they continue to exist to the present day. The front and rear, including grilles, bumpers and trim, were replaced. Internally, the engines were updated with 4-barrel carburetors, and fully automatic Powerflite transmissions were installed. The cars were all repainted. After the rebuild, the cars were donated to the respective cities.

A revival was introduced by Chrysler as a concept car, called the Chrysler Phaeton in 1997.

== New York car ==

The New York car was originally painted in black with a grey interior. In the 1955 rebuild, it was repainted off-white with a red interior. It must have been repainted in black again before the August 11, 1969 parade with the Apollo 11 astronauts as evidenced in the photo. The car remains in the possession of the City of New York, and was rebuilt in the early 1980s. At this time, it was repainted in black again, but retained the red interior.

The Phaeton is still occasionally used for official functions, parades and ceremonies. It has carried many dignitaries, celebrities, and notables over the years.

== Los Angeles car ==

The Los Angeles car was painted cream with a rose interior, and was first used in the 1953 Tournament of Roses Parade. It was subsequently used up and down the West Coast. In its 1955 rebuild, it was repainted metallic silver-blue with an off-white interior. It can be seen in that form in the 1959 film of the Broadway musical &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, transporting the &quot;General Bullmoose&quot; character. It was later restored and repainted white, retaining its off-white interior. The interior was more recently replaced in red leather. It is still in the possession of the City of Los Angeles and takes part in official parades and celebrations. Its use in other Hollywood films includes 1953’s How to Marry a Millionaire transporting Lauren Bacall, Victor Mature&#x27;s limousine in 1959’s The Big Circus, the 1960 Jerry Lewis film Cinderfella, and 1962’s Sweet Bird of Youth. A more recent appearance was in the 1987 Charles Bronson film &quot;Assassination&quot;.

== Detroit car ==

The Detroit car was originally painted in a metallic green with a natural pigskin interior, and was used in events around the country. It was repainted in desert sand with a red interior in its 1955 rebuild. This Phaeton was sold and ended up in private hands, becoming part of Paul Stern&#x27;s collection for some time before being sold to the Imperial Palace collection in Las Vegas, Nevada where it was displayed for many years. In 2001, with the mass of the Imperial Palace collection being broken up, it was sold to Robert Petersen and is now on display at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. The car is currently in white with a red interior.

<text>Diarmait Mac Murchada (Modern Irish: &quot;Diarmaid Mac Murchadha&quot;; anglicised as Dermot MacMurrough or Dermot MacMurphy; – c. 1 May 1171), was King of Leinster in Ireland from 1127 to 1171. In 1167, he was deposed by the High King of Ireland, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair. To recover his kingdom, Mac Murchada solicited help from King Henry II of England. His issue unresolved, he gained the military support of the Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (otherwise known as &quot;Strongbow&quot;), thus initiating the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland.

In exchange for his aid, Mac Murchada promised Strongbow the hand in marriage of his daughter Aoife and the right to succeed to the Kingship of Leinster. Henry II then mounted a larger second invasion in 1171 to ensure his control over Strongbow, resulting in the Norman Lordship of Ireland. Mac Murchada was later known as Diarmait na nGall (Irish for &quot;Diarmait of the Foreigners&quot;). He was seen in Irish history as the king that invited the first-ever wave of Anglo-Norman settlers, who were planted by the Norman conquest. The invasion had a great deal of impact on Irish Christianity, increasing the de facto ability of the Holy See to regulate Christianity in Ireland.

==Early life and family==
Diarmait was born around 1090 or 1110, a son of Donnchadh mac Murchada, King of Leinster and Dublin. His father&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Derbforgaill, was a daughter of Donnchad, King of Munster and thus a granddaughter of Brian Boru. In 1115 his father attacked Domnall Gerrlámhach, King of Dublin, but died in the ensuing battle. The citizens of Dublin buried him with the carcass of a dog, considered to be a huge insult.

He had two wives (as allowed under the Brehon laws), the first of whom, Sadhbh Ní Faeláin, was mother of a daughter named Órlaith who married Domnall Mór, King of Munster. His second wife, Mór ingen Muirchertaig, was mother of Aoife / Eva of Leinster and his youngest son Conchobar Mac Murchada. He also had two other sons, Domhnall Caomhánach mac Murchada and Énna Cennselach mac Murchada (blinded 1169). Diarmait is buried in the Cathedral graveyard of Ferns village.

==King of Leinster==

After the death of his older brother, Énna Mac Murchada, Diarmait unexpectedly became King of Leinster. This was opposed by the then High King of Ireland, Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair (Turlough O&#x27;Conor) who feared (rightly) that Mac Murchada would become a rival. Toirdelbach sent one of his allied kings, Tigernán Ua Ruairc (Tiernan O&#x27;Rourke) to conquer Leinster and oust the young Mac Murchada. Ua Ruairc went on a brutal campaign slaughtering the livestock of Leinster and thereby trying to starve the province&#x27;s residents. Mac Murchada was ousted from his throne, but was able to regain it with the help of the Leinster clans in 1132. Afterwards followed two decades of uneasy peace between Ua Conchobair and Diarmait. In 1152 he even assisted the High King to raid the land of Ua Ruairc who had by then become a renegade.

Mac Murchada also is said to have abducted Ua Ruairc&#x27;s wife Derbforgaill (English: &quot;Dervorgilla&quot;) along with all her furniture and goods, with the aid of Derbforgaill&#x27;s brother, a future pretender to the kingship of Meath. Other sources say that Derbforgaill was not an unwilling prisoner and that she remained in Ferns with Mac Murchada in comfort for a number of years. Her advanced age indicates that she may have been a refugee or a hostage; in any case, she was under his protection. Whatever the reality, the &quot;abduction&quot; was given as a further reason or excuse for enmity between the two kings.

==Church builder==
As king of Leinster, in the years 1140–70 Diarmait commissioned the Irish Romanesque buildings of:
* Baltinglass Abbey
* St Saviour&#x27;s Priory
* Ferns Abbey
* Killeshin Church

He sponsored convents (nunneries) at Dublin (St Mary&#x27;s, 1146), and around 1151 two more at Aghade, County Carlow and at Kilculliheen near Waterford city. The abbey of St. Mary Del Hogge in Dublin was named after the Hoggen Green or Haugr meaning gravesite in old Norse. This site later became &#x27;College Green&#x27; after the Reformation and the establishment of Trinity College. It&#x27;s said that in the late 1600s that Viking graves were still to be seen at Hoggen Green.

He also sponsored the successful career of churchman St Lawrence O&#x27;Toole (Lorcán Ua Tuathail). He married O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s half-sister Mor in 1153 and presided at the synod of Clane in 1161 when O&#x27;Toole was installed as archbishop of Dublin.

==Exile and return==

In 1166, Ireland&#x27;s High King and Mac Murchada&#x27;s main ally Muirchertach Ua Lochlainn had fallen, and a large coalition led by Tigernán Ua Ruairc (Mac Murchada&#x27;s arch enemy) marched on Leinster. The new High King Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair deposed Mac Murchada from the throne of Leinster. Mac Murchada fled to Wales and from there to England and France seeking the support of Henry II of England in the recruitment of soldiers to reclaim his kingship. Henry authorised Diarmait to seek help from the soldiers and mercenaries in his kingdom. Those who agreed to help included Richard de Clare and half-brothers Robert FitzStephen and Maurice FitzGerald. Robert was accompanied by his half-nephew Robert de Barry. Strongbow was offered Diarmait&#x27;s daughter Aoife in marriage and promised the kingship of Leinster on Diarmait&#x27;s death. Robert and Maurice were promised lands in Wexford and elsewhere for their services.

On returning to Wales, Robert FitzStephen helped him organise a mercenary army of English and Welsh soldiers. Landing at Bannow Bay, they laid siege to Wexford which fell in May 1169. After a period of inactivity, they went on to raid the Kingdom of Ossory. They then launched raids in the territories of the Uí Tuathail, the Uí Broin, and Uí Conchobhair Failghe. Mac Murchada gambled that King Ruaidrí would not hurt the Leinster hostages which he had, which included Mac Murchada&#x27;s son, Conchobar Mac Murchada. Although he had been distracted by disturbances elsewhere in the kingdom, King Ruaidrí could no longer ignore this powerful force.

He marched his forces into Leinster and, with the mediation of the Church, the commanders of the two armies began negotiations at Ferns, Diarmait&#x27;s political base. An agreement was reached, whereby Diarmait was allowed to remain King of Leinster with Diarmait for his part recognising Ua Conchobair as High King. Some historians maintain that the treaty with Ua Conchobair included a secret agreement whereby Diarmait undertook to bring in no more foreign mercenaries and to send away Robert FitzStephen and his men as soon as Leinster was subdued. It&#x27;s possible that Mac Murchada&#x27;s hand may have been forced by the arrival at Wexford in May 1170 of Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Llanstephan and his force of 10 knights, thirty men-at-arms and a hundred archers and foot soldiers. Mac Murchada and FitzGerald marched on the Ostman Norse–Gaelic city of Dublin which surrendered. Within a short time, all Leinster was again in Mac Murchada&#x27;s control. Emboldened by these victories, he sent Robert FitzStephen to the assistance of his son-in-law, Domnall Mór Ua Briain, the King of Thomond.

In the opinion of some historians, Mac Murchada&#x27;s plans may have been limited to the recovery of his throne; only later when the superiority of the mercenary arms had overawed the Gaelic nobility of Ireland did he consider tilting at the high kingship itself. According to the contemporary Gerald of Wales, he was advised by Robert FitzStephen and Maurice FitzGerald to write to Strongbow requesting assistance. Strongbow sent an advance party under Raymond le Gros, arriving himself in 1170 at the Ostman Norse–Gaelic settlement of Waterford. Following the fall of Waterford, the promised marriage of Aoife and Strongbow took place. As a result, Richard FitzGilbert, count of Strigoil, became lord of Leinster. The marriage was imagined and painted in the Romantic style in 1854 by Daniel Maclise.
Mac Murchada was devastated after the death of his youngest son, Conchobar, retreated to Ferns and died a few months later.

===Later reputation===
The scholar Áed Ua Crimthainn was probably Diarmait&#x27;s court historian. In his &quot;Book of Leinster&quot;, Áed seems to be the first to set out the concept of the &quot;rí Érenn co fressabra&quot;, the &quot;king of Ireland with opposition&quot;, later more widely adopted. This described Diarmait&#x27;s ambitions and the achievements of his great-grandfather Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó.

In Irish history books written after 1800, Diarmait Mac Murchada was often seen as a traitor, but his intention was not to aid an English invasion of Ireland, but rather to use Henry&#x27;s assistance to become the High King of Ireland himself. The imperialism of the English, and later British, empire must not be placed anachronistically on the events of 1166. The adventurers who answered Diarmait&#x27;s call for help were reacting to the opportunity for land and wealth. Henry II did not wish to invade Ireland, he was forced to react to earl Richard&#x27;s aggrandisement. The counts of Strigoil had been supporters of King Stephen, and Henry II did not forget easily.

Gerald of Wales, a Cambro-English cleric who visited Ireland in 1185 and whose uncles and cousins were prominent soldiers in the army of Strongbow, repeated their opinions of Mac Murchada:

==Death and descendants==


After Strongbow&#x27;s successful invasion, Henry II mounted a second and larger invasion in 1171 to ensure his control over his subjects, which succeeded. He then accepted the submission of the Irish kings in Dublin in November 1171. He also ensured that his moral claim to Ireland, granted by the supposed 1155 papal bull &quot;Laudabiliter&quot;, was reconfirmed in 1172 by Pope Alexander III, and also by a synod of all the Irish bishops at the Synod of Cashel. He added &quot;Lord of Ireland&quot; to his many other titles. Before he could consolidate his new Lordship he had to go to France to deal with his sons&#x27; rebellion in 1173.

Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair was soon ousted, first as King of Ireland and eventually as King of Connacht. The Lordship directly controlled a small territory in Ireland surrounding the cities of Dublin and Waterford, while the rest of Ireland was divided between English lords and court &quot;curiales&quot;. The 1175 Treaty of Windsor, brokered by St Lawrence O&#x27;Toole with Henry II, formalised the submission of the Gaelic clans that remained in local control, like the Uí Conchobair who retained Connacht and the Uí Néill who retained most of Ulster.

Diarmait&#x27;s male-line descendants included Art Óg mac Murchadha Caomhánach (d. 1417), who revived the kingship of Leinster, and Cahir mac Art Kavanagh (died 1554) who continued to rule parts of Leinster independently of the English until the Tudor conquest of Ireland in the 16th century. The last proclaimed King of Leinster, Domhnall Spáinneach Mac Murchadha Caomhánach, died in 1632. Later senior descendants who retained the position among the Irish upper-classes included Arthur MacMorrough Kavanagh (1831–1889) and his son, Walter MacMurrough Kavanagh 1856–1922). Dermot McMorrough Kavanagh (d. 1958) was recognised as Chief of the Name of Clann Caomhánach (Kavanagh) in his lifetime.

Diarmait died about 1 May 1171 and was buried in Ferns Cathedral, where his reputed grave can be seen in the outside graveyard.

==Theatrical representations==
In the play &quot;The Dreaming of the Bones&quot; by W. B. Yeats, the ghosts of Dermot and Derbforgaill rescue an Irish rebel during the Easter Week rebellion, and reveal that they are bound until an Irishman can forgive them for bringing the Normans to Ireland.

<doc id="880497" wikidata="Q407426" url="?curid=880497" title="Linoleic acid">
<text>Linoleic acid (LA) is an organic compound with the formula . Both alkene groups () are &quot;cis&quot;. It is a fatty acid sometimes denoted 18:2 (n−6) or 18:2 &quot;cis&quot;-9,12. A linoleate is a salt or ester of this acid.

Linoleic acid is a polyunsaturated, omega−6 fatty acid. It is a colorless liquid that is virtually insoluble in water but soluble in many organic solvents. It typically occurs in nature as a triglyceride (ester of glycerin) rather than as a free fatty acid. It is one of two essential fatty acids for humans, who must obtain it through their diet, and the most essential, because the body uses it as a base to make the others.

The word &quot;linoleic&quot; derives , reflecting the fact that it was first isolated from linseed oil.

==History==
In 1844, F. Sacc, working at the laboratory of Justus von Liebig, isolated linoleic acid from linseed oil. In 1886, K. Peters determined the existence of two double bonds. Its essential role in human diet was discovered by G. O. Burr and others in 1930. Its chemical structure was determined by T. P. Hilditch and others in 1939, and it was synthesized by R. A. Raphael and F. Sondheimer in 1950.

==In physiology==

The consumption of linoleic acid is vital to proper health, as it is an essential fatty acid.

===Metabolism and eicosanoids===

Linoleic acid (LA: ; 18:2,n−6) is a precursor to arachidonic acid (AA: ; 20:4,n−6) with elongation and unsaturation. AA is the precursor to some prostaglandins, leukotrienes (LTA, LTB, LTC), thromboxane (TXA) and the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA: ; 20:4,n−6), and other endocannabinoids and eicosanoids.

The metabolism of LA to AA begins with the conversion of LA into gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), effected by Δ6 desaturase. GLA is converted to dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA), the immediate precursor to AA.

LA is also converted by various lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenases, cytochrome P450 enzymes (the CYP monooxygenases), and non-enzymatic autoxidation mechanisms to mono-hydroxyl products viz., 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, and 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid; these two hydroxy metabolites are enzymatically oxidized to their keto metabolites, 13-oxo-octadecadienoic acid and 9-oxo-octadecdienoic acid. Certain cytochrome P450 enzymes, the CYP epoxygenases, catalyze oxidation of LA to epoxide products viz., its 12,13-epoxide, vernolic acid, and its 9,10-epoxide, coronaric acid. These linoleic acid products are implicated in human physiology and pathology.

Hydroperoxides derived from the metabolism of anandamide (AEA: ; 20:4,n−6), or its linoleoyl analogues, are by a lipoxygenase action found to be competitive inhibitors of brain and immune cell FAAH, the enzyme that breaks down AEA and other endocannabinoids, and the compound linoleoyl-ethanol-amide (; 18:2,n−6), an N-acylethanolamine, - the ethanolamide of linoleic acid (LA: ; 18:2,n−6) and its metabolized incorporated ethanolamine (MEA: ), is the first natural inhibitor of FAAH, discovered.

==Uses and reactions==
Linoleic acid is a component of quick-drying oils, which are useful in oil paints and varnishes. These applications exploit the lability of the doubly allylic groups () toward oxygen in air (autoxidation). Addition of oxygen leads to crosslinking and formation of a stable film.

Reduction of the carboxylic acid group of linoleic acid yields linoleyl alcohol.

Linoleic acid is a surfactant with a critical micelle concentration of 1.5 x 10−4 M @ pH 7.5.

Linoleic acid has become increasingly popular in the beauty products industry because of its beneficial properties on the skin. Research points to linoleic acid&#x27;s anti-inflammatory, acne reductive, skin-lightening and moisture retentive properties when applied topically on the skin.

Linoleic acid is also used in some bar of soap products.

==Dietary sources==

It is abundant in safflower, and corn oil, and comprises over half their composition by weight. It is present in medium quantities in soybean oils, sesame, and almonds.
===Other occurrences===
Cockroaches release oleic and linoleic acid upon death, which discourages other roaches from entering the area. This is similar to the mechanism found in ants and bees, which release oleic acid upon death.

==Health effects==
Consumption of linoleic acid has been associated with lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and premature death. There is high-quality evidence that increased intake of linoleic acid decreases total blood cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. Higher in vivo circulating and tissue levels of linoleic acid are associated with a lower risk of major cardiovascular events. Clinical trials have shown that increased linoleic acid intake does not increase markers of inflammation or oxidative stress.

The American Heart Association advises people to replace saturated fat with linoleic acid to reduce CVD risk.

<text>Altorricón () or El Torricó () is a municipality located in the &quot;comarca&quot; of La Litera/La Llitera in the province of Huesca, Aragon, Spain. With an extension of 32.03 km2, the municipal district of Altorricón lies on the southern part of La Llitera, limiting with El Segrià (Almacelles). The district is surrounded north and south by Tamarite de Litera. The municipality contains the town of Altorricón and the uninhabited towns of &quot;Cuquet&quot;, &quot;Montanera&quot; and &quot;Lo Tossal&quot; as well as the old church of &quot;San Bartolomé de Altorricón&quot;.

It has two official names &quot;Altorricón&quot; and &quot;El Torricó&quot;. The official name of Altorricón is considered to be incorrect by historians, although most of the population use that form of the name, in either the Spanish form of it &quot;Altorricón&quot; or the Catalan &quot;Altorricó&quot;. The name probably derived from Western Catalan &quot;Torricó&quot;, or small tower, with Al- being a common prefix in Arab names. It&#x27;s not clear what &#x27;small tower&#x27; the name could refer to, but hypothesis point to Castle of Vallbona (Catalan &quot;Castell de Vallbona&quot;) situated north west from the town, or maybe some building that no longer exists in the center of the village.

The secondary water channel of &quot;La Mola&quot;, derived from the Canal d&#x27;Aragó i Catalunya crosses the municipal district diagonally from NW to SE, and is used to irrigate the land all across the territory. Multiple minor channels distribute the water, namely the ravine of &quot;San Bartomeu&quot; or the one of &quot;Clamorelles&quot;. A small section in the SW is drained by the torrent of &quot;Oriols&quot; and &quot;Vallbona&quot;.

Altorricón, right smack in the middle of the municipality, is crossed by the local road of Tamarite de Litera that springs out north from the national road N240 (Tarragona-San Sebastián). The locals call the portion of the road that heads south to the N240, &quot;la carretera del Butano&quot; (Catalan &quot;carretera del butà&quot;) in honor of the butane gas processing station that once existed at the intersection with the N240. The portion of the road that heads up north is simply called, &quot;carretera de Tamarite&quot; (Catalan &quot;carretera de Tamarit&quot;).

There is another road starting from the nucleus of the town that heads southwest and ends on Tamarite&#x27;s railway station linking with the N240, a few kilometers west from where the road to Tamarite de Litera split up. The road also links Altorricón with the small community of &quot;La Melusa&quot;, and thus locals call the road &quot;carretera de La Melusa&quot;.

The local dialect is a variant of Catalan.

<doc id="880505" wikidata="Q1673071" url="?curid=880505" title="Iron Cross (American band)">
<text>Iron Cross was an American Oi! / hardcore punk band from Washington D.C. They played a rough form of Oi! and were the first band in the US to adopt the skinhead look and the Oi! musical style. Some of its members had close ties to the Washington hardcore punk subculture, due to its relationship with other hardcore bands, with Ian Mackaye, and with Dischord Records. Singer Sab Grey was one of the many roommates in the Dischord House in Arlington, Virginia. The band&#x27;s name, and the fact that most of its members were skinheads, led to accusations of fascism, which Grey and others in the band and the original D.C. skins, always denied, declaring that they &quot;hate Nazis&quot;.

== Career ==
Iron Cross formed in 1980, when Dante Ferrando met Sab Grey. Ferrando was previously in the band Broken Cross with Mark Haggerty. When Grey and Ferrando decided to start a new band, Grey suggested the name Iron Cross. The first lineup consisted of Grey on lead vocals, Haggerty on guitar, Ferrando on drums and John Falls on bass guitar. This lineup lasted a very short time, with Falls leaving after Iron Cross&#x27;s early show at American University. After Falls&#x27; departure, the band went through two more bassists before settling on Wendel Blow, the former bassist for the D.C. hardcore punk band State of Alert. The only non-skinhead in the band was Ferrando, who maintained a spiky punk hairstyle. The band&#x27;s fourth lineup lasted until just after the recording of their first EP, &quot;Skinhead Glory&quot;. That EP features their signature song &quot;Crucified&quot;, which was later covered by many Oi! and hardcore bands.

After Blow left the band, he was replaced by John Dunn. Dunn had been an original member of the D.C. skins and was close friends with the band&#x27;s members. Dunn left the band just before the release of their second EP, &quot;Hated and Proud&quot;. He was replaced by Paul Cleary, who was a founding member of the D.C. bands Trenchmouth and Black Market Baby. The 1982 Dischord Records compilation &quot;Flex Your Head&quot; introduced three Iron Cross songs to an audience beyond the eastern United States.

In 1985, after further lineup changes that left Grey as the only original member of Iron Cross, the band broke up. Ferrando formed the band Gray Matter with Haggerty. Haggerty went on to play with the bands 3 and Severin. Ferrando also played in the band Ignition and is now the owner of the D.C. club The Black Cat. Falls joined the band Egypt Central.

== New lineup ==
In 2001, Iron Cross re-released their EPs and previously-unreleased material in the form of the full-length CD &quot;Live For Now&quot;. Grey played with The Royal Americans (a rockabilly-style band).

A split release with British Oi! band Combat 84 was planned for release on GMM Records in 2002, although this recording never materialized. The mini-album &quot;Two Piece and a Biscuit&quot;, featuring four songs from Iron Cross and three from The Royal Americans, was released in 2007 on 13th State Records.

By 2009, the lineup was: Sab Grey on vocals, Scotty Powers on drums, Dimitri Medevev (d. 2012) on bass, Mark Linskey on guitar and Shadwick Wilde on guitar. This group recorded two songs for a split EP with the band Keyside Strick, which Koi Records released as &quot;Koi Records Split Vol. 5&quot;.

In 2012, Skinflint Records released the Iron Cross EP &quot;Est. 1980&quot;.

== &quot;Crucified&quot; ==
In the mid 1980s, New York hardcore band Agnostic Front began covering &quot;Crucified&quot;, a song from the Iron Cross EP &quot;Skinhead Glory&quot;. Agnostic Front included studio versions of the song on their &quot;Liberty and Justice For...&quot; and &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; albums. Grey&#x27;s lyrics refer to being ridiculed for being different, being blamed for society&#x27;s ills, being accused of violence, and to intolerance because of the actions of others. In a 1984 interview Grey described the intolerance he faced in D.C. for being white:

 I mean everybody calls you a fucking nazi and they&#x27;re the ones who are racist against us. I don&#x27;t hold a grudge against anyone until they start it.

The metaphor of being crucified resonated with Communist, anarchist, and apolitical skinheads who were sick of being labeled as neo-Nazis. White Power sympathizers and fascists who called themselves skinheads also identified with the song due to backlash they received for their reactionary and racist ideology. &quot;Crucified&quot; has become an anthem for both factions of skinheads worldwide. Live audiences have taken to adding a chant of &quot;skinhead army!&quot; to the chorus, a line not included in the band&#x27;s original recording.

<doc id="880508" wikidata="Q1037532" url="?curid=880508" title="Moon Knight">
<text>Moon Knight is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Doug Moench and artist Don Perlin, the character first appeared in &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; #32 (August 1975).

The son of a rabbi, Marc Spector served as a Force Recon Marine and briefly as a CIA operative before becoming a mercenary alongside his friend Jean-Paul &quot;Frenchie&quot; DuChamp. He is killed by Raoul Bushman, but the god Khonshu resurrects him as his avatar. After returning to the United States, Spector becomes the crimefighter Moon Knight, aided by Frenchie and Marlene Alraune, who becomes his lover. Along with his costumed alter ego, he uses three other identities to gain information: billionaire businessman Steven Grant, taxicab driver Jake Lockley, and suited detective and police consultant Mr. Knight. It is later revealed Moon Knight has dissociative identity disorder and that the Grant and Lockley alters emerged during his childhood.

In most depictions, Moon Knight has no abilities beyond his athleticism and detective skills. For a time, he had superhuman strength and durability derived from the phases of the moon, but this ability later vanished.

The character has made appearances in various media outside of comics, including animated series and video games. Oscar Isaac portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe series &quot;Moon Knight&quot;.

==Development==
In an interview, Doug Moench recalled the character&#x27;s genesis: &quot;Somebody mentioned in the office and suggested using The Committee, and that I should bring The Committee back, and then I found out who The Committee were and thought, well they&#x27;re really boring, I don&#x27;t wanna use them. And then I thought, well wait a minute, how about if The Committee hires a mercenary to kill the Werewolf. And I thought, yeah that&#x27;s a good idea, then I create this new character and it won&#x27;t be these boring guys in business suits, it would be a flashy character. So, I said who is best to kill the Werewolf? Well, someone who uses silver weapons because silver hurts the Werewolf. And tied to the night, because the Werewolf only comes out at night, and I&#x27;ll base this character on the Moon, because the Moon makes the Werewolf change, and this is going to be the opposite of the Werewolf, and as soon as I said the Moon I said, ooh I&#x27;ll have a costume that&#x27;s just like the Moon, just black and white, jet and silver, no color on the costume.&quot;

Don Perlin also commented on the creation of the character, &quot;We were told we needed a costumed character in the book. So Doug and I created Moon Knight. I wanted the costume to be just black and white. Since he&#x27;d be on a color page, that would make him a little bit different. He had a silver baton he could use when he battled werewolves. See, he was hired to track down to kill the Werewolf.&quot;

==Publication history==
The character debuted in &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; #32 (August 1975), written by Doug Moench with art by Don Perlin and Al Milgrom, as a mercenary hired by the Committee to capture the title character. The creative team gave Moon Knight moon-related symbols and silver weapons (a metal poisonous to a werewolf) to mark him as a suitable antagonist for the werewolf hero. The two-part story continues into #33, when Moon Knight realizes Russell is a victim rather than a monster and decides to help him. A demonic vision of Moon Knight then appeared in &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; #37 (March 1976).

Editors Marv Wolfman and Len Wein liked the character and decided to give him a solo story in &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; #28–29 (June/August 1976), again written by Doug Moench with art by Don Perlin. The story, along with &quot;Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #22–23 (September/October 1978) written by Bill Mantlo, recast Moon Knight as a more heroic character. His association with the evil Committee during his first appearance was retconned to be an undercover mission he undertook to learn more about the villains. Moon Knight acted as a hero again in &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; #52, written by Steven Grant with art by Jim Craig. In &quot;The Defenders&quot; #47–51, Moon Knight briefly joined the Defenders during their war against the Zodiac Cartel.

Moon Knight appeared in recurring backup stories in &quot;Hulk! Magazine&quot; #11–15, #17–18, and #20, as well as a black and white story in the magazine publication &quot;Marvel Preview&quot; #21, all written by Doug Moench. Artist Bill Sienkiewicz drew Moon Knight in &quot;Hulk! Magazine&quot; issues #13–15, 17–18, and #20, creating a new look for the character heavily influenced by the art of Neal Adams, who at that time was most popular for his work on &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; for DC Comics. This, along with Moon Knight&#x27;s methods and the atmosphere of his stories, cemented a perception among some readers that he was Marvel&#x27;s version of Batman. The &quot;Hulk&quot; backups and &quot;Marvel Preview&quot; issue provided Moon Knight with a partial origin story and introduced his brother, recurring villain Randall Spector (who would later become Shadow Knight).

===Volume 1===
Moon Knight received his first ongoing series in 1980, with Doug Moench and Bill Sienkiewicz as its main creative team. The character received an expanded origin story in issue #1, including Spector&#x27;s &quot;resurrection&quot; in the tomb of Khonshu, suggested by editor Denny O&#x27;Neil), which also introduced several supporting characters as well as recurring enemy Bushman. Though many characters doubted the moon god Khonshu was real and believed Marc Spector only experienced a hallucination while near death, it was never explained why others, such as Spector&#x27;s lover Marlene, concluded this when there was no other explanation for Marc&#x27;s spontaneous recovery from his wounds and a death-like state.

After early sales were good, Marvel made the &quot;Moon Knight&quot; series a flagship title available in comic shops starting with issue #15. The companion mini-series &quot;Moon Knight: Special Edition&quot; reprinted the &quot;Hulk&quot; and &quot;Marvel Preview&quot; Moon Knight stories in color and standard comic format, adapted from their original magazine format. Sienkiewicz stopped penciling the series after issue #30, though he continued to contribute covers until the series ended with issue #38.

===Volume 2===
In 1985, Marvel retooled the character with a new 6-issue mini-series &quot;Moon Knight&quot; by Alan Zelenetz and Chris Warner. The mini-series was titled &quot;Fist of Khonshu&quot;. Only the first 4 issues were written by Zelenetz, the final two issues were each written by a different author. Along with giving Moon Knight new Egyptian-themed weaponry, this mini-series reveals that Marc Spector&#x27;s strength now increases in accordance to the phases of the moon.

===Marvel Fanfare and West Coast Avengers===
Following the &quot;Fist of Khonshu&quot; mini-series, Moon Knight appeared in &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; for two issues (#30 and #38) and became a regular cast member in &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot; (#21–41 and &quot;Annual&quot;s #2–3), written by Steve Englehart. When John Byrne became the series writer, Moon Knight was written out of the West Coast Avengers team.

===Marc Spector: Moon Knight===
After a guest spot in &quot;Punisher Annual&quot; #2 (part of the &quot;Atlantis Attacks&quot; storyline), the character was given a new ongoing title in 1989, &quot;Marc Spector: Moon Knight,&quot; originally under the direction of writer Chuck Dixon. Two one-shots, &quot;Marc Spector: Moon Knight – Special Edition&quot; #1 and &quot;Moon Knight: Divided We Fall,&quot; were published during the run of the title. Dixon then left the series after issue #24, leaving several storylines unresolved such as the fate of Moon Knight&#x27;s errant sidekick, the second Midnight, who was seemingly killed by the terrorist organization known as the Secret Empire. Midnight II&#x27;s fate and plotline were later resolved in the pages of &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #353–358, written by Al Milgrom.

&quot;Marc Spector: Moon Knight&quot; ended with #60 (March 1994). Marc Spector seemingly dies in the issue, sacrificing himself while battling a villain called Seth the Immortal. His body is recovered and then buried by his allies. The final storyline was written by Terry Kavanagh and with art by Stephen Platt, who was then hired by Image Comics based on the strength of his work during several of the series&#x27; final issues.

===Volume 3===
In 1998, the 4-issue mini-series &quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 3 was published under writer Doug Moench, artist Tommy Edwards, and inker Robert Campanella. The four part story &quot;Resurrection Wars&quot; shows Marc Spector resurrected again by Khonshu, materializing alive and well in his home while experiencing a vision of himself rising from the grave as Khonshu summons him. Witnessing Marc&#x27;s sudden manifestation in his home, and noting that the Statue of Khonshu explodes only to then repair itself, Marlene finally believes Khonshu is real and not a delusion. Despite this, the story mentions the possibility that Marc was not dead but somehow and inexplicably was put into a &quot;death-like&quot; state for months as a result of his previous injuries.

===Volume 4===
In 1999, Moench and artist Mark Texeira produced &quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 4. This four-part mini-series was nominated for the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Award for Favorite Limited Series. The title of the story was mistakenly given as &quot;High Strangers&quot; on each issue cover, while the correct title &quot;High Strangeness&quot; appeared on the interior title page of each issue.

===Volume 5===
A new ongoing series, &quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 5, was launched in April 2006, written by Charlie Huston with art by David Finch. The series revises Marc Spector&#x27;s history by saying he fought in the Gulf War. Starting with issue #14 of this series, Mike Benson took over writing duties while Huston acted as a story/plot adviser according to Benson. The 2006 series ended with #30 (July 2009), and only one Annual issue for the series was printed in 2008. Peter Milligan wrote a 2008 seasonal one-shot titled &quot;Moon Knight: Silent Knight&quot; with artist Laurence Campbell.

===&quot;Vengeance of the Moon Knight&quot;===
In September 2009, a new series titled &quot;Vengeance of the Moon Knight&quot; began by writer Gregg Hurwitz and artist Jerome Opena. &quot;Vengeance of the Moon Knight&quot; ended with issue #10. Moon Knight became a regular team cast member in &quot;Secret Avengers&quot; #1–21. In &quot;Secret Avengers&quot;, writer Warren Ellis introduced the idea that Moon Knight sometimes operates without a costume and instead wearing a simple white suit and full white mask. Moon Knight also appeared in the &quot;Shadowland&quot; crossover and in the 2010 relaunch of &quot;Heroes for Hire&quot;.

===Volume 6===
In 2011, the series &quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 6 was launched by Brian Michael Bendis and Alex Maleev. The series depicted Moon Knight once again experiencing four alters, though now three of his alters were imitations of Spider-Man, Captain America, and Wolverine. Due to poor sales, the series was canceled after 12 issues.

===Volume 7===
In March 2014, the Marvel NOW! initiative launched &quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 7. The series involved rotating creative teams that included Warren Ellis and Declan Shalvey for issues #1–6, Brian Wood and Greg Smallwood for issues #7–12, and Cullen Bunn and Ron Ackins for issues #13–17. The series brings back the white suit and tie outfit first seen in &quot;Secret Avengers&quot;, and now has Moon Knight adopt this outfit when working as a police consultant, answering to &quot;Mr. Knight.&quot; With issue #1 of this series, writer Warren Ellis confirmed that Khonshu is a real god or extraterrestrial entity and that Marc Spector indeed died and was resurrected years ago in the tomb in Egypt.

Issue #1 of this series depicted a psychologist confirming that stress and the use of multiple cover identities cannot cause someone to suffer from DID if they did not already suffer from the condition and that Marc&#x27;s symptoms do not correspond to actual DID. Marc Spector&#x27;s different alters are now said to be due to &quot;brain damage,&quot; alterations to his brain made by the alien entity Khonshu that connect their minds. These alterations also cause Moon Knight to sometimes shift his personality to match one of the moon god&#x27;s four distinct roles and facets. These four roles are described as: &quot;pathfinder&quot;, &quot;embracer&quot;, &quot;defender&quot;, and &quot;watcher of overnight travelers.&quot; These four roles can manifest in different ways, either with original names or borrowing names and personality traits of people Marc has observed (such as when he briefly acted as if he were Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Captain America).

===Volume 8===
In April 2016, the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; initiative included the new series &quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 8. Written by Jeff Lemire and artist Greg Smallwood (returning from his run with Brian Wood), the series began having rotating artists with issue #6. After fourteen issues, the series numbering changed to acknowledge it was a continuation of the Moon Knight volumes published before, so issue #15 was instead given the designation #188. This renumbering was done as part of the company-wide Marvel Legacy initiative. The series ended with issue #200, which involved contributions from several previously established Moon Knight artists. In 2019, Cullen Bunn wrote and Ibrahim Mustafa and Matt Horak drew &quot;Moon Knight Annual&quot; #1.

Lemire&#x27;s stories revised Marc&#x27;s history to show he had first exhibited symptoms of DID and assumed the identity of his alter Steven Grant while still a young boy. The series also showed Khonshu creating a psychic connection between himself and Marc Spector when the latter was still a boy, indicating the moon god may still be responsible for Marc&#x27;s DID-like condition. In the series, Khonshu claims he influenced Marc at times over the years, waiting until years later to fully reveal himself. Khonshu then reveals he intends to use Marc as a host body, fully dominating his personality, but Marc refuses. The series has Marc acknowledge that he had exhibited DID symptoms long before assuming the mask of Moon Knight and that his previous claim that his alters were nothing more than cover identities was simply denial of his condition.

In &quot;Avengers&quot; vol. 8 #33–38 (Marvel Comics, 2020), Khonshu attempts to dominate Earth to save it, compelling Moon Knight to help him. A battle with the Avengers results in Khonshu being imprisoned by the Asgardians. The story was produced by Jason Aaron, Javier Garron, and Jason Keith.

===Volume 9===
In 2021, the series &quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 9 launched under writer Jed MacKay, and artists Alessandro Cappuccio and Rachelle Rosenberg. The new series has Marc Spector not only acting as the crimefighter Moon Knight but also (despite his Jewish background) adopting the role of high priest of &quot;the Midnight Mission,&quot; a congregation dedicated to Khonshu. In discussing his connection to Khonshu, Marc Spector now describes his four aspects as &quot;the traveler,&quot; &quot;the pathfinder,&quot; &quot;the embracer,&quot; and &quot;the defender of those who travel at night.&quot; Once again, Marc Spector is depicted as being in regular therapy with a psychologist to help manage his psychological issues. The series also offers that Marc Spector may be immortal, as he has now been literally resurrected on multiple occasions and could be resurrected again in the future. The volume concluded with issue 30 in December 2023 with the storyline &quot;The Last Days of Moon Knight&quot;.

===&quot;Moon Knight: Black, White, and Blood&quot;===
In April 2022 an anthology series &quot;Moon Knight: Black, White, and Blood&quot; was released alongside the Disney+ series with various stories by creative teams Jonathan Hickman and Chris Bachalo; Marc Guggenheim and artist Jorge Fornes; and writer Murewa Ayodele and Dotun Akanda.

=== &quot;Vengeance of the Moon Knight Vol. 2&quot; ===
In September 2023, it was announced that MacKay and Cappuccio would be continuing their Moon Knight saga with &quot;Vengeance of the Moon Knight&quot;, with a new Moon Knight emerging following the death of Marc Spector. The series debuted in January 2024.

=== &quot;Phases of the Moon Knight&quot; ===
In August 2024, Marvel released an anthology series called &quot;Phases of the Moon Knight&quot;, which is an anthology series that follows previous Fists of Khonshu, including during the Crusades and other historical periods. Writers and authors change each issue, like with Red, White, and Blood&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Born in Chicago, Marc Spector is the Jewish-American son of Elias Spector, a rabbi who survived Nazi persecution. In the Othervoid, a realm outside of normal time and space, the entity Khonshu (once worshipped as a moon god by the people of Ancient Egypt) becomes interested in Marc. Khonshu and those like him cannot leave the Othervoid without great difficulty but can create psychic connections with hosts and avatars in the physical universe of Earth. Believing Marc Spector to have a &quot;weak mind&quot; that makes him vulnerable to psychic connection, Khonshu chooses the boy to one day act as his knight and avatar. After Khonshu chooses Marc, the boy discovers by chance that Rabbi Yitz Perlman, a close friend of his family, is really a Nazi named Ernst who continues to target and murder Jews. Marc fights Perlman and escapes. Perlman then disappears without a trace.

Soon afterward, Marc Spector begins showing signs of dissociative identity disorder. Marc believes he meets and befriends a boy named Steven Grant, not realizing he himself is acting as Steven at times. In a vision, Marc sees Khonshu promising to one day heal the boy&#x27;s mind. Khonshu, being an entity who has multiple aspects to his personality and exists out of phase with normal time and space, later claims that Marc&#x27;s alters are the result of his mind trying to echo the moon god&#x27;s own multi-faceted nature.

As a teenager, Marc exhibits another alter in addition to Steven named Jake Lockley. The appearance of this third alter leads Marc&#x27;s parents to send him to live at Putnam Psychiatric Hospital. Released to attend his father&#x27;s funeral, Marc escapes and joins the U.S. Marine Corps, where he becomes a formidable combatant and a trained heavy-weight boxer. After Marc serves three years in Force Recon, the Marines discover he lied on his paperwork and conclude his history of mental illness makes him &quot;unfit for duty&quot;. He is discharged and earns a living as an underground boxer and fighter in Baghdad until he is recruited by French pilot and mercenary Jean-Paul &quot;Frenchie&quot; DuChamp. The two work together on several assignments. During this time, Spector encounters CIA operative Jason Macendale, who later becomes the costumed mercenary Jack O&#x27;Lantern and then becomes the second villain to adopt the name Hobgoblin. Marc&#x27;s brother Randall Spector becomes a mercenary as well, but is driven by bloodlust. In Italy, Randall kills Marc&#x27;s girlfriend Lisa. After a violent confrontation, Marc leaves Randall for dead. Randall later recovers from his injuries.

Eventually, Frenchie and Marc meet mercenary Raoul Bushman, who is impressed by their work and recruits them to help with certain jobs. Spector considers that morally he exists in the center between Frenchie, a good man with a firm moral center, and Bushman, a ruthless, often amoral man who takes pride in his ability to kill. Spector and Frenchie accept a contract with Bushman helping a local warlord in the Sudan quell a rebellion. One of the rebels they shoot down is Marc&#x27;s own brother Randall, though Marc is unaware of this and does not even know that Randall is in the area. Despite his bullet wounds, Randall survives, convinced Marc recognized him and deliberately tried to kill him.

Marc Spector is appalled at Bushman&#x27;s bloodlust and that he targets civilians as well as enemy combatants. Bushman kills Dr. Peter Alraune, an archeologist whose team (which includes his daughter Marlene Alraune) recently unearthed a hidden tomb. Bushman intends to loot the tomb and kill any witnesses. Spector scares off Marlene, saving her life, and then engages Bushman in combat. Defeated, Spector is injured and abandoned in the desert without food or shelter, suffering in the freezing temperature of the night. Despite this, he makes his way back to civilization before collapsing, near-death. Locals carry him into the tomb and leave him before a statue of Khonshu, moon god and protector of travelers at night. Marlene realizes Marc saved her life earlier and prepares to mourn him as his heart stops. Moments later, Marc Spector revives, fully healed. He claims to have seen the moon god Khonshu and been chosen to now act as the moon&#x27;s &quot;knight of vengeance&quot;, the &quot;fist of Khonshu&quot;. Marlene believes this was a dream or delusion. Marc takes a silver, hooded cloak from the statue of Khonshu, adopting it as his own. Randall watches this all from nearby. As soon as Marc leaves, Randall presents himself to the same statue of Khonshu, hoping to also be blessed with power and have his wounds healed. When nothing happens, he resents Marc for winning the moon god&#x27;s favor instead.

=== &quot;Werewolf By Night, Hulk!&quot; Magazine&quot;, Moon Knight&quot; vol. 1 (1975–1984) ===
After confronting and defeating Bushman, Spector returns to America with Frenchie, now joined by Marlene and determined to become a crimefighter called Moon Knight, adopting a white and silver kevlar bodysuit coupled with Khonshu&#x27;s hooded cloak. When asked why he would wear white and silver while operating at night, Moon Knight answers he is meant to be a light in the darkness and that he and Khonshu want their enemies to know he is coming. To fund his activities and gain influence in business, Spector uses his Steven Grant identity to start a business and make some careful investments, turning his mercenary profits into a small fortune. Buying a mansion for his home base, Spector/Grant then funds the creation of crimefighting equipment and weaponry, including the &quot;Moon Copter.&quot; To help gain knowledge from street criminals and civilians, Marc becomes a taxicab driver as Jake Lockley. Lockley quickly makes friends with diner manager Gena Landers, and her sons Ray and Rick. Ray, a pilot, later becomes an ally of Moon Knight, piloting the Moon Copter when Frenchie is unavailable. Moon Knight also befriends Bertrand Crawley, a former textbook salesperson who is now homeless and operates as a street informant.

Learning of the criminal network known as the Committee, Moon Knight accepts an assignment from the group and pretends to agree with their agenda. Armed with silver weaponry, Moon Knight is sent to fight the werewolf Jack Russell in Los Angeles. After capturing the werewolf, Moon Knight later frees him and together they halt the Committee&#x27;s plans. Moon Knight then battles a variety of enemies and criminals, some on his own, some while teaming-up with heroes such as Spider-Man, Daredevil, Dr. Strange, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four. His own brother Randall, having recovered from their last fight, embarks on a career as the Hatchet-Man, an axe-wielding serial killer who targets women. Moon Knight fights the Hatchet-Man, who seemingly dies during their battle. Years later, Moon Knight learned that the Hatchet-Man who died was an impostor. Randall had used drugs and psychological manipulation to convince the impostor he was the real Randall Spector, even having him undergo plastic surgery so they would be identical. Having faked his death, Randall hides and plans his next move against Marc.

During one adventure, Spector encounters the Midnight Man, a thief named Anton Mogart who steals for the thrill and wears a black costume resembling Moon Knight&#x27;s own suit. During his battle with Moon Knight, Midnight Man falls into the New York River, seemingly to his death. In truth, he survives but his face is deformed by acidic sewage. Swearing vengeance, Midnight Man joins forces with Bushman and lures Moon Knight into a trap. Moon Knight survives and Midnight Man escapes again. Later, after gaining a greater sense of peace with his past and his deceased father, Marc Spector decides to largely retire his Moon Knight identity and focus on living a quieter life with Marlene at his side.

=== &quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 2 &quot;Fist of Khonshu&quot; and &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot; (1985–1989) ===
Marlene and Marc Spector set up Spector International Galleries, an art business that curates and organizes collections and exhibits. When Marc Spector has visions of Khonshu summoning him, he decides to return to Egypt and investigate. Convinced Marc is delusional and only thinks he sees visions and hears voices, Marlene leaves him. In Egypt, Spector meets priests of Khonshu who supply him with a new arsenal of moon-themed weaponry and declare he will now be a true vengeance avatar, the Fist of Khonshu. The moon god then blesses him with increased strength depending on how much moon light shines down on Earth. With his new power and weapons, Moon Knight defeats a villainous priest of Anubis, god of death.

After returning to America, Moon Knight works with the newly formed West Coast Avengers, although this distances him even further from Frenchie and Marlene. He time travels to 2940 BC to rescue the Avengers, where he gains replacement weapons designed by fellow Avenger Hawkeye. He then officially joins the West Coast Avengers and enters a brief romantic relationship with Tigra. Moon Knight and the Avengers are later attacked by soldiers working for Khonshu&#x27;s rival, Seth, who is invading Asgard. Khonshu abandons Moon Knight to battle Seth. He then explains it was his wish that Spector join the Avengers and so he influenced Moon Knight&#x27;s mind to do so. Following Seth&#x27;s defeat, Moon Knight resigns from the team. Moon Knight also gives up the Egyptian themed replacement weapons designed by Hawkeye. This act of independence, and his defiance to remain in the Avengers simply because Khonshu wishes it, evidently causes Marc to lose his lunar-based superhuman strength as punishment.

===&quot;Marc Spector: Moon Knight&quot; (1989–1994)===
After reuniting with Marlene and Frenchie, Marc Spector sets up a new home in a mansion in South Hampton, Long Island, NY, expands his business into Spector Enterprises, and resumes his activities as Moon Knight. Soon afterward, he and the Black Cat cross paths with a new thief Midnight who wears the costume of the Midnight Man. Moon Knight learns the thief is 18-year-old Jeffrey Wilde, son of Anton Mogart. Wilde reveals Mogart discovered he had contracted cancer due to the same chemicals that disfigured him and spent his final days in a hospice, where Wilde tracked him down. The two bonded and learned from each other. Following Mogart&#x27;s death, Wilde adopted his father&#x27;s costume and performed dynamic thefts to impress Moon Knight, hoping to convince the hero to let him become his sidekick. As Midnight, Wilde hopes to make up for his father&#x27;s criminal past while finding his own purpose in life.

Despite Moon Knight&#x27;s protests that he does not need a sidekick, Midnight follows him into new adventures and is able to gain some training during adventures with the Punisher and with the mercenaries Silver Sable, Sandman, and Paladin. Over time, Wilde concludes that Moon Knight&#x27;s ethics and methods are too much responsibility and that he prefers to pursue excitement. He grows to resent Moon Knight, believing the hero owes him more respect and is responsible for the death of his father (since their battle indirectly led to Mogart being exposed to toxic chemicals).

Marc Spector is kidnapped and brought to the country of Bosqueverde in South America. He is put on trial for his actions while acting as a mercenary during a previous regime change, including causing the death of Ricardo Dominguez, the previous president whom Spector instinctively shot in self defense when the man reached for a gun. Marlene leads a rescue effort with Frenchie. Left alone in New York City, Jeff Wilde performs thefts using Moon Knight&#x27;s costume and equipment and stumbles onto a meeting between members of the Secret Empire terrorist cult. He barely escapes. In Bosqueverde, Spector is found guilty but is able to bargain with the new regime and have his sentence overturned.

Wilde runs into Spider-Man, who realizes he is an impostor. Panicking, Wilde tries to escape only to then be hunted by the Secret Empire. He is saved by Spider-Man and the real Moon Knight. Angry that he panicked and determined to prove himself, Wilde challenges one of the Secret Empire leaders, Number VI, to attack him. Number VI strikes Wilde with an energy blade that burns his body instantly. The Secret Empire then takes Wilde away, leading Moon Knight to pursue, aided by Spider-Man and the Punisher. After facing several Secret Empire agents, the heroes are told that Jeff Wilde died from his injuries and computer records confirm it. In truth, the Secret Empire rebuilds Wilde as a cyborg so he can be their living weapon. Blaming Moon Knight for his injuries and abandoning him, as well as for his father&#x27;s death, Wilde swears revenge. Meanwhile, Moon Knight resumes his activities, feeling guilty that he may have been able to prevent Wilde&#x27;s death if he had acted differently or had been a better influence on the boy.

Moon Knight encounters members of the Knights of the Moon, soldiers of a rogue faction of the Cult of Khonshu. This particular cell of the Knights of the Moon are led by Plasma, a mutant terrorist they believe to be the true chosen champion of Khonshu. Plasma is determined to convince different groups and cults she is their messiah, chosen by various gods, so she can then use her new followers to achieve global domination. Together with Ghost Rider, Moon Knight defeats Plasma&#x27;s soldiers. Plasma inadvertently causes her own death when she does not heed Moon Knight&#x27;s warning. The experience shakes Moon Knight, leading him to question if he is also misguided in his belief that he follows the will of Khonshu.

While fighting the lethal vigilante Stained-Glass Scarlet, Moon Knight is seriously injured and then falls into New York&#x27;s East River from the top of the Brooklyn Bridge. After making impact with the water, Marc experiences visions of both Khonshu and his father, leading him to realize Khonshu is not limited to vengeance and is also a god of justice, offering people redemption just as he was offered the chance to be a hero after years of being a mercenary. Emerging from the water, Marc has already partially recovered from his knife wound. He believes he died from his injuries and the fall but that Khonshu resurrected him once again. Seeing himself now as a light in the darkness rather than simply a warrior, Marc shares his personal story with Scarlet, offering sympathy and redemption if she gives up her crusade and turns herself into the authorities. Believing she has failed God and is unworthy of redemption, Scarlet leaps to her death.

Moon Knight learns from Spider-Man that Jeff Wilde AKA Midnight is alive, now operating as a cyborg warrior for the Secret Empire. Believing Wilde is not in his right mind and can be redeemed, Moon Knight tries to rescue him, fighting the Secret Empire alongside the heroes Spider-Man, Darkhawk, the Punisher, Nova and Night Thrasher. Encouraged by his nurse Lynn Church (whom he is now in love with), Wilde attempts a coup so he can lead the Secret Empire. During a final climactic battle, Wilde realizes that Lynn Church has been manipulating him and sees him as a weapon. Once again feeling betrayed by those he put faith in, Wilde destroys the Secret Empire&#x27;s main base in New York City, seemingly killing himself and Church in the process. Moon Knight once again mourns Wilde, regretting that he did not know how to reach the young man.

Moon Knight encounters Jason Macendale (Hobgoblin) while the mercenary is possessed by a demon (an entity later called Demogoblin). During the encounter, the demon infects Moon Knight with a demonic parasite. Unaware of the infection, Moon Knight continues his crime-fighting activities. He and the Punisher encounter the renegade branch of the Cult of Khonshu again and its new leader Sandal Swarn, a former CIA operative who now calls herself Princess Nepthys, a former CIA operative and the lover of Randall Spector. Using mind-control techniques she learned in the CIA, she was able to convince an impostor to assume Randall&#x27;s identity as the Hatchet-Man and fight Moon Knight, leading to the man&#x27;s death. Assuming a leadership role in the Cult of Khonshu following Plasma&#x27;s death, Nepthys declares that Randall will be Khonshu&#x27;s true knight of vengeance. Randall and Nepthys destroy Moon Knight&#x27;s house in a bombing that leaves Frenchie paralyzed. Calling himself ShadowKnight, Randall undergoes experimental treatment by Nepthys that gives him superhuman resiliency to injury thanks to a shell over his skin. During their battle, Moon Knight sees an ancient scroll that seems to confirm Khonshu is dedicated to justice rather than vengeance. Moon Knight is able to crack ShadowKnight&#x27;s shell with an adamantium weapon. Punisher executes Nepthys and later unleashes heavy gunfire on ShadowKnight, who suffers extensive internal injuries before then suffering a seemingly fatal fall.

Following the destruction of his home, Marc Spector sets up a new &quot;ShadowKeep&quot; lair in the Lower West Side of Manhattan, nearby SpectorCorp headquarters. To advise him on his operations, his council &quot;the Shadow Cabinet&quot; meet at the ShadowKeep via holographic transmission and use codenames. The Shadow Cabinet includes tech expert Stash, business woman Penny Annie, low-level crime boss Don G, and psychologist Sigmund, who also acts as Marc&#x27;s therapist.

Soon afterward, the demonic parasite in his body causes Marc&#x27;s strength to steadily increase even as his health and physical form deteriorate. To compensate for his health problems, he exchanges his kevlar Moon Knight armor for a new suit of light-weight adamantium armor right before he illegally enters the consulate of Latveria to confront the country&#x27;s monarch Doctor Doom. The Avengers, a team that relies on cooperation with the US government and the United Nations, learn Moon Knight gained help in invading the consulate by showing his credentials as an Avengers reservist and implying he was on an official mission. During the &quot;Infinity War&quot; event, Moon Knight fights an alien-created doppleganger called Moon Shade who then absorbs the life force of different Moon Knights from parallel realities. This leads Moon Knight to meet a few of his multiversal counterparts, including the crime-fighting dynamic duo known as MoonMan and MoonBoy.

Following the Infinity War, Doctor Strange and Mister Fantastic operate on Moon Knight and remove the parasite. Moon Knight is warned it will not be certain until 48 hours have passed whether or not the damage done by the parasite is fatal. Marc Spector contemplates who could be the new Moon Knight if he dies. After deciding two candidates chosen by his &quot;legacy quest&quot; program are not suitable, Spector tries to recruit photojournalist Peter Parker, not realizing the young man is also Spider-Man. After Parker declines, Moon Knight gives up finding a successor. He is relieved when the 48 hour mark passes and his health remains stable. A side effect seems to be that his eyes now have a crescent-moon mark over the irises (though this mutation vanishes in later stories). Afterward, the Avengers confront Moon Knight about his abuse of his team reservist status to confront Doctor Doom. The hero decides to simplify matters by resigning his membership and burning his Avengers ID card.

A technological villain called Seth the Immortal and his &quot;Zero Hour&quot; program threaten Moon Knight and all his allies. During a desperate battle, Moon Knight defeats Seth by blowing up his office with both of them inside, sacrificing himself in the process. Marlene is present and holds him as he dies. He is buried by his friends on the grounds of the estate he purchased as Steven Grant.

===&quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 3 – &quot;Resurrection Wars&quot;; &quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 4 – &quot;High Strangeness&quot;===
When the god Seth selects his own avatar to act on Earth and perform acts of destruction, Khonshu responds. Marc Spector wakes up in his grave and has a vision of being tasked with resuming his life as a champion of the moon. In the mansion of Steven Grant, Marlene and Frenchie witness a statue of Khonshu seemingly explode, revealing a living and fully healed Marc Spector. Marc&#x27;s latest resurrection (his third) and the fact that the Khonshu statue magically returns, fully repaired, finally convinces Marlene that Moon Knight does not suffer delusions and is in fact the chosen avatar of the moon god.

For a time, Moon Knight decides to allow the world to continue believing Marc Spector is dead and chooses instead to focus on his other identities of Moon Knight, Steven Grant, and Jake Lockley. Despite this, news surfaces that Marc Spector is alive, leading to assassination attempts.

===&quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 5 (2006–2009)===
For reasons unexplained, Moon Knight abandons his belief that his role includes understanding his enemies and offering redemption and now acts with greater violence and brutality. Defeating Bushman after a vicious battle, Moon Knight goes further by carving off the villain&#x27;s face. Spector is then haunted by Khonshu, who chooses a faceless Bushman as his representation. Frenchie reveals he is homosexual or bisexual and that he has been so loyal to Marc in part because he is in love with him, though he knows these feelings are not felt in return.

The new Secret Committee hires the Profile, who has superhuman analytical skills, to help trap Moon Knight. After the plan fails, Profile becomes a reluctant confidante and source of information for Spector himself. Around this time, some heroes take notice that Moon Knight is now more violent and ruthless and attempt to speak to him about it. Moon Knight discovers his would-be sidekick Midnight may still be alive. Moon Knight is later forced into a final confrontation with Midnight. No longer attempting reconciliation, Moon Knight seemingly kills him for good.

The new Superhero Registration Act, enforced by registered heroes such as Iron Man, requires superhumans and costumed champions to register as agents of the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. or be imprisoned. After prodding from Khonshu, Moon Knight reluctantly registers, not wanting authorities to interfere with his agenda. To be approved for registration requires a psychiatric exam. Believing Moon Knight to be mentally unstable and thinking he could become worse if he finds himself in conflict with the Registration Act or its enforcement, Tony Stark and the government have no intention of granting Marc Spector approval. The psychiatrist agrees and is about to make the decision official, even suggesting possible future imprisonment. Spector then seems to speak in the voice of Khonshu and points out the doctor&#x27;s own antisocial tendencies (as told to Moon Knight earlier by the Profile). The psychiatrist gives Moon Knight a pass on his exam and literally bows in deference to Khonshu.

Moon Knight shows little regard for his registration status or his registered colleagues. Carson Knowles, the Black Spectre, steals Stark nanotechnology and attempts to frame him for murder. Moon Knight later confronts Knowles and pushes him off a rooftop, apparently causing a fatal fall. Iron Man revokes Moon Knight&#x27;s registration and buries the fact that Black Spectre stole his technology. Rather than be imprisoned as an unregistered vigilante, Marc Spector gives up his role as Moon Knight but continues to fight crime clandestinely while wearing an entirely black costume. He considers that crimefighting is easier without the use of an alias or &quot;costume recognition.&quot; After realizing this change in methodology means he no longer has the insight and protection of Khonshu, he pleads for the moon god&#x27;s forgiveness only to be told in a vision that he is no longer needed when Khonshu has other, more faithful followers.

Despite having seemingly retired from vigilante activities, Moon Knight is targeted by the Thunderbolts, former villains led by Norman Osborn (the Green Goblin) who now act as enforcers of the Registration Act. To lure Moon Knight into resurfacing, the Thunderbolts arrange for the Whyos gang to attacks Frenchie&#x27;s restaurant, resulting in his lover Rob being injured. As hoped, Spector becomes Moon Knight again to avenge his friend. Spector fights the villain Bullseye, an operative of the Thunderbolts at this time. Moon Knight lures the assassin into a warehouse where he then sets off explosives. While Bullseye escapes, it is believed Moon Knight was killed, leading Iron Man to publicly denounce the Thunderbolts and its methods, blaming the group for the explosion. Jake Lockley, having now resurfaced and become the dominant alter, relocates to Mexico. After hiding for a time, Lockley crosses paths with local Mexican criminal cartels and encounters the Punisher again, as well as an avatar of Toltec.

In the U.S., the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. is shut down and replaced by H.A.M.M.E.R., led by Norman Osborn. Concerned about Osborn now being in charge of enforcing, imprisoning, and controlling registered superheroes, Lockley decides to adopt the Moon Knight identity again and return to NYC.

===&quot;Vengeance of the Moon Knight&quot; (2009–2010)===
Returning to New York, Lockley regrets Moon Knight&#x27;s recent acts of ruthlessness. He tries to make amends to Marlene and Frenchie for his recent behavior. Determined Moon Knight must again be more heroic, he decides never to kill enemies or cause more injury than necessary in the future. Khonshu, now taking the form of a man in the Moon Knight costume with a bird skull, tests Lockley&#x27;s resolve by repeatedly goading him to kill his foes. Moon Knight&#x27;s efficient crimefighting and non-lethal tactics quickly gain favor with New York&#x27;s population, angering Norman Osborn who resents failing to capture and imprison the hero before. Osborn hires the villains the Hood and Profile to take down Moon Knight. Using power borrowed from the demonic sorcerer Dormammu, the Hood resurrects Raoul Bushman.

Bushman and the villain Scarecrow break into Ravencroft Asylum where they perform brain surgery on several patients, then manipulate them into attacking New York City. After quelling the attack, Moon Knight subdues Bushman. Despite Khonshu demanding lethal vengeance, Moon Knight spares Bushman&#x27;s life, satisfied the villain will be incarcerated.

=== &quot;Secret Avengers&quot; (2010–2012) ===
After ordering an attack on Asgard and having his corruption and insanity exposed, Norman Osborn is removed from power. In the wake of H.A.M.M.E.R. being dissolved, the Registration Act is undone, meaning Moon Knight and other unregistered heroes are no longer fugitives. Steve Rogers, the original Captain America, recruits Moon Knight to the new team Secret Avengers, with Steven Grant becoming the dominant identity. On one mission, Moon Knight adopts a simple white suit and mask rather than his usual body armor and hooded cape.

During the events of &quot;Shadowland&quot;, the hero Daredevil is possessed by the Beast, a demon worshipped by the ninja assassin clan known as The Hand. Moon Knight joins a group of heroes on an assault on Daredevil&#x27;s Shadowland fortress. Daredevil almost kills Moon Knight, but Khonshu appears and asks Marc&#x27;s life be spared. Daredevil is able to see the moon god and concedes, leaving Moon Knight. Khonshu then reveals he needs Moon Knight to track down an artifact called the Sapphire Crescent. He must also fight and likely kill Randall Spector, who is still alive and operating as Shadow Knight again. Moon Knight and Shadow Knight track down the Sapphire Crescent in New Orleans. During another battle, Randall threatens a hostage. Seeing no other choice, Moon Knight uses the Sapphire Crescent against his brother to save the hostage, killing Randall in the process. Jake Lockley suffers a mental breakdown as a result, going dormant as the host, Marc Spector, becomes dominant again.

===&quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 6 (2011–12)===
Marc Spector relocates to Los Angeles and creates a TV show based on his own exploits called &quot;Legends of the Khonshu&quot;. Secretly, he continues fighting crime as Moon Knight. But now, along with existing as Marc/Moon Knight, he also displays three new alters based on imitating the personalities of Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Steve Rogers. Moon Knight teams up with the superhero Echo against Count Nefaria. Nefaria strikes back and Echo is killed. This sends Moon Knight&#x27;s Wolverine alter into a berserker rage, seemingly causing the deaths of Marc&#x27;s alters based on Captain America and Spider-Man.

Moon Knight fights Nefaria and his daughter Madame Masque, then shows a new alter based on the personality of Echo, who asks that she not die in vain. After further battle, Moon Knight summons the Avengers for help and Nefaria is defeated. Iron Man commends Marc Spector. After he leaves, Spector seems to develop a new alter based on Iron Man&#x27;s personality as well. In the epilogue to the series, Spector leaves Los Angeles.

===&quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; (2012)===
During the events of the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, Moon Knight is partnered with a small team of Avengers and battles some members of the X-Men team. At one point, Moon Knight grabs Rogue with his bare hand. Able to absorb the memories, powers, and life force of those she makes skin-to-skin contact with, Rogue experiences temporary madness as she absorbs the perspectives of Marc Spector&#x27;s different alters. Later, Moon Knight is invited to Stark Tower to celebrate the return of Janet van Dyne, who had been thought killed in battle years before.

===&quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 7 (2014–2015)===
Spector returns to New York. His identity and past now a matter of public record, Marc regularly utilizes two versions of the Moon Knight identity. When engaging in battle with high-tech equipment, he dons a new Moon Knight body armor and sometimes uses shamanic tools of Khonshu such as an enchanted skull helmet. When dealing with crime scene investigation and consulting openly with law enforcement, Spector dons only his mask and the white business suit he briefly wore during his time with the Secret Avengers, calling himself Mr. Knight.

Deciding he needs to manage his mental health better, Marc Spector meets with a psychologist who determines that he does not have dissociative identity disorder (DID) as some have hypothesized in the past or some form of schizophrenia. In truth, he has a form of brain damage due to his brain being physically altered by Khonshu, who is a real entity from another world or dimension and altered Marc to create a conduit between them. Marc&#x27;s different personalities are a result of his mind adjusting to the four different aspects of Khonshu&#x27;s nature and aspects. It is why he sometimes has four alters existing simultaneously but never more. Moon Knight encounters another renegade Cult of Khonshu, though this cell targets the homeless and other marginalized people, making them new cult members as well or using them as human sacrifices.

===&quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 8 (2016–2017)===
Marc Spector wakes up in a mental institute with no recollection of his past or how he got there. The staff, led by Dr. Emmet, seems to have supernatural powers and thwart Marc&#x27;s attempts to recover his past. Marc is shown evidence that he is a mentally ill man who has convinced himself he is also Moon Knight, a vigilante he has seen on the news. Khonshu contacts Marc and explains that Emmet is an avatar like him, one who is connected to the Othervoid god Ammit. Khonshu decides it is now time for him to completely dominate Marc Spector&#x27;s body. Marc denies Khonshu and fights him with the help of all of his alters. Marc accepts that whether they are the result of childhood trauma or Khonshu&#x27;s interference, his alters are a part of him and have been for most of his life. After defeating Emmet and Khonshu, Marc resumes his life as Moon Knight, determined to be a protector and crime-fighter on his own terms rather than as a tool of anyone else. Later, Marc and Khonshu resume their bond.

===&quot;Crazy Runs in the Family&quot; (2018)===
After re-appropriating Khonshu, Marc Spector resumes his normal life and his Moon Knight activities. Raoul Bushman collaborates with a mysterious mental patient only referred to as &quot;Patient 86&quot;, who becomes an avatar of Ra and calls himself the Sun King. Together they come up with a plot to kill Moon Knight. To accomplish their plan, Bushman and Sun King go to Marlene&#x27;s house and discovered she and Jake Lockley had a child together, a revelation that shocks Marc Spector and Steven Grant. Raoul and Sun King then kidnap Marlene and lure Moon Knight to an island base. With Khonshu&#x27;s guidance, Moon Knight is able to overpower Sun King, although Bushman escapes.

=== &quot;The Age of Khonshu&quot; ===
Deciding to take over Earth to protect it, Khonshu compels Moon Knight to acquire power for him. With enhanced abilities and insight, and convinced that Khonshu&#x27;s plan is the only way to protect Earth from the demon lord Mephisto and others, Moon Knight takes the power of Iron Fist, Ghost Rider&#x27;s hellfire, Thor&#x27;s hammer Mjolnir, and some of Dr. Strange&#x27;s magic. With this and more, Khonshu begins to reshape Earth. During a battle with the Black Panther, Moon Knight temporarily becomes a host for the cosmic Phoenix Force. But rather than allow the Phoenix power to &quot;cleanse&quot; the Earth by wiping out humanity, Moon Knight releases the power even while the Avengers defeat Khonshu. The Asgardians imprison Khonshu and Moon Knight is allowed to return to his activities. The Black Panther offers him membership in the Avengers again, but he refuses, preferring to focus on battles he understands and angry at Khonshu&#x27;s extreme actions.

=== &quot;Moon Knight&quot; vol. 9 (2021) ===
Despite believing that Khonshu is a god unworthy of his worship, Marc Spector still considers himself to be spiritually connected to the deity, and decides to continue acting not only as a knight of the moon god but also as a priest of his teachings. He creates the Midnight Mission, a religious congregation following the teachings of Khonshu. As its high priest, Marc adopts his Mr. Knight suit and mask as his official religious vestments. Living at the Midnight Mission, he offers aid to listen to anyone who visits and needs his help. As Moon Knight, Spector frees several people who were kidnapped by vampires and unwillingly made into vampires themselves. Rather than condemn them, he offers them sympathy. One of the new vampires, a woman named Reese, takes a job as Marc&#x27;s assistant at the Midnight Mission.

He crosses paths with Dr. Badr/Hunter&#x27;s Moon, who proclaims himself to be the second fist of Khonshu and believes that Moon Knight&#x27;s path must be &quot;corrected&#x27; after straying from Khonshu&#x27;s methods of vengeance. After defeating Hunter&#x27;s Moon in combat, Moon Knight confronts enemies sent after him by the villain Zodiac, leading to a direct confrontation between the two.

During the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; storyline, Mayor Wilson Fisk passes a law that outlaws superheroes. Moon Knight is the first to be apprehended by Thunderbolts members Agony, Electro II, Rhino, and U.S. Agent. While incarcerated in the Myrmidon, Marc Spector befriended a revived 8-Ball and took part in its prison fights.

During &quot;The Last Days of Moon Knight&quot; storyline, Moon Knight and his allies fought against a resurrected Robert Plesko who was reborn to be the latest incarnation of Black Spectre. Black Spectre badly wounded Moon Knight and revealed his plans to make the city go mad and kill itself. With Khonshu unable to help Moon Knight and vowing to be there for him in the afterlife, Moon Knight sees Steven Grant and Jake Lockley by his side and dies destroying the resonator control panel. The rest of the Midnight Mission plans to carry on without Moon Knight.

=== &quot;Vengeance of the Moon Knight&quot; vol. 2 (2024) ===
Following the death of Marc Spector, a new individual takes up the Moon Knight moniker. After coming into conflict with Spector&#x27;s allies running his Midnight Mission, he is eventually unmasked and revealed to be the Shroud.

During the &quot;Blood Hunt&quot; storyline, Moon Knight is revived by Khonshu after he was freed from his Asgardian prison by Tigra, Hunter&#x27;s Moon, and Wrecker. He leads some of the Fists of Khonshu to New York to help fight the vampires.

==Powers and abilities==
===Skills and training===
Moon Knight is an Olympic-level athlete and a skilled acrobat who excels at combat strategy. Spector is a superb driver and can pilot a helicopter. Thanks to his life experience and training as a U.S. Marine, boxer, and mercenary, Marc Spector became an expert at hand-to-hand combat, marksmanship, boxing, kung fu, eskrima, judo, karate, ninjutsu, savate, and Muay Thai. Moon Knight&#x27;s fighting style combines elements of various combat techniques and relies heavily on adaptability, using the environment to his advantage, intimidating his opponents, and accepting a certain level of pain and injury. The villain and mercenary Taskmaster, who can perfectly replicate fighting styles, has stated he prefers not to copy Moon Knight since the hero would sometimes rather take a punch than block or dodge it. Moon Knight is shown to possess a very high tolerance for pain and torture. Moon Knight is also an expert detective. Investigation is an important part of his stories, where he is often aided by his other personalities. Jake Lockley gathers information on the street level, Steven Grant among the rich and influential figures, and Mr. Knight works with the NYPD investigating police cases.

===Technology and equipment===
As Moon Knight, Spector typically wears lightweight, kevlar body armor and a specially constructed, silver glider-cape that can catch winds and thermal updrafts. He typically wears metal bracers on his wrists and calves. Later costumes have added metal plates providing extra protection to his chest and shoulders. Moon Knight employs a variety of weapons over the course of his career, many of which involve or are made of silver. His most commonly used weapons are his silver crescent-darts (some of which are blunt, some of which are blades) and an adamantium-reinforced truncheon that can fire a grappling hook and extend into a bō staff. At times, he has also used nunchaku and a compound bow. For a brief time, Moon Knight wore gauntlets with spiked knuckles.

At one point, Moon Knight accepted golden and ivory Egyptian-themed weapons created by followers of Khonshu. These included bolas, golden scarab-shaped darts, an ivory boomerang, throwing irons, an axe-shaped lasso-grapple, and a golden ankh-shaped blunt weapon which glowed in the presence of danger. These items were later replaced with duplicate weapons designed by Hawkeye.

In a period while suffering from health issues, Moon Knight adopts thin, lightweight adamantium armor for greater protection. During this time, he acquires an adamantium staff, a truncheon capable of firing a cable line, and gauntlets that fire crescent darts.

During the events of &quot;Dark Reign,&quot; the Tinkerer makes Moon Knight carbonadium armor with joint-locking functions, reinforcing his strength. Moon Knight uses this feature to support a building from collapsing, despite a lack of superhuman strength. Additionally, the armor could instantly assemble around his body after being triggered by remote control.

For transportation, Moon Knight employs a variety of sophisticated aircraft such as the Mooncopter and the Angelwing, a mini-jet featuring VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) and 20mm cannons. At times, Moon Knight has also used a white, customized motorcycle, a remote-controlled white limousine, and a remote-controlled crescent-shaped drone/glider capable of carrying a single person.

During the onset of the &quot;Age of Khonshu&quot; event, Marc was provided by the cult who worships his divinity with magical Ankhs that enabled him to drain away and utilize the primordial powers bestowed upon Earth&#x27;s Mightiest through their colorful prehistoric ancestry. Taking the powers of The Iron Fist from Daniel Rand, the vengeance spirit Zarathos from The Ghost Rider alongside his hellcharger, and the mystical abilities pertaining to the Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange. He acquired these with the intent of assimilating those of the Star Brand, the Phoenix Force and the Odin-Force-imbued Mjolnir belonging to All-Father Thor as well.

===Superpowers===
On more than one occasion, Marc Spector has died and then been resurrected by the other-dimensional entity Khonshu. It is not known if Khonshu will continually do this, making Marc Spector effectively immortal, or if he will only do this until he chooses a new champion.

Due to his brain being altered by Khonshu, Marc Spector is more resistant to telepathic and psychic attack than the average person. He sometimes experiences visions of prophecy or enhanced insight. Some initially believed these visions were delusions or inspired simply by Spector inadvertently performing self-hypnosis, but it is now known that Khonshu is real and grants him these visions. It has been implied in several stories that Marc&#x27;s connection to Khonshu and this supernatural insight increases when he wears his Moon Knight costume, as it represents &quot;vestments&quot; of the moon god. The villain-for-hire Profile has a superhuman analysis ability that does not function properly on beings with supernatural/magic-based abilities, and remarked that he found it painful to look at Marc Spector whenever the hero donned his Moon Knight costume. Profile was not sure if this was due to Spector&#x27;s mental illness or if wearing the costume helped Moon Knight tap directly into the moon god&#x27;s power.

During the time that Moon Knight adopted golden and ivory weapons (symbolizing his status as the Fist of Khonshu), his strength, endurance, and reflexes would increase depending on the phases of the moon, operating on a superhuman level during a full moon night. Even during a new moon, he can lift several hundred pounds. Although some believed this superhuman strength had nothing to do with Khonshu and was the result of self-hypnosis, it is now known that Khonshu is real and is directly connected to Marc Spector. Khonshu later removed this power from Moon Knight as punishment for disobedience and has never returned it.

After the &quot;Serpent War&quot;, Marc&#x27;s patron deity Khonshu opted to further empower his champion on Earth with all new abilities in preparation for the rise of Mephistopheles. By giving his herald the lion share of the moon supremacy&#x27;s power; Marc would be endowed with all the abilities of his namesake as the Fist of Khonshu along with a couple others outside of the criteria. He is granted the transformational capability to change to and from his costumed identity at will, on top of powers over lunar effects such as creating astral rock formations consisting of planetary orbital satellites, raising and commanding the dead; mummies loyal to his divinity, lunar empowerment under the supermoon created by Khonshu&#x27;s will and the ability to survive unaided in the cold recesses of space without life support. These powers gave Moon Knight enough raw might to battle and defeat the world&#x27;s most powerful heroes, the Avengers.

For a brief time, Moon Knight became a host avatar for the immortal Phoenix Force, the cosmological raptor that governs life, death and rebirth throughout the universe and potentially the multiverse. Possessing all the typical skills and abilities of an Avatar to the cosmic entity regarding cosmic pyrokinesis, telekinesis, flight, etc.

==Supporting characters==

== Cultural impact and legacy ==
=== Critical response ===
Matt Attanasio of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; referred to Moon Knight as the &quot;excellent example of how anyone can suffer from a mental illness and manage to overcome such an illness,&quot; writing, &quot;When you look at Moon Knight’s story as a whole, it appears to be more and more of a story about perseverance, endurance, and coming to grips with who you are. That’s an extremely universal story. That’s something anyone can relate to, in one way or another. It’s a call to believe in yourself, and to never give up. And, really, that’s one of the most heroic tales you can get.&quot; &quot;Syfy&quot; called Moon Knight an &quot;unusual fan favorite,&quot; saying, &quot;For decades, some fans have affectionately called Moon Knight &quot;Marvel’s Batman.&quot; But that&#x27;s not a strictly accurate way to describe the Fist of Khonshu, who&#x27;s his own man. [...] While Spector&#x27;s public cover as a millionaire is definitely Bruce Wayne-lite, what separates the Moon Knight from the Dark Knight is that he has three secret identities. Chase Magnett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; stated, &quot;Ever since Moon Knight premiered in the pages of &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; in 1975, he has been a cult favorite among superhero fans. It took until 1980 for the complicated hero and his many personalities to get their own ongoing series. It was a hit from the very start with two of the great talents of the era doing career-defining work (we&#x27;ll get to who). That high bar has encouraged a lot of others to take similarly distinctive shots at the character ever since.&quot;

&quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; ranked Moon Knight 3rd in their &quot;Marvel: 10 Best Street Level Heroes&quot; list, 5th in their &quot;10 Most Fashionable Marvel Heroes&quot; list, and 9th in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Members of The Secret Avengers&quot; list. Matthew Perpetua Kibblesmith of &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; ranked Moon Knight 48th in their &quot;84 Avengers Members Ranked From Worst To Best&quot; list. Darren Franich &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Moon Knight 80th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s Rank Every Avenger Ever&quot; list, calling him a &quot;great character on his own.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Moon Knight 49th in their &quot;Top 50 Avengers&quot; list, and 89th in their &quot;Top 100 Comics Book Heroes&quot; list. &quot;Wizard&quot; ranked Moon Knight 149th in their &quot;top 200 Comic Book Characters&quot; list.

==== Comparisons to Batman ====
Charlie Huston, writer of the 2006 re-launch of &quot;Moon Knight&quot;, attempted to answer the criticism that Moon Knight is an ersatz Batman in an interview with Comixfan writer Remy Minnick. Minnick noted that the comparison is not baseless, as both Moon Knight and the Dark Knight are wealthy, &quot;normal&quot; humans who fight crime with detective skills, cover identities, skilled confidants, and are equipped with high-tech gadgetry, personalized air craft, and personalized throwing items. Likewise, Moon Knight briefly had a teenage would-be sidekick, with the Steven Grant identity becoming a billionaire (similar to Bruce Wayne), using the fortune to fund his career as Moon Knight. Huston accepted that the two characters have similarities, but went on to contrast them by noting particular differences in origin, motives, and personality. He said, &quot;Bruce Wayne fights crime to avenge the murders of his parents,&quot; whereas Moon Knight &quot;beats up whoever has it coming because he believes he is the avatar of the Egyptian god of vengeance and it helps him to feel better about all the people he killed when he was a mercenary.&quot; Thus, Batman is motivated by vengeance for a personal wrong against his parents, while Marc Spector is motivated by vengeance as a concept. Huston further notes that Bruce Wayne, Batman&#x27;s alter ego, takes on other identities merely to aid in his investigations, while Moon Knight&#x27;s three alters aid him as much in dealing with personal demons as fighting law-breakers, and had a further psychological toll by apparently causing dissociative identity disorder. Shawn S. Lealos of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; wrote, &quot;Too many people call Moon Knight Marvel&#x27;s version of Batman. There are some similarities, but Moon Knight is a much more complex character than Batman. Yes, both men are wealthy and use their money to front their crime-fighting adventures, but Batman is just a man fighting for good. Moon Knight has a split-personality and struggles to maintain his sanity. He gained the power of super-strength, durability, and stamina from the Moon God Khonshu. He doesn&#x27;t mind killing, and most superheroes consider him to be completely insane. Sure, some fans compare him to Batman but only on the surface.&quot;

=== Volumes ===

==== &quot;Vengeance of the Moon Knight&quot; (2009) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Vengeance of the Moon Knight&quot; #1 was the 73rd best selling comic book in September 2009.

Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Vengeance of the Moon Knight&quot; #1 a grade of 7.5 out of 10, saying, &quot;On the whole, it&#x27;s simply to early to judge this book one way or the other. I&#x27;m not enamored with some of the changes to the Moon Knight formula, but it&#x27;s clear, if nothing else, that Hurwitz has a handle on his main character. Hopefully this series will strengthen in the coming months and manage to pull in more readers than the last one did. Moon Knight wasn&#x27;t broken before - it&#x27;s just that no one seemed to notice it.&quot; Chase Magnett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; called the &quot;Vengeance of the Moon Knight&quot; comic book series one of the &quot;greatest Moon Knight runs of all time,&quot; asserting &quot;This short-lived version of the series, under a new title, emphasized Moon Knight&#x27;s incredibly violent nature. There is a constant push-pull effect as the character resists his impulses only to give back into them. Few other iterations play into Moon Knight&#x27;s prior history as a mercenary quite as well, and how that career has warped his personality every bit as much as the mask has.&quot;

==== &quot;Moon Knight&quot; (2014) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1 was the 16th best selling book in March 2014.

Doug Zawisza of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; said, &quot;While I&#x27;m not ready to proclaim &quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1 to be this year&#x27;s &quot;Hawkeye,&quot; this is a magnificent debut issue, which raises many more questions asked than answers. Ellis gives readers plenty of incentive to return for more action and intrigue next issue, and his take on the character fits right between Daredevil and Punisher. The debut issue gives readers exactly enough action and mystery translated through brilliant art to hook them until the next installment. With lines like, &quot;I died before,&quot; Ellis proves a sliver of humor hiding under the cowl, but not an overwhelming amount. That humor, combined with the ingenuity and intelligence of Khonshu&#x27;s disciple makes for a compelling and intriguing &quot;all-new&quot; Moon Knight. Thanks to gorgeous art and smart storytelling, &quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1 is an incredibly strong debut.&quot; Benjamin Bailey of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1 a grade of 9.9 out of 10, asserting, &quot;&quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1 is a masterpiece, anyway you cut it. Whether you are a longtime fan or new to the character, this is a comic you need to read. Like, right now. Stop what you are doing and read &quot;Moon Knight&quot;.&quot;

==== &quot;Moon Knight&quot; (2016) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1 was the 17th best selling book in April 2016.

Alexander Jones of &quot;ComicsBeat&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;Moon Knight #1&quot; does a lot of things right, especially in how the comic characterizes the lead hero while asking some interesting new questions about him. The comic takes the impeccable sense of style and presentation that went into the last run and weaves a new story thread out of it. This comic book does not seem like a brand new take on the character that avoids all previous continuity, but it does shake things up within the context of what came before.&quot; Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1 a grade of 8 out of 10, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s good to have Moon Knight back on the stands. This new series retains much of what made its predecessor so appealing while also shaking up the formula in a major way. Between the moody atmosphere and terrific sense of style, this issue has a lot going for it. It&#x27;s just a shame the book works against itself by rushing to the big reveal rather than offering a slower and more purposeful build-up.&quot;

==== &quot;Moon Knight&quot; (2021) ====
According to &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot;, &quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1 was the best-selling comic book in the week of July 25, 2021. &quot;Moon Knight&quot; #3 was the best-selling comic book in the week of September 26, 2021. &quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1 was the 7th best-selling comic book in 2021.

In 2021, the &quot;Moon Knight&quot; comic book series won the Golden Issue Award for Best Ongoing Comic.

Matthew Aguilar of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1 captures the essence of the character and all the elements that make him stand out from his peers while expanding the character&#x27;s mythos and supporting cast in exciting new ways, and it does so with flair and wit to spare. If that weren&#x27;t enough, the stunning artwork from Cappuccio and colorist Rachelle Rosenberg demands your attention with every page. [...] &quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1 pulls together several threads of Knight&#x27;s complicated history along with fresh new ideas to create something absolutely perfect for the character. The hype was at an all-time high, but Moon Knight manages to deliver on it, and I certainly could not have asked for a better debut.&quot; Benjamin Bailey of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1 a grade of 9.9 out of 10, writing, &quot;Moon Knight&#x27;s books have almost always been good, often they&#x27;re great, but this new relaunch is on a whole other level. This is more than a re-imaging, it&#x27;s a brilliant introduction to a character more folks need to be acquainted with. Whether you are a longtime fan or brand new to the character, this is a comic you absolutely must read. [...] &quot;Moon Knight&quot; #1 is a masterpiece, anyway you cut it. Whether you are a longtime fan or new to the character, this is a comic you need to read. Like, right now. Stop what you are doing and read Moon Knight.&quot;

==== &quot;Moon Knight: Black, White &amp; Blood&quot; (2022) ====
According to ICv2, &quot;Moon Knight: Black, White &amp; Blood&quot; #1 was the 5th best selling comic book in May 2022.

Dustin Holland of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; asserted, &quot;Each of the three stories in &quot;Moon Knight: Black, White &amp; Blood&quot; #1 pushes the character into unfamiliar territory while celebrating the aspects of his personality that make him an engaging piece of the Marvel Universe. Each creative team does a wonderful job crafting believable, self-contained stories that will leave fans wanting more.&quot;

<text>George Washington Hayduke is a fictional character in Edward Abbey&#x27;s novels &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; and &quot;Hayduke Lives!&quot; Hayduke is portrayed as a rugged individualist in the books by Abbey, and has a predilection for working independently when protecting the environment. He is at first skeptical of working with the rest of the monkey wrench gang early in the first book, but soon collaborates with them.

==Description==
Hayduke is an ex-Green Beret, one-time explosives expert and medic in the Vietnam War; and an American environmentalist hero. The specific cultural use of the term Hayduke is derived from this character.

==Origins==
The character of Hayduke was based on his friend and author, Doug Peacock, a Vietnam vet that Abbey befriended and traveled with in the Southwest United States. He is most likely named after the Haiduks, rebels in the Ottoman Empire, and one of Eric Hobsbawm&#x27;s archetypal bandits.

Hayduke is Abbey&#x27;s codification of the wants, longings, and desires of the average male environmentalist awash in the frustrations of corporate greed and corruption where the voice of the little people remain unheard – until the little people rise up and take direct action because, as Abbey&#x27;s Monkey Wrench Gang puts it, &quot;somebody has to do it.&quot;

==Books==
George Washington Hayduke&#x27;s first set of adventures are outlined in 1975&#x27;s &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;.

In 1989 (the year of Abbey&#x27;s death) &quot;Hayduke Lives!&quot; was released. The adventures of Hayduke and the original Monkey Wrench Gang become tied with the activities of more legitimate environmental organizations like Earth First!. The Earth Liberation Front and the Animal Liberation Front did not exist at the time Abbey wrote &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;.

Hayduke was also referenced in other novels by Abbey. In &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot; (1968), the owner of the local general store is named &quot;Hayduke.&quot; In &quot;Good News&quot; (1980), the character of Jack Burns attempts to convince his son, now an adult, that he is his father. However, his son refuses to believe him, claiming that his real father was killed while blowing up a dam. Targeting the dam was always Hayduke&#x27;s highest aspiration.

==Aliases==
George Hayduke uses a number of aliases over the course of the books, including: Leopold, Rudolf the Red, Herman Smith, Fred Goodsell, Crazy Horse.

==Author==
Since 1980, an anonymous author known as &quot;George Hayduke&quot; has brought the Hayduke character to life in a well-known series of revenge books. Hayduke states that Edward Abbey was his mentor and says &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; inspired the founding of Earth First!.

<text>Hayduke is a term and verb used among environmental activists and people who cite cult &quot;revenge&quot; books. It is the name of George Washington Hayduke, a fictional character based on Edward Abbey&#x27;s friend Doug Peacock in Abbey&#x27;s cult classics &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; and &quot;Hayduke Lives!&quot;. The Hayduke character personified the &quot;no compromise in defense of the Earth&quot; approach to environmentalism, made real in early Earth First! activism.

==Background==
A complete series of revenge books using the pseudonym George Hayduke exist, mostly published by the Paladin Press, including &quot;The Big Book of Revenge&quot;, &quot;Get Even&quot;, &quot;Make &#x27;Em Pay&quot;, &quot;Up Yours&quot; and &quot;Screw Unto Others&quot;. Each describe various methods of committing mischief and mayhem against those who have wronged others in a manner reminiscent of &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot;. &quot;Haydukery&quot; refers to committing such acts in general.
