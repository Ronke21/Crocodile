<text>Miss Nepal () is a national beauty pageant in Nepal. The winners are sent to Miss World, Miss Earth, Miss International.

==History==
From the first pageant in 1994, the winner of the Miss Nepal has represented Nepal at Miss Asia Pacific. After 1997, the Hidden Treasures collaborated with Kathmandu Jaycees and formed two pageants of Kathmandu Jacyees Miss Nepal and Hidden Treasures Miss World Nepal. From 1998 onwards, the winner of Miss Nepal has been sent to Miss World contest and the first runner-up to Miss Asia Pacific. No contest was held in 2001 due to the Nepalese royal massacre.

From 2004, the second runner-up represented represent Nepal at Miss Earth. This changed in 2005, to first runner-up, as they stopped sending them to Miss Asia Pacific. From 2010, the second runner-up was sent to Miss International. Since 2011 onwards; the names of the third and fourth runner-up were revealed while announcing the names of the winners on the coronation night. The Hidden Treasure reacquired the franchise of Miss Asia Pacific International (2016-2017). In 2017, Hidden Treasure acquired Miss Universe franchise and directly nominated Nagma Shrestha as the First Miss Universe Nepal 2017, because she had contacted the Miss Universe and obtained license on the behalf of the Hidden Treasure. From 2018 onwards, all four winners are of equal position with no runner-ups.

As the press announcement of Miss Nepal 2020 by Hidden Treasure, Miss Nepal 2020 will air live on Kantipur TV. This was the first time Miss Nepal would telecast on another national television after dropping the contract with Nepal Television. Hidden Treasure also announced that they no longer had the Miss Universe franchise so there will have only four winners for this years. The price money has been increased from NRS 100000 to NRS 250000 each for all winners. 
The organizer announced on 20 March 2020, that the contest has been postponed due to the (COVID-19) pandemic, as informed by Chairman of Hidden Treasure Mr. Driwakar Rajkarnikar. Later the pageant was conducted on 5 December 2020. 

In 2022, Miss Nepal lost the franchise of Miss Supranational. Now, Mister and Miss National Nepal (Santosh Upadhyaya Directorship) sends Nepalese delegates to Supranational pageant.

<text>The Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK) () is a public university in Ting Kok, New Territories, Hong Kong.

The university was founded in 1994 as The Hong Kong Institute of Education. It is one of eight subsidised universities under the University Grants Committee of Hong Kong and the only one historically dedicated to teacher education, with an increasingly broadening academic scope across recent years.

==History and recent developments==
The history of The Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK) can be traced back to 1853. The St. Paul&#x27;s College introduced the first formalised programme of in-service teacher training. This was described in its Annual Report for 1994–1995. On 25 April 1994, under the recommendation made by the Education Commission Report No 5, The Hong Kong Institute of Education (HKIEd) was formally established by the merger of:

*Northcote College of Education, established in 1939 and named after Sir Geoffry Northcote, then Governor of Hong Kong.
** The college was at what is now at the Bonham Road Government Primary School in Sai Ying Pun from 1941 to 1962, though this was interrupted by the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. In 1962, the college moved to 21 Sassoon Road, now headquarters of the Li Ka Shing Medical Faculty of the HKU. The college returned to the Sai Ying Pun site in 1971 and stayed there until 1997.
*Grantham College of Education, established in 1951 and named after Sir Alexander Grantham, then Governor of Hong Kong. It was located at 42 Gascoigne Road.
*Sir Robert Black College of Education, established in 1960 and named after Sir Robert Brown Black, then Governor of Hong Kong.
*Hong Kong Technical Teachers’ College, established in 1974.
*Institute of Language in Education, established in 1982 and previously under the supervision of the then Education Department.

Established in 1994, HKIEd provides doctorate, master and undergraduate degrees, postgraduate diploma, certificates and a range of in-service programmes to around 7,000 pre-service students and serving teachers.

In October 1997, the Institute moved to its new campus in Tai Po near the Tai Po Industrial Estate. It has a Sports Centre at Pak Shek Kok, Tai Po, as well as a Town Centre campus in Tseung Kwan O.

In 2001, the HKIEd HSBC Early Childhood Learning Centre was established on the campus. The HKIEd Jockey Club Primary School was founded on the campus in the following year.

From 1 May 2004, the institute was granted self-accrediting status in respect of its own teacher education programmes at degree-level and above.

In June 2009, the institute won extra annual funding of HK$22 million from the Hong Kong Government to provide 120 undergraduate degree places for three new undergraduate programs and 30 research postgraduate places for the 2009–2012 triennium.

In January 2010, the University Grants Committee endorsed the HKIEd&#x27;s plans for Research Postgraduate programmes and undergraduate programs in three disciplines: &quot;Humanities&quot; (mainly Language), &quot;Social Sciences&quot;, and &quot;Creative Arts &amp; Culture&quot;.

The approval is seen as a step closer for the institute to gaining its university title by becoming a fully-fledged university of education with a range of disciplines and strong research capacity.

HKIEd will launch its first batch of non-education programmes, namely the Bachelor of Arts in Language Studies and Bachelor of Social Sciences in Global and Environmental Studies in September 2010. Both programmes have already secured the support of the External Validation Panel of the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications.

Preparations for the launching of the third Education-Plus programme, Bachelor of Arts in Creative Arts and Culture, in 2011–2012 are underway.

The institute operates four institute-level research centres had been set up to facilitate the growth of expertise in multi-disciplinary research.

On 11 September 2015 the University Grants Committee accepted the application by the Institute of Education to change its name to university, and on 26 January 2016 the adoption of the title &quot;The Education University of Hong Kong&quot; was approved. Accordingly, &quot;The Hong Kong Institute of Education (Amendment) Bill&quot; will be gazetted on 19 February 2016 and introduced into the Legislative Council on 2 March 2016.

In January 2016, the institute was awarded self-accrediting status in three further programme areas, covered by its existing Programme Area Accreditation status: Chinese Studies, English Studies and Environmental Studies.

On 27 May 2016, the institute was formally renamed The Education University of Hong Kong in recognition of its &quot;efforts and contributions over the years&quot;.

In September 2020, The Education University of Hong Kong, with the help of the Li Ka Shing Foundation, partnered with Kneron to build Hong Kong&#x27;s first AI educational system.

In November 2023, the university announced that students would have to undergo mandatory national security education.

==Academic organisation==
There are three faculties and a number of non-faculty academic units at the university, which provide study programmes and courses for students.

The Graduate School was established in April 2010 to support EdUHK (the then HKIEd) in the management and quality assurance of its higher degree programmes.

==Controversy over the proposed HKIEd-CUHK merger==
In January 2007, a public row broke out between the management and the government over the future of the institute. Battle lines were drawn between the Vice-Chancellor Paul Morris and then Secretary for Education and Manpower, Prof. Arthur Li. The dispute had apparently been brewing for some time, as far back as June 2002, when the Arthur Li was appointed secretary. Apparently, Li favoured a merger of the institute with The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), where he was vice-chancellor. Morris opposed the merger, and had for some time been campaigning to establish the institute as a university in its own right. Morris maintained he had been warned by the Chairman of the council, Dr. Thomas Leung Kwok-fai, as far back as June 2006, that his tenure would end unless he agreed to the amalgamation of the institute with the CUHK.

===Timeline===
*24 June 2002 – Shortly after Li&#x27;s appointment as Education Secretary, Li had apparently invited Morris to dinner and proposed a merger of the institute with the Chinese University. Li also apparently offered Morris to head the &quot;super education centre&quot;.
*19 July 2002 – Morris was allegedly told by Simon Ip Sik-on, a former chairman of the institute&#x27;s council, during a lunch he shared with Li and two other senior institute officials that Li threatened to render the institute unviable if a merger could not be achieved.
*14 October 2002 – Fanny Law had met with Arthur Li, Dr. Leung and its former vice chairman Alfred Chan Wing-kin. She issued an &quot;internal email&quot; to staff, stating the institute&#x27;s wish for an early indication of a possible merger with the education faculty of the CUHK.
*25 January 2007 – The governing council of the institute decided in a vote of 10 to 3, with three abstentions, not to renew Vice Chancellor Morris&#x27; contract. Leung denied Morris&#x27; assertion about the threats to the security of his tenure, instead accusing Morris of misinterpreting him. Leung insisted that there was no connection between the two. This led to speculation that the Education and Manpower Bureau (EMB) was trying to force an amalgamation of the institute with the CUHK.
*26 January 2007 – Deputy Vice Chancellor Professor Bernard Luk Hung-kay () alleged on RTHK Radio 1&#x27;s Openline Openview phone-in program that during the summer of 2003, after results of the Language Proficiency Assessment for Teachers were released, the media reported (falsely) that most of 330 teachers who had failed in the test were from The Hong Kong Institute of Education. Professor Luk accused Law for not having set the record straight and alleged that this publicity resulted in a sharp fall in the number of applications for the next year, though the numbers had since recovered through hard work of the staff. Prof Luk also corroborated Vice Chancellor Morris&#x27; version of events by revealing a secret breakfast meeting that took place between Dr. Leung and the Vice Chancellor in June 2006.
*5 February 2007 – Luk alleged both in his open letter and on RTHK Radio 1&#x27;s Openline Openview program that Li had made veiled threats both against him and Morris in the past. For their refusal to make a news release denouncing those teachers who exceeded the placement quota for their profession and who were about to lose their current jobs, Arthur Li was quoted by Luk to have said on 26/27 June 2004, &quot;I&#x27;ll remember this. You will pay.&quot; (The quote was said in English). Luk suggests in his letter that the time is up for his &quot;pound of flesh.&quot; Luk also alleged that during January 2004, Li had phoned Morris to once again urge Morris to take the lead in amalgamating with CUHK. He threatened to reduce future student intake quotas of HKIEd otherwise.Luk pointed out that there had been numerous newspaper articles written by IEd staff members in the past few years criticizing the EMB education reform and policies. Luk maintained this resulted in a number of phone calls from a certain high-ranking official in the EMB, demanding the immediate dismissals of those four staff members, which they refused to entertain.
*6 February 2007 – Staff members Leung Yan-wing () and Ip Kin-yuen () asked Legco to investigate further or set up an open hearing into the allegations. Legco member Cheung Man Kwong told RTHK Radio 1&#x27;s Openline Openview phone-in program that he along with eight other Democratic camp members had already written to Legco&#x27;s Education Committee chairman Tsang Yok-sing, urging him to convene an emergency meeting to investigate these allegations of government interference in the running of IEd. Students overwhelmingly passed vote of no-confidence in Governing Board Chairman Thomas Leung Kwok-fai: of 680 the voters, only 36 students backed Leung. There were 65 abstentions and eight voided ballot papers.
*7 February 2007 – It was announced that Legco&#x27;s Education Committee would convene on 12 February 2007 to discuss any further action and that it would invite both IEd representatives and Arthur Li himself if necessary.
*9 March 2007 – Pro-government legislators blocked an attempt to set up a Legco inquiry to investigate allegations over meddling with the academic freedom and autonomy of educational institutions. The vote failed by 30:21 with one abstention.
*Chief Executive Donald Tsang set up a commission headed by Justice Woo Kwok-hing.
*16 March 2007 – Justice Woo Kwok-hing resigned to avoid potential accusations of lack of impartiality.
*22 March 2007 – Commission hearings commenced.
*20 June 2007 – The commission dismissed allegations that Li had interfered with the institutional autonomy, but pinned the blame on Fanny Law. Law resigned immediately from her post of Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption.
*13 March 2009 – the Secretary for Education took out a judicial review application to challenge the commission&#x27;s findings in 2007. In recognising that academic freedom is a self-contained right under Articles 34 and 137 of the Basic Law, the Court of First Instance held that the Permanent Secretary&#x27;s (Mrs Fanny Law) approach did not violate the institute&#x27;s right to academic freedom as she had not made any direct or indirect threats of sanction. The judicial review was allowed in March 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;HCAL108/2007&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="897594" wikidata="Q1190569" url="?curid=897594" title="Tangkuban Perahu">
<text>Tangkuban Perahu () is a stratovolcano in Lembang, West Bandung Regency, West Java, Indonesia. It erupted in 1826, 1829, 1842, 1846, 1896, 1910, 1926, 1929, 1952, 1957, 1961, 1965, 1967, 1969, 1983, 2013 and 2019. It is a popular tourist attraction where tourists hike or ride to the edge of the crater to view the hot water springs and boiling mud up close, and buy eggs cooked on the hot surface. Together with Mount Burangrang and Bukit Tunggul, it is a remnant of the ancient Mount Sunda after the plinian eruption caused the Caldera to collapse.

In April 2005, the Directorate of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation raised an alert, forbidding visitors from going up the volcano. &quot;Sensors on the slopes of the two mountains - Anak Krakatoa on the southern tip of Sumatra Island and Tangkuban Perahu in Java - picked up an increase in volcanic activity and a build-up of gases, said government volcanologist Syamsul Rizal.&quot; On the mountain&#x27;s northern flank is Death Valley, which derives its name from a frequent accumulation of poisonous gases.

==History of volcanic activity==
A study conducted in 2001 determined that Tangkuban Perahu had erupted at least 30 times in the previous 40,750 years. Studies of the tephra layers within three kilometres of the crater revealed that 21 were minor eruptions and the remaining were significant eruptions. The eruptions that occurred before approximately 10,000 years ago were magmatic/phreatomagmatic, and the ones that occurred after 10,000 years ago were phreatic. The volcano erupted as recently as 26 July 2019. On 2 August 2019, the volcano experienced eight minor eruptions, and as a result, the place was closed down for visitors, but is open again.

==Legend==
The name translates roughly to &quot;upturning of (a) boat&quot; or &quot;upturned boat&quot; in Sundanese, referring to the local legend of its creation. The story tells of &quot;Dayang Sumbi&quot;, a beauty who lived in West Java. She cast away her son &quot;Sangkuriang&quot; for disobedience, and in her sadness was granted the power of eternal youth by the gods. After many years in exile, Sangkuriang decided to return to his home, long after the two had forgotten and failed to recognise each other. Sangkuriang fell in love with Dayang Sumbi, his mother, and planned to marry her, only for Dayang Sumbi to recognise his birthmark just as he was about to go hunting wild boar. To prevent the marriage from taking place, Dayang Sumbi asked Sangkuriang to build a dam on the river Citarum and to build a large boat to cross the river, both before sunrise. Sangkuriang meditated and summoned mythical ogre-like creatures -buta hejo or green giant(s)- to do his bidding. Dayang Sumbi saw that the tasks were almost completed and called on her workers to spread red silk cloths east of the city, to give the impression of impending sunrise. Sangkuriang was fooled, and upon believing that he had failed, kicked the dam and the unfinished boat, resulting in severe flooding and the creation of Tangkuban Perahu from the hull of the boat.

<doc id="897595" wikidata="Q2555038" url="?curid=897595" title="Theological noncognitivism">
<text>Theological noncognitivism is the non-theist position that religious language, particularly theological terminology such as &#x27;God&#x27;, is not intelligible or meaningful, and thus sentences like &#x27;God exists&#x27; are cognitively meaningless. This would also imply that sentences like the negation of &#x27;God exists&#x27; or &#x27;God does not exist&#x27; are likewise meaningless, i.e., neither true nor false. It may be considered synonymous with [[ignosticism]] (also called igtheism), a term coined in 1964 by Sherwin Wine, a rabbi and a founding figure of Humanistic Judaism.

== Arguments ==
Theological noncognitivists argue in different ways, depending on what one considers the &quot;theory of meaning&quot; to be.

One argument holds to the claim that definitions of God are , self-instituting , . For example, a sentence stating that &quot;God is He who created everything, apart from Himself&quot;, is seen as circular rather than an irreducible truth.

Michael Martin writing from a verificationist perspective concludes that religious language is meaningless because it is not verifiable.

George H. Smith uses an attribute-based approach in an attempt to prove that there is no concept for God: he argues that there are no meaningful attributes, only negatively defined or attributes, making the term meaningless. An example: Consider the proposition of the existence of a &quot;pink unicorn&quot;. When asserting the proposition, one can use attributes to at least describe the concept such that a cohesive idea is transferred in language. With no knowledge of &quot;pink unicorn&quot;, it can be described minimally with the attributes &quot;pink&quot;, &quot;horse&quot;, and &quot;horn&quot;. Only then can the proposition be accepted or rejected. The acceptance or rejection of the proposition is distinct from the concept.

== Relationship to other non-theist perspectives ==
Steven J. Conifer contrasts theological noncognitivism with positive atheism, which describes not only a lack of a belief in gods but furthermore denies that gods exist thereby giving credence to the existence of a concept of something for &quot;God&quot; to refer to, because it assumes that there is something understandable to &quot;not&quot; believe in.

Paul Kurtz finds the view to be compatible with both weak atheism and agnosticism. However, Theodore Drange distinguishes noncognitivism and agnosticism, describing the latter as accepting that theological language is meaningful but being noncommittal about its truth or falsity on the grounds of insufficient evidence.

<text>Larvaceans, copelates or appendicularians, class Appendicularia, are solitary, free-swimming tunicates found throughout the world&#x27;s oceans. While larvaceans are filter feeders like most other tunicates, they keep their tadpole-like shape as adults, with the notochord running through the tail. They can be found in the pelagic zone, specifically in the photic zone, or sometimes deeper. They are transparent planktonic animals, usually ranging from to in body length including the tail, although giant larvaceans can reach up to in length.

Larvaceans are known for the large houses they build around their bodies to assist in filter-feeding. Secreted from mucus and cellulose, these structures often comprise several layers of filters and can reach up to ten times their body length. In some genera like &quot;Oikopleura&quot;, houses are built and discarded every few hours, with sinking houses playing a key role in the oceanic carbon cycle.

== History ==
The study of larvaceans began with the description of &quot;Appendicularia flagellum&quot; by Chamisso and Eysenhardt in 1821. More species were quickly discovered, with &quot;Oikopleura&quot; in 1830 providing the first evidence of the larvacean house, although its role in feeding wouldn&#x27;t be understood until Eisen&#x27;s discoveries in 1874.

=== Larvaceans as tunicates ===

Huxley was the first to suggest the identity of larvaceans as tunicates in 1851. Their relationship with other tunicates remained unclear, with larvaceans being argued to be ascidian larvae or a free-swimming generation of ascidians.

An attempt at establishing the internal phylogeny of the class was realized by Fol following the discovery of the aberrant &quot;Kowalevskia&quot;. Fol grouped together the families Oikopleuridae and Fritillariidae in the putative Endostyla, based on the presence of an endostyle, absent in &quot;Kowalevskia&quot; which he placed in the sister group Anendostyla.

=== In situ observations ===
Another jump in the study of larvaceans was the beginning of &quot;in situ&quot; observations, which allowed researchers to study the creatures inside their fragile houses without damage. Researchers such as Kakani Katija Young from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute pioneered imaging techniques such as the particle image velocimetry instrument DeepPIV, revealing the complexity and inner structure of larvacean houses and leading to the first 3D simulations of their internal currents.

== Anatomy ==
The adult larvaceans resemble the tadpole-like larvae of most tunicates. Like a common tunicate larva, the adult Appendicularia have a discrete trunk and tail. It was originally believed that larvaceans were neotenic tunicates, giving them their common name. Recent studies hint at an earlier divergence, with ascidians having developed their sessile adult form later on.

As the larvae of ascidian tunicates don&#x27;t feed at all, the larvae of doliolids goes through their metamorphosis while still inside the egg, and salps and pyrosomes have both lost the larval stage, it makes the larvaceans the only tunicates that feed and have fully functional internal organs during their tailed &quot;tadpole stage&quot;, which in Appendicularia is permanent.

The full development of &quot;Oikopleura dioica&quot; and the fate of its cell lineages have been well-documented, providing insight into larvacean anatomy. Being a model organism, most of our knowledge on larvaceans comes from this specific taxon. Variations in body shape and anatomy exist between families, although the general body plan stays similar.

=== Trunk ===
The trunk can roughly be divided into three regions — pharyngeo-brachial, digestive and genital — which are more or less distinct depending on the genus. Like in vertebrates, the digestive system comprises in order a mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, intestine and rectum.

The pharynx is equipped with an endostyle on its lower side, a specialized organ helping direct food particles inside. It also possesses two spiracles, each surrounded by a ring of cilia, which direct food particles from the inner filter&#x27;s junction to the mouth.

In some genera like &quot;Oikopleura&quot;, the tract is U-shaped, with the anus located in a forwards position compared to the stomach and intestine. Others like &quot;Fritillaria&quot; present a more segmented appearance, with a straighter digestive tract and well-separated pharyngeal and digestive sections. The species &quot;Appendicularia sicula&quot; doesn&#x27;t have any anus at all, leading to accumulation of undigested material.

Appendicularia retains the ancestral chordate characteristics of having the pharyngeal spiracles and the anus open directly to the outside, and by the lack of the atrium and the atrial siphon found in related classes.

The gonads are located in the posterior section of the trunk, beyond the digestive tract. They are the only section of the body not to be well-distinguished in the juvenile post-tail shift, instead only growing in size in the days leading to spawning.

=== Tail ===
The tail of larvaceans contain a central notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, and a series of striated muscle bands enveloped either by epithelial tissue (oikopleurids) or by an acellular basement membrane (fritillarids). Unlike the ascidian larvae, the tail nerve cord in larvaceans contains some neurons.

The tail twists during development, with its dorsal and ventral sides becoming left and right sides respectively. In this way, the dorsal nerve cord actually runs through the tail to the left of the notochord, connecting to the rest of the nervous system at the caudal ganglion at the base of the tail.

The muscle bands surrounding the notochord and nerve cord consist of rows of paired muscle cells, or myocytes, running along the length of the tail.

=== House ===
To assist in their filter-feeding, larvaceans produce a test or &quot;house&quot; made of mucopolysaccharides and cellulose, secreted from specialized cells termed oikoplasts. In most species, the house surrounds the animal like a bubble. Even for species in which the house does not completely surround the body, such as &quot;Fritillaria&quot;, the house is always present and attached to at least one surface.

The house is secreted from oikoplasts, a specialized family of cells constituting the oikoplastic epithelium. Derived from the ectoderm, it covers part (in &quot;Fritillaria&quot;) or all (in &quot;Oikopleura&quot;) of the trunk. In larvae, surface fibrils are secreted by the epithelium prior to the differentiation of the oikoplasts, and have been suggested to play a part in the development of the first house, as well as the formation of the cuticular layer.

The houses possesses several sets of filters, with external filters stopping food particles too big for the larvacean to eat, and internal filters redirecting edible particles to the larvacean&#x27;s mouth. Including the external filters, the houses can reach over one meter in giant larvaceans, an order of magnitude larger than the larvacean itself. The house varies in shape: incomplete in &quot;Fritillaria&quot;, it is shaped like a pair of kidneys in &quot;Bathochordaeus&quot;, and toroidal in &quot;Kowalevskia&quot;.

The arrangement of filters allows food in the surrounding water to be brought in and concentrated prior to feeding, with some species able to concentrate food up to 1000 times compared to the surrounding water. By regularly beating the tail, the larvacean can generate water currents within its house that allow the concentration of food. For this purpose, the tail fits into a specialized tail sheath, a funnel of the house connected to the exhalent aperture. The high efficiency of this method allows larvaceans to feed on much smaller nanoplankton than most other filter feeders.

This specific niche of &quot;mucous-mesh grazers&quot; or &quot;mammoth grazers&quot; has been argued to be shared with thaliaceans (salps, pyrosomes and doliolids) — all using internal mucous structures —, as well as with sea butterflies, a clade of pelagic sea snails similarly using an external mucous web to catch prey, although through passive &quot;flux feeding&quot; rather than active filter-feeding.

Larvaceans have been found to be able to select food particles based on factors such as nutrient availability and toxin presence, although both laboratory feeding experiments and &quot;in situ&quot; observations show no difference in feeding rate between their usual food sources and microplastics. They can eat a wide range of particles sizes, down to one ten-thousandth of their own body size, far smaller than other filter-feeders of comparable size. On the other side of the spectrum, &quot;Okiopleura dioica&quot; can eat prey up to 20% of its body size. The upper limit on prey size is set by the mouth size, which in the largest genus &quot;Bathochordaeus&quot; is around 1–2 mm wide for a trunk length of 1–3 cm.

In some species, houses are discarded and replaced regularly as the animal grows in size and its filters become clogged; in &quot;Oikopleura&quot;, a house is kept for no more than four hours before being replaced. In other genera such as &quot;Fritillaria&quot;, houses can be regularly deflated and inflated, cleaning off particles clogging the filters. Houses being reused in this manner leads to a smaller contribution in marine snow from these genera.

Larvacean houses share key homologies with tunicate tunics, including the use of cellulose as a material, confirming that the ancestral tunicate already had the capability to synthesize cellulose. This has been confirmed through genetic studies on &quot;Oikopleura dioica&quot; and the ascidian &quot;Ciona&quot;, pinpointing their common cellulose synthase genes as originating with a horizontal gene transfer from a prokaryote. However, houses and tunics share key differences — while houses are gelatinous and can be deflated or even discarded at will, tunics are rigid structures definitively incorporated into the animal&#x27;s filter-feeding apparatus.

== Ecology ==
=== Habitat ===
Larvaceans are widespread, motile planktonic creatures, living through the water column. As their habitats are mostly defined by ocean currents, many species have a cosmopolitan distribution, with some like &quot;Oikopleura dioica&quot; being found in all of the world&#x27;s oceans. Larvaceans have been reported as far as the Southern Ocean, where they are estimated to comprise 10.5 million tonnes of wet biomass.

Most species live in the photic zone at less than 100 meters in depth, although giant larvaceans such as &quot;Bathochordaeus mcnutti&quot; can be found up to 1,400 meters deep, and undescribed oikopleurid and fritillariid species have been reported through the bathypelagic zone, down to the 3,500 meters deep seafloor in Monterey Bay where they constitute the dominant particle feeders in most of the water column.

=== Reproduction and life cycle ===
Larvaceans reproduce sexually, with all but one species being protandric hermaphrodites. Unlike all other known larvaceans, &quot;Oikopleura dioica&quot; shows separate sexes, which are distinguished on the last day of their life cycle through differing gonad shapes.

The immature animals resemble the tadpole larvae of ascidians, albeit with the addition of developing viscera. Once the trunk is fully developed, the larva undergoes &quot;tail shift&quot;, in which the tail moves from a rearward position to a ventral orientation and twists 90° relative to the trunk. Following tail shift, the larvacean begins secretion of the first house.

The life cycle is short. The tadpole-shaped larva usually performs the tail shift less than one day after fecundation, becoming fully functional juveniles. Adults usually reproduce after 5 to 7 days depending on the species.

Fertilisation is external. The body wall ruptures during egg release, killing the animal.

=== Ecological impact ===
Through their discarded, nutrient-rich houses — termed sinkers — and fecal pellets falling towards the deep seafloor, larvaceans transport large amounts of organic matter towards that region, constituting a significant component of marine snow. In that way, they massively contribute to the oceanic carbon cycle, being responsible for up to one-third of the carbon transfer to the deep seafloor in Monterey Bay. Still in Monterey Bay, giant larvaceans have been found to have the highest filtration rate of any invertebrate, and discarded larvacean houses have been observed as a consistent food source for both pelagic and benthic organisms in that same region.

Both larvacean houses and fecal pellets were also found to trap microplastics, before sinking towards the seafloor. In this way, larvaceans are believed to play a part in the missing plastic paradox, transporting microplastics through the water column and to the seafloor. Experiments performed on the giant larvacean &quot;Bathochordaeus stygius&quot; confirm their ability to filter and discard microplastics.

== Taxonomy ==
Appendicularia is most often recovered as the sister group of the other tunicate groups (Ascidiacea and Thaliacea). Already in the late 19th to early 20th century, it was hypothesized by Seeliger and later by Lohmann that Appendicularia diverged first from a free-swimming ancestral tunicate, with sessile forms evolving later in the sister lineage (often termed Acopa).

The following cladogram is based on the 2018 phylogenomic study of Delsuc and colleagues.

=== Fossil record ===
Being delicate and soft-bodied, Appendicularia has no definitive fossil record, although the Cambrian form &quot;Oesia disjuncta&quot; has historically been suggested to belong to the class. More recently, microfossils covered in an organic coat found in vanadium-rich Cambrian black shales in South China have been suggested to be traces of early larvaceans in their houses, putatively termed &quot;paleoappendicularians&quot;.

Vetulicolians have also been argued to represent stem-group larvaceans by Dominguez and Jefferies, on the basis of synapomorphies comprising the reduction of the atria and of the gill slits, the position of the anus, and a 90° counter-clockwise torsion of the tail (as seen from behind) around the anterior-posterior axis.

=== Internal classification ===
The extant species of the class are divided into three families based on both morphological and genomic criteria: Kowalevskiidae, Fritillariidae and Oikopleuridae. The first two are believed to be closer to each other, sharing more derived characteristics compared to the primitive Oikopleuridae. Fritillariidae itself is subdivided into Fritillariinae and the monotypic Appendiculariinae, while Oikopleuridae is split into Bathochordaeinae and Oikopleurinae. Deeper phylogeny is unclear, with genera such as &quot;Oikopleura&quot; possibly being paraphyletic.

Several key morphological differences distinguish the families. Fritillariidae presents a more tapered, compressed trunk, as compared to the rounder one of the other two families. Meanwhile, Kowalevskiidae is notable for lacking the heart and endostyle present in other families, the latter replaced by a ciliated groove without glandular cells. The shape of the spiracles also differs: they appear as simple holes in Fritillariidae, long narrow slits in Kowalevskiidae, and tubular passages in Oikopleuridae.

While the number of described species is comparatively low, the class is believed to harbour massive diversity in the form of cryptic species. For instance, &quot;Oikopleura dioica&quot; comprises at least three distinct, reproductively incompatible clades despite a similar morphological appearance.

Not all species are equally well-studied. The popularity of &quot;Oikopleura dioica&quot; as a model organism and its ease of cultivation have led to studies disproportionately focusing on this species&#x27; anatomy, and &quot;in situ&quot; observations on &quot;Bathochordaeus charon&quot; have been performed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. Meanwhile, studies of Kowalevskiidae and Fritillariidae are comparatively rarer and more limited.

== Use as a model species ==
The dioecious &quot;Oikopleura dioica&quot; is the only larvacean species that has successfully been cultured in laboratory. The ease of cultivation, combined with extremely small genome size and recent development of techniques for expressing foreign genes in &quot;O. dioica&quot;, has led to the advancement of this species as a model organism for the study of gene regulation, chordate evolution, developmental biology, and ecology.

<doc id="897603" wikidata="Q1164342" url="?curid=897603" title="Kitchen hood">
<text>A kitchen hood, exhaust hood, hood fan, extractor hood, or range hood is a device containing a mechanical fan that hangs above the stove or cooktop in the kitchen. It removes airborne grease, combustion products, fumes, smoke, heat, and steam from the air by evacuation of the air and filtration. In commercial kitchens exhaust hoods are often used in combination with fire suppression devices so that fumes from a grease fire are properly vented and the fire is put out quickly. Commercial vent hoods may also be combined with a fresh air fan that draws in exterior air, circulating it with the cooking fumes, which is then drawn out by the hood.

In most exhaust hoods, a filtration system removes grease (the grease trap) and other particles. Although many vent hoods exhaust air to the outside, some recirculate the air to the kitchen. In a recirculating system, filters may be used to remove odors in addition to the grease.

The device is known as an extractor hood in the United Kingdom, as a range hood in the United States, and as a rangehood in Australia. It is also called a stove hood, hood fan, cooker hood, vent hood, or ventilation hood. Other names include cooking canopy, extractor fan, fume extractor, and electric chimney.

==Description==
An extractor hood consists of three main components: a skirt or capture panel to contain the rising gases (also known as the &quot;effluent plume&quot;), a grease filter, and a fan for ventilation.

Extractor hoods may be ducted (or vented) or ductless (or recirculating). Ducted hoods blow the gases to the outdoors; ductless hoods filter the air, often using activated charcoal, to remove odor and smoke particles from the air and then release the cleaned air back into the kitchen.

A ducted system removes of all forms of airborne contamination, while a ductless one recirculates heat and moisture. In addition, a ducted application eliminates the need for regular replacement of the filters and avoids the airflow restriction (and the resultant loss of power) caused by them. However, the ducted application can be impractical, due to lack of space or ability to install a duct system, make-up air requirements, or the additional cost of heating or cooling the make-up air.

Exhaust hoods almost always include built-in lighting to illuminate the cooking surface. Extractor hood controls are typically electronic, though some low-end models use electromechanical controls. Extractor hoods with electronic controls can offer remote control, motorized height adjustment, thermal sensor, overheat protection, boost mode, delayed shut-off, filter cleaning reminder, active noise cancellation, temperature display, user presets (memory), and so on.

Extractor hoods may be made from a variety of materials, including stainless steel, copper, bronze, nickel silver, zinc, tempered glass, wood, aluminum, brass, heat-resistant plastics, and more.

NFPA 96 Standard for Ventilation Control and Fire Protection of Commercial Cooking says that mesh filters shall not be used. It requires that &quot;Listed&quot; grease filters shall be tested in accordance with UL 1046, Standard for Grease Filters for Exhaust Ducts.

==Types==
Kitchen hoods are broadly classified into ducted hoods and ductless hoods. This classification of these kitchen hoods is done purely on the basis of how the hoods process the air that is being sucked in.

===Ducted kitchen hoods===
Ducted kitchen hoods are the most common and a primary type of kitchen hood. As the name suggests, a ducted kitchen hood has a duct that is used to process and expel any smoke that is generated on top of the kitchen hob.

Large sized duct hoods are widely used not just in homes but also in commercial restaurants and communal kitchens too.

===Ductless kitchen hoods===
Ductless kitchen hoods do not have a duct that is used to process the air. Instead, it makes use of strong air filtration and then pumps out the air back into the room. These types of range hoods are usually used in houses.

==Filters==

Filters remove most odors and particulates, including grease, from the vented air. There are three main types of filter:

* Mesh or cassette filters are made from aluminium mesh strips placed one over the other. They are highly effective in the capture and removal of oil and grease from smoke of both ducted and ductless chimneys. They must be cleaned regularly.
* Baffle filters are made of steel/aluminium frames with curved panels. The curves catch on grease, oil and other particulates. They are durable and easy to clean and are used in both ducted and ductless chimneys. They must be cleaned regularly.
* Charcoal filters are made of fine powdered activated charcoal. They are primarily used for ductless applications. They cannot be cleaned, but need to be replaced regularly.

==Hood overhang==
Greater hood overhangs are suggested to help contain cooking fires in the hood area protected by the fire suppression system.

==Noise levels==
Loud kitchen hoods can affect well-being, and may even contribute to hearing loss. Variable speed fans are generally noisier at higher speeds and different models may have different noise levels. Vented hoods are generally noisier but more effective than recirculating hoods.

Noise levels are measured on dB(A) scale or in sones (in the U.S.). Most kitchen hoods produce 60-70 dB(A), while &quot;quiet&quot; models can go as low as 40 dB(A).

Noise levels are generally given for the maximum speed, so it may be useful to compare noise levels at specific flow rates.

The European Union standardizes the measurement of hood noise.

==Flow==

Hood air flow is measured in liters per second (L/s), cubic meters per second (m3/s), or cubic feet per minute (cfm).

<text>Sri Sarada Devi (Bengali: সারদা দেবী; ; 22 December 1853 – 20 July 1920), born Kshemankari / Thakurmani / Saradamani Mukhopadhyay, was the wife and spiritual consort of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, a nineteenth-century Hindu mystic. Sarada Devi is also reverentially addressed as the Holy Mother (&quot;Sri Sri Maa&quot;) by the followers of the Sri Ramakrishna monastic order. The Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission situated at Dakshineshwar is based on the ideals and life of Sarada Devi. She played an important role in the growth of the Ramakrishna Movement.

Sri Sarada Devi was born in Jayrambati, a village in present-day Bankura District in the state of West Bengal, India. She was married to Ramakrishna in 1859 when she was only six years old and Ramakrishna was 23 years old, but remained with her family until she was 18, when she joined Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar Kali temple. According to her biographers, both lived &quot;lives of unbroken continence, showing the ideals of a householder and of the monastic ways of life&quot;. After Ramakrishna&#x27;s death, Sarada Devi stayed most of the time either at Joyrambati or at the Udbodhan office, Calcutta. The disciples of Ramakrishna regarded her as their own mother, and after their guru&#x27;s death looked to her for advice and encouragement. The followers of the Ramakrishna movement and a large section of devotees across the world worship Sarada Devi as an incarnation of the Adi Parashakti or the Divine Mother.

==Biography==

=== Birth and parentage ===

Saradamani Devi was born of Brahmin parents as the eldest daughter on 22 December 1853, in the quiet village of Jayrambati in present-day West Bengal, India. Her parents, Ramachandra Mukhopadhyay and Shyama Sundari Devi, were poor. Her father Ramchandra earned his living as a farmer and through the performance of priestly duties. According to traditional accounts, Ramachandra and Syama Sundari had visions and supernatural events foretelling the birth of a divine being as their daughter.

Sarada lived the simple life of an Indian village girl. As a child, Sarada—then known as Saradamani—was fascinated by traditional Hindu folklore and narratives. As in the case of most girls of rural upbringing, she did not receive any formal education but learned to serve others as she helped her mother run a large household and looked after her younger brothers. During the terrible famine of 1864, Sarada worked ceaselessly as her family served food to hungry people. She was interested in the clay models of goddesses Kali and Lakshmi, which she worshiped regularly. She is said to have started meditating from her childhood, and traditional accounts recount her mystic visions and experiences. According to Sarada Devi, she used to see a bevy of eight girls of her age coming from an unknown place and escorting her in her chores during her childhood.

The mother and brother of Ramakrishna thought that a marriage would be a good steadying effect on him, by diverting his attention away from spiritual austerities and visions. It is reported that Ramakrishna himself indicated Saradamani as the bride. In May 1859, Sarada was betrothed to Ramakrishna. Sarada was 5 years old and Ramakrishna was 23; the age difference was typical for 19th century rural Bengal.

After the betrothal, Sarada was left to the care of her parents and Ramakrishna returned to Dakshineswar. Sarada next met Ramakrishna when she was fourteen years old, and she spent three months with him at Kamarpukur. There, Ramakrishna imparted to Sarada instructions on meditation and spiritual life. Ramakrishna&#x27;s frequent bhava samadhi (ecstasy) and unorthodox ways of worship led some onlookers to doubt his mental stability, while others regarded him as a great saint. Sarada joined Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar in 1872 on her own accord when she was eighteen, after hearing these rumours about his mental health. She found Ramakrishna to be a kind and caring person.

=== At Dakshineswar Kali Temple ===

At Dakshineswar, Sarada Devi stayed in a tiny room in the &quot;nahabat&quot; (music tower). She stayed at Dakshineswar until 1885, except for short periods when she visited Jayrambati. By this time Ramakrishna had already embraced the monastic life of a sannyasin; as a result, the marriage was never consummated. As a priest, Ramakrishna performed the ritual ceremony—the &quot;Shodashi Puja&quot; where Sarada Devi was made to sit in the seat of goddess Kali, and worshiped as the divine mother Tripurasundari. According to Swami Saradananda a direct disciple of Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna married to show the world an ideal of a sexless marriage. Ramakrishna regarded Sarada as an incarnation of the Divine Mother, addressing her as &quot;Sree Maa&quot; (Holy Mother) and it was by this name that she was known to Ramakrishna&#x27;s disciples.

Sarada Devi&#x27;s days began at 3 am. After finishing her ablutions in the Bhāgirathi-Hooghly, she would practice &quot;japa&quot; and meditation until daybreak. Ramakrishna taught her the sacred &quot;mantras&quot;, and instructed her how to initiate people and guide them in spiritual life. Sarada Devi is regarded as Ramakrishna&#x27;s first disciple. Except for her hours of meditation, most of her time was spent in cooking for Ramakrishna and the growing number of his devotees. While Sarada Devi remained completely in the background, her unassuming, warm personality attracted some female devotees to become her lifelong companions.

During Ramakrishna&#x27;s last days, during which he suffered from throat cancer, Sarada Devi played an important role in nursing him and preparing suitable food for him and his disciples. It is reported that after Ramakrishna&#x27;s death in August 1886, when Sarada Devi tried to remove her bracelets as the customs dictated for a widow, she had a vision of Ramakrishna in which he said, &quot;I have not passed away, I have gone from one room to another.&quot; According to her, whenever she thought of dressing like a widow, she had a vision of Ramakrishna asking her not to do so. After Ramakrishna&#x27;s death, Sarada Devi continued to play an important role in the nascent religious movement. She remained the spiritual guide of the movement for the next 34 years.

=== Pilgrimage ===
After Ramakrishna&#x27;s death, Sarada Devi began her pilgrimage through North India, accompanied by a party of women disciples including Lakshmi Didi, Golap Ma, and Ramakrishna&#x27;s householder and monastic disciples. The party visited the Vishwanath Temple of god Shiva at Banaras and the city of Ayodhya, which is associated with the life of the god Rama. Later, she visited Vrindavan which is associated with the god Krishna. According to traditional accounts, at Vrindavan, she experienced &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; and began her role as &quot;guru&quot;. She initiated several of Ramakrishna&#x27;s disciples including Mahendranath Gupta, Yogen with a mantra. According to her traditional biographers and disciples, to call her &quot;Mother&quot; was no mere expression of respect and all those who met her became aware of a maternal quality in her.

=== In Calcutta ===

After the pilgrimage, Sarada Devi lived alone in Kamarpukur, the village where Ramakrishna was born. There, she endured poverty, verging on starvation for a year. In 1888, when the news reached the lay and monastic disciples of Ramakrishna that she needed their care and attention, they invited her to Calcutta and arranged for her stay. Swami Saradananda built a permanent house for Sarada Devi in Calcutta. The house was named the Udbodhan House, after the Bengali monthly magazine published by the Ramakrishna Math. The house, also known as &quot;Mayerbari&quot; (&quot;Holy Mother&#x27;s House&quot;), is where she spent the longest period of her life outside Jayrambati.

Sarada Devi went to Calcutta because she had many hardships in Kamarpukur. She had no financial resources and no one could take care of her. She tried to hide her situation, but it leaked out. When the devotees at Calcutta heard this, they persuaded Sarada Devi to come to Calcutta.

At Udbodhan House, Sarada Devi was accompanied by other women disciples and devotees of Ramakrishna, Golap Ma, Yogin Ma, Gopaler Ma, Lakshmi Didi and Gauri Ma being the best known. An increasing number of people began to flock for guidance, instructions and spiritual initiation. Other Western women followers of Ramakrishna Order including Sister Nivedita formed close relationship with her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinsky 1984 https://books.google.com/books?id=SXEQCnvzK5AC&amp;pg=PA140 140&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to her biographers, her innate motherliness put visitors at ease. Swami Nikhilananda, her direct disciple writes, &quot;Though she had no children of the flesh, she had many of the spirit.&quot; She regarded all her disciples as her own children.

Sarada Devi received the highest reverence from the Ramakrishna Order and its devotees. Ramakrishna had bade her continue his mission after his death and wanted his disciples not to make any distinction between himself and her. According to her devotees and traditional biographers, the hospitality of Sarada Devi was unique and was characterised by motherly care and solicitude. Traditional accounts recount the mystical experiences of her devotees. Some dreamt of her as a goddess in human form, though they had never seen her picture before. Others reportedly received their initiation from her in their dream. One such example is of Girish Chandra Ghosh, the father of Bengali drama, who reportedly saw Sarada Devi in a dream when he was nineteen years old and received a mantra. When he met her many years later, to his astonishment, she was the same person in the dream.

=== Last days ===

Sarada Devi spent her final years moving back and forth between Jayrambati and Calcutta. In January 1919, Sarada Devi went to Jayrambati and stayed there for over a year. For the next five months, she continued to suffer. Shortly before her death, she gave the last advice to the grief-stricken devotees, &quot;But I tell you one thing—if you want peace of mind, do not find fault with others. Rather, see your own faults. Learn to make the whole world your own. No one is a stranger, my child: this whole world is your own!&quot; This is considered as her last message to the world. 

She died at 1.30 am on Tuesday the 20 July 1920 at Mayer Badi (in the first floor of the Shrine Room), Kolkata. Her body was cremated at the Belur Math, opposite side of River Ganga where Ramakrishna&#x27;s body was cremated at Kashipore, Baranagore, Ratan, Babu ghat. The place where she was cremated is now known as Holy Mother&#x27;s ghat at Belur Math. Today a temple stands at that spot.

==Teachings and quotes==

Sarada Devi did not write any books; her utterances and reminiscences have been recorded by her disciples including Swami Nikhilananda, Swami Tapasyananda. Though uneducated Sarada Devi&#x27;s spiritual insight and utterances are highly regarded by scholars like Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, who writes, &quot;We have bits and pieces of her exquisite remarks as testimony.&quot;
*Practise meditation, and by and by your mind will be so calm and fixed that you will find it hard to keep away from meditation.
*The mind is everything. It is in the mind alone that one feels pure and impure. A man, first of all, must make his own mind guilty and then alone can he see another man&#x27;s guilt.
* &quot;I tell you one thing. If you want peace of mind, do not find fault with others. Rather see your own faults. Learn to make the whole world your own. No one is a stranger, my child; the whole world is your own.&quot;
* One must have devotion towards one&#x27;s own &quot;guru&quot;. Whatever may be the nature of the &quot;guru&quot;, the disciple gets salvation by dint of his unflinching devotion towards his &quot;guru&quot;.
== Impact and legacy ==

Sarada Devi played an important role as the advisory head of a nascent organisation that became a monastic order devoted to social work—the Ramakrishna Mission. Gayatri Spivak writes that Sarada Devi &quot;performed her role with tact and wisdom, always remaining in the background.&quot; She initiated several prominent monks into the Ramakrishna Order. Swami Nikhilananda, who was a freedom fighter and a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, accepted Sarada Devi as his &quot;guru&quot; and joined the Ramakrishna Order. He eventually founded the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center in New York.

Although uneducated herself, Sarada Devi advocated education for women. Nivedita started a school for Indian women with her blessings. She entrusted Devamata with the implementation of her dream—a girls&#x27; school on the Ganges, where Eastern and Western pupils could study together. In 1954, Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, a monastic order for women was founded in the honour of Sarada Devi.

Swami Vivekananda wrote a letter to her to get her opinion about his intention to attend the Parliament of Religions in Chicago. Only after receiving the blessing from her did he decide to go to the United States.

<text>Val Guest (born Valmond Maurice Grossman; 11 December 1911 – 10 May 2006) was an English film director and screenwriter. Beginning as a writer (and later director) of comedy films, he is best known for his work for Hammer, for whom he directed 14 films, and for his science fiction films. He enjoyed a long career in the film industry from the early 1930s until the early 1980s.

==Early life and career==
Guest was born to John Simon Grossman and Julia Ann Gladys Emanuel in Sutherland Avenue in Maida Vale, London. He later changed his name to Val Guest (officially in 1939). His father was a jute broker, and the family spent some of Guest&#x27;s childhood in India before returning to England. His parents divorced when he was young, but this information was kept from him. Instead he was told that his mother had died. He was educated at Seaford College in Sussex, but left in 1927 and worked for a time as a bookkeeper.

Guest&#x27;s initial career was as an actor, appearing in productions in London theatres. He also appeared in a few early sound film roles, before he left acting and began a writing career.

===Writer===
For a time, around 1934, he was the London correspondent for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; (when the publication began a UK edition), before beginning work on film screenplays for Gainsborough Pictures.

This came about because the director Marcel Varnel had been incensed by comments Guest had made in his regular column, &quot;Rambling Around&quot;, about the director&#x27;s latest film. Challenged to write a screenplay by Varnel, Guest co-wrote his first script, which became &quot;No Monkey Business&quot; (1935) directed by Varnel. This was to be the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership between the two men. Guest was placed under contract as a staff writer at Gainsborough&#x27;s Islington Studios in Poole Street.

Guest wrote screenplays for the rest of the decade. His credits included &quot;All In&quot; (1936) for Varnel; &quot;Public Nuisance No. 1&quot; (1936); &quot;A Star Fell from Heaven&quot; (1936); &quot;O-Kay for Sound&quot; (1937) for Varnel with The Crazy Gang; &quot;Alf&#x27;s Button Afloat&quot; (1938) with Flanagan and Allen. He also wrote the Will Hay comedies &quot;Oh, Mr Porter!&quot; (1937) and &quot;Ask a Policeman&quot; (1939). He wrote &quot;Hi Gang!&quot; (1941) for Ben Lyon and Bebe Daniels. Guest often worked with producer Ted Black.

==Directing career==
Guest became a fully-fledged director in the early 1940s (he had been responsible for some second-unit work previously). His first film was an Arthur Askey short, &quot;The Nose Has It&quot; (1942), warning of the dangers of spreading infection.

Guest&#x27;s debut feature was &quot;Miss London Ltd.&quot; (1943), again with Askey; Guest had worked on the scripts of earlier Askey films. Guest&#x27;s second feature as director also starred Askey, &quot;Bees in Paradise&quot; (1944). He followed this with two films starring Vic Oliver and Margaret Lockwood, &quot;Give Us the Moon&quot; (1944) and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Sweetheart&quot; (1945); the latter was the first and only musical from Gainsborough Studios.

Guest directed two films based on the Just William stories, &quot;Just William&#x27;s Luck&quot; (1947) and &quot;William Comes to Town&quot; (1948). He wrote and directed a thriller, &quot;Murder at the Windmill&quot; (1949).

===Yolande Donlan===
Guest then made the comedy &quot;Miss Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1949) with Yolande Donlan, who became his wife in 1954. The two reunited on &quot;The Body Said No!&quot; (1950); &quot;Mister Drake&#x27;s Duck&quot; (1951), with Douglas Fairbanks Jr.; and &quot;Penny Princess&quot; (1952) with Dirk Bogarde.

===Hammer Films===
Guest began an association with Hammer films when he directed &quot;The Men of Sherwood Forest&quot; (1954). After &quot;The Runaway Bus&quot; (1955) with Frankie Howerd he made &quot;Life with the Lyons&quot; (1955) with Daniels and Lyon, a spin off of their radio show. It was popular enough for Guest to make a sequel &quot;The Lyons in Paris&quot; (1955).

He did a thriller &quot;Break in the Circle&quot; (1954) and &quot;Dance, Little Lady&quot; (1954).

Despite his career in comedy films, he was offered the chance to direct Hammer&#x27;s first Quatermass film, adapted from the BBC television serial by Nigel Kneale. Uncertain about taking it on, (he was not a fan of science fiction), he was persuaded to do so by his wife, Yolande Donlan. Guest shot &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; (1955) as though it was a television documentary. Its success led to the Hammer company changing its direction.

He followed it with a drama &quot;They Can&#x27;t Hang Me&quot; (1955) and musical &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful World&quot; (1956). Republic Pictures hired him to make the thriller &quot;The Weapon&quot; (1956) and he directed a comedy, &quot;Carry On Admiral&quot; (1957).

&quot;Quatermass&quot; had been a big hit and Hammer asked Guest to direct the first sequel, &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; (1957). They also used him to do &quot;The Abominable Snowman&quot; (1957), from a Kneale TV play, and a POW movie, &quot;The Camp on Blood Island&quot; (1958).

Guest made a comedy &quot;Up the Creek&quot; which led to a sequel &quot;Further Up the Creek&quot; (1958).

Hammer asked him back to do another war movie, &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enemy&quot; (1959) with Stanley Baker. Then he made the film version of &quot;Expresso Bongo&quot; (1959) with Donlan, giving an early role to Cliff Richard.

Guest returned to comedy with &quot;Life Is a Circus&quot; (1960) starring Bud Flanagan. He made another for Hammer with Stanley Baker, a tough crime film, &quot;Hell Is a City&quot; (1960). He followed this with a thriller for Hammer, &quot;The Full Treatment&quot; (1960).

Guest&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Day the Earth Caught Fire&quot; (1961), won Guest and Wolf Mankowitz a BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay.

Guest made &quot;Jigsaw&quot; (1962) and &quot;80,000 Suspects&quot; (1963). &quot;The Beauty Jungle&quot; (1964) was an exposé on beauty competitions. &quot;Where the Spies Are&quot; (1965) was a spy film for MGM starring David Niven.

==Later career==
Guest was one of five credited directors to work on the spoof James Bond film &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), a critically mauled picture in its day. Producer Charles K. Feldman asked Guest if he would direct linking material to make what was left uncompleted, after the departure of Peter Sellers from the project, into a coherent narrative. Guest opted for an &#x27;Additional Sequences&#x27; credit after he saw the completed film.

He made a thriller &quot;Assignment K&quot; (1968) then a musical &quot;Toomorrow&quot; (1970) which, according to Christopher Hawtree, it is &quot;a staggeringly dreadful movie&quot;. Guest issued an injunction against Harry Saltzman, the producer, because he had not been paid for his work, and the film was quickly pulled from screenings. Around the same time, Guest wrote and directed &quot;When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth&quot; (1970) for Hammer.

Guest directed the softcore sex comedy &quot;Au Pair Girls&quot; (1972), followed by &quot;Confessions of a Window Cleaner&quot; (1974), the first of the &quot;Confessions&quot; series of sex comedies. He was also working in television, directing episodes of series including &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; (1971–72), &quot;The Adventurer&quot; (1972–73) and &quot;&quot; (1976–77). He continued to direct films, including &quot;Killer Force&quot; (1976).

Guest&#x27;s final feature film work was writing and directing &quot;The Boys in Blue&quot; (1982), a vehicle for the British comedy double act Cannon and Ball. It was a remake of the Will Hay picture &quot;Ask a Policeman&quot; (1939), which Guest had co-written. In 2001 he published an autobiography, &quot;So You Want to be in Pictures&quot;.

His last professional work was as the director of several episodes of the &quot;Hammer House of Mystery and Suspense&quot; TV series in 1984 and 1985.

==Private life and honours==

Originally married to Pat Watson, the couple divorced after Guest fell in love with American actress Yolande Donlan who eventually became his wife in 1954; Donlan appeared in eight of his films during the 1950s. After Guest retired in 1985, the couple lived together in retirement in California.

In 2004, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to Guest and Donlan. Guest died in a hospice in Palm Desert, California from prostate cancer at the age of 94.

<text>Gerald Wexler (January 10, 1917 – August 15, 2008) was a music journalist turned music producer, and was a major influence on American popular music from the 1950s through the 1980s. He coined the term &quot;rhythm and blues&quot;, and was integral in signing and/or producing many of the biggest acts of the time, including Ray Charles, the Allman Brothers, Chris Connor, Aretha Franklin, Led Zeppelin, Wilson Pickett, Dire Straits, Dusty Springfield and Bob Dylan. Wexler was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and in 2017 to the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Wexler was born in the Bronx, New York City, the son of a German Jewish father and a Russian Jewish mother; he grew up in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan. Despite graduating from George Washington High School at the age of 15, he dropped out of the City College of New York after two semesters. In 1935, Wexler enrolled at what is now Kansas State University, where he studied intermittently for several years. After being in the U.S. Army, Wexler became a serious student and he graduated from Kansas State with a B.A. degree in journalism in 1946.

==Career==
During his time as an editor, reporter, and writer for &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot;, Wexler coined the term &quot;rhythm and blues&quot;. In June 1949, at his suggestion, the magazine changed the name of the Race Records chart to Rhythm &amp; Blues Records. Wexler wrote, &quot;″Race&#x27; was a common term then, a self-referral used by blacks... On the other hand, &#x27;Race Records&#x27; didn&#x27;t sit well... I came up with a handle I thought suited the music well–&#x27;rhythm and blues&#x27;... [It was] a label more appropriate to more enlightened times.&quot;

Wexler became a partner in Atlantic Records in 1953. Ray Charles, the Drifters and Ruth Brown recorded classic recordings there. With Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun, Wexler built Atlantic into a major force in the recording industry.

In the 1960s, he recorded Wilson Pickett and Aretha Franklin, and oversaw production of Dusty Springfield&#x27;s highly acclaimed &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; and Lulu&#x27;s &quot;New Routes&quot; albums. He also cultivated a tight relationship, and a distribution deal, with Stax Records founder Jim Stewart, was an enthusiastic proponent of the then-developing Muscle Shoals Sound and launched the fortunes of Muscle Shoals Sound Studios and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. In 1967 he was named Record Executive of the Year for turning Aretha Franklin&#x27;s career around. In November 1966, Franklin&#x27;s Columbia recording contract expired; at that time, she owed the company money because record sales had not met expectations. Working with Wexler and Atlantic, Franklin was &quot;the most successful singer in the nation&quot; by 1968. His work in this decade put Atlantic at the forefront of soul music.

In 1968, he and Ahmet Ertegun signed Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records on the recommendation of singer Dusty Springfield who had worked with John Paul Jones and from what they knew of the band&#x27;s guitarist, Jimmy Page, from his performances with the Yardbirds. With its strong catalog, Atlantic Records was purchased by Warner Bros. Records in 1968. Prior to the sale, Wexler persuaded Jim Stewart to sign a contract (that he didn&#x27;t read), unknowingly giving Atlantic ownership of 97% of the Stax master recordings, without compensation. In 1975, Wexler moved from Atlantic to its parent Warner Records.

In 1979, Wexler produced Bob Dylan&#x27;s controversial first &quot;born again&quot; album, &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot; at Muscle Shoals; a single from that album, &quot;Gotta Serve Somebody&quot;, won a Grammy Award in 1980. When Wexler agreed to produce, he was unaware of the nature of the material that awaited him. &quot;Naturally, I wanted to do the album in Muscle Shoals—as Bob did—but we decided to prep it in L.A., where Bob lived,&quot; recalled Wexler. &quot;That&#x27;s when I learned what the songs were about: born-again Christians in the old corral... I like the irony of Bob coming to me, the Wandering Jew, to get the Jesus feel... [But] I had no idea he was on this born-again Christian trip until he started to evangelize me. I said, &#x27;Bob, you&#x27;re dealing with a sixty-two-year-old confirmed Jewish atheist. I&#x27;m hopeless. Let&#x27;s just make an album.

In 1983, Wexler recorded with UK singer/songwriter George Michael. The most famous out-take of these sessions would prove to be a rare early version of &quot;Careless Whisper&quot;, recorded in Muscle Shoals. In 1987, Wexler was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He retired from the music business in the late 1990s.

For most of the 1990s, Wexler lived on David&#x27;s Lane in East Hampton, New York where he shared living space with a Chinese family who aided him with daily functions and kept him company.

==Portrayals==
In &quot;Ray&quot;, the biopic of Ray Charles, Wexler is portrayed by Richard Schiff. Wexler is portrayed by Marc Maron in the 2021 movie &quot;Respect&quot;, the life story of Aretha Franklin, and by David Cross in season three of the television show &quot;Genius&quot;. Tom Thurman produced and directed a documentary film about Wexler, &quot;Immaculate Funk&quot; (2000). The film takes its name from Wexler&#x27;s own expression for the Atlantic sound.

== Personal life ==
Wexler was married three times. In 1941, he married Shirley Kampf; they had three children before divorcing. His second wife was Renee Pappas. His third wife was Jean Arnold, a playwright and novelist.

==Death==
Jerry Wexler died at his home in Sarasota, Florida, on August 15, 2008, aged 91, from congestive heart failure. Asked by a documentary filmmaker several years before his death what he wanted on his tombstone, Wexler replied: &quot;Two words: &#x27;More bass&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="897626" wikidata="Q3768142" url="?curid=897626" title="Plesiomonas shigelloides">
<text>Plesiomonas shigelloides is a species of bacteria and the only member of its genus. It is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium which has been isolated from freshwater, freshwater fish, shellfish, cattle, goats, swine, cats, dogs, monkeys, vultures, snakes, toads and humans. It is considered a fecal coliform. &quot;P. shigelloides&quot; is a global distributed species, found globally outside of the polar ice caps.

&quot;P. shigelloides&quot; has been associated with the diarrheal disease state in humans, but has been identified in healthy humans as well. It can enter the body either through contact with water contaminated by fecal matter or through seafood originating from a contaminated source.

== Classification ==
&quot;P. shigelloides&quot; was originally considered part of the family &quot;Vibrionaceae&quot;, but is generally accepted to be part of &quot;Enterobacteriaceae&quot; due to the similarity of its 5S rRNA sequence to other members of &quot;Enterobacteriaceae&quot;&quot;.&quot; The rRNA sequence of &quot;P. shigelloides&quot; has been found to be most similar to &quot;Proteus mirabilis,&quot; and as a result it is now considered part of the tribe &quot;Proteeae&quot; within the family &quot;Enterobacteriaceae&quot;. &quot;P. shigelloides&quot; is the only known member of its genus.

== Ecology ==

=== Growth ===
&quot;P. shigelloides&quot; is incapable of surviving in saltwater environments where the concentration of salt is greater than 4% and has been found to tolerate pH ranges between 4.5 and 9. It grows optimally between 35 °C and 39 °C, and has been found to survive in the temperature range of 8 °C to 45 °C. The effects of pH, salinity, temperature, turbidity, and conductivity on concentrations of &quot;P. shigelloides&quot; in freshwater conditions is not currently understood.

=== Identification ===
Some &quot;Plesiomonas&quot; strains share antigens with &quot;Shigella sonnei&quot; and &quot;Shigella flexneri&quot; and cross-reactions with &quot;Shigella&quot; antisera may occur. &quot;Plesiomonas&quot; can be distinguished from &quot;Shigella&quot; in diarrheal stools by an oxidase test: &quot;Plesiomonas&quot; is oxidase positive and &quot;Shigella&quot; is oxidase negative. &quot;Plesiomonas&quot; is easily differentiated from &quot;Aeromonas sp.&quot; and other oxidase-positive organisms by standard biochemical tests.

== Pathogenicity ==

=== Human infection ===
&quot;P. shigelloides&quot; has been isolated from a wide variety of human clinical specimens including both intestinal (usually feces or rectal swabs) and extra-intestinal. It has been isolated from the feces of humans, both with and without diarrhea, and/or vomiting (gastroenteritis). Although reports have found a link between &quot;P. shigelloides&quot; and diarrhea or gastroenteritis, research has not yet determined whether this bacteria is always responsible for these conditions.

=== Infection of other animals ===
Although &quot;P. shigelloides&quot; is primarily associated with the diarrheal disease state in humans, certain animals including cats and dogs have been found to frequently carry the bacterium while in a healthy state. Freshwater fish can often be infected with &quot;P. shigelloides&quot; which can be lethal depending on the concentration of the bacterium in their bodies.

<text>Labyrinth is an Italian power metal band formed in 1994 in Massa, Tuscany. The band underwent a change in style and themes after the departure of Olaf Thorsen in 2002.

== History ==

=== 1990s ===
Labyrinth formed in 1994 with a lineup of Franco Rubulotta (Frank Andiver-drums), Luca Contini (Ken Taylor-keyboards), Andrea Bartoletti (bass guitar), Andrea Cantarelli (Anders Rain-lead guitar), Carlo Andrea Magnani (Olaf Thorsen-lead guitar), Fabio Tordiglione (Joe Terry-vocals).

The band released their first demo &quot;Midnight Resistance&quot;. The demo got enthusiastic reviews in major metal magazines in Italy and Germany and that gave them the chance to sign with Underground Symphony, a new indie record label. Andrea Bartoletti left the band and was replaced by Chris Breeze (Cristiano Bertocchi). &quot;Piece of Time&quot;, their first EP, marked the direction the band was taking: pure melodic speed metal with a keyboards-background.

In 1995, &quot;No Limits&quot; was released and the interest in the band grew among metal fans and independent labels. The popularity of the band increased not only in the Italy and in Europe, but also overseas where some labels (Teichiku Records in Japan) offered to distribute the album. The band was in the metal magazine &quot;Burrn!&quot;″s top ten charts for almost six months. Joe Terry (Fabio Tordiglione) left the band and later becoming the frontman with Rhapsody of Fire.

In 1997, Frank Andiver (Franco Rubulotta) and Ken Taylor (Luca Contini) left the band (however they took part in the composing of &quot;Return to Heaven Denied&quot;); and Rob Tyrant (Roberto Tiranti), Mat Stancioiu (Mattia Stancioiu) and Andrew McPauls (Andrea De Paoli) were brought in as their replacements. All the while, some of the big metal labels showed an interest on the band&#x27;s new demo and finally Metal Blade Records made an offer and the band joined the label. It took six months to record the second album &quot;Return to Heaven Denied&quot; and before its release the band took part in that summer&#x27;s metal main event: &quot;Gods of Metal&quot;, together with some of heavy metal&#x27;s biggest acts such as Black Sabbath, Pantera, Helloween, Blind Guardian, etc. &quot;Return To Heaven Denied&quot; was a success among fans and metal magazines alike, and it gave a strong push not only to the career of the band, but also to the Italian metal scene as a whole.

Shortly after the release of the new record the singer Rob Tyrant left the band, replaced by Morby from Domine who was with Labyrinth throughout the whole European tour as supporting act with Pegazus of the most popular bands HammerFall and Primal Fear. After a few months, it followed an Italian tour with Heimdall. Then, Rob Tyrant returned to the band. After a short break the band entered the recording studio to release the new Mini CD &quot;Timeless Crime&quot;, containing new and old tracks from the first demotape &quot;Midnight Resistance&quot; to LPs &quot;No Limits&quot; and &quot;Return to Heaven Denied&quot;.

=== 2000s ===
After these festivals, the band entered the recording studio again to release the new full-length album &quot;Sons Of Thunder&quot;. As a showcase for the new album, the band played at important European festivals, like WACKEN 2000 and Rock Machina 2000 in Spain. At the end of August 2000, &quot;Sons Of Thunder&quot; went to No. 52 on the Japanese charts and at No. 26 on the Italian charts. The band then toured South America with Vision Divine.

The band organized an Italian tour first, in February 2001, with supporting band Sigma (ex Love Machine), and then a European tour, supporting Helloween first and then with Nocturnal Rites supporting Iron Savior.

The band organized, in March 2002, a tour called &quot;Italian Attack&quot;. A festival in which Domine, White Skull, Skylark, Novembre, and Centurion appeared. Their participation in these tours help raise the popularity of Labyrinth. In May of that year, the band began writing new material.

In the meantime, Olaf Thorsen left the band to join Vision Divine, whereas Mat Stancioiu and Andrew McPauls left Vision Divine to dedicate all their attention to Labyrinth. In July the first demo of the new Labyrinth album appeared. For the first time, the members decided to use their Italian names: Andrea Cantarelli, Roberto Tiranti, Andrea De Paoli, Cristiano Bertocchi, and Mattia Stancioiu.

The clear and sharp recording of the new demo procured them three of the most important deals of their career: Century Media Records for Europe and Americas, V2 for Italy and King Records for Japan.

In January, Labyrinth began recording the new self-titled album, with the band self-producing again. It was recorded at the Noise Factory in Milan, Italy, and it was mastered at House of Audio in Germany.

On 24 April 2003 Labyrinth signed a record deal with Century Media Records. The release date for their next album was set for 30 June 2003. The release of &quot;Labyrinth&quot; originally set for 30 June, was postponed in Italy to 4 July.

On 9 August 2003, Labyrinth performed at the 9th Agglutination Metal Festival in Chiaromonte, Italy. Other bands set to appear at the event included Vader, Virgin Steele and Elvenking.

Roberto Tiranti took part in the musical &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; until the beginning of the year 2004.

The next step was finding another good guitarist for the live dates. The band found in Pier Gonella, Roberto and Andrea De Paoli. The first show with Pier was the IX Agglutination Metal Festival in Chiaromonte (PZ), where Labyrinth would have been the third band, before Vader and Virgin Steele.

After the summer, the band began preparations for the live shows to support the new album. It was a tour out of the usual standard, without an estimated end: The Maze On Tour 2003/2004. From December 2003, with the tour, also began the work on the new album foreseen for Fall 2004, during which the band celebrated 10 years together. The new work was a prosecution of the way begun with &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, with songs of deep atmosphere and tracks like &quot;Just Soldier&quot;, but with a deeper introspection. Taking part with good and dense ideas to the writing of the new tracks, Pier Gonella with the beginning of 2004 joined the band as sixth official member. Also in December, Rob Tyrant (Roberto Trianti) recorded guest vocals on the rock opera &quot;Genius &#x27;Episode II&#x27;&quot; along with people such as Eric Martin (formerly of Mr. Big), Russell Allen (from Symphony X), Jeff Martin (of Racer X), Mark Boals (formerly of Yngwie Malmsteen), Daniel Gildenlöw (of Pain of Salvation), Liv Kristine (formerly of Theatre of Tragedy), and Edu Falaschi (of Angra).

&quot;Labyrinth&quot; put the band to work one more time, with big support of Century Media, in Japan good sales with King Records and then in the month of May a tour in Asia called &quot;Banzai Tour&quot; in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, Taipei, Taichung, Taiwan, and Beijing, China and also Hong Kong.

After some shows in Italy, Labyrinth played in Slovakia at More Than Festival 2004 with bands like Lost Horizons, Destruction, and Freedom Call.

On 9 December 2004, they performed a show in London at Underworld Cadmen together with Dream Evil. One week later Labyrinth signed a deal with the label Arise records.

With &quot;Freeman&quot;, there was a new look with strength-jackets and more wish of freedom in the lyrics; both for Italian and Japanese releases, there is a normal version and one with a bonus DVD.

On 22 February 2005, Labyrinth announced the dates of an Italian tour in support of their upcoming album, &quot;Freeman&quot;. The tour would consist of, seven total shows, ranging from 25 March 2005 through and including 16 April 2005. The follow-up to 2003&#x27;s &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;Freeman&quot; was recorded at Elnor Studios and scheduled for release on 4 March 2005 by Arise Records. &quot;Freeman&quot; was released in March 2005, in which the band showed more aggressive riffs and melodic parts at the same time. The album, was released in 2005 through Arise Records. The Italian version of the album contained the exclusive bonus DVD with a Tokyo show (Banzai Tour 2004), &quot;best of&quot; London Cadmen Underworld (from 13 November 2004), the &quot;L.Y.A.F.H.&quot; and &quot;Freeman&quot; videos, pictures and discography.

Later that month on 21 March 2005, Headrush, an Italian hard rock band featuring ex-Dokken guitarist Alex De Rosso and Labyrinth singer Roberto Tiranti, released their debut album in Europe via Frontiers Records (and in Japan via King Records). Also, in March 2005 singer Roberto Tiranti appeared on Secret Sphere album &quot;Heart &amp; Anger&quot;.

That summer after the Lorca Rock Festival, Labyrinth played a tour in Italy (a total of 17 shows) and supported Dream Theater and Angra in Italy for three shows ( 21–23 June), in Italy (21 June 2005 in Florence, on 22 June 2005 in Ascoli Piceno, and on 23 June in Padova) with Angra. Later, on 14 August 2005, Labyrinth took part in the Metalway Festival in Gernika-Bilbao with bands like Manowar, Saxon, Accept, Motörhead, W.A.S.P. and more.

2006 started with bad news, Cristiano Bertocchi left the band, to pursue a solo career. After few days of Mattia suggested Roberto to become the new bass player. They played only two shows with this new line up, one at Mesiano in Trento and another at the Evolution Festival, then spent the rest of the year writing and recording &quot;6 Days to Nowhere&quot;.

In December Heraldry released their album &quot;Delirium&quot;, which featured guest vocals by Roberto Tiranti.

In late 2006, Labyrinth signed a record deal with Scarlet Records, to release &quot;6 Days to Nowhere&quot;. Between 26 February, and 9 March, the album &quot;6 Days To Nowhere&quot; was released worldwide. The album&#x27;s mastering took place at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London. Following the album&#x27;s release the band announced a tour of Europe (only one date in Sweden and the rest in Italy) and Japan, between 27 October 2007 and 2 March 2008.

On 3 November 2007 Labyrinth appeared at the Växjö Metal Festival III, in Växjö, Sweden. Also scheduled to appear were Jorn, Grave, Heed, Bloodbound, Engel and Pagan&#x27;s Mind, among others.

Pier Gonella handled the guitar duties, on the Necrodeath album &quot;Draculea&quot; While Pier performed on that album, Roberto Tiranti appeared on Ranfa&#x27;s album &quot;Little Hard Blues&quot;. Tiranti appeared on the album&#x27;s fifth track entitled &quot;It Will Be Not This Blues&quot;.

On 22 January 2008, it was announced that Andrea De Paoli would be making a guest appearance on the debut album of Expedition Delta, which is being released by ProgRock Records.
In summer 2008 Pier Gonella left the band to dedicate himself totally to Necrodeath and his new heavy metal band Mastercastle.

On 11 September 2009 Olaf reunited with Labyrinth to record &quot;Return to Heaven Denied Pt. II: &quot;A Midnight Autumn&#x27;s Dream&quot;&quot;, a follower of their successful album from 1998. In October 2009 was also announced the new bassist Sergio Pagnacco (with courtesy of Vanexa historical italian metal band)). Also, drummer Mattia Stancioiu left the band to be a full-time sound engineer and producer and be a part-time drummer.

=== 2010s ===

In 2011 they toured with Sonata Arctica.

In 2014, Roberto Tiranti announced that he was leaving the band to embark on a solo career, but the new announced vocalist Mark Boals never joined the band.

In 2016, the band announced they are working on a new album which is planned for release with record company Frontiers Music Srl in 2017. It was also announced the band&#x27;s line-up reunion of founding members Olaf Thorsen and Andrea Cantarelli on guitars with Roberto Tiranti on lead vocals, along with John Macaluso (former Ark, Yngwie Malmsteen, James LaBrie, Riot, Starbreaker, and TNT) on drums, Oleg Smirnoff (former Vision Divine, Eldritch, Death SS) on keyboards and Nik Mazzucconi on bass. In February 2017, the album&#x27; title (&quot;Architecture of a God&quot;), track-list and cover were revealed.

<text>In mathematics, a derivation is a function on an algebra that generalizes certain features of the derivative operator. Specifically, given an algebra &quot;A&quot; over a ring or a field &quot;K&quot;, a &quot;K&quot;-derivation is a &quot;K&quot;-linear map that satisfies Leibniz&#x27;s law:

:formula_1

More generally, if &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;A&quot;-bimodule, a &quot;K&quot;-linear map that satisfies the Leibniz law is also called a derivation. The collection of all &quot;K&quot;-derivations of &quot;A&quot; to itself is denoted by Der&quot;K&quot;(&quot;A&quot;). The collection of &quot;K&quot;-derivations of &quot;A&quot; into an &quot;A&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; is denoted by .

Derivations occur in many different contexts in diverse areas of mathematics. The partial derivative with respect to a variable is an R-derivation on the algebra of real-valued differentiable functions on R&quot;n&quot;. The Lie derivative with respect to a vector field is an R-derivation on the algebra of differentiable functions on a differentiable manifold; more generally it is a derivation on the tensor algebra of a manifold. It follows that the adjoint representation of a Lie algebra is a derivation on that algebra. The Pincherle derivative is an example of a derivation in abstract algebra. If the algebra &quot;A&quot; is noncommutative, then the commutator with respect to an element of the algebra &quot;A&quot; defines a linear endomorphism of &quot;A&quot; to itself, which is a derivation over &quot;K&quot;. That is,
:formula_2
where formula_3 is the commutator with respect to formula_4. An algebra &quot;A&quot; equipped with a distinguished derivation &quot;d&quot; forms a differential algebra, and is itself a significant object of study in areas such as differential Galois theory.

==Properties==

If &quot;A&quot; is a &quot;K&quot;-algebra, for &quot;K&quot; a ring, and is a &quot;K&quot;-derivation, then
* If &quot;A&quot; has a unit 1, then &quot;D&quot;(1) = &quot;D&quot;(12) = 2&quot;D&quot;(1), so that &quot;D&quot;(1) = 0. Thus by &quot;K&quot;-linearity, &quot;D&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) = 0 for all .
* If &quot;A&quot; is commutative, &quot;D&quot;(&quot;x&quot;2) = &quot;xD&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) + &quot;D&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;x&quot; = 2&quot;xD&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), and &quot;D&quot;(&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;nx&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1&quot;D&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), by the Leibniz rule.
* More generally, for any , it follows by induction that 
*: formula_5
: which is formula_6 if for all , commutes with formula_7.
* For &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; is not a derivation, instead satisfying a higher-order Leibniz rule:
:: formula_8
: Moreover, if &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;A&quot;-bimodule, write
:: formula_9
:for the set of &quot;K&quot;-derivations from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;M&quot;.
* is a module over &quot;K&quot;. 
* Der&quot;K&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is a Lie algebra with Lie bracket defined by the commutator:
:: formula_10
: since it is readily verified that the commutator of two derivations is again a derivation.
* There is an &quot;A&quot;-module (called the Kähler differentials) with a &quot;K&quot;-derivation through which any derivation factors. That is, for any derivation &quot;D&quot; there is a &quot;A&quot;-module map with
:: formula_11
: The correspondence formula_12 is an isomorphism of &quot;A&quot;-modules:
:: formula_13
* If is a subring, then &quot;A&quot; inherits a &quot;k&quot;-algebra structure, so there is an inclusion
:: formula_14
: since any &quot;K&quot;-derivation is &quot;a fortiori&quot; a &quot;k&quot;-derivation.

== Graded derivations ==
Given a graded algebra &quot;A&quot; and a homogeneous linear map &quot;D&quot; of grade on &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D&quot; is a homogeneous derivation if 
:formula_15
for every homogeneous element &quot;a&quot; and every element &quot;b&quot; of &quot;A&quot; for a commutator factor . A graded derivation is sum of homogeneous derivations with the same &quot;ε&quot;.

If , this definition reduces to the usual case. If , however, then
:formula_16 
for odd , and &quot;D&quot; is called an anti-derivation.

Examples of anti-derivations include the exterior derivative and the interior product acting on differential forms.

Graded derivations of superalgebras (i.e. Z2-graded algebras) are often called superderivations.

==Related notions==

Hasse–Schmidt derivations are &quot;K&quot;-algebra homomorphisms

:formula_17

Composing further with the map that sends a formal power series formula_18 to the coefficient formula_19 gives a derivation.

<text>George Ellsworthy &quot;Roy&quot; Redgrave (26 April 1873 – 25 May 1922) was an English stage and silent film actor. Redgrave is considered to be the first member of the Redgrave acting dynasty.

==Early life==
Born George Edward Redgrave in 122 Kennington Road, Kennington, a district of Lambeth in South London in 1873, he was the eldest son of George Augustus Redgrave (1851–81), a maker of the board game Bagatelle, and Zoe Beatrice Elsworthy (&quot;née&quot; Pym, later Howard; 1856–1936). By 1897, he was professionally known as Roy Redgrave apparently in the belief that he was descended from Rob Roy. The Redgrave family originated in the Northamptonshire village of Crick. Redgrave also assumed the middle name &quot;Elsworthy&quot; from his mother, and his sister took the stage name Dolly Elsworthy. Redgrave was the eldest of five siblings.

==Family and career==
His first wife was actress Ellen Maud Pratt, the daughter of prosperous Devon farmer John Dew Pratt of Buckland Monachorum. Her stage name was Judith Kyrle. They were married in Littleham-cum-Exmouth, Devon on 1 September 1894. Their careers reached a high point at their joint debut at the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton in April 1900 with Roy billed as &quot;The Dramatic Cock o&#x27; the North&quot;. They had three children, John Kyrle born in 1895, Robin Roy (father of Major-General Sir Roy Redgrave) born in 1897 and Nellie Maud born in 1898.

About this time Redgrave fell in love with a young actress named Esther Mary Cooke (known on the stage as Ettie Carlisle), daughter of Victor Cooke, huntsman and riding master. Ellen discovered the affair and Ettie fled Britain for South Africa. Redgrave followed her to South Africa. Ettie married Clayton Parrett by special licence between 28 October and 10 November 1903, on a Sunday at St. George&#x27;s Cathedral in Cape Town. Redgrave arrived two days later on the Tuesday. Ettie then left Clayton Parrett and went with Redgrave to Australia where she then bore him a son, Victor Redgrave Parrett, born 25 July 1906 in Australia.

At some point after initial Australian theatre work, Redgrave left for England alone. According to the &quot;History of Australian Theatre&quot; archives, American actress Minnie Tittell Brune made her first appearance in Australia on 21 September 1904 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Sydney in the play &quot;Sunday&quot;, supported by Roy Redgrave. Roy toured with her on the J.C. Williamson circuit. According to Corin Redgrave, Ellen (Judith) pursued Roy to Australia, arriving in time to pay his unsettled hotel bills, but she was unable to persuade him to return home with her to his family. Ellen remarried Frederick John Nettlefold, a respectable landed gentleman, in Brighton, England in 1907.

However Redgrave did return to Britain, appearing in repertory at the Grand Theatre, Brighton, where he met Daisy Bertha Mary Scudamore. She eventually adopted the stage name Margaret Scudamore. They married at Glasgow Register Office in 1907 while touring in the north and had one child, the actor Sir Michael Redgrave born on 20 March 1908, later to become the father of actors Vanessa, Corin and Lynn.

Six months after Michael&#x27;s birth, Redgrave left Daisy (Margaret) and returned to Australia again, this time permanently. William Anderson, a Melbourne producer, had just built the King&#x27;s Theatre, and needed actors. His name appears in June 1909, when he performed in the play &quot;The Bank of England&quot;. In 1910 he played Prince Michael in &quot;The Prince and the Beggar Maid&quot; in a tour of Australia. In the same year, Anderson, known for his fondness of the lurid and sensational, had Roy collaborate with him on a play about the just ended Dr. Crippen case. Crippen was hanged in November 1910. The play was called &quot;By Wireless Telegraphy&quot;, which was staged by Anderson at the King&#x27;s Theatre, Melbourne, from 22 October 1910. Anderson was ruined financially by an expensive flop, and had to lease away his King&#x27;s Theatre, and Redgrave turned his attention to the new and burgeoning film industry, under contract to Lincoln-Cass Films. Although he claimed he did not like motion picture acting he appeared in several silent films, beginning in 1911 with &quot;The Christian&quot;. Later he played the villain in &quot;Moondyne&quot; (1913) as well as six shorts, played the lead in &quot;Our Friends, the Hayseeds&quot; (1917), and co-starred in &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot; (1920). Back in the UK, the forsaken Daisy had changed her name to Margaret and married Captain James Anderson, a wealthy tea planter.

==Remaining in Australia==
Redgrave remained in Australia until his death sometime in the 1920s, but exactly where he lived and when he died remained a mystery to his family in Britain until his granddaughter Lynn Redgrave visited Sydney with her then husband John Clark, and vowed to find him. Their search ended at the Sydney Opera House library, where, as she recounts in her play &quot;Shakespeare for My Father&quot; (page 48), they came up with Redgrave&#x27;s obituary, learning that he had died on 25 May 1922, and was buried at South Head Cemetery. There they learned that he had been put in an unmarked grave by somebody called Minnie, who paid 15 shillings. (The idea that it may have been the religious Minnie Tittell Brune feeling sorry for him is enticing. More probably it was Minnie Hider, Esther&#x27;s friend and confidante, who brought Victor up). They found the spot, and arranged for a headstone, asked his son Michael what it should say, and he said to put, simply, &quot;Roy Redgrave, Actor&quot;. It was later discovered that Redgrave married Irish widow Mary Leresche in 1916. His marriage certificate makes reference to his previous marriage to Ellen (Judith) but not to any subsequent marriage to Daisy (Margaret Scudamore). Mary died in 1948.

<text>Karl Viktor Müllenhoff (born September 8, 1818, in Marne, Duchy of Holstein; died February 19, 1884, in Berlin) was a German philologist who specialized in Germanic studies.

==Biography==
He was born in Marne, Holstein as the second son of merchant Johann Anton Müllenhoff. In his youth, he received his education in the town of Meldorf (1830–1837). He later studied under Gregor Wilhelm Nitzsch at the University of Kiel, then continued his education at Leipzig (1839, under Gottfried Hermann and Moriz Haupt) and then in Berlin (1839-1841), where his instructors included Karl Lachmann and Wilhelm Grimm. In 1841 he received his PhD at Kiel with a dissertation on Sophocles.

He taught classes in German language, literature and mythology at the University of Kiel, where in 1854 he became a full professor of German literature and history. Afterwards, he returned to Berlin as a professor of German philology (1858-1884). In 1861 he became a member of the Gesetzlose Gesellschaft zu Berlin. Two of his well-known students in Berlin were Wilhelm Scherer and Elias von Steinmeyer.

In 1863 he introduced a theory involving the continuity of written language dating from the era of Old High German. 

From around 1875, he resided at Schellingstraße 7 (Berlin-Tiergarten), a few years later, moving to a house on Lützowufer in the same district. He was buried in the Alter St.-Matthäus-Kirchhof in Berlin-Schöneberg. In 1896, a thoroughfare called &quot; Müllenhoffstraße&quot; (Berlin-Kreuzberg) was named in his honor.

<text>Thomas Dundas, 2nd Earl of Zetland (5 February 1795 – 6 May 1873), was a British nobleman and politician.

Born in Marylebone, London, eldest son of the 1st Earl and his wife Harriet Hale, he was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1818 he was elected Whig Member of Parliament for his father and grandfather&#x27;s old seat of Richmond, becoming representative for York twelve years later. In 1835 he returned to Parliament as member for Richmond, and four years later succeeded his father as second Earl of Zetland.

Like his father a prominent freemason, Lord Zetland was the United Grand Lodge of England&#x27;s Grand Master from 1844 to 1870. Zetland was a senior member of the Jockey Club and won The Derby and St Leger Stakes with his horse Voltigeur in 1850.

In the year of his succession to the earldom, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant and &quot;Custos Rotulorum&quot; of the North Riding of Yorkshire, and in 1861 became a Knight of the Thistle. He resigned the Order on being made a Knight Companion of the Garter in 1872, and died the following year at Aske Hall, Yorkshire.

He married, on 6 September 1823, Sophia Jane, daughter of Sir Hedworth Williamson, Bt.

<text>Three&#x27;s a Crowd (also known as Three&#x27;s Company, Too in the &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; syndication package) is an American sitcom television series produced as a spin-off and continuation of &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; that aired on ABC from September 25, 1984 (one week after the final episode of &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; was broadcast), until April 9, 1985, with reruns airing until September 10, 1985. It is loosely based on the British sitcom &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;, which was itself a spin-off of &quot;Man About the House&quot;, on which &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; was based.

==Plot==
In &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;&#x27;s final episodes, Vicky Bradford (Mary Cadorette) is introduced as a love interest of Jack Tripper (John Ritter), beginning with the episode titled &quot;Cupid Works Overtime&quot;. In the following two-part episode &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot;, Jack proposes marriage, but Vicky, afraid of marriage after witnessing her parents&#x27; tumultuous relationship and bitter divorce, declines the offer. Vicky instead convinces Jack to move in with her in the vacant apartment above his restaurant. Vicky&#x27;s wealthy father James Bradford (Robert Mandan) buys the building from Jack&#x27;s former boss Frank Angelino. James does not approve of Jack, and he constantly tries to disrupt his and Vicky&#x27;s relationship.

Other characters include E. Z. Taylor (Alan Campbell), Jack&#x27;s eccentric assistant at the bistro, and Claudia Bradford (Jessica Walter), Vicky&#x27;s mother and James&#x27;s ex-wife.

<doc id="897679" wikidata="Q295840" url="?curid=897679" title="Anzac-class frigate">
<text>The Anzac&quot; class(also identified as the ANZAC&quot; class and the MEKO 200 ANZ type) is a ship class of ten frigates; eight operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and two operated by the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN).

During the 1980s, the RAN began plans to replace the s (based on the British ) with a mid-capability patrol frigate and settled on the idea of modifying a proven German design for Australian conditions. Around the same time, the RNZN was seeking to replace their &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates while maintaining blue-water capabilities. A souring of relations between New Zealand and the United States in relation to New Zealand&#x27;s nuclear-free zone and the ANZUS security treaty prompted New Zealand to seek improved ties with other nations, particularly Australia. As both nations were seeking warships of similar capabilities, the decision was made in 1987 to collaborate on their acquisition.

The project name (and later, the class name) is taken from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps of the First World War.

Twelve ship designs were tendered in 1986. By 1989, the project had selected a proposal by Germany&#x27;s Blohm + Voss, based on their MEKO 200 design, to be built in Australia by AMECON at Williamstown, Victoria. The modular design of the frigates allowed sections to be constructed at Whangārei, New Zealand and Newcastle, New South Wales in addition to Williamstown. The RAN ordered eight ships, while the RNZN ordered two and had the option to add two more. The frigate acquisition was controversial and widely opposed in New Zealand, and as a result, the additional ships were not ordered.

In 1992, work started on the frigates; ships capable of a top speed, and a range of at . The armament initially consisted of a single 5-inch gun and a point-defence missile system, supported by a missile-armed helicopter. In addition, the ships were fitted for but not with a torpedo system, anti-ship missiles, and a close-in weapons system. The last ship of the class entered service in 2006; by this point, the RAN and RNZN had embarked on separate projects to improve the frigates&#x27; capabilities by fitting the additional weapons, along with updates to other systems and equipment.

Since entering service, &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigates have made multiple deployments outside local waters, including involvement in the INTERFET multi-national deployment to East Timor, and multiple operational periods in the Persian Gulf. , nine ships are in service following HMAS &quot;Anzac&quot;″s decommissioning in May 2024. The RAN intends to start replacing theirs in 2024, while the RNZN ships will remain active until the mid-2030s.

==Planning and development==
The &quot;Anzac&quot; class originated from the RAN&#x27;s New Surface Combatant (NSC) project, which began in the mid-1980s to find a replacement for the RAN&#x27;s six s. By 1985, various design briefs ranging from displacement were under consideration, with the RAN emphasising anti-ship missile defence, damage control, and ship survivability based on Royal Navy experiences during the Falklands War. Eventually, the project settled on a ship of approximately displacement. At this time, it was also believed that Australia did not have the capability to design a major warship from scratch, so the decision was made to select a proven foreign design and fit it with an Australian-developed combat system. In early 1986, a review of policy regarding surface combatants saw the NSC classified into the middle of three tiers: a patrol frigate designed to operate on low- to mid-intensity operations in Australia&#x27;s economic exclusion zone.

Around the same time, the need to replace the RNZN&#x27;s force with new warships was under consideration. The government saw maintaining a blue-water capable force built around three or four frigates as important, but the cost of acquiring and maintaining such a force was prohibitive, once it became clear on the basis of RN and RAN studies that the generally favored Type 21 design lacked the space and volume for the required range and development. A joint Anzac project offered the RNZN the first chance in 20 years for new deepwater warships. The NZ 1983 Defence Review on the basis of RN theoretical study and enthusiasm for the 2400 Vicker sub-project, saw a submarine force as the only way of maintaining an RNZN as a combat force, and the Muldoon government actually entered into a memo of understanding with Australia for the joint development of what became the s and assigned staff to the Australian project. However, it became clear that surface vessels were also required and the cost risk was too high. Alternate suggestions, such as reducing the RNZN to a coast guard-type force responsible for coastal and fisheries protection, replacing the frigates with smaller offshore patrol vessels, or reorienting the navy to primarily operate submarines, were made in several venues, but were seen as an unacceptable loss in capability. Around the same time, the 1984-elected Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand implemented a nuclear-free zone, which incensed the United States and led to a deterioration of relations between the two nations, including the American withdrawal of support for New Zealand under the ANZUS security treaty. In response, the New Zealand government sought to improve ties with Australia; one such avenue was to promote military interoperability between the countries by standardising equipment and procedures where possible. The Australian NSC project was seen to have &quot;virtually identical&quot; requirements to the RNZN&#x27;s proposed Replacement Combat Ship concept, and the need to replace the warships dovetailed with the need to improve relations with Australia.

On 6 March 1987, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the two nations and RNZN representatives were invited to collaborate on the project. To recognise their involvement, the project was renamed the &quot;Anzac&quot; Ship Project, taking the name from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps of World War I. The New Zealanders&#x27; involvement was structured to allow their involvement in the selection of the design and shipyard and explore options for New Zealand industry involvement. When the time came to commit, they could either continue cooperating into the construction stage of the project, independently order the ships from the designer or abandon the project entirely.

The proposed baseline characteristics called for a vessel capable of reaching speeds of and a range of at based on a combined diesel or gas (CODOG) propulsion system, able to operate in Sea State 5, and capable of operating a Seahawk-size helicopter. The ship was to be fitted with a main gun and an eight-cell launcher for a point-defence missile system, and fitted for but not with a torpedo system, anti-ship missiles, and a close-in weapons system. Tenders were requested by the project at the end of 1986, and 19 submissions were made, 12 of which included ship designs: the Netherlands&#x27; M-class (later ) frigate, a design based on the German MEKO 200 multipurpose frigate design, Italy&#x27;s frigate, the French F2000 design, the Canadian frigate, the German Type 122 (later frigate), Norway&#x27;s offshore patrol vessel, the British Type 23 frigate (which was proposed by two different shipyards), South Korea&#x27;s frigate, and an airship design proposed by Airship Industries. By August 1987, a cost ceiling of A$3.5 billion (1986 terms) was established, and the submitted proposals were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss&#x27;s MEKO design, the M class offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down version of the British Type 23 proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders. The Type 23 proposal was eliminated in November 1987, with the other two going into a development phase where the designer partnered with an Australian shipbuilder: Blohm + Voss with AMECON, and Royal Schelde with Australian Warship Systems.
On 14 August 1989, the Australian government announced that AMECON had been awarded the tender for construction of the &quot;Anzac&quot; class based on modified MEKO 200 design. Although both the MEKO 200 and M-class designs met the design requirements, the MEKO design was selected as more ships could be purchased for the budget cost. The A$5 billion contract was, at the time, the largest defence contract awarded in Australia. The decision was made despite ongoing debate in New Zealand over the project. New Zealand committed in principle to the purchase of two frigates plus the option for two more on 7 September, and the contract for the first two ships was signed on 10 November.

In 1992, the Australian Force Structure Review contained plans to replace the three guided-missile destroyers and four of the six guided-missile frigates with air defence vessels. The initial proposal – to build an additional six &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigates configured for wide-area anti-aircraft warfare – did not go ahead as the &quot;Anzac&quot; design was too small to effectively host all the required equipment and weapons. Instead, the RAN began to upgrade the &quot;Adelaide&quot;s in 1999 to fill the anti-aircraft capability that would be lost when the &quot;Perth&quot;s left service between 1999 and 2001, and began work on a long-term replacement of the destroyers with what became the air warfare destroyer.

===New Zealand controversy===

From the late 1960s decision of the UK government to withdraw the Royal Navy from East of Suez in the early 1970s considerable doubt existed within the RNZN, the government, and community about the continuing relevance, viability, and usefulness of an RNZN force of three to four frigates. The option of the United States Coast Guard&#x27;s (USCG) s was seriously considered as an alternative to the order of HMNZS &quot;Canterbury&quot; in 1968, which was approved under the understanding that New Zealand would hold continued access to the UK market after Britain entered the European Economic Community and was affordable only because it was part of a British deal with the Yarrow shipyard to build seven RN, Chilean and RNZN &quot;Leander&quot;s at less than the cost to save shipyard jobs in Scotland.

During the late 1970s, proposals for a modified &quot;Hamilton&quot;-class cutter with less range or the RN Type 21 frigate with similar anti-submarine capability to a &quot;Leander&quot; but with a smaller crew and with less AW, AA, an AD. Both these proposals and others for full combat Dutch or American s were rejected by the Muldoon government and in the early 1980s a number of retired naval officers and political scientists like Helen Clark and Robert Miles were seriously debating and writing papers and articles suggesting options such as RN OPVs, the and the USCG&#x27;s WMEC &quot;Bear&quot; class. The navy was interested in some of these ideas, but only for the option proposed by the 1978 Defence Review of acquiring two OPVs to patrol the expanded EEZ and free the &quot;Leander&quot;s for other uses and for replacement of the inadequate and worn out s. After the election of the Lange Labour government, thinking on alternatives to frigates for the RNZN had moved towards purpose-built designs rather like the Irish Navy&#x27;s patrol corvette, a sort of 1,800-ton high endurance corvette with &quot;Leander&quot;-like helicopter hangar and pad or small Meko 100–140 designs rather different from the s built for Argentina. After the nuclear ships crisis and other events, the acquisition of some &quot;Anzac&quot; frigates was virtually certain, because the key Labour MP Jim Anderton either accepted the &quot;Anzac&quot; ships as a necessary increased self-defence capability with the securing of a nuclear-free policy or tacitly agreed not to oppose it like Helen Clark.

The new most touted off-the-shelf options in 1986–88 (the Castle and &quot;Bear&quot;-class vessels) were no longer possible as the Scottish shipbuilders had closed and development of the &quot;Bear&quot; cutter option into a stretched vessel was effectively impossible after the ANZUS impasse. The New Zealand government&#x27;s planned acquisition of the &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigates was a major point of debate and contention: researcher Peter Greener claims that it &quot;was possibly the most strongly debated defence purchase of the century&quot;. In New Zealand, at the time, &quot;frigate&quot; was a dirty word and attempts to make the replacement of the old navy ships more palatable to the public included using euphemisms like &quot;ocean combat ship&quot; and &quot;ocean surveillance vessel&quot;. The government&#x27;s official stance was dedication to maintaining a blue-water navy, primarily in order to defend the nation and contribute to regional security. Despite this, the government was slow to respond to opponents of the project which included peace campaigners, politicians (from both within and outside the Labour Party, and from both ends of the political spectrum), and military personnel. Most of the concern revolved around the cost of purchasing frigate-type ships, along with the idea that four high-capability warships would be too few and too overspecialised to operate in the roles envisioned for the RNZN.

The primary role foreseen for the RNZN was fisheries protection, particularly following the introduction of a exclusive economic zZone by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea; this was thought to require a minimum of six vessels to effectively police. Peace campaigners claimed that the purchase of the &quot;Anzac&quot;s was a politically motivated decision made under pressure from Australia, which was trying to support its shipbuilding industry, and stated that the Fourth Labour Government was undermining its commitment to reduce the nation&#x27;s deficit by spending so much on high-tech warships (although figures of $NZ20 billion for purchase and 20 years of operation was misquoted as an upfront lump sum). There were also concerns that by possessing modern warships, New Zealand would be &quot;dragged&quot; back into ANZUS. One proposal suggested to avoid this was that the New Zealand &quot;Anzac&quot;s be fitted with inferior engines that would reduce the vessels&#x27; top speed and make it impossible to operate with United States Navy fleets. However, these changes would have incurred major additional expenses. A recurring alternate proposal was the purchase of the British Castle-class patrol vessel design. Two months after tenders for the project closed, the managing director of Svendborg Skibsværft began to campaign for the construction of the Danish IS-86 patrol vessel (later designated the frigate) for the RNZN. In response to these proposals, the government indicated that it was committing to purchasing Australian ships, and that interoperability with the RAN (which the alternate ship designs were incapable of) was a major element in the decision.

At the time of the August 1989 decision for AMECON to build the MEKO-based frigate, the controversy was still ongoing in New Zealand. David Lange, a major supporter of the &quot;Anzac&quot; project, had only just resigned from the prime ministership. Despite the Labour Party&#x27;s national conference rejecting the frigate project a year earlier, the purchase of two &quot;Anzac&quot;s, with the option to acquire two more, was approved by Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer&#x27;s cabinet on 4 September, then a majority of the Labour caucus on 7 September. From the government&#x27;s perspective, the &quot;Anzac&quot; project was being seen as a litmus test of New Zealand&#x27;s commitment to (among other things) relations with Australia and regional defence, particularly after the problems between New Zealand and the United States.

Despite the government signing contracts for the purchase of two &quot;Anzac&quot;s in November 1989, the project continued to be a bone of contention in New Zealand politics, particularly after the Fourth Labour Government lost the 1990 election to the National Party, which formed the Fourth National Government. In 1992, Minister of Defence Warren Cooper began claiming in several arenas that exercising the option for two more frigates may not be necessary. Following the 1996 election, the National Party retained power, but only in coalition with the New Zealand First party, which opposed the purchase of additional frigates. Other options for replacing the two remaining &quot;Leander&quot;s were explored, but these were generally more expensive than purchasing the &quot;Anzac&quot;s. The US Clinton Administration partly discredited the option of a third &quot;Anzac&quot; by formally offering the RNZN two &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigate shorthulls of 15–17 years age, purportedly armed with SM1 Standard missiles and later 28 F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft which it had refused to transfer to Pakistan. These offers were made partly because of US concern that Australia needed more regional defence support to conduct a more robust foreign and economic policy in SE Asia. However the F-16 offer, offered the NZ cabinet an option and out and they took it, rather than be immensely unpopular in both Canberra and Washington by rejecting both. In the view of NZ PM Jenny Shipley the Australians had made a good offer, but it was not good enough and there were many alternative ship designs. Internal political opposition, particularly from New Zealand First, prevented the exercising of the contract option for two more ships before it lapsed on 10 November 1997, at which point the government was considering the purchase of a single frigate outside the terms of the original contract. A year later, the idea was still being debated internally although the proposal had been downgraded to buying one of the active Australian &quot;Anzac&quot;s second-hand which the RAN could then replace by building an additional ship. At this point, the National-New Zealand First coalition had collapsed, and the National Party was only holding on to power by the support of minority parties and independents; support that was likely to be withdrawn if a third frigate was approved. Cabinet rejected the plan, and the issue of replacing the &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate was deferred.

==Design at launch==
The &quot;Anzac&quot; design is derived from Blohm + Voss&#x27; MEKO 200 PN (or ) frigate, and is identified by the company as the MEKO 200 ANZ. In addition to capability modifications to meet RAN and RNZN requirements, the ships were redesigned during the development phase to maximise the involvement of Australian and New Zealand industries through the use of locally sourced components: 80% of the materials (by value) was locally sourced, and within this, 20% must come from New Zealand. The &quot;Anzac&quot;s were designed to German Navy standards, except where Australian or United States standards were specifically requested.

Each frigate has a full load displacement. The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a draught at full load of . The hull and superstructure are of all-steel construction, and the ships are fitted with fin stabilisers.
The frigates use a combined diesel or gas (CODOG) propulsion machinery layout, with a single, General Electric LM2500-30 gas turbine and two MTU 12V1163 TB83 diesel engines driving the ship&#x27;s two controllable-pitch propellers. Maximum speed is , and maximum range is over at . The frigates&#x27; range is about 50% greater than other MEKO-type frigates, due to an enhanced fuel supply. Originally, two gas turbines were to be fitted; this layout would have provided a top speed of . The starboard turbine was cancelled to save costs.

The standard ship&#x27;s company of an &quot;Anzac&quot; consists of 22 officers and 141 sailors. Onboard electricity requirements are met by four MTU diesel generators. Each ship can carry up to of dry provisions, of refrigerated provisions, and of fresh water.

===Armament===
At the time of construction, the main weapon for the &quot;Anzac&quot;s was a United Defense 5-inch 54 calibre Mark 45 Mod 2 dual purpose gun. The forward-mounted gun is capable of firing shells at a rate of 20 rounds per minute, to a distance of . The barrel can elevate to 65 degrees. This was supplemented by an eight-cell Lockheed Martin Mark 41 Mod 5 vertical launch system for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles as a point-defence system. The Sea Sparrow is a semi-active radar homing missile, with a warhead, a range of , and a top speed of Mach 2.5. Two machine guns were fitted for close defence.

A missile-armed helicopter was a key component of the frigates&#x27; armament. When construction started, both navies were planning for, but had yet to identify, new helicopters to be operated by the frigates; as an interim measure, the RAN used Sikorsky S-70B-2 Seahawks, while the RNZN embarked Westland Wasps.

Ships were fitted for but not with a close-in weapons system, two quad-canister Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers, and a second Mark 41 launcher. After the ships were completed, both navies fitted Mark 32 three-tube torpedo launchers to their frigates. These were taken from older ships where possible; for example, &quot;Te Kaha&quot;″s launchers came from . The launchers were configured to fire the Mark 46 Mod 5 torpedo, an active/passive homing torpedo with a range of at , and a warhead.

===Sensors and systems===
The radar suite includes a Raytheon SPS-49(V)8 ANZ radar for aerial search and long-range surveillance, a Saab 9LV 453 Target Indication Radar for air and surface search, an Atlas Elektronik 9600 ARPA navigational radar, and a second Saab 9LV 453 unit for fire control. All ships were initially fitted with a ThomsonSintra Spherion B hull-mounted bow sonar, for active search and attack operations. From &quot;Warramunga&quot; onwards, ships were launched with a Petrel Mine and Obstacle Avoidance Sonar system. this was later retrofitted to &quot;Anzac&quot;. All ships were fitted for but not with a towed-array sonar, with the RAN and RNZN following separate acquisition programs for these. The frigates were also fitted for but not with SATCOM and a Helo datalink.

Countermeasures and electronic warfare equipment fitted at launch included Mark 36 SRBOC launchers, an SLQ-25A towed torpedo decoy, four four-cell Nulka decoy launchers, Racal Thorn modified Sceptre-A electronic support measures (ESM) equipment, and a Telefunken PST-1720 Telegon 10 radar intercept unit. The &quot;Anzac&quot;s were fitted for but not with offboard active ECM systems. The Sceptre-A equipment was unable to meet the required performance specifications, and Thales UK (which previously acquired Racal Thorn) was contracted in 2001 to replace the units with the Centaur ESM.

A Cossor AIMS Mark XII identification-friend-or-foe system is also installed.

The core of the &quot;Anzac&quot;s&#x27; combat system was built around CelsiusTech&#x27;s (now Saab) 9LV 453 Mark 3 distributed command and fire-control system.

==Construction==
On 14 August 1989, AMECON was awarded the tender to build the Blohm + Voss designed frigate. The frigates were to be constructed at the AMECON shipyard in Williamstown, Victoria (formerly Williamstown Naval Dockyard), but the modular design of the frigate allowed sections of the ships to be constructed throughout Australia and New Zealand, with final assembly in Williamstown. Each vessel was made up of six hull modules and six superstructure modules. All of lead ship &quot;Anzac&quot;s modules were assembled at Williamstown, but for later ships, the superstructure modules were fabricated in Whangārei, and hull modules were built at both Williamstown and Newcastle, New South Wales. Unlike previous shipbuilding contracts, AMECON was contractually obliged to meet only the navy&#x27;s set commissioning dates for the ships; all other construction deadlines were to be determined at the shipbuilder&#x27;s discretion.

The second and fourth ships to be built were allocated to the New Zealanders. The third and fifth ships to be produced were earmarked for the RNZN in the event that approval to order two more frigates was given, with two more ships for the RAN to be added at the end of the production run. Project offsets meant that construction costs for the New Zealand ships were about 20% less than the Australian vessels.

Steel cutting for the first ship, , commenced on 27 March 1992. Work on the first New Zealand ship, , began in February 1993. &quot;Anzac&quot; commissioned into the RAN in May 1996, and &quot;Te Kaha&quot; into the RNZN in July 1997. In early 2002, the first four ships found to have microscopic cracks in the bilge keel and hull plating. The ships&#x27; hulls were repaired and reinforced. Construction of the final vessel, , began in July 2003, with the vessel commissioning into the RAN in August 2006.

==Modifications and improvements==
The &quot;Anzac&quot;-class ships were designed with a minimum standard of offensive and defensive weapons, with other equipment fitted &quot;for but not with&quot;. The RAN and RNZN began to plan for upgrades to their frigates before all of the ships entered service; these upgrades were planned and executed on a national basis.

===Australian modifications===
The RAN commenced plans to improve their frigates&#x27; combat capability in 1996, with the Warfighting Improvement Program (WIP). Upgrades proposed under the WIP included installation of a phased-array radar, a second Mark 41 vertical launch system. The WIP was scrapped near the end of 1999, and plans for a less ambitious anti-ship missile defence (ASMD) upgrade were made. In 2004, Tenix, Saab, and the Department of Defence formed a Private Public Partnership to upgrade the anti-ship missile defence (ASMD) capability of the &quot;Anzac&quot; class, through the installation of CEA Technologies&#x27; CEAFAR and CEAMOUNT active phased array radars, a Vampir NG Infrared Search and Track system, and Sharpeye Navigational Radar Systems. On 18 January 2010, &quot;Perth&quot; docked at the Australian Marine Complex in Henderson, Western Australia for the ASMD upgrade. Both of the frigate&#x27;s masts were replaced, and the operations room layout was improved. Additional ballast was required to maintain stability, and the combined weight increase brought the ship&#x27;s full load displacement to 3,810 tons. After completion in October 2010, &quot;Perth&quot; was used to test the modifications, with trials completed in July 2011. Approval to upgrade the other seven RAN &quot;Anzac&quot;s was granted in November 2011, with work on the A$650 million refits to begin in 2012. As of March 2017, all eight ships of the RAN had completed the upgrade.

From &quot;Warramunga&quot; onwards, the frigates were launched with the ability to carry and fire the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) as a replacement for the Sea Sparrow missile; these were quad-packed into the Mark 41 launcher for a payload of 32 missiles. &quot;Warramunga&quot; was the first ship in the world fitted with the ESSM, and the first test firing was conducted aboard on 21 January 2003. The modifications entered operational service aboard three ships in June 2004. A CEA Technologies solid-state continuous wave illuminator was also fitted as part of the ESSM system.

From 2005 onwards, the RAN began fitting the &quot;Anzac&quot;s and the &quot;Adelaide&quot;s with Harpoon Block II missiles in two quad-tube canister launchers. The Australian &quot;Anzac&quot;s were fitted for but not with the launchers, but the originally planned location on 02 deck was found to be unsuitable, and the launchers were relocated to 01 deck, in front of the bridge. Around the same time, the RAN began to fit all frigates deploying to the Persian Gulf with two M2HB .50 calibre machine guns in Mini Typhoon mounts, installed on the aft corners of the hangar roof. Two TopLite EO directors are used with the guns.

The Mark 32 torpedo tubes aboard the Australian frigates were originally fitted with American Mark 46 anti-submarine torpedoes, but these were replaced with the French-Italian MU90 Impact torpedo prior to 2008. &quot;Toowoomba&quot; was the first Australian ship to fire an MU90 torpedo, during a test firing in June 2008, and &quot;Stuart&quot; performed the first &#x27;warshot&#x27; firing of an armed MU90.

The RAN commenced tendering for a helicopter design to replace the Seahawks aboard the Australian &quot;Anzac&quot;s in 1996, with a contract for 11 Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprite helicopters signed in 1997. In addition to the &quot;Anzac&quot;s, the acquired helicopter also had to be operable from the class of offshore patrol vessels the RAN was planning to build with the Royal Malaysian Navy (Malaysia later withdrew from the plan, and the RAN acquired the smaller s, which were not helicopter-equipped), with a second contract to be signed for these at a later date. In order to get the best capability for the cheapest price, the Australian Department of Defence opted to have Kaman acquire 40-year-old SH-2F Seasprite airframes decommissioned by the United States Navy, and fit modern flight systems to the reconditioned airframes. This approach led to major delays, and the helicopters were found to be inoperable in low-visibility conditions. By 2006, ten of the helicopters had been delivered, but none were permitted to fly. The Super Seasprite acquisition was cancelled outright in March 2008. Following the acquisition of the Romeo Seahawk helicopter variant, modifications to the &quot;Anzac&quot;s began to embark the helicopter.

As part of the ANZAC Mid-life Capability Assurance Programme (AMCAP) upgrade under SEA 1448, Phase 4B, the SPS-49(V)8 was replaced with CEAFAR2-L L band phased array radar, along with replacements of the Cossar Mk XII IFF, Exelis ES-3701 ESM and upgrades to the LESCUT, AN/SLR-25C torpedo self-defence system, and the Nulka active missile decoy capability.

In 2022, the government announced that the &quot;Anzac&quot;-class would be armed with the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) to replace the Harpoon missile which would more than double the strike range. In June 2024, the Chief of Navy Vice Admiral Mark Hammond said that some of the &quot;Anzac&quot;-class had been armed with the NSM.

===New Zealand modifications===
As soon as the New Zealand &quot;Anzac&quot;s entered service, a Phalanx CIWS weapons system, recycled from decommissioning various &quot;Leander&quot; frigates, was fitted to each new frigate in addition to the Mark 32 torpedo tube sets.
In 1997, the RNZN began steps to acquire five Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprite helicopters for the two frigates. Unlike the Australians, the New Zealand contract specified new-build helicopters. Kaman Aerospace loaned four SH-2F Seasprites to the RNZN while the new helicopters were constructed: the SH-2Fs operated from February 1998 to August 2001, when the first two SH-2Gs were accepted into service.

In 2006, the RNZN fitted two Mini Typhoons for each of its &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigates.

In 2007, &quot;Te Kaha&quot; began undergoing a series of major upgrades as part of the four-stage Platform Systems Upgrade (PSU), planning for which started in 2004. The four areas of modification under the PSU were improved stability and compartment configuration changes, overhaul of the propulsion system, installation of a new Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS), and upgrades to onboard environmental control. The stability upgrades were to accommodate predicted increases in displacement as updated equipment was installed on the ships. As part of the modification, the ships&#x27; quarterdecks were partially enclosed, creating space for a gymnasium and improved laundry facilities. Propulsion changes are primarily focused on replacing the TB83 diesel engines with the TB93, providing an additional and higher speeds during diesel-only sailing. The IPMS replacement is prompted by the perceived obsolescence of the current system by 2013; as of 2009, tendering for the new system was underway. The environmental control upgrade is intended to improve personnel comfort during deployments to South East Asia, the Middle East, or similar climates, and will use more environmentally friendly products. Each stage of the upgrade is organised to occur simultaneously with ship maintenance dockings, with the first two upgrades being installed during each ship&#x27;s major maintenance docking in 2009 and 2010 respectively, then the other two upgrades during the next docking in the 2011–2012 period.

A series of austere upgrades were approved on 14 April 2014, at an original contract cost of NZ 446m under the ANZAC Frigate Systems Upgrade (FSU) programme. These include the replacement of the existing combat management system, with a system modelled on that of the RCN &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigates awarded to Lockheed Martin, The British Sea Ceptor anti-air missile replaced the Sea Sparrow on 27 May 2014. Other changes included the Norwegian Penguin Mk 2 Mod 7 for the Seasprite helicopters and the fitting of a Sea Sentor Surface Ship Torpedo Defence, or SSTD system, as well as MASS (Multi Ammunition Softkill System). A new inertial navigation positioning system (Northrop Grumman) and navigation radar and SharpEye™ surveillance radars with an Agile Tracker has been fitted. The main radar will be the Thales SMART-S Mk2 3D radar. Other sensors and upgrades include Link 16, laser warning, and IFF. The Lockheed Martin Combat Management System 330 is also installed on the RNZN frigates, as it increases the eyes on each screen, covering lesser sensors and crew.

==Operational history==

In 1999, &quot;Te Kaha&quot; pursued Patagonian Toothfish poachers in the Ross Dependency, participated in the INTERFET multinational deployment to East Timor, and operated as part of the Multinational Interception Force in the Persian Gulf in 1999. The New Zealand frigates served periods as guardships at the Solomon Islands capital of Honiara between 2000 and 2001. In 2002, &quot;Te Kaha&quot; returned to the Persian Gulf, this time as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, after a four-month flag-showing deployment in Asian waters. The frigate was replaced in the Gulf by &quot;Te Mana&quot; in early 2003.

In March 2003, &quot;Anzac&quot; provided fire support for Royal Marines during the Battle of Al Faw during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.

A 2002 review of the RNZN&#x27;s abilities found that the navy was not meeting its patrol capability requirements; one of the contributing factors was that the New Zealand &quot;Anzac&quot;s were both too few and overcapable for EEZ patrols, and deploying them in this manner prevented them from more effective use elsewhere. Remedying this was one of the aims of Project Protector, a multi-ship acquisition project which saw three new classes of ship enter RNZN service.
From 2018, the Anzac-class frigates were undergoing their Midlife Capability Assurance Program (AMCAP) upgrade at the Australian Marine Complex, Henderson, Western Australia, a process scheduled to be completed by 2023. &quot;Arunta&quot; was the first ship to undergo the upgrade, followed by &quot;Anzac&quot; and &quot;Warramunga&quot;.

==Planned replacement==

The RAN plans to begin removing their &quot;Anzac&quot;s from service from 2024 onwards. To replace them, the of new frigates will be built under the SEA 5000 acquisition project. The frigates are predicted to have a displacement of up to , and although they will be primarily oriented towards anti-submarine warfare, they are expected to be capable of also operating against air, sea-surface, and land targets. Originally eight vessels were planned, but by August 2015, the number of planned ships had increased to nine, with an estimated cost of $20 billion. Construction is predicted to commence in 2020. The Abbott government promised that the two-decade construction project will be headquartered in South Australia, with shipbuilding divided between ASC Pty Ltd in South Australia and BAE Systems&#x27; Williamstown Dockyard in Victoria. On 18 April 2016, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (Abbott&#x27;s successor) confirmed that BAE Systems&#x27; Type 26 frigate, Fincantieri&#x27;s FREMM frigate and a re-designed F-100-class frigate designed by Navantia had been shortlisted to replace the ANZAC-class in Australia. The Prime Minister confirmed that any frigate will be built in Adelaide and incorporate an Australian CEA phased array radar The program is estimated to be worth $35 billion. In June 2018 it was confirmed that BAE Systems&#x27;s Type 26 had won the SEA5000 competition, with the in-service date for the new vessels being set for 2027.

The New Zealand &quot;Defence Capability Plan 2019&quot; states that the RNZN&#x27;s &quot;Anzac&quot;s will be replaced in the mid-2030s by &quot;modern surface combatants relevant to New Zealand&#x27;s prevailing strategic environment&quot;.

In February 2024 it was announced that HMAS &quot;Anzac&quot; was due to decommission in 2024, the first of her class, to free up funding for a future enlargement of the RAN. Her sister ship, &quot;Arunta&quot;, is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2026 while the remainder of the class would receive no more major upgrades.

<text>Kibæk is a town in Herning Municipality in Denmark with a population of 2,636 (1 January 2024). It was founded because of the railroad. This small provincial town consists of two streets with shops, and it is surrounded by moors, forests and streams. Nearest major town is Herning. Kibæk was the administrative center in Aaskov Municipality between 1970 and 2006.

==Etymology==
The oldest known source for the name Kibæk is from 1466, where the form &quot;Kybeck&quot; appears. Later evidence includes forms such as &quot;Kibeck&quot; (1638) and &quot;Kibek&quot; (1797). The meaning of the first part is disputed, but it is possibly an Old Danish noun &quot;kwī&quot;, which means &#x27;cattle fold&#x27;. However, it could also represent a well-known, old coincidence between words of &quot;twi&quot;- and &quot;kwi&quot;-, which refer to something twofold. The second part of the name (&quot;bæk&quot;) means stream. The name may thus mean either &quot;the stream by the cattle fold&quot; or &quot;the two-part stream&quot;.

==History==
The stream, which runs through Kibæk, created the basis for a watermill established sometime in the early 1400s, which until the end of the 19th century was the most important building in the area. With the construction of the railway between Herning and Skjern in 1881, Kibæk became home to a station, which created the basis for a large population growth in the following decades. Thus, at the 1901 census, 248 inhabitants were registered, and the town now had three merchants, a manufactory, an innkeeper, a lumber merchant, a physician, and a number of artisans. However, Kibæk also still had a number of farmers and homesteaders. There were also mission houses from 1889 and assembly houses from 1894. In the 1910s, the town also got a school, power station and pharmacy.

Kibæk continued its growth in the following decades. There were 479 inhabitants in 1925, 720 in 1955 and 1,279 in 1970. This development meant that Kibæk, which until the end of the 19th century had only been a secondary settlement in , accommodated more than half of the parish&#x27;s population. Kibæk also became the home of Assing Sogn&#x27;s municipal office in 1958. The town received a nursing home in 1929, a library in 1937, a central school in 1958 and a retirement home in 1963. In addition, there were recreational facilities and sports fields. Between the 1920s and 1960s, the business community expanded with i.a. cooperative dairy, cement goods factory and several knitwear and furniture factories.

== Notable people ==
* David Huda (born ca. 1898 in Safed, Palestine - 1982 in Denmark), author, school teacher, member of the Danish resistance during WW II, maternal grandfather of Peter H. Fogtdal.
* Kristian Bach Bak (born 1982 in Kibæk) a retired Danish professional footballer, 332 club caps

<text>Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (English translation: General Swedish Electrical Limited Company; Swedish abbreviation: ASEA) was a Swedish industrial company.

==History==

ASEA was founded in 1883 by Ludvig Fredholm in Västerås as a manufacturer of electrical light and generators. After merging with Wenström&#x27;s &amp; Granström&#x27;s Electrical Power Company (&quot;Wenströms &amp; Granströms Elektriska Kraftbolag&quot;) the name was changed to &quot;Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget&quot;, literally the &quot;General Swedish Electrical Limited Company&quot;, or &quot;ASEA&quot; for short.

In 1987, it announced a merger with the Swiss company Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie (BBC) to form ABB. The merge took effect on 1 January 1988. After this merger, ABB acquired several companies, including the power transmission and distribution operations of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the Combustion Engineering Group.

*1889 – the partner Jonas Wenström creates 3-phased generators, motors and transformers.
*1933 – The company removes the swastika from its logo, due to the symbol&#x27;s association with Nazi Germany.
*1953 – ASEA creates the first industrial diamonds.
*1954 – HVDC Gotland project, first static high-voltage DC system
*1960s – ASEA builds nine of 12 nuclear plants in Sweden.
*1968 – ASEA&#x27;s elevator business gets acquired by Kone
*1974 – Industrial robots are introduced by ASEA
*1987 – Acquires Finnish Oy Strömberg Ab
*1988 – Merges with Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie, Asea Cylinda laundry appliances branch bought by Finnish furniture maker Asko, renamed Asko ASEA.

<text>Whoops Apocalypse is a six-part 1982 television sitcom by Andrew Marshall and David Renwick, made by London Weekend Television for ITV. Marshall and Renwick later reworked the concept as a 1986 film of the same name from ITC Entertainment, with almost completely different characters and plot, although one or two of the original actors returned in different roles.

The British budget label Channel 5 Video released a compilation VHS cassette of all six episodes edited together into one 137-minute chunk in 1987.

The American video distributor EDDE Entertainment released a compilation VHS cassette of all six episodes edited together into one 121-minute chunk in 1991.

In 2010, Network released both the complete, unedited series and the movie on a 2-DVD set (Region 2) entitled &quot;Whoops Apocalypse: The Complete Apocalypse&quot;. (Rights issues were simplified by the fact that both LWT and ITC Entertainment productions were by this time owned by Granada Television).

In March 2022 the series was made available for streaming on BritBox.

==Series==
The series details the weeks leading up to the Apocalypse. It features a chaotic and increasingly unstable global political situation in which nuclear alerts are accidentally triggered by malfunctioning Space Invaders machines. The naïve and highly unpopular Republican U.S. President Johnny Cyclops (an obvious Ronald Reagan parody, played by Barry Morse) is advised by an insane right-wing fundamentalist security advisor, called The Deacon, who claims to have a direct hotline to God. (The Deacon was so named because of the previous role of the actor who played him (John Barron) as a Cathedral Dean in the sitcom &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot;; the writers claimed not to know at the time that Alexander Haig, Reagan&#x27;s first Secretary of State, was known as The Vicar in the White House.)

In the Eastern Hemisphere, things are similarly unstable. Soviet Premier Dubienkin (Richard Griffiths) is in fact a series of clones, which keep dying and being replaced. Meanwhile, the deposed Shah of Iran, Shah Massiq Rassim (Bruce Montague), led by his advisor Abdab (David Kelly) who is always blindfolded to avoid looking upon the Shah&#x27;s magnificence, is shunted around the world in search of a refuge (spending most of the series in a cross channel ferry&#x27;s toilet).

The main danger is the Deacon&#x27;s development of a new super-powerful American nuclear weapon. This is originally called the &quot;Johnny Cyclops Bomb&quot;; later, when the President vetoes the name, it is renamed the &quot;Quark Bomb (Formerly Known As The Johnny Cyclops Bomb After The President of the Same Name)&quot;. The Deacon arranges for Lacrobat (John Cleese), a disguised international arms smuggler nicknamed The Devil (a parody of Carlos the Jackal), to steal a Quark Bomb and take it to Iran, to help the Shah in his counterrevolution. The Soviets get word of this (via Rassim&#x27;s parrot) and decide to invade, gaining control over the world&#x27;s oil supply.

The Soviets have a new ally in British Prime Minister Kevin Pork (Peter Jones), a parody of left-wing Labour politicians Michael Foot and Peter Shore. Pork, who has gone insane and believes himself to be Superman, heads an especially left-wing government (a parody of Foot&#x27;s Labour Party). The British Foreign Secretary is blackmailed by the Soviets to join the Warsaw Pact. This situation so unnerves the foreign secretary (Geoffrey Palmer, in a role based on David Owen) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Richard Davies) that they also lose their sanity, don Green Lantern and Hawkman costumes, and are locked up in a padded cell at 10 Downing Street.

The Soviets are also holding two elderly American tourists named Jonathan and Martha Hopper captive. They are constantly tortured by Commissar Alex Solzhenitsyn (&quot;no relation&quot;, played by Alexei Sayle) in the belief they are secretly CIA spies. This turns out to be true, but the Hoppers are crushed by a helicopter in a bungled CIA rescue operation. This does not help Cyclops&#x27;s nosediving popularity rating, which is just below that of Charles Manson. The Deacon stages an assassination attempt in order to help Cyclops&#x27; flagging popularity (a reference to the Reagan assassination attempt the year before). It is damaged further when the speeding ambulance carrying Cyclops to the hospital accidentally runs over his highly popular main opponent, Democratic Senator Jimmy Hennessy (a parody of Senator Teddy Kennedy). By the end of the series we&#x27;re told Cyclops is now less popular than the Boston Strangler. (These developments are followed by a dramatic newsreader named Jay Garrick, and his topless female counterpart across the Atlantic.)

Eventually the Quark Bomb is accidentally detonated in Israel when Lacrobat&#x27;s attempt to prevent it being incinerated goes horribly wrong, destroying the country and killing most of the US army who were stationed there. Meanwhile, the Shah, who has temporarily been given sanctuary aboard a space shuttle, manages to crash it into the Moscow Kremlin. Believing it to be a bomb, the Russians launch their weapons at America. In the final scene Soviet missiles are on their way to obliterate the United States and President Cyclops has to decide whether to retaliate. The title sequence already showed the aftermath of the decision, Earth reduced to a nuclear wasteland. In a final twist, we discover that the woman we see in the title sequence selling buttons reading &quot;WEAR YOUR MUSHROOM WITH PRIDE&quot; is in fact the First Lady, who was hidden in a fallout shelter and is one of the few survivors of the war.

<text>Băile Felix () is a thermal spa resort near the commune of Sânmartin in Bihor County, Transylvania, Romania. Băile Felix is at a close distance to Oradea, a major city in western Romania.

==History==
Thermal springs were valued in the eighteenth century by the monk Félix Helcher of the Monastery of Klosterbruck (de) in Moravia, administrator of the Váradszentmárton (today: Sânmartin, Romania) monastery. Between 1711-1721 the first treatment facilities were organized under the name of Félixfürdő (in Romanian: Baia lui Felix). Félix Helcher died in 1737. In 1885 a new spring, with a temperature of 49 °C, was found.

The thermal springs were discovered around 1000, or around 1200, or according to other experts, only in 1700. The only fact agreed by all experts is the appearance of the first buildings in this resort: between the years 1711–1721.

In 1920, the commune became part of Romania, in 1940, it was given back to Hungary. After World War II, it became part of Romania again.

In 1948 Sanmartin monastery area was nationalized by the communist authorities. Several recreational bases, including the one belonged to Securitate, were built on the nationalized land. The Premonstatens Order claims it latter. On April 2, 2014, the HCCJ (Higher Court of Cassation and Justice) ordered the transfer of the filed case from Oradea Court to the Giurgiu District Court, where it is now. Other requests of the Premonstratens Order on retrocession the Băile Felix lands are in progress at HCCJ.

==Geography==
Băile Felix and 1 Mai are two thermal spa resorts located in a hilly area with birch and oak tree woods, 8 km south of the municipality of Oradea (seat of Bihor County) and 22 km south-east of Borş (border checkpoint to Hungary). The resort lost its passenger railway service in 2014.

==Climate==
Summers are not excessively hot and winters are mild, with moderate precipitation (650 mm annually).

==Fauna and flora==
In the thermal waters of the Peţa river and lake, having a constant temperature of 30-31 °C, live the snail &quot;Melanopsis parreyssi&quot; (tertiary relict) and the fish &quot;Scardinus racovitzae&quot; as well as a rare species of subtropical water lily - &quot;Nymphaea lotus thermalis&quot; - tertiary relict, a natural monument.

==Spa==
The resorts host many mineral springs with thermal (20-48 °C), sulphuric, calcic, sodic, rich in bicarbonate waters known since the beginning of the millennium. 
The soothing effect of the waters on articular and muscular pain and on various rheumatic neuralgias accounts for the fame of cures in the resort for the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases (rheumatic polyarthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, conditions after acute articular rheumatism), degenerative and articular rheumatic diseases, central and peripheral neurological disorders, gynecological diseases, post-traumatic conditions, endocrine disorders.

The facilities of the two resorts offer treatment of rheumatism and neurological and gynecological diseases. The modern medical base has at its disposal various facilities for procedures involving electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, aerosols, massage, paraffin packing and other water treatments.

<text>Svilengrad (; ; ) is a town in Haskovo Province, south-central Bulgaria, situated at the tripoint of Bulgaria, Turkey, and Greece. It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Svilengrad Municipality.

== Geography ==
Svilengrad is close to the road borders of Greece and Turkey (supposedly one of the largest road customs in Europe). Svilengrad is located ESE of Sofia and Plovdiv, South of Varna and Burgas, West of Edirne and North of the nearest Greek community Ormenio and Alexandroupolis in Greece. There is a higher level of employment than in surrounding villages. Most people work for customs and border related industries e.g. TIR servicing, hotels, border police, etc. The town centre has a pedestrianized high street mostly filled with cafes, bars, phone shops and hotels. The town has 3 DVD rental shops, two cinemas and a library. The Maritsa river flows through Svilengrad. The Evros regional unit of Greece is bordered to the south. The Rhodope mountains lie to the west and southwest. The area to the southwest is famous for its fruit trees and a moderate climate all year long.

==History==
During Ottoman times, the town&#x27;s name was Cisr-i Mustafapaşa, meaning &quot;Bridge of Mustapha Pasha&quot;. In 1529, the Old Bridge () over the Maritsa, one of the symbols of the town, was erected. The town was ceded to Bulgaria in 1912 after the First Balkan War.

The favorable natural conditions in the Svilengrad region and its strategic geographical location are the reason why it has been inhabited since ancient times. According to Anastas Razboynikov, the oldest traces of human life date back to the end of the Neolithic and Stone Age. During the Bronze and Iron Ages the lands around today&#x27;s Svilengrad were inhabited by the Thracian tribe Odrysians. Traces of settlements, tombs, sanctuaries, dolmens and others have remained from the time of the Thracians. In the old neighborhood of Kanaklia there was a place Mogilata, named after a large mound, in the vicinity of which were found the remains of chariots. Anastas Razboynikov&#x27;s observations were confirmed in 2003-2004 during the rescue excavations along the route of the Trakia Motorway on the hill above the Kanaklia neighborhood, where a pit sanctuary from the Iron Age was discovered.
=== Middle Ages ===
The region was a bustling crossroads and an arena of constant wars even after the establishment of the Bulgarian state. Under Khan Krum (803-814), Bulgarian troops often ravaged areas of the Byzantine Empire, according to the triumphal columns of Pliska for the conquest of the fortresses of Scutarion (now Shtit), Provat and others.

This region is associated with one of the greatest battles in medieval Bulgarian history. In 1205, Kaloyan&#x27;s troops inflicted the first major defeat on the hitherto invincible army of the Latin Em[ire, led by Emperor Baldwin. It is believed that the site of the battle was north of Adrianople, at the foot of Bukelon Fortress.

In 1371, on the opposite right bank of the Maritsa River near Chermen, the Battle of Chernomen took place between the troops of Sultan Murad I and the Christian forces under the command of King Vukašin and Despot Uglješa, which ended in catastrophic defeat for the Christians.

In 1433, the Burgundian pilgrim Bertrand de la Broquierre passed through here, then the first armor bearer of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, who traveled to the Holy Sepulcher and back to explore the possibilities of a new crusade. Brokier describes how on the first day of the journey from Adrianople up the Maritsa River he and his comrades, numbering 10 horses, were transported in such a raft on March 12, 1433. Among the passengers was the Milan ambassador to the Turkish sultan in Adrianople.
In 1529 a bridge was built on the Maritsa River, representing a significant facility for its time. The bridge now connects the two parts of Svilengrad. A new settlement appeared around the bridge - Jesir Mustafa Pasha, which became a town in the second half of the 16th century.

=== Revival ===
During the Ottoman rule, the population of the city selflessly fought to preserve their national identity. In 1847 a school for secular sciences was built. The patriarch of Bulgarian literature Ivan Vazov taught in this school from 1872 to 1873. In 1870 the Zvezda Chitalishte opened its doors. Another Revival teacher - Peter Stanchov, became the godfather of the city. The settlement began to be called so only in 1913.

On the way to Constantinople, famous Bulgarian revolutionaries, educators and revivalists - Georgi Rakovski, Petko Slaveykov, Hristo G. Danov, Dragan Tsankov, Konstantin Velichkov - passed and stayed here. Vasil Levski also came to the city. Here, in 1871, he founded a secret revolutionary committee. On January 8, 1878, Russian troops, commanded by General Alexander Strukov, entered Svilengrad. A year later, after the Berlin Treaty, the city was left under Turkish rule.
34 years later, during the First Balkan War, Svilengrad was occupied by Bulgarian forces on 5 October 1912, after the Bulgarian army captured Sheinovets peak in the Rhodopes. During the Balkan Wars, the first military airport near Svilengrad was equipped.

During the Second Balkan War, in the summer of 1913, the city was ruined and burned house by house when the Ottomans entered the war against Bulgaria. The city was finally annexed to Bulgaria at the end of September 1913, after the Treaty of Constantinople. According to the defined new border, Svilengrad remains in Bulgaria. Its returned inhabitants revived the city from the ashes and rebuilt it.

During World War II, in 1940, one of the escape routes of Poles from occupied Poland led through Svilengrad to territory of Polish-allied France, where the Polish Army was reconstituted to continue the fight against Germany (see also &quot;Bulgaria–Poland relations&quot;).

<text>The Sacred City of Caral-Supe, or simply Caral, is an archaeological site in Peru where the remains of the main city of the Caral civilization are found. It is located in the Supe valley of Peru, near the current town of Caral, 182 kilometers north of Lima, 23 km from the coast and 350 metres above sea level. It is attributed an antiquity of 5,000 years and it is considered the oldest city in the Americas and one of the oldest in the world. No other site has been found with such a diversity of monumental buildings or different ceremonial and administrative functions in the Americas as early as Caral. It has been declared a Humanity Cultural Heritage site by UNESCO.

The Caral culture developed between 3000 and 1800 B.C (Late Archaic and Lower Formative periods). In America, it is the oldest of the pre-Hispanic civilizations, developing 1,500 years earlier than the Olmec civilization, the first Mesoamerican complex society.

Closely related to the city of Caral was an early fishing city, Áspero or El Áspero, located on the coast near the mouth of the Supe River. There, remains of human sacrifices (two children and a newborn) have been found. In 2016, the remains were found of a woman, who presumably belonged to the local elite of 4,500 years ago.

== History ==
Caral was inhabited between approximately 26th century BC and 20th century BC, and the site includes an area of more than . Caral has been described by its excavators as the oldest urban center in the Americas. This claim has been challenged by the discovery of other ancient sites nearby, such as Bandurria, Peru. Accommodating more than 3,000 inhabitants, Caral is the best studied and one of the largest sites known of the Norte Chico civilization.

The city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009. In early 2021, tensions arose between squatters claiming land rights and archaeologists researching the site, as housing construction encroached on the site.
== Archaeological findings ==
Paul Kosok discovered Caral in 1948. The site received little attention at the time because it appeared to lack many of the typical artifacts that were sought at archaeological sites throughout the Andes.

In 1975, the Peruvian architect Carlos Williams made a detailed record of most of the archaeological sites of the valley of Supe, among which he recorded Caral. Based on what he observed in the region, he made some observations about the development of architecture in the Andes.

Ruth Shady further explored this 4,000- to 4,600-year-old city in the Peruvian desert, with its elaborate complex of temples, an amphitheater, and ordinary houses. The urban complex is spread out over and contains plazas and residential buildings. Caral was a thriving metropolis at roughly the same time as the great pyramids were being built in Egypt, which is considered one of the earliest civilizations in the world.

Caral is the largest recorded site in the Andean region, with dates older than 2000 BC. It appears to be the model for the urban design adopted by Andean civilizations that rose and fell over the span of four millennia. Scholars believe that research conducted in Caral may answer questions about the origins of the Andean civilizations and the development of its first cities.

Among the artifacts found at Caral is a knotted textile piece that the excavators have labelled a &quot;quipu&quot;. They write that the artifact is evidence that the &quot;quipu&quot; record keeping system, a method involving knots tied in textiles that was brought to its highest development by the Inca Empire, was older than any archaeologist previously had determined. Evidence has emerged that the &quot;quipu&quot; also may have recorded logographic information in the same way writing does. Gary Urton has suggested that the &quot;quipus&quot; used a binary code that could record phonological or logographic data.

===Main temple===
The main temple complex () is long, wide and high. The date of its construction is unknown.

===Peaceful society===
Shady&#x27;s findings suggest it was a society built on commerce and pleasure. No indications of warfare, such as battlements, weapons, or mutilated bodies, have been found at Caral. This contrasts with the older site of Sechin Bajo, where depictions of weapons are found. In one of the Caral temples, researchers found 32 flutes made of condor and pelican bones and 37 cornetts of deer and llama bones. One find revealed the remains of a baby, wrapped and buried with a necklace made of stone beads.

===Scope of site===
Caral was flanked by 19 other temple complexes scattered across the area of the Supe Valley.

The date of 2627 BC for Caral is based on the carbon dating of reed and woven carrying bags that were found on site. These bags were used to carry the stones for the construction of the temples. The material is an excellent candidate for high precision dating. The site may date even earlier, however, as samples from the oldest parts of the excavation have yet to be dated.

Caral had a population of approximately 3,000 people. However, 19 other sites in the area (posted at Caral), allow for a possible total population of 20,000 people sharing the same culture in the Supe Valley. All of these sites share similarities with Caral, including small platforms or stone circles. Shady believes that Caral was the focus of this civilization. It is believed to be part of an even more vast cultural complex, trading with the coastal communities and the regions farther inland. She suggests that a depiction of monkeys may be evidence of trade with communities along the Amazon.

===Geoglyph===
In 2000, Marco Machacuay (the chief of excavations at the time) and his colleague, Rocío Aramburú, discovered a large shape etched on the ground among circular stone lines near Caral. This image, known as a geoglyph, is located on the desert floor just west of the main site at Caral. The lines form the design of a human face with long, streaming hair and a gaping mouth.

This geoglyph is similar to bleeding figures with a similar gaping mouths found etched onto the stone walls at a site called Cerro Sechín, in the Casma Valley to the north. What this figure represents is unclear. It is believed to have been constructed around the same time as Caral and to have been associated with a nearby ceremonial site known as &quot;Chupacigarro&quot;.

===Musical instruments===
Another significant find at the site was a collection of musical instruments, including 37 cornetts made of deer and llama bones and 33 flutes of unusual construction. The flutes were radiocarbon dated to 2170±90 BC.

== City layout ==
The city of Caral was split into two sections, an &quot;Upper Half&quot; and a &quot;Lower Half&quot;. These halves were divided naturally by the Supe River Valley. In the Upper Half there are six monumental complexes, each of which includes a pyramid, open plaza, and assemblage of residential buildings. In the Lower Half there are residential buildings, small pyramids, and one monumental complex called the &quot;Temple of the Amphitheater&quot;.

The Upper Half complexes were all constructed around a pyramid. These are the &quot;Great Temple/Great Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Central Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Quarry Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Lesser Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Pyramid of the Gallery&quot;, and &quot;Pyramid of the Huanca&quot;. The associated residential structures around each of these pyramids contain evidence of elite living, including food remnants that would have been exclusive to elite lifestyles, such as sea lion bones. In the Upper Half of Caral, many of the residents were wealthy elites, whose lives likely were associated with religious and social activities that would have taken place in the temples.

By comparison, the residential buildings in the Lower Half have less evidence of elite populations. Instead of the large structures, exclusively elite residential complexes of the Upper Half, these residences are smaller and single rooms are used for more than one purpose. The diets of the people living in the Lower Half of Caral consisted mostly of agricultural plants and some fish. These diets were less rich than those of the elites living in the Upper Half.

The current explanation for the divided city is that the city was intentionally planned in this way, with the monumental architecture and complexes of the Upper Half designed both to house elites and to physically indicate their political power. Conversely, the Lower Half was designed to house laborers, with the river serving as the division between these groups. This sort of intentional city planning is evidence of structuralized inequality at Caral, which perpetuated existing social stratification.

<text>Telekom Romania Mobile Communications S.A. is a mobile network company in Romania, wholly owned by OTE, which in turn is controlled by Deutsche Telekom, operating under Telekom brand. Telekom Romania Mobile had 3.5 million subscribers with 15% market share as of July 2021.

The network operated together with Telekom Romania Communications (which traces its ancestry back to , later renamed Romtelecom) from 2014 until 2021 under the same brand Telekom. Both companies were majority owned by OTE, which in turn is controlled by Deutsche Telekom.

On November 6, 2020, OTE agreed to sell the 54% stake in the fixed network company Telekom Romania Communications to Orange Romania for €295 million. In order for the transaction to be approved by the authorities, OTE has committed to buy the remaining 30% of shares in Telekom Romania Mobile, which operates the mobile network. The transaction was completed in July 2021.

OTE did not succeed in selling the mobile phone company after the transaction with Digi failed due to the fact that it only wanted to buy cell sites and mobile frequencies, thus making Deutsche Telekom to rebrand it as Telekom Mobile and keep the company in OTE&#x27;s portfolio until it finds a buyer.

In November 2023, OTE would eventually sell Telekom Romania Mobile to Clever Group, the owner of Prima TV.

== History ==
=== Cosmorom ===
The company was launched as Cosmorom in 1999 by Romtelecom as its mobile telephony brand and entered service in April 2000. In the first years, the company failed to gain market share. Having around 1% market share and financial losses, there were talks about the selling of the company, but the decision was delayed several times due to disagreement between OTE, the majority owner of Romtelecom and the Romanian Government. In January 2004 Romtelecom decided to sell a majority stake in the company. Buying offers were made by Mobilkom (now A1 Telekom Austria), which was seen as a favorite, and the Hungarian company Matev of Deutsche Telekom. But in the end, the Greek company OTE, which owned 54% of Cosmorom&#x27;s parent company, decided to buy 70% of the company, leaving Romtelecom with the remaining 30%.

=== Cosmote Romania===
In July 2005 OTE&#x27;s mobile division Cosmote relaunched the mobile operator separate from the fixed services company Romtelecom, with a popular offer for prepaid services. In December 2005 had approximately 50,000 subscribers. The process of relaunching, started with the rebranding as Cosmote on December 6, 2005. On March 2, 2006, it started a wide advertising campaign on the prepaid market, offering a limited number of SIM cards with 2000 free minutes within the network per month for a low price (3 euro). The network could no longer cope with the large number of users and network failures often occurred. So on March 20, the company announced that the offer will work until March 31 only for people who have activated the service until March 22.

On June 30, 2009 Cosmote acquired Zapp Mobile, a CDMA mobile operator with 374,000 subscribers, who also had a 3G license. Following Zapp acquisition, Cosmote launched 3G service. At the end of 2013, Cosmote Romania had 6.1 million customers, of which 25.9% were postpaid subscribers and the rest were users of prepaid services.

=== Telekom Romania===

On September 12, 2014, Romtelecom and Cosmote România unified mobile and fixed services under a single brand and changed their respective legal names to Telekom Romania Communications and Telekom Romania Mobile Communications. The company tried to attract postpaid customers, including with bundling mobile and fixed services, but the market share dropped. The company raised prices, but financial losses continued.

==Shareholders==
Telekom Romania Mobile Communications S.A. (mobile services):
* OTE - 99.9999994%
* Societatea Națională de Radiocomunicații S.A - 0.0000006%

<text>Murray Hone Ball (26 January 1939 – 12 March 2017) was a New Zealand cartoonist who became known for his &quot;Stanley the Palaeolithic Hero&quot; (the longest running cartoon in &quot;Punch&quot; magazine), &quot;Bruce the Barbarian&quot;, &quot;All the King&#x27;s Comrades&quot; (also in &quot;Punch&quot;) and the long-running &quot;Footrot Flats&quot; comic series. In the 2002 Queen&#x27;s Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, Ball was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as a cartoonist.

==Life and work==
Ball was born in Feilding in 1939; his father was All Black rugby player Nelson Ball. He grew up in New Zealand before spending some years in Australia and South Africa, where he attended Parktown Boys&#x27; High School and finished his education. He played for the Junior All Blacks in 1959 as a &quot;first five-eighth&quot; (number 10). As a young man he worked for the &quot;Dominion&quot; newspaper in Wellington and the &quot;Manawatu Times&quot; before becoming a freelance cartoonist and moving to Scotland, where he found work with publishers DC Thomson, of Dundee. 

He developed his character &quot;Stanley&quot; and had it published in the influential English humour-magazine &quot;Punch&quot;. &quot;Stanley the Palaeolithic Hero&quot; featured a caveman who wore glasses and struggled with the Neolithic environment. It became the longest-running strip in &quot;Punch&quot;&#x27;s history, and other English and non-English speaking countries syndicated it. Ball continued to contribute to &quot;Punch&quot; after returning with his family to New Zealand.

Ball&#x27;s early cartoons often had political overtones; his mid-70s UK strips included &quot;All the King&#x27;s Comrades&quot;, &quot;Stanley&quot; often expresses left-wing attitudes, and he described himself in the introduction to &quot;The Sisterhood&quot; (1993) as a socialist, and he was avidly anti-apartheid while in South Africa. Despite this, he has also been accused of racism, and often found himself at odds with contemporary leftists, especially on issues regarding gender identity, feminism, transgenderism, and abortion.

In 2002 Ball was awarded the New Zealand Order of Merit.

Tributes paid to him included these:


==&quot;Footrot Flats&quot;==

After 1975 Ball wrote several comics in New Zealand (for instance &#x27;Nature Calls&#x27;), but it was in 1976 that he first published the strip &quot;Footrot Flats&quot; in Wellington&#x27;s afternoon newspaper, &quot;The Evening Post&quot;. It rapidly led to the demise of his other strips including &quot;Stanley&quot;, which he was still writing for Punch.

The strip follows the adventures of a working sheep-dog called (if anything) &quot;Dog&quot; or &quot;The Dog&quot; or &quot;@*&amp;#!&quot;, his owner Wal Footrot and the other characters, human and animal, that they encounter or associate with. Ball expresses Dog&#x27;s thoughts in thought-bubbles, though he clearly remains &quot;just a dog&quot; (rather than the heavily anthropomorphised creatures sometimes found in other comics or animation). Dog also has alter-egos including &quot;The Grey Ghost&quot; and &quot;The Iron Paw&quot;.

Ball&#x27;s &quot;Footrot Flats&quot; has appeared in syndication in international newspapers, and in over 40 published books. &quot;Footrot Flats&quot; inspired a stage musical,
a theme-park
and New Zealand&#x27;s first feature-length animated film, &quot;Footrot Flats: The Dog&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1986). &quot;Footrot Flats&quot; characters include Wal, Dog, Cooch, Cheeky Hobson, Aunt Dolly, Horse, Pongo, Rangi, Charlie, Major, Jess and the Murphy family of Irish and Hunk and Spit.

&quot;Footrot Flats&quot; features several remarkable traits: its expansive created-universe, complete with ancillary characters, things and places; the fact that the characters slowly but perceptibly age and mature throughout the twenty-year run of the comic; and the gradual encroachment of political themes over the years (particularly environmentalism and gentle parodies of feminism).

Ball said he wanted his cartoons to have an impact. &quot;The heart of a cartoon is the idea, an artist can create a painting, hang it on the wall and be satisfied with what he has achieved even if no-one else sees it. In cartooning, you must get a human reaction to the idea. The task of the cartoonist is to translate his idea into a drawing that will have impact&quot;.

==Death==
Ball lived with his wife Pam on a rural property in Gisborne, New Zealand. In an interview on Radio New Zealand National on 27 January 2016, Pam said that Murray&#x27;s health had been poor for the last six years and that he was suffering from dementia. Longtime friend and collaborator Tom Scott said that on Sunday, 12 March 2017, he had been advised that Ball had died. He is survived by his wife and children.

==Bibliography==
In addition to his cartoon collections, Ball wrote and illustrated eight books:

* &quot;Fifteen Men on a Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;, a satirical look at New Zealand rugby.
* &quot;Migod! It&#x27;s Bruce the Barbarian,&quot; which pitted Bruce, a socialist warrior from Footrot Flats, New Zealand, against the wealthy and malevolent upper classes of the ancient Roman Empire.
* &quot;The People Makers&quot; (1970), a humorous account of Ball&#x27;s time as a teacher.
* &quot;Quentin Hankey: Traitor&quot; (1986), political satire revolving around a Clinton Hankey, nationalist and born antihero &quot;crusading for a brave new world&quot;
* &quot;The Sisterhood&quot; (1993), a controversial political work highly critical of contemporary feminism.
* &quot;The Flowering of Adam Budd&quot; (1998), a coming-of-age story.
* &quot;Tarzan, Gene Kelly And Me&quot; (2001), approximately, an autobiography.
* &quot;Fred the (Quite) Brave Mouse,&quot; a children&#x27;s book about a mouse in love.

Ball also wrote a large-format illustrated novel whose verse parodied the Australian bush-ballad as popularised by Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson. Titled &quot;The Ballad of Footrot Flats&quot;, it was published in 1996. Originally intended as a second film script, this work was the first new &quot;Footrot&quot; material which Ball had published since 1994. It was the last of the &quot;Footrot&quot; series.

==Interests==
Murray Ball and Charles M. Schulz each admired the other&#x27;s work. One &quot;Footrot Flats&quot; strip shows Dog laughing at a Snoopy cartoon. Schulz wrote the introduction to the only &quot;Footrot Flats&quot; published in the United States (it appeared as &quot;Footrot Flats&quot; there, but as &quot;Footrot Flats 4&quot; in Australasia.)

<doc id="897709" wikidata="Q360491" url="?curid=897709" title="Alan Pardew">
<text>Alan Scott Pardew (born 18 July 1961) is an English football manager and former professional footballer, who most recently managed Greek Super League club Aris Thessaloniki.

Pardew&#x27;s highest achievements in the sport include reaching the FA Cup Final three times: as a player with Crystal Palace in 1990 and as a manager with West Ham United in 2006 and in 2016 when his Crystal Palace side lost to Manchester United. He has also achieved promotion three times in his career, as a player with Palace and as a manager with Reading and West Ham. He managed Newcastle United from 2010 to 2014.

As manager of Newcastle, Pardew won both the Premier League Manager of the Season and the LMA Manager of the Year awards for the 2011–12 season after guiding the Magpies to European football for the first time since the club&#x27;s return to the Premier League. He later managed Crystal Palace, West Bromwich Albion and ADO Den Haag, as well as working as a Sky Sports pundit for the 2017–18 Premier League season.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Pardew was born in Wimbledon, London. He started his career as a part-time player in non-League football at Whyteleafe and Epsom &amp; Ewell, while working as a glazier. At one stage, he gave up football for six months while working in the Middle East, but he returned to football at Corinthian Casuals, before later having spells at Dulwich Hamlet and Yeovil Town. Pardew was also in the England semi-professional squad during this time.

===Crystal Palace===
Pardew moved to Second Division club Crystal Palace in 1987 for a fee of £7,500. In 1989, he helped Palace win promotion to the First Division after beating Blackburn Rovers in the play-offs. The following year, in 1990, he scored the winning goal as Palace beat Liverpool 4–3 after extra time in the FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park. 
He then played in both the final and the final replay as Palace lost to Manchester United.

Palace continued to impress in the First Division, and in 1990–91 secured their highest-ever league finish of third, with Pardew also featuring as Palace beat Everton to win the Full Members&#x27; Cup at Wembley Stadium.

===Later career===
Pardew moved to Charlton Athletic in November 1991, and was Charlton&#x27;s top scorer in the 1992–93 season with ten goals. In 1995, Pardew appeared four times on loan at Tottenham Hotspur in the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup. He played in the team who suffered the heaviest loss in Spurs&#x27; history, when they lost 8–0 away to German side 1. FC Köln. Spurs had fielded a team made up of reserves and loanees, including Pardew, for their final group game in Cologne.

After rejecting an opportunity to play in Hong Kong, Pardew then moved to Barnet, and became a player-coach under manager Terry Bullivant. When Bullivant moved to Reading in 1997, he took Pardew with him as reserve-team manager.

===International career===
At international level, Pardew was a member of the England semi-professional squad during his time playing in English non-League football for Dulwich Hamlet and Yeovil Town.

==Managerial career==
===Reading===
Pardew&#x27;s first experience as manager came in March 1998 when he was appointed as caretaker after the departure of Bullivant. His first match in charge was against Huddersfield Town on 21 March 1998, which Reading lost 0–2. After the appointment of Tommy Burns, he remained as reserve team manager until the end of the 1998–99 season, when Reading disbanded their reserve team. Nevertheless, he was promoted to manager of the club after a successful spell as caretaker in 1999. He turned the club around from relegation fighters to promotion candidates through players, such as Jamie Cureton, and his régime to increase the fitness of the squad.

Pardew&#x27;s Reading side lost 3–2 to Walsall in a Division Two play-off final at the end of the 2000–01 season, but this was redeemed the next season as the club achieved automatic promotion to Division One. Pardew&#x27;s first season in the higher division was impressive, as the club finished fourth. They lost in the play-offs again, this time to Wolverhampton Wanderers.

===West Ham United===
Early into the 2003–04 season, West Ham United asked Reading permission to appoint Pardew as their new manager. Although Reading refused permission, Pardew resigned from his position on 10 September 2003. Eventually, a compromise agreement was reached, allowing Pardew to become manager at West Ham.

Pardew&#x27;s first season at West Ham resulted in a play-off final defeat to his former club Crystal Palace. In the 2004–05 season, West Ham struggled to find promotion form, with Pardew coming under pressure from the club&#x27;s supporters. West Ham eventually succeeded in gaining promotion to the Premier League after defeating Preston North End in the play-off final. Pardew guided the Hammers to ninth place in the Premier League in the 2005–06 season, which culminated in an appearance in the final of the FA Cup. After drawing 3–3 with Liverpool at the end of extra time, West Ham lost on penalties, resulting in the second FA Cup final defeat of Pardew&#x27;s career.

In the 2006–07 season, Pardew was criticised after seeing West Ham through their worst run of defeats in over 70 years, which included an exit from the UEFA Cup to Palermo in the first round, and a League Cup defeat to Chesterfield. West Ham&#x27;s new owners stated their support for Pardew, but on 11 December 2006, following a 4–0 defeat away at Bolton Wanderers the previous weekend, Pardew was dismissed by the club.

===Charlton Athletic===
Pardew&#x27;s absence from management lasted less than two weeks, after which he was appointed manager of Charlton Athletic on 24 December 2006, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract. He took over with Charlton in 19th place in the Premier League, with just 12 points and a minus – 20 goal difference, the lowest in the league. Although Charlton&#x27;s form improved under Pardew, he was unable to keep Charlton up, resulting in the first relegation of his career, both as a player and manager.

To spearhead their return to the Premier League, Pardew signed Chris Iwelumo and Luke Varney in the 2007–08 season. But Charlton failed to mount a serious promotion challenge, and finished the season in eleventh place. This put Pardew under pressure entering the 2008–09 season, but Charlton started the season off well with victories over Reading and Swansea City. Charlton&#x27;s form, however, quickly deteriorated and they were near the foot of the table after eight games without a win. After a 5–2 home defeat to Sheffield United, hundreds of supporters remained for more than an hour to condemn their manager, chanting, &quot;We want Pardew out&quot; and &quot;We want our club back&quot; after Charlton had slipped into the Championship&#x27;s bottom three. On 22 November 2008, Pardew parted company with Charlton by mutual consent.

===Southampton===
Pardew was named the new manager of Southampton on 17 July 2009, after the new owner Markus Liebherr had taken over the club and dismissed Mark Wotte a day after completing the deal to save the Saints. Pardew&#x27;s first signing for the club was Dan Harding, who signed on a free transfer after being released by Ipswich Town. His first league match in charge was against Millwall on 8 August 2009, which ended in a 1–1 draw. He brought many new signings to the club, including League One strikers Rickie Lambert and Lee Barnard, the first of whom cost £1 million. Pardew led his side up the League One table, and, despite their ten-point deduction, their challenge for a playoff place was kept alive until there were just two league games remaining.

Pardew led Southampton to the 2010 League Trophy final at Wembley Stadium, where they won 4–1 against Carlisle United. The win gave the club their first trophy since 1976. Five months later, Pardew was dismissed by the club, amidst reports of low staff morale and conflicts between Pardew and club chairman Nicola Cortese.

===Newcastle United===
On 6 December 2010, Chris Hughton was dismissed as manager of Newcastle United. Three days later, the club confirmed Pardew as the club&#x27;s new manager on a five-and-a-half-year contract. Sky Sports reported that, of 40,000 fans taking part in a poll on who should become the next manager, Pardew only received the backing of 5.5% of voters.

Pardew stated: &quot;I&#x27;m not a Geordie of course, but I&#x27;m a football person with a love of the game and I can assure you I bring great drive, desire and commitment to the job. Chris Hughton did a great job last season, guiding the club back to the Premier League, and he continued that good work this season. It is my aim to build on that now and take this club forward.&quot; He acknowledged that he would face a battle to win over players and supporters, and that other managers had texted him to say &quot;you must be mad going there&quot;, but he declared, &quot;It&#x27;s one of the top five clubs in England. It&#x27;s a daunting prospect but something I couldn&#x27;t turn down.&quot;

In his first game in charge, Pardew led Newcastle to a 3–1 win over Liverpool at St James&#x27; Park on 11 December 2010, with goals from Kevin Nolan, Joey Barton and Andy Carroll. In the club&#x27;s first home match of 2011, he achieved a notable 5–0 victory over his former club West Ham. He brought in his own coaching staff in the form of John Carver as assistant manager, who had worked as assistant to Sir Bobby Robson six years earlier. Andy Woodman was also Pardew&#x27;s appointment as goalkeeping coach. Soon after, however, Pardew suffered one of the biggest upsets in the club&#x27;s history as Newcastle went down 3–1 to League Two side Stevenage in the third round of the FA Cup.

The following month, however, Pardew led the Magpies to a 4–4 draw with Arsenal in a match at St James&#x27; Park on 5 February 2011. Newcastle were 4–0 down at half-time, only to come back to level the match. This has been seen as one of the most remarkable comebacks in Premier League history. He secured Newcastle&#x27;s safety in the Premier League with a 2–1 win over Birmingham City on 7 May 2011, with the club in mid-table. This result was followed by a 2–2 draw at Chelsea and a 3–3 draw against West Bromwich Albion at St James&#x27; Park. In this match, however, they let a 3–0 goal lead slip, meaning they would finish outside the top ten in 12th place.

In the summer of 2011, Pardew brought many French-speaking players to the club, including Yohan Cabaye, Sylvain Marveaux and Demba Ba. At the start of the 2011–12 season, Pardew led Newcastle to their best start to a Premier League campaign in 17 years, with an unbeaten run of eleven matches in all competitions.

In January 2012, Pardew signed striker Papiss Cissé from Bundesliga club Freiburg. This was another pivotal signing in the resurgence of Newcastle, as he scored 13 goals in twelve games.

Two days prior to the final match of the season, Pardew won the Premier League Manager of the Season award, becoming the first Newcastle manager to achieve this. He was given the award after an impressive season with Newcastle, where he guided them to a European place for the following season. He also won the League Managers Association Manager of the Year award, which made him the first and only English manager to win the two individual awards in a single Premier League season. On 27 September 2012, Pardew signed an eight-year contract extension with the club.

During the 2013 January transfer window, Pardew signed a number of players from the French Ligue 1 – including internationals such as Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, Mathieu Debuchy and Moussa Sissoko – to help boost Newcastle&#x27;s chances. The new signings helped Pardew to guide Newcastle to their first European quarter-final in eight years, as they defeated Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala 1–0 on aggregate. On 14 April 2013, Pardew&#x27;s Newcastle side lost 3–0 to Sunderland at St James&#x27; Park, Newcastle&#x27;s biggest home defeat to Sunderland since Bill McGarry&#x27;s side lost 4–1 in February 1979.
On 6 December 2013, Pardew was awarded the November Premier League Manager of the Month award, after guiding Newcastle to four wins out of four. He followed this up with the club&#x27;s first win at Old Trafford in 41 years, defeating Manchester United 0–1 on 7 December 2013.

Newcastle&#x27;s form since the turn of the year into the end of season 2013–14 was described by the regional press as &quot;a total collapse&quot;, with the club losing 15 of 21 competitive fixtures. Fans&#x27; discontent boiled over in the final home match of the season on 3 May, when Pardew (and club owner Ashley) received vocal and sustained abuse from the stands despite a 3–0 victory over Cardiff City. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; newspaper commented: &quot;This was arguably the worst personal abuse a Newcastle manager has had to endure at any game. It was an excruciating afternoon for all concerned.&quot; Despite this, he retained the trust of owner Mike Ashley, with the press, including the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, reporting that he would be given a chance to rebuild the side for the 2014–15 season. In September 2014, with the club in bottom place in the Premier League, some fans created a website, Sackpardew.com, to instigate his dismissal. Protests were also planned before a game against Hull City, which included the printing of 30,000 A4 sheets calling for his dismissal. In November 2014, Pardew guided Newcastle to six consecutive wins in all competitions, the second time he had done so during his time as manager at the club. On 6 December 2014, Pardew&#x27;s side ended Chelsea&#x27;s unbeaten start to the season in all competitions, as Newcastle beat them 2–1 at St James&#x27; Park. On 12 December 2014, Pardew was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Month award for November 2014.

On 29 December 2014, after the dismissal of Neil Warnock, Pardew was given permission to talk to Crystal Palace on the club&#x27;s managerial vacancy, with compensation agreed. A day later, John Carver assumed first-team managerial duties, with Pardew absent from training.

===Crystal Palace===
On 3 January 2015, Pardew was confirmed as the new Crystal Palace manager, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract with the club after a compensation package of £3.5 million was agreed. Two days later, in his first match in charge, Palace won 4–0 away to Conference club Dover Athletic in the third round of the FA Cup. His first league match in charge was a 2–1 home win against Tottenham Hotspur. Crystal Palace continued in fine form under Pardew with two successive wins, including a 3–2 victory over Southampton to advance into the fifth round of the FA Cup. His first defeat in charge was a 0–1 home loss to Everton on 31 January 2015. Pardew went on to guide Crystal Palace to their best ever Premier League finish of tenth place. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that Pardew was the first manager to take over a Premier League club in the relegation zone and eventually guide them to a top half finish; and that &quot;Pardew has a legitimate claim to keeping &quot;two&quot; teams up this campaign&quot; with Newcastle &quot;staying up on the final day of the season – surviving really only on their early season form&quot;.

The 2015–16 season started well for Pardew – wins over teams such as Chelsea, Aston Villa and Liverpool meant there was talk of a UEFA Europa League spot early in the campaign. After 19 games, the season&#x27;s midpoint, Palace sat in fifth position in the Premier League, and looked well positioned to challenge for said European spot going into the New Year of 2016.

However, this target would ultimately not be reached, as Palace made a dismal start to 2016. They embarked on a 14-game winless run, which came to a halt with a 1–0 win over Norwich City. They would only win one other league game throughout the entire season – a 2–1 home victory over Stoke City on the penultimate match day of the season, enough to keep the club in the division by finishing 15th. Despite the poor league form, Pardew and his team qualified for the 2015–16 FA Cup final after a 2–1 win over Watford, thanks to goals from Yannick Bolasie and Connor Wickham. They subsequently lost the cup final 2–1 to Manchester United.

After a poor start to the 2016–17 season, and poor results overall in the 2016 calendar year, Pardew was dismissed as manager on 22 December 2016; Palace had won only six matches of 36 played in 2016. They had won one in eleven, and were placed 17th in the Premier League table at the time of his dismissal. Palace chairman Steve Parish said Pardew&#x27;s &quot;expansive style of football hasn&#x27;t worked&quot;, and, &quot;Now we&#x27;re going to wind the dial back the other way&quot;.

===West Bromwich Albion===
On 29 November 2017, Pardew was appointed as the new manager of Premier League club West Bromwich Albion, replacing the dismissed Tony Pulis, signing a contract lasting until the end of the 2019–20 season. &quot;I&#x27;m thrilled with the opportunity to work with a talented group&quot;, he said. &quot;The immediate challenge will be to get the results we need to pull ourselves up the table. But I&#x27;m aware that while I&#x27;m joining one of the great, traditional clubs of English football, it is one determined to go forward in the Premier League.&quot; John Carver joined the coaching staff as assistant manager, having previously worked under Pardew at Newcastle United. In his debut game in charge, the club drew 0–0 at The Hawthorns, against his previous club Crystal Palace.

On 2 April 2018, West Bromwich Albion and Pardew mutually parted company after he had been manager for four months. At the time, Albion had gone ten games without a win, were on a run of eight successive defeats and were bottom of the Premier League.

===ADO Den Haag===
On 24 December 2019, Pardew was announced as the new head coach of ADO Den Haag of the Dutch Eredivisie, signing a contract until the end of the 2019–20 season. He took charge of eight league games, winning one, before play was halted in the Netherlands on 12 March due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Den Haag were seven points from safety in the 2019–20 Eredivisie before the season was cancelled with no relegation. Amidst reports that he was due a £100,000 bonus for avoiding relegation, he said: &quot;In this difficult period, I would always return any bonus to the club, which will certainly find a good destination for it&quot;. He left the club on 28 April 2020 after both parties mutually agreed to not extend his contract beyond the end of the season.

===CSKA Sofia===
On 23 November 2020, he was appointed аdviser on football matters, to the owners of CSKA Sofia. In April 2022, Pardew took charge of the first team following the resignation of the manager Stoycho Mladenov. His debut game as manager was a 0–0 home draw in the First League against Levski Sofia on 17 April. Pardew lost his second league game, against Ludogorets Razgrad by a score of 5–0, marking the biggest defeat for CSKA in the season. CSKA Sofia were also defeated in the Bulgarian Cup Final by archrivals Levski Sofia.

On 1 June 2022, Pardew left CSKA as manager and technical director after bananas were thrown towards CSKA&#x27;s black players by their own supporters. His assistant, Alex Dyer, who is black, also left.

===Aris Thessaloniki===
On 14 September 2022, Pardew was appointed as the new manager of Greek Super League club Aris Thessaloniki, replacing Germán Burgos. He signed a one-year contract with the option to extend for a further year. He left the club on 23 February 2023 by mutual consent.

==Controversies==
Pardew has been involved in several controversial issues and events during his managerial career which are listed below:
* In September 2003, Pardew resigned from Reading after being refused permission to become manager at West Ham. Reading&#x27;s chairman John Madejski attempted to create an injunction in the High Court to prevent him from moving to West Ham. Eventually Reading&#x27;s legal action was dropped, and Pardew joined West Ham after a period of gardening leave.
* In March 2006, Pardew had a dispute with Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger, after he criticised Arsenal for failing to field an English player in their UEFA Champions League win against Real Madrid. Wenger suggested that Pardew was being xenophobic, a claim Pardew denied, citing his marriage to a Swedish woman.
* In November 2006, Pardew had another dispute with Wenger after celebrating West Ham&#x27;s win over Arsenal. Wenger claimed he was provoked into pushing Pardew after Pardew&#x27;s celebrations at West Ham&#x27;s late win. Wenger also refused to shake Pardew&#x27;s hand at the final whistle, as is customary. Wenger was later fined by the FA, while Pardew was cleared of the charges in January 2007.
* In October 2007, Pardew intervened on the pitch in a match against Hull City to try to break up a confrontation between Charlton and Hull players after Lloyd Sam and Ian Ashbee were sent-off. Pardew denied he made the situation worse by intervening.
* In March 2009, Pardew stated on &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot; that Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien &quot;absolutely rapes&quot; Manchester City player Ched Evans during a midfield tussle for the ball, in the sense that he bested him physically. The BBC explained why there was no on-air apology, saying: &quot;What Alan Pardew said was misheard, it was thought he used the word &#x27;rakes.&#x27;&quot;.
* On the opening day of the 2012–13 Premier League season against Tottenham Hotspur, Pardew pushed an official after an incident in which the ball appeared to go over the touchline, but the referee deemed it to still be in play. Pardew later apologised, citing his behaviour as &quot;ridiculous&quot;.
* In January 2014, during the Premier League match against Manchester City, Pardew verbally abused opposition manager Manuel Pellegrini. Pellegrini initially confronted Pardew on the touchline and accused Pardew of frivolously contesting every decision by the referee and was trying to dishonestly deceive the officials even when it was an obvious decision in City&#x27;s favour. After the initial skirmish, Pardew was caught on Sky Sports television cameras calling Pellegrini &quot;a fucking old cunt&quot;. Pardew later apologised only after being confronted by journalists about his abusive language. Pellegrini shrugged off the incident but said he disagreed with Pardew&#x27;s approach to contesting every decision by the referee.
* In March 2014, Pardew was sent to the stands after headbutting Hull City player David Meyler. The ball went out of play near Pardew and Meyler pushed past him to quickly resume play, at which point Pardew headbutted Meyler. Although Pardew apologised for his actions, he was fined £100,000 by Newcastle United and given a formal warning. On 11 March, the FA handed Pardew a three-game stadium ban with a touchline ban for a further four games. He was also fined £60,000 by the FA, in addition to the £100,000 fine from Newcastle United.

==Personal life==
Pardew is married to a Swedish woman, Tina. The couple have two daughters.

<text>Vagabond (, &quot;without roof or law&quot;) is a 1985 French drama film directed by Agnès Varda, featuring Sandrine Bonnaire. It tells through flashbacks the story of a vagabond who wanders through the Languedoc-Roussillon wine country one winter, beginning after her body is found. The film premiered at the 42nd Venice International Film Festival, where it won the Golden Lion. &quot;Vagabond&quot; was nominated for four César Awards, with Bonnaire winning Best Actress. The film was the 36th highest-grossing film of the year with a total of 1,080,143 admissions in France.

==Plot==
The film begins with the contorted body of a young woman, Mona, lying in a frost-covered ditch, beneath two twin cypress trees, in the vineyards of a small village in the Gard region. The discovery is initially treated as a simple case, quickly dismissed by the local gendarmes. Yet, Mona had been known in the village.

Through flashbacks, we learn about her life on the fringes of society. Mona, once a secretary in Paris, had grown disillusioned with her life and chosen to wander the country instead, hitchhiking, sleeping in a tent, and doing odd jobs for survival. She survives with energy despite the hunger, thirst, cold, and lack of cigarettes and marijuana. Her journey leads her to meet other wanderers, a Tunisian vineyard worker, a family of goat farmers, a maid who envies her freedom, and a professor specializing in plane trees. Mona explains to one of her companions that she left her life in Paris behind, seeking freedom and a life without responsibility.

Mona’s living conditions worsen over time. After a stint in a squat in Nîmes, which is later destroyed in a fire, she returns to the countryside but remains in isolation. She falls into a ditch, unable to rise, as the cold overtakes her.

==Critical reception==
The film was acclaimed by critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of 23 critics gave the film a positive review, for an average rating of 8.8/10.

==Style==
&quot;Vagabond&quot; combines straightforward narrative scenes, in which we see Mona living her life, with pseudo-documentary sequences in which people who knew Mona turn to the camera and say what they remember about her. Significant events are sometimes left unshown, so that the viewer must piece information together to gain a full picture.

It was filmed in the departments of Gard, Hérault and Bouches-du-Rhône.

==The title==
The original French title, &quot;Sans toit ni loi&quot; (&quot;With neither Shelter nor Law&quot;), is a play on a common French idiom, &quot;sans foi ni loi&quot;, meaning &quot;with neither faith nor law&quot;. It also puns on &quot;sans toi&quot; (&quot;without you&quot;).

<text>In mathematics, Schreier&#x27;s lemma is a theorem in group theory used in the Schreier–Sims algorithm and also for finding a presentation of a subgroup. 

==Statement==

Suppose formula_1 is a subgroup of formula_2, which is finitely generated with generating set formula_3, that is, formula_4. 

Let formula_5 be a right transversal of formula_1 in formula_2. In other words, formula_5 is (the image of) a section of the quotient map formula_9, where formula_10 denotes the set of right cosets of formula_1 in formula_2.

The definition is made given that formula_13, formula_14 is the chosen representative in the transversal formula_5 of the coset formula_16, that is, 
:formula_17

Then formula_1 is generated by the set
:formula_19

Hence, in particular, Schreier&#x27;s lemma implies that every subgroup of finite index of a finitely generated group is again finitely generated.

== Example ==
The group Z3 = Z/3Z is cyclic. Via Cayley&#x27;s theorem, Z3 is a subgroup of the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;3. Now,
: formula_20
: formula_21
where formula_22 is the identity permutation. Note &quot;S&quot;3 = formula_23{ &quot;s&quot;1=(1 2), &quot;s&quot;2 = (1 2 3) }formula_24.

Z3 has just two cosets, Z3 and &quot;S&quot;3 \ Z3, so we select the transversal { &quot;t&quot;1 = &quot;e&quot;, &quot;t&quot;2=(1 2) }, and we have 
: formula_25

Finally, 
: formula_26
: formula_27
: formula_28
: formula_29

Thus, by Schreier&#x27;s subgroup lemma, { e, (1 2 3) } generates Z3, but having the identity in the generating set is redundant, so it can be removed to obtain another generating set for Z3, { (1 2 3) } (as expected).

<text>Elisabeth Findlay is a New Zealand fashion designer. She co-founded the fashion house Zambesi with her husband, Neville Findlay, in 1979.

== Career ==
Findlay was born in Athens, Greece. In 1951 the Red Cross relocated her family to Dunedin, New Zealand. Though her mother taught her and her sisters how to sew, she never received any formal training in fashion design. At 21 she moved to Auckland and got a job working at a clothing company. Through this experience she learned how to use industrial machines, and the production behind clothes.

In 1976, encouraged by her sister, Margi Robertson, she opened &quot;Tart&quot; boutique store in Parnell Auckland. She selected labels to sell based on her own taste and included New Zealand designers such as Marilyn Sainty. She sold only a few garments in the store of her own design. A second store, Cachet, was opened in Takapuna in 1978.

In 1979, her husband left his job as a design engineer and they formed their label &quot;Zambesi&quot;. That same year, they opened their first store at 31 Lorne Street in Auckland, followed by a second store in Queen&#x27;s Arcade in 1981. By 1986, these two central Auckland stores were merged to create their flagship store on Vulcan Lane. This store remained open until 2012, at which time they shifted to Britomart.

The label first gained international acclaim in 1991 when they were first invited to show at Australia Fashion week in Sydney. This was the first year the New Zealand designers were invited to show at the Fashion week.

In the 2008 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, both Liz and Neville Findlay were appointed Officers of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to business and fashion.

<text>Poly-Play is an arcade cabinet developed in East Germany in 1985; it is the only such machine to originate in the GDR. It was created by VEB Polytechnik and contained a number of games, including a &quot;Pac-Man&quot; clone.

A total of about 2,000 units of the cabinet were manufactured.

== Hardware ==

&quot;Poly-Play&quot; ran on a U880, a clone of the Zilog Z80 CPU, which was clocked at 2.457600 MHz and a custom sound chip. Its display ran at a resolution of 512*256 at 50 Hz and supported a palette of ten colours, though it could also use coloured overlays. The machine&#x27;s coin slot was designed for 50 Pfennig, but it was flawed - the pressure sensor could be deceived by pressing a 1-Pfennig coin very sharply into the top of the slot. However, this was largely tolerated because the machine was not a capitalistic commercial venture, but a state-owned product found predominantly in FDGB holiday homes, youth hostels and non-profit clubs. The machine ran with a deactivated coin slot in many youth clubs. However, the free play often caused large crowds to form around it, which incited their reactivation.

A &quot;Poly-Play&quot; machine was on display in the Museum of Computing in Swindon, England in 2004. From 2005, the same machine was part of the touring video game show Game On and was exhibited in multiple museums, such as the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago and the Science Museum in London. Two machines can also be seen at RetroGames e.V. in Germany. It is also prominently on display at the Computerspielemuseum Berlin.

==Games==

The machine allowed to play the following games, chosen from a selection screen:





The eight aforementioned games were made available to be playable with the emulator MAME in 2000. Additionally, the names of four other games were found in the source code: &quot;Der Gärtner&quot; (The Gardener), &quot;Im Gewächshaus&quot; (In the Greenhouse), &quot;Hagelnde Wolken&quot; (Hailing Clouds, a &quot;Space Invaders&quot; clone) and &quot;Der Taucher&quot; (The Diver, a game where malicious fish attack a diver). All four games have been installed on at least some machines, the same goes for the games &quot;Im Irrgarten&quot; (In the Maze), &quot;Der Lindwurm&quot; (The Lindworm), &quot;Fly&quot; and &quot;AFU&quot;. Another game titled &quot;UFO&quot; is actually the original version of &quot;Hagelnde Wolken&quot;, but was edited due to being deemed too martial by the authorities.

<text>Todd Solondz (; born October 15, 1959) is an American filmmaker and playwright known for his style of dark, socially conscious satire. Solondz&#x27;s work has received critical acclaim for its commentary on the &quot;dark underbelly of middle class American suburbia&quot;, a reflection of his own background in New Jersey. His work includes &quot;Welcome to the Dollhouse&quot; (1995), &quot;Happiness&quot; (1998), &quot;Storytelling&quot; (2001), &quot;Palindromes&quot; (2004), &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; (2009), &quot;Dark Horse&quot; (2011), and &quot;Wiener-Dog&quot; (2016). He is also a professor at New York University.

==Background==
Solondz was born in 1959 in Newark, New Jersey, and grew up in its nearby suburbs. He wrote several screenplays while working as a delivery boy for the Writers Guild of America. Solondz earned his undergraduate degree in English from Yale and attended New York University&#x27;s Master of Fine Arts program in film and television, but did not complete a degree.

During the early 1990s, Solondz worked at NYANA as a teacher of English as a second language to Russian immigrants in New York City and described the experience as positive.

Solondz is an atheist. In &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; article &quot;Is There a God?&quot;, he answered the question &quot;Well, me, I&#x27;m an atheist, so I don&#x27;t really believe there is. But I suppose I could be proven wrong.&quot;

, Solondz lives in New York City, in Greenwich Village. He and his wife have two children.

==Career==

===1980s===
Solondz&#x27;s student short film &quot;Schatt&#x27;s Last Shot&quot; was produced in 1985, and was shown at least once in 1986. The title character is a high schooler who wants to get into Stanford University, but his gym teacher hates him. The teacher fails him because he cannot make a shot in basketball. He has no luck with the girl of his dreams, but he wishes he was more like the coach, whom he challenges to a game of one-on-one.

In 1989 Solondz wrote and directed &quot;Fear, Anxiety &amp; Depression&quot;, an episodic comedy about fledgling playwright Ira (played by Solondz) and his frustrating interactions with women. The film contains several musical interludes, including three songs written for the film. Stanley Tucci appears in one of his early roles as an old, disliked acquaintance of Ira, who takes up playwriting on a whim and becomes the toast of Off-Broadway.

===1990s===
The frustrations of his first feature led Solondz to swear off further involvement with the industry. More than five years later, an attorney friend urged Solondz to give filmmaking another go, and promised partial finance for any project Solondz came up with. The result was 1995&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to the Dollhouse&quot;, which went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. The dark comedy follows the travails of Dawn Wiener, a bespectacled, toothy, and shy 7th-grade girl who is mercilessly teased at school and treated to alternating contempt and neglect at home. It was distinct from most earlier films about adolescent abuse due to its complex characterization. It gave a balanced and sometimes sympathetic portrayal of the bully antagonist Brandon, and its depiction of Dawn, the ostensible protagonist and victim of the story, showed her as deeply flawed and sometimes cruel and selfish. The film was a major success among critics, and a moderate success at the box office. It was a festival hit, with screenings all over the world.

Solondz&#x27;s next piece was &quot;Happiness&quot; (1998), a highly controversial film due to the themes explored in it, which range from rape, pedophilia, incest, suicide, and murder to a bizarre sexual phone caller. After the original distributor October Films dropped it, the film was distributed by Good Machine Releasing. The movie received numerous awards, including International Critics&#x27; Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and yielded strong critical praise for Solondz.

===2000s===
In 2001, Solondz released &quot;Storytelling&quot;, which premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. It is a film separated into two parts, entitled &quot;Fiction&quot; and &quot;Nonfiction.&quot; The two stories share two thematic elements, but deal with each in an autonomous manner. Solondz used this format because he wanted to &quot;find a fresh structure, a fresh form, and a different way of tackling what may be identical geographical material.&quot; When Solondz initially presented the film to the MPAA, he was told that if he wished to receive a rating other than NC-17, he would have to remove a scene of explicit sex involving a white female and a black male. However, a clause in Solondz&#x27;s contract allowed him to cover part of the actors with a bright red box. &quot;For me it&#x27;s a great victory to have a big red box, the first red box in any studio feature [...] it&#x27;s right in your face: You&#x27;re not allowed to see this in our country.&quot; Solondz did, however, remove a portion of the film (which has variously been reported as either a subplot of the second story, or a third story entirely) which contained a sex scene involving two male actors (one of whom was James Van Der Beek).

Solondz&#x27;s next film, &quot;Palindromes&quot; (2004), raised the eyebrows of many pundits and reviewers due to its themes of child molestation, statutory rape and abortion. Like all of Solondz&#x27;s previous films, &quot;Palindromes&quot; is set in suburban New Jersey. It was released unrated in the US.

&quot;Life During Wartime&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Forgiveness&quot;) was produced by John Hart and Evamere Entertainment and released in 2009. Solondz said the film is a companion piece to &quot;Happiness&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Dollhouse&quot;. &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; has characters in common with the two earlier films, but played by different actors and with loose continuity. Information about the characters in the film, and their differences from those of its predecessor &quot;Happiness&quot;, first emerged in August 2009. The film features Ally Sheedy, Renée Taylor, Paul Reubens, Ciarán Hinds, Shirley Henderson, Michael Lerner, Michael Kenneth Williams, Charlotte Rampling, Allison Janney, Rich Pecci and Chris Marquette.

The film debuted at the Telluride Film Festival in September 2009; it was nominated for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in August–September 2009, and it won the Osella award there for Best Screenplay.

In 2009, Solondz became an adjunct professor on the faculty of New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts. , he is a tenured professor teaching classes on writing and directing.

===2010s===
In July 2010, Solondz completed the script of his next film, &quot;Dark Horse&quot;, which was filmed in the fall of 2010. To Solondz&#x27;s surprise, the Creative Artists Agency appreciated the script, the first time for a movie of his. Solondz commented that he realized this is because &quot;there&#x27;s no rape, there&#x27;s no child molestation, there&#x27;s no masturbation, and then I thought, &#x27;omg, why didn&#x27;t I think of this years ago?&#x27;&quot;

On September 5, 2011, &quot;Dark Horse&quot; was presented at the Venice Film Festival. On October 14, 2011, &quot;Dark Horse&quot; made its European premiere at the BFI London Film Festival. The film received a mixed reception. On April 23, 2012, &quot;Dark Horse&quot; was announced as the Closing Night selection for Maryland Film Festival 2012.

&quot;Wiener-Dog&quot; premiered at Sundance 2016. The film tells the story of a dog, as she travels from home to home. Amazon purchased the film at the festival. Starring an ensemble cast led by Ellen Burstyn, Kieran Culkin, Julie Delpy, Danny DeVito, Greta Gerwig, Tracy Letts, and Zosia Mamet, the film serves as a spin-off from Solondz&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Welcome to the Dollhouse&quot;, which also features the character of Dawn Wiener. It was released in the US on June 24, 2016, to positive reviews.

In 2017, it was reported that Penélope Cruz and Edgar Ramírez were attached to star Solondz&#x27;s next film &quot;Love Child&quot;, a darkly comedic twist on the story of Oedipus.

In 2018, Solondz premiered his debut play, titled &quot;Emma and Max&quot;. The production began previews October 1, opened on October 14, and ran through November 4. It starred Ilana Becker, Zonya Love, Matt Servitto, and Rita Wolf.

In May 2019, Solondz spent a week as the filmmaker in residence at the Centre for Film and Screen at the University of Cambridge.

===2020s===
In 2021, Solondz was in the process of arranging financing for &quot;Love Child&quot;. He described the project as &quot;my first movie with a plot and my first movie taking place in Texas&quot;, shaped by the Hollywood films that made him want to become a filmmaker. At this time, Rachel Weisz and Colin Farrell were announced to star as the leads, in place of Cruz and Ramírez.

By 2024, it was reported that Charles Melton and Elizabeth Olsen were now cast to star in the main roles. Principal photography was scheduled to begin in late 2024 in New York City and Texas, but in June, the production was abruptly cancelled due to lack of funding.

<text>Palm butter or palm cream, frequently known as moambe, mwambe or nyembwe, is an ingredient made from the pericarp (not the seeds) of palm nuts, the fruit of the African oil palm (&quot;Elaeis guineensis&quot;) tree. It forms an important ingredient in stews and sauces in African cuisine.

Dishes made with the sauce often include peanuts, peanut sauce, or peanut butter. The meat usually used in the dishes is chicken but other meats, such as beef, fish, mutton, or any wild game meat, such as crocodile or venison, are used as well. Moambe chicken is considered a national dish of three African countries.

==Regional variations==

In order to make palm butter, palm nuts are boiled and then pounded. The pulp is mixed with water, sieved and boiled again. Canned palm soup base, also called &quot;sauce graine&quot; or &quot;noix de palme&quot; may be substituted.

===Angola===
In Angola, the dish is called &quot;moamba de galinha&quot; and is considered a national dish as well. It is usually served with funge, a manioc purée, and can be made with fish on occasions.

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
In western regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, &quot;mwambi&quot; or &quot;mwambe&quot; () is the name given to the sauce of palm oil or peanuts. Poulet à la Moambé, &quot;chicken in a &quot;moambe&quot; sauce&quot;, is also considered the Congo&#x27;s national dish.

===Gabon===
In Gabon, the sauce is usually called &quot;nyembwe&quot;, from the Myene word for palm oil. The most important dish using nyembwe is nyembwe chicken (French: &quot;poulet [au] nyembwe&quot; or &quot;poulet [au] gnemboue&quot;) which is considered a national dish of Gabon.

<doc id="897731" wikidata="Q7837996" url="?curid=897731" title="Trelise Cooper">
<text>Dame Trelise Pamela Cooper (née Neill; born ) is a fashion designer from New Zealand. Her designs have featured in magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;, &quot;InStyle&quot; and the television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;.

==Early life==
Cooper was born to Joe and Pam Neill, and grew up in Henderson, West Auckland. She attended Henderson High School, and volunteered at Lifeline crisis support service as a teenager. 

She left school at the age of 15 and married two years later. She and her husband ran a building business together, but the marriage ended in divorce when Cooper was 21.

==Career==
Cooper&#x27;s design business began in the early 1980s, with her first boutique opening in 1985. She then took a break from business to have a baby, and returned in late 1996.

Cooper creates five clothing ranges - Trelise Cooper, Cooper by Trelise, COOP, Board Room and Trelise Cooper Kids, all of which she shows at New Zealand Fashion Week. Customers include Liv Tyler, Miley Cyrus, Lindsay Lohan, Stevie Nicks, Suri Cruise, Julia Roberts, and The Pussycat Dolls. She also produces Trelise Cooper Interiors, a fabric range made in association with textiles house Charles Parsons.

Cooper&#x27;s signature fragrance &#x27;Trelise&#x27; was launched in late 2009. It was designed by perfumer Yves Dombrowsky and has been described as an uplifting, positive scent.

In March 2009, she became the first New Zealand designer to stage a fashion show on board the Queen Mary 2 cruise ship.

Cooper is a patron of the Breast Cancer Research Trust, an advocate for domestic violence awareness and supports Habitat for Humanity. At 2009&#x27;s New Zealand Fashion Week Cooper initiated an onsite house build to promote this charity. 

She is also an environmental supporter, producing eco bags for supermarket chain Progressive Enterprises. She is involved with the UN-sponsored organisation MARITAGE International, which connects young women in developed and developing countries, and also mentors young people in New Zealand.

In December 2005, Cooper was involved in an intellectual property dispute with fellow New Zealand fashion designer Tamsin Cooper, objecting to Tamsin registering her name as a trademark. In July 2007, Cooper agreed to drop the suit and let Tamsin Cooper operate under her own name.

As of 2016, Cooper has 10 boutiques around the world, and her ranges are stocked in more than 200 stores in Australasia, Asia, Europe, America and the Middle East.

===Recognition===
The Trelise Cooper Kids Auckland flagship store won the supreme award at the 2007 New Zealand Retail Interior Design Awards.

In 2004, Cooper was named a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit. In the 2014 New Year Honours, she was elevated to Dame Companion in the same Order.

In 2015, Cooper announced that it will be her final year as a manager. In 2015, her collections were included into the New Zealand Fashion Museum. In 2018, Cooper was inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame.

===Controversies===
In 2011 she and at least 10 of her models were accused of engaging in modern Orientalism by taping the models&#x27; eyes to change their shape to more resemble Asian features.

In 2014 Trelise Cooper sparked controversy when she repeated the same offense made by Victoria&#x27;s Secret in 2012 and Chanel in 2013 by having models wear sacred Native American feathered headdresses. Cooper stated in her apology &#x27;I genuinely respect and honour all cultures, races and religions. It was never my intention to disrespect another culture.&#x27; Originally described by the designer as portraying &#x27;70&#x27;s bohemian vibes&#x27;, many critics online pointed out the connection between nostalgia and ignorance in this incident. Filmmaker Taika Waititi was quoted as saying &quot;I think I understand what Trelise means by &#x27;70s vibes&#x27; - a time when it was cool to be culturally insensitive and racism was super awesome. Nice throw back to better times...&#x27;

In December 2020, Cooper was criticised for naming a new floral polyester dress design the &quot;Trail of Tiers&quot;, after the forced relocation of about 46,000 American Indians between 1830 and 1850 by the United States Government. The sociologist Professor Joanne Kidman criticised Cooper for her perceived insensitivity to the historical suffering of Indigenous peoples. Cooper apologised for the hurt caused by the dress&#x27;s name design and announced that the design would be removed from stores.

==Personal life==
She has a husband, Jack, a stepdaughter, Nadia Cooper and a son Jasper Cooper. Nadia was charged with smuggling of Methamphetamine into one of the Mount Eden Prisons, as well as its distribution in 2008.

<doc id="897733" wikidata="Q2208651" url="?curid=897733" title="Transversal (combinatorics)">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in combinatorics, given a family of sets, here called a collection &quot;C&quot;, a transversal (also called a cross-section) is a set containing exactly one element from each member of the collection. When the sets of the collection are mutually disjoint, each element of the transversal corresponds to exactly one member of &quot;C&quot; (the set it is a member of). If the original sets are not disjoint, there are two possibilities for the definition of a transversal:

* One variation is that there is a bijection &quot;f&quot; from the transversal to &quot;C&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; is an element of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for each &quot;x&quot; in the transversal. In this case, the transversal is also called a system of distinct representatives (SDR). 
* The other, less commonly used, does not require a one-to-one relation between the elements of the transversal and the sets of &quot;C&quot;. In this situation, the members of the system of representatives are not necessarily distinct.

In computer science, computing transversals is useful in several application domains, with the input family of sets often being described as a hypergraph.

In set theory, the axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that every partition has a transversal.

==Existence and number==

A fundamental question in the study of SDR is whether or not an SDR exists. Hall&#x27;s marriage theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite collection of sets, some possibly overlapping, to have a transversal. The condition is that, for every integer &quot;k&quot;, every collection of &quot;k&quot; sets must contain in common at least &quot;k&quot; different elements. 

The following refinement by H. J. Ryser gives lower bounds on the number of such SDRs.

&quot;Theorem&quot;. Let &quot;S&quot;1, &quot;S&quot;2, ..., &quot;S&quot;&quot;m&quot; be a collection of sets such that formula_1 contains at least &quot;k&quot; elements for &quot;k&quot; = 1,2...,&quot;m&quot; and for all &quot;k&quot;-combinations {formula_2} of the integers 1,2...,&quot;m&quot; and suppose that each of these sets contains at least &quot;t&quot; elements. If &quot;t&quot; ≤ &quot;m&quot; then the collection has at least &quot;t&quot; ! SDRs, and if &quot;t&quot; &gt; &quot;m&quot; then the collection has at least &quot;t&quot; ! / (&quot;t&quot; - &quot;m&quot;)! SDRs.

== Relation to matching and covering ==
One can construct a bipartite graph in which the vertices on one side are the sets, the vertices on the other side are the elements, and the edges connect a set to the elements it contains. Then, a transversal (defined as a system of &quot;distinct&quot; representatives) is equivalent to a perfect matching in this graph.

One can construct a hypergraph in which the vertices are the elements, and the hyperedges are the sets. Then, a transversal (defined as a system of &quot;not-necessarily-distinct&quot; representatives) is a vertex cover in a hypergraph.

==Examples==
In group theory, given a subgroup &quot;H&quot; of a group &quot;G&quot;, a right (respectively left) transversal is a set containing exactly one element from each right (respectively left) coset of &quot;H&quot;. In this case, the &quot;sets&quot; (cosets) are mutually disjoint, i.e. the cosets form a partition of the group.

As a particular case of the previous example, given a direct product of groups formula_3, then &quot;H&quot; is a transversal for the cosets of &quot;K&quot;.

In general, since any equivalence relation on an arbitrary set gives rise to a partition, picking any representative from each equivalence class results in a transversal.

Another instance of a partition-based transversal occurs when one considers the equivalence relation known as the (set-theoretic) kernel of a function, defined for a function formula_4 with domain &quot;X&quot; as the partition of the domain formula_5. which partitions the domain of &quot;f&quot; into equivalence classes such that all elements in a class map via &quot;f&quot; to the same value. If &quot;f&quot; is injective, there is only one transversal of formula_6. For a not-necessarily-injective &quot;f&quot;, fixing a transversal &quot;T&quot; of formula_6 induces a one-to-one correspondence between &quot;T&quot; and the image of &quot;f&quot;, henceforth denoted by formula_8. Consequently, a function formula_9 is well defined by the property that for all &quot;z&quot; in formula_10 where &quot;x&quot; is the unique element in &quot;T&quot; such that formula_11; furthermore, &quot;g&quot; can be extended (not necessarily in a unique manner) so that it is defined on the whole codomain of &quot;f&quot; by picking arbitrary values for &quot;g(z)&quot; when &quot;z&quot; is outside the image of &quot;f&quot;. It is a simple calculation to verify that &quot;g&quot; thus defined has the property that formula_12, which is the proof (when the domain and codomain of &quot;f&quot; are the same set) that the full transformation semigroup is a regular semigroup. formula_13 acts as a (not necessarily unique) quasi-inverse for &quot;f&quot;; within semigroup theory this is simply called an inverse. Note however that for an arbitrary &quot;g&quot; with the aforementioned property the &quot;dual&quot; equation formula_14 may not hold. However if we denote by formula_15, then &quot;f&quot; is a quasi-inverse of &quot;h&quot;, i.e. formula_16.
== Common transversals ==
A common transversal of the collections &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; (where formula_17) is a set that is a transversal of both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. The collections &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; have a common transversal if and only if, for all formula_18,

:formula_19

== Generalizations ==
A partial transversal is a set containing at most one element from each member of the collection, or (in the stricter form of the concept) a set with an injection from the set to &quot;C&quot;. The transversals of a finite collection &quot;C&quot; of finite sets form the basis sets of a matroid, the transversal matroid of &quot;C&quot;. The independent sets of the transversal matroid are the partial transversals of &quot;C&quot;. 

An independent transversal (also called a rainbow-independent set or independent system of representatives) is a transversal which is also an independent set of a given graph. To explain the difference in figurative terms, consider a faculty with &quot;m&quot; departments, where the faculty dean wants to construct a committee of &quot;m&quot; members, one member per department. Such a committee is a transversal. But now, suppose that some faculty members dislike each other and do not agree to sit in the committee together. In this case, the committee must be an independent transversal, where the underlying graph describes the &quot;dislike&quot; relations.

Another generalization of the concept of a transversal would be a set that just has a non-empty intersection with each member of &quot;C&quot;. An example of the latter would be a Bernstein set, which is defined as a set that has a non-empty intersection with each set of &quot;C&quot;, but contains no set of &quot;C&quot;, where &quot;C&quot; is the collection of all perfect sets of a topological Polish space. As another example, let &quot;C&quot; consist of all the lines of a projective plane, then a blocking set in this plane is a set of points which intersects each line but contains no line.

==Category theory==
In the language of category theory, a transversal of a collection of mutually disjoint sets is a section of the quotient map induced by the collection.

==Computational complexity==
The computational complexity of computing all transversals of an input family of sets has been studied, in particular in the framework of enumeration algorithms.

<text>A macroeconomic model is an analytical tool designed to describe the operation of the problems of economy of a country or a region. These models are usually designed to examine the comparative statics and dynamics of aggregate quantities such as the total amount of goods and services produced, total income earned, the level of employment of productive resources, and the level of prices.

Macroeconomic models may be logical, mathematical, and/or computational; the different types of macroeconomic models serve different purposes and have different advantages and disadvantages. Macroeconomic models may be used to clarify and illustrate basic theoretical principles; they may be used to test, compare, and quantify different macroeconomic theories; they may be used to produce &quot;what if&quot; scenarios (usually to predict the effects of changes in monetary, fiscal, or other macroeconomic policies); and they may be used to generate economic forecasts. Thus, macroeconomic models are widely used in academia in teaching and research, and are also widely used by international organizations, national governments and larger corporations, as well as by economic consultants and think tanks.

==Types==

===Simple theoretical models===
Simple textbook descriptions of the macroeconomy involving a small number of equations or diagrams are often called ‘models’. Examples include the IS-LM model and Mundell–Fleming model of Keynesian macroeconomics, and the Solow model of neoclassical growth theory. These models share several features. They are based on a few equations involving a few variables, which can often be explained with simple diagrams. Many of these models are static, but some are dynamic, describing the economy over many time periods. The variables that appear in these models often represent macroeconomic aggregates (such as GDP or total employment) rather than individual choice variables, and while the equations relating these variables are intended to describe economic decisions, they are not usually derived directly by aggregating models of individual choices. They are simple enough to be used as illustrations of theoretical points in introductory explanations of macroeconomic ideas; but therefore quantitative application to forecasting, testing, or policy evaluation is usually impossible without substantially augmenting the structure of the model.

===Empirical forecasting models===

In the 1940s and 1950s, as governments began accumulating national income and product accounting data, economists set out to construct quantitative models to describe the dynamics observed in the data. These models estimated the relations between different macroeconomic variables using (mostly linear) time series analysis. Like the simpler theoretical models, these empirical models described relations between aggregate quantities, but many addressed a much finer level of detail (for example, studying the relations between output, employment, investment, and other variables in many different industries). Thus, these models grew to include hundreds or thousands of equations describing the evolution of hundreds or thousands of prices and quantities over time, making computers essential for their solution. While the choice of which variables to include in each equation was partly guided by economic theory (for example, including past income as a determinant of consumption, as suggested by the theory of adaptive expectations), variable inclusion was mostly determined on purely empirical grounds.

Dutch economist Jan Tinbergen developed the first comprehensive national model, which he built for the Netherlands in 1936. He later applied the same modeling structure to the economies of the United States and the United Kingdom. The first global macroeconomic model, Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates&#x27; LINK project, was initiated by Lawrence Klein. The model was cited in 1980 when Klein, like Tinbergen before him, won the Nobel Prize. Large-scale empirical models of this type, including the Wharton model, are still in use today, especially for forecasting purposes.

====The Lucas critique of empirical forecasting models====
Econometric studies in the first part of the 20th century showed a negative correlation between inflation and unemployment called the Phillips curve. Empirical macroeconomic forecasting models, being based on roughly the same data, had similar implications: they suggested that unemployment could be permanently lowered by permanently increasing inflation. However, in 1968, Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps argued that this apparent tradeoff was illusory. They claimed that the historical relation between inflation and unemployment was due to the fact that past inflationary episodes had been largely unexpected. They argued that if monetary authorities permanently raised the inflation rate, workers and firms would eventually come to understand this, at which point the economy would return to its previous, higher level of unemployment, but now with higher inflation too. The stagflation of the 1970s appeared to bear out their prediction.

In 1976, Robert Lucas Jr., published an influential paper arguing that the failure of the Phillips curve in the 1970s was just one example of a general problem with empirical forecasting models. He pointed out that such models are derived from observed relationships between various macroeconomic quantities over time, and that these relations differ depending on what macroeconomic policy regime is in place. In the context of the Phillips curve, this means that the relation between inflation and unemployment observed in an economy where inflation has usually been low in the past would differ from the relation observed in an economy where inflation has been high. Furthermore, this means one cannot predict the effects of a new policy regime using an empirical forecasting model based on data from previous periods when that policy regime was not in place. Lucas argued that economists would remain unable to predict the effects of new policies unless they built models based on economic fundamentals (like preferences, technology, and budget constraints) that should be unaffected by policy changes.

===Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models===
Partly as a response to the Lucas critique, economists of the 1980s and 1990s began to construct microfounded macroeconomic models based on rational choice, which have come to be called dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. These models begin by specifying the set of agents active in the economy, such as households, firms, and governments in one or more countries, as well as the preferences, technology, and budget constraint of each one. Each agent is assumed to make an optimal choice, taking into account prices and the strategies of other agents, both in the current period and in the future. Summing up the decisions of the different types of agents, it is possible to find the prices that equate supply with demand in every market. Thus these models embody a type of equilibrium self-consistency: agents choose optimally given the prices, while prices must be consistent with agents’ supplies and demands.

DSGE models often assume that all agents of a given type are identical (i.e. there is a ‘representative household’ and a ‘representative firm’) and can perform perfect calculations that forecast the future correctly on average (which is called rational expectations). However, these are only simplifying assumptions, and are not essential for the DSGE methodology; many DSGE studies aim for greater realism by considering heterogeneous agents or various types of adaptive expectations. Compared with empirical forecasting models, DSGE models typically have fewer variables and equations, mainly because DSGE models are harder to solve, even with the help of computers. Simple theoretical DSGE models, involving only a few variables, have been used to analyze the forces that drive business cycles; this empirical work has given rise to two main competing frameworks called the real business cycle model and the New Keynesian DSGE model. More elaborate DSGE models are used to predict the effects of changes in economic policy and evaluate their impact on social welfare. However, economic forecasting is still largely based on more traditional empirical models, which are still widely believed to achieve greater accuracy in predicting the impact of economic disturbances over time.

====DSGE versus CGE models====

A methodology that pre-dates DSGE modeling is computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling. Like DSGE models, CGE models are often microfounded on assumptions about preferences, technology, and budget constraints. However, CGE models focus mostly on long-run relationships, making them most suited to studying the long-run impact of permanent policies like the tax system or the openness of the economy to international trade. DSGE models instead emphasize the dynamics of the economy over time (often at a quarterly frequency), making them suited for studying business cycles and the cyclical effects of monetary and fiscal policy.

===Agent-based computational macroeconomic models===
Another modeling methodology is Agent-based computational economics (ACE), which is a variety of Agent-based modeling. Like the DSGE methodology, ACE seeks to break down aggregate macroeconomic relationships into microeconomic decisions of individual agents. ACE models also begin by defining the set of agents that make up the economy, and specify the types of interactions individual agents can have with each other or with the market as a whole. Instead of defining the preferences of those agents, ACE models often jump directly to specifying their strategies. Or sometimes, preferences are specified, together with an initial strategy and a learning rule whereby the strategy is adjusted according to its past success. Given these strategies, the interaction of large numbers of individual agents (who may be very heterogeneous) can be simulated on a computer, and then the aggregate, macroeconomic relationships that arise from those individual actions can be studied.

====Strengths and weaknesses of DSGE and ACE models====

DSGE and ACE models have different advantages and disadvantages due to their different underlying structures. DSGE models may exaggerate individual rationality and foresight, and understate the importance of heterogeneity, since the rational expectations, representative agent case remains the simplest and thus the most common type of DSGE model to solve. Also, unlike ACE models, it may be difficult to study local interactions between individual agents in DSGE models, which instead focus mostly on the way agents interact through aggregate prices. On the other hand, ACE models may exaggerate errors in individual decision-making, since the strategies assumed in ACE models may be very far from optimal choices unless the modeler is very careful. A related issue is that ACE models which start from strategies instead of preferences may remain vulnerable to the Lucas critique: a changed policy regime should generally give rise to changed strategies.

<text>The Nolichucky River is a river that flows through western North Carolina and East Tennessee in the southeastern United States. Traversing the Pisgah National Forest and the Cherokee National Forest in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the river&#x27;s watershed includes some of the highest mountains in the Appalachians, including Mount Mitchell in North Carolina, the highest point in the eastern United States. The river is a tributary of the French Broad River and is impounded by Nolichucky Dam near Greeneville, Tennessee.

==Hydrography==
The Nolichucky River rises as the confluence of the North Toe River and the Cane River near the community of Huntdale, North Carolina. The stream succeeds the North Toe as the boundary between Yancey County and Mitchell County, North Carolina. Trending roughly westward, it flows along the northern base of Flattop Mountain. The gorge is especially steep on its north side. Geologically, the area is predominantly underlain by metamorphic rock of Precambrian age.
The river then enters Unicoi County, Tennessee, as it drops through a whitewater gorge, flowing between the ranges of the Bald Mountains (to the south) and the Unaka Mountains (to the north). Turning northwest, the stream is bridged by the Appalachian Trail and by U.S. Highway 19W southwest of Erwin, Tennessee. Near Erwin, two tributary streams, South Indian Creek and North Indian Creek, join the Nolichucky River. Turning more to the north, the stream is paralleled for several miles by State Route 81, (which is also concurrent with Tennessee State Route 107 for several miles) crossing into Washington County. The river cuts between several mountains at this point, including Rich Mountain to the south and Buffalo Mountain to the north.

Shortly after entering Washington County, the river makes a horseshoe bend near Embreeville, where it is bridged by SR 81 and SR 107 for the first time. At the northeastern end of Embreeville Mountain, the stream emerges from a large gap and turning west-southwest is bridged by SR 81 again. Here it exits the Blue Ridge Mountains and enters the Ridge and Valley province, which is underlain primarily by sedimentary rock of the Lower Paleozoic Era. The river then continues west-southwest for several miles, paralleled by SR 107. The river leaves the roadside near Mt. Carmel. From there it flows northwest over a winding course to David Crockett Birthplace State Park near the Washington County–Greene County line. Many tributary creeks join the river in Washington and Greene counties. At the county line, one of the larger tributaries, Big Limestone Creek, joins the river. State Route 351 crosses the river west of Crockett&#x27;s birthplace.

The river then flows southwestward, following the trends of the Ridge and Valley province&#x27;s underlying geology. Bridged by SR 107 again just east of Tusculum, the stream continues southwestward, later bridged by State Route 350 just above an impoundment caused by Nolichucky Dam.

This dam was constructed as a hydroelectric project by the former Tennessee Electric Power Company in 1912. The dam was sold to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in 1939, when the agency was established by the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression. The TVA continued to operate the dam for electrical power purposes until the 1970s. The degree of siltation of the reservoir, called Davy Crockett Lake, had made continued efforts to operate the facility for hydroelectric purposes impracticable. The agency retired the dam as a power source but continues to maintain it and to use it for flood control and recreational purposes. Just west of the dam, the river crosses State Route 70 and SR 107 for a third and final time.

Continuing almost due west, the river is bridged by U.S. Highway 321. Just before reaching the Greene County–Cocke County line, the river is bridged by State Route 340. Just past this point, the river becomes the border between the counties. A few miles below this point it is bridged by Knob Creek Road. South of Interstate 81, Greene, Cocke, and Hamblen counties come to a point at a bend in river, where Lick Creek joins the river. From this point on, the meandering stream forms the Hamblen County–Cocke County line.

The confluence of the Nolichucky with the French Broad River occurs in the upstream portion of the Douglas Lake impoundment, caused by Douglas Dam, a World War II-era TVA project located downstream along the French Broad. The mouth of the Nolichucky lies near the point where Hamblen, Cocke, and Jefferson counties meet. Near the mouth is the Rankin Wildlife Management Area, a reserve operated by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency.

==History==
While the origins of the name-place have long been debated and remain unclear, it is believed to be derived from the name of the Cherokee village &quot;Na’na-tlu gun’yi,&quot; or &quot;Spruce-Tree Place,&quot; that once stood near modern Jonesborough, Tennessee. Some claim that according to local lore, it means &quot;Rushing Water(s)&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Water(s)&quot;, or &quot;Black Swirling Water&quot;.

During the 1770s, European frontiersmen established the &quot;Nolichucky settlements&quot; along the river in modern Greene County, in what was then part of Cherokee territory. These settlements were aligned with the Watauga settlements in what is now Elizabethton. As hostilities intensified in the mid-1770s between the settlers and a faction of the Cherokee, known as the &quot;Chickamaugas,&quot; who were opposed to the settlements, John Sevier, at the time a young militia officer, began overseeing the construction of Fort Lee. After an invasion was launched by Chickamauga leader Dragging Canoe in July 1776, Sevier abandoned the unfinished fort and fled to the Watauga settlements. Sevier would later acquire the nickname &quot;Nolichucky Jack&quot; or &quot;Chucky Jack&quot; for his exploits along the river and in its vicinity.
Famed frontiersman Davy Crockett was born along the river near Limestone, Tennessee, in 1786. The site is now the focus of David Crockett Birthplace State Park.

The turn of the century brought trains hauling passengers (until 1955) and mostly coal on the Clinchfield Railroad (now operated by CSX), which still runs alongside the river through the gorge with bridged crossings at Unaka Springs (Erwin) and Poplar, North Carolina. At least one sunken railcar sits at the bottom of the river near the entrance to the Lost Cove Settlement, a civil-war era ghost town just upriver (and uphill) from the once-disputed Tennessee-North Carolina border.

==Whitewater rafting==
Between Poplar, North Carolina, and Unaka Springs, Tennessee, the Nolichucky River Gorge provides one of the more scenic and technical whitewater trips in the Southern United States, due in large part to its constant (and often rapid) fluctuations. The naturally flowing Nolichucky River is a popular whitewater rafting and canoeing destination having stretches of both whitewater areas and calm water. Rainfall upstream around Mount Mitchell makes the upper section rapids ever more impressive with significant rain causing extremely big water and un-runnable routes in otherwise ordinary areas.
&quot;Frank Gentry describes such a trip through the gorge with Bob Lawson on a rubber raft. Frank says, &#x27;I just went along for the ride and a look at the scenery. Man-a-live, I didn&#x27;t have time to look at anything! When that raft hit those rapids at &quot;Rooster Tail&quot; we were going round and round, dived into &quot;Souse Hole&quot;, slammed into rocks here and more rocks there. Seemed like the harder you paddled the more rocks you&#x27;d hit. You&#x27;d just whirl and twirl and wham into more big boulders you hadn&#x27;t even seen. Sometimes that white-faced water would stand straight up and slam you smack-kadab all over the raft, or out of it. Man, that was a wild trip!&quot;
Inversely, a lack of adequate rainfall throughout the summer considerably increases the difficulty of navigating the pre-existing aspects of the rapids, which already tend towards being both technically difficult and challenging for rafters. These dry conditions and concomitant low water levels reveal a vast diversity of features. These hazards are ordinarily submerged during summers with normal seasonal rainfall patterns. Seasonal droughts can make rafting trips inadvisable or impassable, prompting local rafting companies in Unicoi County to sometimes divert whitewater river trips to the Watauga River running through Elizabethton, Tennessee in Carter County. The TVA regulates flow of the Watauga River and guarantees a minimum release schedule accommodating whitewater rafting companies during the summer season with the regular release of deep, impounded reservoir waters from behind both the Watauga Dam and the Wilbur Dam.

<doc id="897747" wikidata="Q6551534" url="?curid=897747" title="Linda Eastman">
<text>Linda Anne Eastman (July 7, 1867 – April 5, 1963) was an American librarian. She was selected by the American Library Association (ALA) as one of the 100 most important librarians of the 20th century.

Eastman served as the head Librarian of the Cleveland Public Library from 1918 to 1938 and president of the American Library Association from 1928 to 1929. At the time of her appointment in Cleveland, she was the first woman to head a library system the size of Cleveland&#x27;s. She was also a founding member and later president of the Ohio Library Association, and a professor of Library Science at Case Western Reserve University.

== Early life and career ==
Eastman was born in Oberlin, Ohio and moved to Cleveland at age 7. In her biography of her friend and mentor, William Howard Brett, Eastman wrote about an early interaction she had with him that would shape her career. Visiting the Cleveland library to acquire a book she needed for school, Eastman was told by an assistant that the book had been checked out and was unavailable. Brett, who was then head librarian, happened to pass by and overheard this exchange, and immediately offered to have someone go purchase another copy of the book for Eastman to check out. Following high school Eastman became a teacher, but soon decided to pursue library work instead.

Eastman started working at the Cleveland Public Library in 1892 as an apprentice, and in 1894 took charge of the West Side Branch Library, where she established &quot;The Open Shelf&quot;, a newsletter for library patrons highlighting new releases. Eastman left for a better position in the Dayton Library System in 1895 but returned quickly when Brett offered her the position of vice-Librarian. In that position, Eastman helped implement Brett&#x27;s revolutionary and highly successful open shelf system, whereby patrons could choose their own titles from library shelves rather than having to ask library staff to retrieve books from restricted stacks.

When Brett was killed in a car crash in 1918, the Cleveland Library Board appointed Eastman head librarian in a unanimous vote.

== Head librarian of Cleveland Public Library ==

=== New main library ===
One of Eastman&#x27;s major achievements as librarian was overseeing the construction and opening of Cleveland&#x27;s new main library.

Plans for the new library began in 1912, but political and financial questions (and World War I) delayed the beginning of construction until 1923, after a series of successful bond initiatives spearheaded by Eastman. The library opened to the public in May 1925 with a grand public event, featuring a main address by former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The new building was, at the time, the third largest library in the country, boasting six floors and a main reading room that could seat 200.

=== Special services ===
Eastman helped devise special centers that would serve patrons’ needs for specific sorts of information. The unique Travel Section was established in 1926 and featured not only travel pamphlets, but also &quot;selected volumes on the history, geography, and society of the major countries of the world.&quot; In 1928, the Eastman established the Business Information Bureau. This space served not only as a research facility for Cleveland&#x27;s businesspeople, but also as a vocational resource center.
In addition to creating special collections and services, Eastman took steps to extend the reach of the library, establishing in 1926 a service to distribute books to hospitalized readers.

=== Services for blind patrons ===
Eastman&#x27;s attempts to improve services for blind patrons began in 1903 when she instituted Braille classes as part of the Library&#x27;s offering. Her attempts to build the library&#x27;s Braille collection were frustrated by the high price of the books and the difficulty of transporting them, but by 1928 the Library had a collection of six thousand Braille texts. When Eastman retired, the special service was distributing books to thirty thousand blind patrons across northern Ohio. In addition to Braille texts, the Cleveland Library was trailblazing in its use of books recorded on phonograph, initially conceived as a solution for blind patrons who were unable to read Braille.

=== Great Depression ===
The Cleveland Library suffered financial cuts during the 1930s, even as public demand for library services soared. Wages were severely cut and funds for new books dried up. The financial situation got so bad that in 1932 a sign had to be placed in the new book section reading, &quot;No New Books for Display this Week Because of Curtailed Funds. Have You Read These Older Titles?&quot; Nonetheless, library patronage soared as unemployed and underemployed Clevelanders came to the library for a variety of purposes. Eastman told the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; that &quot;many of the unemployed patronizing the library call for reference works which will be of benefit to them in their vocation. They are also calling for books and magazines of general culture, finding that since they have a great deal of time and can now enjoy the books they never had time to read before.&quot; Eastman was forced to take extreme cost-cutting measures to keep the library open, aided by widespread public support of the library and appreciation of its services.

== Retirement and legacy ==
Eastman retired from the library in 1938 at age 71, citing a desire to spend more time outdoors. &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; summed up the library&#x27;s condition at the time of her retirement: &quot;She leaves the library the third largest in the United States, with 28 branches, 108 stations, 30 school libraries and ten county libraries administered under the system. Also with a million books on its shelves, a circulation of over eight million a year, and the good will of the entire population of Cleveland, each man, woman and child having been sold the idea that the Public Library is his own private library, to serve him according to his needs&quot;. 

Following Eastman&#x27;s retirement, both a branch library and a reading garden at the Main Library were named in her honor. 

In 1954 she was awarded American Library Association Honorary Membership. 

Eastman died in 1963 at age 95. She is buried at Riverside Cemetery in Cleveland, OH.

<text>Mount Lu or Lushan (, Gan: Lu-san) is a mountain situated in Jiujiang, China. It was also known as Kuanglu () in ancient times. The mountain and its immediate area are officially designated as the Lushan National Park, and it is one of the most renowned mountains in the country. Mount Lu is located primarily in Lushan City within Jiujiang, although its northern portions are found in Jiujiang&#x27;s Lianxi District. The oval-shaped mountains are about long and wide, and neighbors Jiujiang and the Yangtze River to the north, Nanchang to the south, and Poyang Lake to the east. Its highest point is Dahanyang Peak (), reaching above sea level. Dahayang Peak is also one of the hundreds of steep peaks that tower above the so-called sea of clouds that can encompass the mountain for almost 200 days each year.

Mount Lu is known for its grandeur, steepness, and beauty and is a prominent tourist attraction, especially during the summer months when the weather is cooler in the mountains than elsewhere. The mountain and the surrounding region is also one of the &quot;spiritual centers&quot; of China, containing many Buddhist and Daoist temples in addition to landmarks of Confucianism. Due to its striking beauty and sacred importance, Lushan National Park has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996. The overlapping Lushan Quaternary Glaciation National Geopark is a member of the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network.

==History==
Mount Lu contains important sites and temples for Daoism, (Mahayana) Buddhism, Confucianism, and even Christianity. Between AD 386 and 402 during the Jin dynasty, Huiyuan founded Pure Land Buddhism and Donglin Temple on the slopes of Mount Lu. During the Tang dynasty (618–907), Daoist temples were constructed nearby to house sacred scriptures. The White Deer Grotto Academy, founded in AD 940, was developed into a renowned center of academic research during the Song dynasty under the direction of Confucian scholar Zhu Xi. The academy was continually open until at least the 19th century. Other important medieval structures on the mountain include the grave of the famous Tang dynasty poet Tao Yuanming and imperial pavilions during the Ming dynasty.

The Song dynasty poet Su Shi famously described the difficulty of conveying the mountain&#x27;s beauty in his expression, &quot;Why can&#x27;t I tell the true shape of Lushan? Because I myself am in the mountain.&quot;

In later years, Kuling in Mount Lu became a summer resort for Western missionaries in China. Absalom Sydenstricker, the father of Pearl Buck, was one of the first five missionaries to acquire a property in the Kuling Estate on the mountain. The development of Kuling was instigated by the Reverend Edward Little and Dr. Edgerton H. Hart. The four principal founders of China&#x27;s Nurses Association and its first president, Caroline Maddock Hart, met in Kuling to form this association.

During the Long March, in early 1935, a battle took place in the area between the Chinese Red Army and nationalist forces, in which Hu Yaobang, later General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, was seriously injured.

Mount Lu was once dubbed the (, &quot;summer capital&quot;) of the Republic of China. Chiang Kai-shek, China&#x27;s leader at the time, would frequently spend his summers in the area. In June 1937, Zhou Enlai, then a major leader in the Chinese Communist Party, met with Chiang on the mountain to discuss a united front against the Japanese invasion. In July 1937, Chiang Kai-shek announced his intention for a full mobilization for war against Japan from Mount Lu. In 1946, following the war, the U.S. special diplomatic mission led by General George C. Marshall met with Chiang Kai-Shek to discuss the role of post-World War II China.

Mao Zedong convened three large conferences of senior party officials at Mount Lu, in 1959, 1961, and 1970. The 1959 conference became known as the Lushan Conference. The meeting saw the purge of decorated Chinese Civil War and Korean War general Peng Dehuai, who was critical of Mao&#x27;s Great Leap Forward policies. The 1970 Lushan Conference took place during the Cultural Revolution, and marked the increasing antagonism between those loyal to Mao and those loyal to his chosen successor Lin Biao.

In 1980 the famous movie &quot;Romance on Lushan Mountain&quot;, which was entirely shot on Mount Lu, was released to the public and won considerable positive reception. It was considered as the most progressive film since the founding of communist China, because there was a kissing scene in the movie, which was seen as public taboo in the pre-reform-and-opening-up China. It still holds the Guinness World Record for &quot;the longest first run of a film in one cinema&quot; for having been shown continuously since 1980 until today.

==Attractions and features==
Popular attractions on Mount Lu include the Immortal Caverns (), Meilu Outhouse (), Five Old Man Peaks (), White Deer Cavern Academy (), Three Tiled Springs (), Lulin Lake (), Lushan Hot Springs (), Lushan Botanical Garden (), Bamboo Temple (), Guanyin Bridge (), Peach Blossom Garden (), and the Catholic Church of Mount Lu ().

* The &quot;Lushan Botanical Garden&quot; features tens of thousands of plant species.
* Below the &quot;Five Old Men Peak&quot; is the &quot;White Deer Grotto Academy&quot;, named after the poet Li Bo () (not to be confused with the famous poet Li Bai), who raised white deer there. It is one of the most famous higher learning institutions in ancient China.
* West is the &quot;Flower Path&quot; which provided inspiration to Bai Juyi, a famous poet who lived during the Tang dynasty.
* Between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake lie the Greater and Lesser Tianchi Lakes, the Jingxiu Valley, and Lulin Lake. On the north bank of the latter is the &quot;Mount Lu Museum&quot;, which features pottery and bronzes dating from various periods of ancient China, as well as calligraphy from the Tang dynasty and paintings from the Ming and Qing dynasties.
* At the centre (between three peaks), and at an altitude of over 1 kilometer above sea level, is the town of Kuling, which is linked by a mountain highway to neighboring spots in the region.
* World-famous &#x27;Lushan clouds and mist tea&#x27; () is grown on the mountain.

<text>‘Bright Future’ was an innovation policy initiated by the National government in New Zealand in 1999. Originally called ‘Five Steps Ahead’, it was designed to identify the areas in which New Zealand innovation could be improved, including the tall poppy syndrome. It was overseen by the Ministry of Commerce, whose minister at the time was the Hon Max Bradford.

Amongst other initiatives, the Bright Future programme introduced a group of scholarships for talented students at graduate and post-graduate level.

The policy was dropped by the Fifth Labour Government.

<doc id="897774" wikidata="Q852365" url="?curid=897774" title="Tunisian campaign">
<text>The Tunisian campaign (also known as the battle of Tunisia) was a series of battles that took place in Tunisia during the North African campaign of the Second World War, between Axis and Allied forces from 17 November 1942 to 13 May 1943. The Allies consisted of British Imperial Forces, including a Greek contingent, with American and French corps. Despite initial successes by the German and Italian forces brought from the mainland and which had withdrawn into and occupied Tunisia after their defeat in the Western Desert and the success of Operation Torch, massive supply interdiction efforts and Allied assaults from east and west led to the decisive defeat of the Axis. Over 260,000 German and Italian troops were taken as prisoners of war, including most of the Afrika Korps.

==Background==

===Western Desert===
The first two years of the war in North Africa were characterized by chronic supply shortages and transport problems. The North African coast has few natural harbors and the British base at Alexandria on the Nile delta was some by road from the main Italian port at Tripoli in Libya. Smaller ports at Benghazi and Tobruk were and west of Alexandria on the Litoranea Balbo (Via Balbia) running along a narrow corridor along the coast. Control of the central Mediterranean was contested by the British and Italian navies, which were equally matched and exerted a reciprocal constraint supply through Alexandria, Tripoli, Benghazi and Tobruk, although the British could supply Egypt via the long route through the Atlantic around the Cape of Good Hope and by the Indian Ocean into the Red Sea.

The chronic difficulty in the supply of military forces in the desert led to several indecisive victories by both sides and long fruitless advances along the coast. The Italian invasion of Egypt by the 10th Army in 1940, advanced into Egypt and more than in a straight line from Tripoli, from Benghazi and from Tobruk. The Western Desert Force (WDF) fought a delaying action as it fell back to Mersa Matruh (Matruh), then began Operation Compass, a raid and counter-attack into Libya. The 10th Army was destroyed and the WDF occupied El Agheila, some from Alexandria. With the arrival of the German Afrika Korps, the Axis counter-attacked in Operation Sonnenblume and in April 1941 reached the limit of their supply capacity at the Egyptian border but failed to recapture Tobruk.

In November 1941 the British Eighth Army recovered, helped by the short supply distance from Alexandria to the front line and launched Operation Crusader, relieving the Siege of Tobruk and again reached El Agheila. The Eighth Army was soon pushed back to Gazala west of Tobruk and at the Battle of Gazala in May 1942, the Axis pushed them all the way back to El Alamein, only from Alexandria. In 1942, the Royal Navy and Italian Navy were still disputing the Mediterranean but the British hold on Malta, and intelligence from Ultra, allowed the Royal Air Force to sink more Italian supply ships. Large quantities of supplies became available to the British from the United States and the supply situation of the Eighth Army eventually resolved. With the Eighth Army no longer constrained, the Axis were driven westwards from Egypt following the Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942.

===Operation Torch===
In July 1942, the Allies discussed relatively small-scale amphibious operations to land in northern France during 1942 (Operation Sledgehammer, which was the forerunner of Operation Roundup, the main landings in 1943), but agreed that these operations were impractical and should be deferred. Instead it was agreed that landings would be made to secure the Vichy territories in North Africa (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia) and then to thrust east to take the Axis forces in the Western Desert in their rear. An Allied occupation of the whole of the North African coast would open the Mediterranean to Allied shipping, releasing the huge capacity required to maintain supplies around the circuitous route via the Cape of Good Hope. On 8 November, Operation Torch landed Allied forces in Algeria (at Oran and Algiers) and Morocco (at Casablanca) with the intention that once Vichy forces in Algeria had capitulated, an advance would be made to Tunis some to the east.

==Prelude==

===Allied plans===

Because of the nearness of Sicily to Tunisia, the Allies expected that the Axis would move to occupy the country as soon as they heard of the Torch landings. To forestall this, it would be necessary to occupy Tunisia as quickly as possible after the landings were made. However, there was a limit to how far east the Torch landings could be made because of the increasing proximity of Axis airfields in Sicily and Sardinia which at the end of October held 298 German and 574 Italian aircraft. Algiers was accordingly chosen for the most easterly landings. This would ensure the success of the initial landings in spite of uncertainty as to how the incumbent French forces would react. Once Algiers was secured, a small force, the Eastern Task Force, would be projected as quickly as possible into Tunisia in a race to occupy Tunis, some distant along poor roads in difficult terrain during the winter rainy season, before the Axis could organise.

However, planners had to assume the worst case regarding the extent of Vichy opposition at Algiers and the invasion convoys were assault-loaded with a preponderance of infantry to meet heavy ground opposition. This meant that at Algiers the disembarkation of mobile forces for an advance to Tunisia would necessarily be delayed. Plans were thus a compromise and the Allies realised that an attempt to reach Bizerte and Tunis overland before the Axis could establish themselves represented a gamble which depended on the ability of the navy and air force to delay the Axis build-up. The Allies, although they had provided for the possibility of strong Vichy opposition to their landings both in terms of infantry and air force allocations, seriously underestimated the Axis appetite for and speed of intervention in Tunisia.

Once operations had commenced, despite clear intelligence reports regarding the Axis reaction, the Allies were slow to respond. It was not until nearly two weeks after the landings that air and naval plans were made to interdict Axis sea transport to Tunis. At the end of November, naval Force K was reformed in Malta with three cruisers and four destroyers and Force Q formed in Bône with three cruisers and two destroyers. No Axis ships sailing to Tunis were sunk in November but the Allied naval forces had some success in early December sinking seven Axis transports. However, this came too late to affect the fighting on land because the armoured elements of 10th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division had already arrived. To counter the surface threat, Axis convoys were switched to daylight when they could be protected by air cover, simultaneously denying the Allies the advantage of using radar in night surface combat. Night convoys resumed on completion of the extension of Axis minefields which severely restricted the activities of Force K and Force Q.

===Tunisia===

Tunisia is said to be shaped like a pregnant woman, with its northern and much of its eastern boundary (the head and belly) on the Mediterranean coast. Most of the inland western border with Algeria (the back) is astride the eastern line of the Atlas Mountains which run from the Atlantic coast of Morocco, east to Tunis. This portion of the border is easily defensible at the small number of passes through the two north–south lines of the mountains. In the south a lower range of mountains limit the approaches to a narrow gap, facing Libya to the east, between the Matmata Hills and the coast. The French had earlier constructed a wide and deep series of defensive works known as the Mareth Line along the plain, to defend against an Italian invasion from Libya.

Only in the north was the terrain favourable to attack; here the Atlas Mountains stopped near the eastern coast, leaving a large area on the north-west coast unprotected. Defensive lines in the north could deal with approaching forces, while the Mareth Line made the south secure. In between, there were only a few easily defended passes through the Atlas Mountains. Tunisia has two big deep water ports at Tunis and Bizerte, only a few hundred miles from Italian supply bases in Sicily. Ships could deliver supplies at night, safe from RAF patrols and return the next night, while Libya was a full-day trip, making supply operations vulnerable to daylight air attacks. In Hitler&#x27;s view, Tunisia could be held indefinitely, upsetting Allied plans in Europe.

==Run for Tunis==
By 10 November, French opposition to the &quot;Torch&quot; landings had ceased, creating a military vacuum in Tunisia. The First Army (Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson) was immediately ordered to send the 36th Infantry Brigade Group, which had been the floating reserve for the Algiers landing, eastward by sea to occupy the Algerian ports of Bougie, Philippeville, and Bône and the airfield at Djedjelli, preliminary to advancing into Tunisia. The Combined Chiefs of Staff had decided that with the forces available, &quot;Torch&quot; would not include landings close to Tunisia. Anderson needed to get his limited force east quickly, before the Axis could reinforce Tunisia, but the Allies had only two brigade groups and some additional armour and artillery for the attack.

The French governor in Tunisia, Admiral Esteva, was afraid to support the Allies or oppose the Axis. He did not close airfields to either side; the Germans moved first and by 9 November, there were reports of 40 German aircraft arriving at Tunis and by 10 November, aerial reconnaissance reported 100 aircraft. Two days later, an airlift began that carried over 15,000 men and of supplies and ships brought 176 tanks, 131 artillery pieces, 1,152 vehicles and of supplies. By the end of the month, three German divisions, including the 10th Panzer Division, and two Italian infantry divisions had arrived. Walther Nehring took command of the new XC Corps on 12 November and arrived on 17 November. The French military commander in Tunisia, General Barré, moved troops into the western mountains of Tunisia and formed a defensive line from Tebersouk through Majaz al Bab (Medjez el Bab).

There were two roads eastwards into Tunisia from Algeria. The Allied plan was to advance along the two roads and take Bizerte and Tunis. On 11 November, the British 36th Infantry Brigade had landed unopposed at Bougie but supply shortages delayed their arrival at Djedjelli until 13 November. Bône airfield was occupied following a parachute drop by British 3rd Parachute Battalion and this was followed by No. 6 Commando seizing the port on 12 November. Advanced guards of the 36th Infantry Brigade reached Tebarka on 15 November and Djebel Abiod on 18 November, where they met Axis forces. Further south, on 15 November, a US parachute battalion made an unopposed drop at Youks-les-Bains, capturing the airfield and advanced to take the airfield at Gafsa on 17 November.

On 19 November Nehring demanded passage for his forces across the bridge at Medjez and was refused by Barré. The Germans attacked twice and were repulsed, but the French defensive success was costly, and lacking armour and artillery, the French had to withdraw. Some Vichy French forces, such as Barré&#x27;s, joined the Allies. But the attitude of Vichy forces remained uncertain until on 22 November, when the &quot;Darlan Deal&quot; placed French North Africa on the Allied side. This allowed US and British forces that had been securing Algeria to go to the front. By this time, the Axis had deployed a corps in Tunisia and outnumbered the Allies there in almost all ways.

Two Allied brigade groups advanced toward Djebel Abiod and Béja respectively. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, happy to have local air superiority while Allied planes had to fly from relatively distant bases in Algeria, harassed them all the way. On 17 November, the same day Nehring arrived, the leading elements of the British 36th Brigade on the northern road met a mixed force of 17 tanks and 400 paratroops with self-propelled guns at Djebel Abiod. The German paratroopers, with Luftwaffe and Italian fire support from the 1st Infantry Division &quot;Superga&quot;, knocked out 11 tanks but their advance was halted while the fight at Djebel Abiod continued for nine days. On 22 November, tanks from the Italian L Special Brigade forced US paratroopers to abandon Gafsa. The two Allied columns concentrated at Djebel Abiod and Béja, preparing for an assault on 24 November. The 36th Brigade was to advance from Djebel Abiod toward Mateur and 11th Brigade was to move down the valley of the River Merjerda to take Majaz al Bab (shown on Allied maps as Medjez el Bab or just &#x27;Medjez&#x27;) and then to Tebourba, Djedeida and Tunis. &quot;Blade Force&quot;, an armoured regimental group made up of 37 mm gun M3 Stuart light tanks and 75 mm M3 GMC self-propelled anti-tank guns, was to strike across country on minor roads in the gap between the two infantry brigades towards Sidi Nsir and make flanking attacks on Terbourba and Djedeida.
The northern attack did not take place because torrential rain had slowed the build-up. In the south 11th Brigade were halted by stiff resistance at Medjez. Blade Force passed through Sidi Nsir to reach the Chouigui Pass, north of Terbourba part of B Squadron Stuart&#x27;s from Blade Force infiltrated behind Axis lines to the newly activated airbase at Djedeida in the afternoon and destroyed more than 20 Axis planes but lacking infantry support, withdrew to Chouigui. The understrength tank Squadrons and three M3 GMC French 75s were to hold the pass. A mixed unit of Panzer III and Panzer IVs and a small Italian scouting Force, around 15 tanks all told. Frontal attacks by the GMCs and Stuarts were ineffective losing 12 tanks, but allowed a rear attack by B Squadron firing into the weaker rear armour of the German tanks. The German commander, believing he had encountered a much stronger force, retreated. Blade Force&#x27;s attack caught Nehring by surprise and he decided to withdraw from Medjez and strengthen Djedeida, only from Tunis. The 36th Brigade&#x27;s delayed attack began on 26 November but they were ambushed with the leading battalion taking 149 casualties. Further attacks were driven back from cleverly planned interlocking defences.
1 Commando landed west of Bizerte on 30 November to outflank the Jefna position, but failed and rejoined 36th Brigade by 3 December. The position remained in German hands until the last days of fighting in Tunisia the following spring.

Early on 26 November, as the Germans withdrew, 11 Brigade were able to enter Medjez unopposed and by late in the day had taken positions in and around Tebourba, which had also been evacuated by the Germans, preparatory to advancing on Djedeida. However, on 27 November the Germans attacked in strength. 11th Brigade tried to regain the initiative in the early hours of 28 November, attacking toward Djedeida airfield with the help of US armour, but failed. On 29 November, Combat Command B of US 1st Armored Division had concentrated forward for an attack in conjunction with Blade Force planned for 2 December. They were forestalled by an Axis counter-attack, led by Major-General Wolfgang Fischer, whose 10th Panzer Division had just arrived in Tunisia. By the evening of 2 December, Blade Force had been withdrawn, leaving 11th Brigade and Combat Command B to deal with the Axis attack. The attack threatened to cut off 11th Brigade and break through into the Allied rear, but desperate fighting over four days delayed the Axis advance and permitted a controlled withdrawal to the high ground on each side of the river west of Terbourba.

The Allied force initially withdrew roughly to the high positions of Longstop Hill (Djebel el Ahmera) and Bou Aoukaz on each side of the river. Concern over the vulnerability to flanking attacks prompted a further withdrawal west. By the end of 10 December, Allied units held a defensive line just east of Medjez el Bab. Here, they started a build up for another attack and were ready by late December 1942. The slow build up had brought Allied force levels up to a total of 54,000 British, 73,800 American and 7,000 French troops. A hasty intelligence review showed about 125,000 combat and 70,000 service troops, mostly Italian, in front of them. The main attack began the afternoon of 22 December. Despite rain and insufficient air cover, progress was made up the lower ridges of the Longstop Hill that controlled the river corridor from Medjez to Tebourba and thence to Tunis. After three days of to-and-fro fighting, with ammunition running low and Axis forces now holding adjacent high ground, the Longstop position became untenable and the Allies were forced to withdraw to Medjez, and by 26 December 1942 the Allies had withdrawn to the line they had set out from two weeks earlier, having suffered 20,743 casualties.

===Aftermath===

====French politics====

While the battles wound down, factionalism among the French again erupted. On 24 December, François Darlan was assassinated by an anti-Vichy French monarchist and Henri Giraud succeeded him as High Commissioner. To the frustration of the Free French, the US government had displayed considerable willingness to make a deal with Darlan and the Vichyists. Consequently, Darlan&#x27;s death appeared to present an opportunity to bring together the French in North Africa and Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French. De Gaulle and Giraud met in late January but little progress was made in reconciling their differences or the constituencies they represented. It was not until June 1943 that the French Committee of National Liberation (CFLN) was formed under the joint chairmanship of Giraud and de Gaulle. De Gaulle quickly eclipsed Giraud, who openly disliked political responsibility and more or less willingly from then on deferred to the Leader of the Free French.

====Command changes====
Nehring, considered by most to be an excellent commander, had continually infuriated his superiors with outspoken critiques. He was &quot;replaced&quot; when the command was renamed the 5th Panzer Army and Colonel-General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim arrived in Tunis unannounced on 8 December, to assume command. The Army consisted of the composite von Broich battlegroup in the Bizerte area, the 10th Panzer Division in the centre before Tunis and the 1st Infantry Division &quot;Superga&quot; on the southern flank, but Hitler had told Arnim that the army would grow to three mechanised and three motorised divisions. The Allies had tried to prevent the Axis build up with substantial air and sea forces but Tunis and Bizerte were only from the ports and airfields of western Sicily, from Palermo and from Naples, making it very difficult to intercept Axis transports which had the benefit of substantial air cover. From mid-November 1942 to January 1943, 243,000 men and of supplies and equipment arrived in Tunisia by sea and air.

General Eisenhower transferred further units from Morocco and Algeria eastward into Tunisia. In the north, the British First Army, over the next three months, received three more British divisions, the 1st, 4th, and 46th Infantry Divisions, joining the 6th Armoured and 78th Infantry Divisions. By late March the British IX Corps HQ (Lieutenant-General John Crocker) had arrived to join the British V Corps (Lieutenant-General Charles Allfrey) in commanding the expanded army. On their right flank, the basis of a two-division French XIX Corps (General Alphonse Juin) was assembling.

In the south was the US II Corps (Major General Lloyd Fredendall), consisting of the 1st and 34th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Armored Division (although the 34th Division was attached to the British IX Corps to the north). Giraud refused to have the French XIX Corps under the command of the British First Army and so they, along with the US II Corps, remained under command of Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ). New forward airfields were built to improve air support. The Americans also began bases in Algeria and Tunisia, to form a large forward base at Maknassy, on the eastern edge of the Atlas Mountains, well placed to cut off the &quot;Panzerarmee&quot; in the south from Tunis and the Fifth Panzer Army in the north.

==Kasserine==

===Prelude===
During the first half of January, Anderson had with mixed results kept constant pressure through limited attacks and reconnaissance in strength. Arnim did the same and on 18 January, launched Operation &quot; Eilbote I&quot; (&quot;Courier I&quot;). Elements of the 10th Panzer and 334th Infantry divisions attacked from Pont du Fahs to create more space in front of the Superga Division and forestall an Allied thrust east to the coast at Enfidaville, to cut Rommel&#x27;s line of communication. The westward thrust against the right wing of the British V Corps at Bou Arada had little success but further south his attack against French positions around the &quot;hinge&quot; of the Western and Eastern Dorsals succeeded, advancing south to Ousseltia and south-west to Robaa. The poorly equipped defenders resisted well but were overwhelmed and the equivalent of seven infantry battalions were cut off in the mountains. Anderson sent the 36th Brigade to Robaa and requested Lloyd Fredendall to send Combat Command B from 1st Armored Division to Ousseltia, to come under Juin&#x27;s orders on arrival. Fierce fighting lasted until 23 January but the front was stabilised.

The obvious lack of Allied co-ordination led Eisenhower to change the command structure. On 21 January Anderson was made responsible for the co-ordination of the whole front, and on 24 January his responsibilities were extended to include &quot;the employment of American troops&quot;. That night, Juin accepted the command of Anderson, confirmed by Giraud the next day but with forces spread over a front and poor communication (Anderson motored over in four days to speak to the corps commanders) the practical difficulties remained. Eisenhower appointed an air support commander, Brigadier General Laurence S. Kuter, for the whole front on 21 January.

Erwin Rommel had made plans for forces retreating through Libya to dig-in in front of the defunct French fortifications of the Mareth Line. The Axis forces would control the two natural entrances into Tunisia in the north and south, with only the easily defensible mountain passes between them. In January, those parts of the German-Italian Panzer Army on the Mareth defences were renamed First Italian Army (General Giovanni Messe), separate from the units (including the remains of the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot;) he had facing the Western Dorsale. On 23 January 1943, the Eighth Army took Tripoli, by which point the army retreating through Libya was already well on its way to the Mareth position. Part of the II US Corps crossed into Tunisia through passes in the Atlas Mountains from Algeria, controlling the interior of the triangle formed by the mountains. Their position raised the possibility of a thrust eastwards towards Sfax on the coast, to cut off the First Italian Army at Mareth from Arnim&#x27;s forces to the north around Tunis. Rommel could not allow this and formed a plan for a spoiling attack.

===Battle of Sidi Bou Zid===
On 30 January 1943, the German 21st Panzer and three Italian divisions from the 5th Panzer Army met elements of the French forces near Faïd, the main pass from the eastern arm of the mountains into the coastal plains. Fredendall did not respond to the French request to send reinforcements in the form of tanks from 1st Armored Division and after desperate resistance, the under-equipped French defenders were overrun. Several counterattacks were organised, including a belated attack by Combat Command B of the US 1st Armored Division but all of these were beaten off with ease by Arnim&#x27;s forces which by this time had created strong defensive positions. After three days, the Allied forces had been forced to pull back and were withdrawn into the interior plains to make a new forward defensive line at the small town of Sbeitla.

In Operation &quot;Frühlingswind&quot; (&quot;spring wind&quot;), Arnim ordered four armoured battle groups forward on 14 February in the area of Sidi Bou Zid held by 34th Infantry Division&#x27;s 168th Regimental Combat Team and 1st Armored Division&#x27;s Combat Command A. The defenders&#x27; dispositions were poor, with concentrations dispersed so that they were unable to be mutually supportive. By 15 February, CCA had been severely damaged leaving the infantry units isolated on hilltops. Combat Command C was ordered across country to relieve Sidi Bou Zid but were repelled with heavy losses. By the evening of 15 February, three of the Axis battlegroups were able to head toward Sbeitla, to the northwest. Pushing aside the remains of CCA and CCC, the battlegroups were confronted by Combat Command B in front of Sbeitla. With the help of air support, CCB held on through the day. However, the air support could not be sustained and the defenders of Sbeitla were obliged to withdraw and the town lay empty by midday on 17 February.

To the south, in Operation &quot;Morgenluft&quot; (&quot;morning air&quot;), an Italian First Army battlegroup made up of the remains of the Afrika Korps under Karl Bülowius had advanced toward Gafsa at dusk on 15 February to find the town deserted, part of a withdrawal to shorten the Allied front to facilitate a reorganisation involving the withdrawal of French XIX Corps in order to re-equip. II US Corps withdrew to the line of Dernaia-Kasserine-Gap-Sbiba with XIX Corps on their left flank vacating the Eastern Dorsal to conform with them. By the afternoon of 17 February, Rommel&#x27;s troops had occupied Feriana and Thelepte (roughly southwest of Kasserine) forcing the evacuation on the morning of 18 February of Thelepte airfield, the main air base in British First Army&#x27;s southern sector.

===Battle of Kasserine Pass===

General Vittorio Ambrosio, the new Chief of the &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; plans to send 10,000 German troops to Tunis , but the decision was never made due to the lack of Italian naval resources. Aside from Kesselring&#x27;s unfulfilled promises. Ambrosio knew that even with the German support, the Italian defence would be unable to sustain. 
After further discussion, the &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; issued orders on 19 February for Rommel to attack through the Kasserine and Sbiba passes toward Thala and Le Kef to threaten First Army&#x27;s flank. Rommel&#x27;s original proposal was for a limited but concentrated attack through Kasserine to confront II Corps&#x27; strength at Tébessa and gain vital supplies from the US dumps there. Although he was to have 10th and 21st Panzer Divisions transferred to his command, Rommel was concerned that the new plan would dilute his force concentration and expose his flanks to threat. 

On 19 February 1943, Rommel, having now been given formal control of the 10th and 21st Panzer Divisions, the Afrika Korps battlegroup as well as General Messe&#x27;s forces on the Mareth defences (renamed Italian First Army), launched what would become the Battle of Kasserine Pass. Hoping to take the inexperienced defenders by surprise, he sent the light armour of the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion racing into the pass. Colonel Alexander Stark&#x27;s &quot;Stark Force&quot;, a brigade group made up of US and French units, was responsible for the defence of the pass. It had not had time to organise properly but was able to direct heavy artillery fire from the surrounding heights which brought the leading mechanised units of the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; batlegroup to a halt. Before they could continue, infantry had to be sent up into the high ground seeking to eliminate the artillery threat. A battlegroup under Hans-Georg Hildebrand including tanks from 21st Panzer were advancing north from Sbeitla toward the Sbiba Gap. In front of the hills east of Sbiba they were brought to a halt by 1st Guards Brigade and 18th Regimental Combat Team which had strong field and anti-tank artillery support and were joined by two infantry regiments from 34th Infantry Division.

By the morning of 20 February, the bitter hand-to-hand fighting in the hills above Kasserine was continuing while the &quot;Afrika Korps Kampfgruppe&quot; and a battalion from the 131st Armoured Division &quot;Centauro&quot; and more artillery, prepared for another attack through the pass, once it had been joined by a 10th Panzer Division battle group from Sbeitla. The morning attack made slow progress but the intense pressure applied during the renewed attack that afternoon triggered a collapse in the Allied defences.

Having rolled through the Kasserine Pass on the afternoon of 20 February, units of the Centauro Division headed west toward Tébessa, meeting little or no resistance. Following them came the von Broich battlegroup from 10th Panzer, which forked right onto the road to Thala where they were slowed by a regimental armoured group from 26th Armoured Brigade (&quot;Gore Force&quot;). Their tanks outgunned, Gore Force sustained heavy losses but bought time for &quot;Nick Force&quot;, a composite force from British 6th Armoured Division with tanks from the 2nd Lothians and Border Horse of the 26th Armoured Brigade with extra infantry and artillery (which Anderson had ordered the previous day to leave the Kesra area to bolster the Thala defences) to prepare defensive positions further up the road. Meanwhile, Fredendall had sent 1st Armored Division&#x27;s CCB to meet the threat to Tébessa.

By 1pm on 21 February, Battlegroup von Broich was in contact with the dug-in tanks of B Squadron 2nd Lothians and Border Horse of the 26th Armoured Brigade on the Thala road and making slow progress. Rommel took direct control of the attack and forced the defences by 4pm. However, 26th Armoured Brigade were able to withdraw in reasonable order to the next, final, defensive line in front of Thala. Fighting at this position started at 7pm and continued at close quarters for three hours with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. &quot;Nick Force&quot; had taken a heavy beating and did not expect to be able to hold out the next day. However, during the night a further 48 artillery pieces from US 9th Infantry Division arrived after a trip from Morocco on poor roads and in bad weather. On the morning of 22 February, as Broich prepared to launch his attack, his front was hit by a devastating artillery barrage. Rommel told Broich to regroup and assume a defensive posture, so surrendering the initiative.

The 21st Panzer battlegroup at Sbiba was making no progress. Further south, the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; battlegroup on the road to Tébessa had been halted on 21 February by CCB&#x27;s armour and artillery dug in on the slopes of Djebel Hamra. An attempt to outflank them during the night of 21 February was a costly failure. A further attack early on 23 February was again beaten back. In a dispirited meeting on 22 February with Kesselring, Rommel argued that faced with stiffening defences and the news that the Eighth Army&#x27;s lead elements had finally reached Medenine, only a few kilometres from the Mareth Line, he should call off the attack and withdraw to support the Mareth defences, hoping that the Kasserine attack had caused enough damage to deter any offensive action from the west. Kesselring was keen for the offensive to continue but finally agreed that evening, and &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; formally terminated the operation. The Axis forces from Kasserine reached the Mareth line on 25 February.

===Aftermath===
Action then abated for a time and both sides studied the results of recent battles. Rommel remained convinced that US forces posed little threat, while the British and Commonwealth troops were his equal. He held this opinion for far too long, and it would prove very costly. The Americans likewise studied the battle and relieved several senior commanders while issuing several &quot;lessons learned&quot; publications to improve future performance. Most important, on 6 March 1943 command of the II US Corps passed from Fredendall to George S. Patton, with Omar Bradley as assistant Corps Commander. Commanders were reminded that large units should be kept concentrated to ensure mass on the battlefield, rather than widely dispersed as Fredendall had deployed them. This had the intended side effect of improving the fire control of the already-strong US artillery. Close air support had also been weak (although this had been hampered by the generally poor weather conditions).

At the Casablanca Conference, it had been decided to appoint General Sir Harold Alexander as Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces in French North Africa. This came into effect on 20 February and at the same time, in order better to co-ordinate the activities of his two armies in Tunisia, Eisenhower at AFHQ brought First and Eighth Armies under a new headquarters, 18th Army Group, which Alexander was to command. Shortly after taking up his new appointment, Alexander reported to London,

and was critical of Anderson although this was later felt to be a little unfair. Once he had been given control of the whole front at the end of January, Anderson&#x27;s aim had been to reorganise the front into consolidated national sectors and create reserves with which to regain the initiative, the same priorities articulated in Alexander&#x27;s orders dated 20 February. On 21 February, Alexander declared his objective to destroy all enemy forces in Tunisia by first advancing Eighth Army north of Gabès, while the First Army mounted attacks to draw off reserves which would otherwise be used against the Eighth Army. The armies would gain airfields for the Allied air forces. The co-ordinated land, sea and air power of the Allies would draw a net round the Axis forces in Tunisia by 30 April, to meet the timetable set at the Casablanca Conference to allow Sicily to be invaded during the favourable weather of August.
The Casablanca Conference had agreed to reorganise the air forces in the Mediterranean to integrate them more closely; Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder was made commander of Mediterranean Air Command, responsible for all Allied air activity in the Mediterranean and Major General Carl Spaatz became commander of the Northwest African Air Forces under Tedder, with responsibility for all air operations in Tunisia. By 23 February, Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham had succeeded Kuter at the Allied Air Support Command, which became Northwest African Tactical Air Force under Spaatz, with the Desert Air Force supporting Eighth Army, under its operational control.

Coningham found that the air organisation in Tunisia was that of the Western Desert in 1941 when he had first assumed command of the Desert Air Force. The lessons of the Desert Campaign had not been used in planning for Torch, which constrained the ability of the air arm, already short of aircraft and supplies, to provide tactical support to the army during the Run for Tunis. Coningham unified the British and American operational commands and trained them in new operational practices.

The Axis also created a combined command for their two armies. Hitler and the German General Staff (OKH) believed that Arnim should assume command but Kesselring argued for Rommel. Rommel was appointed to command the new Army Group Africa on 23 February.

==Southern front==

===Battle of Medenine===

The Eighth Army had been consolidating in front of the Mareth defences since 17 February, and launched probes westward on 26 February. On 6 March 1943, three German armoured divisions, two light divisions and nine Italian divisions launched Operation Capri, an attack southward in the direction of Medenine, the northernmost British strong point. The Axis attack was repulsed with massed artillery fire; 55 Axis tanks were knocked out. With the failure of Capri, Rommel decided that the only way to save the Axis armies would be to abandon the campaign, and on 9 March he travelled to Italy for discussions with &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; in Rome. Finding no support for his ideas, he travelled on 10 March to see Hitler at his headquarters in Ukraine, to try to convince him to abandon Tunisia and return the Axis armies to Europe. Hitler refused and Rommel was placed, in strict secrecy, on sick leave. Arnim became commander of Army Group Africa.

===Battle of the Mareth Line===
 
Montgomery launched Operation Pugilist against the Mareth Line on the night of 19/20 March 1943. XXX Corps of the Eighth Army commenced Operation &quot;Pugilist&quot; along with the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division. They penetrated the 136th Armoured Division &quot;Giovani Fascisti&quot;-held line and established a small bridgehead west of Zarat on 20/21 March. The terrain and rain however prevented the deployment of tanks, aircraft and anti-tank guns, which left the infantry isolated. A determined counter-attack by 15th Panzer Division and the Giovani Fascisti Division on 22 March, recaptured much of the bridgehead. XXX Corps prepared a new attack towards Tallouf, in which the 4th Indian Infantry Division (Major-General Francis Tuker) was to make a night attack on around the inland end of the line. This would coincide with the wide left hook manoeuvre Montgomery was planning with a new operation called &quot;Supercharge II&quot;.

On 26 March, X Corps (Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks) drove around the Matmata Hills, capturing the Tebaga Gap and the town of El Hamma at the northern extreme of the line in &quot;Operation Supercharge II&quot;, making the Mareth Line untenable. The following day anti-tank guns from German and Italian units checked the advance of X Corps, to gain time for a withdrawal. In the next 48 hours the Axis defenders pulled out of the Mareth Line, establishing a new defensive position to the north-west at Wadi Akarit near Gabès.

===Gabès===
The reorganised US II Corps advanced from the passes again and got behind the Axis lines; the 10th Panzer Division counter-attacked at the Battle of El Guettar on 23 March. The German tanks rolling up lead units of the US forces ran into a minefield, and US artillery and anti-tank units opened fire. The 10th Panzer Division rapidly lost 30 tanks and retreated out of the minefield. A second attack supported by infantry in the late afternoon was also repulsed, and the 10th Panzer Division retired to Gabès. The US II Corps was unable to exploit the German failure and each attack was stopped by the 10th Panzer Division or 21st Panzer Division counter-attacks up the road from Gabès; co-ordination of Allied air and ground forces remained unsatisfactory. The Eighth Army and the US II Corps attacked for the next week and on 28 March, the Eighth Army captured El Hamma, forcing the Axis to abandon Gabès and retreat north towards the Fifth Panzer Army. The hills in front of the US forces were abandoned, allowing them to join the British forces in Gabès later that day. The 2nd New Zealand Division and 1st Armoured Division pursued the Germans northwards into defensive positions in the hills west of Enfidaville, which were held until the end of the campaign.

==Northern sector==

On 26 February, Arnim, in the mistaken belief that the Kasserine battles had forced the Allies to weaken the north to reinforce the south, launched Operation &quot;Ochsenkopf&quot; (&quot;Ox Head&quot;) against V Corps, across a wide front and commanded by General Weber. The main attacks were by Corps Weber which had the 334th Infantry Division, newly arrived elements of the Hermann Göring Division and the part of the 10th Panzer Division not involved in Operation &quot;Frühlingswind&quot; (&quot;Spring Wind&quot;). Weber&#x27;s force was to advance in three groups: a central group moving west toward Medjez el Bab; a second to the north advancing south-west, on the route from Mateur to Béja (which was some west of Medjez) and the third group pushing west south of Medjez. The northern flank of Weber&#x27;s corps was to be protected by the Manteuffel Division advancing west (Operation &quot; Ausladung&quot;) and forcing the Allies out of their advanced positions opposite Green Hill and the Axis-held Jefna Station.

The aim of Operation &quot;Ausladung&quot; (&quot;Outward thrust&quot;) was to gain control of the vital town of Djebel Abiod. This attack by the Manteuffel Division made good progress across the French-held, lightly defended hills between Cap Serrat and the railway town of Sedjenane. Costly counter-attacks on February 27 and 2 March by part of the 139th Infantry Brigade, 46th Infantry Division, No. 1 Commando and supporting artillery delayed the Axis advance. Withdrawals of French battalions in the Medjez area to join XIX Corps, left little opposition to the German occupation of the high ground dominating the town, which was left in a dangerous salient. As a result, Sedjenane was abandoned by the British on 4 March and the 139th Infantry Brigade was pushed slowly back over the next three weeks some toward Djebel Abiod.

===Operation Ochsenkopf===
The main offensive, &quot;Ochsenkopf&quot; led to fierce fighting - &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; Lang attacking in the northern sector were held up by a small force of artillery and a battalion of the Hampshire Regiment for a whole day at Sidi Nsir and &quot;Hampshire Farm&quot; before they could be overcome. This delay was critical and as a result the British force was able to prepare a significant killing field at Hunts Gap (an area between Medjez and about north-east of Béja). In the Southern attack &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; Audorff made some progress west toward Medjez el Bab but a British ad hoc force, Y Division was able to repel the Southern attack; particularly after two Churchill tanks shot up an entire German transport column at a place called &#x27;Steamroller&#x27; Farm. The final attack by Lang&#x27;s battered force was stopped at Hunt&#x27;s Gap by the 128th Infantry Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division with substantial artillery, RAF air cover and two squadrons of Churchill tanks from the North Irish Horse under command.

Fighting lasted until 5 March and in terrible weather conditions the operation was called off by Arnim. The failure had cost the Axis grievous losses in infantry as well as tanks, particularly the loss of many of the heavy Tiger Tanks. Ochsenkopf was to be the last major Axis offensive by the 5th Panzer Army. On 25 March, Alexander ordered a counter-attack on the V Corps front and on 28 March, Anderson attacked with the 46th Infantry Division, with the 138th Infantry Brigade, 128th Infantry Brigade in reserve and reinforced by the 36th Infantry Brigade, 1st Parachute Brigade and French units including a tabor of specialist mountain Goumiers, the artillery of two divisions plus more from army resources. In four days, it succeeded in recapturing all lost ground and took 850 German and Italian prisoners. On 7 April, Anderson tasked the 78th Infantry Division with clearing the Béja-Medjez road. Supported by artillery and close air support, they methodically advanced through difficult mountain terrain over the next ten days, clearing a front wide. The 4th Infantry Division joined the fighting, taking position on the left of the 78th Division and pushing toward Sidi Nsir.

==Allied victory==

===Allied plans===

The salient at Medjez had been relieved and lateral roads in the V Corps area cleared so that Anderson was able to turn his full attention to the orders he had received on 12 April from Alexander to prepare the large-scale attack, scheduled for 22 April, to gain Tunis. By this stage, Allied aircraft had been moved forward to airfields in Tunisia to prevent the aerial supply of Axis troops in North Africa (Operation Flax) and large numbers of German transport aircraft were shot down between Sicily and Tunis. British destroyers operating from Malta prevented marine supply, reinforcement or evacuation of Tunisia by sea (Operation Retribution). Admiral Cunningham, Eisenhower&#x27;s Naval Task Force commander, issued Nelsonian orders to his ships: &quot;Sink, burn, capture, destroy. Let nothing pass&quot; but very few Axis ships even attempted passage. By 18 April, after attacks by Eighth Army from the south and flanking attacks by IX Corps and French XIX Corps, the Axis forces had been pushed into a defensive line on the north-east coast of Tunis, attempting to protect their supply lines but with little hope of continuing the battle for long.

Alexander planned that while II US Corps would attack on the north towards Bizerte, First Army would attack towards Tunis while Eighth Army attacked north from Enfidaville. Anderson would co-ordinate the actions of First Army and II US Corps, issuing the appropriate orders to achieve this. Anderson&#x27;s plan was for the main attack to be in the centre of the V Corps front at Medjez, confronting main Axis defences. However, IX Corps on the right would first attack north-east with, by speed of movement, the intention of getting in behind the Medjez position and disrupting their armoured reserves. II US Corps would make a double thrust: one to capture the high ground on V Corps&#x27; left flank and a second toward Bizerte. French XIX Corps would be held back until IX Corps and Eighth Army had drawn in the opposition and then advance toward Pont du Fahs.

===Battle===


The Allied forces had reorganised and during the night of 19/20 April, the Eighth Army captured Enfidaville against the Italian 16th Motorized Division &quot;Pistoia&quot;, which counter-attacked several times over the next three days and was repulsed and the action at Takrouna also took place. The northward advance of Eighth Army had &quot;pinched out&quot; US II Corps&#x27; eastward facing front line, allowing the corps to be withdrawn and switched to the northern end of the Allied front. Arnim knew that an Allied offensive was imminent and launched a spoiling attack on the night of 20/21 April, between Medjez and Goubellat on the IX Corps front. The Hermann Göring Division supported by tanks from 10th Panzer Division penetrated up to at some points but could not force a general withdrawal and eventually returned to their lines. No serious disruption was caused to Allied plans, except that the first attack of the offensive, by IX Corps, was delayed by four hours from 4:00 a.m. on 22 April.

On the morning of 22 April, the 46th Division attacked on the IX Corps front, creating a gap for the 6th Armoured Division to pass through by nightfall, followed by 1st Armoured Division, striking east for the next two days but not quick enough to forestall the creation of a strong anti-tank screen which halted their progress. The battle had drawn the Axis reserves of armour south, away from the central front. Seeing that no further progress was likely, Anderson withdrew the 6th Armoured Division and most of the 46th Infantry Division into army reserve. The V Corps attack began on the evening of 22 April and the US II Corps launched their offensive in the early hours of 23 April in the Battle of Hill 609, in which the hill was captured, which opened the way to Bizerte. In grim hand-to hand fighting against the Hermann Göring Division, 334th Infantry and 15th Panzer Divisions, it took V Corps with the 1st, 4th and 78th Infantry Divisions, supported by army tanks and heavy artillery concentrations, eight days to penetrate and capture most of the Axis defensive positions.

The fighting was mutually costly but in the Battle of Longstop Hill, Longstop was captured, which opened the way to Tunis and Anderson felt a breakthrough was imminent. On 30 April, after a failed attempt by the 169th Infantry Brigade of the recently arrived 56th (London) Infantry Division, which had just arrived over 3,300 miles from Syria, it had become clear to both Montgomery and Alexander that an Eighth Army attack north from Enfidaville, into strongly-held and difficult terrain, would not succeed. General Alexander gave Montgomery a holding task and transferred the British 7th Armoured Division, the 4th Indian Infantry Division and the 201st Guards Motor Brigade from the Eighth Army to the First Army, joining the British 1st Armoured Division which had been transferred before the main offensive.

The redeployments were complete by the night of 5 May; Anderson had arranged for a dummy concentration of tanks near Bou Arada on the IX Corps front, to deflect attention from the arrival of the 7th Armoured Division in the Medjez sector and achieved a considerable measure of surprise as to the size of the armoured force when the attack began. The final assault was launched at 3:30 a.m. on 6 May by IX Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks who had taken over from Lieutenant-General John Crocker, who had been wounded. V Corps, under Lieutenant-General Charles Walter Allfrey, had made a preliminary attack on 5 May, to capture high ground and secure the left flank of IX Corps. The 4th British and 4th Indian Divisions, concentrated on a narrow front and supported by heavy artillery concentrations, broke a hole in the defences for the 6th and 7th Armoured divisions to pass through. On 7 May, British armour entered Tunis and American infantry from II Corps, which had continued its advance in the north, entered Bizerte.

=== Axis surrender ===
Six days after the fall of Tunis and Bizerte, the last Axis resistance in Africa ended with the surrender of over 170,000 Germans and Italians who became prisoners of war (POWs). Major General Lucian Truscott, commander of the US 3rd Infantry Division and Major General Ernest N. Harmon, commander of the US 1st Armored Division, reported that German resistance in the American sector ceased on 6 May and German troops started surrendering en masse. On 8 May, the 334th Division surrendered to the British forces between Mateur and Tebourba. At 10:00 a.m. on 9 May, the US II Corps, under Major General Omar Bradley, cornered Major-General Gustav von Vaerst and what remained of the 5th Panzer Army, which surrendered before noon. At least 12,000 Germans surrendered in Major-General Fritz Krause&#x27;s sector (of the initial batch of 25,000 prisoners, fewer than 400 were Italian). Around 22,000 Germans in the mountainous Zaghouan sector also ceased fighting on 11 May and surrendered with their equipment to the Free French.

British and Commonwealth forces reported 150,000 Axis POWs taken in the German-held sector from 5 May – 12 June. Major-General Count Theodor von Sponeck, commander of the 90th Light Division, had surrendered unconditionally to the 2nd New Zealand Division, after threatening to fight till the last round. Arnim surrendered to the Royal Sussex Regiment. Messe, commander of the 1st Army, held the line north of Takrouna and on 12 May, cabled &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; vowing to fight on; at 7:55 p.m. that evening, after the German collapse, Mussolini ordered Messe to surrender. Next day, the 1st Army was still holding opposite Enfidaville but the remaining 80,000 men were surrounded; the RAF and artillery continued their bombardment and around noon, the 1st Army surrendered to the Eighth Army. Messe along with Kurt Freiherr von Liebenstein formally surrendered to British and New Zealand forces under General Bernard Freyberg.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
In 1966, the British Official Historian I. S. O. Playfair wrote that

In 1995 American historian Williamson Murray was more critical:
The Axis gamble failed, and at the cost of heavy losses in men and materiel had only slowed the inevitable. The Allied gains were considerable; control of the North African littoral, and the Mediterranean open to traffic. Even the US defeat at Kasserine may have been paradoxically advantageous; Rommel and the Axis were lulled into a false impression of US capabilities, while the Americans learned valuable lessons, and made positive changes in their command structure and tactics. With North Africa in Allied hands, plans quickly turned to the invasion of Sicily and Italy. Joseph Goebbels wrote that it was on the same scale as the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad; &quot;Tunisgrad&quot; was coined for the defeat. The historian Gerhard Schreiber writes that &quot;it seems no exaggeration to say that—in purely quantitative terms—Tunisia was a second Stalingrad for the invaders&quot;.

A Victory March was held in Tunis on May 20, 1943, in which units of the First and Eighth Armies and representative detachments of the American and French forces marched past, with bands playing and generals Eisenhower, Alexander and Giraud taking the salute.

===Casualties===
====Allied====
Allied casualties of 76,020 include the losses incurred by the First Army from 8 November 1942 and the Eighth Army from 9 February 1943. British and Commonwealth casualties amounted to 38,360 men; 6,233 were killed, 21,528 were wounded and 10,599 reported missing. The Free French suffered 19,439 casualties; 2,156 killed, 10,276 wounded and 7,007 missing. American casualties amounted to 18,221 men; 2,715 killed, 8,978 wounded and 6,528 missing.

From 22 to 30 November 1942, the RAF flew 1,710 sorties and lost at least 45 aircraft. The USAAF flew 180 sorties and lost at least 7 aeroplanes. From 1 to 12 December, the RAF flew 2,225 sorties and lost a minimum of 37 aircraft. The USAAF flew 523 sorties and lost another 17 aircraft. From 13 to 26 December, the RAF flew 1,940 sorties for a loss of at least 20 aeroplanes while the USAAF conducted 720 sorties for a loss of 16 aircraft. From 27 December 1942 to 17 January 1943 the RAF flew 3,160 sorties and lost 38 aircraft while the USAAF flew an estimated 3,200 sorties and lost 36 aeroplanes. From 18 January to 13 February the RAF flew 5,000 sorties, excluding those against shipping, for the loss of 34 aircraft while the USAAF flew an estimated 6,250 sorties for the loss of 85. During the remainder of February to 28 March, 156 allied planes were lost. Between 29 March and 21 April, 203 Allied aircraft were destroyed. From 22 April to the end of the campaign, 45 bombers and 110 fighters were lost; 12 bombers and 47 fighters of the RAF, the USAAF losing 32 bombers and 63 fighters, while the French lost 1 bomber.

====Axis====
The Axis armies suffered casualties of 170,000 to 180,000 men; the losses are uncertain but it is estimated that the German army suffered 8,500 men killed during the campaign and the Italians 3,700 men killed; another 40,000 to 50,000 Axis soldiers were wounded. In the British official history, Playfair wrote that the Allies took 238,243 unwounded prisoners; 101,784 German, 89,442 Italian and 47,017 others. In 2004, Rick Atkinson wrote that a quarter of a million prisoners is a reasonable estimate. Playfair wrote that G. F. Howe, the American official historian, recorded the capture of 275,000 Axis soldiers, an 18th Army Group calculation of 244,500 prisoners (including 157,000 Germans), that Rommel estimated 130,000 Germans were taken prisoner and Arnim estimated 100,000 German and 200,000 Italian prisoners of war. There seems to be a distinction between the entire campaign and the last few weeks when the majority of the Axis forces were captured.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; lost 2,422+ aircraft in the Mediterranean theatre from November 1942 – May 1943 (41 per cent of the ). At least 1,045 aircraft were destroyed; from 22 to 30 November 1942, the flew 1,084 sorties losing 63 aircraft, including 21 destroyed on the ground. The recorded the loss of four. From 1 to 12 December, the flew 1,000 sorties and lost 37 aircraft, including nine on the ground, while the Italians recorded the loss of ten more. From 13 to 26 December, the flew 1,030 sorties and lost 17 aircraft, while the Italians lost three. From 27 December 1942 to 17 January 1943, the lost 47 aeroplanes; losses are unknown. From 18 January to 13 February, the lost another 100 aircraft but Italian losses are unknown. From 14 February to 28 March, 136 German aeroplanes were lost and the lost 22 more. From 29 March to 21 April, 270 aeroplanes were destroyed and 46 &quot;operational aircraft and almost their entire remaining air transport fleet&quot; was lost. From 22 April until the end, the lost 273 aircraft; 42 bombers, 166 fighters, 52 transport aircraft, 13 observation aircraft and the Italians recorded the loss of 17 aeroplanes; 600+ aircraft were captured by the Allies.

<text>The Amazing Race 1 (originally broadcast under the name The Amazing Race) is the first season of the American reality competition series, &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. Hosted by Phil Keoghan, it featured eleven teams of two, each with a pre-existing relationship, competing in a race around the world to win US$1,000,000. This season visited four continents and nine countries and traveled over during thirteen legs. Starting in New York City, racers traveled through South Africa, Zambia, France, Tunisia, Italy, India, Thailand, and China before returning to the United States, traveling through Alaska, and finishing in New York City. The season debuted on CBS on September 5, 2001, and concluded on December 13, 2001.

Lawyers and best friends Rob Frisbee and Brennan Swain were the winners, while separated parents Frank and Margarita Mesa finished in second place, and life partners Joe Baldassare and Bill Bartek finished in third place.

==Production==
===Development and filming===

On September 13, 2000, CBS announced that it was set to produce a new reality show, which would feature eight teams of two traveling to eleven international locations to win US$1 million. By December 2000, the show was under the working title of &quot;CBS Summer Global Adventure Series&quot;. Location scouting for the racecourse took place in January 2001. Filming for the first season began in March 2001 by which time the show had been renamed to &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. The first season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; traveled in 39 days, spanning four continents and nine countries. The season was hit with multiple filming delays, including an airport strike in Rome and a sandstorm in Tunisia, the latter of which forced teams to begin sixth leg in Gabès rather than the original Saharan desert Pit Stop. Filming concluded on April 8, 2001, at Flushing Meadows Park. The top of the World Trade Center was considered as the finish location for the season but was changed to Flushing Meadows Park after production was unable to secure needed permits.

Multiple aspects of filming were unique to the first season of the series. Host Phil Keoghan handed out clues at the beginning of some legs and only greeted the last-place team at each Pit Stop; all other teams were greeted and informed of their placements by local representatives. This would be changed with Keoghan informing all of the teams of their placements while accompanied by the local greeter in subsequent seasons in order to increase his in involvement in the show and prevent him from appearing like a grim reaper. Each leg&#x27;s Pit Stop mat featured a localized design, while subsequent seasons have used a single design. The teams were also not required to read their clues out loud on camera; this was made compulsory for all teams in subsequent seasons.

&quot;The Amazing Race&quot; was designed so that the final three teams would all reach the finish line. However, Joe and Bill were so far behind that they could not catch up and did not finish the competition. They were still completing leg 12 in Alaska while Rob and Brennan, and Frank and Margarita, were crossing the finish line in New York City.

==Cast==
Eleven teams participated in the first season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;.
;Future appearances
Kevin and Drew made an appearance in &quot;The Amazing Race: Family Edition&quot;, handing out clues at a hot dog stand in New York City. Kevin and Drew, and Joe and Bill, returned for the first All-Stars season. Frank Mesa made an appearance at the starting line of season 25. Rob and Brennan made an appearance at the starting line of season 27.

==Results==
The following teams are listed with their placements at the end of each episode.
*A placement with a dagger () indicates that the team was eliminated. 
*An placement with a double-dagger () indicates that the team was the last to arrive at a Pit Stop in a non-elimination leg.

==Race summary==

===Leg 1 (United States → South Africa → Zambia)===

*Episode 1: &quot;The Race Begins&quot; (September 5, 2001)
*Eliminated: Matt and Ana
;Locations
*New York City, New York (Central Park – Bethesda Fountain) (Starting Line)

*Livingstone District (Batoka Gorge – Abseil Zambia) 
*Livingstone District (Songwe Village) 
;Episode summary
*Teams set off from Central Park in New York City with instructions to fly on one of three flights to Johannesburg, South Africa. Once there, teams were directed to the Lanseria Airport, where they had to book one of four charter flights to an unknown destination (Livingstone, Zambia). Once there, teams had to locate a vehicle outside of the airport with instructions to find &quot;the smoke that thunders,&quot; the local name for Victoria Falls. Teams could either drive themselves or hire a driver (who could not provide directions) to the falls, where they found their next clue.
* For the series&#x27; very first Fast Forward, one team had to hike down a canyon to the Boiling Pot on the Zambezi River. Rob and Brennan won the Fast Forward.
*Teams who did not attempt the Fast Forward had to travel to Abseil Zambia at Batoka Gorge, where they found their next clue.
* The series&#x27; very first Detour was a choice between Air or Land. In Air, teams had to ride a zipline across Batoka Gorge and then free-fall down on a gorge swing to their next clue. In Land, teams would have hiked down the rim of the gorge to their next clue. All teams chose Air.
*Teams had to check in at the Pit Stop: Songwe Village.
;Additional notes
* Near Songwe Village, there was a Roadblock that required one team member to cook an ostrich egg, which both team members had to eat, before they could check in at the Pit Stop. This task was unaired, but was shown as a bonus feature on the DVD.
*The gorge swing Detour at Batoka Gorge was revisited in season 27 as a Switchback in Zimbabwe.

* For this leg&#x27;s Fast Forward, one team had to whitewater raft down the Zambezi River. Pat and Brenda won the Fast Forward.
* This leg&#x27;s Detour was a choice between Near or Far. In Near, teams had to go to Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park away and photograph three hard-to-find animals from a list of five. In Far, teams would have had to go to Chobe National Park in Botswana away and photograph a single elephant. All teams chose Near.
*After the Detour, teams had to travel to Mukuni Village, where they took part in a traditional welcome ceremony for honored guests. Teams then gave the village chief the photographs they took during the Detour in exchange for their next clue: a miniature model of the Eiffel Tower. Teams returned by charter flight to Johannesburg, South Africa, where they had to book flights to Paris, France. Once there, teams had to find their next clue beneath the Eiffel Tower.
* In this leg&#x27;s Roadblock, one team member had to go by stairs to the second level of the Eiffel Tower and use a telescope to search the city&#x27;s skyline for a monument with a Route Marker on top: the Arc de Triomphe, which was the Pit Stop for this leg.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
Season 1 was not particularly a ratings success as the series premiered six days prior to the September 11 attacks, after which interest in foreign travel waned and viewership fell correspondingly. The show was further hindered by the lack of media coverage and promotion as networks focused on news stories and more patriotic programming. Additionally, the show premiered and competed in the same time slot as with NBC&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Lost&quot;, another travel reality game show with a similar premise. The show premiered with 11,800,000 viewers. By midseason, ratings had dropped with the sixth and seventh episodes pulling 8,370,000 and 9,170,000 viewers respectively. By the time of the finale, the show rebounded with 13,650,000 viewers. The show did just well enough to earn a second season, which aired the following spring.

===Critical response===
The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 92%, based on 13 reviews as of August 2023. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Amazing Race&quot; elevates reality television conventions with its globetrotting scale, making for a suspenseful competition and fascinating travelogue.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 72 out of 100 based on 24 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Following the season&#x27;s premiere, Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;[&quot;The Amazing Race&quot;] brings new energy and respectability to the &#x27;reality&#x27; genre popularized by the same network&#x27;s &quot;Survivor&quot; -- and surpasses it in spectacle and human drama. Great TV lives.&quot; Michael Speier of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;Television gets back to real reality via &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. With this thrilling trip around the world, CBS blows away the Summer of Rats — thank you &quot;Fear Factor&quot; — while creating a terrific companion piece to the net&#x27;s comparatively tranquil &quot;Survivor&quot;. Linda Stasi of the &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote &quot;I never thought I&#x27;d love a reality show, because mostly I hated all those shows with their wannabe models, fat yutzes and half-wits who try to be as smart as the fat yutz from &quot;Survivor&quot; but are dumber than a family tree of Bushes. But this one actually is so good I am already addicted.&quot; Hal Boedeker of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; wrote &quot;Classier than &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, clearer than &quot;The Mole&quot; and swifter than &quot;Survivor&quot;, CBS&#x27; &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; jolts the reality format with tantalizing thrills. Rob Owen of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; wrote &quot;An exhilarating, fast-paced competition filled with colorful characters, &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; is a pulse-pounding good time.&quot; Ed Bark of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; wrote &quot;It all makes for a watchable feast of accidental tourists navigating various twists, turns and blind alleys. &quot;Amazing Race&quot; seems to be well-cast with vivid characters.&quot;

Conversely, following the show&#x27;s premiere, Terry Kelleher of &quot;People&quot; called it a &quot;half-decent start&quot;. Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that while the show may be less mean-spirited than previous reality show, it &quot;may not be what viewers who love reality shows want to see.&quot; Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it had &quot;all the interest and awareness of an air-conditioned tour bus roaring by Nantucket.&quot;

Following the season&#x27;s conclusion, Linda Holmes of &quot;Television Without Pity&quot; wrote that she &quot;was flat-out hooked for thirteen weeks, and the ending managed not to disappoint, which almost never happens.&quot; Matt Roush of &quot;TV Guide&quot; called this season &quot;TV&#x27;s best reality show&quot;. Allan Johnson of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called the first season &quot;a satisfying race around the world&quot;. Dalton Ross of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;[2001&#x27;s] most exciting reality adventure. The fast-paced editing, breathtaking scenery, and almost perfect casting made for truly pulse-racing programming.&quot; In 2015, Joe Reid of Decider wrote, &quot;It really is a remarkably well-structured, well-edited, well-conceived, and well-cast season of reality television. This show made its reputation for a reason.&quot; In 2016, this season was ranked 5th out of the first 27 seasons by the &quot;Rob Has a Podcast Amazing Race&quot; correspondents. Kareem Gantt of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; wrote that this season &quot;had a great cast, truly awesome locations, and challenges that kept the viewer on the edge&quot;. In 2021, Jane Andrews of Gossip Cop ranked this season as the fourth best. In 2022, Jason Shomer of Collider ranked this season among the show&#x27;s top seven seasons. In 2022, Rhenn Taguiam of Game Rant ranked this season as the overall best season. In 2024, Taguiam&#x27;s ranking was updated with this season remaining as the overall best season.

<text>In the engineering field of robotics, an arm solution is a set of calculations that allow the real-time computation of the control commands needed to place the end of a robotic arm at a desired position and orientation in space.

A typical industrial robot is built with fixed length segments that are connected either at joints whose angles can be controlled, or along linear slides whose length can be controlled. If each angle and slide distance is known, the position and orientation of the end of the robot arm relative to its base can be computed efficiently with simple trigonometry. 

Going the other way — calculating the angles and slides needed to achieve a desired position and orientation — is much harder. The mathematical procedure for doing this is called an arm solution. For some robot designs, such as the Stanford arm, Vicarm SCARA robot or cartesian coordinate robots, this can be done in closed form. Other robot designs require an iterative solution, which requires more computer resources.

<text>The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is an American private nonprofit research organization &quot;committed to undertaking and disseminating unbiased economic research among public policymakers, business professionals, and the academic community.&quot; The NBER is known for proposing start and end dates for recessions in the United States.

Many chairpersons of the Council of Economic Advisers were previously NBER research associates, including the former NBER president and Harvard professor Martin Feldstein. The NBER&#x27;s current president and CEO is James M. Poterba of MIT.

==History== 
===Founding===
The NBER was established in 1920 due to debates during the Progressive era over income distribution. Founded by Malcolm Rorty and Nachum Stone, the NBER aimed to fill the information gap on economic data. The organization&#x27;s research is restricted to presenting data and findings without making policy recommendations.

===Early years===
The NBER initially received support from the Carnegie Foundation, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Foundation, and various corporations. Columbia University professor Wesley Clair Mitchell was the first director of research, guiding the organization&#x27;s research for 25 years. The NBER&#x27;s initial projects included measuring labor&#x27;s share of national income and studying unemployment and business-cycle fluctuations.

===Simon Kuznets===
In 1927, Mitchell brought in Simon Kuznets, who later played a pivotal role in developing the US national income accounts. Kuznets&#x27; work laid the foundation for the Nobel Prize he received in 1971.

===Post-War expansion===
After World War II, the NBER expanded its research scope. Arthur Burns succeeded Mitchell as research director. The 1950s and 1960s saw groundbreaking work by Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz on monetary policy&#x27;s impact on business cycles. Research in labor economics also flourished during this period.

===Presidential leadership===
Arthur Burns became NBER&#x27;s president in 1956, followed by John R. Meyer in 1967. Meyer introduced several initiatives, including two NBER journals and the establishment of NBER offices in various cities.

===Martin Feldstein era===
In 1977, Martin S. Feldstein became the NBER&#x27;s president, transforming the organization. He expanded the NBER&#x27;s network of university-based affiliates, moved its headquarters to Cambridge, and introduced the NBER Working Paper Series. Feldstein also established research programs focusing on specific areas and initiated the NBER Summer Institute.

===Recent years===
James Poterba succeeded Feldstein in 2008, continuing the NBER&#x27;s expansion. The number of affiliated researchers grew significantly, and new programs and working groups were introduced. The NBER now distributes over 1,200 new research studies annually and holds around 125 meetings each year on various economic topics.

==Research==
The NBER&#x27;s research activities are mostly identified by 20 research programs on different subjects and 14 working groups.

==Funding==
According to the NBER, they are funded by grants from government agencies, private foundations, by corporate and individual contributions, and by income from the NBER&#x27;s investment portfolio. The largest donators currently are the National Institute of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Social Security Administration, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

==Policy impact==
In a 2010 report by the University of Pennsylvania, the NBER was ranked as the second most influential domestic economic policy think tank (the first was the Brookings Institution).

==Recession markers==
The NBER is also known for its start and end dates of US recessions. The NBER is claimed by some to serve the role as an arbiter of whether the U.S. is in a recession or not. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) does not function as a real-time arbiter in determining the onset and duration of recessions but rather serves as a retrospective marker. The origins of this role can be traced to the 1960s when the Commerce Department began publishing a digest that relied on NBER&#x27;s analysis of the business cycle. The recession markers are made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, whose eight members are selected by the president of the NBER. The eight members tend to be highly distinguished economists. The NBER&#x27;s Business Cycle Dating Committee, responsible for officially dating recessions, does not make real-time judgments or predict economic downturns. The committee&#x27;s meetings are held on the third floor of NBER&#x27;s headquarters. The meetings are neither publicized nor on a fixed schedule. The board&#x27;s decisions are not always unanimous, but the disagreements within the committee tend not to be about the presence of a recession; rather they are about the specific start and end points of the recession.

The NBER uses a broader definition of a recession than commonly appears in the media. A definition of a recession commonly used in the media is two consecutive quarters of a shrinking gross domestic product (GDP). In contrast, the NBER defines a recession as &quot;a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales&quot;. Business cycle dates are determined by the NBER dating committee. Typically, these dates correspond to peaks and troughs in real GDP, although not always so.

The NBER prefers this method for a variety of reasons. First, they feel by measuring a wide range of economic factors, rather than just GDP, a more accurate assessment of the health of an economy can be gained. For instance, the NBER considers not only the product-side estimates like GDP, but also income-side estimates such as the gross domestic income (GDI). Second, since the NBER wishes to measure the duration of economic expansion and recession at a fine grain, they place emphasis on monthly—rather than quarterly—economic indicators. Finally, by using a looser definition, they can take into account the depth of decline in economic activity. For example, the NBER may declare not a recession simply because of two quarters of very slight negative growth, but rather an economic stagnation. However, they do not precisely define what is meant by &quot;a significant decline&quot;, but rather determine if one has existed on a case by case basis after examining their catalogued factors which have no defined grade scale or weighting factors. The subjectivity of the determination has led to criticism and accusations committee members can &quot;play politics&quot; in their determinations.

Though not listed by the NBER, another factor in favor of this alternate definition is that a long-term economic contraction may not always have two consecutive quarters of negative growth, as was the case in the recession following the bursting of the dot-com bubble.

==Announcement of end of 2007–2009 recession==
In September 2010, after a conference call with its Business Cycle Dating Committee, the NBER declared that the Great Recession in the United States had officially ended in 2009 and lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. In response, a number of newspapers wrote that the majority of Americans did not believe the recession was over, mainly because they were still struggling and because the country still faced high unemployment. However, the NBER release had noted that &quot;In determining that a trough occurred in June 2009, the committee did not conclude that economic conditions since that month have been favorable or that the economy has returned to operating at normal capacity. Rather, the committee determined only that the recession ended and a recovery began in that month. A recession is a period of falling economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. The trough marks the end of the declining phase and the start of the rising phase of the business cycle.&quot;

== Archbishop of Turku and Finland 1982–1998 ==
As the 53rd successor of St. Henry, Vikström&#x27;s era was far reaching. During his term as the Archbishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, the Church carried out many reforms. The Church was given a new Bible translation and a new hymnbook, the ordained ministry has been opened to women, church law was reformed and liturgical reform was undertaken. The Church of Finland was also active ecumenically.

Archbishop emeritus John Vikström continues to be a popular speaker in academia and business.

John Vikström has also publicly embraced the idea of a basic income as a solution to social exclusion:

The archbishop has placed the chairmanship of the Church&#x27;s Social-Ethical Forum as his priority. The forum&#x27;s aim is to resolve problems in the status of the elderly and poor in Finland.

An acclaimed author of numerous books and papers, his correspondence with Jörn Donner was voted as Book of the Year in 2002.

<text>John Blair Balfour, 1st Baron Kinross (born 11 July 1837 – 22 January 1905) was a Scottish lawyer and Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1880 to 1899.

==Early life==
Balfour was born in the manse at Clackmannan, the son of Rev. Peter Balfour (&quot;Perpendicular Peter&quot;), minister of Clackmannan and his wife Jane Ramsay Blair, daughter of John Blair.

At the 1880 general election, Balfour stood unsuccessfully for parliament at Ayrshire North but in a by election six months later was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Clackmannan and Kinross.

He was appointed Solicitor General for Scotland in 1880 and in 1881 he succeeded this appointment by becoming Lord Advocate, a post he held for four years. In 1882 he became a Privy Counsellor. He served as the elected Dean of the Faculty of Advocates twice: from 1885 to 1886, and from 1889 to 1892.

After the death of his first wife, he married secondly the Hon. Marianne Eliza Moncrieff in 1877. Marianne was a daughter of James Moncreiff, 1st Baron Moncreiff. Together, they were the parents of five children, four sons and one daughter, including:

* Hon. James Moncreiffe Balfour (1878–1960), who married Madeline Maude Graham Watson, daughter of James Graham Watson (brother-in-law of Sir Robert Tuite Boothby), in 1908.

<text>Fotbal Club Politehnica Iași (), commonly known as Politehnica Iași or simply Poli Iași, was a Romanian football club from the city of Iași, Iași County.

Named after the Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iași, the team was founded in 1945. Its home stadium was the Stadionul Emil Alexandrescu, where it played in blue and white until being dissolved in 2010. In the same year, a successor club was formed under the name of ACSMU Politehnica Iași and currently competes in the first division.

==History==
The club was established as &quot;Sportul Studențesc Iași&quot; by a group of students on 27 April 1945, and first received the name of Politehnica one month later (&quot;Asociația Sportivă Politehnica Iași&quot;). It alternated between Romania&#x27;s second and first leagues. They played in the Liga I for 28 seasons during the periods: 1960–61, 1962–1967 (under the name &quot;CSMS Iași&quot;), 1968–1972, 1973–1981, 1982–1990, 1995–96, and 2004–2010.

===Recent history===
2004–05 season

Politehnica started the 2004–05 season by winning only two points in eight rounds. After manager Vasile Simionaș was replaced with Ionuț Popa, Politehnica won the following fixture away against Steaua București, Adrian Cristea scoring the only goal of the match. The team gradually lifted itself from the bottom of the table, finally finishing 9th with 38 points.

In the Romanian Cup they were eliminated in the first round (sixteen-finals) by UTA Arad with 1–0.

2005–06 season

The 2005–06 season was a relatively good one for the Iași-based team, whose objective was to avoid relegation. They narrowly lost both matches against the future champions Steaua and the away match with runners-up Rapid București, all with the score of 1–0, after three penalty kicks. They also lost 2–0 against Dinamo București at home. However, they drew away against a weakened Dinamo team, after a second-half goal by Daniel Rednic. Politehnica Iași eventually finished 10th with 39 points.

In the Romanian Cup they reached the quarter-finals, eliminating Unirea Dej (2–0) and FC Vaslui (2–1 AET) in the progress. They were eliminated by Rapid after a last-minute goal and after the referee disallowed a controversial goal scored in the second half by Politehnica.

During the season Politehnica experienced major financial problems, which resulted in the impossibility to buy better players for the team and difficulties encountered in receiving the club license necessary for playing in the 2006/07 season in Liga I. The license was finally obtained after the efforts made by chairman and mayor of Iași Gheorghe Nichita.

2006–07 season

Politehnica Iași started the season with the same financial problems, resulting in only four players joining the team in the pre-season break and many salaries and debts paid late. In addition, the conflict between Gheorghe Nichita and Iași prefect Radu Prisăcaru concerning public funding of the club and interference by the press spiced up the atmosphere. Despite all odds, Politehnica kept itself between the top six teams after the first 12 matches and was unbeaten for eight consecutive matches (seven in Liga I and one cup match), drawing at home with Steaua (1–1), Rapid and FCU Politehnica Timișoara (0–0). A negative run followed with one point in seven league matches and was followed by a 4–0 away victory against local rivals Ceahlăul Piatra Neamț. Politehnica finally finished 13th with 40 points.

The team qualified for the second time in a row in the quarter-finals of the Romanian Cup, disposing of Universitatea Cluj (2–1) and Farul Constanța (1–0), however, they were eliminated by Poli Timișoara, score 1–2.

2009–10 season

The club relegated from the Liga I at the end of the season.

===Dissolution===
After it relegated in 2010, the club became bankrupt because of debts that were accumulated during the years.

The football tradition in Iași has been continued by Politehnica Iași (2010), which regard themselves as the continuation of the original team. In 2018, they earned the right to use the logo and name of FC Politehnica.

<doc id="897787" wikidata="Q3268064" url="?curid=897787" title="Cartesian coordinate robot">
<text>A Cartesian coordinate robot (also called linear robot) is an industrial robot whose three principal axes of control are linear (i.e. they move in a straight line rather than rotate) and are at right angles to each other. The three sliding joints correspond to moving the wrist up-down, in-out, back-forth. Among other advantages, this mechanical arrangement simplifies the robot control arm solution. It has high reliability and precision when operating in three-dimensional space. As a robot coordinate system, it is also effective for horizontal travel and for stacking bins.

== Configurations ==
Robots have mechanisms consisting of rigid links connected together by joints with either linear (prismatic &quot;P&quot;) or rotary (revolute &quot;R&quot;) motion, or combinations of the two.  Active prismatic &quot;P&quot; and active revolute &quot;R&quot; joints are driven by motors under programmable control to manipulate objects to perform complex automated tasks. The linear motion of active prismatic &quot;P&quot; joints may be driven by rotary motors through gears or pulleys. Cartesian coordinate robots are controlled by mutually perpendicular active prismatic &quot;P&quot; joints that are aligned with the &quot;X, Y, Z&quot; axes of a Cartesian coordinate system.  Although not strictly ‘robots’, other types of manipulators, such as computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines, 3D printers or pen plotters, also have the same mechanical arrangement of mutually perpendicular active prismatic &quot;P&quot; joints.

=== Joint topology ===
A single chain of links and joints connects a moving object to a base of serial manipulators. Multiple chains (limbs) connect the moving object to the base of parallel manipulators.  Most Cartesian coordinate robots are fully serial or a combination of serial and parallel connected linkages.  However, there are some Cartesian coordinate robots that are fully parallel-connected.

=== Degrees of freedom ===
Since they are driven by linear active prismatic &quot;P&quot; joints, Cartesian coordinate robots typically manipulate objects with only linear translation &quot;T&quot; degrees of freedom.  However, some Cartesian coordinate robots also have rotational &quot;R&quot; degrees of freedom.

=== Construction ===
Each axis of a Cartesian coordinate robot typically is a linear stage consisting of a linear actuator geometrically parallel with linear bearings. The linear actuator is typically between two linear bearings spaced apart from each other to support moment loads.  Two perpendicular linear stages stacked on top of each other form a XY table.  Examples of XY tables include the XY axes of milling machines or precision positioning stages. At least one of the linear stages of cantilevered Cartesian coordinate robots is supported at only one end. Cantilevered construction provides accessibility to parts for pick-and-place applications such as laboratory automation for example. Cartesian coordinate robots with the horizontal member supported at both ends are sometimes called gantry robots; mechanically, they resemble gantry cranes, although the latter are not generally robots. Gantry robots are often quite large and may support heavy loads.

==Applications==
Popular applications for Cartesian coordinate robots are computer numerical control machines (CNC machine) and 3D printing. The simplest application is used in milling machines and plotters where a tool such as a router or pen translates across an &quot;X-Y&quot; plane and is raised and lowered onto a surface to create a precise design.

Pick and place machines are another application for Cartesian coordinate robots.  For example, overhead gantry Cartesian robots are applied for continuous parts loading and unloading on CNC lathes production lines, performing 3-axis &quot;(X, Y, Z)&quot; pick and place operations of heavy loads with high speed performance and high positioning accuracy.  In general, overhead gantry Cartesian robots are suitable for many automation systems.

<doc id="897793" wikidata="Q3027727" url="?curid=897793" title="New Worlds (magazine)">
<text>New Worlds was a British science fiction magazine that began in 1936 as a fanzine called &quot;Novae Terrae&quot;. John Carnell, who became &quot;Novae Terrae&quot;″s editor in 1939, renamed it &quot;New Worlds&quot; that year. He was instrumental in turning it into a professional publication in 1946 and was the first editor of the new incarnation. It became the leading UK science fiction magazine; the period to 1960 has been described by science fiction historian Mike Ashley as the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot;.

Carnell joined the British Army in 1940 following the outbreak of the Second World War and returned to civilian life in 1946. He negotiated a publishing agreement for the magazine with Pendulum Publications, but only three issues of &quot;New Worlds&quot; were produced before Pendulum&#x27;s bankruptcy in late 1947. A group of science fiction fans formed a company called Nova Publications to revive the magazine; the first issue under their management appeared in mid-1949. &quot;New Worlds&quot; continued to appear on a regular basis until issue 20, published in early 1953, following which a change of printers led to a hiatus in publication. In early 1954, when Maclaren &amp; Sons acquired control of Nova Publications, the magazine returned to a stable monthly schedule.

Roberts &amp; Vinter acquired &quot;New Worlds&quot; in 1964 when Michael Moorcock became editor. By the end of 1966, financial problems with their distributor led Roberts &amp; Vinter to abandon &quot;New Worlds&quot;, but with the aid of an Arts Council grant obtained by Brian Aldiss, Moorcock was able to publish the magazine independently. He featured experimental and &quot;avant-garde&quot; material, and &quot;New Worlds&quot; became the focus of the &quot;New Wave&quot; of science fiction. Reaction among the science fiction community was mixed, with partisans and opponents of the New Wave debating the merits of &quot;New Worlds&quot; in the columns of fanzines such as &quot;Zenith-Speculation&quot;. Several of the regular contributors during this period, including Brian Aldiss, J. G. Ballard, Thomas M. Disch, and Moorcock himself, became major names in the field. By 1970, Moorcock was too in debt to continue with the magazine, and it became a paperback quarterly after issue 201. The title has been revived multiple times with Moorcock&#x27;s direct involvement or approval; by 2021, 22 additional issues had appeared in various formats, including several anthologies.

==Publishing history==

===Early years===
In 1926, Hugo Gernsback launched &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, the first science fiction (sf) magazine. It was soon followed by other US titles also specialising in sf, such as &quot;Astounding Stories&quot; and &quot;Wonder Stories&quot;. These were distributed in the UK, and British fan organisations began to appear. In 1936, Maurice K. Hanson, a science fiction fan living in Nuneaton, founded a fanzine called &quot;Novae Terrae&quot; (Latin for &quot;new lands&quot; or &quot;new worlds&quot;) for the local branch of the Science Fiction League. Hanson moved to London and his fanzine became the official publication of the Science Fiction Association, founded in 1937.

Arthur C. Clarke, John Carnell and William F. Temple became involved in &quot;Novae Terrae&quot;″s production. In 1939 Hanson gave up the editorship to Carnell, who retitled the fanzine &quot;New Worlds&quot; and restarted the numbering at volume 1 number 1; the first issue under Carnell&#x27;s control was dated March 1939. Carnell wanted to turn &quot;New Worlds&quot; into a professional magazine, and through W.J. Passingham, a writer, had begun discussions with a publisher named The Worlds Says Ltd. In January 1940 Carnell was asked to put together three issues, and Carnell and Passingham each put up £50 towards costs. Carnell solicited material from British authors including John F. Burke, C.S. Youd, and David McIlwain, and acquired Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Lost Legion&quot;, but in March internal strife led to the collapse of The World Says. Alfred Greig, the director, returned to his native Canada without repaying Carnell and Passingham, and no issues were ever printed.

Carnell joined the army in 1940, serving with the Royal Artillery, Combined Operations, and Naval Bombardment. After his return to civilian life in January 1946 he met writer Frank Edward Arnold, who had been working with Pendulum Publications on a new science fiction line. Arnold introduced Carnell to Stephen D. Frances, Pendulum&#x27;s director. Frances believed in the commercial possibilities of science fiction, and since Carnell still had the portfolio of stories he had put together in 1940, Pendulum agreed to make &quot;New Worlds&quot; into a professional magazine. The first issue appeared in July 1946, although there was no date on the magazine. The initial print run was 15,000, but only 3,000 copies were sold—a very disappointing return.

Carnell felt that the cover artwork, which he considered to be weak, was partly responsible for the poor sales. He put together a new design, based on covers from two US science fiction magazines, and gave it to artist Victor Caesari to complete. The resulting space scene was the cover for the second issue, which appeared in October 1946; in combination with Pendulum&#x27;s investment in promoting the magazine this led to much better sales, and the second issue sold out completely. Pendulum rebound the remaining copies of the first issue with the second cover design, and repriced them at 1/6 (7.5p); the first two issues had been priced at 2/- (10p). The new cover and price were much more popular and the repackaged first issue, like the second, soon sold out.

Pendulum Publications produced one more issue in October 1947, shortly before going bankrupt and thus leaving &quot;New Worlds&quot; without a publisher. The magazine was saved by a group of sf fans who since 1946 had been meeting regularly on Thursday nights at the White Horse public house on New Fetter Lane, near Fleet Street. At one of those meetings it was suggested that they form a company to revive &quot;New Worlds&quot;; one of those present, Frank Cooper, recently retired from the Royal Air Force, agreed to look into what would be necessary to start a new company.

===Nova Publications===

In May 1948 Carnell announced at a science fiction convention in London that plans were well underway to form a new company, to be called Nova Publications Ltd. Nova raised £600 in capital and was launched in early 1949. There were initially six directors: the chairman was John Wyndham, and the remaining board members were G. Ken Chapman, Frank Cooper, Walter Gillings, Eric C. Williams, and John Carnell. A printer was found near Stoke Newington, where Frank Cooper was based, and the first issue (numbered 4, to follow on from the three Pendulum issues) appeared in June. It was planned to move to regular quarterly publication, and subsequently to a bimonthly schedule. To keep costs down Nova decided to handle the distribution themselves; this was not easy but Cooper and his assistant, Les Flood, were sufficiently successful that in July the decision was taken to go ahead with the planned quarterly schedule. A fifth issue appeared in September, and the sixth issue early the following year, dated Spring 1950.

In 1950, with &quot;New Worlds&quot; on a stable quarterly schedule, Nova Publications decided to launch a companion, &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;. They chose Walter Gillings as the editor; but he was replaced by Carnell after two issues, partly because Nova could not afford to pay two editorial salaries, and partly because of &quot;fundamental differences of opinion&quot;. At the end of 1951 &quot;New Worlds&quot; went bimonthly, and by the middle of the year had reached a circulation of 18,000. The price had been reduced to 1/6 with the third issue, but with paper costs rising Nova looked for a cheaper printer. The new printer, The Carlton Press, was supposed to take over production with the May 1953 issue (number 21), but the issue was late, and had to be dated June 1953 instead. The issue was shoddily produced, which dismayed Nova&#x27;s board, and printers&#x27; strikes caused further delays. Nova discovered that The Carlton Press was an agent with no printing facilities; they farmed out work to other printers, but were only able to get their commissions executed when they paid off any prior debts to those printers. Issue 22 was repeatedly delayed; proofs appeared in August, and the issue was promised for November. Even this schedule was not adhered to, and Carnell received a copy of the print run in January 1954. The copy was dated 1953 (with no month), and since this made it useless for distribution in 1954, Carnell refused to accept the print run.

While the dispute with the printers was going on, Carnell and Maurice Goldsmith, a journalist acquaintance of Carnell&#x27;s, put together a small conference of well-known science fiction authors, including Arthur C. Clarke and John Wyndham. Goldsmith covered the conference for &quot;Illustrated&quot;, a weekly magazine, and the article caught the attention of Maclaren &amp; Sons Ltd, a technical trade publisher interested in launching a new sf magazine. Carnell turned down the offer because of his loyalty to Nova Publications, but subsequent discussions ultimately led to Maclaren taking control of Nova, with a commitment to produce &quot;New Worlds&quot; on a monthly basis and &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; on a bimonthly schedule. By January 1954, when The Carlton Press delivered the incorrectly dated issue 22, the acquisition by Maclaren was complete, and Maclaren&#x27;s legal department was helpful in resolving the dispute. The printing press which had printed the issue was not paid by The Carlton Press, so an injunction was obtained that sequestered the issues to avoid them being sold to recover the printing costs. Carnell retained the copy he had been sent in January, and it is thought that this is the only copy that exists of The Carlton Press&#x27;s version of this issue, as the remainder of the printing run was destroyed after the court case. The cover painting, by Gerard Quinn, was subsequently used on issue 13 of &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, and all the stories and editorial material eventually appeared in later issues of &quot;New Worlds&quot; over the next year.

The financial support that Maclaren provided meant that once issue 22 appeared in April 1954, it was the start of a regular monthly schedule that lasted until 1964 with just one hiccup: a printing dispute in 1959 delayed the August issue and it was combined with the September issue. Despite this stability, &quot;New Worlds&quot;″s circulation began to decline in the early 1960s. Nova Publications had launched a third magazine, &quot;Science Fiction Adventures&quot;, in 1958, but both it and &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; were also losing readers, and in May 1963 &quot;Science Fiction Adventures&quot; was cancelled. In September of that year Nova&#x27;s board decided to close down both &quot;New Worlds&quot; and &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, and in preparation for the change Carnell signed a contract in December 1963 to edit an original anthology series, &quot;New Writings in SF&quot;, for publisher Dennis Dobson.

===Roberts &amp; Vinter===
The magazines were unexpectedly saved by David Warburton of Roberts &amp; Vinter, a London publishing house. The printer who had been printing both &quot;New Worlds&quot; and &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; happened to meet Warburton in a pub, and mentioned that he was looking for additional work to fill the gaps in his schedule left by the demise of the magazines. Roberts &amp; Vinter were having difficulty getting good distribution for their existing titles, which were violent thrillers, and were interested in acquiring more respectable titles that would help them penetrate the British distribution network, which was heavily dependent on W.H. Smith and John Menzies, the two main British newsagent chains. Warburton&#x27;s partner, Godfrey Gold, ran a company that was connected to Roberts &amp; Vinter and published pin-up magazines; like Warburton, Gold needed to improve his ability to distribute his titles.

When Michael Moorcock, who by this time had begun selling stories to Carnell, heard of the plans to cease publication of &quot;New Worlds&quot; and &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, he wrote a letter that appeared in issue 141 lamenting the loss to the British science fiction field of both the magazines and Carnell himself. Carnell did not want to continue to edit the magazines in addition to &quot;New Writings in SF&quot;, and recommended Moorcock to Warburton. Kyril Bonfiglioli, an Oxford art dealer who was a friend of Brian Aldiss, also expressed an interest. Warburton gave Moorcock the choice of which magazine to edit; Moorcock chose &quot;New Worlds&quot;, and Bonfiglioli became the new editor of &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;. Moorcock wanted to switch to a large format, and showed Warburton a dummy issue he had made up, but Warburton insisted on a paperback format in order to fit in with the other titles they were producing, though he agreed to revisit the format in the future if sales improved. The first issue under Moorcock&#x27;s control was number 142, dated May/June 1964. The schedule was initially bimonthly, but at the start of 1965 it returned to a stable monthly schedule.

In July 1966 Roberts &amp; Vinter&#x27;s distributor, Thorpe &amp; Porter, went bankrupt, owing Roberts &amp; Vinter a substantial sum. The resulting financial pressure led Roberts &amp; Vinter to focus on their more profitable magazines, and they made plans to close down both &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; and &quot;New Worlds&quot;. After hearing of these plans, Moorcock and Warburton began to consider forming a separate company to continue publishing &quot;New Worlds&quot;, and Brian Aldiss contacted well-known literary figures such as J.B. Priestley, Kingsley Amis, Marghanita Laski, and Angus Wilson to gain support for an application for a grant from the British Arts Council in late 1966. In early January 1967 Aldiss discovered that the grant application would be successful, and that &quot;New Worlds&quot; would be awarded £150 per issue, though in the event the grant certification was delayed until at least May. The grant was enough to enable the magazine to continue, though it would not cover all costs. A publisher still had to be found, and both Fontana and Panther Books expressed an interest, but the promise of the money and the prestige of an Arts Council grant convinced Warburton to stay involved personally. While these negotiations were going on, two more issues were assembled from backfile material and donated stories. Roberts &amp; Vinter had ceased to exist by this time, so a sister company, Gold Star Publications, became the publisher for both these issues, with Warburton and Aldiss providing Gold Star with personal financial guarantees. These two issues appeared in March and April 1967, but the latter was mistakenly also dated March in the indicia. &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, which by this time had been retitled &quot;SF Impulse&quot;, was not continued but was merged with &quot;New Worlds&quot; as of the first Gold Star issue, though nothing of &quot;SF Impulse&quot;″s design or content was visible in &quot;New Worlds&quot;.

===Arts Council===
The partnership Warburton and Moorcock formed to continue &quot;New Worlds&quot; was named Magnelist Publications. Moorcock and Warburton reviewed the dummy issue Moorcock had put together when he first became editor, and Warburton agreed to switch to the larger format. The first issue from Magnelist appeared in July 1967, beginning a regular monthly schedule. Moorcock remained as editor with Langdon Jones as his assistant, and Charles Platt became the layout designer. Warburton ceased his involvement after the November issue, but the magazine was again saved, this time by Sylvester Stein of Stonehart Publications.

Delays led to a skipped month, with the December 1967 and January 1968 issues being combined into one, but a monthly schedule returned thereafter. The March 1968 issue contained the third instalment of Norman Spinrad&#x27;s novel &quot;Bug Jack Barron&quot;, which included some fairly explicit sex scenes. A member of parliament complained in the House of Commons that the Arts Council was &quot;sponsoring filth&quot;; and soon W.H. Smith and John Menzies, the two main retail outlets for magazines in the UK, withdrew the magazine from sale. The complaints came at the time when the Arts Council was considering renewing the grant for another year, and it appeared for a while that &quot;New Worlds&quot; would have to cease publication, but eventually the grant was renewed. With money from advertising, and a substantial contribution from Moorcock himself, the magazine was able to survive. 

The loss of revenue caused by the withdrawal from sale of the March 1968 issue was exacerbated by a temporary ban on the magazine in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, and by John Menzies&#x27; subsequent decision not to stock &quot;New Worlds&quot;. W.H. Smith left it to their individual branch managers to decide whether or not to carry the magazine. Stonehart were unhappy with developments and refused to pay the printers, who in turn withheld the printed copies. The Arts Council money had been intended for the contributors, but a disagreement over the grant led to Stonehart&#x27;s refusal to pay them as well. Some negative coverage appeared in the press as a consequence of the distribution ban. The grant was eventually renewed, but by late that year Moorcock paid contributors and printing bills and severed relations with Stein and Stonehart after the July 1968 issue and switched distributors to independent Moore Harness (&quot;Time Out&quot;, &quot;Private Eye&quot;).

Without reliable distribution at the leading newsagents, &quot;New Worlds&quot; had to rely on unconventional distribution and subscriptions. The magazine was not especially profitable, and since Moorcock had not formed a company to publish it, he was personally responsible for its costs. To bring in cash he had been writing fantasy novels at a very rapid rate since early 1968, and from early 1969 the editorial work was given to various others, primarily Charles Platt and Langdon Jones. A regular monthly schedule was adhered to from January until July 1969, at which point came another financial blow when it was discovered that half of the print run of 20,000 was being held back by the distributors. Moorcock attempted to regroup by reducing the number of pages in each issue, and because he was again forced to write as much as he could to earn enough to pay &quot;New Worlds&quot;″s bills, he turned over almost all editorial duties to Charles Platt, though others involved with the magazine also took turns at the editorial work over the next few issues. Moorcock was £3,000 in debt, and in combination with the Arts Council&#x27;s decision not to renew their grant he found himself with no option but to cease publication on a monthly schedule and arrange a quarterly schedule in paperback format published by Sphere Books. The April 1970 issue, the 200th, was the last that went out to the distributors; one more issue was prepared and posted to subscribers as the &#x27;Special Good Taste Issue&#x27; the following March.

===Later incarnations===
When Moorcock realised that the magazine would have to fold, he made arrangements with Sphere Books to continue &quot;New Worlds&quot; as a quarterly paperback anthology series. Sphere produced eight issues, although the quarterly schedule was not adhered to after the fourth issue; the eighth issue appeared in 1975. Six issues were reprinted in the US. The early issues did well financially, with about 25,000 copies sold, not counting US sales. Moorcock turned over the editorship to Charles Platt with the sixth volume, and to Hilary Bailey thereafter, to give himself more time to devote to his own writing: he also commented that by this time &quot;I no longer had my editorial touch (I couldn&#x27;t read sf at all)&quot;. Sphere cancelled the series after two more issues; it was briefly taken over by Corgi Books, but sales were weak and Corgi dropped the series with &quot;New Worlds 10&quot; in 1976, although according to Moorcock he and Bailey decided to end the series when they got into disagreements with Corgi. In the US Berkley Books published volumes 1 through 4, and when they dropped the series Platt, who was a consulting editor at Avon Books, reprinted two further volumes, number 6 and 7 of the UK series.

In 1978 the magazine was revived by Moorcock again, this time in a fanzine format. Four more issues appeared, professionally printed and with various editors, between Spring 1978 and September 1979. There followed a gap until 1991, when &quot;New Worlds&quot; again reappeared as a paperback anthology series, this time edited by David S. Garnett. Four volumes appeared between 1991 and 1994, published by Victor Gollancz. Moorcock edited a fiftieth anniversary issue in 1996, and Garnett subsequently edited one more issue of the anthology. Together with the earlier fanzine, magazine and anthology versions, these took the issue numbering from 212 through to 222.

In 2021 the magazine was revived once again by Nick Gevers and Peter Crowther at PS Publishing as an anthology series with paperback and limited signed hardcover editions. 

==Contents and reception==

===Carnell===
The lead story of the first issue of &quot;New Worlds&quot; was Maurice Hugi&#x27;s &quot;The Mill of the Gods&quot;. John Russell Fearn contributed four stories, under his own name and three pseudonyms, and William Temple provided &quot;The Three Pylons&quot;, a fantasy which turned out to be the most popular story in the issue. Science fiction historian Mike Ashley regards the next two issues as an improvement on the first; the second issue contained John Wyndham&#x27;s &quot;The Living Lies&quot;, under his &quot;John Beynon&quot; alias, and the third contained &quot;Inheritance&quot;, an early story by Arthur C. Clarke. Wyndham&#x27;s story, about hostility and bigotry shown by settlers on Venus to the Venusian natives, was reprinted in &quot;Other Worlds&quot; in 1950, while &quot;Inheritance&quot; later appeared in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;.

The acquisition of Nova Publications by Maclaren in 1954 gave &quot;New Worlds&quot; the stability to establish itself as a leading magazine. Ashley describes the period from 1954 to 1960 as a &quot;Golden Age&quot; for &quot;New Worlds&quot;. Carnell bought J. G. Ballard&#x27;s first sale, &quot;Escapement&quot;, which appeared in the December 1956 &quot;New Worlds&quot;; Ballard went on to become a significant figure in the genre in the 1960s. Ballard was grateful to Carnell for the support he provided Ballard in the late 1950s. Much of Ballard&#x27;s work appeared in &quot;New Worlds&quot; and &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, and Ballard later recalled that Carnell &quot;recognized what I was on about from a very early stage and he encouraged me to go on writing in my own way.&quot; Carnell also published much of Brian Aldiss&#x27;s early work in &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; and &quot;New Worlds&quot;. John Brunner, later to become one of the most successful British science fiction writers, appeared regularly in the Nova magazines, starting with &quot;Visitors&#x27; Book&quot; in the April 1955 &quot;New Worlds&quot;. James White began publishing with &quot;Assisted Passage&quot; in the January 1953 &quot;New Worlds&quot;, and in 1957 began his popular Sector General series, about a hospital for aliens, with &quot;Sector General&quot; in the November 1957 issue. John Wyndham, who was already well known outside the genre for works such as &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;, began a series about the Troons, a space-going family, with &quot;For All the Night&quot; in the April 1958 issue. Arthur C. Clarke, another successful British sf writer of the period, wrote relatively few short stories for the British market, but published &quot;Who&#x27;s There&quot; in the November 1958 &quot;New Worlds&quot;. Colin Kapp began his popular &quot;Unorthodox Engineers&quot; series with &quot;The Railways up on Cannis&quot;, in October 1959. Other less well-known writers who were prolific during the late 1950s included J. T. McIntosh, Kenneth Bulmer, and E. C. Tubb.

&quot;New Worlds&quot; has been credited with &quot;shap[ing] the way science fiction developed&quot; as a genre. It &quot;did the most&quot; of any magazine for British science fiction, helping to revive a nationalist style of speculative fiction in the 1950s; Roger Luckhurst called it &quot;the most important British sf journal&quot;. Particularly influential were Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; (published in 1950), and the work of Brian Aldiss, John Brunner and J. G. Ballard. Mike Ashley argued that &quot;New Worlds&quot; and &quot;Science-Fantasy&quot; were &quot;the bedrock of high-quality science fiction in Britain&quot;. Female readership for the magazine was between 5 and 15 percent, according to surveys conducted during the 1950s. The magazine became increasingly popular among a younger demographic: readers 19 and under made up 5 percent of total readership in 1954, 18 percent in 1958, and 31 percent in 1963. The same polls also showed an increase in the number of science and technology workers reading the magazine during that period. Among the best artists of this period were Brian Lewis, Gordon Hutchings, and Gerard Quinn, whose art is regarded by Ashley as comparable in style to Virgil Finlay&#x27;s work. In 1957 Carnell stopped using interior art, saying that &quot;art work in the digest-size magazines is as out-of-date as a coal fire&quot;.

In Ashley&#x27;s view, the quality of &quot;New Worlds&quot; began to drop in the early 1960s. It still ran popular series such as White&#x27;s Sector General stories, and printed some well-received stories such as Harry Harrison&#x27;s &quot;The Streets of Ashkelon&quot;, about a clash between an atheist (the protagonist) and a priest, on another planet. Because of the subject matter, it took six years for Harrison to find an editor willing to accept the story; when Aldiss bought it for an anthology, Carnell agreed to print it in &quot;New Worlds&quot;, where it appeared in September 1962. J.G. Ballard continued to publish in &quot;New Worlds&quot;, but was now sending his more conventional stories to the US magazines, and submitting his more experimental pieces to Carnell. Examples from 1961 to 1964 include &quot;The Overloaded Man&quot;, &quot;The Subliminal Man&quot;, &quot;End-Game&quot;, and &quot;The Terminal Beach&quot;, with themes of psychological stress, and changes to the nature of perception and of reality.

===Moorcock===
When Roberts &amp; Vinter made the decision to close down &quot;New Worlds&quot; in 1963, Moorcock and Ballard considered publishing a new magazine that would be willing, as Carnell had been, to publish experimental material. Moorcock assembled a dummy issue, and later described his intentions: &quot;It would be on art paper, to take good quality illustrations; it would be the size of, say, &quot;Playboy&quot; so that it would get good display space on the newsstands; it would specialise in experimental work by writers like [William] Burroughs and [Eduardo] Paolozzi, but it would be &#x27;popular&#x27;, it would seek to publicise such experimenters; it would publish all those writers who had become demoralised by a lack of sympathetic publishers and by baffled critics; it would attempt a cross-fertilization of popular sf, science and the work of the literary and artistic avant garde.&quot; Moorcock also wrote a letter to Carnell setting out his thoughts on what science fiction needed: &quot;Editors who are willing to take a risk on a story and run it even though this may bring criticism on their heads.&quot; The letter was published in the final Nova Publications issue, which also carried the announcement that Moorcock would be taking over from Carnell as editor of &quot;New Worlds&quot;, though Moorcock had been unaware he would be considered for the post when he wrote his letter.

Moorcock&#x27;s first issue, dated May/June 1964, bore a cover by James Cawthorn illustrating the first instalment of Ballard&#x27;s novella &quot;Equinox&quot;; Ballard also contributed a book review of William Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Dead Fingers Talk&quot;, and stories by Brian Aldiss, Barrington Bayley, and John Brunner completed the issue. Moorcock&#x27;s editorial included a quote from a radio interview with William Burroughs to the effect that &quot;If writers are to describe the advanced techniques of the Space Age, they must invent writing techniques equally advanced in order properly to deal with them.&quot; Within the first few issues, Moorcock printed stories intended to demonstrate his editorial goals. The most controversial of these was Langdon Jones&#x27; &quot;I Remember, Anita ...&quot;, which appeared in the September/October 1964 issue; the story contained sex scenes that led to arguments in the magazine&#x27;s letter column, and some regular subscribers abandoned the magazines, though overall circulation increased.

Moorcock contributed a substantial amount of material, under his own name and under pseudonyms such as James Colvin; some of these stories were fairly traditional, but contributions such as the Jerry Cornelius stories, which began with &quot;Preliminary Data&quot; in the August 1965 issue, were much more experimental. He also printed his novella &quot;Behold the Man&quot; in the September 1966 issue; the story, about a time traveller who returns to the time of Christ, won him a Nebula Award the following year. Ballard also began to write some of his most controversial stories, including &quot;You: Coma: Marilyn Monroe&quot; in the June 1966 issue, and &quot;The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race&quot;, in March 1967; both had been previously published in &quot;Ambit&quot;, a literary magazine, in 1966.

Many writers now found &quot;New Worlds&quot; to be a market in which they could publish experimental material. Charles Platt, David I. Masson, and Barrington Bayley were among the British writers in this group, and Moorcock also attracted work from US writers such as John Sladek, Roger Zelazny and Thomas M. Disch. Zelazny&#x27;s contributions included &quot;For a Breath I Tarry&quot; in March 1966, and Disch published several short stories and the novel &quot;Echo Round His Bones&quot;, which was serialized starting in the December 1966 and January 1967 issues. Disch commented that he had been unable to find a publisher for the novel in the US.

In the mid-1960s, the term &quot;New Wave&quot; began to be applied to the more experimental work that Moorcock was publishing, and &quot;New Worlds&quot; was soon regarded as the leading publication in the New Wave movement. In addition to the experimental material, Moorcock attempted to keep the existing readership happy by publishing more traditional science fiction; in the words of sf historian Colin Greenland, he &quot;changed the contents of the magazine much more slowly than he pretended to&quot;. Traditional sf stories bought by Moorcock include Vernor Vinge&#x27;s first story, &quot;Apartness&quot;, which appeared in June 1965; he also printed material from Bob Shaw, early stories by Terry Pratchett, and, in March 1965, Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Sunjammer&quot;.

===Arts Council and after===
When Moorcock took over publication of &quot;New Worlds&quot; from Roberts &amp; Vinter he changed the format from digest to a larger size with good quality paper that allowed better use of artwork. The first issue in this format, July 1967, contained part one of Disch&#x27;s &quot;Camp Concentration&quot;, written for the magazine and refused by its American publisher because of the explicit language used by the protagonist. Disch afterwards recalled that some of the experimental language in the book was written in the knowledge that &quot;New Worlds&quot; was available as a market for unconventional fiction. Other new writers who appeared in the magazine include M. John Harrison and Robert Holdstock, who both appeared in the November 1968 issue, and Michael Butterworth whose work first appeared in the May 1966 edition. The December 1968 issue included Samuel R. Delany&#x27;s &quot;Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones&quot;, and Harlan Ellison&#x27;s &quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot; appeared in April 1969; Ellison won a Nebula Award, and Delany both a Nebula and a Hugo, though it was not until the stories were reprinted in book form that they were widely noticed.

The July 1967 issue of &quot;New Worlds&quot; contained Pamela Zoline&#x27;s first story, &quot;The Heat Death of the Universe&quot;, which used entropy, a frequent theme in &quot;New Worlds&quot;, as a metaphor. The story is one of the best examples of the new approach Moorcock was taking with the magazine: in the words of critic Edward James, the goal was to &quot;use science-fictional and scientific language and imagery to describe perfectly &#x27;ordinary&#x27; scenes of life, and by doing so produce altered perceptions of reality in the reader&quot;. &quot;Inner space&quot;, a term originally coined by J.B. Priestley, was also used to describe the focus of the stories Moorcock printed, in contrast to traditional science fiction&#x27;s focus on outer space, and James regards the term as &quot;the watchword of the British New Wave, and the shibboleth by which one recognized those who had abandoned Gernsback and Campbell.&quot; The methods and interests of these writers were quite different from those of traditional science fiction: the concern was with internal rather than external reality, and experimental techniques, unusual juxtapositions of material, and a focus on psychological concerns were the norm.

With the switch to anthology format, some of the more experimental material disappeared. In his editorials, Moorcock made it clear that he did not want to exclude traditional sf stories; he wanted to eliminate the genre boundaries completely, and have science fiction treated as part of the mainstream of fiction. The quarterlies were labelled as science fiction since Sphere knew that would increase sales. The stories printed in the anthologies were generally downbeat. New writers who appeared for the first time in the quarterly anthology series included Marta Randall (under the name Marta Bergstrasser), Eleanor Arnason, Geoff Ryman, and Rachel Pollack (as Richard A. Pollack).

Issue 212 reprinted a piece written by Moorcock and M. John Harrison that was a spoof issue of &quot;The Guardian&quot;; it had been published in &quot;Frendz&quot;, an underground paper, in 1971. The next two issues also contained mock newspaper stories; issue 215 contained more conventional material, including a Jerry Cornelius story written by Charles Partington. Issue 216, the last of the late 1970s issues, reintroduced the mock news stories. The 1990s anthology series did not try to recapture the atmosphere or style of the 1960s or 1970s &quot;New Worlds&quot;. It contained some well-received material, including stories by Moorcock, Paul Di Filippo, and Ian McDonald, but was financially unsuccessful. The current revival from PS Publishing began in 2021.

==&quot;New Worlds&quot; and the &quot;New Wave&quot;==
&quot;New Worlds&quot;″ greatest influence on science fiction came in the 1960s, with the &quot;New Wave&quot; that began with Moorcock&#x27;s polemical editorials. Moorcock asserted in 1965 that a writer of good sf &quot;can learn from his predecessors, but he should not imitate them&quot;; and he was soon publishing stories that were quite different in technique and style from anything that had appeared before, not just in &quot;New Worlds&quot; itself, but in any of the sf magazines. Moorcock&#x27;s goal was to use the magazine to &quot;define a new avant-garde role&quot; for the genre. &quot;New Worlds&quot; thus became the &quot;ideological center of the [New Wave] movement to rejuvenate conjectural literature&quot;.

The term &quot;New Wave&quot; did not always meet with approval among those who were regarded as part of it (this included Moorcock, who denied that he was creating a movement). Brian Aldiss, for example, wrote to Judith Merril in 1966 that he suspected the term was &quot;a journalistic invention of yours and Mike Moorcock&#x27;s&quot;, and added &quot;I feel I am no part of the New Wave; I was here before &#x27;em, and by God I mean to be here after they&#x27;ve gone (still writing bloody science fiction)!&quot; Merril was an important advocate for &quot;New Worlds&quot; and the New Wave, and popularized the latter in her anthology &quot;England Swings SF&quot;, which appeared in 1968; she spent almost a year in London, living near Moorcock, when researching the anthology in 1966–1967. Merril and writer Christopher Priest were among those who used the term &quot;New Wave&quot; to describe the work being done in &quot;New Worlds&quot;, but Aldiss was not the only writer to object to the term, and it never received a generally accepted definition. Critic Brian Attebery characterizes it as a &quot;disruptive, existentially fraught and formally daring&quot; style; Peter Nicholls hesitates to define it but comments that &quot;perhaps the fundamental element was the belief that sf could and should be taken seriously as literature&quot;. In a 1967 interview, Ballard, one of the writers most closely associated with the New Wave, described modern US sf as extrovert and optimistic, and contrasted it with &quot;the new science fiction, that other people apart from myself are now beginning to write&quot;, which he saw as &quot;introverted, possibly pessimistic rather than optimistic, much less certain of its own territory.&quot;

Whatever the exact definition of the term, between 1964 and 1966, &quot;New Worlds&quot; was at the forefront of the New Wave movement. Two guest editorials in 1962 and 1963 (&quot;Which way to Inner Space?&quot; by Ballard and &quot;Play with Feeling&quot; by Moorcock) were arguably the &quot;first glimmerings&quot; of New Wave ideas in sf magazines. Latham suggests that these were &quot;the first volleys in the polemical offensive they would launch once [Moorcock] gained control of the magazine and installed [Ballard] as his resident visionary&quot;. The response to the New Wave from critics and sf fans was varied. Christopher Priest called &quot;New Worlds&quot; a &quot;New Wave prozine&quot;, but lauded the talents of its writers and its experimental stories (with the exception of Ballard&#x27;s &quot;The Crystal World&quot;, which he deemed &quot;tedious and wearying&quot;). Ian McAuley suggested the magazine&#x27;s editors were &quot;plugging the &#x27;inner-space&#x27; jazz for all its worth&quot;. Mike Ashley argued that &quot;New Worlds&quot; was instrumental in promoting authors who would not otherwise have been published (a suggestion with which Bould and Butler concur). Ballard was a particular focus of both praise and vehement criticism, and was vigorously defended by Moorcock. Peter Weston took an &quot;even-handed approach&quot; by praising &quot;New Worlds&quot; in &quot;Speculation&quot; editorials, in contrast with his largely negative columnists. 

Beginning in 1966, US fanzines began responding to &quot;New Worlds&quot; and its detractors, and the debate spread to the professional US magazines as well. Merril praised Disch and Ballard&#x27;s contributions to &quot;New Worlds&quot; in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;; Algis Budrys in &quot;Galaxy&quot; rebutted her viewpoint and condemned both authors. Frederik Pohl called &quot;New Worlds&quot; &quot;damned dull&quot;, advocating a return to adventure stories. American science fiction authors &quot;were finding it increasingly difficult to avoid partisan alignments in the developing New Wave war&quot; because of the preponderance of columns and letters in American magazines both for and against &quot;New Worlds&quot; and New Wave in general. Latham suggests that &quot;the New Worlds editorial conclave was actively working within fandom to counteract the Old Guard assaults&quot;.

By the end of the 1960s, &quot;New Worlds&quot; and the New Wave&#x27;s connection to and influence on science fiction was becoming tenuous. In the August 1969 issue, Platt asserted that &quot;&quot;New Worlds&quot; is not a science-fiction magazine&quot;, and Moorcock likened it to an avant-garde and experimental literary review. The sf world had lost interest in &quot;New Worlds&quot;, and it had become, in Ashley&#x27;s words, &quot;a revolution running out of energy&quot;. In the longer term it proved influential, despite the lack of wide acceptance at the time: in the words of sf historian Brian Stableford, &quot;the paths beaten by the &quot;New Worlds&quot; writers are now much more generally in use&quot;.

==Bibliographic details==
The following table shows the editorial succession at &quot;New Worlds&quot;, indicates which issues appeared from which publisher, and gives the format, page count and price of each issue: Dates in [square brackets] indicate the approximate date that an issue was released in cases where a month did not appear on the magazine.

There were US reprints of six of the &quot;New Worlds Quarterly&quot; anthology series. The first four were published by Berkley Books; Avon Books picked up two more of the series after Berkley dropped it, but since the fifth volume had been missed by that time, Avon retitled volumes 6 and 7 as &quot;New Worlds Quarterly 5&quot; and &quot;New Worlds Quarterly 6&quot;.

===US editions===
A US reprint edition of &quot;New Worlds&quot; ran briefly in 1960, published by Great American Publications, who at the time were the publishers of &quot;Fantastic Universe&quot;, edited by Hans Stefan Santesson. The first issue appeared in March 1960; it omitted Carnell&#x27;s name, and credited Santesson as editor. Although the fiction consisted entirely of reprints, with all but one story coming from the British &quot;New Worlds&quot;, this was not declared to the reader. Carnell was unhappy with the results of this attempt to break into the US market, but in the event Great American collapsed later that year and only five issues appeared, on a monthly schedule from March to July. The contents of the issues did not correspond to specific British issues: the majority were taken from &quot;New Worlds&quot; but one story was reprinted from Nova&#x27;s edition of &quot;Science Fiction Adventures&quot;, and three were taken from &quot;Fantastic Universe&quot;, which had ceased publication with its March 1960 issue.

Subsequently the British edition was released in the US essentially unchanged, with a cover date delayed by one month, starting with issue 99 (October 1960).

<text>Bawls (marketed as BAWLS Guarana) is a non-alcoholic, highly-caffeinated soft drink.

Created in 1996, the citrus-and-cream soda-flavored beverage leans heavily on the caffeine and natural flavor of the Amazonian guarana berry. Packaged in unique cobalt-blue bottles and cans, the drink was well received by gamers, to whom the company quickly began extensively marketing (through both sponsorships and video games themselves). The soda&#x27;s name has an unclear provenance, and is still sold alongside six other flavors.

==History==
In 1994, Hobart C. Buppert III (born ) was a student at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration. While traveling through Vienna, he found club dancers were paying for cans of non-alcoholic, highly-caffeinated, &quot;sludgy brew&quot; derived from guarana beans. Himself unable to tolerate coffee, Buppert saw potential in refining the drink he saw in Europe and received permission from Cornell to develop a business plan as an independent study.

Buppert graduated from Cornell in 1995 with a degree in finance. In 1996, he took out a loan for to launch Hobarama in Miami Beach, Florida. That November in South Beach, he launched his first product: Bawls Guarana, a soft drink with three times the caffeine of Coca-Cola Classic. Bawls capitalized upon trends of the mid-1990s by being highly caffeinated, derived from natural ingredients, and having a gimmicky premise. By 1998, Bawls was not only popular in the nightclubs of New York City, South Florida, and Southern California, but was spreading to grocery stores in the US and Europe. In its first year, Bawls brought in revenue of . By 2000, Bawls was distributed by Arizona Distribution, and two years later, Hobarama moved into new Miami Beach offices at 311 Lincoln Road.

By November 2009, Hobarama was struggling, and creditors like Fifth Third Bank forced out chief executive officer (CEO) and founder, Buppert. A restructuring plan was put into place, and the company was entertaining any buyout offers. On stable footing by 2012, the company bought out competitors Crunk Energy Drink and Strut &amp; Rut. Jon Gunnerson was the company&#x27;s CEO in 2014, which had since moved its offices to Twinsburg, Ohio.

The marketing and higher caffeine content of Monster Energy delivered the first damage to Bawls&#x27; market share in 2002 by being more-widely appealing. The company later lost even its gamer niche to brands including Mtn Dew Game Fuel, Rockstar, and G Fuel—a brand with over 111 times more social-media followers. In 2022, the drink was being produced by Solvi Acquisition, and &quot;Bon Appétit&quot; reported on both Buppert&#x27;s prediction that Bawls was in its twilight, and that the drink was &quot;nearly impossible to find in stores&quot;.

&quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; described Bawls&#x27; taste as citrus-flavored cream soda, and the soft drink gets its caffeine from the Amazonian guarana berry.

In 2002, a bottle had of caffeine, and cost about . In 2004, a bottle had as much caffeine as 1.5 cups of coffee, and cost between (equivalent to $– in ).

In 2015, the can of original Bawls had , and both the composition and guarana suppliers were yet unchanged from 1996.

===Packaging===

In 2003, Bawls sourced its cobalt-blue bottles from Germany, and the bottle caps from Ecuador. They came together in Hillside, New Jersey where Bawls was bottled with guarana from Brazil. Circa 2005, Buppert described the drink&#x27;s brand identity as based on the unique bottles, where the raised bumps &quot;convey the idea of &#x27;bouncing balls inside the bottle punching their way out.

In 2006, Hobarama developed a canned variant of Bawls both for shipping to overseas fans serving with the United States Armed Forces, and distribution at events prohibiting glass containers (e.g. paintball tournaments). The company partnered with Crown Beverage Packaging to develop a can that would evoke the uniqueness of the textured bottles: the aluminum cans are the first to feature foaming ink, a new and then-unused technology that applies a low-gloss print that swells when heated, giving the cans a surface akin to the bottles. In Montreal, Crown&#x27;s manufacturing of these new cans took 18.6–30 percent longer than traditional can-printing processes. The can was one of &quot;Brand Packaging&quot; selections for &quot;best new consumer package goods packages of 2006.&quot;

==Marketing==
By 2002, Bawls was focusing its marketing on gamers, who amounted to 50 percent of the drink&#x27;s consumers, and were &quot;typically males between 18 and 34.&quot; Eschewing the health-benefits claims of other energy drinks of the time, Bawls instead focused on just being a soft drink with lots of caffeine, earning &quot;an almost cult-like following among computer addicts looking for a source of energy to keep them awake for gaming binges lasting 15 to 24 hours straight.&quot; That year, the company sponsored 2500 LAN parties.

To capitalize on the connection, the national chain CompUSA began selling the soda in its stores &quot;to court the hard-core gamer market&quot; (those who played PC games for more than 40 hours per week). From 2004 through at least 2008, Bawls was featured at the Penny Arcade Expo, which brought the drink &quot;a huge amount of attention&quot;. Bawls partnered with GameFly in 2008 to cross-promote each other through mutual discounts. In 2014, the Bawls was still marketed to gamers, including sponsoring QuakeCon 2014 where were drunk.

===Name===
In a 1998 interview with CNNfn, Buppert said of the name, &quot;[it] represents a state of mind. Bawls is a very common slang term—to be bold and daring—and that&#x27;s how we see the product. [...] I think it&#x27;s very difficult for a consumer to forget a product called Bawls Guarana.&quot; In 2002, &quot;The Mercury News&quot; reported that BAWLS was an abbreviation for Brazilian American Wildlife Society, &quot;intended to promote sustainable uses for the rain forest&quot;; Buppert repeated that story to CNN in 2003. A 2004 article by &quot;The Cornell Daily Sun&quot; said Buppert was brainstorming to emulate the strong names of existing brands (Flying Tiger, Red Bull), when &quot;Bawls&quot; instead came from a friend&#x27;s joke of &quot;Why don’t you just call it Balls?&quot; When Gunnerson was asked about the name in 2015, he said, &quot;Bounce like a ball. It gives you enough energy and fuel. That was really the inspiration of it from my understanding. […] Bounce with BAWLS was really our one key tagline for quite some time.&quot;

===Product placement===
Hobarama and Vivendi Universal Games made a deal in 2002 for cross-promotion. Bawls received product placement as a game mechanic in the 2002 video game, &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;: protagonist Nick Conner drinks Bawls from vending machines to boost his health. In exchange, cases of Bawls bore advertisements for the game.

In the 2004 video game, &quot;&quot;, a shakeup in the management of Interplay Entertainment led to the replacement of the &quot;Fallout&quot; franchise&#x27;s iconic Nuka-Cola with the real-world Bawls for the franchise&#x27;s first outing on consoles. The swap was not well-received by fans.

Bawls has also been featured in TV shows and films, including &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;The Hangover&quot;, and &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;.

===Sponsorships===
In 2002, the soda was the official soft drink of the Cyberathlete Professional League. Bawls has also been the official energy drink for the National Professional Paintball League (in 2004 &amp; 2006), Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week (2008), and Olympus Fashion Week.

==Reception==
In 1998, after Bawls was positively reviewed by Stephen Heaslip of &quot;Blue&#x27;s News&quot;, the company&#x27;s own site traffic increased by 2700–11320 percent. In 2003, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; called the drink &quot;a smooth and tasty sip.&quot; In 2005, Hobarama shipped 20 million bottles of Bawls. &quot;Ars Technica&quot; wrote of Bawls in 2008, &quot;the huge amounts of caffeine within each bottle—along with the fact that it tastes far better than Red Bull—have made it a favorite beverage at many a LAN party and game tournament since [2004].&quot;

==Variants==
The sugar-free Bawls Guaranexx was the first variant of Bawls, released in 2003. In 2006, Hobarama partnered with 7-Eleven to produce a Bawls-based Slurpee (Sno Bawls) in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. By 2008, additional Bawls variants were available, including Bawls Cherry and Bawls Exxtra. Bawls&#x27; root beer variant—G33k Beer—premiered at a 2008 &quot;Halo&quot; tournament in South Miami, Florida; that year it was named BevNET&#x27;s Energy Drink of the Year.

, there were eleven combinations of Bawls flavors and packaging listed on the official website. In bottles were Original Soda, Zero, Orange, Ginger, Cherry Cola, Cherry, and Root Beer. The cans were sold with Original, Zero, Cherry, and Root Beer.

<doc id="897824" wikidata="Q240162" url="?curid=897824" title="Stephanie Seymour">
<text>Stephanie Michelle Seymour (born July 23, 1968) is an American model and actress. During the 1980s and 1990s, she was one of the most popular supermodels, being featured in the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; and the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot;, as well as being a former Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel. She had a book published about beauty tips and has participated in advertising campaigns for clothing and cosmetic products. In 2017, Seymour launched her own line of lingerie. She has ventured into acting with one appearance in each medium of film, television, and video games.

==Early life and career==
Born in San Diego, California, the middle child of a California real estate-developer father and hairstylist mother, Seymour started her modeling career working for local newspapers and department stores in her hometown at the age of 16. In 1983, at 15, she was a finalist at the inaugural Elite Model Management Look of the Year modeling contest (now called Elite Model Look).

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Seymour appeared in numerous issues of the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; and on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot; as well. During the same period, Seymour was a primary lingerie and hosiery model for the relatively new Victoria&#x27;s Secret company in its mail-order catalogs and retail stores. In March 1991, and again in February 1993, Seymour posed for &quot;Playboy&quot;. She was one of the most famous supermodels of the 1980s and 1990s along with Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Helena Christensen, Cindy Crawford, and Claudia Schiffer. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; would later have several of these models appear on the cover of an issue photographed by Mario Testino, called &quot;—A League Of Their Own&quot;.

In the 2006 book &quot;In Vogue: The Illustrated History of the World&#x27;s Most Famous Fashion Magazine&quot;, the editors cite the &quot;original supermodels&quot; and Seymour when quoting &quot;Vogue&quot; editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who said, &quot;Those girls were so fabulous for fashion and totally reflected that time ... [They] were like movie stars.&quot; The editors name famous models from previous decades, but explain that, &quot;None of them attained the fame and worldwide renown bestowed on Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Tatjana Patitz, Stephanie Seymour, Claudia Schiffer, Yasmeen Ghauri, and Karen Mulder in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These models burst out beyond the pages of the magazines. Many became the faces of cosmetics brands and perfumes, had their own television programs and physical-fitness videos and their own lines of lingerie. Their lives, activities, influences, and images were the subjects of all types of sociological and historical analysis.&quot;

In 1998, Seymour wrote &quot;Stephanie Seymour&#x27;s Beauty Secrets for Dummies&quot;. In 2000, Seymour was ranked #91 on the North American &quot;FHM&quot; 100 Sexiest Women of 2000 list. In 2006, she appeared in a campaign for Gap with her children.

Salvatore Ferragamo&#x27;s creative campaign for his fall/winter 2007/2008 collection featured Seymour and Claudia Schiffer, shot on location in Italy with Mario Testino. In the promotional photos, the supermodels play film stars protected by bodyguards and pursued by the paparazzi. Seymour was joined by other fellow supermodels Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Linda Evangelista, Daria Werbowy, Christy Turlington, and Amber Valletta for the September 2013 issue of &quot;Interview&quot; magazine titled &quot;Model&quot;.

In 2014, Seymour was named a global spokesmodel for Estée Lauder.

Seymour co-founded and launched the lingerie line &quot;Raven &amp; Sparrow&quot; in 2017. The line features high end vintage inspired pieces designed for comfort, ranging from camisoles and rompers to silk robes and nightgowns. It is available exclusively at Barneys New York.

===Acting===
Seymour&#x27;s first acting role was as explosives expert Cynna Stone in the video game &quot;&quot;. She played the unusual part of a live actor in a game whose characters and scenery were nearly all CG renders.

In 2000, Seymour played Helen Frankenthaler in the movie &quot;Pollock&quot;. In 2002, she played the role of Sara Lindstrom in the &quot;Crazy&quot; episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;.

==Personal life==
At the age of 14, she began dating 42 year old John Casablancas, the head of Elite Model Management, who was, at the time, married to model Jeanette Christiansen. The couple lived together before Seymour broke off the relationship.

From 1989 to 1990, she was married to guitarist Tommy Andrews. They have a son named Dylan together.

By mid-1991, she had become involved with Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns N&#x27; Roses. She appeared in two music videos by Guns N&#x27; Roses: &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and &quot;November Rain&quot;. The couple were engaged, but they broke up in February 1993. In August 1993, Rose sued Seymour claiming she assaulted him and stole more than $100,000 worth of jewelry. Seymour countersued claiming he was physically abusive. Seymour subpoenaed Erin Everly, Rose&#x27;s ex-wife, to testify that she was also abused by him. The lawsuits were eventually settled.

Shortly after her breakup with Rose, Seymour began dating businessman Peter Brant, who was married and the father of five children. She gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first son, Peter II, in December 1993. Seymour and Brant married in July 1995 in Paris. Seymour gave birth to a second son, Harry, in 1996, and a daughter in 2004. In March 2009, Seymour filed for divorce from Brant after almost 14 years of marriage. The couple reconciled in 2010. In January 2021, Harry died at age 24 from an accidental prescription medication overdose, after struggling with addiction for several years.

<text>Leroy Vinnegar (July 13, 1928 – August 3, 1999) was an American jazz bassist. Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, the self-taught Vinnegar established his reputation in Los Angeles, California, during the 1950s and 1960s. His trademark was the rhythmic &quot;walking&quot; bass line, a steady series of ascending or descending notes, and it brought him the nickname &quot;The Walker&quot;. Besides his jazz work, he also appeared on a number of soundtracks and pop albums, notably Van Morrison&#x27;s 1972 album, &quot;Saint Dominic&#x27;s Preview&quot;.

==Music career==
He recorded extensively as both a leader and sideman. He came to public attention in the 1950s as a result of recording with Lee Konitz, André Previn, Stan Getz, Shorty Rogers, Chet Baker, Shelly Manne, Joe Castro and Serge Chaloff.

He played bass on Previn and Manne&#x27;s &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; album, one of the most successful jazz records ever produced. He also performed on another of jazz&#x27;s biggest hit albums, Eddie Harris and Les McCann&#x27;s &quot;Swiss Movement&quot;, released in 1969. Vinnegar also performed at the Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach, California, and Diggers in East Los Angeles in the late 1950s, with drummer and pianist Don Joham along with other musicians. He moved to Portland, Oregon in 1986. In 1995, the Oregon State Legislature honored him by proclaiming May 1 Leroy Vinnegar Day.

Vinnegar died of a heart attack, at the age of 71, on August 3, 1999, in a hospital in Portland.

<text>KATU (channel 2) is a television station in Portland, Oregon, United States, affiliated with ABC. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside La Grande–licensed independent station KUNP, channel 16 (which KATU simulcasts on its second digital subchannel). The two stations share studios on Northeast Sandy Boulevard in Portland; KATU&#x27;s transmitter is located in the Sylvan-Highlands section of the city.

KATU went on the air as the fourth commercial station in Portland in 1962. It was built and signed on by Fisher Broadcasting Company, later Fisher Communications, and originally served as an independent station before joining ABC in 1964. The station expanded its local programming in the early 1970s and became a contender in Portland-area local news ratings. Fisher continued to own KATU until the entire company was sold to Sinclair Broadcast Group in 2013.

==History==
===Channel 2 comes to Portland===

Channel 2 was not initially assigned to Portland, being allocated in 1957. That action spurred activity on the valuable frequency. Four applications were initially received, from &quot;The Oregon Journal&quot;, owner of KPOJ (1330 AM); Fisher Broadcasting Company, which owned KOMO radio and television in Seattle; Tribune Publishing Company, publisher of &quot;The News Tribune&quot; and owner of KTNT-TV in Tacoma, Washington; and KPTV (channel 12), which wanted to move to channel 2. KPTV later withdrew, and KPOJ dropped its application in March, but it was not until the end of 1959 that a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) hearing examiner recommended Fisher over the Tribune Publishing Company for the channel 2 construction permit. The full commission began drafting paperwork in support of this decision in December 1960, and Fisher received the permit on February 23, 1961.

Work began to build facilities in the former Crystal Laundry on NE Sandy Boulevard in June; the two-story building was refitted to contain two production studios. The station originally was assigned the call letters KOXO but switched to the call sign KATU within months.

KATU began broadcasting on March 15, 1962, originally operating as an independent station; Portland native and actress Jane Powell was the master of ceremonies. The station&#x27;s transmitter was originally located atop Livingston Mountain, about north-northeast of Camas, Washington; this northerly site had been required to maintain minimum spacing to the unbuilt channel 3 (the future KVDO-TV) at Salem.

While it was the 25th independent in the United States, from the moment it went on air, speculation swirled that KATU might look to poach a network affiliation from one of the three other commercial stations in Portland. Rumors intensified in June 1963 as KATU began construction of a transmitter in Portland&#x27;s West Hills, which would improve its signal coverage and co-site channel 2 with the other major stations. The news came in early December when ABC announced it would drop KPTV, Oregon&#x27;s oldest television station, and move to KATU on March 1, 1964. The news led to speculation that the ABC switch to KATU, in spite of KPTV performance comparable to that of other ABC affiliates, was a countermove by the network to avoid losing Seattle&#x27;s KOMO-TV, one of the network&#x27;s few top-rated stations at the time, to a possible overture by CBS. KPTV—which had been ABC&#x27;s Portland affiliate since 1959—sued, alleging that Fisher coerced ABC into affiliating with KATU by threatening to defect in Seattle. (It was the second time KPTV had lost an affiliation to a group owner in five years; King Broadcasting Company&#x27;s KGW-TV [channel 8] displaced KPTV as the NBC television affiliate in Portland in 1959, and its KING-TV in Seattle replaced KOMO-TV in the network lineup.)

After a decade in which the station struggled to build an identity in the market, KATU began to find its way in the early 1970s after expanding its local programming. New shows such as public affairs program &quot;Town Hall&quot;, weekend children&#x27;s program &quot;Bumpity&quot;, and talk show &quot;AM Northwest&quot; proved critical to the station&#x27;s success. &quot;AM Northwest&quot; continues to air, while other shows, such as &quot;Faces &amp; Places&quot; and &quot;Two at Four&quot;, ended in the 1980s.

In 1975, KATU-TV became sister stations with Hokkaido Television Broadcasting in Sapporo, Japan, a sister city of Portland. The stations exchanged documentary footage of events in their areas.

KATU was Portland&#x27;s first commercial station to broadcast in digital, doing so in 1998 alongside Oregon Public Broadcasting. KATU shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 43, using virtual channel 2.

===Sinclair Broadcast Group ownership===
On April 10, 2013, KATU and Fisher Communications&#x27;s other holdings were acquired by the Sinclair Broadcast Group. The FCC granted its approval of the deal on August 7, and the sale was completed the following day.

On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media—owner of CW affiliate KRCW-TV (channel 32)—for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. Sinclair would have been required to sell one of KUNP or KRCW-TV if the deal were to be approved. However, in 2018, the FCC designated the deal for hearing by an administrative law judge; the deal was then terminated by Tribune.

==Local programming==
===News operation===
From the station&#x27;s first day on air, KATU produced local newscasts. As an independent, its late-night local news aired at 10 p.m. This changed after the station switched to ABC in 1964, but KATU remained mired in third place in local news coverage behind KOIN-TV and KGW-TV, which were said to have a &quot;stranglehold&quot; on Portland viewers.

One Oregon news event covered by KATU cameras in the station&#x27;s first decade on air acquired lasting notoriety. In November 1970, reporter Paul Linnman, who worked at KATU from 1967 to 1972 before returning to the station in 1984 and retiring from TV news in 2004, traveled to Florence, Oregon, where a sperm whale washed ashore; its carcass was exploded unsuccessfully. The station continued to receive requests for footage years after the event and has since commemorated anniversaries of the exploding whale, including a news special in 1995 and a remaster of the original newsfilm in 2020. The 4K remaster was conducted by the Oregon Historical Society, which has held the original film in its collection since the 1980s.

In 1975, Richard Ross left KGW-TV after 19 years to become the news director at channel 2. That same year, former Oregon governor Tom McCall joined KATU as commentator; prior to becoming governor, he had also worked at KGW. Under Ross, the station produced such efforts as &quot;Kidwitness News&quot;, a monthly newscast for kids anchored by puppets; the station&#x27;s documentary unit won a Peabody Award in 1981. McCall&#x27;s commentaries continued appearing despite his battle with cancer leading up to his death in January 1983.

News hires at KATU in the 1980s included Jeff Gianola, who initially joined as a weekend weather presenter in 1983 and became evening anchor before defecting to KOIN in 1998, and Bill O&#x27;Reilly, the future Fox News Channel anchor whose tenure in Portland lasted less than a year due to family reasons. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s time with the station was marked by remarks about Portland being a &quot;vacation&quot; compared to his previous job in Boston, which displeased management, and an incident in which he left his paycheck in a copy machine, unwittingly divulging a six-figure salary that irked underpaid colleagues. By 1985, what had once been a five-person staff in the early days had become a 60-person news department.

KATU had worked its way up to having the top-rated newscasts in Portland by 1997, but ratings were starting to decline before Gianola&#x27;s departure for KOIN, which was responsible for leading a resurgence at that station. In 1997, the station&#x27;s general manager concocted a promotional strategy, known as the &quot;Power of 2&quot;, by which the station acquired two news helicopters, in an attempt to increase falling ratings, even though the news director had previously said helicopters were primarily a marketing tool. The campaign was produced with such secrecy that its first airing took newsroom employees by surprise. Within a month of the highly publicized debut of the second helicopter, the leased helicopter, &quot;JetRanger II&quot;, crashed and burned in November while harvesting Christmas trees.

By 2021, KATU had returned to first place in early and late evening news in total viewership, though Fox affiliate KPTV beat it out in morning news. That year, the station attracted industry attention for suspending an entire day of newscasts so the station staff could take stress management training in light of increasing burnout in television news.

=== Sports ===
On September 23, 2024, the Portland Trail Blazers announced a new television deal with Sinclair to create the Rip City Television Network, with Sinclair stations and subchannels to air the team&#x27;s games in the Portland, Seattle, Medford, Eugene, and Yakima/Tri-Cities markets. In Portland, KATU will broadcast six games on its ABC subchannel, with additional games to be aired by KATU&#x27;s 2.2 subchannel and—beginning January 1, 2025—KUNP.

<text>Paul Linnman (born January 25, 1947) is an American former television news reporter and anchor in Portland, Oregon, and radio personality in the same city. He is perhaps best known for his 1970 KATU report on the attempt by the Oregon Highway Division to dispose of a dead, beached whale by exploding it (beaches open to motor vehicles are considered state highways in Oregon). He worked for more than 30 years as a television news reporter, host and anchor, from 1967–1972 and 1978–2004. He had a talk radio show on KEX 1190 AM from 2003 to 2014, and subsequently has worked as a media consultant.

==Education==
Born in 1947, Linnman grew up in Portland and attended Wilson High School. He graduated from Portland State University, studying journalism.

==Career==
He began his broadcast career in 1967, when he was hired by Portland&#x27;s ABC affiliate, KATU. His initial stint working at KATU lasted through 1972 and included various jobs, among them news assignment editor, sports director and investigative reporter. He left the station in January 1973, to join the staff of then-new City Commissioner Mildred Schwab, as an executive assistant. At the time, he had not intended to return to broadcast journalism, he told &quot;The Oregonian&quot; in a 1978 interview.

In January 1978, he was hired by KGW, Portland&#x27;s NBC affiliate station, to replace departing co-host Dick Klinger on KGW&#x27;s local magazine program &quot;Evening&quot;, which had been broadcast every weeknight since 1975. The &quot;Evening&quot; program was replaced in September 1979 by &quot;PM Magazine&quot;, a nationally syndicated program with a similar format and local hosts with each affiliate station; Linnman also served as one of its regular co-hosts while at KGW.

Linnman left KGW in late 1983 to return to KATU, as host of a new daily one-hour afternoon local news and features program, &quot;Two at Four&quot;, scheduled to debut in January 1984. He remained with KATU for the next 20 years. In September 1987, Linnman returned to news broadcasting, when KATU made him the anchor of its 6:30 p.m. weekday newscast.

In 2003, Linnman began hosting a morning talk show on Portland radio station KEX. In August 2004, he left KATU in order to focus exclusively on his KEX radio show, which continued until 2014.

Since 2014, he has worked as a media consultant.

<text>The Secure Hash Algorithms are a family of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), including:

*[[SHA-0]]: A retronym applied to the original version of the 160-bit hash function published in 1993 under the name &quot;SHA&quot;. It was withdrawn shortly after publication due to an undisclosed &quot;significant flaw&quot; and replaced by the slightly revised version SHA-1.
*[[SHA-1]]: A 160-bit hash function which resembles the earlier MD5 algorithm. This was designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) to be part of the Digital Signature Algorithm. Cryptographic weaknesses were discovered in SHA-1, and the standard was no longer approved for most cryptographic uses after 2010.
*[[SHA-2]]: A family of two similar hash functions, with different block sizes, known as &quot;SHA-256&quot; and &quot;SHA-512&quot;. They differ in the word size; SHA-256 uses 32-bit words where SHA-512 uses 64-bit words. There are also truncated versions of each standard, known as &quot;SHA-224&quot;, &quot;SHA-384&quot;, &quot;SHA-512/224&quot; and &quot;SHA-512/256&quot;. These were also designed by the NSA.
*[[SHA-3]]: A hash function formerly called &quot;Keccak&quot;, chosen in 2012 after a public competition among non-NSA designers. It supports the same hash lengths as SHA-2, and its internal structure differs significantly from the rest of the SHA family.

The corresponding standards are FIPS PUB 180 (original SHA), FIPS PUB 180-1 (SHA-1), FIPS PUB 180-2 (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512). NIST has updated Draft FIPS Publication 202, SHA-3 Standard separate from the Secure Hash Standard (SHS).

==Comparison of SHA functions==
In the table below, &quot;internal state&quot; means the &quot;internal hash sum&quot; after each compression of a data block.


== Validation ==
All SHA-family algorithms, as FIPS-approved security functions, are subject to official validation by the CMVP (Cryptographic Module Validation Program), a joint program run by the American National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Canadian Communications Security Establishment (CSE).

<text>The Amazing Race 2 is the second season of the American reality competition show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. Hosted by Phil Keoghan, it featured eleven teams of two, each with a pre-existing relationship, competing in a race around the world to win US$1,000,000. This season visited five continents and eight countries and traveled over during thirteen legs. Starting in Pahrump, Nevada, racers traveled through Brazil, South Africa, Namibia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand before returning to the United States, traveling through Hawaii and Alaska, and finishing in the San Francisco Bay Area. The season premiered on CBS on March 11, 2002, and ended on May 15, 2002.

Lifelong friends Chris Luca and Alex Boylan were the winners of this season, while estranged couple Wil Steger and Tara Lynch finished in second place, and siblings Blake Mycoskie and Paige Mycoskie finished in third place.

==Production==
===Development and filming===

The second season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; traveled 52,000 miles in 28 days, spanning five continents and eight countries. Location scouting took place during September 2001 but was paused for a month and a half following the September 11 attacks. &quot;The Amazing Race 2&quot; featured first-time visits to Brazil, Namibia, Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong, and was the first season to travel to the continents of South America and Oceania. During pre-production, producers had planned a leg in Argentina, but cancelled it due to Argentina&#x27;s political instability after its economy failed.

<text>The &#x27; () or &#x27; (; &quot;Stone of Fál&quot;) is a stone at the Inauguration Mound () on the Hill of Tara in County Meath, Ireland, which served as the coronation stone for the King of Tara and hence High King of Ireland. It is also known as the Stone of Destiny or Speaking Stone. According to legend, all of the kings of Ireland were crowned on the stone up to Muirchertach mac Ercae, .

== Geology ==

Archibald Geikie noted resemblances to the calcareous red sandstone of which the Stone of Scone is composed; it is not currently believed the stones originated from connected quarry sites. It has also been identified as a whitish granitoid.

== Mythical origin ==

There are several different, and conflicting, legends in Irish mythology describing how the is said to have been brought to Ireland. The Lebor Gabala, dating to the eleventh century, states that it was brought in antiquity by the semi-divine race known as the Tuatha Dé Danann. The had travelled to the &quot;Northern Isles&quot; where they learned many skills and magic in its four cities Falias, Gorias, Murias and Findias. From there they travelled to Ireland bringing with them a treasure from each city – the four legendary treasures of Ireland. From Falias came the . The other three treasures are the or Sword of Light, the or Spear of Lugh and the or The Dagda&#x27;s Cauldron.

Some Scottish chroniclers, such as John of Fordun and Hector Boece from the thirteenth century, treat the the same as the Stone of Scone in Scotland. According to this account, the left Tara in AD 500 when the High King of Ireland Murtagh MacEirc loaned it to his great-uncle, Fergus (later known as Fergus the Great) for the latter&#x27;s coronation in Scotland. Fergus&#x27;s sub-kingdom, Dalriada, had by this time expanded to include the north-east part of Ulster and parts of western Scotland. Not long after Fergus&#x27;s coronation in Scotland, he and his inner circle were caught in a freak storm off the County Antrim coast in which all perished. The stone remained in Scotland, which is why Murtagh MacEirc is recorded in history as the last Irish King to be crowned on it.

However, historian William Forbes Skene commented: &quot;It is somewhat remarkable that while the Scottish legend brings the stone at Scone from Ireland, the Irish legend brings the stone at Tara from Scotland.&quot;

The , recording a tradition from early Irish literature and echoing ancient legends, reports that Lia Fáil would roar in the presence of a false king pretending to hold dominion in Ireland.

== Mythical powers ==

The was thought to be magical: when the rightful High King of Ireland put his feet on it, the stone was said to roar in joy. The stone is also credited with the power to rejuvenate the king and also to endow him with a long reign. According to , Cúchulainn split it with his sword when it failed to cry out under his protégé, Lugaid Riab nDerg — from then on it never cried out again, except under Conn of the Hundred Battles and according to legend, at the coronation of Brian Boru in 1002.

&quot;Fáil&quot; or &quot;Fàil&quot; is a word of various meanings, including &quot;fatal&quot;, of the same etymology as English fate, used interchangeably with &quot;destiny&quot;. The stone was originally called &quot;Fál&quot;, a word of obscure meaning; the &quot;Dictionary of the Irish Language&quot; distinguishes the word from five homonyms in Old Irish and Middle Irish, which have respective meanings &quot;barrier&quot;, &quot;chieftain&quot;, &quot;abundance&quot;, &quot;learning&quot;, and &quot;valley&quot;. It is from this stone the metonymically named Ireland (&quot;island of Fál&quot;), and from this became an ancient name for Ireland. The stone in turn by reverse metonymy was named &quot;[Standing] Stone of Ireland&quot;. appears as a synonym for in some Irish romantic and nationalist poetry in English in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; Aubrey Thomas de Vere&#x27;s 1863 poem is an example.

The [warrior-band] of the Fenian Cycle, though usually simply &quot;the Fianna&quot;, was sometimes poetically called &quot;Fianna of Ireland&quot;. Hence was a sobriquet for modern Irish nationalist militias; for the Irish Volunteers it was an Irish-language alternative to , and the initials FF used on their cap badge have been retained on that of the current Irish Army. In [&quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Song&quot;], the republic&#x27;s national anthem, the opening &quot;Soldiers are We&quot; is translated &quot;&quot;. For similar reasons, &quot;Fianna Fáil&quot; is the name of a major political party in the republic. The identification of the Lia Fáil with the Scottish &quot;Stone of Destiny&quot; has fostered the misapprehension that &quot;Fá[i]l&quot; means &quot;[of] Destiny&quot;, and hence is rendered &quot;Soldiers of Destiny&quot;.

== Vandalism ==

Sometime in June 2012, the stone was damaged by a hammer in 11 places. It was vandalised again in May 2014 when green and red paint was poured on the stone covering at least 50% of its surface.

The stone was vandalised again c. 6–7 February 2023 when the word &quot;Fake&quot; was spray painted on the stone.
