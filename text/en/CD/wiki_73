<text>Henning Hermann Karl Robert von Tresckow (; 10 January 1901 – 21 July 1944) was a German military officer with the rank of major general in the German Army who helped organize German resistance against Adolf Hitler. He attempted to assassinate Hitler on 13 March 1943 and drafted the Valkyrie plan for a coup against the German government. He was described by the Gestapo as the &quot;prime mover&quot; behind the plot of 20 July 1944 to assassinate Hitler. He committed suicide at Królowy Most on the Eastern Front upon learning of the plot&#x27;s failure.

==Early life==
Tresckow was born in Magdeburg into a noble family from the Brandenburg region of Prussia with 300 years of military tradition that provided the Prussian Army with 21 generals. His father, Leopold Hans Heinrich Eugen Hermann von Tresckow, later a cavalry general, had been present at Kaiser Wilhelm I&#x27;s coronation as the emperor of new German Empire at Versailles in 1871. His mother, Marie-Agnes, was the youngest daughter of Count Robert von Zedlitz-Trützschler, a Prussian Minister of Education.

He received most of his early education from tutors on his family&#x27;s remote rural estate; from 1913 to 1917, he was a student at the gymnasium in the town of Goslar. He joined the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards as an officer cadet aged 16 and became the youngest lieutenant in the Army in June 1918. In the Second Battle of the Marne, he earned the Iron Cross 2nd class for outstanding courage and independent action against the enemy. At that time Count Siegfried von Eulenberg, the commander of the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, predicted that &quot;You, Tresckow, will either become chief of the General Staff or die on the scaffold as a rebel.&quot;

==Career==

After World War I, Tresckow stayed with the famed Infantry Regiment 9 Potsdam and took part in the suppression of the Spartacist movement in January 1919, but resigned from the Weimar Republic Reichswehr Army in 1920 in order to study law and economics. He worked in a banking house and embarked on a world journey visiting Britain, France, Brazil and the eastern United States in 1924 before he had to abandon it to take care of family possessions back home. Like members of many prominent Prussian families, Tresckow married into another family with long-standing military traditions. In 1926, he married Erika von Falkenhayn, only daughter of Erich von Falkenhayn, the chief of the General Staff from 1914 to 1916, and returned to military service, being sponsored by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg. Nevertheless, he was not a typical Prussian officer. He wore his uniform only when it was absolutely required and disliked the regimentation of army life. He liked to recite Rainer Maria Rilke, and spoke several languages, including English and French.

In 1934, Tresckow began General Staff training at the War Academy and graduated as the best of the class of 1936. He was assigned to the General Staff&#x27;s 1st Department (Operations), where he worked in close contact with Generals Ludwig Beck, Werner von Fritsch, Adolf Heusinger and Erich von Manstein. 

Later in 1939 and into 1940, he served as the second general staff officer of Army Group A under Gerd von Rundstedt and Erich von Manstein, culminating in the invasion of France in the spring of 1940. Tresckow played a role in the adoption of the Manstein Plan, which proved to be successful in the French campaign. Tresckow&#x27;s former regimental comrade Rudolf Schmundt was Hitler&#x27;s chief military aide, and it was through the Tresckow-Schmundt channel that Manstein&#x27;s plan, after being rejected by Army High Command, was brought to Hitler&#x27;s attention. He is also said to have worked on developing the Manstein Plan itself as Günther Blumentritt&#x27;s deputy.
After the fall of France, he did not share the euphoria that swept Germany and brought Hitler to the peak of his popularity. In October, he said in Paris to a secretary (the future wife of Alfred Jodl), &quot;If Churchill can induce America to join in the war, we shall slowly but surely be crushed by material superiority. The most that will be left to us then will be the Electorate of Brandenburg, and I&#x27;ll be chief of the palace guard.&quot;

From 1941 to 1943, he served under Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, his wife&#x27;s cousin, and later Field Marshal Günther von Kluge as chief operations officer of the German Army Group Centre in Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. Subsequently, in October and November 1943, he served in combat as the commanding officer of Grenadier Regiment 442, defending the western bank of the Dnieper River in Ukraine. From December 1943 until his death in 1944, he served as Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army.

==Heuaktion==
As Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army, Tresckow signed an order on 28 June 1944 carrying out a plan originally conceived by Himmler, to abduct supposedly unaccompanied Polish and Ukrainian children in the so-called Heuaktion (Hay Action). Between 40,000 and 50,000 Polish and Ukrainian children aged 10 to 14 were kidnapped for Nazi Germany&#x27;s forced labour programme. The order read in part &quot;In operations against gangs, any boys and girls taken between ages 10 and 13 who are physically healthy, and whose parents either cannot be located or who, as persons unable to work, are to be sent to the area earmarked for remaining families (the dregs are to be sent to the Reich).&quot;

The kidnapped children were used as forced workers in the Todt organisation, Junkers factories and in German handicrafts as part of an operation to &quot;lower biological strength&quot; of the enemies of Nazi Germany.

Kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany has been classified by the Nuremberg Tribunal as part of a systematic programme of genocide. Alfred Rosenberg, who also signed the documents for Heu Aktion, was found guilty by the Nuremberg Tribunal, and his signing of the document was mentioned in the final verdict.

==Opposition to Adolf Hitler==
Although initially supportive of Hitler because of his own opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, Tresckow was quickly disillusioned by 1934 by the events of the Night of the Long Knives (30 June to 2 July 1934) as well as its violence against the Jewish population. 

In 1938, the Blomberg–Fritsch affair further strengthened his antipathy to the Nazis. He regarded the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, a state-sanctioned, nationwide pogrom of Jews, as personal humiliation and degradation of civilization.

He therefore sought out civilians and officers who opposed Hitler, such as Erwin von Witzleben, who dissuaded Tresckow from resigning from the Army, arguing that they would be needed when the day of reckoning came. By the summer of 1939, he told Fabian von Schlabrendorff that &quot;both duty and honor demand from us that we should do our best to bring about the downfall of Hitler and National Socialism to save Germany and Europe from barbarism.&quot;
In the campaign against the Soviet Union, Tresckow resumed his resistance activities with renewed urgency. He was appalled by the Commissar Order, of which he said:
Remember this moment. If we don&#x27;t convince the field marshal (Fedor von Bock) to fly to Hitler at once and have these orders (Commissar Order) canceled, the German people will be burdened with a guilt the world will not forget in a hundred years. This guilt will fall not only on Hitler, Himmler, Göring, and their comrades but on you and me, your wife and mine, your children and mine, that woman crossing the street, and those children over there playing ball.
He was likewise incensed by the treatment of Russian prisoners of war, and in particular by the mass shootings of Jewish women and children by the Einsatzgruppen behind the lines. When Tresckow learned about the massacre of thousands of Jews at Borisov, he appealed passionately to Field Marshal Fedor von Bock: &quot;Never may such a thing happen again! And so we must act now. We have the power in Russia!&quot;

Army Group Centre staff included Lieutenant Colonel Georg Schulze-Büttger, Colonel Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff, Major Carl-Hans Graf von Hardenberg, Lieutenant Heinrich Graf von Lehndorff-Steinort, Lieutenant Fabian von Schlabrendorff, Lieutenant Philipp Freiherr von Boeselager and his brother Georg Freiherr von Boeselager, Lieutenant Colonel Hans-Alexander von Voss and Lieutenant Colonel Berndt von Kleist among others, many of them from Tresckow&#x27;s old Infantry Regiment 9. The headquarters of Army Group Centre thus emerged as the new nerve center of Army resistance.

At the end of September 1941, Tresckow sent his special operations officer Schlabrendorff to Berlin to contact opposition groups and declare that the staff of Army Group Centre was &quot;prepared to do anything.&quot; This approach, made at the height of German expansion and the nadir of anti-Hitler opposition, represented the first initiative to come from the front and from the Army, as Ulrich von Hassell noted in his diary. Schlabrendorff continued to serve as liaison between Army Group Centre and opposition circle around General Ludwig Beck, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler and Colonel Hans Oster, the deputy head of Abwehr (German military intelligence) who was involved in a 1938 coup attempt against Hitler (Oster Conspiracy). Oster&#x27;s recruitment of General Friedrich Olbricht, head of the General Army Office headquarters, in 1942 linked this asset to Tresckow&#x27;s resistance group in Army Group Centre, creating a viable coup apparatus.

==Plots against Hitler==

It was decided that Tresckow&#x27;s group would assassinate Hitler and thereby provide the &#x27;spark&#x27; for the coup, which Olbricht would direct from Berlin. In late 1942, Olbricht indicated that he still needed about eight weeks to complete preparations for the coup. Shortly thereafter, Tresckow traveled to Berlin to discuss the few remaining questions and emphasize that time was running short. In the winter of 1943, Olbricht declared: &quot;We are ready. The spark can now be set off.&quot; Tresckow assured the conspirators that he would take action at the first available opportunity.

It came on 13 March 1943, when Hitler finally visited troops on the Eastern Front at Smolensk after a few cancellations and postponements. Under the initial plan, a group of officers were to shoot Hitler collectively at a signal in the officers&#x27; mess during lunch but Kluge, commander of Army Group Centre, who had been informed about the plot, urged Tresckow not to carry it out saying, &quot;For heaven&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t do anything today! It&#x27;s still too soon for that!&quot; He argued that the German army and people were not ready to accept the coup and would not understand such an act. He also feared a civil war between the Army and SS, since Heinrich Himmler had canceled his visit and could not be killed at the same time.

Tresckow, however, had a backup plan. During the lunch in question, he asked Lieutenant Colonel Heinz Brandt, who was travelling with Hitler, whether he would be good enough to take a bottle of Cointreau to Colonel Helmuth Stieff (who was not yet a conspirator at that time) at Hitler&#x27;s headquarters in East Prussia as a payment for a lost bet. Brandt readily agreed. The &quot;Cointreau&quot; was actually a bomb constructed of a British plastic explosive &quot;Plastic C&quot; placed into the casing of a British magnetic mine, with a timer consisting of a spring which would be gradually dissolved by acid. Before Hitler&#x27;s Condor plane was to take off, Schlabrendorff activated the 30-minute fuse and handed the package to Brandt, who boarded Hitler&#x27;s plane. After takeoff, a message was sent to the other Berlin conspirators by code that Operation Flash was under way, which they expected to take place around Minsk. Yet when Hitler landed safely at his East Prussian headquarters, it became obvious that the bomb had failed to detonate (the extremely low temperatures in the unheated luggage compartment probably prevented the fuse from working). The message of failure was quickly sent out and Schlabrendorff retrieved the package to prevent discovery of the plot.

A week later, on 21 March, Army Group Centre organised a display of Russian Army flags and weapons seized at the Eastern Front. It was exhibited at Zeughaus, military museum in Berlin, which Hitler was to visit on Heroes&#x27; Memorial Day with Himmler and Hermann Göring. Colonel Gersdorff volunteered to be the suicide bomber, intending to explode a bomb on his person near Hitler while serving as a tour guide. He had with him bombs with ten-minute fuses, knowing that Hitler was scheduled to be in the museum for 30 minutes. But at the last minute, just before Hitler was to arrive, the duration of his stay was reduced to just eight minutes as a security precaution. Hitler breezed through in two minutes. As a result, Gersdorff could not accomplish his mission, the assassination plan failed again, and he barely managed to get out and defuse the bombs.

Other plots similarly failed because of Hitler&#x27;s irregular habits. Most importantly, they had no access to Hitler since he no longer visited the front, rarely visited Berlin and spent most of his time at the Wolf&#x27;s Lair in East Prussia or the Berghof in Bavaria. Tresckow lacked the required clearance to enter either site and the extremely high security made any attempt impractical and unlikely to succeed. The elimination of Oster&#x27;s group in April 1943 (his deputy Hans von Dohnanyi and Lutheran theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer were arrested, and Oster was placed under house arrest) was a further setback.

Tresckow worked tirelessly to persuade army commanders such as Field Marshals Fedor von Bock, Günther von Kluge and Erich von Manstein to join in the conspiracy without much success. With unwitting help from Schmundt, he placed like-minded officers as their adjutants and staff officers to bring them closer to the conspiracy. Kluge sympathised with the conspirators and at times seemed ready to act, only to become indecisive at critical moments. Others refused outright, Manstein declaring, &quot;Prussian field marshals do not mutiny.&quot; Nonetheless, no-one reported their treasonable activities to the SS.
==Operation Valkyrie==
Eventually, the conspirators came to rely more on the Reserve Army in Berlin and other districts to stage a coup against the German government. Olbricht now put forward a new strategy for staging a coup against Hitler. The Reserve Army had an operational plan called Operation &quot;Walküre&quot; (Valkyrie), which was to be used in the event that the disruption caused by the Allied bombing of German cities caused a breakdown in law and order, or an uprising by the millions of slave laborers from occupied countries now being used in German factories. Olbricht suggested that this plan could be used to mobilize the Reserve Army to take control of German cities, disarm the SS and arrest the Nazi leadership once Hitler had been assassinated. During August and September 1943, Tresckow took extended sick leave in Berlin to draft the &quot;revised&quot; Valkyrie plan with fine details and precise timetables. Revised orders and additional proclamations that would pin the blame for the uprising on the Nazi party were typed by Tresckow&#x27;s wife, Erika, and his secretary, Countess Margarete von Oven, who wore gloves so as not to leave fingerprints. These 1943 papers were recovered by the Soviets after the war and finally published in 2007, showing Tresckow&#x27;s central role in the conspiracy and the idealistic motivations of the resistance group at that time. Knowledge of the Jewish Holocaust was a major impetus for many officers involved.

But when Tresckow was assigned to command of a battalion on the Eastern Front in October 1943, he was no longer in position to actively plan or effect the coup. Even his promotion a month later to Chief of Staff of the Second Army did not bring him much closer. To gain access to Hitler, he proposed to his old comrade General Rudolf Schmundt, Hitler&#x27;s chief adjutant and Army personnel chief, to create a new department of psychological and political warfare to evaluate data and make reports directly to the Führer. Schmundt, who was still well disposed toward his old friend but suspected that Tresckow disapproved of the Führer, quietly let the matter drop. Tresckow also applied to become General Adolf Heusinger&#x27;s delegate in the Army High Command (OKH) during the latter&#x27;s two-month leave, which would also give him access to Hitler&#x27;s meetings, but Heusinger, who was earlier approached by conspirators, rejected it apparently for the same reason.

Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, who met Tresckow in August 1943 and worked together on revising Operation Valkyrie, took the responsibility for planning and implementing Hitler&#x27;s assassination. By the time Stauffenberg was appointed Chief of Staff of the Reserve Army and was ready to carry out the assassination attempt, the Allies had already landed in Normandy. When Stauffenberg sent a message to Tresckow through Lehndorff to ask whether there was any point in making the attempt since there was no practical purpose to be served, Tresckow urged him not only to attempt the assassination but to go ahead with the coup in Berlin even if the assassination were to fail. He argued that there must be an overt act of German opposition to Hitler regardless of the consequences. He also told Philipp von Boeselager and Margarete von Oven that 16,000 people were being killed daily not as casualties of war but from being murdered by the Nazis, and Hitler had to be killed just to put an end to it. A few days before the coup attempt, Tresckow confided to a friend that &quot;in all likelihood everything will go wrong&quot;. When asked whether the action was necessary nonetheless, he replied, &quot;Yes, even so.&quot;

==Death==
When the assassination attempt on Hitler and the following coup in Berlin (the 20 July plot) had failed, Tresckow decided to commit suicide at the front in Królowy Most near Białystok on 21 July. His parting words to Schlabrendorff were: 
To protect other conspirators, he staged an appearance of partisan attack by firing his pistols before detonating a grenade below his chin. He was buried in the family home in Wartenberg. When the Nazis learned about his connections to Operation Valkyrie in late August, his body was exhumed and taken to the crematorium in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. His wife was arrested on 15 August, and her children taken away under the Nazi policy of &quot;Sippenhaft&quot; (shared family guilt); however, early in October she was released and survived the war.
==Personal life==
In 1926, Tresckow married Erika von Falkenhayn, the daughter of Prussian general Erich von Falkenhayn and his wife, Ida ( Selkmann). General von Falkenhayn served as Prussian Minister of War during World War I as well as Chief of German General Staff. Tresckow and von Falkenhayn had four children, Mark, born 1927, Rüdiger, born 1928, Uta, born 1931 and Adelheid, born 1939.

After his suicide, his wife and daughters were arrested. His sons were already serving in the military. Mark would die in military service in 1945, almost a year after his father&#x27;s suicide. The daughters were detained in a children&#x27;s home in Bad Sachsa, Germany, together with several other children of the leaders of the 20 July plot.

<text>Fußballklub Austria Wien AG (), known in English as Austria Vienna, and Austria Wien in German-speaking countries, is an Austrian professional association football club from the capital city of Vienna. It has won the most trophies of any Austrian club from the top flight, with 24 Austrian Bundesliga titles and 27 Austrian Cup titles. Austria is one of only two teams that have never been relegated from the Austrian top flight. With 27 victories in the Austrian Cup and six in the Austrian Supercup, Austria Wien is also the most successful club in each of those tournaments. The club reached the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final in 1978, and the semi-finals of the European Cup the season after. The club plays at the Franz Horr Stadium, known as the Generali Arena since a 2010 naming rights deal with an Italian insurance company.

==History==
===Foundation to World War II===
FK Austria Wien has its roots in Wiener Cricketer, established on 20 October 1910 in Vienna. The club was renamed Wiener Amateur-SV in December of that year and adopted the name Fußballklub Austria Wien on 28 November 1926.

The team claimed its first championship title in 1924. Wiener Amateur changed its name to Austria Wien in 1926 as the amateurs became professionals. The club won its second league title that year.

The 1930s, one of Austria Wien&#x27;s most successful eras, brought two titles (1933 and 1936) in the Mitropa Cup, a tournament for champions in Central Europe. The star of that side was forward Matthias Sindelar, who was voted in 1998 as the greatest Austrian footballer.

The club&#x27;s success was interrupted by the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, with Austria taunted as &quot;&quot;Judenklub&quot;. While Jewish players and staff at the club were killed or fled the country, Sindelar died under unresolved circumstances on 23 January 1939 of carbon monoxide poisoning in his apartment. He had refused to play for the combined Germany–Austria national team, citing injury (bad knees) and retirement from international matches. The club was part of the top-flight regional Gauliga Ostmark in German competition from 1938 to 1945, but never finished higher than fourth. They participated in the Tschammerpokal (the predecessor to the modern-day DFB-Pokal) in 1938 and 1941. Nazi sports authorities directed that the team change its name to Sportclub Ostmark Wien in an attempt to Germanize it on 12 April 1938, but the club re-adopted its historical identity almost immediately on 14 July 1938.

===Post-World War II===
Austria Wien won its first league title for 23 years in 1949, and retained it the following year. It later won a fifth title in 1953. The club won three-straight titles in 1961, 1962 and 1963. Forward Ernst Ocwirk, who played in five league title-winning sides in two separate spells at the club, managed the side to 1969 and 1970 Bundesliga titles. Other players of this era included Horst Nemec.

From the 1973–74 season, Wiener AC formed a joint team with FK Austria Wien, which was called FK Austria WAC Wien until 1976–77, when Austria Wien opted to revert to their own club&#x27;s traditional name. The results of the joint team are part of the Austria Wien football history. From 1977 onwards, Austria Tabakwerke took over the sponsorship and Austria was competed under the new name Austria-Memphis.

The 1970s saw the beginning of another successful era, despite no league title between 1970 and 1976 as an aging squad was rebuilt. Eight league titles in eleven seasons from 1975–76 to 1985–86 reasserted its dominance. After winning the 1977 Austrian Cup, Austria Wien reached the 1978 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final, which they lost 4–0 to Belgian club Anderlecht. The following season, the club reached the semi-finals of the European Cup, losing 1–0 on aggregate to Swedish team Malmö FF. In 1982–83, Austria Wien reached the semi-finals of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, losing 5–3 on aggregate to Real Madrid.

Players at Austria Wien in this era included Herbert &quot;Schneckerl&quot;&quot; Prohaska, Felix Gasselich, Thomas Parits, Walter Schachner, Gerhard Steinkogler, Toni Polster, Peter Stöger, Ivica Vastić and Tibor Nyilasi.

===Recent history===

At the start of the 1990s, Austria Wien enjoyed its most recent period of sustained success: three-straight Bundesliga titles from 1991 to 1993; three Austrian Cup titles in 1990, 1992 and 1994; and four Austrian Supercup titles in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994. However, the club declined in the late 1990s due to financial problems which forced key players to be sold.

Austria Wien was taken over by Austro–Canadian billionaire Frank Stronach&#x27;s Magna auto-parts consortium in 1999. Following deals with the Memphis cigarette company, the club was renamed FK Austria Memphis Magna. Stronach&#x27;s investment in players, with a budget three times larger than the average in the league, saw a first Bundesliga title for ten years in 2002–03. Despite this, head coach Walter Schachner was fired. Although his replacement Christoph Daum could not retain the league title, he won the Austrian Cup.

In 2004, Memphis was dropped from the club&#x27;s name. Austria Wien reached the UEFA Cup quarter-final in 2004–05, where they were eliminated by Parma. On 21 November 2005, Frank Stonach withdrew from the club. Consequently, several players (including top scorer Roland Linz, Vladimír Janočko, Joey Didulica, Libor Sionko, Filip Šebo and Sigurd Rushfeldt) were sold to other teams the following summer. The 2005–06 season nonetheless concluded with a Bundesliga and Cup double.

The loss of key players and a much lower budget for the 2006–07 season saw the club suffer. Despite losing 4–1 on aggregate to Benfica in the preliminary round of the UEFA Champions League, the team managed to qualify (against Legia Warsaw winning 2–1 on aggregate) for the group phase of the UEFA Cup. Former player and coach Thomas Parits became general manager. After the side lost three days later 4–0 away to Red Bull Salzburg, Partis terminated coaches Peter Stöger and Frank Schinkels. Georg Zellhofer replaced them. The season saw a sixth-place finish in the Bundesliga despite being in last place at Christmas. However, the club also won the Cup that year. The side improved the following season, finishing in third in the league.
The summer of 2008 brought notable changes. Twelve players left the club, including Sanel Kuljić and Yüksel Sariyar, who joined Frank Stronach&#x27;s newly founded team FC Magna in Austria&#x27;s second division. The &quot;Betriebsführervertrag&quot; (&quot;operating contract&quot;) with Stronach&#x27;s Magna company expired, letting the club reorganize. On 1 July 2008, the original name FK Austria Wien was reinstated, without a sponsor&#x27;s name included for the first time in 30 years. The club also bought Chinese international Sun Xiang, the first Chinese player to play in the Bundesliga. In the 2012–13 season, Austria Wien won its 24th league title, ahead of holders Red Bull Salzburg, but lost the Austrian Cup final 1–0 to third-tier club FC Pasching.

In August 2013, Austria Wien qualified to the UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time after defeating Dinamo Zagreb in the play-offs round. They were drawn against Porto, Atlético Madrid and Zenit Saint Petersburg, all of which have won European trophies in the 21st century. Austria finished last in the group after a loss to Porto at home (0–1), a draw against Zenit in Saint Petersburg (0–0), two losses against Atlético and an away draw against Porto, which eventually put the Portuguese side to the third place in the group. A consolation came when Austria defeated Zenit 4–1 at Ernst-Happel-Stadion.

==Stadium==
Austria Wien plays its home games at the Franz Horr Stadium, which has had a capacity of 17,000 since 2008, when a new two-tiered East Stand opened and renovations were made to the West Stand. The stadium was renamed the Generali Arena in a naming-rights deal with Italian insurer Generali announced at the end of 2010.

The stadium was originally built in 1925 for Slovan Vienna, a Czech immigrants&#x27; club, and was largely destroyed by the Allies in World War II. Austria Wien moved into the ground in 1973, playing its first match there on 26 August. The stadium was subsequently named for Franz Horr, chairman of the Viennese FA, following his death. The stadium was expanded with new or renovated stands in 1982, 1986, 1998 and, most recently, 2008.

==Rivalries==
Austria Wien contests the Vienna derby with Rapid Wien. The two clubs are two of the most supported and successful in the country, and are the only Austrian clubs to have never been relegated. They are two of the most culturally and socially significant clubs, both historically representing wider divisions in Viennese society. Both teams originate from Hietzing, the 13th district in the west of the city, but have since moved into different districts. Austria Wien is seen as a middle-class club, and before World War II, as part of the coffeehouse culture associated with the capital&#x27;s intelligentsia. Rapid traditionally holds the support of the city&#x27;s working class. The two clubs first met in a league championship match on 8 September 1911, a 4–1 victory for Rapid. The fixture is the most-played derby in European football after the Old Firm match in Glasgow and the Edinburgh derby in Edinburgh, both in Scotland.

<doc id="895580" wikidata="Q7332084" url="?curid=895580" title="Ricky Gutiérrez">
<text>Ricardo Gutiérrez (born May 23, 1970) is an American former shortstop in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played from through for the San Diego Padres (1993-), Houston Astros (-), Chicago Cubs (-), Cleveland Indians (-), New York Mets () and Boston Red Sox (2004). He batted and threw right-handed. He was also the only Houston Astros player to get a base hit in Kerry Wood&#x27;s 20-strikeout game.

==Background==
Gutiérrez was the Baltimore Orioles&#x27; second pick in the 1988 MLB Draft, the second of four compensatory supplemental selections between the first two rounds (28th overall). After falling behind Manny Alexander on the organization&#x27;s depth chart at shortstop, Gutiérrez was sent to San Diego on September 4, 1992 to complete a transaction made four days earlier on August 31 when Erik Schullstrom was also dealt to the Padres for Craig Lefferts. Listed at 6&#x27;1&quot;, 195 pounds, Gutiérrez started his career at shortstop and became a valuable utility player later in his career. In the field, he had decent range and an above-average arm. He was a sharp line-drive hitter, and spent most of his career in the National League.

His most productive season came in 2001 with the Cubs, when he posted career-highs in batting average (.290), RBI (66), runs (76), hits (153) and games played (147). He finished the year leading the National League in sacrifice hits (17). He also had the fourth most sacrifice flies in the league (11), and was tenth in singles (117).

==Boston Red Sox==
On July 21, 2004, the Boston Red Sox acquired Gutiérrez from the Chicago Cubs for a player to be named later or cash considerations. Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein lauded Gutiérrez as &quot;a veteran with a tremendous makeup ... he&#x27;ll fit in well as a utility guy for us.&quot; Gutiérrez wore number 16, the same number as other Red Sox players such as Jim Lonborg, Hank Johnson, Dave Sax and Bob Zupcic. His greatest offensive performance came on August 28, 2004 versus the Detroit Tigers. Gutiérrez, who filled in at second base while Mark Bellhorn took over at third for Bill Mueller, went 3 for 4 with a two-run single with the bases loaded in the fifth inning. Teammate Alan Embree was in awe: &quot;He&#x27;s been sitting a long time, to come off the bench and contribute like he did tonight was incredible.&quot;

After winning the World Series, Gutiérrez carried an industrial-sized broom to remind victory parade goers of the final tally (a 4-0 &quot;sweep&quot; of the St. Louis Cardinals). While with the Red Sox, Gutiérrez was a .275 hitter (11-for-40) with 3 RBI in 21 games, including 6 runs, 1 double, 1 stolen base, and a .310 on-base percentage. The Red Sox were 14-7 in games in which Gutiérrez appeared. Over an 11-season career, Gutiérrez was a .268 hitter (967-for-3632) with 38 home runs and 357 RBI in 1074 games, including 463 runs, 138 doubles, 25 triples, 49 stolen bases, and a .338 on-base percentage.

==Personal life==
Gutiérrez&#x27;s nephew, James Jones, played in the National Basketball Association, and currently serves as the general manager for the Phoenix Suns. Gutiérrez is currently the third base coach of the Washington Nationals.

<doc id="895584" wikidata="Q7150467" url="?curid=895584" title="Paul Edwards (politician)">
<text>Paul Edwards (born February 21, 1961) is a Manitoba politician and lawyer. He served as leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party from 1993 to 1996.

Edwards was born in Kingston, Ontario and was educated at Trent University and Queen&#x27;s University. He later worked as a barrister and solicitor.

In the 1988 Manitoba general election, Edwards was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the Winnipeg riding of St. James, defeating his closest competitor, Progressive Conservative Jae Eadie, by 579 votes. He joined 19 other Liberals in forming the official opposition to the PC minority government led by Premier Gary Filmon.

The 1988 election was a landmark for the Manitoba Liberal Party, in that it had previously been reduced to a marginal presence in the province. The unpopularity of Howard Pawley&#x27;s New Democratic government in 1988 had given the party the support of many centre-left voters, and many believed that the Liberals had a chance to form government in the next election. This did not occur. The New Democratic Party recovered under Gary Doer&#x27;s leadership, and the Liberals were reduced to only seven seats (out of 57) in the election of 1990. Edwards was re-elected in St. James, this time defeating PC candidate Joanne Thibault by 295 votes.

Liberal leader Sharon Carstairs was blamed by many in the party for squandering a chance to form government, and resigned as party leader in 1993. Subsequently, Edwards defeated MLA Kevin Lamoureux to become the party&#x27;s new leader.

The Liberals initially appeared to have a reasonable chance of winning the 1995 election, placing a strong second to the Tories in early polls. They ran a poor campaign, however, and the NDP overtook them well before election day. The Liberals fell to three seats in the election of 1995: Lamoureux was re-elected in his constituency of Inkster, as were Neil Gaudry in St. Boniface and Gary Kowalski in The Maples. In another close race in St. James, Edwards lost to NDP challenger MaryAnn Mihychuk by 166 votes. He announced his resignation as party leader later in 1995. He formally resigned in 1996, and subsequently returned to a legal practice.

Edwards is married to Anne MacKay. They have four children: Beth, Evan, Wynn and Adam.

<doc id="895585" wikidata="Q388972" url="?curid=895585" title="FC Metalurh Donetsk">
<text>Football Club Metalurh Donetsk (, ) was a Ukrainian professional football club based in Donetsk that went bankrupt in July 2015.

== History ==
===Club predecessor===
Football came to the Donetsk region in the time of the Russian Empire when the industrialization of the country began. Numerous foreigners, particularly British workers, were forming their own football teams. In September 1911, at the factory of &quot;Novorossiysk Association&quot; (currently the Donetsk Steel Works Factory – DMZ) owned by John Hughes has created the Yuzovka Sports Society (YuSO) which contained a football club as well. The football club became one of the founders of the Donbas football league based out of Kramatorsk in 1913. The football team existed until 1919 and was liquidated due to the Russian Civil War. In the 1920s, the factory (known at time as Lenin Steel Works) revived the club as part of its own Lenin Sports Club which later carried the name of FC Metalists Stalino. One of the most prominent players of that period was Viktor Shylovsky who later became famous, however, playing for Dynamo Kyiv.

In 1929 based on the team in Stalino (today Donetsk) was created FC Dynamo Stalino. In 1936 based on FC Dynamo Stalino and FC Dynamo Horlivka there was created a united team of Donbas &quot;Vuhilnyky Stalino&quot; that participated in a spring football championship of 1936 in Group V (precursor of the Soviet Second League). During the season the club moved to Stalino (Donetsk) and changed its name to FC Stakhanovets Stalino.

=== Shakhtar Shakhtarsk ===

&quot;Metalurh&quot; takes its roots from the Football Club Prometei Shakhtarsk that was allowed to participate on the non-amateur level once Ukraine attained its independence. After a disappointing first season in the Second League, in the 1993 season &quot;Promotei&quot; placed fifth in the Third League and was promoted back to the Second League when the third place Antratsyt withdrew from competitions. Due to being sponsored by a Medita health clinic of Oleksandr Opryshchenko, in 1993 the club was renamed as Medita Shakhtarsk. However, in 1995 the club&#x27;s owner was killed and Promotei returned under ownership of the state coal-mining company &quot;Shakhtarantratsyt&quot; under the name of Shakhtar Shakhtarsk.

=== Metalurh Donetsk ===
In 1996 a team of the Donetsk Metallurgical Factory replaced the insolvent FC Shakhtar Shakhtarsk during the 1995–96 season under the name of Shakhtar. In summer 1996 the Donetsk Regional Football Federation agreed to hand over the Shakhtar&#x27;s past season achievements to the newly formed and already widely accepted Football Club Metalurh Donetsk. After placing second in the &quot;Druha Liha&quot; Group C, the club gained the promotion to the &quot;Persha Liha&quot;. In the next season, 1996–97, Metalurh won the &quot;Persha Liha&quot; championship and were promoted to the &quot;Vyscha Liha&quot;.

The club successfully started in the Top League and also improved significantly at the domestic Cup competition. Metalurh has obtained a few bronze medals in the league and since 1998 made through to at least the quarter-finals of the Ukrainian Cup. The club financially struggled between 1999 and 2001 being kept afloat by individual efforts of Mykhailo Lyashko and Vladyslav Helzin, who both in 2001 decided to create their own club (see FC Olimpik Donetsk).
In 2001 Metalurh was purchased by ISD, Ukrainian industrial corporation owned by Serhiy Taruta, one of the most wealthy businessmen in Ukraine and Europe. Throughout majority of the first decade of the new millennium, Metalurh&#x27;s owners developed a close working relationship with well-known Ukrainian agent Dmytro Sylyuk, who soon became club&#x27;s acting chairman and who gained much bad publicity for bringing so many foreign players into the club that they outnumbered domestic players. Many were brought in without the manager&#x27;s consent, and were given overly generous pay, among them Yaya Touré, Andrés Mendoza, and Jordi Cruyff. Furthermore, while working with Metalurh, Selyuk lived in Barcelona and was a rare visitor to Ukraine. After Sylyuk&#x27;s questionable signings, he was dismissed from his position and the majority of the players brought in by him also left. It later appeared that many of them had contracts with Sylyuk and not directly with the club.

After the era of Sylyuk ended, Metalurh&#x27;s performance declined and a hunt for medals turned into a struggle for survival. However, in 2008, Bulgarian specialist Nikolay Kostov was brought in to rebuild the team. In his first season with the club, Kostov turned Metalurh&#x27;s performance around and the club finished fourth in the league, which won them a spot in newly formed UEFA Europa League.

=== Bankruptcy and merger ===

Because of the war situation in the East Ukraine, on 17 June 2015, the Industrial Union of Donbas decided to merge both its clubs FC Metalurh Donetsk and FC Stal Kamianske. The new club was to be primarily based on the Kamianske team and to continue its participation under the name of FC Stal Kamianske. A number of Metalurh players, including Đorđe Lazić, Gabriel Araújo Carvalho, and Oleksandr Bandura, as well as members of the club&#x27;s staff, such as Erik van der Meer and Vardan Israeltian, moved to Stal. However, on 11 July 2015 Metalurh declared bankruptcy, citing the economic difficulties caused by the fighting, although FC Stal Kamianske did indeed take its place in the Ukrainian Premier League.

== Stadium ==
Metalurh has its own small stadium named after the club, Metalurh Stadium. For most domestic matches the club played at this stadium, which has a capacity barely in excess of 5,000. For games expected to draw a significantly larger crowd, Metalurh played at Shakhtar Stadium, owned by Shakhtar Donetsk, and mostly used for European competitions. A new stadium for Metalurh with a capacity of 17,500 was planned to be built in Makiivka, near Donetsk.

In the 2014–15 season, the club played their home games at Obolon Arena in Kyiv due to the war in Donbas.

== Rivalry ==
Metalurh&#x27;s top rival is the neighboring club, and one of Ukraine&#x27;s most successful teams, Shakhtar Donetsk. The two clubs have not only had a close history since the formation of Metalurh, but Metalurh has also played home games at Shakhtar&#x27;s former venue, Shakhtar Stadium. The games between the two clubs have been dubbed by the fans and the media as the Donbas Derby. Shakhtar has been dominant in the rivalry from 1996 to 2006, winning all 18 matches between them.

<text>Idrottsföreningen Elfsborg, more commonly known as IF Elfsborg or simply Elfsborg (), is a professional football club based in Borås, Sweden, and is affiliated to the Västergötlands Fotbollförbund. They play in the Allsvenskan and have spent most of their history in the top tier of Swedish football. Their homeground is Borås Arena, where they have played since 17 April 2005.

The club was founded in 1904 by a group of 19 youngsters which all were 14–15 years old. &quot;Borås Fotbollslag&quot; was formed in Ordenshuset at Landala (today Knalleland) on 26 June 1904. The main protagonist in the formation, Carl Larson, who in addition to football also practiced athletics and wrestling, claimed the reason was that the main sports club in the city, Borås Athletic and Sports Society, would not exert football in their program.

Carl Larson, however, found that there were too many clubs containing the city name Borås which contributed to the name change in 1906 by Riksidrottsförbundet to the current, IF Elfsborg. The name is derived from Älvsborg County where instead of making use of the modern spelling Älvsborg, they used the older spelling with an &quot;E&quot;. The same goes for the club colours, reflected in their crest and kit, yellow and black. Colours that are taken from Älvsborg Regiment, Elfsborg would not only represent a city but a whole region. A recurring motto of the club is &quot;Vi Tillsammans&quot; (We together).

The club&#x27;s homeground Borås Arena is also called &quot;Elfsborg Fortress&quot;, since Elfsborg is Allsvenskan home strongest team in the 2000s (decade). It is one of two teams in Allsvenskan that has won against the Sweden national team with 2–1 in the opening ceremony of Ryavallen (the other team is AIK 1979 with 3–2) and one of only two teams to win Allsvenskan as newcomers in 1961, the other team was Östers IF in 1968. Elfsborg have repeatedly participated for the qualifier to Champions League, Europa League and was as late as 2007 in 2007–08 UEFA Cup and was one of the co-winners in 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup the following year.
The club have won six national championships, the latest in 2012, and three national cups.
==History==

Borås Fotbollslag was formed on 26 June 1904, by a group of youngsters. In 1906 the name was changed to IF Elfsborg, because the founders felt there were too many teams with &#x27;Borås&#x27; in their name. In 1926 Elfsborg won Västsvenska Serien, and defeated Halmstad BK in the play-off, and was promoted to Allsvenskan for the first time. During the 1930s Elfsborg built a very strong team led by striker Sven Jonasson, who appeared in both the 1934 and 1938 World Cup. In 1936 Elfsborg won Allsvenskan for the first time, and two more titles followed soon after (1939 and 1940). During this period Elfsborg had as many as seven players in the Sweden national team.

The club also fielded a bandy team for decades. In 1920, 1924, 1927, 1932, 1934, and 1938, IF Elfsborg won the Västergötland bandy district championship.

In 1941 Elfsborg left Ramnavallen to play their home games at the newly constructed Ryavallen. The first game at the new ground was supposed to be a friendly between Sweden and Finland, but Finland&#x27;s involvement in the Second World War prevented them from playing, so they were replaced by Elfsborg, who beat Sweden 2–1.

In the mid-1940s Elfsborg came close to claiming Allsvenskan again, but finished second three consecutive seasons. By the late 1940s, Elfsborg&#x27;s glory days were sparse, and the club would relegated in 1954.

In 1960 Elfsborg won promotion after an impressive season with 20 wins in 22 games, and the club won Allsvenskan for the fourth time in 1961, becoming the first Swedish team to go straight from the second level to becoming champions. This was under the leadership of the legendary Sven Andreasson as chairman.

In 1977 Elfsborg reached second place, but the following years proved difficult for the club. In 1987 Elfsborg finished last in Allsvenskan, and did not return to the top flight until 1997. The team that won promotion contained several future Swedish internationals including Anders Svensson and Tobias Linderoth. Even though Elfsborg won their first two cup titles (in 2001 and 2003), the club struggled to stay in Allsvenskan in the following years.

In 2005 Elfsborg spent a lot of money on building Borås Arena, and bringing back former players. The investments paid off and the fifth Championship was won in 2006 – the club&#x27;s first Allsvenskan title for 41 years. The year after Elfsborg appeared in the Champions League qualifying stage for the first time, and subsequently reached the group stage in the UEFA Cup for the first time. On the way there they knocked out Linfield FC (Northern Ireland) and Debreceni VSC (Hungary) in the qualification stage of the Champions League before eventually being eliminated themselves by the hands of Valencia CF (Spain) in the last round. The club won the last round of qualifications for the Uefa Cup against FC Dinamo București (Romania).

In the group stage IF Elfsborg faced AC Fiorentina and Villarreal away and AEK Athens and FK Mladá Boleslav at Borås Arena and was knocked out.

In the following years, IF Elfsborg under the guidance of coach Magnus Haglund and his 4-2-3-1-formation have established themselves as a top club in Swedish football. The clearly stated ambition to finish top 4, qualifying for European football every year. In 2007, the club finished 4th securing a place in the last edition of the Intertoto-cup, from which they advanced but was surprisingly knocked out by St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic F.C. in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Cup after conceding late goals in both legs.

The team bounced back though, competing for the title again until the very last round of 2008. In the end, injuries to key players like Anders Svensson and Stefan Ishizaki proved to costly, eventually having to settle for second place behind Kalmar FF.

The following year, IF Elfsborg once again challenged for a place in European football, brushing aside Hungarian side Szombathelyi Haladás and Portuguese S.C. Braga before eventually falling in the last qualifying round against S.S. Lazio.

IF Elfsborg were big favourites for winning the 2009 but had a problem capitalizing on their high possession and serendipity and eventually ranking third behind AIK and rivals IFK Göteborg.

The following season expectations remained high, but a mediocre start (only nine points in the first 9 rounds), the IF Elfsborg 2010 campaign became an uphill struggle, and Helsingborgs IF and Malmö FF were uncatchable. Malmö FF would be champions with IF Elfsborg in fourth place.

2010 marked IF Elfsborg&#x27;s fourth consecutive season in continental football. The team entered the Europa League second qualifying round in the seeded pot having no real difficulties eliminating Moldovan side FC Iskra-Stal (on an aggregate score of 3–1). The Macedonian side FK Teteks proved unchallenging in the following round with IF Elfsborg realising an emphatic 5–0 first leg win.

The team seemed in good shape to make a serious challenge for reaching the Europa League group stage even though they would be unseeded in the last qualifying round. Unfortunately the draw was once again one of the worst realised. SSC Napoli was held to a 1–0 win away at Stadio San Paolo following a stellar effort by new Danish signing Jesper Christiansen, but the Italians proved too strong in the second leg where they cruised to a 2–0 victory, both goals scored by Uruguay international Edinson Cavani.

The 2010 season was busy for transfers, both in and out. Sweden international Emir Bajrami making his way to FC Twente during the summer and top goalscorer Denni Avdic moving to Werder Bremen during the January transfer window. Three players were signed from Danish clubs. Former hero Jon Jönsson was brought in from Brøndby IF during the summer to bolster the defense, goalkeeper Jesper Christiansen from FC København and right back Andreas Klarström from Esbjerg fB making a comeback to the club.

The club signings during the 2010–2011 winter were notable. Brought in were: forward Lasse Nilsson from Vitesse Arnhem, central defender Andreas Augustsson from Randers FC and target man David Elm from Fulham F.C. Once again, many of the media pundits were thinking that IF Elfsborg were firm favourites to win the 2011.

In early spring former allsvenskan top goalscorer Fredrik Berglund decided to hang up his boots.

The 2011 campaign showed an IF Elfsborg seemingly set on playing a more successful straightforward counter-attacking game. The team started bringing home the occasional away wins. By season&#x27;s midpoint the team was trailing Helsingborgs IF at the top of the table. Young left winger Niklas Hult was the standout player during that half of the season, quickly establishing himself in the team and being touted by some members of the press as &quot;the new Freddie Ljungberg&quot;.

In continental football, IF Elfsborg entered the fray in the first qualifying round of the Europa League. CS Fola Esch were brushed aside after winning 4–0 in the first leg at home and drawing (1–1) away.

==Colours and crest==

Ever since Elfsborg was established they wore the main colour yellow with some stripes of black. The yellow and black color originates in Älvsborg, and it was Älvsborg Regiment that had yellow and black color on their flag, which meant that Elfsborg of course would play in these colors. So it became yellow shirts and black shorts. The costumes remained pure in the colors yellow and black with no club text scrolling on the chest or back. They were simply pure in their colors, and it remained so until the 1940s when trends over Sweden was to adorn their badge on the shirt. In this manner, they could strengthen their brand even more. For Elfsborgs part it was the classic black text Elfsborg in italics placed on the chest at the heart. From 1940 until 2007, almost 50 years, the classic text Elfsborg decorated chest. From 2007 there was a change to what is now the official club emblem there, an emblem derived from the 1970s and has appeared in several versions at most of Elfsborg sections. It is a crown of yellow and black with Elfsborg engraved in it and a football at the top. The reason for the change was mainly to promote the club brand. They wanted a brand that people and companies could associate themselves with – instead of a text as before.

Elfsborg reserve kit is red, and become so as a tribute to a 1941 match against the Sweden. The match was intended a celebration to the Elfsborg new arena Ryavallen. But Second World War deprivation left Elfsborg with a choice of kit the same color, yellow, as their opponent. On short notice, a kit was borrowed from Borås Wäferi, red and white. The Elfsbor 2-1 win would be memorialized in the red kit. Sweden played in yellow. The colours red and white figure prominently as symbols of the city of Borås, in the coat of arms with the two scissors. Elfsborg has the distinction of being the only team in Allsvenskan&#x27;s history to ever defeat Sweden.

===Sponsorship===
The shirts remained long without a major sponsor, which would obviously affect the economy. When IFE harrowed in Division 1 South in
the early 1990s, Olle Blomqvist CEO of Ellos went in with large sums of money and saved the association by becoming the major sponsor. This was not necessarily because he is particularly interested in football, but because he knew the importance Elfsborg had to Borås and Sjuhärad. Ellos became such a prominent sponsor that people jokingly began to Christen the team &quot;Ellos&quot; due to its presence on their shirts. In 2010, a survey showed that Elfsborg was second best team in Allsvenskan to acquire sponsorship money and to establish and maintain contact with their sponsor. The same year, Elfsborg broke a record in local sponsorships around Sjuhärad when its sponsor money increased from 28 to 33 million SEK.

It was not until recently that they signed a contract with major sportbrands. Elfsborg have significantly signed a contract with Umbro up to this date to use their collection of both soccer shoes and clothes. So strong was Umbro&#x27;s sponsorship, that a section of Borås Arena became &quot;umbrocorner&quot;. In earlier years, teams always sewed their own shirts, but with a contract from a major label, new shirts get released into the market each year– which is an economical advantage.

==Stadia==
===Ramnavallen===
One of the first homegrounds to Elfsborg was a small pitch of grass in Folkparken (Ramnaparken today). However Elfsborg noticed quickly that it required more space to be on, both for training and matches. They went to Fristad and Fristads hed where they practiced and played, due to the more space. Next ground that was in Borås was Apotekarnas Mosse who would later become today&#x27;s Ramnavallen.

Ramnavallen was completed in 1922 and then got Elfsborg finally run out on his long-awaited stadium, Ramnavallen. At its time, this was a very modern stadium even though it initially took only 2.700 spectators. Borås Tidning was lyrical about the contribution and described the stadium as impressive from the provincial point of view and because it had high international standards. Elfsborg first Allsvenskan league match on Ramnavallen was played in 1926 and guests were Örgryte IS. 3887 spectators came and saw Evert Lundqvist make the only goal for the guests. The next season became the first yellow and black premiere triumph on the new stadium. AIK came to Ramnavallen and were defeated with 2–1.

Elfsborg kept ramnavallen as a homeground until 1941 and during this time won three league titles. Attendance record of ramnavallen was against AIK 7 June 1936, the end game before the league gold, 16.348 spectators came to see Elfsborg win their first league title in history.

===Ryavallen===

Ryavallen was completed in 1941 and became first of all the new homeground of IF Elfsborg. But it was also Borås first major sports stadium, where the usual track and field could be exercised. Hence the athletics track along the pitch. Before one grandstand was demolished in 2005 the capacity was 19.400, to today&#x27;s approximately 7,000. The old Ryavallen in Borås will get a facelift in 2012. Prior to Swedish Athletics Championship 2013, the current six running tracks widened to eight, and both seat grandstand and the earthworks plan is stripped to make room. The old legendary dikes on Ryavallen gets a proper scratch when Ryavallen upgraded for 13 million SEK. After the renovation, Ryavallen will not be approved to play football on by Swedish Football Association nor UEFA, it will in the future only be used for the purpose of athletics.

At one point came ryavallen to be used for a championship. During the 1958 FIFA World Cup, it hosted the matches between USSR and Austria, and between England and Austria. The Soviet Union won their match against Austria with 2–0, and England had a draw against Austria, 2–2. A championship where Sweden came as a surprise to the finals where they faced Brazil. It ended with a 5–2 loss, but an honorable second place which is the best Sweden performed in a World Cup.

The most memorable event in Ryavallen was the gold game against Örgryte IS – 1961. Elfsborg faced Örgryte on Ryavallen and plays 1–1. When the final whistle sounded, it was clear that Elfsborg as first team come up from Division 2 and immediately won Allsvenskan gold. This made them historic. This was the fourth league gold for Elfsborg. Another very memorable moment of the more terrible degree was when the grandstand collapsed against IFK Göteborg – 1979. The reason was because of the high spectator pressure (19,170) the grandstand collapsed and 10 people had to get to hospital. A memorable moment of the weirder degree was an own goal by Husqvarna IF in the final minutes – 1958. Elfsborg played against Husqvarna IF and it is 0–1 with ten minutes left. A Husqvarna player receives the ball just outside his own penalty area. He then shoots, hard and accurate an untakeable shot into his own goal. No one understands why, and the match ends 1–1. In the newspaper the day after he explains that he was so tired that he did not know which side of the pitch he had found himself.

25 October 2004 would be a historic game before kickoff. Elfsborg met Hammarby and that was the last game ever at Ryavallen. The arena had become too old after 63 years of service. In 2005 Elfsborg moved to its new modern arena, Borås Arena, and ryavallen was converted completely to only fit for athletics. Even so, did Ryavallen reach the highest attendance record in history of Elfsborg, IF Elfsborg – IFK Norrköping – 1961. Record Audience 21,854 in this historic match. Elfsborg won the match with 3–0. After Ryavallen inaugurated in 1941 by Crown Prince Gustav Adolf V and Elfsborg struck as the only Allsvenskan team in the history Sweden men&#x27;s national football team in the inaugural match by 2–1. That also completed a 63-year history in the last match against Hammarby with a win.

===Borås Arena===

Borås Arena is a football stadium in Borås, Sweden. It is the home ground of IF Elfsborg and Norrby IF and was opened on 17 April 2005. Borås Arena has an artificial turf pitch, and was changed to the most modern synthetic turf on the market during the UEFA Euro 2012 at a cost of £500 000. The capacity of the arena is 14,500–17,800 depending on usage, 14,800 is mostly the capacity during international matches, because Uefa would not approve the installation of seats on the standing because of fire risk which means a lower capacity is needed to be approved by Uefa. Borås Arena is located next to Elfsborgs old homeground Ryavallen, both of the stadiums are built together at the roofs, which means that the new stadium is still attached to the old historical Ryavallen.

The first construction started on 31 December 2003 and was inaugurated 17 April 2005 at a cost of £1,120 000 . Which was very cheap at this time considering to be Sweden&#x27;s most modern stadium at that time. It was an effort by Borås Municipality that went out as a lender to Elfsborg. A necessary investment for the club and the city, Elfsborg would own their own stadium by the company Borås Arena AB and would receive all revenues without any intermediaries from matches. Borås Arena didn&#x27;t only open a new era for IF Elfsborg but also for other clubs in Allsvenskan, Elfsborg was the first club to build a new arena owned by their own investment company. Many other clubs have built new arenas copying the model Elfsborg set up, trying to own their arena which gives big economic resources. Borås Arena consists of four main grandstands; Knallelandsläktaren, Ålgårdsläktaren, Sjuhäradsläktaren and Elfsborgsläktaren.

The first game at Borås Arena was between IF Elfsborg vs Örgryte IS on 17 April 2005 in the top Swedish league, Allsvenskan. The game ended in a 1–0 victory for Elfsborg, Daniel Mobaeck scoring the only and first goal in history on Borås Arena. The current record attendance is 17,070 and was set 4 July 2005 in a game between IF Elfsborg and Kalmar FF which marked the return of both Anders Svensson and Mathias Svensson. Anders Svensson also became the first on Borås Arena to score a hat-trick in the derby against rivals IFK Göteborg, Elfsborg won with Anders 3 goals, 3–1. The highest attendance on an international tournament was during the Champions League play-off against Valencia CF where 13,148 spectators came to see Elfsborg deal with the Spaniards. Elfsborg lost with 2–1, after a goal by Daniel Alexandersson.

The stadium was originally scheduled to be a tournament site for the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, but a sponsorship conflict with Max fast food chain&#x27;s location at the stadium and official UEFA sponsor McDonald&#x27;s, plus a contractual requirement for official sponsors to have a monopoly over the stadium&#x27;s area, and a refusal to close the restaurant led to it losing its status as a site for the tournament. A strange conflict that led to Elfsborg and Borås Arena lost the championship as an arranger.

2006 was the highlight in Borås Arenas young history. The year when Elfsborg received dividends on their great effort by salvaging the club&#x27;s 5th SM-Gold. An explicit goal from the club was to win SM-Gold by 2007 and this was accomplished a year in advance, 5 November 2006. The association was strengthened at all levels for a couple of years, not least organizationally and financially, with new sports director &quot;Mr. Elfsborg&quot; Stefan Andreasson, President-elect Bosse &quot;Bank&quot; Johansson and two billionaires as external funders. The new highly skilled (and young) manager couple Magnus Haglund and Peter Wettergren, who was employed before the 2004 season, was also of course in the club&#x27;s big bet. The following year (2005) was also &quot;Elfsborg Fortress&quot;, Borås Arena, completed while enlisted old heroes in the form of Anders and Mathias Svensson came back. Memorable matches this season on Borås Arena was at home the victory against Malmö FF (4–2), which many described as the best in the season and where Anders Svensson made the team&#x27;s single best effort during the season. Another memorable match was the last and crucial one. Gold match at a packed Borås Arena against Djurgårdens IF where Joakim Sjöhage became gold shooter with the only goal which meant that over 40 years of waiting was over for the Elfsborgs fans.

==Supporters==
Already in the 1940s there was the legendary Elfsborg chant &quot;heja di våra, inte di dära, trampa di främmatta pöjka på tära&quot; on Ryavallen, at the time, including of a certain young Ingvar Carlsson, who later became prime minister. For a few years in the 1970s &quot;Di Gule&quot; played fantastic football and was in top contest of the Swedish Allsvenskan. At this time the British supporter culture retrieved from &quot;Tipsextra&quot; began to interfere and influence in Swedish football culture, with an impact even on Ryavallen in Borås, where the seating stand for many years was the busiest around Ryavallen and Elfsborg. A young supporter section was formed later on within Elfsborgs fanclub and the culture of being on the standing ground began to arise all along with the contemporary characteristic hat and striped scarf in Elfsborgs colours yellow and black. In the coming years, there was a small and disorganized supporter group who failed to make a big fuss.

===Guliganerna===
1991 underwent IF Elfsborg the club&#x27;s probably heaviest period ever, the economy and the results weighted during the period in Söderettan. 21 November 1991, however, formed a collection of young men, a supporter compound that would become a familiar concept not only in Borås, but throughout Sweden: Guliganerna. Despite continued play in Söderettan and low public interest in all of Sweden the supporter group, Guliganerna, continued to grow. 1990s guliganer became not known for their quantity but for their faithfulness, to always be there wherever IF Elfsborg played. After the fan bus arrived late for an away game at some point in the mid-1990s, the players looked nervous on the stand and was worried that something happened, after this incident the players had the supporters promise to not be late for the games so as not to disturb the players focus.

In 1997, was IF Elfsborg back in the top tier of Swedish football and that also meant an upturn for Guliganerna, in −97 was the first Elfsborg Tifo group founded, &quot;TGD (Tifosi Guligan Divisione)&quot;, who had a few tifos before the members quit for various reasons in 1999, mainly because they had no financial backing. Year 2000 became the starting year of the great generation change that occurred in Elfsborgs supporterlines until now, a group of young boys founded the current tifo group, &quot;GTS (Guligan Tifo Support)&quot;, and a more youthful profile became clear among Elfsborgs supporter sections.

2006 was 45-years of waiting over. The club had won national championship which also meant an increased interest around Elfsborg. In 2011 Guliganerna had their 20th anniversary celebrated, the tribute was made in connection with the game against Kalmar FF, the players wore specially made anniversary T-shirts and GTS arranged the most expensive tifo ever in the history of the club. Guliganerna also broke during the same year, a new member record of 1155 people, making Guliganerna Sweden fifth largest fan base in the 2011.

Elfsborgs main antagonist and rivalry is pointed against IFK Göteborg and has been so since all the way back in the 1920s. The geographical position between the cities makes it Elfsborgs only and closest derby also called &quot;El Västico&quot;, which also reflects the attendance figures since it is almost always sold out in these games.

Guliganerna and Peking Fanz (supporters of IFK Norrköping) however has a completely own history among Swedish supporters, a history that stands as a thorn in the eyes of other supporter organizations in Sweden. This friendship is based on that Guliganerna in the 1990s invited visiting supporters before the match, Peking Fanz invited back several times and the friendship was born. Since this friendship was born, both supporter bases now often follow each other&#x27;s games, which makes Guliganerna and Peking Fanz unique. Especially between Elfsborgs only ultras group &quot;Yellow Fanatics&quot;, there are strong links with the IFK Norrköping, Peking ultras.

==European record==
=== 1960–1980, playing in the UEFA Intertoto Cup and UEFA Cup ===

Elfsborgs tenure in European football began in 1961 after winning national championship. The same year they qualified to the current UEFA Intertoto Cup. Elfsborg first resistance ever in a European Cup was against the German SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin, which they won with 2–3 away and a stunning 5–2 at home. The second match was against the classic Swiss team FC Basel, which began with a 1–2 loss at home but Elfsborg gathered forces and won in the returning game with 3–6 after a hat-trick by Henry Larsson. The last and final match was against the hard to beat Sparta Rotterdam who before they faced Elfsborg had not lost a single game, the Dutch proved to be too difficult, it ended in a 2–5 loss at home and 4–3 away loss. But despite the loss Elfsborg ended as runners-up being the second team in the group and the tournament&#x27;s big winner was Henry Larsson with his 8 goals and Lars Råberg with 6 his goals. Five years later, in 1966, Elfsborg continued their adventures in Europe and the UEFA Intertoto Cup. The first opponent was the German team Borussia Neunkirchen, a match which Elfsborg won both home and away with a total of 4–1. The second match against VSS Košice became a very different story, they lost 3–0 away and then crushed the opponents with 6–0 at home, after a hat-trick by Roger Carlsson. In the final group stage match against leaders Vorwärts Berlin was lost with 2–0 in both matches which meant that Elfsborg finally ended as third in the group.

The following year, 1967 Elfsborg played in the UEFA Intertoto Cup where they in the first group stage match met the German team Werder Bremen. The first match ended in a 4–1 loss away, but the second game ended with a draw 2–2 at home. In the second game, the Polish team Polonia Bytom were the adversaries, where Elfsborg lost in both matches. But in the last match against the Swiss Grasshopper Club Zürich Elfsborg would take a memorable scalp, when they beat them at home with 5–2 after a hat-trick by Lars Heinemann. The return ended in a 3–1 loss and Elfsborg finished again in third place in the group. 1971 was an unsuccessful year in the European competitions for Elfsborg, they met the teams Stal Mielec, Tatran Prešov and Vejle BK. They lost every game except against the Danish Vejle BK where they won both games with a total of 8–0, and once again Elfsborg ended as third in their group. In 1972, Elfsborg played in the UEFA Cup for the first time, playing against the classic German champions Hertha Berlin in the first round. They lost with 3–1 at Olympic Stadium and with 1–4 at home.

1975 was Elfsborg&#x27;s worst performing year in European competition and the UEFA Intertoto Cup when they finished last in the group after having met teams as Baník Ostrava, Celik Zenica and Vitoria Setúbal. Elfsborg still won at home against Baník Ostrava with 3–1 at home and a tie against Vitoria Setúbal. In 1978, Elfsborg participated once again in the UEFA Intertoto Cup and this year was slightly better than the last in 1975, Elfsborg won with a total of 5–3 against Norwegian Lillestrøm SK, and then a win against former Yugoslav Sloboda Tuzla. But Elfsborg could not compete with the giant Israeli Maccabi Netanya F.C., and lost the first game with 7–1 away but managed a 2–2 draw at home. In 1978 Elfsborg were in the UEFA Cup for the second time when they stood against the French sovereigns RC Strasbourg. In the first meeting, Elfsborg surprisingly won 2–0 at home, but in the returning game they lost 4–1 in front of 31 000 spectators.

===1980–2000, many years outside European football===
1980, became Elfsborg best year ever in the UEFA Intertoto Cup when they won their group and became the winner of the tournament. This after they first won against FK Napredak Kruševac with a total of 4–2 and then against Slavia Sofia with a total of 3–1. German VfL Bochum became more difficult when the loss in the first meeting with 2–1 and then changed with a win at home 1–0, this meant that Elfsborg ended up as number one in their group. The following year, 1981, did Elfsborg participate in the UEFA Cup where they faced Scottish St Mirren F.C. The first match ended in a 1–2 loss at home who then followed up with a draw 0–0 in Scotland. 1983 Elfsborg would make their penultimate appearance in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, when they stood against the teams TJ Vitkovice, Trakia Plovdiv and Eintracht Braunschweig. It was a bad adventure where they only won against German Eintracht Braunschweig with 1–0 at home and play a draw against Trakia Plovdiv, this meant that Elfsborg finished as last in their group. Despite the poor performance 1983, they reached the UEFA Cup, 1984, where the opponents was Polish team Widzew Łódź, before 30 000 spectators played Elfsborg a draw away against the Poles, 0–0, also at home playing a heroic game with a draw 2–2 and but the Poles advanced furthermore, after more away goals.

===2000–present===
It would take almost 20 years before Elfsborg would participate in the European cups again, after the heaviest period in the club&#x27;s history Elfsborg was now back at the top layer of Allsvenskan and participated in the UEFA Cup in 2001 after they won the national cup. They stood against JK Trans Narva in the first round, where they won with 1–3 away and then also won with 5–0 at home after a hat-trick by Stefan Andreasson. The second round was against one of the Polish giants Legia Warsaw where Elfsborg lost with a total of 10–2.

The second round was against Hungarian Debreceni VSC where they won away with 1–0 after a goal by Daniel Mobaeck. They secured promotion to the third round by playing 0–0 at home. The third round was against Spanish giants Valencia CF, where 50 000 spectators at the Mestalla Stadium saw Elfsborg lose with 3–0 after including goal by David Silva. Back at Borås Arena Elfsborg lost again with 2–1 after goals by Daniel Alexandersson and David Villa with Valencia&#x27;s decisive 2–1 goal.

After the excellent results in the UEFA Champions League became Elfsborg directly qualified for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup group stage where they stood against the teams FC Dinamo București, AEK Athens, ACF Fiorentina, FK Mladá Boleslav and Villarreal CF. Elfsborg won against FC Dinamo București with 2–1 and a draw against AEK Athens, 1–1. The following year 2008 achieved Elfsborg for the last time winning the UEFA Intertoto Cup by beating teams HB Tórshavn with a total of 2–1, Hibernian FC with a total of 4–0 and FK Riga with a total of 1–0. Which meant that they finished as group winners. That same year they also played UEFA Cup last time 2008–09 UEFA Cup when it was against the Irish St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic F.C. but lost surprisingly with a total of 4–3. In 2009 Elfsborg started for the first time playing in the UEFA Europa League where they in the second round stood against Szombathelyi Haladás as they were defeated with a total of 3–0. In the third round was against Portuguese 2010–11 UEFA Europa League finalists S.C. Braga, as they beat them after a completely win by a total of 4–1. In the final play-off round Elfsborg stood against classic S.S. Lazio where they in the first meeting lost with 3–0 and then again after a heroic effort won with 1–0 after a goal by Denni Avdic.

Also the year after 2010 played Elfsborg in the UEFA Europa League where they stood against FC Iskra-Stal in the second round and won with the total of 3–1. The third round was against FK Teteks from Macedonia, a team that Elfsborg won easily against with a total of 7–1. The play-off round was once again against one of the classic Italian teams against Maradona&#x27;s old club SSC Napoli. Elfsborg succeeded after a heroic performance by goalkeeper Jesper Christiansen to get away from the Stadio San Paolo with a 1–0 loss. Back at the Borås Arena Elfsborg lost anyway with 2–0 after two goals by Edinson Cavani who got his big breakthrough in this match. In 2011 Elfsborg played in the UEFA Europa League for the third consecutive year, and stood against CS Fola Esch in the first round which they won with a total of 5–1. The second round was against FK Suduva where they won easily with a total of 4–1. But in the third round Elfsborg lost surprisingly against the Norwegian Aalesunds FK with a total of 5–1 and failed to reach the play-offs. The same thing happened the year after in 2012. Even if Elfsborg had a perfect start in the qualification by winning a home game in the first stage against Floriana F.C. with 8–0, the biggest international victory in Elfsborgs history. The away game was just as easy, Elfsborg won with 5–0 and with a total of 13–0. In the second stage were the opponents FC Dacia Chişinău and Elfsborg lost the first game after a weak effort with 1–0. But won easy at Borås Arena with 2–0 and therefore advanced to the third stage. In the third stage it would be a Scandinavian battle, since the opponents were Danish AC Horsens. The first away game ended with a draw, 1–1, after Horsens received a penalty in stoppage time. But in their home game Elfsborg lost 2–3 and history was repeated from the previous year, Elfsborg failed once again to reach the play-offs.

==Records==

In 2024 Elfsborg played their 81st season in Allsvenskan from its inception in 1924 up to and including the 2024 season. This placing them on a 5th place of those teams who have participated in total seasons. They have also played top-flight football continually in Sweden since 1997, which currently is the 3rd longest top-flight tenure of any club in Sweden—the longest one is IFK Göteborg, since 1977.

The club is currently placed 5th in the all-time Allsvenskan table, &quot;maratontabellen&quot; in Swedish, which is a cumulative record of all match results, points, and goals of every team that has played in Allsvenskan since its inception in 1924–25. Furthermore, Elfsborg is placed 6th in the all-time medal table, with a total of 24 medals of different value – the most recent was received in 2012.

The player in IF Elfsborg who holds most club and national records is Sven Jonasson. In 409 games, most appearances ever in Elfsborg, he scored a total of 252 goals in Allsvenskan, which makes it an all-time record. He played in Elfsborg throughout his career, which started in 1927 and ended 1947, a total of 20 years. What&#x27;s more, the most remarkable achievement is his unbreakable record of 344 games in consecutive. A record that was broken in a most unfortunate way, he missed his first game in 14 years because of failure to receive furlough during his military service. He was also the first goalscorer ever for the Sweden men&#x27;s national football team in a worldcup. It was in the 1934 FIFA World Cup, where he scored two goals in Sweden&#x27;s 3–2 victory against Argentina.

<text>The Valdivia culture is one of the oldest settled cultures recorded in the Americas. It appeared thousand years after Las Vegas culture and thrived along the coast of Santa Elena peninsula in Santa Elena Province of Ecuador between 3500 BCE and 1500 BCE.

==Culture==

Remains of the Valdivia culture were discovered in 1956 on the western coast of Ecuador by the Ecuadorian archeologist Emilio Estrada, who continued to study this culture. American archeologists Clifford Evans and Betty Meggers joined him in the early 1960s in studying the type-site.

The original excavations were in a small village of Valdivia located well north of Santa Elena peninsula. Valdivia is located about 10km south of the beach resort of Montañita.

The Valdivia lived in a community that built its houses in a circle or oval around a central plaza. They were believed to have a relatively egalitarian culture of sedentary people who lived mostly from fishing, though they did some farming and occasionally hunted for deer to supplement their diet. From the archeological remains that have been found, it has been determined that Valdivians cultivated maize, kidney beans, squash, cassava, chili peppers and cotton plants. The latter was processed, spun and woven to make clothing.

Valdivian pottery, dated to 2700 BCE, initially was rough and practical, but it became splendid, delicate and large over time. They generally used red and gray colors, and the polished dark red pottery is characteristic of the Valdivia period. In their ceramics and stone works, the Valdivia culture shows a progression from the most simple to much more complicated works.

The trademark Valdivia piece is the &quot;Venus&quot; of Valdivia: feminine ceramic figures. The &quot;Venus&quot; of Valdivia likely represented actual people, as each figurine is individual and unique, as expressed in the hairstyles. The figures were made joining two rolls of clay, leaving the lower portion separated as legs and making the body and head from the top portion. The arms were usually very short, and in most cases were bent towards the chest, holding the breasts or under the chin.

A display of Valdivian artifacts is located at Universidad de Especialidades Espíritu Santo in Guayaquil, Ecuador. 

==Influences on Valdivia culture==

Ceramic phase A of the Valdivia was long thought to be the oldest pottery produced by a coastal culture in South America, dated to 3000-2700 BCE. In the 1960s, a team of researchers proposed there were significant similarities between the archeological remains and pottery styles of Valdivia and those of the ancient Jōmon culture, active in this same period on the island of Kyūshū, Japan. They compared both decoration and vessel shape, pointing to techniques of incising. The Early to Middle Jomon pottery had antecedents dating 10,000 years, but the Valdivia pottery style seemed to have developed rather quickly. In 1962 three archeologists, Ecuadorian Emilio Estrada and Americans Clifford Evans and Betty Meggers suggested that Japanese fishermen had gotten blown to Ecuador in a storm and introduced their ceramics to Valdivia at that time. Their theory was based on the idea of diffusion of style and techniques.

Their concept was challenged at the time by other archaeologists, who argued that there were strong logistical challenges to the idea that Japanese could have survived what would have been nearly a year and a half voyage in dugout canoes. The cultures were separated by a distance of 15,000 km (8,000 nautical miles). Researchers argued that Valdivia ceramics (and culture) had developed independently, and those apparent similarities were a result simply of constraints on technique, and an &quot;accidental convergence&quot; of symbols and style.

In the 1970s, what is believed widely to be conclusive evidence refuting the diffusion theory was found at the Valdivia type-site, as older pottery and artifacts were found below these excavations. Researchers found what is called San Pedro pottery, pre-dating Phase A and the Valdivia style. It was more primitive. Some researchers believe pottery may have been introduced by people from northern Colombia, where comparably early pottery was found at the Puerto Hormiga archaeological site. In addition, they think that the maize at Valdivia was likely introduced by people living closer to Meosamerica, where it was domesticated. Other pottery remains of the San Pedro style were found at sites about 5.6 miles (9 km) up the river valley.

Additional research at both several coastal sites, including San Pablo, Real Alto, and Salango, and Loma Alta, Colimes, and San Lorenzo del Mate inland have resulted in a major rethinking of Valdivian culture. It has been reclassified as representing a &quot;tropical forest culture&quot; with a riverine settlement focus. There has been major re-evaluation of nearly every aspect of its culture.

<text>Brøndbyernes Idrætsforening (, usually abbreviated to Brøndby IF (), is a Danish football club based in the Copenhagen suburb of Brøndbyvester. Brøndby IF denotes the professional football section of Brøndbyernes Idrætsforening, which was founded on 3 December 1964 by a merger of the football clubs Brøndbyøster Idrætsforening (founded on 10 October 1928) and Brøndbyvester Idrætsforening (founded on 1 February 1909). The club&#x27;s first team, which plays in the Danish Superliga, plays its home games at Brøndby Stadium, where its team plays in blue shorts and socks and yellow shirts.

The club has excelled both nationally and internationally, among other things by reaching the quarter-finals of the European Champions Cup in 1986-87 and the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup 1990–91. In addition, the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League in 1998 and for the UEFA Cup group stage in 2005.

Through the 1980s, Brøndby IF&#x27;s role in Danish football became more prominent with, among other things, winning the Danish Superliga in 1985, 1987, 1988, 1990, and 1991. In 1996–1998, Brøndby IF won three Danish championships in a row. In 1998, the club also won the Danish Cup and thus brought home &quot;The Double&quot;. Brøndby IF won the Danish Superliga in 2002 and the Danish Cup in 2005. The team recently won the Danish Cup in 2018 and the Danish Superliga in 2021. But in the 23/24 season they lost the last game at home to AGF and FC Midtjylland won the league.

Brøndby have a longstanding rivalry with city neighbors FC Copenhagen, against which they contest the Copenhagen Derby. The fixture is also referred to as the &quot;Battle of Copenhagen&quot; or the &quot;New Firm&quot;.

==History==

===Formation (1964–1977)===
Brøndbyernes Idrætsforening was formed on 3 December 1964 following a merger between two local rivals – Brøndbyøster IF and Brøndbyvester IF. The merger was to be completed as a prerequisite for the construction of a new stadium by Brøndby Municipality. Brøndby IF spent its inaugural season as an amateur club in the 6th tier of the 11 Danish leagues, the Serie 1, where they finished their two first seasons in fourth place. Among the players of the early years was team captain Per Bjerregaard, a doctor who had moved to Copenhagen from Randers in Jutland, and Hans Gregersen, who was the mascot of the team until his death by syphilis in 1967. In 1967, the club hired coach Leif Andersen who instantly secured promotion to &quot;Sjællandsserien&quot; (the Zealand series). After a few mediocre years, a new coach, John Sinding, was brought in, and the club won promotion to &quot;Danmarksserien&quot; (the Denmark series).

In 1973, Per Bjerregaard stopped his active career at 27 years of age and became chairman of Brøndby; his first action was to sack head coach Sinding. In his place, Brøndby hired former professional and Denmark national team player Finn Laudrup, who took over as head coach while he still took actively part in the matches as a player. Laudrup joined his brother-in-law Ebbe Skovdahl in the Brøndby team, and he brought his two young sons Brian and Michael Laudrup with him to the club. Under Finn Laudrup&#x27;s influence, the club&#x27;s playing style was changed to a more attacking strategy, even though Laudrup decided to fully concentrate his efforts as a player after only a year. After winning promotion in 1974, Laudrup left Brøndby in the 3rd Division in 1976 to play for KB in the Danish top-flight league (then named the 1st Division) and a year later Michael Laudrup, the brightest talent in Danish football, followed.

===Professional football (1977–1987)===
In 1977, Brøndby moved up into the 2nd Division, and were one of the clubs who quickly adapted to the new times of paid football in the best Danish leagues in 1978. Per Bjerregaard persuaded Finn Laudrup into returning to Brøndby in 1981 on a professional contract, and following a season of 85 goals in 30 matches, Brøndby won promotion to the top-flight 1st Division under coach Tom Køhlert. Finn Laudrup subsequently ended his career at age 36, but in his place Michael Laudrup returned for the 1982 season, being one of ten players leaving KB that year.

Brøndby won their 1st Division debut match 7–1 over fellow promoted team B 1909 in a match which featured two goals from Michael Laudrup. He was subsequently called up for the Denmark national team, and on 15 June 1982 he became the first Brøndby player to win a cap for the national team. Brøndby finished their first 1st Division season in fourth place with Laudrup the league&#x27;s third top goal scorer with 15 goals, earning him the Danish Player of the Year award. In 1983, Laudrup was sold to Juventus in the then-biggest transfer deal in Denmark, giving Brøndby the economic foundation to expand further.

After four years in the top division, Brøndby won their first Danish championship in 1985 and played its first European match when the club beat Hungarian champions Budapest Honvéd 4–1 in the 1986 European Cup. In 1986, Brøndby became the first Danish club of fully professionals when ten players were signed full-time, and the club was introduced at the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in 1987.

===European success (1987–1992)===
Throughout the second half of the 1980s, the team dominated the league and did not finish lower than second place until 1992. The team was built around talented Danish players, and from 1987 to 1991 players from Brøndby won the Danish Player of the Year award every year. The recipients formed the backbone of the Denmark national team which later won UEFA Euro 1992, and was the first goalscorer in the 2–0 Euro 1992 final win John &quot;Faxe&quot; Jensen (1987), national team captain Lars Olsen (1988), the World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper 1992 and 1993 award winner Peter Schmeichel (1989), four-time Danish Player of the Year award winner Brian Laudrup (1990) and the second goalscorer of the Euro 1992 final Kim Vilfort (1991). The club became used to winning the national title and turned its attention towards European success.

In 1990, Brøndby hired former national team captain Morten Olsen as coach, and under his reign, the 1990–91 UEFA Cup became the high point in the short history of the club. Especially the meriting wins over German sides Eintracht Frankfurt and Bayer Leverkusen, and Russian club Torpedo Moscow saw the many Danish profiles shine, and the club was minutes from qualifying for the final match of the tournament. In the 88th minute of the semi-final, however, a Rudi Völler goal denied Brøndby a trip to the UEFA Cup final in favour of Roma. Following the impressive European display by the comparatively small club, important members of the team, including Lars Olsen, top scoring striker Bent &quot;Turbo&quot; Christensen and star goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, left the club.

The following year, 1992, was the worst year in the club&#x27;s history as the intended takeover of the Danish bank Interbank went awry. It was expected that European Cup success would boost the Brøndby stock value in order to finance the buy, but as the club was beaten by Dynamo Kyiv in the 1991–92 European Cup qualification, the stocks never reached the value necessary to finalize the deal. It had been arranged for financial backers Hafnia Insurance Company to step in and take over the buy in case Brøndby could not finance it, but as Hafnia went bankrupt, Brøndby were forced to buy Interbank and financial collapse was imminent as club debts amassed to 400 million DKK. A long-term rescue plan was initiated to save the club, but these events influenced the performance of the team and the championship, now called the Danish Superliga, was not won again until 1996.

===Rebuilding (1992–2002)===
The rebuilding of the team was led by head coach Ebbe Skovdahl, who deployed the team in a 4-4-2 formation. The return to the club of Euro 1992 veterans John Jensen and captain Lars Olsen combined with the emergence of goalkeeper Mogens Krogh and striker Ebbe Sand got the club back on its feet. The rebuilding culminated in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup elimination of Liverpool, though Roma once again knocked Brøndby out. Including that year, Brøndby won three Danish championships in a row, and the next year&#x27;s UEFA Cup saw one of the biggest upsets in Brøndby history, as a 3–1 home defeat to Karlsruher SC was changed to an aggregate win when Brøndby beat the team of Euro 1996 winner Thomas Häßler 5–0 away in Germany. Most importantly for the club&#x27;s economy, Brøndby qualified for the new format of the European Cup, rebranded as the UEFA Champions League.

The Champions League qualification meant six guaranteed matches in a group stage with three of the biggest teams of Europe, and when they were paired with Barcelona and later finalists Manchester United and Bayern Munich, Brøndby faced very economically attractive matches. Despite winning 2–1 over Bayern in the first match of the group stage, Brøndby conceded 18 goals in 6 matches and were eliminated with a single win to their name.

Skovdahl decided to take a stab at coaching at Scottish club Aberdeen and Brøndby took a more Scandinavian approach, in search of stable success in the European competitions with Norwegian club Rosenborg the role model. The club hired Norwegian manager Åge Hareide in 2000, who proclaimed a shift in line-up to a more attacking 4–3–3 system. With Hareide came a handful of Scandinavian players of whom especially Sweden national team player Mattias Jonson became a fan favourite.

The year 2000 was also the year the club finalized a planned expansion of Brøndby Stadion from a 20,000 to a 29,000 capacity, making it the second largest stadium in Denmark, only trailing the Parken Stadium of F.C. Copenhagen. At the cost of 250 million DKK, the vast expenditure was seen as a sign that the club was out of its former financial crisis. The building project was finalized in Autumn 2000, and on 22 October, 28,416 spectators saw Brøndby beat Akademisk Boldklub 4–2 in the opening match of the rebuilt stadium.

Hareide&#x27;s visions of a 4–3–3 system never worked out, and the team soon returned to the well-known 4–4–2 setup. As he slowly lost hold of a ten-point lead to rivals F.C. Copenhagen, gained in a great first half of the 2001–02 Superliga season, Hareide took his leave in spring 2002 before the last matches of the season. He was replaced by youth team coach Tom Køhlert, who, though reluctant to take the job, gave first team debuts to the top youth team players, most notably Thomas Kahlenberg, who helped the club narrowly secure the championship win on goal difference.

===The Laudrup years (2002–2006)===
In the 2002–03 pre-season, Brøndby announced that Danish icon Michael Laudrup was taking the manager seat in his old club with John Jensen, also a club legend, as his assistant. In their first season, there were massive cuts from the very large squad; ten players were put in the reserves squad or sold and a talent squad was established. The club was to rely even more home grown players as Brøndby was already famous for developing very talented players. In the process, Laudrup told several players to find new clubs as he thought they would not fit in the playing style he wanted to implement.

During the Laudrup era, Brøndby won the Double in 2005. The club was relatively successful in the European competitions as Schalke 04 was beaten 2–1 in the 2003–04 UEFA Cup but was later beaten by Laudrup&#x27;s former club Barcelona, 0–1.

In May 2006, it was announced that Laudrup and Jensen could not agree with the board of Brøndby regarding an extension of their contracts, and the duo left the club.

===Years of crisis (2006–2013)===
The two were replaced by Dutch coach René Meulensteen, who had a rough start in charge of the first team. Together with newly appointed Anders Bjerregaard – son of director Per Bjerregaard – Meulensteen bought a number of questionable players in the final days of the summer transfer window. In the first matches, the new coach struggled with injuries among the key players and the team had problems living up to the expectations.

Meulensteen resigned after six months, leaving Brøndby in seventh position halfway through the 2006–07 Superliga. The official explanation for his departure was that his family could not settle in Denmark, but soon after, the former coach revealed major infrastructural problems in the club&#x27;s organization, calling the club &quot;a very sick patient requiring immediate attention&quot;, as well as cliques inside the first team. In order to solve the clique problems, he had gone to director Per Bjerregaard to fire three key players – Marcus Lantz, Thomas Rytter and one club man Per Nielsen – in order to reestablish the balance in the first team squad, a demand Danish football experts later described as the quickest way of getting sacked.

Tom Køhlert took the managerial reins once more, this time as a permanent solution on a two-and-a-half-year contract.

After losing 2–4 to Horsens on 26 August, their 23rd consecutive away match without a victory, the team was met by approximately 200 furious fans and cries like &quot;die mercenaries&quot; and &quot;we are Brøndby, who are you?&quot; on their return to Brøndby.

On 31 August 2007, Per Bjerregaard announced that he resigned from the position as director of Brøndby IF, and instead took over as chairman of the board. Shortly after his resignation, Peter Schmeichel announced that he was ready to purchase Brøndby and become a director. The announcement divided the fans. Some praised the former player for trying to save the club, while others criticized him for bringing investor Aldo Petersen along, a keen supporter and former stockholder of rivals F.C. Copenhagen. Schmeichel&#x27;s offer, however, was rejected. On 1 April 2008, Hermann Haraldsson was appointed to the vacant position.

Following a disappointing beginning of the 2007–08 Superliga season with only five points gained from seven matches, manager Tom Køhlert made it clear in August 2007 that the Danish Cup now had a higher priority for the club. The change of priorities was successful, and Brøndby won their first domestic title in almost three years on 1 May 2008 when Esbjerg were defeated 3–2 in the final of the 2007–08 Danish Cup. Soon after, manager Køhlert declared his job complete, prompting club chairman Bjerregaard to search for his replacement. On 16 June 2008, the club announced the appointment of former player and head coach of Horsens, Kent Nielsen. Nielsen took charge of the first team on 1 January 2009. Former legendary coach Køhlert in the meantime led Brøndby to the first place, where they stayed until Nielsen arrived.

On 1 July 2008, KasiGroup replaced Codan as the main sponsor of the club. The partnership involved a cooperation with UNICEF, making Brøndby the third club in Europe next to Barcelona and Swedish side Hammarby to wear the UNICEF logo on their shirts. Furthermore, KasiGroup entered a sponsorship for the stadium and promised substantial funds for strengthening the first-team squad. During the 2008 summer transfer window, this contributed to Brøndby signing five new players with national team experience in order to strengthen the team.

On 30 December 2009, KasiGroup owner Jesper Nielsen got in trouble with Brøndby and refused to pay the remainder of the pledged money. On 31 August 2012, Brøndby told the Danish media B.T. that KasiGroup owed the club more than DKK 45 million (€6,000,000 / £5,000,000). Nielsen told B.T. that he could recognize the amount but that his lawyer thought they could make a settlement at a much lower figure than the 45 million. Nielsen was the owner of AG København, which went bankrupt on 31 July 2012. He was thus chased both by Brøndby and the Danish tax authorities, and a lawsuit followed. The case came to a close years later, in 2018, when Brøndby IF and Nielsen reached a multi-million Danish kroner settlement depending on Nielsen&#x27;s active arbitration case against jewellery manufacturer Pandora.

===The Jan Bech era===

====Thomas Frank and &quot;Oscar-gate&quot; (2013–2016)====

In May 2013, the club was again close to bankruptcy, but was taken over and saved by a small group of investors led by Ole Abildgaard and Aldo Pedersen. On 10 April 2014, the new main investor, Jan Bech Andersen, took over as chairman and replaced the board with his own team. On 14 July 2014, the club announced they had signed a one-year contract with Danish betting company Bet25 as their main sponsor, with the option to extend the contract for an additional two years. The deal was said to be worth &quot;a significant amount in the million Danish kroner range&quot;. The deal includes a strategic partnership between Brøndby and Bet25. As part of the contract, Danish telecommunications company TDC A/S (which owns 51% of Bet25), installed Wi-Fi in Brøndby Stadion in December 2014. On 15 January 2015, it was announced Brøndby and Bet25 extended their contract until summer 2017.

In 2016, Thomas Frank announced his resignation as Brøndby IF manager after chairman Jan Bech Andersen had discredited him on an online chat-forum under the name of &quot;Oscar&quot;, the case being referred to as &quot;Oscar-gate&quot; by the media. Bech Andersen stepped down as chairman after the incident but continued as board member.

====Zorniger and the German years (2016–2019)====
In April 2016, the board of directors presented &quot;Strategi 6.4&quot; (Strategy 6.4), a plan for the future course of the club. The main value presented was &quot;community&quot; (), and a vision for Brøndby IF was also laid out. Between 2016 and 2019, the club was to make the Superliga championship playoff every year, become more transparent and reach economic viability by the end of the period. Finally, between 2020 and 2023, Brøndby was to reach European football every season and continue to improve in areas of community, transparency and economy. In addition, the team should strive for a tactic with strong pressing and return to having one of the best youth academies in Denmark again.

On 17 May 2016, Brøndby named German coach Alexander Zorniger as their new head coach. His first two seasons as head coach resulted in two second-place league finishes and a Danish Cup win. The focal point of Brøndby under Zorniger was an extreme form of the German &quot;Gegenpressing&quot; tactic, popularly translated to &quot;overfaldsfodbold&quot; (assault football) in Denmark; a style which proved to be a success. During the 2017–18 season, Brøndby mounted an eventful title charge to eventually finish second behind FC Midtjylland after being top of the table in the penultimate round. Zorniger was sacked in February 2019, following a poor start to the new campaign. His position had earlier been called into question after a match against Hobro IK in December 2018, where Brøndby&#x27;s starting lineup featured no Danes. After the match, Zorniger criticised the Brøndby youth department for lacking quality and the Danish mentality for being poor. Martin Retov and Matthias Jaissle, former assistants under Zorniger, were appointed as caretaker managers the next day.

====Frederiksen, &quot;CV&quot; and Superliga Champions (2019–2022)====
In June 2019, former Denmark national U21 coach, Niels Frederiksen, was presented as the new head coach of Brøndby IF. A month later, Carsten &quot;CV&quot; Jensen was appointed as Director of Football in Brøndby, and became the person responsible for meeting the requirements of implementing &quot;Strategi 6.4&quot;. In Frederiksen&#x27;s first season, Brøndby ended in fourth place of the league table, as the team failed to reach qualification to the Europa League. However, the team was largely seen to be in a rebuilding phase, with the departures of important first-team player such as Kamil Wilczek, Dominik Kaiser and Hany Mukhtar in the January transfer window, and the emergence of younger players such as Morten Frendrup, Jesper Lindstrøm and Anis Ben Slimane in the starting lineup.

On 24 May 2021, Brøndby won its first Danish league title in 16 years with a 2–0 win over Nordsjælland. Brøndby finished the season ahead of Midtjylland and arch-rival FC Copenhagen.

===Global Football Holdings ownership (2022–present)===
In August 2022, chairman of the club Jan Bech Andersen sold over half of his shares to Global Football Holdings (GFH), an American sports investment company owned by David Blitzer. Andersen continued as chairman of the board. On 14 November, Frederiksen was dismissed from his position after Brøndby ended 2022 in 10th place in the league table. In January 2023, Brøndby announced Jesper Sørensen, formerly Frederiksen&#x27;s assistant coach, as their new head coach. On the final matchday of the championship round in the 2023–24 season, Brøndby lost 3–2 at home against AGF, which resulted in them losing the title to Midtjylland by just one point.

On 8 October 2024, director of football Carsten V. Jensen left the position by mutual consent. Vice chairman Scott McLachlan took over as caretaker. Sørensen was dismissed on 11 December 2024, with Frederik Birk taking over first as caretaker and since as permanent head coach. On 30 December 2024, Brøndby announced Benjamin Schmedes as their new director of football.

==Stadium==

Brøndby have always played their matches at Brøndby Stadion. A part of the merging of Brøndbyvester IF and Brøndbyøster IF was a promise by the Brøndby municipality mayor to build a ground, and in 1965 it was ready for the club to play in. Through the first years in the secondary Danish leagues, the stadium was little more than a grass field with an athletics track circling the field of play. It was not until 1978 that the main stand was built, sporting a capacity of 1,200 seated spectators. As newly promoted to the top Danish league in 1982, concrete terraces opposite the main stand were constructed, allowing for a crowd of 5,000 additional people. Following the first years of success in the top-flight, the athletic track was discarded and a further 2,000 seats were installed on top of the concrete stands from 1989 to 1990.

When Brøndby played matches against other successful European teams in the 1990–91 UEFA Cup, the then capacity of up to 10,000 spectators was quickly dwarfed by the ticket interest. As the Denmark national stadium Idrætsparken in Copenhagen was being rebuilt, the club found no other way to host the matches but to get a dispensation to use scaffolding stands, which boosted the stadium capacity to 18,000 in the semi-final leg of the tournament, a 0–0 draw with Roma. Following the European adventure, the club inaugurated its end stands in 1992, allowing for a total of 22,000 spectators.

In May 1998, the club bought Brøndby Stadion from the Brøndby municipality for 23.5 million DKK and immediately spent double that amount to modernize the stadium. When the club qualified for the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League, the stadium was still under construction and the matches were moved to archrival F.C. Copenhagen&#x27;s Parken Stadium. In 2000, all stands were standardized and built to the same height, allowing for crowds of 29,000 at domestic matches and 22,000 in the European matches, which allow only all-seated crowds. Since then, the stadium has seen a number of lesser or larger infrastructural and technical enhancements, and the February 2004 European match against Barcelona was played in front of a 26,031-spectator crowd.

==Support==
Brøndby are the most widely popular football club in Denmark, with a 2015 study having showed that Brøndby matches have by far the most viewers, both in terms of attendance and TV ratings, with Brøndby&#x27;s rivals FC Copenhagen coming in second. Copenhagen have in recent years surpassed Brøndby in terms of attendance by several thousands.

Brøndby Support is the official fanclub of Brøndby IF. It was founded in 1993 and has approximately 12,000 members.

Fanafdelingen is in some ways the spiritual successor to Brøndby Supporters Trust, which was a supporters trust with the dedicated goal of gaining influence in the club. Brøndby Supporters Trust managed to gain a board seat in the professional club in 2013. In 2018 BST was given the task of organising the groups of Brøndby Supporters Trust, Alpha Brøndby, Brøndby Support and Svinget under a common umbrella organisation. As a result of this, Fanafdelingen was born. Fanafdelingen, among other things, organises a yearly election for the board seat for the fan representative in the club. 

Brøndby is also renowned for its ultra fanscene. The most prominent group is &quot;Alpha&quot;. Founded in 2006, the group is placed in the centre of the Southside Stand and are the main organizers of songs, flags, banners and tifo. Other prominent groups are &quot;Suburban Casuals&quot;, &quot;Southside United&quot;, &quot;Svinget&quot;, &quot;Deling 43&quot; and &quot;Fri Sport&quot;.

==Recent history==

==Brøndby in European competitions==

Brøndby&#x27;s first competitive European match was on 17 September 1986 in the 1986–87 European Cup, defeating Budapest Honvéd 4–1 and later on Dynamo Berlin &quot;en route&quot; to a spot in the quarter-finals, where they lost to Porto. Since then, the club has been a regular fixture in European competitions, and reached the group stages of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League several times. They also achieved one European semi-final in 1991, as well as another European quarter-final in 1997.

==UEFA club coefficient ranking==


==Footnotes==

:A.  Danish club Aalborg BK played in the 1995–96 Champions League tournament as a result of the bribing scandal of Dynamo Kyiv, thus they did not qualify through the qualification rounds.

<text>Breed clubs are associations or clubs with activities centered on a single, specific breed of a particular species of domesticated animal. The purpose of the association will vary with the species of animal and the goals and needs of the members of the association. Breed associations or clubs may vary in their goals, activities and nomenclature from country to country, even for the same breed. Most domesticated animals, whether they are agricultural animals such as cattle, llamas, poultry, sheep and pigs, or companion animals such as pigeons, horses, cats and dogs, have breed clubs associated with the breed.

== Purpose ==
In general, breed clubs and associations create a written definition of the breed (called a breed standard) for the breed with which the organization is associated. Breed clubs also maintain important records, and provide members with information. Many breed associations also have a social component, organising various activities such as shows. In addition, they may regulate breeding or raise funds for research related to the breed.

=== Examples ===
*In horses, the Appaloosa Horse Club, established in 1938, maintains a registry for Appaloosa horses, and has the goal of &quot;preserving the horses’ heritage and history&quot; and defining the horse breed through bloodline requirements.
*The Canadian Lowline Cattle Association defines its objectives as including &quot;maintain the purity and improve the breed&quot; of cattle as well as collecting maintaining breed information and publishing a Herd Book.
*The Essex Pig Society is building up the numbers of the Essex Pig, formerly thought to be an extinct breed of the domestic pig.
*The American Buttercup Club defines its goal as connecting fanciers of the chicken breed so that they are &quot;able to share stock and valuable information about the breed.&quot;
*The Fantail Club UK, established in 1889, promotes the knowledge and enjoyment of the exhibition Fantail Pigeon in the United Kingdom.
*In cats, the Selkirk Rex Breed Club maintains a history of the breed and provides care and grooming tips to owners of the breed.
*Members of the dog breed club for the English Toy Terrier (Black and Tan) are expected to &quot;conduct themselves in a responsible and sportsman-like manner at all times.&quot;
*The OEGB Int&#x27;l Society proudly connects hobbyists of Old English Game Bantams from all around the world to discuss poultry related topics. In addition, it hosts the only US based OEGB futurity as an annual event called the MegaSpur.

== Forming a breed club ==

With the advent of the internet, anyone can create a &quot;breed club&quot; by putting up a web page to advertise their animals. Buyers must research any claims of unaffiliated breed clubs.

== Organizations covering groups of breeds ==
Breeds of animals of a particular species may have an organization that covers a large number of breeds of the species, even though each individual breed may have its own breed club. Often the multiple-breed over-association will maintain the breed records in a central location. An example of this would be the Canadian Sheep Breeder&#x27;s Association, incorporated under the Canadian Livestock Pedigree Act in 1915, which includes fifty different breeds of sheep.

== Other types of animal associations ==
Associations that include all breeds (as well as crossbred and mixed breed animals) of a particular species also exist. Usually such associations are organized for particular sports, such as hunting with raptors.

<doc id="895662" wikidata="Q4986361" url="?curid=895662" title="Buick V6 engine">
<text>The Buick V6 is an OHV V6 engine developed by the Buick division of General Motors and first introduced in 1962. The engine was originally and was marketed as the &quot;Fireball&quot; engine. GM continued to develop and refine the V6, eventually and commonly referred to simply as the 3800, through numerous iterations.

The 3800 made the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines of the 20th Century list and made Ward&#x27;s yearly 10 Best list numerous times. It is one of the most-manufactured engines in automotive history, with over 25 million produced.

The engine originally derived from Buick&#x27;s aluminium V8 family, which also went on to become the Rover V8, manufactured from 1960–2006.

==Overview==
The 3800&#x27;s block is cast iron and all variants use iron, two-valve-per-cylinder OHV heads. The engine, originally designed and manufactured in the United States, was also produced in later versions in Australia. It was the first six-cylinder engine designed exclusively for Buick products since the Buick straight-six was discontinued in 1930.

In 1967, GM sold the design to Kaiser-Jeep since they no longer felt the need to produce a V6, considered an unusual engine configuration in North America at the time. The 1973 oil crisis prompted the company to re-acquire the design from American Motors (AMC), who had purchased Kaiser-Jeep in 1970, in early 1974. The descendants of the early 231 continue as the most-common GM V6, as it developed into a very durable and reliable design.

Though the pre-3800 rear-wheel drive (RWD) V6 uses the Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac (BOP) bellhousing pattern, an oddity of both the front-wheel drive (FWD) and RWD 3800 V6 is that although it is a 90° V6, it uses the GM 60° V6 bell housing (Metric Pattern). For use in the FWD applications, the bellhousings on the FWD transmissions are altered slightly.

This engine has the cylinders numbered 1-3-5 on the left-hand bank (front bank for FWD applications) and 2-4-6 on the right-hand bank, the number 1 cylinder being the furthest from the flywheel end. The firing order is 1-6-5-4-3-2.

The engine was produced at the Flint North plant in Flint, Michigan, with engine blocks and cylinder heads cast at the Grey Iron plant (now the GM Saginaw Metal Casting Operations plant) at 1629 N. Washington Avenue in Saginaw, Michigan.

==Early versions==
===Fireball V6===
The first engine in this family, RPO code 6I, was introduced in 1961 for the 1962 model year Buick Special with Buick&#x27;s engine, the first V6 in an American car (the GMC V6 was used earlier in trucks). Because it was derived from Buick&#x27;s aluminum V8, it has a 90° bank between cylinders and an uneven firing pattern due to the crankshaft having only three crank pins set at 120° apart, with opposing cylinders (1-2, 3-4, and 5-6) sharing a crank pin in, as do many V8 engines. The uneven firing pattern was often perceived as roughness, leading a former American Motors executive to describe it as &quot;rougher than a cob.&quot;

The off-center design continued up until the 1988 LN3 version of the engine, when the left-hand bank of cylinders was moved forward relative to the right-hand bank. Although the actual bore spacing between cylinders on the same bank remained unchanged at , the LN3 and later engines became known to have &quot;on-center bore spacing&quot;.

====198====
The Buick Division, concerned about high manufacturing costs of their innovative aluminum 215 V8, sought to develop a cheaper, cast-iron engine based on the same tooling. It was given the RPO code JL. They settled on an unusual 90° V6 layout that was essentially the architecture of the &#x27;215&#x27; less two cylinders. In initial form, it had a bore and stroke of , for an overall displacement of . It weighed about more than the aluminum engine, but was far cheaper to produce. Dubbed the Fireball V6, it became the standard engine in the 1962 Buick Special. In their test that year, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; was impressed with Buick&#x27;s &quot;practical&quot; new V6, saying it &quot;sounds and performs exactly like the aluminum V8 in most respects.&quot;

====225====
The bore was increased to , and stroke increased to , increasing displacement to . Since the engine was similar to the popular small-block Buick V8—now with a cast-iron block and displacement of , the engine was made cheaply at the same factory with much of the same tooling. This engine carried the RPO code KH for the 1964 model year and LH for 1965. In 1966, the code was MH and was renamed the &quot;Wildcat V-6&quot;. For 1967, the code was NH. This engine was used in Buick&#x27;s intermediate-sized Special and Skylark models from 1964 to 1967 and Oldsmobile&#x27;s mid-sized F-85/Cutlass models for 1964 and 1965, including the Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser and Buick Sport Wagon.

1964–1965 models featured a single barrel Rochester MonoJet, producing . In 1966–1967, the 1-barrel was replaced with a 2-barrel Rochester 2GV, giving the engine a 5-horsepower boost to .

The V6 was dropped after the 1967 model year in favor of a conventional inline-six engine built by the Chevrolet division, and the tooling was sold to Kaiser-Jeep.

====Dauntless====
In 1965, Kaiser-Jeep began using the Buick 225 in Jeep CJs. It was known as the Dauntless V6 and used a much heavier flywheel than the Buick version to damp the vibrations resulting from the engine&#x27;s firing pattern. Buick sold the tooling for this engine to Kaiser in 1967, as the demand for the engine was waning steadily in an era of V8s and muscle cars. When American Motors (AMC) bought Jeep, the V6 was replaced with AMC straight-6 engines, but the ownership of the V6 tooling remained with AMC.

====231====
The 1973 oil crisis prompted GM to look for more economical engines than the V8s of 350, 400, and 454/455 cubic inches that powered most General Motors cars and trucks during that time. At that time, the only &quot;small&quot; engines generally offered by GM were built by the Chevrolet division including the OHC aluminum inline-four engine used in the subcompact Chevrolet Vega and a straight-6 used in smaller Chevy, Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac models, whose design roots dated back to the 1962 Chevy II (Nova). LD5 was the RPO for engines with chassis code &quot;A&quot;, LD7 was used for the 1977-only VIN code &quot;C&quot; engines.

One quick idea was tried by Buick engineers—taking an old Fireball V6 picked up at a junkyard and installing it into a 1974 Buick Apollo. The solution worked so well that GM wanted AMC to put the engine back into production. However, AMC&#x27;s cost per unit was deemed as too high. Instead of buying completed engines, GM made an offer to buy back the tooling and manufacturing line from AMC in April 1974, and began building the engines on August 12. With production back within GM, Buick re-introduced the V6 that fall in certain 1975 models—a move made possible by the fact that foundations for the old V6 machinery were still intact at Buick&#x27;s engine assembly plant in Flint, Michigan, so it was easy to put the old tooling back in place and begin production at least two years ahead of the normal schedule that would have been required to create new tooling. The bore was enlarged to , identical to the Buick 350 and Olds 307 V8s, yielding displacement. 78,349 units were installed in Buicks for 1975.

Due to difficulties with the new fuel economy and emissions standards, the engine produced just , depending on fitment and year.

In 1977, Buick redesigned the crankshaft to a &quot;split-pin&quot; configuration to create an &quot;even-firing&quot; version. The crank pins associated with the opposing cylinders were offset from each other by 30°. The relatively small offset did not require flying arms to be incorporated, however a thick flange was built in between the offset crank pins to prevent the connecting rod big-ends from &quot;walking&quot; off the crank pin bearing journal and interfering with the adjacent big end. The thick flange effectively caused the connecting rods on the left-hand bank of cylinders (forward bank for FWD applications) to move forward and the right-hand bank to move rearward, but the engine block remained unchanged compared to the odd-fire engine. Since the cylinders center-lines were no longer centralized over the crank pin bearing journals, the connecting rods were re-designed with the big-ends offset from the piston pin ends by . The engine in this configuration became known to have &quot;off-center bore spacing&quot;.

====LD5====

In 1978, GM began to market the 231 as the 3.8 liter as metric engine sizes became common in the United States. The &quot;RPO Code&quot; was LD5, though California-emissions versions were called LC6. Starting in 1979, the engine was used in the front-wheel drive Buick Riviera, though still with a longitudinal mounting. Larger valves and better intake and exhaust boosted the power output for 1979.

A turbocharged version was introduced as the pace car at the 1976 Indianapolis 500, and a production turbo arrived in 1978. The turbo 3.8 received sequential fuel injection and a wasted spark Distributorless Ignition System in 1984. In 1986, an air-to-air Garrett intercooler was added and the &quot;RPO Code&quot; became &quot;LC2&quot;. The LC2 engine has a bore and stroke of . The horsepower ratings for 1986 &amp; 1987 were , respectively. The limited production GNX benefitted from additional factory modifications such as a ceramic turbocharger, more efficient Garrett intercooler, low restriction exhaust system and revised programming which resulted in a factory rating.

The turbocharged 1987 Buick Regal Grand National GNX was called America&#x27;s quickest automobile, and the model continues to be collected and appreciated today.

====LC9====
A smaller version of this engine was produced in 1978 and 1979 for the Century, Regal, and Chevrolet Monza. The bore was reduced to , resulting in an engine of piston displacement. The &quot;RPO code&quot; was &quot;LC9&quot;. Initially this engine produced , but in 1979 it received the same improvements in the cylinder heads as did the LD5, and therefore power increased to .

====LC4====
In response to rising gas prices, a larger version of the 3.8 liter LD5 V6 was produced from 1980 through 1984 and marketed as an alternative to a V8. The bore was enlarged to , yielding an output of and . This engine was used in many large rear-wheel drive Buicks, and in some models from each of GM&#x27;s other divisions, including Cadillac which offered the &quot;big&quot; Buick V6 in several models from 1980 to 1982 as a credit option to the troublesome V8-6-4 engine used in 1981 and early versions of the aluminum-block Cadillac HT-4100 V8 introduced in 1982. It was also the standard powerplant in the front-drive Riviera and Oldsmobile Toronado from 1981 to 1984. Additionally, the 4.1 block was used unsuccessfully at Indianapolis for racing. Its only weakness was the intake valve seals. This was the first naturally aspirated GM V-6 to feature a 4-barrel carburetor.

==== LK9 ====
A small version of the Buick V6 was produced for GM&#x27;s 1980s front-wheel drive cars. Introduced in 1982, it was a lower deck version of the 3.8 designed for transverse application in the new GM A platform cars such as the Buick Century and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera. It shared the same bore size as its larger sibling, but featured a smaller stroke of . It used a Rochester E2ME 2-bbl carburetor and the VIN code for the engine is &quot;E&quot;.

====3.8 FWD LG2/LG3====
In mid-1984, the 3.8 liter LD5 engine was modified for transverse-mounting in smaller, FWD vehicles, and equipped with multi point fuel injection (MPFI). 1984-1985 models used a distributor and a distributorless wasted spark ignition system was added for all engines produced in 1986 and later. In 1986, it received sequential fuel injection (SFI) and it was initially produced in two forms, the LG2 with flat lifters (tappets), and the LG3 with a roller camshaft and lifters. The latter was offered in various models through 1988. From 1986, the 3.8 had a revised, crankshaft-driven oil pump which eliminated a longstanding problem with pump housing wear and loss of prime. Power produced by this engine was:
* VIN code B (LG2): flat lifters (tappets)

=== Pre-Series I ===
==== LN3 Naturally Aspirated ==== 

Introduced in 1988 and initially designated VIN code C, the &quot;3800&quot; LN3 would later be loosely considered the &quot;Pre-Series I&quot;, although the older 3.8 SFI (LG3) was still available that year in some models. The LN3 was a major redesign, with a change to on-center bore spacing (created by moving the left-hand bank of cylinders forward relative to the right-hand bank) and the addition of a balance shaft. Other features included a 3×/18× crank-trigger system and multiport fuel injection. This generation continued in use in several GM products into the early 1990s. It produced of power and of torque.

The LN3 is very closely related to the Series I L27 and Series I L67 Supercharged. In fact, supercharger-related hardware can be fitted to an LN3 without changing the cylinder heads. However, the ECM would have to be reprogrammed. The L27 has a two piece, upper plenum intake and lower intake, the LN3 is all one piece.

==== 3300 (LG7) ====

A smaller 3.3 liter &quot;3300&quot; was introduced in 1989 and produced through 1993. It was effectively a lower-deck version of the 3800, with a smaller bore and stroke of for . Like the 3800, it used a cast iron block and heads, push rods, and hydraulic lifters. Unlike the 3800, however, it used a batch-fire injection system rather than sequential injection, as evidenced by the lack of a cam position sensor. It also did not have a balance shaft. Power output was at 5,200 rpm and at 2,000 rpm with a 5,500 rpm redline.

=== Series I ===

==== L27 SI Naturally Aspirated ====

The LN3 was replaced by the L27 in mid-1990 and produces . The slight power increase was accompanied by more torque in the mid-range, all thanks to a new, two-piece intake manifold with longer runners. Other improvements over the LN3 included wider connecting rod bearings, a new timing chain tensioner, dual-wall exhaust pipes, new heat shields for the exhaust manifolds, and sound absorbing, composite molded valve covers. This engine is referred to as the Series I 3800, or 3800 TPI (Tuned Port Injection).

In Australia, the LN3 was also replaced by the L27 by Holden who used the engine in their series 2 (1991) VN Commodore range. However, the Australian L27 retained the LN3&#x27;s one piece upper intake and lower plenum. Power was still boosted to for the Holden L27, before being boosted to in the revised VR Commodore in 1993. The L36 made its debut in 1995.

==== L67 SI Supercharged ====
The Series I Supercharged engine went through two supercharger revisions (Gen2 and Gen3) and the horsepower improved between initial launch and the time that the Series II L36 was introduced. The M62 supercharger was manufactured by Eaton, for the GM 3800 SI engine. HP was rated at 205 for 1991–1993 engines (Gen2 supercharger) with a pulley, and 225 for 1994–1995 engines (Gen3 supercharger). All of the additional horsepower for 1994–95 Gen3 supercharged engines was gained by using epoxy (not Teflon as commonly believed) coated supercharger rotors to improve efficiency, a larger supercharger inlet and throttle body. Thus, the Gen3 utilized a pulley versus the pulley on the Gen2. The easiest way to spot the difference between the Gen2 and Gen3 is the smaller pulley and the ribs on the side of the Gen2 extend all the way down the sides, while the Gen3 ribs are on only the top. They perform slightly differently, and interchanging one without tuning may cause engine problems. Redline on Gen3 engines is at 6000 rpm, but the ECM will shift at 5400 rpm without performance shift enabled.

=== Series II ===
Introduced in 1995, the &quot;Series II&quot; is quite a different engine. It is also by far the most popular of the 3800 family for its power, smoothness, fuel efficiency, and reliability, although the stroke for the 3.8 liter engine remained at , and the bore remained at . That said, the engine architecture was vastly changed. The deck height is shorter than the Series I, reducing weight and total engine package size. This required that the piston connecting rods be shortened , and the crankshaft was also redesigned. A new intake manifold improved breathing while a redesigned cylinder head featured larger valves and a higher compression ratio. The result was and , better fuel economy, and lighter overall weight (to ). This 3800 weighs only more than the all-aluminum High Feature V6 that currently dominates GM&#x27;s six-cylinder applications, despite being an all cast-iron design.

The new intake manifold greatly improved airflow. To meet emissions standards, an EGR tube was placed in the intake manifold to reduce combustion temperatures.

The 3800 Series II was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 1995 through 1997.

GM recalled 1.5 million vehicles with this engine on April 14, 2009 due to risk of fire from engine oil leaking under the valve cover gaskets onto hot exhaust manifolds. The fire could spread to the nearby plastic spark plug wire retainers on the valve cover and then to the rest of the engine compartment. GM fitted the affected vehicles with redesigned spark plug wire retainers. These engines were noted for having problems with the plastic upper intake manifold cracking around the EGR passage. The engine would then hydrolock. The lower intake gaskets and upper intake manifolds were revised, correcting all these issues.

==== L67 SII Supercharged ====

The L67 is the supercharged version of the 3800 Series II L36 and appeared in 1996, one year after the naturally aspirated version. It uses the Eaton Generation III M90 supercharger with a pulley, a larger throttle body, different fuel injectors, different cylinder heads, and a different lower intake manifold. The L67 and L36 do not share pistons. L67 pistons are heavier and have a different height to lower compression. Both engines share the same engine blocks, but compression is reduced from 9.4:1 in the L36 to 8.5:1 for the L67. GM listed the engine output as and of torque. Final drive ratios are reduced in most applications, for better fuel economy and for improved use of the engine&#x27;s torque in the low RPM range. Like most 3800 V6s, the engine is well known for its reliability and low maintenance costs. The engine is a popular choice for aftermarket modification thanks to its very strong internals and impressive power gains from basic upgrades. The engine was built in Flint, Michigan, and was certified LEV in 2001.

=== Series III ===
The &quot;Series III&quot; engines include many changes. The upper and lower intake manifold is now aluminum on the naturally aspirated models. Intake ports are mildy enlarged; intake valves (instead of as on Series II) and exhaust valves were introduced in 2003 engines, just before switching to Series III. Electronic throttle control is added to all versions, as is returnless fuel injection. Stronger powdered metal sinter forged connecting rods are used in 2004+ supercharged, and 2005+ naturally aspirated engines, instead of the cast iron style from Series II engines. Emissions are also reduced. In 2005, it was the first gasoline engine in the industry to attain SULEV (Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle) emissions certification.

Also note that Series III engines are the base for any 3800 produced for the 2004 year and up. This means the same block, heads, and connecting rods apply to any remaining Series II engines made after 2004 also. The difference is that Series III engines received the new superchargers (Generation 5 – Eaton M90 – if equipped), intake manifolds, fuel systems, powdered connecting rods, as well as larger intake valves, drive by wire throttle body and electronics.

==== L26 SIII Naturally Aspirated ====

The &quot;L26&quot; is the &quot;Series III&quot; version of the 3800. It is still a design. Compression remains at 9.4:1 as with the L36, but the aluminum upper and lower intake (2004+) and stronger connecting rods (2005+) are the primary physical changes. The powdered metal connecting rods were meant to be introduced in 2004 along with the L32, but the GM plant in Bay City, Michigan that supplies the Flint, Michigan plant could not achieve the desired production dates in time for that engine year.
* 2004–2008 Pontiac Grand Prix
* 2005–2009 Buick LaCrosse/Allure

==== L32 SIII Supercharged ====
The &quot;L32&quot; is a supercharged &quot;Series III&quot;.
Introduced in 2004, the main differences between the L67 and the L32 are the L32&#x27;s electronic throttle control, slightly improved cylinder head design, and updated Eaton supercharger, the Generation 5 M90. Power output is up to in the Grand Prix GTP.

As with the L67, premium fuel (91 octane or higher) is required, but the PCM can compensate for lower octane fuel at the cost of lower power output. The use of below 87 octane fuel can cause detonation that eventually leads to engine damage and failure.

<text>The [[United States]] Olympic &amp; Paralympic Hall of Fame is an honor roll of the top American Olympic and Paralympic athletes headquartered at the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Museum, opened in April 2020 in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

The Hall of Fame was established by the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee in 1979; the first members were inducted in 1983. Between 1992 and 2003, the Hall of Fame went dormant, with no induction of new members. In 2004, the honor was revived, and continued in 2005 when the Class of 2006 was selected.

The current process for selecting inductees is two-staged. Fifteen finalists are selected by a nominating committee consisting of athletes, members of the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame, historians and USOC representatives. The inductees were then selected based on online voting at www.usolympicteam.com, with a requirement to select five individual athletes, one team, one Paralympian and one coach. When the inductees are announced, a veteran and a &quot;special contributor&quot; are also included.

As of 2022, total membership has been brought to 119 Olympians and Paralympians, 11 teams, five coaches, 10 veterans, 19 contributors and two Olive Branch award inductees.

<text>Merychippus is an extinct proto-horse of the family Equidae that was endemic to North America during the Miocene, 15.97–5.33 million years ago. It had three toes on each foot and is the first horse known to have grazed.

==Discovery and naming==

&quot;Merychippus&quot; was named by Joseph Leidy (1856). Numerous authors assigned the type species – &quot;Merychippus insignis&quot; – to &quot;Protohippus&quot;, but this is ignored. It was assigned to the Equidae by Leidy (1856) and Carroll (1988), and to the Equinae by MacFadden (1998) and Bravo-Cuevas and Ferrusquía-Villafranca (2006). Its name means &quot;ruminant horse&quot;, but current evidence does not support &quot;Merychippus&quot; ruminating.

==Description==

&quot;Merychippus&quot; lived in groups. It was about tall and at the time it was the tallest equine to have existed. Its muzzle was longer, deeper jaw, and eyes wider apart than any other horse-like animal to date. The brain was also much larger, making it smarter and more agile. &quot;Merychippus&quot; was the first equine to have the distinctive head shape of today&#x27;s horses.

The Miocene was a time of drastic change in environment, with woodlands transforming into grass plains. This led to evolutionary changes in the hooves and teeth of equids. A change in surface from soft, uneven mud to hard grasslands meant there was less need for increased surface area. The foot was fully supported by ligaments, and the middle toe developed into a hoof that did not have a pad on the bottom. In some &quot;Merychippus&quot; species, the side toes were larger, whereas in others, they had become smaller and only touched the ground when running. The transformation into plains also meant &quot;Merychippus&quot; began consuming more phytolith rich plants. This led to the presence of hypsodont teeth. Such teeth range from medium to intense crown height, are curved, covered in large amounts of cement, and are characteristic of grazing animals

Equid size also increased, with &quot;Merychippus&quot; ranging, on average, between 71 and 100.6 kg.

==Classification==

By the end of the Miocene era, &quot;Merychippus&quot; was one of the first quick grazers. It gave rise to at least 19 different species of grazers, which can be categorized into three major groups. This burst of diversification, termed an adaptive radiation, is often known as the &quot;Merychippine radiation&quot;.

The first was a series of three-toed grazers known as hipparions. These were very successful and split into four genera and at least 16 species, including small and large grazers and browsers with large and elaborate facial fossae. The second was a group of smaller horses, known as protohippines, which included &quot;Protohippus&quot; and &quot;Calippus&quot;. The last was a line of &quot;true equines&quot; in which the side toes were smaller than those of other proto-horses. In later genera, these were lost altogether as a result of the development of side ligaments that helped stabilize the middle toe during running.

<text>Sony BMG Music Entertainment was an American record company owned as a 50–50 joint venture between Sony Corporation of America and Bertelsmann. The venture&#x27;s successor, the revived Sony Music, is wholly owned by Sony, following their buyout of the remaining 50% held by Bertelsmann. BMG was instead rebuilt as BMG Rights Management on the basis of the remaining 200 artists.

==History==
Sony BMG Music Entertainment began as the result of a merger between Sony Music (part of Sony) and Bertelsmann Music Group (part of Bertelsmann) completed on August 6, 2004. It was one of the Big Four music companies and includes ownership and distribution of recording labels such as Arista Records, Columbia Records, Epic Records, J Records, Mchenry Records, Jive Records, RCA Victor Records, RCA Records, Legacy Recordings, Sonic Wave America and others. The merger affected all Sony Music and Bertelsmann Music Group companies worldwide except for Japan, where it was felt that it would reduce competition in that country&#x27;s music industry significantly.

Financial analysts covering the merger anticipated that up to 2,000 jobs would be cut as a result, saving Sony BMG approximately $350 million annually.

The company&#x27;s chief executive officer (CEO) was Rolf Schmidt-Holtz, who succeeded Andrew Lack on February 10, 2006. In the first half of 2005, the company&#x27;s share of new releases in the United States (US) declined from 33% to 26% according to Nielsen SoundScan. This, and Lack&#x27;s negotiation of what some called an &quot;ill-conceived&quot; deal with Bruce Springsteen led to Bertelsmann informing Sony that it would not renew Lack&#x27;s contract.

The company signed a content deal with the popular video sharing community YouTube.

On August 5, 2008, Sony Corporation agreed to buy Bertelsmann AG&#x27;s 50 percent stake in the music company for $1.2 billion to get full control. The music company was renamed Sony Music Entertainment and became a unit of Sony Corporation of America. This allowed Sony the rights to artists on the current and historic BMG roster and allowed Sony Corporation to better integrate its functions with its PlayStation 3 and upcoming new media initiatives. As part of the buyout, Bertelsmann kept the rights to master recordings by 200 artists, which formed the basis for a second version of BMG.

Sony and Bertelsmann last teamed up in 2013, in a failed bid to acquire Parlophone from Universal Music Group. BMG would administer the label&#x27;s back catalogue, while its current artists would sign with Sony. While Sony BMG failed to win Parlophone (which ultimately went to Warner Music Group), BMG acquired Mute Records&#x27; back catalogue and licensed Depeche Mode and the catalogue of The Echo Label to Sony.

==Controversies==

Epic Records, one of their labels, was specifically cited for using fake contests in order to hide the fact that the gifts were going to disc jockeys rather than listeners.

===Rootkit scandal===

On 31 October 2005, a scandal erupted over digital rights management (DRM) software produced and shipped by Sony BMG that automatically installed itself on people&#x27;s computers and made them more vulnerable to computer viruses. The scandal and attendant controversy about the practice of software auto-installation spawned several lawsuits. Sony BMG eventually recalled all of the affected CDs.

On November 16, 2005, US-CERT, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, part of the United States Department of Homeland Security, issued an advisory on Extended Copy Protection DRM, citing the XCP use of rootkit technology to hide certain files from the computer user as a security threat to computer users, saying that a Sony-provided uninstallation option also introduced computer system vulnerabilities.

US-CERT advised, &quot;Do not install software from sources that you do not expect to contain software, such as an audio CD.&quot; In its &quot;Top Flops of &#x27;05&quot; issue, the enterprise newsweekly eWeek had to create a new category for the &quot;Sony BMG root-kit fiasco.&quot; Peter Coffee of eWeek Labs reported, &quot;The Sony brand name was already in trouble—it lost 16 percent of its value between 2004 and 2005...

Now it has taken a blow among tech-product opinion leaders. &quot;We&#x27;ve never done it before, and we hope we&#x27;ll never have [an] occasion to do it again but, for 2005, eWeek Labs awards a Stupid Tech Trick grand prize to Sony.&quot; eWeek Vol. 22, No.50

===Kazaa file-sharing lawsuit===

In October 2007, Sony BMG, alongside other large music firms, successfully sued Jammie Thomas for making 24 songs available for download on the Kazaa file-sharing network. Thomas, who made US$36,000 a year, was ordered to pay US$222,000 in damages. Thomas had allegedly shared 1702 files in total; the court upholding the award called it an &quot;aggravated case of willful infringement&quot;.

===Children&#x27;s online privacy violations===
In 2008, the Federal Trade Commission sued Sony BMG for collecting and displaying personal data of 30,000 minors without parental consent via its websites since 2004, violating the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act. Sony did not restrict minor children&#x27;s participation in its websites. Sony paid a $1 million fine.

<text>A feral cat or a stray cat is an unowned domestic cat (Felis catus) that lives outdoors and avoids human contact; it does not allow itself to be handled or touched, and usually remains hidden from humans. Feral cats may breed over dozens of generations and become a local apex predator in urban, savannah and bushland environments, and especially on islands where native animals did not evolve alongside predators. Some feral cats may become more comfortable with people who regularly feed them, but even with long-term attempts at socialization, they usually remain aloof and reject human touch. Of the 700 million cats in the world, an estimated 480 million are feral.

Feral cats are devastating to wildlife, and conservation biologists consider them to be one of the worst invasive species on Earth. They are included in the list of the world&#x27;s 100 worst invasive alien species. Attempts to control feral cat populations are widespread but generally of greatest impact within purpose-fenced reserves.

Some animal rights groups advocate for trap-neuter-return (TNR) programs, also known as trap-neuter-vaccinate-release (TNVR) programs, to prevent feral cats from breeding and being nuisances by spraying urine and fighting over territory. Scientific evidence has demonstrated that TNR is not effective at controlling feral cat populations alone and must be done alongside removal. For TNR to be effective, at least 88% of the cat colony should be neutered which is an unrealistic goal in majority of cases, and any lower rates actually increase cat populations. TNR also takes much longer to eliminate cat colonies as compared to trap and euthanasia and it is more expensive and resource-intensive. TNR receives many criticisms of it being inhumane, to the point that some say that TNR stands for trap-neuter-reabandon, because feral cats do not have good lives and die early from disease, poisoning, predation, vehicle collisions and sometimes violence by humans. A possibly more effective alternative to TNR has been proposed, which is trap-vasectomy-hysterectomy-release (TVHR).

== Definitions ==
The meaning of the term &quot;feral cat&quot; varies between professions and countries, and is sometimes used interchangeably with other terms such as &quot;free-roaming&quot;, &quot;street&quot;, &quot;alley,&quot; or &quot;community cat&quot;. Some of these terms are also used to refer to &quot;stray&quot; cats, although stray and feral cats are generally considered to be different by rescuers, veterinarians, and researchers. The lines between stray and feral cat are diffuse. The general idea is that owned cats that wander away from their homes may become stray cats, and stray cats that have lived in the wild for some time may become feral.

Activists who seek to normalize feral cats in the environment are attempting to rebrand feral cats as &quot;community cats&quot;. Biologists say that this new term is euphemistic and distracts from feral cats being an environmental problem, and that it has connotations that falsely imply that feral cats exist with the consent of the communities where they live, and that the public has a moral obligation to support them in the outdoors. Studies have shown that the public does not support there being large numbers of free ranging cats in the outdoors, but that the use of language in surveys appears to influence the levels of support for different management options.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, a feral cat is defined as a cat that chooses not to interact with humans, survives with or without human assistance, and hides or defends itself when trapped rather than allowing itself to be handled. Animal rescuers and veterinarians consider cats to be feral when they had not had much human contact particularly before eight weeks of age, avoid humans, and prefer to escape rather than attack a human. Feral cats are distinguished from domesticated cats based on their levels of socialization, ownership, and confinement, and on the amount of fear of, interaction with, and dependence upon humans. However, veterinarians and rescuers disagreed on whether a feral cat would tend to hiss and spit at or attack a human during an encounter, and disagreed on whether adult feral cats could potentially be tamed.

=== Italy ===

In Italy, feral cats have been protected since 1991, and it is illegal to kill them. In Rome, they are surgically neutered by veterinarians of the Veterinary Public Services. Programs for sterilization of stray cats are also implemented in the Padua and Venice Provinces.

===United States===
A survey of rescue and veterinary facilities in the United States revealed that no widely accepted definition of a feral cat exists. Many facilities used waiting periods to evaluate whether a cat was feral by observing whether the cat became less afraid and evasive over time. Other indicators included the cat&#x27;s response to touch with an inanimate object, and observation of the cats&#x27; social behavior in varying environments such as response to human contact, with a human nearby, or when moved to a quieter environment.

=== Australia ===
The Australian government categorizes cats who have no interaction with or assistance from humans as feral, and unowned cats who rely on humans as semi-feral or stray. However, even these so-called &#x27;managed colonies&#x27; often have a devastating impact on wildlife as demonstrated in the decimation of native mammals in adjacent reserves, such as occurred with numbats and woylies in Western Australia.

=== Farm cat ===
A farm cat is a free-ranging domestic cat that lives in a cat colony on agricultural farms in a feral or semi-feral condition. Farm cats primarily live outdoors and usually shelter in barns. They are partially supplied with food and milk, but mainly subsist on hunting rodents such as black rat, brown rat, common vole and &quot;Apodemus&quot; species. In England, farm cat colonies are present on the majority of farms and consist of up to 30 cats. Female farm cats show allomothering behaviour; they use communal nests and take care of kittens of other colony members.

Some animal rescue organizations maintain Barn Cat Programs and rehome neutered feral cats to people who are looking for barn cats.

===Ship&#x27;s cat===

Domestic cats have been members of ship crews since the beginning of commercial navigation. Phoenician and Etruscan traders probably carried cats on board their trading vessels to Italy and the Mediterranean islands.

== History ==
Cats in ancient Egypt were venerated for killing rodents and venomous snakes.
The need to keep rodents from consuming or contaminating grain crops stored for later human consumption may be the original reason that cats were domesticated. The spread of cats throughout much of the world is thought to have originated in Egypt. Scientists do not agree on whether cats were domesticated in Ancient Egypt or introduced there after domestication. Phoenician traders brought them to Europe for control of rat populations, and monks brought them further into Asia. Roman armies also contributed spreading cats and eventually brought them to Britain. Since then, cats continued to be introduced to new countries, often by sailors or settlers. Cats are thought to have been introduced to Australia in either the 1600s by Dutch shipwrecks, or the late 1700s by English settlers. These domesticated cats began to form feral populations after their offspring began living away from human contact.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, several cat specimens were described as wildcat subspecies that are considered feral cat populations today:
*&quot;Felis silvestris sarda&quot;, proposed by Fernand Lataste in 1885, was a skin and a skull of a male cat from Sarrabus in Sardinia that looked like an African wildcat (&quot;Felis lybica&quot;), but was more reddish, gray and brown and had longer hair on the back. In the 1980s, Colin Groves assessed values of Schauenberg&#x27;s index of cat skulls of zoological specimens that originated in the Mediterranean islands. Based on these values, he concluded that Sardinian wildcats are descendants of African wildcats that were introduced from North Africa&#x27;s Maghreb region. Results of zooarchaeological research indicate that Sardinian wildcats descended from domestic cats that were introduced during the Roman Empire, and probably originated in the Near East.
*&quot;Felis reyi&quot;, proposed by Louis Lavauden in 1929, was a skin and a skull of a specimen from Biguglia in Corsica that was smaller and darker than the European wildcat (&quot;Felis silvestris&quot;), had a much shorter tail than the African wildcat, and differed in fur colour and markings from both. When Reginald Innes Pocock reviewed &quot;Felis&quot; skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London, he considered &quot;Felis reyi&quot; a synonym of &quot;Felis lybica sarda&quot;, the Sardinian wild cat. The Corsican wildcat is considered to have been introduced in the early first millennium. The earliest known fossil records of cats date to the early 14th century, but older chronostratigraphic layers revealed fossils of livestock introduced since the Iron Age.
*&quot;Felis lybica jordansi&quot;, proposed by Ernst Schwarz in 1930, was a skull and skin of a male specimen from Santa Margarita in Mallorca that had more pronounced stripes than the African wildcat. This is also considered to have descended from domestic cats introduced to the island.
*&quot;Felis silvestris cretensis&quot;, proposed by Theodor Haltenorth in 1953, was a cat skin purchased in a bazaar in Chania that resembled an African wildcat, but had a bushy tail like a European wildcat. Groves considered the Cretan wildcat an introduced feral cat.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The feral cat is the most widely distributed terrestrial carnivore. It occurs between 55° North and 54.3° South latitudes in a wide range of climatic zones and islands in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea, including Canary Islands, Port-Cros, Dassen Island, Marion Island, Juan de Nova Island, Réunion, Hahajima, Okinawa Island, Raoul Island, Herekopare Island, Stewart Island, Macquarie Island, Galápagos Islands, San Clemente Island, Isla Natividad, San José Island, and New Island.
Feral cat colonies also occur on the Japanese islands of Ainoshima, Hahajima and Aoshima, Ehime.
The feral cat population on the Hawaiian Islands is mainly of European origin and probably arrived in the 19th century on ships.

Feral cat colonies in Rome have been monitored since 1991. Urban feral cats were studied in Madrid, Jerusalem and Ottawa.

==Behavior and ecology==
Some behaviors of feral cats are commonly observed, although there is disagreement among veterinarians, rescuers and researchers on the prevalence of some. In a free-roaming environment, feral cats avoid humans. They do not allow themselves to be handled or touched by humans, and back away or run when they are able to do so. If trapped, they hiss, growl, bare their teeth, or strike out. They remain fairly hidden from humans and will not approach, although some feral cats gradually become more comfortable around humans who feed them regularly.

Most feral cats have small home ranges, although some are more transient and travel long distances. The home ranges of male feral cats, which are generally two or three times larger than those of female cats, are on average under , but can vary from almost to under . This variance is often due to breeding season, access to females, whether the cat is neutered, age, time of day, and availability of prey.

Feral cats depend on the presence of human settlement to subsist. Colonies and stray feral cats will settle in urban, suburban, and rural developments like cities and farms, wherever they can find easy access to food or prey animals. Few to no feral cats are found significantly distant from human settlements. While feral cats prey on other small mammals and reptiles, their home ranges don&#x27;t change to reflect the seasonal availability of prey animals. This indicates that feral cats have a fairly consistent home range, and migration is more representative of mate availability, consistency in human-related food sources, or other less transient stimuli.

=== Colonies ===

Feral cats often live in groups called colonies, which are located close to food sources and shelter. Researchers disagree on the existence, extent, and structure of dominance hierarchies among feral cats in colonies. Different types of hierarchies have been observed in colonies, including despotic and linear hierarchies. Some colonies are organized in more complex structures, such as relative hierarchies, where social status of individual cats varies with location, time of day, or the activity the cats are engaged in, particularly feeding and mating.

A &#x27;managed colony&#x27; is taken care of by humans who supply food and water to the cats, provide shelters and veterinary care, implement trap-neuter-return programs, find foster homes for cats that can be socialized for eventual adoption, and educate people in the neighborhood.

Feral cats are known to move from colony to colony when home ranges overlap. Additionally, colony populations fluctuate as cats leave family homes and some feral and semi-feral cats get socialized to home life and become family pets.

=== Socialization ===
Feral kittens can be trapped and socialized, then adopted into a home. The age at which a kitten becomes difficult to socialize is not agreed upon, but suggestions generally range from seven weeks to four months of age. Although older cats can sometimes be socialized, it is a very long and difficult process, and the cat rarely becomes friendly and may remain fearful.

In a 2013 study with British participants, rescuers tended to be more willing than veterinarians to attempt to tame adult feral cats. Veterinarians tended to be more opposed to this practice, with some expressing concerns for the welfare of such a cat in a home environment. In a 2010 interview survey with veterinarians and rescuers in the United States, 66% of respondents had socialization programs for kittens, and 8% for adult cats.

In Parañaque, Philippines, netizens lauded the building of wooden cattery, &quot;Cat Homes&quot; for &quot;Puspin&quot; (Pusang Pinoy) or stray cats.

=== Diet ===
Feral cats are either mesopredators (mid-ranking predators) or apex predators (top predators) in local ecosystems. They prey on a wide variety of both vertebrates and invertebrates, and typically prefer smaller animals with body weights under , particularly mammals, birds, and lizards. Their global prey spectrum encompasses over 1,000 species; the most commonly observed were the house mouse, European rabbit, black rat, house sparrow, and common blackbird.
In Australia, they prey on introduced species like the European rabbit and house mouse, and on native rodents and marsupials, particularly the common ringtail possum.

In the United States some people advocate for feral cats as a means to control pigeons and invasive rodents like the house mouse and brown rat, although these cosmopolitan species co-evolved with cats in human-disturbed environments and so have an advantage over native rodents in evading cat predation. Studies in California showed that 67% of the mice killed by cats were native species, and that areas near feral cat colonies actually have larger house mouse populations, but fewer birds and native rodents.

Though cats usually prey on animals less than half their size, a feral cat in Australia was photographed killing an adult pademelon of around the cat&#x27;s weight at .

African feral cats have been observed directly pilfering milk from the elephant seal&#x27;s teat.

===Predators===

Feral cats are prey of feral dogs, dingoes, coyotes, caracals and birds of prey.

== Health ==

===Life span and survival===

==== Without human assistance ====
Adult feral cats without human assistance have been found in surprisingly good condition. In Florida, a study of feral cats admitted to a trap-neuter-return (TNR) program concluded that &quot;euthanasia for debilitated cats for humane reasons is rarely necessary&quot;. A further study of over 100,000 feral and stray cats admitted to TNR programs in diverse locations of the U.S. resulted in the same 0.4% rate of euthanasia for debilitating conditions. The body condition of feral cats entering a TNR program in Florida was described as &quot;generally lean but not emaciated&quot;. However, many feral cats had suffered from parasites such as fleas and ear mites before entering TNR programs.

==== With human assistance ====
Feral cats in managed colonies can live long lives. A number of cats in managed colonies in the United Kingdom died of old age.

A long-term study of a trap-neuter-return (TNR) program on a university campus in Central Florida found that, despite widespread concern about the welfare of free-roaming cats, 83% of the cats studied had been present for more than six years, with almost half first observed as adults of unknown age. The authors compared this result to a 1984 study that found the mean life span for domesticated cats was 7.1 years.

=== Disease ===

====Types====
Feral cats, like all cats, are susceptible to diseases and infections including rabies, bartonellosis, toxoplasmosis, feline panleukopenia virus, external and internal parasites, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), rickettsial diseases, ringworm, and feline respiratory disease complex (a group of respiratory illnesses including feline herpesvirus type 1, feline calicivirus, &quot;Chlamydophila felis&quot;, and &quot;Mycoplasma haemofelis)&quot;.

Feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus belong to the &quot;Retroviridae&quot; family, and both cause immunosuppression in cats, which can increase their susceptibility to other infections. Research has shown that the prevalence of these viruses among feral cat populations is low and is similar to prevalence rates for owned cats in the United States.

Researchers studying 553 feral cats in North Florida in the United States tested them for a number of infections that could be detrimental to feline or human health. The study found the most prevalent infection to be &quot;Bartonella henselae&quot;, the cause of cat-scratch disease in humans, with 33.6% of the cats testing positive. Feline coronavirus was the next most common infection, found in 18.3% of the cats, although they noted that the antibody levels were low in most of the cats who tested positive, and concluded that the cats they tested did not appear to be a greater risk for shedding the virus than pet cats. Researchers studying 96 feral cats on Prince Edward Island in Canada found that feline roundworm was the most common infection in cats in that colony, afflicting 34% of cats. This was followed by &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, which was detected in 29.8% of cats, although only one cat of the 78 for whom fecal samples were available was shedding &quot;T. gondii&quot; oocysts. They did note that most fecal samples collected indicated the presence of one intestinal parasite, with some samples indicating the presence of multiple parasites.

==== Transmission to humans ====

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has warned about the rabies risk associated with feral cats. With 16% of people infected with rabies from exposure to rabid cats, cats have been the primary animals responsible for transmission of the virus to humans in the United States since the efforts to control rabies in dogs in the 1970s. In 2010, there were 303 rabid cats reported within the United States. Although some colony management programs involve administering rabies vaccines, the need to revaccinate every few years makes this challenging to maintain. Furthermore, lack of documentation can mean that contact with vaccinated feral cats may still require post-exposure treatment.

The study of feral cats on Prince Edward Island warned of &quot;considerable zoonotic risk&quot; for transmission of intestinal parasites. Although the authors noted that their study did not provide evidence for great risk associated with &quot;T. gondii&quot; in cats, they advised that the risk should still be considered, as the infection in humans can cause significant health problems, and cats who are not otherwise transmitting the infection can begin shedding the parasite in times of stress.

== Control and management ==
Feral cats are controlled or managed by various agencies to manage disease, for the protection of native wildlife and to protect their welfare. Control of feral cats can be managed through trapping and euthanasia or other forms of lethal control, or, some claim, through trap-neuter-return (TNR). Scientific research has not found TNR to be an effective means of controlling the feral cat population. Literature reviews have found that, in the instances where studies documented TNR colonies that declined in population, those declines were being driven primarily by substantial percentages of colony cats being permanently removed from colonies by some combination of re-homing and euthanasia on an ongoing basis. TNR colonies often increase in population because cats breed quickly and the trapping and sterilization rates are frequently too low to stop this population growth, because food is usually being provided to the cats, and because public awareness of a TNR colony tends to encourage people in the surrounding community to dump their own unwanted pet cats there. The growing popularity of TNR, even near areas of particular ecological sensitivity, has been attributed in part to the failure of scientists to communicate the environmental harm caused by feral cats to the public, and their unwillingness to engage with TNR advocates.

Trap-neuter-return involves trapping feral cats, vaccinating, spaying or neutering them, and then returning them to the place where there were originally trapped. TNR programs are prevalent in several countries, including England, Italy, Canada, and the United States, and are supported by many local and state governments. Proponents of TNR argue that it is effective in stopping reproduction and reducing the population over time. TNR results in fewer complaints, as nuisance behaviors diminish following neutering, and the quality of life of the cats is improved. The practice is reported to save money and garner more public support and better morale than efforts that involve killing cats. TNR is popular, but there&#x27;s little evidence that TNR by itself can control the growing population of free roaming cats.

The International Companion Animal Management Coalition advocates for TNR as a humane method of controlling feral cat populations. In the U.S., the practice is endorsed by the Humane Society of the United States. and the National Animal Control Association, TNR is opposed by the Australian Veterinary Association, the National Audubon Society, the National Wildlife Federation, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the American Association of Wildlife Veterinarians, the Wildlife Society, the American Bird Conservancy, and PETA. Some U.S. military bases have TNR programs, but the United States Navy prohibits such programs on Navy land.

In the US, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), in 2016, adopted a resolution that &quot;encourages collaborative efforts to identify humane and effective alternatives to the destruction of healthy cats for animal control purposes, while minimizing their negative impact on native wildlife and public health.&quot; The AVMA voiced support for &quot;properly managed [feral cat] colonies&quot; outside &quot;wildlife-sensitive ecosystems&quot; but stated that &quot;[t]he goal of colony management should be continual reduction and eventual elimination of the colony through attrition.&quot; The AVMA stated that &quot;free-roaming abandoned and feral cats that are not in properly managed colonies should be removed from their environment and treated in the same manner as other abandoned and stray animals in accordance with local and state ordinances&quot; and that &quot;[f]or colonies not achieving attrition and posing active threats to the area in which they are residing, the AVMA does not oppose the consideration of euthanasia when conducted by qualified personnel, using appropriate humane methods as described in the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals.&quot;. According to estimates from the Humane Society of the United States, the population of feral cats in the US ranges from 50 to 70 million. In contrast, the number of pet cats in the US stands at approximately 76 million.

The effectiveness of both trap-and-euthanise and TNR programmes is largely dependent upon controlling immigration of cats into cleared or controlled areas; where immigration of new cats is controlled, both techniques can be effective. However where immigration is not controlled, culling is more effective. Comparisons of different techniques have also found that trap-and-euthanise programmes are half the cost of TNR ones. An analysis of both techniques in Hawaii suggested they are less effective when new cats were introduced by the abandonment of pets. The usefulness of TNR is disputed by some scientists and conservation specialists, who argue that TNR is only concerned with cat welfare and ignores the ongoing damage caused by feeding outdoor populations of neutered cats, including the depredation of wildlife, transmission of diseases, and the accumulation of cat faeces in the environment. Conservation scientists also question the effectiveness of TNR at controlling numbers of feral cats. Some studies that have supported TNR have also been criticised for using anecdotal data to evaluate their effectiveness.

In order for TNR to reduce the cat population, sterilisation rates of at least 75% must be maintained at all times, particularly because TNR practitioners providing cats with food makes the problem worse by increasing the survival rate of feral kittens. Also, this food source causes other cats to be drawn into the colony from outside. Members of the public often begin dumping unwanted pet cats at TNR sites, increasing the rate of recruitment. And neutered cats are less territorial, allowing for higher populations. TNR programs are sometimes able to attain local reductions in the numbers of cats at specific colony locations, but it has never been demonstrated to meaningfully impact cat populations over large areas or regions, because the effort necessary to maintain sufficient sterilisation rates means that systemic TNR will never be a credible option. For example, to reduce a typical Australian city&#x27;s population of 700,000 feral cats through TNR would require sterilising at least 500,000 of them initially, and then continuing to sterilise more than 75% of the kittens that the other 200,000 would continue to produce each year indefinitely, along with all the new recruits from other cat populations drawn by the food supply.

TNR is backed by well-funded advocacy organizations: in 2010, Alley Cat Allies spent US$3 million advocating to legalise TNR throughout the United States, while the Best Friends Animal Society spent $11 million on a &quot;Focus on Felines&quot; initiative that included TNR advocacy. Promoters of TNR are often funded by big businesses with a commercial interest in selling cat food, such as pet food mills and the pet products retailer PetSmart. While TNR is a popular approach to resolving the over population problem, it is not a ubiquitously accepted method. Another perspective emphasizes the poor outdoor living conditions of feral cats, and advocates for rehoming, adoption, or euthanasia as a more ethical response. This perspective centers the pressure feral cats place on the ecosystem, which is alternative to the popular position that centers the value of each cat&#x27;s life.

===TNR and wildlife===
De-sexing cats, as in TNR programs, does nothing to prevent them from continuing to destroy wildlife. In Mandurah, Western Australia, a single, neutered, semi-feral cat raided a protected fairy tern colony on at least six nights in November 2018. It killed at least six breeding adult fairy terns; directly or indirectly killed at least 40 nestlings, and caused enough stress on the fairy tern colony that all 111 nests were abandoned; resulting in a complete breeding failure for the entire colony of threatened seabirds. The predation was documented by wildlife cameras, as well as by the presence of cat tracks, cat scat, decapitated fairy terns, and injured and missing fairy tern nestlings. Though the colony was surrounded by ultrasound generators intended to deter cats, the fairy tern colony might have been an irresistible target, and this particular cat was white and had a blue eye, traits commonly associated with deafness.

=== Management in sensitive environments ===
In sensitive environments, such as delicate ecosystems that have been degraded by feral cats, population management can be quite difficult. On isolated Pacific islands, trapping and removing the feral population too quickly can have adverse effects including booms in rodent and small reptile populations previously checked by the feral cat population. This new dynamic may prove to be more harmful, with further upstream effects on the ecosystem that were not predicted before removal of the feral cat population. With such a sensitive system to account for, solutions for population control will likely differ from case to case, and especially in different ecosystems where feral cats are to be controlled.

== Effects on wildlife ==
In the United States, free-ranging cats kill one to four billion birds and six to 22 billion mammals annually.

In Australia, domestic cats were introduced in the 1800s to settlements that had developed near gold mining sites and farms as a pest control strategy to decimate rabbits, mice, and rats. Feral cats kill on average one million reptiles each day. Feral cats in Australia kill over 1.5 billion native mammals, birds, reptiles and frogs, and 1.1 billion invertebrates each year. Predation by cats is a recognised threat to over 200 nationally threatened species, and 37 listed migratory species. They have contributed to the extinction of more than 20 Australian mammal species, including the pig-footed bandicoots, lesser bilby and broad-faced potoroo.

=== Impact on prey species ===
Even well-fed domestic cats may hunt and kill, mainly catching small mammals such as rodents and lagamorphs, but also birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates. Hunting by domestic cats contributes to the decline in the numbers of birds in urban areas. Feral cats can threaten native species with extinction, particularly on island ecosystems where native animals did not evolve alongside predators, especially ambush predators like cats. Controlling or eliminating the populations of the non-native cats can produce a rapid recovery in native animals.

Native species such as the New Zealand kākāpō and the Australian bettong tend to be more ecologically vulnerable when faced with predation by cats due to lack of an evolutionary response to predation. Feral cats have had a major impact on these native species and have played a leading role in the endangerment and extinction of many species.
In Hawaii&#x27;s remote, mountainous areas, they destroy the nests of seabirds including Newell&#x27;s shearwater (&quot;Puffinus newelli&quot;) and the Hawaiian petrel (&quot;Pterodroma sandwichensis&quot;), amongst many other ground-nesting birds.

In agricultural settings, cats can be effective at keeping mouse and rat populations low, but only if rodent harborage locations (such as tall grass) are kept under control. While cats are effective at preventing rodent population explosions, they are not effective for eliminating pre-existing severe infestations. Rat terriers and native predators such as raptors and snakes are far better at eliminating mice and rats compared to the domestic cat. In systems where wildlife is threatened by both predation by rats and cats, there are concerns that controlling cats could increase predation by rats, due to rat populations increasing. For example, in Christmas Island, it was shown that decreasing cat populations would improve the growth rate of a threatened bird, as long as rats did not increase by more than 77 rats per cat removed. However, cats are actually ineffective predators of rats and prefer going after smaller prey, such as mice and small native animals.

==Hybridisation with wildcats==

Feral cats have interbred with wildcats to various extents throughout the world, the first reported case occurring more than 200 years ago. The significance of hybridisation is disputed. Modern genetic analysis revealed that the African wildcat is the ancestor of the domestic cat, and it is a subspecies of the African wildcat.

Pure Scottish wildcats are unlikely to exist, but the current wildcat population is distinct enough from domestic cats to be worth protecting.
High levels of hybridisation have led to difficulties in distinguishing pure wildcats from feral and domestic cats, which can complicate conservation efforts. Trap-neuter-return programs have been established to prevent hybridisation.

Notable gene introgression into European wildcat populations exists also in Italy, Hungary, Spain and Portugal.

<text>Tom Wham (born 1944) is a designer of board games who has also produced artwork, including that for his own games.

==Career==
===Early life and Guidon Games===
Born in Chester, Illinois, Wham worked a variety of odd jobs during his early adult life. After serving four years in the U.S. Navy, he worked for the Guidon Games hobby shop in Maine where he got his first game, a variant on a Civil War naval miniatures campaign, published. One of Wham&#x27;s books was published in the same series of &quot;Wargaming with Miniatures&quot; books from Guidon Games that began in 1971 with &quot;Chainmail&quot;. In 1972, Wham got a job with Don Lowry at Guidon Games, in the shipping/layout department of &quot;Campaign&quot; magazine; there, he co-authored a set of Civil War naval miniature rules, &quot;Ironclad&quot;. Afterwards he became a prison guard in his hometown, then held an office job in Denver.

===TSR===
In May 1977 he began working for TSR, Inc. at their Lake Geneva, Wisconsin headquarters as a general office worker, the company&#x27;s 13th employee. After running the Dungeon Hobby Shop for a summer, he was moved upstairs to the company&#x27;s art department. Wham worked with Dave Sutherland and his brother-in-law Dave Trampier on the original &quot;Monster Manual&quot;. Wham began doing some creative work for the company, contributing a handful of illustrations for the original AD&amp;D &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, including the creature called the beholder. Other work included co-editing (with Timothy Jones, Mike Carr, and Brian Blume) the first edition of &quot;Gamma World&quot;. He also made a deal with Tim Kask, editor of &quot;The Dragon&quot;, to do a game in the centerfold, called &quot;Snit Smashing&quot;; this led to other games in &quot;Dragon&quot;, including &quot;The Awful Green Things from Outer Space&quot;. These games, printed on cardstock and included in the centerfold of the magazine, usually featured artwork supplied by Wham.

Notable games published this way include:

* &quot;Snit Smashing&quot;: Originally published in &quot;Dragon&quot; #10 (October 1977). In Wham&#x27;s first game for &quot;Dragon&quot;, tiny creatures known as Snits run out from the sea and try to procreate while avoiding the giant blob-like Bolotomi, who smash the Snits out of boredom. Players alternate control between the Snits and the Bolotomus, attempting to make their own Snits reproduce faster than those of their opponent.
* &quot;Snit&#x27;s Revenge&quot;: Originally published in &quot;Dragon&quot; #11 (December 1977). In the more famous follow-up to &quot;Snit Smashing&quot;, the Snits set out to finally kill the elephantine Bolotomi who are smashing them, by invading their bodies and shutting down all their internal organs. This was published as a separate boardgame by TSR in 1978, and is now published by Steve Jackson Games.
* &quot;The Awful Green Things from Outer Space&quot;: Originally published in &quot;Dragon&quot; #28 (August 1979). A game of green aliens invading a spaceship. This too was eventually published as a separate game by TSR and later published by Steve Jackson Games as well.
* &quot;Search for the Emperor&#x27;s Treasure&quot;: Originally published in &quot;Dragon&quot; #51 (July 1981). Players take the roles of adventurers searching a fantasy empire for the emperor&#x27;s scattered magical treasures. A revised edition was included in a box set called &quot;The Best of Dragon Games&quot;, 1990.
* &quot;File 13&quot;: Originally published in &quot;Dragon&quot; #72 (April 1983). A game about designing board games. A second edition was reissued in &quot;The Best of Dragon Games&quot;.
* &quot;King of the Tabletop&quot;: Originally published in &quot;Dragon&quot; #77 (September 1983), this is a game in which people create their own kingdom from little cardboard chits representing land, characters, and events. Also expanded and published commercially as &quot;Kings and Things&quot; by West End Games, Games Workshop, and later, in a German edition, Pegasus Spiele.
* &quot;Elefant Hunt&quot;: Originally published in &quot;Dragon&quot; #88 (August 1984). Great White Hunters travel through deepest, darkest &quot;Aferca&quot; with the help of natives to capture as many live animals and much ivory as they can to sell for profit.

===After TSR===
After TSR, Wham collaborated on books with Rose Estes, and did his own novelette in Christopher Stasheff&#x27;s &quot;The Exotic Enchanter&quot;. More games followed, including &quot;Kings &amp; Things&quot; (with Rob Kuntz), the &quot;SimCity&quot; card game, and &quot;Iron Dragon&quot;. Later efforts include a reprint of &quot;Snits&quot; and &quot;Awful Green Things from Outer Space&quot; from Steve Jackson Games, and &quot;Planet Busters&quot; by Troll Lord Games.

Wham designed the board game &quot;King of the Tabletop&quot; with Robert J. Kuntz, which was published in &quot;Dragon&quot; #77 (September 1983); the game was expanded and published separately as the Origins award-winner &quot;Kings &amp; Things&quot; (1986) by West End Games.

Since leaving TSR, Wham has designed many more games, including collaborating with James M. Ward on the board game &quot;Dragon Lairds&quot;, published in April 2008, and &quot;Feudality&quot; published by Z-man Games Inc. in 2011.

<text>Michelle Ingrid Williams (born September 9, 1980) is an American actress. Known primarily for starring in small-scale independent films with dark or tragic themes, she has received various accolades, including two Golden Globe Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award, in addition to nominations for five Academy Awards and a Tony Award.

Williams, daughter of politician and trader Larry R. Williams, began her career with television guest appearances and made her film debut in the family film &quot;Lassie&quot; in 1994. She gained emancipation from her parents at age fifteen, and soon achieved recognition for her leading role as Jen Lindley in the teen drama television series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1998–2003). This was followed by low-profile films, before having her breakthrough with the drama film &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005), which earned Williams her first Academy Award nomination.

Williams received critical acclaim for playing emotionally troubled women coping with loss or loneliness in the independent dramas &quot;Wendy and Lucy&quot; (2008), &quot;Blue Valentine&quot; (2010), and &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot; (2016). She won two Golden Globes for portraying Marilyn Monroe in the drama &quot;My Week with Marilyn&quot; (2011) and Gwen Verdon in the miniseries &quot;Fosse/Verdon&quot; (2019), in addition to a Primetime Emmy Award for the latter. Her highest-grossing releases came with the thriller &quot;Shutter Island&quot; (2010), the fantasy film &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot; (2013), the musical &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot; (2017), and the superhero films &quot;Venom&quot; (2018) and &quot;&quot; (2021). Williams has also led major studio films, such as Ridley Scott&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;All the Money in the World&quot; (2017) and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s semi-autobiographical drama &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; (2022).

On Broadway, Williams starred in revivals of the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; in 2014 and the drama &quot;Blackbird&quot; in 2016, for which she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. She is an advocate for equal pay in the workplace. Consistently private about her personal life, Williams has a daughter from her relationship with actor Heath Ledger and was briefly married to musician Phil Elverum. She has two children with her second husband, theater director Thomas Kail.

==Life and career==
===1980–1995: Early life===

Michelle Ingrid Williams was born on September 9, 1980, in Kalispell, Montana, to Carla, a homemaker, and Larry R. Williams, an author and commodities trader. She has Norwegian ancestry and her family has lived in Montana for generations. Her father twice ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate as a Republican Party nominee. In Kalispell, Williams lived with her three paternal half-siblings and her younger sister, Paige. Although she has described her family as &quot;not terribly closely knit&quot;, she shared a close bond with her father, who taught her to fish and shoot, and encouraged her to become a keen reader. Williams has recounted fond memories of growing up in the vast landscape of Montana. When she was nine, the family moved to San Diego, California. She has said of the experience, &quot;It was less happy probably by virtue of it being my preteen years, which are perhaps unpleasant wherever you go.&quot; She mostly kept to herself and was self-reliant. She said that growing up, she had a connection with Judaism due to being raised around San Diego Jewish families.

Williams became interested in acting at an early age when she saw a local production of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;. She performed in an amateur production of the musical &quot;Annie&quot;, and her parents would drive her from San Diego to Los Angeles to audition for parts. Her first screen appearance was as Bridget Bowers, a young woman who seduces Mitch Buchannon&#x27;s son, Hobie, in a 1993 episode of the television series &quot;Baywatch&quot;. The following year, she made her film debut in the family feature &quot;Lassie&quot;, about the bond between the titular dog and a young boy (played by Tom Guiry). Williams played the love interest of Guiry&#x27;s character, which led the critic Steven Gaydos to take notice of her &quot;winning perf&quot;. She next took on guest roles in the television sitcoms &quot;Step by Step&quot; and &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, and appeared as the child form of Sil, an alien played in adulthood by Natasha Henstridge, in the 1995 science fiction film &quot;Species&quot;.

By 1995, Williams had completed ninth grade at Santa Fe Christian Schools in San Diego. She disliked going there as she did not get along well with other students. To focus on her acting pursuits, she left the school and enrolled for in-home tutoring. At age fifteen, with her parents&#x27; approval, Williams filed for emancipation from them, so she could better pursue her acting career with less interference from child labor work laws. To comply with the emancipation guidelines, she completed her high school education in nine months through correspondence. She later regretted not getting a proper education.

===1996–2000: &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; and transition to adult roles===
Following her emancipation, Williams moved to Los Angeles and lived by herself in Burbank. She said of her initial experience in the city, &quot;There are some really disgusting people in the world, and I met some of them.&quot; To support herself, she took assignments in low-budget films and commercials. She had minor roles in the television films &quot;My Son is Innocent&quot; (1996) and &quot;Killing Mr. Griffin&quot; (1997), and the drama &quot;A Thousand Acres&quot; (1997), which starred Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange. Williams later described her early work as &quot;embarrassing&quot;, saying she had taken those roles merely to support herself as she &quot;didn&#x27;t have any taste [or] ideals&quot;. In 1997, unhappy with the roles she was being offered, Williams collaborated with two other actors to write a script titled &quot;Blink&quot;, about prostitutes living in a Nevada brothel, which despite being sold to a production company was never made. Having learned to trade under her father&#x27;s guidance, a seventeen-year-old Williams entered the Robbins World Cup Championship, a futures trading contest; with a return of 1,000%, she became the first female to win the title and the third-highest winner of all time (her father ranks first).
In 1998, Williams began starring in the teen drama television series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, created by Kevin Williamson and co-starring James Van Der Beek, Katie Holmes, and Joshua Jackson. The series aired for six seasons from January 1998 to May 2003 and featured her as Jen Lindley, a precocious New York-based teenager who relocates to the fictional town of Capeside. The series was shot in Wilmington, North Carolina, where she lived for the six years of filming. Reviewing the first season for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Caryn James called it a soap opera that was &quot;redeemed by intelligence and sharp writing&quot; but found Williams to be &quot;too earnest to suit this otherwise shrewdly tongue-in-cheek cast&quot;. Ray Richmond of &quot;Variety&quot; labeled it &quot;an addictive drama with considerable heart&quot; and considered all four leads appealing. The series was a ratings success and raised Williams&#x27;s profile. Her first film release since the debut of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; was the Jamie Lee Curtis-starring slasher picture &quot;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&quot; (1998)—the seventh installment in the &quot;Halloween&quot; film series—in which she played one of several teenagers traumatized by the murderer Michael Myers. It grossed $55 million domestically against its $17 million budget.

Williams credited &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; as &quot;the best acting class&quot;, but also admitted to not having fully invested herself in the show as &quot;my taste was in contradiction to what I was doing every single day.&quot; She would film the series for nine months each year and spend the remaining time playing against type in independent features, which she considered a better fit for her personality. She said the financial stability of a steady job empowered her to act in such films. Williams found her first such role in the comedy &quot;Dick&quot; (1999), a parody of the Watergate scandal, in which she and Kirsten Dunst played teenagers obsessed with Richard Nixon. Praising the film&#x27;s political satire, Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; credited both actresses for playing their roles with &quot;screwball verve&quot;. &quot;Dick&quot; failed to recoup its $13 million investment. In the same year Williams played a small part in &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot;, a satirical comedy about conversion therapy.

Keen to play challenging roles in adult-oriented projects, Williams spent the summer of 1999 starring in an off-Broadway play titled &quot;Killer Joe&quot;. Written by Tracy Letts, it is a black comedy about a dysfunctional family who kills their matriarch for insurance money; she was cast as the family&#x27;s youngest daughter. The production featured gruesome violence and required Williams to perform a nude scene. Her socially conservative parents were displeased with it, but she said she found it &quot;cathartic and freeing&quot;. Her next role was in the HBO television film &quot;If These Walls Could Talk 2&quot; (2000), a drama about three lesbian couples in different time periods. Williams signed on to the project after ensuring that a sex scene with co-star Chloë Sevigny was pertinent to the story and not meant to titillate. In a mixed review of the film, Ken Tucker criticized Williams for overplaying her character&#x27;s eagerness. When asked about playing a series of sexual roles, she stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t think of any of them as sexy, hot girls. They were just defined at an early age by the fact that others saw them that way.&quot; She subsequently made an effort to play roles that were not sexualized.

===2001–2005: Independent films and &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;===
The British film &quot;Me Without You&quot; (2001), about an obsessive female friendship, starred Williams and Anna Friel. Williams played Holly, an insecure bibliophile, a part that came close to her personality. The writer-director Sandra Goldbacher was initially reluctant to cast an American in a British part but was impressed by Williams&#x27;s self-deprecating humor and a &quot;European stillness&quot;. Roger Ebert praised Williams&#x27;s British accent and found her to be &quot;cuddly and smart both at once&quot;. Williams returned to the stage the following year in a production of Mike Leigh&#x27;s farce &quot;Smelling a Rat&quot;. Her part, that of a scatterbrained teenager exploring her sexuality, led Karl Levett of &quot;Backstage&quot; to label her &quot;a first-class creative comedienne&quot;. She played a supporting role in the Christina Ricci-starring &quot;Prozac Nation&quot;, a drama about depression based on Elizabeth Wurtzel&#x27;s memoir.

&quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; completed its run in 2003, and Williams was satisfied with how it had run its course. She relocated to New York City soon after. She had supporting parts in two art-house films that year, the drama &quot;The United States of Leland&quot; and the comedy-drama &quot;The Station Agent&quot;. In the former, starring Ryan Gosling, she played the grieving sister of a murdered boy; it was described by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;″s Liam Lacey as &quot;neither an insightful nor well-made film&quot;. &quot;The Station Agent&quot;, about a lonely dwarf (played by Peter Dinklage), featured Williams as a librarian who develops an attraction towards him. Critically acclaimed, the film&#x27;s cast was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. On stage, Williams played Varya in a 2004 production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s drama &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, alongside Linda Emond and Jessica Chastain, at the Williamstown Theatre Festival. The theater critic Ben Brantley credited her for &quot;cannily play[ing] her natural vibrancy against the anxiety that has worn the young Varya into a permanent high-strung sullenness.&quot;
German filmmaker Wim Wenders wrote the film &quot;Land of Plenty&quot; (2004), which investigates anxiety and disillusionment in a post-9/11 America, with Williams in mind. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised Wenders&#x27;s thoughtful examination of the subject and noted Williams&#x27;s screen appeal. She received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead nomination for the film. The actor next appeared in &quot;Imaginary Heroes&quot;, a drama about a family coping with their son&#x27;s suicide, and played an impressionable young woman fixated on mental health in the period film &quot;A Hole in One&quot;. Williams returned to the comedy genre with &quot;The Baxter&quot;, in which she played a geeky secretary. The film received negative reviews; Wesley Morris of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote, &quot;Only when Williams is around does the movie seem human, true, and funny. Even in her slapstick, there&#x27;s pain.&quot; As with her other films during this period, it received only a limited release and was not widely seen.

Her film breakthrough came later in 2005 when Williams appeared in Ang Lee&#x27;s drama &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, about the romance between two men, Ennis and Jack (played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, respectively). Impressed with her performance in &quot;The Station Agent&quot;, the casting director Avy Kaufman recommended Williams to Lee. He found a vulnerability in her and cast her as Alma, the wife of Ennis, who discovers her husband&#x27;s homosexual infidelity. The actor was emotionally affected by the story and, despite her limited screen time, she was drawn to the idea of playing a woman constricted by the social mores of the time. Deeming her the standout among the cast, Ed Gonzalez of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; commended Williams for &quot;fascinatingly spiking [Alma&#x27;s] unspoken resentment for her sham of a marriage with a hint of compassion for Ennis&#x27;s secret suffering&quot;. &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; proved to be her most widely seen film to that point, grossing $178 million against its $14 million budget, and she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Williams began dating Ledger while working on the film. The couple cohabited in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, New York, and in 2005, she gave birth to their daughter Matilda.

===2006–2010: Work with auteurs===
Williams had two film releases in 2006. She first featured opposite Paul Giamatti in the drama &quot;The Hawk Is Dying&quot;. Five months after giving birth to her daughter, she returned to work on Ethan Hawke&#x27;s directorial venture &quot;The Hottest State&quot;, based on his own novel. Leslie Felperin of &quot;Variety&quot; found her role too brief. Following the awards-season success of &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, Williams was unsure of what to do next. After six months of indecision, she agreed to a small part in Todd Haynes&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; (2007), a musical inspired by the life of Bob Dylan. She was then drawn to the part of an enigmatic seductress named S in the 2008 crime thriller &quot;Deception&quot;. The film, which co-starred Hugh Jackman and Ewan McGregor, was considered by critics to be middling and predictable. In her next release, &quot;Incendiary&quot;, based on Chris Cleave&#x27;s novel of the same name, Williams reteamed with McGregor to play a woman whose family is killed in a terrorist attack. A reviewer for &quot;The Independent&quot; called the film &quot;sloppy&quot; and added that Williams deserved better.
Williams&#x27;s two other releases of 2008 were better received. The screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was impressed with her comic timing in &quot;Dick&quot; and thus cast her in his directorial debut &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot;, an ensemble experimental drama headlined by Philip Seymour Hoffman. It was a box office bomb and polarized critics, although Roger Ebert named it the best film of the decade. Two days after finishing work on &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot;, Williams began filming Kelly Reichardt&#x27;s &quot;Wendy and Lucy&quot;, playing the part of a poor and lonesome young woman traveling with her dog and looking for employment. With a shoestring budget of $300,000, the film was shot on location in Portland, Oregon, with a largely volunteer crew. Williams had just separated from Ledger and was relieved for the anonymity the project provided. She was pleased with Reichardt&#x27;s minimalistic approach and identified with her character&#x27;s self-sufficiency and fortitude. Sam Adams of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; considered her performance to be &quot;remarkable not only for its depth but for its stillness&quot; and Mick LaSalle commended her for effectively conveying a &quot;lived-in sense of always having been close to the economic brink&quot;.

Williams was filming in Sweden for her next project, &quot;Mammoth&quot; (2009), when news broke that Ledger had died of an accidental intoxication from prescription drugs. Although Williams continued filming, she later said, &quot;It was horrible. I don&#x27;t remember most of it.&quot; In her first public statement, a week after his death, she expressed her heartbreak and described Ledger&#x27;s spirit as surviving in their daughter. She attended his memorial and funeral services later that month.

&quot;Mammoth&quot; was directed by the Swedish director Lukas Moodysson and featured Williams and Gael García Bernal as a couple dealing with issues stemming from globalization. Her role was that of an established surgeon, a part she deemed herself too young to logically play. In the same year, she co-starred with Natalie Portman in a Roman Polanski-directed faux perfume commercial called &quot;Greed&quot;. For her next project, Martin Scorsese cast her opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in the psychological thriller &quot;Shutter Island&quot;. Based on Dennis Lehane&#x27;s novel, it featured her as a depressed housewife who drowns her own children. The high-profile production marked a departure for her, and she found it difficult to adjust to the slower pace of filming. In preparation, she read case studies on infanticide. After finishing work on the film in 2008, Williams admitted that playing a series of troubled women coupled with her own personal difficulties had taken an emotional toll. She took a year off work to focus on her daughter. &quot;Shutter Island&quot; was released in 2010 and was a commercial success, earning over $294 million worldwide.

Williams had first read the script for Derek Cianfrance&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Blue Valentine&quot; at age 21. When funding came through after years of delay, she was reluctant to accept the offer as filming in California would take her away from her daughter for too long. Keen to have her in the film, Cianfrance decided to shoot it near Brooklyn, where Williams lived. Co-starring Ryan Gosling, &quot;Blue Valentine&quot; traces the tribulations faced by a disillusioned married couple. Before production began, Cianfrance had Williams and Gosling live together for a month on a stipend that matched their characters&#x27; income. This exercise led to conflicts between them, which proved conducive for filming their characters&#x27; deteriorating marriage. On set, she and Gosling practiced method acting by improvising several scenes. The film premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival to critical acclaim. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s reviewer A. O. Scott found Williams to be &quot;heartbreakingly precise in every scene&quot; and commended the duo for being &quot;exemplars of New Method sincerity, able to be fully and achingly present every moment on screen together&quot;. She received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actress.

In her final film project of 2010, she reunited with Kelly Reichardt for the western &quot;Meek&#x27;s Cutoff&quot;. Set in 1845, it is based on an ill-fated historical incident on the Oregon Trail, in which the frontier guide Stephen Meek led a wagon train through a desert. Williams starred as one of the passengers on the wagon, a feisty young mother who is suspicious of Meek. In preparation, she took lessons on firing a gun and learned to knit. Filming in extreme temperatures in the desert proved arduous for her, though she enjoyed the challenge. Writing for &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;, Bill Goodykoontz praised the subtlety both in the film and in Williams&#x27;s performance.

===2011–2016: &quot;My Week with Marilyn&quot; and Broadway===

In 2011, Williams portrayed Marilyn Monroe in &quot;My Week with Marilyn&quot;, a drama depicting the troubled production of the 1957 comedy &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl&quot;, based on accounts by Colin Clark, who worked on the latter film. Initially skeptical about playing Monroe, as she had little in common with her looks or personality, Williams spent six months researching her by reading biographies, diaries and notes, and studying her posture, gait, and mannerisms. She also gained weight for the part, bleached her hair blonde, and on days of filming, underwent over three hours of makeup. She sang three songs for the film&#x27;s soundtrack and recreated a performance of Monroe singing and dancing to &quot;Heat Wave&quot;. Roger Ebert considered Williams&#x27;s performance to be the film&#x27;s prime asset and credited her for successfully evoking multiple aspects of Monroe&#x27;s personality. Peter Travers opined that despite not physically resembling Monroe, she had &quot;with fierce artistry and feeling [illuminated] Monroe&#x27;s insights and insecurities about herself at the height of her fame&quot;. For her portrayal, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and received a second consecutive Oscar nomination.

In Sarah Polley&#x27;s romance &quot;Take This Waltz&quot; (2011), co-starring Seth Rogen and Luke Kirby, Williams played a married writer attracted to her neighbor. Though the actor considered it to be a light-hearted film, Jenny McCartney of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; found a darker undertone to it and favorably compared its theme to that of &quot;Blue Valentine&quot;. To play a part that would appeal to her daughter, Williams starred as Glinda in Sam Raimi&#x27;s fantasy picture &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot; (2013). Based on the &quot;Oz&quot; children&#x27;s books, it served as a prequel to the 1939 classic film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. It marked her first appearance in a film involving special effects and she credited Raimi for making her comfortable with the process. The film earned over $490 million worldwide to rank as one of her highest-grossing releases. &quot;Suite Française&quot;, a period drama that Williams filmed in 2013, was released in a few territories in 2015 but was not theatrically distributed in America. She later admitted to being displeased with how the film turned out, adding that she found it hard to predict the quality of a project during production. Eager to work in a different medium and finding it tough to obtain film roles that enabled her to maintain her parental commitments, Williams spent the next few years working on the stage.

Her desire to star in a musical led Williams to the role of Sally Bowles in a 2014 revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot;, which was staged at Studio 54 and marked her Broadway debut. Jointly directed by Sam Mendes and Rob Marshall, it tells the story of a free-spirited cabaret performer (Williams) in 1930s Berlin during the rise of the Nazi Party. Before production began, she spent four months privately rehearsing with music and dance coaches. She read the works of Christopher Isherwood, whose novel &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot; inspired the musical, and visited Berlin to research Isherwood&#x27;s life and inspirations. Her performance received mixed reviews; Jesse Green of &quot;Vulture&quot; praised her singing and commitment to the role, but &quot;Newsday&quot;″s Linda Winer thought her portrayal lacked depth. The rigorousness of the assignment led Williams to consider &quot;Cabaret&quot; her toughest project.
Challenged by her work on &quot;Cabaret&quot;, Williams was eager to continue working on the stage. She found a part in a 2016 revival of the David Harrower play &quot;Blackbird&quot;. Set entirely in the lunchroom of an office, it focuses on a young woman (Williams), who confronts a much older man (played by Jeff Daniels) for having sexual relations with her when she was twelve years old. Williams, who had not seen previous stagings of the play, was drawn to the ambiguity of her role and found herself unable to detach from it after each performance. Hilton Als of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; considered her &quot;daring and nonjudgmental embodiment of her not easily assimilable character&quot; to be the production&#x27;s highlight. She received a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play nomination for &quot;Blackbird&quot;.

Williams returned to film in 2016 with supporting roles in two small-scale dramas, &quot;Certain Women&quot; and &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot;. The former marked her third collaboration with Kelly Reichardt and told three interconnected narratives based on the short stories of Maile Meloy. As with their previous collaborations, the film featured minimal dialogue and required Williams to act through silences. Kenneth Lonergan&#x27;s &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot; starred Casey Affleck as Lee, a depressed man who separates from his wife, Randi (Williams), following the tragic death of their children. Williams agreed to the project to work with Lonergan, whom she admired, and despite the film&#x27;s bleakness she found a connection with her character&#x27;s desire to reclaim her life in the face of tragedy. In preparation, she visited Manchester to interview local mothers about their lives and worked with a dialect coach to speak in a Massachusetts accent. Several critics hailed Williams&#x27;s climactic monologue, in which Randi confronts Lee, as the film&#x27;s highlight; Justin Chang termed it an &quot;astonishing scene that rises from the movie like a small aria of heartbreak.&quot; She received her fourth Oscar nomination, her second in the Best Supporting Actress category.
===2017–present: Mainstream films, &quot;Fosse/Verdon&quot;, and marriages ===

Following a brief appearance in Todd Haynes&#x27;s drama &quot;Wonderstruck&quot; (2017), Williams appeared in the musical &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot;. Inspired by P. T. Barnum&#x27;s creation of the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, the film featured her as Charity, the wife of Barnum (played by Hugh Jackman). She likened her character&#x27;s joyful disposition to that of Grace Kelly, and she sang two songs for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. The film emerged as one of her most successful, earning over $434 million worldwide.

Ridley Scott&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;All the Money in the World&quot; (2017) was Williams&#x27;s first leading role in film since 2013. She starred as Gail Harris, whose son, John Paul Getty III, is kidnapped for ransom. She considered it a major opportunity, since she had not headlined a big-budget Hollywood production before. A month prior to the film&#x27;s release, Kevin Spacey, who originally played J. Paul Getty, was accused of sexual misconduct; he was replaced with Christopher Plummer, and Williams reshot her scenes days before the release deadline. The critic David Edelstein bemoaned that Williams&#x27;s work had been overshadowed by the controversy and went on to commend her &quot;marvelous performance&quot;, noting how she conveyed her character&#x27;s grief through &quot;the tension in her body and intensity of her voice&quot;. She received her fifth Golden Globe nomination for the role. It was later reported that her co-star Mark Wahlberg had been paid $1.5 million to Williams&#x27;s $1,000 for the reshoots, which sparked a discourse on gender pay gap amongst Hollywood.

In 2018, Williams married the musician Phil Elverum in a secret ceremony in the Adirondack Mountains. Her first film role of the year was as a haughty but insecure executive in the Amy Schumer-starring comedy &quot;I Feel Pretty&quot;, which satirizes body image issues among women. The comedic role, which required her to speak in a high-pitched voice, led Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; to term it &quot;the funniest performance of her career&quot;. The film was a modest box office success. In a continued effort to work on different genres, Williams played Anne Weying in the superhero film &quot;Venom&quot;, co-starring Tom Hardy as the titular antihero. Influenced by the MeToo movement, she provided off-screen inputs regarding her character&#x27;s wardrobe and dialogue, but the critic Peter Bradshaw found it to be &quot;an outrageously boring and submissive role&quot;. &quot;Venom&quot; earned over $855 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in which Williams has appeared.

Williams returned to the Sundance Film Festival in 2019 with &quot;After the Wedding&quot;, a remake of Susanne Bier&#x27;s Danish film of the same name, in which she and Julianne Moore played roles portrayed by men in the original. Benjamin Lee of &quot;The Guardian&quot; considered the low-key part to be a better fit than her previous few roles. &quot;Fosse/Verdon&quot;, an FX miniseries about the troubled personal and professional relationship between Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon, marked her first leading role on television since &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. Williams felt her Broadway run in &quot;Cabaret&quot; helped prepare her to portray Verdon. She also served as an executive producer on the series, and was pleased not to have to negotiate to receive equal pay to her co-star Sam Rockwell. John Doyle of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; lauded Williams for &quot;play[ing] Verdon with a wonderfully controlled sense of the woman&#x27;s total commitment to her art and craft while always standing on the edge of an emotional abyss.&quot; She won the Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Miniseries.

Elverum and Williams filed for divorce in April 2019; by November 2019, it was reported that they were no longer married. She later described the marriage as a &quot;mistake&quot;. Later in 2019, Williams became engaged to the theater director Thomas Kail, with whom she worked on &quot;Fosse/Verdon&quot;; they married in March 2020. She gave birth to their son later in 2020 and another child in 2022.

In 2021, Williams reprised the role of Anne Weying in the superhero sequel &quot;&quot;. It received mixed reviews, but grossed over $500 million worldwide. In her fourth collaboration with Kelly Reichardt, Williams starred in the drama &quot;Showing Up&quot; (2022). For her role as a sculptor in it, she shadowed the artist Cynthia Lahti. Tim Robey of &quot;The Independent&quot; opined that Williams &quot;thrives more intelligently than ever under Reichardt&#x27;s watch here&quot;. Later in 2022, Williams starred in &quot;The Fabelmans&quot;, Steven Spielberg&#x27;s semi-autobiographical film about his childhood, in which she played Mitzi Fabelman, a character inspired by his mother. Spielberg had her in mind for the part after seeing her performance in &quot;Blue Valentine&quot;; in preparation, she heard recordings and watched home movies of his childhood. The film received critical acclaim; Pete Hammond of &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; labeled Williams &quot;gut-wrenchingly great&quot; and Kyle Buchanan of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that she &quot;really goes for it, attacking this part like someone who knows she’s been handed her signature role&quot;. She received further Best Actress nominations at the Golden Globe and Academy Award ceremonies.

After filming &quot;The Fabelmans&quot;, Williams took a two-and-a-half year break from acting. In 2023, she was enlisted by singer Britney Spears to narrate the audiobook version of her memoir &quot;The Woman in Me&quot;. A clipping from the audiobook, in which Williams imitates Justin Timberlake speaking in &quot;blaccent&quot; went viral on social media. She will return to acting with &quot;Dying for Sex&quot;, an FX miniseries based on the podcast of the same name, about a married woman with cancer who begins to explore her sexuality.

==Public image and acting style==
Describing Williams&#x27;s off-screen persona, Debbie McQuoid of &quot;Stylist&quot; magazine wrote in 2016 that she is &quot;predictably petite but her poise and posture make her seem larger than life&quot;. The journalist Andrew Anthony has described her as unpretentious, low-key, and unassuming. Charles McGrath of &quot;The New York Times&quot; considers her to be unlike a movie star and has called her &quot;shy, earnest, thoughtful, and [...] a little wary of publicity&quot;. Williams has spoken about how she tries to balance her desire to be private and her wish to use her celebrity to speak out on issues such as sexism, gender pay gap, and sexual harassment. On Equal Pay Day in 2019, she utilized the pay gap controversy surrounding her film &quot;All the Money in the World&quot; to deliver an address at the United States Capitol urging passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act. During her 2020 Golden Globe acceptance speech for &quot;Fosse/Verdon&quot;, she advocated for the importance of women&#x27;s and reproductive rights.
In the aftermath of her ex-partner Heath Ledger&#x27;s death in January 2008, Williams became the subject of intense media scrutiny and was frequently stalked by paparazzi. She disliked the attention, saying it interfered with her work and made her self-conscious. Although reluctant to publicly discuss her romantic relationships, Williams was forthright in expressing her grief over Ledger&#x27;s death, saying it had left a permanent hole in both her and her daughter&#x27;s life. She has since affirmed her determination to look after her daughter in spite of her difficulties as a single parent. In 2018, she opened up about her relationship and marriage to Phil Elverum to provide grieving women with inspiration.

Williams prefers acting in small-scale independent films to high-profile, mainstream productions, finding this to be &quot;a very natural expression of [her] interest&quot;. Elaine Lipworth of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; has identified a theme of &quot;dark, often tragic characters&quot; in her career, and Katie O&#x27;Malley of &quot;Elle&quot; writes that she specializes in &quot;playing strong, independent and forthright female characters&quot;. Susan Dominus of &quot;The New York Times&quot; considers her to be a &quot;tragic embodiment of grief, in life and in art&quot;. Regarding her selection of roles, Williams has said she is drawn toward &quot;people&#x27;s failings, blind spots, inconsistencies&quot;. She believes that her own unconventional adolescence informs these choices. She agrees to a project on instinct, calling it an &quot;un-thought out process&quot;. Describing her acting process in 2008, she stated:

Erica Wagner of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; has praised Williams for combining &quot;startlingly emotional performance with a sense of groundedness&quot; and the critic David Thomson opines that she &quot;can play anyone, without undue glamour or starriness&quot;. Adam Green of &quot;Vogue&quot; considers Williams&#x27;s ability to reveal &quot;the inner lives of her characters in unguarded moments&quot; to be her trademark, and credits her for not &quot;trading on her sex appeal&quot; despite her willingness to perform nude scenes. Her &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot; director Kenneth Lonergan has stated that her versatility allows her to be &quot;transformed, in her whole person&quot; by the role she plays. Dominus also believes that she physically transforms herself &quot;as if all her molecules have fallen apart and been reassembled to create a slightly different version of herself, the material attributes the same but the essence transformed&quot;. Describing her career in 2016, Boris Kachka of &quot;Elle&quot; termed it a metamorphosis from &quot;celebrated indie ingenue to muscular, chameleonic movie star&quot;. In a 2022 readers&#x27; poll by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, Williams was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time. The magazine attributed her success to playing &quot;damaged, broken and hurt characters with such heartbreaking sensitivity, you can never see the seams&quot;.

The saffron Vera Wang gown Williams wore to the 78th Academy Awards in 2006 is regarded as one of the greatest Oscar dresses of all time. Williams has featured as the brand ambassador for the fashion label Band of Outsiders and the luxury brand Louis Vuitton. She has appeared in several advertisement campaigns for the latter company, and in 2015, she starred alongside Alicia Vikander in their short film named &quot;The Spirit of Travel&quot;.

Williams also won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for &quot;Fosse/Verdon&quot; (2019) and received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for &quot;Blackbird&quot;.

<doc id="895693" wikidata="Q1002847" url="?curid=895693" title="Buick Rendezvous">
<text>The Buick Rendezvous is a mid-size crossover SUV that was sold by Buick for the 2002–2007 model years. It debuted at the Chicago Auto Show in February 2000, and sales commenced in spring 2001. The Buick Rendezvous and its corporate cousin, the Pontiac Aztek, were GM&#x27;s first entries into the crossover SUV segment. The Rendezvous featured a four-speed automatic transmission with a V6 engine and optional all-wheel drive (dubbed Versatrak). The SUV used the same platform as GM&#x27;s short-wheelbase minivans, the Chevrolet Venture and Pontiac Montana. The Rendezvous provided a passenger- and load-carrying capacity not seen in the Buick lineup since the discontinuation of the Buick Roadmaster Estate station wagon in 1996.

==Technology and notable features==
It was Buick&#x27;s first truck-based vehicle in its lineup since 1923, and the Rendezvous was billed as a combination of the best attributes of a minivan (large cargo capacity, seating for up to seven), a luxury automobile (ride, handling, smoothness), and a sport utility vehicle (truck styling and available all-wheel drive).

The Rendezvous was produced at General Motors&#x27; Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, assembly plant, where it shared an assembly line with the Pontiac Aztek. However, unlike the Aztek, the Rendezvous rides on the same 112-inch wheelbase as the short-wheelbase variants of GM&#x27;s second-generation U-platform minivans. In lieu of a traditional four-wheel-drive system, the Rendezvous offered Versatrak, a full-time, fully automatic all-wheel-drive system which provided sure-footed traction in inclement weather and could handle moderate off-road surfaces. The Versatrak system uses hydraulic gerotor pumps and multi-plate clutch packs, instead of the typically used viscous couplings, and is supplied by Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG, under license from McLaren Traction Technologies.

Buick benchmarked its Park Avenue sedan as the prototypical target for ride and handling for the Rendezvous. To provide a luxurious and responsive car-like ride, all Rendezvous models came equipped with a fully independent rear suspension system with aluminum-alloy control arms and crossmember, as well as rear solid disc brakes, regardless of drivetrain.

The instrument cluster of the Rendezvous featured teal-illuminated needles and numbers set in a silver face accented by chrome trim rings that was meant to evoke the luxurious look and feel of an expensive watch or designer bracelet. On the uplevel CXL model, a driver information center on the instrument panel provided the outside temperature, compass, and a trip computer that included readings of fuel economy, driving range, and amount of fuel used; this was also available with the base CX model. An optional second-generation head-up display was also available on both CX and CXL models, while an optional tire-pressure monitoring system provided readings of tire pressure and warned if out of the specified range.

The Rendezvous boasted the ability to carry seven passengers when equipped with a third-row bench, a class-leading feature that Buick brought to market before its competitors, and was able to carry a standard sheet of plywood.

In support of the Rendezvous&#x27;s intended role as a versatile accoutrement for busy people with families, it provided a center console with storage space and power points for a laptop computer as well as separate compartments to hold a purse, a cell phone, pager, or other small items that the owner would want to keep organized and readily accessible as well as an optional rear cargo organizer system and rear seat stereo system controls with headsets.

==Safety==
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gives the Rendezvous an overall &quot;Acceptable&quot; rating in its frontal offset crash test for fair structure performance and fair dummy control. However, the IIHS did not perform a side-impact test on the Rendezvous.

==Sales success==
The Rendezvous was a badly needed success for Buick, given the decline of its aging customer base, and singlehandedly brought a large number of younger, wealthier &quot;conquest&quot; buyers into Buick showrooms who otherwise would not have considered purchasing a Buick. A major contributor to the Rendezvous&#x27;s success was an aggressive value-pricing strategy that made the Rendezvous US$6,500 less than a comparably equipped Acura MDX and US$8,000 less than the Lexus RX. The Rendezvous handily exceeded GM&#x27;s predictions of 30,000 to 40,000 units a year by a large margin, which helped offset the poor sales of its closest relative, the Pontiac Aztek.

<doc id="895702" wikidata="Q2393344" url="?curid=895702" title="Teething">
<text>Teething is the process by which an infant&#x27;s first teeth (the deciduous teeth, often called &quot;baby teeth&quot; or &quot;milk teeth&quot;) appear by emerging through the gums, typically arriving in pairs. The mandibular central incisors are the first primary teeth to erupt, usually between 6 and 10 months of age and usually causes discomfort and pain to the infant. It can take several years for all 20 teeth to complete the tooth eruption. Though the process of teething is sometimes referred to as &quot;cutting teeth&quot;, when teeth emerge through the gums they do not cut through the flesh. Instead, hormones are released within the body that cause some cells in the gums to die and separate, allowing the teeth to come through.

Teething may cause a slightly elevated temperature, but not rising into the fever range of greater than . Higher temperatures during teething are due to some form of infection, such as a herpes virus, initial infection of which is extremely widespread among children of teething age.

==Signs and symptoms==
The level of pain that a baby can handle will be different for each child. Some may appear to suffer more than others while they are teething. The soreness and swelling of the gums before a tooth comes through is the cause of the pain and fussiness a baby experiences during this change. These symptoms usually begin about three to five days before the tooth shows, and they disappear as soon as the tooth breaks the skin. Some babies are not even bothered by teething.

Common symptoms include drooling or dribbling, increased chewing, mood changes, irritability or crankiness, and swollen gums. Crying, sleeplessness, restless sleep at night, and mild fever are also associated with teething. Teething can begin as early as 3 months and continue until a child&#x27;s third birthday. In rare cases, an area can be filled with fluid appearing over where a tooth is erupting and causing the gums to be even more sensitive. Pain is more often associated with the eruption of molars since they are larger, and do not penetrate through the gums as easily as the other teeth.

Some noticeable symptoms that a baby has entered the teething stage include chewing on their fingers or toys to help relieve pressure on their gums. Babies might also refuse to eat or drink due to the pain. Symptoms will generally fade on their own, but a doctor should be notified if they worsen or are persistent. Teething may cause signs and symptoms in the mouth and gums, but does not cause problems elsewhere in the body.

Pulling on the ears is another sign of pain: the pain in the mouth throbs throughout the baby&#x27;s head, so they pull their ears believing that it will provide relief. Mild rash can develop around the mouth due to the skin irritation caused by excessive drooling or dribbling.

===Sequence of appearance===

The infant teeth tend to emerge in pairs – first one lower incisor emerges, then the other lower incisor, after which the next set begin to emerge. The general pattern of emergence is:
# Lower central incisors (2) at approximately 6 months
# Upper central incisors (2) at approximately 8 months
# Upper lateral incisors (2) at approximately 10 months
# Lower lateral incisors (2) at approximately 10 months
# First molars (4) at approximately 14 months
# Canines (4) at approximately 18 months
# Second molars (4) at approximately 2–3 years

Milk teeth tend to emerge sooner in females than in males. The exact pattern and initial starting times of teething appear to be hereditary. When and how teeth appear in an infant has no bearing on the health of the child.

===Misdiagnosis as teething===
Teething has not been shown to cause fever or diarrhea; however, the belief that teething causes fever is extremely common among parents. Whilst there is some evidence that teething can cause an elevated temperature, it does not cause fever (medically defined as rectal temperature greater than ). One small 1992 study found a significant rise in temperature on the day of eruption of the first tooth. Another study in 2000 found &quot;mild temperature elevation&quot; but not fever over .

There is a risk that fever around the age of teething is dismissed as due to teething when it is actually due to illness, particularly infection by herpes viruses. &quot;Coincidentally, primary tooth eruption begins at about the time that infants are losing maternal antibody protection against the herpes virus. Also, reports on teething difficulties have recorded symptoms which are remarkably consistent with primary oral herpetic infection, such as fever, irritability, sleeplessness, and difficulty with eating.&quot; &quot;Younger infants with higher residual levels of antibodies would experience milder infections, and these would be more likely to go unrecognized or be dismissed as teething difficulty.&quot; Herpes virus infection may take the form of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (HSV-1) or of infection by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), which infects 90% of children by age 2. &quot;The symptoms of elevated temperature and facial rash could be explainable by infection with the HHV-6 agent, which is ubiquitous among infants of teething age.&quot; Other viruses may also cause fevers which might be misattributed to teething, but the oral involvement that may occur with herpes viruses makes misdiagnosis a particular risk for such infections.

==Treatment==

Infants may chew on objects to aid in the teething process. Teething necklaces or bracelets are not recommended as they can cause choking, strangulation, or irritation of the mouth. Teething rings and other toys, called teethers, are often designed with textures. Some infants gain relief from chewing on cold objects. Some people freeze small chunks of fresh fruits or vegetables and put them in teething nets.

===Medication===
In cases where the infant is in obvious pain, some doctors recommend the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or child-safe pain-relief treatments containing benzocaine, lidocaine, or choline salicylate. Benzocaine must be used cautiously because it can cause methemoglobinemia; choline salicylate is related to aspirin and &quot;may cause Reye&#x27;s syndrome in susceptible children, especially those with or recovering from viral infections, or when used in combination with other NSAIDs&quot;. 5% lidocaine gel produces anaesthesia (numbing) within 2–5 minutes, lasting for 10–20 minutes. However, one author concludes that, &quot;Overall, the risks and adverse effects from inappropriate or prolonged use of pharmacological agents outweigh their potential benefits.&quot; She points out that &quot;the psychological trauma involved in administering medications or applying topical preparations to infants must be considered&quot;, and argues that &quot;the placebo effect must not be overlooked. For example, applying a gel of 20% benzocaine in polyethylene glycol may give only a modest benefit over applying the placebo, which gives an efficacy of 60% compared with 90% for the active preparation.&quot;

Medicines are often applied to the babies&#x27; gums to relieve swelling and pain. These gels are similar to the toothache gel that is used by adults for sore gums and toothaches, but is administered in much smaller doses. Teething gels work as a numbing agent to dull the nerves in the gums so that the pain is less noticeable. It is important to follow the directions on the package to ensure that the correct amount of medication is administered and that proper techniques are used to reduce the risk for infection. It is important not to let the medicine numb the throat as it may interfere with the normal gag reflex and may make it possible for food to enter the lungs. Similar medicines are also available in powder form, as &quot;teething powder&quot;.

Some traditional medicines used to treat teething pain have been found to be harmful due to high lead content, with effects including toxic encephalopathy. Surma or kohl has traditionally been used in the Middle East and Indian subcontinent as a teething powder, as have the Middle Eastern saoott/cebagin. Santrinj – a 98% lead oxide product otherwise used as a paint primer – is also used in the Middle East as a home remedy for teething.

==History==

Teething used to be considered (wrongly) a cause of death, as many children died in the first years of life, at the same time as teething occurs. &quot;The tendency in the past to attribute serious disease to teething was so prevalent that in 1842 teething was the registered cause of death in 4.8% of all infants who died in London under the age of 1 year and 7.3% of those between the ages of 1 to 3 years according to the Registrar General&#x27;s report.&quot;

Ironically, while teething is a natural process which creates little more than discomfort, some methods for relieving teething pain have caused serious harm and even death. Old remedies for teething include &quot;blistering, bleeding, placing leeches on the gums, and applying cautery to the back of the head&quot;. In the sixteenth century the French surgeon Ambroise Paré introduced the lancing of gums using a lancet, in the belief that teeth were failing to emerge from the gums due to lack of a pathway, and that this failure was a cause of death. This belief and practice persisted for centuries, with some exceptions, until towards the end of the nineteenth century lancing became increasingly controversial and was then abandoned, although as late as 1938 an Anglo-American dental textbook advised in favour of lancing, and described the procedure. In the first half of the twentieth century, teething powders in the English-speaking world often contained calomel, a form of mercury. It was removed from most powders in 1954 when it was shown to cause &quot;pink disease&quot; (acrodynia), a form of mercury poisoning.

Teething toys have a long history. In England in the 17th–19th centuries, a &quot;coral&quot; meant a teething toy made of coral, ivory, or bone, often mounted in silver as the handle of a rattle. A museum curator has suggested that these substances were used as sympathetic magic, and that the animal bone could symbolize animal strength to help the child cope with pain.

<text>The European Le Mans Series (abbreviated as ELMS) is a European sports car racing endurance series inspired by the 24 Hours of Le Mans race and organized by the Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest (ACO). The European Le Mans Series is similar to the former American Le Mans Series (ALMS) based in the United States and Canada that was running with ACO and IMSA between 1999 and 2013. ELMS team champions and runners-up receive an automatic entry to the following year&#x27;s 24 Hours of Le Mans. Originally titled the Le Mans Endurance Series before becoming simply the Le Mans Series in 2006, the series was renamed once more in 2012, reusing a name previously utilized by IMSA in 2001.

When he was allowed to bring the rules and racing formulae of the 24 Hours of Le Mans to North America with the creation of the Petit Le Mans in 1998, Don Panoz attempted to build a series inspired by the Petit Le Mans. The aged IMSA GT Championship was taken over and became the new American Le Mans Series, and met with much success in 1999.

Europe had lacked a major sports prototype series since the demise of the World Sportscar Championship in 1992. Following the success of the ALMS, Panoz attempting to bring sports prototype racing back to Europe. This led to the 2000 American Le Mans Series season, which included two races in Europe as the Nürburgring and Silverstone Circuit, as well as a round in Australia. These races would serve as a precursor to what would become the separate European Le Mans Series in 2001.

The European Le Mans Series was launched for 2001 with five races, including a premier 1000 km race at Estoril, which would be the European equivalent of the 1000 mile Petit Le Mans and earn automatic entries to the 24 Hours of Le Mans for each class winner.

To aid in the development of the ELMS, the 2001 season shared some races between both ALMS and ELMS. The 12 Hours of Sebring and Petit Le Mans, normally ALMS races, were considered optional races for ELMS teams. At the same time, the ELMS races at Donington Park and Jarama were considered optional for ALMS teams. This allowed for the possibility of boosting the draw from international teams to either series.

The series was unable to earn much attention from European sportscar teams, especially since the final FIA Sportscar Championship and FIA GT Championship series used similar cars, but different rules which would require teams to modify their cars or buy new cars to comply with ELMS rules. For the ELMS events that included ALMS teams, very few teams actually bothered to make the trip across the Atlantic to participate in races that appeared to have very few serious competitors. Thus the entry lists for each race fell from 25 at the beginning of the season to a mere 14 at season&#x27;s end, with some classes only having one or two competitors.

With a lack of involvement from teams, and less interest from the media due to the lack of teams, the European Le Mans Series folded following the 2001 season.

The ACO was not completely satisfied with the fact that IMSA did not fully comply with the ACO&#x27;s regulations in order to help attract privateer teams, as well as the failure of the FIA Sportscar Championship to succeed in Europe. Seeing the success of the American Le Mans Series, the ACO decided that a series run by themselves would be a better alternative for Europe. The ACO would instead attempt to attract factory backed teams with longer endurance races than ALMS and FIA SCC ran. The series would also be European based instead of international, thus it could be closer to the factories of many sportscar teams to help attract them to the series.

In 2003, the ACO announced their intentions to create their own European-based series, named the Le Mans Endurance Series, which would be similar to the original European Le Mans Series, but feature only 1000 km races instead of the shorter, 2 hour 45 minute races used by the ELMS, and fewer races in a season than the ALMS and FIA SCC to help keep costs down. Winners of the LMES championship would go on to earn automatic entries in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, similar to the American Le Mans Series.

The series was initially previewed in an open race run under the LMES banner in 2003 at the 1000km of Le Mans, a one-off event before the season started in 2004.

For the 2004 Le Mans Endurance Series, the series participated in four events, including resurrecting classic races like the 1000km Monza, 1000km Nürburgring, 1000 km Silverstone and the Spa 1000 km. Many competitors participated, making the racing very exciting.

2005 saw the series expand to a five race format with the addition of the Istanbul Racing Circuit.

In 2007, the Le Mans Series held its first and single overseas race in the continent of South America with Mil Milhas Brasil as the sixth round.

In 2010, the Formula Le Mans Cup was integrated into the Le Mans Series, running alongside Le Mans Prototype cars and GT cars.

As the FIA World Endurance Championship was reestablished in 2012, the ELMS had a reduced car count including officially dropping the LMP1 Prototype class from the category and its calendar was reduced to three rounds in Paul Ricard, Donington Park and Road Atlanta (Petit Le Mans).

For 2013, a twenty-nine car field was announced, with eleven in the LMP2 class, ten in the LM GTE class, and five in the new GTC class, which used GT3 technical rules. The calendar featured five races with a duration of 3 hours.

In 2014, the LMPC class was dropped and all races were expanded to 4 hours. 

The 2015 season saw the introduction of the new LMP3 prototype class with cars built from Ligier, Ginetta, ADESS &amp; Norma. Each of these cars chassis are powered by 5.0L Nissan V8 naturally aspirated engines (VK50VE)

In 2016, the GTC class was dropped from the series and moved to a new support series, the GT3 Le Mans Cup. This tournament was held on the same weekends as the European Le Mans Series 4-hour events, as well as on the same week as the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with shorter races than the ELMS.

In 2017, it was established by ACO that the lower teams from LMP3 would drop to the year&#x27;s Michelin Le Mans Cup, while the best LMP3 teams from this competition would be promoted to ELMS. During this year&#x27;s season new ACO LMP2 Prototype Class regulations were introduced with licensed manufacturers such as Dallara, Onroak Automotive (Ligier), Oreca and the joint-venture Riley Tech/Multimatic with Gibson Technology being the exclusive engine supplier.

In 2020, with the season heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 4 Hours of Silverstone race would be dropped from the calendar due to a date not being able to be found. The 4 Hours of Barcelona would also be replaced by a second 4 Hours of Le Castellet race at Circuit Paul Ricard. New ACO Generation II LMP3 ruleset regulation built cars were also eligible for the LMP3 Class in the category featuring manufactured chassis&#x27;s such as the Ginetta G61-LT-P3, Ligier JS P320, Duqueine D-08, and the ADESS-03 Evo all of which use a VK56DE 5.6L Nissan V8 naturally aspirated engine.

In the 2021 season of the ELMS a LMP2 Pro-Am Cup Trophy was introduced aimed at teams who have bronze rated contracted drivers.

In the 2023 season of the ELMS, it marks as the last season of the LMGTE class as it will be replaced with a GT3-Specification class to be known as LMGT3 starting in the year 2024 season with Goodyear being the exclusive tyre supplier.

In the year 2025 season of the European Le Mans Series, it&#x27;ll mark the debut of the new ACO Generation III LMP3 built car set eligible for the category featuring manufactured chassis&#x27;s such as the Ginetta G61-LT-P3 Evo, Ligier JS P325, Duqueine D-09, and the ADESS AD25 all of which use a V35A 3.5L Toyota V6 twin turbo engine and Michelin tyres.

<doc id="895714" wikidata="Q3195738" url="?curid=895714" title="Kevin Lamoureux">
<text>Kevin Lamoureux (born January 22, 1962) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. On November 29, 2010, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the constituency of Winnipeg North in a by-election. He was re-elected during the 2011 election by a margin of just 44 votes and being the only Liberal flip this election. Lamoureux previously served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1999 and from 2003 to 2010, and he twice sought the leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party. He serves in the House of Commons as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada.

==Background==
Lamoureux was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Winnipeg. He worked as a store manager and air traffic control assistant, also serving in the armed forces for three years. His younger brother, Darrin Lamoureux, was the leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party from 2013 to 2017. His daughter, Cindy Lamoureux, is an MLA in northwest Winnipeg; she represented Burrows from 2016 until 2019 and has since represented Tyndall Park.

==Member of the Manitoba Legislature==
Lamoureux first ran for the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1986 election in the north-Winnipeg division of Logan. The Liberal Party did not have a strong provincial organization in this campaign, and Lamoureux finished a distant third against New Democrat Maureen Hemphill.

The Manitoba Liberal Party saw its popularity increase between 1986 and 1988, as many centre-left voters abandoned the New Democratic Party (NDP) government of Howard Pawley. In the 1988 election, the Liberals jumped from one seat—River Heights, represented by party leader Sharon Carstairs—to twenty and became the dominant party in both north and south Winnipeg. Lamoureux scored a narrow victory over NDP incumbent Don Scott in the north end division of Inkster and entered the legislature as a member of the Official Opposition.

The Liberal Party fell back to seven seats in the 1990 provincial election, finishing in third place behind a resurgent New Democratic Party. Lamoureux, however, was re-elected in Inkster with an increased margin of victory.

;Leadership campaigns
Lamoureux ran for the Manitoba Liberal Party&#x27;s leadership in 1993 after the resignation of Sharon Carstairs. He was seen as an &quot;anti-establishment&quot; candidate in this contest, representing north-Winnipeg communities against a party establishment dominated by south-Winnipeg interests. He lost to Paul Edwards.

The Liberals were leading in the polls before the 1995 provincial election, but their support base collapsed during the campaign and the party won only three seats. Lamoureux again increased his majority in Inkster, while Edwards lost in St. James.

Edwards announced his resignation in late 1995, and Lamoureux again stood for the party leadership. He was again regarded as an &quot;anti-establishment&quot; candidate, this time facing Ginny Hasselfield, who was supported by the party&#x27;s leadership. This contest was very divisive, and its ending was controversial. All party members could cast a ballot, and the results were &quot;weighted&quot; by constituency. It is generally acknowledged that Lamoureux received more votes from the party members than Hasselfield. Because his support was concentrated in north Winnipeg, however, Hasselfield won the weighted vote by 21 points.

;Defeat and return
The divisions in the Manitoba Liberal Party continued after the leadership contest. Following the 1997 Canadian federal election, Lamoureux and Gary Kowalski announced that they could no longer support Hasselfield&#x27;s leadership and would sit as &quot;Independent Liberals&quot;. This decision left Neil Gaudry as the party&#x27;s only official member of the legislature. Facing increased pressure, Hasselfield agreed to resign as party leader in early 1998. Former MP Jon Gerrard was elected as her successor, and Lamoureux and Kowalski rejoined the party caucus.

The Liberal Party entered the 1999 provincial election in a weakened state, damaged by the divisions of the previous years. The election itself became polarized between the governing Progressive Conservatives and the opposition New Democratic Party, and the Liberal Party&#x27;s support fell significantly. Although still personally popular, Lamoureux was narrowly defeated by New Democrat Becky Barrett.

Lamoureux ran as a Liberal Party candidate in Winnipeg Centre in the 2000 Canadian federal election. He finished second to New Democratic Party (NDP) incumbent Pat Martin.

Becky Barrett did not seek re-election in 2003, and Lamoureux was again elected to the legislature for Inkster. The only other Liberal to win election in this campaign was Jon Gerrard. Both Lamoureux and Gerrard were re-elected in the 2007 election, but the party did not make any further gains.

==Member of the Canadian House of Commons==
Lamoureux resigned his provincial seat in 2010 to seek election to the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election that was held to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis, who stepped down to run for mayor. He was elected over NDP candidate Kevin Chief, and was re-elected in the 2011 federal election a few months later by a margin of just 44 votes over NDP candidate Rebecca Blaikie. He and Ralph Goodale, who was re-elected in Wascana around Regina, Saskatchewan, were the only two Liberal MPs elected from the Prairie provinces; nationally the party won only 34 seats, the fewest it has ever won.

Lamoureux won re-election in 2015 by a landslide, turning what had been a safe seat for the NDP into one of the Liberals’ strongest seats on the federal stage with almost 70% of the popular vote. He was the only incumbent MP from Winnipeg who was re-elected in 2015, and the Liberals also won a majority government. He was re-elected with a diminished plurality in the 2019 Canadian federal election.

In 2021 the Commissioner of Canada Elections ruled Lamoureux had violated in the Canada Elections Act in the 2019 election. Lamoureux was found to have made seven advertisements on Facebook and Instagram on election day contrary to the prohibition on election day advertising. Lamoureux was ordered to pay a $300 fine. He was re-elected with an absolute majority in the 2021 election.

In the 2025 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, he endorsed Chrystia Freeland.

<text>Sölve () was a sea-king who conquered Vendel-period Sweden by burning the Swedish king Eysteinn to death inside his hall.

The &quot;Heimskringla&quot; relates that he was the son of Högne of Njardö, and that he had his home in Jutland, although according to the older source &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, he was a Geat. He pillaged in the Baltic Sea and at night they made shore in the hundred of Lofond/Lovund (perhaps Lovön or the Lagunda Hundred) where they surrounded a house and set it on fire, killing everybody inside. In the house there was a feast where the Swedish king Eysteinn was invited. Then Sölve and his men arrived in Sigtuna (now Signhildsberg) and declared that the Swedes had to accept him as king. The Swedes refused and fought Sölve for eleven days until they lost. Sölve then ruled Sweden until the Swedes rebelled and killed him.

&quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot; only relates that the Geats burnt Östen and his people to death inside his house.

Sölvi also appears in &quot;Hálfs saga ok Hálfsrekka&quot;, of which there is a version from the year 1300. This saga relates that Sölvi was the son of Högne the Rich of Nærøya &quot;fyrir Naumundalsminni&quot; in Norway and that he was the brother of Hild the Slender. Sölvi&#x27;s brother-in-law, Hjorleiv, was the king of Hordaland and Rogaland and Hjorleiv killed Hreidar, the king of Zealand. Then Hjorleiv put Sölvi as the jarl of Zealand. Later in the saga, Sölvi is no longer the jarl of Zealand, but the king of Sweden. Hjorleiv had a son named Half (after whom the saga is named), and after the Norwegian king Asmund had killed Half, a couple of his champions go to Sweden and king Sölvi (&quot;til svíþjóðar ; fóru þeir ... á fund Sölva konungs&quot;) (see also Gard Agdi).

Sölvi is also mentioned in a few other sources, but none of them relate of his Danish and Swedish dominions.

He was succeeded by Ingvar Harra son of Eysteinn of the Yngling, the Swedish royal dynasty.

<doc id="895721" wikidata="Q611804" url="?curid=895721" title="Clonal colony">
<text>A clonal colony or genet is a group of genetically identical individuals, such as plants, fungi, or bacteria, that have grown in a given location, all originating vegetatively, not sexually, from a single ancestor. In plants, an individual in such a population is referred to as a ramet. In fungi, &quot;individuals&quot; typically refers to the visible fruiting bodies or mushrooms that develop from a common mycelium which, although spread over a large area, is otherwise hidden in the soil. Clonal colonies are common in many plant species. Although many plants reproduce sexually through the production of seed, reproduction occurs by underground stolons or rhizomes in some plants. Above ground, these plants most often appear to be distinct individuals, but underground they remain interconnected and are all clones of the same plant. However, it is not always easy to recognize a clonal colony especially if it spreads underground and is also sexually reproducing.

==Methods of establishment==
With most woody plants, clonal colonies arise by wide-ranging roots that at intervals send up new shoots, termed suckers. Trees and shrubs with branches that may tend to bend and rest on the ground, or which possess the ability to form aerial roots can form colonies via layering, or aerial rooting, e. g. willow, blackberry, fig, and banyan. Some vines naturally form adventitious roots on their stems that take root in the soil when the stems contact the ground, e.g. ivy and trumpet vine. With other vines, rooting of the stem where nodes come into contact with soil may establish a clonal colony, e.g. Wisteria. Ferns and many herbaceous flowering plants often form clonal colonies via horizontal underground stems termed rhizomes, e.g. ostrich fern &quot;Matteuccia struthiopteris&quot; and goldenrod. A number of herbaceous flowering plants form clonal colonies via horizontal surface stems termed stolons, or runners; e.g. strawberry and many grasses. Non-woody plants with underground storage organs such as bulbs and corms can also form colonies, e.g. &quot;Narcissus&quot; and &quot;Crocus&quot;. A few plant species can form colonies via adventitious plantlets that form on leaves, e.g. &quot;Kalanchoe daigremontiana&quot; and &quot;Tolmiea menziesii&quot;. A few plant species can form colonies via asexual seeds, termed apomixis, e.g. dandelion.

==Record colonies==
The only known natural example of King&#x27;s Lomatia (&quot;Lomatia tasmanica&quot;) found growing in the wild is a clonal colony in Tasmania estimated to be 43,600 years old.

A group of 47,000 Quaking Aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;) trees (nicknamed &quot;Pando&quot;) in the Wasatch Mountains, Utah, United States, has been shown to be a single clone connected by the root system. It is sometimes considered the world&#x27;s largest organism by mass, covering , and also as among the world&#x27;s oldest living organisms, at an estimated 14,000 years old.

Another possible candidate for oldest organism on earth is an underwater meadow of the marine plant &quot;Posidonia oceanica&quot; in the Mediterranean Sea, which could be up to 100,000 years of age.

==Examples==
When woody plants form clonal colonies, they often remain connected through the root system, sharing roots, water and mineral nutrients. A few non-vining, woody plants that form clonal colonies are Bigelow oak (&quot;Quercus sinuata&quot; var. &quot;breviloba&quot;), quaking aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;), bayberry (&quot;Myrica pensylvanica&quot;), black locust (&quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot;), creosote bush (&quot;Larrea tridentata&quot;), bladdernut, blueberry (&quot;Vaccinium&quot;), devil&#x27;s club (&quot;Oplopanax horridus&quot;), forsythia, hazelnut (&quot;Corylus&quot;), honey locust (&quot;Gleditsia triacanthos&quot;), Kentucky coffeetree (&quot;Gymnocladus dioicus&quot;), kerria (&quot;Kerria japonica&quot;), pawpaw (&quot;Asimina triloba&quot;), poplars (&quot;Populus&quot;), sassafras (&quot;Sassafras albidum&quot;), sumac (&quot;Rhus&quot;), sweetgum (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot;), and sweetshrub (&quot;Calycanthus floridus&quot;).

<text>David Ray Roberts (born May 31, 1972), nicknamed &quot;Doc&quot;, is a Japanese American professional baseball manager and former outfielder who is the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for five MLB teams over a ten-year career and then coached for the San Diego Padres before being named Dodgers manager in 2016. Although he played for the Boston Red Sox for only part of one season, his most notable achievement as a player was a key stolen base in the 2004 American League Championship Series that extended the Red Sox&#x27;s postseason, which culminated in a championship in the 2004 World Series. Roberts batted and threw left-handed.

The son of a Japanese mother and an African American father, Roberts became the first manager of Asian heritage to lead a team to the World Series in , when the Dodgers captured the National League pennant. He also led the Dodgers to the World Series in , , and , winning in 2020 and 2024. Roberts is the first manager of Asian heritage and second African American manager to lead a team to a World Series title.

==Early life==
David Ray Roberts was born on May 31, 1972, in Naha, Okinawa, Japan. He was born to Waymon, a United States Marine stationed in Japan and Eiko, a Japanese woman native to Okinawa. Roberts has a younger sister, Melissa. His childhood was spent moving from one military base to another in two- and three-year sequences, first in Okinawa where he was born, then to multiple bases in California, to Okinawa again, to North Carolina, to Hawaii and finally back to California, eventually settling in San Diego.

Roberts attended Vista High School as a freshman and was the most valuable player of the junior varsity baseball team. He transferred to Rancho Buena Vista High School when it opened the following year, where he was a standout in football, basketball and baseball. In football, he was a three-year starter at quarterback; as a senior, he helped lead his team to the San Diego Section Class 3A championship. Roberts was recruited to play football for the Air Force Academy as an option quarterback, but declined because he wanted to play baseball.

==College career==
Roberts decided to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and joined their Bruins baseball team as a walk-on outfielder after impressing coaches with his speed and enthusiasm. He hit .331 as a sophomore with 36 stolen bases and as a junior he hit .296 with 28 stolen bases. The Cleveland Indians drafted him in the 47th round of the 1993 MLB draft. He was disappointed with being drafted so low, behind seven other UCLA juniors, and his coach told him he needed to improve his defense and that his weak throwing arm was hurting his draft stock. He improved by getting to the ball quicker and was able to lead the Bruins in outfield assists as a senior, while also hitting .353 with 45 steals. He left UCLA as the school&#x27;s all-time stolen-base leader and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1995.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
The Detroit Tigers selected Roberts in the 28th round of the 1994 MLB draft and signed him on June 9, 1994. He began his career with the Jamestown Jammers, the Tigers&#x27; short-season class A team in the New York–Pennsylvania League. Roberts hit .292 with 12 steals for the Jammers, who won the division title with a 42–32 record. For the 1995 season, he was promoted to play for the Lakeland Tigers in the Florida State League, where he hit .303 in 92 games with 30 stolen bases, fourth best in the league.

In 1996, Roberts was assigned to the Visalia Oaks of the California League. The Oaks were a co-op team made up of players from several organizations. He was frustrated with the assignment and thought about quitting baseball but his father talked him out of it. In 126 games, he hit .272 with 65 stolen bases, which led all of minor league baseball and he scored 112 runs, tops in the Cal League. He appeared in three games for the AA Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League at the end of the season and had two hits in nine at-bats. He also hit a three-run home run in the 15th inning to help the Suns win Game 1 of their playoff series. He remained at Jacksonville the next season, playing in 105 games for them, with a .296 average and 23 steals. In 1998, Roberts once again began the season with the Suns. He played in 69 games and hit .326 with 21 stolen bases and was named to the Southern League mid-season all-star team.

===Cleveland Indians (1999–2001)===
In June 1998, Roberts and Tim Worrell were traded to the Cleveland Indians for Gerónimo Berroa. Roberts was traded just before the Southern League All-Star Game and played in the game wearing an Indians hat even though the Indians did not have a Southern League team at the time. He was assigned to the Akron Aeros of the Eastern League, where he batted .361 in 56 games with 28 steals. He was promoted to the Buffalo Bisons, the Indians&#x27; Triple-A team in the International League, late in the season. He had only two hits in 15 at-bats for the Bisons but remained with the team in the playoffs, as the Bisons won their first Governors&#x27; Cup in nearly 40 years and made it to the Triple-A World Series. Roberts later said his promotion to Buffalo was exciting because he realized he was getting close to the big leagues and his time there made him a better player.

Roberts played with the Cañeros de Los Mochis of the Mexican Pacific League during the 1998–99 season before playing for the Criollos de Caguas in Puerto Rico, where he played with Alex Cora, and had Joey Cora as general manager. Almost 20 years later Roberts, as manager of the Dodgers, would go on to meet Alex Cora as manager of the Red Sox in the 2018 MLB World Series.

Roberts was a non-roster invitee at Indians spring training in 1999 but was assigned to Buffalo to start the season. In 89 games for the Bisons, he had a .271 batting average with 39 steals. He earned International League all-star honors for the season. His contract was purchased by the Indians on August 7, 1999 and he made his major league debut batting leadoff and playing center field for the Indians against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In his debut he had three hits in five at-bats and stole a base: he was also picked off once. His first MLB hit was a double to center field in his second at-bat, off of Bobby Witt of the Devil Rays in the second inning. He hit his first home run on August 30 off of Ramón Ortiz of the Anaheim Angels. On September 24, he hit a grand slam homer off of John Hudek of the Toronto Blue Jays. Overall, he was in 41 games for the Indians in 1999 and hit .238 with two homers, 12 RBI and 11 stolen bases. He also appeared in two games of the 1999 American League Division Series (ALDS), going hitless in three at-bats.

Roberts spent most of 2000 back in the minors with Buffalo, where he had a .292 average in 120 games with a career high 13 homers, 55 RBI and 39 steals. He also was second in the league with 93 runs scored. He was called up to the Indians briefly from May 26–29 and then was called up when rosters expanded in September. In 19 games for the Indians, he had only two hits in 10 at-bats while being used primarily as a late-game defensive replacement. After the season, he had surgery on his left shoulder to repair a torn labrum and fraying around his rotator cuff, which caused him to begin the following season on the 60-day disabled list. When he returned on June 24, he was optioned back to the Bisons, where he hit .303 in 62 games. His 97 career steals in parts of four seasons in Buffalo ranks as the tops in franchise history and he would eventually be selected to the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame. He was again recalled to the majors in September and had four hits in 12 at-bats in 15 games for the Indians. In parts of three seasons with Cleveland, he hit .242 in 75 games.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2002–2004)===

On December 22, 2001, Roberts was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for minor league pitchers Christian Bridenbaugh and Nial Hughes. The 2002 season with the Dodgers was Roberts&#x27;s first full season on a major league roster. He was the leadoff hitter and starter as a center fielder. He finished the season with a .277 batting average in 127 games with 45 stolen bases. He missed the final seven games of the regular season with a partially torn oblique.

In 2003, Roberts appeared in only 107 games due to hamstring problems but managed to steal 42 bases while hitting .250. He was the 10th Dodgers player in history with consecutive 40-steal seasons. He committed his first career error on April 22 against the Cincinnati Reds, snapping a streak of 205 errorless games. He began the 2004 campaign with the Dodgers and hit .253 in 68 games with 33 steals despite missing most of May because of a recurrence of hamstring issues.

===Boston Red Sox (2004)===
On July 31, 2004, the Dodgers traded Roberts to the Boston Red Sox for minor league outfielder Henri Stanley. Roberts played in 45 games for the Red Sox and hit .256.

Roberts made a large contribution to the 2004 Red Sox post-season even though he did not play in the 2004 World Series. Most notable was his stolen base against the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series Game 4. The Red Sox were facing elimination in the bottom of the ninth inning, down four runs to three. Kevin Millar drew a walk from Yankees closer Mariano Rivera. Roberts, who had not played in ten days, came in to pinch run with Bill Mueller hitting. Rivera attempted to pick off Roberts three times. On the first pitch to Mueller, Roberts stole second base, barely beating Yankee catcher Jorge Posada&#x27;s throw. After the steal, Mueller singled, Roberts scored from second, and the Sox went on to win the game in 12 innings, beginning their run of eight straight wins that culminated in Boston&#x27;s first World Series title since 1918. In 2006, the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame recognized the steal as a Memorable Moment in Red Sox history.

===San Diego Padres (2005–2006)===
The Red Sox traded Roberts to the San Diego Padres on December 20, 2004, in exchange for outfielder Jay Payton, infielder Ramón Vázquez, minor league pitcher David Pauley, and cash.

Roberts played center field for the Padres in 2005, hitting .275 in 115 games and moving to left field when Gold Glove winner Mike Cameron from the New York Mets was acquired before the 2006 season. That season Roberts established career highs with a .293 batting average, 49 steals, and 13 triples. The latter statistic tied Tony Gwynn&#x27;s 19-year single-season franchise record. In the 2006 National League Division Series, Roberts hit .438 to lead the Padres, even though they were eliminated from the playoffs by the St. Louis Cardinals.

===San Francisco Giants (2007–2008)===

In December 2006, Roberts signed with the San Francisco Giants. The Giants, trying to acquire a center fielder, first tried to sign Gary Matthews, Jr. and Juan Pierre, but both players passed on the Giants in favor of other teams. Roberts agreed to a 3-year, $18-million deal with the team in early December 2006. The Giants backloaded the deal agreeing to pay Roberts $5 million in 2007 and $6.5 million in 2008 and 2009.

Roberts&#x27;s career with the Giants got off to a slow start because of injury. He spent most of May and early June on the disabled list. Roberts was batting only .216 before he went on the disabled list, but his swing had been hampered by the bone chips and spurs in his elbow that required surgery. He finished the season hitting .260 in 114 games with 31 stolen bases. Continually bothered by injuries, he only played in 52 games in 2008, hitting a career low .224 with only five steals.

On March 5, 2009, the Giants released Roberts even though they owed him money for the last year of his contract.

===Player profile===
Roberts had above-average knowledge of the strike zone and used it to his advantage. He had little power, but was a spray hitter who used raw speed to get on base and stretch singles to doubles. Once on base, he commonly &quot;manufactured&quot; runs with such tactics as stealing second base, moving to third on a grounder, and coming home on a sacrifice fly. When healthy, Roberts was widely known as one of the best base stealers in baseball. From 2002 to 2006, he had 195 steals, as well as an 81 percent success rate, both of which were the second-best in the majors among base stealers with 175 steals just behind stolen base king Rickey Henderson in the career stolen base rate rankings. In fact, Roberts&#x27; career stolen base success rate is 21st all-time among players with at least 300 career attempts. He had exceptional range in the outfield, but his below-average arm occasionally allowed his opponents to take extra bases on him.

==Broadcasting career==
In May 2009, Roberts retired from baseball and joined NESN as a studio analyst and occasional color commentator for Red Sox telecasts. After one season as a broadcaster, he left the network to join the Padres as a Baseball Operations Special Assistant, where he would work with players in the organization on outfield defense, base running and bunting.

==Coaching and managerial career==
===San Diego Padres (2011–2015)===

On October 18, 2010, Roberts was hired by the San Diego Padres as the first base coach replacing Rick Renteria when he was promoted to bench coach. When Rentería was named manager of the Chicago Cubs after the 2013 season, Roberts once again succeeded him, named as manager Bud Black&#x27;s bench coach for the 2014 campaign.

On June 15, 2015, Roberts filled in as the Padres&#x27; manager for one game when Black was fired after starting 2015 at 32–33 and six games behind in the National League West. The Padres lost that game 9–1 to the Oakland Athletics. Pat Murphy was named as the new manager the next day and Roberts returned to his bench coach role for the rest of the season.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2016–present)===
Roberts was named manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers on November 23, 2015. He became the first minority manager in the franchise&#x27;s history. In 2016, the Dodgers set the MLB record in Roberts&#x27;s first year by placing 28 players on the disabled list throughout the season, as well as the record for the most pitching changes (606) in a single season. Despite the injuries, the Dodgers won their fourth consecutive NL West title and advanced to the 2016 NLCS, losing to the eventual champions Chicago Cubs in 6 games. Roberts received praise during the postseason for how he used Kenley Jansen in non-traditional closer situations. He was selected as the &quot;Sporting News&quot; National League Manager of the Year and was voted by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America as the National League Manager of the Year.

In 2017, Roberts led the Dodgers back to the playoffs, where they swept the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 2017 NLDS and then defeated the Chicago Cubs in five games in the 2017 NLCS. Roberts became first manager of Asian heritage ever in the World Series, as well as the fourth African-American manager. The Dodgers faced the Houston Astros in the 2017 World Series, where they were defeated in seven games. It was later determined that the Astros illegally stole signs during the 2017 regular season and postseason.

In 2018, the Dodgers got off to a rocky start at the beginning of the season with a 16–26 record, but rebounded to win the NL West, finishing 92–71. Roberts led the Dodgers to the 2018 World Series after the Dodgers defeated the Atlanta Braves three games to one in the 2018 NLDS and then defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in seven games in the NLCS. The Dodgers faced one of Roberts&#x27;s former teams, the Boston Red Sox, and former Dodgers teammate Alex Cora for the championship. Boston won the series in five games, giving the Red Sox their ninth World Series title and the Dodgers a second consecutive World Series loss.

On December 3, 2018, Roberts and the Dodgers agreed to a four-year contract extension, through the 2022 season.

In 2019, Roberts led the team to an 106–56 record, the second highest mark in the league that season and a franchise record. However, they were upset by the Washington Nationals in the NLDS in 5 games, who went on to win it all.

In 2020, Roberts led the Dodgers to the playoffs once more. They swept the Milwaukee Brewers in the 2020 National League Wild Card Series and the San Diego Padres in the 2020 NLDS, both of which had modified schedules due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After coming back from a 3–1 deficit against the Atlanta Braves in the 2020 NLCS, the Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in six games in the 2020 World Series. Roberts became the first African-American manager of a World Series-winning team since Cito Gaston and the first manager of Asian heritage to win the World Series.
On March 25, 2022, Roberts signed a three-year contract extension with the Dodgers through the 2025 season. The Dodgers won 111 games in 2022, a mark only reached by four other teams in MLB history. It was the fourth time Roberts had a 100 win season, after doing it in 2017, 2019, and 2021. However, they lost in the 2022 National League Division Series to the San Diego Padres. This meant that the 2022 Dodgers had the most wins of a team to fail to win a postseason series in the division era. In the past four full seasons, the Dodgers won 100 games each time but only reached the NLCS once. They repeated as NL West champions with 100 wins in 2023 but lost yet again in the NLDS, this time to the 84-win Arizona Diamondbacks in a straight three-game sweep where Arizona never trailed at any point in the series. It was the third season in a row that the Dodgers had lost a playoff series to a team that had at least 15 more losses than the Dodgers.

In 2024, Roberts led the Dodgers to the National League pennant for the fourth time in his tenure as manager. In the World Series, the Dodgers defeated the American League champion New York Yankees in five games, securing his second and the franchise&#x27;s eighth World Series title.

===Managerial record===

==Personal life==

Roberts married his high school girlfriend, Tricia, in 1997. They have two children, son Cole and daughter Emme. Cole played college baseball for Loyola Marymount University and is currently in the Arizona Diamondbacks minor league system. Roberts, along with former teammate Rich Aurilia and friends John and Noelle Micek, have been partners in Red Stitch Winery, based in Cardiff, California, since 2008.

In March 2010, Roberts was diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. After receiving treatments for lymphoma, Roberts reported he received a clean bill of health in June 2011.

Roberts is a Christian.

<text>St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery is located on Harrow Road, Kensal Green in London, England. It has its own Catholic chapel.

The cemetery, founded in 1858, is the resting place of over 165,000 Roman Catholics. The 29-acre cemetery has memorials for Belgian soldiers and Commonwealth service personnel from both World Wars, along with numerous foreign nationality war graves. Notable burials include British spy Peter Ashmun Ames, conductor Sir John Barbirolli, and activist Marcus Garvey. The cemetery, which is open year-round, features a chapel used for funeral and memorial services. Visitors can consult computerized burial records dating back to 1858 at the cemetery office.

==History==
Established in 1858, the site was built next door to Kensal Green Cemetery. It is the final resting place for more than 165,000 individuals of the Roman Catholic faith, and features a memorial to Belgian soldiers of the First World War, wounded in combat and evacuated to England, where they died in hospital.

There is also a War Memorial, in the form of a Cross of Sacrifice to the British, Irish, French, Czechoslovakian and Canadian servicemen. It is surrounded by a Screen Wall memorial and a low kerb listing Commonwealth service personnel of both World Wars whose graves in the cemetery could not be marked by headstones. In all, the cemetery contains 208 graves of Commonwealth service personnel of the First World War, and 107 graves of the Second World War. There are also many foreign nationality war graves that include, from First World War, 77 Belgians and six Germans, and from the Second, eight Czechoslovakian and six Polish war graves.

Many Irish migrants who came to England during the Great Famine are buried here.

<text>Randvér or Randver was a legendary Danish king. In Nordic legends, according to &quot;Sögubrot&quot; and the &quot;Lay of Hyndla&quot;, he was the son of Ráðbarðr the king of Garðaríki and Auðr the Deep-Minded, the daughter of the Danish-Swedish ruler Ivar Vidfamne. In these two sources, Auðr had Randver&#x27;s brother, Harald Wartooth, in a previous marriage.

One of the genealogies in &quot;Hversu Noregr Byggðist&quot; seems to say that he is the son of Hrœrekr slöngvanbaugi and the brother of Harald Wartooth. Hrœrekr was, according to &quot;Sögubrot&quot;, a Danish king on Zealand who was killed by Ivar Vidfamne.

According to &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; both Randver and Harald Wartooth were the sons of Valdar and Alfhild, the daughter of Ivar Vidfamne. This saga relates that Ivar appointed Valdar as the king of Denmark, and when Valdar died, he was succeeded by Randver. Randver married Åsa Haraldsdottir of Agder (in other sagas said to be the wife of Gudrød the Hunter of Vestfold), who gave birth to a son, Sigurd Hring. After his brother Harald had reclaimed Götaland (or Gotland depending on the manuscript), Randver fell in battle in England.

The &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; says that Randver was succeeded as Danish king by his son Sigurd Hring (probably as Harald&#x27;s viceroy). However, &quot;Sögubrot&quot; says that Harald Wartooth elevated Sigurd Hring as sub-king of Sweden and Västergötland.The Danish chronicle of Saxo Grammaticus (c. 1200) does not clearly mention Randver, but rather asserts that Hring was the son of the Swedish king Ingjald and an unnamed sister of Harald Wartooth.

The Danish scholar Gudmund Schütte drew a parallel between the pair Ráðbarðr - Randver in &quot;Langfeðgatal&quot; and the pair Rædhere - Rondhere that is mentioned in line 123 in the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;Widsith&quot; (7th century?). Schütte&#x27;s argument was that lists of heroic figures found in &quot;Widsith&quot; were reflected in the ordering of names in some later medieval sagas and chronicles.

<text>Trouble on Triton: An Ambiguous Heterotopia (1976) is a science fiction novel by American writer Samuel R. Delany. It was nominated for the 1976 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and was shortlisted for a retrospective James Tiptree, Jr. Award in 1995. It was originally published under the shorter title Triton.

Delany has said that &quot;Trouble on Triton&quot; was written partly in dialogue with Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s anarchist science fiction novel &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;, whose subtitle was &quot;An Ambiguous Utopia&quot;. It is also loosely linked to other books by him (particularly &quot;Neveryóna&quot;) in its references to &quot;the modular calculus&quot;, a vaguely described future mathematics that would analyze analogies, fictional constructs, and possibly human personalities. The most recent U.S. edition from Wesleyan University Press (1996) has a foreword by the postmodern novelist Kathy Acker, focusing on &quot;Trouble on Triton&quot; as Orphic fiction.

== Plot introduction ==
As the subtitle implies, the novel offers several conflicting perspectives on the concept of utopia. &quot;Utopia&quot; literally means &quot;good place&quot; or &quot;no place&quot;. Delany takes the term &quot;heterotopia&quot; from the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault. Literally, heterotopia means &quot;other place&quot; or &quot;a place of differences&quot;. Foucault uses the term to designate spaces outside everyday fixed institutional and social spaces, for example trains, motels and cemeteries. In the novel&#x27;s future Solar System, Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton supports one of several human societies independent from Earth, which has developed along radically libertarian lines in some ways: although a representative government exists, it has virtually no power to regulate private behavior, and citizens may choose to live in an area where no laws apply at all. Technology provides for a high degree of self-modification, so that one can change one&#x27;s physical appearance, gender, sexual orientation, and even specific patterns of likes and dislikes.

== Plot summary ==
The novel examines how Triton&#x27;s freedoms and customs are perceived by the main characters, particularly Bron Helstrom, a young man who has previously worked on Mars as a prostitute. The society of Mars is far harsher than that of Triton, and it has evidently influenced Bron&#x27;s personality. He is self-absorbed, often lacks insight about himself and others, and has great difficulty with personal relationships. Although the civilization of Triton offers everything that he could reasonably want, he is unhappy with his life, out of harmony with those around him, and continually looking for others to blame whenever things go wrong.

As the novel continues, political tensions between Triton and Earth lead to a destructive interplanetary war. This is mainly used as the backdrop for Bron&#x27;s (ultimately disastrous) relationship with a brilliant young woman known as the Spike, but Delany speculates about how an interplanetary war might actually unfold.

==Reception==
Although dissatisfied with the novel&#x27;s &quot;abrupt&quot; conclusion, Richard A. Lupoff praised &quot;Triton&quot; as &quot;a thoroughly absorbing, highly rewarding reading experience. . . . a noble and fascinating experiment [that] speaks well for the author.&quot; In a 2008 review for Tor.com, Jo Walton praises &quot;Trouble on Triton&quot; for being a “personal is political” novel, which was not typical for its contemporaries in the science fiction genre.

== Technology ==
The novel offers a unique directional artificial gravitational field created by inducing relativistic motion of atomic particles, essentially extreme elliptical orbits.

== Connections to other works ==
&quot;Trouble on Triton&quot; is not to be confused with the 1941 Henry Kuttner novel or the 1954 Alan E. Nourse novel &quot;Trouble on Titan.&quot;

The title of the novel was inspired by Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s 1952 opera, &quot;Trouble in Tahiti&quot;. Fred Pohl, the editor at Bantam, made Delany shorten the title to &quot;Triton&quot; to avoid confusion.

&quot;Trouble on Triton&quot; contains the first two parts of the five-part series &quot;Some Informal Remarks Toward the Modular Calculus&quot;, which continues in several volumes of the &quot;Return to Nevèrÿon&quot; series. The novel as a whole is Part One, while Part Two is the novel&#x27;s second appendix.

Bron&#x27;s home city of Bellona on Mars shares its name with the Bellona where Delany&#x27;s other novel &quot;Dhalgren&quot; is set.
Several plot elements in &quot;Trouble on Triton&quot; have similar corresponding elements in Delany&#x27;s &quot;Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand&quot;.

&quot;Trouble on Triton&quot; is set in the same universe as Delany&#x27;s short story &quot;Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones&quot;, included in his collection &quot;Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories&quot;.

The complex game &quot;vlet&quot;, which Bron observes the play of, is inspired by the Joanna Russ short story &quot;A Game of Vlet&quot;, found in her collection &quot;The Zanzibar Cat&quot;.

<text>BBC Look North is the BBC&#x27;s TV news service for East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, produced by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. The programmes are produced and broadcast from the BBC Broadcasting Centre at Queens Court in Kingston upon Hull, with reporters also based in Lincoln.

Peter Levy is the main presenter/newsreader on the 13:30 and 18:30 weekday bulletins, whilst the 22:30 and &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; bulletins are presented by different journalists.

The programme can be watched in any part of the UK (and Europe) from Astra 2E on Freesat channel 967 and Sky channel 957, and in select areas on Virgin Media channel 858. The latest edition of &quot;Look North&quot; is also available to watch on the BBC iPlayer.

==Broadcasts==
On weekdays, &quot;Look North&quot; broadcasts six three-minute opt-outs during &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; at 27 and 57 minutes past each hour – as of June 2016, the bulletins are also shared with &quot;Look North&quot;&#x27;s sister service in Yorkshire and the North Midlands, as part of a pilot scheme. These bulletins originally came from the BBC&#x27;s Hull studios, but now they come from the BBC&#x27;s Leeds studios. 

A 15-minute lunchtime news airs at 1.30 pm, before the main half-hour edition at 6:30 pm. and a 15-minute bulletin shown at 10:25 pm, following the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;.

&quot;Look North&quot; also airs three bulletins during the weekend: early evening bulletins on Saturday and Sunday and a late night bulletin on Sundays, following the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;. The times of these bulletins vary.

==Coverage area==
The programme&#x27;s main coverage area is East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, the editorial areas covered by BBC Lincolnshire and BBC Radio Humberside. Some households in rural north-west Norfolk such as King&#x27;s Lynn, Hunstanton and Wells-next-the-Sea and eastern parts of Nottinghamshire such as Retford, Mansfield and parts of Newark receive the Hull edition of &quot;Look North&quot;.

Freeview viewers in Goole, Gainsborough, Market Weighton, Pocklington and some western parts of Scunthorpe get better television signals from the Emley Moor transmitter that broadcast &quot;Look North&quot; from Leeds. However, most of those areas (except the Goole area, which has always received the Leeds edition on satellite channel 101) are given &quot;Look North&quot; (East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire) on Channel 101 through satellite television such as Freesat as default via the towns&#x27; postcodes.

South west of Lincolnshire (South Kesteven) is served by &quot;East Midlands Today&quot; that broadcast from Nottingham which is received from the Waltham transmitter. However, the area can still switch to the Belmont transmitter to watch &quot;Look North&quot; which also covers the area.

==History==
&quot;Look North&quot;″s Hull-based programme began in November 2002, presented by Helen Fospero and Peter Levy. The programme was presented from a small television studio built into the existing BBC Radio Humberside building on Chapel Street and was directed from a technical gallery at Leeds. The programme&#x27;s first editor was Roger Farrant.

Before 11 November 2002, this region was part of a &quot;BBC North&quot; region, served by &quot;Look North&quot; from Leeds with short six-minute opt-outs for the area (introduced during 2001) during the main evening programme at 6:30 pm and the &quot;BBC Ten O&#x27; Clock News&quot;. The November 2002 changes saw the opt extended to become a full half-hour programme at 6:30 pm, with the 10:25 pm opt-out remaining unchanged. Daytime and weekend bulletins were carried from Leeds.

In 2004, &quot;Look North&quot;, along with BBC Radio Humberside and the Online/Interactive Project, moved to new studios and offices in Queen&#x27;s Gardens. Within a short time of going live from the new studios, dedicated daytime and weekend bulletins for the region were introduced, replacing the previous arrangement of carrying bulletins from Leeds.

<doc id="895741" wikidata="Q535396" url="?curid=895741" title="Anzia Yezierska">
<text>Anzia Yezierska (October 29, 1880 – November 20, 1970) was an American novelist born in Mały Płock, Poland, which was then part of the Russian Empire. She emigrated as a child with her parents to the United States and lived in the immigrant neighborhood of the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

== Personal life ==
Yezierska was born in 1880 in Mały Płock to Bernard and Pearl Yezierski. Her family emigrated to America around 1893, following in the footsteps of her eldest brother, who had arrived in the States six years prior. They lived on the Lower East Side, Manhattan.

Her family was Jewish, and assumed the surname, Mayer, while Anzia took Harriet (or Hattie) as her first name. She later reclaimed her original name, Anzia Yezierska, in her late twenties. Her father was a scholar of Torah and sacred texts. Anzia Yezierska&#x27;s parents encouraged her brothers to pursue higher education but believed she and her sisters had to support their husbands and families.

In 1910, she fell in love with Arnold Levitas but instead married his friend Jacob Gordon, a New York attorney. After 6 months, the marriage was annulled. Shortly after, she married Arnold Levitas in a religious ceremony to avoid legal complications. Arnold was the father of her only child, Louise, born May 29, 1912.

Around 1914, Yezierska left Levitas and moved with her daughter to San Francisco. She worked as a social worker. Overwhelmed with the chores and responsibilities of raising her daughter, she gave up her maternal rights and transferred them to Levitas. In 1916, she and Levitas officially divorced.

She then moved back to New York City. Starting in 1917, she had a romantic relationship with philosopher John Dewey, a professor at Columbia University. Both Dewey and Yezierska wrote about one another, alluding to the relationship.

Her sister encouraged her to pursue her interest in writing. She devoted the remainder of her life to it.

Yezierska was the aunt of American film critic Cecelia Ager. Ager&#x27;s daughter became known as journalist Shana Alexander.

Anzia Yezierska died November 21, 1970, of a stroke in a nursing home in Ontario, California.

== Writing career ==
Yezierska wrote about the struggles of Jewish and later Puerto Rican immigrants in New York&#x27;s Lower East Side. In her fifty-year writing career, she explored the cost of acculturation and assimilation among immigrants. Her stories provide insight into the meaning of liberation for immigrants—particularly Jewish immigrant women. Many of her works of fiction can be labeled semi-autobiographical. In her writing, she drew from her life growing up as an immigrant in New York&#x27;s Lower East Side. Her works feature elements of realism with attention to detail; she often has characters express themselves in Yiddish-English dialect. Her sentimentalism and highly idealized characters have prompted some critics to classify her works as romantic.

Yezierska turned to writing around 1912. Turmoil in her personal life prompted her to write stories focused on problems faced by wives. In the beginning, she had difficulty finding a publisher for her work. But her persistence paid off in December 1915 when her story, &quot;The Free Vacation House&quot; was published in &quot;The Forum&quot;. She attracted more critical attention about a year later when another tale, &quot;Where Lovers Dream&quot; appeared in &quot;Metropolitan&quot;. Her literary endeavors received more recognition when her rags-to-riches story, &quot;The Fat of the Land,&quot; appeared in noted editor Edward J. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s collection, &quot;Best Short Stories of 1919&quot;. Yezierska&#x27;s early fiction was eventually collected by publisher Houghton Mifflin and released as a book titled &quot;Hungry Hearts&quot; in 1920. Another collection of stories, &quot;Children of Loneliness&quot;, followed two years later. These stories focus on the children of immigrants and their pursuit of the American Dream.

Some literary critics argue that Yezierska&#x27;s strength as an author was best found in her novels. Her first novel, &quot;Salome of the Tenements&quot; (1923), was inspired by her friend Rose Pastor Stokes. Stokes gained fame as a young immigrant woman when she married a wealthy young man of a prominent Episcopalian New York family in 1904.

Her most studied work is &quot;Bread Givers&quot; (1925). It explores the life of a young Jewish-American immigrant woman struggling to live from day to day while searching to find her place in American society. &quot;Bread Givers&quot; remains her best known novel.

&quot;Arrogant Beggar&quot; chronicles the adventures of narrator Adele Lindner. She exposes the hypocrisy of the charitably run Hellman Home for Working Girls after fleeing from the poverty of the Lower East Side.

In 1929–1930 Yezierska received a Zona Gale fellowship at the University of Wisconsin, which gave her a financial stipend. She wrote several stories and finished a novel while serving as a fellow. She published &quot;All I Could Never Be&quot; (1932) after returning to New York City.

The end of the 1920s marked a decline of interest in Yezierska&#x27;s work. During the Great Depression, she worked for the Federal Writers Project of the Works Progress Administration. During this time, she wrote the novel, &quot;All I Could Never Be&quot;. Published in 1932, this work was inspired by her own struggles. As portrayed in the book, she identified as an immigrant and never felt truly American, believing native-born people had an easier time. It was the last novel Yezierska published before falling into obscurity.

Her fictionalized autobiography, &quot;Red Ribbon on a White Horse&quot; (1950), was published when she was nearly 70 years old. This revived interest in her work, as did the trend in the 1960s and 1970s to study literature by women. &quot;The Open Cage&quot; is one of Yezierska&#x27;s bleakest stories, written during her later years of life. She began writing it in 1962 at the age of 81. It compares the life of an old woman to that of an ailing bird.

Although she was nearly blind, Yezierska continued writing. She had stories, articles, and book reviews published until her death in California in 1970.

== Yezierska and Hollywood ==
The success of Anzia Yezierska&#x27;s early short stories led to a brief, but significant, relationship between the author and Hollywood. Movie producer Samuel Goldwyn bought the rights to Yezierska&#x27;s collection &quot;Hungry Hearts&quot;. The silent film of the same title (1922) was shot on location at New York&#x27;s Lower East Side with Helen Ferguson, E. Alyn Warren, and Bryant Washburn. In recent years, the film was restored through the efforts of the National Center for Jewish Film, the Samuel Goldwyn Company, and the British Film Institute; in 2006, a new score was composed to accompany it. The San Francisco Jewish Film Festival showed the restored print in July 2010. Yezierska&#x27;s 1923 novel &quot;Salome of the Tenements&quot; was adapted and produced as a silent film of the same title (1925).

Recognizing the popularity of Yezierska&#x27;s stories, Goldwyn gave the author a $100,000 contract to write screenplays. In California, her success led her to be called by publicists, &quot;the sweatshop Cinderella.&quot; She was uncomfortable with being touted as an example of the American Dream. Frustrated by the shallowness of Hollywood and by her own alienation, Yezierska returned to New York by 1925. She continued publishing novels and stories about immigrant women struggling to establish their identities in America.

<text>Eysteinn Beli or &quot;Eysteinn hinn illráði&quot;, Swedish: &quot;Östen Illråde&quot; (ill-ruler) or &quot;Östen Beli&quot;, was a semi-legendary king of Sweden who would have ruled in the late 8th century.

==&quot;Krákumál&quot;==
According to &quot;Krákumál&quot; (stanza 7), he fell at Ulleråker south of Uppsala.
==Ragnarssona þáttr==
The apparently oldest version, &quot;Ragnarssona þáttr&quot;, relates that Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s sons had left Sweden and conquered Zealand, Reidgotaland (here Jutland), Gotland, Öland and all the minor islands. Ivar the Boneless, the leader, then settled at Lejre with his brothers.

Ragnar was jealous with his sons&#x27; successes, and set Eysteinn as the jarl of Sweden, telling him to protect Sweden from his sons. He then went east across the Baltic Sea to pillage and to show his own skills.

Ragnar&#x27;s sons Eric and Agnar then sailed into Lake Mälaren and sent a message to king Eysteinn that they wanted him to submit to Ragnar&#x27;s sons, and Eric said that he wanted Eysteinn&#x27;s daughter Borghild as wife. Eysteinn said that he first wanted to consult the Swedish chieftains. The chieftains said no to the offer, and ordered an attack on the rebellious sons. A battle ensued and Eric and Agnar were overwhelmed by the Swedish forces, whereupon Agnar died and Eric was taken prisoner.

Eysteinn offered Eric as much of Uppsala öd as he wanted, and Borghild, in wergild for Agnar. Eric proclaimed that after such a defeat he wanted nothing but to choose the day of his own death. Eric asked to be impaled on spears that raised him above the dead and his wish was granted.

In Zealand, his mother Aslaug and his brothers Björn Ironside and Hvitserk, who had been playing tafl, become upset and sail to Sweden with a large army. Aslaug, calling herself Randalin rides with cavalry across the land.

The battle ended with Eysteinn&#x27;s death. When Ragnar died, Björn Ironside became the king of Sweden.

==&quot;Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s saga&quot;==
&quot;Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s saga&quot; tells that Eysteinn was the king of Sweden and a good friend of Ragnar Lodbrok. Eysteinn had the most beautiful daughter named Ingeborg. He was also a devout pagan and there were so many blóts at Uppsala that no other place had ever been its equal. The Swedes worshiped a holy cow named Sibilja, and when the Swedes were attacked by enemies, they had the cow walk in front of the battle formation. The cow&#x27;s magic was so great that when she began to bellow, the enemies began to fight between themselves.

When Ragnar Lodbrok was visiting Eysteinn at Uppsala, Eysteinn suggested that Ragnar marry Ingeborg and have her as wife instead of the pauper Aslaug (Kraka). Ragnar consequently betrothed himself to Ingeborg. Eventually, Aslaug found out from three small birds, and told Ragnar that she was no pauper. She was the daughter of Sigurd and Brynhild. As Ragnar understood that Kraka was of better descent than that of Ingeborg, he decided not to go back to Sweden and wed Eysteinn&#x27;s daughter.

Eysteinn was upset with Ragnar&#x27;s change of plans and declared that their friendship was no more. This was interesting news to Ragnar&#x27;s sons Eric and Agnar who decided to go to Sweden and pillage, as their father would not mind anymore.

Eysteinn sent the fiery cross in all directions and assembled the Swedish leidang. They also made Sibilja join the army, but they had to blót considerably to make her obey. When they had arrived at the location where Eric and Agnar were camped, Eysteinn ordered one third of the Swedish army to attack Eric and Ragnar&#x27;s men, while the others would attack from all directions after the battle had begun. This was done and Sibilja began to bellow. Eric and Agnar&#x27;s warriors began to fight between themselves and eventually Agnar died and Eric was taken captive. Eric was offered both peace and Ingeborg but Eric wanted the Swedes to stick spears into the ground and throw him on top of them so that he would die.

When Aslaug heard the news of Eric and Agnar&#x27;s death, she cried blood, and asked Ragnar&#x27;s sons to avenge their dead brothers. Ivar the Boneless was afraid of the magic that ruled in Sweden, but when his little brother, the only three year old Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye wanted to attack Eysteinn, the brothers changed their minds.

Sigurd&#x27;s foster-father assembled five longships for him. Hvitserk and Björn Ironside mustered fourteen, while Aslaug and Ivar the Boneless marshalled ten ships each. Ivar would not allow his mother Aslaug to go by sea, but she could join the army of riders that would go across land. She accepted and changed her name to Randalin.

When the armies met in battle, Ivar told everyone to make such a din that the bellowing from Sibilja could not be heard. This was of no use, however, and so Ivar shot two arrows in each of Sibilja&#x27;s eyes. However, the cow could not be stopped. Then Ivar asked his men to throw him on top of the cow. Ivar made himself so heavy as he landed on the cow, that she was crushed.

The Swedish leidang was beaten and Eysteinn fell. Ragnar&#x27;s sons commanded that their brother had been avenged and that the Swedes should be spared pillaging.

==&quot;Hervarar saga&quot;==
The &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; tells that Eysteinn Beli was the son of Harald Wartooth. &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; made Harald Wartooth the king of Sweden and Sigurd Hring the king of Denmark, while other sources have it the other way round. It tells that Eysteinn inherited Sweden from his father Harald Wartooth and ruled it until he was killed by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, as told in &quot;Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s saga&quot;. When Ragnar died, Björn Ironside became the king of Sweden.

==&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==
The &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (book 9) by Saxo Grammaticus also mentions Eysteinn, but only in passing. It says that Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s son Agnar learnt that his brother Eric had been slain by Osten, the king of Sweden. He wished to avenge his brother but died in the battle.

==&quot;Skáldatal&quot;==
&quot;Skáldatal&quot; says that Eysteinn Beli was the patron of many skalds, including Bragi inn gamli, Grundi prúði, Erpr lútandi, Kálfr þrænzki, Refr ryzki, Ormr oframi, two named Ölvaldi, Ávaldi, Fleinn skáld and Rögnvaldr skáld.

<text>Giudecca (; ) is an island in the Venetian Lagoon, in northern Italy. It is part of the &quot;sestiere&quot; of Dorsoduro and is a locality of the &quot;comune&quot; of Venice.

==Geography==
Giudecca lies immediately south of the central islands of Venice, from which it is separated by the Giudecca Canal. San Giorgio Maggiore lies off its eastern tip.

==History==
Giudecca was known in ancient times as the &quot;Spinalunga&quot; (meaning &quot;Long Thorn&quot;). The name &quot;Giudecca&quot; may represent a corruption of the Latin &quot;Judaica&quot; (&quot;Judaean&quot;) and so may be translated as &quot;the Jewry&quot;: a number of towns in Southern Italy and Sicily have Jewish quarters named Giudecca or Judeca. Venice historian John Julius Norwich writes in the 1989 edition of his book, &quot;A History of Venice&quot;: “…by the middle of the thirteenth century there was already a considerable Jewish population in the city and its immediate neighborhood—perhaps 3,000 or more. Many lived at Mestre, on the mainland; others —particularly those who had mercantile dealings with Dalmatia—occupied the island of Spinalunga and were in fact responsible for its change of name to Giudecca.” However, the term &quot;Giudecca&quot; was not generally used to denote the Jewish quarters of towns in northern Italy.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1516 that the first segregated Jewish quarter in Europe, called the New Foundry, or &quot;Ghetto Nuovo,&quot; was established in the Cannaregio district in Venice. Jews were required to live in a confined area and were subject to various restrictions. The term &quot;ghetto&quot; itself originated from this Venetian district.

Giudecca was historically an area of large palaces with gardens, the island became an industrial area in the early 20th century with shipyards and factories, and a film studio. Much of the industry went into decline after World War II, but it is now once more regarded as a quiet residential area of largely working-class housing with some chic apartments and exclusive houses. It is known for its long dock and its churches, including the Palladio-designed Il Redentore. The island was the home of a huge flour mill, the Molino Stucky, which has been converted into a luxury hotel and apartment complex. At the other end of Giudecca is the famous five-star Cipriani hotel with large private gardens and salt-water pool.

===Resort town===
Modern renovations of some antique architecture in Giudecca have bolstered the island&#x27;s reputation as a vacation locale. In 2011, Venetian developers reopened the lodgings of a prominent 16th-century mansion as long-term rentals under the name &quot;Villa F.&quot;

<text>(; ) is a cemetery located in the Gamla Enskede district south of central Stockholm, Sweden. It was inaugurated in 1920 and was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1994. Its design, by Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz, reflects the development of architecture from Nordic Classicism to mature functionalism.

==History==


Skogskyrkogården came about following an international competition in 1915 for the design of a new cemetery in Enskede in the southern part of Stockholm, Sweden. The entry called &quot;Tallum&quot; by the young architects Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz was selected. After changes made to the design on the recommendations of the competition jury, work began in 1917 on land that had been old gravel quarries that were overgrown with pine trees, and the first phase was completed three years later. The architects&#x27; use of the natural landscape created an extraordinary environment of tranquil beauty that had a profound influence on cemetery design throughout the world. Essential models for the design of the cemetery were the German forest cemeteries of Friedhof Ohlsdorf at Hamburg and Waldfriedhof in Munich but also the neoclassical paintings of Caspar David Friedrich.

The basis for the route through the cemetery is a long route leading from the ornamental colonnaded entrance that then splits, one way leading through a pastoral landscape, complete with a large pond and a tree-lined meditation hill, and the other up to a large detached granite cross and the abstract portico of the crematorium and the chapels of the Holy Cross, Faith, and Hope. The paths then rejoin and pass along a dead-straight path through a dense grove of tall pine trees, the so-called Way of Seven Wells, leading to the &quot;Uppståndelsekapellet&quot; or Resurrection Chapel. The giant dark granite cross at the focus of the vista from the main entrance has also been described as having been based on a painting by Caspar David Friedrich, titled &quot;Cross on the Baltic Sea&quot; (1815), signifying hope in an abandoned world; yet Asplund and Lewerentz insisted that the cross was open to non-Christian interpretations, even quoting Friedrich: &quot;To those who see it as such, a consolation, to those who do not, simply a cross.&quot;

The architects designed the entire complex, from the landscape to the smallest lamp, though there are also integrated sculptures by Carl Milles. Lewerentz&#x27;s contribution mainly concerned the landscape but also the main entrance and the classical &quot;Uppståndelsekapellet&quot; or Resurrection Chapel, which was built in 1925. Asplund devoted himself mainly to the buildings, and the small Woodland Crematorium – built in 1935–40 – has been regarded as a central work in his oeuvre as well as the Nordic Classicism style of that period. The small chapel, set on a Tuscan peristyle and featuring a gold statue on the roof by Carl Milles, was in fact derived from a &quot;primitive hut&quot; that Asplund had happened to see in a garden at Liselund. The crematorium, with its Faith, Hope, and Holy Cross Chapels, was Asplund&#x27;s final work of architecture, designed in a rational modernist style typical for his later work, opened shortly before his death in 1940.

In 1994, Skogskyrkogården was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site and although it does not have the number of famous interments as the Norra begravningsplatsen, its much older counterpart in northern Stockholm, it is a major tourist attraction. At the Tallum Pavilion (a building designed originally by Asplund as staff facilities), visitors can see an exhibition about the cemetery and the story of its origins and the two architects whose vision created it.

With its 100,000 graves, the cemetery is the largest in the country, in terms of the number of graves, and the second largest (after Kviberg&#x27;s cemetery) in terms of area. Skogskyrkogården is connected to a metro station by the same name (see Skogskyrkogården metro station).

<text>Ginny Hasselfield is a Canadian politician, and was the leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party between 1996 and 1998. A former Manitoba teacher and principal, she was also president and co-founder of Cross Cultural Communications International Inc. a company that provided diversity training and education throughout Canada. In 1995, she was awarded the Manitoba YM/YWCA Woman of Distinction award.

Although Hasselfield had never run for provincial office, she was known in Manitoba as a prominent organizer for the Liberal Party and was supported by the party&#x27;s establishment against Kevin Lamoureux, a maverick MLA from north-end Winnipeg.

Hasselfield and Lamoureux had a very poor personal relationship during the 1996 leadership contest. The voting was determined by a &quot;weighted&quot; balloting process (i.e. every party member could vote in his/her home constituency, and the votes from each constituency were averaged out to provide an equal number of &quot;points&quot; for the total). Lamoureux received more membership votes, but the concentration of his support in north Winnipeg meant that Hasselfield was able to attain a 21-point victory.

After the federal election of 1997, Lamoureux and Gary Kowalski left the Liberal caucus to sit as &quot;Independent Liberals&quot; (this left Neil Gaudry as the only official Liberal MLA in the Manitoba legislature). With the party&#x27;s internal organization crumbing, Hasselfield was persuaded to stand down as party leader on February 4, 1998. While she never stood for election to the legislature, she was leader during one by-election in Portage la Prairie.

Hasselfield later moved to British Columbia, and continued her active involvement in the Liberal Party of Canada. Her roles included chairing the Federal Liberal President&#x27;s Council of British Columbia and co-chair of the Liberal Laurier Club. In 2006, she was appointed a Director of the Fraser River Port Authority and was involved in developing plans that eventually amalgamated the Port of Vancouver with the North and South Fraser ports. She is currently on the Board of the South Coast British Columbia Transit Police Authority.

<doc id="895763" wikidata="Q356814" url="?curid=895763" title="Kasey Keller">
<text>Kasey C. Keller (born November 29, 1969) is an American former professional soccer player who played in Europe and the United States, and was the starting goalkeeper for the U.S. national team. He is a four-time FIFA World Cup participant and was the first American goalkeeper to become a regular in the German Bundesliga, the English Premier League, and the Spanish La Liga.

Keller retired after three seasons with Seattle Sounders FC after they joined Major League Soccer. He was the Sounders&#x27; color commentator in local television broadcasts from 2012 to 2022, and assistant coach for Newport High School Boys Soccer in Bellevue, Washington. He also frequently appears on ESPN FC.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Keller was born in Olympia, Washington. He attended North Thurston High School and played college soccer at the University of Portland under Clive Charles. As a freshman in 1988, he helped lead the team to the NCAA men&#x27;s soccer final four. He earned first team All American as a senior and was the 1991 Adidas Goalkeeper of the Year. During the 1989 college off-season, he played for the Portland Timbers of the Western Soccer Alliance. His outstanding play led to his selection as league MVP that year. In 10 games, he allowed only four goals, for a 0.38 goals-against-average and eight clean sheets.

In 1989, he split his time between the Portland Timbers and the U.S. U-20 national team, which finished fourth at the 1989 FIFA U-20 World Cup. Keller once again excelled and was awarded the tournament&#x27;s Silver Ball as the tournament&#x27;s second-best player.

===Millwall===
After being a member of the U.S. national team in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, he was signed by the English club Millwall, playing there and becoming a fan favorite between 1992 and 1996. Keller made his Millwall debut on May 2, 1992, and played his last game on May 5, 1996, making 202 overall appearances for The Lions. Keller was voted &quot;Player of The Year&quot; 1992–93 by the Lions fans and also picked up the &quot;Junior Lions&quot; and &quot;Disabled Millwall Fans&quot;&#x27; awards. When Millwall were relegated to the Second Division, the team transferred Keller to Leicester City for £900,000 on August 15, 1996.

Keller was still studying for a sociology degree by correspondence when he played for Millwall, and wrote a paper on the club&#x27;s hooligans.

===Leicester City===
In his first year with Leicester City, Keller played a vital part in the team&#x27;s success in both a strong league position and winning the 1997 League Cup. The team reached the final again in 1999; a last minute goal lost them the match. That summer, he left the club for Spain on a free transfer.

===Rayo Vallecano===
Keller signed with the newly promoted Spanish club Rayo Vallecano for the 1999–2000 season and played there for two years.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
In August 2001, Keller returned to England and the Premier League, joining Tottenham Hotspur on a free transfer. Relegated to backup duty for Neil Sullivan early on, he won the starting spot and played every minute for Spurs in both the 2002–03 and the 2003–04 seasons.

In the 2004–05 Premiership season, Keller fell out of favor at Tottenham, as Paul Robinson became the first-choice keeper. In November 2004, Kasey was loaned out to Southampton, a Premiership club ravaged by injuries to its goalkeepers, for one month.

===Borussia Mönchengladbach===

On January 15, 2005, Keller joined German Bundesliga side Borussia Mönchengladbach on a free transfer during the Bundesliga&#x27;s winter break. He got off to a good start in the Bundesliga, keeping a clean sheet in his first appearance for Borussia. Keller played every minute in the second half of the season and kept a total of seven clean sheets in that period, playing an important role in saving the club from relegation.

Keller also lived in Haus Donk, a castle in Tönisvorst, near Mönchengladbach. During the 2006–07 season he was one of the two Bundesliga players to be hobby-columnists for &quot;RUND&quot;, a German soccer magazine published monthly, reflecting his life in Germany and his Bundesliga career within those lines. He shared that role with VfB Stuttgart&#x27;s shot-stopper Timo Hildebrand.

On August 10, 2006, Keller was selected by his teammates to captain club side Borussia Mönchengladbach during the 2006–07 campaign. He is the second American (after Claudio Reyna) to captain a top-level German club.

===Fulham===
In August 2007, Keller returned to the Premier League, signing for Fulham. The length of Keller&#x27;s contract and financial details were not disclosed by the club. He was bought as a backup to goalkeeper Antti Niemi, but nagging injuries to Niemi saw him take over as principal goalkeeper at Fulham. However, the day before the Premier League match against Derby County in October, Keller injured his arm in training and was on the sidelines until late January. He returned as a substitute keeper in the 2–1 win over Aston Villa on February 3. From then on he was only second choice until Fulham&#x27;s match against Blackburn where he started the game, with Niemi on the bench. He then went on to start Fulham&#x27;s remaining games as they defied all odds and avoided relegation on the last day of the season with a 1–0 win over Portsmouth at Fratton Park.

===Seattle Sounders FC===

On August 14, 2008, Keller returned to the United States to sign with the 2009 MLS expansion team Seattle Sounders FC. He was the starting goalkeeper for the MLS team&#x27;s first-ever match, on 19 March 2009, which the Sounders won 3–0. He continued to have a clean sheet in each of his next three starts, with a score of 2–0 per start. He also set the record for most minutes without a goal to start a season in MLS history. His clean sheet streak came to an end on 2 May 2009, at 457 minutes in the second half of a game against the Chicago Fire FC. He started in every match of the 2009 U.S. Open Cup, as the Sounders won the title after beating D.C. United in the final on 2 September 2009, thus becoming the second expansion team in MLS history to win the tournament in their inaugural season. Keller was then named TheCup.us Player of the Tournament. On 3 October, Keller recorded his 10th clean-sheet in a 1–0 over Columbus Crew to end the Crew&#x27;s 22-game home unbeaten streak.

In the 2010 season, the 40-year-old Keller was the only Sounders FC player to have started every league match (32) in regular season and playoffs, logging a total of 3585 in all competitions. On 27 June, he recorded a season-high nine saves in a 1–3 loss to Philadelphia Union, and three days later, he made two stops in a penalty shootout against Portland Timbers in the round of 16 of the 2010 U.S. Open Cup. On 8 August, Keller recorded his first MLS assist with a long pass to Fredy Montero&#x27;s opening goal in an eventual 2–0 win over Houston Dynamo, thus becoming the first Sounders goalkeeper to show up on the score sheet, and at the age of 40, one of the oldest player to register a goal contribution in MLS history. On 9 September, Keller saved a first-half penalty in a goalless draw with Real Salt Lake. On 5 October, Keller won his second U.S. Open Cup title after helping his side beat Columbus Crew 2–1 in the final in front of 31,311, the largest crowd to witness a US Open Cup final; Seattle thus become the first MLS club to successfully defend the Open Cup title and the first club overall to repeat since the New York Pancyprian-Freedoms did so in 1982 and 1983. He ended the 2010 season with 11 clean-sheets, thus surpassing his 2009 total. He won MLS Save of the Year for his stop against Kansas City Wizards on 17 April and six of his 82 saves were voted MLS Save of the Week.

In the 2011 MLS season, the 41-year-old Keller finished third in the MLS saves leader with 110. On 4 October, Keller started in his third consecutive Open Cup final, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 win over the Chicago Fire in front of 35,615, the largest crowd to witness a US Open Cup final, and in doing so at the age of 41 years and 306 days, he became the oldest player in the competition&#x27;s history at the time, a record that has since been surpassed by Marcus Hahnemann in 2014 and Claudio Muñoz in 2024. He played his final regular season home game for the Sounders on 15 October 2011, helping his side to a 2–1 win over the San Jose Earthquakes in front of a record crowd of 64,140 people were present. In the following week, on 22 October, Keller played his last match for the club in a 3–1 win over Chivas USA, and in doing so at the age of 41 years and 324 days, he became the third oldest player in the history of the MLS, only behind Preki (42) and Pat Onstad (43).

==International career==
Keller got his first senior team cap against Colombia on February 4, 1990, and was on the roster as Tony Meola&#x27;s back up at the 1990 FIFA World Cup.

After being ignored by U.S. coach Bora Milutinović for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, he made Steve Sampson&#x27;s ill-fated squad in 1998, and played two games at the World Cup. Keller was an overage selection for the 1996 Olympics team, starting all three matches.

Keller was named U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year an unprecedented three times, in 1997 and 1999, and again in 2005.

Perhaps his most famous clean sheet came in the historic 1998 win versus Brazil. Keller played all 90 minutes in goal and made ten saves, many from point-blank range, in preserving the 1–0 shutout victory for the U.S. His performance in goal prompted Brazilian great Romário to remark &quot;That is the best performance by a goalkeeper I have ever seen,&quot; the performance was commemorated in the song &quot;Kasey Keller&quot; by synth-pop band Barcelona.

For most of their careers, Keller and Brad Friedel were engaged in a head-to-head battle for the U.S. goalkeeper&#x27;s jersey. Keller got the nod in 1998 but was second choice to Friedel in the 2002 FIFA World Cup. In spite of this stiff competition he has the second most caps and wins of any men&#x27;s goalkeeper in U.S. soccer history with 102 and 53, respectively, behind Tim Howard. Keller remains the team&#x27;s all-time leader in keeping clean sheets with 47.

Keller crowned the U.S.&#x27;s run in the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament with a clean sheet in the final match against Panama and two saves in the penalty shootout to give the side the trophy. Keller started the first seven games of the final round of World Cup qualifying in 2005, recording five consecutive clean sheets and 507 consecutive goalless minutes to lead the U.S. to qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Finals in Germany. He then became the first male player in U.S. history to win his third Athlete of the Year award. On May 2, 2006, Keller and teammate Claudio Reyna became the first two American men named to four World Cup Rosters. In that World Cup, he played in all three games, being named Man of the Match in the 1–1 draw with Italy in Kaiserslautern on June 17, 2006. Keller is the only U.S. player to participate in both the 1990 and 2006 World Cups.

==Broadcasting career==

Keller joined the Seattle Sounders FC broadcast team as a color commentator alongside play-by-play announcer Ross Fletcher in 2012. He remained with the club through the 2022 season, when Apple TV&#x27;s MLS Season Pass took over from local broadcasters. Keller also worked on ESPN broadcasts as a color commentator and studio analyst for various international tournaments and ESPN FC programs.

==Personal life==
Keller resides in Seattle with his wife Kristin and their two children, twins born on August 26, 1997. Keller has lived in London, Madrid, and Germany, where he and his family lived in a 1,000-year-old castle.
During his time abroad, Keller has learned to speak German and Spanish fluently. He told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that he turned down offers from several European clubs to sign with Seattle for the sake of his children, who have attended a new school with every transfer he has made.

A street adjacent to Keller&#x27;s alma mater, North Thurston High School in Olympia, Washington, was renamed to &quot;Kasey Keller Drive&quot; in the 2000s.

In April 2016, Keller and his former USMNT goalkeeper teammate Marcus Hahnemann became coaches of the boys&#x27; soccer team at Newport High School in Bellevue, Washington.

<doc id="895766" wikidata="Q482427" url="?curid=895766" title="An Essay on Criticism">
<text>An Essay on Criticism is one of the first major poems written by the English writer Alexander Pope (1688–1744), published in 1711. It is the source of the famous quotations &quot;To err is human; to forgive, divine&quot;, &quot;A little learning is a dang&#x27;rous thing&quot; (frequently misquoted as &quot;A little knowledge is a dang&#x27;rous thing&quot;), and &quot;Fools rush in where angels fear to tread&quot;.

== Composition ==

The first fragmentary drafts of the work were written in Abberley in 1707. It was first published in May 1711. Many of the poem&#x27;s ideas had existed in prose form since at least 1706. Composed in heroic couplets (pairs of adjacent rhyming lines of iambic pentameter) and written in the Horatian mode of satire, it is a verse essay primarily concerned with how writers and critics behave in the new literary commerce of Pope&#x27;s contemporary age. The poem covers a range of good criticism and advice, and represents many of the chief literary ideals of Pope&#x27;s age.

==Structure and themes==
The verse &quot;essay&quot; was not an uncommon form in eighteenth-century poetry, deriving ultimately from classical forebears including Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ars Poetica&quot; and Lucretius&#x27; &quot;De rerum natura&quot;.

Pope contends in the poem&#x27;s opening couplets that bad criticism does greater harm than bad writing:
Pope delineates common faults of poets, e.g., settling for easy and clichéd rhymes:

Throughout the poem, Pope refers to ancient writers such as Virgil, Homer, Aristotle, Horace and Longinus. This is a testament to his belief that the &quot;Imitation of the ancients&quot; is the ultimate standard for taste. Pope also says, &quot;True Ease in Writing comes from Art, not Chance,/ As those move easiest who have learn&#x27;d to dance&quot; (362–363), meaning poets are made, not born.

As is usual in Pope&#x27;s poems, the &quot;Essay&quot; concludes with a reference to Pope himself. William Walsh, the last of the critics mentioned, was a mentor and friend of Pope who had died in 1708.

Part II of &quot;An Essay on Criticism&quot; includes a famous couplet:
This is in reference to the spring in the Pierian Mountains in Macedonia, sacred to the Muses. The first line of this couplet is often misquoted as &quot;a little &quot;knowledge&quot; is a dangerous thing&quot;.

The &quot;Essay&quot; also gives this famous line (towards the end of Part II):
The phrase &quot;fools rush in where angels fear to tread&quot; from Part III (line 625) has become part of the popular lexicon, and has been used for and in various works.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;An Essay on Criticism&quot; was famously and fiercely attacked by John Dennis, who is mentioned mockingly in the work. Consequently, Dennis also appears in Pope&#x27;s later satire, &quot;The Dunciad&quot;.

Thomas Rymer and Jonathan Swift were among other critics: Rymer, who had the strongest critique said, &quot;till of late years England was as free from critics as it is from wolves...they who are least acquainted with the game are aptest to bark at everything that comes in their way.&quot;; Swift&#x27;s statement concentrated on critics who were damned &quot;as barbarous as a judge who should take up a resolution to hang all men that came before him upon trial.&quot;

For her roles on Broadway, she received two other nominations for &quot;Mary Stuart&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Bernhardt/Hamlet&quot; in 2019.

McTeer has also gained acclaim for her film roles, having received two Academy Award nominations, one for Best Actress for &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot; in 1999, and the other for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; in 2011. Other roles include &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1992), &quot;Carrington&quot; (1995), &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; (1998), &quot;Songcatcher&quot; (2000), &quot;As You Like It&quot; (2006), &quot;The Divergent Series&quot; (2015–2016), and &quot;The Menu&quot; (2022). 

On television, she starred in the title role of Lynda La Plante&#x27;s &quot;The Governor&quot; (1995–1996), and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for her portrayal of Clementine Churchill in the HBO film &quot;Into the Storm&quot; (2009). She is also known for her roles in &quot;Damages&quot; (2012), &quot;The White Queen&quot; (2013), &quot;The Honourable Woman&quot; (2014), &quot;Jessica Jones&quot; (2018), &quot;Sorry for Your Loss&quot; (2018–2019), and &quot;Ozark&quot; (2018–2020).

==Early life and education ==
Janet McTeer was born on 5 August 1961 in Wallsend, Newcastle upon Tyne, England, and spent her childhood in York. 

She attended the now defunct Queen Anne Grammar School for Girls, and worked at the Old Starre Inn, at York Minster and at the city&#x27;s Theatre Royal. She performed locally with the Rowntree Players at Joseph Rowntree Theatre, then trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).

==Career==
McTeer began a successful theatrical career with the Royal Exchange Theatre after graduating from RADA.
===Early roles===
McTeer&#x27;s television work includes the BBC production &quot;Portrait of a Marriage&quot;, an adaptation of Nigel Nicolson&#x27;s biography of the same name in which she played Vita Sackville-West, and the popular ITV series &quot;The Governor&quot; written by Lynda La Plante. She made her screen debut in &quot;Half Moon Street&quot;, a 1986 film based on a novel by Paul Theroux. In 1991, she appeared in Catherine Cookson&#x27;s &quot;The Black Velvet Gown&quot;, with Bob Peck and Geraldine Somerville; this won the International Emmy award for best drama. She appeared in the 1992 film version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (co-starring Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes) and the 1995 film &quot;Carrington&quot; (which starred Emma Thompson and Jonathan Pryce) as Vanessa Bell. 

In 1996, McTeer garnered critical acclaim – and both the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award and Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Award – for her performance as Nora in a West End production of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. The following year, the production transferred to Broadway, and McTeer received a Tony Award, a Theatre World Award, and the Drama Desk Award for Best Actress in a Play.

During the show&#x27;s run, McTeer was interviewed by Charlie Rose on his PBS talk show, where she was seen by American filmmaker Gavin O&#x27;Connor, who, at the time, was working on a screenplay about a single mother&#x27;s cross-country wanderings with her pre-teenage daughter. He was determined that she star in the film. When prospective backers balked at her relative anonymity in the US, he produced the film himself. &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot; proved to be a 1999 Sundance Film Festival favourite, and McTeer&#x27;s performance won her a Golden Globe as Best Actress and Academy Award and Screen Actors Guild nominations in the same category.

===2000s===
McTeer&#x27;s screen credits include &quot;Songcatcher&quot; (with Aidan Quinn), &quot;Waking the Dead&quot; (with Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly), the dogme film &quot;The King Is Alive&quot; (with Jennifer Jason Leigh), &quot;The Intended&quot; (with Brenda Fricker and Olympia Dukakis), and &quot;Tideland&quot;, written and directed by Terry Gilliam. She also starred in the BBC dramatisation of Mary Webb&#x27;s &quot;Precious Bane in 1989&quot;. She has appeared in such British television serials as &quot;The Amazing Mrs Pritchard&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, and Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Marple&quot; (episode: &quot;The Murder at the Vicarage&quot;).

McTeer played Mary, Queen of Scots in &quot;Mary Stuart&quot;, a play by Friedrich Schiller in a new version by Peter Oswald, directed by Phyllida Lloyd. She acted opposite Harriet Walter as Queen Elizabeth I in London&#x27;s West End in 2005, a role she reprised in the 2009 Broadway transfer. McTeer received a Tony Award nomination for her role in &quot;Mary Stuart&quot;, and won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play. 

In 2008, she starred in &quot;God of Carnage&quot; in the West End alongside Tamsin Greig, Ken Stott and Ralph Fiennes, at the Gielgud Theatre. She reprised her role on Broadway opposite Jeff Daniels from March to June 2010.

In 2009, she portrayed Clementine Churchill in the HBO feature &quot;Into the Storm&quot; about Sir Winston Churchill&#x27;s years as Britain&#x27;s leader during World War II.

===2010s===
In 2011, McTeer starred alongside Glenn Close in &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; and with Daniel Radcliffe and Ciarán Hinds in &quot;The Woman in Black&quot; (based on the 1983 novel of the same name). Her role as Hubert Page in &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; won McTeer critical acclaim and numerous award nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. It was announced in November 2011 that McTeer had joined the cast of &quot;Damages&quot; (in the character of Kate Franklin) for its fifth and final season, reuniting her with her &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; co-star Glenn Close. This was her first American television series. She played American novelist Mary McCarthy in Margarethe von Trotta&#x27;s film &quot;Hannah Arendt&quot;.

In 2013 McTeer was cast as Jacquetta of Luxembourg, the mother of the title character in &quot;The White Queen&quot;, a British television drama series based on Philippa Gregory&#x27;s best-selling historical novel series &quot;The Cousins&#x27; War&quot;. Her performance was applauded, with Sam Wollaston of &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggesting she stole the show. In December 2013, McTeer was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Jacquetta.

On 29 July 2013, it was announced that McTeer had joined the cast of &quot;The Honourable Woman&quot;, a BBC spy-thriller miniseries starring Maggie Gyllenhaal. In 2015, McTeer starred as Commander Kim Guziewicz in CBS comedy-drama &quot;Battle Creek&quot;, and filmed &quot;Exception&quot; based on &quot;The Kaiser&#x27;s Last Kiss&quot; (in which she was due to portray Princess Hermine Reuss of Greiz), set for a 2016 release. 

In 2016, McTeer played Petruchio in the New York Public Theater Shakespeare in the Park all-female production of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, directed again by Phyllida Lloyd. She co-starred alongside Liev Schreiber in &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot; on Broadway, with McTeer cast as Marquise de Merteuil. The play ran from October 2016 to January 2017.

In 2018, she played Alisa Jones in the Marvel Television and Netflix production &quot;Jessica Jones&quot;. In September 2018, she took on the role of Sarah Bernhardt in Theresa Rebeck&#x27;s Broadway play &quot;Bernhardt/Hamlet&quot;. She was nominated for the 2019 Tony Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Play.

McTeer portrayed cartel attorney Helen Pierce on the Netflix crime drama &quot;Ozark&quot;.

===2020s===
In early 2023, McTeer appeared at London&#x27;s National Theatre in a new play &quot;Phaedra&quot;. Director playwright Simon Stone turned the Greek myth of the woman falling in love with her stepson into a satire about London elitism and post-Brexit Britain. Despite a strong cast that included French actor Assaad Bouab, Canadian screen star Mackenzie Davis, and a superb lead performance from McTeer, the play received mixed reviews. The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; called it &quot;A must-see show. A high-spec, richly-textured chamber extravaganza&quot;, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote &quot;Even McTeer&#x27;s strong performance cannot save a tonally unsure play&quot;. McTeer garnered a Best Actress nomination at the 2023 Olivier Awards, losing to Jodie Comer for &quot;Prima Facie&quot;. She will also be starring in , due for debut in 2025.

==Honours==
McTeer was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

==Personal life==
McTeer has been married to poet and fashion consultant Joseph Coleman since 2010. They reside in Maine.

<text>John Owen &quot;Chief&quot; Wilson (August 21, 1883 – February 22, 1954) was an American professional baseball right fielder. He played in Major League Baseball from 1908 to 1916 for the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals.

Wilson played minor league baseball for three teams until the end of 1907, when he signed with the Pirates. After spending six seasons with the organization, he was traded to the Cardinals, where he spent the last three seasons of his major league career. Wilson is best known for setting the single-season record for triples in with 36, a record that still stands.

==Early life==
Wilson was born on August 21, 1883, in Austin, Texas. He grew up at a ranch owned by his family located approximately 50 miles north of Austin in Bertram. Wilson started his baseball career playing on several teams in independent leagues, before joining the Austin Senators in 1905. He was known for his introverted nature; his Pirates teammate and roommate Bobby Byrne recounted how Wilson &quot;wouldn&#x27;t say two words all day.&quot;

Contrary to popular belief, Wilson was not of Native American descent. He was nicknamed &quot;Chief&quot; because his Pittsburgh teammates and manager Fred Clarke thought Wilson, a native Texan who stood , resembled a &quot;Chief of the Texas Rangers.&quot;

==Professional baseball career==

===Minor leagues===
In , Wilson signed with the Austin Senators, a minor league baseball team in the Texas League. However, the team disbanded in the middle of the season on June 6, and Wilson joined the Fort Worth Panthers, playing for them until he was promoted to the Des Moines Champs of the Western League in . He performed well, posting a batting average of .323 in 56 games. It was during his first (and only) season with the Champs that Wilson was spotted by Denver Grizzlies pitcher Babe Adams, who had signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates at the end of 1907. Adams informed Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss of Wilson&#x27;s &quot;tremendous arm&quot; and his ability &quot;not only as a hitter but as a fielder.&quot; This prompted Dreyfuss to sign Wilson to the Pirates as their right fielder.

===Pittsburgh Pirates (1908–1913)===

Wilson made his major league debut for the Pirates on April 15, 1908, at the age of 24, in a 3–1 Opening Day win against the St. Louis Cardinals. During his rookie season, Wilson had a relatively disappointing year, batting .227, slugging .285 and finishing sixth in the National League (NL) in strikeouts with 66. Out of his 120 hits that season, only 18 were extra base hits. As a result of his offensive woes, Pirates fans booed him on a constant basis. Wilson greatly improved his batting in the following season, raising his batting average to .272, playing all 154 games of the season and finishing fifth in the NL in triples with 12. This success culminated in the Pirates winning the World Series at the conclusion of that season. In the Opening Day game of the season, Wilson got injured and had to sit out for seven games, with Vin Campbell taking his place in the lineup. On July 3, against the Cincinnati Reds, he hit for the cycle. He finished the season with similar statistics as the previous year, batting .276 and hitting 13 triples.

The season was a breakout year for Wilson. He posted a batting average of .300, finished third in the NL in doubles (34), fifth in home runs (12) and sixth in slugging (.472) and drove in 107 runs batted in (RBI), thus becoming the league&#x27;s RBI champion. The 12 home runs he hit that season marked a Pirates team record he held until .

In , Wilson recorded the same batting average as the year before and finished second in the league in slugging (.513) and games played (152), third in home runs (11), fourth in RBI (95) and seventh in hits (175). Furthermore, he set the MLB single-season record for triples, hitting 36 in total that year. However, his record received almost no press coverage. Baseball sportswriter Ernest Lanigan suggested that this was because a record book erroneously attributed Nap Lajoie with having 44 triples in , when he hit only 11 that year. As a result, several newspapers – most notably &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; – were under the belief that Lajoie held the record.

Wilson&#x27;s record still stands today and is currently the third oldest single-season record, behind Lajoie&#x27;s .426 batting average in 1901 and Jack Chesbro&#x27;s 41 wins in 1904. It is considered one of baseball&#x27;s most unbreakable records, as only Sam Crawford (1914) and Kiki Cuyler (1925) have come the closest to breaking the record; both players hit 26 triples. Wilson&#x27;s record also accounted for part of the 129 triples amassed by the Pirates that year, setting a single-season record for most triples by a team since 1900. Due to his stellar and record-breaking performance, Wilson finished eighth in that season&#x27;s voting for the Chalmers Award, the precursor to the MLB Most Valuable Player Award.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1914–1916)===
Wilson finished his career playing three seasons for the Cardinals. He played his last MLB game on October 1, 1916.

==Later life==
After he retired from baseball, Wilson returned to his family ranch in Bertram, where he became a stock farmer and held various positions in service to the community. He died on October 24, 1954, at the age of 70 and was interred at Austin Memorial Park. On March 31, 2007, the Bertram Little League Sports Complex was dedicated to and named after Wilson.

<text>Michel Félix Dunal (24 October 1789 in Montpellier – 29 July 1856 in Montpellier) was a French botanist. He was a professor of botany in Montpellier, France.

He held the chair of natural history at the University of Montpellier from 1816 until his death in 1856. The Solanaceous plant genus &quot;Dunalia&quot; is named after him.

He is especially known for his work with the genus &quot;Solanum&quot;, and published an important work on the genus; &quot;Solanorum generumque affinium Synopsis seu Solanorum Historiae, editionis secundae summarium ad characteres differentiales redactum, seriem naturalem, habitationes stationesque specierum breviter indicans&quot;, Montpellier, 1816.

For the work &quot;Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis&quot; by Augustin de Candolle and his son, Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle, he contributed to Volume I of 1824 &quot;Cistineae&quot; (modern Cistaceae), to Volume VII, No. 2 of 1839 &quot;Vaccinieae&quot;, and to Volume XIII No. 1 of 1852 &quot;Solanaceae&quot;. Its publication in 1852 was the last taxonomic treatment of the genus &quot;Solanum&quot; in its entirety. This also includes a first attempt to divide the species of &quot;Solanum&quot; into sections. Starting points were morphological features such as the shape of the anthers and the presence or absence of spines.


==Honours==
The genus name of &quot;Dunalia&quot; (5 species of plant found in South America) is in honour of Dunal, the genus was published in F.W.H.von Humboldt, A.J.A.Bonpland &amp; C.S.Kunth, Nov. Gen. Sp. Vol.3 on page 55 in 1818.

<text>Jury tampering is the crime of unduly attempting to influence the composition or decisions of a jury during the course of a trial. The means by which this crime could be perpetrated can include attempting to discredit potential jurors to ensure they will not be selected for duty. Once selected, jurors could be bribed or intimidated to act in a certain manner on duty. It could also involve making unauthorized contact with them for the purpose of introducing prohibited outside information and then arguing for a mistrial. In the United States, people have also been charged with jury tampering for handing out pamphlets and flyers indicating that jurors have certain rights and obligations, including an obligation to vote their conscience notwithstanding the instructions they are given by the judge.

==Ireland==
In Ireland, the Special Criminal Court is a three-judge, juryless court which tries cases based on a majority vote. Use of the Special Criminal Court is restricted to cases where &quot;ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice&quot;, and is allowed for by the Constitution of Ireland.
While the power was initially created to prevent court cases being subverted by juries sympathetic to the defendant, the Special Criminal Court was established in 1972 to handle paramilitary cases resulting from the Troubles, when the risk of jury intimidation was high and there had also been a series of light sentences and acquittals by judges and juries sympathetic to the defendants. It has since been used to try cases of high-profile gang leaders and other high-risk non-terrorism cases where normal juries risk intimidation or revenge.

==United Kingdom==
In Great Britain, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 allows for non-jury trials when there is danger of jury tampering, or where jury tampering has taken place. On 18 June 2009, the Court of Appeal in England and Wales made a landmark ruling that resulted in the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, allowing the first-ever criminal trial to be held without a jury by invoking Section 44 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The case in question involved four men accused of an armed robbery at Heathrow Airport in February 2004. After three juries either failed to reach verdicts or were discharged, the fourth trial of the case took place before a single judge, and ended on 31 March 2010 with guilty verdicts for all four accused. The UK had previously established non-jury courts in Northern Ireland, known as Diplock Courts.

Levels of jury tampering were reported in 2002 to be a &quot;major problem&quot; by the deputy commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police and in 2003 to be &quot;worryingly high&quot; in Merseyside by the then Chief Constable Norman Bettison and the then Home Secretary David Blunkett.

==Cases==
*Gil Dozier, Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry, was charged with jury tampering while on bail and after being convicted of five felonies, including extortion and racketeering. He served nearly four years in prison.
*Jimmy Hoffa, a trade union leader, was convicted of jury tampering in 1964.
*The former West Virginia Governor, William Wallace Barron was convicted of jury tampering in 1971.
*George Pape, a jury foreman in a 1987 trial of John Gotti, sought out Gotti&#x27;s underlings, who agreed to pay him $75,000 in exchange for a not guilty vote. Pape was later convicted of jury tampering and sentenced to three years imprisonment.
*In 2007, an attempt to bribe a juror in a case investigating cigarette smuggling in Northern Ireland led to the retrial being heard by a judge sitting alone, the first such ruling.

<text>Evelyne Gebhardt (born 19 January 1954) is a German politician who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1994 to 2022. She is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, part of the Party of European Socialists.

Her main interests are bio-ethics, consumer protection and citizens&#x27; rights.

==Early life and education==
Gebhardt was born in a suburb of Paris. Her father was an industrial chimney sweeper and her mother worked as a translator for Kodak.

After graduating from Lycée Lamartine in 1972, Gebhardt became the first in her family to go to university. She studied at the University Paris Diderot, the University of Tübingen and the University of Stuttgart, studying linguistics, political science and political economy. She subsequently worked as a freelance translator, and moved to Germany in 1975. Since 1992 she has been Chair of the Working Group of Social-Democratic Women. After working in local politics with the SPD, she took out German nationality in 1993, which allowed her to stand for elected office.

In 1999, Gebhardt was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit (with ribbon).

== Member of the European Parliament, 1994–2022 ==
In parliament, Gebhardt was a member of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and of the parliament’s delegation for relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. She was also a substitute member for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Delegation for relations with the Korean Peninsula. In addition, she was a member of the European Parliament Intergroup on the Western Sahara and of the European Parliament Intergroup on LGBT Rights.

Gebhardt is best known for her role in shaping the controversial Services Directive in 2005 and 2006. The directive had aimed at opening up the European Single Market to competition amongst service providers but was, after much political pressure from mostly western and southern EU countries, subsequently watered down by the European Parliament. Gebhardt was parliamentary rapporteur for the directive and played an important role in facilitating an agreement with the European People&#x27;s Party which allowed Parliament to pass the directive with a huge majority and thereby forcing EU governments to follow their line.

Along with Kaja Kallas, Gebhardt served as rapporteur for the digital single market in 2016.

From 2017 to 2019, Gebhardt served as one of the fourteen vice-presidents of the European Parliament under the leadership of Antonio Tajani.

In November 2021, Gebhardt announced that she would resign from the European Parliament by February 2022.

<text>Jacoby Dakota Shaddix (born July 28, 1976) is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, and TV presenter. He is best known as a founding member and the continuous lead singer of the California-based rock band Papa Roach since the band&#x27;s formation in 1993.

Shaddix served as the host of the MTV show &quot;Scarred&quot; for the entirety of the show&#x27;s cycle, presenting both seasons and all 20 episodes of the show, which spanned from April 10 to September 18, 2007. Shaddix would ultimately leave the show due to touring demands with Papa Roach. The name of the show was based on the Papa Roach song &quot;Scars&quot;.

Shaddix is one of the co-owners of a rock-inspired clothing line with designer Jeff Henry called &quot;Lovers Are Lunatics&quot;, with the focus being described as &quot;to create a brand that represents the rock community and showcases their unique creative vision&quot;.

==Music career==

===Papa Roach (1993–present)===

Shaddix is the founding member of Papa Roach. He formed the band with former drummer Dave Buckner, bassist Will James, and guitarist Ben Luther, in 1993. Luther was replaced by current guitarist Jerry Horton, and by 1996 Tobin Esperance had replaced Will James following his departure. In 2007, Dave Buckner&#x27;s role was filled by Tony Palermo, leaving Jacoby as the only original member in the band. The band&#x27;s name, Papa Roach, was the result of mixing up the nickname of Jacoby’s grandfather from his mother’s side —Herbert Fischer &quot;Papa&quot;— and &quot;Roach&quot; coming from his grandfather from his father’s side, John “Grandpa” Roatch. Both grandparents were musicians.
Before releasing their major-label debut album, &quot;Infest&quot;, Papa Roach recorded and published an EP in 1994 entitled &quot;Potatoes For Christmas&quot;. In 1997, their first full-length album, entitled &quot;Old Friends from Young Years&quot;, was released.

Shaddix stopped using rapping as a whole in their 2004 album &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot;. In an interview in 2004, Shaddix said that he became disenchanted with hip hop and what it represented in the media and stated that &quot;I just want to be a rocker&quot;, also stating in 2009 that it was safe to assume he would not be rapping again. However, in 2012, Shaddix started rapping again in the album &quot;The Connection&quot;. There were some tracks on their 2017 album &quot;Crooked Teeth&quot; that featured rapping. In 2021, looked back on his and Papa Roach&#x27;s association with the nu metal genre, reflecting back that &quot;I love being one of the forefathers of nu metal, that’s dope, but we’ve been able to outlive it and celebrate it at the same time.&quot;

On December 13, 2019, Shaddix provided new vocals for a remix of The Hu&#x27;s &quot;Wolf Totem&quot;.

===Fight the Sky (2002–2004)===
Shaddix performed as the lead singer of a post-hardcore band called Fight the Sky from 2002 to 2004 under the name &#x27;John Doe&#x27;. The band was intended as a side project of Shaddix where he could display the heavier side of his vocals. The band&#x27;s line-up consisted of Shaddix as the lead singer, Wade Khail as the lead guitarist and backing vocalist, Ali Abrishami as the bass guitarist and backing vocalist, and Jay Ingram on the drums and percussion. The band had signed a record deal to Papa Roach&#x27;s self-owned label El Tonal Records and entered Velvet Tone Studios in Sacramento, California, to record their debut album &quot;Seven Deadly Songs&quot; between January and February 2004. No public updates have been made regarding either the release date of the album or the future of Fight the Sky.

==Personal life==
Shaddix currently resides in Sacramento, California, with his wife Kelly (married since 1997) and their three sons: Makaile (born March 24, 2002), Jagger (born September 13, 2004) and Brixton (born September 17, 2013). He has two brothers, Bryson and Trevor.

Shaddix has stated that in the first year of his life, he and his family were homeless. Shaddix has had problems with alcohol and drug abuse, but has been sober since 2012. Shaddix revealed he was suicidal before getting clean in 2012. He admitted to a partial relapse during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the stress of the pandemic caused him to smoke marijuana. However, after receiving encouragement from friends, he stopped smoking and has been clean since.

Shaddix is a devoted Christian and has been known to sing Christian hymns and songs at public events.

<doc id="895852" wikidata="Q6708356" url="?curid=895852" title="Lyn Nofziger">
<text>Franklyn Curran &quot;Lyn&quot; Nofziger (June 8, 1924 – March 27, 2006) was an American journalist, conservative Republican political consultant and author. He served as press secretary in Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration as Governor of California, and as a White House advisor during the Richard Nixon administration and again during the Reagan presidency.

==Early years==
Nofziger was born in Bakersfield, California. Politically conservative by the time he attended high school, he worked on the school newspaper.

He accused one of his teachers, Blanche Bettington, of being &quot;communistic&quot; because she warned her students against &quot;reactionary&quot; publications. Bettington and another teacher were removed from teaching as a result, but were reinstated by the Los Angeles Board of Education in 1946, commenting, &quot;While this inquiry has raised serious questions as to certain classroom practices engaged in by these teachers, it has also produced evidence of many outstanding accomplishments by them&quot;. 

Nofziger served in the United States Army and then earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism from San Jose State College in San Jose, California.

==Career==
After earning his degree, he worked for sixteen years as a reporter, editor and Washington, D.C., correspondent for Copley Newspapers and Copley News Service.

In 1966, Nofziger was named press secretary for Ronald Reagan&#x27;s successful California gubernatorial campaign and served two years as Reagan&#x27;s Director of Communications.

After Richard Nixon&#x27;s election as President of the United States in 1968, Nofziger served in the Nixon White House as Deputy Assistant to the President for Congressional Relations and the Republican National Committee as its Deputy Chairman for Communications. Nofziger worked for Nixon&#x27;s presidential re-election campaign in 1972 as executive director of the California Committee for the Re-Election of the President. John Dean, Nixon&#x27;s White House counsel, wrote that Nofziger had helped compile the Nixon White House&#x27;s enemies list.

As Reagan set his sights on the Republican presidential nomination in 1976, Nofziger served his campaign as Press Secretary, Convention Director, and Director of the California campaign. When Gerald Ford won the Republican nomination, Nofziger assisted with the Ford-Dole campaign, which lost the election to Democrat Jimmy Carter.

Nofziger went back to work for Reagan as he began laying the groundwork for the 1980 campaign, serving as executive vice-chairman of Citizens for the Republic, a political action committee founded by Reagan. With the run for the White House in full gear in 1979, Nofziger served as deputy chairman for finance for the Reagan for President organization. Reagan won the election, defeating Carter&#x27;s bid for a second term.

Nofziger never sought to be Press Secretary in the White House, it being in his words &quot;a young man&#x27;s job&quot;. James Brady was named Press Secretary. Nofziger was instead named to the post of Assistant to the President for Political Affairs, and was employed in that position for about a year. Nofziger was a senior consultant for the 1984 Reagan-Bush Re-Election Campaign and a member of the 1985 Inaugural Committee.

Nofziger also ran political campaigns for Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes.

===Wedtech scandal===
In 1987, Nofziger was investigated for allegedly violating the Ethics in Government Act when he lobbied on behalf of Wedtech Corporation, a defense contractor. Under this law, former government officials could not lobby their former office for a period of two years. Nofziger knew this, and for two years he did not lobby the Office of Political Affairs at the White House. Federal prosecutors said the law made it illegal for Nofziger to contact &quot;any&quot; office at the White House. Nofziger was indicted and later convicted of violating the law. Nofziger vigorously fought the indictment and conviction, which was eventually overturned on appeal. The government pressed its case to the United States Supreme Court, which refused to reinstate the conviction. 

===Opposition to metric system===
Nofziger and Frank Mankiewicz were major players in halting the 1970s metrication effort in the United States, largely by convincing President Ronald Reagan to shut down the United States Metric Board.

==Memoir==
Nofziger&#x27;s political memoir, titled &quot;Nofziger&quot;, was published in October 1992 by Regnery Publishing. He wrote four Western novels with a hero named Tackett, a drifter who falls into situations that compel him to rescue women in distress. The Tackett series was an homage to Nofziger&#x27;s friend, Louis L&#x27;Amour, author of &quot;The Sacketts&quot; and scores of other Westerns.

==Death==
Nofziger died on March 27, 2006, at his home in Falls Church, Virginia, from kidney cancer, aged 81. His body was interred in National Memorial Park in Falls Church.

<doc id="895869" wikidata="Q649428" url="?curid=895869" title="Jon Gerrard">
<text>Jon Gerrard (born October 13, 1947) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1993 to 1997, and was a secretary of state in the government of Jean Chrétien. He was the leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party from 1998 until 2013, and the member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for River Heights from 1999 until his defeat in 2023.

==Early life and private career==
Gerrard was born in Birmingham, England, and grew up in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from the University of Saskatchewan (1967), a Doctor of Medicine degree from McGill University (1971), a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Minnesota (1976), and a Certificate in Pediatrics from the American Academy of Pediatrics (1976). He worked at several prominent American institutions in the 1970s, and returned to Canada in 1980 to accept a position as pediatrician at the Winnipeg Children&#x27;s Hospital. Gerrard served as head of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at this hospital from 1985 to 1992, and taught at the University of Manitoba from 1980 to 1993. He has authored or co-authored over 200 scientific publications, and became known during the 1980s as an expert on the research and treatment of cancer in children. Gerrard has also been interested in bald eagles since his teenage years, and co-authored a book entitled &quot;The Bald Eagle: Haunts and Habits of a Wilderness Monarch&quot; in 1988. He has been studying eagles at Besnard Lake in Saskatchewan for 50 years.

Gerrard became active with the Liberal Party of Canada while working on his undergraduate degree, impressed with Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s positions on social and international issues. He was a delegate to the Liberal Party&#x27;s 1968 leadership convention, supporting John Turner. He later volunteered for the &quot;Non&quot; side in the 1980 Quebec referendum, and became Liberal riding president for Lisgar in 1984. In 1990, he was Manitoba co-chair of Jean Chrétien&#x27;s successful bid for the Liberal Party leadership.

==Government minister and federal political career==
Gerrard was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1993 federal election, defeating two-term Progressive Conservative incumbent Felix Holtmann in the riding of Portage—Interlake. On November 4, 1993, he was appointed as Secretary of State for Science, Research and Development. This was not a full cabinet portfolio, but was instead affiliated with Industry Canada. Gerrard worked closely with Industry Minister John Manley, and oversaw the development of such programs as Technology Partnerships Canada, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, and the Canada Research Chairs.

===Internet and communications strategies===
Gerrard outlined the Chrétien government&#x27;s strategy for the burgeoning information highway in February 1994, as internet use increased throughout the country. One of this strategy&#x27;s goals was to &quot;[put] Canada in cyberspace&quot;, by creating a &quot;national network of networks&quot; within the new media. Gerrard indicated that his plan would be targeted toward creating jobs, reinforcing Canada&#x27;s cultural identity, and ensuring universal internet access at affordable rates. He officially launched an $80 million action plan on January 30, 1995, providing funding for online applications in the fields of business, research, health care and education.

In March 1994, Gerrard described the internet as &quot;very much a Liberal technology in the sense that it is much more individual than collective&quot;. Speaking to an interviewer in 2007, he said that the highlight of his political career was convincing the Chrétien government to include a reference to the information highway in its first throne speech.

Gerrard&#x27;s 1994 strategic statement on the information highway also addressed the subject of industry mergers in the communications sector. He indicated that the Chrétien government would &quot;apply pro-competition policies wherever ... they make sense&quot; and added:

===Science and technology strategies===
In June 1994, Manley and Gerrard ordered a full review of federal science and technology policy. This process had three aspects: an internal review, an independent assessment from the National Advisory Board on Science and Technology, and a series of consultations with interested Canadians. Gerrard personally supervised the review&#x27;s consultative sessions, and was appointed as vice-chairman of the National Advisory Board. The government&#x27;s new strategy was issued in March 1996, outlining new plans for funding and tax credits.

The Chrétien government&#x27;s approach to funding the science and technology sectors received mixed reviews. Some criticized the government for cutting several research and science positions during the recession of the early 1990s, although at least one technological journal credited it with maintaining research and development incentives in the austerity budget of 1995. Gerrard himself was described a &quot;passionate advocate&quot; of research investment, and as the driving force behind the government&#x27;s National Technology Investment Program of 1996.

===Additional duties===
Gerrard was given additional responsibilities as Secretary of State for Western Economic Diversification on January 25, 1996. He oversaw the expansion of the Community Futures Development Corporation Network throughout Western Canada, and worked with Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy to ensure a secure transition of the Port of Churchill rail line from Canadian National to OmniTRAX.

===Other===
Gerrard voted in favour of the Chrétien government&#x27;s national gun registry program in late 1994, despite some personal reservations. The registry was unpopular with many rural Manitobans, and Gerrard remarked to John Manley soon after the vote that it would likely cost him his seat in the next election.

===1997 election===
The Portage—Interlake riding disappeared with redistribution before the 1997 election. Gerrard ran in the new riding of Selkirk—Interlake, and lost to Reform Party candidate Howard Hilstrom by 66 votes in a very close three-way contest.

Gerrard returned to his work at the Winnipeg Children&#x27;s Hospital after his defeat. He also became a Medical Research Council of Canada scholar in residence at the University of Manitoba&#x27;s medical school and applied to become Dean of Medicine, as well as returning to his research work on bald eagles.

==Leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party and provincial political career==
Gerrard returned to active political life in 1998, as leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party.

After winning only three seats in the 1995 provincial election and losing its official status in the legislature (which it had enjoyed since 1988), the provincial Liberal Party had nearly disintegrated in 1997 under the leadership of Ginny Hasselfield. She resigned in February 1998, and Gerrard declared his candidacy to succeed her. Supported by former leader Sharon Carstairs, he defeated the only other candidate, former Sagkeeng First Nation chief Jerry Fontaine.

===Elections===
====1999====
Gerrard set modest goals for his party in the 1999 provincial election, saying that the Liberals could win between ten and fifteen seats to hold the balance of power in a minority government. He focused his attention on health care, and pledged that he would serve as his own Minister of Health if elected as Premier. He also promised to appoint a health ombudsman, commit $25 million toward repairing provincial infrastructure, provide $20 million for post-secondary education, end provincial clawbacks of federal tax credits for welfare recipients, and create a new Ministry of Digital Economy and the Information Highway.

The Liberal Party was unable to run a full electoral slate, fielding candidates in only 50 of 57 divisions. Gerrard tried to deflect criticism by joking that he would &quot;put his 50 Liberal candidates up against 57 Tory and NDP candidates any day&quot;, but the failure to run a full slate unquestionably damaged his party&#x27;s prospects.

On election day, Gerrard personally defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Mike Radcliffe in the upscale Winnipeg division of River Heights, which Carstairs had previously represented, but the Liberals won no other seats. The party&#x27;s popular vote fell from 23% to 13%, as many former Liberal voters shifted to the victorious New Democratic Party under Gary Doer.

Gerrard was the only Liberal member of the Manitoba legislature between 1999 and 2003. He was not personally blamed for the party&#x27;s loss, and was reaffirmed as party leader in 2000.

====2003====
Popular support for the Liberal Party increased after the 1999 election, reaching 24% in July 2001 and remaining in the low twenties throughout 2002 and 2003. The party entered the 2003 election in a much improved position from four years earlier: their divisions were largely resolved and their financial situation more secure, and they were able to field a candidate in every division.

Gerrard promised tax cuts for Manitobans under thirty and the elimination of the province&#x27;s payroll tax, and committed to a &quot;health-care guarantee&quot; wherein the government would fund out-of-province health care if services could not be provided within Manitoba. He also promised to create an organization that would integrate health services from different fields, and to establish community health centres for seniors.

Liberal support declined in the final stage of the campaign, and the party ultimately polled a slightly lower percentage of votes relative to its 1999 result. Gerrard was nevertheless returned without difficulty in River Heights, and former Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Kevin Lamoureux gave the party a second seat by retaking his old division of Inkster.

====2007====
The Liberal Party&#x27;s 2007 campaign was centred around five issues: health care waiting lists, threatened emergency room closures in Winnipeg, university funding, urban sprawl, and the environmental state of Lake Winnipeg. The Liberals also pledged to provide immediate funding for rapid transit in Winnipeg, phase out the provincial payroll tax while reducing property taxes by as much as 30%, and introduce a new police unit to protect children from sexual exploitation. The party also stressed an environmentally conscious image, purchasing carbon credits to run a carbon-neutral campaign.

Gerrard and Lamoureux were again returned to the legislature, but no other Liberals were elected and the party&#x27;s popular vote slipped again to just under 12.5%.

====2017====
After being re-elected in 2011, Gerrard resigned as leader and was replaced by Rana Bokhari. He was re-elected in 2016. Gerrard ran for leader again in 2017, but placed third. He was re-elected in 2019.

====2023====
The 2023 campaign was dominated by the ailing healthcare system, affordability, and multiple social issues such as parental rights and MMIW. The governing Progressive Conservatives were very unpopular throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, which lead to the resignation of premier Brian Pallister in 2021 and his subsequent replacement as premier by then health minister Heather Stefanson. The NDP, led by Wab Kinew, which had led in the polls for more than two years in the lead up to the election, specifically targeted Liberal voters to vote strategically and prevent vote splitting on the left. In River Heights, NDP targeting made this a more difficult campaign for Gerrard than in elections prior. Running against Gerrard for the NDP was Mike Moroz, a local teacher who had become a prominent activist against the provincial education Bill 64 in 2021.

On election night, Moroz defeated Gerrard by roughly 6% in the riding, as the NDP would also go on to win a majority government. The result was seen as a major upset, considering the past tilt the riding had towards the Liberals and Gerrard&#x27;s personal popularity in the riding. Gerrard said in interview after his defeat that he got &quot;caught in an orange wave&quot; with strategic voting and anger towards the governing Conservatives denying him another term. Liberal leader Dougald Lamont also lost his re-election bid in St. Boniface, part of an overall poor result for the Liberals. Cindy Lamoureux was the lone Liberal MLA elected in 2023, in which she was re-elected in the riding of Tyndall Park. Gerrard was the longest-serving incumbent MLA to lose re-election in 2023, and at the time was tied with PC MLA Ron Schuler as the second longest-serving MLA in Manitoba. (The longest-serving MLA at the end of the 42nd Manitoba Legislature, outgoing Legislative Assembly speaker Myrna Driedger, retired.)

===Issues===
====Health care====
Gerrard was involved with health issues throughout his time in the legislature. In 2001, he protested the Doer government&#x27;s decision to close an outpatient pharmacy at the Winnipeg Health Sciences Centre by bringing several families of child cancer patients to the legislature to confront the health minister. He later called for changes to Manitoba&#x27;s adult heart surgery program, after figures obtained through a freedom of information request showed an increasing number of fatalities.

Gerrard wrote a &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; column criticizing the Doer government for health-care delays in 2005, and later argued that personal health information should be made more easily accessible to patients and their families. He released a detailed document promoting change in Manitoba&#x27;s health system in September 2007, highlighted by a call to make regional health authorities more accountable to citizens.

====Agriculture and environment====
Shortly after the 1999 election, Gerrard took part in an all-party delegation to Ottawa to lobby the federal government for a cash bailout for struggling western farmers.

In early 2004, Gerrard wrote a guest column in the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; calling on the federal government to test every beef and dairy cow over thirty months for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This recommendation was made during a significant decline in the Canadian cattle market, after the discovery of a BSE-infected cow in Alberta caused the United States to block all Canadian cattle.

Also in 2004, Gerrard accused the Doer government of undermining its water-quality legislation by reducing funds for key programs.

====Social issues====
Gerrard holds liberal views on social issues. He pressured the Doer government to legalize adoption rights for same-sex couples in 2001, one year before a comprehensive bill including adoption rights was passed by the legislature.

Gerrard took part in the Winnipeg Harvest Poverty Challenge in late 2002, and attempted to live for a full week on only $20. The challenge was meant to draw attention to the difficulties faced by Manitoba&#x27;s lowest-income residents, living on social assistance.

In 2003, Gerrard supported calls for a provincial smoking ban in workplaces and enclosed public spaces.

====Other issues====
In early 2005, Gerrard wrote that the Doer government had not taken proper steps to regulate the province&#x27;s burgeoning internet pharmaceutical industry. This industry was popular with American customers, and Gerrard&#x27;s column was written at a time when the federal government was seeking to impose greater control over the sector.

In April 2007, Gerrard introduced a private member&#x27;s bill entitled the Apology Act, to make apologies inadmissible in court as proof of liability or guilt. The bill was modeled after similar legislation in British Columbia, and was intended to allow medical professionals to apologize to patients without risking legal charges. It was passed into law with government support in November 2007, and formally took effect in February 2008.

Gerrard has also called for a public inquiry into the New Democratic Party government&#x27;s alleged role in failing to prevent the financial collapse of the Crocus Investment Fund. Following the 2007 election, he took part in an all-party delegation to Ottawa to argue for increased penalties against gang-related criminals and young car thieves. He has also called for a public review of appointees to the Manitoba Hydro Board, and requested a plebiscite on the location of a power line from northern to southern Manitoba.

In October 2007, he introduced a bill to ban retailers from using plastic bags by 2009. He also criticized the Doer government&#x27;s decision to build a Manitoba Hydro power line on the west side of Lake Winnipeg, and called for the public to be directly consulted on the issue through non-binding referendums.

He called for a provincial moratorium on taser use in 2007, following increased concerns about its safety.

===Other===
Despite his background as a Chrétien supporter, Gerrard was reported to have endorsed Paul Martin&#x27;s bid for the federal Liberal Party leadership in 2003. He supported Gerard Kennedy&#x27;s bid in 2006.

Gerrard released a history of the Manitoba Liberal Party in 2006, entitled &quot;Battling for a Better Manitoba&quot;. A &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; reviewer described the book as &quot;a generally readable—though sloppy—account of one of the three provincial parties&quot;, adding that the book &quot;perhaps should not have been published in its current state&quot;.

<text>Army Group A () was the name of three distinct army groups of the &quot;Heer&quot;, the ground forces of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, during World War II.

The first Army Group A, previously known as &quot;Army Group South&quot;, was active from October 1939 to June 1941 and notably served in the Battle of France as the decisive army group in the implementation of the &quot;Sickle Cut&quot; military plan that inflicted crushing subsequent defeats on the French armed forces at occasions such as the Battle of Sedan, Battle of Boulogne and Battle of Dunkirk and that ultimately led to the Armistice of 22 June 1940. Army Group A was subsequently used in the German occupation of France and temporarily became the first Oberbefehlshaber West in German-occupied France. It was eventually replaced in this function by Army Group D and redeployed to German-occupied Poland in preparation for Operation Barbarossa. At the commencement of that attack, Army Group A was renamed &quot;Army Group South&quot; on 22 June 1941, ending the first deployment.

The second Army Group A was inserted into the German line on 7 July 1942, when Army Group South was split during the German 1942 summer offensive (&quot;Case Blue&quot;) into Army Group B in the north (directed towards Stalingrad) and Army Group A in the south (directed towards the Caucasus). It advanced towards the Terek river, but was eventually forced to withdraw by the winter of 1942/43, concurrent with the decisive defeat of Army Group B in the Battle of Stalingrad. Initially confined to the Kuban bridgehead and the Crimean peninsula, Army Group A fought a rearguard action against the Red Army during its westwards withdrawal through Ukraine. On 2 April 1944, it was renamed &quot;Army Group South Ukraine&quot;.

The third and final Army Group A came into existence on 23 September 1944, when the previous Army Group North Ukraine was renamed &quot;Army Group A&quot;. It existed for about five months that were marked by constant withdrawals from the advancing Red Army and eventually left Army Group A at the Oder river line. On 25 January 1945, Army Group A was one of several army groups to be renamed, receiving the designation &quot;Army Group Center&quot;. No subsequent Army Group A was formed.

== First deployment, 1939–41 ==

Army Group A was formed, through the redesignation of Army Group South, on 26 October 1939 in the central sector of Germany&#x27;s western frontiers, along the France–Germany border and Belgium–Germany border, in the broader area of the Eifel and Hunsrück mountain ranges. Under its previous name, the army group had fought in the Invasion of Poland in September and October 1939. The initial commander and chief of staff of Army Group A were the same persons who held these portfolios during the time of Army Group South in Poland, Gerd von Rundstedt as commander and Erich von Manstein as chief of staff.

=== Preparations for the Battle of France ===
Enthusiasm among the higher echelons of Army Group A for a repetition of the armored thrusts of the Poland Campaign was initially limited; Army Group A chief of staff Georg von Sodenstern predicted as late as 5 March 1940 that a repetition of the swift advances through what was estimated to be a well-developed French defensive line was less than likely.

Nonetheless, the military preparations that the Wehrmacht ultimately settled for in regards to the upcoming Western Campaign was in accordance with the &quot;Manstein Plan&quot;, developed by then-chief of staff of Army Group A Erich von Manstein on his post in the Koblenz Electoral Palace, where the HQ of Army Group A was then located. Manstein had developed the first drafts of his conception in late October 1939 upon his first receival of the original deployment plan against France. Whereas this original plan envisaged to place the focus of operations with the northernmost army group, Army Group B, Manstein instead demanded that the focus be shifted towards Army Group A and the German center. In total, Manstein issued seven memoranda (31 October, 6 &amp; 21 &amp; 30 November, 6 &amp; 12 December, 12 January) arguing for his proposal in various ways. As Manstein&#x27;s insistence annoyed the army&#x27;s general chief of staff, Franz Halder, he was removed from the position of Army Group A chief of staff and instead moved to the command of the upcoming XXXVIII Army Corps, thus eliminating him from a major command post in the upcoming campaign. The Mechelen incident in January 1940, which provoked a response by the Allied armies and allowed the Germans to observe the Allied defensive movements, gave additional credibility to the Manstein Plan, as it made the encirclement of Allied forces in the Low Countries appear plausible.

The Manstein Plan found its way to Hitler&#x27;s desk through the interventions of Günther Blumentritt, Henning von Tresckow and Rudolf Schmundt, and Hitler received Manstein for a private meeting on 17 February 1940 in Berlin. Hitler, who found thought experiments that he had himself had in the previous weeks confirmed in Manstein&#x27;s more elaborate presentation and ordered its implementation, resulting in a complete shift of plans by OKH, placing the German &quot;Schwerpunkt&quot; southwards in accordance with the Manstein Plan. Nonetheless, even though Franz Halder was eventually swayed, many detractors remained. Especially the commander of Army Group B (the army group that stood to lose the most materiel from the change of plans), Fedor von Bock, believed the change of military focus to be an irresponsible gamble. Additionally, the implementation of the plan was not helped by the fact that Halder&#x27;s intrigue to replace Manstein had resulted in the appointment of Georg von Sodenstern as chief of staff of Army Group A. A conservative-minded planner, von Sodenstern had initially been selected by Halder precisely because he opposed the Manstein Plan, and was now left to oversee its realization. Indeed, there were now serious reservations in the upper echelons of Army Group A whether or not the motorized and armored formations should truly be in the vanguard during the advance, or whether it would not be preferable to attack with the infantry first. Such doubts were voiced by von Sodenstern, Blumentritt, and notably by army group commander Gerd von Rundstedt himself. This scepticism was not shared by the advocates of rapid armored assaults, such as Heinz Guderian of XIX Army Corps.

Army Group A would be equipped with 4th Army, 12th Army, 16th Army and Panzer Group Kleist, commanded by generals Kluge, List, Busch and Kleist, respectively. This assignment left the army group with four out of the eight field-army level commands assigned to the three army groups along the western frontier. Each of these armies as well as the panzer group were equipped with three army corps each, placing the army group at a total of twelve army corps. Additionally, Army Group A also received the concentration of German armored and motorized formations, as 5th and 7th Panzer Divisions (XV Corps, Hoth) were assigned to 4th Army and 1st, 2nd, 6th, 8th and 10th Panzer Division (divided among XXXXI Corps (Reinhardt) and XIX Corps (Guderian)) assigned to Panzer Group Kleist. Additionally, Panzer Group Kleist also received the 2nd, 13th and 29th Motorized Infantry Divisions (divided among XXXXI Corps and XIV Corps (von Wietersheim). In total, this left Army Group A with seven panzer divisions and three motorized infantry divisions, compared to just three each for Army Group B further north and none of either type for Army Group C in the south. Whereas Army Groups B and C had 29⅓ and 17 divisions, respectively, Army Group A was equipped with 44⅓ divisions, leaving it as the clear &quot;Schwerpunkt&quot; of the German thrust. Additionally, most of the 42 available reserve divisions were earmarked to support Army Group A rather than either of the other two army groups. The overall task of Army Group A was to breach the Meuse river line between the cities of Sedan and Dinant using a rapid breakthrough of motorized formations and to then advance towards the Somme river estuary. In this, 4th Army was to cross the Meuse at Dinant, the 12th Army at Sedan. The 16th Army was to protect the southern flank from Allied counterattack, whereas the 2nd Army,initially posted in reserves, would be used to follow the advancing 4th and 12th Armies. Once the latter turned towards the Somme estuary, 2nd Army could then be used to cover the spaces vacated by the two other armies. Panzer Group Kleist was to carry the momentum and speed of the assault, receiving a total of 41,140 motorized vehicles including 1,222 tanks (around half of the entire German tank arm&#x27;s stock) spread across two armored corps and one motorized infantry corps, with a total personnel strength of 134,370. This left Panzer Group Kleist as by far the strongest single motorized formation ever used in warfare up to this point. However, Panzer Group Kleist fell victim to a strange compromise that was caused in no small part by its novelty factor: Rundstedt allowed the panzer group to initially operate autonomously, but placed the condition that it would be placed subservient to either of the infantry armies if it managed to catch up to the panzer group. As a result, the leadership of Panzer Group Kleist had a strong incentive during the campaign for single-minded and daring operations to preserve their organizational autonomy.

=== Battle of France ===
During the Battle of France, Army Group A was pivotal in the implementation of the German breakthrough in the central sector of the front (in accordance with the &quot;Manstein Plan&quot;), with Army Group A forces crossing the Ardennes mountain range, and then swiftly turning northwestwards to rush towards the English Channel and trap the Allied armies in the Low Countries. In this, Army Group A (von Rundstedt) would cooperate with Army Group B (von Bock) and Army Group C (von Leeb), all under the joint supervision of OKH.

4th Army advanced on the army group&#x27;s right flank (with 6th Army of Army Group B as its right-hand neighbor) from the Monschau sector along the Liège—Namur axis as well as towards Dinant. To its left, 12th Army stood in the army group&#x27;s center, with its initial thrust directed from the Prüm sector via northern Luxembourg towards Neufchâteau (Belgium) and then towards the Meuse river. Furthest in the south, the 16th Army held the army group&#x27;s left flank and aimed to advance from the Trier—Merzig sector over Luxembourg City towards Longuyon. In its entire sector, Army Group A developed a large numerical advantage, advancing its own 45 divisions through territories held by only 18 enemy divisions.

Within days of the beginning of the campaign, the troops of Army Group A achieved what one of the army group&#x27;s staff officers, Günther Blumentritt, would later refer to as a &quot;three-fold miracle&quot;: The Allied air forces failed to attack the lengthy tank columns that were stuck for hours on end in traffic jams trying to cross the Ardennes, the Germans succeeded with high speed and low casualties to cross the Meuse river with the breakthrough in the Battle of Sedan, and the German tank divisions finally won a stunning victory in what was at times a more than reckless advance towards the channel coast, dangerously abandoning the cover of the German thrust&#x27;s flank against a potential Allied counterattack that never materialized.

There was a repeated tendency during the early days of the campaign where the Army Group A high command and the political leadership would advocate caution, but their instructions overruled and ignored by the divisional and corps commanders on the ground. Georg-Hans Reinhardt of XXXXI Corps ignored a direct oder by the army group and instead advanced with his troops out of their bridgehead at Monthermé. A similar action was undertaken by Heinz Guderian of XIX Corps, who on 14 May was dissatisfied with the prospect of Army Group A leadership using his tanks to safeguard the bridgehead rather than to exploit the momentary disarray in the French army&#x27;s rear. The leader of the panzer group, Ewald von Kleist, found himself in the difficult situation of mediating between his superior army group and his subordinate corps commanders; Kleist had initially covered Reinhardt&#x27;s autonomous actions but was forced on 17 May to give a definitive holding order to Guderian, as Hitler personally had decreed a deceleration of the armored advance. This order remained in place until 19 May.

When the operational delay of 17 May was revoked on 19 May, the tanks&#x27; thrust into the Allied rear continued. There was temporary panic among Army Group A higher-ups when on 21 May, a British attack hit the exposed German flank at Arras, resulting in the Battle of Arras. This attack was however repelled within hours. The first German forces had already reached the channel coast at 02:00 in the morning on 20 May, when 2nd Rifle Regiment of 2nd Panzer Division reached Noyelles-sur-Mer. This left the northern sector of the French Army, the Belgian Army and the British Expeditionary Force cut off in the Low Countries.
By 24 May, the Germans had encircled the critical channel ports of Boulogne-sur-Mer and Calais and were just 15km off the last partially unobstructed port that the encircled Allied forces could use, Dunkirk, where the Allies began to rapidly implement an evacuation of their forces. Particular historical interest has been given to a sequence of events on 24 May 1940 known as the &quot;halting order&quot; (), where the armored formations were ordered to halt outside of Dunkirk and to instead prioritize infantry formations in the Battle of Dunkirk. Popular imagination of both German and Western Allied postwar observers was captured by the idea that the German tanks might have inflicted horrific casualties on the encircled and tightly-packed Allied infantry, if they had not been stopped by undue meddling by higher military command. Hitler had personally insisted on the preservation of the remaining tank forces on 24 May, overruling even Walther von Brauchitsch, the commander-in-chief of the German army, after a worrying 23 May report by Ewald von Kleist had placed the casualties of his panzer group at &quot;over 50%&quot;. Hitler in this concurred with the leadership of Army Group A and went against the intuition of von Brauchitsch, who even attempted to transfer the 4th Army away from Army Group A to insist on his own vision. Due to a coincidence, Hitler happened to be present at Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, and overruled Brauchitsch&#x27;s instructions, implementing instead the &quot;halting order&quot;. The halting order was revoked on 26 May and Dunkirk captured on 4 June. While the British army had been forced to leave behind much of its heavy equipment (including 475 tanks), some 340,000 British and Allied soldiers were successfully evacuated out of Dunkirk.

After the Allied evacuation at Dunkirk, Army Group A tuned southeast and advanced in the general direction of the Vosges mountains and the France–Switzerland border, thus encircling the static French forces positioned along the Maginot Line.

=== Occupation of France ===
On 10 October 1940, Army Group A became the first army group upon whose commander the designation of &quot;Supreme Commander in the West&quot; was bestowed, thus placing them in charge of the military dimension of the German occupation of France. On 15 April 1941, this responsibility was passed to Army Group D. Army Group A had in the meantime been repurposed on 1 April 1941 and earmarked for deployment to German-occupied Poland.

=== Preparations for Barbarossa ===
Starting on 1 April 1941, Army Group A was assigned the cover name Section Staff Winter (), later changed to Section Staff Silesia (), to prepare for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. On the day that this offensive began, 22 June 1941, Army Group A was formally renamed &quot;Army Group South&quot;, thus ending the first deployment of Army Group A.

== Second deployment, 1942–44 ==
Army Group A was prepared for a second deployment starting on 24 April 1942, when an army group organization with the cover name Staff Anton () was formed in the German homeland. This cover name was later adapted to become Coastal Staff Azov () on 22 May. On 7 July 1942, Army Group South, which was currently advancing towards the Caucasus and southwestern Russia as part of the German summer offensive 1942 (&quot;Case Blue&quot;), was split to be divided between two army groups to be newly inserted into the line, Army Group A and Army Group B. This split resulted from additional considerations by Adolf Hitler, who hoped to multiply the offensive gains made by Army Group South by splitting its offensive thrust in two. Whereas Army Group B was to take over the northern sector and the German thrust to the Volga that would climax in the Battle of Stalingrad, Army Group A, under command of Wilhelm List, was assigned to the southern sector of the former Army Group South and placed in charge of the advance into the Caucasus.

=== &quot;Edelweiß&quot;, the advance into the Caucasus ===

On 23 July 1942, the day that German forces captured Rostov-on-Don in the Battle of Rostov, Hitler issued Führer Directive No. 45, making the split of Army Group South permanent by finalizing the orders to be issued to each of the two army groups. Army Group A was assigned the execution of Operation Edelweiss (). The task was to destroy the retreating Soviet forces that had survived the engagement at Rostov and to subsequently capture the Soviet Black Sea coast and to thus deny the Black Sea Fleet its bases. The ultimate goal of the operation was placed at Batumi on the Soviet-Turkish border. Concurrently, Army Group B was to advance to the Don line, secure the Don river, reach the Volga river at Stalingrad, capture that city and subsequently advance to Astrakhan on the Caspian Sea to settle into a defensive line from the Don via Stalingrad and the Volga to Astrakhan. Hitler&#x27;s split of the operation into two divergent attacks had significant implications on the distribution of forces; it especially weakened &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; air support, as the overstretched aerial formations were now forced to cover two army groups with the tendency to increase rather than decrease their distance from each other.On 1 August, Army Group A was equipped with the 1st German Panzer Army (von Kleist), the 17th German Army (Ruoff) and the 3rd Romanian Army (Dumitrescu) and received air support from elements of Luftflotte 4 (von Richthofen). 1st Panzer Army was equipped with four corps (including three panzer corps), 17th Army fielded three corps and the Romanian 3rd Army had two corps, leaving Army Group A at a total strength of nine army corps of German or Romanian nationality.

On 26 August, Army Group A&#x27;s commander Wilhelm List caused Hitler significant anger by dispatching an urgent warning to either choose between immediate reinforcement for his army group or his army group&#x27;s preparations of winter positions. Hitler then dispatched Alfred Jodl to List&#x27;s HQ on 7 September, hoping that Jodl would find List to have to some degree failed his duties. When Jodl instead returned to Hitler with a report of List as a faithful and conscientious commander, Hitler subsequently flew into rages against Jodl and then against List, ending in the latter&#x27;s dismissal on 9 September. Instead of naming another officer to succeed him, Hitler then proceeded to assume direct command of Army Group A himself. He would hold this command until 22 November.

=== Withdrawal from the Caucasus, 1942/43 ===

As the Soviet Operation Uranus encircled parts of Army Group B in the cauldron of Stalingrad, Army Group A (along with Army Group Don) became the target of intensive Soviet offensive preparations. On this background, Hitler gave up direct command of the army group and instead named Ewald von Kleist, until then in command of 1st Panzer Army (where he was succeeded by Eberhard von Mackensen), to lead Army Group A as commander. By December 1942, there was a desperate desire among higher-ranking German officers to withdraw the forces of Army Group A, still partially south of the Terek river, to the Don river and thus to more defensible ground. Hitler initially resisted the idea of withdrawal, but the partial collapse of the central sectors of Army Group B in December 1942 made the withdrawal critically urgent and Kurt Zeitzler was at last allowed to order the retreat. However, Hitler continued to intervene in the withdrawal operations, and forbade the full retreat behind the Don. Instead, 1st Panzer Army was ordered to split its forces, leading a northern segment across the Don at Rostov and placing a southern segment in the Taman Peninsula, thus creating the Kuban bridgehead.

=== Kuban, 1943 ===

As a result of this split, a broad reorganization of army groups was implemented on 27 January 1943. Army Group A had to transfer the northern group of 1st Panzer Army (including the army&#x27;s command) as well as four additional divisions to Army Group Don, whereas the southern group of 1st Panzer Army in the Kuban Bridgehead was detached and added to 17th Army. Army Group A was assigned the task to hold the Kuban bridgehead and to defend the Crimean peninsula from Soviet threat. The strategic idea cherished by Hitler was to hold the Kuban bridgehead long enough to commence a major offensive in summer of 1943 in order to recapture the Maykop oil fields. Additionally, Hitler feared that a loss of the Kuban bridgehead and a subsequent loss of the Black Sea coast might lead neutral Turkey as well as two of Germany&#x27;s allies, Bulgaria and Romania, to reconsider their respective diplomatic alignments to the disadvantage of Germany. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; additionally feared the loss of well-developed air strips.

Between the detachment of 1st Panzer Army in January and the addition of 6th Army in October, Army Group A consisted only of the 17th Army as well as several German command posts concerned with the defense of the Black Sea region, such as &quot;Commander Crimea&quot; and &quot;Commander Kerch Strait&quot;.

The Soviets applied additional pressure through the execution of amphibious landings at Novorossiysk on 4 February. The 83rd Naval Rifle Brigade, 255th Naval Rifle Brigade and 165th Rifle Brigade were deployed to Myskhako, where they were divided by the sea and the Novorossiysk urban area from their own lines, notably the 318th Rifle Division. At this point, the Soviets pressured the line, from north to south, with 58th Army west of Lake Lebyazhiy, 9th Army between Lake Lebyazhiy and Korenovskaya, 37th Army between Korenovskaya and Voronezhskaya, 46th Army between Voronezhskaya and Starokorsunskaya, 56th Army between Shendzhy and west of Smolenskaya, and finally 47th Army between west of Smolenskaya and Novorossiysk and the city as well as the naval landing group isolated at Myskhako. The landing force managed to surprise the German garrison of Novorossiysk, roughly a third of 73rd Infantry Division, but the poorly-chosen landing ground prevented any Soviet land grabs in the immediate aftermath of the landing.

In early February 1943, Army Group A completed the withdrawal into the defenses in the Kuban bridgehead, dubbed &quot;Goth&#x27;s head position&quot; (), assembling 20 divisions with around 400,000 troops in the Kuban and in Crimea. In coordination with &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; landing craft and army engineer boats, Army Group A began the evacuation of superfluous troops not urgently needed in the Kuban itself towards the Crimean peninsula (in part also to reduce supply consumption in the bridgehead). 105,000 persons, 45,000 horses, 7,000 motor vehicles and 12,000 horsedrawn vehicles were thus brought to safety without major casualties. The naval craft were subsequently used to supply Army Group A across the Kerch Strait, where the initial requirement of 1,500 tons of supplies per day was soon upgraded to 4,000 tons per day. Between March and August 1943, the Germans shipped 337,353 tons of supply goods, 6,365 soldiers, 2,566 horses, 1,099 motor vehicles, 534 horsedrawn vehicles and 197 heavy guns from Crimea to the Kuban as reinforcements. These shipments were constantly under bombardment by the Soviet Air Forces.

The leaders of both Army Group A and Army Group Don would indeed have favored to concede control of the entire Kuban outright and to instead use all available forces to strengthen the line of Army Group Don further north, in order to protect the Donbas region. Opposed by the Red Army&#x27;s North Caucasus Front (headquartered at Krasnodar) with five Soviet field armies, the German defenders of the Kuban bridgehead were obliged to gradually give ground. Along the line, Army Group A deployed four corps in the Kuban bridgehead itself: V Army Corps (organized as &quot;Group Wetzel&quot;, Wilhelm Wetzel), XXXXIV Army Corps, XXXXIX Mountain Corps and Romanian Cavalry Corps, for a total of six German and two Romanian divisions in the Kuban bridgehead. Axis strength in the bridgehead numbered roughly 200,000 soldiers, and they were opposed by roughly 350,000 Soviet troops of the North Caucasus Front. Beginning in late March, air support was provided to the Germans and Romanians by the 1st German Air Corps, which helped roughly equalize the aerial balance of powers.

Whereas the frontline had run east of Kurchanskaya, Kiyevskoye, Krymskaya and Novorossiysk on 4 April 1943, all of these towns had been abandoned by 19 September. After a directive by Stavka had reached the North Caucasus Front on 16 March, the Soviet forces initially were placed on defense to prepare offensive operations, to begin in April. The first such attack was launched on 4 April, but the thrust by the 56th Soviet Army against the German XXXXIV Corps in the central southern sector did not achieve any major success and was hindered by bad weather and a lack of Soviet air support. After Georgy Zhukov had personally inspected the Soviet lines along the North Caucasus Front&#x27;s field armies, he issued orders on 17 April to temporarily cease offensive operations.

Soviet attacks were resumed on 27 April, but again failed to attain any noteworthy success and had to be aborted. In the meantime, Army Group A&#x27;s 17th Army had attempted its own offensive operations against the Soviet landing at Novorossiysk.

Starting in mid-September, Army Group A was assigned the task to supervise 6th Army, which was to secure the lower Dnieper river line and to thwart advances by Southern Front forces. On 4 October 1943, the entirety of Army Group A was thus organized into two field armies (6th and 17th) with a total of five corps. The ground forces assigned to this defensive task were entirely insufficient, and were further hindered in their preparations by a general Soviet aerial supremacy over the southern sectors of the frontline. The tardiness with which German planners evacuated the Kuban bridgehead and later the Crimean peninsula critically weakened the defensive capabilities of Army Group A further; the unwillingness to withdraw troops from the Black Sea bridgeheads placed the defenses on the mainland in significant peril. The weak &quot;Wotan-Stellung&quot; defensive position was soon dislodged, thus leaving Soviet encirclement of the Crimean peninsula imminent.

On 9 October at 02:00 in the morning, the German evacuation of 17th Army&#x27;s forces from the Kuban peninsula was completed.

=== 17th Army&#x27;s preparations in Crimea, 1943 ===
After the evacuation of the Kuban bridgehead had been completed, 17th Army was tasked with the defense of the Crimean peninsula, dubbed in Nazi parlance as &quot;Fortress Crimea&quot;. While the commitment of 17th Army left it in danger of being cut off by a Soviet advance through Ukraine, the Crimean peninsula was deemed as an important base to project air power and to control the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Additionally, Crimea provided a role to play for the weakened Romanian army; 17th Army was equipped in late 1943 with only one and a half German divisions but with seven Romanian divisions. The other forces that had been freed up by the evacuation of the Kuban bridgehead had been immediately passed along to the Ukrainian mainland, where they were needed against the pressure of the Red Army.

In the second half of October, 6th Army was pushed out of the Wotan-Stellung defensive position, which made the threat of 17th Army&#x27;s encirclement imminent. In this situation, the commander of 17th Army, Erwin Jaenecke, decided autonomously to initiate preparations for the evacuation of the peninsula. Both Army Group A and OKH favored Jaenecke&#x27;s withdrawal plan, Operation Michael, but the evacuation was vetoed by Hitler&#x27;s personal intervention, which was intensified by Hitler&#x27;s order that Crimea be held on 25 October. OKH accordingly instructed 17th Army to defend Crimea even if the land connection to Axis forces were to be cut. On 28 October, Soviet armored spearheads reached the Isthmus of Perekop, where they were briefly halted. By 1 November, the connection between 6th Army and 17th Army was lost, leaving the 17th Army trapped on the Crimean peninsula. Hitler&#x27;s view clashed with those of Ion Antonescu, the autocrat of Romania, whose troops made up the majority of 17th Army and who doubted the prospects of defending the isolated peninsula against strong Soviet formations and who feared similar Romanian casualties in Crimea as had been suffered at Stalingrad, which he believed to be politically unsustainable for his government. Hitler on 29 October made promises to Antonescu that the peninsula could and would be held and promised the insertion of additional German battalions by land, sea and air for the peninsula&#x27;s defense. These promises were in reality completely unrealistic, but Hitler had received the support of Karl Dönitz of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; on the 27th. Dönitz estimated the resupply of the 17th Army by sea to be possible, much to the annoyance of his army colleague Kurt Zeitzler, who viewed the German-Romanian position on the peninsula to be untenable. On 2 February 1944, the 17th Army trapped on Crimea consisted of the V Army Corps with the 73rd and 98th Infantry Divisions, 3rd Mountain Division and 6th Cavalry Division, the &quot;Group Conrad&quot; constructed around the XXXXIX Mountain Corps and the Cavalry Corps with the 10th and 19th Infantry Divisions under the Cavalry Corps and the 50th and 336th Infantry Divisions and 9th Cavalry Division under the XXXXIX Corps, and finally the 1st Mountain Corps with Fortress Commander Sevastopol and the 1st Mountain and 2nd Mountain Divisions. Additionally, the 17th Army had the 111th Infantry Division in reserve.

On 21 November, the 17th Army was informed by Army Group A command that Hitler still intended to restore the connection with Crimea, though with the caveat that neither OKH nor Army Group A could predict when such an operation would be possible, with Hans Röttiger adding his personal prediction to the dispatch that the relief of Crimea would not be possible in the near future. This uncertainty turned into impossibility when Erich von Manstein of Army Group South demanded the evacuation of the Nikopol bridgehead in January 1944, thus removing the jumping-off point from which the relief of Crimea would have had to be launched. Manstein&#x27;s demands to evacuate the 17th Army to re-insert it into the line on the mainland were rejected by Hitler, who insisted on the continued defense of the Crimean peninsula.
In late October 1943, the Soviet 51st Army launched probing attacks against the Perekop isthmus, defended by XXXXIX Mountain Corps. Attack across the Syvash bay by forces of the 4th Ukrainian Front in early November could still be mostly deflected by the German defenders, though minor territorial losses had to be accepted. In early November, the Soviets also crossed the Strait of Kerch and established bridgeheads north and south of Eltigen in the Kerch–Eltigen operation. As the Soviet offensive thrust decelerated in December 1943, 17th Army command endeavored to crush the Soviet landing site. After a weeks-long blockade against the Soviet landing forces by &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; craft, a German-Romanian counter-thrust defeated the Soviet landing forces and recaptured the bridgeheads within three days of fighting.

17th Army spent the winter of 1943/44 by establishing defenses all around the Crimean coastline using forces of XXXXIX Mountain Corps, V Corps and Romanian 1st Mountain Corps. XXXXIX Corps was charged with the defense of the Perekop isthmus and the western shore, the Romanian Mountain Corps was deployed against Soviet partisans in the mountains in the south of the peninsula, and V Corps was stationed at the Kerch peninsula to provide cover against any Soviet amphibious landing from the east. The sole reserve of the 17th Army was the Mountain Regiment Crimea (), and its armored forces were limited to 45 assault guns that were to be supported in anti-tank operations by elements of the 9th Flak Division.

=== 3rd and 6th Armies&#x27; loss of Nikopol, January 1944 ===
In the meantime, Army Group A had been nominally strengthened on the mainland in December and January 1943/44 through the addition of the 3rd Romanian Army. The 3rd Army was to cooperate with the 6th Army to defend the Nikopol ore area, which took central stage in Hitler&#x27;s strategic considerations due to its manganese production (although this production had been idle for weeks due to the proximity to the warzone). On 30 January 1944, the 3rd Ukrainian Front launched a heavy assault, the Nikopol–Krivoi Rog offensive. The initial thrust east of Krivoi Rog was a diversion from the main attack, which struck two days later against Apostolove. It was in this situation that 6th Army was formally re-attached to Army Group A, which now pushed for an urgent withdrawal of all 6th Army forces to the Kamenka river line.

On 5 February, Apestolovo was captured by the Soviet 46th Army. Kleist ordered a counterattack to be launched by IV Corps on 8 February, but this counter-thrust proved entirely ineffective due to Soviet ground and air superiority and adverse weather conditions. On 10 February, Army Group A inquired to OKH about an urgent large-scale retreat to the Bug—Inhul position, which would shortened its frontline from 320 to 200 km and allowed to place three to four divisions in reserve for additional operations. But as the HQ of Army Group A at Mykolaiv waited for OKH&#x27;s response, the Soviets launched another two-pronged attack against Krivoi Rog to trap LVII Panzer Corps. Army Group A issued orders to 6th Army to initiate a counterattack, and on 19 February XXIX Corps managed to restore the short-term operational integrity of the German forces in the area. The German ad-hoc formation &quot;Group Schörner&quot; (a combination of XXXX Corps, XXIX Corps, IV Corps, XVII Corps under command of XXXX Corps leader Ferdinand Schörner; for a total strength of 10 infantry divisions, a Jäger division and a mountain division) managed to resist annihilation, but had lost most of its heavy equipment in the process, rendering 6th Army even less capable of offensive operations than it had previously been. On 21 February, Kleist allowed 6th Army command to abandon Krivoi Rog, which was under heavy pressure by the Soviet 46th Army.

On 22 February, Hitler at last formally allowed 6th Army to withdraw (to the line Dudchina—Arkhangelskoye—Ternovatka). Until late February, 6th Army managed under significant Soviet pressure to reshape a somewhat ordered defensive line. On 26 February, 6th Army (and thus Army Group A) was expanded to include LII Army Corps, which had formerly been its left neighbor, to better coordinate the cover of the Ukrainian salient&#x27;s northern flank against the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts (who with the 7th Guards Army had advanced as far as Kirovograd). While this measure expanded the frontline of Army Group A by another 110 kilometers, it offered the chance to coordinate the defensive strategy along the entire southern sector of the Eastern Front. However, Hitler&#x27;s repeated interventions in military decisionmaking again prevented a necessary withdrawal, as the LII Corps was ordered to stand its ground southeast of Kirovograd while Stavka was already preparing the next offensive step against the beleaguered Germans.

=== 6th Army&#x27;s withdrawal to the Bug river ===
Army Group A inflicted significant setbacks to the 3rd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts, causing disappointment in the ranks of Stavka about the results of the Soviet winter operations of 1943/44. The Soviets had managed to push the Germans away from the Dniepr line and to recapture the Krivoi Rog—Nikopol sector with its manganese production sites, but the goal of destruction of Army Groups South and A as well as the reconquest of the entirety of Soviet Ukraine had not been attained. Whereas the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts had made significant territorial gains in northern Ukraine, the 3rd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts remained comparatively far behind. In mid-February, Stavka had been forced to reduce the operational goals issued to the 3rd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts. The 3rd Ukrainian Front under Rodion Malinovsky was repurposed to break for the significantly reduced ambition to breach the German defenses on the lower Inhulets river line and to capture the major town of Mykolaiv (where Army Group A had established its HQ). The 4th Ukrainian Front was pulled out of the mainland frontline entirely and instead tasked with the recapture of Crimea, still held by Army Group A&#x27;s 17th Army.

After northern elements of 6th Army had settled into their defensive lines on the Inhulets, the Eastern Front saw a short lull in combat activity due to the &quot;rasputitsa&quot; mud season, though Army Group A high command expected the resumption of Soviet offensive operations against German lines as soon as the climate was more accommodating to such combat. OKH suspected that the southern front sector, with the weakened Army Groups South and A in exposed position, would be the focus of Soviet spring operations in 1944. This prediction came true on 3 March, when the Red Army resumed its attack against the southern part of the Eastern Front. 6th Army stood exposed, as only its left wing was west of the Inhul, the center along the Inhulets and the rightmost elements still on parts of the Dniepr line. The shoddy German defenses had not been sufficiently supplied with laborers or construction materiel to allow swift expansion, and the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front had used the combat pause to assemble several field armies (7th Guards Army, 8th Guards Army, 6th Army, 37th Army, 46th Army, 57th Army) for its offensive, whereas the 4th Ukrainian Front on the lower Dniepr covered the 3rd Ukrainian Front&#x27;s left flank with two additional field armies (5th Shock Army, 28th Army).

Malinovsky resumed the 3rd Ukrainian Front&#x27;s offensive by deploying two of his armies south and one of his armies north of Krivoi Rog and opened a new phase of the attack on 3 March. By 7 March, the Soviets were already just outside Novyi Buh, which the Germans were forced to abandon on the 8th. Army Group A reiterated its ambition to urgently withdraw the 6th Army westwards into a shortened and more compact line, but this plan was once again overruled by Hitler, who ordered on 8 March that the 6th Army would have &quot;to hold and to close the gap&quot;. As the 6th Army attempted to attain this goal, the Soviet 8th Guards Army, having conquered Novyi Buh, turned southwest and resumed its advance towards the Dnieper–Bug estuary. This dash to the sea threatened four corps of Army Group A, still far to the east, with encirclement and complete destruction. Only on 9 March, a retreat was ordered for the forces of the Dniepr to go back to the Inhulets, after Hitler had belatedly accepted that this was required by the military situation. This delayed withdrawal robbed Army Group A of any time it could have used to build preliminary defensive lines, and placed additional pressure by the Soviets against the retreating Germans. Whereas the two corps on the German right withdrew somewhat easily and formed a bridgehead southeast of Mykolaiv on 13 March, the withdrawal from the area between Krivoi Rog and Beryslav proved to be very problematic as 8th Guards Army&#x27;s vanguard reached Barmasovo on 11 March, thus blocking the route of withdrawal for the majority of 6th Army&#x27;s threatened forces. It proved fortunate for the Germans, however, that Malinovsky had split his offensive thrust, leaving the 8th Guards Army alone in the Novyi Buh—Dnieper–Bug estuary sector. Under the concentrated air support of 1st Air Corps, the southern group of 6th Army broke the flank protection of the 8th Guards Army and reached until mid-March the bridgehead Mykolaiv—Trikati as well as the Bug river, where it established a preliminary defensive line. The northern group of 6th Army, &quot;Corps Group Kirchner&quot; (), cooperated with the southern stragglers of Army Group South and reached a line 50km east of the Bug river.

While Army Group A attempted desperately to escape annihilation by the 3rd Ukrainian Front, its northern neighbor, Army Group South, was heavily battered by the 2nd Ukrainian Front, which now also became a threat to Army Group A as the 2nd Ukrainian Front&#x27;s forces had already crossed the Bug river that Army Group A desired to use as its defensive line. After crossing the river at Haivoron and advancing against Army Group South&#x27;s backup line at Bălți—Balta—Pervomaisk, the 2nd Ukrainian Front&#x27;s vanguard became a lethal threat to Army Group A, whose easternmost forces were still well short of the Bug river line. Additionally, the war had now reached the core territory of the Kingdom of Romania, rendering the political future of Hitler&#x27;s most important ally, Ion Antonescu, as well as the continued support of the German Army Group A by its Romanian divisions, more than questionable.

=== 6th Army&#x27;s withdrawal to the Dniestr–Iasi line and the addition of the 4th and 8th Armies ===
Army Group A gained political as well as military significance with the Red Army&#x27;s advance across the Bug, as the civilian and military control of Romania&#x27;s &quot;Transnistria&quot; Governorate, previously overseen by Gheorghe Potopeanu on behalf of Ion Antonescu, now fell to Army Group A, thus effectively ending Romanian rule in the conquered regions across the Dniestr. Army Group A still desperately attempted to stabilize the Bug river against its pursuer, the 3rd Ukrainian Front, but was threatened by the weakness of its left neighbor, Army Group South, against the advances of the 2nd Ukrainian Front. The 2nd Ukrainian Front had managed in early March west to breach the left flank of Army Group South&#x27;s 8th Army west of Zvenyhorod and to thus critically sever the connection between the 8th Army and the 1st Panzer Army. This was followed in mid-March by 2nd Ukrainian Front&#x27;s thrust across the Bug at Haivoron. On 19 March, the commanders of Army Groups South and A, Erich von Manstein and Ewald von Kleist, were received by Hitler at Obersalzberg to request Army Group A&#x27;s withdrawal to the Dniestr and to thus free up German forces to stabilize the situation in the northern line of Army Group South. This was rejected by Hitler, who decreed that Army Group A would have to remain on the Bug river position. In the meantime, Stavka issued new orders to the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts as well. Ivan Konev was to take the 2nd Ukrainian Front to the Prut river and to capture northern Bessarabia, whereas Malinovsky&#x27;s 3rd Ukrainian Front was tasked to prevent Army Group A&#x27;s 6th Army from permanently settling down on the west bank of the Bug. Additionally, 3rd Ukrainian Front was ordered to recapture Odesa and Tiraspol and to eventually reach the Prut and the lower Danube. Additionally, 4th Ukrainian Front opposite Army Group A&#x27;s 17th Army in Crimea was tasked to prepare the commencement of hostilities against Crimea once 3rd Ukrainian Front captured the Mykolaiv region and advanced against Odesa.

In mid-March, 6th Army pulled back IV Corps to deploy it to the Chișinău area. At this point, 6th Army still had five corps on the west bank of the Bug river, which was now additionally threatened by 8th Guards Army&#x27;s successful formation of a small Soviet bridgehead at Nova Odesa. As the situation of 8th Army worsened, 6th Army continuously pulled troops from the Bug to the Balta sector. Finally, on 24 March, Karl-Adolf Hollidt of 6th Army decided to autonomously press for the withdrawal of 6th Army from the Bug. He threatened Army Group A to order the withdrawal himself unless they did it forced, resulting in Army Group A command&#x27;s decree on 25 March to withdraw German 6th Army and Romanian 3rd Army. Additionally, Ewald von Kleist also went against OKH organization and subordinated 8th Army to his own army group to better coordinate the front. One day later, the Romanian high command further strengthened Army Group A with the addition of the 4th Romanian Army. While OKH retroactively approved the subordination of 8th Army, Zeitzler refused to accept 6th Army&#x27;s withdrawal from the Bug to the Dniepr and instead referred Kleist to Hitler&#x27;s personal approval. Hitler surprised both generals by accepting 6th Army&#x27;s withdrawal with minimal resistance, although he still insisted on 17th Army&#x27;s continued presence in Crimea.On 28 March, 6th Army&#x27;s full withdrawal from the Bug commenced. Army Group A, which now contained three German and two Romanian armies, organized its left wing with the German 8th and Romanian 4th Army into the joint &quot;Army Group Wöhler&quot; () under the leadership of 8th Army commander Otto Wöhler. This ad-hoc formation was in turn subordinated to the Romanian 3rd Army of Petre Dumitrescu as &quot;Army Detachment Dumitrescu&quot; (). This organization defied military logic, as the Romanian 3rd Army was physically detached from Army Group Wöhler by the presence of German 6th Army, which was inserted in the line between the two. This rendered General Dumitrescu&#x27;s task to oversee not just his own army but also the far-off Army Group Wöhler on the other flank of Army Group A as more than difficult.

Army Group A&#x27;s hope to settle into a solid line along the Dniestr and Iași was soon foiled, as 6th Army&#x27;s withdrawal was hindered and heavily damaged by continuous attacks by the 46th Army. The German XXIX Corps was split in two by a Soviet advance, thus rendering the plan of an organized retreat from Odesa utopian. A German counterattack failed, and Odesa had to be hurriedly abandoned starting on 9 April. The entire German line hurried, with Hitler&#x27;s approval, to the west bank of the Dniestr. This move was generally complete only by 14 April (when Army Group A had already stopped existing due to its redesignation). The beginning of Soviet operations in Crimea on 8 April against 17th Army added to the pressure.

=== Redesignation ===
On 2 April 1944, Hitler decreed the redesignation of several army groups. Accordingly, Army Group A was renamed &quot;Army Group South Ukraine&quot; on 5 April, whereas its northern neighbor Army Group South became &quot;Army Group North Ukraine&quot;. Both of these names were politically, rather than geographically, chosen: the two army groups had been pushed out of most of Ukraine, so Hitler signalled his willingness to reconquer Ukraine as soon as possible. A few days later, 17th Army, which for so long had formed one of the core formations of the former Army Group A, fell under heavy attack in Crimea as the 4th Ukrainian Front on 8 April began its Crimean offensive.

== Third deployment, 1944–45 ==

=== Formation ===

The final deployment of Army Group A began on 23 September 1944 in the south of German-occupied Poland and in the Carpathian Mountains when Army Group North Ukraine was renamed to become Army Group A. After the Red Army&#x27;s breakthrough at the Sandomierz bridgehead and the commencement of the Vistula–Oder offensive in early January 1945, Army Group A began a general withdrawal towards the Oder river.

=== Defensive preparations ===
On 1 January 1945, Army Group A, with a total of 29 German infantry divisions, 2 German autonomous brigades and 3 Hungarian infantry divisions in the vanguard, and 5.5 German mobile divisions and a &quot;Jäger&quot; division as well as two Hungarian divisions in reserve, commanded 93,075 infantrymen on a length of 700km (or around 133 men per kilometer), not counting the temporarily attached 1st Hungarian Army. Additionally, the entire army group possessed 1,816 artillery guns, 318 combat-ready tanks, 616 combat-ready assault guns and 793 combat-ready anti-tank cannons. All segments of the German front were outnumbered in a direct comparison between Soviet and German armored vehicles. Of the 700km of frontline, 163km were held by 1st Panzer Army, 128km by 17th Army, 187km by 4th Panzer Army and 222km by 9th Army.

The final year of the war was marked by the overwhelming disparity of forces between the Germans and the advancing Allies; on 10 January 1945, high-ranking &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; officer Robert Ritter von Greim estimated the opposing strengths of the Allied and Axis air forces in the sectors of Army Groups Center and A to be 300 German planes versus 10,500 Allied planes, or a ratio of 35:1 in favor of the Allies.

=== Soviet winter offensive and the collapse of Army Group A ===

On 12 January 1945, the Red Army launched its major winter offensive along the entire line with the 1st Ukrainian Front and the 4th Ukrainian Front. These were joined on 13 January by the 1st Baltic Front, 2nd Byelorussian Front and 3rd Byelorussian Front with a major attack against East Prussia, and on 14 January by 1st Byelorussian Front in the center. The initial attack on 12 January at 04:00 in the morning from the Baranow bridgehead caused significant troubles in the staff of Army Group A, who had broad strategic information about Soviet avenues of attack, but lacked tactical specifics about individual Soviet divisions and corps and their respective directions of thrust. Additional trouble was caused by the cooperation between the advancing Soviet forces and the Polish Home Army, who supported the Red Army&#x27;s attacks with partisan activities behind the German lines. Initial attempts at German counterattacks by the &quot;Jagdpanzers&quot; and assault guns of the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps were repelled by elite Soviet armored formations including the 3rd Guards Tank Army and 4th Guards Tank Army, as well as by the 31st Tank Corps and the 4th Guards Tank Corps.

On 17 January, the Soviet leadership reacted to the ongoing collapse of Army Group A, which was a surprise even to the Soviets, by ordering 1st Byelorussian Front to reach the line Bromberg—Posen no later than 4 February. 1st Ukrainian Front was assigned Breslau as a target, and to reach the Oder river and form bridgeheads on its west bank no later than 30 January. The 1st Ukrainian Front crossed the prewar German border on 19 January into Silesia and reached the Oder on 22 January. On the following day, the 1st Byelorussian Front captured Bromberg.

Following the disaster on the Vistula, Hitler reacted with several established themes, such as the replacement of commanders and the redesignation of army groups. The new Army Group Vistula was ordered for deployment on 21 January and assigned to Heinrich Himmler. Army Group Vistula was to be inserted in the northern sector of the mainland of the Eastern Front, to prevent the Soviet breakthrough towards Danzig and Posen. On 25 January 1945, the final deployment of Army Group A ended as Hitler renamed three army groups: Army Group A became the new &quot;Army Group Center&quot;, the old Army Group Center became &quot;Army Group North&quot;, and the old Army Group North, which was trapped in the Courland Pocket, became &quot;Army Group Courland&quot;.

<text>The W-platform (also known as the W-body) was a General Motors automotive platform underpinning both mid size and full-size front-wheel drive cars — across the platform&#x27;s three generations from 1987-2016. 

Code named GM10, the program began development in 1982 under Chairman Roger B. Smith and debuted in 1987 with the Pontiac Grand Prix, Buick Regal, and Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme coupés — with the four-door sedan body style introduced for 1990.

The 1997–2005 2nd Generation, or W2 Platform, used both a 110.5 in full-size wheelbase as well as a 109 in mid-size wheelbase.

From 2005-2016, the W3 Platform used a 110.5 in, full-size wheelbase in sedan and coupe configurations, including for the Pontiac Grand Prix (2004-2008), Buick LaCrosse/Allure (2005-2009), Chevrolet Impala/Impala Limited (2005-2016) and Chevrolet Monte Carlo (2000-2007) — each with high performance V8 variants.

==History==
The platform cost $7 billion to develop, with engineering executed by the Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada (CPC) group; also known as the small car division. The original program was intended to replace all midsize cars produced by Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick on the G and A platforms. This ultimately did not happen; while the A-platform Chevrolet Celebrity and Pontiac 6000 were quickly discontinued, the A-body Buick Century and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera remained in production until 1996. 

The plan was for seven GM plants that would each assemble 250,000 of the cars, or 21% of the total U.S. car market. It was badly executed from the start, but GM&#x27;s 1984 reorganization, combined with changing market dynamics, wrought havoc with the program and it never recovered. In 2008, prominent shareholder activist Robert A. G. Monks noted that GM had lost $2000 on every car it produced in 1989, the year before the last of the original GM10&#x27;s were launched.

The next iteration of the platform was known as the MS2000 or simply the W2 platform. Early versions used a transversely installed, fiberglass mono-leaf spring combined with struts in the rear. The &quot;generation 1.5&quot; W-body models had updated rear suspensions that used coil springs instead of the transverse leaf spring design inspired by the Chevrolet Corvette. For the 1997 model year the second generation W-body was released with a MacPherson strut coil spring design.

A revised and updated W3 platform was introduced in 2004, rather than a stretched Epsilon platform, as had been planned. Parma Metal Fabricating Division of Parma, Ohio was responsible for metal fabrication and final assembly took place at GM&#x27;s Oshawa Car Assembly. The transverse use of GM&#x27;s LS small-block engine in the W-bodies was a major addition for 2005.

The GM W Platform was phased out with the production of the new long-wheelbase Epsilon II platform. The last car produced on the W platform was the ninth generation of the Chevrolet Impala, which was replaced by the Epsilon-based tenth-generation Impala, beginning in model year 2014. GM continued to produce the W-body Impala to fleet customers only under the name Impala Limited until production ended in May 2016.

<text>The Schenk von Stauffenberg family is a Roman Catholic &quot;Uradel&quot; German noble family from Swabia, Germany. The family&#x27;s best-known recent member was Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg – the key figure in the 1944 &quot;20 July plot&quot; to assassinate Adolf Hitler.

== History ==
The recorded history of the Schenk von Stauffenberg family begins in Swabia in the 13th century, when the family, who belonged to the Reichsrittern (Imperial Knights), originated from the settlement Cell, where they owned extensive estates surrounding the village and the Zollerberg.

Its first known member is mentioned in 1251 as Wernherus Pincerna de Celle, who in 1255 was appointed to the ceremonial court office of (cup-bearer, sommelier, butler) with the Counts of Zollern. The officeholder was in charge of his lord&#x27;s wine cellars and vineyards, and when the office of Schenk later became hereditary within the family, the title was adopted into the family name.

Surnames were appended according to the officeholder&#x27;s place of residence, and so the family name varied between &quot;Schenk von Zell&quot;, &quot;Schenk von Neuenzell&quot;, &quot;Schenk von Andeck&quot;, &quot;Schenk von Erpfingen&quot; and &quot;Schenk von Stauffenberg&quot;. By the end of the 15th century, the family&#x27;s permanent name was Schenk von Stauffenberg, which refers to &quot;Burg Stauffenberg&quot;, a former castle situated by a small cone-shaped mountain of the same name between the small town of Hechingen and its suburb Rangendingen in Land Württemberg. A tradition in the family also associates it with the Staufen dynasty.

The Stauffenbergs rose in the world in 1698 when Emperor Leopold I conferred upon the brothers Maximilian Gottfried and Johann Philipp the hereditary title of Reichsfreiherr (Imperial Baron). The family was later split into four branches: the Katzensteiner, Bacher, Wilflinger and Amerdinger ones. The former two became extinct during the 18th century, while a member of the Wilflinger branch was raised to the rank of hereditary Reichsgraf (Imperial Count) by Emperor Leopold II in 1785. Since the Wilflinger branch also became extinct in 1833, only the baronial Amerdinger branch remained. All now living members of the family are descendants of the brothers Franz Ludwig and Friedrich of the Amerdinger branch. Franz Ludwig was made a hereditary Graf (Count) in the Kingdom of Bavaria by King Ludwig II. Since then, there exist two sub-branches: one which holds the title of Count and one which bears the title of Imperial Baron. Both of these branches are still extant and their members reside mostly in Baden-Württemberg and in Bavaria. 

In the 16th century, the Stauffenberg family acquired the Amerdingen castle near Nördlingen through marriage. Before that, the Stauffenbergs were owners of Wilflingen and Jettingen. Over the course of the years, further estates were added to the family&#x27;s possessions, such as Schloss Greifenstein and Schloss Burggrub in Heiligenstadt near Bamberg, the Lautlingen castle near Ebingen on the southern slopes of the Schwäbische Alb, Schloss Rißtissen some twenty kilometers south of Ulm, and the Straßberg and Wildentierberg estates in Lautlingen near Albstadt.

After 1918, when the constitution of the Weimar Republic abolished all noble titles in Germany and declared them to be part of the family name, the family came to have two names in order to preserve the former titles of Schenk, Graf (Count) and Freiherr (Baron) as parts of the surnames.

Since the title of Schenk is considered to be of superior rank due to being a hereditary office title, it is placed before the noble title, which in turn is placed before the surname. The correct versions of the family&#x27;s surnames are thus &quot;Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg&quot; and &quot;Schenk Freiherr von Stauffenberg&quot; respectively. Two of the family&#x27;s members also served as Prince-Bishops – of Bamberg (Marquard Sebastian), and of Augsburg and Konstanz (Johann Franz) – and thus they used the title of Fürst (Prince) instead of their other noble titles, such as Imperial Count.

<text>Dr. Allan Roy Dafoe, OBE (29 May 1883 – 2 June 1943) was a Canadian obstetrician, best known for delivering and caring for the Dionne quintuplets, the first quintuplets known to survive early infancy.

==Biography==
Dafoe was born in Madoc, Ontario, the son of a physician Dr William Allan Dafoe. He trained in the same profession and, in early 1909, he went into practice in Callander, Ontario, where he resided for the rest of his life.

On 28 May 1934 he assisted in the multiple births of the Dionne family, that saw the survival of the mother and all the children. This got international press notice. He continued to help care for the children for years, and became something of a celebrity in the onslaught of media attention. 

In response to public interest, a special nursery was built for the children where the curious members of the public viewed them. There was no charge to this, so it did not give the impression to the viewers they were exploiting the children. This was generally approved of at the time, but later generated criticism for the sideshow atmosphere it produced. Souvenir stands and other concessions surrounded the area where the quints lived.

Once the quints were born, Dafoe became one of their guardians, and he devoted little work to his medical practice, turning it over to others. He became wealthy from his pay as guardian and from multiple commercial endorsements and speaking fees.

In &quot;The Country Doctor&quot; (1936), a movie starring the quints, Jean Hersholt portrayed Dr. John Luke, a character based on Dafoe, and there were two sequels: &quot;Reunion&quot; (1936) and &quot;Five of a Kind&quot; (1938). When Dafoe blocked the idea of continuing the series, Hersholt created &quot;Dr. Christian&quot;, which had a long run on radio.

Dafoe&#x27;s induction into the Circus Saints and Sinners Club of New York as &quot;Doctor of Litters&quot; in 1938 drew much criticism from French-Canadian groups who suggested such an honour (howbeit facetious; he arrived in a Rural Free Delivery wagon emblazoned &quot;A. R. Dafoe--Mass Deliveries&quot;) was condescending and against the best interests of the quintuplets; such, in fact, eventually being used by the quints&#x27; father, Oliva, in his subsequent case to reclaim custody.

Dafoe was awarded an Order of the British Empire for his work with the Dionne quintuplets. He died on 2 June 1943 at age 60 from pneumonia and complications from cancer, and is buried at Park Lawn Cemetery in Toronto.

Today, his home is the Callander Bay Heritage Museum and Alex Dufresne Gallery in Callander, Ontario. It is located at 107 Lansdowne St. E. and tells the story of the history of Callander with a special focus on himself and the Dionne quintuplets.

<doc id="895905" wikidata="Q3716309" url="?curid=895905" title="Dunster House">
<text>Dunster House is one of 12 undergraduate residential houses at Harvard University. Built in 1930, it is one of the first two Harvard dormitories constructed under President Abbott Lawrence Lowell&#x27;s House Plan and one of the seven Houses given to Harvard by Edward Harkness. In the early days, room rents varied based on the floor and the size of the room. Dunster was unique among Harvard dormitories for its sixth-story walk-up (it had no elevators); these rooms were originally rented by poorer students, such as Norman Mailer.

The House was named in honor of Henry Dunster, Harvard&#x27;s first president.

==History==
Dunster House&#x27;s tower is inspired by, but somewhat smaller than, Tom Tower of Christ Church, Oxford. Above the east wing is the Dunster family coat of arms, and above the west wing is the coat of arms of Magdalene College, Cambridge, where Henry Dunster matriculated in 1627. Magdalene College commemorated the relationship between the two universities by sending medieval tracery stones from the First Court of Magdalene; these are now set in the wall near the doors to J-entry of Dunster House. 

Dunster is on the banks of the Charles River next to the John W. Weeks Footbridge, which links Harvard&#x27;s Allston and Cambridge campuses. From above, its architectural shape, unusual among the River Houses, resembles a branching flowchart due to the odd trapezoidal footprint of the land on which it was built. Dunster underwent a &quot;full House renewal&quot;, a comprehensive renovation, that was completed in 2016. It was the first of Harvard&#x27;s residential houses to undergo such a renewal. 

Like many of Harvard&#x27;s Houses, Dunster has many yearly traditions, including Keg Races in the fall, a &quot;Messiah&quot; singalong in the winter, a Goat Roast in the spring, and the yearly Dunster House Opera. It is known as one of the more social houses, with Stein Clubs and formals in either the dining hall or courtyard.

As of the 2017-18 academic year, Dunster&#x27;s Faculty Deans (formerly known as &quot;house masters&quot;) are Sean Kelly and Cheryl Chen. The House&#x27;s first master was Chester N. Greenough (Harvard class of 1898), an English professor and former dean of Harvard College. Former faculty deans/house masters include Roger Porter and Ann Porter, Raoul Bott, and Sally Falk Moore and Cresap Moore. Gregory Davis currently serves as the Allston Burr Resident Dean. His predecessor was Michael Uy.

Dunster&#x27;s mascot is the moose, inspired by the three golden elk on the Dunster family crest.

== Physical building ==
Dunster House opened in 1930, and contains student rooms, a faculty dean residence, and a dining hall with views of the Charles River.

== Notable alumni ==
Al Gore and Tommy Lee Jones were roommates at Dunster House in the late 1960s. Other notable Dunster alumni include Tatyana Ali, Christopher Durang, Lindsay Hyde, Dan Wilson, Michael Mainelli, Jean Kwok, and Danielle Sassoon. In 1995, resident Sinedu Tadesse killed her roommate Trang Ho in Dunster before dying by suicide in a closet.

<text>Kalacakra was a 1970s German psychedelic underground band formed by the duo Claus Rauschenbach and Heinz Martin. Their sound carried a heavily eastern influence, with a lot of flute, sitar and percussions, and their style has been described as &quot;mantric acid folk.&quot; &quot;Kalacakra&quot; refers to a Tibetan Buddhist concept of &quot;time-cycles.&quot; The band released its only album, &quot;Crawling To Lhasa&quot;, in 1972. They recorded in German.

The album was re-released on CD in 2001 by Garden of Delights, featuring two bonus tracks absent from the 1972 release.

In 2002 after a gap of 30 years another album was released by the reformed band. The album was called &quot;Peace&quot; and contained a more New Age fare compared to the 1972 Krautrock.

<text>Stig Halvard Dagerman (5 October 1923 – 4 November 1954) was a Swedish author and journalist prominent in the aftermath of World War II.

== Biography ==
Stig Dagerman was born Stig Halvard Andersson in Älvkarleby, Uppsala County. He later took his father&#x27;s surname Jansson and then changed his name to Stig Dagerman in his teens. In the course of five years, 1945–49, he enjoyed success with four novels, a collection of short stories, a book about postwar Germany, five plays, hundreds of poems and satirical verses, several essays of note and a large amount of journalism. He died in 1954, having shut the doors of the garage and run the engine.

==Literary style and themes==
Dagerman is representative of the Swedish literary movement fyrtiotalism. His works deal with universal problems of morality and conscience, of sexuality and social philosophy, of love, compassion, justice, fear, guilt, and loneliness. Despite the somber content, he also displays a wry sense of humor that occasionally turns his writing into burlesque or satire.

== Legacy ==

The annual Stig Dagerman Prize awards individuals who, like Dagerman, promote empathy and understanding through their work.

In 2023 the centenary of Stig Dagerman&#x27;s birth was celebrated in Sweden with various events and staging of plays. In Stig Dagerman&#x27;s native Älvkarleby a park was namned after Dagerman and a statue of him was placed there.

<text>Gerardus Johannes Mulder or Gerrit Jan Mulder (27 December 1802 – 18 April 1880) was a Dutch organic and analytical chemist.

==Life==
Mulder was born in Utrecht and earned a medical degree from Utrecht University.

He became a reader of chemistry in Rotterdam and in 1840 he was appointed professor at Utrecht University.

===Protein===
Following a suggestion by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, Mulder used the term protein in his 1838 paper, &quot;On the composition of some animal substances&quot; (originally in French but translated in 1839 to German). In the same publication, he also proposed that animals draw most of their protein from plants.

Mulder &quot;was the first to propose a theory concerning the causes of the differences between albumin, casein, and fibrin, and other substances more or less similar to them in physical properties and in their chemical behavior when exposed to reagents. Analyses of these substances showed that their percentage contribution with respect to carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen were so similar as to suggest that they contain one common radical.&quot;
This radical, a macromolecule, had formula &lt;chem&gt;C20 H31 N5 O12 ,&lt;/chem&gt; and was known as &quot;protein&quot;. The variations in albuminous substances were attributed to peripheral bonds of protein to sulfur and/or phosphorus. Justus Liebig and his students sought to determine the structure of proteins, but until the methods of Emil Fischer and Franz Hofmeister became available, the amino acid decompositions were unknown.

Augustus Voelcker was Mulder&#x27;s assistant for a year from 1846.

In 1850, Mulder was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He died in Bennekom.

<doc id="895943" wikidata="Q7939223" url="?curid=895943" title="Vocational Certificate of Education">
<text>Vocational Certificate of Education, usually shortened VCE or Vocational A-Level or AVCE, was a vocational qualification that used to be available in further education colleges and sixth forms in the United Kingdom.

==Subjects and assessment==
VCEs were available in many subjects including Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Health and Social Care, Hospitality and Management, Leisure and Recreation, Travel and Tourism and Business. Some students preferred the vocational system due to its practical &#x27;hands-on&#x27; nature.

The qualification was created in September 2000 to replace the Advanced GNVQ, with the main change being that the marking system was altered from the three level Distinction, Merit and Pass system to A–E grading, bringing the AVCE into line with A-Levels. The AVCE was intended to lead on to higher education or employment and was made up of modules, each covering different aspects of the subject. Some of these modules overlapped and some institutions chose to merge their content. Students had to complete a set number of modules in order to qualify for an AVCE: 

*AVCE Double Award - 12 units (worth two A-levels)
*AVCE Single Award - 6 units (worth one A-level)
*ASVCE - 3 units (worth one AS-level)

Assessment was by a mixture of continuous assessment, based on a portfolio of evidence, and externally set and marked examinations. 

==Withdrawal==
The regulatory body, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), along with Welsh equivalent ACCAC, decided in June 2004 to withdraw the Advanced VCE, with the final candidates starting in September 2004. They created and piloted an &quot;Applied GCE (AGCE)&quot; qualification to replace the AVCE. Edexcel withdrew AVCE ICT in June 2006 but students were able to re-submit coursework until November 2006 and could re-sit exams until January 2007. The GNVQ is still currently available in two forms – Foundation and Intermediate levels – which both work up to the Advanced level. This was withdrawn in 2007. The decision to withdraw the qualification proved unpopular.

<doc id="895957" wikidata="Q7579231" url="?curid=895957" title="Spork Press">
<text>Spork Press is a small press in Tucson, Arizona edited and constructed by Richard Siken, Drew Burk, Andrew Shuta, Joel Smith, and Jake Levine. Beginning in 2001, it began publishing a quarterly literary magazine called &quot;Spork&quot;, which is often bound hardback.

==History==
At one time Spork Press was a publisher specializing in hand-made literary magazines with the occasional book release. It now produces a larger output of books and tapes while occasionally publishing the &quot;Spork&quot; literary magazine.

Spork Press also produces chapbooks and novels. The books published include Roderick Maclean&#x27;s &quot;Tropic/of/Cubicle&quot;. Beth Toener&#x27;s &quot;A La Recherche Du Petit Pseudo-Rockstars Perdu (Split E.P.)&quot; has been released in serial form.

In 2010 Siken and Burk decided to take a break from the regular publication of a literary magazine, choosing to instead publish issues of the journal only when they had an idea they were excited about. Issue 9.1 &quot;The Middles Of Things&quot;, was the first along these new lines. Five authors were tasked with writing the middle of a novel, but were not allowed to write the beginning or the end; they were instructed to treat it as though they had walked into the middle of a movie, and to simply describe what they saw. Sharon McGill provided the illustrations for each piece, and Amelia Gray ordered the pieces, writing interstitial parts and creating a loose impression of a continuous narrative through the book. She chose to order the pieces from most conventional to the least. In the absence of the regular magazine, Spork has been publishing a chapbook series, though the term &quot;chapbook&quot; is applied loosely: &quot;This here, this mixtape? It&#x27;s a chapbook. This novel? It&#x27;s a chapbook. Everything we do is a chapbook.&quot; Burk said, and that is how things are done by the publisher. Chapbooks have traditionally been throwaway items – Spork subverts this idea with letterpressed hardback hand-bound books, and an inattention to the rest of the things chapbooks usually are.

Most recently, Ariana Reines&#x27; &quot;THURSDAY&quot; (Spork Press, 2012), Joyelle McSweeney&#x27;s &quot;the Necropastoral&quot; (Spork Press, 2011), Lara Glenum&#x27;s &quot;All Hopped Up on Fleshy Dum Dums&quot; (Spork Press, 2014) and Zach Schomburg&#x27;s, &quot;From the Fjords&quot; (Spork Press, 2011) have received attention for their quirky design and the texts themselves.

The Spork team consists of Drew Burk (Production/Editor), Andrew Shuta (Design/Production), Richard Siken (Editor), Joel Smith (Editor), Jake Levine (Editor), and others who help out.

<doc id="895958" wikidata="Q6183593" url="?curid=895958" title="Jerry Fontaine">
<text>Jerry Fontaine is an Anishinaabe politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was chief of the Sagkeeng First Nation from 1989 to 1998, led the First Peoples Party in the 1995 provincial election, and was an unsuccessful candidate to lead the Manitoba Liberal Party in 1998. He was the director of Indigenous Initiatives at Algoma University from 2004-2008.

Fontaine is the nephew of Assembly of First Nations leader Phil Fontaine.

==Early career==

Fontaine received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Manitoba in 1976. He first campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1986 provincial election, contesting Lac du Bonnet as a Liberal. The Liberal Party was a weak electoral force in Manitoba during this period, and Fontaine received 959 votes (11.33%). The winner was Clarence Baker of the New Democratic Party.

==Sagkeeng chief and FPP leader==

Fontaine became chief of the Sagkeeng First Nation three years later, and led the community until 1998. During his tenure as Chief, Sagkeeng developed the First Nation&#x27;s constitutional declaration. This declaration facilitated the Manitoba Hydro Accord, a process that enabled the community to mitigate erosion damages caused by Hydro development and enforce its jurisdiction over its traditional territory. The constitutional process mandated the First Nation&#x27;s Law-Making Assembly to pass two important pieces of legislation in relation to the Hydro Accord: the Process Law and Conservation Law. He was a supporter of local gambling rights, and launched a private prosecution against the Pine Falls pulp mill in 1995 for violations of the Water Rights Act. By his own admission, he destroyed his Liberal Party membership in 1994 when the Canadian government of Jean Chrétien relaxed anti-pollution standards in the area near his community. Fontaine became a prominent spokesman for Manitoba&#x27;s First Peoples Party (FPP) later in the year and was generally recognized as the nascent party&#x27;s leader, although it is not clear if he held an official position.

The FPP was created following a 1993 resolution of the Assembly of Manitoba chiefs that advocated a political party focused on aboriginal issues. The party argued that all native peoples in Canada have an inherent right to self-government and that the country&#x27;s traditional political parties were not addressing aboriginal concerns. Fontaine emphasized that the FPP was open to all Manitobans, not simply those of aboriginal background.

The party ran three candidates in the 1995 provincial election, all of whom were defeated. Fontaine ran a credible campaign in the vast northern constituency of Rupertsland, but received only 541 votes (12.22%) for a fourth-place finish against New Democrat Eric Robinson, who is also aboriginal. The FPP ceased to exist after the election.

In 1998, an investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation raised allegations that a separate aboriginal-issues party called Independent Native Voice (INV) had been set up by Progressive Conservative organizers to take votes from the New Democratic Party in marginal constituencies. A commission led by Judge Alfred Monnin ruled that these organizers had induced at least one candidate, Darryl Sutherland, to run. The FPP was not implicated in this scandal. In the year the scandal broke, Fontaine informed the media that Sutherland had approached him late in the 1995 campaign to acknowledge that Conservative organizers provided him with funds. He encouraged Sutherland to take his story to the press, although Sutherland rejected this advice at the time. Fontaine has asserted that &quot;the Tories took advantage of Aboriginal individuals who weren&#x27;t all that involved in political issues or political life&quot;, and argued that the incident was symptomatic of the way aboriginal voters are sometimes treated by mainstream parties.

==Liberal leadership campaign==

Fontaine rejoined the Manitoba Liberal Party after the FPP&#x27;s dissolution, and became a candidate for the party&#x27;s leadership in 1998 following the resignation of Ginny Hasselfield. He was 42 years old at the time. His candidacy was organized by Ernie Gilroy, and won support from figures such as Terry Duguid and Graham Dixon. Fontaine emphasized that he was not a protest candidate, and his campaign did not focus exclusively on aboriginal issues. Initially regarded as the frontrunner, he lost to former Member of Parliament Jon Gerrard by 1336 votes to 832 in a mail-in ballot open to all party members. He was not a candidate in the 1999 provincial election.

==Wing Construction==

During the 1998 leadership contest, Fontaine was served with a $100,000 lawsuit from Wing Construction Limited, which had previously received a contract for school construction in Sagkeeng. Wing Construction argued that the Sagkeeng council had not turned over promised funds, and asserted that the company was left to sustain a loss of three million dollars. The federal government later determined that the Wing contract had not been formally approved by the Department of Indian Affairs, and the company was forced into bankruptcy protection in 2000. Fontaine characterized the personal lawsuit as &quot;frivolous&quot;, and was later described as saying that the company had overstated the value of its work. Others have disputed this, and Alan Isfeld of the Waywayseecappo First Nation argued that the collapse of Wing Construction created a potentially destructive precedent for aboriginal/non-aboriginal partnerships in Canada.

Separate from the Wing Construction controversy, some members of the Sagkeeng first nation accused Fontaine of inadequate on-reserve housing in 1998. He resigned as chief following a series of protests, saying that he needed to devote all of his attention to the leadership contest. He later defended his financial record against what he described as a &quot;continued siege by government and media alike&quot;.

==Since 1998==

From 1998-2003, Fontaine served as Senior Advisor to the Pine Falls Paper Company. During this period, he facilitated negotiations between the Pine Falls Paper Company (PFPC) and participating Anishinaabe Nations in the development of a partnership agreement between the PFPC and the Anishinabe Nations.
