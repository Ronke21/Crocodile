<text>Gloria Rachel Allred ( Bloom; born July 3, 1941) is an American attorney known for taking high-profile and often controversial cases, particularly those involving feminist causes. She has been inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Gloria Rachel Bloom was born in Philadelphia into a Jewish working-class family on July 3, 1941. Her father, Morris, worked as a salesman; her British-born mother, Stella, was a householder. After graduating from the Philadelphia High School for Girls, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she met her first husband, Peyton Huddleston Bray Jr. The couple had their only child, Lisa Bloom, on September 20, 1961, and divorced shortly after. Bloom is also an attorney and is best known as a former Court TV anchor.

Gloria Bloom moved back in with her parents and continued her education. In 1963, she earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English, graduating with honors. Over strong objections from her professor, she wrote her honors thesis on black writers. She was employed in a number of occupations before she decided to become a teacher, taking a position at Benjamin Franklin High School. She began work on a graduate degree at New York University, where she became interested in the civil rights movement. After earning a master&#x27;s degree, she became a teacher and, in 1966, moved to Los Angeles, where she resided in Watts. She worked for the Los Angeles Teachers Association and taught at Jordan High School and Fremont High School.

In her autobiography she describes how, during a vacation in Acapulco in 1966, she was raped at gunpoint. She discovered she was pregnant and sought an abortion. Abortion was illegal at the time, so Allred had a back-alley abortion. After undergoing the procedure, she began hemorrhaging and became infected, only recovering after being hospitalized. She did not report the rape, she said, because she did not think anyone would believe her.

In 1968, she married William Allred. She enrolled in Southwestern University School of Law and later transferred to Loyola University School of Law at the Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. Allred graduated and was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1975. Allred divorced her husband in 1987, retaining her married name.

==Career==
===Legal===
In a legal career that has spanned five decades, Allred has represented a wide variety of clients in civil rights suits that have involved sexual harassment, women&#x27;s rights, wrongful termination, and employment discrimination. &quot;The New Republic&quot; has called her &quot;a longtime master of the press conference&quot;. She often takes high-profile cases, using press conferences and appearances on television to much effect. Allred has represented many clients in suits against celebrities, including those against Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Herman Cain, David Boreanaz, Scott Lee Cohen, Anthony Weiner, Sacha Baron Cohen, Esai Morales, and R. Kelly.

====1970s and 1980s====
Allred founded the firm Allred, Maroko, &amp; Goldberg with fellow Loyola graduates Michael Maroko and Nathan Goldberg in January 1976. In 1979, Allred represented seven children and their parents in a lawsuit against the Sav-On Drugstore chain to stop the store from designating separate sections for boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; toys. In 1981, while California State Senator John G. Schmitz was presiding over hearings on outlawing abortion, Allred presented him with a chastity belt. Schmitz retaliated in a press release, calling her a &quot;slick butch lawyeress&quot;. She sued him for libel, and eventually secured a settlement of $20,000 and an apology.

In 1985, Allred, along with Catharine MacKinnon, drafted a version of the Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance for Los Angeles County. The legislation failed to pass the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. In 1987, Allred took on the then all-male Friars Club of Beverly Hills, an exclusive private club, over its membership discrimination policies. The Friars Club eventually allowed Allred and five other women to use the club&#x27;s health facilities, after Allred displayed early skills in effective use of the media.

====1990s====
Allred wrote a letter to the Senate Ethics Committee in 1992 asking them to investigate the actions of Oregon Senator Bob Packwood, who had been the subject of a newspaper article that detailed his history of sexual harassment. She kept pressure on the Committee and urged Packwood to release his diaries. The Committee eventually voted for his expulsion, and he resigned.

In 1983, Allred represented lesbian activists Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rolón in their lawsuit against the owner of a Los Angeles restaurant, Papa Choux, after he denied them service in a booth reserved for &quot;romantic couples&quot;. While the lower court denied the two an injunction based on unlawful discrimination, the appellate court reversed the decision in &quot;Rolon v. Kulwitzky&quot; (1984), finding that the restaurant&#x27;s behavior was discrimination prohibited under the Los Angeles Municipal Code. Rather than serve LGBT couples, the restaurant decided to eliminate the booths altogether, and took out newspaper ads inviting the public to a &quot;Wake for Romance&quot; event.

In 1995, Allred represented 11-year-old Katrina Yeaw in &quot;Yeaw v. Boy Scouts of America&quot;, a suit against the Boy Scouts of America to determine whether the organization had the right to exclude girls from membership. That same year, she represented Nicole Brown Simpson&#x27;s family during the O. J. Simpson murder trial. In August 1997, she represented model Kelly Fisher when she sued Dodi Fayed for allegedly breaking off their engagement to begin his highly publicized relationship with Diana, Princess of Wales. The suit was dropped not long after Diana and Fayed died in Paris that August.

Allred represented &quot;Melrose Place&quot; actress Hunter Tylo in 1997 when producer Aaron Spelling fired her because she was pregnant. A jury awarded Tylo $4.8 million. The case was important in establishing the rights of actors to continue work if they become pregnant.

====2000s====
After pop singer Michael Jackson held his son over a hotel balcony in Berlin in 2002, Allred wrote a letter to California&#x27;s Child Protective Services, asking for an investigation into the safety of Jackson&#x27;s children, and spoke on CNN about the subject. She also briefly represented Jordan Chandler in 1993 whose father had accused Jackson of sexual abuse. Allred also represented 18-year-old Daniel Kapon, who claimed that Jackson had molested him when he was a child. The Kapon case was dismissed because Kapon&#x27;s father confirmed that Kapon had never met Jackson. Jackson, who an advisor said could be a bit paranoid, reportedly kept an &quot;enemy list&quot; on which Allred appeared, along with Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, illusionist Uri Geller, music executive Tommy Mottola, DA Tom Sneddon, and Janet Arvizo, mother of a Jackson accuser. The source of this allegation was Dieter Wiesner whom Jackson fired and who at that time was suing him for $64 million.

Later in 2002, Allred represented the family of Gwen Araujo, a transgender teen who was brutally beaten to death when it was learned that she had been assigned male at birth.

In 2004, Allred represented Amber Frey when Frey was a witness in the criminal case against Scott Peterson for the murder of his wife Laci Peterson. On February 24, 2004, Allred and her law firm, Allred, Maroko, and Goldberg, filed the first lawsuit in California challenging the denial of marriage licenses for same-sex couples as being unconstitutional. She took the case pro bono for Robin Tyler and Diane Olson and Rev. Troy Perry and his spouse Phillip Ray De Blieck. The case went to the California Supreme Court, where on May 15, 2008 she won a decision affirming the right of same-sex couples to marry in California. She represented three former Circuit City employees on behalf of a large plaintiff class in an age discrimination lawsuit against that company after it fired 3,400 workers nationwide in April 2007.

In a March 2008 complaint against the TSA, Allred represented a client who was given pliers and told to remove her nipple rings at a Lubbock, Texas, airport. In April 2008, it was reported that she had been hired by the family of the teenager who had been beaten and filmed by eight Florida teenagers. She also appeared on &quot;Today&quot; with Jessica Gibson, who was counter-suing Rob Lowe for sexual harassment.

On July 30, 2008, Allred filed a complaint with federal regulators against Downey Savings and Loan Association regarding check-cashing procedures. Marc Retmier, a 19-year-old US Navy Hospitalman, was killed in action in Afghanistan in June 2008. Downey Savings refused to immediately cash his family&#x27;s military bereavement checks, and family members were compelled to seek funding elsewhere to pay for his funeral services.

In May 2009, Allred filed a suit arguing that Nadya Suleman was exploiting her octuplets. Allred asked for a court-appointed guardian, claiming that Suleman was not properly taking their interests into consideration. In December of the same year Allred was retained by Rachel Uchitel after media sources alleged that Uchitel had been having an affair with married golfer Tiger Woods. Allred also represented Joslyn James, a pornographic actress and Woods&#x27;s alleged mistress.

====2010s====
On May 14, 2010, in a news conference held at Allred&#x27;s office, English actress Charlotte Lewis alleged that director Roman Polanski had sexually abused her in his Paris apartment when she was 16. In June 2010, she was hired by Debrahlee Lorenzana, a former bank employee who had drawn wide public attention after alleging that she had been fired for being too attractive. In August 2010, Allred represented Jodie Fisher, whose sexual harassment claim revealed expense-account irregularities that led to the resignation of HP CEO Mark Hurd.

Allred was visible in the 2010 California gubernatorial race, going public as the lawyer for Nicky Diaz, a former domestic worker for Republican nominee Meg Whitman. Allred contended that Whitman employed Diaz for years while knowing that Diaz was an undocumented immigrant.

On April 27, 2011, Allred appeared at a press conference with the family of Justin Quinn, who was allegedly threatened at a San Francisco Giants baseball game by Braves coach Roger McDowell. Quinn had objected to McDowell&#x27;s uttering of homophobic slurs and use of a baseball bat to simulate a sex act in the presence of his daughters.

On October 18, 2011, Allred won court approval to represent nine former cocktail waitresses who were fired from their jobs at Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey after they &quot;did not look good enough&quot; in new uniforms modeled after 1920s-era Flapper outfits. Resorts had sought to bar Allred from the discrimination lawsuit, arguing in court papers that her &quot;flamboyant and headline-grabbing antics&quot; would add nothing to the case.

On March 9, 2012, Allred called for an investigation into whether radio host Rush Limbaugh should be prosecuted in Florida under a 19th-century law against &quot;maliciously imputing to [any woman] a want of chastity&quot; for derogatory remarks he made regarding Sandra Fluke, who testified before House Democrats to advocate for free birth control. Allred commented: &quot;Mr. Limbaugh targeted his attack on a young law student who was simply exercising her free speech and her right to testify before congress on a very important issue to millions of American women and he vilified her. ... He needs to face the consequences of his conduct in every way that is meaningful.&quot; Allred did not represent Fluke or have contact with her at the time of her remarks nor did the prosecutor&#x27;s office respond to request for comment.

Also in 2012, Allred took on the case of Jenna Talackova, a Canadian transgender woman who was challenging her disqualification from the Miss Universe Canada pageant for not being a &quot;naturally born&quot; female. The Miss Universe organization ultimately reversed its decision before the case proceeded to the courts. In June 2012 Allred confirmed that she was representing a former girlfriend of Rudy Eugene, the now-deceased cannibal of the 2012 Miami cannibalism incident.

On October 4, 2013, Allred was hired by the wife of critically injured motorcyclist Edwin Mieses, who was run over by Alexian Lien during the Hollywood Stuntz gang assault. Lien ran over Mieses with his SUV while Lien was being surrounded and threatened by Mieses and his motorcycle gang on Manhattan&#x27;s West Side Highway. Fellow bikers later caught up with Lien and assaulted him. Allred told the press that Mieses, who suffered spinal injuries and two broken legs, was an &quot;innocent victim&quot; who was trying to &quot;defuse the situation&quot;.

, Allred was representing at least 28 women who accuse Bill Cosby of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and/or other sexual misconduct. She also represented three women who accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct—claims which Trump has denied, and which first arose during Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign.

In 2017, former Allred client Kyle Hunter filed official complaints with both the State Bar of California and the District of Columbia Bar, alleging conflict of interest because Allred was in negotiations with CBS at the same time she was representing him in a lawsuit against CBS for employment discrimination. Allred issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and claiming the investigation was sparked by a failed extortion attempt.

On November 11, 2017, Allred held a press conference representing her client, Beverly Young Nelson, as Nelson made a statement alleging sexual assault by Roy Moore when she was 16.

In 2019, &quot;New York Times&quot; reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey discussed the ways in which Allred and her firm profited from non-disclosure agreements that they negotiated, which silenced victims of sexual misconduct through &quot;secret settlements&quot; and &quot;bur[ied] allegations of sexual harassment and assault&quot;. Allred&#x27;s practice negotiated non-disclosures for a victim of Harvey Weinstein, and victims of Fox News host Bill O&#x27;Reilly and Olympics gymnastics physician Larry Nassar. Allred was vocal in her dislike of a proposed 2017 California bill that would ban non-disclosure clauses in agreements that silence victims of sexual harassment or assault.

==== 2020s ====
In February 2020, Allred hired an American-style school bus to encourage Prince Andrew to respond to the FBI about the sexual misconduct allegations surrounding him. The school bus was covered with an advertisement and placed outside of Buckingham Palace, and included photographs of the Duke of York and a message urging him to answer questions surrounding the controversy.

In 2021, Allred represented several victims who accused R&amp;B singer R. Kelly of sexually abusing them. After Kelly was convicted of sexual crimes in September 2021, Allred stated that Kelly was the worst sexual predator she had pursued in her 47-year law career.

In 2021, Allred represented Hannah Archuleta. In 2019, Dr. Phil allegedly pressured Archuleta&#x27;s father to send her to the Turn-About Ranch in Utah, and at the ranch, Archuleta was allegedly groped and sexually assaulted repeatedly by a male staff member. A judge dismissed the lawsuit, and the show countersued for legal costs.

In 2022, it was revealed that Allred refused to represent Efrosina &quot;Effie&quot; Angelova, who had accused actor Armie Hammer of raping her and sending her disturbing text messages in January 2021, after she &quot;wouldn&#x27;t sign a declaration under perjury [regarding] her accusations.&quot;.

In 2024, Allred represented various individuals claiming to have been sexual assault victims of rapper and music producer Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs.

===Entertainment===
Allred co-hosted a radio talk show with Mark Taylor on KABC in Los Angeles for 14 years. She also served as a panelist on the 1990 revival of television game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. On March 28, 2000, Allred was parodied on the animated TV show &quot;Family Guy&quot;, by a character named &quot;Gloria Ironbox&quot;, voiced by Candice Bergen, in an episode titled &quot;I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar&quot;. Allred appears as herself in the 2001 film &quot;Rat Race&quot;. On May 21, 2001, she was parodied on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Behind the Laughter&quot;, portraying a lawyer at the family table for Lisa Simpson. On June 27, 2001, she was parodied on &quot;South Park&quot;&#x27;s episode &quot;Cripple Fight&quot;.

On September 12, 2011, Allred debuted into the courtroom television genre with &quot;We the People with Gloria Allred&quot;, a show using improv actors to reenact fictitious case scenarios. In April 2013, Allred appeared on the reality show &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; (episode &quot;The Final Three, Hunty&quot;), interviewing and advising the final three contestants on selling themselves as &quot;America&#x27;s Next Drag Superstar&quot;. On November 27, 2016, Allred appeared as herself on the Epix TV show &quot;Graves&quot;.

==Political life==
Allred founded (incorporated in 1978) and is currently president of the &quot;Women’s Equal Rights Legal Defense and Education Fund&quot; WERDLEF (&quot;Legal Momentum&quot;). In 1980, Allred held a fundraiser at Chippendales for WERLDEF.

Gloria Allred has been a member of the advisory board of Women&#x27;s Day-USA, a California charity dedicated to promoting observation and recognition of March 8 as International Women&#x27;s Day in the United States.

==Personal life==
Allred and her first husband, Peyton Huddleston Bray, Jr., were married in 1960, and divorced in 1962. She and her second husband, William Allred, married in 1968 and divorced in 1987. Her only child, Lisa Bloom, was born in 1961.

She is Jewish, but does not consider herself particularly religious.

==Criticism==
Allred&#x27;s public statements and behavior have resulted in criticism. In 2012, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described her as &quot;the ambulance chaser of feminism&quot; after she defended two men involved in a sexual battery lawsuit against actor John Travolta. &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; journalist Tricia Romano also labeled her as a &quot;publicity hound&quot;. &quot;The New Republic&quot; contributor Jeffrey Rosen also described Allred as &quot;a longtime master of the press conference&quot;.

Allred&#x27;s role, along with that of her daughter (attorney Lisa Bloom), in allegedly suppressing the voices of alleged victims of Harvey Weinstein was chronicled in Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey&#x27;s 2019 book &quot;She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement&quot;.

== Popular culture ==
In several episodes of musical comedy &quot;Glee&quot;, she was mentioned by character Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) to be her lawyer.

In the 2001 film &quot;Rat Race&quot;, she first appeared after the character Blaine Cody (Vince Vieluf) was about to step on a shot glass for a purported insurance scam. Instead, a hotel guest slips on the glass and Gloria Allred announces &quot;I saw the whole thing.&quot; Later in the film, character Enrico is run over by an ambulance driven by Zack, a medical supply driver; to the fear of the latter, Allred witnesses the accident and yells &quot;I saw the whole thing&quot;. And tells Zack and Enrico to stay put, she&#x27;ll be right there.

She also appeared in a brief fictional cameo as Lisa&#x27;s lawyer in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; season 11 mockumentary episode, &quot;Behind the Laughter&quot;.

In 2010, she was mentioned by Justin Bieber in the skit &quot;Lonely Teacher&quot; during Season 35 of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In early 2018, Netflix debuted a documentary about the life and work of Allred, &quot;Seeing Allred&quot;, from directors Roberta Grossman and Sophie Sartain.

In &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (season 2 episode 22 at 18:08), Lorelai Gilmore refers to her when talking to Christopher on the porch.

<text>Floriculture is the study of the efficient production of the plants that produce showy, colorful flowers and foliage for human enjoyment in human environments. It is a commercially successful branch of horticulture and agriculture found throughout the world. Efficient production practices have been developed over the years, for the hundreds of plant taxa used in the floral industry, increasing the overall knowledge of whole plant biology. Plant breeding and selection have produced tens of thousands of new genotypes for human use.

== Overview ==
Flowers are an important part of human society that are often used at times of joy and sadness, and as a part of everyday life. Flowers and plants may be indoors in a sunny window, as part of the landscape in the front yard or on the patio or deck in the back yard. People have been studying flowers and plants and their interaction with humans and how to produce these flowers and plants so all humans can enjoy them. Floriculture scientists throughout the world to do this work.

Floriculture crops include cut flowers and cut cultivated greens, bedding plants (garden flowers or annuals, and perennials, houseplants (foliage plants and flowering potted plants). These plants are produced in ground beds, flower fields or in containers in a greenhouse. Protected cultivation is often used because these plants have a high value to humans.

Flower crops are grown in simple to highly sophisticated ways. These crops can be grown in soil in farm fields or in field soil in inexpensive high tunnel greenhouses. For years, flowers were grown, seasonally for the specific crop, close to the market in Europe, North America and Asia. However, many crops of the floral industry have moved to a specific climate, typically in the mountains of South America, Africa and China, so certain plants can be grown year around where hand labor is available.

Protected horticulture (greenhouses) has developed simultaneously with the continued changes in the flower crops and markets. Floriculture is a major component of controlled-environment agriculture (CEA). Floriculture crops have a high value to humans, so the cost of an expensive production system - greenhouses, automated environmental control, automated irrigation and fertilization, robotic seed, transplant and container handling, supplemental photosynthetic lighting - is necessary to produce these plants efficiently for the world-wide markets. Some are irrigated manually, but most are irrigated with drip irrigation, boom irrigation or flood floors. Hydroponics can be used for many cut flower crops.

== Floriculture value 2022 ==
The global Floriculture market size is estimated to be worth US$50040 million in 2022 and is forecast to be a readjusted size of US$58030 million by 2028 with a compound annual growth rate of 2.5% during the review period.

The total wholesale value of sales across all U.S. floriculture crops totaled US$6.69 billion in 2022 from 8,951 floriculture producers with a production area of 833 million square feet.

== Floriculture advancements ==
Plant enthusiasts and growers learned significant details about growing certain plants over the years. Chrysanthemums have been cultivated in China for over 3000 years, so growers knew about the plant and how to grow it. Floriculture scientists have simply continued this trend to control the plant&#x27;s environment to control flowering for the significant dates when humans want flowers for celebrations and gatherings.

=== Photoperiodism ===
Chrysanthemum was one of the plants used in experiments that led to the definitions of photoperiod and photoperiodism. Yet, it&#x27;s likely that Chinese, Korean and Japanese plantsmen had a good understanding based on their years of experience. The occurrence of this physiological response and the reasons for it have been the subject of many experiments at universities and in industry. Poinsettias are another short day plant with importance to flower growers. These and additional experiments and experience have shown that temperature has an impact on the photoperiodic response. Many cut flower and bedding plant species respond to long day or short day treatments for faster flowering. The use of lighting treatments to extend the day and black cloth treatments to shorten the day are important additions to floriculture to increase the efficiency of plant production.

=== Plant tissue culture, micropropagation ===
Plant propagation has always been a part of flower and plant gardening. Plant tissue culture began as a way to save orchid embryos as orchid fanciers bred new cultivars. Most horticulture and many botany programs in the world had scientists working on plant propagation through tissue culture techniques from the 1950s to the 1980s. These programs expanded the knowledge base on a wide range of taxa and allowed industry to find the connection to commercial production. Plant tissue culture allowed new, unique phenotypes and genotypes to be propagated in large numbers quickly. Many cultivars of foliage plants are available only from tissue culture. Uniquely, tissue cultured geraniums were heat treated to allow the identification and removal of many viruses, virus-indexed. As viruses were removed, many horticultural characteristics of the many cultivars disappeared; this led plant breeders to leave many viruses in breeding lines for future cultivars. Heat treatment of tissue culture of many taxa has since been used to remove bacteria and virus pathogens in various floriculture crops.

=== Containers and growing media ===

Containers of various kinds have been used in the culture of plants for a long time. Field soil or garden soil possibly with an addition of organic matter (compost) was placed in the container or pot and a plant was added followed by regular watering. It required experience and a watchful eye to prevent overwatering.

This success was tied to a relatively deep pot, usually 6–10 inches (15–25 cm) deep or larger. Gravity was sufficient to pull or drain water from the soil so an adequate portion of the soil in the pot was well drained and oxygen would be available to the root system. As US greenhouses began to expand the bedding plant business in the 1950s and 1960s, they needed smaller containers for the logistical aspects of plant spacing and shipping. Vacuum formed plastic trays and packs offered the smaller sizes but composted field soil was easy to overwater in the smaller containers. The first step was to add peat moss and perlite to the field soil in a 1:1:1 ratio. The next step was to use other materials, sphagnum moss peat and vermiculite, in a 1:1 ratio, the Cornell peat-lite mix. In the 1970s, more materials were used for growing media by the companies formed to process and distribute growing media to operations across the country. The physical properties of all the products had to be evaluated on a standard basis to make wise choices with economic decisions the operations were making. As plug (young plant) production, mechanization of seed germination and mechanization of transplanting, began in the 1980s more work was necessary to manage the small volume of growing media in plug trays. Research continues of all aspects of growing media and container design.

The harvest and use of peat for growing media remains an environmental issue in North America and Europe. Alternative and more sustainable materials continue to be added to growing media processing - pine bark, processed pine bark, coco coir, wood fiber, etc. Sustainable solutions for growing media materials remain a high priority for the industry.

=== Pesticide residues ===
Pesticide residues remain a significant issue for floriculture crops. Many countries have limited controls on pesticide usage but flower handlers and consumers could be contaminated by the residue.

The impact of certain pesticides, neonics, on bees and other pollinators has become a significant concern. The application of these pesticides on garden flowers during greenhouse production can have a major impact on pollinator populations in a consumer&#x27;s garden.

Research continues on biological control of greenhouse insect, mite and plant pathogens to reduce pesticide use in floriculture crop production.

=== Supplemental lighting ===
Supplemental lighting for flower crops began with photoperiod treatments and interest expanded to determine whether artificial light from electric lamps could substitute for sunlight during winter conditions. Incandescent lamps were not successful, so floriculture had to wait for lighting technology to improve. Advancements with fluorescent lamps and industrial lamps (mercury vapor, high pressure sodium, low pressure sodium, etc.) led to improved plant production for geraniums, roses and other crops. In the following decades, artificial lighting became standard practice in Europe, North America and Japan.

Work was completed to standardize a plant&#x27;s need for light (radiant energy) from natural and artificial sources. The term daily light integral (DLI) was introduced as a measurement of the optimal amount of radiant energy each plant requires for optimal growth.

The introduction of light emitting diode (LED) lamps offered more opportunities for supplemental lighting. These lamps were more efficient at light production, cooler and allowed the manipulation of light quality from different wavelengths of light compared to other lamps.

Supplemental lighting has been used to optimize production of seedlings, bedding plants, cut flowers and other crops.

=== Plant nutrition, water quality and irrigation ===
Flower crops were grown in field soil like all horticultural and agricultural crops. Nutrients important to the flowers were held in the soil matrix and supplemented with additions of organic matter and animal manure. These organic additions were labor-intensive and inconsistent, reducing the ability to optimize flower production. Floriculture moved to growing media and inorganic fertilizer products in the 1950s and 1960s as container production became more important. This move was supported by hydroponic research more than soil science research. The &quot;soil-less&quot; nature of hydroponics was more similar to the &quot;soil-less&quot; nature of growing media.

<text>The Historic Lobo Theater is a movie theater, concert venue, and cocktail lounge located along historic Route 66, at 3013 Central Avenue NE in Albuquerque, New Mexico in the United States of America.

The Lobo Theater first opened on August 19, 1938. By the early-1940’s it was operated by Paramount Pictures Inc. through their subsidiary Hoblitzelle &amp; O&#x27;Donnell. The name &quot;Lobo&quot; (&quot;Wolf&quot; in Spanish) references the nickname for the sports teams, and students, at the University of New Mexico, which is nearly adjacent to the west. The theater reached out to area students and was a premiere venue for independent, classic and cult films. It also hosted concerts with local bands.

It was the primary setting for the 2002 independent film &quot;Collecting Rooftops&quot;, which started being filmed while the theater was under Bobby (Robert) McMullan&#x27;s operation and finished its filming, in the theater, by the generosity of Amon Re (musician).

The Historic Lobo Theater reopened in late 2021 as the Lobo Lounge and Event Venue. (Website https://loboabq.com/)

<text>Original Tommy&#x27;s, previously known as Original Tommy&#x27;s World Famous Hamburgers, is a fast food hamburger restaurant chain in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. It is known for its hamburgers and chili burgers.

==History==
The original location was opened on May 15, 1946, by Tom Koulax (October 26, 1918 - May 28, 1992), the son of Greek immigrants, on the northeast corner of Beverly and Rampart boulevards west of downtown Los Angeles. The stand, which still exists today, sold hamburgers and hot dogs topped with chili. Initially, the business was slow but it soon started to pick up. During the 1960s, the entire lot at the intersection was purchased. Soon after, the northwest corner was acquired for expanded parking and storage of goods. Not long after that, a second service counter occupying the building at the perimeter of the northeast lot was set up.

Tommy&#x27;s grew to 30 locations by 2006. Most Original Tommy&#x27;s restaurants are found in the Greater Los Angeles Area. In recent years several locations have closed. The Santa Monica location was closed on April 20, 2014, when the landlord refused to renew the lease and leased the location to Starbucks instead.

In 2008, the company expanded for the first time outside of California by opening two locations in Clark County, Nevada. A third Nevada location was opened in 2013.

As of March 2023, there are 32 locations. The company is based in Monrovia, California, after years of being in Glendale, California, and is run by the late Mr. Koulax&#x27;s family.

<text>is a district in Taitō, Tokyo. The area extending from Ueno to Asakusa is part of the historical Shitamachi (literally &quot;low city&quot;) district of Tokyo, which is often associated with working-class traditions and culture as well as their distinct accent. The district&#x27;s name roughly translates into &quot;Upper Field&quot; in english.

The Ueno area, in the strict sense, centres around Ueno Station, which has historically been the terminus for long-distance trains bound for northern Japan, such as the Blue trains and the Shinkansen. To the north, Ueno Park stretches to the area just behind the University of Tokyo&#x27;s Hongo Campus. Ueno Park houses some of Tokyo&#x27;s finest cultural sites, including the Tokyo National Museum, the National Museum of Western Art, the National Museum of Nature and Science, and a major public concert hall. Numerous Buddhist temples can also be found in the park, including the Bentendo, dedicated to the goddess Benzaiten, on an island in Shinobazu Pond. The Kan&#x27;ei-ji, a major temple for the Tokugawa shōguns, also stands in this area, with its pagoda now located within the grounds of Ueno Zoo. Nearby is Ueno Tōshō-gū, a Shinto shrine dedicated to Tokugawa Ieyasu. The International Library of Children&#x27;s Literature is also in the area.

To the south of the station lies Ameya-yokochō, a street market district that evolved from an open-air black market that sprang up during the privation following the Second World War, leading towards Okachimachi. Part of Ueno has also been known as a gay village since the Edo period, when the area had a large number of gay brothels.

==Economy==
Ueno is the hometown of Yoshida Watch Shop, established in 1901 by Shogoro Yoshida. It is the origin of Orient Watch Co., Ltd.

<doc id="893299" wikidata="Q2142103" url="?curid=893299" title="Volna">
<text>Space launch vehicle Volna (), is a converted submarine-launched ballistic missile used for launching satellites into orbit. It is based on the R-29R designed by State Rocket Center Makayev and related to the Shtil&#x27; Launch Vehicle. The Volna is a 3-stage launch vehicle that uses liquid propellant. The warhead section is used for the payloads that can be either put into orbit with the help of an additional boost engine or travel along a sub-orbital trajectory to be recovered at the landing site. Volna can be launched from Delta III-class submarine or from land based facilities.

== Performance ==
Because of its mobile launch platform the Volna launch vehicle can reach a large number of different inclinations and could increase its performance to low Earth orbit by launching from equatorial sites. All flights to date have taken place from the Barents Sea. From this site the Volna can lift into a high orbit with an inclination of 79°.
The warhead section can accommodate a payload of up to . For sub-orbital missions the payload can be either a recoverable vehicle of up to or research equipment placed in a descent vehicle of up to .

==Launch history==

*The first launch of the Volna took place on June 6, 1995 on a suborbital trajectory. The rocket was launched from a submarine in the Barents Sea, reached an apogee of 1250 km and the payload was recovered in Kamchatka, 5600 km from where it was launched. The payload of this flight was a thermal convection experiment, developed by Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity of Bremen University (Germany).
*On 20 July 2001 the second flight took place with a simplified (two-bladed) test vehicle of the Cosmos 1 solar sail of the Planetary Society and an inflatable re-entry heat shield. The Volna was launched from Delta III Submarine &quot;Borisoglebsk&quot; in the Barents Sea. Although the launch vehicle reached the intended suborbital trajectory the spacecraft failed to separate. The separation command was not issued by the flight software because of the presence of non-nominal variations. Failure of the Cosmos-1 to separate also resulted in the loss of the secondary payload, a new inflatable re-entry vehicle.
*On 12 July 2002 the Volna was used for a sub-orbital flight for a second attempt to test a new re-entry vehicle, IRDT-2. The launch took place from Delta III class submarine &quot;K-44 Ryazan&quot;. Due to a failure in the launcher/payload interface the vehicle was lost and did not land on the expected area on the Kamchatka peninsula. It is unclear whether the spacecraft separated from the third stage of the Volna and did not inflate correctly or that it remained attached to the payload module. Remains of the vehicle have not been found.
*The fourth flight took place at 21 June 2005 with on board the Cosmos 1 Solar sail. The launch took place from Delta III Submarine &quot;Borisoglebsk&quot; in the Barents Sea. The spacecraft failed to reach orbit after stage one shut down prematurely at 82.86 seconds instead of the expected 100 seconds. The failure was attributed to &quot;critical degradation in operational capability of the engine turbo-pump&quot;. The second and third stage did not separate and the payload did not reach orbit.
*On 6 October 2005 the Volna carried IRDT-2R on a sub-orbital trajectory, launched from Delta III Class Submarine &quot;Borisoglebsk&quot; in the Barents Sea. The launch vehicle performed nominally and placed the payload on a trajectory towards the Kamchatka peninsula. Trajectory data shows that the vehicle most likely overshot the landing site and could not be recovered.

<doc id="893301" wikidata="Q239366" url="?curid=893301" title="Christine Gregoire">
<text>Christine Gregoire (; née O&#x27;Grady; born March 24, 1947) is an American politician who served as the 22nd governor of Washington from 2005 to 2013. A member of the Democratic Party, she defeated Republican candidate Dino Rossi in 2004, and again in 2008. She is the state’s second female governor, and the state’s first female attorney general. Gregoire served as chair of the National Governors Association from 2010 to 2011. She also served on the governors&#x27; council of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C.

==Early life, education, and legal career==
Gregoire was born in Adrian, Michigan but was raised in Auburn, Washington, by her mother, Sybil Grace Jacobs (née Palmer), who worked as a short-order cook. After graduating from Auburn Senior High School, she attended the University of Washington in Seattle, graduating in 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts in speech and sociology. At UW, she became a member of the Sigma Iota chapter of the Kappa Delta sorority. She then attended Gonzaga University School of Law in Spokane, receiving her Juris Doctor in 1977.

Gregoire went to work as an assistant attorney general in the office of State Attorney General Slade Gorton, a Republican. As an assistant attorney general, Gregoire concentrated on child-abuse cases, coordinating with social workers to get children removed from abusive family situations and placed with relatives or foster homes, and was later appointed as the first female Deputy Attorney General. In 1988, at the end of his first term as governor of Washington, Booth Gardner appointed Gregoire director of the Washington Department of Ecology. During her tenure, Gregoire worked with Gardner to reach an agreement with the federal government to clean up nuclear waste at the Hanford nuclear site.

== Director of the Department of Ecology ==
Gregoire served four years as director before running for attorney general in 1992. During her tenure, she oversaw the creation of the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill Task Force. Following an oil spill off the coast of Washington and British Columbia involving the barge &quot;Nestucca&quot;, Gregoire coordinated with the Canadian government to form a task force to handle concerns West Coast citizens had surrounding oil transportation.

=== Hanford Cleanup ===
While at the Department of Ecology, Gregoire worked with Gardner and representatives from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Energy to coordinate efforts on the Hanford Site cleanup. Known by many names, including the Hanford Project, Hanford Works, Hanford Engineer Works, and Hanford Nuclear Reservation, the nuclear facility along the Columbia River in Benton County produced plutonium. The site, established in 1943 to provide support for the Manhattan Project, operated from World War II through the Cold War. Decades of production of plutonium resulted in millions of gallons of high-level radioactive waste.

In 1989, the Washington State Department of Ecology along with the EPA and the US Department of Energy (DOE) entered into the Tri-Party Agreement, which sets targets, or milestones, for cleanup.

=== Centennial Accord ===
Following the contentious US v Washington case related to Native American fishing rights, commonly known as the “Boldt Decision,” Gardner undertook to build more lasting, friendly relationships with Washington&#x27;s Native American tribes. The Accord served to bring parties to the table to negotiate their shared interests. Gregoire played a principal role in helping reach agreements about the natural resource distribution between the tribes and the state.

==Attorney General of Washington==
Gregoire was elected attorney general in 1992 by 11 percentage points over her opponent, Norm Maleng, an attorney who served and was reelected seven times as King County prosecutor. She was Washington&#x27;s first and only female attorney general. Gregoire was reelected in 1996 and 2000, both times over Richard Pope, by about 25 and 18 percentage points respectively.

As attorney general, Gregoire worked on children&#x27;s issues, helped reform the juvenile system, passed a new ethics law for state government, strengthened rights for victims of identity theft, and worked to find alternatives to litigation in resolving legal disputes.

=== Tobacco master settlement agreement ===
During Gregoire&#x27;s second term as attorney general, the tobacco industry was under fire for alleged fraudulent marketing, negligent advertising, and violation of several state consumer protection statutes. Multiple private suits stemming from a 1950s study in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; linked smoking to lung cancer and heart disease. Attorneys General on June 20, 1997, led by Gregoire negotiated a settlement that required tobacco companies to pay more than $206 billion over 25 years in reimbursements to the states for tax dollars spent to treat Medicaid patients for smoking-related illnesses. The companies also agreed to pay $50 million to national attorneys general for enforcement.

These payments funded children&#x27;s health services and programs and a $25 billion trust for health-related issues. For her leading role in the litigation, Gregoire won the state of Washington a $4.5 billion share of the settlement over the next 25 years with the payments continuing in perpetuity. Gregoire and Governor Gary Locke asked the legislature to reserve portions of the settlement for restitution to the state and to establish a special account to finance a long-term tobacco prevention and control program. The account would be used to pay for anti-tobacco advertising and education, accessible cessation programs, and other activities.

In March 1999, Gregoire announced that Washington would receive at least an additional $394.9 million in settlement payments from the major tobacco companies.

Other portions of the agreement included enforcement of laws against tobacco sales to children, broad-based smoking prevention strategies, smoking cessation programs, full disclosure of tobacco&#x27;s health effects, and preservation of an individual&#x27;s right to sue the tobacco companies.

== Governor of Washington (2005–2013) ==
===2004 gubernatorial election===

Gregoire defeated Ron Sims and four other minor candidates in the Democratic primary election on September 14, 2004. She had come under fire during the primary for her membership in Kappa Delta because of its nonwhite membership policy in the late 1960s. She clashed with Sims over her position at the sorority, but Sims dropped the issue and dismissed any claims of racism. Sims campaigned on tax reform and the institution of a statewide income tax. Gregoire won the primary with over 60% of the vote.

During the general election against former state senator and real estate agent Dino Rossi, Gregoire proposed a major initiative in life sciences, especially by increasing state funding for embryonic stem cell research. In debates, she tried to counter voter unease about the state government by saying she would &quot;blow past the bureaucracy&quot; and bring change herself. Gregoire won the backing of the legislature within six months after pushing through a number of important measures on car emission standards and unemployment benefits.

The election was held on November 2, 2004, with the initial count showing Gregoire trailing Rossi by 261 votes. A legally mandated machine recount reduced that lead to only 42 votes, then a hand count requested and funded by the state&#x27;s Democratic Party gave Gregoire a 10-vote lead. Following a State Supreme Court ruling that allowed several hundred ballots from King County to be included, her lead further increased to 130 votes, but when the vote was certified by the state&#x27;s Secretary of State, Sam Reed, at the end of December, one vote that had been counted in Thurston County past the deadline was disqualified and her lead was reduced to 129 votes. Washington&#x27;s Republican leadership then filed suit, claiming that hundreds of votes, including votes by felons, deceased voters, and double voters, had been counted, but on June 6, 2005, Judge John E. Bridges ruled that the Republican Party had not provided enough evidence that the disputed votes were ineligible—or for whom they were cast—to overturn the election.

On October 28, 2004, the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; reported that out-of-state donors were contributing heavily to Gregoire&#x27;s campaign. Trial lawyers who had worked closely with Gregoire on the 1998 tobacco settlement gave the Democratic Governors Association more than $1,000,000. According to the &quot;Times&quot;&#x27;s analysis, nearly half of Gregoire&#x27;s 2004 campaign contributions came from out of state.

===2008 gubernatorial election===

During the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton heavily lobbied Gregoire for her endorsement as a superdelegate.

Gregoire officially endorsed Obama on February 8, 2008, hours before an event at KeyArena in Seattle where she introduced him before a crowd of 18,000 people. The Washington caucuses were held the next day; Obama beat Clinton in every county.

Gregoire began her reelection campaign at her late mother&#x27;s former employer, the Rainbow Café in Auburn, Washington, on April 7, 2008. Immediately after her announcement, she began a biodiesel bus tour of the state. Her opponent in the race, Dino Rossi, had announced his candidacy in October 2007.

Gregoire and Rossi fast approached fundraising records early in their campaigns. In April, Gregoire hosted a fundraiser with Bill Richardson at the Seattle Westin that netted the campaign over $300,000. In July, she held another large fundraiser with Michelle Obama at the WaMu Theater, with 1,600 attendees raising over $400,000.

The &quot;Seattle Times&quot; reported that Gregoire gave cost-of-living increases to state employees who hadn&#x27;t received raises in &quot;many years&quot;, and funded voter-approved initiatives to raise the pay of teachers, all groups that gave money to her 2004 recount campaign.

Gregoire won Washington&#x27;s first ever top two primary on August 19, 2008, with 49% of the vote. She advanced to the general election against Rossi. The general election was expected to be close, but Gregoire benefited from large turnout among Democrats to vote for Obama in the concurrent presidential election and won with 53% of the vote. There was a marked geographical split in the 2008 election: the more populous and Democratic-leaning Western Washington counties supported Gregoire, while the less populous and more Republican-leaning Eastern Washington counties supported Rossi.

=== Reform areas ===

==== Education ====
During her time in office, Gregoire made sweeping changes to Washington&#x27;s education system in areas such as the state government&#x27;s responsibility in providing education, college readiness, expansion of early learning programs, as well as introducing new government-accountable educational goals.

Beginning her work with education months after taking office, Gregoire signed a host of bills in May 2005 to improve the state of education from early learning through college across the state. One such bill, E2SHB 1152 established an Early Learning Council dedicated to providing leadership in strengthening early learning programs and services available to children and their families. As a result of the Early Learning Council&#x27;s work, Gregoire lobbied for the creation of a Department of Early Learning. On March 28, 2006, Gregoire signed into law a measure she had requested that consolidated Washington&#x27;s scattered early learning and child-care programs into the Department of Early Learning.

Included in this 2005 package of education bills was Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5441. Introduced at Gregoire&#x27;s request to establish a comprehensive education study steering committee, the legislature passed E2SSB 5441. It created a 13-member body to evaluate and reimagine Washington&#x27;s education system for the modern economy. The group, chaired by Gregoire and comprising members representing business, government, philanthropy, the education committee, the legislature, and the public, met consistently for 18 months. It released a report in November 2006. It focused on five basic strategies to reform Washington&#x27;s education system: (1) investing in early learning so that children start off as lifelong learners; (2) improving math and science teaching so that Washingtonians have a competitive edge; (3) personalizing learning so that every student has the opportunity to succeed; (4) offering college and workforce training for everyone; and (5) holding the system accountable for results.

Gregoire announced major education reforms that included developing criteria and standards for teacher evaluation, setting school performance requirements, and expanding teacher certification options. She signed the package into law.

In an ongoing effort to reform higher education in Washington, Gregoire asked the Higher Education Funding Task Force to look at college funding and performance options. On the task force&#x27;s recommendation, on June 6, 2011, Gregoire signed into law several bills to improve Washington&#x27;s education system. Additionally, on December 13, Gregoire proposed further education reforms to evaluate teachers and principals and designate six failing schools as “laboratory schools” to help improve student performance. She passed and signed those into law on March 8, 2012.

==== Public health ====
Washington was one of the first states to tackle rising health care and insurance costs. Gregoire proposed major health care reforms including changes in how the state purchased health care, consolidating state health care spending, and streamlining purchasing practices. As part of the reforms, Gregoire implemented a Health Care Cabinet to ensure the state was ready. She announced, “Washington is going to lead the nation in implementing health care reform.” Through the Health Insurance Partnership, Gregoire extended health care coverage to 1,100 small-business employees. She announced legislation to modernize the state&#x27;s health care and pension system, while keeping health care inflation at 4-5% year. She announced “the promise of reform is a day when no one goes without health care coverage.

Gregoire pushed SB 5093, Washington State’s Cover All Kids Law, in March 2007. Advancing from this action, in 2009 Gregoire and the state legislature strengthened coverage during the financial crisis by passing HB 2128, the Apple Health For Kids Act.

On May 11, 2011, Gregoire signed six bills to transform Washington’s health care system. They included creation of a health care exchange to limit health care inflation to 4% over 10 years, saving citizens $26 billion in health care costs, and legislation consolidating the state’s two largest health care purchasers to make care programs more effective.

On January 13, 2012, Gregoire filed an amicus brief in support of the Affordable Care Act. On March 23 she created one of the nation’s first health benefit exchanges, giving buyers information on health care plans.

===== Affordable Care Act =====
Concurrently, as Gregoire made reforms in the state, she led implementation of the Federal Affordable Care Act. The ACA required the formation of a health insurance exchange in each state either by the federal government or the state. With an emphasis on extending health insurance coverage to low-income residents, Gregoire signed ESSB 5445 into law on May 11, 2011, making Washington the fourth state to implement the health insurance exchange provision.

Gregoire also signed ESSB 5122 and ESSB 5371 to conform state law with the ACA by extending insurance coverage to dependents under the age of 26, removing lifetime benefit maximums, and preventing insurance companies from denying coverage to people because of preexisting conditions.

===== Environment =====
Gregoire said she wanted to clean up Puget Sound by making it more “fishable, swimmable and diggable”. In 2007 she created the Puget Sound Partnership. The agency sets science-based priorities, spurs implementation of priority actions and ensures accountability.

On May 21, 2009, Gregoire issued an Executive Order directing state actions to cut greenhouse gases and battle climate change by increasing transportation and fuel-conservation options and protecting water supplies and vulnerable coastal areas.

On April 29, 2011, Gregoire fulfilled a longstanding goal and signed legislation that transitioned Washington state off of coal power. The announcement was made at the TransAlta coal plant.

==== Tribal relations ====
In October 2005, Gregoire sent a letter to the state&#x27;s Gambling Commission recommending that it renegotiate a compact with the Spokane Native American tribe it had submitted for approval. The original compact would have allowed the tribe, and any other tribe that signed on to the compact, to have off-reservation gambling facilities, increase the number of slot machines allowed to 7,500, operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, remove betting limits for some card players, and give credits to high rollers in exchange for sharing their gambling winnings with state and local governments. It was opposed by many of the state&#x27;s lawmakers of both parties and anti-gambling groups that were concerned about the spread of gambling across the state, as well as other Native American tribes. The renegotiated compact, which was signed by the Spokane and 26 other Washington tribes, was signed by Gregoire in early 2007 and eliminated the revenue sharing and off-reservation facilities, but included an increase of allowed slot machines to 4,700 with a limit of 2,000 per location, increased the betting limit of some of its slot machines to $20, and allowed high-stakes gambling on blackjack and poker tables to players who pass financial screening and aren&#x27;t known problem gamblers. The tribe also agreed to donate 2% of the gross revenue from table games and 1% from gambling devices to charity.

==== LGBT rights ====
A landmark gay civil rights bill failed in the 2005 session but passed in the 2006 session. It was primarily responsible for expanding the scope of protected classes to include sexual orientation and gender identity in cases of discrimination. The bill was originally requested and subsequently signed by Gregoire on January 31, 2006. She also signed a law on April 21, 2007, granting same-sex couples domestic partnership rights.

Gregoire signed Senate Bill 5688 ensuring state-registered domestic partners have the same rights as married spouses, further extending rights to LGBTQ+ Washingtonians. Opponents gathered signatures to put 2009 Washington Referendum 71 on the ballot in an attempt to repeal the bill. Washington voters approved the measure 53% to 47% in the country&#x27;s first statewide referendum to extend domestic partnership rights to LGBT citizens.

On January 4, 2012, Gregoire announced her support for same-sex marriage and pledged to sign a marriage bill if it were passed by the legislature. The bill was passed on February 8, 2012. Gregoire signed the bill on February 13. Opponents of the bill collected the necessary signatures to place it Referendum 74 on the November ballot, where it was approved by 53.7% of the voters. The law took effect December 6.

==== Transportation ====
In March 2006, Gregoire&#x27;s requested bill, SB 6508, was signed into law. The law directly affected transportation fuels by requiring fuel suppliers to ensure that 2% of the diesel and 2% of the gasoline they provide for sale is biodiesel and ethanol as of December 2008. The measure was the nation&#x27;s first requirement for alternative fuels.

In 2009, Gregoire led public and political support to build two of the nation&#x27;s largest infrastructure projects, replacement of the 520 floating bridge and a plan to replace the aging and earthquake vulnerable State Route 99 Alaskan Way Viaduct with a deep bore tunnel. At the time, the tunnel was the world&#x27;s largest deep bore tunnel project. The 520 floating bridge is the world&#x27;s longest floating bridge and opened in 2016. Seattle&#x27;s new waterfront tunnel opened in 2019, making way for a revitalized new waterfront.

Bridging transportation and the environment in 2010, Gregoire announced the nation&#x27;s first “electric highway,” an initial network of electric vehicle recharging stations along the I-5 corridor. Additionally, she used more than $13 million in Recovery Act grants to help train Washington workers for “green-collar” jobs in energy efficiency and renewable energy industries.

Along with Oregon Governor Kitzhaber, Gregoire announced support for the Columbia River Crossing to replace the aging I-5 bridge connecting Washington and Oregon.

Gregoire signed the 2011–2013 transportation budget putting 30,000 people to work and investing $5.6 billion into more than 800 transportation construction projects.

==== Medical marijuana ====
Together with Governor Lincoln Chaffee (I-RI), on November 30, 2011, Gregoire filed a petition with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) asking to reschedule marijuana as a Schedule 2 drug, allowing its use for treatment as prescribed by doctors and filled by pharmacists.

==== Life Sciences Discovery Fund ====
On May 12, 2005, Gregoire signed a bill creating the Life Sciences Discovery Fund, which gives grants for research in health and agriculture. With funding from the tobacco settlement, which Gregoire secured, the state was able to combine funds with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Microsoft, the Paul G. Allen Family foundation and others to impact research on cures for debilitating diseases and improvement of the quality and yield of agricultural products.

==== Aerospace ====
In 2009 Gregoire set out to increase Washington&#x27;s aerospace focus. By singling out Boeing and looking at working with local businesses, schools, and unions, Gregoire formed the Aerospace Council, which was tasked with developing aerospace-skills training, research and development.

As home to global aerospace, with more than 84,000 aerospace employees and more than 650 aerospace supply companies, Gregoire commended Boeing on the completion and delivery of its first 787 Dreamliner in Seattle.

=== Government reforms ===
On June 15, 2011, Gregoire signed the 2011–2013 budget taking into account the ideas presented by the public and the Transforming Washington&#x27;s Budget Committee. Changes included a reform to the pension system saving $368 million in the following two years and setting up a user-pay system for state parks and other services.

On September 30, 2011, Gregoire completed the most significant transformation of state government in 20 years, merging five agencies into three, saving taxpayers $18.3 million. As a further $2 billion deficit loomed, Gregoire launched a further package of reforms to continue to cut costs. On December 3, 2011, Gregoire announced that the government reform measures saved businesses more than $450 million in unemployment taxes and workers’ compensation rates.

==== Great Recession ====

As the Great Recession began to impact states across the U.S. Gregoire announced the &quot;Washington Jobs Now&quot; package to provide economic stimulus and job creation. As the economic slowdown put Washingtonians out of work, she increased unemployment benefits and supported the Federal Recovery Act efforts by identifying shovel-ready projects to put people to work and make investments in communities and infrastructure. As signs of the Great Recession worsened, Gregoire announced additional measures to reform state government. As part of her 21st Century Government Reform Initiative she set out to streamline government, eliminate 17 boards and commissions, and reduce another 78. She also introduced legislation to reduce or eliminate a third of 64 small Cabinet agencies through mergers or realignments. Additionally, she signed a budget anticipating a potential $9 billion shortfall and reduced spending.

In January 2010 Gregoire released a 10-point plan to accelerate recovery and create as many as 40,000 jobs over the next three years. As the most trade dependent state in the nation, and as a way to more quickly emerge from the Great Recession, Gregoire also announced the Washington Export Initiative to expand the state&#x27;s export opportunities and create jobs. As the Great Recession deepened, Gregoire announced plans to cut costs and streamline government by reducing state agencies from 21 to nine, saving $30 million. She also reached an agreement with state unions to reduce state employees’ pay by 3%.

To continue to help spur economic recovery, Gregoire emphasized small businesses as job creators and eased administrative burdens for them and local governments by Executive Order. As part of a significant and unprecedented overhaul of Workers’ Compensation reforms, she passed a bill to save $200 million over four years and increase outcomes for workers and employers. To emphasize Washington&#x27;s role in global trade, Gregoire led a delegation of automotive, life-science, aerospace and education leaders to Europe on her sixth trade mission. She also led a trade mission to China and Japan.

==Post-gubernatorial career==
Gregoire&#x27;s term ended in January 2013 and her official portrait was painted by artist Michele Rushworth.

Gregoire was reportedly considered by the Obama administration for a position in either the State Department or the Department of the Interior, but was not chosen.
After leaving office, Gregoire became a public speaker, notably speaking with former Oregon governor Ted Kulongoski at the Emerging Local Government Leaders in October 2013.
On July 1, Gregoire began a term as a board member for the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Larry Corey, an M.D. and the director of the Hutchinson Center commented, &quot;As governor, Chris Gregoire was a visionary leader and advocate of biomedical research. Under her watch she proposed a major initiative in the life sciences. Gregoire will be instrumental in helping to shine a spotlight on the lifesaving work of the Hutchinson Center and how it contributes to the health and well-being of people throughout the state and the world.&quot;

From August to December 2014, Gregoire took a position as a Fall Fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School in Harvard Square, where she spent time engaging with students at the school about leadership in various positions of government.

=== Challenge Seattle ===
After taking time away from public life following her governorship, Gregoire coordinated with several business and community leaders to found Challenge Seattle, an alliance of CEOs from 18 of the region&#x27;s largest employers. Launched in 2015, Challenge Seattle, with Gregoire as its CEO, focuses on improving the Cascadia Innovation Corridor, education, middle-income housing affordability, and transportation projects.

==Personal life==
Gregoire&#x27;s first child, Courtney, was born in Spokane in 1979. In 2013, Courtney was appointed to the Seattle Port Commission. Courtney has 2 children, Audrey and Alexa. Her second daughter, Michelle, was born in 1984. When not in Olympia, Gregoire lives in nearby Lacey with her husband, Michael.

In 2003, she was diagnosed with breast cancer in an early stage after a routine check-up and a mammogram. She had surgery and recovered. She mentions her fight with cancer in speeches about health care.

==Awards==
In 2007, Gregoire was named one of &quot;Governing&quot; magazines “Public Officials of the Year”

In 2009, Gregoire received a sort of tongue-in-cheek Fuse &quot;Fizzle&quot; Award. The awards program is aimed at promoting leadership and accountability in the Washington State Legislature.

In 1995, Gregoire received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Gonzaga University. In 2012, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws after delivering the commencement speech at Washington State University. In 2015, she received an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Washington.

<text>Atwater Village is a neighborhood in the 13th district of Los Angeles, California. Much of Atwater Village lies in the fertile Los Angeles River flood plain. Located in the northeast region of the city, Atwater Village borders Griffith Park and Silver Lake to the west, Glendale to the north and east and Glassell Park to the south. The eastern boundary is essentially the railroad tracks (originally, the Southern Pacific). The area has three elementary schools—two public and one private. Almost half the residents were born abroad, a high percentage for the city of Los Angeles.

== History ==
Much of Northeastern Los Angeles was part of Rancho San Rafael, until 1868, when parts of it were purchased by W.C.B. Richardson, who renamed it Rancho Santa Eulalia. The entire region was subdivided and sold to home builders in 1902, with the Atwater Village portion being named as such due to its proximity to the Los Angeles River. The area was initially named &quot;Atwater,&quot; while the &quot;Village&quot; was added in 1986.

Initial residents included the newly created middle-class workers employed at the nearby DWP substation. The location between the Los Angeles and Glendale city cores made it a highly sought after residential neighborhood beginning in the 1920s. The majority of homes and structures in Atwater Village have never been demolished (although many have changed in use or have been renovated), resulting in the neighborhood having one of the highest number of structures built before 1939 in Los Angeles County.

In recent years, the neighborhood has seen an increase in gentrification.

== Population ==
=== 2013 findings ===

Census tracts 1883, 1881 and 1871.01 lie wholly within Atwater Village boundaries, and a large portion of census tract 1871.02 is also within Atwater Village. Here are the five-year findings as reported by American Community Survey in 2013:

Census tract 1883 had a median income of $31,111 and was 37.8% non-Hispanic white, 34.1% Hispanic, 20.2% Asian, 1.6% Pacific Islander and 1.1% black. Census tract 1871.01 had a median income of $72,526 and was 42.9% non-Hispanic white, 34.4% Hispanic, 21.2% Asian and 1.4% black. Census tract 1881 was 60.3% Hispanic, 23.9% non-Hispanic white, 13.2% Asian, 2% black and 1.3% American Indian or Alaska Native. Median income for this census tract was $30,996. Census tract 1871.02 was 47.9% Hispanic, 27.5% non-Hispanic white, 13.9% Asian and 8.4% black, with a median income of $24,852.

=== 2008 estimate ===

In 2008, the city estimated that 15,455 people lived in Atwater Village.

=== 2000 census ===

The 2000 U.S. census counted 14,888 residents in the 1.78-square-mile Atwater Village neighborhood—or 8,379 people per square mile, an average population density for the city. The median age for residents was 34, about average for the city.

The neighborhood was considered highly diverse ethnically, with a high percentage of Asians. The breakdown was Latinos, 51.3%; whites, 22.2%; Asians, 19.7%; black, 1.4%; and others, 5.4%. Mexico (27.2%) and the Philippines (20.4%) were the most common places of birth for the 49.3% of the residents who were born abroad—a high percentage, compared to the city at large.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $53,872, an average figure for Los Angeles. The percentages of households that earned $20,000 to $60,000 yearly were high for Los Angeles County. The average household size of 2.7 people was average for Los Angeles. Renters occupied 59.6% of the housing stock, and house or apartment owners held 40.4%. The percentage of never-married women was among the county&#x27;s highest.

== Geography ==
Much of Atwater lies in the old Los Angeles River flood plain, which resulted in deep, fertile soil.

According to the Mapping L.A. project of the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; Atwater Village is bordered on the north and east by Glendale, on the southeast by Glassell Park, on the south by Echo Park, on the southwest by Los Feliz and Silver Lake and on the west by Griffith Park.

Street and other boundary limits are the Ventura Freeway on the north, San Fernando Boulevard on the east, and the Los Angeles River on the south and west.

== Education ==

22% of Atwater Park residents aged 25 and older held a four-year degree by 2000, an average figure for both the city and the county.

=== Schools ===
* Glenfeliz Boulevard Elementary School, LAUSD, 3955 Glenfeliz Boulevard
* Holy Trinity Elementary School, private, 3716 Boyce Avenue
* Atwater Avenue Elementary School, LAUSD, 3271 Silver Lake Boulevard
=== Library ===
The Atwater Village District is served by the Atwater Village Branch of the Los Angeles Public Library. It is located at 3379 Glendale Boulevard, east of the Los Angeles River and Interstate 5.

== Transportation ==
Atwater Village is close to the Interstate 5, SR 134, SR 2 and SR 110 freeways.

It is served by several Metro Bus lines, including the 92, 94 &amp; 180. It also is adjacent to Metrolink Glendale Station.

== In popular culture ==
A number of film locations in Atwater Village were used for Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s movie &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, including the house of Lance (Eric Stoltz) and his wife, Jody (Rosanna Arquette).

The Beastie Boys recorded their albums &quot;Check Your Head&quot; and &quot;Ill Communication&quot; at G-Son, the recording studios they established in 1991 in the village. The village also provided the backdrop for some of the Beasties’ videos, including the 1992 &quot;Pass the Mic&quot;.

Atwater Village was featured in &quot;Our Neighborhoods&quot; with Huell Howser.

Atwater Village has been used recently as a setting in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty&quot; (the basketball court in North Atwater Park was used as the court in Michigan where Magic Johnson battled a romantic rival during a trip back home after college and before his rookie season), in the first episode of the final season of USA&#x27;s &quot;Westworld&quot; (exteriors where Aaron Paul attempts to rescue his daughter) and in the first season of &quot;This Fool&quot; on Hulu (exterior flashback scene). Exteriors in Atwater Village are often used as stand-ins for locations in western and northern Los Angeles.

<doc id="893303" wikidata="Q13650874" url="?curid=893303" title="Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)">
<text>Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) is a hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Mount Sinai is part of Sinai Health. Sinai Health was formed through the voluntary amalgamation of Mount Sinai Hospital (including the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute) and Hennick Bridgepoint Hospital on January 22, 2015. 

Mount Sinai is linked by bridges and tunnels to three adjacent hospitals of the University Health Network (Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, and Princess Margaret Cancer Centre). During the 2005 annual charity, the hospital reported to the Canada Revenue Agency as having assets of roughly C$ 520 million. In the 2019–2020 fiscal year there were nearly 29,000 inpatient stays and 59,700 emergency department visits for Mount Sinai Hospital. The average length of stay for inpatients was 4.4 days.

Mount Sinai Hospital has existed in Toronto since 1923 under various names; it has occupied its present site on University Avenue since 1953. In the fiscal year ending March 2013, Mount Sinai Hospital cared for 128,714 inpatients days, delivered almost 7,000 babies and performed almost 20,000 surgeries. Toronto and area residents made more than half a million ambulatory clinic visits to Mount Sinai. In that same year, the hospital&#x27;s Schwartz/Reisman Emergency Department saw 56,080 visits and that number is expected to increase to 80,000 per year over the next few years.

More than 600 staff work at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai&#x27;s research facility. The institute was established in 1985 as the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute. On June 24, 2013, it became the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. Many of its researchers hold faculty appointments at the University of Toronto.

In October 2010, Mount Sinai Hospital was named one of Greater Toronto&#x27;s Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc.

Dr. Gary Newton was appointed president and CEO of Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health in October 2016.

==History==
In 1913, the Ezras Noshem Society was founded by Slova Greenberg. During the August of that year, the Society began a fundraising campaign to establish a hospital, spearheaded by four immigrant women: Mrs. Cohn, Mrs. Miller, Mrs. Spiegel and Mrs. Adler.

In 1922, a location at 100 Yorkville Avenue was purchased with $12,000. The two-storey building was built as a private residence in 1871 by James D. Bridgland, the Crown&#x27;s Inspector of Roads; in 1914, the home was converted into the Lyndhurst Private Hospital.
In 1923, the hospital opened and was named &quot;The Hebrew Maternity and Convalescent Hospital&quot;. Dorothy Dworkin, who helped in the fundraising campaign, became president of the institution. The first list of permanent staff included: a nursing superintendent, four graduate and two undergraduate nurses, a cook, a laundress, a housemaid and a janitor, while the 33 Jewish doctors in the city all volunteered some time.
In 1924, the name was changed to Mount Sinai Hospital.

In 1930, a new surgical wing was begun by architects, Kaminker &amp; Richmond. The original designs were drawn up in 1928 by Benjamin Swartz. The project was only completed in 1934.

In 1943, a new site was purchased on University Avenue at the corner of Gerrard Street. In 1953, it opened. In the same year, the original Mount Sinai Hospital became the St. Raphael&#x27;s Nursing Home.

In 1985, the original property was designated as a site of historical significance by the Toronto Historical Board Despite this, the 1930 wing was partially demolished in 1988. (Heritage Toronto).

In 2015, Mount Sinai Hospital, Hennick Bridgepoint Hospital, and Circle of Care joined in a voluntary amalgamation to create the Sinai Health, which has the goal of creating an integrated health system that provides more efficient, coordinated care for patients.

At the time of its founding, Mount Sinai Hospital was the only hospital to offer kosher food in Canada. Indeed, it was an institution where Jewish patients could communicate in Yiddish, and be able to observe their religious practices. The hospital has continued to be an institution to provide culturally appropriate services to the Jewish community alongside other immigrant and non-English speaking communities. It is affiliated with many universities, including University of Toronto.

<text>Young adult literature (YA) is typically written for readers aged 12 to 18 and includes most of the themes found in adult fiction, such as family dysfunction, substance abuse, alcoholism, and sexuality. It is characterized by simpler world building than adult literature as it seeks to highlight the experiences of adolescents in a variety of ways. There are various genres within young adult literature. 

The earliest known use of term &quot;young adult&quot; occurred in 1942. Prior to the 1930s teenagers, adolescents and young adults were still considered children in society. Following the recognition of teenagers as a distinct group of people, the designation of young adult literature was developed by librarians to help teenagers make the transition between children&#x27;s literature and adult literature. According to a study conducted in 2023, 55% of young adult literature consumers were over 18 years of age. 78% of adult consumers purchased with the intent to read themselves. Of these adult buyers, 51% were between ages 30 and 44. This highlights the fact that the consumption of young adult literature is heavily focused outside of the target audience range.

== Definitions ==

Author and academic Michael Cart states that the term young adult literature &quot;first found common usage in the late 1960&#x27;s, in reference to realistic fiction that was set in the real (as opposed to imagined), contemporary world and addressed problems, issues, and life circumstances of interest to young readers aged approximately 12–18&quot;. However, &quot;The term &#x27;young adult literature&#x27; is inherently amorphous, for its constituent terms “young adult” and “literature” are dynamic, changing as culture and society — which provide their context — change&quot;, and &quot;even those who study and teach it have not reached a consensus on a definition&quot;.

Victor Malo-Juvera, Crag Hill, in &quot;The Young Adult Canon: A Literary Solar System&quot; note that in 2019 there was no consensus on a definition of young adult literature and list a number of definitions, including:

* Books that readers aged 12 to 20 chose independently
* Literature written for young people aged 11 to 18 and books marked as &quot;young adult&quot; by a publisher
* Literature including a teenager who is the main character and, as the center of the plot, engages in problems related to and relatable to the lives of teenagers
* Novels told by &quot;a teen protagonist speaking from an adolescent point of view, with all the limitations of understanding that implies&quot;

This provides an overall consensus in the literary world that the definition of young adult literature is unique to the author, reader and publisher. There are common themes and tropes seen across young adult literary work that lead a piece to be classified as young adult literature as a general classification with some aspects that may fall into adult literature as well as children&#x27;s literature.

==History==

Librarians first defined this new category of fiction, in particular librarians from the New York Public Library. The NYPL&#x27;s first annual Books for Young People list was sent in 1929 to schools and libraries across the country. Then &quot;In 1944 [...] NYPL librarian Margaret Scoggin changed the name of her library journal column from &#x27;Books for Older Boys and Girls&#x27; to &#x27;Books for Young Adults&#x27;, and the genre was christened with a name that has lasted to this day&quot;. Initially the YA genre &quot;tended to feature the same&quot; boy and girl love story. But in the 1960s the novels developed to more fully examining the lives of adolescents. Particularly noteworthy was S. E. Hinton&#x27;s &quot;The Outsiders&quot;.

=== Pre-20th century ===
French historian Philippe Ariès argues, in his 1962 book &quot;Centuries of Childhood&quot;, that the modern concept of childhood only emerged in recent times. He argues that children were in the past not considered as greatly different from adults and were not given significantly different treatment. Furthermore, &quot;Teenagers weren&#x27;t a designated demographic in most respects until around World War II, due in part to advances in psychology and sociological changes, like the abolishment of child labor&quot;. With this development came the marketing of &quot;clothes, music, films, radio programs, and ... the novel&quot; for young adults.

All the same Sarah Trimmer in 1802 recognized young adults as a distinct age group describing &quot;young adulthood&quot; as lasting from ages 14 to 21. In her children&#x27;s literature periodical, &quot;The Guardian of Education&quot;, Trimmer introduced the terms &quot;Books for Children&quot; (for those under fourteen) and &quot;Books for Young Persons&quot; (for those between fourteen and twenty-one), establishing terms of reference for young adult literature that still remain in use.

&quot;At the beginning of the eighteenth century&quot;, according to M. O. Grenby:
A number of works by eighteenth and nineteenth-century authors, though not written specifically for young readers, have appealed to them. Novels by Daniel Defoe, Jonathan Swift, Jane Austen, Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, Lewis Carroll, Robert Louis Stevenson, Mark Twain, Francis Hodgson Burnett, and Edith Nesbit.

&quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; by Lewis Carroll, published in 1865 and one of the best-known works of Victorian literature, has had widespread influence on popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre. It is credited as helping end an era of didacticism in children&#x27;s literature, inaugurating an era in which writing for children aimed to &quot;delight or entertain&quot;. The tale has had a lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. A shortened version for young children, &quot;The Nursery &quot;Alice&quot;&quot; was published in 1890. It was inspired when, on 4 July 1862, Lewis Carroll and Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed in a boat with the three young daughters of scholar Henry Liddell: Lorina (aged 13); Alice (aged 10); and Edith Mary (aged 8). During the trip Carroll told the girls a story that he described in his diary as &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures Under Ground&quot; and which his journal says he &quot;undertook to write out for Alice&quot;. She finally got the manuscript more than two years later.

A number of novels by Robert Louis Stevenson were first published in serial form, in a weekly children&#x27;s literary magazine &quot;Young Folks&quot;, including &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;Kidnapped&quot;, and &quot;The Black Arrow&quot;. This magazine was for boys and girls of an older age than many of its contemporaries.

Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; is described by publisher Simon &amp; Schuster as &quot;The classic tale of a young boy&#x27;s adventures on the Mississippi in the nineteenth century&quot;. The same description can be applied to its sequel, &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;. The protagonist is an early adolescent who is navigating through the hardships of society with an entertainment aspect of adventure that ties in history with literary merit.

=== 20th century ===

According to journalist Erin Blakemore, &quot;Though young adult literature had existed since at least Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Little House&quot; series, which was published in the 1930s, teachers and librarians were slow to accept books for adolescents as a genre&quot;.

In 1942, &quot;Seventeenth Summer&quot; – called by some the first young adult novel – by seventeen-year-old Maureen Daly, was published. Its themes were especially relevant to teenagers, underaged drinking, driving, dating, and angst.
Another early example is the Heinlein juveniles, which were science fiction novels written by Robert A. Heinlein for Scribner&#x27;s young-adult line, beginning with &quot;Rocket Ship Galileo&quot; in 1947. Scribner&#x27;s published eleven more between 1947 and 1958, but the thirteenth, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, was instead published by Putnam. The intended market was teenaged boys. A fourteenth novel, &quot;Podkayne of Mars&quot; (1963), featured a teenaged girl as the protagonist.

In the 1950s, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; (1951) attracted the attention of the adolescent readers although it was written for adults. The themes of adolescent angst and alienation in the novel have become synonymous with young adult literature.

&quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937) and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954–5) by J. R. R. Tolkien are highly successful fantasy novels, which are read to young children and read by both children and adults They are found in the teen or young adult section of American public and school libraries.

&quot;A Wrinkle in Time,&quot; written by Madeleine L&#x27;Engle in 1960, received over twenty-six rejections before publication in 1962, because it was, in L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s words, &quot;too different,&quot; and &quot;because it deals overtly with the problem of evil, and it was really difficult for children, and was it a children&#x27;s or an adults&#x27; book, anyhow?&quot;

In 1957 the Young Adult Library Services Association – initially called the Young Adult Services Division following a reorganization of the American Library Association – had been created. YALSA evaluates and selects materials for young adults, with the most active YASLA committee being the book selection committee.

Michael Cart argues that the 1960s was the decade when literature for adolescents &quot;could be said to have come into its own&quot;. A significant early example of young adult fiction was S. E. Hinton&#x27;s &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1967). The novel features a truer, darker side of adolescent life that was not often represented in works of fiction of the time. Written during high school and written when Hinton was only 16, &quot;The Outsiders&quot; also lacked the nostalgic tone common in books about adolescents written by adults. &quot;The Outsiders&quot; remains one of the best-selling young adult novels of all time. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, five other very popular books were published: &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; (1969), an autobiography of the early years of American poet Maya Angelou; &quot;The Friends&quot; (1973) by Rosa Guy; the semi-autobiographical &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; (US 1963, under a pseudonym; UK 1967) by poet Sylvia Plath; &quot;Bless the Beasts and Children&quot; (1970) by Glendon Swarthout; and &quot;Deathwatch&quot; (1972) by Robb White, which was awarded 1973 Edgar Award for Best Juvenile Mystery by the Mystery Writers of America. The works of Angelou and Plath were published as adult works but &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; deals with a nineteen year old&#x27;s &quot;teenage angst,&quot; and Angelou&#x27;s autobiography is one of the ten books most frequently banned from high school and junior high school libraries and classrooms.

Authors Philip Pullman and Neil Gaiman have both argued for the importance of British fantasy writer Alan Garner. According to Pullman Garner &quot;is indisputably the great originator, the most important British writer of fantasy since Tolkien, and in many respects better than Tolkien&quot;. Similarly Ursula le Guin in a review praising Garner&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Shift&quot;, argues that &quot;Some of the most interesting English novels of recent years have been published as children&#x27;s books&quot;. Although Garner&#x27;s early work is often labelled &quot;children&#x27;s literature&quot;, Garner himself rejects such a description. Critic Neil Philip, commenting on Garner&#x27;s early novels, notes that &quot;It may be that Garner&#x27;s is a case&quot; where the division between children&#x27;s and adults&#x27; literature is &quot;meaningless&quot;.

Judy Blume author of &quot;Are You There God? It&#x27;s Me, Margaret.&quot; (1970), has significantly contributed to children&#x27;s and young adult literature. She was one of the first young adult authors to write novels focused on such controversial topics as masturbation, menstruation, teen sex, birth control, and death.

Ursula le Guin&#x27;s &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, published in 1968, had a significant influence on YA fantasy fiction. It won or contributed to several notable awards for le Guin, including the Boston Globe–Horn Book Award in 1969, and was one of the last winners of the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award. With regard to the Earthsea series Barbara Bucknal stated that &quot;Le Guin was not writing for young children when she wrote these fantasies, nor yet for adults. She was writing for &#x27;older kids&#x27;. But in fact she can be read, like Tolkien, by ten-year-olds and by adults. Margaret Atwood said that ... &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; ... since it dealt with themes such as &quot;life and mortality and who are we as human beings&quot;, it could be read and enjoyed by anybody older than twelve. Reviewers have commented that the basic premise of &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, that of a talented boy going to a wizard&#x27;s school and making an enemy with whom he has a close connection, is also the premise of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.

As publishers began to focus on the emerging adolescent market, more booksellers and libraries began creating young adult sections distinct from children&#x27;s literature and novels written for adults. The 1970s to the mid-1980s have been described as the golden age of young-adult fiction, when challenging novels began speaking directly to the interests of the identified adolescent market.

In the 1980s, young adult literature began pushing the envelope in terms of the subject matter that was considered appropriate for their audience: Books dealing with topics such as rape, suicide, parental death, and murder which had previously been deemed taboo, saw significant critical and commercial success. A flip-side of this trend was a strong revived interest in the romance novel, including young adult romance. With an increase in number of adolescents, the genre &quot;matured, blossomed, and came into its own, with the better written, more serious, and more varied young adult books (than those) published during the last two decades&quot;.

The first novel in J.K. Rowling&#x27;s seven-book &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, was published in 1997. Originally marketed in the UK under the broad category of children&#x27;s literature, the books received attention and praise for their increasingly mature and sophisticated nature, eventually garnering a significant audience of adult readers. This phenomenon led many to see Harry Potter and J.K. Rowling as responsible for a resurgence of young adult literature. It also established a pre-eminent role for speculative fiction in the field, a trend further solidified by &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; trilogy by Suzanne Collins. The end of the decade saw a number of awards appear such as the Michael L. Printz Award and Alex Awards, designed to recognize excellence in writing for young adult audiences.

Philip Pullman&#x27;s fantasy trilogy &quot;His Dark Materials,&quot; published between 1995 and 2000, added another controversial topic to the field by attacking established religion, especially Roman Catholicism. &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, the first volume in the trilogy, won the 1995 Carnegie Medal as the year&#x27;s outstanding English-language children&#x27;s book. Pullman has written other YA fiction, including the Sally Lockhart series (1985–94), as well as books for younger children.

=== 21st century ===

The category of young adult fiction continues to expand into other media and genres: graphic novels/manga, light novels, fantasy, mystery fiction, romance novels, and even subcategories such as cyberpunk, techno-thrillers, and contemporary Christian fiction.

A survey of attendees at a 2018 conference of educators found that the most frequently taught YA texts in America from 2013 to 2018, ordered from most to least taught, were &quot;Speak,&quot; &quot;The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,&quot; &quot;The Giver&quot;, &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, &quot;The House on Mango Street,&quot; &quot;American Born Chinese,&quot; &quot;Monster,&quot; &quot;The Book Thief,&quot; &quot;Persepolis&quot;, and &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot;.

The emergence of dystopian young adult novels was seen in the early 2000s with the publication of The Hunger Games, Maze Runner, and Divergent.

== Themes ==
Many young adult novels feature coming-of-age stories. These feature adolescents beginning to transform into adults, working through personal problems, and learning to take responsibility for their actions. YA serves many literary purposes. It provides a pleasurable reading experience for young people, emphasizing real-life experiences and problems in easier-to-grasp ways, and depicts societal functions.

An analysis of YA novels between 1980 and 2000 found seventeen expansive literary themes. The most common of these were friendship, getting into trouble, romantic and sexual interest, and family life. Other common thematic elements revolve around the coming-of-age nature of the texts. This includes narratives about self-identity, life and death, and individuality.

Young adult novels do not always end with a &quot;happy ever after&quot; compared to that of children&#x27;s literature. As authors develop their literary work to target young adult ages, readers who are entering adulthood are introduced to the idea that things do not always end how they would like them to. Being introduced to this idea at a younger age can allow for young adults to be comfortable and adept to possible upcoming obstacles and hardships in their future.

== Genre ==
Some of the most common YA genres are dystopian, contemporary fiction, fantasy, science fiction, historical fiction, and romance. Hybrid genres are also common in YA.

=== Common genres ===

==== Social Problem novels ====
The social problem novel or problem novel is a sub-genre of literature focusing and commenting on overarching social problems. This type of novel is usually seen as originating in the 19th century, though there were precursors in the 18th century, like &quot;Amelia&quot; by Henry Fielding (1751), and &quot;Caleb Williams&quot; (1794) by William Godwin. They are typically a type of realistic fiction that characteristically depict, in the YA version of this genre, issues such as poverty, drugs, and pregnancy. Published in 1967, S.E. Hinton&#x27;s &quot;The Outsiders&quot; is a well-known example of the YA problem novel. Following its publication, problem novels became popular during the 1970s.

Librarian Sheila Egoff described three reasons why problem novels resonate with adolescents:

* They depict real situations that the readers are experiencing so they have &quot;therapeutic value&quot;.
* They are interesting, new and foreign to those not experiencing these issues.
* They feature mature story lines which appeal to a child&#x27;s desire to grow up.

A classic example of a problem novel, and one that defined the sub-genre, is &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; anonymously published by Beatrice Sparks in 1971. &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; is written as the diary of a young girl, who, to cope with her many problems, experiments with drugs. More recent examples include &quot;Speak&quot; by Laurie Halse Anderson, &quot;Crank&quot; by Ellen Hopkins, and &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; by Stephen Chbosky.

==== Dystopian ====
In the more recent years young adult literature has shifted towards a dystopian era with many of the most popular young adult novels including deadly games, a post world war and technological advancements. Protagonists of these novels are young characters who are taking control over their destiny and finding their place within their warped societies where the odds are pinned against them. &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; by Suzanne Collins is a young adult dystopian novel.

==== Romantasy ====
The romantasy genre is a mix between fantasy and romance. A young adult novel that has been written surrounding this genre, &quot;Lightlark&quot; by Alex Aster, involves world building in a fantasy realm, romance, love triangles, friendship and finding one&#x27;s self. These are all common tropes among young adult literature that is continuing to create new boundaries of the genre in the world of today.

===Boundaries between children&#x27;s, young adult, and adult fiction===

The boundary between books for children and adult literature is flexible and loosely defined and in particular &quot;the young have always been efficient [plunderers] of stories from all sources, and have carried off such literary booty as pleased them&quot;. This boundary has been policed by adults and has &quot;alternated between the rigid and the permeable depending on the political and cultural climate&quot;.

At the lower end of the age spectrum, fiction targeted to readers aged 8–12 is referred to as middle grade fiction. Some novels originally marketed to adults are of interest and value to adolescents, and vice versa, as in the case of books such as the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of novels. Some examples of middle grade novels and novel series include the &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians&quot; series by Rick Riordan, &quot;The Underland Chronicles&quot; by Suzanne Collins, and &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&quot; by Jeff Kinney.

Examples of young adult novels and novel series include the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series by J. K. Rowling, &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; trilogy by Suzanne Collins, the &quot;Alex Rider&quot; series by Anthony Horowitz and the &quot;Mortal Instruments&quot; series by Cassandra Clare.

Middle grade novels are usually shorter, and are significantly less mature and complex in theme and content than YA. YA novels are for ages 12–18, and tackle more mature and adult themes and content than middle grade novels. The latter usually feature protagonists between the ages of 10 and 13, whereas young adult novels usually feature protagonists from 14 to 18.

Adult fiction may explore concepts such as sex, drug use and violence in more graphic ways. In adult romance novels intimate scenes can be graphic in detail. However, in young adult literature intimate scenes may be mentioned but lack excessive detail and events may be said to have happened rather than described. For individual pieces of literary work the line between young adult and adult can become blurry based on a variety of factors one being the level of graphics in the content and the manner in which it is described.

==New adult fiction==

==Uses in the classroom==
YA has been integrated into classrooms to increase student interest in reading. Studies have shown that YA can be beneficial in classroom settings. YA fiction is written for adolescents and some believe it to be more relevant to students&#x27; social and emotional needs instead of classic literature. Use of YA in classrooms is linked to:

* higher levels of engagement and motivation among students
* increased levels of self-confidence, personal development and self-identification
* increased desire to read similar books

Students who read YA are more likely to appreciate literature and have stronger reading skills than others. YA also allows teachers to talk about &quot;taboo&quot; or difficult topics with their students. For example, a 2014 study shows that using Laurie Halse Anderson&#x27;s novel &quot;Speak&quot; aided in discussions on consent and complicity. Those who read about tough situations like date rape are more emotionally prepared to handle the situation if it arises. It is important to use diverse literature in the classroom, especially in discussing taboo topics, to avoid excluding minority students.

Literature written for young adults can also be used as a stepping stone to canonical works that are traditionally read in classrooms, and required by many school curriculums. In &quot;Building a Culture of Readers: YA Literature and the Canon&quot; by Kara Lycke, Lycke suggests pairing young adult literature and canon works to prepare young adults to understand the classic literature they will encounter. YA can provide familiar and less alienating examples of similar concepts than those in classic literature. Suggested pairings include Rick Riordan&#x27;s &quot;Percy Jackson&quot; series with the Iliad or the Odyssey, or Stephenie Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Twilight&quot; with &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. When discussing identity, Lycke suggests pairing Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; with Sherman Alexie&#x27;s &quot;The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian.&quot; Common required texts in high schools of America include, &quot;The Outsiders, Of Mice and Men&quot;, and &quot;The Crucible.&quot;

== Criticism ==

=== Political content ===

The trend to include same-sex relationships and transgender characters in young adult fiction has caused considerable controversy. Conservative activists and religious groups have also criticized young adult fiction for violence, explicit sexual content, obscene language, and suicide. Speculative young adult fiction is sometimes targeted by critics for religious reasons, including religious debates over the Harry Potter series and Philip Pullman&#x27;s trilogy &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;. Criticism has also been leveled at young adult fiction authors for alleged insensitivity to marginalized communities or cultural appropriation.

=== Banned books ===
Recent YA literature has sparked commotion within communities around America as individuals share their opinion in regards to what literary content their child is exposed to. The American Library association conducted a study to determine which books from 2010 to 2019 were most frequently challenged. Titles on this list included &quot;The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian, The Bluest Eye, The Hunger Games,&quot; and &quot;Of Mice and Men.&quot; 

=== Lack of diversity ===
English language young adult fiction and children&#x27;s literature in general have historically shown a lack of books with a main character who is a person of color, LGBT, or disabled. In the UK 90% of the best-selling YA titles from 2006 to 2016 featured white, able-bodied, cis-gendered, and heterosexual main characters. The numbers of children&#x27;s book authors have shown a similar lack of diversity. Between 2006 and 2016, eight percent of all young adult authors published in the UK were people of color.

In the mid-2010s, more attention was drawn to diversity from various quarters. In the several years following, diversity numbers seem to have increased: One survey showed that in 2017, 25% of children&#x27;s books were about minority protagonists, almost a 10% increase from 2016.

=== Literary merit ===
Jack Zipes, a professor of German and literature, has criticized the standardized nature of young adult fiction in Western society. He writes that to become a phenomenon, a work has to &quot;conform to the standards [...] set by the mass media and promoted by the culture industry in general.&quot; Zipes complains of similarities between Harry Potter and other well known heroes.

Professor Chris Crowe argues that criticism of young adult fiction arises from the fear that the genre will replace classic works. He also suggests that because there is much poorly written young adult fiction, and the genre&#x27;s recent development, it has difficulty in establishing its value in relation to the classics of literature.

<text>Rembert Dodoens (born Rembert Van Joenckema, 29 June 1517 – 10 March 1585) was a Flemish physician and botanist, also known under his Latinized name Rembertus Dodonaeus. He has been called the father of botany. 

== Life ==
Dodoens was born Rembert van Joenckema in Mechelen, then the capital of the Spanish Netherlands in 1517. His parents were Denis van Joenckema (d. 1533) and Ursula Roelants. The van Joenckema family and name are Frisian in origin. Its members were active in politics and jurisprudence in Friesland and some had moved in 1516 to Mechelen. His father was one of the municipal physicians in Mechelen and a private physician to Margaret of Austria, Governor of the Netherlands, in her final illness. Margaret of Austria&#x27;s court was based in Mechelen. Rembert later changed his last name to Dodoens (literally &quot;Son of Dodo&quot;, a form of his father&#x27;s name, Denis or Doede).
=== Education, marriage, and travels ===
Dodoens was educated at the municipal college in Mechelen before beginning his studies in medicine, cosmography and geography at the age of 13 at the University of Leuven (Louvain), under Arnold Noot, Leonard Willemaer, Jean Heems, and Paul Roelswhere. He graduated with a licentiate in medicine in 1535, and as was the custom of the time, began extensive travels (&quot;Wanderjahren&quot;) in Europe till 1546, including Italy, Germany, France, and a stay in Basel 1542–1546. In 1539 he married Kathelijne De Bruyn (1517–1572), who came from a medical family in Mechelen. With her he had four children, Ursula (b. 1544), Denijs (b. 1548), Antonia, and Rembert Dodoens. After his wife&#x27;s death at the age of 55 in 1572, he married Maria Saerinen by whom he had a daughter, Johanna. 

=== Medical career ===
In 1548, Dodoens followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by becoming one of the three municipal physicians in Mechelen together with Joachim Roelandts and Jacob De Moor. In 1557, Dodoens turned down an offer of a chair at the University of Leuven. He also turned down an offer to become court physician of king Philip II of Spain. In 1575–1578, he was the court physician of the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian II and his successor Austrian emperor Rudolph II in Vienna. In 1582, he was appointed professor of medicine at the University of Leiden. He died in Leiden in 1585, and was buried at Pieterskerk, Leiden.

==State of botanical science in Dodoens&#x27; time==
In the early sixteenth century the general belief was that the plant world had been completely described by Dioscorides in his &quot;De Materia Medica&quot;. During Dodoens&#x27; lifetime, botanical knowledge was undergoing enormous expansion, partly fueled by the expansion of the known plant world by New World exploration, the discovery of printing and the use of wood-block illustration. This period is thought of as a botanical Renaissance. Europe became fascinated with natural history from the 1530s, and gardening and cultivation of plants became a passion and prestigious pursuit from monarchs to universities. The first botanical gardens appeared as well as the first illustrated botanical encyclopaedias, together with thousands of watercolours and woodcuts. The experience of farmers, gardeners, foresters, apothecaries and physicians was being supplemented by the rise of the plant expert. Collecting became a discipline, specifically the &quot;Kunst- und Wunderkammern&quot; (cabinets of curiosities) outside of Italy and the study of naturalia became widespread through many social strata. The great botanists of the sixteenth century were all, like Dodoens, originally trained as physicians, who pursued a knowledge of plants not just for medicinal properties, but in their own right. Chairs in botany, within medical faculties were being established in European universities throughout the sixteenth century in reaction to this trend, and the scientific approach of observation, documentation and experimentation was being applied to the study of plants.

Otto Brunfels published his &quot;Herbarium&quot; in 1530, followed by those of Jerome Bock (1539) and Leonhard Fuchs (1542), men that Kurt Sprengel would later call the &quot;German fathers of botany&quot;. These men all influenced Dodoens, who was their successor.

== Publications ==

Dodoens&#x27; initial works were published in the fields of cosmography and physiology. His &quot;De frugum historia&quot; (1552), a treatise on cereals, vegetables, and fodders marked the beginning of a distinguished career in botany. 

=== &quot;Cruydeboeck&quot; ===
His herbal &quot;Cruydeboeck&quot; (herb book) with 715 images (1554, 1563) was influenced by earlier German botanists, particularly that of Leonhart Fuchs. Of the drawings in the &quot;Cruydeboeck&quot;, 515 were borrowed from Leonhart Fuchs&#x27; &quot;New-Kreuterbüchlein&quot; (1543) while 200 new drawings were drawn by Pieter van der Borcht the Elder and the woodblocks cut by Arnold Nicolai.

Rather than the traditional method of arranging the plants in alphabetical order, the &quot;Cruydeboeck&quot; divided the plant kingdom into six groups (&quot;Deel&quot;), based on their properties and affinities. It treated in detail especially the medicinal herbs, which made this work, in the eyes of many, a pharmacopoeia. This work and its various editions and translations became one of the most important botanical works of the late 16th century, part of its popularity being his use of the vernacular rather than the commonly used Latin.
==== Translations ====
The &quot;Cruydeboeck&quot; was translated first into French in 1557 by Charles de L&#x27;Ecluse (&quot;Histoire des Plantes&quot;), and into English in 1578 by Henry Lyte (via L&#x27;Ecluse) (&quot;A new herbal, or historie of plants&quot;), and later into Latin in 1583 (&quot;Stirpium historiae pemptades sex&quot;). The English version became a standard work in that language. At the time, it was the most translated book after the Bible. It became a work of worldwide renown, used as a reference book for two centuries.

==== Expanded editions ====
The &quot;Cruydeboeck&quot;″s Latin version published at the Plantin Press in Antwerp in 1583 under the title &quot;Stirpium historiae pemptades sex sive libri XXXs&quot; was a considerable revision. It contained new families, enlarged the number of groups from 6 to 26 and included many new illustrations, both original and borrowed. It was used by John Gerard as the source for his widely used &quot;Herball&quot; (1597). Thomas Johnson, in his preface to his 1633 edition of &quot;Herball&quot;, explains the controversial use of Dodoens&#x27; work by Gerard. The Latin version was also translated back into Dutch and published in 1608 in Leiden by the Plantin Press of Frans van Ravelingen under the title &quot;Crvydt-Boeck van Robertus Dodonaeus, volgens sijne laatste verbetering... etc&quot;. This edition included additional information on American plants prepared by Joost van Ravelingen, the brother of the publisher and a botanist and physician like Dodoens himself. The Dutch editions of 1618 and 1644 were reprints of this 1608 edition. The 1644 edition had 1492 pages and 1367 woodcuts.

<text>Enrico Forlanini (13 December 1848 – 9 October 1930) was an Italian engineer, inventor and aeronautical pioneer, known for his works on helicopters, aeroplanes, hydrofoils and dirigibles. He was born in Milan. His older brother Carlo Forlanini was a physician.

==Early life==
Enrico Forlanini was born to Francesco Forlanini, a notable physician and director of the &quot;Ospedale Fatebenefratelli&quot; in Milan. After elementary school he attended one of the three Milan &quot;Regie Scuole Tecniche&quot;, in 1863 he entered the Military College of Turin.

In 1866 he enrolled at the Military Academy of Turin, and became a Lieutenant of Engineers. Enrico enrolled in the &quot;Scuola di Applicazione Artiglieria e Genio&quot; (Application School of Artillery and Engineers) in Turin in 1868.

Upon graduation in 1870, Forlanini was assigned to Casale Monferrato, where he was able to work in the police station&#x27;s workshop. He began working on a systematic testing of propellers. He subsequently studied at Politecnico di Milano and graduated in Industrial Engineering.

==Helicopter model==
In 1877, he developed an early helicopter powered by a steam engine. It was the first of its type that rose to a height of 13 metres, where it remained for some 20 seconds, after a vertical take-off from a park in Milan.

==Industry==

Then, in 1893 he worked in Forlì, in a company named &quot;Società Anonima Forlivese per l’illuminazione a gas e per la fonderia di ferro&quot;.

==Airships==

Later he designed and built a series of dirigibles, notably, designed in 1901 and launched in 1909, the &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; that he dedicated to the famous Renaissance inventor and, in 1912, the &quot;Città di Milano&quot;, dedicated to his beloved home town. The latter showed exceptionally good characteristics of stability and controllability that won Forlanini international renown. A further four airships were constructed: F3, F4, F5 and F6. A seventh, named &quot;Omnia Dir&quot; was only completed after his death.

==Hydrofoils==

He is also known for his hydrofoils that he started modelling since 1898. One of those, built at full scale, used a ladder system of foils and a engine driving two counter-rotating air props. During testing on Lake Maggiore in 1906, this craft reached a top speed of 68 km/h (42.5 mph). He also tested a hydrofoil with a steam engine but this only achieved around in 1908-1909.

==Legacy==
Forlanini obtained a number of British and American patents on his ideas and designs, most of which were aimed at seaplane applications.

He died in 1930 while still working on the design of the &quot;Omnia Dir&quot; airship.

Milan has dedicated to Enrico Forlanini its city airport, also named Linate Airport, as well as the nearby park, the Parco Forlanini. In Milan he also has an avenue named after him, Viale Enrico Forlanini.

<doc id="893325" wikidata="Q1493270" url="?curid=893325" title="The Dharma Bums">
<text>The Dharma Bums is a 1958 novel by Beat Generation author Jack Kerouac. The basis for the novel&#x27;s semi-fictional accounts are events occurring years after the events of &quot;On the Road&quot;. The main characters are the narrator Ray Smith, based on Kerouac, and Japhy Ryder, based on the poet and essayist Gary Snyder, who was instrumental in Kerouac&#x27;s introduction to Buddhism in the mid-1950s. 

The book concerns duality in Kerouac&#x27;s life and ideals, examining the relationship of the outdoors, mountaineering, hiking, and hitchhiking through the western US with his &quot;city life&quot; of jazz clubs, poetry readings, and drunken parties. The protagonist&#x27;s search for a &quot;Buddhist&quot; context to his experiences (and those of others he encounters) recurs throughout the story.

Released just one year following the success of his previous novel, &quot;On the Road, The Dharma Bums&quot; was another success for Kerouac and became one of his most popular books. The novel would also go on to have a significant influence on the Hippie counterculture during the 1960s.

==Plot summary==
The character Japhy drives Ray Smith&#x27;s story, whose penchant for simplicity and Zen Buddhism influenced Kerouac on the eve of the sudden and unpredicted success of &quot;On the Road&quot;. The action shifts between the events of Smith and Ryder&#x27;s &quot;city life,&quot; such as three-day parties and enactments of the Buddhist &quot;Yab-Yum&quot; rituals, to the sublime and peaceful imagery where Kerouac seeks a type of transcendence. The novel concludes with a change in narrative style, with Kerouac working alone as a fire lookout on Desolation Peak (adjacent to Hozomeen Mountain), in what would soon be declared North Cascades National Park (see also Kerouac&#x27;s novel &quot;Desolation Angels&quot;). His summer on Desolation Peak was desperately lonely. “Many&#x27;s the time I thought I&#x27;d die of boredom or jump off the mountain,” he wrote in &quot;Desolation Angels&quot;. Yet in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Dharma Bums&quot;, Kerouac described the experience in elegiac prose.

One episode in the book features Smith, Ryder, and Henry Morley (based on real-life friend John Montgomery) climbing Matterhorn Peak in California. It relates Kerouac&#x27;s introduction to this type of mountaineering and inspired him to spend the following summer as a fire lookout for the United States Forest Service on Desolation Peak in Washington.

Chapter 2 of the novel gives an account of the legendary 1955 Six Gallery reading, where Allen Ginsberg (&#x27;Alvah Goldbook&#x27; in the book) gave a debut presentation of his poem &quot;Howl&quot; (changed to &quot;Wail&quot; in the book). At the event, other authors including Snyder, Kenneth Rexroth, Michael McClure, and Philip Whalen also performed.Anyway I followed the whole gang of howling poets to the reading at Gallery Six that night, which was, among other important things, the night of the birth of the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance. Everyone was there. It was a mad night. And I was the one who got things jumping by going around collecting dimes and quarters from the rather stiff audience standing around in the gallery and coming back with three huge gallon jugs of California Burgundy and getting them all piffed so that by eleven o&#x27;clock when Alvah Goldbook was reading his poem &#x27;Wail&#x27; drunk with arms outspread everybody was yelling &#x27;Go! Go! Go!&#x27; (like a jam session) and old Rheinhold Cacoethes the father of the Frisco poetry scene was wiping his tears in gladness.

==Character key==
Kerouac often based his fictional characters on friends and family.

==Reception==
Gary Snyder wrote Kerouac saying &quot;&quot;Dharma Bums&quot; is a beautiful book, &amp; I am amazed &amp; touched that you should say so many nice things about me because that period was for me really a great process of learning from you...&quot; but confided to Philip Whalen, &quot;I do wish Jack had taken more trouble to smooth out dialogues, etc. Transitions are rather abrupt sometimes.&quot; Later, Snyder chided Kerouac for the book&#x27;s misogynistic interpretation of Buddhism.

<doc id="893330" wikidata="Q258156" url="?curid=893330" title="Colleen Atwood">
<text>Colleen Atwood (born September 25, 1948) is an American costume designer. In a career spanning over four decades, she is recognized for her prolific work across film and television. She has received numerous accolades, including four Academy Awards, three BAFTA Awards, and two Emmy Awards.

Atwood is best known for her collaborations with directors Jonathan Demme, Tim Burton, and Rob Marshall. She has received 12 nominations for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design and has won four times for &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002), &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; (2005), &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010), and &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; (2016), the latter was the first Wizarding World film to win an Academy Award.

==Early life and education==
Born in Ellensburg, Washington, Atwood grew up in the small farming community of Quincy, Washington. At 17, she became pregnant and didn&#x27;t graduate high school with her class. To support her baby and her husband, who was in college, she took a job at a French fry factory. Then, Atwood received a scholarship to attend Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle in the early 1970s, and later worked in retail at various places, including the Yves St. Laurent boutique at Frederick &amp; Nelson department store in the city.

==Career==
Atwood began her career as a fashion advisor in Washington in the early 1970s. She moved to New York in 1980, where she studied art at New York University. Her movie career started after a chance encounter with someone whose mother was designing the sets for the film &quot;Ragtime&quot;, and she got the job of a PA (production assistant) in the film. She worked as an assistant to a costume designer and eventually earned her first film credit for &quot;A Little Sex&quot;, directed by Bruce Paltrow.


Eventually Atwood ventured into the world of costume design for theater and film, initially coming to fame through her work on Sting&#x27;s &quot;Bring On the Night&quot; World Tour, also made into a documentary by the same name. An important turning point in her career came when, through production designer Bo Welch with whom she had worked in &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot;, she met director Tim Burton. Atwood and Burton worked together on over seven films in the next two decades, starting with &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and including &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, &quot;Big Fish&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, and &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;. She moved to Los Angeles in 1990.

Atwood has been partially involved in developing or has been the lead designer for producing the costumes on over 50 films to date. She was the lead costume designer for all the new costumes created for Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus in 2005–2006. She also designed &quot;The Black Parade&quot; band uniforms for the band My Chemical Romance, as well as costumes for the following album, &quot;Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys&quot;. She also designs for television, including &quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;The Flash&quot;, and &quot;Supergirl&quot;. Director Tim Burton brought on Atwood as the costume designer for the Netflix series &quot;Wednesday&quot; to design the looks for Gomez and Morticia Addams. The first thing she did was read the script. She started with Nevermore Academy and worked on the costumes for Wednesday Addams and Enid. 

Atwood&#x27;s favorite fashion designers include Azzedine Alaia, Yohji Yamamoto, and Alexander McQueen.

<doc id="893337" wikidata="Q17098572" url="?curid=893337" title="Local hidden-variable theory">
<text>In the interpretation of quantum mechanics, a local hidden-variable theory is a hidden-variable theory that satisfies the principle of locality. These models attempt to account for the probabilistic features of quantum mechanics via the mechanism of underlying, but inaccessible variables, with the additional requirement that distant events be statistically independent. 

The mathematical implications of a local hidden-variable theory with regards to quantum entanglement were explored by physicist John Stewart Bell, who in 1964 proved that broad classes of local hidden-variable theories cannot reproduce the correlations between measurement outcomes that quantum mechanics predicts, a result since confirmed by a range of detailed Bell test experiments.

== Models ==

=== Single qubit ===
A collection of related theorems, beginning with Bell&#x27;s proof in 1964, show that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden variables. However, as Bell pointed out, restricted sets of quantum phenomena &quot;can&quot; be imitated using local hidden-variable models. Bell provided a local hidden-variable model for quantum measurements upon a spin-1/2 particle, or in the terminology of quantum information theory, a single qubit. Bell&#x27;s model was later simplified by N. David Mermin, and a closely related model was presented by Simon B. Kochen and Ernst Specker. The existence of these models is related to the fact that Gleason&#x27;s theorem does not apply to the case of a single qubit.

=== Bipartite quantum states ===
Bell also pointed out that up until then, discussions of quantum entanglement focused on cases where the results of measurements upon two particles were either perfectly correlated or perfectly anti-correlated. These special cases can also be explained using local hidden variables.

For separable states of two particles, there is a simple hidden-variable model for any measurements on the two parties. Surprisingly, there are also entangled states for which all von Neumann measurements can be described by a hidden-variable model. Such states are entangled, but do not violate any Bell inequality. The so-called Werner states are a single-parameter family of states that are invariant under any transformation of the type formula_1 where formula_2 is a unitary matrix. For two qubits, they are noisy singlets given as 
formula_3
where the singlet is defined as formula_4.

Reinhard F. Werner showed that such states allow for a hidden-variable model for formula_5, while they are entangled if formula_6. The bound for hidden-variable models could be improved until formula_7. Hidden-variable models have been constructed for Werner states even if positive operator-valued measurements (POVM) are allowed, not only von Neumann measurements. Hidden variable models were also constructed to noisy maximally entangled states, and even extended to arbitrary pure states mixed with white noise. Beside bipartite systems, there are also results for the multipartite case. A hidden-variable model for any von Neumann measurements at the parties has been presented for a three-qubit quantum state.

==Time-dependent variables==
Previously some new hypotheses were conjectured concerning the role of time in constructing hidden-variables theory. One approach was suggested by K. Hess and W. Philipp and relies upon possible consequences of time dependencies of hidden variables; this hypothesis has been criticized by Richard D. Gill, , Anton Zeilinger and Marek Żukowski, as well as D. M. Appleby.

<doc id="893338" wikidata="Q3636837" url="?curid=893338" title="Battle Beasts">
<text>is a line of small 2&quot; tall action figure toys, in the form of anthropomorphised animals with body armor and a unique weapon. Several figures have their left hand replaced by a weapon of some kind. Battle Beasts were created and largely produced by Takara and distributed by Takara in Japan (under the name BeastFormers) and by Hasbro outside Japan, beginning in 1987.

==History==
Battle Beasts were created by Takara of Japan in 1986. Tomy Co., Ltd., aka &quot;K.K. Takara-Tomy&quot;, still owns the worldwide rights to the property. The heyday for the toyline came during the period in which it was licensed to Hasbro for distribution outside Japan when Hasbro marketed the toys in America and many other parts of the world. Although in the Japanese market Takara branded the toys as a spin-off of Transformers and even named the toys &quot;BeastFormers&quot;, their tie-in to the Transformers universe was not part of the Hasbro story or marketing.

As part of the Takara strategy, many of the Battle Beasts appeared in the episode &quot;Rebellion on Planet Beast&quot; of the Japanese Transformers cartoon series &quot;&quot;. The Battle Beasts reside on the planet Beast.

Four series were released overall. The first three contain beasts 1 - 76. Each figure has a heat sensitive rub sign on his/her chest and a hand-to-hand weapon. Three pull-back vehicles and three transforming bases were also released. The fourth series had 36 figures and was renamed Laser Beasts, the renaming corresponded with some minor changes to the figures. The entire Laser Beast line was released in Japan, and in small numbers in America and Europe. These figures have orbs in their chest instead of rubs and each came with a gun that resembled the creature who held it. Some small chariots were also released as part of the Laser Beast line in Japan. In addition to these figures, some promo figures were also made. These were made of clear plastic and were available only in special sets.

The figures were released in Japan in small boxes of individual figures and in larger multi-packs. In America Series 1, 2 and the 12 Laser Beasts were released on blister cards with two figures per card. Series 3 figures were only available in boxes of eight per package. The vehicles came in boxes and each came with a figure.

==Story==
The universe history of 2011 takes place in the galaxy territory of the Decepticon&#x27;s &quot;Planet Beast&quot;.

The intelligent race of animals called BeastFormers lived in peace on Planet Beast. However, the scheming evil hand of the Decepticons bent on domination of the entire universe to the peaceful Planet Beast was fast approaching.

To defeat the Lion Family that ruled Planet Beast, Galvatron supplied Alligatron with weapons in order to overthrow the Lion family. Alligatron was given the Sharkticons, who were the military escorts of the Decepticons to fight in the rebellion. This is how the BeastFormer war began.

The Beast Star was suddenly engulfed in war. Before Alligatron the wielder of the Decepticon Power and his Decepticon Beast&#x27;s could capture the Cybertron Beasts, they were able to escape into the forest. In order to ask for help from the Autobots, the Cybertron Beast&#x27;s strongest warrior Platinum Tiger had to make his way to the occupied communication room of the palace.

Alligatron planted a trap there called the &quot;Holography Mirror&quot;. As soon as Platinum Tiger unwittingly set foot in the palace, a sudden flash of light trapped the strongest warrior in the holography mirror.

Is Planet Beast going to remain under occupation? What about the fate of the Supreme Commander White Leo&#x27;s Cybertron Beasts? Can Platinum Tiger escape from the power of the Holography Mirror? Right now, the battle and mystery of the BeastFormers is just beginning.

===Series 1 - 3: Battle Beasts===

Battle Beasts came out in the late 1980s and like most toys of the era, had a gimmick to help sales. Each Battle Beast had a heat sensitive sticker on his chest which, when rubbed would reveal the warrior&#x27;s strength. The symbols would represent either fire, wood or water and could be used in a rock, paper, scissors type game—fire beats wood, wood beats water, water beats fire. Later a fourth emblem was added, the Sunburst, and it would beat all other types. The Sunburst was extremely rare, in a ten pack in Japan, or Pirate Leo was available in America as a variant, despite claims that there were others of that affiliation. Each Beast also carried his own distinctive weapon which could be identified to its Beast with the corresponding number.

In the U.S. Battle Beasts came in packages of two, usually (but not always) in numerical order. It was impossible to tell which figure had a rub of fire, wood, or water until the package was opened. That came in handy with marketing, as their slogan was, Fire! Wood! Or Water!... You&#x27;ll never know until you own them!. Also listed on the packages starting with Series 2 was the possibility of getting the Sunburst Warrior. There was a total of three series adding up to 76 Battle Beasts beginning with #1, Pirate Lion and ending with #76, Ossified Orangutan.

Series 1 &amp; 2 were released in Japan, Europe and North America while Series 3 was only released in Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.

===Series 4: Shadow Warriors===

The fourth and final series released was named Shadow Warriors, or Laser Beasts in Japan. The heat sensitive sticker was replaced by an orb that could be seen through, depicting which clan the Beast represented.

The Shadow Warriors had a new slogan on the American package that read Fire! Wood! Water!... Only the crystal shield will reveal their strength!. Shadow Warriors carried guns instead of the hand-to-hand weapons that the Battle Beasts had, and each gun resembled the creature to which it belonged.

The entire new series of 36 Laser Beasts and new sleds were released mainly in Japan. North America only received 12 of the new Laser Beasts, which were packaged as &quot;Shadow Warriors&quot; in two-pack blister cards. These were mainly sold by Value City stores. No accessories, such as sleds or shields, were released, although they appeared on the packaging. Some of the lower numbered Lasers were produced in Europe and a few came with unique shields and sleds that like the guns, resembled the animal it belonged to. The sleds from Japan were available in two colors (grey and bordeaux) and both were included in the Six Shield Battler set. In France a third color, purple, appeared. This exclusive color was included in the blister packs of Laser Beasts #93 to #96, the grey one was available with Beasts #89 to #92, and the bordeaux was available with Beasts #97 to #100. The main color of the sled is not the only difference. The color of the wheels change too. The grey sled has orange wheels, the bordeaux sled has black wheels and the purple sled has yellow wheels.

Six of the 12 shields were released only in Europe; #89 Brown Lion, #92 Hustlebear, #95 Dragon Seahorn, #97 Seapanic, #98 Puzzlecolor and #100 Scope Cougar.

==Vehicles==
A number of vehicles were released throughout the line. For the Battle Beast line, three chariots and three bases were released that looked like animals, and each came with one figure that was not unique to the vehicle. The chariots were able to hold up to three figures comfortably and each had its own name: Tearin&#x27; Tiger, which looked like a tiger, Big Horn which looked like a ram and Deer Stalker which looked like a deer. All the chariots had a pull-back motion that would spring the vehicle forward when it was released.

The three bases were the Blazing Eagle (known as the Firebird in a toy commercial for the vehicles), Shocking Shark and Wood Beetle. Each base had a unique symbol theme that matched the &quot;Fire, Wood, Water&quot; concept that the line was based on. Each base could hold several figures and had a jail-cell with which to hold captured Beasts.

The Laser Beast line had several vehicles as well. Three Battle chariots which were smaller than the Battle Beast chariots could be purchased with a unique figure, and several types of Drills were released as well.

To date, there are four known types of Drills to exist, all of which are the same design but feature different colors; Gold, Maroon, Yellow and Blue. The Blue Drill is the rarest, with only three or four known to exist.

==Premium figures==
There were several promotional figures released in Japan throughout the run that could be obtained in certain ways, mainly through mail-aways or by purchasing special sets.

Most of the figures weren&#x27;t exactly new, as most of the premium figures were just repaints of previously existing molds. Figures that were repaints were the Stone Cobra, Clear Gator, Clear Carp and the Striped Carp. The only exception to this rule was the mail-away offer for the #101 Skull Grotess figure, which was a completely original figure.

Premium figures were available in various ways. The Clear Gator and Sunburst Lion could be obtained by purchasing a Japanese 10-pack set that contained either one figure or the other although the owner couldn&#x27;t tell until he or she opened the package. The Stone Cobra could only be obtained through the mailing of the two halves of the &quot;Stone Tablet&quot;. One half could be found in the Japanese Fire Phoenix playset (which was the Japanese equivalent to the American Blazing Eagle set), while the other was in the Sunburst Lion set. The Stone Cobra was sent out in two different waves due to a larger demand than Takara originally expected. The first way came with no rub, the second came with a sticker that had White Leo&#x27;s face on it.

The Clear and Striped Carps could be found in the Japanese &quot;Punch Box&quot; set, which was basically a box that had covers which the owner would &quot;punch&quot; to find a figure. The Striped Carp was much more rare than the Clear version.

The Skull Grotess figure could be purchased (along with a Gold Drill) through a mail-away offer exclusively. An order form advertising the figure could be found in almost all single-figure packages sold in Japan.

==Merchandise==

Starting with the second series of figures in America, a 23&quot; x 30&quot; poster was available via mail order featuring drawings of all the Battle Beasts as well as their names.

A strap called the Bandolier was introduced for children to hold and carry around their Battle Beasts figures, in the middle of it was a box that has the Battle Beasts logo on it and all over it are compartments to hold several figures.

A comic series simply titled &quot;Battle Beasts&quot; was published by Blackthorne Publishing from February through November 1988. There were only four issues published by the company before it was canceled on a cliffhanger. All four issues were published in black-and-white. The stories were written by John Stephenson, penciled by Andy Ice, and inked by Jorge Pacheco (issues 1 and 2), Shepherd Hendrix (issue 3), and Rachel &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Haze (issue 4). They centered primarily on seven characters: Horny Toad, Knight Owl, and Gargantuan Gorilla dealing with the betrayal of Chameleon, Rocky Rhino, Blitzkrieg Bat, and Cutthroat Cuttlefish, who interrupted a ceremony with the Soulspirit causing madness and constant sign changes among their people. A sludgy devil character called Ruhin was also featured. The final issue implied that Pirate Lion, piloting the Shocking Shark with first mate Webslinger Spider, was the Sunburst Warrior who would be able to set things aright. Two annuals were published as well, although by a different company and they were only released in Europe. The stories are unrelated to the Blackthorne series.

==Revivals==
In 2011 Takara Tomy announced the Beast Saga line, a spiritual successor to the original figures. The line focuses on three factions - land, air and sea. The fire/wood/water battling mechanism was replaced by a dice launcher which enables a dice battle game between figures. The series was released in September 2012. Figures include shields in addition to weapons and have been released in monthly waves. Shonen Jump produced a manga based on the toy line and an anime was released in 2013.

At the 2009 San Diego Comic Con, Diamond Select Toys acquired the Battle Beasts brand name after Hasbro allowed the trademark to lapse. They displayed a playset featuring a Minimates version of their new Battle Beasts line. The playset was to become available for sale on December 31, 2009, but was cancelled. Several repaints of the figure were sold in 2010, and at C2E2 2012 the company confirmed they would be going forward with a full line of figures. Additionally, a comic book based on the Minimates franchise was released by IDW Publishing in May 2012.

Also in 2012, a small company called Plastic Imagination! announced Rise of the Beasts, a forthcoming line of minifigures with articulated arms and necks inspired by the original 1980s toys. The project launched a successful Kickstarter campaign, but the Kickstarter was cancelled pre-funding due to factory issues. In August 2014, factory test shots were posted as an update to the Kickstarter project and an estimated release date of full production figures was given as November or December 2014. The first figures to be released are the Rhino and Scorpion characters that were teased during the original campaign. Changes to the original design include articulation at the neck, shoulders and waist, instead of just at the shoulders. Also the joints use Glyos pegs.

<text>Harry H. Corbett (28 February 1925 – 21 March 1982) was an English actor and comedian, best remembered for playing rag-and-bone man Harold Steptoe alongside Wilfrid Brambell in the long-running BBC television sitcom &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (1962–1965, 1970–1974). His success on television led to appearances in comedy films including &quot;The Bargee&quot; (1964), &quot;Carry On Screaming&quot; (1966) and &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (1977).

==Early life==
Corbett was born on 28 February 1925, the youngest of seven children, in Rangoon, Burma, (now Myanmar) where his father, George Corbett (1885/86–1943), was serving as a company quartermaster sergeant in the South Staffordshire Regiment of the British Army, stationed at a cantonment as part of the Colonial defence forces. Corbett was sent to Britain after his mother, Caroline Emily, &quot;née&quot; Barnsley (1884–1926), died of dysentery when he was eighteen months old. He was then brought up by his aunt Annie Williams, in Earl Street, Ardwick, Manchester, and later on a new council estate in Wythenshawe. He attended Ross Place and Benchill primary schools; although he passed the scholarship exam for entry to Chorlton Grammar School, he was not able to take up his place there and instead attended Sharston secondary school.

Corbett enlisted in the Royal Marines during the Second World War, and served in the Home Fleet on the heavy cruiser HMS &quot;Devonshire&quot;. After VJ Day in 1945 he was posted to the Far East, where he was involved in quelling unrest in New Guinea and reportedly killed two Japanese soldiers there whilst engaged in hand-to-hand fighting. He was then posted to Tonga, but deserted and remained in Australia before handing himself in to the Military Police. His military service left him with a damaged bladder following an infection, and a red mark on his eye caused by a thorn, which was not treated until late in his life.

==Career==
Upon returning to civilian life, Corbett trained as a radiographer before taking up acting as a career, joining the Chorlton Repertory theatre. In the early 1950s, he added the initial &quot;H&quot; to avoid confusion with the television entertainer Harry Corbett, known for his act with the glove-puppet Sooty. He joked that &quot;H&quot; stood for &quot;hennyfink&quot;, a Cockney pronunciation of &quot;anything&quot;. In 1956, he appeared on stage in &quot;The Family Reunion&quot; at the Phoenix Theatre in London.

From 1958, Corbett began to appear regularly in films, including an &#x27;American&#x27; film &quot;Floods of Fear&quot; (1958), filmed at Pinewood, coming to public attention as a serious, intense performer, in contrast to his later reputation in sitcom. He appeared in television dramas such as &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (as four characters in episodes between 1957 and 1960) and &quot;Police Surgeon&quot; (1960). He also worked and studied Stanislavski&#x27;s system at Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, London.

In 1962, scriptwriters Galton and Simpson, who had been successful with &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, invited Corbett to appear in &quot;The Offer&quot;, an episode of the BBC&#x27;s anthology series of one-off comedy plays, &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot;, written by Galton and Simpson. He played Harold Steptoe, a rag-and-bone man who lives with his irascible widower father, Albert (Wilfrid Brambell) in a dilapidated house attached to their junkyard and stable for their cart horse, Hercules. At the time, Corbett was working at the Bristol Old Vic, where he appeared as &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

In 1967 he was interviewed by Clive Goodwin, for an episode of a BBC series in which &quot;leading young actors discussed their start in the profession, the parts that brought them success and their views on acting.&quot;

The programme was a success and a full series followed, continuing, with breaks, until 1974, when the Christmas special became the final episode. Although the popularity of &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; made Corbett a star, it damaged his serious acting career, as he became irreversibly associated with Steptoe in the public eye. As a result, severe typecasting forced him to come back to the role of Harold Steptoe over and over. Before the series began, Corbett had played Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; to great acclaim; however, when he played &quot;Hamlet&quot; in 1970, he felt both critics and audiences alike were not taking him seriously and could only see him as Steptoe. Corbett found himself receiving offers only for bawdy comedies or loose parodies of Steptoe.

Production of the sitcom was stressful in the last few years, as Brambell was an alcoholic, often ill-prepared for rehearsals and forgetting his lines and movements. A tour of a &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; stage production in Australia and New Zealand in 1977 proved a disaster due to Brambell&#x27;s drinking.

The television episodes were remade for radio, often with the original cast; it is these that were made available on cassette and CD. After the series of &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; had officially finished, Corbett and Brambell played the characters again on radio (in a newly written sketch to tie in with the Scottish team&#x27;s participation in the 1978 World Cup), as well as in a television commercial for Kenco coffee. The two men reunited in January 1981 for one final performance as &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; in a further commercial for Kenco.

===Other work===
&quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; led Corbett to comedy films: as James Ryder in &quot;Ladies Who Do&quot; (1963); with Ronnie Barker in &quot;The Bargee&quot; (1964), written by Galton and Simpson; &quot;Carry On Screaming!&quot; (1966) (replacing an unavailable Sid James); the &quot;Lust&quot; segment of &quot;The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins&quot; (1971); and Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (1977). There were two &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; films: &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (1972) and &quot;Steptoe and Son Ride Again&quot; (1973). In 1966 he appeared as a narrator in four episodes of the BBC children&#x27;s television series &quot;Jackanory&quot;, and he also had the leading role in two other television series, &quot;Mr. Aitch&quot; (written especially for him, 1967) and &quot;Grundy&quot; (1980). Corbett had a supporting role in the David Essex film &quot;Silver Dream Racer&quot; (1980), and also appeared in the film &quot;Hardcore&quot; (1977). In addition, he had a supporting role in &quot;Potter&quot; (1980) with Arthur Lowe on the BBC.

Corbett recorded multiple 45rpm records, most of which were novelty songs based upon the rag-and-bone character, including &quot;Harry, You Love Her&quot; and &quot;Junk Shop&quot;. He recorded a number of sea shanties and folk songs. In 1973, he recorded an album titled &quot;Only Authorised Employees To Break Bottles&quot; which was a &quot;showcase of accents&quot;, with songs from Corbett in a range of accents, including Liverpudlian, Brummie and Mancunian; the title echoes a notice which is visible in the bottle-smashing scene in the film &#x27;The Bargee&#x27;. The album was recorded in 1973 and released in 1974 on the Torquay, Devon-based RA record label with support from seventies folk band &#x27;Faraway Folk&#x27;: RALP Including the album, he released over 30 songs.

==Personal life==
Corbett married twice, first to the actress Sheila Steafel (from 1958 to 1964), and then to actress Maureen Blott (stage name Crombie) (from 1969 until his death in 1982), with whom he had two children, Jonathan and Susannah. Susannah is an actress and author, and has written a biography of her father, &quot;Harry H. Corbett: The Front Legs of the Cow&quot;, which was published in March 2012. Steafel published her autobiography &quot;When Harry Met Sheila&quot; in 2010.

===Political views===
Corbett was a Labour Party campaigner, and once appeared in a party political broadcast, and was a guest of Prime Minister Harold Wilson. The television character Harold Steptoe appears as the Labour Party secretary for Shepherd&#x27;s Bush West in the sixth series episode, &quot;Tea for Two&quot;. In 1969, Corbett also appeared as Harold Steptoe in a Labour Party political broadcast, where Bob Mellish had to argue against Steptoe&#x27;s accusation that all parties are the same.

As Prime Minister, Wilson wished to have Corbett appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). Corbett was included with his namesake, the Sooty puppeteer Harry Corbett, in the 1976 New Year Honours.

===Health problems and death===
A heavy smoker all his adult life, Corbett had his first heart attack in September 1979. According to his daughter, Susannah, he smoked 60 cigarettes a day until the heart attack, after which he cut down to 20. He appeared in pantomime at the Churchill Theatre, Bromley, within two days of leaving hospital. He was then badly hurt in a car accident. The injuries to his face were obvious when he appeared shortly afterwards in the BBC detective series &quot;Shoestring&quot;. Other work included the film &quot;Silver Dream Racer&quot;, with David Essex, and a Thames Television/ITV comedy series &quot;Grundy&quot;, both in 1980. In the latter, Corbett played an old man discovering the permissive society after a lifetime of clean living.

Corbett&#x27;s final role was an episode of the Anglia Television/ITV series &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;, entitled &quot;The Moles&quot;. Filmed shortly before his death, it was broadcast two months later, in May 1982.

Having appeared in several films and TV shows after production of &quot;Steptoe&quot; ended, Corbett finally seemed to be overcoming the typecasting that affected much of his career when he died of a heart attack on 21 March 1982, in Hastings, East Sussex. He was 57 years old. 

Wilfrid Brambell appeared on BBC News paying tribute to Corbett; &quot;&quot;&quot;A nice guy, and we did work well together, despite the fact that we only met when we were working because we live different lives and miles apart. I, as you know, have a two-room flat; he had a large farm with a wife, two kids, dogs, cats and a mother-in-law&quot;.
He is buried in the graveyard at St Michael the Archangel church at Penhurst, East Sussex. The headstone inscription, chosen by his wife Maureen, reads &quot;The earth can have but earth, which is his due: My spirit is thine, the better part of me&quot;, from William Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnet 74. Maureen was buried alongside him in 1999. Corbett is commemorated in the name of the Corbett Theatre at the East 15 Acting School at Loughton.

<text>Robert William Bend (1914–1999), also known as Bobby Bend, was a Canadian politician, and was briefly the leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party in 1969.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Bend was born on 16 April 1914 in Poplar Point, Manitoba, the son of J. P. Bend (who unsuccessfully ran for the Manitoba legislature in 1927 and 1932 as a Conservative) and Annie Ada Wilson. The younger Bend received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Manitoba, taught school and later worked as a school principal. He later received a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of Manitoba. In 1938, Bend married Laura Kathleen Fisher.

===Politics===

In 1949, Bend was elected to the Manitoba legislature for the riding of Rockwood. The election was somewhat unusual, in that Bend ran as an &quot;Independent Progressive Conservative&quot; supporting the Liberal-Progressive-Progressive Conservative governing coalition, while his opponent R. A. Quickfall was an Independent Liberal opposing the government. Bend won with over two-thirds of the vote.

The Progressive Conservatives left the governing coalition in 1950, but Bend continued to support the government of Liberal-Progressive Premier Douglas Campbell. He scored an easy re-election in 1953, this time running as an &quot;Independent Liberal-Progressive&quot;. On 25 January 1955, he was named Minister of Health and Public Welfare in the Campbell government.

===Defeat and retirement===

The Progressive Conservatives under Dufferin Roblin won a minority government in 1958, though Bend was again re-elected in the renamed riding of Rockwood—Ibreville. The following year, however, he was defeated by Tory candidate George Hutton.

Bend remained out of active political life for the next decade. In 1969, he stood for the leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party (as the Liberal-Progressives had renamed themselves), and scored an easily first-ballot win over his three opponents (none of whom had legislative experience).

The selection of Bend proved to be a strategic error for the party. Bend represented the rural populist wing of the Liberal Party, and was unable to reach an urban audience. Under his influence, the party adopted a &quot;cowboy&quot;/&quot;rodeo&quot; theme for the campaign, which made it look and sound dated. The Liberals tumbled to only five seats, the fewest they had ever won. Bend himself was narrowly defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Harry Enns in the riding of Lakeside (which Campbell had previously held for 47 years). He stepped down as Liberal leader shortly thereafter, and did not seek provincial office again.

Bend subsequently returned to the education field, serving as superintendent of a rural school division. He died at Rosewood Lodge in Stonewall on 24 September 1999 at the age of 85.

Bend spent 50 years as a baseball umpire and was inducted into the Manitoba Baseball Hall of Fame in 1997.

There is currently an elementary school named after him in Stonewall, Manitoba, called &quot;École R.W. Bobby Bend School&quot;.

<doc id="893358" wikidata="Q7592832" url="?curid=893358" title="St Clement's Hospital">
<text>St Clements Hospital was a mental health hospital located in the Bow and was situated in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets,

==History==
The building opened in a former workhouse building as the City of London Union Infirmary in 1874. The palatial design of the workhouse had been created by architect Richard Tress and had cost over £55,000 to construct, boasted central heating, a dining-hall measuring 100 feet by 50 feet, Siberian marble pillars, and a chapel with stained glass windows and a new organ. It closed in 1909 but re-opened as a hospital for chronically ill people becoming known as the City of London Institution in 1912 and as the Bow Institution in 1913. It became a psychiatric unit, known by its most commonly adopted name of &#x27;St Clement&#x27;s Hospital&#x27; in 1936. The west side of the site suffered extensive bomb damage during the war, destroying the chapel and the sites initial symmetry. The hospital joined the newly formerd National Health Service in 1948 and then came under the same management as the London Hospital in 1968. After services were transferred to a new Adult Mental Health Facility at Mile End Hospital, the hospital closed in February 2006.

=== London&#x27;s First Community Land Trust ===
Following the hospital&#x27;s closure the site was transferred from the NHS to English Partnerships, then to the Homes and Communities Agency, and eventually the Greater London Authority, who marketed it as a regeneration opportunity in 2011. Following a long campaign, the Greater London Authority announced in April 2012 that the site would include London&#x27;s first Community Land Trust. Mayor of London Boris Johnson broke the ground on the site in March 2014. The house prices are not based on the open market rate but instead are linked to the average median salaries in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. This formula is reapplied every time a house within the Trust is sold, creating what organisers describe as &quot;truly and permanently affordable housing&quot;.

<doc id="893362" wikidata="Q58805" url="?curid=893362" title="Galactic corona">
<text>The terms galactic corona and gaseous corona have been used in the first decade of the 21st century to describe a hot, ionised, gaseous component in the galactic halo of the Milky Way. A similar body of very hot and tenuous gas in the halo of any spiral galaxy may also be described by these terms.

==Current hypothetical scenario==
The hypothetical source of the galactic halo of &quot;coronal gas&quot; may be the cumulative output of many “galactic fountains” in the galactic disc ejecting hot gas.

The hypothesis is that a single supernova and then its supernova remnant both produce hot ionized gas that supplies an individual “galactic fountain”. The expelled material forms a giant bubble of high-pressure, low density, hot gas in the denser, cooler gas and dust of the galactic disc. At least some of those bubbles extend high or low enough, vertically, to pierce through the denser disk, and form “chimneys” which exhaust the hot gas into the halo, analogous to a terrestrial geyser spewing out water and steam that is much hotter and much less dense than the surrounding earth, heated by a source hidden deep below.

As the expelled gas in the galactic corona cools, it falls back into the galactic disc, guided by the disc&#x27;s own gravitational attraction, enriching the gas and dust in the disc with the heavy elements (loosely termed “metals” by astronomers) which were produced in supernova precursors, and during supernova explosions. 

==Current research==
Galactic coronas have been and are currently being studied extensively, in the hope of gaining a further understanding of galaxy formation.
However, considering how galaxies differ in shape and size, no particular theory has been able to adequately explain how all galactic coronas are formed and maintained.

<doc id="893363" wikidata="Q1043965" url="?curid=893363" title="Carnegie Hill">
<text>Carnegie Hill is a neighborhood within the Upper East Side, in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. Its boundaries are 86th Street on the south, Fifth Avenue (Central Park) on the west, with a northern boundary at 98th Street that continues just past Lexington Avenue and turns south to 96th Street and proceeds east up to, but not including, Third Avenue. The neighborhood is part of Manhattan Community District 8.

In the 2000s, the perceived northern boundary on Park Avenue has edged over 96th Street into what was traditionally Spanish Harlem, leading to that area sometimes being called Upper Carnegie Hill, especially by real-estate brokers. According to the official Carnegie Hill Neighbors website, the Carnegie Hill neighborhood extends from 86th to 98th Streets, from Fifth Avenue up to, but not including, Third Avenue.

==History==
The neighborhood is named after the mansion that Andrew Carnegie built in 1901 at Fifth Avenue and 91st Street. Today the mansion is the home of the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, a branch of the Smithsonian Institution. Facing it across 91st Street is the Italian palazzo-style Otto H. Kahn House, currently the home of the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic girls&#x27; school. Several townhouses in the area have been converted to schools, including the William Goadby Loew House on 93rd Street (formerly the Smithers Alcoholism Center), currently occupied by the Spence School, and next door, the Virginia Graham Fair Vanderbilt House, converted to a school by the Lycée Français, but sold in 2005 to a private owner.
The architecture of the neighborhood includes apartment buildings along Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue, brownstones (with stoops) and townhouses on the side streets, condos, co-ops and a handful of mansions, of which some are now used by the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, The Jewish Museum, the National Academy of Design, the Dalton School and other organizations. From the 1950s to 1971, the National Audubon Society was housed in the Willard Straight House, a red brick Colonial Revival townhouse at 1130 Fifth Avenue. When it moved to NoHo, the International Center of Photography moved in but later consolidated its operations in Midtown near Bryant Park. In 2001, it again became a private residence.

In 1989, the Jewish Museum demolished its 1963 modernist addition and courtyard, replacing it with a new extension opened in 1993 that mimics the French Gothic details of the Warburg Mansion, the museum&#x27;s home since 1947. The limestone was crafted in Morningside Heights at the Cathedral Stoneworks. Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s originally maligned and now celebrated Guggenheim Museum opened on Fifth Avenue in 1959. The New York Road Runners occupies a townhouse around the corner at 9 East 89th Street, a block informally known as Fred Lebow Place.

Similar to the official lines of the historic district, the borders of the neighborhood form an irregular rectangle and the northern boundary, which traditionally was 96th Street, has on Park Avenue edged into what was traditionally Spanish Harlem.

The northern section neighborhood was once seen as a less fashionable end of the East Side, but is now prized for its aesthetic sensibility, museums, schools, restaurants and neighborhood feel. Besides, Andrew Carnegie, Marjorie Merriweather Post, Margaret Rockefeller Strong and John Hay Whitney all made their homes north of 90th Street.
==Preservation==
The Carnegie Hill Historic District, designated as such by the Landmarks Preservation Commission on July 23, 1974, and then expanded on December 21, 1993, runs from 86th Street in the south to just north of 98th Street in the north. Its western boundary is Central Park, and its eastern boundary varies from Madison Avenue in some parts to Lexington Avenue farther east in others. There are efforts to expand this district to protect structures not designated as landmarks, including 179 East 93rd Street, where the Marx Brothers were raised. Proponents include the 93rd Street Beautification Association and Carnegie Hill Neighbors, organizations which, seeking to preserve the village-like environment, spurred the creation of the historic district and actively monitor its well being. In its more than thirty years of operation, its well-publicized battles have included advocating against an adult education center near the 92nd Street Y, plans for more high rise apartments and additions to existing brownstones.

== Prominent locations ==

* 92nd Street Y is a cultural and community center.

==Education==

Hunter College High School, a highly selective nationally ranked high school, is located at the corner of 94th Street and Park Avenue.

The New York City Department of Education operates public schools such as Lower Lab, one of three gifted and talented programs in NYC.

The main campus of the La Scuola d&#x27;Italia Guglielmo Marconi Italian international school is in Carnegie Hill at 12 East 96th Street.

<doc id="893377" wikidata="Q5935429" url="?curid=893377" title="Whiteway Colony">
<text>Whiteway Colony is a residential community in the Cotswolds in the parish of Miserden near Stroud, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom. The community was founded in 1898 by Tolstoyans and today has no spare land available with over sixty homes and 120 colonists. At the beginning, private property was rejected and personal property shared; however, today the colonists&#x27; homes are privately owned and sold at market value. As the colony abandoned Tolstoy&#x27;s philosophy it has been regarded by many, including Mohandas Gandhi who visited in 1909, as a failed Tolstoyan experiment.

==History==
The colony was set up in 1898 by a Quaker journalist, Samuel Veale Bracher, along with other Tolstoyans. Bracher purchased along with seeds, tools, materials and provisions. The colonists then burnt the property deeds on the end of a pitchfork in a symbolic rejection of the notion of property. Aylmer Maude led the founding board of trustees for the colony. According to Maude, the story by Leo Tolstoy that inspired the commune settlers to come together and found their colony was &quot;Walk in the Light While There is Light&quot;.

The early settlers had utopian socialist ideals, sharing provisions and going back-to-the-land. The founding colonists numbered about eight but over time the community rose to forty with anyone welcome. However Bracher, his family and other founders left the colony soon afterwards as they became increasingly frustrated with the other residents&#x27; idleness.

Early life in the colony was spartan with some residents using a barn as shelter - piped water did not arrive until 1949 and electricity not until 1954. The site was originally open land surrounding Whiteway House but is now heavily wooded and home to a collection of mainly wooden buildings - as no one owns the land, mortgages could not be obtained so people had to build their own houses. A court ruling in 1955 established that nobody owns the legal title for the land. A communal hall was built by residents in 1924 to house social activities and a school, and a swimming pool was built in 1969. Whiteway Colony is still in existence today and houses, among others, descendants of its original settlers. Though it no longer has an explicitly anarchist character, today&#x27;s residents are aware, and proud, of its origins. Traces of them run through the community still, the best examples being the continued use and maintenance of communal facilities (hall, swimming pool and playing field). In addition, the governance of the community is still done by a general meeting of its residents.

Over the years residents have included immigrant anarchists, conscientious objectors and refugees from the Spanish Civil War, as well as co-operative ventures such as Protheroe&#x27;s Bakery, the Cotswold Co-operative Handicraft guild and the Co-operative Gardening Group. For a period the anarchist newspaper &quot;Freedom&quot; was produced here by Thomas Keell.

<doc id="893389" wikidata="Q707291" url="?curid=893389" title="PC World">
<text>PC World (stylized as PCWorld) is a global computer magazine published monthly by IDG. Since 2013, it has been an online-only publication. 

It offers advice on various aspects of PCs and related items, the Internet, and other personal technology products and services. In each publication, &quot;PC World&quot; reviews and tests hardware and software products from a variety of manufacturers, as well as other technology related devices such as still and video cameras, audio devices and televisions.

The current editor of &quot;PC World&quot; is Jon Phillips, formerly of &quot;Wired&quot;. In August 2012, he replaced Steve Fox, who had been editorial director since the December 2008 issue of the magazine. Fox replaced the magazine&#x27;s veteran editor Harry McCracken, who resigned that spring, after some rocky times, including quitting and being rehired over editorial control issues in 2007.

&quot;PC World&quot; is published under other names such as PC Advisor and PC Welt in some countries. &quot;PC World&quot;″s company name is IDG Consumer &amp; SMB, and it is headquartered in San Francisco. Some of the non-English &quot;PC World&quot; websites now redirect to other IDG sites; for example, PCWorld.dk (Denmark) is now Computerworld.dk

==History==
The publication was announced at the COMDEX trade show in November 1982, and first appeared on newsstands in March 1983.

The magazine was founded by David Bunnell and Cheryl Woodard, and its first editor was Andrew Fluegelman. &quot;PC World&quot;″s magazine and web site have won a number of awards from Folio, the American Society of Business Publication Editors, MIN, the Western Publications Association, and other organizations; it is also one of the few technology magazines to have been a finalist for a National Magazine Award.

Many well known technology writers have contributed to &quot;PC World&quot;, including Steve Bass, Daniel Tynan, Christina Wood, John C. Dvorak, Stephen Manes, Lincoln Spector, Stewart Alsop, David Coursey, James A. Martin, and others. Editorial leadership has included Harry Miller, Richard Landry, Eric Knorr, Phil Lemmons, Cathryn Baskin, Kevin McKean, and Harry McCracken.

In February 1999, &quot;PC World&quot;″s number of paid subscriptions reached a record of 1,000,453. At the time, it was the first and only computing magazine with a monthly release schedule to hit that mark. In April 2005, the show &quot;Digital Duo&quot; was slightly rebranded and relaunched as &quot;PC World&#x27;s Digital Duo&quot;, and ran for an additional 26 episodes. As of 2006, &quot;PC World&quot;″s audited rate base of 750,000 made it the largest circulation computing magazine in the world.

On July 10, 2013, owner IDG announced that the magazine would cease its thirty-year print run. The issue of August 2013 was the last printed of the magazine &quot;PC World&quot;, future issues would be digital only.

In December 2024, PCWorld expanded its coverage of personal tech by forming a more formal bond between PCWorld and sister site TechHive, which had been covering smart home and video streaming tech since 2017.

==Countries==
Based in San Francisco, &quot;PC World&quot;″s original edition is published in the United States; however it is also available in other countries (51 in total), sometimes under a different name:
* &quot;PC World&quot; in Albania, Australia, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Brazil, Denmark, Greece, India (from July 2006), Kosovo, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Spain, Romania, Russia, Turkey, Vietnam, Ecuador.
* &quot;PC Advisor&quot; in Ireland and the United Kingdom, which stopped publication in 2017 (Another now discontinued magazine called &quot;Personal Computer World&quot; and a &quot;PC World&quot; retailer  — neither related to the &quot;PC World&quot; magazine  — already exist or existed in those markets.)
* &quot;PC Welt&quot;, is the German language edition.
* &quot;PCW&quot;, is the Hungarian language edition.
* &quot;Info Komputer&quot;, is the Indonesian language edition.
* &quot;Kompiuterija&quot;, is the Lithuanian language edition.
* &quot;Thế Giới Vi Tính&quot;, is the Vietnamese language edition (also called &quot;PC World Vietnam&quot;).

==Controversy==
In May 2007, McCracken resigned abruptly under controversial circumstances. According to sources quoted in &quot;Wired&quot;, McCracken quit abruptly because the new CEO of &quot;PC World&quot;, Colin Crawford, tried to kill an unfavorable story about Apple and Steve Jobs. Crawford responded, calling media reports of McCracken&#x27;s resignation &quot;inaccurate&quot;. CNET later reported that McCracken had told colleagues that IDG &quot;was pressuring him to avoid stories that were critical of major advertisers.&quot;

On May 9, Crawford was transferred to another department, and McCracken returned to &quot;PC World&quot; until his departure in 2008.

<text>Strategic health authorities (SHA) were part of the structure of the National Health Service in England between 2002 and 2013. Each SHA was responsible for managing performance, enacting directives and implementing health policy as required by the Department of Health at a regional level. Initially 28 in number, they were reduced to 10 in 2006. Along with primary care trusts, they were replaced by clinical commissioning groups and Public Health England in 2013 under the Health and Social Care Act 2012.

== History ==
In 2002, the 95 health authorities (HAs) and eight regional offices of the NHS Executive established under the Health Authorities Act 1995, along with 400 or more primary care groups, were abolished by the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002. The functions of the HAs were mostly taken up by 300 primary care trusts (PCTs), and 28 larger strategic health authorities (SHAs) were established (which were reduced in number to 10 in 2006).

20,000 staff changed jobs and the process was often unclear with little clear guidance given. Many of the changes took place in advance of the legislation.

Following 22 public consultations on the boundaries of the proposed SHAs, the names of the 28 new SHAs were announced on 18 December 2001. The 28 new organisations operated in shadow form until section 1 of the Act came into force on 1 October 2002, and they were formally renamed SHAs.

The role of the SHAs was set out in the white paper, &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power within the NHS – Securing Delivery&quot;, and included the following:

The goal was to create a coherent strategic framework for the development of services across the full range of local NHS organisations, including:

* Performance management
* Brokering solutions where there were disputes
* Building capacity and supporting performance improvement
* Preparing and delivering cohesive strategies for capital investment
* Working with workforce confederations (in some unspecified way)
* Ensuring effective professional leadership across their area.

=== Evolution ===
A pivotal event seems to have been a loss of financial control in 2005/6 and a failure of the management system to respond quickly or firmly enough. This, combined with some ministerial ambivalence about the effectiveness of SHAs and a promise in the 2005 election to reduce NHS management spending, led to Patricia Hewitt, Secretary of State for Health to announce that, following an NHS consultation which ended in March 2006, the SHAs were to be reorganized. They were reduced to ten in number by the Strategic Health Authorities (Establishment and Abolition) (England) Order 2006, as amended, and this was expected to produce substantial financial savings.

At the same time there were other important changes that had implications for the functioning of SHAs:

* Span of control – the number of PCTs was reduced to 152 from 302 in 2002 (although there had been a continuous process of mergers).  At the same time, an increasing number of providers were achieving foundation trust status. Both of these changed the nature of the relationships of the intermediate layer to local organisations. 
* Reporting relationships – the role of CEO of the NHS and Permanent Secretary of the DH were separated and the reporting relationship for SHA CEOs moved to directly report to the NHS CEO.
* Top team changes – the top management team was reduced in size from over 50 during the early part of the period to a much more manageable number, and this was accompanied by the development of procedures to reduce the traffic of policies, instructions and requests for information to the service from the centre. 

The period from 2006 saw financial control being restored and key targets were generally achieved. However, further questions about the effectiveness of SHAs and the regulatory process more generally were raised by the 2008 scandal at Mid Staffordshire Hospitals Foundation Trust.

During 2009, SHAs were subject to an assurance process to examine their performance, role in developing their systems and to give developmental feedback.  David Nicholson, NHS Chief Executive, said that the recession was one of several factors that had changed the context: &quot;Part of the reason for doing it is that the SHAs&#x27; responsibilities are changing as we speak&quot;, he said at the time.

SHAs in this period were expected to develop a more directly strategic approach than was the case in the earlier period, following the launch of Lord Darzi&#x27;s &#x27;Next Stage Review&#x27; report in 2008. There were some examples of successful strategic changes being introduced e.g. the implementation of trauma networks, the redesign of stroke services in London, and changes to the shape of services in Manchester, But many strategic issues remained unresolved. This was not helped by the period having an election followed by the introduction of stricter controls on reconfiguration by the incoming government and then an almost two-year period of uncertainty when the government announced its intention to abolish SHAs in May 2010. This led to SHAs being &#x27;clustered&#x27; from ten to four in October 2011.

=== Abolition ===
Strategic health authorities and primary care trusts were abolished on 31 March 2013 as part of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Facilities owned by SHAs were transferred to NHS Property Services, and their public health functions to Public Health England.

== Role ==
Each SHA area contained various NHS trusts which took responsibility for running or commissioning local NHS services, and the SHA was responsible for strategic supervision of these services. The types of trust included: 
* Hospital trust
* Ambulance services trust
* Care trust
* Mental health trust
* Primary care trust (PCT)
The SHAs had the board and governance structures common to all NHS trusts.

These SHAs were replaced by a single London SHA in 2006.

===After 1 July 2006===
The ten SHAs established on 1 July 2006, and abolished on 31 March 2013, were:
#NHS East of England (East of England region)
#NHS East Midlands (East Midlands region)
#NHS London (London)
#NHS North East (North East region)
#NHS North West (North West region)
#NHS South Central
#NHS South East Coast
#NHS South West (South West region)
#NHS West Midlands (West Midlands region)
#NHS Yorkshire and the Humber (Yorkshire and the Humber region)

These SHAs are coterminous with government office regions, except that the large South East England region is divided into two: South Central and South East Coast.

<text>WSRN-FM (91.5 FM, The &quot;Worldwide Swarthmore Radio Network&quot;) is Swarthmore College&#x27;s official campus radio station. It broadcasts out of the suburban Philadelphia borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.

Prior to the 1970s, WSRN operated as a carrier signal broadcast to the campus of Swarthmore College only. The station went on the air with 10 watts on October 15, 1972. Following efforts by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to encourage as many Class D stations as possible to increase power, a campaign was raised by the students of the college, and in the late 1970s, the FCC granted a license for a 110-watt, directional, transmission. Additional information about the history of radio at Swarthmore College can be found in and.

Programming has been eclectic from the 1970s on. Station programming is diverse; music spans &quot;world,&quot; hip hop, blues, folk, rock, pop, R &amp; B, and classical. Talk and comedy programs comprise much of the weekend line-up. Notably &quot;Funk&quot; which ran from fall 2012 to spring 2014 Friday mornings from midnight to 2AM.

In 1986, the main on-air studio was completely refurbished, with a new control panel, turntables, microphones, and wiring installed. 1998 saw the rewiring and modernization of the production studio and the construction of an acoustically isolated sound studio connected to the production studio.

Students have always operated the soundboard, and so, during most summers, the station is dark.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the radio station had periods of limited broadcasting. During the 2021–2022 academic year, a significant effort by students, faculty, staff, and community members was successfully carried out to get the station back up to an operational state. As of April 1, 2022, the station has resumed broadcasting.

<text>Fudbalski klub Voždovac () is a professional football club based in Voždovac, Belgrade, Serbia, which competes in the Serbian First League, the second tier.

Nicknamed &quot;The Dragons&quot;, they experienced little success in the Yugoslavian era, but have become one of Belgrade&#x27;s best and most stable clubs in modern times since Serbia&#x27;s independence.

They are known for their stadion on top of the shopping center.

==History==

The club was formed in 1912, under the name SK Dušanovac and its president in that year was Danilo Stojanović, &quot;Čika Dača&quot; who was also the coach in that year. The club was named after Dušanovac, a suburb in Belgrade where the club was formed. Initially it was a club whose players and followers were mostly students from the Economics Gymnasium. After the end of World War I the club substantially improved however it never archived to be in the top like other clubs such as BSK Belgrade or SK Jugoslavija.

In 1929, it is renamed into Voždovački SK (Voždovački sport klub). The main success in this period was the winning of the II League of Belgrade Football Subassociation in the 1933–34 season, and the III League of Belgrade in 1948–49. In the 1963–64 season, they won the Serbian Republic League, then the Yugoslav third tier, and promoted to the Yugoslav Second League. After Red Star Belgrade&#x27;s new ground &quot;Marakana&quot; was built between 1959 and 1963, Voždovački SK played its home matches on Marakana&#x27;s secondary pitch with bleachers around it.

In 1973, another local club, Sloboda Belgrade, formed in 1953 and Belgrade League champion in 1968, was dissolved. The municipal authorities decided to hand Sloboda&#x27;s ground over to Voždovački, which then changed its name to FK Voždovac. The first major achievement was the winning of the Belgrade Football Association Cup in 1975. During the following three decades Voždovac competed mostly in the lower Serbian leagues, until the season of 2003–04, when they won the Serbian League Belgrade without a single defeat, achieving promotion to the Serbian First League, the national second tier.

On 28 June 2005, Železnik won the Serbia and Montenegro Cup but, struggling financially, merged with Voždovac. As a result, Voždovac gained access to the 2005–06 First League of Serbia and Montenegro, finishing in third place and qualifying for European competition. However, due to the continuing financial difficulties after the merger, club officials decided not to request the license for European competitions.

Ever since the new modern stadium opened in August 2013, the club has been one of the most stable in Serbian football due to having strong sponsorship from the shopping centre outlets that perform business under/within the stadium. A modern approach was taken by the directors of the club to attract a more younger supporter base by focusing on a new cool approach, a modern website was created for the club, which was by far the most attractive of all clubs in Serbian football apart from the big two Belgrade clubs, a new modern crest was also designed which incorporated the club&#x27;s nickname with a red dragon now upon the clubs crest which replaced the old dour crest, The aim was to be different from most other Serbian clubs who either carry/carried communist-era names or their presentation technology wise is dour.

Voždovac finished the 2019/20 season in 8th place under manager Radomir Koković who was fired late in the season due to a run of losses, former player Jovan Damjanović took over the managers role and guided the club to a safe mid table finish.

==Stadium==
The old Voždovac Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium. It was used mostly for football matches and was the home ground of Voždovac, with a capacity of 5,780 people. It was demolished in 2011.

Voždovac play their home games at the Voždovac Stadium located on the fourth floor of a shopping center and it meets all UEFA regulations. It has 5,174 seats, the pitch is 24 meters above ground while the tallest stands are 45 meters above.

The stadium was opened for a league game against Jagodina in the fourth round of the Superliga on 31 August 2013. It is also the first time a Superliga game was played on artificial grass.

==Supporters==

===Groups===
The organized supporters of FK Voždovac are the Invalidi (&quot;Invalids&quot;). However, the first organised supporting group was formed in 1987, and was named Vilenjaci (The Elves). Initially consisted of about 30 members, mostly former and youth players from the neighborhood. Along with Vilenjaci, another group named Zmajevi (&quot;Dragons&quot;) appeared, which is simultaneously the traditional nickname of the club. Vilenjaci grew with time, and they were often involved in disturbs. They made an effort to be original in their supporting. Pirotechnical fireworks were a usual way of provoking match interruptions.

In 1989, another group named Genoes United was formed in the east stand of the stadium, and by that time Zmajevi accepted to join Vilenjaci. Shortly afterwards Genoes also joined Vilenjaci on the western stand. In the season 1989–90 another group was formed, Hasini Trafikari, named after a former club player, nicknamed Hasa. Initially formed in the south stand, they would also ended up merging with Vilenjaci on the western stand. However, when it looked that the group was stronger than ever, it ended up being disbanded.

In 1990, a new group, that was initially more similar to a street gang than to football fans, was formed and named Invalidi. During the 1990s, the group was constantly growing, and besides football their presence was also noticed in other sports events in which the club participated, most notably in women&#x27;s handball. Obviously the most inspiring period for club fans was the period the club competed in the top league. Today the group consists of about 100 young men.

===Friendships===
The fans have a strong friendship with fans of OFK Beograd. They also have good relations with fans of ŁKS Łomża.

<text>Comedy Playhouse is a long-running British anthology series of one-off unrelated sitcoms that aired for 128 episodes from 1961 to 1975. Many episodes later graduated to their own series, including &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, &quot;Meet the Wife&quot;, &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot;, &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot;, &quot;Not in Front of the Children&quot;, &quot;Me Mammy&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Your Funeral&quot;, &quot;The Liver Birds&quot;, &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; and particularly &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, which is the world&#x27;s longest running sitcom, having run from January 1973 to August 2010. In all, 27 sitcoms started from a pilot in the &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; strand.

In March 2014, it was announced that &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; would make a return that year with three new episodes. Two further series each comprising three episodes were broadcast in 2016 and 2017 respectively.

==Background==
The series began in 1961 at the prompting of Tom Sloan, Head of BBC Light Entertainment at the time. Galton and Simpson were no longer writing for Tony Hancock and Sloan asked them to write ten one-offs with the hope that one might become established as a series. Thus, the first two series of &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; were written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, but from the third series onwards, the episodes were written by various writers including the likes of Barry Took, Bernard McKenna, Bob Larbey, Brian Cooke, Carla Lane, Craig Cash, David Croft, Dick Clement, Dick Hills, Doug Naylor, Edwin Apps, George Evans, Graham Chapman, Harry Driver, Jack Docherty, Jack Rosenthal, Jeremy Lloyd, John Esmonde, John T. Chapman, Johnny Speight, Ian La Frenais, Ken Hoare, Kingsley Amis, Jilly Cooper, Marty Feldman, Michael Pertwee, Neil Shand, Pauline Devaney, Peter Jones, P.G. Wodehouse, Richard Harris, Ronald Chesney, Ronald Woolfe, Roy Clarke, Richard Waring, Sid Green and Vince Powell.

== Archive Status ==
The first eight series were made in black-and-white, with the rest from &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot; onwards being in colour. Like many television programmes from the time, many of 1960s &amp; 1970s episodes are lost. As a result, 95 episodes are currently missing from the archives, although audio recordings from the soundtracks of 15 missing episodes have been recovered, short extracts survive from &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; and &quot;Thank You Sir, Thank You Madam&quot;, and a further episode &quot;The Melting Pot&quot; survives as a U-Matic video copy.

In Australia the series was broadcast on ABC Television in the early 1960s-late 1970s.

== Commercial Release ==
The series itself hasn&#x27;t been released on home media, although some of the surviving episodes have been repeated on television or included on DVD boxsets as pilot episodes to their respective series. These include &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; &quot;(The Offer)&quot;, &quot;Meet The Wife (The Bed)&quot;, &quot;All Gas and Gaiters (The Bishop Rides Again)&quot;, &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot;, &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, &quot;Last of the Summer Wine (Of Funerals and Fish)&quot; and &quot;Happy Ever After&quot;. Clips from the series were also featured in the documentary &quot;Comedy Playhouse: Where It All Began&quot;, which was broadcast on BBC1 on 29 April 2014, which featured interviews with actors and writers who participated in the series, including Ray Galton, Alan Simpson, June Whitfield, Bernard Cribbins and Keith Barron.

==Scottish Comedy Playhouse==
The BBC aired six comedy pilots in 1970 in Scotland only under the title &quot;Scottish Comedy Playhouse&quot;, none of which developed onto a full series. While these were being aired, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; was broadcast in the rest of the UK. All episodes from this series were wiped soon after transmission and are currently missing from the archives. The episodes are as follows:

<doc id="893408" wikidata="Q553714" url="?curid=893408" title="Nathaniel Lord Britton">
<text>Nathaniel Lord Britton (1859 – 1934) was an American botanist and taxonomist who co-founded the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, New York.

==Early life==
Britton was born on the 15 of January 1859 at New Dorp, Richmond County, New York (state) to Jasper Alexander Hamilton Britton and Harriet Lord Turner. His parents wanted him to study religion, but he was attracted to nature study at an early age.

He was a graduate of the Columbia University School of Mines and afterwards taught geology and botany at Columbia University. He joined the Torrey Botanical Club soon after graduation and was a member his entire life. Britton was an elected member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He married Elizabeth Gertrude Knight, a bryologist, on August 27, 1885. They had met when she joined the club and were lifelong collaborators in botanical research.

==New York Botanical Garden==
During their honeymoon in 1888, they visited Kew Gardens, which led to his wife proposing a botanical garden for New York at a Torrey Club meeting. Together, they campaigned to bring about the NYBG. Britton left Columbia in 1895 to become the first director of the New York Botanical Garden, a position he held until 1929. He was on the first Board of Managers for the institution, along with Andrew Carnegie, J. Pierpont Morgan, and Cornelius Vanderbilt II. He engendered substantial financial support for the botanical garden by naming plants after wealthy contributors.

==Scientific research==
Much of his field work was done in the Caribbean, where he visited frequently when the winter weather in New York City became too severe. His contributions to the study of Caribbean flora are undisputed.

He wrote &quot;Illustrated Flora of the Northern United States, Canada, and the British Possessions&quot; (1896) with Addison Brown, and &quot;The Cactaceae&quot; with Joseph Nelson Rose.

Britton is also remembered as one of the signatories of the American Code of Botanical Nomenclature that proposed such radical changes to the rules governing nomenclature that a compromise was not reached (and some of the principal American provisions adopted) until nearly 30 years later.

==Death and legacy==
He died at his home in the Bronx on June 25, 1934, after suffering a stroke 9 weeks earlier.

The house he lived and worked in, the Britton Cottage, is preserved at Historic Richmond Town on Staten Island.

The genera &quot;Brittonastrum&quot; (now a synonym of &quot;Agastache&quot; Clayton ex Gronov.), &quot;Brittonella&quot; (a synonym of &quot;Mionandra&quot; Griseb.), &quot;Brittonamra&quot; (which is now a synonym of &quot;Coursetia&quot; DC.), &quot;Brittonia&quot; (synonym of &quot;Ferocactus&quot; Britton &amp; Rose), and &quot;Brittonrosea&quot; (a synonym of &quot;Echinocactus&quot; Link &amp; Otto) and also &quot;Neobrittonia&quot;, as well as the botanical journal &quot;Brittonia&quot; are all named after him.

== Works==
John Hendley Barnhart contributed a bibliography of all of Britton&#x27;s works to &quot;Biographical memoir of Nathaniel Lord Britton, 1859-1934&quot; authored by Elmer Drew Merrill and presented to the National Academy of Sciences at the annual meeting, 1938. In 1960, Henry A. Gleason published &quot;The scientific work of Nathanial Lord Britton&quot;, where he summarized and provided commentary on Britton&#x27;s early botanical activities, botanical organizations, his nomenclatural work, the &quot;Illustrated Flora&quot;, his leadership of the New York Botanical Garden, his &quot;West Indian Flora&quot;, his &quot;North America Flora&quot;, his &quot;Flora of Northern South America&quot;, his &quot;North American Trees&quot;, and his monographic work.

<text>Fotbal Club FCSB (), formerly named and still sometimes referred to as FC Steaua București, is a Romanian professional football club based in Bucharest. It has spent its entire history in the Liga I, the top flight of the Romanian football league system.

The original &quot;Steaua București&quot; football team was founded in 1947 and belonged to the Ministry of National Defence, through the namesake CSA Steaua București sports club. In 1998, the football department and its facilities were separated from the latter and taken over by a group of shareholders in a post-Ceaușescu privatisation scheme, leading to one of the shareholders acquiring full ownership five years later. However, CSA Steaua București has been in conflict with the football club since 2011, claiming that it was a new and separate entity; this resulted in multiple court cases and the forced change of the name from &quot;FC Steaua București&quot; to &quot;FC FCSB&quot; in early 2017.

Domestically, when taken together with the disputed pre-2003 honours, the club has won the Liga I 27 times, Cupa României 24 times, Cupa Ligii two times, and Supercupa României seven times—all competition records. Internationally, they have won the European Cup and European Super Cup, both in 1986. They reached the European Cup final once again in 1989, when they were defeated by AC Milan. Throughout their history, the &quot;Roș-albaștrii&quot; also played the final of the Intercontinental Cup, the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, and the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup.

FCSB&#x27;s home ground is Arena Națională, having moved here from the Ministry of National Defence-owned Stadionul Ghencea. Initially, the club played in the colours of the Romanian tricolour, but the team became associated with the red and blue scheme after yellow soon lost its importance. Recently, some kits have begun reintegrating the latter colour.

The club has a long-standing rivalry with neighbouring Dinamo București, with matches between the two being commonly referred to as the &quot;Eternal derby&quot; or the &quot;Romanian derby&quot;. Another notable rivalry is the one against Rapid București, while several milder ones are disputed against teams outside the capital, including a recent one against CFR Cluj that commenced because of the title competitions these teams fought in the 21st century.

==History==
=== 1947–1949: Foundation and early years ===
&quot;ASA București&quot; (&quot;Asociația Sportivă a Armatei București&quot; – &quot;Army Sports Association&quot;) was founded on 7 June 1947 at the initiative of several officers of the Romanian Royal House. The establishment took place following a decree signed by General Mihail Lascăr, High Commander of the Romanian Royal Army. It was formed as a sports society with seven initial sections, including football, coached by Coloman Braun-Bogdan. The decision had been adopted on the ground that several officers were already playing for different teams, which was premise to a good nucleus for forming a future competitive team.
With this squad, Coloman Braun-Bogdan, the first coach in the club&#x27;s history, went to a sustained training camp in the mountain resort of Sinaia. Although shirts, boots and balls were missing, atmosphere inside the team was rather optimistic. Thanks to sustained efforts, in the shortest time possible, the club soon acquired the first training suits, navy green, duck material of, and the first shirts, blue. The big surprise, however, were the 40 pairs of boots the club had purchased for the 20 selected players. &quot;ASA&quot; was renamed &quot;CSCA&quot; (&quot;Clubul Sportiv Central al Armatei&quot; – &quot;Central Sports Club of the Army&quot;) in 1948 and &quot;CCA&quot; (&quot;Casa Centrală a Armatei&quot; – &quot;Central House of the Army&quot;) in 1950.

=== 1949–1984: CCA Golden Team ===
In 1949, &quot;CSCA&quot; won its first trophy, the Cupa României, defeating CSU Cluj 2–1 in the final. Under the name of &quot;CCA&quot;, the club managed to win three Championship titles in a row in 1951, 1952 and 1953, along with its first Championship–Cup double in 1951. During the 1950s, the so-called &quot;CCA Golden Team&quot; became nationally famous. In 1956, the Romania national team (composed exclusively of CCA players) played Yugoslavia in Belgrade and won 1–0. In the same year, CCA, coached by Ilie Savu, became the first Romanian team to participate in a tournament in England, where it achieved noteworthy results against the likes of Luton Town, Arsenal, Sheffield Wednesday and Wolverhampton Wanderers. After CCA won the 1959–60 title, they were supposed to play in the 1960–61 European Cup against Spartak Hradec Králové who was the champion of Czechoslovakia, but as Romania&#x27;s national team lost with 5–0 on aggregate against Czechoslovakia in the 1960 European Nations&#x27; Cup quarter-finals, when the communist authorities saw that Steaua had to play with the champion of Czechoslovakia in the European Cup, they withdrew the team from the competition, fearing a shameful elimination in front of the Czechoslovakians.At the end of 1961, &quot;CCA&quot; changed its name once again to &quot;CSA Steaua București&quot; (&quot;Clubul Sportiv al Armatei Steaua&quot; – &quot;Army Sports Club Steaua&quot;). The club&#x27;s new name translated to &quot;The Star&quot; and was adopted because of the presence of a red star, a symbol of most East European Army clubs, on its crest. A poor period of almost two decades followed in which the club claimed only three championships (1967–68, 1975–76, 1977–78). Instead, the team won nine national cup trophies, for which matter it gained the nickname of &quot;cup specialists&quot;. Also during this period, on 9 April 1974 Steaua&#x27;s ground, Stadionul Ghencea, was inaugurated with a friendly match against OFK Belgrade. Internally, fierce rivalry with teams like Dinamo București, Petrolul Ploiești and UTA Arad made it more and more difficult for the military team to reach the title, the 1970s and 1980s seeing them win the title only three times under their new name (1967–68, 1975–76, 1977–78). However, during that same period, Steaua won eight National Cups (1961–62, 1965–66, 1966–67, 1968–69, 1969–70, 1970–71, 1975–76 and 1978–79), ultimately being nicknamed &quot;the cup specialists&quot;.
The first half of the 1980s was a very poor period for the club, as no trophies were won for six years. However, several prodigies were transferred, such as Helmut Duckadam, Ștefan Iovan, Miodrag Belodedici, Marius Lăcătuș, Victor Pițurcă, Mihail Majearu, Gavril Balint and Adrian Bumbescu, who would set the basis for the future team. However, these years of search and frustration did no less than to foretell the amazing performances of the 1980s and 1990s.

=== 1984–1990: Champions of Europe ===
Under the leadership of coaches Emerich Jenei and Anghel Iordănescu, Steaua had an impressive Championship run in the 1984–85 season, which they eventually won after a six-year break. What followed was an absolutely astonishing European Cup season. After eliminating Vejle, Honvéd, Kuusysi Lahti and Anderlecht, they were the first ever Romanian team to make it to a European Cup final. At the final, played on 7 May 1986 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium in Seville, Spanish champions Barcelona were clear favourites, but after a goalless draw, legendary goalkeeper Helmut Duckadam saved all four penalties taken by the Spaniards being the first ever Romanian to reach the Guinness Book for that matter, while Gavril Balint and Marius Lăcătuș converted theirs to make Steaua the first Eastern-European team to conquer the supreme continental trophy.

Gheorghe Hagi, Romanian all-time best footballer, joined the club a few months later, scoring the only goal of the match against Dynamo Kyiv which brought Steaua an additional European Super Cup on 24 February 1987 in Monaco, just two months after having lost the Intercontinental Cup 1–0 to Argentinians River Plate in Tokyo. However, that match was marred with a questionable decision by referee José Martínez when he disallowed a clear goal scored by Miodrag Belodedici. 

Surprisingly for those who thought of these performances as an isolated phenomenon, Steaua remained at the top of European football for the rest of the decade, managing one more European Cup semi-final against Benfica (1987–88) and one more European Cup final in 1989, which was lost 4–0 in front of Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard&#x27;s Milan. This happened next to their four additional national titles (1985–86, 1986–87, 1987–88, 1988–89) and four national cups (1984–85, 1986–87, 1987–88, 1988–89). In addition, from June 1986 to September 1989, Steaua ran a record 104-match undefeated streak in the championship, setting a world record for that time and a European one still standing.

During these last years of the Communist regime in Romania, dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s son Valentin was involved in the life of the team. Valentin Ceaușescu admitted in a recent interview that he had done nothing else than to protect his favourite team from Dinamo&#x27;s sphere of influence, ensured by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Though contested by some, their five-year winning streak in the championship between 1984–85 and 1988–89 corroborates the notion that the team was really the best during this period.

=== 1990–2002: Post-Revolution era ===
The Romanian Revolution led the country towards a free open market and, subsequently, several players of the 1980s team left for other clubs in the West. After a short pull-back, a quick recovery followed and Steaua managed a six consecutive championship streak between 1992–93 and 1997–98 to equalize the 1920s performance of Chinezul Timișoara and also three more cups in 1995–96, 1996–97 and 1998–99. At an international level, the club also managed to reach the UEFA Champions League group stage three years in a row between 1994–95 and 1996–97. Other records highly regarded by the fans were the eight-year and six-month long undefeated streak in front of arch-rivals Dinamo București, which counted 19 matches in both the championship and the Romanian Cup, and the 17-year and 7-month long undefeated league run at Ghencea against the same Dinamo. 
At international level, the club managed to reach the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup quarter-finals in 1993, when they lost on away goals to Royal Antwerp, and also to make it to the Champions League group stage three years in a row between 1994 and 1995 and 1996–97. In 1998, the football club separated from CSA Steaua and changed its name to &quot;FC Steaua București&quot;, being led by Romanian businessman Viorel Păunescu. Păunescu performed poorly as a president and soon the club was plunged into debt. George Becali, another businessman, was offered the position of vice-president in the hope that Becali would invest money in the club. 
=== 2002–present: Gigi Becali takeover ===

In 2003, Becali managed to gain control over the club by turning it from non-profit to a public share company. Because of his controversial character, he has been challenged by the majority of Steaua fans. The team qualified for the UEFA Cup group stage in the 2004–05 season and became the first Romanian team to make it to the European football spring since 1993 (also Steaua&#x27;s performance). The next season, Steaua reached the UEFA Cup semi-finals in 2005–06, where it was eliminated by Middlesbrough thanks to a last-minute goal. Steaua thereafter qualified for the following Champions League seasons after a ten-year break, and in 2007–08 Steaua again reached the group stage of the Champions League. Nationally, the club won two titles—in 2004–05 and 2005–06—and the Supercupa României in 2006, the latter being the club&#x27;s 50th trophy in its 59-year history.
In 2013, Steaua won its 24th national title, and also subsequently reached the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage. It repeated the former performance in each of the next two years, being awarded the championship in 2014 and 2015.

After the Ministry of National Defense sued the club, claiming that the Romanian Army were the rightful owners of the Steaua logo, colours, honours and name, the Executive Committee of the Romanian Football Federation approved an application to modify the name of the club from &quot;FC Steaua București&quot; to &quot;FC FCSB&quot; on 30 March 2017, following more judiciary sentences. CSA Steaua București had previously announced they would refound their football department as CSA Steaua București in the summer of the same year. However, owner Becali announced that his team would retain the original honours and UEFA coefficient, and was also hopeful of recovering the name in the near future.

Between 2016 and 2019, FCSB finished each time as runners-up in the league, thus becoming the first club in Romania to do so for four consecutive years. On 5 July 2019, yet another unfavorable ruling was handed out against the team. According to it, CSA Steaua would be the rightful entity to assert the honors up until 2003, however, the decision is not definitive.

==Crest and colours==

=== Crests ===
During its first season, 1947–48, Steaua wore yellow and red striped shirts with blue shorts, to symbolize Romania&#x27;s tricolor flag. Starting with the following season and with the Army&#x27;s change of identity from the Royal Army to the People&#x27;s Army, the yellow was gradually given up, so that the official colors remained, up to this day, the red and the blue.

As communists assumed total control of the country on 30 December 1947, the Royal Army was transformed into the People&#x27;s Army and ASA automatically with it. Being inspired by the Red Army, the new Ministry of Defence decided to create a crest for the club, along with the change of name to CSCA, consisting in an A-labeled red star (symbol of the Red Army) on a blue disc.Two years later, the change of name to CCA brought with it a new crest consisting of the same red star labeled CCA surrounded by a crown of laurel. The all-present star motif on the crest finally had its saying over the new name of &quot;Steaua&quot; as up 1961. It was opted for a badge which, redesigned, remains up to this day the club&#x27;s symbol: the red and blue striped background with a golden star in the middle, to symbolize to Romanian tricolour flag. The shape for the emblem was redesigned in 1974, once the team moved to Stadionul Ghencea.

Following the Romanian Revolution, the Army decided to break all links to the defunct communist regime, so, in 1991, CSA Steaua had a last change of crest with an eagle also present on the Ministry of Defence coat of arms and also on Romania&#x27;s. As FC Steaua appeared in 1998, the club added two yellow stars on top of the CSA Steaua badge signifying its 20 titles of champions won, along with the &quot;Fotbal Club&quot; specification.

In 2003, the new Board of Administration run by George Becali decided to change the crest, which was a return to the old emblem of 1974–1991, redesigned with the two yellow stars on top. The club started to use acronym of the name FCSB before the official change of the name in 2017.

The Ministry of National Defense sued Steaua in 2011, claiming that the Romanian Army were the rightful owners of the Steaua logo, among others. The Supreme Court found in the army&#x27;s favour, and on 3 December 2014 stripped the football club of its badge. Steaua were forced to play their next home game, against CSM Studențesc Iași, without it on the stadium scoreboard. A new badge was unveiled in January 2015, an eight-sided star containing the letters &quot;FCSB&quot;, which would eventually become the official name of the club in 2017.

=== Colours ===
Steaua has never had a standard playing kit. However, the most widely used throughout time was the combination of red shirts, blue shorts and red socks. Other variants have been all-red, all-blue and also shirts in vertical red and blue stripes during the 1960s and 1970s. Other kit colours have very rarely been used. Exceptions were the 1986 European Cup Final in which Steaua wore, for the only time in their history, an all-white kit, the 1999–00 away kit (yellow and red), the 2005–06 third kit (yellow and black), the 2008–2010 away kit (a shade of neon yellow-green), the 2010–12 and 2014–16 away kit (all-yellow), the 2012–14 away kit ( all-sky blue or sky blue shirts with dark navy blue shorts and socks). For the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons, the away kit was all-white. For the 2018–19 and 2019–20 seasons the away kit was ice blue with a darker shade on sleeves. For the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons, the kit is all-white again.
==== Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors ====
Its kit is manufactured by Nike, who have held the contract since 2002, after a long partnership with Adidas. First team shirt sponsors have been betting company Betano since 2022. Previous sponsors include Ford, Castrol, Philips, CBS, Bancorex, Dialog, BCR, RAFO, CitiFinancial and City Insurance.

== Grounds ==
=== Stadium ===

Steaua played the first three matches in its history at the defunct &quot;Venus&quot; stadium. Opened in 1931, the venue had previously been in the property of Venus București, a club disbanded in 1949. After that ground&#x27;s demolition through order of the Communist regime, Steaua played its home matches at any one of Bucharest&#x27;s three largest multi-use stadia: ANEF, &quot;Republicii&quot; (built in 1926 and demolished in 1984 to make room for the erection of the Casa Poporului) and &quot;23 August&quot; (built in 1953). Of these two, 23 August (later renamed &quot;Național&quot;) was mostly used when two matches between Bucharest clubs were scheduled in the same matchday or for important European matches, while Republicii for regular matches in the championship.

From 1974 to 2015, Steaua played its home matches at the Stadionul Ghencea, a football stadium situated in South-Western Bucharest. Part of &quot;Complexul Sportiv Steaua&quot;, it was inaugurated on 9 April 1974 when Steaua played a friendly match against OFK Beograd, at which time it was the first football-only stadium ever built in Communist Romania, with no track &amp; field facilities. The stadium was built through order of the Ministry of National Defence inside a former military base and was long used by CSA Steaua.

The original capacity was 30,000 on benches. A general renovation occurred in 1991; this included installing seats, which dropped the capacity to 28,365. After a second renovation in 2006,

Ghencea was able to host UEFA Champions League events, being a &quot;Category 3&quot; arena according to the UEFA classification system.

The Romania national team was also a tenant for numerous fixtures.

From 2011, Steaua played European games and its most important domestic games at the newly constructed Arena Națională, and from March 2015, played exclusively at the Arena Națională. It also uses Steaua Stadium for selected matches.

=== Training facilities ===

Baza Sportivă ARCOM is a sports complex in Bucharest, Romania. It is currently used only for football matches, is the home ground of FCSB II and FCSB Academy and also used for trainings. The football complex was built by George Becali on the place of the former ARCOM Concrete Plant, after his club was kicked out from Steaua Stadium and Ghencea Sports Complex due to the conflict with Ministry of National Defence and CSA Steaua București. The football complex has 4 grounds (3 with a grass pitch and 1 with an artificial turf) and holds 1,000 people.

==Support==
Steaua has the largest number of supporters of any team in Romania. A survey conducted in June 2007 suggested that the club accounts for approximately 42% of all Romanian football lovers, far greater than the teams ranked second and third, Dinamo București, with 12%, and Rapid București, with 9%.

The largest concentration of fans are in Bucharest, notably in areas adjacent to the arena, covering the whole southern half of Bucharest, a city geographically divided by the Dâmbovița River. Also, the club has an important fan base inside the country, where several towns are renowned for counting vast majorities of Steaua supporters, and outside the borders, among Romanian emigrants.

The Steaua Ultras movement began in 1995, when the bases of &quot;Armata Ultra&quot; (AU), the first Ultras group from Bucharest (and second in Romania after Politehnica Timișoara&#x27;s &quot;Commando Viola Ultra Curva Sud&quot;), were set. The group quickly reached an impressive number of members, but, in 2001, they dissolved due to internal problems. Steaua&#x27;s supporters then divided into several groups, some of them being located at the &quot;Peluza Nord&quot; (&quot;North End&quot; – &quot;Titan Boys&quot;, &quot;Nucleo&quot;, &quot;Insurgenții 1998&quot;, &quot;Skins 1996&quot;, &quot;Combat&quot;, &quot;Armata 47 Vest&quot;), while some other ones taking their place at the &quot;Peluza Sud&quot; (&quot;South End&quot; – &quot;Vacarm&quot;, &quot;Glas&quot;, &quot;E.R.A.&quot;, &quot;Hunters&quot;, &quot;Outlaws&quot;, &quot;Shadows&quot;, &quot;Roosters&quot;, &quot;T.K.&quot;, &quot;Tinerii Sudiști&quot;). Several important groups such as &quot;Stil Ostil&quot;, &quot;Ultras&quot;, &quot;Banda Ultra&quot;&#x27; and &quot;South Boys&quot; retired from attending Steaua&#x27;s matches due to the club&#x27;s constant abuses towards them and, mainly, to the current ownership of Steaua.

More recently, as of 2006, the supporters have formed their own official association, called AISS (&quot;Asociația Independentă a Suporterilor Steliști&quot; – &quot;Steaua Supporters&#x27; Independent Association&quot;). AISS was formed as a legal entity with its stated goals of &quot;protecting the interests and image of Steaua supporters&quot;, as well as &quot;identifying and promoting the club&#x27;s perennial values&quot;.

Steaua&#x27;s &quot;Peluza Nord&quot; and &quot;Peluza Sud&quot; fan groups no longer support the current team, as a sign of protest. The &quot;Peluza Sud&quot; have instead started to attend the matches of CSA Steaua. However, an online poll conducted by Sport.ro in 2017 has shown that of the 120,000 voters, 95% consider FCSB to hold the real Steaua identity. As soon as the leader of the &quot;Skins Berceni&quot; group left prison, some fans of Peluza Nord returned to support the team in Liga I, FCSB. So far the groups are: &quot;Insurgentii Colentina 1998&quot;, &quot;Skins Berceni 1996&quot;, Titan Boys 1996, North boys 2022 and Nucleo 47. 
As Steaua is the most popular club in Romania, there are, besides Bucharest, several cities counting a great majority of red and blue supporters among football lovers. Widely speaking, these cities are predominant in the Eastern half of the country, particularly in the regions of Moldavia, Greater Wallachia and Northern Dobruja. Cities such as Suceava, Piatra Neamț, Bacău, Galați &quot;(inside Moldavia)&quot;, Constanța &quot;(Northern Dobruja)&quot;, Buzău, Brăila, Târgoviște, Călărași &quot;(Greater Wallachia)&quot;, Râmnicu Vâlcea, Târgu Jiu &quot;(Oltenia)&quot;, Brașov, Oradea, Sibiu, Târgu Mureș or Petroșani &quot;(Transylvania)&quot; enjoy a great majority of Steaua fans which are often well-received even by fans of the local teams.

The club is also popular outside the borders, notably between Romanian emigrants. The Valencian Community in Spain accounts for an important number of supporters, being the most important area for this matter.

Steaua fans are also maintaining good relations with the fans of CSKA Sofia of Bulgaria, with whom they share the common root of once representing the teams of their national armies. The bases of these relations date from a UEFA Cup encounter in 2004 between the two clubs. Some ultras are also friends with the ultras from UTA Arad, Corvinul Hunedoara and Farul Constanța, NEC Nijmegen, PAOK FC, CSKA Moscow and Partizan Belgrade. Also, European encounters against Panathinaikos in 1998 and Slavia Praha in 1999 were premises for setting contacts with rival fans of Olympiacos of Greece and Sparta Prague of Czech Republic respectively.

== Club rivalries ==

=== Eternul Derby ===
Steaua&#x27;s most important rivalry is the one against Dinamo București. &quot;Eternul derby&quot; (&quot;The Eternal Derby&quot;) has been the leading Romanian football encounter since 1948, as Steaua and Dinamo are the two most successful football teams in the country. There have been more than 150 matches played so far between Steaua and Dinamo in the Romanian League, the Romanian Cup and also the Romanian Supercup. With 44 titles combined (Steaua – 26; Dinamo – 18), the two sides have won 36 more than the third-most successful Liga I club, Venus București. It is also a match between the former clubs of the Romanian Army (Steaua) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Dinamo). Several clashes between different factions of supporters have often occurred and still occur inside and outside the stadium. The heyday was reached before a match kick-off in 1997, when Dinamo&#x27;s fans set a sector of Stadionul Ghencea&#x27;s &quot;Peluza Sud&quot;, where they were assigned, on fire. On 16 August 2016, during Steaua&#x27;s Champions League play-off 0–5 loss to Manchester City, undercover Dinamo fans displayed a huge message saying &quot;Doar Dinamo București&quot; (&quot;Only Dinamo Bucharest&quot;), which was labelled one of the biggest pranks in football history.

Between October 1991 and April 2000, Steaua counted 19 undefeated official matches facing their rivals, both in the championship and the cup. Also, a period of 17 years and 7 months has been recorded in which Dinamo failed to win away against Steaua in the domestic league.

=== Bucharest Derby ===
The second-most important rivalry was with Rapid București, often called &quot;Bucharest derby&quot;. Several matches throughout the years between Steaua and Rapid have also ended in serious clashes between fans.The two clubs have met over 140 times, starting with Rapid&#x27;s 1–0 win on 4 November 1947. The conflict has become even fiercer after Steaua outpassed Rapid in an all-Romanian quarter-final of the 2005–06 UEFA Cup.The conflict between the fans has become even fiercer since then. The rivalry also extends to other sports. The local sports newspapers said that the two teams were linked up in this quarter-final by the line of the number 41 tram which links the Ghencea Stadium to the Valentin Stănescu Stadium. The rivalry also extends to other sports.

Milder and historical rivalries are also with non-Bucharest-based teams, such as CFR Cluj, Universitatea Craiova, Politehnica Timișoara, Petrolul Ploiești, Universitatea Cluj and a recent one with Astra Giurgiu.

==Ownership and finances==

Steaua has previously been known as the club of the Romanian Army, which founded it in 1947 as a sports society. The Army continues to own the sports society, named CSA Steaua București. The football department, however, separated and turned private in 1998, owned and financed by a non-profit organization called AFC Steaua București, chaired by businessman Viorel Păunescu.

In January 2003, the team turned public under the leadership of investor and former politician George Becali, who had already purchased 51% of the society&#x27;s shares and later on acquired the rest to become the owner of the club. At present, Becali has no official links with FCSB, as he gradually renounced his shares. However, the facts that the current shareholders, that include several nephews of his, are people loyal to him and that he is still in charge of FCSB are obvious. An unofficial explanation for this situation is represented by the heavy amount of unpaid taxes added up by the former governing company, AFC Steaua București, whose payment towards the tax authority was avoided this way by transferring its assets to the new-formed company, with the old association going on liquidation bankruptcy.

George &quot;Gigi&quot; Becali is a highly controversial figure at FCSB, whose involvement in the life of the club and the team has often been described as authoritarian and dictatorial by both the media and the fans.

== Statistics and records ==
FCSB currently boasts itself with the most impressive pedigree in Romania. With 75 seasons spent in Liga I, they are one of only two teams to have played only in the first national league, along with Dinamo București (71 seasons). At the same time, the club is the current record holder for the number of national championships (27), national cups (24), national super cups (6) and the national league cup (2). Between 1993 and 1998, its run of six consecutive national titles won equaled the one of Chinezul Timișoara from the 1920s. Internationally, it is the only Romanian club to have won continental trophies (the European Champions Cup in 1986 and the European Super Cup in 1986) and to have played in the final of the European Cup (in 1986 and 1989). It is the only Romanian club that from 2002 to 2018 managed to qualify in the groups of a European competition
For three years and three months (June 1986 – September 1989), FCSB counted a number of 104 unbeaten matches in the league, establishing, at that moment, a world record and a European one still standing. Also inside the national league, the club counted 112 matches between November 1989 and August 1996 of invincibility at Stadionul Ghencea in Liga I. Its run of 17-straight wins in 1988 is another record, equal to the one held by Dinamo as of one year later. Tudorel Stoica is the player with the most appearances for FCSB in Liga I, a record unlikely to be broken in the nearby future, as none of the current players have entered the top-ten so far. The club&#x27;s all-time top scorer in the league is Anghel Iordănescu with 146 goals, a record that also looks solid, out of the same reason as above-mentioned. Other records are currently owned by former players such as Dorinel Munteanu (most national caps – 134) or Gheorghe Hagi (most goals scored for Romania – 35; most appearances of a Romanian player in the European cups – 93). FCSB&#x27;s longest serving manager is Anghel Iordanescu, with four consecutive years in two spells (1986–1990) and (1992–1993), and Emerich Jenei is the club&#x27;s most successful manager winning the European Cup in 1986. The most successful FCSB player is Marius Lacatus with 21 trophies, surpassing Tudorel Stoica, with 14 trophies.

FCSB&#x27;s Arena Nationala is the largest stadium in Romania. The club&#x27;s highest home attendance was 50,016 in a Europa League quarter-final against Chelsea in 2012–13 season. The modernisation of Ghencea stadium during the 2018–20 and the build of a new stadium make the Ghencea stadium one of the biggest in Romania with a capacity of 31,254 being inaugurated on 7 July 2021, with a match between CSA Steaua and OFK Beograd, the same team with whom they had inaugurated the previous stadium back in 1974. It ended with a 6–0 win for the home team. In August 2018, FCSB signed Florinel Coman from FC Viitorul Constanta for €3 million, the highest transfer fee in club&#x27;s history. In January 2021, FCSB player Dennis Man transferred to Parma Calcio 1913 for a romanian record transfer fee of €13 million. Other records were set by former player Gheorghe Hagi transfer set the record for the transfer fee from the domestic league to a foreign club, with $4,300,000 paid by Real Madrid CF in 1990. On 18 September 2014, in a 2014–15 UEFA Europa League group stage match against Danish side Aalborg BK, FCSB set two competition records: Claudiu Keșerü scored three goals in a span of only 12 minutes, this being the fastest hat-trick in the history of the competition, and with the 6–0 victory over Aalborg BK, Steaua achieved the highest score in the history of the UEFA Europa League, also being the first team to manages to score 6 goals in one match.

== Popular culture ==
As Steaua is currently the most popular football team in Romania, a good number of musicians or TV and film directors have inspired themselves from ideas linked to the Ghencea-based club. Popular reference, however, appeared only after the Romanian Revolution, as before, mass-media programmes were mostly being controlled by the former communist regime. The 2002 Romanian film &quot;Furia&quot; depicts scenes in which Steaua and Dinamo gangs of supporters are fighting on the streets after a direct match between the two sides. Prima TV comedy show &quot;Mondenii&quot; often airs sketches parodying Steaua owner George Becali, the players and other representatives around the club. Pro TV series &quot;La bloc&quot; aired an episode in which characters Nelu and Costel are displayed as representing Steaua in a parking lot match against two other neighbours representing Dinamo.

Several other examples from music can be attributed as Steaua-related. Apart from club anthems played throughout time by &quot;Marcel Pavel&quot;, &quot;Bere Gratis&quot;, &quot;Gaz pe Foc&quot;, an album was released in 2006 as a compilation by &quot;Mircea Vintilă&quot;, &quot;Chicanos&quot;, &quot;Bogdan Dima&quot; and several other artists. &quot;Delikt&quot; and &quot;Ultras&quot; are two former hip hop bands whose members ranked the defunct Armata Ultra&#x27; brigade and would always show up displaying fan materials. Also, &quot;Voltaj&quot;, in their song &#x27;MSD2&#x27;, make reference to the fans in the line &quot;Poți să fii câine sau poți fi stelist&quot; (&quot;You can be a dog or you can be a Steaua fan&quot;).

One of the most famous pop-culture references about the club is the association with Scooter&#x27;s song &quot;Maria&quot;, first sung spontaneously in 2003 by the fans in Peluza Nord after the team would score. Ever since, it has been adopted as an unofficial club anthem and is being played at the stadium at every match, sung together by the supporters. Nonetheless, the song is beginning to lose popularity, mainly because it has become too commercial and many fans do not feel bonded with it any more.

<doc id="893415" wikidata="Q568702" url="?curid=893415" title="DECtape">
<text>DECtape, originally called Microtape, is a magnetic tape data storage medium used with many Digital Equipment Corporation computers, including the PDP-6, PDP-8, LINC-8, PDP-9, PDP-10, PDP-11, PDP-12, and the PDP-15. On DEC&#x27;s 32-bit systems, VAX/VMS support for it was implemented but did not become an official part of the product lineup.

DECtapes are wide, and formatted into blocks of data that can each be read or written individually. Each tape stores 184K 12-bit PDP-8 words or 144K 18-bit words. Block size is 128 12-bit words (for the 12-bit machines), or 256 18-bit words for the other machines (16, 18, 32, or 36-bit systems).

From a programming point of view, because the system is block-oriented and allows random seeking, DECtape behaves like a very slow disk drive.

==Origins==
DECtape has its origin in the LINCtape tape system, which was originally designed by Wesley Clark at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory as an integral part of the LINC computer. There are simple LINC instructions for reading and writing tape blocks using a single machine instruction. The design of the LINC, including LINCtape, was placed in the public domain because its development had been funded by the government. LINCtape drives were manufactured by several companies, including Digital.

In turn, LINCtape&#x27;s origin can be found in the magnetic tape system for the historic Lincoln Laboratory TX-2 computer, designed by Richard L. Best and T. C. Stockebrand. The TX-2 Tape System is the direct ancestor of LINCtape, including the use of two redundant sets of five tracks and a direct drive tape transport, but it uses a physically incompatible tape format (½-inch tape on 10-inch reels, where LINC tape and DECtape used ¾-inch tape on 4-inch reels).

Digital initially introduced the Type 550 Microtape Control and Type 555 Dual Microtape Transport as peripherals for the PDP-1 and PDP-4 computers, both 18-bit machines. DEC advertised the availability of these peripherals in March and May, 1963, and by November, planning was already underway to offer the product for the 12-bit PDP-5 and 36-bit PDP-6, even though this involved a change in recording format. The initial specifications for the Type 550 controller discuss a significant advance beyond the LINCtape, the ability to read and write in either direction. By late 1964, the Type 555 transport was being marketed as a DECtape transport.

The tape transport used on the LINC is essentially the same as the Type 555 transport, with the same interface signals and the same physical tape medium. The LINC and DEC controllers, however, are incompatible, and the positions of the supply and take-up reels were reversed between the LINC and DEC tape formats. While LINCtape supports high-speed bidirectional block search, it only supports actual data read and write operations in the forward direction. DECtape uses a significantly different mark track format to provide for the possibility of read and write operations in either direction, although not all DECtape controllers support reverse read. DEC applied for a patent on the enhanced features incorporated into DECtape in late 1964. The inventor listed on this patent, Thomas Stockebrand, is also an author of the paper on the TX-2 tape system from which the LINC tape was derived.

Eventually, the TC12-F tape controller on the PDP-12 supported both LINCtape and DECtape on the same transport. As with the earlier LINC-8, the PDP-12 is a PDP-8 augmented with hardware support for the LINC instruction set and associated laboratory peripherals.

== Technical details ==

DECtape was designed to be reliable and durable enough to be used as the main storage medium for a computer&#x27;s operating system (OS). It is possible, although slow, to use a DECtape drive to run a small OS such as OS/8 or OS/12. The system would be configured to put temporary swap files on a second DECtape drive, so as to not slow down access to the main drive holding the system programs.

Upon its introduction, DECtape was considered a major improvement over hand-loaded paper tapes, which could not be used to support swap files essential for practical timesharing. Early hard disk and drum drives were very expensive, limited in capacity, and notoriously unreliable, so the DECtape was a breakthrough in supporting the first timesharing systems on DEC computers. The legendary PDP-1 at MIT, where early computer hacker culture developed, adopted multiple DECtape drives to support a primitive software sharing community. The hard disk system (when it was working) was considered a &quot;temporary&quot; file storage device used for speed, not to be trusted to hold files for long-term storage. Computer users would keep their own personal work files on DECtapes, as well as software to be shared with others.

The design of DECtape and its controllers is quite different from any other type of tape drive or controller at the time. The tape is wide, accommodating 6 data tracks, 2 mark tracks, and 2 clock tracks, with data recorded at roughly 350 bits per inch (138 bits per cm). Each track is paired with a non-adjacent track for redundancy by wiring the tape heads in parallel; as a result the electronics only deal with 5 tracks: a clock track, a mark track and 3 data tracks. Manchester encoding (PE) was used. The clock and mark tracks are written only once, when the tape was formatted; after that, they are read-only. This meant a &quot;drop-out&quot; on one channel could be tolerated; even a hole punched through the tape with a hole punch will not cause the read to fail.

Another reason for DECtape&#x27;s unusually high reliability is the use of laminated tape: the magnetic oxide is sandwiched between two layers of mylar, rather than being on the surface as was common in other magnetic tape types. This allows the tape to survive many thousands of passes over the tape heads without wearing away the oxide layer, which would otherwise have occurred in heavy swap file use on timesharing systems.

The fundamental durability and reliability of DECtape was underscored when the design of the tape reel mounting hubs was changed in the early 1970s. The original machined metal hub with a retaining spring was replaced by a lower cost single-piece plastic hub with 6 flexible arms in a &quot;starfish&quot; or &quot;flower&quot; shape. When a defective batch of these new design hubs was shipped on new DECtape drives, these hubs would loosen over time. As a result, DECtape reels would fall off the drives, usually when being spun at full speed, as in an end-to-end seek. The reel of tape would fall onto the floor and roll in a straight line or circle, often unspooling and tangling the tape as it went. In spite of this horrifying spectacle, desperate users would carefully untangle that tape and wind it laboriously back onto the tape reel, then re-install it onto the hub, with a paper shim to hold the reel more tightly. The data on the mangled DECtape could often be recovered completely and copied to another tape, provided that the original tape had only been creased multiple times, and not stretched or broken. DEC quickly issued an Engineering Change Order (ECO) to replace the defective hubs, to resolve the problem.

Eventually, a heavily used or abused DECtape begins to become unreliable. The operating system is usually programmed to keep retrying a failed read operation, which often succeeds after multiple attempts. Experienced DECtape users learned to notice the characteristic &quot;shoe-shining&quot; motion of a failing DECtape as it is passed repeatedly back and forth over the tape heads, and would retire the tape from further use.

== On non-DEC computers ==

Computer Operations Inc (COI) of Beltsville, Maryland offered a DECtape clone in the 1970s.
Initially, COI offered LINC-tape drives for computers made by
Data General, Hewlett-Packard and Varian, with only passing reference to its similarity to DECtape. While DECtape and LINC tape are physically interchangeable, the data format COI initially used for 16-bit minicomputers was distinct from both the format used by the LINC and the format used on DECtape. When COI offered the &quot;LINC Tape II&quot; with support for the DEC PDP-8, PDP-11, Data General Nova, Interdata 7/32, HP 2100, Honeywell 316 and several other computers in 1974, the drive was priced at $1,995 and was explicitly advertised as being DECtape compatible.

In 1974, DEC charged COI with patent infringement. COI, in turn, filed a suit claiming that DEC&#x27;s patent was invalid on several grounds, including the assertions that DEC had marketed DECtape-based equipment for over a year before filing for the patent, that they had failed to properly disclose the prior art, and that the key claims in the DEC patent were in the public domain. The US Patent and Trademark Office ruled DEC&#x27;s patent invalid in 1978. The court case continued into the 1980s.

== DECtape II ==

DECtape II was introduced around 1978 and has a similar block structure, but uses a much smaller tape (the same width as an audio compact cassette). The tape is packaged in a special, pre-formatted DC150 miniature cartridge consisting of a clear plastic cover mounted on a textured aluminum plate. Cartridge dimensions are . The TU58 DECtape II drive has an RS-232 serial interface, allowing it to be used with the ordinary serial ports that are very common on Digital&#x27;s contemporary processors.

Because of its low cost, the TU58 was fitted to several different systems (including the VT103, PDP-11/24 and /44 and the VAX-11/730 and /750) as a DEC-standard device for software product distribution, and for loading diagnostic programs and microcode. The first version of the TU58 imposed very severe timing constraints on the unbuffered UARTs then being used by Digital, but a later firmware revision eased the flow-control problems. The RT11 single-user operating system can be bootstrapped from a TU58, but the relatively slow access time of the tape drive makes use of the system challenging to an impatient user.

Like its predecessor DECtape, and like the faster RX01 floppies used on the VAX-11/780, a DECtape II cartridge has a capacity of about 256 kilobytes. Unlike the original DECtape media, DECtape II cartridges cannot be formatted on the tape drive transports sold to end-users, and have to be purchased in a factory pre-formatted state.

The TU58 is also used with other computers, such as the Automatix Autovision machine vision system and AI32 robot controller. TU58 driver software is available for modern PCs running DOS.

Early production TU58s suffered from some reliability and data interchangeability problems, which were eventually resolved. However, rapid advances in low-cost floppy disk technology, which had an inherent speed advantage, soon outflanked the DECtape II and rendered it obsolete.

<text>Duncan Edmonds (born 1936) is a Canadian businessman, politician, consultant, lobbyist, university professor, and writer. In 1969, he unsuccessfully ran for the leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party.

==Life and career==
Edmonds was born in Toronto, Ontario, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto in 1959. He began doctorate studies at the London School of Economics. He left his graduate studies, never to return, to take a job in Ottawa as an executive assistant in the office of Liberal Opposition Leader Lester Pearson, the future Prime Minister. He next worked as a professor of political studies at Carleton University and became a Dean of Residence at Carleton. He played a major role in organizing the Company of Young Canadians in 1965. He also worked for CUSO, and for Crossroads Africa in the 1960s. From 1963 to 1966 he was Executive Assistant to Paul Martin Sr. in the Department of External Affairs and he chaired Paul Martin Sr.&#x27;s unsuccessful leadership campaign in 1968.

Although Edmonds had no legislative experience, he was the primary opposition to Robert Bend at the 1969 Liberal convention. Some youth delegates were seen burning their membership cards after Bend&#x27;s victory was announced. Edmonds ran in the Winnipeg-area riding of Charleswood in the 1969 provincial election but lost to Progressive Conservative candidate Arthur Moug by over a thousand votes.

Edmonds retired from active politics after this loss. He worked as a consultant and lobbyist in Ottawa during much of the 1970s, first on his own, and then as a co-founder of the firm Public Affairs International, along with Torrance Wylie.

With PAI a success, Edmonds then took a job as senior policy advisor to federal Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark in 1977. Edmonds developed advanced concepts around free trade in North America, but Clark did not pursue this initiative. Edmonds left this job after one year, to return to consulting work with his own firm. The free trade ideas developed by Edmonds would have to wait another decade, for Brian Mulroney&#x27;s rule, to become reality. Clark became Prime Minister in 1979 but was defeated in 1980; during that time, Edmonds continued to advise Clark on an informal basis.

Edmonds returned as a senior policy adviser to Defence Minister Robert Coates when the Tories regained power in September 1984. However, Coates had to resign in early 1985 over an ill-advised visit to a strip club in West Germany while on official business; this escapade constituted a security risk. Edmonds reported the details of this and other matters to senior Canadian civil servants. Mulroney was annoyed that Edmonds had acted as a whistle-blower on Coates, and blacklisted Edmonds from government. This scandal, so soon after the Mulroney government had taken power, foreshadowed the many Tory scandals to come in the years ahead.

Edmonds continued to work in the field of international development, and wrote a book on Canada-United States relations in the mid-1980s. He served as a professor and Chairman of Canadian Studies at Yale University from 1986 to 1988. He was later named Vice Chairman of the McRae Group of Companies, a real estate and development firm based in Arizona and California.

<text>The Hoito Restaurant (often referred to as “The Hoito” by locals) is a Finnish-Canadian restaurant in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada established in 1918 and housed in the bottom floor of the historic Finnish Labour Temple. The Hoito operated continuously on 314 Bay Street, in the historic Bay &amp; Algoma neighbourhood, for more than a century until closing due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. It was one of the oldest co-operatively owned and operated restaurants in Canada. It had been anticipated that the restaurant would reopen in early summer 2022. However, during the early evening hours of December 22 2021, amid on-going renovations, smoke could be seen billowing from the rooftop, and The Hoito restaurant suffered extensive damage when a massive fire burned through the Finnish Labour Temple building above. The building is now gone, with new construction underway.

==Beginnings==
The name &quot;Hoito&quot; is Finnish for the word &quot;care&quot;. The idea for the restaurant came about in a logging camp outside Nipigon, Ontario. IWW union organizer A.T. Hill had come to organize the camp into the union and promote the new Finnish-Canadian socialist newspaper &quot;Vapaus&quot; (&quot;Freedom&quot;). After winning some improvements in the camp, the workers expressed a concern that while being able to find cheap accommodation in the city of Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay), they were unable to find reasonably priced, home-cooked meals. The request to open a co-operative restaurant was taken to the board of directors of the Finnish Labour Temple and approved. 59 people pooled their money together in the form of 5-dollar “comrade loans”. Union organizer A.T. Hill was chosen as the restaurant&#x27;s first manager.

For several decades, workers in the restaurant belonged to the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) union and later to the Canadan Teollisuusunionistinen Kannatusliitto (CTKL or Support League of Canadian Industrial Unionists), the Finnish section of the union, and not, as is often mistaken, to the Communist Party of Canada. The IWW was active in the bushcamps in Northwestern Ontario primarily among Finnish-Canadian bushworkers, and effectively operated as a radical alternative to their rivals in the communist-led unions. The Finnish Labour Temple itself was the Canadian administration for the IWW for a number of years.

When IWW organizer J. A. McDonald visited the Hoito and Finnish Labour Temple in 1926, &quot;it was the activities of the women that he was most impressed by. According to McDonald all the waitresses were members of the IWW, and one of the cooks was a woman who had served a year in a Finnish prison for her activities on behalf of the Reds during the Finnish Revolution of 1918.&quot;.

==Food==

The Hoito Restaurant is best known for the Finnish pancakes they serve to their customers. Thin and the size of a large dinner plate, they are eaten with maple syrup, strawberry sauce or a sprinkle of sugar. Known as &quot;lettu&quot; or &quot;lätty&quot; in Finnish, depending on what part of Finland one is from, they are one of the traditional Finnish foods served at the Hoito. Other items prepared include &quot;viili&quot; (a sour yogurt), Karelian pasty (&quot;karjalanpiirakka&quot;), Karelian hot pot (&quot;karjalanpaisti&quot;), salmon-potato casserole (&quot;lohiperunalaatikko&quot;), &quot;pulla&quot; (sweet cardamon bread), salted fish (&quot;suolakala&quot;), rice pudding (&quot;riisipuuro&quot;), fish soup (&quot;kalakeitto&quot;), pea soup (&quot;hernekeitto&quot;) and Vienna sausage (nakki).

Another well-known dish is &quot;mojakka&quot;, a stew of beef, potatoes and turnips that is seasoned with allspice. The word &quot;mojakka&quot; is not a Finnish word at all, but a term that was coined by the Hoito staff themselves.

==Co-operative restaurant==
Since the restaurant began in 1918, it has operated as a consumer co-operative along Rochdale Principles. Customers can buy yearly membership cards that enable them to vote at the Finnish Labour Temple annual general membership meeting, where the board of directors is chosen for one to two year terms. Workers maintain a degree of workers&#x27; self-management and organize their own work schedules.

==Customers==
The Hoito is a popular place with locals in Thunder Bay, with line-ups for breakfast on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Clientele from all walks of life can be found at the Hoito, ranging from students and blue collar workers, to visiting celebrities, politicians and newsmakers.

Until the 1970s, the dining room featured long communal tables, and customers were able to buy meal tickets. Today, the restaurant operates in a more conventional way, with individual tables and several small communal tables.

<text>Norwich Castle is a medieval royal fortification in the city of Norwich, in the English county of Norfolk. William the Conqueror (1066–1087) ordered its construction in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest of England. The castle was used as a gaol from 1220 to 1887. In 1894, the Norwich Museum moved to Norwich Castle. The museum and art gallery holds significant objects from the region, especially works of art, archaeological finds and natural history specimens. 

The historic national importance of the Norwich Castle site was recognised in 1915 with its listing as a scheduled monument. The castle buildings, including the keep, attached gothic style gatehouse and former prison wings, were given Grade I listed building status in 1954. The castle is one of the city&#x27;s twelve heritage sites, and is managed by the Norfolk Museums Service.

==History==

Norwich Castle was founded by William the Conqueror some time between 1066 and 1075 and originally took the form of a motte and bailey. Early in 1067, William embarked on a campaign to subjugate East Anglia, and according to military historian R. Allen Brown it was probably around this time that the castle was founded. The earliest recorded incident at the castle is in 1075, when it was besieged by troops loyal to William to put down a rebellion known as the Revolt of the Earls, co-led by Ralph de Gael, Earl of Norfolk. Ralph went abroad to try and rally support from the Danes leaving his wife Emma in charge of the garrison. The support failed to materialise and the rebellion was put down. The siege lasted three months and ended when Emma secured promises that she and her garrison would be unharmed and given safe passage out of the country.

Norwich is one of 48 castles mentioned in the Domesday Survey of 1086. Estimates suggest that between 17 and 113 houses were destroyed in the building of the castle. Excavations in the late 1970s discovered that the castle bailey was built over a Saxon cemetery. The historian Robert Liddiard remarks that &quot;to glance at the urban landscape of Norwich, Durham or Lincoln is to be forcibly reminded of the impact of the Norman invasion&quot;. Until the construction of Orford Castle in the mid-12th century under Henry II, Norwich was the only major royal castle in East Anglia.

About the year 1100, the motte was made higher and the surrounding ditch deepened. The stone keep, which stands today, was built on the south west part of the motte between 1094 and 1121. The keep internally had two floors. The entrance was to the upper floor on the eastern side, accessed via an external stone stairway to a forebuilding which became known as Bigod Tower. An area of land surrounding the castle, known as the Castle Fee was immediately brought under royal control, probably for defensive purposes. 

During the Revolt of 1173–1174, in which Henry II&#x27;s sons rebelled and started a civil war, Norwich Castle was put in a state of readiness. Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk, one of the more powerful earls, joined the revolt against Henry. Bigod landed 318 Flemish soldiers in England in May 1174 and with 500 of his own men advanced on and captured Norwich Castle. Fourteen prisoners were held for ransom. When peace was restored later that year, Norwich was returned to royal control.


The castle provided sanctuary to Jews fleeing the violence that erupted against them across East Anglia in Lent 1190, and which reached Norwich on 6 February (Shrove Tuesday). Those Jews unable to find safety inside the castle were massacred. 

The Pipe Rolls, records of royal expenditure, note that repairs were carried out at the castle in 1156–1158 and 1204–1205. Thomas de Burgh ( , ; – ?), younger brother of William de Burgh, Lord of Connacht and Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, and older brother of Geoffrey de Burgh, Bishop of Ely, became the castellan in 1215. 

===The castle as a prison===
Parts of Norwich castle were used as a prison from an early stage. Sometimes the earl in charge of a royal castle refused to allow the sheriff to imprison convicted criminals therein, even though it had been customary to do so. In Edward III&#x27;s reign, an Act of Parliament was passed that gave sheriffs control over the prisons within royal castles. From this time, Norwich castle became the public gaol of the county of Norfolk. The king retained ownership of the castle and continued to appoint a constable to look after it in his name.

The prison reformer John Howard visited six times between 1774 and 1782. He recorded the highest number of inmates at 53; split between felons and debtors. Howard described an &quot;upper gaol&quot; with ten cells, a &quot;low gaol&quot; and a dungeon restricted to male felons. He was especially critical of the limited separate facilities for women prisoners.

John Soane rebuilt the prison between 1789 and 1793. The interior walls of the keep were removed and cells for the male felons built. The debtors and women prisoners were accommodated in a new building adjoining the east side of the keep. This building incorporated but obscured the traditional entrance to the keep, the Bigod Tower. Soane’s design was heavily criticised by antiquarian and architect William Wilkins (1751–1815) in his essay in &quot;Archaeologia&quot; published by The Society of Antiquarians in 1796 Wilkins continued by slating the gutted interior as 

In the 18th century, the castle mound was being used by the city&#x27;s inhabitants as a soil quarry and rubbish dump. Norwich Justices of the Peace petitioned the House of Commons for the fee simple of the castle, shirehall and surrounding grounds to be vested in them. This was granted by Act of Parliament on 12 July 1806, thereby ending more than 700 years of royal ownership. The authorities soon deemed Soane&#x27;s prison inadequate and it was extensively remodelled by Wilkins&#x27;s son, also named William Wilkins. The building work was completed by 1827. Models and plans of the site show that Wilkins retained Soane&#x27;s U-shape structure within the keep but demolished Soane&#x27;s adjoining building and the 1749 rebuilt Elizabethan Shirehall or Sessions House on the north side of the keep. Prisoner accommodation was extended across the top of the castle mound by new wings radiating from a central gaoler&#x27;s house. A new Shirehall was designed by Wilkins in Tudor style and built at the north east foot of the castle hill in Market Avenue. Prisoners would be escorted from the castle cells, down spiral stairs and along a foot tunnel to the crown court in the shirehall.

The castle ceased to be used as a gaol in 1887, following the opening of HMP Norwich on a site adjacent to the Britannia Barracks at Mousehold Heath.

===Notable executions===
Robert Kett
A wall plaque placed at the entrance to the Museum in 1949 commemorates the 400th anniversary of the execution of Robert Kett. The plaque reads 

Kett and his brother William were accused of high treason as leaders of a peasant revolt now known as Kett&#x27;s Rebellion. After capture in Norfolk the brothers were held at the Tower of London and indicted. A special commission of oyer and terminer found both guilty and they were brought back to Norfolk for execution; Robert in Norwich and William in Wymondham. On 7 December 1549 at the behest of Edward VI Robert was &#x27;drawn&#x27; from the Guildhall to the Castle and taken up to the battlements on the west face to be hanged in chains from a gibbet. A figurative roundel by sculptor James Woodford that decorates the central bronze entrance door to Norwich City Hall depicts the hanging.

James Rush

James Blomfield (or Bloomfield) Rush was hanged at the Castle for the double murder of Norwich Recorder, Isaac Jermy and his son at Stanfield Hall near Wymondham on 28 November 1848. The crime, trial and execution excited national as well as local interest. Rush was held in the Castle gaol from early December. His trial took place at the Norwich Assizes and a guilty verdict was pronounced on 4 April 1849. The convicted felon was marched to the scaffold at noon on 21 April 1849 and despatched by hangman William Calcraft in front of thousands of spectators.

=== Conversion to museum and art gallery ===

The castle was bought by the city of Norwich to be used as a museum. The conversion was undertaken by Edward Boardman. Soane&#x27;s cell complex within the keep was swept away and flooring and balconies installed. Norman style arches were built to support the new glazed roof. Wilkins&#x27;s central gaoler&#x27;s house and walled prisoner exercise yards made way for gardens and the cell blocks were converted to viewing galleries. The museum was officially opened by the Duke and Duchess of York on 23 October 1894.

==Architecture==
G. T. Clark, a 19th-century antiquary and engineer, described Norwich&#x27;s great tower as &quot;the most highly ornamented keep in England&quot;. It was originally faced with Caen stone over a flint core. The keep is some by and high, and is of the hall-keep type, entered at first floor level through an external structure called the Bigod Tower. The exterior is decorated with blank arcading. Castle Rising, also in Norfolk, is the only other comparable keep in this respect. Internally, the keep has been gutted so that nothing remains of its medieval layout. The uncertainty surrounding the keep&#x27;s arrangement has led to scholarly debate. What is agreed on is that it had a complex domestic arrangement, with a kitchen, chapel, a two-storey high hall, and 16 latrines. The original Norman bridge over the inner ditch was replaced in around 1825.

===Refacing of the keep===

The outer shell of the keep was extensively repaired in 1835–1839 by the architect Anthony Salvin. Stonemason James Watson completely refaced the keep with Bath stone, faithfully reproducing the original ornamentation. The etcher and watercolourist Edward Thomas Daniell was one of the vociferous opponents of the refacing. A letter he wrote published in the &quot;Norwich Mercury&quot; in August 1830 referred to the &quot;scandalous re-facing of the ancient keep&quot;. Although Daniell was living in London during this period, letters to his friends the artist Henry Ninham and the botanist Dawson Turner reveal the extent of his opposition. In a letter to Turner, Daniell wrote, &quot;I have had a very beautiful drawing made of it, and I mean to etch it the size of the drawing. I can only say that if my etching be half as much like the castle, or half as good as the drawing, it will be more like, than anything yet done, of that very beautiful relic.&quot; To Ninham he wrote, &quot;Show me by a plan, how high they have got pulling down, and enable me to judge whether even now in the eleventh hour, any good can be done; and I in return will just inform you, how I stand with regard to my plate. It stands precisely as it did when I left Norwich.&quot; His etching of the old keep, however, was never completed.

==Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery==

The castle remains a museum and art gallery and still contains many of its first exhibits. The museum&#x27;s fine art collection includes costumes, textiles, jewellery, glass, ceramics and silverware, and a large display of ceramic teapots. The fine art galleries feature works by the early 19th century Norwich School of painters as well as English watercolour paintings, Dutch landscapes and modern British paintings from the 17th to 20th centuries. The castle also houses a good collection of the work of the Flemish artist Peter Tillemans. Other galleries include Boudica and the Romans, the Anglo-Saxons (including the Harford Farm Brooch) and Natural History which displays the Fountaine–Neimy butterfly collection. An unusual artefact is the needlework by Lorina Bulwer at the turn of the twentieth century whilst she was confined in a workhouse. The work has featured on BBC television.

===Exhibit highlights===

&quot;The Paston Treasure&quot; is a painting commissioned around 1663 either by Sir William Paston (1610–1663), or by his son Robert (1631–1683). The identity of the artist is unknown, however it is likely that it was a Dutch artist working in a studio at the principal residence of the Pastons at Oxnead. The artwork can be placed within the mid-seventeenth century Dutch still life tradition, with elements that conform to the genre of vanitas. Still life paintings usually feature one or two objects which are artists&#x27; stock items, included only for their symbolism. On the other hand, the majority of the objects represented in &quot;The Paston Treasure&quot; were all real, as they correspond to an existing item in the inventories of the Pastons&#x27;. Therefore, it was not exclusively commissioned as a &quot;memento mori&quot;, but also as a record for the family&#x27;s wealth and own collection and perhaps commemorative of the death of family member, William Paston.

In 2018, the painting formed the centre piece of an exhibition curated by Francesca Vanke, &quot;The Paston Treasure: Riches &amp; Rarities of the Known World&quot;. The exhibition reunited the painting with some of the objects depicted for the first time in nearly three hundred years.
The Happisburgh hand axe is made of flint, and measures 12.2 cm × 7.8 cm. The discovery of this Lower Palaeolithic hand axe in 2000 along the Norfolk coast at Happisburgh transformed our understanding of early human occupation in Britain. Dated and shown to be 500,000 years old, it is amongst the oldest handaxes ever discovered in the UK. Analysis of pollen in the silt allowed the archaeologists to build a picture of temperate woodland with the existence of pine, alder, oak, elm and hornbeam trees in evidence at the time the handaxe was made.

The Cavalry Parade Helmet and Visor was found in the River Wensum at Worthing in 1947 and 1950 respectively. The items, of Roman origin, date to the first half of the third century CE. They are an important testimony of the presence of Roman army personnel in central Norfolk during the later period of the Roman occupation. The helmet is made from a single sheet of gilded bronze, highly decorated as to represent a feathered eagle&#x27;s head on the crest, foliate-tailed beasts on either side and a plain triangular front panel with feather borders on either side at the top, with the lower ends terminating in birds&#x27; heads. The visor mask complements the helmet by carrying similar repoussé decoration, depicting Mars on one side and Victory on the other. These two objects are not a fitting pair, although they can be considered together as each would have originally had been coupled with a similar complementary object.
The unique Anglo-Saxon ceramic figurine now known as Spong Man was found in 1979 in Spong Hill. The figure is shown sat on a chair decorated with incised panelling and is leaning forwards with head in hands wearing a round flat hat. It is likely to have once sat on the lid of a pagan funerary urn and is a unique object in North Western Europe. Although it is labelled as a man, its gender is unclear, as there are no distinctive anatomic details. Exactly why this figurine was created is still a mystery. It is the earliest Anglo-Saxon three-dimensional figure ever found. It may be a representation of a deity whose identity is now lost, but it is still a great artifact that reminds us how little we know about religion in this early migration period across northern Europe.

Also known as neck-rings, torcs were a characteristic kind of jewel used in the Iron Age across Europe. They would have been worn by prominent people within society as a symbol of status and power. The rare tubular gold torc known as the Gold Tubular Torc came from the Snettisham Treasure. It was found in 1948 at Snettisham, alongside a large number of other torcs, carefully disposed in the ground, confirming that burial rituals had great significance within the people of Late Iron Age Norfolk.

Also known as &quot;The Seven Sorrows of Mary&quot;, the &quot;Ashwellthorpe Triptych&quot; has significant connections with South Norfolk and its long trading tradition with Holland. This Flemish altarpiece was commissioned by the Norfolk family of the Knyvettes of Ashwellthorpe. Christopher Knyvettes was sent by King Henry VIII to the Netherlands in 1512, when he commissioned this painting to Master of the Legend of the Magdalen. Both Christopher and his wife Catherina are represented kneeling to Mary, mother of Jesus in the foreground of the composition, showing their religious devotion and wealth.

Dragons in England are famous through the legend of Saint George, however, they have always been particular important in Norwich since the medieval period. The Norwich Snapdragon was made to reflect the civil power and wealth of the city within Norfolk and was used during a procession which combined the celebration of the city&#x27;s saint and the installation of the new major of the town. The Snapdragon at the Norwich Castle, known as Snap, is the last complete example of the civic snapdragon. Like all others, it was built to contain one person, its body is made of basketwork, painted with gold and red scales over a green body and red underside, while the person&#x27;s legs were hidden within a canvas &#x27;skirt&#x27;.

&quot;Norwich River: Afternoon&quot; by the Norwich School of Painters artist John Crome. The Norwich Society of Artists was founded in 1803 by Crome and Robert Ladbrooke and brought together professional painters and drawing masters such as John Sell Cotman, James Stark, George Vincent as well as other talented amateur artists, who were often inspired by the East Anglian landscape, and were influenced by Dutch landscape painters. This oil on canvas is considered one of the finest works made by Crome. It depicts the River Wensum, near New Mills, at St Martin&#x27;s Oak, close to where the artist lived, in Norwich.

The Norfolk Regiment First World War Casualty Book is a unique graphic record of the Norfolk Regiment&#x27;s participation in the First World War. It records details of more than 15,000 soldiers from the regular and service battalions in 1914 to their return home in 1919. Each entry of the book contains the soldier&#x27;s name, service number, battalion and details of their health. It also records those who perished in action.

Part of a quartet of rare examples of English medieval art, the stained-glass roundel depicting December is an example of the Norwich School of stained-glass. It shows clear Flemish influences, and it is possible that it has been made by one of the Norwich Strangers, immigrants of the sixteenth century from the Low Countries. It is thought to have been made for the Major Thomas Pykerell&#x27;s house. originally there would have been twelve roundels depicting the Labours of The Months, a popular pageant in Norwich during that period. This roundel in particular depicts the King of Christmas. Of the original twelve only four now survive, depicting December, September, probably March and either April or November.

<text>Doyle Lafayette Alexander (born September 4, 1950) is an American former pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees, Texas Rangers, Atlanta Braves, San Francisco Giants, Toronto Blue Jays, and Detroit Tigers.

== Early life ==
Doyle Lafayette Alexander was born on September 4, 1950, in Cordova, Alabama. Alexander attended Woodlawn High School in Birmingham, Alabama. He later attended Jefferson College in Hillsboro, Missouri.

==Major League career==
After being drafted by the Dodgers in 1968 in the 9th round, Alexander debuted in the big leagues in 1971 with the team. He was acquired along with Bob O&#x27;Brien, Sergio Robles and Royle Stillman by the Baltimore Orioles from the Dodgers for Frank Robinson and Pete Richert at the Winter Meetings on December 2, 1971. He enjoyed his first winning season with the Orioles in 1973 when he went 12–8 with a 3.86 ERA.

Alexander was traded along with Ken Holtzman, Elrod Hendricks, Grant Jackson and Jimmy Freeman from the Orioles to the New York Yankees for Rick Dempsey, Scott McGregor, Tippy Martinez, Rudy May and Dave Pagan at the trade deadline on June 15, 1976. He went 10–5 to help the Yankees win the American League East division. He did not pitch during the American League Championship Series, so he was tapped to start Game 1 of the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds, which he lost.

Alexander took advantage of the advent of free agency by signing with the Texas Rangers on November 23, 1976. He rejected the Yankees over the team&#x27;s refusal to guarantee him twenty starts a season. He enjoyed one good year before falling apart. He would then join the Atlanta Braves and San Francisco Giants after his stint with Texas. It would not be until he signed with the Toronto Blue Jays during the 1983 season, after being released by the New York Yankees, that he would return to form.

The Blue Jays were on the rise in the mid-1980s, and Alexander was an instrumental part of their success, winning 17 games in both 1984 and 1985, including the division-clinching win over the Yankees in 1985. In the ALCS, however, he went 0–1 with an 8.71 earned run average in two starts as the Blue Jays fell to the Kansas City Royals in seven games. When Alexander negotiated his contract with the Blue Jays, the team refused to pay Alexander if he injured himself while hunting. Toronto lawyer Gord Kirke worked out a compromise in which Alexander would collect money while hurt, &quot;only if he was following all hunting regulations and wearing an orange hunting jacket&quot;.

A slow start the next year resulted in Alexander being traded to the Atlanta Braves, who dealt him in turn to the contending Detroit Tigers midway through the 1987 season for a then unknown minor-leaguer named John Smoltz. The Tigers got more than they could have possibly hoped for in Alexander, who went 9–0 with a 1.53 ERA to propel the Tigers to the division title. However, he struggled again in the ALCS, going 0–2 with a 10.00 ERA, bringing his postseason totals to 0–5 with an 8.38 ERA. The following year, Alexander went 14–11 with a 4.32 ERA, earning his only All-Star appearance. In 1989, his performance declined (6–18, 4.44 ERA) in part due to pitching with a fractured jaw. He retired following the season. Although Alexander performed fairly well for the Tigers, the Braves ended up getting the better end of the trade in the long run; Smoltz would go on to pitch twenty years with the Braves and became a Hall of Famer. Alexander (and Smoltz) have been cited many times since 1987 because the Tigers-Braves trade was indicative of a deal in which each team sought something different and received it: the Tigers wanted Alexander to bolster them in the short-term (which he did by helping them reach the playoffs in 1987 and pitching well for Detroit in 1988) and the Braves wanted Smoltz to contribute to their long-term rebuilding plans (which he did by having a long Hall of Fame career and contributing to Atlanta&#x27;s rise as one of MLB&#x27;s most enduringly successful franchises since 1991).

<doc id="893432" wikidata="Q1432810" url="?curid=893432" title="Clothes line">
<text>A clothes line, also spelled clothesline, also known as a wash line, is a device for hanging clothes on for the purpose of drying or airing out the articles. It is made of any type of rope, cord, wire, or twine that has been stretched between two points (e.g. two posts), outdoors or indoors, above ground level. Clothing that has recently been washed is hung over the line to dry, held in place using clothes pegs or clothespins. Washing lines are attached either from a post or a wall, and are frequently located in back gardens, or on balconies. Longer washing lines often have props holding up the mid-section so the weight of the clothing does not pull the clothesline down to the ground.

More elaborate rotary washing lines save space and are typically retractable and square or triangular in shape, with multiple lines being used (such as the Hills Hoist from Australia). Some can be folded up when not in use. The notable con man Steve Comisar once sold a solar powered clothes dryer advertised in national magazines as a scientifically proven, space age method of drying clothes using only the power of the sun. Customers received a length of clothesline. In Scotland, many tenement buildings have a &quot;drying green&quot;, which is a communal area predominantly used for clothes lines. A &quot;drying green&quot; may also be used as a recreational space for tenants. A clothes horse refers to a clothes line that is connected to a pulley system inside which can be used in the cold winter weather.

==Comparison with clothes dryer==

Both clothes lines and clothes dryers serve the same purpose: drying clothes that have been recently washed, or that are wet in general. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using a clothes line instead of a mechanical dryer:

===Advantages===
* Saves money.
* Zero greenhouse gas emissions per load (2 kg CO2eq of greenhouse gas emissions from the average mechanical clothes dryer per load).
* Less fabric wear and tear.
* Laundry items do not shrink (hot air from a mechanical clothes dryer may shrink items).
* No static cling and no perfume smells throughout the neighborhood from fabric softener and anti-static dryer sheets.
* Laundry items stay softer to the touch (mechanical clothes dryers tend to remove short, soft, fine fibers), and may be less wrinkled.
* Laundry items often do not need ironing if line dried in a breeze.
* Avoids the potential of airborne lint and reduced air quality.
* Eliminates the noise from a mechanical clothes dryer.
* Does not vent indoor air to the outside and waste the large volume of conditioned (heated or cooled) air that a mechanical dryer&#x27;s blower does.
* For a simple line drying arrangement (rope and clothes pins) the repair and replacement costs are about $20.00 per 1,000 loads of laundry or 2 cents per load. For non-commercial mechanical clothes drying the repair and replacement costs (including labor expenses) are about $200.00 per 1,000 loads of laundry or 20 cents per load.

===Disadvantages===
* Putting laundry on a line usually takes more time than putting it into a mechanical dryer (as laundry items have to be hung up and fixed one by one).
* Laundry items need to be hung indoors during rainy weather, or may get wet if the weather changes.
* Neighbors may find it aesthetically unpleasant.
* Exposing laundry can lessen privacy, showing information about inhabitants&#x27; living habits.
* There may be a risk of theft or vandalism of clothes depending on where the clothes are hung.
* Environmental contaminants such as soil, dust, smoke, automotive or industrial pollutants, pollen and bird and animal droppings can come in contact with clothing.
* Clothespins can leave imprints on the clothes.
* The line presents a hazard to pedestrians, depending on line mounting height, pedestrian height, and lighting conditions.

==Drying laundry indoors==
Laundry may be dried indoors rather than outdoors for a variety of reasons including:

* inclement weather
* physical disability
* lack of space for a line
* reduce the damage to fabrics from sun&#x27;s UV rays
* legal restrictions
* to raise the humidity level indoors, and lower the air temperature indoors
* convenience
* to preserve privacy and as a safeguard against vandalism

Several types of devices are available for indoor drying. A clotheshorse can help save space in an apartment, or clothes lines can be strung in the basement during the winter. Small loads can simply be draped over furniture or a shower curtain pole. The drying time indoors will typically be longer than outdoor drying because of the lack of direct solar radiation and of the convective assistance of the wind.

The evaporation of the moisture from the clothes will cool the indoor air and increase the humidity level, which may or may not be desirable. In cold, dry weather, moderate increases in humidity make most people feel more comfortable. In warm weather, increased humidity makes most people feel even hotter. Increased humidity can also increase growth of fungi, which can cause health problems.

An average-sized wash load will convert approximately of ambient heat into latent heat that is stored in the evaporated water, as follows. A typical 4 kg load of laundry can contain 2.2 kg of water, after being spun in a laundry machine. To determine how much heat has been converted in drying a load of laundry, weigh the clothes when they are wet and then again after the clothes have dried. The difference is the weight of the water that was evaporated from them. Multiply that weight in kg by 2,257 kJ/kg, which is the heat of vaporization per kilogram, to obtain the number of kilojoules that went into evaporating the water, or multiply by 0.6250 kWh/kg to get kilowatt-hours. If the moisture later condenses inside the house, the latent heat will return to ambient heat which could increase the temperature of the air in the room slightly. To obtain a good approximation of the effect this would have in a particular situation, the process can be traced on a psychrometric chart.

==Factors that determine the drying duration==
Various factors determine the duration of drying and can help to decide whether to use a drier or a clothes line
* Placement of clothes line
* The environmental temperature - increase of temperature decreases the drying duration
* The environmental humidity - decrease of humidity will decrease the drying duration
* Wind velocity - Sometimes people put a fan near the clothes when drying them indoors
* Direct sun - usually only the external line will be exposed to direct sun, so usually people put the thickest clothes on the most external line.
* Cloth thickness

==Drying laundry in freezing conditions==
Laundry may be dried outdoors when the temperature is well below the freezing point. First, the moisture in the laundry items will freeze and the clothing will become stiff. Then the frost on the clothes will sublimate into the air, leaving the items dry. It takes a long time and it is usually much quicker to dry them indoors, but indoor drying transfers heat from the air to water vapor, so it is a trade-off between speed and energy efficiency. The added humidity cancels out the reduction in air temperature to some extent.

==North American controversy==
Controversy surrounding the use of clothes lines has prompted many governments to pass &quot;right-to-dry&quot; laws allowing their use. According to Ian Urbina, a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;the majority of the 60 million people who now live in the [United States&#x27;] roughly 300,000 private communities&quot; are forbidden from using outdoor clothes lines.

, the states of Florida, Colorado, Hawaii, Arizona, California, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin had passed laws forbidding bans on clothes lines, while Utah allows local jurisdictions to forbid such bans. At least eight states restrict homeowners&#x27; associations from forbidding the installation of solar-energy systems, and lawyers have debated whether or not those laws might apply to clothes lines. British filmmaker, Steven Lake, released a documentary in 2011 titled &quot;Drying for Freedom&quot; about the clothes-line controversy in the United States.

In Canada, the province of Nova Scotia&#x27;s first NDP government passed &quot;An Act to Prevent Prohibitions on the Use of Clotheslines&quot; on December 10, 2010 to allow all homeowners in the province to use clotheslines, regardless of restrictive covenants. The province of Ontario lifted bans on clothes lines in 2008. Some affluent Canadian suburban municipalities such as Hampstead, Québec or Outremont, Québec prohibit clotheslines.

<doc id="893433" wikidata="Q1824705" url="?curid=893433" title="Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol">
<text>Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) is a proprietary wireless LAN authentication method developed by Cisco Systems. Important features of LEAP are dynamic WEP keys and mutual authentication (between a wireless client and a RADIUS server). LEAP allows for clients to re-authenticate frequently; upon each successful authentication, the clients acquire a new WEP key (with the hope that the WEP keys don&#x27;t live long enough to be cracked). LEAP may be configured to use TKIP instead of dynamic WEP.

Some 3rd party vendors also support LEAP through the Cisco Compatible Extensions Program.

An unofficial description of the protocol is available.

== Security considerations ==
Cisco LEAP, similar to WEP, has had well-known security weaknesses since 2003 involving offline password cracking. LEAP uses a modified version of MS-CHAP, an authentication protocol in which user credentials are not strongly protected. Stronger authentication protocols employ a salt to strengthen the credentials against eavesdropping during the authentication process. Cisco&#x27;s response to the weaknesses of LEAP suggests that network administrators either force users to have stronger, more complicated passwords or move to another authentication protocol also developed by Cisco, EAP-FAST, to ensure security. Automated tools like ASLEAP demonstrate the simplicity of getting unauthorized access in networks protected by LEAP implementations.

<text>The Thunder Bay Art Gallery is Northern Ontario&#x27;s largest art gallery specializing in the work of contemporary Indigenous artists. It is located on the campus of Confederation College in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. The Thunder Bay Art Gallery is the largest public gallery between Sault Ste. Marie and Winnipeg, featuring over 4,000 sq/ft of exhibition space.

As a non-profit, public art gallery, the Thunder Bay Art Gallery exhibits, collects, and interprets art with a particular focus on the contemporary artwork of Indigenous and Northwestern Ontario artists. The Gallery advances the relationship between artists, their art, and the public, nurturing a life-long appreciation of contemporary visual arts among visitors to Thunder Bay and community members of all ages.

The Thunder Bay Art Gallery opened on Feb 6, 1976 when funds were secured to construct a National Exhibition Centre on the campus of Confederation College. The Gallery was one of 26 newly established national exhibition centres opened in Canadian communities.

By 1982, the Thunder Bay National Exhibition Centre and Centre for Indian Art – as the Gallery was called then – had expanded into three exhibition galleries, a collection storage area, and new capacity for exhibition and acquisition of art.

Today, the Thunder Bay Art Gallery has over 1600 works of art in its Permanent Collection. The Permanent Collection includes work by Norval Morrisseau, Carl Beam, Daphne Odjig, Robert Houle, Joane Cardinal-Schubert, Shelley Niro, Bob Boyer, Susan Ross, and Benjamin Chee Chee.

The Gallery provides school tours, hosts artistic events or shares our space with community groups.

A new 37,500 ft² Thunder Bay Art Gallery, designed by architects Patkau and Brook McIlroy with landscape architecture by Janet Rosenberg &amp; Studio, is currently under construction on the city&#x27;s waterfront, set to open in 2025.

<text>FC Wil (&quot;Fussball Club Wil 1900&quot;) is a football club based in Wil, Switzerland. They play in the &quot;Sportpark Bergholz&quot;, which has a total capacity of 6,048. The club has consistently played in the Swiss second tier since regaining promotion in 1992, aside from two seasons in the Nationalliga A between 2002 and 2004. They won the Swiss Cup in 2004 their only major honour.

The club considers its primary purpose to be a stepping stone for young players and work closely together with FC St. Gallen. It has contributed to the development of several players that currently play in the Super League, some of whom appeared in the Swiss national team, most notably Fabian Schär.

==History==

=== Early years ===
FC Wil was formed in 1900 in the east of Switzerland by two workers from England. Initially, they were known as &quot;FC Stella&quot;. In 1902 the club was renamed as &quot;FC Fors,&quot; before taking their hometown&#x27;s name in 1907.

After ceasing operations in World War I and a revival in 1920, the club achieved promotion to the second division in 1922 before being forced to withdraw from the competition due to losing most of their players. Thanks to a particularly talented youth team, which won the Swiss youth competition in 1937, the club was able to build a base for a new team. They soon achieved several promotions in 1943, 1945, 1949, and 1952 to reach the Nationalliga B, from where they were relegated in 1954 as their golden generation began to retire.

From there, the club spend several decades in the lower leagues until in 1988, where the club appointed Christian Gross as player manager. Gross managed the club between 1988 and 1993 and achieved two promotions to reach the NLB for the second time, before leaving for Grasshopper Club Zürich.

=== Promotion to Nationalliga A ===
In 2002 Wil were promoted to the top flight for the first time in history. They achieved a 4th place in their first season, earning themselves a place in the Intertoto Cup. The following season, they reached the third round in their European debut, losing to FC Nantes. A week after a record-breaking 11–3 win against local rivals FC St. Gallen, club president Andreas Hafen was discovered to have embezzled 51 million Swiss francs (US$40 million) from the UBS Bank. He was given a jail term of five years. Approximately 10 million Swiss francs was discovered to have ended up at the club, whose repayment UBS waived as the other board members knew nothing of it.

After the Andreas Hafen saga, the club was taken over by Ukrainian footballer Igor Belanov and his time in charge of the club was marked by a frequent changes of coaches. FC Wil won the final of the Swiss Cup against Grasshopper Club Zürich while at the same time being relegated to the second division, under the management of Aleksandr Zavarov (who, lacking the necessary UEFA licence to be a coach, was officially given the position of director of football).

=== Recent history ===
In July 2015, FC Wil was taken over by Turkish investors &quot;MNG group&quot;. After an 18-month involvement with the team they abruptly pulled out in January 2017, leaving the club to its own devices. A task-force has formed as a result to save the club from bankruptcy, with the mission of significantly reducing the exorbitant expenses introduced by the investors.

Roger Bigger returned as president to stabilize the club, after having resigned with the arrival of the investors. However, he definitively stepped down in November 2017, having led the club since 2003. As a result, the club has elected a new board consisting of members based in the region. Contrary to the former investors&#x27; ambitions to play in the Europa League, it pledged to return to its roots as a team that focuses on developing and furthering the careers of younger players, settling securely in the Challenge League.

<text>Mnemic is a Danish heavy metal band formed in Aalborg in 1998. The band personally describes themselves as &quot;Future Fusion Metal&quot;. The band dissolved in 2013, but in February 2024, the band announced their reunion, and will start touring in 2025.

Mnemic have charted in the top 100 in Denmark with &quot;The Audio Injected Soul&quot; and were the first Danish metal band to open the Orange Stage at Roskilde Festival in 2004, one of Europe&#x27;s biggest mainstream festivals. They have worked with Down and Fugees producer Warren Riker on the &quot;Passenger&quot; album, collaborated with Roy Z (Judas Priest and Bruce Dickinson producer), and were featured on the soundtracks of &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot; and &quot;Nordkraft&quot; films.

==History==

===1998–2004: Formation and &quot;Mechanical Spin Phenomena&quot;===
Mnemic (the Greek word for &quot;memory&quot; and an acronym for &#x27;Mainly Neurotic Energy Modifying Instant Creation&#x27;) was formed in the town of Aalborg, Denmark in 1998, by vocalist Mark Bai, guitarist Mircea Gabriel Eftemie, guitarist Rune Stigart, bassist Mikkel Larsen and ex-Invocator session drummer Brian Rasmussen. Some times later, Bai left the band to pursue other interests and was replaced by Michael Bogballe. The band were signed to Nuclear Blast Records, and produced their first album &quot;Mechanical Spin Phenomena&quot; in 2003 with producer Tue Madsen. After the recording of the album, Larsen was replaced by ex-Grope bassist Tomas &quot;OBeast&quot; Koefoed.

The band toured with Disbelief, Darkane, Mystic Prophecy and Death Angel in Europe, and alongside Machine Head in Germany.

===2004–2006: &quot;The Audio Injected Soul&quot;, vocalist change===
In 2004, Mnemic recorded their second album &quot;The Audio Injected Soul&quot;, at AntFarm Studios in Århus, Denmark with Madsen. The album was notable for including a cover version of Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Wild Boys&quot;, and also for being the first album in the world to be recorded using binaural recording technology. This style of recording allowed enhanced audio for listeners with special head sets. The album debuted at 97 in the national Danish album charts.

The album spawned two music videos, &quot;Deathbox&quot; (directed by Patric Ulleaus), which was filmed at the Revolver Studios in Gothenburg, and &quot;Door 2.12&quot;, which was filmed in Berlin.

In 2005, vocalist Bøgballe left the band and was replaced by former Transport League and B-Thong vocalist Tony Jelencovich. Jelencovich filled in for the band&#x27;s North American tour with Meshuggah, but was subsequently replaced in April 2006 by ex-Scarve vocalist Guillaume Bideau.

===2006–2010: &quot;Passenger&quot;===
Mnemic&#x27;s third studio album, titled &quot;Passenger&quot;, was produced by Christian Olde Wolbers of Fear Factory, featuring artwork by Asterik Studios, and guest vocals by Jeff Walker (of Carcass and Brujeria) and Shane Embury (of Napalm Death and Brujeria). The album spawned a music video for the song &quot;Meaningless&quot;, directed by Patric Ullaeus of the Revolver Film company.

The album was released in February 2007, with the Japanese version containing a bonus track, titled &quot;Zero Synchronized&quot;.

===2010–2012: &quot;Sons of the System&quot;, departures===
Mnemic&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Sons of the System&quot; was distributed via Nuclear Blast Records, and released in Europe on 15 January 2010 and in North America on 26 January 2010. It was recorded in the band&#x27;s own studio, with producer Tue Madsen (who worked with the band on previous releases &quot;Mechanical Spin Phenomena&quot; and &quot;The Audio Injected Soul&quot;). &quot;Sons of the System&quot; includes 11 tracks, plus three bonus tracks (including a worldwide iTunes exclusive and a remix available in North America only). The band described the production of the album as &quot;Very eclectic, very diverse, and nothing that you would imagine coming from a band like us. Let&#x27;s just say it has become more theatrical, more electronic, and just more catchy, as we have put all our focus on writing good songs and not being afraid of experimenting.&quot; 

In 2011, longtime members of Mnemic guitarist Rune Stigart, bassist Tomas Cowan Koefoed and drummer Brian Rasmussen left the band, leaving Mircea Gabriel Eftemie as the only original founding member.

===2012–2013: &quot;Mnemesis&quot;, disbandment, death of Bideau===
The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Mnemesis&quot;, was released in June 2012, their first album with new members guitarist Victor-Ray Salomonsen Ronander, bassist Simone Bertozzi and drummer Brian Larsen. In November 2013 the band announced that guitarist Victor-Ray Salomonsen Ronander had chosen to leave the band and they will play one final show with him in Copenhagen on 28 November 2013, before taking a break. Later in 2013, the band disbanded, though no official announcements were ever made. 

Vocalist Guillaume Bideau died on May 24, 2022 at the age of 44. No cause of death was given.

===2024–present: Reunion===
In February 2024, the band announced their reunion, and will start touring in 2025 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;The Audio Injected Soul&quot;, with that era&#x27;s lineup of Eftemie, Stigart, Koefoed, Rasmussen and Bøgballe.

<text>Frank A. Langella Jr. (; born January 1, 1938) is an American actor known for his roles on stage and screen. He eschewed the career of a traditional film star by making the stage the focal point of his career, appearing frequently on Broadway. He has received four Tony Awards as well as nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, an Emmy Award, and two Golden Globe Awards. Langella also portrayed Richard Nixon in the stage production of Frost/Nixon and its movie reprisal. 

He made his Broadway debut in the 1966 play &quot;Yerma&quot;. He since established himself as Broadway star winning four Tony Awards, his first two for Best Featured Actor in a Play playing intellectual lizard in Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Seascape&quot; (1975), and a wealthy and cruel landowner in Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;Fortune&#x27;s Fool&quot; (2002) and Best Actor in a Play for his roles as Richard Nixon in Peter Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot; (2007), an elderly man suffering from alzheimers in Florian Zeller&#x27;s &quot;The Father&quot; (2016). He was also Tony-nominated for &quot;Dracula&quot; (1978), &quot;Match&quot; (2004), and &quot;Man and Boy&quot; (2012).

His reprisal of the Nixon role in the film production of &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot; directed by Ron Howard earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Langella&#x27;s other notable film roles include parts in &quot;Diary of a Mad Housewife&quot; (1970), Mel Brooks’s &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1970), &quot;Dracula&quot; (1979), &quot;Dave&quot; (1993), &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; (1999), &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; (2005), &quot;Starting Out in the Evening&quot; (2007), &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot; (2010), &quot;All Good Things&quot; (2010), &quot;Robot &amp; Frank&quot; (2012), &quot;Noah&quot; (2014), &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Trial of the Chicago 7&quot; (2020).

On television, he portrayed Supreme Court Justice Warren Burger in the HBO movie &quot;Muhammad Ali&#x27;s Greatest Fight&quot; (2013) and Senator Richard Russell Jr. in the HBO film &quot;All the Way&quot; (2016). Langella also had a recurring role as Gabriel, the KGB handler for the lead characters in the FX series &quot;The Americans&quot; (2013–2017) and Sebastian Piccirillo in the Showtime tragicomedy series &quot;Kidding&quot; (2018–2020).

==Early life==
Langella, an Italian American, was born January 1, 1938 in Bayonne, New Jersey. He is the son of Angelina Barbato (b. 1915) and Frank A. Langella Sr. (1913–1991), a business executive who was president of the Bayonne Barrel and Drum Company. Langella attended Washington Elementary School and Bayonne High School in Bayonne. After the family moved to South Orange, New Jersey, he graduated from Columbia High School in the South Orange-Maplewood School District in 1955 and later graduated from Syracuse University in 1959 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama.

==Career==
=== 1963–1989: Early roles and breakthrough ===
Langella appeared off-Broadway (in &quot;The Immoralist&quot; at the Bouwerie Lane Theatre in 1963 and Robert Lowell&#x27;s &quot;The Old Glory&quot; in 1965 among other shows) before he made his first foray onto a Broadway stage in New York in Federico García Lorca&#x27;s &quot;Yerma&quot; at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, on December 8, 1966. He followed this role by appearing in William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;A Cry of Players&quot;, playing a young, highly fictionalized William Shakespeare opposite Anne Bancroft in 1968.

Bancroft suggested Langella to her husband Mel Brooks, who cast him in a leading role in &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1970). The same year, he also appeared in Frank Perry&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Mad Housewife&quot;, being nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer. Langella won his first Tony Award for his performance in Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Seascape&quot; in 1975 and was nominated again for what may have been the performance for which he was best known in the early part of his career: the title role of the 1977 Broadway production of &quot;Dracula&quot;. Despite his initial misgivings about continuing to play the role, he was persuaded to star opposite Laurence Olivier in the subsequent film version directed by John Badham.

Langella continued to juggle film and television with his stage work, playing Sherlock Holmes in a 1981 adaptation of William Gillette&#x27;s play &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. He repeated the role on Broadway in 1987 in Charles Marowitz&#x27;s play &quot;Sherlock&#x27;s Last Case&quot;. That same year, he portrayed the villain Skeletor in &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;, one of his favorite parts. In 1988, he co-starred in the film &quot;And God Created Woman&quot;. In 1982 Langella portrayed Antonio Salieri the Broadway production of &quot;Amadeus&quot; replacing Ian McKellen. During this time he also acted in &quot;Passion&quot; in 1983, Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Design for Living&quot; in 1984, Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;After the Fall&quot; in 1984, and David Rabe&#x27;s &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; in 1985. He also portrayed Prospero in the revival of William Shakespeare revival &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

=== 1990–2008: Broadway acclaim and &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot; ===
In 1993, he made a three-episode appearance on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; as the devious Bajoran Minister Jaro Essa. That same year, he also starred in the political comedy &quot;Dave&quot; starring Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver. He also played a supporting role in the Ivan Reitman comedy &quot;Junior&quot; alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny DeVito, and Emma Thompson. In 1994, he narrated the &quot;American Masters&quot; documentary on Tennessee Williams. In 1996, Langella starred in the Broadway revival of August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;The Father&quot;. That same year, Langella starred in the comedy film &quot;Eddie&quot;, starring Whoopi Goldberg, with whom he was involved romantically until 2000. He also played Clare Quilty in the 1997 film adaptation of &quot;Lolita&quot;, starring Jeremy Irons and Melanie Griffith. In 1999, he starred opposite Johnny Depp in Roman Polanski&#x27;s film &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;.
In 2000, Langella played Ebenezer Scrooge in a musical version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; at Madison Square Garden. He has also appeared in notable off-Broadway productions, including in the title role of Robert Kalfin&#x27;s Chelsea Theater Center production of &quot;The Prince of Homburg&quot;, which was filmed by PBS for the Theatre in America series.

Langella&#x27;s film work also includes roles in George Clooney&#x27;s &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; (2005) as former CBS chief executive William S. Paley, for which he was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Ensemble Cast. He also appeared in Bryan Singer&#x27;s &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006) as &quot;Daily Planet&quot; editor Perry White. Langella received critical acclaim as well as the Boston Society of Film Critics Award in 2007 for his sensitive portrayal of an elderly novelist in &quot;Starting Out in the Evening&quot;. 

=== 2009–2019: Established career ===
In late 2009, he starred in the Richard Kelly film &quot;The Box&quot; with Cameron Diaz and James Marsden. In 2010, he played Louis Zabel in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot;, alongside Michael Douglas, Shia LaBeouf, and Carey Mulligan. That same year, he played a supporting role in &quot;All Good Things&quot;, with Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst. In 2011, Langella starred in the drama thriller &quot;Unknown&quot;, opposite Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger. In 2012, he earned critical praise for his role in the independent film &quot;Robot &amp; Frank&quot;, with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine calling his performance &quot;a masterclass in acting&quot;.

In 2013, Langella starred as Chief Justice Warren E. Burger in the Stephen Frears&#x27; HBO film &quot;Muhammad Ali&#x27;s Greatest Fight&quot;, with Christopher Plummer playing Justice John Marshall Harlan. In October and November 2013, Langella played King Lear at the Minerva, Chichester Festival Theatre in Chichester, UK. The play travelled to the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York in 2014. Langella also played Cleveland Browns owner Anthony Molina in the movie &quot;Draft Day&quot;, which also starred Kevin Costner, Jennifer Garner, and Dennis Leary. In 2015, Langella joined the cast of FX&#x27;s critically praised drama &quot;The Americans&quot; with Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys. He appeared in seasons 3 through 5.

In 2016, he played the title role in Doug Hughes&#x27; production of the US premiere of Florian Zeller&#x27;s play &quot;The Father&quot; at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre on Broadway. He won his fourth Tony Award for that performance. That same year, he appeared in &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; with Viggo Mortensen and was again nominated with the ensemble cast for the Screen Actors Guild Award. He also starred in the HBO television movie &quot;All the Way&quot; (2016) as Senator Richard Russell Jr., with Bryan Cranston as Lyndon B. Johnson. Langella received a Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie/Miniseries nomination for his performance. From 2018 to 2020, Langella appeared as Sebestian in Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Kidding&quot;, starring Jim Carrey. The show&#x27;s executive producer was Michel Gondry, and it received positive reviews.

=== 2020–present ===
In 2020, he played Judge Julius Hoffman in Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s &quot;The Trial of the Chicago 7&quot;. The film follows the Chicago Seven, a group of anti-Vietnam War protesters charged with conspiracy and crossing state lines with the intention of inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It was released in September, by Netflix.

In 2022, following investigations into claims of sexual harassment on set, Langella was fired from &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; and replaced by Bruce Greenwood. In a guest column for &quot;Deadline&quot;, he claimed to have been &quot;canceled&quot; and denied allegations of unacceptable behavior while telling his version of events; this included calling cast members &quot;baby&quot; or &quot;honey&quot;, in addition to describing guidance from an intimacy coordinator as &quot;absurd&quot; and ultimately going against the agreed blocking for a scene, leading his scene partner to walk off set.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage and relationships ===
Langella has dated actresses Diane Baker and Elizabeth Taylor. He was married to Ruth Weil from November 6, 1977, to their divorce in 1995. They have two children, Frank III and Sara. He also lived with actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg, whom he met on the set of &quot;Eddie&quot;, from 1995 until they separated in 2000.

===Memoir===
Langella published a memoir in 2012 called &quot;Dropped Names: Famous Men and Women As I Knew Them&quot;.

In a review in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, Ada Calhoun wrote that &quot;Langella&#x27;s book celebrated sluttiness as a worthy—even noble—way of life. There was so much happy sexuality in this book that reading it was like being flirted with for a whole party by the hottest person in the room. It was no wonder Langella was invited everywhere.&quot;

<text>FC Lovech (; formerly Litex Lovech) is a Bulgarian professional football club based in Lovech, that competes in the Second League. The club was founded in 1921 as Hisarya Sports Club and was known as Litex Lovech from 1996 to 2024.

The club&#x27;s home ground is the Gradski Stadion, which has a capacity of 8,100 seats, electric floodlights and permission to stage European matches. As one of the successful Bulgarian clubs outside the capital Sofia, Lovech have won the domestic championship four times and the Bulgarian Cup on four occasions. Together with CSKA Sofia and Levski Sofia, Lovech was also the four football club to represent the country regularly in the European Club Association.

==History==

===1921–1996===

The club was founded in 1921 as Hisarya and began playing league football two years later, in 1923. Over the years, the club has changed its name several times. From 1957 it was named Karpachev, before becoming Osam in 1979. Under that name the club played constantly in the B Group, the second division of Bulgarian football and was near to promotion several times. A notable player during this period was Plamen Linkov, who broke the club&#x27;s appearance record, playing 575 matches and scoring 167 goals respectively.

In 1990, after Bulgaria&#x27;s transition to market economy, privately owned company LEX became the main sponsor of the club. During the same year, the new owners changed the name of the football club to LEX. The 1993–94 B Group proved to be impressive for the club, as the team finished first in the second division and qualified for the A Group, a notable milestone never done before in the club&#x27;s history. LEX&#x27;s debut season in the A Group was also noteworthy, as the team ranked 11th at the end of the season. The next season however proved to be unsuccessful and the club, renamed Lovech, was relegated to the B Group. 

===Grisha Ganchev ownership (1996–2016)===

In June 1996, the club was purchased by Grisha Ganchev, petrol businessman and a citizen of Lovech, and it was renamed to Litex. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players. Ferario Spasov was named as the new Litex coach. He led the club back to the A Group at their first attempt. During the 1996–97 season Litex also reached the quarter-finals of the Bulgarian Cup and the final of the Bulgarian League Cup, which was lost after a penalty shoot-out.

In 1997, Litex was promoted for the second time to the top division and immediately became Bulgarian champions, finishing the season 5 points ahead of the second-placed Levski Sofia, unprecedented in the Bulgarian football history. The striker of the team Dimcho Belyakov also became top goalscorer with his 21 goals contributed during the season. In addition, midfielder Stoycho Stoilov received the Best Player of the League award. In the club&#x27;s first appearance in European club competition, Litex eliminated Swedish club Halmstads BK 4–3 on aggregate, reaching the second qualifying round, where it was knocked out by Spartak Moscow.

A year later Litex successfully defended their league title, losing only two league games during the course of the season. They became the first provincial club to win back-to-back league titles since the 1920s. During their campaign, Litex also inflicted the biggest defeat in CSKA Sofia&#x27;s history, an 8–0 thrashing at the Lovech Stadium.

During the first decade of the 21st century, Litex won the Bulgarian Cup four times—in 2001 after defeating Velbazhd Kyustendil 1–0 in extra time, in 2004 against CSKA after a penalty shoot-out, in 2008 after a 1–0 win over Cherno More Varna, and in 2009, after a 3–0 thrashing over Pirin Blagoevgrad. In early August 2007, Litex signed a three-year sponsorship and advertising contract with Bulgarian mobile operator GLOBUL and started the 2007–08 season with the logo of the mobile service i-mode on the team&#x27;s kits. In December 2007, Litex became the first Bulgarian club to have a branded mobile phone game, Litex Football. Before the start of the 2008–09 season, Litex lost the Bulgarian Supercup final with 0-1 from CSKA Sofia after a goal from Kiril Kotev in the 65th minute. A season later, Litex again failed to win the Bulgarian Supercup final, this time against domestic title holders Levski Sofia.

In 2009–10, Litex became champions of Bulgaria for the third time in their history, finishing the season with 12 points advantage over the runners-up CSKA Sofia. On 12 August 2010, Litex defeated Beroe 2–1 to finally secure the Bulgarian Supercup, the last remaining domestic trophy never won before by the club. In 2010–11 Litex retained their fourth league title, securing the championship after a 3–1 away win against Lokomotiv Sofia on 21 May 2011.

===Expulsion and Daniel Ganchev era (2015–2024)===
In the summer of 2015, Grisha Ganchev stepped down from his position as an owner, only to reallocate his main investments to Bulgarian football club CSKA Sofia, which was struggling financially with unpaid debts during the time. As a result, his son Danail took over at Litex, with previous shareholder, Bulgarian joint stock company Sport 96, remaining as a subsidiary of Litex Commerce JSC.

On 16 December 2015, the Bulgarian Football Union expelled Litex Lovech from the A Group. The decision was taken in response to an incident that occurred during Litex Lovech&#x27;s 12 December tie with Levski Sofia, when chairman Stoycho Stoilov controversially pulled the squad off the field in protest after two players were sent off with Lovech leading 1–0. On 20 January 2016, the team was administratively relegated to the B Group for the following 2016–17 season. Litex&#x27;s players however were allowed to complete their participation in the Bulgarian Cup and finish the 2015–16 season with the club&#x27;s reserve squad, Litex Lovech II, playing in the B Group.

On 27 May 2016, the company that represented PFC Chavdar Etropole, PFC Chavdar EAD, was renamed PFC CSKA-1948 AD. On 6 June 2016, the representative of PFC Litex Lovech, PFC Litex-Lovech AD, was renamed PFC CSKA-Sofia EAD, with PFC CSKA-1948 AD being written in as its owner. That company later successfully applied to take part in the reformed First League, as PFC CSKA Sofia. The shift was made because the former company that represented PFC CSKA Sofia, PFC CSKA AD, did not gain a professional license, and later went bankrupt, ceasing operations as of 9 September 2016. PFC Litex Lovech was demoted to the Third League, taking the place of FC Botev Lukovit.

On 4 July 2016, former Litex player Zhivko Zhelev was appointed as a manager of a team that consisted mainly of academy players. Litex managed to win its first match of the new season. The squad also played in the 2016–17 Bulgarian Cup, eliminating First League outfits Slavia Sofia and Cherno More on their way to the semifinals, where Litex lost to reigning five-time champions Ludogorets Razgrad on an aggregate score of 0–11. Litex also was promoted to the Second League, after winning the North-West Group of the Third League.

===Return to Lovech Municipality (2024–present)===
On 17 May 2024, Litex Commerce JSC announced that they will return the ownership of the club to the Lovech Municipality and the team would drop the company name. On 30 May 2024, the deal was finalised and the club become owned by Lovech Municipality. Zhivko Zhelev was announced as the new manager of the club on 17 June 2024. On 18 July the team announced that the new name would be FC Lovech, despite the chance to return to the old name Osam Lovech.

FC Lovech&#x27;s(Or then Litex Lovech)home ground is the Lovech Stadium, a football stadium in Lovech. Built in 1962, the ground underwent a total reconstruction in 1999 and was brought to a suitable standard to host international matches later that year. The stadium has a capacity of 8,000 seating places with pitch dimensions of 105 to 68 meters. The venue&#x27;s record attendance of 12,500 was achieved during a domestic league match against Levski Sofia on 19 April 1998.

In the summer of 2010, a massive reconstruction of the venue started. New side stands with roof covers were built and the media sectors were expanded in order to meet the UEFA guidelines for Champions League matches. On 12 July 2010, the stadium was awarded with a Category 3 ranking by UEFA. The reconstructions continued in the summer of 2011, when the main stand of the stadium was completed.

<text>The Gamsbart (, literally &quot;chamois beard&quot;, plural Gamsbärte) is a tuft of hair traditionally worn as a decoration on trachten-hats in the alpine regions of Austria and Bavaria.

Originally worn as a hunting trophy and made exclusively from hair from the chamois&#x27; lower neck, &quot;Gamsbärte&quot; are today manufactured on a large scale from various animal hair, examples of which include goat, antelope, and badger. They are commonly sold by specialized dealers and also at souvenir shops.

A &quot;Gamsbart&quot; is made by enclosing the lower end of the tuft of hair in a setting of metal or horn that allows the upper end to spread in a brush-like fashion. Traditionally, hairs are selected for a dark color at the lower end with a very light tip. The size and diameter of the &quot;Gamsbart&quot; are important signs of the wearer&#x27;s pride and manliness.

Traditionally, &quot;Gamsbärte&quot; are exclusively placed on hats worn by men; however, recent developments in dirndl fashion have seen &quot;Gamsbärte&quot; added to various places on female dresses.

<doc id="893460" wikidata="Q242022" url="?curid=893460" title="War of the Worlds (1988 TV series)">
<text>War of the Worlds is a science fiction television series that ran for two seasons, from October 7, 1988 to May 14, 1990. The series is a continuation of the 1953 film &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, a loose adaptation of the 1898 novel of the same title by H. G. Wells, using the same war machine designs and often incorporating aspects from the film, radio adaptation, and the original novel into its mythology.

Though the original film&#x27;s producer, George Pal, envisioned a TV follow-up sometime in the 1970s, it was not until the late 1980s that a series was finally realized, this time by television producer Greg Strangis. The show was a part of the boom of first-run syndicated television series being produced at the time. It was later shown in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel.

The series was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

== Premise ==
According to the series, rather than being killed outright by germs at the end of the 1953 film, the aliens had all slipped into a state of suspended animation. Their bodies were stored away in toxic waste drums and shipped to various disposal sites within the United States (ten such sites are known to exist in the country) and a widespread government cover-up combined with a condition dubbed “selective amnesia” has convinced most people that the invasion had never happened.

Although the original movie narration had explicitly stated that the aliens were Martians (even featuring artwork indicating an alien city on the planet Mars), since 1953 the concept of vastly intelligent life on Mars had lost plausibility. In the series, the aliens are revealed to actually be from Mor-Tax—a garden planet 40 light-years away in the Taurus constellation orbiting a dying sun.

Thirty-five years later, in 1988 (modern day when the series began), a terrorist group calling itself the People&#x27;s Liberation Party accidentally irradiates the drums containing the aliens while raiding the dumpsite near Fort Jericho. The radiation destroys the bacteria that were keeping the aliens unconscious. Once free, the aliens take possession of the bodies of the six terrorists who overran the site. From there they use a series of human bodies and crudely adapted Earth technology to find means of appropriating the planet, both in removing humanity and developing a permanent means to inoculate themselves against the planet&#x27;s indigenous bacteria. Their attempt to successfully make Earth into their new homeworld is imperative, for in roughly five years three million colonists from Mor-Tax are expected to arrive.

== Plot ==
=== First season ===
Opening narration (spoken in voice-over by Martin in character as Blackwood):

Along with other sci-fi/horror series that ran in syndication in the late 1980s (such as &quot;Friday the 13th: The Series&quot; and &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot;), &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; constantly pushed the “acceptable content” envelope, regularly featuring violence on par with the R-rated horror movies of the time. Gore is commonplace in the first season: dead aliens and their tossed-away hosts’ bodies melt in a grotesque puddle and the ruthless Mor-Taxans have no compunctions about torturing or mutilating any human who gets in their way. One of their trademark methods of murder would be gouged-out eyes courtesy of the third arm that would often burst out from their chest.

During the first season, the aliens are led by a triumvirate known as the Advocacy. They are a part of their society&#x27;s ruling class, overseeing the invasion force on Earth while their leaders, the invisible and never heard Council, remain back on Mor-Tax. Outfitted throughout most of the season in contamination suits that pump coolant to counteract the killing heat of the radiation they need, they stay in their base of operation: a cavern in the Nevada desert, which is perfect due to the ambient radiation from atomic bomb tests. Due to the risks to their lives, they rarely venture into the outside world because without the Advocacy the lower classes would have no guidance and be useless.

Their goal is to pick up where they left off in 1953 by making way on Earth for the three million colonists heading in exodus from their dying world. Their major objective in order to accomplish this terraforming is to remove humanity from the planet. The aliens’ hatred of human beings goes beyond simple prejudice. Having come from a planet that can be compared to the Garden of Eden based on its description, the aliens see that humans do nothing but desecrate what they would call a paradise, and most importantly, a new home. Without humans in the way, they can restore the vegetation, and better replicate the conditions of their deceased world. To carry out a successful war, they seek out weapons (some of which are their own left behind from previous visitations), help amass their army, and engage in infiltration and all sorts of acts of warfare. But to make things more problematic, they must also find immunity against the germs that befell them in 1953.

The simplicity of the alien invasion storyline is countered in the first season by the addition of anomalous entities whose motives are only partially explained:

* Quinn: An alien trapped in a human host since the invasion of ’53, mysteriously immune to bacteria, and ready to play both of the major warring factions against each other for his own favor.
* The Qar’To: An unknown alien race represented by a synthetic lifeform sent to Earth, they want the Mor-Taxans dead and humanity preserved, but for sinister reasons.
* Project 9: A shadow government organization much like the Blackwood Project, but more interested in alien research than in resisting or countering the Mor-Taxan invasion plans.

A number of recurring allies are presented for the Blackwood team. Sylvia Van Buren (a character from the George Pal film reprised by the original actress, Ann Robinson), who was a colleague of Dr. Forrester, has since the end of the war developed the ability to sense the aliens and is prone to fairly accurate precognitive visions. The aliens’ scientific arsenal has little power over the supernatural powers of shaman Joseph Lonetree (whose presence is seemingly foreshadowed in the first episode). The team even makes friends with the remaining Grover&#x27;s Mill militia of 1938 who had their own run-in with the aliens.

A recurring element in the series is the number three. This is an extension of the film, wherein the aliens’ physiology, technology and society are rooted in multiples of three: from their caste system (ruling class, soldiers, and scientists) to their bodies (three arms with three fingers), weaponry (in “The Resurrection”, they make bolas with three weighted ends), and even their mating cycle is every nine years (three times three years). The appearance of the number in some form is sprinkled throughout the season in reference to the aliens.

The episodes all had (often ironic) Biblical titles, such as &quot;The Walls of Jericho&quot;, &quot;To Heal the Leper&quot;, and &quot;Among the Philistines&quot;.

“To Life Immortal” (&quot;too doe nakotae&quot; as it would be said in the aliens’ native tongue), a phrase by which the aliens seem to sum up their belief system, is a common exchange between aliens, as a pledge to their shared goal or as a battle cry before honorable self-sacrifice. It later became a popular catchphrase among the show&#x27;s fans.

=== Second season ===
Opening voice-over:

The creative team of Season 1 was replaced, bringing in Frank Mancuso, Jr., who was also busy producing &quot;Friday the 13th: The Series&quot;. Many aspects of the show were retooled, such as the title sequence and music, and much of the black humor and Biblical references were removed. Norton and Ironhorse, two major characters from the first season, are killed off in the season premiere and replaced by mercenary John Kincaid (Adrian Paul).

The modern-day setting of the first season shifted to a not-too-distant future of &quot;Almost Tomorrow&quot; in which the world has since spiraled into a dismal state with its economy, environment, and government all beaten down. The antagonists of the first season are replaced by the Morthren, from Mothrai; while the first season aliens were said to be from the planet Mor-Tax, there is a half-hearted explanation for this change in the final episode. The Morthren exterminate all the aliens from the first season for their failure to eradicate humanity.

Whereas bacteria and radiation are constant problems for the aliens in the first season, the Morthren have quickly found a cure-all means for this by transmutating into human bodies. With this, they forwent the ability to possess human bodies, retaining only one human body. These bodies are, however, easily damaged; as seen in the series a single bullet wound is enough to cause the aliens&#x27; human form to break down, killing them. Their equivalent of body-swapping is a cloning machine that makes exact copies of someone, the only difference being the duplicates loyalty to the Morthren cause. Their continued existence is also linked to the original person being kept alive by the aliens, as Ironhorse fatally proves in the first episode of the season. Ironically, as sores are the telltale signs of alien possession in the first season, a lack of scars or any physical flaw was a telltale sign of a clone, as the Morthren are fixated with perfection. While the Eternal is their god, the Morthren are led by Malzor (played by Denis Forest, who had a large part in the Season 1 episode “Vengeance Is Mine”). Just under him was the scientist Mana (Catherine Disher, whose husband also played a major role in a Season 1 episode) with Ardix (Julian Richings who appeared briefly in “He Feedeth Among the Lillies”) as her assistant.

Meanwhile, with General Wilson missing, the Cottage destroyed, and two team members lost in battle, the remnants of the team, with mercenary Kincaid, seek shelter. They take up base in an underground hideout in the sewers. Some of the characters experience shifts, such as Harrison carrying a gun, becoming more sullen and losing his more quirky personality traits. The friction between the militaristic Ironhorse and the other team members was not transferred with Kincaid, who got along well with everyone, who themselves became more militaristic in season 2. The show&#x27;s theme of warfare between two races, and all the issues that come with it, was replaced by a theme of a bleak life on a desolate world, but with possible hope for the future.

Although the series was canceled after 14 episodes had been broadcast, six more episodes were completed. This gave the production team the time and opportunity to create a finale, &quot;The Obelisk&quot;, which offers a conclusive ending to the series as a whole.

== Cast ==
=== Main cast ===
An eclectic group is formed by the government to deal with the new alien threat, and the series follows their missions and adventures (and often failures) in fighting the aliens. The Blackwood Project, named after its central member, consists of the following:

* Dr. Harrison Blackwood (Jared Martin): Astrophysicist whose parents were killed in the 1953 invasion. He was adopted following the events of the film by Dr. Clayton Forrester and Blackwood&#x27;s character is played very much to resemble Forrester down to his demeanor, dress, and even his speech and appearance. He is a pacifist and a vegetarian, and is often seen practicing many alternative health techniques such as yoga during the first season, but becomes grittier in the second.
* Dr. Suzanne McCullough (Lynda Mason Green): Microbiologist and single mother to Debi. She firmly embraces standard procedure in her work, which causes friction with Blackwood and his chaotic and eccentric work habits.
* Debi McCullough (Rachel Blanchard)
* Norton Drake (Philip Akin, season 1): A long-time friend of Harrison, he is a paraplegic computer genius who is granted mobility via a voice-activated wheelchair named Gertrude. He is often portrayed as being cool and laid back with a good sense of humor. In earlier episodes he had a pseudo-Caribbean accent; this was later dropped.
* Lt. Col. Paul Ironhorse (Richard Chaves, season 1): Military man. He is rather conservative and often clashes with the other members of the team, especially Blackwood who is his political and philosophical opposite.
* John Kincaid (Adrian Paul, season 2): Human resistance member
* Malzor (Denis Forest, season 2): Alien commander
* Mana (Catherine Disher, season 2): Alien scientist

=== Notable guest stars ===
The first season featured some recognisable actors in the series. Aside from getting Ann Robinson to reprise her role as Sylvia van Buren from the film, the series also obtained John Colicos (from &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;) as rogue alien Quinn who, while only appearing twice, was no doubt intended to play an integral part of the series as it went on (the character&#x27;s power-hungry nature and middleman status between two worlds is noticeably reminiscent of Colicos’ role as Lord Baltar). The list of notable guests begins in the show&#x27;s very start with John Vernon appearing in the first two episodes as General Wilson. Other guest stars throughout the series: Patrick Macnee, Greg Morris, Jeff Corey, John Ireland, Colm Feore, and James Hong.

The series was also the early working ground for future stars. Chris Potter made his acting debut in the second episode of season one. Singer Alannah Myles appears in the 20th episode of season one, which aired less than three weeks after the release of her platinum-certified eponymous debut album. Aside from exclusive season two star Adrian Paul (of &quot;Highlander&quot; fame), the second season also featured the first onscreen appearance of Mia Kirshner. The second season also gave more screentime to Rachel Blanchard, who only had minor play in the first season. Julian Richings also makes regular appearances as Ardix, an alien scientist working under Mana.

== Episodes ==
===Season 1 (1988–89)===

Note that three episodes (&quot;The Walls of Jericho&quot;, &quot;The Good Samaritan&quot;, and &quot;Epiphany&quot;) are credited to pseudonyms based on the original film characters Clayton Forrester and Sylvia van Buren. These were the first three regular episodes produced, during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, and the writers (possibly including series creator Greg Strangis) went uncredited to avoid being charged with strikebreaking.

===Season 2 (1989–90)===
== Releases ==
=== Novelization ===
A novelization of the pilot episode was written by J. M. Dillard. While following the same narrative structure of the episode, the book contains characters from the 1953 film and scenes not included in the final cut of the pilot; it also explores more deeply the aliens&#x27; political motivations, and emphasizes denial instead of the &quot;selective amnesia&quot; aspect of the plot.

=== Home media ===
On November 1, 2005, Paramount Home Media Distribution released season 1 on DVD in Region 1. The set&#x27;s release coincided with the DVD re-release of the 1953 film from which the show was spawned (the updated version from Steven Spielberg being released on DVD later the same month). A common criticism of the DVDs has been the poor image quality; fans in particular also point out the omission of the alien hand animation from the opening credits that had been inexplicably removed from every episode. The set contains no special features. It does, however, allow the viewer to jump to a chapter, which are divided by act, including the opening and closing credits, but are not available via any menu. It also includes closed captioning, but these may not be entirely reliable as there are several clear errors - for example, it is inconsistent in how it spells the name of the aliens&#x27; homeworld, neither of which is the canonical spelling. By contrast, however, in a few episodes, the captioning refers to the Advocates by the name of their original host bodies from the pilot episode (i.e. Chambers, Urick, and Einhorn), even in the absence of the original actors.

The second and final season was released on October 26, 2010, nearly five years after the release of the first season.

In Region 2, Revelation Films has released both seasons on DVD in the UK. Season 1 was released on April 30, 2012 and Season 2 was released on August 30, 2012.

On February 6, 2018, CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Media Distribution released seasons 1 and 2 as a single package entitled &quot;War of the Worlds: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD.

<doc id="893465" wikidata="Q1278022" url="?curid=893465" title="Shrooms (film)">
<text>Shrooms is a 2007 psychological horror film written by Pearse Elliot and directed by Paddy Breathnach. The film stars Lindsey Haun, Jack Huston, and Max Kasch. Its plot follows a group of American students and their English guide who are stalked by a serial killer while out in the woods looking for psilocybin mushrooms.

== Plot ==
American student Tara and her college friends visit Ireland to meet with local resident and friend Jake, and go camping in woodlands surrounding a long-disused children&#x27;s home. While collecting psilocybin mushrooms for later consumption, Tara eats a death bell mushroom (Galerina) and suffers a seizure after which she experiences dream-like trances in which she begins having premonitions of future events.

Around the evening camp fire, with Tara resting in her tent, Jake tells a ghost story of the empty children&#x27;s home nearby, and of a violent sadistic monk who survived an assault by one of his charges, as revenge for killing his twin brother. Overhearing this causes Tara to have premonitions of the murders of her friends.

After a deathly row with his girlfriend and the others, aggressive jock Bluto drinks some of the hallucinogenic tea (supposedly for all to share in the morning) and experiences a trip which culminates in his murder, seemingly at the hands of the rogue monk from the children&#x27;s home.

The following morning, unconcerned by Bluto&#x27;s disappearance – the others consume the mushroom tea, only to become separated from one another in the woods while under its effects. The three women, arguing and squabbling, get lost until they themselves are split, and Holly and Lisa are violently murdered – in accordance with Tara&#x27;s continuing visions – after an encounter with local woodsmen Ernie and Bernie.

Jake and Troy find Tara on the bank of a river, and tell her to meet them in the abandoned home to summon help. Upon investigating the property, Troy is apparently killed by the monk, and Jake escapes by jumping from a high window, breaking his leg as he lands. Tara finds him and the two flee the haunted scene. Then, while resting his leg, he is murdered.

Tara awakes as a Garda helicopter hovers over the camp, and is dispatched into an ambulance as the sole survivor. As her mobile phone rings, Tara experiences a rapid flashback and realizes that the death bell mushroom caused her to murder all of her friends. She asks the paramedic for help. Everything becomes quiet until it’s revealed that Tara, still under the influence of the death bell, has killed the paramedic. She flees into the woods after escaping.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
An Irish, Danish, and British co-production, &quot;Shrooms&quot; was shot over a period of seven weeks in April and May 2006 in locations including Gosford Park, County Armagh, Northern Ireland and Rossmore Forest Park in County Monaghan, Ireland.

== Reception ==
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, gave it a rating of 22% based on 18 reviews from critics. Derek Elly of &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;A shake-&#x27;n&#x27;-bake slasher movie that shows just how difficult it is to do effective, modestly budgeted horror&quot;. Séamus Leonard wrote in Raidió Teilifís Éireann&#x27;s review, &quot;The film definitely looks the part, but is hollow in virtually every other department.&quot; Leonard said the film may play better to non-Irish audiences, but viewers in Ireland will likely find it unintentionally funny. Writing for &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, Donald Clarke said the film has &quot;some elegant compositions&quot; but seems assembled from other recent horror films.

<text>The Canadian Translators, Terminologists and Interpreters Council (CTTIC) (or, in French, the &quot;Conseil des traducteurs, terminologues et interprètes du Canada&quot;) is a federation of provincial and territorial associations representing translators, terminologists and interpreters (collectively known as &quot;language professionals&quot;) in Canada.

Since professional organization is a matter of provincial and territorial jurisdiction in Canada, CTTIC admits only provincial and territorial bodies, called associations, orders, societies or corporations. The council&#x27;s total membership consists of the eleven member bodies which, in turn, represent their own members.
As a result, the CTTIC speaks for about 3,500 language professionals, some 2,500 of whom are certified.

The CTTIC is no longer affiliated with the International Federation of Translators (FIT).

==History==
The council was originally incorporated in 1956 as the Society of Translators and Interpreters of Canada (STIC), or, in French, the &quot;Société des traducteurs et interprètes du Canada&quot; (STIC). It changed its name, becoming CTIC (the Canadian Translators and Interpreters Council, or, in French the &quot;Conseil des traducteurs et interprètes du Canada&quot;) in 1970. The Association of Translators and Interpreters of Ontario (ATIO) and the Ordre des traducteurs, terminologues et interprètes agréés du Québec (OTTIAQ) (known, at that time, as the Société des traducteurs du Québec (STQ)), are the founding members of the council.

On June 11, 2012, OTTIAQ withdrew from CTTIC.

<doc id="893469" wikidata="Q144190" url="?curid=893469" title="PFC Levski Sofia">
<text>PFC Levski Sofia () is a Bulgarian professional association football club based in Sofia, which competes in the First League, the top division of the Bulgarian football league system. The club was founded on 24 May 1914 by a group of high school students, and is named after Vasil Levski, a Bulgarian revolutionary renowned as the national hero of the country.

Levski has won a total of 74 trophies, including 26 national championships, 26 national cups and 3 supercups, as well as 13 domestic doubles and one treble. It is the only Bulgarian football club to have never been relegated from the top division since the establishment of the league system in 1937. On the international stage, Levski reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup twice and the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup three times. In addition, the club has finished as runners-up of the Balkans Cup twice. In 2006, Levski became the first Bulgarian club to play in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League.

The team&#x27;s home kit colour is all-blue. Levski″s home ground is the Georgi Asparuhov Stadium in Sofia, which has a capacity of 18,000 spectators. The club&#x27;s fiercest rival is CSKA Sofia, and matches between the two capital sides are commonly referred to as the Eternal derby of Bulgaria. Levski also contests the Oldest capital derby with Slavia Sofia. The club is a regular member of the European Club Association and the European Multisport Club Association.

==History==

===1914–1969: Sports Club Levski===
Sports Club Levski was founded in 1911 by a group of students from the Second Male High School in Sofia. The club&#x27;s name was chosen in honour of the Bulgarian revolutionary Vasil Levski, and the club was officially registered on 24 May 1914.

In 1914, Levski lost its first official match against FK 13 Sofia with the score of 2–0. Between 1914 and 1920, football wasn&#x27;t a popular sport in Bulgaria, and no additional information about the club exists. In the summer of 1921, the Sofia Sports League was established, which united ten clubs from Sofia and marked the beginning of organized football competitions in the city. Levski won the first match in the championship in the 1921–22 season, held on 18 September 1921, against Atletik Sofia with the score of 3–1. The team finished first in the league in 1923 after a 3–2 win over bitter rivals Slavia Sofia, and successfully defended the title in the following two seasons, in 1924 and 1925.

The first National Championship was held in 1924 with Levski representing Sofia. The team went on to win the title in 1933, 1937 and 1942, and established itself as the most popular football club in Bulgaria. In 1929, Levski became the first semi-professional football club in Bulgaria, after twelve players staged a boycott of the team in demand of financial remuneration and insurance benefits. The same year Levski met its first international opponents, losing to Gallipoli Istanbul 1–0 and winning against Kuban Istanbul 6–0. Between 1930 and 1932, Levski won the Ulpia Serdica Cup for three consecutive years and was permanently awarded the trophy as a result.


After World War II, Levski became one of the two top clubs in Bulgaria. After winning the championship in 1946, 1947, 1949, 1950 and 1953, Levski would not capture the domestic title again until the mid-1960s. In 1949, the authorities changed the club&#x27;s name to Dinamo following the Soviet traditions, but after the de-Stalinization of Bulgaria, it was reverted in 1957. The 1960s were marked with return to success both on the domestic and on the international stage. Levski&#x27;s academy would become the most successful in national youth competitions for the years to come, and the results were first seen in the likes of Georgi Asparuhov, Georgi Sokolov, Biser Mihaylov, Kiril Ivkov, Ivan Vutsov, Stefan Aladzhov and Aleksandar Kostov, assisted by experienced veterans like Stefan Abadzhiev, Dimo Pechenikov and Hristo Iliev, which resulted in winning the championship in 1965, 1968 and 1970, including the 7–2 triumph over new bitter rivals CSKA Sofia in 1968. In the 1965–66 European Cup, Levski was eliminated in the first round by Benfica with 5–4 on aggregate.

===1969–1985: Levski-Spartak===
In January 1969, Levski was forcibly merged with Spartak Sofia by the Bulgarian Communist Party, and put under the auspice of the Ministry of Interior Affairs. The name of the club was once again changed, this time to Levski-Spartak.

A new crop of youngsters in the likes of Kiril Milanov, Dobromir Zhechev, Pavel Panov, Stefan Pavlov, Yordan Yordanov, Stefan Staykov, Tomas Lafchis, Todor Barzov, Voyn Voynov, Georgi Tsvetkov, Plamen Nikolov, and Rusi Gochev not only found their place in the first team, but brought new league titles in 1974, 1977, 1979, 1984 and 1985. On the international stage, the team reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1969–70 and 1976–77, and the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup in 1975–76. In the latter, Levski defeated Barcelona 5–4 in the second leg, becoming one of the two European teams (joined by Bayern Munich in 2020) to have scored five or more goals in one match against the Spanish giants in official UEFA competitions. Additionally, Levski became the only Bulgarian club to eliminate a German champion after defeating VfB Stuttgart in the first round of the 1984–85 European Cup. They also eliminated Stuttgart a year earlier in the first round of the 1983–84 UEFA Cup.

===1985–1989: Vitosha Sofia===
The name of the team was changed to Vitosha by the authorities following the disruptions during and after the Bulgarian Cup final in 1985. The game ran on high emotions fuelled by the streak of consecutive victories of Levski over CSKA in the two years prior to the game. During the game, which CSKA won 2–1, there were confrontations both on the field and on the stands. By decree of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, some of the leading players of both clubs were suspended from the sport for life. The championship title of the club for 1985 was suspended. However, the suspensions were lifted shortly after. Levski won another cup and league titles in 1986 and 1988, respectively. The fourth European quarter-final came in 1986–87, when Levski knocked out the 1985–86 Danish Cup winners Boldklubben 1903 and the 1985–86 Yugoslav Cup holders Velež Mostar, before losing to the 1985–86 Copa del Rey winners Real Zaragoza.

===1989–2009: Return of Levski Sofia and the &quot;Blue Tale&quot;===
After the 1989–90 season, the club regained its original name. The team was made up of players such as Plamen Nikolov, Petar Hubchev, Tsanko Tsvetanov, Emil Kremenliev, Zlatko Yankov, Georgi Slavchev, Ilian Iliev, Daniel Borimirov, Stanimir Stoilov, Velko Yotov, Plamen Getov, Nikolay Todorov and Nasko Sirakov, and won three consecutive domestic national championships in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Levski have contributed a record seven players to the Bulgaria national team that finished fourth at the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

In 2005–06, Levski reached the quarter-finals of the 2005–06 UEFA Cup after knocking out the 2004–05 Coupe de France winners Auxerre in the first round, finishing above SC Heerenveen, Dinamo București and the reigning title holders CSKA Moscow in the group stage, triumphing over Champions League participants Artmedia Bratislava and Udinese in the knockout stages, before being eliminated by Schalke 04.

Levski, as the champions of Bulgaria, started their 2006–07 UEFA Champions League participation in the second qualifying round, where they eliminated Georgian champions Sioni Bolnisi, defeating them 2–0 both home and away. In the third round, Levski faced the Italian team Chievo Verona, which took part in the tournament because of other clubs&#x27; sanctions as part of the 2006 Serie A matchfixing scandal. Levski eliminated Chievo after a decisive 2–0 win in Sofia and a 2–2 draw in Verona, and thus became the first Bulgarian club to ever reach the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. There, they faced the title holders Barcelona, Premier League champions Chelsea, and Bundesliga runners-up Werder Bremen. They lost all six games and scored only one goal, in the second round against Chelsea.

Levski&#x27;s UEFA Cup run and the consequent participation in the Champions League group stage were considered the club&#x27;s greatest European successes in the 21st century, hence the period of their occurrence (2005–2007) was informally called the &quot;Blue Tale&quot;.

Levski earned a place in the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League after the Bulgarian league champions CSKA Sofia failed to obtain a UEFA license. Levski lost to BATE Borisov of Belarus in the third qualifying round.

===2009–2020: Downfall===
During the 2009–10 season, Levski&#x27;s team started their European campaign with a 9–0 (on aggregate) win against UE Sant Julià in the second qualifying round of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League. In the next round, Levski Sofia faced FK Baku, eliminating the team from Azerbaijan with 2–0 on aggregate. In the play-off round, Levski was eliminated by Debrecen with 4–1 on aggregate. As one of the play-off losers, Levski qualified for the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League. In the group stage, Levski faced Villarreal, Lazio and Red Bull Salzburg. Levski achieved only one win and five defeats. Levski won against Lazio in Italy, after Hristo Yovov scored the winning goal in the match.

Levski started the 2010–11 season with a match against Dundalk, in a second qualifying round of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. Levski won the first match . In the return leg at Oriel Park, Levski defeated Dundalk 2–0 with two first half goals from Garra Dembélé. In the next round Levski played against Kalmar FF. The first match ended 1–1 in Sweden. In the return leg in Sofia, Levski won 5–2. In between, The Blues defeated their archrival CSKA Sofia in the Eternal derby with 1–0. Their next match in the Europa League saw them eliminate Swedish champions AIK 2–1 on aggregate, with goals scored by Daniel Mladenov and Garra Dembélé as Levski reached the Europa League group stage. Levski was drawn in Group C, facing Gent, Lille and Sporting CP. The first match was played against Gent at home, which Levski won 3–2 with the winning goal scored by Serginho Greene. With this win, Levski recorded eight consecutive games without a defeat in European competitions. After that, Levski lost to Sporting CP with 5–0, followed by another defeat against Lille. In Sofia, Levski played well against Lille and was leading 2–1 until Ivo Ivanov scored an own goal to make it 2–2. In the last match of the Group C, Levski took a win against Sporting CP with 1–0, with the winning goal scored by Daniel Mladenov.

In the following 2011–12 season, in the third qualifying round of the Europa League, Levski were eliminated by Spartak Trnava of Slovakia, following a late game 2–1 win in Sofia, and a loss of the same scoreline in Trnava. The penalty shoot-out costed Levski a place in the play-off round. This caused an upset with the fans and players, and the team barely clinched the fourth place at the winter break in the Bulgarian league. Albeit only three points from the leaders Ludogoretz Razgrad, the acting manager Georgi Ivanov was sacked from the position, but remained at the club as a sporting director. Nikolay Kostov was appointed the new manager of the club, giving the supporters a sense of optimism, which, however, faded after a cup knock-out in the hands of Lokomotiv Plovdiv and a home defeat to Minyor Pernik. Kostov handed in his resignation, leaving the managerial post once again vacant. Sporting director Georgi Ivanov once again stepped in to help the club, and accepted being the manager until the summer break, when a new one would be appointed.

During the summer of 2012, former player Ilian Iliev was appointed the new manager of the club. Under his management, Levski was knocked out from the Europa League by Bosnian side FK Sarajevo. Iliev led the team to 13 league victories and to the semi-finals of the Bulgarian Cup after eliminating Cherno More Varna and Litex Lovech on the away goals rule. Iliev however was sacked after a 1–1 away draw against Pirin Gotse Delchev. Assistant manager Nikolay Mitov took over the team until the end of the season. Under his management Levski won the derby clashes against Litex, CSKA and Ludogorets but failed to win the title after a 1–1 home draw against Slavia Sofia. Levski also reached their first Bulgarian Cup final since 2007, but lost on penalties against Beroe Stara Zagora. Despite the missed opportunity of winning a trophy, Mitov&#x27;s contract was renewed for the 2013–14 season. However, the team made another disappointing performance in Europa League, being eliminated by the Kazakh side Irtysh Pavlodar. As a result, Nikolay Mitov resigned as manager.

In July 2013, Slaviša Jokanović was appointed as the new manager of the team. Despite losing only two matches in twelve games, Jokanović was released in October 2013. Ivaylo Petev was announced as his successor but during his introduction a few Levski supporters interrupted it, stating that they would not accept his appointment. The next day, Petev refused to take charge of the team and Antoni Zdravkov was named as the new manager. Under his reign the team suffered a heavy 3–0 loss against rivals CSKA, but managed to knock them out in the Bulgarian Cup in December 2013 after penalties. Due to the difficult financial situation, a few key players, such as Antonio Vutov and Garry Rodrigues, were sold to Udinese and Elche, respectively, during the winter break. This reflected on the team&#x27;s performance and Levski finished fifth and got knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Bulgarian Cup by Botev Plovdiv. Antoni Zdravkov was sacked in March 2014, and Levski legend Elin Topuzakov took charge as a caretaker until the end of the 2013–14 season. The club did not participate in European competitions for the first time since 1990–91.

On 23 May 2014, the club supporters organized a friendly game against Lazio, marking the 100th anniversary of the club. Club icons like Georgi Ivanov, Dimitar Ivankov, Aleksandar Aleksandrov, Hristo Yovov, Elin Topuzakov and many other former players and celebrities took participation by playing in the game, as well as donating money for the event&#x27;s organization. The next day, Levski marked 100 years since its founding. 

The following years were arguably the darkest in the club&#x27;s history. League-wise, Levski managed to finish higher than third place only once (runners-up in 2015–16), and achieved its lowest ever ranking (seventh place in 2014–15, followed by eighth in 2020–21). On the stage of the Bulgarian Cup, the club lost two more finals, in 2015 to Cherno More and in 2018 to Slavia Sofia. In European competitions, Levski faced some of its most unexpected eliminations – against Liechtenstein side FC Vaduz and Cypriot AEK Larnaca, the latter inflicting the largest ever European defeat on aggregate for Levski .

These years were turbulent not only on the football pitch, but at the higher hierarchy of the club. In June 2015, the long-time president Todor Batkov stepped down and the club was taken over by Ivo Tonev, Aleksandar Angelov and Nikolay Ivanov. From this point onwards, Levski began to experience financial problems. Tonev, Angelov and Ivanov&#x27;s reign was short-lived and in August 2016, they transferred their shares to businessman Spas Rusev. Under his governance, Levski signed players like Gabriel Obertan and Jordi Gómez, as well as coach Delio Rossi, in an attempt to return the club&#x27;s glory. However, Rusev&#x27;s financing was dubious, and there were complaints for delayed wages. In February 2017, Rusev admitted the club was &quot;practically bankrupt&quot;. On 9 February 2019, Rusev stepped down as owner of Levski, leaving the club with more than 30 million BGN in debt. Four days later, businessman and former owner of archrivals CSKA Vasil Bozhkov took over the club. He attempted to stabilize Levski&#x27;s financial situation by immediately covering the most urgent obligations and selling or releasing the players with the highest wages, investing around 25 million BGN in total throughout his tenure. In February 2020, Bozhkov stepped down as his main business, 7777.bg (National Lottery), had its license withdrawn by the Bulgarian government. The club being left with no financing whatsoever and in a full-scale financial crisis, sparkled an unprecedented support campaign amongst the fans, who engaged in various donation initiatives, raising 2.6 million BGN in the span of five months.

In 2021, former owner Vasil Bozhkov admitted that he was forced to take over Levski under the threat of business closure by prime minister Boyko Borisov. Bozhkov&#x27;s confession was somewhat of a confirmation of the insinuation that the reason behind Levski&#x27;s financial problems and occasional ownership changes was Borisov&#x27;s idea of using the club as an instrument for political influence.

===2020–present: Return of Sirakov and Stoilov===

In the summer of 2020, club legend Nasko Sirakov took charge of the majority of shares and the club made some financial cuts, forcing a big part of the players (mainly foreigners) to leave. Levski also changed its transfer policy, signing mainly Bulgarian and homegrown players with lower salaries, allowing the club to start paying off some of the debt accumulated throughout the years. Sirakov set a target for the club to clear most of the debt by 2023, mostly through sponsorship deals, outgoing transfers, television rights and the fans&#x27; financial support.

On 1 September 2021, Sirakov announced the return of the club&#x27;s most successful manager in the 21st century, also known as the &quot;author&quot; of the &quot;Blue Tale&quot;, Stanimir Stoilov. At that time, Levski was in 10th place in the league standings with four defeats and two wins in the first six games. With his arrival, Stoilov released three players – Simeon Slavchev, Valeri Bojinov and Hristofor Hubchev, and signed José Córdoba from Etar and Dimitar Kostadinov from Septemvri Sofia. Under his management, the team managed to improve promptly, earning 20 points by the end of the half-season with 5 wins, 5 draws, and 3 defeats. 

On 15 May 2022, Levski won the Bulgarian Cup by defeating its biggest rivals CSKA 1–0 in the final, thus ending the club&#x27;s longest ever trophyless period (13 years). It was a record 26th cup for the Blues. By winning the cup, the team earned a place in the UEFA Europa Conference League qualifications. In the second qualifying round, they faced PAOK, who reached the quarter-finals of the same competition the previous season. Despite being considered underdogs, Levski managed to eliminate the Greek team 3–1 on aggregate. However, Levski crashed out of the tournament in the third qualifying round after an upsetting home defeat on penalties at the hands of Maltese side Ħamrun Spartans.

===Names and crests===
The first club crest was designed by Mircho Kachulev in 1922. Initially in the size of a square with a blue background, it was intentionally written in a stylized letter &quot;Л&quot; (Bulgarian letter &quot;L&quot;; shortened for Levski). The inner space of the letter was filled vertically equally in yellow and red colours. In a later period of time, the Cyrillic letters &quot;С&quot; (Sport) and &quot;К&quot; (club) were added at the top of the square, while the bottom side was inscribed with the name &quot;Sofia&quot;. This badge was used by the club until 1949, when it was renamed to Dinamo.

From 1949 to 1956, the emblem of the club was an irregular hexagon filled with vertical red, white, blue and yellow colours, with an inscribed handwritten Cyrillic letter &quot;Д&quot;, alongside a five-pointed red star above it and the word &quot;Sofia&quot; underneath.
From 1957 to 1968 the original logo of the club was restored, however the letters C&quot; and &quot;К&quot; were replaced with &quot;Ф&quot; (Athletic) and &quot;Д&quot; (union).

After the merger with Spartak Sofia in 1969, the club crest has been a shield in blue and white with a horizontal red bar above. The shield spawned the letters &quot;Л&quot; and &quot;C&quot;, an abbreviation of the new name Levski-Spartak. The football club used this crest until 1985, when it was renamed Vitosha. Vitosha&#x27;s crest was in the form of a stylized letter &quot;C&quot; surrounding the football in the upper curve of the letter, coloured in blue and white.

In January 1990, the club restored its original name and original logo, and the letters &quot;C&quot; and &quot;K&quot; in the upper corner of the blue square were replaced with the initials &quot;Ф&quot; (football) and &quot;K&quot; (club). However, due to legal issues with the ownership of the rights to the historic crest, the club was forced to change it in 1998, when a brand new shield logo was introduced, entirely in blue. At its centre, an inscription of the letter &quot;Л&quot; was introduced, alongside the year of establishment – 1914. The dome of the shield was labelled &quot;PFC Levski&quot;.

After winning the legal dispute for the rights to the historic emblem in 2006, the club decided to use the two different crests simultaneously for a brief period of time. Later that year, the shield crest was replaced by the classic square emblem.

The Cyrillic letter &quot;Л&quot; (L) is used today as the club&#x27;s kit crest and on its social media channels.

The first anthem of Levski was written by renowned Bulgarian poet Dimcho Debelyanov and composed by Lyubomir Pipkov. Since 1999, the club anthem is &quot;Само Левски шампион&quot; (&quot;Only Levski, the champion&quot;), composed by Stefan Dimitrov.

==Stadium==

Initially, the club did not possess a field of its own and training was held on an empty space called &quot;The Hillock&quot; (&quot;Могилката/Mogilkata&quot;), where the National Palace of Culture was built later. In 1924, the Sofia Municipality provided the club with the rights to an empty field on what were then the outskirts of the city, and a decade later the stadium named Levski Field was finally completed. It provided for 10,000 spectators and was regarded as the finest sport facility in the city.

In 1949, the stadium was nationalized and later the Vasil Levski National Stadium was built on the site. The team played in various locations (including the nearby Yunak Stadium) before moving to the Dinamo ground, which was located at the site of the modern Spartak swimming complex. In 1961, after districting, the team moved to Suhata Reka neighborhood, where a new stadium was built by 1963, which was later renamed in 1990 in honour of former Levski player Georgi Asparuhov.

In 1999, the stadium underwent extensive reconstruction with a capacity of 29,000 spectators. The field measures 105 x 68 metres. However, the team plays most of its important international matches on the national stadium Vasil Levski. On one occasion, the former club president Todor Batkov had demanded that Levski should receive Stadion Rakovski on loan. The demand was on grounds that the first club stadium was nationalized and Levski had never been repaid.

In October 2012, it was announced that Levski would be renovating their stadium. The first phase of the planned reconstruction was to be completed in 2014, on the centennial of the club&#x27;s foundation. As of 2013, the capacity was reduced to 19,000 due to the undergoing reconstruction of the main stand. On 5 July 2013, the first step was made in the construction of the main stand, which has a capacity of 6,000 spectators and meets all the requirements of UEFA for the convenience of fans. The stadium&#x27;s main stand was officially opened on 23 April 2016 at a special ceremony. Since 2019, the Museum of Glory of Levski Sofia is also located at the stadium.

==Supporters==
Historically, Levski Sofia fans gathered in the south stand of the stadium. This tradition is believed to have its roots in the Sofia Derby when Levski fans met before the games at the area close to the south end of the Vasil Levski National Stadium. Due to the orientation of the stadium and the naming conventions of stands at most Bulgarian stadiums, Sector B became synonymous with Levski fans. More recently the fans in Sector B are seen as part of the ultras movement popular in the Balkans. Today Sector B initiates most of the songs, choreography and pyrotechnic displays at Levski games.
Levski supporters are organized by fanclubs, most notably the National Supporters Club which helps and coordinates fans from all around Bulgaria and supports the organization of events. There are also notable groups from Sofia (Sofia-West, South Division, Blue Junta, HD Boys, LSL and more) and other cities across Bulgaria and globally (such as Ultra Varna, Blue Huns Pernik, OCB Veliko Tarnovo, Torcida Kyustendil, Ultras Vidin, Iron Pazardzhik, Youth Brigade 034 Pazardzik, Blue Boys Blagoevgrad, Blue Lads Sliven, Vandals Pleven, Levski Club Dobrich, Ultras Radomir, Ultras Burgas, Levski 1914 Karlovo, Yambol Boys, Levski UK, Levski Chicago, Levski Berlin and more). Ultras Levski have a long-standing friendship with Lazio fans. According to a study performed for UEFA, Levski is the most popular Bulgarian club and share the sixth position in Europe with Juventus, by percentage of support in its own country (31%).

<doc id="893470" wikidata="Q162027" url="?curid=893470" title="International Federation of Translators">
<text>The Fédération Internationale des Traducteurs (English: International Federation of Translators) is an international federation of associations of translators, interpreters and terminologists working in areas as diverse as literary, scientific and technical, public service, court and legal settings, conference interpreting, media and diplomatic fields and academia.

FIT supports members and the profession at an international level, building community, visibility and a sustainable future for the profession. 
With more than 100 professional associations affiliated, FIT represents over 80,000 translators in 65 countries. The goal of the Federation is to promote professionalism in the disciplines which it represents. The organisation aims to improve conditions for the profession in all countries and to uphold translators&#x27; rights and freedom of expression.

FIT has consultative status with UNESCO, The United Nations and has close relationships with other UN organs such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation.

==International Translation Day==

International Translation Day, also known as &#x27;ITD&#x27;, has been an important date celebrated in the FIT calendar for over 35 years. Each year FIT Council selects an annual theme as the basis for the celebrations.

Since 2017, 30 September has been internationally recognised as International Translation Day, an official UN International Day to be celebrated across the entire UN global network. It honours the contribution of professional translators, interpreters and terminologists in connecting nations, and fostering peace and global development and emphasises translation’s important political and cultural role in multilateralism and multilingualism.

&quot;Theme for 2024&quot;

The theme of ITD 2024 is “&quot;Translation, an art worth protecting&quot;”. This theme calls for the translation community to protect translation as an art, to protect copyright and related rights, and to protect professional livelihoods, thereby ensuring the future and sustainability of our profession.

==Committees==
The Federation, through its Standing Committees and Regional Centre Committees, undertakes projects to meet the various expectations of its members by addressing matters of training, professional standing and support for the community of translators, interpreters and terminologists.

==Governing bodies==
The Federation&#x27;s supreme body is the Statutory Congress, which is held every three years. It brings together delegations from FIT member associations and elects the FIT Council, which oversees FIT activity until the next statutory congress.

The governing bodies are supported by the various standing committees, which report to the council annually about their activities, and to the congress.

==FIT Events==

&quot;The FIT World Congress and Statutory Congress&quot;

Every three years, FIT invites all stakeholders in the community to its Congresses. The FIT Statutory Congress runs for two days and is attended by representatives of member associations who wish to nominate and attend. The statutory congress is followed by a three-day open congress, which serves as a platform for exchanges among all stakeholders in the profession, with keynote speeches, presentations and round table discussions.

==Publications and public relations==
The academic journal &quot;BABEL&quot; and the &quot;Translatio&quot; newsletter are the Federation&#x27;s quarterly publications, and are disseminated. Translatio informs FIT members about community activities and those of the FIT committees and events. The proceedings of each congress are also published, and serve as a further source of valuable information to those interested in the many facets of the translation profession.

In addition, between its congresses, FIT participates in the organization of webinars, seminars, colloquia and panel discussions on various aspects of the profession. FIT also supports its members&#x27; activities. The annual Council meetings are hosted by a FIT member association, to allow members to interact with FIT Council and to enable FIT to engage with the individual members of the profession in those countries.

==Secretariat==
FIT administration is assisted by a part-time secretariat.

<doc id="893472" wikidata="Q1478558" url="?curid=893472" title="Standing Stones of Stenness">
<text>The Standing Stones of Stenness are a Neolithic monument five miles northeast of Stromness on the mainland of Orkney, Scotland. This may be the oldest henge site in the British Isles. Various traditions associated with the stones survived into the modern era and they form part of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site. They are cared for by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.

==Layout and location==

The surviving stones are sited on a promontory at the south bank of the stream that joins the southern ends of the sea loch Loch of Stenness and the freshwater Loch of Harray. The name, which is pronounced &quot;stane-is&quot; in Orcadian dialect, comes from Old Norse meaning &quot;stone headland&quot;. The stream is now bridged, but at one time was crossed by a stepping stone causeway, and the Ring of Brodgar lies about away to the north-west, across the stream and near the tip of the isthmus formed between the two lochs. Maeshowe chambered cairn is about to the east of the Standing Stones of Stenness and several other Neolithic monuments also lie in the vicinity, suggesting that this area had particular importance.
Although the site today lacks the encircling ditch and bank, excavation has shown this site was a henge monument, possibly the oldest in the British Isles. The stones are thin slabs, approximately thick with sharply angled tops. Four, up to about high, were originally elements of a stone circle of up to 12 stones, laid out in an ellipse about diameter on a levelled platform of diameter surrounded by a ditch. The ditch is cut into rock by as much as and is wide, surrounded by an earth bank, with a single entrance causeway on the north side. The entrance faces towards the Neolithic Barnhouse Settlement which has been found adjacent to the Loch of Harray.
The Watch Stone stands outside the circle to the north-west and is high. Once there were at least two stones there, as in the 1930s the stump of a second stone was found. Other smaller stones include a square stone setting in the centre of the circle platform where cremated bone, charcoal and pottery were found. This is referred to as a &quot;hearth&quot;, similar to the one found at Barnhouse. Animal bones were found in the ditch. The pottery links the monument to Skara Brae and Maeshowe. Based on radiocarbon dating, it is thought that work on the site had begun by 3100 BCE.

==Traditions and history==


Even in the 18th century the site was still associated with traditions and rituals, by then relating to Norse gods. It was visited by Walter Scott in 1814. Other antiquarians documented the stones and recorded local traditions and beliefs about them. One stone, known as the &quot;Odin Stone&quot; which stood in the field to the north of the henge, was pierced with a circular hole, and was used by local couples for plighting engagements by holding hands through the gap. It was also associated with other ceremonies and believed to have magical power.

There was a reported tradition of making all kinds of oaths or promises with one&#x27;s hand in the Odin Stone; this was known as taking the &quot;Vow of Odin&quot;.

In December 1814 Captain W. Mackay, a recent immigrant to Orkney who owned farmland in the vicinity of the stones, decided to remove them on the grounds that local people were trespassing and disturbing his land by using the stones in rituals. He started in December 1814 by smashing the Odin Stone. This caused outrage and he was stopped after destroying another stone and toppling a third.

The toppled stone was re-erected in 1906 along with some inaccurate reconstruction inside the circle.

In the 1970s, a dolmen structure was toppled, since there were doubts as to its authenticity. The two upright stones remain in place.

==Influence on popular culture==
* A picture of the Stones of Stenness features on the cover of Van Morrison&#x27;s album &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;.
* The Odin stone is depicted on Julian Cope&#x27;s album &quot;Discover Odin&quot;.
* The stones are also the setting for the Loreena McKennitt song &quot;Standing Stones&quot; from her album &quot;Parallel Dreams&quot;. The lyrics describe a pair of star-crossed lovers who meet at the Odin stone, only for the man to meet a tragic fate.

==World Heritage status==
The Heart of Neolithic Orkney was inscribed as a World Heritage site in December 1999. In addition to the Standing Stones of Stenness, the site includes Maeshowe, Skara Brae, the Ring of Brodgar and other nearby sites. It is managed by Historic Environment Scotland, whose &#x27;Statement of Significance&#x27; for the site begins:

The monuments at the heart of Neolithic Orkney and Skara Brae proclaim the triumphs of the human spirit in early ages and isolated places. They were approximately contemporary with the mastabas of the archaic period of Egypt (first and second dynasties), the brick temples of Sumeria, and the first cities of the Harappa culture in India, and a century or two earlier than the Golden Age of China. Unusually fine for their early date, and with a remarkably rich survival of evidence, these sites stand as a visible symbol of the achievements of early peoples away from the traditional centres of civilisation...Stenness is a unique and early expression of the ritual customs of the people who buried their dead in tombs like Maes Howe and lived in settlements like Skara Brae.

<text>Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) is a monthly American video game magazine. It offers video game news, coverage of industry events, interviews with gaming figures, editorial content and product reviews.

==History==
The magazine was founded in 1988 as U.S. National Video Game Team&#x27;s &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; under Sendai Publications. In 1994, &quot;EGM&quot; spun off &quot;EGM²&quot;, which focused on expanded cheats and tricks (i.e., with maps and guides). It eventually became &quot;Expert Gamer&quot; and finally the defunct &quot;GameNOW&quot;. After 83 issues (up to June 1996), &quot;EGM&quot; switched publishers from Sendai Publishing to Ziff Davis. Until January 2009, &quot;EGM&quot; only covered gaming on console hardware and software.

In 2002, the magazine&#x27;s subscription increased by more than 25 percent.

The magazine was discontinued by Ziff Davis in January 2009, following the sale of &quot;1UP.com&quot; to UGO Networks. The magazine&#x27;s February 2009 issue was already completed, but was not published.

In May 2009, &quot;EGM&quot; founder Steve Harris purchased the magazine and its assets from Ziff Davis. The magazine was relaunched in April 2010 by Harris&#x27;s new company EGM Media, LLC, widening its coverage to the PC and mobile gaming markets.

Notable contributors to &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; have included Martin Alessi, Ken Williams (as Sushi-X), Jim Allee, &quot;Trickman&quot; Terry Minnich, Andrew &quot;Cyber-Boy&quot; Baran, Danyon Carpenter, Marc Camron (later Director of Operations), Mark &quot;Candyman&quot; LeFebvre, Todd Rogers, Mike Weigand A.K.A. Major Mike (now Managing Editor at GamePro Magazine), Al Manuel, Howard Grossman, Arcade Editor Mark &quot;Mo&quot; Hain, Mike &quot;Virus&quot; Vallas, Jason Streetz, Tim Davis, Ken Badziak, Scott Augustyn, Chris Johnston, Che Chou, Dave Ruchala, Crispin Boyer, Greg Sewart, Jeanne Trais, Jennifer Tsao, artist Jeremy Norm Scott, Game Scholar Leonard Herman, Shawn &quot;Shawnimal&quot; Smith, West Coast Editor Kelly Rickards, Kraig Kujawa, Dean Hager, Jeremy Parish and Mark Macdonald (who later went on to become director of Gamevideos.com before leaving Ziff-Davis). Writers who also served stints as editor-in chief include Ed Semrad, Joe Funk, John Davison, James Mielke, artist Jeremy &quot;Norm&quot; Scott, Dan &quot;Shoe&quot; Hsu and Seanbaby. In addition, writers of &quot;EGM&quot;″s various sister publications – including &quot;GameNow&quot;, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;/&quot;Games for Windows: The Official Magazine&quot;, &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; – would regularly contribute to &quot;EGM&quot; and vice versa.

The magazine is known for making April Fools jokes. Its April 1992 issue was the source of the Sheng Long hoax in &quot;Street Fighter II: The World Warrior&quot;.

=== Web-only relaunch (2019–present) ===

In March 2019, &quot;EGM&quot; announced that it was going to relaunch &quot;later this year&quot; into an outfit that will have &quot;a new look and a focus on long-form features, original reporting, and intelligent critique.&quot; It enters under the backronym &quot;Enjoy Games More&quot;.

In a letter in April 2020, editor Josh Harmon announced that the site would no longer publish long-form articles, prompting speculation that the publication had shut down. Harmon edited the announcement shortly afterwards to confirm that the site would continue &quot;some form of daily news coverage&quot;.

In October 2024, &quot;EGM&quot; launched a Kickstarter campaign for a retrospective book about the history of the magazine, titled &quot;The Electronic Gaming Monthly Compendium&quot;. The campaign reached its fundraising goal of $35,000 within less than 24 hours of its launch.

=== Game of the Year ===
== Magazine structure ==


The magazine includes the following sections:

* Insert Coin
** Letter from the editor – the editorial
** Login – Letters from readers and replies by the magazine
* Press Start
** This section contains a general article about video gaming
** EGM RoundTable – discussions around video games
** The Buzz – industry rumors
** The EGM Hot List – background information about a critically acclaimed game
* Features – feature articles
** The EGM Interview – interview with a person from the gaming industry
** Cover Story – preview of the game featured on the magazine cover
** Next Wave – previews of upcoming games
** Launch Point – short previews of upcoming games
* Review Crew – review section
** Review Recap – recapitulation of the review scores from the preceding issue
* Game Over – Commentary articles on video gaming related topics

=== The Review Crew===

&quot;EGM&quot;&#x27;s current review scale is based on a letter grade system in which each game receives a grade based on its perceived quality. Games are reviewed by one member (originally a team of four until the year 2000, then a team of three, and finally knocked down to one in 2008), except for &quot;the big games&quot;, which were reviewed by one of a pool of editors known as &quot;The Review Crew.&quot; They each assign a grade to the game and write a few paragraphs about their opinion of the game. The magazine makes a strong stance that a grade of C is average. Towards the top of the scale, awards are given to games that average a B− or higher from the three individual grade: &quot;Silver&quot; awards for games averaging a grade of B− to B+; &quot;Gold&quot; awards for games averaging a grade of A− or A; and &quot;Platinum&quot; awards for games with three A+ grades. The current letter grade system replaced a long-standing 0–10 scale in the April 2008 issue. In that system, Silver went to a game with an average rating from 8 to 9, Gold to a game reviewed at 9 to 10 and Platinum to a game that received nothing but 10 ratings. Until 1998, as a matter of editorial policy, the reviewers rarely gave scores of 10 and never gave a Platinum Award. That policy changed when the reviewers gave &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; four 10 ratings in 1998, with an editorial published half a year before announcing the shift.

In addition, they gave the game (or multiple games in the event of a tie, as with &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; for Xbox and &quot;NCAA Football 2006&quot;) with the highest average score for that issue a &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award. If a &quot;Game of the Month&quot; title receives a port to another console, that version is disqualified from that month&#x27;s award, such as with &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, which won the award for the Nintendo GameCube version and subsequently received the highest scores for the PlayStation 2 port months later and &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot;, which won the Platinum award for two separate versions of the game.

In 2002, &quot;EGM&quot; began giving games that earned unanimously bad scores a &quot;Shame of the Month&quot; award. As there is not always such a game in each issue, this award is only given out when a game qualifies.

Originally, a team of four editors reviewed all the games. This process was eventually dropped in favor of a system that added more reviewers to the staff so that no one person reviewed all the games for the month.

Though the scores ranged from 0–10 on the previous numerical scale, the score of zero was almost never utilized, with exceptions being &quot;Mortal Kombat Advance&quot;, &quot;The Guy Game&quot; and &quot;Ping Pals&quot;.

At the very end of every single magazine made during the Hsu period there is a funny/random message after the absolute last text (copyright/disclaimer text) on the last page.

==International expansion==

&quot;EGM en Español&quot; was released in Mexico in November 2002. It was published by Editorial Televisa and is edited by a different staff. Sometimes the content was more focused to the Latin American gaming crowd (e.g. soccer games were paid more attention than NASCAR or American football games), as well as the humor and other features. Sometimes it featured jokes among the Mexican community and sometimes supported the production with a poster. Adrián Carbajal “Carqui”, with a long experience in Mexican gaming magazines (prior to &quot;EGM en Español&quot;, he worked in now competitor publications &quot;Club Nintendo&quot; and &quot;Atomix&quot;), was the editor-in-chief through the entire run. There was a weekly official podcast called &quot;Playtime!&quot; hosted by most of the editorial staff. &quot;EGM en Español&quot; has been cancelled as of December 2008 due to Ziff Davis Media&#x27;s economical problems.

&quot;EGM Italia&quot; was published in Italy by Edizioni Star Comics S.r.l. from 2001 to 2003.
&quot;EGM&quot; was also published in Brazil as &quot;EGM Brasil&quot; by Conrad Editora since April 2002. Since the last quarter of 2005, &quot;EGM Brasil&quot; was being published by Futuro Comunicação. With the suspension of U.S. sales of the EGM, the Brazilian EGM was rebranded to EGW (Entertainment + Game World).

In 2006 three other editions of &quot;EGM&quot; were published around the world. &quot;EGM Thailand&quot; is published by Future Gamer Company Ltd., &quot;EGM Singapore&quot; is published by MediaCorp Publishing and &quot;EGM Turkey&quot; is published by Merkez Dergi.

&quot;EGM Turkey&quot; got closed in January 2009 for financial crisis.

==Internet presence==
In 1995, &quot;EGM&quot;″s first online website was nuke.com. It merged with GameSpot in 1996 after Ziff-Davis purchased Sendai Media Group. In 2003, &quot;EGM&quot; created a new website, &quot;1UP.com&quot;, after GameSpot was sold to CNET Networks. Since the magazine&#x27;s relaunch in 2010, the affiliated website has been egmnow.com.

&quot;EGM Live*&quot; was a podcast hosted every Monday by the editors of &quot;EGM&quot; on 1UP.com. The podcast was available for download at 1UP.com or the iTunes music store. Much like other podcasts on the 1UP network, the program could include discussion of various message board topics, an analysis of new games being reviewed, a mailbag section, a deeper look into the most recent issue of the magazine, or interviews with special guests such as Marcus Henderson and Ted Lange from Harmonix and Cliff Bleszinski from Epic Games. The &quot;*&quot; at the end of the name was to denote that the podcast was not actually &quot;live&quot; in the general media sense. It was later replaced by 1UPFM, another weekly Monday podcast where 1UP crew members Nick Suttner and Phil Kollar hosted the show, along with other 1UP members.

==&quot;EGM2&quot;==

EGM2 (stylized as EGM2) was a video game magazine published by Sendai Publishing from July 1994 to July 1998 as a spin-off of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. Unlike &quot;EGM&quot;, however, &quot;EGM2&quot; lacked a reviews section and had a greater emphasis on import games.

Starting in August 1998, &quot;EGM2&quot; became &quot;Expert Gamer&quot; (often abbreviated as &quot;XG&quot;). Although with a different name, &quot;XG&quot; continued &quot;EGM2&quot;″s numbering system. &quot;XG&quot; lasted for 39 issues until October 2001 (with the last issue being &quot;XG&quot; #88).

===History===

The first issue of &quot;EGM2&quot; was in July 1994. The magazine lasted 49 issues with the last issue under the original name coming out in July 1998. The change of name prompted a cleaner looking redesign although the content of the magazine would remain the same.

==Reception==
In a 2014 retrospective, &quot;Polygon&quot; said: &quot;For two decades, &quot;EGM&quot; maintained a focal position in the games media landscape. In the time before the internet, the periodical was a vital conduit for American readers interested in the hobby.&quot;

<doc id="893485" wikidata="Q6647634" url="?curid=893485" title="Literary Translators' Association of Canada">
<text>The Literary Translators&#x27; Association of Canada (LTAC) (or, in French, &quot;Association des traducteurs et traductrices littéraires du Canada&quot; (ATTLC)) is an association of literary translators from across Canada.

The Literary Translators&#x27; Association of Canada is affiliated with the International Federation of Translators (FIT).

==History==
The Literary Translators&#x27; Association of Canada was founded in 1975 and now has approximately 120 members, mainly translating literary works originally written in French or English, although many work in other languages.

Among the LTAC&#x27;s achievements has been obtaining codified recognition of translations as literary works in the Canadian Copyright Act, and a 50% share of public lending right payments for translators.
The Association&#x27;s activities focus primarily on serving its members and on raising public awareness of quality in translation. To this end the LTAC sponsors the John Glassco Translation Prize, an annual award with a $1000 purse for a first book-length translation into French or English from any language.

<doc id="893488" wikidata="Q16950620" url="?curid=893488" title="Marching Owl Band">
<text>The Marching Owl Band (aka The MOB or the Blues Band of South Main) is the Rice University &quot;marching band&quot; in the sense that it is the official ensemble that performs during football games, some basketball games, parades, and other public events. There are over 100 members. However, the MOB is not a traditional marching band, but rather a scatter band; members do not march, and some members play non-standard instruments (or no instrument at all). For example, in recent seasons these instruments included violins, violas, a cello, electric guitar, electric bass, electric piano, and even a harp. Extras known as Show Assistants are also a perennial inclusion in the MOB; these students play no instruments besides the kazoo (or an occasional didgeridoo), but are responsible for constructing and employing props in the halftime shows and acting out any mime or gag bits during performances. Rather than wear traditional marching band attire, The MOB instead dons pinstriped three-piece suits, ties, sunglasses, fedoras, and (in the case of Show Assistants) tommy gun props. (This attire is an obvious nod to the band&#x27;s acronym, though in practice falls somewhere between the style of Capone-era mobsters and The Blues Brothers.) The group is known for satirical football halftime shows which, as MOB director Chuck Throckmorton says, poke fun at rival universities&#x27; sacred cows.

The MOB plays primarily classic rock-and-roll pieces, though blues, swing, funk, classical, and other styles are featured on various occasions. Its signature song is a rendition of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, a hit from the 1960s originally performed by the Kingsmen. Other staples include &quot;Bonnet&quot; (adapted from &quot;Put on Your Old Grey Bonnet&quot;, 1909), the Rice University Fight Song (played after every Rice touchdown at football games), and &quot;Turning it Loose&quot; (a variation of the Otis Redding and Steve Cropper blues hit &quot;I Can&#x27;t Turn You Loose&quot; similar to the one used as The Blues Brothers&#x27; theme song).

==History==

===Formation and early years===
Formed in 1916, the Rice Owl Band consisted of twelve enterprising students from all colleges of the university. In 1922, under the leadership of Mr. Lee Chatham, the band grew from thirty-five to about fifty pieces. Rehearsals were held in Autry House, across Main Street from campus. During this period, however, there were few high school bands, so civic and municipal bands and private teachers supplied the main body of membership.

Mr. Kit Reid stepped up as director following Mr. Chatham&#x27;s retirement in 1938.

During the period of World War II, manpower shortages that plagued other areas also hit the band, prompting Hugh Saye and Dick Kincheloe to form a band under the V-12 program consisting of Navy cadets supplemented by civilians from the student body.

After the war, the band was reorganized, and the first women, four majorettes, joined the previously all-male organization. Neel Cotten completed the academic year as director following Mr. Reid&#x27;s retirement in 1950. In 1951, Holmes McNeely became director and instituted a building program of both equipment and personnel. Mr. McNeely was the first to offer a number of band scholarships to students involved with the Rice Owl Band. At this time, women musicians were added to the general Rice band for the first time.

Upon the retirement of Mr. McNeely in 1967, Mr. Bert Roth took charge of band activities. In the fall of 1968, he gave a work scholarship to every qualified member of the Rice Owl Band in recognition of their participation. The Rice Owl Band broke with tradition in 1970 and began to introduce timely and sometimes controversial topics into their halftime activities. With their tongues firmly planted in their cheeks, the band parodied politics, life at Rice, and other members of the Southwest Conference. During this period the band also gradually stopped marching and began the &quot;scattering&quot; techniques for which it is now known. This type of entertainment proved popular with band members, since the rehearsal time necessary to learn a show was greatly reduced, thus becoming more manageable in conjunction with a full academic course load. These shows also become popular with Rice&#x27;s proudly irreverent student body.

===Modernization===
Dr. Ken Dye took over the director&#x27;s job in 1980. By emphasizing musical quality and contemporary show design, the band (now called the Marching Owl Band, or the MOB) could target and entertain a larger audience. In 1982, Dye updated the MOB&#x27;s uniforms, playing to the &quot;mob&quot; angle of the band&#x27;s acronym and introducing the gray felt fedoras that have ever since been the band&#x27;s trademark. Dr. Dye&#x27;s tenure at Rice saw MOBsters perform at the Opening Ceremonies of the 1984 Olympics, the 1985 Presidential Inauguration, the 1986 Statue of Liberty Celebration and U.S. Olympic Festival, as well as the 1993 Carnivale in Nice, France. Dr. Dye believed that travel was an important part of any major college band. During his time as MOB director, the band accompanied the football team to places as far afield as Tulane, Notre Dame, and the campuses of all three military service academies.

However, even with all of these notable accomplishments during his term at the helm, Dr. Dye&#x27;s greatest legacy continues to be the library of musical arrangements that he has left to the band. A prolific arranger, during his time at Rice Dye arranged literally hundreds of tunes for the MOB to perform (as well as many that have been published and used by other schools). Among the MOB repertoire are first-class arrangements of many rock, jazz, and blues standards, from China Grove to Proud Mary, Hawai’i 5-0 to Mortal Kombat, Rock Lobster to Vehicle.

===Disaster and rebirth===
In the spring of 1995, a fire in the Rice Memorial Center gutted much of the MOB band hall, as well as campus hang-out Willy&#x27;s Pub and other parts of the RMC. Devastated, members of the band wondered how the MOB could possibly recover. However, a move out of the aging band hall had already been planned, and this move was merely accelerated. Still, the MOB was forced to rebuild, working from a new band hall and purchasing new instruments, new uniforms, new equipment, new computers, and new office supplies all in time for the fall 1995 football season. On St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, 1997, the MOB released a CD called MOB Reborn, featuring 25 of the band&#x27;s favorite and most popular numbers.

===Turmoil and succession===
In 1996, the Southwest Conference disbanded. Rice, Southern Methodist University, and Texas Christian University joined the Western Athletic Conference, while traditional SWC opponents such as the University of Texas, Texas A&amp;M University, Baylor University, and Texas Tech University went to the Big 12. The resulting WAC swelled to an arguably unwieldy size, including schools from 16 states across 6 time zones. While this period saw the MOB travel to new locations such as California, it was also a significant adjustment for students and fans.

In 1997, Dr. Dye left Rice to rebuild the band program at the school now known as University of West Georgia, a position he held for only one year before moving on to a directorship at the University of Notre Dame in the fall of 1998. Mr. Sean Williams was hired in the summer of 1997 to serve the MOB and the Rice Band Department as interim director until a permanent replacement for Dye could be found. That replacement was Dr. Robert Cesario, who came from Tulsa, Oklahoma and took up the baton in the fall of 1998. After four years, Dr. Cesario resigned as Director of Rice Bands in the summer of 2002, and was succeeded by Mr. Charles Throckmorton.

In 2005, Rice joined Conference USA (C-USA), restoring cross-town rival, the University of Houston, to the status of conference opponent for the first time since the breakup of the Southwest Conference. The two are no longer conference rivals following UH&#x27;s 2013 departure for the American Athletic Conference. Despite considerable membership turnover in C-USA in the early 2010s, the league still brings Rice into contact with opponents from Texas to the Eastern Seaboard.

In October 2021, Rice announced it was joining the American Athletic Conference in 2023. Using this move as justification, the school&#x27;s athletics department chose to create a new pep band for basketball and volleyball games without consulting members of The MOB. The Rice community was outraged at all levels, but as of October 2022, the decision was yet to be reversed.

==Satire and controversy==
The MOB &quot;pokes fun at itself and the world&quot;, from political figures to Rice administration personnel to visiting teams. A few shows in particular have provoked more than the usual uproar:

* In 1973 the Texas A&amp;M Aggies took exception to a MOB performance which featured such typical MOB irreverence as Nazi-style goosestepping, turning the Aggie War Hymn into &quot;Little Wooden Soldier March&quot;, and forming a fire hydrant while playing &quot;Oh Where, Oh Where Has My Little Dog Gone?&quot; in reference to the Aggie mascot Reveille. After the game, the Aggies formed an angry mob outside Rice&#x27;s own stadium, trapping the Owl band inside for hours until police dispersed some of the crowd and allowed the band to exit, transported by food service trucks. In the years after this now-infamous show, attention has been focused on the shot at Reveille, and that this was an attempt to mock the mascot shortly after her death; in fact it was no more than &quot;poorly-aimed scatological humor&quot;, the mascot in question having been alive and present at the game.
* In 2007, the MOB used their halftime performance to poke fun at the legal woes facing some members of the Texas Longhorns. The band, wearing dark sunglasses, opened with the theme from &quot;Dragnet&quot;. Three members dressed as Longhorn football players ran around the field being chased by other band members carrying cardboard police cars. The Rice announcer narrated: &quot;In the two years since the MOB last visited Austin, your team&#x27;s demeanor — and misdemeanor — has changed. Buy a program at today&#x27;s game. It includes Mack Brown&#x27;s wrist-slap Top 10 and a photo guide to the next episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;.&quot;
* In 2011, the season opener against Texas in Austin saw the MOB form $EC during halftime as a commentary regarding Texas A&amp;M leaving the Big 12 Conference and moving to the Southeastern Conference. This happened days before A&amp;M announced its withdrawal from the Big 12 Conference and upcoming move to the SEC.
* In 2016, during the halftime performance of Rice&#x27;s game against Baylor, the band formed the roman numerals &quot;IX&quot; in reference to Title IX, the federal law at the center of an offseason sexual assault scandal at Baylor. They also made the shape of a star while playing the song &quot;Hit The Road Jack,&quot; alluding to the firing of former Baylor president Ken Starr in the wake of the scandal.

<doc id="893498" wikidata="Q240444" url="?curid=893498" title="FC Akhmat Grozny">
<text>Republican Football Club Akhmat (; ), commonly known as Akhmat Grozny, and formerly as Terek Grozny from 1958 to 2017, is a Russian professional football club based in Grozny that plays in the Russian Premier League.

==History==
The club was founded in 1946, as &quot;Dynamo&quot;; it changed its name in 1948 to &quot;Neftyanik&quot; and in 1958 to &quot;Terek&quot;. On 7 June 2017, the team was renamed &quot;Akhmat&quot;, after Akhmad Kadyrov, former President of the Chechen Republic.

In the 1990s the club was disbanded for some time due to the war in Chechnya. From the 1990s to 2007 the club played its home games in the neighbouring resort city of Pyatigorsk, Stavropol Krai. 

They won the Russian Cup by beating Krylya Sovetov Samara in the final and the Russian First Division in 2004. In 2004 they advanced through the UEFA Cup qualification by beating the Polish team Lech Poznań 1–0 in both legs but lost to Swiss outfit FC Basel in the first round. They played in the Russian Premier League in 2005 but were relegated after finishing last. Terek finished second in the First Division in 2007 and were promoted back into the Premier League.

Before the start of the 2008 Premier League season, the Russian Football Union granted Terek the right to host Premier League matches in Grozny. On 3 July 2008, Terek signed three Romanian players at once: Andrei Margaritescu (Dinamo București), Florentin Petre (CSKA Sofia) and Daniel Pancu (Rapid București). Terek finished 12th in the 2010 Russian Premier League season.

A new stadium has been built for the club.

Cameroonian FC Lotus-Terek Yaoundé, founded by Terek player Guy Stephane Essame and coached by Thomas Libiih, is a farm team of the Russian club.

In January 2011 the club signed former Dutch international Ruud Gullit to an 18-month contract to manage the club. On 14 June 2011 Gullit was sacked for poor results.

On 30 October 2017, manager Oleg Kononov resigned, with Mikhail Galaktionov taking over in a caretaker capacity, before being announced as Akhmat&#x27;s permanent manager on 14 December 2017.

On 30 September 2019, after a 2–0 away defeat to Sochi, Rashid Rakhimov resigned as manager, with Igor Shalimov being appointed as Rakhimov&#x27;s replacement the same day. On 26 July 2020, Igor Shalimov&#x27;s contract as manager expired and he left Akhmat Grozny, to be replaced by Andrei Talalayev.

On 11 September 2022, Andrei Talalayev was relieved of his duties as Head Coach, with Yury Nagaytsev taking over in a caretaker capacity. On 22 September 2022, Sergei Tashuyev was announced as Akhmat Grozny&#x27;s new permanent Head Coach.

<text>Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple (श्री त्र्यंबकेश्वर ज्योतिर्लिंग मंदिर) is an ancient Hindu temple in the town of Trimbak, in the Trimbakeshwar tehsil in the Nashik District of Maharashtra, India, 28 km from the city of Nashik and 40 km from Nashik road. It is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva and is one of the twelve &quot;jyotirlingas&quot; where the Hindu genealogy registers at Trimbakeshwar, Maharashtra are kept. The origin of the sacred Godavari River is near Trimbak. Several Hindu rituals are carried out in Trimbakeshwar, for that pilgrims travel from all over India.

Kusavarta &quot;kunda&quot; (sacred pond) in the temple premises, built by Shrimant Sardar Raosaheb Parnerkar who was the Fadnavis of Indore State, is the source of the Godavari River, the second longest river in India. A bust of Sardar Fadnavis and his wife can be seen on the edge of the kunda. The current temple was built by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao after it was destroyed by Mughal ruler Aurangzeb.

==Architecture==

The temple is located between three hills namely:
* Brahmagiri,
* Nilagiri and
* Kalagiri.
The temple has three &quot;lingas&quot; (an iconic form of Shiva) representing:
* Shiva,
* Vishnu and
* Brahma.
The temple tank is called Amritavarshini, which measured by . There are three other bodies of water, namely:
* Bilvatirtha,
* Viswanantirtha and
* Mukundatirtha.
There are images of various deities, namely,
* Ganga,
* Jaleswara,
* Rameswara,
* Gautameswara,
* Kedarnatha,
* Rama,
* Krishna,
* Parashurama and
* Lakshmi Narayana.
The temple also has several monasteries and samadhis of saints.

==Jyotirlinga==

As per the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of preservation) had an argument in terms of supremacy of creation. To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the &quot;jyotirlinga&quot;. Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either direction. Brahma lied that he found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as the second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped till the end of eternity. The &quot;jyotirlinga&quot; is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. The &quot;Jyotirlinga&quot; shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light. Originally there were believed to be 64 &quot;jyotirlingas&quot; while 12 of them are considered to be very auspicious and holy. Each of the twelve &quot;jyotirlinga&quot; sites take the name of the presiding deity - each considered different manifestation of Shiva. At all these sites, the primary image is &quot;lingam&quot; representing the beginningless and endless &quot;Stambha&quot; pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva. The twelve &quot;jyothirlinga&quot; are:
* Somnath at Veraval in Gujarat,
* Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh,
* Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh,
* Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh,
* Kedarnath in Himalayas,
* Bhimashankar in Maharashtra,
* Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh,
* Triambakeshwar in Nashik in Maharashtra,
* Vaidyanath at Deoghar in Jharkhand,
* Nageshwar Temple at Dwaraka in Gujarat,
* Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and
* Grishneshwar at Aurangabad in Maharashtra.
Shiva showed himself as a Jyotirlinga on the night of the Aridra Nakshatra. It is believed that a person can see the Jyotirlingas as columns of fire piercing through the earth as he reaches a higher level of spiritual attainment. Each Jyotirlinga site takes the name of the presiding deity. Basically, the Jyotirlinga signifies the infinite nature of Shiva. At the highest level, Shiva is regarded as formless, limitless, transcendent and unchanging absolute Brahman and the primal Atman (soul, self) of the universe.

===Genealogy registers===
Hindu genealogy registers at Trimbakeshwar are the genealogy registers of pilgrims maintained here by pandits.

==Temple legend==

Shri Trimbakeshwar is a religious center having one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. The extraordinary feature of the Jyotirlinga located here is its three faces embodying Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Due to the excessive use of water, the linga has started to erode. It is said that this erosion symbolizes the eroding nature of human society. The Lingas are covered by a jeweled crown which is placed over the Gold Mask of Trideva (Brahma Vishnu Shiva). The crown is said to be from the age of Pandavas and consists of diamonds, emeralds, and many precious stones. The original Nassak Diamond which adorned the revered linga was eventually stolen by the British and currently is placed on a sword. The crown is displayed every Monday from 4-5 pm (Shiva).

All other Jyotirlingas have Shiva as the main deity. The entire black stone temple is known for its appealing architecture and sculpture and is at the foothills of a mountain called Brahmagiri. Three sources of the Godavari originate from the Brahmagiri mountain.

==Story related to the Godavari River==

The Godavari River is often referred to as the Ganga of the South due to its significance. According to Hindu mythology, the Godavari has a divine origin, and several stories are linked to its creation.

The Birth of the Godavari – Sage Gautama’s Penance:

Sage Gautama is a central figure in the story of the Godavari&#x27;s origin. It is said that Gautama Rishi once lived in a secluded ashram with his wife, Ahalya, in the region of Trimbakeshwar (near modern-day Trimbak in Maharashtra).
There was a severe drought that affected the region, and the local people suffered from hunger and thirst. To alleviate their suffering, Sage Gautama prayed to the river Ganges for help. However, the Ganges was reluctant to come to the region due to the disturbance caused by her descent from the heavens.
Sage Gautama performed intense penance and austerities for thousands of years at the peak of Brahmagiri Hill, located in the Trimbakeshwar area. Pleased with his devotion, Lord Shiva agreed to bless Gautama and directed the Ganges to flow in that region.
However, the river could not directly flow due to the wrath of Shiva, and instead, the Ganges appeared as a stream and flowed to the earth through the Trimbak hills. This stream eventually became known as the Godavari River.
The Godavari river is considered sacred, and it is believed that Sage Gautama bathed in its waters to purify himself from the sin of unintentionally killing a cow. This act of penance and purification is a key part of the mythological origin of the river.
Connection to Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva:

Another legend states that the river Godavari was created by Lord Vishnu in the form of Trivikram (the Vamana avatar), who pressed the earth with his foot to release water, which eventually formed the Godavari River. Some accounts suggest that the river emerged from the feet of Lord Vishnu.
Another part of the story involves Lord Shiva, who, when pleased with Sage Gautama’s penance, allowed the Ganges to flow from the heavens and take the form of the Godavari, thus further associating the river with divine blessings.
This place is known for its many religious rituals (vidhis). Narayan Nagbali, Kalsarpa Shanti, Tripindi Vidhi are done here. Narayan Nagbali puja is performed at Trimbakeshwar only. This puja is performed in three days. This puja is performed on special dates. Some days are not suitable to perform this puja. This puja is performed for many reasons like to cure an illness, going through bad times, killing a Cobra (Nag), childless couples, financial crisis or you want to perform some religious puja to have everything.

Trimbakeshwar town has a large number of Brahmin households and is also a centre for Vedic Gurukuls (kind of boarding school). It also has ashrams and Muths devoted to Ashtanga Yoga, the Hindu art of living.

The existing temple was built out of basalt after it was commissioned by Peshwa Nanasaheb. It so happens that the Peshwa made a bet on whether the stone surrounding the Jyotirlinga, is hollow from the inside or not. The stone was proved to be hollow, and on losing the bet, the Peshwa built a marvelous temple out of it.

The Shiva deity of the temple consisted of the famous Nassak Diamond. It was looted by the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War and lies with one owner or the other ever since. The diamond presently lies with Edward J. Hand, a trucking firm executive from Greenwich, Connecticut, USA.

The place is known for its scenery in the rainy/monsoon season. Anjaneri mountain, the birthplace of Hanuman, is 7 km from Trimbakeshwar.

==Shri Nilambika/Dattatreya/ Matamba Temple==

This temple is on top of the Neel mountain. All goddesses (&#x27;Matamba&#x27;, &#x27;Renuka&#x27;, &#x27;Mananmba&#x27;) came here to see &#x27;Parashuram&#x27; when he was performing penance (tapas). After his penance, he requested all goddesses to stay there and the temple was formed for these goddesses.

Akhil Bhartiya Shree Swami Samarth Gurupeeth, Trimbakeshwar Temple of Shri Swami Samarth Maharaj. This temple is 1 km from Shiva Temple. This temple is a marvelous example of Vastu Shastra.

Bhimashankaram shrine and the Bhimarathi river have been talked about in writings as far back as the 13th century; however, the current construction of the temple seems to be fairly new.

The temple is built in the &quot;Nagara&quot; style, which combines traditional and modern designs. The temple hall was constructed during the 18th century by Nāna Phadnavis of Peshwa. The village of Kharosi was granted to the temple by King Shivaji. The daily religious observance was funded through the financial resources derived from the people of the area.

He offered one here at Bhimashankar and the others in Menavali, near Wai, in front of a &quot;Shiva&quot; temple on the banks of the Krishna River, the Banshanker Temple in Pune, the Omkareshwar Temple in Pune, and the Ramlinga Temple in Pune (Shirur).

Chimaji Appa (brother of Bajirao I) donated a big bell to the temple, which is visible in front of the temple. This is one of the many Portuguese colonists&#x27; church&#x27;s bell, which Chimaji and his army brought from Vasai as souvenirs after defeating the Portuguese at the Battle of Baçaim on February 1739. This type of bell is also present at the Khandoba temple and Naro Shankar mandir in Nashik.

== Legend ==
The shrine is linked to the legendary &quot;asura&quot; known as &quot;Tripura&quot;. The story goes that Tripura did penance, and Brahma, delighted with Tripura&#x27;s penance, manifests and grants him three wishes. Tripura demanded that he be invulnerable to the gods, devils, &quot;yakshas&quot;, and &quot;gandharvas&quot;. His three &quot;puras&quot; should be unbreakable, and he should be able to travel anywhere in the universe. All his desires were fulfilled. Tripura embarked on a conquest to subjugate three Loka. Indra, the deity associated with the heavens, was also vanquished. Indra made the decision to seek blessings from the deity Shiva and performed penance. Shiva made a vow to annihilate Tripura.

On the peak of the Sahyadri hills, it is said that Shiva assumed the form of &quot;Bhīmā Shankara&quot; at the behest of the gods, and the sweat that spilled from his body after the battle is said to have formed the &quot;Bhimarathi&quot; river.

==Architecture==
The architectural style of Bhimashankar is characterised by the use of the Nagara style, which is commonly found in northern India. The building style has some similarities to the &quot;Hemadpanthi&quot; style, which is common in the Deccan region. It is claimed that the old temple was built on a &quot;Swayambhu Shiva Linga&quot;.

Furthermore, it can be seen that the &quot;Ling&quot; is located precisely in the center of the &quot;Garbhagriha&quot; (&quot;Sanctum sanctorum&quot;) of the temple. The &quot;garbhagriha&quot; and &quot;antarala&quot; are constructed using indigenous stone in the Indo-Aryan architectural style, which is also commonly found in Jain temples. The pillars and door frames of the temple are covered with intricate carvings of deities and human figures.

In the 18th century, Nāna Phadnavis built the &quot;Sabhamandap&quot;; he also designed and built the &quot;shikhara&quot;. The Maratha King Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj endowed this temple to facilitate religious ceremonies.

== Vicinity ==

In addition to the Bhimashankar Mandir, devotees also take &quot;darshan&quot; of the deities of temples present in the vicinity. There is a shrine for &quot;Siva Ganams&quot;, &quot;Shaakini,&quot; and &quot;Daakini,&quot; who assisted Shiva in the battle against the demon Tripurasur.

There are other temples near the main temple, such as &quot;Kamalaja&quot; &quot;mata,&quot; who is an incarnation of Goddess Parvathi and who aided Shiva in his battle against Tripurasur.

Behind the Bhimashankar temple is &quot;Mokshakund Tirtha&quot;. The custom is to take a bath in the &quot;kund&quot; before proceeding to the temple. The &quot;kund&quot; is the result of Maha-muni Kaushika&#x27;s legendary penance here. Additionally, there are the Jnyankund that Dattatreya created and the Sarvatirth connected to the goddess Bhashitadevi. Kusharanya tirth is located to the south of the temple, and it is from here that the Bhima River begins to flow eastward.

A minor shrine dedicated to Lord Shani can be seen within the temple&#x27;s grounds. There is a statue of &quot;Nandi&quot; in front of the Bhimashankar &quot;Shiva Linga&quot;.

The &quot;Shani Temple&quot; is situated within the main complex of the Bhimashankar temple.

Between the two pillars in front of the &quot;Shani&quot; shrine, there is an enormous antique Portuguese church bell. Behind the temple, there is a narrow walk that goes to the riverbanks. Outside the temple, there is a large area of forest that is sometimes broken up by forts on the mountains nearby.

<text>In motorsports, a pit stop is a pause for refuelling, new tyres, repairs, mechanical adjustments, a driver change, as a penalty, or any combination of the above. These stops occur in an area called the pits, most commonly accessed via a pit lane which runs parallel to the start/finish straightaway of the track and is connected to it at each end. Along this lane is a row of garages (typically one per team or car) outside which the work is done in a &quot;pit box&quot;. Pit stop work is carried out by the pit crew of up to twenty mechanics, depending on the series regulations, while the driver often waits in the vehicle (except where a driver change is involved or in motorbike racing).

The term is also used generically to describe a short break in a journey.

==Location and terminology==

Depending on the circuit, the garage may be located on pit lane or in a separate area.

In most series, the order of the teams&#x27; pit boxes is assigned by points standings, race results, or previous qualifying results before the start of the race. In NASCAR and in INDYCAR&#x27;s Indianapolis 500, typically pit assignments are made after qualifying, with the fastest qualifiers choosing their pit stall first.

Most North American circuits feature a pit lane with a number of pit stalls (typically 30–50) and a pit wall that separates the pit lane from the infield, with the garages (if used) on a separate road in the infield. In races where there are different series racing together, each series has its own separate garage or are parked in their own area. Circuits in other parts of the world (used in Formula One) typically have the individual garages open directly onto the pit lane through the team&#x27;s assigned pit box. In American English, it is common to drop the definite article and just refer to &quot;pit road&quot;, whereas in British English one would always refer to &quot;the pit lane&quot;. A further difference is that in British English, the term &quot;pit box&quot; is universally used, whereas in American English, one would say &quot;pit stall&quot;. In NASCAR, a pit box is a tool (see below), though there is a definitive term used for them.

== Purpose ==
Where it is permitted, refuelling is often an important purpose of a pit stop. Carrying fuel slows down a vehicle, and there is often a limit on the size of the fuel tank, so many races require multiple stops for fuel to complete the race distance in the minimum time. Changing tyres is also common, to permit the use of softer tyres that wear faster but provide more grip, to use tyres suitable for wet conditions, or to use a range of tyres designated by the rules. Teams will aim for each of their vehicles to pit following a planned schedule, with the number of stops determined by many factors, such as fuel capacity, tyre lifespan, and the trade-off between time lost in the pits versus time gained on the track due to the benefits of pit stops. Choosing the optimum pit strategy of how many stops to make and when to make them is crucial in having a successful race. It is also important for teams to take competitors&#x27; strategies into account when planning pit stops to avoid being held up behind a competitor where overtaking is difficult or risky. An unscheduled or extended stop, such as for a repair, can be very costly for a driver&#x27;s chance of success, because while they are stopped for service, competitors remaining on the track are gaining time on them. For this reason, the pit crew often undergo intensive training to perform operations such as tyre changes as quickly as possible, leading to pit stops, for example, as in Formula 1, where the car is only stationary for a few seconds for a regular pit stop.

== General strategy ==

In any racing series that permits scheduled pit stops, pit strategy becomes one of the most important features of the race; this is because a race car travelling at 100 miles per hour (160 kilometres per hour) will travel approximately 150 feet (45 metres) per second. During a ten-second pit stop, a car&#x27;s competitors will gain approximately one-quarter-mile (450 metres) over the stopped car.

However, the car that made the additional pit stop will run faster on the race track than cars that did not make the stop, both because it can carry a smaller amount (and thus lower weight) of fuel, and will also have less wear on its tyres, providing more traction and allowing higher speeds in the corners. In racing series where teams have their choice of different compound tyres, the lower tyre wear may be enough to allow the team to choose to use a tyre with a softer rubber compound that provides increased grip at the expense of faster wear; going longer between stops may even cause enough wear on the softer tyre to cause the tyres to fail.

Because of this, race teams plan a pit strategy prior to the start of every race. This is a schedule for each car&#x27;s planned pit stops during the race, and takes into account factors such as rate of fuel consumption, weight of fuel, cornering speed with each available tyre compound, rate of tyre wear, the effect of tyre wear on cornering speed, the length of pit road and the track&#x27;s pit road speed limit, and even expected changes in weather and lighting conditions. The pit strategy does not just include a schedule of &quot;when&quot; pit stops will happen; it also includes what service and adjustments are scheduled for each pit stop, particularly in endurance racing, where scheduled changes of wear-limited parts such as brake pads may be planned for specific points during the race. The pit strategy is calculated carefully so that the amount of time to be &quot;given away&quot; to other competitors in pit stops is balanced by the time gained while on the track, resulting, theoretically, in the shortest possible time to cover the scheduled distance.

However, a team&#x27;s pit strategy is not a fixed, immutable thing; it is subject to change during the race to take into account the unpredictable events that happen in every race. In road racing, for example, if the weather changes from dry to rain, teams will be forced to recalculate their pit strategy based on the unscheduled stop to change from dry-weather &quot;slick&quot; tyres to treaded wet-weather tyres. Safety car periods often see mass pit stops by many teams, hoping to take advantage of the slowed pace to reduce the ground lost to other teams while making pit stops; this forces teams that do so to immediately recalculate their pit strategy to optimize it for the remaining race distance after the stop.

Even when a team chooses not to take advantage of the opportunity to stop during a full-course caution, it can still result in significant changes to pit strategy; under caution, the cars run at a reduced speed that results in greatly reduced tyre wear and fuel burn for a distance travelled. Depending on the circumstances, this may be enough for a team to gain more by choosing not to pit, hoping that the reduced fuel burn and tyre wear will allow them to make one pit stop fewer than the other teams, allowing them to gain distance and time on their opponents. At tracks noted for frequent full-course cautions, teams may even plan their entire race strategy around this, using a suspension and aerodynamic setup suited to short sprints instead of extended runs to gain positions in the short bursts of green-flag racing, and planning their pit strategy on the assumption that cautions will extend their fuel mileage and tyre wear enough to make fewer stops than would otherwise be needed to complete the race distance.

== Services performed ==
During a scheduled pit stop, the team&#x27;s pit crew services the vehicle as quickly as possible, completing a number of different services. The most common services performed are refuelling (where permitted) and changing tyres.

Other services performed in routine pit stops include removing debris from radiator air intakes, cleaning the windscreen, and making adjustments to tyre pressure, suspension settings, and aerodynamic devices to optimize the vehicle&#x27;s performance for the current conditions. In endurance racing, scheduled driver changes and brake pad replacements are also considered &quot;routine&quot; service when done as part of a scheduled pit stop.

An unscheduled pit stop may see other services performed; because unscheduled stops are often due to damage or mechanical problems, they may include emergency repairs and replacement of parts.

In some forms of racing, a team may be ordered to bring a vehicle into the pits as a penalty and either drive through the pit lane at the maximum permitted speed or remain stationary in their pit box for a specified period of time. During this time no services can be performed.

== Formula One ==

In Formula One, mid-race refuelling has been banned since 2010, and cars make pit stops with the primary purpose of changing tyres. Teams sometimes also make adjustments to the front and rear wings and perform minor repairs, most commonly replacing the nose and front wing assembly. A pit stop typically takes approximately 3 seconds to complete. McLaren holds the current world record for the fastest pit stop, with a 1.80-second stop performed at the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix on Lando Norris. Pit strategies generally call for between one and four scheduled stops, depending on the circuit. The drives between pit stops are commonly known as &#x27;stints&#x27;.

When the car is approximately one lap away from making its stop, the team&#x27;s pit crew will set up fresh tyres and all needed pit equipment. Because of the overhead pneumatic rig, the team may have all pit mechanics in position before the car&#x27;s arrival, except for the rear jack man.

Unlike almost all other forms of racing that feature routine pit stops, Formula One rules limit teams to a single pit crew for the mandatory two cars entered. Most other racing series that feature routine pit stops permit each car its own pit stall and crew. Therefore, teams must stagger their pit schedules so that only one of their two cars is in the pits at any given time; otherwise, one car must wait for the other car to finish services. However, with proper timing or in special conditions (for example, in the period immediately after the safety car being called out), it is possible for teams to pit both cars on the same lap without losing significant time; this is known as the &#x27;double stack&#x27; strategy. This allows both of the team&#x27;s drivers to race on equally fresh tyres, preventing either from having an advantage over the other, and helps the team hide the relative performance between two cars to other teams when only one car is in the pits.

One strategy commonly used in Formula One pit stops is the &#x27;undercut&#x27; involving two cars battling for track position. In this strategy, the car behind makes an earlier pit stop than the leading car; if successful, the car behind should be able to utilize the advantage of having fresh tyres to reduce the lead of the car they are attempting to overtake. If the gap between the two cars is reduced to less than the time lost in a pit stop, when the leading car pits, the leading car will exit the pits behind the car which pitted first. This strategy is especially effective when the leading car is stuck in traffic and/or if the car behind has clear track to push on, but can be negated if the car behind gets stuck in traffic after their early pit stop or is unable to drive fast enough to neutralize the advantage of the leading car. Similarly, there is the reverse (but less common) strategy of the &#x27;overcut&#x27;, where the leading car stays out on their older tyres longer and laps fast enough to maintain or even extend their advantage over the car behind—this strategy may be successful if the leading car&#x27;s tyres are still in good shape when the car behind pits, sufficiently so that the leading car can push without being overly limited by tyre degradation, or if the car behind gets stuck in traffic, thus negating their ability to utilise their fresher tyres to their advantage.

=== Refuelling ===
Refuelling, now banned in F1 races, was permitted until , and then again from the 1994 season to the 2009 season. During this period, a pit stop involved about twenty mechanics, with the aim of completing the stop as quickly as possible. Stops generally lasted for six to twelve seconds, depending upon how much fuel was put into the car. However, if there was a problem, such as a fuel pump failing or the engine stalling, or repairs having to be made, it could take much longer. Cars were fuelled at a rate of more than 12 litres per second. This was accomplished by a fairly complex closed system that pumped air out of the car&#x27;s fuel tank as the fuel was being pumped in.

Since fuel was a significant portion of a car&#x27;s weight, teams varied the amount of fuel loaded into a car at any given stop (and prior to the race) and thus vary the number of pit stops. The most common strategies seen were one-stop and two-stop strategies; two-stop strategies were employed to increase the car&#x27;s speed/improve lap times to catch cars ahead, whereas one-stop strategies were used to gain time and track position to cars ahead with the advantage of one fewer pit stop. However, teams could and sometimes did opt for unorthodox pit strategies with multiple (3+) pit stops, as was employed by Ferrari and Michael Schumacher with four stops at the 2004 French Grand Prix, which he eventually won.

As refuelling was a potentially hazardous situation, the mechanics wore fire-resistant multi-layer suits and flame-resistant gloves, long underwear, balaclava, socks and shoes, which had to meet the guidelines set by FIA Standard 8856-2000.

=== Formula One pit crew roles ===
*Four &quot;wheel-gunners&quot; or &quot;tyre changers&quot;, one for each wheel/corner of the car, use a pneumatic wrench (&quot;tyre gun&quot;) to remove the car&#x27;s single locking lug nut from each tyre then reinstall it on the new tyre.
*Eight &quot;tyre carriers&quot; are used (four each of &quot;wheel-off&quot; and &quot;wheel-on&quot;), two for each wheel/corner of the car, one to remove the old tyre from the car and one to put the new tyre in place.
*Two &quot;stabilisers&quot; stabilise the car on each side at the middle of the car.
*The &quot;front wing men&quot;, if necessary, adjust the front wing angle (to provide more/less downforce) and/or change the entire front wing (in case of damage sustained during the race).
*The front and rear &quot;jack men&quot; use lever-type jacks to lift the car and permit the changing of tyres during the pit stop.
**The job of the front jack man is generally considered the most hazardous of the entire pit crew, as it requires standing directly in front of the car as it enters its pit box. Mechanics in this role have been injured in the past when drivers have overshot/failed to brake in time for their pit box.
**By contrast, due to the location of his duties directly behind the car, the rear jack man is the only team member not in his working position before the car enters its pit box.
*The &quot;fire extinguisher man&quot; stands ready with a hand-held fire extinguisher to put out any fires that may occur during a stop, at least long enough for the pit crew and driver to evacuate. This job became standard following Jos Verstappen&#x27;s 1994 pit fire.
**Sometimes, more than one pit crew member may perform this role if a car comes in for an unscheduled stop with mechanical issues involving a fire/excessive heat (e.g. overheating brakes).

Deprecated roles

*The &quot;lollipop man&quot; held the team&#x27;s pit sign (nicknamed the &quot;lollipop&quot; for its circular shape, hence the name of the role), helping the driver identify his pit box on the pit lane and holding it in position during the stop to remind the driver to keep his brakes on while tyres are being changed, to remember to put the car in first gear once the jacks are lowered, and finally to signal the driver to leave the pit box once the pit stop was complete by raising the sign. 
**Nowadays, this role is carried out by a traffic light system—drivers drive into their team pit by memory or by watching the crews out on pit lane and are signaled to leave the pit box by a series of lights suspended over the driver&#x27;s head in the pit box controlled from the garage.
*The &quot;refueling man&quot; managed the refueling system for the car, hooking it in place during the pit stop and disengaging it when refueling was complete.
**With refueling having been banned in F1 from the 2010 season onwards, this role is no longer necessary as cars no longer refuel mid-race.
*The &quot;starter man&quot; stood ready with a starter tool to restart the car should the driver stall his engine during the pit stop.
**Nowadays, as modern F1 cars have anti-stall systems, and also can be started by the driver independently if needed using the car&#x27;s battery, this role is no longer necessary, unless a situation calls for a complete engine reset.
== Formula E ==
For its first four seasons, pit stops in Formula E served the primary purpose of changing cars—since FE cars did not yet contain the necessary electric charge to complete a full race, drivers needed to switch cars during the race. With the exception of repairing damaged tyres, no other mechanic services were allowed to be performed on the cars during the pit stop.

Prior to the 2017–18 season, the rule and scoring system in Formula E allowed for some unusual pit stop strategies. Previously, drivers scored one point for setting the fastest lap in the race regardless of finishing position (or whether they finished the race at all); hence, a driver with no chance at finishing in the point-scoring positions for whatever reason could switch cars, wait for the prematurely right moment to come out of the pits and set the fastest lap of the race. Notably, this was seen in the 2016 London ePrix, when championship contenders Sébastien Buemi and Lucas di Grassi utilised this strategy after their first lap crash rendered them otherwise unable to score points; Buemi ended up with the fastest lap, winning the Formula E 2016 drivers&#x27; championship as a direct result. For the 2017–18 season, Formula E&#x27;s rules were amended to restrict the additional point for fastest lap to drivers finishing in the top 10 only, rendering the aforementioned strategy obsolete.

For Formula E&#x27;s fifth season (2018–19), new cars were introduced which had batteries capable of completing the entire race distance; thus, such pit stops were no longer used during races, other than in the event of repairing damage.
Plans are underway in Formula E to bring back pit stops in a race, but this time it would be not to change tyres or the car but to charge the car using high speed electric charging stations. The details are yet to be finalised.

== NASCAR ==

Crew chiefs lead the pit crew during pit stops in addition to coaching the driver during the race. Pit crew members were once the mechanics on the racecar, but most teams feature individuals dedicated to pit stops only, and often former collegiate or professional athletes are used for pit stops. Former NFL player Tim Goad is regarded as the first former professional athlete involved in a pit crew, as a jackman. Nonetheless, some pit crew members work with the team in fabricating or designing the race cars during the week while training for their &quot;pit job&quot; on the weekends. Teams have built full training centers similar to that of professional athletes for their pit crews.

There are a number of penalties that can be incurred on a pit stop. The driver must keep the car below the pit road speed from the pit entrance to the pit exit; the speed limit is typically , depending on the size of the track. Teams can be penalized if the car is serviced outside of the designated pit stall, if the car drives over an air hose, or if any of the old tires are not on the pit wall side (usually left) of the vehicle&#x27;s centerline before the car leaves. The most common penalty for a pit infraction is a &quot;drive-through&quot;: the driver must enter the pits again, under the green flag, and maintain the pit speed limit for the entire length of pit road. If a car stalls, the pit crew may provide a push start, but the car cannot be pushed beyond three pit stalls ahead of its own, or beyond the pit exit light and steward at the end of pit road.

Pit stops are timed from the moment the car stops in its pit stall until service is finished and the car leaves the stall. A pit stop for four tires and fuel can last 12 to 16 seconds, and a stop for two tires and fuel may take 5 to 7 seconds. Late in a race, a team may only need a small amount of fuel to make it to finish; this is called a &quot;splash and go&quot; and may take as little as 2 to 3 seconds. These times depend upon any suspension adjustments performed and the quality of the crew.

NASCAR Cup Series team pit strategies vary widely, depending on the track. Fuel is generally a more limiting factor than tire wear, and the phrase &quot;fuel window&quot; or &quot;pit window&quot; is used to indicate the maximum number of laps possible with a full load of fuel, assuming continuous green flag conditions and a small reserve. The window is used to calculate (or recalculate after a stop) the minimum number of pit stops required to complete the race. The road courses on the schedule may see as few as two scheduled stops; oval race tracks generally see between four and six scheduled stops. Races at short tracks such as Bristol Motor Speedway and Martinsville Speedway are short enough to be completed with only two scheduled stops for fuel, but teams plan on more stops due to rapid tire wear and significant loss of cornering speed on worn tires. If one team pits for tires and is considerably faster (between 1 and 3 seconds per lap), then teams will usually follow quickly to avoid losing time.

Pit strategy can play a significant role in the outcome of a NASCAR race, perhaps more so than other racing series. Under caution, most teams use similar strategies to avoid being caught alone, typically following the leader&#x27;s decision to stay out or pit, but sometimes teams will deliberately pit &quot;off-sequence&quot; if they feel they can gain an advantage later. Race tactics can affect strategy as well. Late in a race, drivers can reduce throttle input to save fuel at the cost of slower lap times, but by doing so they can stretch their pit window to the end of the race and skip the final pit stop. A late caution can force teams to make a tough call: Stay out on worn tires, or pit and give up track position. The green-white-checker rule can cause headaches, as it can potentially extend the race an unknown number of both green-flag and yellow-flag laps. Furthermore, strategy can be determined by qualifying position. A team that qualifies in the top six positions will have the best choice of pit stalls, most often choosing the first, last, or a stall with an opening either in front of or behind that one. A team that qualifies deeper in the field will have a greater opportunity to be stacked behind cars during a pit stop, slowing them down.

=== NASCAR pit crew roles ===
* The &quot;crew chief&quot; is the leader of the pit crew. They are responsible for all aspects of the crew, car set-up (from the construction of the car at the shop down to in-race handling adjustments), and at-track activities. They call the team&#x27;s pit strategy (usually with the help of one or more race engineers who monitor telemetry) and will hire a pit crew coach to help coordinate the pit stops and train the pit crew members to stay in good physical shape. NASCAR regulations dictate that only five individuals can go &quot;over the wall&quot; to service a racecar during a pit stop. The tool limits on the crew are two impact wrenches, one jack, and two cans of gasoline. Other tools may be used if needed, but major work must be performed in the garage area. An important tool used by the crew chief is referred to as the pit box, but colloquially called the &quot;war wagon&quot;. The pit box is generally equipped with flat-screen monitors and the television broadcast of the event. These tools are used to help analyze the car up close during any moment of the race.
* The &quot;car chief&quot; performs a majority of the scheduling and day-to-day preparations at the shop prior to the race weekend. This person is responsible for managing the crew throughout the weekend, ensuring that the car meets all of NASCAR&#x27;s inspection requirements, and overseeing changes to the car requested by the crew chief or the team engineer. This role is similar to that of a chief operating officer&#x27;s in general. If the crew chief is not able to attend the race, the car chief will occasionally serve as interim crew chief.
*The &quot;jackman&quot; raises each side of the car so that the tires can be replaced. This person must do this quickly with the use of a 22-pound (10 kg) floor jack. while also removing and reinstalling the rear tires since the removal of the rear &quot;tire carrier&quot;. The jackman signals for the driver to leave the pits by lowering the car.
*The two &quot;tire changers&quot; remove and tighten the lug nuts on the tires using a specification impact wrench (or &quot;air gun&quot;) made by Paoli (prior to the 2018 season, air guns were open to development, and top teams often built their own from scratch). One tire changer is solely responsible for the front tires, while the other is responsible for the rears. Until the 2022 season, NASCAR required a wheel to have five traditional lug nuts, as opposed to the single locking lug nut seen in other professional racing categories. Many jackmen watched the tire changers to make sure the lug nuts are tight, as NASCAR rules stated that all five lug nuts must be in contact with the wheel.
*The &quot;fueler&quot; or &quot;gas man&quot; fills the car with Sunoco Green E15 racing fuel using a special gas can. The fueler is normally prohibited from doing any other work during a stop but may also help pull old tires from the race car after lug nuts are loosened if the car does not need fuel. Prior to the 2011 season, an additional crewman (the &quot;catch-can&quot; man) was allowed over the wall to hold a special can over the car&#x27;s fuel system overflow port to collect any spilled fuel. NASCAR disallowed the catch-can man in 2011 after self-venting fuel cans were developed.
*The &quot;tire carrier&quot; brings new outside tires over the pit wall and removes and installs the front tires. They must maintain control of old tires as they are being taken back to the wall, where additional team members will have the new inside tires ready and waiting. The front tire carrier is usually responsible for pulling damaged front fenders away from the tire if necessary. He may also be responsible for cleaning and adding or removing tape to/from the grille during a pit stop in order to adjust front-end downforce and engine temperatures.
*The &quot;utility man&quot; is only permitted over the wall in the second half of the race (sometimes earlier if conditions and NASCAR dictate otherwise). He may clean the windshield and provide the driver with fresh drinking water and other necessities, but he may not make any other adjustments to the car.

== IndyCar Series ==

In the IndyCar Series, a pit stop is a more complex operation than in NASCAR, but far less so than in Formula One. Rules permit seven mechanics over the pit wall during a stop. The pit rules and procedures have origins in USAC National Championship racing. The spare fuel for IndyCar competition is stored in large pitside fuel tanks. Each team&#x27;s tank is filled to a specified volume of fuel, depending upon the race distance. Teams are also given a certain allotment of spare tires sets, likewise owing to the race distance. All of the spare tires are pre-mounted on wheels before the race.

During a routine pit stop, the tires are laid out beforehand, and three of the four tire changers are pre-positioned before the car enters its pit stall. The fourth tire changer, whose responsibility is the rear tire on the far side of pit road from the pit wall, does not take his position until after the car arrives, due to a rule against having the car run over the feed hose for the impact wrench used to change the tires, and a prohibition of using an overhead boom to support air hoses. As a result, the outside rear changer also serves to wave at the driver to inform him of where his pit box is while holding the air hose up.

As soon as the car comes to a halt, the first step, taken while the fourth tire changer assumes his position, is for a mechanic to activate the car&#x27;s built-in pneumatic jacks. A pressurized air hose is inserted into a receiving nozzle at the rear of the car, under the rear wing. Previously, this device was inserted on the side of the car, but for safety reasons, the location was moved in the 2000s. At the same instant, another crew member begins the refueling process. A fueling hose is inserted into a socket (called the &quot;buckeye&quot;), allowing a gravity-fed hose to refill the car&#x27;s fuel tank. The fuel hose has a built-in vent/overflow hose as part of the mechanism, an invention of the mid-2000s. Previously, a second &quot;vent hose&quot; was utilized, but it was phased out to improve safety.

Simultaneously, the four tire changers remove the wheels and install the new ones. IndyCar wheels are affixed to the hubs with a single lug nut, making it easier and faster to change them. After the tire changes are complete, the front tire changers may use manual adjusters to adjust the angle of the car&#x27;s front wing, remove debris from air intakes, or make other minor repairs. While the service is being completed by the over-the-wall crew, another crew member behind the wall may use a stick to offer the driver a refreshment.

Since the introduction of the Aeroscreen in 2020 the seventh crew member is permitted to remove tear-offs from the screen allowing the driver to have clearer vision by removing debris. This crew member is typically gloveless and is not permitted to interact with the car in any other way.

After the tire changes are complete, the air jack hose is removed, dropping the car to the ground. However, the driver usually must wait additional seconds until the refueling is complete. The right front tire changer (who is usually also the crew chief) signals the driver when the stop is complete. Before the car departs its pit stall, a crew member must squirt water to wash any excess spilled fuel from the fuel buckeye; this is usually done with a pressurized water hose by a crew member behind the pit wall.

Under normal conditions, a routine stop for an IndyCar team lasts between six and ten seconds. IndyCar teams are permitted to set their own pit strategies.

== Super Formula ==
In Super Formula, Japan&#x27;s top-level single-seater series, a total of six mechanics are allowed to work on a car. Of these six, three have fixed roles: the lollipop-signalman, the refueler, and the fire-fighter. They are forbidden from undertaking any other function during the pit stop. The remaining three mechanics are responsible for all other operations, most notably jacking up the car and changing the tyres. The general strategy is to have the three free mechanics operate on the car in an assembly-line-like manner, moving around the car between different stations. Because of the limited personnel, teams often come up with creative solutions to decrease pit stop times. For example, some teams employ an automatic front jack, which is placed in front of the car as it stops. Mechanics might also jump over the nose-cone of the car to save time getting to the other side. With the automatic front jack, a Super Formula pit stop takes between ten and twelve seconds; even without the automatic jack, pit stops can be completed in as little as fourteen seconds.

== Endurance racing ==
In the various forms of sports car endurance racing, pit stops are a more leisurely affair, but no less important than in other forms of racing. While stops take longer, much more routine maintenance is scheduled during such pit stops, needed to keep the car running for as long as twenty-four hours; this includes major aerodynamic changes to deal with the changing temperature in such a long race, and replacement of certain wear-limited parts, such as brake pads. Due to the fact that the race is scheduled to last a certain length of time rather than a specific distance, pit strategies are generally not designed to be synchronised with the race distance, but rather to happen on a schedule based on the car&#x27;s requirements for routine service.

Under the rules of the Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest (ACO) only five mechanics are permitted to work on the car. One man is permitted to fuel the car; all fuelling must be completed before any other service occurs. The other four mechanics on pit lane at any given time are typically two tyre changers and two tyre carriers, each of whom handles his task on only one side of the car. Automatic pneumatic jacks are used, integrated into the car itself. At all times the car&#x27;s engine must be shut off during the stop, and may start only when the stop has concluded.

IMSA allows only four mechanics to service a car during a pit stop. One crew member will refuel the car while the other three are responsible for changing tyres and operating the pneumatic jacks. A fifth crew-member must serve as the team&#x27;s designated firefighter and must stand ready in the pit stall with a fire extinguisher while the car is being refuelled. A sixth crew-member may assist in a driver change. Neither the firefighter or driver&#x27;s assistant may perform any additional service to the car. Unlike the ACO, IMSA does not force crews to wait for fuelling to complete before changing tyres, and does not require the car&#x27;s engine be shut off during the stop.

In endurance racing, driver changes are mandatory; the shortest endurance races are scheduled for four hours, one hour longer than the longest nonstop time permitted behind the wheel. During a pit stop with a driver change, the new driver and a driver change assistant are permitted into the pit lane. The assistant, who may not do any mechanical work on the car, is tasked with helping the current driver out of the car, removing or swapping driver seat inserts, helping the new driver into the car, and helping the new driver tightly fasten his safety harness and connect his various helmet connections to the car&#x27;s systems, including the two-way team radio and the drink bottle used to stave off dehydration.

A routine pit stop with no scheduled maintenance and no driver change generally lasts from thirty to forty seconds. With a driver change included, that time increases by about ten seconds. Should there be significant scheduled maintenance, such as changing brake pads, the stop can easily last well over a minute.

Unlike most other forms of racing, the practice of &quot;double-stinting&quot; or even &quot;triple-stinting&quot; tyres is commonplace in longer races; tyres hard enough to withstand the rigours of racing in the heat of the daytime may be so hard that they do not wear significantly during the nighttime hours. In a race where this is an issue, significant time can be gained by choosing to leave worn tyres on the car during the first stop after they were put on the car; if the temperature drops low enough, teams may even be able to go two pit stops without changing tyres.

== Notable pit stops ==

*1963 Daytona 500: Wood Brothers Racing developed choreographed pit stops to reduce the amount of time spent on pit road. Driver Tiny Lund spent so little time on pit road that he went on to win the race without changing his tyres once. For this, Wood Brothers Racing is often credited with inventing the modern pit stop.
*1965 Indianapolis 500: Wood Brothers Racing was invited by Ford to service the Lotus 38-Ford driven by Scottish Formula One driver Jim Clark. This brought their new concept of fast pit stops into open-wheel racing. Clark won the race with an average speed of 150.686 miles per hour (a new Indianapolis 500 record). This was Ford&#x27;s first win at Indianapolis.
*1976 Indianapolis 500: A world record was set for time taken in a pit-stop when Bobby Unser pitted in four seconds.
*1981 Daytona 500: During the final round of pit stops, Richard Petty&#x27;s crew called off a planned tyre change, and serviced fuel only. The lightning-fast stop put Petty back on the track in the lead, and he held off a shocked Bobby Allison for a record seventh Daytona 500 victory.
*1982 Indianapolis 500: Gordon Johncock and Rick Mears were running together on the track as they approached their final pit stops. Johncock&#x27;s crew saved time by giving him just enough fuel to finish the race, sending him out with an 11-second lead. The better-handling Mears closed the gap but ran out of laps as Johncock hung on to win by 0.16 seconds.
*1989 Portuguese Grand Prix: Nigel Mansell came in too fast and missed his pit box. He then reversed back to take his spot, and mechanics changed the tyres. Due to reversing in pit lane (as opposed to waiting for the mechanics to push him back), he was disqualified. He did not acknowledge the black flag, later collided with Ayrton Senna and was subsequently given a one-race suspension.
*1991 First Union 400: After an offseason of discussion at the end of the NASCAR season during the Atlanta Journal 500 when Melling Racing rear tyre changer Mike Rich was killed by Ricky Rudd&#x27;s car going out of control during a pit stop, NASCAR experimented with various rules on tyre changes in an attempt to prevent a similar incident from happening again. The first was to only allow tyre changes during green flag racing, with the first lap after the restart being assigned to cars that started in odd-numbered starting positions, and the second lap after restart for even-numbered starting positions. The rule was unpopular, and teams began to change tyres only for regularly scheduled times under the green flag. After the first five races, NASCAR experimented with a rule for the Valleydale Meats 500 in Bristol. The same odd–even rules were used for the first two laps of a pit stop under caution, with the cars starting double-file, with the odd cars on the inside and even cars on the outside. After more complaints, for the seventh race, at North Wilkesboro Speedway, NASCAR reverted to the rules prior to the 1990 crash, along with a new rule mandating a pit lane speed limit. By the middle of the 1990s, almost all motorsport began enforcing a pit lane speed limit.
*1991 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach: Michael Andretti&#x27;s pit service was complete as he passed by Emerson Fittipaldi, who began exiting his pit area. Fittipaldi was apparently unaware that Andretti was approaching, and as the two made wheel-to wheel contact Andretti&#x27;s car was launched into the air. Andretti&#x27;s damaged car slid into another pit stall, but, though very angry, he walked away uninjured. As this incident took place in the wake of the aforementioned First Union 400, this incident prompted CART to mandate pit lane speed limits.
*1991 Portuguese Grand Prix: Nigel Mansell lost a wheel instantly after making his stop. The mechanics put the wheel back on in the middle of pit road, and Mansell was disqualified for the second time in three years in the event.
*1993 European Grand Prix: On lap 57, Ayrton Senna came into the pit lane for a tyre change but aborted the stop and drove straight through instead. In the process, he ended up setting the fastest lap of the race, due to both the unique configuration of Donington Park&#x27;s pit lane, and the lack of pit lane speed limits in F1 at the time (which would be introduced the following year after Senna&#x27;s death).
*1993 Australian Grand Prix: McLaren&#x27;s Ayrton Senna came into the pit unexpectedly for new tyres; the team serviced the car in under four seconds.
*1994 San Marino Grand Prix: Michele Alboreto lost a wheel after his pit stop. The wheel caused injuries to mechanics from Ferrari and Lotus. Following this and other tragic events during the weekend, the pit lane speed limit was introduced in Formula One.
*1994 German Grand Prix: Benetton driver Jos Verstappen came into the pits; while refuelling, some fuel was accidentally sprayed onto the hot bodywork of the car – a few seconds later the fuel ignited and Verstappen&#x27;s car was engulfed in a ball of flames. Verstappen escaped the incident with burns around his eyes, as he had his visor up during the pit stop.
*1995 Spanish Grand Prix: Johnny Herbert exited his pit box with the rear jack still attached to his car. It fell off harmlessly at the pit lane exit.
*1996 24 Hours of Daytona: Max Papis was charging around the track on the final stint of the race, trying to catch the leader. On his final pit stop, Papis entered the pit area at full speed (~200 mph). Despite still finishing second, the startling sight helped earn him the name &quot;Mad Max.&quot; This is no longer possible, as almost all federations controlling motorsport have adopted pit lane speed limits because of crew safety.
*1998 British Grand Prix: Two laps from the finish, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher was issued a 10-second penalty. His team interpreted it as a requirement to drive through the pit lane without exceeding the speed limit, stop at a designated penalty area, and remain stationary for 10 seconds before returning to the track. While driving along the pit lane during the final lap, Schumacher crossed the finish line (which extended across the lane) before reaching the penalty area and before Mika Häkkinen could do so on the track. The penalty was later rescinded, and Schumacher was declared the winner.
*1999 Portland Grand Prix: Gil de Ferran was leading but had insufficient fuel to make it to the finish. Rather than try to conserve fuel, de Ferran&#x27;s Walker Racing team instructed him to drive all-out to build enough of a margin to make an extra pit stop. The strategy was a gamble as a yellow flag would bunch the field and wipe out any margin de Ferran built. The green flag stayed out, de Ferran pitted without losing the lead and he went on to take the team&#x27;s first win in four years.
*2001 24 Hours of Le Mans: Joest Racing changed the transaxle on their Audi R8 (a process that usually takes hours) in less than 5 minutes. They went on to win the overall race.
*2002 UAW-Daimler Chrysler 400: Sterling Marlin of Chip Ganassi Racing spun while attempting to make a late race pit stop, causing him to break the pit road speed limit. At the time, NASCAR&#x27;s penalty for speeding while entering pit road was to hold the driver in his pit stall for an additional 15 seconds. The official in Marlin&#x27;s pit was not informed of the penalty until after the crew released the car. NASCAR determined that they had no precedent for forcing Marlin to return to the pits as his early release was their mistake (and they could not order him back for a stop and go penalty). Marlin won the race by 1.163 seconds. Following the incident, NASCAR amended its rules so that all green flag speeding violations are enforced with a drive through penalty (forcing the driver to travel the length of pit road at the speed limit).
*2002 The Winston: Roush Racing&#x27;s Jeff Burton made a pit stop on the final lap of the first 40-lap segment. A pit stop for tyres was mandatory during the segment, but the rule did not stipulate when it had to be taken. By selecting a pit stall only 100 yards/metres shy of the start/finish line, Burton did not have to spend the time all the other drivers took traveling the entire length of pit road. Since Sprint All-Star Race XIX, the rule was modified to mandate the stop within a specific number of laps in the race.
*2008 Canadian Grand Prix: Ferrari&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen came to a stop at the end of the pit lane as the exit was closed, with the red indicator light on. Räikkönen was alongside BMW&#x27;s Robert Kubica at the end of the pit lane when Lewis Hamilton sped towards them not noticing the red light at first. Hamilton slid into the back of Räikkönen&#x27;s car, with Nico Rosberg further hitting the back of Hamilton. Both Hamilton and Räikkönen retired from the race, each leaving their vehicles at the exit of the pit lane. Both Hamilton and Rosberg were penalised a 10-place grid penalty at the next Grand Prix in France.
*2008 Singapore Grand Prix: Ferrari&#x27;s Felipe Massa drove off with the fuel hose still attached to the car knocking down a member of the pit crew while he attempted to head back to the track as he was mistakenly shown the green signal. The problem was later attributed to the failure of Ferrari&#x27;s automated light system. This being the first night race in F1, the Ferrari team subsequently resumed the use of the traditional lollipop man for the remainder of the season.
*2011 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: McLaren&#x27;s Lewis Hamilton entered the pit lane and had his service in 3.19 seconds followed seconds later by teammate Jenson Button having a 4-second pit stop.
*2012 Chinese Grand Prix: The Ferrari team completed a pit stop for Fernando Alonso in 2.4 seconds.
*2012 German Grand Prix: The McLaren team completed a pit stop for Jenson Button in 2.31 seconds.
*2013 Malaysian Grand Prix: McLaren&#x27;s previous record of 2.31 seconds was bettered six times during the course of the race, the fastest of which came from Infiniti Red Bull Racing&#x27;s pit stop for Mark Webber, completing the stop in 2.05 seconds. Lewis Hamilton also had a notable pit stop after accidentally driving his Mercedes car into the McLaren pits, after only moving from the team two races prior.
*2013 German Grand Prix: Mark Webber was released from the pit box before his right-rear wheel was properly fitted on. The tyre came loose as he drove down the pit lane and hit a cameraman. This led to increased pit lane safety measures being implemented, including mandatory head protection for all team members working on a car during a pit stop, a reduced pit lane speed limit, and restricted access for the media into the pit lane.
*2013 GoPro Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma: While exiting his pit stall, race contender Scott Dixon struck Will Power&#x27;s right rear tyre carrier, who was thrown into another pit crew member, while another member of Power&#x27;s crew was injured by an air gun. Dixon was penalised for the incident, but he believed the tyre carrier had intentionally walked in front of his car. Power would go on to win the race, while Dixon&#x27;s penalty relegated him to 21st, and a final finishing position of 15th.
*2013 Japanese Grand Prix: The Ferrari team completed a pit stop for Fernando Alonso in 1.95 seconds.
*2013 US Grand Prix: The Red Bull Racing Team completed a pit stop for Mark Webber which they timed at 1.923 seconds.
*2016 European Grand Prix: The Williams Team completed a pit stop for Felipe Massa in 1.92 seconds.
*2018 Australian Grand Prix: Kevin Magnussen, driving for Haas F1 Team, was released from the pit box before all wheels were properly fitted. Two laps later, his teammate Romain Grosjean was also released with a loose wheel, forcing both drivers to retire. Haas was fined €10,000 for the unsafe pit releases.
*2018 Bahrain Grand Prix: During Kimi Räikkönen&#x27;s second pit stop, his Ferrari struck tyre changer Francesco Cigarini&#x27;s left leg as it left the pit box, fracturing Cigarini&#x27;s tibia and fibula. The cause of the incident was a sensor confusion in the Ferrari pit box light system.
*2019 DXC Technology 600: Having led the race from pole position, Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing&#x27;s Takuma Sato entered the pits for his first stop at the end of lap 62 and overshot his pit box, hooking the inside air hoses and lollipop on his car and launching the inside front tire changer into the next pit box. The crewman was uninjured, but the lengthy pit stop and subsequent penalty for hitting pit equipment left Sato 3 laps down and out of contention.
*2019 British Grand Prix: The Red Bull Racing team completed a 1.91 pit stop for Pierre Gasly, making it the fourth fastest pit stop in F1 and overall.
*2019 German Grand Prix: The Red Bull Racing team completed a pit stop for Max Verstappen in 1.88 seconds, making it the third fastest pit stop in F1 and overall.
*2019 Brazilian Grand Prix: The Red Bull Racing team completed a pit stop for Max Verstappen in 1.82 seconds, making it the second fastest pit stop ever in F1 and overall.
*2021 Monaco Grand Prix: Valtteri Bottas of the Mercedes team was forced to retire from the race after his wheel could not be removed from the car due to a faulty wheel nut.
*2023 Qatar Grand Prix: The McLaren team completed a pit stop for Lando Norris in 1.80 seconds, making it the fastest pit stop ever in F1 and overall.

<doc id="893512" wikidata="Q219235" url="?curid=893512" title="Servette FC">
<text>Servette FC is a Swiss professional football club based in Geneva, founded in March 1890 with rugby as its first sporting activity, and named after the Geneva district of the same name. The football section was created on 17 January 1900. They play in the Swiss Super League.

Servette is one of Switzerland&#x27;s most successful clubs and the most successful Romandy club, winning 17 national titles, as well as 8 Swiss cups. Founded in 1890, the team has spent the majority of its history in the top flight of Swiss football, regularly contesting for the title. They are rivals with FC Lausanne-Sport and FC Sion.

However, after their last league title in 1999, Servette began experiencing financial problems, which led to a turbulent decade. The club was relegated to the third division in 2004–05 due to a bankruptcy, but achieved promotion to the Swiss Challenge League after the 2005–06 season, where the club remained until 2011. Servette earned promotion to the Swiss Super League after defeating Bellinzona in a relegation/promotion playoff on 31 May 2011. The club finished fourth in its first season back in the top flight, thereby gaining entrance to the Europa League second round qualification round for the 2012–13 season. However, they were relegated at the end of the 2013 season. They returned to the Swiss first tier in 2019, being promoted as Challenge League champions with a 15 points lead in front of the 2nd ranked FC Aarau.

Servette was also the winner of the Torneo Internazionale Stampa Sportiva, one of the first international football competitions in the world, in 1908. In 1930, Servette organized the Coupe des Nations, predecessor of the UEFA Champions League.

The club was originally founded as the &quot;Football Club de la Servette&quot;, a rugby football team based in the Genevan neighbourhood of the same name. Due to the dwindling popularity of this sport in Switzerland, a football section of the club was created, leading to its integration in the Swiss Football Association in 1900.

Led by Umberto Barberis and Claude &quot;Didi&quot; Andrey, in 1978–1979 the club won all of the competitions it entered – with the exception of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup where they were eliminated in the quarter-finals on away goals by Fortuna Düsseldorf, that year&#x27;s finalist. Barberis later became French champion in 1982 with AS Monaco.

Until its bankruptcy, Servette was the only Swiss club to have remained in the top league since its creation in 1890. Servette remained the only club to have never been relegated for sporting reasons, until they finished last in the 2012–2013 season.

=== Bankruptcy and revival ===

On 4 February 2005, the parent company of the club was declared bankrupt. It had run debts of over 10 million Swiss francs, having not paid the players since the previous November, and consequently the club suffered an exodus of players looking for paying clubs. As a consequence of the bankruptcy Servette Under 21s took over the club name playing two divisions below the original Servette team in 1. Liga, a fate already experienced by regional rivals Lausanne Sports in 2003, and continued to play at the Stade de Geneve in front of smaller crowds.

In the 2005–06 season, a rejuvenated Servette secured promotion to the Challenge League, the second highest division in Switzerland.

In the 2010–11 season, Servette finished 2nd in the Challenge League, thereby qualifying for a relegation/promotion play-off against Super League team AC Bellinzona. Servette lost the initial match in Bellinzona 1–0, but won the return match 3–1 and winning the tie 3–2 on aggregate, securing promotion to the Swiss Super League.

=== 2011 to 2018===
During the Summer 2011 transfer window, Servette FC made very few signings, considering the club had been promoted from the second division to the Super League. Barroca, Issaga Diallo, Carlos Saleiro and Abdoulaye Fall (the latter failed to receive a work permit) were signed as permanent transfers, in addition to Ishmael Yartey and Roderick Miranda joining the club on loan from Benfica. Costinha, a former Portugal international and Champions League winner with FC Porto, was appointed as the club&#x27;s Sporting Director, after he had been previously fired by Lisbon-based Sporting CP. With a largely unchanged squad from their previous season in the second division, Servette achieved very impressive results in the first half of the season, including victories over FC Zurich, BSC Young Boys, Neuchatel Xamax, FC Lucerne, local rivals FC Lausanne-Sport and a 4–0 away win over arch-rivals FC Sion. Despite achieving overall impressive results in the first half of the season, manager João Alves was fired, and was replaced by his compatriot João Pereira, to the disappointment of many of Servette&#x27;s supporters.

In December 2011, reports surfaced that Servette was unable to pay players&#x27; salaries, in addition to other expenses. In January 2012, one of the club&#x27;s star performers and leading goalscorers, Matías Vitkieviez, was sold to Young Boys for only 150,000 CHF. In February 2012, Servette filed for bankruptcy a second time. On 12 March 2012, chairman Majid Pishyar sold the club to a consortium headed by Hugh Quennec, president of the city&#x27;s hockey club, Genève-Servette HC. The club was initially given one month to secure the funding necessary to come out of bankruptcy proceedings, and was successful in doing so. Pishyar remained as &quot;honorary president&quot; through the end of the 2011–12 season.

In April 2012, the decision was made to reinstate manager João Alves, who had achieved promotion and impressive results in the first half of the season, and to fire his replacement João Pereira, who had failed to improve the club&#x27;s results. Alves&#x27; return immediately led to improved results, and the club finished the season&#x27;s final five matches with four wins and one draw. This included a 2–1 victory over FC Basel on the final day of the season, which ended a run of 17 consecutive losses against FC Basel dating back to 2001, as well as ending Basel&#x27;s 26 match unbeaten streak. The victory also meant that Servette secured fourth place in their first season back in Switzerland&#x27;s top flight, granting Servette entry into the second round of qualifying for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League. The season ended with further good news, as on 24 May 2012, the Swiss Football League granted Servette its license for the 2012–13 season, thus marking the end of Servette&#x27;s financial worries for the time being.

Servette announced that it would be preparing for the 2012–13 season with friendly matches against Thun, Shakhtar Donetsk, Yverdon-Sport, Étoile Carouge, Lausanne-Sport and Porto. In the transfer market, Servette sold Stéphane Nater and Carlos Saleiro, while Ishmael Yartey and Roderick Miranda were recalled to Benfica from their loan spells. Servette bolstered its ranks by signing Geoffrey Tréand, Alexandre Pasche, Christopher Mfuyi, Kevin Gissi, Simone Grippo, Mike Gomes, and Samir Ramizi. Servette also brought in Genséric Kusunga, Steven Lang, and Kelvin on loan for the season.

On 12 July 2012, it was confirmed that Servette would face Gandzasar FC in the second round of qualifying for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League. The club won the tie 5–1, progressing to face Rosenborg BK in the third qualifier round, against whom they were eliminated on away goals. Servette&#x27;s league campaign, meanwhile, went poorly, and the club was relegated (for sporting reasons) for the first time in its 113-year history in May 2013, following a 3–0 away defeat by relegation rivals FC Lausanne-Sport.

On 14 July 2013, Servette began the 2013–14 season in the Swiss Challenge League with a 2–1 win at FC Wohlen.

After finishing 2nd in the 2014–15 Swiss Challenge League, the Swiss Football League refused Servette FC a Challenge League licence meaning that Servette would play in the 1st Promotion League (third tier) during 2015–16. In June 2015 the club held a press conference where it was revealed that Servette FC had new owners – 1890 Foundation – holding 100% of the capital stock of SFC SA. At the same press conference it was declared that 1890 Foundation was a private foundation subject to scrutiny by the public supervisory authority.

While Kevin Cooper stayed on as coach, many players left. On 3 November 2015, Servette FC announced that Kevin Cooper had left the club and William Niederhauser and Thierry Cotting would be temporarily in charge of first team affairs. In January 2016 the club announced that Anthony Braizat had taken charge of first team affairs.

===2018 to present===

In 2018, Servette hired Alain Geiger as its manager and achieved promotion back to the Swiss Super League as the 2018–2019 Challenge League champions, with a 15-point lead in front of 2nd ranked FC Aarau. For the first time in more than 15 years, the club has since enjoyed relative stability at the financial, managerial and sport levels, achieving a 4th-place finish in the 2019–2020 Super League, a 3rd place in 2020–2021, a 6th place in 2021–2022 and even a 2nd place in 2022–2023, giving it for the first time a shot for the Champions League.

On 20 March 2023, Servette announced that the current season would be Geiger&#x27;s last, with René Weiler being chosen to take over for the 2023–2024 season. Weiler led Servette to their first Swiss Cup final since 2001. On 2 June 2024, Servette won the cup final after a penalty shoot-out against FC Lugano, winning their first title in 23 years.

On 10 June 2024, the club announced a new organizational structure, with Weiler stepping down as head coach and instead taking over as sporting director. He is replaced by Thomas Häberli as head coach. Hervé Boch will be the new chairman.

== Stadium ==
The home ground of Servette is the Stade de Genève. It was inaugurated on 16 March 2003 after three years of construction. The opening match was played between Servette and Young Boys. With an all-seater capacity of 30,084, the Stade de Genève is the third largest stadium in Switzerland, and hosted three group matches in the 2008 European Football Championship.

Servette moved to the Stade de Genève from their old ground, the Stade des Charmilles, in 2003. The Charmilles was inaugurated on 28 June 1930, with the first game drawing a crowd of 14,000 on the first match of the Coupe des Nations. The official capacity peaked at 30,000, but a record 40,000 spectators managed to squeeze in for the international game between Switzerland and France on 14 October 1951. Flood lights were installed in 1977 and the stands were entirely covered in 1983. The capacity gradually diminished from the 1980s onward, first to 20,000 in 1985 and then to 9,250 in 1998 when the stadium became an all-seater.

Plans for a new stadium were first launched in 1984, in response to the Charmilles becoming increasingly outdated and run down. A project committee was established in 1992, which proposed to either rebuild the stadium over the course of four years or construct a new stadium elsewhere in Geneva. Meanwhile, with more substantial plans failing to materialize, the poor state of the old stadium became apparent when the main stand, the &quot;Tribune A&quot;, was declared unsafe in 1995 and closed off. A renovation project began the following year, which saw the main stand re-opened and seats eventually being installed throughout the stadium. Servette would secure another Swiss Championship and a Cup trophy while playing at the Charmilles, before construction on the new Stade de Genève finally commenced in 2000. The last match was played on 8 December 2002 in front of a capacity crowd.

<text>Tour Saint-Jacques (, &#x27;Saint James&#x27;s Tower&#x27;) is a monument located in the 4th arrondissement of Paris, France, on the Rive Droite. This Flamboyant Gothic tower at the intersection of the Rue de Rivoli with Rue Nicolas-Flamel is all that remains of the former 16th-century Church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie (&#x27;Saint James of the Meat Market&#x27;), which was demolished in 1797, during the French Revolution, leaving only the tower.

What remains of the destroyed church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie is now considered a national historic landmark.

==History==
===The Way of St James===

The tower&#x27;s rich decoration reflects the wealth of its patrons, the wholesale butchers of the nearby Les Halles market. The masons in charge were Jean de Felin, Julien Ménart and Jean de Revier. It was built in 1509 to 1523, during the reign of King Francis I. With a dedication to Saint James the Greater, the ancient church and its landmark tower welcomed pilgrims setting out on the road that led to Tours and headed for the Way of St James, which led to the major pilgrimage destination of Santiago de Compostela. A relic of the saint preserved in the church linked it the more strongly and in modern times occasioned its listing in 1998 as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO among the sites and structures marking the &quot;chemins de Compostelle&quot;, the pilgrimage routes in France that led like tributaries of a great stream headed towards Santiago in the northwest of Spain.

===19th century===

The church, with the exception of the tower, was demolished in 1793; preservation of the tower was a condition of the contract by which the church was bought for the value of its building materials. In 1824 it was being used as a shot tower to make small shot. It was repurchased by the City of Paris in 1836 and declared a &quot;monument historique&quot; in 1862. A statue of the saint was installed on the top of the tower during the 19th century.

During the Second Empire, the architect Théodore Ballu restored the tower, placing it on a pedestal and designing a small city park around it. This coincided with the construction of the Rue de Rivoli and Avenue Victoria nearby, requiring huge quantities of earth to be removed to ensure the Rue de Rivoli a smooth flat path. The pedestal allowed the tower to retain its original elevation: nowadays, the change in ground level can best be appreciated in Rue Saint-Bon, just northeast of the tower, where a staircase leads up to the original street level at the Rue de la Verrerie.

A statue of Blaise Pascal is located at the base of the tower, commemorating the experiments on atmospheric pressure, though it is debated whether they were performed here or at the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. A meteorological laboratory is also installed at the top of the tower.

The tower inspired Alexandre Dumas to write the play &quot;La tour Saint-Jacques-de-la-boucherie&quot; in 1856.
Nicolas Flamel, reputedly an alchemist and a patron of the church, was buried under its floor.

===Modern restoration===
The tower was surrounded by scaffolding and obscured by sheeting for some years as surveyors investigated the condition of the stone. Recent findings show that most of the stone and its ornamentation originates from the late-medieval era of the tower&#x27;s construction, and was not added by the 19th-century restorers. Unfortunately, the survey also indicates serious cracking. The top three quarters of sheeting were taken down in March 2008, revealing a renovated upper section of the tower. From October 2008 to February 2009, the scaffolds and sheeting were completely removed and the surrounding park&#x27;s landscaping was being restored. Finally, on 18 April 2009, the park was re-opened to the public.

<doc id="893516" wikidata="Q3010804" url="?curid=893516" title="Core (group theory)">
<text>In group theory, a branch of mathematics, a core is any of certain special normal subgroups of a group. The two most common types are the normal core of a subgroup and the &quot;p&quot;-core of a group.

==The normal core==
===Definition===
For a group &quot;G&quot;, the normal core or normal interior of a subgroup &quot;H&quot; is the largest normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot; that is contained in &quot;H&quot; (or equivalently, the intersection of the conjugates of &quot;H&quot;). More generally, the core of &quot;H&quot; with respect to a subset &quot;S&quot; ⊆ &quot;G&quot; is the intersection of the conjugates of &quot;H&quot; under &quot;S&quot;, i.e.
:formula_1

Under this more general definition, the normal core is the core with respect to &quot;S&quot; = &quot;G&quot;. The normal core of any normal subgroup is the subgroup itself.

===Significance===
Normal cores are important in the context of group actions on sets, where the normal core of the isotropy subgroup of any point acts as the identity on its entire orbit. Thus, in case the action is transitive, the normal core of any isotropy subgroup is precisely the kernel of the action.
A core-free subgroup is a subgroup whose normal core is the trivial subgroup. Equivalently, it is a subgroup that occurs as the isotropy subgroup of a transitive, faithful group action.

The solution for the hidden subgroup problem in the abelian case generalizes to finding the normal core in case of subgroups of arbitrary groups.

==The &quot;p&quot;-core==

In this section &quot;G&quot; will denote a finite group, though some aspects generalize to locally finite groups and to profinite groups.

===Definition===
For a prime &quot;p&quot;, the p&quot;-core of a finite group is defined to be its largest normal &quot;p&quot;-subgroup. It is the normal core of every Sylow p-subgroup of the group. The &quot;p&quot;-core of &quot;G&quot; is often denoted formula_2, and in particular appears in one of the definitions of the Fitting subgroup of a finite group. Similarly, the p&quot;′-core is the largest normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot; whose order is coprime to &quot;p&quot; and is denoted formula_3. In the area of finite insoluble groups, including the classification of finite simple groups, the 2′-core is often called simply the core and denoted formula_4. This causes only a small amount of confusion, because one can usually distinguish between the core of a group and the core of a subgroup within a group. The &quot;p&quot;′,&quot;p&quot;-core, denoted formula_5 is defined by formula_6. For a finite group, the &quot;p&quot;′,&quot;p&quot;-core is the unique largest normal &quot;p&quot;-nilpotent subgroup.

The &quot;p&quot;-core can also be defined as the unique largest subnormal &quot;p&quot;-subgroup; the &quot;p&quot;′-core as the unique largest subnormal &quot;p&quot;′-subgroup; and the &quot;p&quot;′,&quot;p&quot;-core as the unique largest subnormal &quot;p&quot;-nilpotent subgroup.

The &quot;p&quot;′ and &quot;p&quot;′,&quot;p&quot;-core begin the upper &quot;p&quot;-series. For sets &quot;π&quot;1, &quot;π&quot;2, ..., &quot;π&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 of primes, one defines subgroups O&quot;π&quot;1, &quot;π&quot;2, ..., &quot;π&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1(&quot;G&quot;) by:
:formula_7
The upper &quot;p&quot;-series is formed by taking &quot;π&quot;2&quot;i&quot;−1 = &quot;p&quot;′ and &quot;π&quot;2&quot;i&quot; = &quot;p;&quot; there is also a lower &quot;p&quot;-series. A finite group is said to be p&quot;-nilpotent if and only if it is equal to its own &quot;p&quot;′,&quot;p&quot;-core. A finite group is said to be p&quot;-soluble if and only if it is equal to some term of its upper &quot;p&quot;-series; its &quot;p&quot;-length is the length of its upper &quot;p&quot;-series. A finite group &quot;G&quot; is said to be p-constrained for a prime &quot;p&quot; if formula_8.

Every nilpotent group is &quot;p&quot;-nilpotent, and every &quot;p&quot;-nilpotent group is &quot;p&quot;-soluble. Every soluble group is &quot;p&quot;-soluble, and every &quot;p&quot;-soluble group is &quot;p&quot;-constrained. A group is &quot;p&quot;-nilpotent if and only if it has a normal &quot;p&quot;-complement, which is just its &quot;p&quot;′-core.

===Significance===
Just as normal cores are important for group actions on sets, &quot;p&quot;-cores and &quot;p&quot;′-cores are important in modular representation theory, which studies the actions of groups on vector spaces. The &quot;p&quot;-core of a finite group is the intersection of the kernels of the irreducible representations over any field of characteristic &quot;p&quot;. For a finite group, the &quot;p&quot;′-core is the intersection of the kernels of the ordinary (complex) irreducible representations that lie in the principal &quot;p&quot;-block. For a finite group, the &quot;p&quot;′,&quot;p&quot;-core is the intersection of the kernels of the irreducible representations in the principal &quot;p&quot;-block over any field of characteristic &quot;p&quot;. Also, for a finite group, the &quot;p&quot;′,&quot;p&quot;-core is the intersection of the centralizers of the abelian chief factors whose order is divisible by &quot;p&quot; (all of which are irreducible representations over a field of size &quot;p&quot; lying in the principal block). For a finite, &quot;p&quot;-constrained group, an irreducible module over a field of characteristic &quot;p&quot; lies in the principal block if and only if the &quot;p&quot;′-core of the group is contained in the kernel of the representation.

===Solvable radicals===
A related subgroup in concept and notation is the solvable radical. The solvable radical is defined to be the largest solvable normal subgroup, and is denoted formula_9. There is some variance in the literature in defining the &quot;p&quot;′-core of &quot;G&quot;. A few authors in only a few papers (for instance John G. Thompson&#x27;s N-group papers, but not his later work) define the &quot;p&quot;′-core of an insoluble group &quot;G&quot; as the &quot;p&quot;′-core of its solvable radical in order to better mimic properties of the 2′-core.

<text>The Ordre des traducteurs, terminologues et interprètes agréés du Québec (OTTIAQ) is a professional order representing translators, terminologists and interpreters in Quebec. As a professional order, the OTTIAQ provides its members with a &quot;reserved title&quot;: Certified Translator (C. Tr.), or, in French, &quot;traducteur agréé (trad. a.)&quot;; Certified Terminologist (C. Term.), or, in French, &quot;terminologue agréé (term. a.)&quot;; and Certified Interpreter (C. Int.), or, in French, &quot;interprète agréé (int. a.)&quot;.

OTTIAQ&#x27;s goals include providing information and training for members, and thereby promoting the advancement and raising the profile of the three professions of its members.

==History==
OTTIAQ can trace its history back to 1940, when the Société des traducteurs du Québec (STQ) was founded (letters patent granted in 1943), making it the oldest association of its type in the province.

In 1968 the STQ merged with the &quot;Cercle des traducteurs&quot; and the &quot;Corporation des traducteurs professionnels du Québec&quot;. On April 1, 1992 the STQ became the Corporation professionnelle des traducteurs et interprètes agréés du Québec (CPTIAQ) and on October 15, 1994, in compliance with the Act to amend the Professional Code and other Acts respecting the professions, the Corporation changed its name to the Ordre des traducteurs et interprètes agréés du Québec (OTIAQ).

On July 12, 2000 the National Assembly of Quebec unanimously approved the addition of the title &quot;terminologues&quot; to its name and OTIAQ officially became the Ordre des traducteurs, terminologues et interprètes agréés du Québec. On September 11, 2000 the Board adopted a resolution approving the modified acronym, OTTIAQ. 

On June 11, 2012, OTTIAQ withdrew from the Canadian Translators, Terminologists and Interpreters Council.

<text>An ecclesiastical new moon is the first day of a lunar month (an ecclesiastical moon) in an ecclesiastical lunar calendar. Such months have a whole number of days, 29 or 30, whereas true synodic months can vary from about 29.27 to 29.83 days in length. Medieval authors equated the ecclesiastical new moon with a new crescent moon, but it is not a phase of the true moon. If the ecclesiastical lunar calendar is accurate, the ecclesiastical new moon can be any day from the day of the astronomical new moon or dark moon to two days later (see table). The ecclesiastical calendar valid for the Julian and Gregorian calendar are described in detail by Grotefend, Ginzel and in the Explanatory Supplement to The Astronomical Ephemeris.

The ecclesiastical new moon which falls on or next after March 8 is of special importance, since it is the paschal new moon that begins the paschal lunar month (see table). The fourteenth day of the same lunar month is the first of the calendar year to occur on or next after March 21. This fourteenth day was called the &quot;paschal full moon&quot; by medieval computists. Easter is the following Sunday.

Calendar pages in medieval liturgical books indicated the ecclesiastical new moons by writing the Golden Number to the left of the day of the month on which the ecclesiastical new moon would occur in the year of that Golden Number. In some places the age of the moon was announced daily in the office of Prime at the reading of the martyrology. 

When in the 13th century Roger Bacon complained about the discrepancy between the ecclesiastical moon and the observed lunar phases, he specifically mentioned the discrepancy involving the ecclesiastical new moon 
&quot;Quilibet computista novit quod fallit primatio per tres dies vel quatuor his temporibus; et quilibet rusticus potest in coelo hunc errorem contemplari.&quot; (Any computist knows that the prime [of the moon] is off by three or four days in our time; and any rustic can see this error in the sky.)

These complaints were finally addressed by the construction of the Gregorian calendar. 

A check can be made on the difference between the astronomical new moon and the ecclesiastical new moon. The following table gives a comparison for 2010. All times are Greenwich Mean Time. Coordinated Universal Time is the same with a tolerance of 0.9 seconds either way.

The long term accuracy of the Gregorian ecclesiastical lunar calendar is remarkable. It will be in error by one day in about 73 500 years while the error with respect to the tropical year will be one day in about 3320 years.

The following table gives the ecclesiastical new moon used for determining Easter (in the Gregorian system) for a range of years.
