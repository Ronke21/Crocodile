<text>Malachy (; ; Modern ; ) (1094 – 2 November 1148) is an Irish saint who was Archbishop of Armagh, to whom were attributed several miracles and an alleged vision of 112 popes later attributed to the apocryphal (i.e. of doubtful authenticity) Prophecy of the Popes.

Malachy was the first native-born Irish saint to be formally canonised. His brother was Gilla Críst Ua Morgair, who was Bishop Christian of Clogher from 1126 to 1138.

==Life==
Máel Máedóc, whose surname was Ua Morgair, was born in Armagh in 1094. Bernard of Clairvaux describes him as having noble birth. He was baptised Máel Máedóc, meaning &#x27;devotee or servant&#x27; of Máedóc (Máedóc of Ferns) which was rendered &quot;Malachus&quot; in Latin (and subsequently as &quot;Malachy&quot; in English) and was trained under the famous recluse Imhar O&#x27;Hagan, subsequently Abbot of Armagh. Imhar was in sympathy with the aims of those who sought to reform the Irish church, and it was probably through his influence that Malachy became imbued with their principles. After a long course of studies, Malachy was ordained priest by Cellach of Armagh (Celsus) in 1119.

Shortly afterwards Cellach made the young priest his vicar. For the next year or two it was Malachy&#x27;s duty to administer the diocese of Armagh. He established in all the churches the apostolic sanctions and the decrees of the holy fathers, and the customs and practices of the Roman Church. With the consent of Cellach and Imar, he went to study under Máel Ísu Ua hAinmere (Malchus, first Bishop of the Norse city of Waterford), who had by this time retired from the archbishopric of Cashel and was settled at Lismore. He spent three years there.

==Abbot of Bangor==
In 1123 the coarb of Bangor Abbey died. Bangor was the principal religious site in the north-east of Ireland. Since he ended his days at Lismore, it may be assumed that he was a friend of Malchus, and of the movement with which he was identified. His successor, who was Malachy&#x27;s uncle, expressed his willingness to surrender his office and the site of the monastery to his nephew. Malachy became Abbot of Bangor Abbey.

This became an opportunity to implement one of the canons of the Synod of Rathbreasail, by establishing the diocese of Connor. Cellach, as coarb of Patrick, and consecrated bishop, had been able to organize the diocese of Armagh in accordance with the Rathbreasail plan. With the prestige which belonged to the coarb of Comgall, Malachy, if consecrated bishop, could probably succeed in organizing the diocese of Connor. In 1124 Malachy journeyed to Bangor, was installed as abbot, and was made bishop by Cellach.

In 1132, he was promoted to the primacy of Armagh.

Bernard provides many interesting anecdotes regarding Malachy and highly praises Malachy&#x27;s zeal for religion both in Connor and Armagh. In 1127, Malachy paid a second visit to Lismore and acted for a time as confessor to Cormac MacCarthy, Prince of Desmond. While Bishop of Down and Connor, Malachy continued to reside at Bangor, and when some of the native princes sacked the two dioceses of Down and Connor, Malachy brought the Bangor monks to Iveragh, County Kerry, where they were welcomed by now King Cormac. On the death of Celsus (who was buried at Lismore in 1129), Malachy was appointed Archbishop of Armagh, in 1132, which dignity he accepted with great reluctance. Owing to intrigues, he was unable to take possession of his See for two years; even then he had to purchase the Bachal Isu (Staff of Jesus) from Niall, the usurping lay-primate.

Malachy&#x27;s influence in Irish ecclesiastical affairs has been compared with that of Boniface in Germany. During three years at Armagh, as Bernard of Clairvaux writes, Malachy restored the discipline of the church, grown lax during the intruded rule of a series of lay-abbots, and had the Roman Liturgy adopted. Malachy worked zealously to restore ecclesiastical discipline, restored marriage, renewed the practices of confession and confirmation, and introduced Roman chants in the liturgy. He was also known for his care to the needy as a miracle worker and healer. In his lifetime, he planted apple trees throughout Ireland during times of famine.

Bernard continues: Having extirpated barbarism and re-established Christian morals, and seeing all things tranquil, Malachy began to think of his own peace. He, therefore, resigned the Sees of Armagh and Connor, in 1136 or 1137, but retained as Bishop of Down. He founded a priory of Austin Canons at Downpatrick, and was unceasing in his episcopal labours. Early in 1139 he journeyed to Rome, via Scotland, England, and France, visiting Bernard at Clairvaux, Champagne. He petitioned Pope Innocent II for pallia for the Sees of Armagh and Cashel, and was appointed legate for Ireland. On his return visit to Clairvaux, he obtained five monks for a foundation in Ireland, under Christian, an Irishman, as superior: thus arose the great Abbey of Mellifont in 1142. Malachy set out on a second journey to Rome in 1148, but on arriving at Clairvaux, he fell sick and died in the arms of Bernard, on 2 November 1148.

==Veneration==

In the book &quot;Life of Saint Malachy&quot;, his biographer Bernard of Clairvaux says Malachy was distinguished by his meekness, humility, obedience, modesty, and true diligence in his studies. Charles Borromeo praised Malachy for attending to the needy, bringing the holy sacraments to all alike and renewing the fervour of the people in receiving them.

Malachy&#x27;s feast is celebrated on 3 November, so as not to clash with All Souls Day.

==Visio Tnugdali==

The Visio Tnugdali written c.1149 refers to Malachy as follows- &quot;When Saint Ruadan had fallen silent, Tundale looked happily about him and saw Saint Patrick of Ireland, dressed in shining robes alongside many bishops decked out in their finest regalia. They were all joyful and there was no sound of any sighing! Among that blessed company Tundale could see four bishops whom he recognised. They were all good men; one of them was Saint Cellach, a former archbishop of Armagh, who did much good for the sake of Our Lord. Another was Malachias O&#x27;Moore, who had become archbishop of Armagh after him and gave everything that he had to the poor. He founded a large number of churches and colleges, as many as forty-four in all, endowed them with land and rents and so allowed many men of religion to serve God devotedly, although he hardly retained enough for himself to live on.&quot;

==Relics==

Malachy&#x27;s body remained at Clairvaux Abbey and eventually was placed in a tomb near Bernard of Clairvaux&#x27;s, after the abbot&#x27;s own death. The tomb was moved several times with the rebuilding of the church. Portions of his remains were sent to Ireland in 1194 and deposited at Mellifont Abbey and other abbeys of the Cistercians. At some point at Clairvaux, part of Malachy&#x27;s arm and part of his skull were removed and placed in special reliquaries in the abbey&#x27;s treasury. His arm was kept in a silver case decorated with precious stones. A portion of his skull was kept in a bust reliquary of gilt silver, also decorated with precious stones and topped by a mitre. These reliquaries may have been enamelled or painted. During the French Revolution, the reliquaries themselves were destroyed, although the relics were preserved. Malachy&#x27;s head is now preserved in a reliquary in the treasury of Troyes Cathedral, not far from the site of Clairvaux. The tombs of the two friends were destroyed in the aftermath of the revolution, and the bones were commingled and distributed to various parishes in the district of Clairvaux. Ph. Guignard published an account of the relics in the &quot;Patrologia Latina.&quot;

==Patronage==

Malachy is patron saint of the Archdiocese of Armagh and the Diocese of Down and Connor. The Dominican Abbey at Carlingford (est. 1305) was dedicated to him and his legacy. Saint Malachy&#x27;s Church, Belfast was intended to be the Cathedral Church of Down and Connor dedicated in honour of the Diocesan Patron. However, the Irish Famine broke out and the grand plans for Saint Malachy&#x27;s Cathedral were shelved to divert funds to the needy.

A number of parishes are dedicated to Malachy, including those in Tehachapi, California; Brownsburg, Indiana; Burlington, Massachusetts; Kennedy Township, New York City (The Actors&#x27; Chapel); Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Geneseo, Illinois and Rantoul, Illinois.

==Prophecy of the Popes==

A &quot;Prophecy of the Popes&quot; is attributed to Malachy, which is claimed to predict that there would be only 112 more popes before the Last Judgment. Benedictine Arnold de Wyon discovered and published the so-called &quot;Doomsday Prophecy&quot; in 1590. Most scholars consider the document a 16th-century elaborate hoax. James Weiss, a professor of church history at Boston College, has stated: &quot;It is widely thought ... given who the author was and his relationship, [that the prophecies] were published to establish the case for election of one particular cardinal.&quot; Thomas Groome, chair of the Department of Religious Education and Pastoral Ministry at Boston College, has a similar notion: &quot;For myself – and even as a native Irishman – the &#x27;Prophecies of St. Malachy&#x27; are a grand old fun tale that have about as much reliability as the morning horoscope&quot;. Thomas J. Reese of Georgetown University, had only this to say: &quot;St. Malachy&#x27;s prophecy is nonsense.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Malachy, his &quot;Doomsday Prophecy&quot;, and the conflicts between the Christians and pagans are important plot points in James Rollins&#x27; sixth Sigma Force novel, &quot;The Doomsday Key&quot; (2009), particularly in Chapter 21.

<text>A poorhouse or workhouse is a government-run (usually by a county or municipality) facility to support and provide housing for the dependent or needy.

==Workhouses==
In England, Wales and Ireland (but not in Scotland), &quot;workhouse&quot; has been the more common term. Before the introduction of the Poor Laws, each parish would maintain its own workhouse; often these would be simple farms with the occupants dividing their time between working the farm and being employed on maintaining local roads and other parish works. An example of one such is Strand House in East Sussex. In the early Victorian era (see Poor Law), poverty was seen as a dishonourable state. As depicted by Charles Dickens, a workhouse could resemble a reformatory, often housing whole families, or a penal labour regime giving manual work to the indigent and subjecting them to physical punishment. At many workhouses, men and women were split up with no communication between them. Furthermore, these workhouse systems were instituted under the &quot;Poor Law Amendment Act 1834&quot;: The United Kingdom passed this act to attempt to cut expenditure on those in poverty, reduce the number of beggars on the street, and inspire lower-class people to work harder in order to better provide for themselves.

==Poor farms==

=== United States ===
In the United States, poorhouses were most common during the 19th and early 20th centuries. They were often situated on the grounds of a poor farm on which able-bodied residents were required to work. A poorhouse could even be part of the same economic complex as a prison farm and other penal or charitable public institutions. Poor farms were county- or town-run residences where paupers (mainly elderly and disabled people) were supported at public expense. They were generally under the direction of one or more elected or appointed &quot;Superintendent[s] of the Poor.&quot;

Most were working farms that produced at least some of the produce, grain, and livestock they consumed. Residents were expected to provide labor to the extent that their health would allow, both in the fields and in providing housekeeping and care for other residents. Rules were strict and accommodations minimal.

Poor farms were based on the U.S. tradition of county governments (rather than cities, townships, or state or federal governments) providing social services for the needy within their borders. Following the 1854 veto of the Bill for the Benefit of the Indigent Insane by Franklin Pierce, the federal government did not participate in social welfare for over 70 years.

The poor farms declined in the U.S. after the &quot;Social Security Act&quot; took effect in 1935, with most disappearing completely by about 1950. Since the 1970s, funding for the care, well-being and safety of the poor and indigent is now split among county, state and federal resources. Poor farms have been replaced by subsidized housing such as public housing projects, Section 8 housing and homeless shelters.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the poorhouse, with an attached farm, was the favoured model. According to a 2009 report by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, &quot;pauperism was considered a moral failing that could be erased through order and hard work&quot;. The oldest government-supported facility of this type that is still standing (now a museum), is located in the Southwestern-Ontarian hamlet of Aboyne between the larger, nearby communities of Fergus and Elora. The Wellington County House of Industry and Refuge was opened in 1877 and, over the years, housed approximately 1500 deserving poor, including those who were destitute, old and infirm, or disabled. The 60-bed house for inmates was surrounded by a 30-acre industrial farm with a barn for livestock that produced some of the food for the 70 residents and the staff and also provided work for them. Others worked in the House itself. A hospital was added in 1892. The nearby cemetery has 271 plots. In 1947, the House was converted into a home for the aged and in 1975 the building reopened as the Wellington County Museum and Archives, one of the National Historic Sites of Canada.

<doc id="873759" wikidata="Q1701845" url="?curid=873759" title="John Stoughton Newberry">
<text>John Stoughton Newberry (November 18, 1826 – January 2, 1887) was an American industrialist and politician. He served as the first provost marshal for the State of Michigan and as a U.S. Representative from the state of Michigan.

==Early life==
Newberry was born in Waterville, New York, the son of Elihu Newberry and Rhoda (Phelps) Newberry. He moved with his parents to Michigan when a child, residing in Detroit, Ann Arbor, and Romeo. He completed preparatory studies at Romeo Academy and graduated from the University of Michigan in 1848 as head of his class. Under the influence of his uncle, Oliver Newberry, he spent two years in civil engineering working with the Michigan Central Railroad building the line from Kalamazoo to New Buffalo. Then he takes a year off traveling mostly by steamboat throughout the Midwest including the Great Lakes, The Ohio, Missouri and Mississippi rivers. While traveling, he is shocked by the number of boat accidents due to the lack of established standards and regulations. Consequently there are a number of expensive, extensive and complicated liability suits.

Upon his return Newberry abandons any more immediate railroad work in favor of studying maritime law in the Detroit law offices of Emmons and Van Dyke. In no time he becomes the acknowledged Midwestern maritime expert, publishing Reports of Admiralty Cases in the Several District Courts of the United States. Newberry wins his first important case, defending Captain Sam Ward, owner of the Ogdenburg, in his case against the Atlantic. He proves himself as the paramount admiralty law litigator in the Midwest and establishes his own law practice in Detroit. While in Buffalo on legal matters, he meets Harriet Newell Robinson, whom he weds in 1856. A son, Harrie, is born the same year. Tragically, ten days later, his wife of less than a year dies. He moved to a downtown hotel and played with the Detroit Base Ball Club for a short time.
Three years later while on business in Cleveland, Newberry meets Helen Parmelee Handy, the daughter of prominent banker, Truman Handy. Marrying in 1859, they return to Detroit. Two sons, Truman Handy and John Stoughton Jr., and one daughter, Helen Hall, are born to that union.

==Career==
He published the first volume of admiralty reports of decisions of cases arising on western lakes and rivers. In the early 1860s, Newberry joined the railroad car manufacturing firm of Dean and Eaton, renaming it Newberry, Dean and Eaton Manufacturing Co. When James McMillan joined the firm in 1864, the company was reorganized as the Michigan Car Company. With McMillan, Newberry also established the Detroit Car Wheel Company. He was appointed the first provost marshal for the State of Michigan by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln in 1862 with the rank of captain of Cavalry. Newberry resigned in 1864 and engaged in several large manufacturing and railroad enterprises.

Newberry was elected as a Republican candidate to the 46th United States Congress, serving Michigan&#x27;s 1st congressional district from March 4, 1879, to March 3, 1881. He declined to be a candidate for reelection in 1880. He served as director of The Detroit and Cleveland Steam Navigation Company, Detroit, Bay City and Alpena Railroad and the Detroit National Bank.

==Death and legacy==
Newberry died in Detroit on January 2, 1887, and was interred in Elmwood Cemetery. His funeral was the occasion for many tributes, but the one offered by his old Romeo friend and university classmate was probably the best. Judge J. Logan Chipman eulogized, &quot;With Mr. Newberry, as with all great men, there was indomitable will, energy, the great iron power that characterized his whole life.&quot; His estate was worth approximately $4.5 million, with investments in more than fifty different companies. To charitable organizations, he left $650,000.

The village of Newberry, Michigan, is named after Newberry, as a consequence of the congressman&#x27;s business interest in the Detroit, Mackinac and Marquette Railroad. Several streets within the Village were named after members of Newberry&#x27;s family.

An impressive Romanesque building was built from native fieldstone on the campus of the University of Michigan between 1888 and 1891. Nearly half of the building&#x27;s cost was covered by a gift from Helen H. Newberry, and in recognition the building was named Newberry Hall in honor of her husband.

The landmark Newberry Memorial Organ was constructed in his honor at Yale University, where his son Truman graduated in 1885.

==Family life==
Newberry was the nephew of Walter Loomis Newberry and Oliver Newberry.

Newberry was married in 1855 to Harriet N. Robinson. She died the following year, 10 days after giving birth to their son Harrie R. Newberry. On October 6, 1859, he married Helen P. Handy, the daughter of Truman P. Handy, a well-known financier and banker in Cleveland. They had three children, Truman Handy Newberry, John S. Newberry and Helen H. Newberry. His daughter was married to Henry Bourne Joy, President of the Packard Motor Car Company.

<doc id="873760" wikidata="Q1751729" url="?curid=873760" title="Scoubidou">
<text>Scoubidou (Craftlace, scoobies, lanyard, gimp, or boondoggle) is material used in knotting craft. It originated in France, where it became a fad in the late 1950s and has remained popular. It is named after the 1958 song of the same name as sung by the French singer Sacha Distel.

Scoubidou returned to fashion in various countries in the 1980s, and later in 2004 and 2005. It uses commercially supplied plastic strips or tubes.

==Thread==

The most common kind of thread used for the craft is flat and comes in many colors, sometimes called &quot;lanyard&quot; or &quot;gimp thread&quot;, often depending on region. Another kind of scoubidou thread is supple, round, and hollow plasticized PVC tubes usually about 80 centimetres in length. They are sold in various colors, sizes, and types, and are used to make items by binding them together with knots. On account of their elasticity and hollow cross-section—which enables them to collapse and deform when pulled—they form tight and stable knots. Key chains, friendship bands and other s are most commonly woven, although more complicated shapes and figures can also be created.

Most of the knots used in scoubidou were already used in bast fibre, while the creations possible with scoubidou are similar to traditional corn dollies and macrame.

==Knots==
===Square stitch===

Also known as a box stitch, the square stitch is the most common knot used in making keychains. It uses two strands of gimp. The square stitch is made by taking the end and crossing opposite ends, then taking one of the other ends and going over the first string and going under the second string. To finish, the last end is woven over the first strand and under the second strand.

More complex stitches can be made by using more strands and incorporating them adjacent to one another while sharing the same cross strand. Thus, one can have double, triple, quadruple and more, with the number of boxes being n-1, with n being the number of strands used (because one of the strands is used as the cross stitch). An endless variety of stitching can be made in this way, incorporating multiple rows, adding rows in the middle of the stitch, forming windows, switching to barrel, etc. Strands can also be added in perpendicular formation.

===Barrel knot===
By crossing the stitch, box can be made into a helical arrangement, often referred to as barrel or spiral, and the formed stitching becomes cylindrical as single barrel, but can take on quite interesting patterns when the stitch is a larger one, such as double, triple, or quadruple barrel.

===Other numbers of strands===


The square stitch uses four strands (resulting from the two ends of each of two scoubidous). Other numbers of strands may be used for the simple woven scoubidou chain, although with more than six the structure becomes difficult to support. Using even numbers of strands enables one end of the construction to be neatly terminated in the middle of a strand (as in the example of the square stitch).

As with the square stitch, each layer may be constructed either with the same direction of weave (leading to a chiral spiral structure) or as a mirror image of the previous layer (leading to a more angular appearance).

===Double spiral===
The double spiral, or twist, is the same concept as the spiral knot however the number of strings is doubled.

===Cobra twist===
The cobra stitch (or snake) involves tying two strands around two other strands back and forth. A super cobra (or king cobra) is created when the strands are tied around the cobra itself, making it wider and larger.

===The Chinese staircase===
One strand is tied around one or more other strands. The more strands that are used in the middle the fatter the Chinese staircase is. This is made with different colour strings.

===The butterfly stitch===
One loop strand is put through another and the latter loop pulled. The loops are then twisted together to resemble a butterfly.

===Large stitches===

Many scoubidou stitches which are commonly done with small numbers of strands can be generalized to use any number of strands. The super-16 is a large scoubidou consisting of sixteen strands woven together. The super-16 can be compared to the square stitch but on a much larger scale.

==Making objects==

Creations such as dragons, Eiffel Towers, bridges, and birds can be made by putting wires inside the stitch to keep it stable, and to enable bending the stitch and keeping it bent.

<doc id="873764" wikidata="Q3321978" url="?curid=873764" title="The Ground Beneath Her Feet">
<text>The Ground Beneath Her Feet is Salman Rushdie&#x27;s sixth novel. Published in 1999, it is a variation on the Orpheus/Eurydice myth, with rock music replacing Orpheus&#x27;s lyre. The myth works as a red thread from which the author sometimes strays, but to which he attaches an endless series of references.

The book, while at its core detailing the love of two men, Ormus Cama and Umeed &quot;Rai&quot; Merchant (the narrator of the story), for the same woman, Vina Apsara, provides a background and alternate history to the entire 1950s–1990s period of the growth of rock music. Defined by Toni Morrison as &quot;a global novel&quot;, the book sets itself in the wide frame of Western and post-colonial culture, through the multilingualism of its characters, the mixture of East and West and the great number of references that span from Greek mythology, European philosophy and contemporaries such as Milan Kundera and the stars of rock&#x27;n roll.

The title is taken from a song in the novel, composed by Ormus Cama after Vina&#x27;s death. The lyrics to the song, with minor changes, were adapted and recorded by U2. The song was used in the 2000 film &quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot;, and the promotional music video featured Rushdie in a cameo appearance. Rushdie re-introduces characters from his previous novels, including Homi Catrack and William Methwold from &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; (1981), S.S. Sisodia from &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; (1988), and Aurora Zogoiby from &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Last Sigh&quot; (1995), as well as settings such as Warden Road and Everest Villas.

The novel is set in a parallel universe, as revealed in the second half of the book. Thus, there are several historic events that are altered in the setting of the novel. In the novel, American president John F. Kennedy survives the Dallas assassination but is shot alongside his brother Robert F. Kennedy later on; the Watergate scandal is represented as a novel starring a fictional president Richard Nixon. Rushdie also deliberately miscredits some classic rock songs, such as The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;, which he credits to John Lennon, or Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, which he credits to The Kinks. The character named Jesse Garon Parker represents Elvis Presley in every way, while The Who are presented under their original name The High Numbers. In his description of the contribution of Vina&#x27;s voice to the duet, he compares that of Guinevere Garfunkel to Carly Simon&#x27;s &quot;Bridge over Troubled Waters&quot;, where the names of the singers hint at Art Garfunkel and Paul Simon.

The novel has been turned into a major performance work combining music and film that premiered at the inaugural Manchester International Festival in England on 29 June 2007. Composed by Victoria Borisova-Ollas and featuring a film directed by Mike Figgis (&quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;Internal Affairs&quot;), the tale of two star-crossed lovers was performed by the Hallé orchestra, conducted by its music director Mark Elder and Alan Rickman as the narrator, with Tehmina Sunny in the role of Vina.

==Reception==
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot;, and &quot;Literary Review&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Observer&quot; and &quot;Spectator&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; review under &quot;Rubbish&quot;. Globally, Complete Review saying on the consensus &quot;Everyone grants that Rushdie displays some linguistic flair, pretty much everyone agrees the characters and characterization is stunningly flat, otherwise opinion is sharply divided. Some see the wild, inventive ride as brilliant, others just as one big mess&quot;.

<doc id="873771" wikidata="Q3245008" url="?curid=873771" title="Fresca">
<text>Fresca is a grapefruit-flavored citrus soft drink created by The Coca-Cola Company. Borrowing the word &quot;Fresca&quot; (meaning &quot;fresh&quot;) from Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese, it was introduced in the United States in 1966. Originally a bottled sugar-free diet soda, sugar sweetened versions were introduced in some markets.

==History==
===Trademarks===
According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, &quot;Fresca&quot; was first trademarked by The Coca-Cola Company in July 1962 as a trade name for &quot;frozen concentrated orange juice&quot; and &quot;frozen concentrated tangerine juice&quot;. The company also applied for a trademark for &quot;Fresca&quot; in 1962 as a &quot;Non-alcoholic Maltless Soft Drink and the Syrups for Preparing Soft Drinks&quot;. In 1969, the company applied for a trademark for &quot;Fresca&quot; as a trade name for &quot;soft drinks and syrups and concentrates for making same&quot;.

===Fresca as a soft drink===
The Coca-Cola Company described the original Fresca soft drink formula as &quot;a citrus-based, sugar free product - a soft drink, a low-calorie beverage, a mixer, all in one&quot; and said the Fresca name was picked because the word is &quot;short, memorable and distinctive&quot;. Fresca was the second artificially sweetened, low-calorie product launched by The Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola&#x27;s Tab, an artificially sweetened, low-calorie cola made its debut in 1963.

Fresca competes primarily against Keurig Dr Pepper&#x27;s Squirt.

===Test marketing===
Coca-Cola began limited test marketing of Fresca in 1964. 1965 saw expanded test marketing in Providence, Rhode Island, and Seattle-Tacoma, Washington. It was also advertised for sale in Michigan and Ohio in late 1965.

===Introduction===
Fresca was introduced across the United States and in international markets in 1966.

Since its introduction, Fresca has been marketed in the United States as a sugar-free, citrus (lime and grapefruit) flavored diet soft drink. In 1966 then Coca-Cola Company president J. Paul Austin announced the company&#x27;s profits had doubled since 1959 and said &quot;Other developments, notably the introduction of Fresca, now underway, promise further advancement in the refreshment industry&quot;.

Multiple references in contemporary newspapers and Coca-Cola corporate websites refer to a wide 1966 US and international rollout of the Fresca soft drink brand.

In 1967 Larrie L. Isenring, general manager of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Madison (Wisconsin) said the &quot;newly introduced Fresca and pre-brewed coffee were the company&#x27;s fastest growing products&quot;.

Sales of Fresca quickly exploded. By March 1967, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. forecast increasing profits for Coca-Cola, saying &quot;we believe Fresca... may be the nation&#x27;s number three soft drink by the end of the year&quot;.

In 1968, it was introduced into the Australian market under the name Tresca, where it was solidly marketed as a diet drink.

By 1969, Fresca had the highest market share of all artificially sweetened soft drinks in America.

===Original bottle design===
Fresca was originally sold in 10 ounce bottles designed by the industrial design firm Hodgman-Bourke of New York, New York. The green glass bottle featured a groove under the logo panel designed to catch condensation from the top half of the bottle. Dimples on the bottle&#x27;s lower half were meant to represent bubbles from the soda&#x27;s carbonation.

==Initial marketing campaign==
===&quot;Blizzard of Flavor&quot;=== 
F. William Free, creative director of the Marschalk Company advertising agency, created the initial marketing campaign for Fresca, branding the soda &quot;the &#x27;Blizzard of Flavor&#x27;. Free had earlier orchestrated the introduction of Sprite and Tab for Coca-Cola.

The agency&#x27;s unifying theme for the brand&#x27;s marketing centered around Fresca having a &quot;blizzard&quot; of &quot;frosty taste&quot;. The soda was said to be &quot;cool, crisp, frosty and refreshing&quot;. A 1966 newspaper ad headline read &quot;Here. The frosty taste of Fresca. It&#x27;s a blizzard&quot;. The ad copy used 25 adjectives to describe Fresca&#x27;s &quot;blizzard taste&quot;.

===National newspaper introduction advertising===
The &quot;Blizzard&quot; campaign included a major market, full color pre-print newspaper advertising program reported to have cost &quot;over a million dollars&quot; which launched in the spring of 1967. The campaign consisted of three successive themes. The first was &quot;Blizzard Kickoff&quot;, aimed at supporting the local introduction of Fresca by regional bottlers, the second was &quot;Fresca and Sherbet&quot; which explained how to use Fresca and other food ingredients for snacks and drinks. The third was named &quot;Blizzard Girls&quot; which featured &quot;The Fresca Girls&quot;, models dressed in fur-trimmed parkas with hoods, photographed drinking Fresca in falling snow while riding a zebra, a miniature car, a Vespa scooter and walking a Saint Bernard. The campaign achieved some of the highest levels of consumer awareness for any consumer product at that time.

===Musical theme song===
The marketing campaign included a theme song &quot;The Blizzard Song&quot;, written by Gary McFarland which was recorded by Mitch Miller and Trini Lopez. Both versions were used in TV ads for Fresca and were also issued as a four-song 45 rpm record.

The Miller record &quot;Mitch Miller – Singin&#x27; Up A Blizzard&quot;, featured a sleeve printed with the slogan &quot;Hey gang, sing up a blizzard with us! Mitch&quot;. The reverse of the sleeve featured a headline &quot;Have a Singing, Swing Blizzard of a Party With Fresca&quot; and included recipes of food and mixed drinks that used Fresca as an ingredient. The Miller record was used in a promotion campaign which encouraged consumers to save Fresca bottle caps and redeem them for a copy of the record.

The Lopez record &quot;Trini Lopez – Sings His Greatest Hits&quot; featured three songs from Lopez&#x27; repertoire as well as his version of McFarland&#x27;s &quot;The Blizzard Song&quot;. This record was issued with a printed sleeve with an ad on the back that said &quot;The frosty taste of Fresca. It&#x27;s a blizzard!&quot; The sleeve had a flap with a die-cut hole and was hung from a bottle in six and eight-pack bottle cartons of Fresca. The record was included at no charge.

===New York City marketing launch and blizzard===
F. William Free orchestrated an elaborate formal marketing debut on February 7, 1967, held at the Four Seasons Restaurant in New York city&#x27;s Seagram&#x27;s building. The fountain in the middle of the restaurant was frozen, and six &quot;Fresca bottles&quot;, women who wore replicas of the top half of Fresca bottles covering their head to their waists skated and danced through the night while the Mitch Miller Orchestra entertained guests with the Fresca &quot;Blizzard Theme&quot; and other hits.

The &quot;Blizzard&quot; campaign took advantage of an incredible, unplanned marketing opportunity. The day after the Four Seasons premiere, New York City received a foot of snow. Free took advantage of the snow storm and created memorable marketing for the new brand. Free was photographed holding a bottle of Fresca in the middle of the snow storm. His photograph appeared in full-page Fresca New York newspaper ads the next day with the headline &quot;New York – We&#x27;re Sorry&quot;.

==Notable Fresca fans==
U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson was known to greatly enjoy Fresca, which was introduced late in his term. Most days Johnson would push his &quot;Fresca button&quot; to order a bottle of Fresca, often accompanied by his favorite chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes.

Bravo network television host Andy Cohen often drinks a &quot;Frequila&quot; during his show. The cocktail is a mixture of Fresca and tequila.

David Plotz, former editor of online magazine Slate and founder and CEO of the local-news podcast network, City Cast is said to be &quot;a hard-core addict of the citrus-flavored soft drink&quot; Fresca.

Fresca is prominently featured in the superhero television series &quot;The Boys&quot;, where it is the favored drink of the cultish Church of the Collective, leading to fan speculation as to its potential meaning. It was eventually revealed that the show&#x27;s writers found it &quot;hilarious&quot; that cult members would drink Fresca, and it just became a running gag with no deeper meaning.

==Formula changes==
Fresca was originally marketed in the United States as a sugar-free, citrus (lime and grapefruit) flavored diet soft drink.

Fresca has undergone several major ingredient and formula changes since its introduction. Fresca was originally sweetened with cyclamates which were banned by the FDA in 1969. They were replaced with saccharin and in turn, they were replaced by NutraSweet-brand aspartame.

According to The Coca-Cola Company, in 1980 an improved Fresca formulation, supported by new packaging, brand graphics and advertising, reached full national availability. The brand refresh was supported by &quot;the most extensive sampling program ever conducted for a soft drink product&quot;. Around the time of the 2005 Fresca redesign, acesulfame potassium was added as a secondary sweetener.
Coca-Cola marketed a sugar sweetened version of Fresca in Latin America. In 1997, The Coca-Cola Company responded to requests for this product from immigrant communities by launching it throughout the US as Citra. This was a success but is instead sold as the Citrus flavor in Coca-Cola&#x27;s Fanta line in areas with large Hispanic populations. In Colombia and Argentina sweetened Fresca is called Quatro and marketed using Fresca&#x27;s colors and logos.

Fresca was made available in South Africa during the early 1990s with a series of colorful ads featuring British-Nigerian actor Hakeem Kae-Kazim with the slogan &quot;Nothing tastes like Fresca&quot;. The soft drink developed a cult following but sales were discontinued.

==Packaging changes==
Fresca packaging has been redesigned several times. In 2005, Coca-Cola gave Fresca a more contemporary look, Fresca&#x27;s first packaging makeover since 1995. During this redesign, two new flavors were introduced (&quot;Sparkling Peach Citrus&quot; and &quot;Sparkling Black Cherry Citrus&quot;) and the original grapefruit flavor was renamed &quot;Sparkling Citrus&quot;. Later, &quot;Sparkling&quot; was dropped and the original flavor was renamed &quot;Original Citrus&quot;. Several additional flavors were added to the line-up after 2005, but those flavors were dropped.

Coca-Cola announced revamped packaging again in 2018 along with a new marketing campaign targeted towards millennials – the first Fresca advertising since 2008 – with the stated intention of &quot;reeling in a new generation of drinkers unfamiliar with the brand&quot;. The marketing described it as a &quot;sparkling flavored soda&quot;, meant to compete with other sparkling beverage products such as La Croix and Izze.

Currently [when?], Fresca has been rebranded as &quot;Fresca Sparkling Soda Water&quot;, reformulated in four flavors, Grapefruit Citrus, Black Cherry Citrus, Peach Citrus and Blackberry Citrus and described as &quot;The original no sugar, no calorie sparkling beverage&quot;. In the US, Fresca is currently [when?] sold in plastic bottles and aluminum cans.

<doc id="873779" wikidata="Q1540567" url="?curid=873779" title="Peristome">
<text>Peristome (from the Greek &quot;peri&quot;, meaning &#x27;around&#x27; or &#x27;about&#x27;, and &quot;stoma&quot;, &#x27;mouth&#x27;) is an anatomical feature that surrounds an opening to an organ or structure. Some plants, fungi, and shelled gastropods have peristomes.

==In mosses==
In mosses, the peristome is a specialized structure in the sporangium that allows for gradual spore discharge, instead of releasing them all at once. 

Most mosses produce a capsule with a lid (the operculum) which falls off when the spores inside are mature and thus ready to be dispersed. The opening thus revealed is called the &quot;stoma&quot; (meaning &quot;mouth&quot;) and is surrounded by one or two peristomes. Each peristome is a ring of triangular &quot;teeth&quot; formed from the remnants of dead cells with thickened cell walls. There are usually 16 such teeth in a single peristome, separate from each other and able to both fold in to cover the stoma as well as fold back to open the stoma. This articulation of the teeth is termed arthrodontous and is found in the moss subclass Bryopsida. In other groups of mosses, the capsule is either nematodontous with an attached operculum (as in the Polytrichopsida), or else splits open without operculum or teeth.

There are two subtypes of arthrodontous peristome. 
# The first is termed haplolepidous and consists of a single circle of 16 peristome teeth. 
# The second type is the diplolepidous peristome found in subclass Bryidae. In this type, there are two rings of peristome teeth—an inner endostome (short for &quot;endoperistome&quot;) and an exostome. The endostome is a more delicate membrane, and its teeth are aligned between the teeth of the exostome. There are a few mosses in the Bryopsida that have no peristome in their capsules. These mosses still undergo the same cell division patterns in capsule development, but the teeth do not fully develop.

==In pitcher plants==

In pitcher plants, the peristome is a reflexed ring (or partial ring) of tissue that surrounds the entrance to the digestive tube in these plants. It often (for example in &quot;Cephalotus&quot; and &quot;Nepenthes&quot;) possesses sharp, overhanging &#x27;teeth&#x27; which aid in prey retention. It is often studded with nectar secreting glands, hence its popular name, nectar roll.

==In fungi==
The basidiocarps of some gasteroid fungi - such as puffballs and earthstars - release spores through an apical opening that is termed a peristome and is variously delimited, its features often being diagnostic when distinguishing closely related species.
==In shelled gastropods==


The peristome is the margin of the aperture of a gastropod shell. It is the edge of the lip of the shell. This part is sometimes reflected (turned back) or thickened once the snail reaches adult size, and these qualities of the peristome can be diagnostic features of the shell which may aid in identification of the species.

==In other invertebrates==
The peristome is any of the structures or sets of parts that surround the mouth or invertebrates such as echinoderms or earthworms.

<doc id="873782" wikidata="Q4014837" url="?curid=873782" title="Visual Audio Sensory Theater">
<text>Visual Audio Sensory Theater is the debut album by the band VAST, released on April 28, 1998 by Elektra Records. The album mixed samples of Benedictine monks of the Abbey of Saint-Maur and Le Mystère Des Voix Bulgares, with an 18-piece orchestra, guitars, and electronics.

Jon Crosby originally signed onto Elektra Records when he was only 17, and recorded his demo EP, &quot;VAST Is...&quot; which featured certain songs to be featured on their debut in an unfinished form. He also traveled across the world and recorded demos of world choirs that he used in various songs on the album, which gave the album its trademark world-music theme.

The first single released from the album was &quot;Pretty When You Cry&quot;. Led by a supporting music video, it gained modest success on the music charts. However, the band&#x27;s and the album&#x27;s popularity didn&#x27;t skyrocket until the second single, &quot;Touched&quot;, was featured in a film soundtrack and the music video was put in play on MTV. No other singles were released for the disc, and &quot;Touched&quot; is still VAST&#x27;s most famous song, it being featured in the &quot;Angel&quot; soundtrack, &quot;&quot;, the companion CD to the &quot;Everworld&quot; book series, and as a song featured in WrestleMania XXV. The track also appears in the movie &quot;The Beach&quot; but is not featured in the soundtrack.

Other album tracks featured in various media include &quot;Pretty When You Cry&quot; played during the end credits of the German film &quot;We are the night&quot; and is included in its soundtrack CD; &quot;Flames&quot;, which was used in the German film &quot;Summer Storm&quot;; and &quot;Here&quot;, which has been used in two episodes of &quot;Angel&quot;. The songs &quot;Here&quot;, &quot;Dirty Hole&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Dying&quot;, and &quot;Temptation&quot; were also used in the unaired pitch video for &quot;Angel&quot;. &quot;Touched&quot; contains elements of the song &quot;Pilentze Pee&quot;, sung by the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir. &quot;Touched&quot; was featured in the surfing film &quot;Step into Liquid&quot;.

==Reception==

AllMusic said that &quot;the rich textures created here are quite impressive,&quot; and gave the album 3 stars out of 5.

<text>Pauline Johnson Collegiate &amp; Vocational School in Brantford, Ontario, Canada is a composite high school with collegiate and vocational departments. It was named in honour of the Canadian First Nations poet E. Pauline Johnson, who was born nearby.

The school was officially opened on October 18, 1955. In 1960, the fine new vocational wing was opened for use by the Technical and Commercial Departments making possible a full composite school. A second addition was completed in 1963. In 1971, a new addition provided more facilities.

As of June 15th, 2016 the school is also home of the Kiwanis Field, which is now the home turf of the Thunderbirds. This field was &quot;Brantford’s first state-of-the-art, multi-purpose athletic facility with a full size Canadian football, soccer, lacrosse and rugby synthetic turf playing field and an 8-lane rubberized track (with steeplechase hurdles) as its focal point. Rounding out the facilities, other features are two long jump/ triple jump pits, pole vault area, a shot put area and one high jump approach.&quot;.

<doc id="873805" wikidata="Q329452" url="?curid=873805" title="Yos Sudarso Island">
<text>Kolepom Island or Pulau Yos Sudarso is an island separated by the narrow Muli Strait from the main island of New Guinea. It is part of the Merauke Regency, in the Indonesian province of South Papua. The island is leaf-shaped, about long with an area of . It was known as Frederik Hendrik Island until 1963. Local and alternative names of the island include Dolok and Kimaam. This is the 11th largest island in Indonesia.
With about 11,000 inhabitants, the island&#x27;s population density is less than . The native population speaks Kolopom languages, including Kimaghima, Ndom, and Riantana/Kimaan. Communities on the island include Kaba, Kimaan, Kladar, Pembre, Wan, and Yomuka. Kimaan (or Kimaam) is the main settlement. It lies in the southeast on the Buaya Strait that separates the smaller island of Komoran from Dolak.

==History==
The island was first sighted by Europeans in about January 1606 when Willem Jansz and his crew on the ship &quot;Duyfken&quot; rounded it on their way to and returning from their discovery of Australia. &quot;Duyfken&quot; spent considerable time in the bight in between the island and the mainland. Jansz&#x27;s map of the expedition describes the island as lowland and muddy land and with the name &quot;Tiuri&quot;. When rounding the prominent southwest cape, jutting into the Arafura Sea, in 1623, Jan Carstensz named it &quot;Valse Kaap&quot; (Dutch for &quot;False Cape&quot;), a name retained to date (Indonesian &quot;Tanjung Vals&quot;, English &quot;Cape Vals&quot;).

It was considered to be a part of mainland New Guinea until 1835, when between April 26 and May 9 that year the Dutch captains Langenberg, Kool and Banse sailed their schooners &quot;Postillon&quot; and &quot;Sireen&quot; through the narrow channels. They named the waterway &#x27;Princess Marianne Strait&#x27; (now Muli Strait) and the island after Prince William Frederick Henry, a grandson of the king, who lived in the Dutch East Indies for a while. Until at least 1884 Komoran was thought to be part of Dolak. After the handover of Western New Guinea to Indonesia in May 1963, the Indonesian government renamed the island after the Indonesian naval officer Yos Sudarso, who was in charge of a raid on the New Guinea coastline to the northwest in January 1962, but was killed in the process.

==Languages==
The Kolopom languages, part of the Trans-New Guinea language family, and the Mombum (or Komolom) languages, an independent language family, are spoken on Yos Sudarso Island.

<text>This is a list of military units taking part in the Warsaw Uprising, a Polish insurrection during the Second World War that began on August 1, 1944.

== Polish units ==
Many of the Home Army units were formed before the beginning of the Uprising; several were organised in the following days as new volunteers joined.

Units were assigned to given areas, namely:
* Area I (Śródmieście, Stare Miasto)
* Area II (Żoliborz, Marymont, Bielany)
* Area III (Wola)
* Area IV (Ochota)
* Area V (Mokotów)
* Area VI (Praga)
* Area VII (Powiat Warszawski)
* Zgrupowanie KeDywu Komendy Głównej
Units were organised into battalions, companies and platoons. Many of those became famous either before the Uprising or during it, including &#x27;Battalion Zośka&#x27;, &#x27;Czata 49&#x27;, &#x27;Parasol&#x27;, and &#x27;Miotła&#x27;.

* 1,700 pistols
* 300 machine pistols
* 60 submachine guns
* 7 machine guns
* 35 anti-tank guns
* 25,000 hand grenades

Types of weapons used can be divided into the following categories:
* Polish Army weapons hidden after the invasion of Poland (FB Vis, Model 98a rifle, Karabinek wz. 1929, Browning wz. 1928, etc.)
* Homemade weaponry (Błyskawica, K pattern flamethrower, sidolówka, filipinka, Molotov cocktails, etc.)
* Weapons scavenged from the Wehrmacht (Luger pistol, Karabiner 98k, MP 40, etc.)
* Weapons bought directly from the Germans or on the black market
* Weapons from Allied forces, primarily supplied via airdrop (M1911 pistol, Sten, Bren, PIAT, etc.).

The following list does not correspond with the above area list.

On September 20 this structure was reorganised to fit the structure of Polish forces fighting among the Western Allies. The entire force was renamed to Warsaw Home Army Corps (&quot;Warszawski Korpus Armii Krajowej&quot;), commanded by general Antoni Chruściel (&quot;Monter&quot;) and consisted of three infantry divisions:
* 8th &quot;Romuald Traugutt&quot; Infantry Division (&quot;8 Dywizja Piechoty im. Romualda Traugutta&quot;) commanded by col. Żywiciel-Niedzielski
* 10th &quot;Maciej Rataj&quot; Infantry Division (&quot;10 Dywizja Piechoty im. Macieja Rataja&quot;) commanded by col. Radwan-Pleiffer
* 28th &quot;Stefan Okrzeja&quot; Infantry Division (&quot;28 Dywizja Piechoty im. Stefana Okrzei&quot;) commanded by col. Karol-Rokicki
The names of smaller units (battalions, companies and platoons) were left intact (as in the above table).

=== Composition of smaller fighting forces ===
Although the vast majority of the resistance in Warsaw were members of Home Army, there was a small number of fighters who weren&#x27;t members of that organisation. In the course of the Uprising some 1,700 members of other resistance organisations joined the Uprising. Those included the Armia Ludowa, Gwardia Ludowa and Narodowe Siły Zbrojne.

Along with the Polish soldiers who took part in the Uprising, there were also members of other nationalities. Among them was a number of Hungarian deserters and Italian escapees from POW camps in Poland. Another ex-POW soldier was RAF Sgt. John Ward, whose numerous coded radio dispatches gave an eyewitness account of the fighting to the British government and Polish government-in-exile, as well as the London press. There was also a Slovak 535th Home Army platoon under Lt. Stanko. It was composed mostly of Slovaks, Georgians, Armenians and Azeri, and suffered heavy casualties in the course of the uprising (up to 70%).

It is believed that some 25,000 Jews were hiding in Warsaw before the Uprising. The vast majority of them died together with other Polish civilians. However, many Jews (possibly as many as 1,000), including those released by Home Army from the Warsaw concentration camp (&quot;Gęsiówka&quot;), joined the Home Army. During the final stage of the battle a number of Soviet soldiers (possibly as many as 3,000, most of them members of Polish units in Soviet army) also crossed the river and fought the Germans in Powiśle area. Airdrops were carried out by allied airmen from Italy, mostly by Poles, Canadians and the British.

== German units ==
As of 23 August 1944 the German units directly involved with fights in Warsaw were divided into:
* Kampfgruppe Rohr (commanded by general major Rohr)
** S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A. (commanded by Bronislav Kaminski)
* Kampfgruppe Reinefarth (commanded by SS-Gruppenführer Heinz Reinefarth)
** Sturmgruppe Dirlewanger (commanded by SS-Oberführer der Reserve Oskar Dirlewanger)
** Sturmgruppe Reck (commanded by Major Reck)
** Sturmgruppe Schmidt (commanded by Colonel Schmidt)
** various support and backup units
* Warsaw Garrison (Group of Warsaw Commandant) commanded by Lieutenant General Stahel
A large section of the forces on the &quot;German&quot; side were, according to Norman Davies, drawn from &quot;&#x27;collaborationist forces&#x27;&quot; including Russians who had left in the Tzar&#x27;s era and Azeris.

<doc id="873815" wikidata="Q2002188" url="?curid=873815" title="The Dream Academy">
<text>The Dream Academy was a British alternative pop band consisting of lead vocalist and guitarist and primary songwriter Nick Laird-Clowes, woodwinds player and pianist Kate St John, and keyboardist Gilbert Gabriel. The band is most noted for their 1985 hit record, &quot;Life in a Northern Town&quot;.

==History==
Laird-Clowes and Gabriel met each other in the late 1970s whilst the former was in a band called The Act. Their idea was to create a songscape different from the power pop groups popular at the time in the UK, by mixing instruments and sounds that had been rarely done prominently before, such as strings, woodwinds, percussion (timpani) and synthesizers. At first, Laird-Clowes and Gabriel called themselves the Politics of Paradise.

The Dream Academy formed in 1983. Laird-Clowes met Kate St John (then of The Ravishing Beauties) at a party and asked her to join his band. The trio settled on the name The Dream Academy and shopped their demos for nearly two years. Their work was rejected by every record label before they finally landed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1985. Along the way, they made connections with Adam Peters and Pink Floyd&#x27;s David Gilmour, a friend of Laird-Clowes. Gilmour would go on to produce and/or play on two of their albums and co-write one Dream Academy song, &quot;Twelve-Eight Angel&quot;.

The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Life in a Northern Town&quot; (1985), was a worldwide success and sizeable hit in the U.S., charting at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, from an album co-produced by Gilmour. The song also made number 15 in the UK Singles Chart. The single was dedicated to the English singer-songwriter Nick Drake. It was their only major chart success. The band&#x27;s follow-up single, &quot;The Love Parade&quot; (1985), charted in the U.K. and the United States.

Also in 1985, The Dream Academy covered the Smiths&#x27; &quot;Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want&quot;. Their version of the song peaked at number 83 on the UK Singles Chart. The Dream Academy&#x27;s instrumental version of this cover was used in the movie &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; in 1986.

The band launched a worldwide promotional tour based on the chart success of &quot;Life in a Northern Town&quot; and appeared on the television programmes &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot; (with Dick Clark), &quot;MTV&quot; (interview with J. J. Jackson), and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The Dream Academy&#x27;s eponymous debut album also reached a wide audience in the United States. Their two subsequent albums did not match their initial success. They also covered &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got to Learn Sometime&quot;, released on the album &quot;Remembrance Days&quot; (1987).

The Dream Academy disbanded in 1991. The band released a compilation album entitled &quot;Somewhere in the Sun... Best of the Dream Academy&quot; in Japan in 2000. In 2014, the band released another compilation album: &quot;The Morning Lasted All Day: A Retrospective&quot;. &quot;The Morning Lasted All Day&quot; was compiled, annotated, and remastered by Laird-Clowes.

<text>Aleksandr Panayotov Aleksandrov (; born December 1, 1951) is a retired Bulgarian cosmonaut. He is the second Bulgarian to have flown to space, behind Georgi Ivanov.

==Biography==

Aleksandrov was born in Omurtag, Bulgaria on December 1, 1951. He graduated from the Bulgarian Air Force Academy in 1974 and obtained a degree in technical sciences in 1983. In the Bulgarian Air Force, Aleksandrov rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Aleksandrov was selected as a research cosmonaut on March 1, 1978, as part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Intercosmos program. The selection featured six semifinalists, including the parachute jump record holder, Chavdar Djurov, who was killed during the selection process. Aleksandrov was selected as backup to Georgi Ivanov on the Soyuz 33 mission to the Salyut 6 space station. Subsequently, Aleksandrov was assigned to the prime crew of the Soyuz TM-5 mission to the Mir space station.

On June 7, 1988, Aleksandrov launched aboard TM-5 as a research cosmonaut along with mission commander Anatoly Solovyev and Viktor Savinykh. Upon arriving at Mir, Aleksandrov became the first Bulgarian to reach a Soviet space station, as the Soyuz 33 mission carrying Georgi Ivanov failed to reach the Salyut 6 space station. On June 17, Aleksandrov returned aboard Soyuz TM-4 along with his fellow crew members. He, along with his crew-mates, spent just under 10 days in space.

Aleksandrov later became Deputy Director of the Institute of Space Research, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

Currently Aleksandrov works as a research scientist. He is married and has one child.

<text>Aleksandr Pavlovich Aleksandrov (; born February 20, 1943) is a former Soviet cosmonaut and twice Hero of the Soviet Union (November 23, 1983, and December 29, 1987).

== Biography ==
Born in Moscow, Russia, he graduated from Moscow Bauman-Highschool in 1969 with a doctorate degree, specialised on spacecraft steering systems.

He was selected as cosmonaut on December 1, 1978. For his first spaceflight, he flew as Flight Engineer on Soyuz T-9, which lasted from June to November 1983. For his second spaceflight, he replaced one of the long-duration crew members of Mir EO-2. For the spaceflight, he was launched with the spacecraft Soyuz TM-3 in July 1987, and landed with the same spacecraft in December 1987. All together he spent 309 days, 18 hours, 2 minutes in space. He served as backup for Soyuz T-8, Soyuz T-13, and Soyuz T-15.

He resigned from the cosmonaut team on October 26, 1993, when he became chief of NPOE Cosmonaut-group; since 1996 he is Chief flight test directorate of RKKE. He is married with two children.

<doc id="873825" wikidata="Q607487" url="?curid=873825" title="Tehiya">
<text>Tehiya (), originally known as Banai (, an abbreviation for &quot;Land of Israel Loyalists&#x27; Alliance&quot;), then Tehiya-Bnai (), was an ultranationalist political party in Israel. The party existed from 1979 until 1992. In the eyes of many, Tehiya was identified with Geula Cohen, who founded the party and headed it throughout its existence.

==Background==
The party was formed in 1979 during the term of the ninth Knesset, when Geula Cohen and Moshe Shamir broke away from Herut in response to the Camp David Treaty between Egypt and Israel, particularly the return of the Sinai peninsula to Egypt, and the eviction of its Israeli settlers.

Tehiya was strongly affiliated with the extra-parliamentary movement of Gush Emunim, and included prominent members of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza such as Hanan Porat (later to be a member of the Knesset for the National Religious Party and the National Union) and Elyakim Haetzni. Another founder and prominent member was the physicist Yuval Neeman.

In its first electoral test, the 1981 legislative election, Tehiya picked up three seats. Despite their previous difference of opinion, they were included in Menachem Begin&#x27;s coalition government alongside Likud, the National Religious Party, Agudat Israel, Tami and Telem. Although Cohen did not take a ministerial position, Neeman became Minister of Science and Development.

In the 1984 elections, Tehiya became the third largest party in the Knesset after the Alignment and Likud, albeit with only five seats. However, they refused to participate in the national unity government of Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir, which included the Alignment, Likud, the National Religious Party, Agudat Israel, Shas, Morasha, Shinui and Ometz. During the Knesset session Rafael Eitan defected from Tehiya to found a new party, Tzomet.

The party was reduced to three seats in the 1988 legislative election, and was again excluded from Shamir&#x27;s national unity government. However, when the Alignment left the coalition in 1990, Tehiya were invited into a new narrow right-wing government which included Likud, the National Religious Party, Shas, Agudat Israel, Degel HaTorah, the New Liberal Party. Although Cohen again declined a ministerial position, Neeman was appointed Minister of Energy and Infrastructure and Minister of Science and Technology. Despite its late entry to the government, the party pulled out of the coalition on 21 January 1992 in protest over Yitzhak Shamir&#x27;s participation in the Madrid conference, which forced the government to hold new elections.

In the 1992 legislative election, the party failed to cross the electoral threshold, and subsequently disappeared, with Cohen joining Likud that year. It is likely that most of its electorate went to Eitan&#x27;s Tzomet, who jumped from two seats in the 1988 elections to eight in the 1992 votes. The two parties had competed on the same secular right-wing electorate.

Tehiya fronted a number of controversial positions in its time, some of which were adopted by the mainstream; most notably, the Jerusalem Law, which was proposed by the party and enacted on 30 July 1980 establishing Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel.

== Structure ==
The structure of Tehiya was based on a military model due to Gideon Altshuler, former head of an IDF brigade being made Secretary General, and Shmuel Gordan, a former Lieutenant Colonel, being made head of organization. The party only allowed Jewish members. 
==Election results==
==Knesset members==
==Election platform==

The Tehiya platform at the 1988 elections included:

* Jewish sovereignty over the Sinai Peninsula, West Bank, and Gaza Strip.
* Increasing the Jewish population in all parts of Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City.
* Strengthening the Israel Defense Forces through advanced technology and strict penalties for refusal to serve.
* Expanding Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, including creating a dedicated police force.
* Clemency for Jews convicted of crimes driven by &quot;security distress.&quot;
* Limiting peace agreements to Arab states that accept Jewish control over all of the Land of Israel.
* Declaring Jordan as the Palestinian state and opposing any Palestinian state west of the Jordan River.
* Ending Palestinian access to the High Court of Justice.
* Enforcing the death penalty for severe acts of violence by Palestinians.
* Allowing soldiers to use lethal force against stone throwers.
* Imposing collective punishments on Palestinians.
* Building wide access roads through the historic centers of Palestinian cities.

<text>A derecho (, from , &#x27;straight&#x27;) is a widespread, long-lived, straight-line wind storm that is associated with a fast-moving group of severe thunderstorms known as a mesoscale convective system.

Derechos cause hurricane-force winds, heavy rains, and flash floods. In many cases, convection-induced winds take on a bow echo (backward &quot;C&quot;) form of squall line, often forming beneath an area of diverging upper tropospheric winds, and in a region of both rich low-level moisture and warm-air advection. Derechos move rapidly in the direction of movement of their associated storms, similar to an outflow boundary (gust front), except that the wind remains sustained for a greater period of time (often increasing in strength after onset), and may reach tornado- and hurricane-force winds. A derecho-producing convective system may remain active for many hours and, occasionally, over multiple days.

A warm-weather phenomenon, derechos mostly occur in summer, especially during June, July, and August in the Northern Hemisphere, or March, April, and May in the Southern Hemisphere, within areas of moderately strong instability and moderately strong vertical wind shear. However, derechos can occur at any time of the year. They are equally likely during day and night times.

Various studies since the 1980s have shed light on the physical processes responsible for the production of widespread damaging winds by thunderstorms. In addition, it has become apparent that the most damaging derechos are associated with particular types of mesoscale convective systems that are self-perpetuating (meaning that the convective systems are not strongly dependent on the larger-scale meteorological processes such as those associated with blizzard-producing winter storms and strong cold fronts). In addition, the term &quot;derecho&quot; sometimes is misapplied to convectively generated wind events that are not particularly well-organized or long-lasting. For these reasons, a more precise, physically based definition of &quot;derecho&quot; has been introduced within the meteorological community.

==Etymology==

&quot;Derecho&quot; comes from the Spanish adjective for &quot;straight&quot; (or &quot;direct&quot;), in contrast with a &quot;tornado&quot; which is a &quot;twisted&quot; wind. The word was first used in the &quot;American Meteorological Journal&quot; in 1888 by Gustavus Detlef Hinrichs in a paper describing the phenomenon and based on a significant derecho event that crossed Iowa on 31 July 1877.

==Development==
Organized areas of thunderstorm activity reinforce pre-existing frontal zones, and can outrun cold fronts. The resultant mesoscale convective system (MCS) often forms at the point of the strongest divergence of the upper-level flow, and new storm cells are developed in the area with the greatest low-level inflow. The convection tends to move east or toward the equator, roughly parallel to low-level thickness lines and usually somewhat to the right of the mean tropospheric flow. When the convection is strongly linear or slightly curved, the MCS is called a squall line, with the strongest winds typically occurring just behind the leading edge of the significant wind shift and pressure rise.

Classic derechos occur with squall lines that contain bow- or spearhead-shaped features as seen by weather radar that are known as &quot;bow echoes&quot; or &quot;spearhead echoes&quot;. Squall lines typically &quot;bow out&quot; due to the formation of a mesoscale high-pressure system which forms within the stratiform rain area behind the initial convective line. This high-pressure area is formed due to strong descending air currents behind the squall line, and could come in the form of a downburst. The size of the bow may vary, and the storms associated with the bow may die and redevelop.

During the cool season within the Northern Hemisphere, derechos generally develop within a pattern of mid-tropospheric southwesterly winds, in an environment of low to moderate atmospheric instability (caused by relative warmth and moisture near ground level, with cooler air aloft, as measured by convective available potential energy), and high values of vertical wind shear ( within the lowest of the atmosphere).

Warm season derechos in the Northern Hemisphere most often form in west to northwesterly flow at mid-levels of the troposphere, with moderate to high levels of thermodynamic instability. As previously mentioned, derechos favor environments of low-level warm advection and significant low-level moisture.

==Classification and criteria==
A common definition is a thunderstorm complex that produces a damaging wind swath of at least , featuring a concentrated area of convectively-induced wind gusts exceeding . According to the National Weather Service (NWS) criterion, a derecho is classified as a band of storms that have winds of at least along the entire span of the storm front, maintained over a time span of at least six hours. Some studies add a requirement that no more than two or three hours separate any two successive wind reports. A more recent, more physically based definition of &quot;derecho&quot; proposes that the term be reserved for use with convective systems that not only contain unique radar-observed features such as bow echoes and mesovortices, but also for events that produce damage swaths at least 100 km (60 miles) wide and 650 km (400 miles) long.

On January 11, 2022, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Environment and Climate Change Canada formally revised the criteria for a storm to be classified as a derecho. A wind storm must meet the following criteria:
* Wind damage swath extending for more than 
* Wind gusts of at least along most of its length
* Several, well-separated or greater gusts

Prior to January 11, 2022, the definition for a derecho was:
* Wind damage swath extending for more than 
* Wind gusts of at least along most of its length

===Types===
Four types of derechos are generally recognized:

* Serial derecho – This type of derecho is usually associated with a very deep low.
** Single-bow – A very large bow echo around or upwards of long. This type of serial derecho is less common than the multi-bow kind. A few examples of a single-bow serial derecho are the derecho that occurred in association with the October 2010 North American storm complex, and the December 2021 Midwest derecho.
** Multi-bow – Multiple bow derechos are embedded in a large squall line typically around long. One example of a multi-bow serial derecho is a derecho that occurred during the 1993 Storm of the Century in Florida. Because of embedded supercells, tornadoes can spin out of these types of derechos. This is a much more common type of serial derecho than the single-bow kind. Multi-bow serial derechos can be associated with line echo wave patterns (LEWPs) on weather radar.
* Progressive derecho – A line of thunderstorms take the bow-shape and may travel for hundreds of miles along stationary fronts. Examples of this include &quot;Hurricane Elvis&quot; in 2003, the August 2020 Midwest derecho, the Boundary Waters-Canadian Derecho of 4–5 July 1999, and the  May 2022 Canadian derecho. Tornado formation is less common in a progressive than serial type.
* Hybrid derecho – A derecho with characteristics of both a serial and progressive derecho. Similar to serial derechos and progressive derechos, these types of derechos are associated with a deep low, but are relatively small in size. An example is the Late-May 1998 tornado outbreak and derecho that moved through the central Northern Plains and the Southern Great Lakes on 30–31 May 1998.
* Low dewpoint derecho – A derecho that occurs in an environment of comparatively limited low-level moisture, with appreciable moisture confined to the mid-levels of the atmosphere. Such derechos most often occur between late fall and early spring in association with strong low-pressure systems. Low dew point derechos are essentially organized bands of successive, dry downbursts. The Utah-Wyoming derecho of 31 May 1994 was an event of this type. It produced a wind gust at Provo, Utah, where sixteen people were injured, and removed part of the roof of the Saltair Pavilion on the Great Salt Lake. Surface dew points along the path of the derecho were about .

==Characteristics==
Winds in a derecho can be enhanced by downburst clusters embedded inside the storm. These straight-line winds may exceed , reaching in past events. Tornadoes sometimes form within derecho events, although such events are often difficult to confirm due to the additional damage caused by straight-line winds in the immediate area.

With the average tornado in the United States and Canada rating in the low end of the F/EF1 classification at peak winds and most or all of the rest of the world even lower, derechos tend to deliver the vast majority of extreme wind conditions over much of the territory in which they occur. Datasets compiled by the United States National Weather Service and other organizations show that a large swath of the north-central United States, and presumably at least the adjacent sections of Canada and much of the surface of the Great Lakes, can expect winds from over a significant area at least once in any 50-year period, including both convective events and extra-tropical cyclones and other events deriving power from baroclinic sources. Only in 40 to 65 percent or so of the United States resting on the coast of the Atlantic basin, and a fraction of the Everglades, are derechos surpassed in this respect — by landfalling hurricanes, which at their worst may have winds as severe as EF3 tornadoes.

Certain derecho situations are the most common instances of severe weather outbreaks which may become &quot;less&quot; favorable to tornado production as they become more violent; the height of 30–31 May 1998 upper Middle West-Canada-New York State derecho and the latter stages of significant tornado and severe weather outbreaks in 2003 and 2004 are only three examples of this. Some upper-air measurements used for severe-weather forecasting may reflect this point of diminishing return for tornado formation, and the mentioned three situations were instances during which the rare Particularly Dangerous Situation severe thunderstorm variety of severe weather watches were issued from the Storm Prediction Center of the U.S. National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration.

Some derechos develop a radar signature resembling that of a hurricane in the low levels. They may have a central &quot;eye&quot; free of precipitation, with a minimum central pressure and surrounding bands of strong convection, but are really associated with an MCS developing multiple squall lines, and are not tropical in nature. These storms have a warm core, like other mesoscale convective systems. One such derecho occurred across the Midwestern U.S. on 21 July 2003. An area of convection developed across eastern Iowa near a weak stationary/warm front and ultimately matured, taking on the shape of a wavy squall line across western Ohio and southern Indiana. The system re-intensified after leaving the Ohio Valley, starting to form a large hook, with occasional hook echoes appearing along its eastern side. A surface low pressure center formed and became more impressive later in the day. Another example is the May 2009 Southern Midwest derecho.

==Location==

Derechos in North America form predominantly from April to August, peaking in frequency from May into July. During this time of year, derechos are mostly found in the Midwestern United States and the U.S. Interior Highlands most commonly from Oklahoma and across the Ohio Valley. During mid-summer when a hot and muggy air mass covers the north-central U.S., they will often develop farther north into Manitoba or Northwestern Ontario, sometimes well north of the Canada–US border.

North Dakota, Minnesota, and upper Michigan are also vulnerable to derecho storms when such conditions are in place. They often occur along stationary fronts on the northern periphery of where the most intense heat and humidity bubble exists. Late-year derechos are normally confined to Texas and the Deep South, although a late-summer derecho struck upper parts of the New York State area after midnight on 7 September 1998. Warm season derechos have greater instability than their cold season counterpart, while cool season derechos have greater shear than their warm season counterpart.

Although these storms most commonly occur in North America, derechos can occur elsewhere in the world, with a few areas relatively frequently. Outside North America, they sometimes are called by different names. For example, in Bangladesh and parts of Eastern India, a type of storm known as &quot;Kalbaisakhi&quot; or &quot;Nor&#x27;westers&quot; may be a progressive derecho. One such event occurred on 10 July 2002 in Germany: a serial derecho killed eight people and injured 39 near Berlin. Derechos occur in southeastern South America (particularly Argentina and southern Brazil) and South Africa as well, and on rarer occasions, close to or north of the 60th parallel in northern Canada. Primarily a mid-latitudes phenomenon, derechos do occur in the Amazon Basin of Brazil. On 8 August 2010, a derecho struck Estonia and tore off the tower of Väike-Maarja Church. Derechos are occasionally observed in China.

==Damage risk==
Since derechos occur during warm months and often in places with cold winter climates, people who are most at risk are those involved in outdoor activities. Campers, hikers, and motorists are most at risk because of falling trees toppled over by straight-line winds. Wide swaths of forest have been felled by such storms. People who live in mobile homes are also at risk; mobile homes that are not anchored to the ground may be overturned from the high winds. Across the United States, Michigan and New York have incurred many of the fatalities from derechos. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, the death tolls from derechos and hurricanes were comparable for the United States.

Derechos may also severely damage an urban area&#x27;s electrical distribution system, especially if these services are routed above ground. The derecho that struck Chicago, Illinois on 11 July 2011 left more than 860,000 people without electricity. The June 2012 North American derecho took out electrical power to more than 3.7 million customers starting in the Midwestern United States, across the central Appalachians, into the Mid-Atlantic States during a heat wave.

The August 2020 Midwest Derecho delivered a maximum measured wind speed of , with damage-estimated speeds as high as in the Cedar Rapids, Iowa area. The storm was referred to as one of the largest &quot;land-based hurricanes&quot; in recorded history spawning 17 confirmed tornadoes across Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. Ten million acres of crops were damaged or destroyed, accounting for roughly a third of the state of Iowa&#x27;s agricultural area. Over a million homes across the Midwest were without basic services such as water and electricity. Iowa Governor Reynolds requested $4 billion in federal aid to assist in the recovery efforts. Winds were confirmed as having stirred up in Colorado and Nebraska, and then proceeded in force crossing 5 states including Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio leaving destruction in excess of $7.5 billion in estimated damages.

The 21 May 2022 derecho in southern Ontario and western Quebec travelled lengthwise along the most heavily populated region in Canada, reaching peak wind speeds of 190 km/h. The derecho killed 10 people and caused $875 million property damage, the sixth largest &quot;insured loss event&quot; in Canadian history. Destruction of utility poles deprived some rural communities of telephone and electricity services for several weeks.

==Aviation==
Derechos can be hazardous to aviation due to embedded microbursts, downbursts, and downburst clusters. In addition, the powerful updrafts and high cloud tops can cause for dangerous conditions. Their sheer size also makes them very difficult to navigate around.

<text>Vladimir Afanasyevich Lyakhov (; ; 20 July 1941 – 19 April 2018) was a Ukrainian Soviet cosmonaut.

He was selected as cosmonaut on 5 May 1967, and retired on 7 September 1994. Lyakhov was the Commander on Soyuz 32, Soyuz T-9, and Soyuz TM-6, and spent 333 days, 7 hours, 47 minutes in space. He was married and had two children.

Lyakhov&#x27;s flight to Salyut-6 with Valeri Ryumin as the Soyuz 32 crew resulted in setting a space endurance record of 175 days when they returned to Earth on 19 August 1979.

Lyakhov conducted three spacewalks for a cumulative total of 7 hours and 8 minutes with one outside of Salyut 6 and two outside of Salyut 7.

Lyakhov was deputy director for cosmonaut training and deputy commander of the cosmonaut corps at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. He retired in 1994. He was twice awarded the Order of Lenin and was twice named a Hero of the Soviet Union. He was also named a Hero of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and awarded with the Order of the Saur Revolution and Order of The Sun of Freedom.

<text>A reform school was a penal institution, generally for teenagers, mainly operating between 1830 and 1900. In the United Kingdom and its colonies, reformatories (commonly called reform schools) were set up from 1854 onward for children who were convicted of a crime, as an alternative to an adult prison. In parallel, industrial schools were set up for vagrants and children needing protection. Both were &#x27;certified&#x27; by the government from 1857 onward, and in 1932, the systems merged and both were &#x27;approved&#x27; and became approved schools.

Both in the United Kingdom and the United States, they came out of social concerns about cities, poverty, immigration and vagrancy following industrialization, as well as from a shift in society&#x27;s attitude from retribution (punishing the miscreant) to reforming.

They were distinct from borstals (UK; 1902–1982), which were enclosed juvenile prisons.

==History==
Social reformers in America during the late 19th and early 20th centuries almost invariably found fault with the then-usual practice of treating juvenile offenders essentially the same as adult criminals. It was recognized that the juveniles were often sexually and/or otherwise exploited by the older inmates, and that they were often receiving instruction in more advanced and serious ways of crime by hardened criminals. As a result, rather than their sentences serving as a deterrent to future crimes, many juvenile offenders emerged from incarceration far worse than when they were first sentenced.

The reforms, which were adopted more readily in some states than others, consisted of a two-pronged approach – a separate juvenile code and juvenile courts for offenders who had not reached the age of majority, and the building of separate institutions for juvenile &quot;delinquents&quot; (the stigmatizing term &quot;criminal&quot; not being used). Since the primary purpose of these institutions was to be rehabilitative rather than punitive, they were styled &quot;reform schools&quot;. For the most part, these institutions were custodial.

In the United Kingdom, reformatory schools were provided for criminal children, whilst industrial schools were intended to prevent vulnerable children from becoming criminals. There was a perceived rise in juvenile delinquency during the early 19th century; whereas in a rural economy young children could gain paid employment doing tasks such as bird scaring and stone gathering, these opportunities were not available in the cities. Children were very visible on the streets. In 1816, Parliament set up a ‘Committee for Investigating the Alarming Increase in Juvenile Crime in the Metropolis’; in 1837, the writer Charles Dickens published &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, a story about a child involved in a street gang; and it was recognised in the Juvenile Offences Act 1846 that children under 14 should be tried in a special court, not an adult court. Begging and vagrancy were rife, and it was these low-level misdemeanours that caused the magistrates to send children to industrial schools to learn to be industrious, and learn skills that would make then more employable.

More serious crimes required an element of punishment in an environment away from older prisoners, followed by education to reform their ways. The power to set up such an establishment was given in the Youthful Offenders Act 1854 (the Reformatory Schools Act). This provided financial assistance and support for reformatory schools as an alternative to prison. Industrial schools were regularised three years later by the Industrial Schools Act 1857.

In Australia, reform schools were established by the &quot;Neglected and Criminal Children Act 1864&quot;, which provided for children who came under state guardianship. In theory, children who were considered &#x27;neglected&#x27; were sent to an industrial school, while those who had broken the law were sent to a reformatory. In practice however, older children tended to be sent to reformatories and younger ones to industrial schools, with little regard as to why they had been committed. The over-crowding and insanitary conditions of these schools, combined with poor diets and overwork, caused terrible health problems. Contagious disease was a big problem, particularly measles and eye diseases. The reform school system came to an end on 1887, due to public pressure, and government shifted its focus towards the use of foster homes.

In the 1950s and 1960s, many of the same problems that had occurred with the former system of incarcerating juveniles along with adults began to be noticed in reform school — older juveniles exploiting the younger ones, sexually and otherwise, and the younger ones taking the more hardened, usually older offenders as role models and mentors. Also, the term &quot;reform school&quot; itself, originally intended as destigmatizing, had developed its own stigma.

==Modern view==
Today, no state openly or officially refers to its juvenile correctional institutions as &quot;reform schools&quot;, although such institutions still exist. The attempt has also been made to reduce the population of such institutions to the maximum extent possible, and to leave all but the most incorrigible youths in a home setting. Also, in an attempt to make the situation more socially normal, and in response to the rising number of young female offenders, many such institutions have been made coeducational.

The current approach involves minimizing the use of custodial institutions and the maximization of the use of less-restrictive settings which allow the youths to remain in their own homes, usually while attending during the daytime an institution called an alternative school or something similar, which is usually a more-structured version of a public school. There may be court-monitored probation or other restrictions, such as a strict curfew applied to the clientele of the &quot;Department of Youth Services&quot; or whatever the state terms it, than for other youths the same age.

In the United States, the most well-known facilities meeting the general criteria for being colloquially labelled &quot;reform schools&quot; include the Lincoln Hills School near Merrill, Wisconsin and the Preston School of Industry in Ione, California. The first publicly funded reform school in the United States was the State Reform School for Boys in Westborough, Massachusetts. It opened in 1848.

In Denmark, continuation high schools continue to be used as reform schools as they are much cheaper than youth detention centers, while the success rates are much the same. Today, there are no national guidelines regarding the severity of the crimes with which the children are charged; nor are there any guidelines in place to assist in the decision to send them to reform school in the first place, since each town or jurisdiction has its own bylaws and budgets. Children charged with making bomb threats end up in such places.

<doc id="873835" wikidata="Q3607549" url="?curid=873835" title="Al TV">
<text>Al TV is an American comedy television series created by and starring singer-songwriter &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic that aired as periodic specials on MTV and VH1, beginning in 1984.

==Overview==
The premise of the show is that Yankovic uses his private satellite transmitter to commandeer the airwaves of a music video station in order to show the videos that &quot;he&quot; wants to watch.

The program is primarily a parody of MTV itself, including that of MTV&#x27;s Moon landing image sequence. As its theme music, the series featured a re-recording of MTV&#x27;s own theme at the time, featuring Yankovic on accordion and manualist &quot;Musical Mike&quot; Kieffer. The show features commercials for imaginary products, fake interviews with celebrities, comments on the latest music news, letters from fans, and bizarre &quot;non sequiturs&quot;. For fake interviews, the show edits footage from unrelated outside interviews and manipulates it such that Al appears to be interviewing the celebrity in a silly or mocking way.

&quot;Al TV&quot;″s main focus is music videos, especially his own, as well as others of an unusual or surreal comedy nature. As the series was conceived as a straight parody of the then-fledgling MTV network, early &quot;Al TV&quot; episodes featured music videos from popular artists of the time, including Peter Gabriel, David Bowie, and The Rolling Stones; these were eventually phased out. Al&#x27;s own work consists of song parodies and &quot;cover polkas&quot;, which essentially edit together the videos from the original artists with Al&#x27;s music and vocals synchronized to the video segments. Al occasionally uses this tactic for certain song parodies for which no video was made.

Clips from &quot;Al TV&quot;, mainly fake interviews, are shown during costume changes in Yankovic&#x27;s live shows. Yankovic&#x27;s 1985 &quot;documentary&quot; &quot;The Compleat Al&quot; also included clips from &quot;AL TV&quot;.

==Episode list==
Ten episodes have been produced, the first eight specials on MTV, the last two on VH1:
* &quot;Al TV&quot; #1 – &quot;In 3-D&quot;; April 1, 1984; four hours
* &quot;Al TV&quot; #2 – &quot;In 3-D&quot;; September 3, 1984; four hours
* &quot;Al TV&quot; #3 – &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot;; July 7, 1985; four hours
* &quot;Al TV&quot; #4 – &quot;Polka Party!&quot;; February 3, 1987; two hours
* &quot;Al TV&quot; #5 – &quot;Even Worse&quot;; April 20, 1988; two hours
* &quot;Al TV&quot; #6 – &quot;Off the Deep End&quot;; April 26, 1992; three hours, plus a one-hour sneak peek
* &quot;Al TV&quot; #7 – &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot;; May 23, 1996; two hours
* &quot;Al TV&quot; #8 &quot;(Al 2K)&quot; – &quot;Running with Scissors&quot;; December 4, 1999; two hours
* &quot;Al TV&quot; #9 – &quot;Poodle Hat&quot;; June 17, 2003; one hour
* &quot;Al TV&quot; #10 – &quot;Straight Outta Lynwood&quot;; December 15, 2006; one hour

In addition, Yankovic appeared as a guest VJ on MTV on February 22, 1984, using much the same format he would later use on &quot;Al TV&quot;.

==Canadian spinoff: &quot;Al Music&quot;==
A similar installment of shows hosted by Yankovic were broadcast in Canada, under the name &quot;Al Music&quot;, which aired on Canada&#x27;s MuchMusic network to concurrently promote the release of 3 of his albums in the 1990s. Similar to &quot;Al TV&quot;, &quot;Al Music&quot; also featured Yankovic commandeering the network broadcast, but this was achieved by visiting MuchMusic&#x27;s studio unannounced, forcibly removing the scheduled VJ on-air &amp; replacing them with himself in order to show the videos that &quot;he&quot; wanted to watch. He also incorporated the same parodying of the music station format through fake interviews with celebrities, comments on the latest music news, letters from fans, airing music videos strewn with Yankovic voice-overs making wisecracks and humorous observational comments about their content, and bizarre non-sequiturs that were incorporated in &quot;Al TV&quot;.

===Episode list===
*&quot;Al Music&quot; – &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; (removed VJ Steve Anthony); 1992
*&quot;Al Music 2&quot; – &quot;Alapalooza&quot; (removed VJ Steve Anthony); 1993
*&quot;Al Music 3&quot; – &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot; (removed VJ Bill Welychka); 1996

<doc id="873836" wikidata="Q2568036" url="?curid=873836" title="Kirby's Pinball Land">
<text>Kirby&#x27;s Pinball Land is a 1993 pinball video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. It was HAL Laboratory&#x27;s third pinball video game after the MSX and NES title &quot;Rollerball&quot; and the Game Boy title &quot;Revenge of the &#x27;Gator&quot;. It was also the first spin-off and second Game Boy title in the &quot;Kirby&quot; series, as well as the second pinball video game Nintendo published after the NES title &quot;Pinball&quot;. The game was rereleased on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console service in July 2012.

The game stars Kirby as the ball, while it features three pinball tables, each owned by a classic boss of the &quot;Kirby&quot; series: Whispy Woods, Kracko, and Poppy Bros.

==Gameplay==
The game is played much like that of pinball, with two flippers used to help keep Kirby in play as he bounces off walls, bumpers, and enemies, scoring points by doing so. Defeating certain enemies earns bonus points and multipliers, which combine to provide a bonus at the end of each life. Players can also earn Maxim Tomatoes which helps block the drain for a short period. The game is made up of three tables; Whispy Woods, Kracko, and Poppy Bros, each made up of three floors. The game aims to help Kirby make his way up to the top floor in order to access each table&#x27;s boss.

Each floor has various gimmicks that either help Kirby to reach the next floor, such as characters that throw Kirby upwards or bring in a Warp Star that Kirby can hop onto. Warp Stars on the bottom floor take Kirby to the table selection screen, Warp Stars on the middle floor takes Kirby to a minigame, where he can earn extra points and multipliers, and Warp Stars on the top floor take Kirby to that table&#x27;s boss fight. Each boss fight requires the player to deal a certain number of hits to the boss without hitting the Warp Star at the bottom and returning to the top screen. After defeating all three bosses, players then fight against King Dedede. After defeating Dedede, the player can play the three tables again to aim for a higher score.

If Kirby falls down the drain on the bottom floor of each table, he will land on a springboard. By timing the A button at the moment where the springboard is at its lowest, Kirby can spring back up to the table, with well-timed presses returning him to the top floor. However, the springboard becomes smaller with each use, making it more difficult to successfully spring back up. If Kirby fails to jump back into the table, the player will lose a life, with the game ending once the player has run out of lives. Extra lives can be earned by spelling out the word &#x27;Extra&#x27; with letters that appear on the table selection screen after bosses have been defeated.

==Reception==
In the United Kingdom, it was the top-selling Game Boy game for two months in 1994, from March to April.

&quot;Kirby&#x27;s Pinball Land&quot; was met mostly positive reception. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave it a 7.25 out of 10. They criticized that the blurring of the Game Boy screen makes it difficult to see what&#x27;s going on, but nonetheless deemed it &quot;one of the better pinball games for any system&quot; due to the ability to recover lost balls, the multi-table gameplay, and the large number of hidden things to find. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked &quot;Kirby’s Pinball Land&quot; the fifth best Game Boy game of 1993.

===Retrospective===
Retrospectively, it holds an average score of 70% at GameRankings. In a retrospective review, &quot;IGN&quot; praised it as a quality Game Boy pinball game, describing it as being both involving and fun. &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Pinball Land&quot; was one of the nominees for &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;Game Boy Action Game of the Century&quot; Reader&#x27;s Choice award. &quot;1UP.com&quot; commented that &quot;Spin-offs are a groan-inducing inevitability for popular series, but &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Pinball Land&quot; is one of those ideas that just make good sense.&quot; The engine used in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Pinball Land&quot; would later be used in another Nintendo game, &quot;Pokémon Pinball&quot;. &quot;Super Gamer Magazine&quot; gave the Game an overall review score of 85% writing: &quot;Highly playable pinball game with loads of levels and bonuses. Screen blurs slightly, but this doesn’t make it any less fun.&quot; Philip J. Reed of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; was more negative, criticizing the repetitive gameplay and poor implementation of &quot;Kirby&quot; series elements, as well as its frequent disruption of gameplay.

<text>Mike Grell (born September 13, 1947) is an American comic book writer and artist, known for his work on books such as &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot;, &quot;The Warlord&quot;, and &quot;Jon Sable Freelance&quot;.

==Early life==
Grell studied at the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay, the Chicago Academy of Fine Art, and took the Famous Artists School correspondence course in cartooning. To avoid getting drafted into Army service during the Vietnam War, he enlisted for four years in the U.S. Air Force, including a stint as illustrator in Saigon. After the Air Force, Grell enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Fine Art, and also worked as a freelance graphics artist.

==Career==
Grell entered the comics industry as an assistant to Dale Messick on the &quot;Brenda Starr&quot; comic strip in 1972.

===DC Comics===
In 1973 Grell moved to New York City, and began his long relationship with DC Comics. At DC, Grell worked on characters such as Aquaman, Batman, Green Arrow, and the Phantom Stranger in arcs or single-issue stories. He and Elliot S. Maggin launched the &quot;Batman Family&quot; title in 1975 and Grell would work with Dennis O&#x27;Neil on the revival of the &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; series the following year. For a time between 1976 and 1978, Grell was writing and penciling one series, Warlord, and providing pencil art on two others, Green Lantern and Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes.

===&quot;Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;===
His regular first assignment at DC was on &quot;Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;, a high-profile assignment for an artist with no prior experience illustrating a monthly comic book. Grell says he got that job because he was walking in the editor&#x27;s door to ask for work, literally, as the previous artist, Dave Cockrum, was walking out the door, having just quit. Grell inked a Cockrum penciled story (&quot;Lost: A Million Miles from Home!&quot;) in issue #202 and became the penciler of the book with issue No. 203 (August 1974) which featured the death of Invisible Kid. These stories were written by Cary Bates with later issues by Jim Shooter. Grell drew &quot;All-New Collectors&#x27; Edition&quot; #C-55 (1978), a treasury-sized special written by Paul Levitz in which longtime Legion members Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad were married.

===&quot;The Warlord&quot;===
A writer as well as artist, Grell cemented his status as a fan-favorite with his best-known creation, &quot;The Warlord&quot;. The character first appeared in &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; No. 8 (Nov. 1975) and was soon given his own ongoing title (&quot;The Warlord&quot; #1, Jan/Feb 1976). In this series, Air Force pilot Travis Morgan crash-lands in the prehistoric &quot;hidden world&quot; of Skartaris (a setting highly influenced by Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;A Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; and Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; Pellucidar). For years thereafter, Morgan engages in adventures dressed only in a winged helmet, wristbands, boots, and breechclout, and armed with a sword and a .44 Auto Mag. Grell wrote himself and editor Jack C. Harris into the metafictional conclusion of the story in &quot;The Warlord&quot; #35 (July 1980). Other artists took over pencil duties, while Sharon Grell, as revealed in the letter column of a later issue, took over writing.

===&quot;Tarzan&quot;===
Grell wrote and drew the &quot;Tarzan&quot; comic strip from July 19, 1981, to February 27, 1983 (except for one strip, February 13, 1983, by Thomas Yeates). These strips were rerun in newspapers in 2004 – 2005.

===First Comics: &quot;Jon Sable Freelance&quot; and &quot;Starslayer&quot;===
Through the 1980s Grell developed creator-owned titles such &quot;Jon Sable Freelance&quot; and &quot;Starslayer&quot;. &quot;Jon Sable Freelance&quot; was published by the now-defunct First Comics. &quot;Starslayer&quot;, a space-born science fiction series, started at Pacific Comics, but shifted to First after Pacific went out of business.

The titular character of &quot;Jon Sable Freelance&quot; was a former Olympic athlete, later an African big-game hunter, who became a mercenary. First appearing with a cover date of June 1983, &quot;Jon Sable&quot; was a precursor to what would eventually be called, by some, &quot;the Dark Age of Comics&quot;, when even long-established super-heroes would become increasingly grim and violent.

The character was heavily influenced by Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond novels as well as drawing on pulp fiction crime stories. Many of the stories of Sable&#x27;s hunting exploits in Africa were influenced by Peter Hathaway Capstick&#x27;s novels. At a convention in the late 1980s, Grell stated that his idea for Sable was &quot;something like a cross between James Bond and Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer&quot;.

Sable was adapted into a short-lived television series and the character&#x27;s origin tale, &quot;A Storm Over Eden&quot;, from the comic book, was expanded and novelized by Grell under the title &quot;Sable&quot;, which was published in 2000 by Tor Books.

===Back at DC: Green Arrow===
In 1987, Mike Grell wrote and drew the three-issue prestige format limited series &quot;Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters&quot;. He redesigned the character&#x27;s costume, away from the costume Neal Adams had designed in 1969, and recast Green Arrow as an &quot;urban hunter&quot; going up against non-super-powered, real world villains such as serial killers, terrorists, street gangs, American mobsters and Japanese Yakuza. He did away with Green Arrow&#x27;s arsenal of &quot;trick arrows&quot; and instead rearmed him with penetrating broadheads with which he actually killed his opponents. &quot;The Longbow Hunters&quot; showed the first instance in which Green Arrow ever deliberately killed someone.

The popularity of &quot;Longbow Hunters&quot; led to an assignment writing – and occasionally drawing – an ongoing &quot;Green Arrow&quot; series for 80 issues from 1988 to 1993. During this run, Grell avoided references to the fantastical elements of the DC Universe (e.g., in a guest appearance by Green Lantern the character is out of costume and does not use his powers). Notably, believing &quot;Green Arrow&quot; was &quot;a stupid name&quot;, in no Mike Grell Green Arrow story (with the exception of &quot;Longbow Hunters&quot; #1) is the character ever referred to as Green Arrow anywhere other than on the cover.

Grell would write a retelling of Green Arrow&#x27;s origin and first case in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; vol. 2 #38 (March 1989). He was the co-writer/cover artist for &quot;Green Arrow Annual&quot; (1991), drew the cover art for &quot;Annual&quot; #5 (1992), and wrote &quot;Annual&quot; #6 (1993). Grell wrote and illustrated the official Post-Crisis origin of Green Arrow in &quot;Green Arrow: The Wonder Year&quot; miniseries in 1993.

In 1988, Grell had a run writing Blackhawk in the short-lived anthology series &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot;, writing the Blackhawk serial from issues #601–608.

===James Bond===
In 1988, Grell wrote and illustrated the graphic novel adaptation of the Timothy Dalton James Bond film &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, and in 1989 wrote and drew an original Bond story, the three-issue mini-series &quot;Permission to Die&quot;, both co-published by Acme Press and Eclipse Comics.

===&quot;Shaman&#x27;s Tears&quot; and &quot;Bar Sinister&quot;===
&quot;Shaman&#x27;s Tears&quot; was a more ecologically themed outing for Grell. Main character Joshua Brand, the son of a half-Sioux father and an Irish mother, as an adult returns to the reservation he ran away from as a child. Discovering he mystically possesses the powers of all animals and the Earth itself, he becomes the protector of the planet. Jon Sable guest starred in issues #5–9 of this 12 issue series (May 1993 – Aug 1995). There was a number 0 issue published in November 1995.

Grell wrote and drew the covers, but did none of the interior artwork, for issues #1–4 of the &quot;Shaman&#x27;s Tears&quot; spinoff series &quot;Bar Sinister&quot; (June – September 1995) from Windjammer, the creator-owned imprint of Valiant Comics. This series followed the adventures of a group of escaped government experimental subjects, animals genetically engineered to human intelligence and, basically, human form, as potential bio-weapons.

During this time period, Grell began work writing and penciling the unfinished and unpublished &quot;Shaman&#x27;s Tears&quot;/&quot;Turok Dinosaur Hunter&quot; cross-over limited series for Valiant Comics. He did co-write the two issue Turok limited series entitled &quot;Turok The Hunted&quot;, as well as several fill-in issues of the ongoing &quot;Turok&quot; series.

===2000s===

From 2002 to 2003, Grell worked on &quot;Iron Man&quot;. It was during a Grell written story from this period that Tony Stark revealed his secret identity to the world, a development met with mixed fan reaction.

After his work on &quot;Iron Man&quot;, Grell came back to comics in 2008, providing a variant incentive cover for &quot;Action Comics&quot; #861, part four of the &quot;Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; story. DC sought variant drawings for this story from artists who had worked on the Legion in the past, such as Steve Lightle, Keith Giffen, and Grell.

Other work includes a new ongoing series of &quot;The Warlord&quot; launched to coincide with the 35th anniversary. Grell brought the lead character&#x27;s story to an end and drew some issues. Grell worked for Marvel drawing some stories of &quot;X-Men Forever&quot;. His last collaboration with DC to date has been the Green Lantern story for the &quot;DC Retroactive&quot; series, in 2011, where he provided the art.

Grell is rewriting the &quot;Jon Sable&quot; screenplay, working on an adaptation of &quot;Shaman&#x27;s Tears&quot;, and writing two stories for ComicMix.com, a new Jon Sable story and &quot;The Pilgrim&quot; with Mark Ryan. In December 2010 he was announced as editor-in-chief of Ardden Entertainment.

In 2012, Grell provided the cover art for the 10-page preview comic produced by DC Comics for the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con to promote the TV series &quot;Arrow&quot;. Grell did interior art for issues #6 and #11 of the digital comic based on the TV series.

==Personal life==
In the 1980s, Grell was married to Sharon Wright. She ghost-wrote the last two years of &quot;The Warlord&quot;, while Grell concentrated his efforts on &quot;Starslayer&quot;; &quot;Jon Sable, Freelance&quot;; and the weekly &quot;Tarzan&quot; Sunday comic strip.

==Awards==
Mike Grell received an Inkpot Award in 1982.

<text>Anatoly Semyonovich Levchenko (; May 5, 1941 – August 6, 1988) was a Soviet cosmonaut in the Buran programme.

Trained as a test pilot and selected as a cosmonaut on 12 July 1980, Levchenko was planned to be the back-up commander of the first Buran space shuttle flight. As part of his preparations, he also accomplished test-flights with Buran&#x27;s counterpart OK-GLI aircraft.

In March 1987, Levchenko began extensive training for a Soyuz spaceflight, intended to give him some experience in space. In December 1987, he occupied the third seat aboard the spacecraft Soyuz TM-4 to the space station Mir, and returned to Earth about a week later on Soyuz TM-3. His mission is sometimes called Mir LII-1, after the Gromov Flight Research Institute shorthand.

In the year following his spaceflight, Anatoly Levchenko died of a brain tumor, in the Nikolay Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute in Moscow. 

He was married with one child.

==Awards==
He was awarded the titles of Hero of the Soviet Union and Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR and the Order of Lenin.

==Commemoration==
* Anatoly Levchenko is buried at the Bykovskoye Memorial Cemetery in Zhukovsky.

<doc id="873851" wikidata="Q5656138" url="?curid=873851" title="Harding University">
<text>Harding University is a private Christian university with its main campus in Searcy, Arkansas, United States. Established in 1924, the institution offers undergraduate, graduate, and pre-professional programs. The university also includes a graduate school of theology, located in Memphis, Tennessee, which was formerly known as Harding Graduate School of Religion. Harding is one of several institutions of higher learning associated with the Churches of Christ.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===

Harding College was founded in Morrilton, Arkansas, in April 1924 after the merging of two separate colleges: Arkansas Christian College of Morrilton, Arkansas, and Harper College of Harper, Kansas. It was named after James A. Harding, a minister and educator associated with Churches of Christ.

After Galloway Female College merged with Hendrix College in 1933, Harding College purchased Galloway&#x27;s Searcy, Arkansas campus for a fraction of its estimated value and moved there in 1934.

=== Cold War ===
Harding University first advocated pacifism and political disengagement, in line with its own founding influences like James A. Harding and David Lipscomb as well as with wider trends in many other evangelical Christian movements during late 19th- and early 20th-century America. This trajectory shifted during the Cold War, however. Harding became involved in the production of a series of animated cartoons extolling the virtues of free-market capitalism. This series, including &quot;Make Mine Freedom&quot; (1948) as well as &quot;Meet King Joe&quot; (1949), were all produced by John Sutherland Productions as part of a concerted campaign to fight against the threats of communism at the beginning of the Cold War using popular media. Funding came from Alfred P. Sloan, the major figure at General Motors Corporation. The animations contrast mainstream American values with the values of Soviet communism. The initiative represented a central concern of Harding president George S. Benson, who believed that fighting socialism was a moral imperative.

=== National Education Program ===

Early in his career, President Benson established the National Education Program to advocate the principles of belief in God, the constitution, and free enterprise, within an &quot;Americanism&quot; program. The NEP coordinated speaking engagements and produced and distributed reprints of Benson&#x27;s speeches and newspaper columns, short films by a former Walt Disney employee, and other media. This program attracted many donations to Harding, including from Boeing and Gulf Oil. The NEP was initially part of the school&#x27;s education department, and later the history department, where it was intertwined with the American Studies Program. Clifton Ganus Jr. and James D. Bales were also heavily involved.

NEP materials were used nationwide by groups such as the U.S. armed forces, public schools, colleges and universities, chapters of the American Legion, and local chambers of commerce. Some uses became controversial: Some companies required their employees to attend NEP-sponsored seminars and enclosed copies of Benson&#x27;s lectures with their paychecks in hopes of addressing perceived restlessness. The Fulbright Memorandum of June 1961 raised concerns about use of NEP materials in the military. The NEP was charged with being a &quot;Radical Right&quot; organization in the 1964 book &quot;Danger on the Right&quot;, which Bales responded to in his 1965 book &quot;Americanism under Fire&quot;. The close relationship between Harding and the NEP delayed the college&#x27;s accreditation until 1954 when the school incorporated it as a separate entity, although Benson, Ganus, and Bales continued their involvement and the NEP board was nearly identical to the college&#x27;s. In the 1970s, the program dwindled in notoriety and moved to Oklahoma Christian College. The American Studies Institute continues as a legacy of this program.

=== Race relations ===

==== Segregation ====
During segregation in the United States, the school remained racially segregated for most of the tenure of president George S. Benson, who defended Harding&#x27;s delay in integrating. Benson believed Black people were inferior because they fell under the Curse of Ham. In 1957, student body president Bill Floyd circulated a &quot;statement of attitude&quot; that Harding was ready to integrate, and it was signed by over 75% of the students, faculty, and staff of the college. In response Benson made an address entitled titled &quot;Harding College and the Colored Problem&quot;, in which he put down the idea of integration as youthful idealism, and insisted that students should defer to the judgment of older people with more experience, such as the Harding board of trustees.

He went further, stating that Black people were far better off in the US than in other countries, and that integration would result in destruction of property, the spread of venereal diseases, and increased pregnancies. He also stated that mixed marriages would lead to broken homes and a rise in crime. Benson maintained that mixing of the races was against the divine order. In 1953, Norman Adamson became the first black person accepted to Harding. However, when administrators learned he was black he was denied admission.

In 1963, three black students were admitted to the Searcy campus, making Harding the second private institution in Arkansas to admit black people. In a 2012 article, it was suggested that this decision was motivated by expectation that the coming Civil Rights Act would require &quot;Harding to desegregate to continue receiving federal funds&quot;, but contemporary sources make no mention of this as a consideration: The Gazette applauded Harding&#x27;s &quot;voluntary action&quot; as an &quot;example&quot; for other Arkansas church-related colleges and deserving an &quot;ovation...for the grace with which they have undertaken this social change&quot;. The Bison proclaimed &quot;Benson&#x27;s leadership in the movement for equal opportunity makes us proud, even boastful; it makes us happy, even ecstatic&quot;, though at least one scholar viewed that statement &quot;dubiously&quot;.

By 1969 Harding had only 20 black students out of a student body of over 2,000. While president Clifton L. Ganus, Jr, stated that he did not &quot;see any Biblical injunction against it&quot;, he discouraged interracial relationships. Under his leadership, the Harding administration allowed students to enter into interracial relationships, but made it policy to caution them against it and informed their parents in writing. The policy of allowing such relationships was the focus of much anger from the families of some white students. In 1969, three black students who protested racism at the university were expelled. In 1969, Ganus attempted to placate students by promising to hire &#x27;Negro&#x27; teachers, but this never transpired.

==== Since the Civil Rights Era ====

In 1980, Richard King became the first African-American faculty member. In the fall of 2019, white students constituted 81 percent of the student body, 4.7% were black students, and 3.8% were Hispanic/Latino.

==== Botham Jean and the Benson Auditorium ====
In 2020, a former graduate organized a petition drive to rename the Benson auditorium because of Benson&#x27;s racist views. The petition also asked that the auditorium carry the name of Botham Jean instead, a recent Black alumnus who had been murdered in his own apartment by a white Dallas police officer who alleged she had confused their apartments and mistaken the 26-year-old for a burglar.

Upon review, but against the wishes of the Black Student Association, the university, under the leadership of Bruce McLarty, defended Benson and chose to retain the name. However, President McLarty recognized the university had no buildings or landmarks on campus that recognized Black Alumni and promised some sort of memorial to Botham Jean within a year.

Facing this controversy and a 23% decline in enrollment over 5 years, the board dismissed McLarty, with former president David Burks resuming control. Michael D. Williams became president June 2022.

== Campus ==
=== Searcy ===
The Searcy campus comprises 48 buildings located on near the center of Searcy. The campus lies roughly between Race Avenue and Beebe-Capps Expressway and includes several other minor thoroughfares, the campus of Harding Academy, Harding Place (a retirement community), and portions of surrounding neighborhoods.

The campus includes the George S. Benson Auditorium, which sits facing the McInteer Bible and World Missions Center. Brackett Library, the American Studies Building (Education and English departments), the David B. Burks American Heritage Building (hotel and offices), Pattie Cobb Hall, and the Administration Building frame a grassy central commons area upon which can be found several paths, a fountain, and a bell tower made out of bricks from the institution that once stood there: Galloway Female College.

Recent additions have included several dormitories; expansions of the cafeteria, student center, art department, and the David B. Burks American Heritage Building. The McInteer Bible and World Missions Center, was built in a project that included closing a road and creating a pedestrian mall.

After competing in the Ganus Athletic Center from 1976 until 2006, Harding&#x27;s volleyball and basketball teams moved back to the Rhodes-Reaves Field House. The field house is a round-topped airplane hangar built for France in WWII, and purchased as war surplus by George S. Benson. It was reconstructed on campus in 1947. In 2007, it was retrofitted to accentuate the acoustics of the facility, working to the advantage of the home teams. The campus also has intramural sports facilities, including an indoor facility built for the Harding Bison football team in 2019.

=== Noteworthy buildings ===
The Dean L.C. Sears House, named for the first dean of Harding University, was a historic house registered in the National Register of Historic Places. Also on the registry is Pattie Cobb Hall.

The Reynolds Center was created through and named for philanthropist Donald W. Reynolds.

=== Satellite campuses and campuses abroad ===
The university maintains satellite campuses in Arkansas, one in North Little Rock and a second in Rogers.

Harding maintains permanent campuses in Florence and Athens. Study abroad semester programs are also provided in Brisbane, London, Paris, Arequipa (Peru), and Kalomo (Zambia).

== Academics ==

=== Organization ===
Structurally, the university comprises nine separate colleges: the College of Allied Health, the College of Arts &amp; Humanities, the College of Bible &amp; Ministry, the Paul R. Carter College of Business Administration, the Cannon-Clary College of Education, the Carr College of Nursing, the College of Pharmacy, the College of Sciences, and the Honors College. Each college then has its own subdivisions of departments or other sections. The university also has a School of Theology in Memphis. Between these nine colleges, the university provides ninety-seven majors, ten undergraduate degrees, fourteen pre-professional programs, and twenty-one graduate and professional degrees.

====American Studies Institute====
In 1953, Harding established the School of American Studies as an extension of President Benson&#x27;s National Education Program in order to teach and train students in the founding principles of the United States Constitution. Rebranded the American Studies Institute (ASI), the center supplements students&#x27; academic training and promotes &quot;a complete understanding of the institutions, values, and ideas of liberty and democracy.&quot; In doing so, the ASI exhibits a generally conservative political stance, focused on going &quot;back to the fundamental values that made this country great.&quot;

=== Distinctions and rankings ===
Harding supports a chapter of Kappa Omicron Nu, a national honor society for colleges and universities with a strong humanities program. The university was distinguished through the National Historic Chemical Landmarks program of the American Chemical Society for its contribution to the history of chemistry, which came for its William-Miles History of Chemistry Collection, established in 1992.

Harding University was listed among the Top Twenty Schools nationwide by the Wall Street Journal and Times Higher Education under two different categories in 2017: student engagement and student inspiration. Harding consistently ranks in the Top 50 for Best Regional Universities in the South according to the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. In 2020, it ranked #349 among national universities overall. It was also rated at B by the American rankings and review company Niche.

Harding is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Specific colleges and programs have received further accreditation by specialized agencies as well.

== Student life ==

===Athletics===
Harding has competed in the NCAA at the Division II level since 1997, beginning in the Lone Star Conference moving in 2000 to the Gulf South Conference and then moving to the newly formed Great American Conference (GAC) in 2011. Men&#x27;s sports include Soccer, Baseball, Basketball, Cross Country, Football, Golf, Tennis, and Track and Field. Women&#x27;s sports include Basketball, Cheerleading, Cross Country, Golf, Soccer, Softball, Tennis, Track and Field, and Volleyball.

The facilities for the sporting events are: First Security Stadium, Ganus Activities Complex, Stevens Soccer Complex, Jerry Moore Field (baseball), Berry Family Grandstand (softball), Harding Tennis Complex, and the Rhodes-Reaves Field House. On October 19, 2019, the new indoor football facility was dedicated in honor of longtime football head coach Ronnie Huckeba. The Huckeba Field House is the largest indoor practice facility in NCAA Division II and one of the largest in the country for any level. Harding won the Division II national championship in football in 2023.

===Spring Sing===
Spring Sing is an annual musical production held during Easter Weekend, featuring performances by the social clubs. It is widely attended by current and prospective students, alumni, and Searcy residents. An estimated 12,000 people attended the show each year. Each year, an overall theme is selected, and each club develops music and choreographed routines for the show. Rehearsals begin as early as January. Spring Sing also typically features two hosts, two hostesses, and a general song and choreography ensemble, with these roles chosen by audition. The ensemble performs to music played by the University Jazz Band. Each club act is judged and, according to their performance, awarded a certain sum of money. The clubs then donate this money to charities of their choice.

=== Student-run media ===
The Department of Communications runs the state radio station KVHU.

Alongside publications of the university itself, such as the alumni newsletter &quot;Harding Magazine&quot; and the yearbook &quot;The Petit Jean&quot;, students produce their own periodical during the academic year called &quot;The Bison&quot;. This student-run publication is printed in nine issues per semester and made available through its multimedia website &quot;The Link&quot;.

In 2011 a group of LGBTQ students at Harding, known as &quot;HU Queer Press&quot;, produced a Zine called &quot;State of the Gay&quot; whose website was blocked by the university. A statement from university officials at the time said that &quot;university administrators felt that having this website available on campus goes against [our] mission and policies&quot;. President David Burks called the publication &quot;offensive and degrading&quot;. As a result of this decision by the administration, the controversy received attention from national newspapers like &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and online platforms like &quot;Jezebel&quot; and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;.

In 2018, HU Queer Press 2.0 was launched, with members producing a zine titled &quot;Hear Queer Voices&quot; aiming to &quot;foster a relationship between Harding University and the queer community&quot;. In April 2022, HU Queer Press 3.0 was announced, with members releasing a zine titled &quot;Look Around&quot;, requesting &quot;that Harding University fully acknowledge, affirm, and protect its LGBT students&quot;.

=== Social clubs ===
The university sponsors student-led &quot;social clubs&quot; that serve a similar social networking function to the Greek system, as Harding prohibits formation of local chapters of national social fraternities and sororities. (One exception is Delta Phi, a chapter of Pi Sigma Epsilon). Currently there are 14 women&#x27;s social clubs and 15 men&#x27;s social clubs at Harding.

Most of these organizations have adopted Greek letter names that are similar to national fraternity and sorority names. Social clubs are open to all academically eligible students and serve as some of the university&#x27;s most visible student-led organizations. The clubs are a prominent part of student life with slightly more than half of all undergraduate students participating as social club members.

The social club induction process begins when clubs host &quot;receptions&quot; in the fall to recruit new members. The membership process culminates in Club Week, when each prospective member bonds with the other members of the club through a series of scheduled activities throughout the week. Once a student is accepted into the club, they attend biweekly meetings and can participate in club-sponsored sports, service projects, and Spring Sing.

==== Hazing controversy ====
Harding&#x27;s social clubs have been involved in hazing controversies over the years. As a result, some have been forced to disband, including the Seminoles (2010), Kappa Sigma Kappa (2005), Mohicans (1981), and most recently Pi Kappa Epsilon (2015).

== Religious conduct and policies ==
Students at Harding University are expected to maintain the highest standards of Christian morality, integrity, orderliness and personal honor. Harding reserves the right to refuse admittance or dismiss any student whose lifestyle is not consistent with the Christian principles that Harding represents.

=== Employment ===
The Faculty Handbook, with narrow exceptions, requires Churches of Christ membership of all faculty members. All faculty members must affirm as part of an annual evaluation that he or she is a member in good standing of a Church of Christ and attends services weekly.

=== Chapel and Bible classes ===
The university specifies that daily chapel service be held with attendance mandatory for undergraduate students. Chapel programs are &quot;designed to stimulate intellectual, religious, social or aesthetic development,&quot; in accordance with the university&#x27;s mission of combining &quot; faith, learning and living.&quot; Excessive absences from daily chapel service may result in disciplinary action.

Harding requires each student enrolled in nine or more hours to regularly attend one Bible class that meets at least three hours a week each semester. Attendance is mandatory, and nonattendance may result in suspension from the university. The university requires students and faculty to dress professionally when attending class, chapel, lyceum, and American Studies programs.

=== Alcohol and substance use ===
The consumption, possession or storage of alcoholic beverages of any kind is prohibited at Harding University. This prohibition includes on-campus or off-campus locations. Violation of this policy will result in suspension from the university. White County, Arkansas, where Harding is located, is a dry county. The use of nicotine in any form is not permitted at any time, including use of electronic cigarettes or vaporizers. Harding also forbids the use, possession, distribution, or sale of drugs or drug-related paraphernalia.

=== Student living ===
Single undergraduate students, under the age of 22, are required to live on campus, with limited exceptions. Visiting in the residence of a single member of the opposite sex, even though others are present, without permission from a student life dean, is prohibited. Staying overnight in a residence, motel, hotel, or any such arrangement with a member of the opposite sex, without permission from a student life dean, will result in suspension, although explicit sexual immorality may not have been observed.

Students are not to visit &quot;inappropriate&quot; places of entertainment such as dance clubs or bars. Students are not allowed to participate in suggestive or social dancing.

All-campus curfew is from 12:00 a.m. until 5 a.m. Sunday through Thursday and 1:00 a.m. until 5 a.m. Friday and Saturday.

=== Sex and gender ===
Harding explicitly regulates sexual relationships among students and staff. The university explicitly prohibits premarital, extramarital, and homosexual sex.

According to the university&#x27;s student handbook: Harding University holds to the biblical principle that God instituted marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman and that gender identity is given by God and revealed in one&#x27;s birth sex. Students are prohibited from being married to or dating a person of the same sex. Neither may students engage in behavior suggesting a romantic relationship with a person of the same sex. The University further holds to the biblical principle that sexual relationships outside the context of marriage are unacceptable to God and immoral. Sexual immorality in any form will result in suspension from the University. Harding also forbids the &quot;unwelcome or inappropriate emphasizing of sexual identity.&quot;

In 2017, it was granted an exception to Title IX, which allows for legal discrimination against LGBTQ+ students on religious grounds. Harding has been listed among the &quot;Absolute Worst Campuses for LGBTQ Youth&quot; in the US by Campus Pride.

<doc id="873853" wikidata="Q3238402" url="?curid=873853" title="Lifesaving Medal">
<text>The Gold Lifesaving Medal and Silver Lifesaving Medal are U.S. decorations issued by the United States Coast Guard. The awards were established by Act of Congress, 20 June 1874; later authorized by . These decorations are two of the oldest medals in the United States and were originally established at the Department of Treasury as Lifesaving Medals First and Second Class. The Department of the Treasury initially gave the award, but today the United States Coast Guard awards it through the Department of Homeland Security. They are not classified as military decorations, and may be awarded to any person.

==History==
A British Sea Gallantry Medal for saving life was authorized in 1854. Twenty years later in the United States the Gold and Silver Lifesaving Medals were first authorized in an Act (18 Stat 125, 43rd Congress) that furthered the United States Life-Saving Service. The Secretary of the Treasury was directed, among other provisions of the act, to create &quot;medals of honor&quot;, to be distinguished as life-saving medals of the first and second class, and bestow them upon any persons who endanger their own lives in saving, or endeavoring to save lives from perils of the sea, within the United States, or upon any American vessel.

The Lifesaving Medals have had multiple designs in their history.

* The original LS-5 design in 1874 was &quot;non-portable&quot; and could not be worn by the recipient, but rather displayed much like a trophy. It contained of gold.
* In 1877, the diameter was reduced from to , while the gold content was dropped to to create the LS-7 design.
* In 1882 the design was changed again so that the medal was suspended from a two inch wide ribbon. The ribbon was red for the Gold Lifesaving Medal and light blue for the Silver Lifesaving medal.
* Finally on 4 August 1949 the medals and ribbons were reduced in size so that they were more proportionate to medals awarded by the U.S. Armed Forces. The ribbons were also redesigned to have multiple colors.

The laws governing the awarding of medal were amended over the years, and is currently awarded by the US Coast Guard. The Commandant of the Coast Guard makes the final determination in authorizing the award, but the Lifesaving Medals are not military awards, &quot;per se&quot;, and instead are &quot;Federal Agency personal decorations&quot; of the Department of Homeland Security and as such may be awarded to not only military members, but also civilians.

&quot;The Gold Lifesaving Medal or the Silver Lifesaving Medal may be awarded to any person who rescues or endeavors to rescue any other person from drowning, shipwreck, or other perils of the water. The rescue or attempted rescue must either take place in waters within the U.S. or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or one or the other of the parties must be a citizen of the U.S. or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the U.S.&quot;

The Lifesaving Medal is issued in two grades, being gold and silver. &quot;The Gold Lifesaving Medal may be awarded to an individual who performed a rescue or attempted rescue at the risk of his or her own life, and demonstrates extreme and heroic daring. The Silver Lifesaving Medal may be awarded to an individual who performed a rescue or attempted rescue where the circumstances do not sufficiently distinguish the individual to deserve the medal of gold, but demonstrate such extraordinary effort as to merit recognition. If neither the Gold nor Silver Lifesaving Medal is appropriate, then a Certificate of Valor or an appropriate Coast Guard Public Service Award may be considered.&quot;

Until the mid-20th century, the Lifesaving Medal was often bestowed upon members of the military; however in recent times the decoration has become somewhat rare. This is due primarily to the creation of a variety of additional military decorations that supplant the Lifesaving Medal. The United States Navy often issues the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, instead of the Lifesaving Medal, for sea rescues involving risk of life. &quot;Military personnel serving on active duty would normally not be recommended for Gold and Silver Lifesaving Medals; however, military personnel may be recommended for a Lifesaving Medal if the act of heroism was performed while the individual was in a leave or liberty status. In all other circumstances, a military award should be considered.&quot; While the Lifesaving Medals may be proffered to, and accepted by, DoD personnel, the Medals are no longer authorized for wear on U.S. military uniforms of the DoD Services (Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force, Space Force). Such awards may become part of service records, and used for other purposes, however.

The US Coast Guard, while an armed force and military service at all times, normally is part of the Department of Homeland Security. As such, awards of the DHS may be bestowed directly upon civilians, including US Coast Guard civilian employees and contractors, while recommendations for award of the Lifesaving Medals to US military members will be coordinated with the servicemembers&#x27; parent Service; this provides not only notification to the relevant military commanders that their servicemember(s) were involved in a lifesaving event, but allows the opportunity for that commander to award a Service decoration such as the Soldier&#x27;s Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Medal, Airman&#x27;s Medal, or Coast Guard Medal, instead of the DHS-awarded Lifesaving Medals. Within the Coast Guard, as a non-DoD agency, the gold medal&#x27;s precedence for wear is immediately following the Coast Guard Medal, while the silver medal&#x27;s precedence for wear is immediately following the Air Medal. However, the appropriate precedence for display—but not wear—of the Lifesaving Medals in other Services is among the category of &quot;Federal Agency personal decorations,&quot; directly below the Prisoner of War Medal.

The Lifesaving Medal is unusual among U.S. medals because it is actually struck from the eponymous precious metal, silver or gold.

Multiple awards of the Lifesaving Medal are denoted by award stars on the decoration&#x27;s ribbon and a gold clasp, inscribed with the recipient&#x27;s name, is worn on the actual medal.

Since 1874, more than 600 Gold Lifesaving Medals and more than 1,900 Silver Lifesaving Medals have been awarded.

<doc id="873854" wikidata="Q430996" url="?curid=873854" title="Muhammed Faris">
<text>Muhammed Ahmed Faris (, &quot;Muḥammad ʾAḥmad Fāris&quot;; 26 May 1951 – 19 April 2024) was a Syrian military aviator and astronaut. He was the first Syrian and the second Arab in space.

==Career==
Born in Aleppo, Syria, he was a pilot in the Syrian Air Force with the rank of colonel. He specialized in navigation when he was selected to participate in the Intercosmos spaceflight program on 30 September 1985.

Faris flew as Research Cosmonaut in the Interkosmos program on Soyuz TM-3 to the Mir space station in July 1987, spending 7 days, 23 hours, and 5 minutes in space. He returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TM-2.

Faris is credited with carrying the first recorded Earth dirt into space, which was a vial carrying soil from Damascus.

Faris was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 30 July 1987; he was also awarded the Order of Lenin.

After his spaceflight, Faris returned to the Syrian Air Force and lived in Aleppo.

===Syrian civil war===
On 4 August 2012, during the Syrian civil war, Faris defected from Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s regime and joined the armed opposition.

On 13 September 2012, he had an exclusive interview with Al Aan TV and covered many topics regarding the ongoing civil war in Syria. Faris was also part of the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change, an anti-Assad grouping.

In a March 2016 interview as a Syrian refugee in Turkey, Faris stated regarding the ongoing civil war: &quot;I tell Europe if you don&#x27;t want refugees, then you should help us get rid of this regime,&quot; adding &quot;I am very sorry about the Russian interference, which has stood on the side of dictator Bashar Assad, and has begun to kill the Syrian people with their planes&quot;.

In September 2017, Faris was appointed Defense Minister of the Syrian Interim Government, a self-appointed opposition grouping.

==Personal life==
Faris moved with his family to Turkey in 2012 as a result of the Syrian civil war. He obtained Turkish citizenship in 2020. Faris had five children: four boys and one girl.

==Death==
Faris was admitted to Sanko Hospital in the Turkish province of Gaziantep after a heart attack in March 2024. He died on 19 April 2024 at the age of 72 and was buried in the rebel held city of Azaz in Northern Syria.

<text>The serpent is a low-pitched early wind instrument in the lip-reed family, developed in the Renaissance era. It has a trombone-like mouthpiece, with six tone holes arranged in two groups of three fingered by each hand. It is named for its long, conical bore bent into a snakelike shape, and unlike most brass instruments is made from wood with an outer covering of leather. A distant ancestor of the tuba, the serpent is related to the cornett and was used for bass parts from the 17th to the early 19th centuries.

In the early 19th century, keys were added to improve intonation, and several upright variants were developed and used, until they were superseded first by the ophicleide and ultimately by the valved tuba. After almost entirely disappearing from orchestras, the serpent experienced a renewed interest in historically informed performance practice in the mid-20th century. Several contemporary works have been commissioned and composed, and serpents are again made by a small number of contemporary manufacturers.
The sound of a serpent is somewhere between a bassoon and a euphonium, and it is typically played in a seated position, with the instrument resting upright between the player&#x27;s knees.

== Construction ==

Although closely related to the cornett, the serpent has thinner walls, a more conical bore, and no thumb-hole. The original serpent was typically built from hardwood, usually walnut or other tonewoods like maple, cherry, or pear, or sometimes softer woods like poplar. In France, the instrument was made from bonding two double-S-shaped halves, each carved from a single large piece of wood. In England, it was usually made from several smaller curved tubular wooden segments, each made by gluing two hollowed halves together. The whole instrument was then glued and bound with an outer covering of leather. A small number were made instead from copper or brass; one brass serpent in the Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica in Bologna was built in 1773 with an added outer layer of leather.

The instrument uses a mouthpiece about the same size as a trombone mouthpiece, originally made from ivory, horn or hardwood. The cup profiles of most historical serpent and bass horn mouthpieces were a distinctly hemispherical or ovate bowl shape, with a sharper-edged and narrower &quot;throat&quot; at the bottom of the cup than modern trombone mouthpieces, before expanding more-or-less conically through the shank. The mouthpiece fits into the &quot;bocal&quot; or &quot;crook&quot;, a small length of brass tubing that emerges from the top wooden segment.

The serpent has six tone holes, in two groups of three, fingered by each hand. It is initially challenging to play the instrument with good intonation, due in large part to the positions of the tone holes. They are arranged mainly to be accessible to the player&#x27;s fingers, rather than in acoustically correct positions, which for some of them would be out of reach. The lower tone holes are too small to act effectively to shorten the air column, but by dampening resonances they nevertheless aid note selection and contribute to the serpent&#x27;s characteristic soft . While early serpents were keyless, later instruments added keys for additional holes out of reach of the fingers to improve intonation, and extend range. A mid-19th century model by London instrument maker Thomas Key has 14 keys, and survives in St Fagans National Museum of History in Cardiff, Wales.

Modern replicas are made by several specialist instrument makers, employing acoustic analysis and modern fabrication materials and techniques to further improve the serpent&#x27;s intonation. Some of these techniques include use of modern composite materials and polymers, 3D printing, and changing the placement of tone holes. Swiss serpent maker Stephan Berger in collaboration with French jazz musician Michel Godard has developed an improved serpent based on studying well-preserved museum instruments, and also makes a lightweight model from carbon fibre. English serpent player and musicologist Clifford Bevan remarked that Berger&#x27;s instruments are much improved, finally allowing players to approach the serpent &quot;in partnership rather than in combat&quot;.

=== Sizes ===
The majority of surviving specimens in museums and private collections are nominally built in eight-foot (8′) C, thus having a total tubing length of about . A few slightly smaller specimens were built in D, and military serpents could sometimes vary in pitch between D♭ and B♭.

The &#x27; (or &#x27;; ) arose in the 1960s when English early music specialist and instrument maker Christopher Monk began his efforts to produce modern reproduction serpents by first building a half-sized pattern, which equated to a tenor size in 4′ C. Through a pantographic milling process, he scaled up the pattern by 2× to carve a bass serpent. Since he could just as easily carve at 1×, he was also able to produce tenor serpents popular in serpent ensembles, and usable by players with smaller fingers. The &#x27;, or &#x27;, was built by scaling the tenor serpent by 0.5× to produce an instrument in 2′ C, two octaves higher than the standard serpent. It first appeared in the 1980s, made as a novelty instrument by Monk. There is no repertoire or other evidence of the historical existence of these sizes.
The &#x27;, nicknamed the &#x27; and built in 16′ C one octave below the serpent, was an English invention of the mid-19th century with no historical repertoire. The prototype instrument was built by Joseph and Richard Wood in Huddersfield as a double-sized English military serpent, and survives in the University of Edinburgh museum collection. Its use of keys, progressively larger tone holes, and an open top tone hole make it essentially a serpent-shaped contrabass ophicleide. During the serpent&#x27;s modern revival, two more contrabass serpents were built in the original &quot;serpent ordinaire&quot; form in the 1990s by Christopher Monk&#x27;s workshop, by doubling the pattern for a bass serpent. They were called &quot;George&quot; and &quot;George II&quot;. The first, commissioned by musicologist and serpent player Philip Palmer, was owned by American trombonist and serpent player Douglas Yeo for a time and features in some of his serpent recordings. At least four other contrabass serpents have also been built: one from PVC piping in 1986, two from box plywood based on a &quot;squarpent&quot; design by American serpent player and curator Paul Schmidt, and one in 2014 from spare tuba and sousaphone parts.

== History ==

There is little direct material or documentary evidence for the exact origin of the serpent. French historian Jean Lebeuf claimed in his 1743 work &quot;Mémoires Concernant l&#x27;Histoire Ecclésiastique et Civile d’Auxerre&quot; that the serpent was invented in 1590 by Edmé Guillaume, a clergyman in Auxerre, France, which is generally accepted. Some scholars propose that the serpent may have evolved from large, curved bass cornetts that were in use in Italy in the 16th century, but the lack of knowledge of the serpent in early 17th century Italy, or surviving early serpents outside of France, counts against this idea. The serpent was certainly used in France since the early 17th century, to strengthen the cantus firmus and bass voices of choirs in plainchant. This original traditional serpent was known as the or ().

Around the middle of the 18th century, the serpent began to appear in military bands, chamber ensembles, and later in orchestras. In England, particularly in the south, the serpent was used in west gallery music played in Church of England parish churches and village bands until the mid 19th century.

=== Military serpents ===

Towards the end of the 18th century, the increased popularity of the serpent in military bands drove the subsequent development of the instrument to accommodate marching or mounted players. In England, a distinct &quot;military serpent&quot; was developed which had a more compact shape with tighter curves, added extra keys to improve its intonation, and metal braces between the bends to increase its rigidity and durability.
In France around the same time several makers produced a initially developed by Piffault (by whose name they are also known) that arranges the tubing vertically with an upward turned bell, reminiscent of a tenor saxophone.

=== Upright serpents and bass horns ===

Several vertical configurations of the serpent, generally known as &quot;upright serpents&quot; () or &quot;bass horns&quot;, were developed from the late 18th century. Retaining the same six tone holes and fingering of the original serpent, these instruments resemble the bassoon, with jointed straight tubes that fit into a short U-shaped butt joint, and an upward-pointing bell.

==== Basson russe ====
Among the first of the upright serpents to appear around the turn of the 19th century was the , , although it was neither Russian nor a bassoon. The name is possibly a corruption of since they were taken up by the Prussian army bands of the time. Many of these instruments were built in Lyon and often had the buccin-style decorative zoomorphic bells popular in France at the time, shaped and painted like a dragon or serpent head. Appearing around the same time in military bands was the () which had a normal brass instrument bell, similar in flare to the later ophicleide.

==== English bass horn ====
The &quot;English bass horn&quot;, developed by London-based French musician and inventor Louis Alexandre Frichot in 1799, had an all-metal V-shaped construction, described by German composer Felix Mendelssohn as resembling a watering can. He admired its sound however, and wrote for the instrument in several of his works, including the overture to &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1826) and his fifth &quot;Reformation&quot; symphony (1830), although when the &quot;Overture&quot; was first published, the part was changed to ophicleide for unknown reasons. The bass horn was popular in civic and military bands in Britain and Ireland, and also spread back into orchestras in Europe, where it influenced the inventors of both the ophicleide and later the .

==== Early cimbasso ====
The serpent appears as in early 19th century Italian operatic scores by composers such as Spontini, Rossini, and Bellini. In Italy it was replaced by the &quot;cimbasso&quot;, a loose term that referred to several instruments; initially an upright serpent similar to the &quot;basson russe&quot;, then the ophicleide, early forms of valved tuba (, ), and finally by the time of Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Otello&quot; (1887), a valve contrabass trombone.

==== Other upright serpents ====
In Paris in 1823, Forveille invented his eponymous , an upright serpent with an enlarged bell section influenced by the (then newly invented) ophicleide. It is distinguished by being made from wood, brass tubing being used only for the leadpipe and first bend. It became popular in bands for its improved intonation and sound quality. In 1828 Jean-Baptiste Coëffet patented his &quot;ophimonocleide&quot; (&quot;snake with one key&quot;), one of the last forms of the upright serpent. It solved a perennial problem of the serpent, its difficult and indistinct B♮ notes. The instrument is built a semitone lower in B♮ and adds a large open tone hole that keeps the instrument in C until its key is pressed, closing the tone hole and producing a clear and resonant B♮. The instrument also has a unique , a double tuning slide that (combined with adjusting the bocal) could change the pitch by up to a major second and allow the player to switch between the different pitch standards of the time ( and ).

=== Contemporary revival ===

The era of upright serpents was brief, spanning the first half of the 19th century from their invention to their replacement by the ophicleide and subsequent valved brass instruments. German opera composer Richard Wagner, by the 1869 première of his &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; cycle, was writing his lowest brass parts for tuba and contrabass trombone. Consequently, the serpent had all but disappeared from ensembles by 1900.

The serpent has enjoyed a modern revival of interest and manufacture since the mid-20th century. Christopher Monk began building his own replica cornetts and serpents and playing them in historically informed performances. In 1968 he and instrument maker Keith Rodgers devised a method of constructing cornetts inexpensively from a composite wood-resin material, which helped to raise interest in these instruments and increase their availability. In 1976 he established the London Serpent Trio with English Early Music Consort players Andrew van der Beek and Alan Lumsden, performing new works and historical arrangements, both serious and whimsical, throughout Europe and North America. At the same time in France, historical instrument specialist Bernard Fourtet and jazz musician Michel Godard began promoting use of the serpent, and reintroduced serpent teaching at the Conservatoire de Paris. Among the graduates are Volny Hostiou, who has recorded a significant serpent discography, and Patrick Wibart, also an accomplished ophicleide player. Wibart succeeded Godard as the serpent teacher at the Conservatoire de Paris, and also teaches serpent at the .

The &quot;Serpent Newsletter&quot;, first published in 1986 as the &quot;Newsletter for United Serpents&quot;, is published twice a year and edited by Paul Schmidt. It reviews new recordings and publications, covers contemporary performances and events, as well as new discoveries, appearances in media and film, and other developments.

== Range and performance ==
The serpent&#x27;s range typically covers the two and a half octaves from C two octaves below middle C to G. The range can easily extend downwards to A1 or even F1 by fingering the low C note with all holes covered, and producing falset tones, by slackening the embouchure (&quot;lipping down&quot;). Proficient players can play upwards to C.

Monk writes that due to its inherent mechanical and acoustical defects, the serpent is one of the more difficult wind instruments to play well. Although played with an embouchure similar to that used with other brass instruments such as the trombone, the instrument is easily over-blown so the player must use a more gentle air stream. The tone holes do not always serve to shorten the air column as they do in woodwind instruments. The lower tone holes in particular are too small and behave more like air leaks, working largely by dampening resonances in the air column, thus altering the note selection and influencing the timbre. Consequently, the player must rely much more on a strong, controlled embouchure to produce the correct pitch than on other brass instruments. The serpent&#x27;s natural tones with all holes covered (the harmonic series on C) are fuller and richer than those produced with fingering, so the player must also focus on consistency of timbre and a &quot;cantabile&quot; approach throughout the serpent&#x27;s range.

Production of pitch can be lowered by a semitone or more by slackening the embouchure given the same fingering. This is due to the serpent&#x27;s coupling of a &quot;strong&quot; acoustical system of embouchure and mouthpiece, with the relatively &quot;weak&quot; system of the air column in the serpent body. This results in the mouthpiece having a stronger influence on selecting the instrument pitch than the air column. The mismatch of embouchure and air column length also contributes to its timbre.

== Repertoire ==

Serpents were originally used as an instrument to accompany church choral music, particularly in France. For this purpose, very little was specifically written for the serpent &quot;per se&quot;; the serpent player would simply play the &quot;cantus firmus&quot;, or bass line. The serpent began to be called for in orchestras by opera composers in the mid-to-late 18th century, and their subsequent adoption in military bands prompted the publication of several method books, fingering charts and etudes, including duets for student and teacher.

Among the serpent&#x27;s first appearances in orchestral scores is George Frideric Handel&#x27;s &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot; (1749), although he later removed it. Italian composers in the early 19th century often called for &quot;serpentone&quot;, in operas by Gioachino Rossini and Vincenzo Bellini. Mendelssohn paired serpent with contrabassoon in his 1828 overture &quot;Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage&quot; and fifth &quot;Reformation&quot; symphony (1830), and Hector Berlioz included serpent and ophicleide in his early revisions of &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; (1830).

After disappearing almost entirely by the late 19th century, the serpent began to reappear in the mid-20th century in film scores and new period instrument chamber ensembles. American film composer Bernard Herrmann used a serpent in the scores of &quot;White Witch Doctor&quot; (1953) and &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1959), as did Jerry Goldsmith in his score for &quot;Alien&quot; (1979).

In jazz, French tubist Michel Godard has incorporated the serpent into his music, and has frequently collaborated with Lebanese composer and oud player Rabih Abou-Khalil.

Modern works for the instrument include a concerto for serpent and orchestra by English composer Simon Proctor, commissioned in 1987 to mark the first International Serpent Festival in South Carolina, where it was premièred by London Serpent Trio member Alan Lumsden in 1989. Also premièred at the festival was composer Peter Schickele&#x27;s comic P.D.Q. Bach piece &quot;O Serpent&quot; written for the London Serpent Trio and an ensemble of vocalists. Douglas Yeo premièred &quot;Temptation&quot; for serpent and string quartet, written by his Boston Symphony Orchestra colleague, trombonist and composer Norman Bolter, at the 1999 International Trombone Festival in Potsdam, New York. Yeo also premièred a serpent concerto in 2008 by American composer Gordon W. Bowie entitled &quot;Old Dances in New Shoes&quot;. Italian composer Luigi Morleo wrote &quot;Diversità: NO LIMIT&quot;, a concerto for serpent and strings, which premièred in Monopoli, Italy in 2012.

American composer Austin Wintory&#x27;s Grammy-nominated and BAFTA-winning soundtrack for the 2012 PlayStation 3 video game &quot;Journey&quot; includes a serpent as one of the five soloists, played by Noah Gladstone.

<doc id="873874" wikidata="Q1074897" url="?curid=873874" title="Live Peace in Toronto 1969">
<text>Live Peace in Toronto 1969 is a live album by the Plastic Ono Band, released in December 1969 on Apple Records. Recorded at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival, it was the first live album released by any member of the Beatles separately or together. John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono received a phone call from the festival&#x27;s promoters John Brower and Kenny Walker, and then assembled a band on very short notice for the festival, which was due to start the following day. The band included Eric Clapton, Klaus Voormann, and drummer Alan White. The group flew from London and had brief unamplified rehearsals on the plane before appearing on the stage to perform several songs; one of which, &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;, was first performed live at the festival. After returning home, Lennon mixed the album in a day.

The album peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified a gold album by the RIAA, representing 500,000 copies in sales. The album did not chart in the UK. The original LP included a 13-month 1970 calendar. A video of several performances, not just the Plastic Ono Band&#x27;s set, was released. Since its first release, the album has been reissued a number of times.

==Background==
Toronto rock promoters John Brower and Kenny Walker organised a festival held at Varsity Stadium in Toronto on 13 September 1969, around the notion of a revival of rock and roll stars from the 1950s, booking Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino, Bo Diddley, and Gene Vincent. They also booked more modern acts such as Alice Cooper, Chicago, and the Doors.

On 12 September, Brower contacted Lennon, who was still a member of the Beatles, to ask him to be the master of ceremonies for the festival. Instead, Lennon offered to perform at the show with a new group, the Plastic Ono Band. Brower readily agreed, but since Lennon did not actually have a new group, he quickly began making phone calls to potential members to accompany himself and Yoko Ono. He initially approached Beatles band-mate George Harrison to play lead guitar, but Harrison declined, so Lennon turned to Eric Clapton, who had previously performed with Lennon in the one-off super group, the Dirty Mac. Bassist Klaus Voormann and drummer Alan White soon agreed to perform, along with their assistants, Anthony Fawcett, Terry Doran, and Jill and Dan Richter. Voormann was a long-time friend of Lennon, but White, who was a respected session musician in London but did not know Lennon personally, initially thought that someone was prank calling. It was only when Lennon called a second time did White realize it was actually him.

The group was scheduled to fly to Toronto on 12 September, the day before the concert, but Lennon, Ono, and Clapton were late to arrive at the airport. Lennon had talked to Clapton&#x27;s management, but Clapton himself did not yet know that Lennon had invited him to perform and was not even aware of the concert. Brower managed to reach Clapton personally and told him to contact Lennon and Ono, who were still in bed. Clapton said he got &quot;a phone call on the day we were to leave and he said that someone had asked him to do that concert and it was that night! So I had to make the airport in an hour.&quot; The group had two quick rehearsals before appearing on stage. One was during the transatlantic flight from London to Toronto, though they could not hear the music very well since they were playing unplugged electric instruments. They had another at the concert venue shortly before appearing on stage. Lennon later said that the group &quot;didn&#x27;t know what to play&quot; since they had not previously performed together, and they eventually settled on a set list consisting of older rock and roll standards, three Lennon-penned Beatle and solo songs, and two longer experimental songs featuring Ono.

Though preparations for the show were rushed and chaotic, Lennon later said that he gained the confidence to leave the Beatles during those few days. Lennon mentioned this to Clapton at the time, and upon returning to London, he privately told Beatles&#x27; manager Allen Klein.

==Recording==
The group played eight songs to a crowd of 20,000 people. Before the start of the Plastic Ono Band&#x27;s performance, they were introduced by Kim Fowley, and Lennon said to the crowd that the group were going to play only songs that they actually knew. They performed the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yer Blues&quot;, because Clapton had performed it with Lennon for &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot;, and his two solo songs, &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; and &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;, the latter of which had its premiere at the festival. &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;, presented as &quot;the newest song that John wrote&quot; by Ono, had Lennon reading the lyrics off a clip-board. Ono selected a song that was to be B-side of &quot;Cold Turkey,&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Kyoko (Mummy&#x27;s Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)&quot;, which also had its premiere at the festival. Shortly before the band went into &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Kyoko&quot;, Lennon announced that Ono was &quot;gonna do her thing all over you&quot;. The band closed with an electric version of the &quot;Wedding Album&quot; track &quot;John John (Let&#x27;s Hope for Peace)&quot;, an extended experimental number consisting of her screaming the title repeatedly to the feedback of the electric guitars. Towards the end of Ono&#x27;s performance, the audience began to boo and whistle, and the band departed the stage leaving their guitars and bass to resonate until Mal Evans turned off the amplifiers. With their stage remarks, Lennon and Ono linked their appearance there to their ongoing campaign for peace.

Lennon went to Abbey Road Studios on 25 September 1969 to mix the album from their eight-track recordings. While at the session, Lennon finished the stereo master for the album, although he did go back on 20 October to re-do the &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Kyoko&quot; stereo master, removing the majority of Ono&#x27;s vocals from his songs and Clapton&#x27;s backing vocals. The album is technically a soundtrack recording, being part of the audio portion of the documentary film being made of the festival by D.A. Pennebaker, later released as &quot;Sweet Toronto&quot;. Lennon and Ono made a deal with Pennebaker to license their portion of the show for record, in exchange for rights to include their appearance. According to the &quot;Beatles Monthly&quot;, due to the adverse reaction to Ono&#x27;s performance, Pennebaker removed the segments with Lennon and Ono after limited screenings of the film, later re-edited as &quot;Keep on Rockin&quot;&#x27;. Showtime ultimately presented the performance in 1989, and the full movie appeared later on home video and DVD.

==Release and aftermath==

The album, released on the same day in both the UK and US, failed to chart in the UK but peaked at number 10 in the US. It was released to quash any bootleg versions that Lennon was sure would leak onto the market. US editions of the album wrongly stated that the album was recorded in England. The album came with a 13-month calendar that had photos, poems and songs in it, from Lennon&#x27;s 1964 book &quot;In His Own Write&quot;, his 1965 book &quot;A Spaniard in the Works&quot;, and Ono&#x27;s 1964 book &quot;Grapefruit&quot;. In the US, Capitol was reluctant at first to issue the album, after the commercial failures of Lennon&#x27;s and Ono&#x27;s experimental albums. Lennon recalled in an interview in December 1980 that he had to persuade Capitol to distribute the album: &quot;They said &#x27;This is garbage, we&#x27;re not going to put it out with her screaming on one side and you doing this sort of live stuff.&#x27; And they refused to put it out. But we finally persuaded them that ... people might buy this.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Lennon said that Capitol &quot;were on the [Paul] McCartney bandwagon, which they were on, and they thought that I was just an idiot pissing about with a Japanese broad and the music we were making, like &quot;Toronto&quot;, they didn&#x27;t want to put out, because they didn&#x27;t like that.&quot;

Criticism was directed at side two of the LP, the side consisting entirely of two Yoko Ono songs. In a retrospective assessment, Richard Ginell of AllMusic remarks:
In contrast, fellow musicians over the years remarked how Yoko Ono&#x27;s half was a lot more inspirational and groundbreaking than the first half. Iggy Pop praised Yoko&#x27;s part as &quot;the part that stands out. The rest of it‘s just kinda pedestrian.&quot; Perry Farrell of Jane&#x27;s Addiction echoed similar feelings, stating that Ono&#x27;s sound experimentations were a cornerstone of his musical education. Music author Chuck Eddy wrote that despite Clapton&#x27;s sporadically &quot;really loud&quot; playing, side one&#x27;s covers were rendered &quot;quaint&quot; by the Flying Lizards&#x27; versions ten years later. However, Eddy believed Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Yer Blues&quot;, which features noisier feedback &quot;than the LP&#x27;s start and end combined&quot;, was the album&#x27;s most disquieting moment. He also described Lennon&#x27;s grooves on side two as &quot;proto-harmolodic&quot;.

Lennon later said he &quot;couldn&#x27;t remember any of the words but it didn&#x27;t matter—I just made them all up and we made a great wonderful noise.&quot; Carl Perkins said to Lennon after the show that he was &quot;so beautiful you made me cry.&quot; A bootleg album of the concert appeared, under the title &quot;JL-YO-EC&quot;, thanks to an audience recording, which was released about the same time as the official album.

After Lennon&#x27;s death, the album, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set released in the UK on 15 June 1981. The album was reissued in the US in 1982, by Capitol, and again in 1986. The album was originally scheduled to appear on CD for the first time in June 1989, but the plan was scrapped. Ono, with the help of Rob Stevens from Quad Recording, supervised a remix of &quot;Live Peace in Toronto 1969&quot; for its compact disc issue, released on 1 May 1995. Two of the remixed tracks feature a variation in Ono&#x27;s vocals: while &quot;Dizzy Miss Lizzy&quot; has additional backing vocals from Ono, &quot;Money&quot; has fewer backing vocals from Ono. The CD booklet included a 1995 calendar, mimicking the original release. The album is also available from the audiophile label Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, utilizing the same remix. The booklet for the 2006 Mobile Fidelity release also included a calendar for 2007. A 2009 vinyl reissue from Captiol reverts to the original 1970.

<doc id="873877" wikidata="Q9075" url="?curid=873877" title="Shawn Crawford">
<text>Shawn Crawford (born January 14, 1978) is a retired American sprint athlete. He competed in the 100 meters and 200 meters events. In the 200 meter sprint, Crawford won gold at the 2004 Summer Olympics and silver at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He originally finished 4th in the race but after the 2nd and 3rd-place winners were disqualified, he moved up to a silver. On April 17, 2013, Crawford was suspended for two years for missing out-of-competition drug tests. His coach, Bob Kersee claimed that Crawford retired after the 2012 United States Olympic Trials and USA Track &amp; Field said he filed retirement papers in 2013.

==Biography==
Crawford was born in Van Wyck, South Carolina. He attended Indian Land High School before leaving for Clemson University, where he claimed eleven All-America honors and three national championships.

In 2001 Crawford started the year with a victory at the Indoor World Championships in the 200 m. He then went to the World Athletics Championships, where he tied with Kim Collins of Saint Kitts and Nevis for the 200 m bronze medal. At the Goodwill Games, he claimed his second gold medal of the year.

Crawford became known for his outrageous antics and lack of focus. At a 2002 meet in Milan, he donned a Phantom of the Opera mask that obstructed his vision during the 200 m race, causing him to run out of his lane and be disqualified.

In January 2003, Crawford starred in an episode of the Fox TV show &quot;Man vs. Beast&quot; in which he raced a zebra and a giraffe over 100 m on dirt. In the first race, he easily bested the giraffe. The zebra race was very close. Accusing the zebra of a false start, he re-raced the zebra, getting out of the blocks first and taking a lead. This caused the zebra to speed up, finishing in 9.957 seconds to Crawford&#x27;s 10.86 seconds. Later he boasted to &quot;ESPN the Magazine&quot;, &quot;tell the zebra I coulda whooped him.&quot; According to the USATF website, Crawford refers to himself as &quot;Cheetah Man.&quot; He has publicly expressed his desire to run in war paint and urges spectators to look out for him at every meet.

In March 2004, he was favored to win the 60 meters world indoor title but was defeated by Jason Gardener of Great Britain by three hundredths of a second.

In the trials for the 2004 Summer Olympics, Crawford secured a place on the team by claiming third in the 100 m with a personal best of 9.93 s behind winner Maurice Greene and runner-up Justin Gatlin. Seven days later he placed first in the 200 m with a time of 19.99s, edging out Gatlin; Bernard Williams took third place. In June, Crawford improved on his 100 m personal best by running 9.88s in Eugene, Oregon.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Crawford ran the 100 m final in 9.89 s, finishing in fourth place just 0.04 s behind first-place finisher Justin Gatlin. That marked the first race in history in which four competitors under 9.90s. Crawford went on to win the gold medal in the 200 m with a time of 19.79 s. He claimed a silver medal as part of the United States 4 × 100 m relay team.

He qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics in the 200 m dash, finishing second at the trials after failing to qualify in the 100 m. He originally finished fourth in the 200 m final, but was later promoted to 2nd, winning silver, after fellow countryman Wallace Spearmon and Churandy Martina of the Netherlands Antilles were both disqualified for lane infringements. Although initially only Spearmon was disqualified, prompting the United States to consider filing a protest, review of race footage revealed an additional infraction by Martina. On August 28, in a gesture of sportsmanship, Crawford gave his medal to Martina. On March 6, 2009, the Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected an appeal by the National Olympic Committee of the Netherlands Antilles against Martina&#x27;s disqualification.

Crawford won the 200 m at the 2009 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships and qualified to represent the United States at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. He ran 19.89 s in the final of the competition, his best time of the season, but finished fourth behind second-place Alonso Edward of Panama (19.81 s) and third-place Wallace Spearmon (19.85 s). First place finisher Usain Bolt set a new world record of 19.19 s.
On April 17, 2013, Crawford was suspended for two years for missing out-of-competition drug tests. His coach, Bob Kersee claimed that Crawford retired after the 2012 United States Olympic Trials and USA Track &amp; Field said he filed retirement papers in 2013.

==Statistics==

On 12 April 2002, Crawford became the first man to break ten seconds for the 100 metres for the first time and twenty seconds for the 200 metres for the first time, both on the same day, a feat he achieved in Pretoria, South Africa.

<text>Vladimir Vladimirovich Vasyutin (Russian: Влaдимиp Bлaдимиpoвич Васютин; 8 March 1952 19 July 2002) was a Soviet cosmonaut.

He was selected as a cosmonaut on 1 December 1978 (TsPK-6). He retired on 25 February 1986.

Vasyutin was assigned to the TKS program for a new generation of crewed military spacecraft that would be docked to the existing Salyut space stations.

He flew as the Commander on Soyuz T-14 to the Salyut 7 space station, for part of the long-duration mission Salyut 7 EO-4. He spent 64 days 21 hours 52 minutes in space. The TKS module was already docked to the Salyut and Vasyutin was due to lead an extended program of military space experiments. However Vasyutin fell ill soon after arriving at the station and was unable to perform his duties. Although he was originally scheduled to have a six-month stay aboard Salyut 7, his illness which he concealed from doctors before the launch, forced the crew to make an emergency return to Earth after only two months. His illness is said to have been caused by a prostate infection, which had manifested itself as inflammation and a fever.

He graduated from Higher Air Force School and from Test Pilot School, both in Kharkov. He was a Lieutenant General in the Soviet Air Forces, and took cosmonaut basic training in August 1976. He retired for medical reasons. He later became Deputy Faculty Chief, VVA - Gagarin Air Force Academy, Monino.

He was married and had two children. He died of cancer.

<text>The Karakoram Highway (, ), also known as the KKH, National Highway 35 (), N-35, and the ChinaPakistan Friendship Highway, is a national highway which extends from Hasan Abdal in the Punjab province of Pakistan to the Khunjerab Pass in Gilgit-Baltistan, where it crosses into China and becomes China National Highway 314. The highway connects the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa plus Gilgit-Baltistan with China&#x27;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The highway is a popular tourist attraction and is one of the highest paved roads in the world, passing through the Karakoram mountain range, at at maximum elevation of near Khunjerab Pass. Due to its high elevation and the difficult conditions under which it was constructed, it is often referred to as the Eighth Wonder of the World. The highway is also a part of the Asian Highway AH4.

== History ==
The Karakoram Highway, also known as the Friendship Highway in China, was built by the governments of China and Pakistan. It was started in 1962, completed in 1979 and opened to the public in 1986. Pakistan initially favored routing through Mintaka Pass. In 1966, China, citing the fact that Mintaka would be more susceptible to air strikes, recommended the steeper Khunjerab Pass instead. About 810 Pakistanis and about 200 Chinese workers died, mostly in landslides and falls, while building the highway. Over 140 Chinese workers who died during the construction are buried in the Chinese cemetery in Gilgit. The route of the KKH traces one of the many paths of the ancient Silk Road.

On the Pakistani side, the road was constructed by FWO (Frontier Works Organisation), employing the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers. The Engineer-in-Chief&#x27;s Branch of the Pakistani Army completed a project documenting the history of the highway. The book &quot;History of Karakoram Highway&quot; was written by Brigadier (Retired) Muhammad Mumtaz Khalid in two volumes. In the first volume, the author discusses the land and the people, the pre-historic communication system in the Northern Areas, the need for an all-weather road link with Gilgit, and the construction of Indus Valley Road. The second volume records events leading to the conversion of the Indus Valley Road to the Karakoram Highway, the difficulties in its construction, and the role of the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers and their Chinese counterparts in its construction.

== The Highway ==
The highway, connecting the Gilgit–Baltistan region to the ancient Silk Road, runs approximately from Kashgar, a city in the Xinjiang region of China, to Abbottabad, of Pakistan. An extension of the highway southwest from Abbottabad, in the form of the N-35 highway, meets the Grand Trunk Road, N-5, at Hasan Abdal, Pakistan.

The highway cuts through the collision zone between the Eurasian Plate and Indian Plate, where China, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan come within of each other. Owing largely to the extremely sensitive state of the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan, the Karakoram Highway has strategic and military importance to these nations, but particularly Pakistan and China.

On 30 June 2006, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Pakistani National Highway Authority (NHA) and China&#x27;s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) to rebuild and upgrade the Karakoram Highway. According to SASAC, the width will be expanded from , and its transport capacity will be increased three times its current capacity. In addition, the upgraded road will be designed to particularly accommodate heavy-laden vehicles and extreme weather conditions.

China and Pakistan are planning to link the Karakoram Highway to the southern port of Gwadar in Balochistan through the Chinese-aided Gwadar-Dalbandin railway, which extends to Rawalpindi.

On 4 January 2010, the KKH was closed in the Hunza Valley, eliminating through traffic to China except by small boats. A massive landslide upstream from Hunza&#x27;s capital of Karimabad created the potentially unstable Attabad Lake, which reached in length and over in depth by the first week of June 2010 when it finally began flowing over the landslide dam. The landslide destroyed parts of villages while killing many inhabitants. The subsequent lake displaced thousands and inundated over of the KKH, including the long KKH bridge south of Gulmit.

It is highly questionable whether the lake, which reached in length in 2011, will drain. Goods from and to further north were transported over the lake by small vessels, to be reloaded onto trucks at the other end. In July 2012, Pakistan began constructing a revised route around the lake at a higher elevation with five new tunnels, with a total length of 7.12 km and two new bridges. The work was contracted out to the China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation (CRBC) and was completed in September 2015.

=== Pakistani section ===
At in length, the Pakistani section of the highway starts at Abbottabad, although the N-35 of which KKH is now part, officially starts from Hasan Abdal. The highway meets the Indus River at Thakot and continues along the river until Jaglot, where the Gilgit River joins the Indus River. This is where three great mountain ranges meet: the Hindukush, the Himalayas, and the Karakoram. The western end of the Himalayas, marked by the ninth highest peak in the world, Nanga Parbat, can be seen from the highway. The highway passes through the capital of Gilgit–Baltistan, Gilgit, and continues through the valleys of Nagar and Hunza, along the Hunza River. Some of the highest mountains and famous glaciers in Karakoram can be seen in this section. The highway meets the Pakistani-Chinese border at Khunjerab Pass.

== Karakoram Highway reconstruction ==

As part of the $46 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, reconstruction and upgrade works on the Pakistani portion of the Karakoram Highway (KKH) are underway. The KKH spans the long distance between the China-Pakistan border and the town of Hasan Abdal. At Burhan Interchange near Hasan Abdal, the existing M1 motorway will intersect the Karakoram Highway. From there, access onwards to Islamabad and Lahore continues as part of the existing M1 and M2 motorways, while Hasan Abdal will also be at intersection of the Eastern Alignment, and the Western Alignment which will lead towards the port city of Gwadar.

=== Karakoram Highway Realignment (China-Pakistan Friendship Tunnels) ===
A large section of the highway was damaged by a landslide in 2010 that created Attabad Lake. The resulting landslides cut off both the Hunza River and Karakoram Highway resulting in the formation of the reservoir. Prior to the completion of the bypass, all vehicular traffic had to be loaded onto boats to traverse the new reservoir. Construction of the tunnels began in 2012 and required 36 months for completion. The long series of bridges and tunnels was inaugurated on 15 September 2015 at a cost of $275 million and was hailed as a major accomplishment. The route comprises five tunnels and several bridges. The longest tunnel is , followed by , , and , while the Shishkat Great Bridge on Hunza River is long. The realignment restored the road link between Pakistan and China.

=== Chinese section ===

The Chinese section of the Karakoram Highway follows the north-south Sarykol (&quot;Yellow Lake&quot;) valley just west of the Tarim Basin. The road from Kashgar goes southwest about and then turns west to enter the Gez (Ghez) River canyon between Chakragil mountain on the north and Kongur Tagh mountain on the south. From the Gez canyon the population becomes Kirgiz. Having climbed up to the valley, the road turns south past Kongur, Karakul Lake, and Muztagh Ata on the east. Below Muztagh Ata, a new road goes west over the Kulma Pass to join the Pamir Highway in Gorno-Badakhshan, Tajikistan. The main road continues over a low pass (where the population becomes Tajik) and descends to Tashkurgan. Further south, a valley and jeep track leads west toward the Wakhjir Pass to the Wakhan Corridor. Next the road turns west to a checkpost and small settlement at Pirali, and then the Khunjerab Pass, beyond which is Pakistan, the Khunjerab River and Hunza.

== Tourism ==
In recent years the highway has sought to become a &#x27;niche&#x27; adventure tourism destination although Pakistan attracts few international tourists compared to domestic ones. But in recent years, owing to the improved security situation in the country, the number of foreign tourists coming to Pakistan has more than tripled since 2013, standing at 1.75 million in 2016.

Among the tourist destinations in the country, KKH is deemed as the &quot;third best&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. &quot;BBC Travel&quot; cited its popularity to some as &quot;the 8th wonder of the world&quot;, while also noting its negative impact on local environment and culture.

The road has given mountaineers and cyclists easier access to the many high mountains, glaciers, and lakes in the area. The highway provides access to Gilgit and Skardu from Islamabad by road. These are the two major hubs for mountaineering expeditions in the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan administered Kashmir.

The Gilgit–Baltistan Administration of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Xinjiang Administration of China have signed an agreement to issue border passes to their permanent residents. This pass is valid for a calendar year and is used to travel through Khunjerab Pass only. Karakoram Highway has been described as one of the most beautiful destinations in the world. KKH provides a cross country road trip from Hasan Abdal, Pakistan to Kashgar.

Naltar Valley is one of the most scenic valleys accessed via Karakoram Highway. The valley offers snow clad mountains, sky high peaks, alpine ski slopes, high altitude lakes, glaciers and mountain passes. Bishgiri Lake is one of the highest lakes in Pakistan. While Pakora Pass is famous for its glaciers and meadows.

=== Mountains and glaciers ===

Karakoram Highway provides the pathway to expeditions for almost all peaks in Gilgit–Baltistan, Kashmir and several peaks in Xinjiang China. The region includes some of the world&#x27;s largest glaciers like the Baltoro and Siachen Glaciers. Two of the Eight-thousanders (mountains taller than ) of the world that are in Pakistan are accessible by the highway. The notable mountains that can be directly seen while travelling on the highway are:

* Nanga Parbat, Gilgit–Baltistan, 9th highest of the world at 
* Rakaposhi, Gilgit–Baltistan, 27th highest of the world at 
* Diran, Gilgit–Baltistan, most dangerous mountain in Pakistan
* Shishpar, Gilgit–Baltistan
* Ultar Peak, Gilgit–Baltistan 
* Tupopdan, Gilgit–Baltistan, also known as Cathedral Peaks near Passu

Many glaciers can be seen while travelling on the highway:

* Minapin Glacier
* Passu Glacier
* Ghulkin Glacier
* Khunjerab Glacier

=== Rivers and lakes ===
Several rivers and lakes are made accessible by the highway. These include:
* Indus River
* Hunza River
* Attabad Lake
* Gilgit River
* Khunjerab River
* Karakul Lake in Xinjiang (China)

=== Rock art and petroglyphs ===


There are more than 50,000 pieces of rock art and petroglyphs all along the highway that are concentrated at ten major sites between Hunza and Shatial. The carvings were left by invaders, traders, and pilgrims who passed along the trade route, as well as by locals. The earliest date back to between 5000 and 1000 BC, showing single animals, triangular men, and hunting scenes in which the animals are larger than the hunters. These carvings were pecked into the rock with stone tools and are covered with a thick patina that yields their age.

=== Travel ===
There are several transport companies in Pakistan that offer bus service between major towns of the highway and from Rawalpindi and Lahore. The largest company is Northern Areas Transport Corporation (NATCO). Other companies are Masherbrum Travel, Silk Route Travel, K-2 movers, Anchan Travel, and Saeed Travel.

=== Bus service between Gilgit and Kashgar ===
On 1 June 2006, daily bus service began between Gilgit, Gilgit–Baltistan, and Kashgar, Xinjiang, through the Sust and Tashkorgan border area.

== Climate ==

The KKH is best travelled in the spring or early autumn. Heavy snow during harsh winters can shut the highway down for extended periods. Heavy monsoon rains around July and August cause occasional landslides that can block the road for hours or more. The border crossing between China and Pakistan at Khunjerab Pass is open only between 1 May and 31 December.

==Alternate road (Xinjiang-GB-Azad Kashmir road)==
The proposed Xinjiang-GB-Azad Kashmir road would be linked to Yarkant County in Xinjiang, and enter Gilgit-Baltistan through Mustagh Pass, 126 km west of Ladakh, crossing the major supply artery from the Karakoram Highway near Skardu city. From there, it would run south through the high-altitude Deosai Plateau to the Astore Valley. A road tunnel is proposed to be constructed through the mountains to connect Astore to the Neelum Valley in the Azad Kashmir region.

<text>Hunger (died 866), also known as , was the Bishop of Utrecht from 854 to 866. He is a saint of the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches.

Born around 800, Hunger became a Benedictine. After the death of his predecessor Liudger of Utrecht, Liudger&#x27;s nephew Craft was offered the seat. However, Craft, a very wealthy person, refused because he was afraid that he would attract Viking raids. Instead, Canon Hunger was appointed. 

At first his relations with the Vikings were peaceful, but eventually Utrecht was threatened by the Vikings, which caused the bishop and the entire clergy of Utrecht to flee to Sint Odiliënberg, near Roermond. In 858, the Lotharingian king Lothair II made a monastery available for them. Later the bishop settled in Prüm and then in Deventer.

Hunger seems to have been a godly man who, unlike his predecessors, did not engage in nepotism. In the case of the childless marriage between Lothair II and his wife Teutberga, he defended the sanctity of their marriage on biblical and theological grounds, but to secure his succession, Lothair II repudiated his wife and married Waldrada, with whom he had a son.

Hunger died in Prüm in Germany. His feast day is 22 December.

<text>Igor Petrovich Volk (, ; 12 April 1937 – 3 January 2017) was a Russian test pilot and former Soviet cosmonaut in the Buran programme.

== Military and test pilot ==
Volk became a pilot in the Soviet Air Forces in 1956. After graduation from the Fedotov Test Pilot School in 1965, he has joined the Gromov Flight Research Institute. He logged over 7000 flight hours in over 80 different aircraft types. Over the years, he flew on all types of Soviet fighters, bombers, and transport aircraft. He showed outstanding abilities in complex tests of various airplanes at critical angles of attack, stall, and spin. He was the first who tested aircraft behavior at high super-critical angles of attack (around 90°) and performed aerobatics such as the &quot;cobra&quot; maneuver.

== Space program ==

Igor Volk was selected as a cosmonaut on 12 July 1977 and subsequently assigned to the Buran programme. As part of his preparations for a space shuttle flight, he also accomplished test-flights with Buran&#x27;s counterpart OK-GLI aircraft. 

In July 1984, Volk flew aboard Soyuz T-12, intended to give him some experience in space. With Volks&#x27;s participation as research cosmonaut on the 7th expedition to Salyut 7, one goal of the mission was to evaluate the effects of long-duration spaceflight on a pilot&#x27;s skills and ability to fly and land an aeroplane safely (in order to prove Volk&#x27;s ability to control Space Shuttle Buran atmospheric segment of flight). At the time of the Soyuz T-12 mission, the Buran program was still a state secret. The appearance of Volk as a crew member caused some, including the British Interplanetary Society magazine &quot;Spaceflight&quot;, to ask why a test pilot was occupying a Soyuz seat usually reserved for researchers or foreign cosmonauts.

After his orbital flight, Volk served as the head of pilot-cosmonaut training department for the Buran program and later (after the project&#x27;s cancellation) worked for the Gromov Flight Research Institute as a Flight Tests Deputy Chief before retiring in 1996. He previously served as President of the National Aero Club of Russia and Vice President of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. As recognition for his contributions as a test pilot and cosmonaut he was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union on 29 July 1984.

<text>The London Hydraulic Power Company was established in 1883 to install a hydraulic power network in London. This expanded to cover most of central London at its peak, before being replaced by electricity, with the final pump house closing in 1977.

==History==


The company was set up by an Act of Parliament (the London Hydraulic Power Act 1884), sponsored by railway engineer Sir James Allport, to install a network of high-pressure cast iron water mains under London. It merged the Wharves and Warehouses Steam Power and Hydraulic Pressure Company, founded in 1871 by Edward B. Ellington, and the General Hydraulic Power Company, founded in 1882. The network gradually expanded to cover an area mostly north of the Thames from Hyde Park in the west to Docklands in the east.

The system was used as a cleaner and more compact alternative to steam engines, to power workshop machinery, lifts, cranes, theatre machinery (including revolving stages at the London Palladium and the London Coliseum, safety curtains at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the lifting mechanism for the cinema organ at the Leicester Square theatre and the complete Palm Court orchestra platform), and the backup mechanism of Tower Bridge. It was also used to supply fire hydrants, mostly those inside buildings. The water, pumped straight from the Thames, was heated in winter to prevent freezing.

==Pumping stations==

The pressure was maintained at a nominal (55 BAR) by five hydraulic power stations, originally driven by coal-fired steam engines. These were at:
* Falcon Wharf Pumping Station at Bankside, east of Blackfriars Bridge on the south bank of the River Thames (opened in 1883)
* Kensington Court and Millbank (1887) later (1911) replaced by a station in Grosvenor Road
* Wapping Hydraulic Pumping Station (est. 1890), using the defunct Tower Subway to carry pipes under the Thames (closed on 30 June 1977, the last to be used)
* City Road Basin on the Regent&#x27;s Canal in Islington (1893), later used as the Marico furniture factory
* Renforth Pump House (Rotherhithe, Canada Water) (opened in 1904), now residential accommodation

Short-term storage was provided by hydraulic accumulators, which were large vertical pistons loaded with heavy weights.

== Cross-River Thames mains ==
The mains crossed the River Thames via Vauxhall Bridge, Waterloo Bridge and Southwark Bridge and via the Rotherhithe Tunnel as well as the Tower Subway.

== Decline ==
The system pumped 6.5 million gallons of water each week in 1893; this grew to 32 million gallons in 1933.

From about 1904, business began to decline as electric power became more popular. The company began to replace its steam engines with electric motors from 1923. At its peak, the network consisted of of pipes, and the total power output was about .

The system finally closed in June 1977. The company, as a UK statutory authority, had the legal right to dig up the public highways to install and maintain its pipe network. This made it attractive to Mercury Communications (a subsidiary of Cable &amp; Wireless) who bought the company and used the pipes as telecommunications ducts. Wapping Hydraulic Power Station, the last of the five to close, later became an arts centre and restaurant.

<doc id="873900" wikidata="Q1192701" url="?curid=873900" title="Western Thrace">
<text>Western Thrace or West Thrace (, &quot;[Dytikí] Thráki&quot; ), also known as Greek Thrace or Aegean Thrace, is a geographical and historical region of Greece, between the Nestos and Evros rivers in the northeast of the country; East Thrace, which lies east of the river Evros, forms the European part of Turkey, and the area to the north, in Bulgaria, is known as Northern Thrace.

Inhabited since paleolithic times, it has been under the political, cultural and linguistic influence of the Greek world since the classical era; Greeks from the Aegean islands extensively colonized the region (especially the coastal part) and built prosperous cities such as Abdera (home of Democritus, the 5th-century BC philosopher who developed an atomic particle theory, and of Protagoras, a leading sophist) and Sale (near present-day Alexandroupolis). Under the Byzantine Empire, Western Thrace benefited from its position close to the imperial heartland and became a center of medieval Greek commerce and culture; later, under the Ottoman Empire, a number of Muslims settled there, marking the birth of the Muslim minority of Greece.

Topographically, Thrace alternates between mountain-enclosed basins of varying size and deeply cut river valleys. It is divided into the three regional units (former prefectures): Xanthi, Rhodope and Evros, which together with the Macedonian regional units of Drama, Kavala and Thasos form the region of East Macedonia and Thrace.

The Fourth Army Corps of the Hellenic Army has its headquarters in Xanthi; in recent years, the region has attracted international media attention after becoming a key entering point for illegal immigrants trying to enter European Union territory; Greek security forces, working together with Frontex, are also extensively deployed in the Greco-Turkish land border.

==Demographics==
The approximate area of Western Thrace is 8,578 km2 with a population of 371,208 according to the 2011 census. It is estimated that two-thirds (67%) of the population are Orthodox Christian Greeks, while about a third (33%) are Muslims who are an officially recognised minority of Greece. Of these, about a quarter are of Turkish origin, while another quarter are Pomaks who mainly inhabit the mountainous parts of the region. The rest are Muslim Greeks or Romani. The Romani of Thrace are also mainly Muslim, unlike their ethnic kin in other parts of the country who generally profess the Orthodox faith of the Greek majority.

Thrace is bordered by Bulgaria to the north, Turkey to the east, the Aegean Sea (Greece) to the south and the Greek region of Macedonia to the west. Alexandroupolis is the largest city, with a municipal population of 72,959 according to the 2011 census. Below is a table of the five largest Thracian cities:

==History==


After the Roman conquest, Western Thrace further belonged to the Roman province of Thracia founded in 46 AD. At the beginning of the 2nd AD century Roman emperor Trajan founded here, as a part of the provincial policy, two cities of Greek type (i.e. city-states), Traianoupolis and Plotinopolis. From this region passed the famous Via Egnatia, which ensured the communication between East and West, while its ramifications were connecting the Aegean world with Thracian hinterland (i.e. upper and middle valley of Evros river). From the coast also passed the sea route Troad–Macedonia, which the Apostle Paul had used in his journeys in Greece. During the great crisis of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century AD, Western Thrace suffered from the frequent incursions of the barbarians until the reign of Diocletian, when it managed to prosper again thanks to its administrative reforms.

The region had been under the rule of the Byzantine Empire from the time of the division of the Roman Empire into Eastern and Western empires in the early fourth century AD. The Ottoman Empire conquered most of the region in the 14th century and ruled it until the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913. During Ottoman rule, Thrace had a mixed population of Turks and Bulgarians, with a strong Greek element in the cities and the Aegean Sea littoral. A smaller number of Pomaks, Jews, Armenians and Romani also lived in the region. At 1821, several parts of Western Thrace, such as Lavara, Maroneia, and Samothraki rebelled and participated in the Greek War of Independence.

During the First Balkan War, the Balkan League (Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria and Montenegro) fought against the Ottoman Empire and annexed most of its European territory, including Thrace. Western Thrace was occupied by Bulgarian troops who defeated the Ottoman army. On 15 November 1912, on the right bank of the river Maritza, Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps captured the Turkish corps of Yaver Paha, which defended Eastern Rhodopes and Western Thrace from invading Bulgarians.

The victors quickly fell into dispute on how to divide the newly conquered lands, resulting in the Second Balkan War. In August 1913, Bulgaria was defeated, but kept Western Thrace under the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest.

In the following years, the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire), with which Bulgaria had sided, lost World War I, and as a result, Bulgaria had to surrender Western Thrace under the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Neuilly. Western Thrace was under temporary management of the Entente led by French General Charles Antoine Charpy. In late April 1920, as per the San Remo conference which gathered the leaders of the main allies of the Entente powers (except the US), Western Thrace was given to Greece.

Throughout the Balkan Wars and World War I, Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey each forced respective minority populations in the Thrace region out of areas they controlled. A large population of Greeks in Eastern Thrace, and Black Sea coastal and southern Bulgaria, was expelled south and west into Greek-controlled Thrace. Concurrently, a large population of Bulgarians was forced from the region into Bulgaria by Greek and Turkish actions. Turkish populations in the area were also targeted by Bulgarian and Greek forces and pushed eastward. As part of the Treaty of Neuilly and subsequent agreements, the status of the expelled populations was legitimized. This was followed by a further population exchange which radically changed the demographics of the region toward increased ethnic homogenization within the territories each respective country was ultimately awarded.

This was followed by the large-scale Greek-Turkish population exchanges of 1923 (Treaty of Lausanne), which finalized the reversal of Western and Eastern Thrace region&#x27;s pre-Balkan War demography. The treaty granted the status of a minority to the Muslims in Western Thrace, in exchange for a similar status for the ethnic Greek minority in Istanbul and the Aegean islands of Imbros and Tenedos.

After the German invasion (April 1941), the area was occupied by Bulgarian troops, as part of the triple Axis occupation of Greece, during World War II. During this period (1941–1944) the demographic distribution was further changed, with the arrest of the region&#x27;s approximately 4,500 Jews by the Bulgarian police and their deportation to death camps administered by Germany. None of them survived.

==Economy==
The economy of Thrace in recent years has become less dependent on agriculture. A number of Greek-owned high-tech telecommunications companies have settled in the area. The A2 motorway (Egnatia Odos) motorway which passes through Thrace has contributed to the further development of the region. Tourism is slowly becoming more and more important as the Aegean coast has a number of beaches, and there is also the potential for winter tourism activities in the Rhodopi mountains, the natural border with Bulgaria, which are covered by dense forest.

==Religion==


It is estimated that two-thirds (67%) of the population are Orthodox Christian Greeks while about a third (33%) are part of the recognized Muslim minority of Greece.

Of the Muslim minority:
* Turkish: ~35%
* Pomaks: ~35%
* Roma people: ~15%
* ethnic Greek Muslims: ~15%

Turkey, a signatory state of the Lausanne Treaty, initially claimed the whole of the Muslim minority to be strictly an ethnic Turkish minority even though it actually consists of multiple ethnic groups. In his 7 December 2017 visit to Greece Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, acknowledged for the first time the multi-ethnic nature of the Western Thracian Muslim minority.

===Jews and the Holocaust===
Before World War 2, Western Thrace was home to a Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jewish population. After Greece was occupied by Axis forces, around 4,075 Jews living in Western Thrace and Macedonia were sent to Treblinka extermination camp and were murdered.

The last censuses which asked about ethnicity were held in the transitional period before the region became part of Greece. A number of estimates and censuses during the 1912-1920 period gave the following results about the ethnic distribution of the area that would become known as Western Thrace:

The Pomak population depending on the source was sometimes counted together with the Turks (Muslims) following the Ottoman system of classifying people according to religion, while in other occasions was specified separately. According to the Bulgarian view, they are considered &quot;Bulgarian Muslims&quot; and an integral part of the Bulgarian nation.

By the Bulgarian census in 1919, held on the request of the Entente, of the population of Western Thrace was 219,723 of whom: Turks 35.4% (77,726 Muslims), Bulgarians 46.3% (101,766 - 81,457 Christians and 20,309 Muslims), Greeks 14.8% (32,553 Christians), Jews 1.4% (3,066) Armenians 1.5% (2,369), others 0.,9% (1,243). The area ceded to the Entente also included Karaagach and its environs, which became part of Turkey after the Treaty of Lausanne.
Western Thrace was ceded to the Entente in December 1919, after which many Bulgarians left the region, while many Greeks moved in. The Government of the Entente (led by French general Sharpe) held its own census in 1920, according to which Western Thrace had a population of 204,700, of whom: Turks 36.5% (74,720 Muslims), Bulgarians 32.2% (65,927 = 54,079 Christians and 11,848 Muslims), Greeks 27.4% (56,114 Christians), Jews 1.5% (2,985) Armenians 0.9% (1,880), others 3,066. At the time this census was conducted, a part of the Greek population of Xanthi, who left massively the Xanthi district after the Balkan wars (1913), returned.

According to the Turkish researches the population of Western Thrace in 1923 was 191,699, of whom 129,120 (67%) were Turks/Muslims (also includes the Pomaks) and 33,910 (18%) were Greeks; the remaining 28,669 (15%) were mostly (Christian) Bulgarians, along with small numbers of Jews and Armenians (before the population exchange).

The population of the region, according to the official census of 1928 and 1951 conducted by the local authorities, per mother tongue, was as follows:

==Miscellaneous==

*Abdera, an ancient Greek coastal town in the regional unit of Xanthi, is the birthplace of the Greek philosophers Democritus, considered by some the father of the atomic theory, and Protagoras, who is credited with having invented the role of the professional sophist or teacher of &quot;virtue&quot;.
*Thrace and in particular the Rhodope mountains, its northern mountainous part, is home to one of the two surviving brown bear (species &quot;Ursus arctos&quot;) populations in Greece (the other is in the Pindus mountains, in central Greece).
*The Greek-Turkish border is a major entering point of illegal immigrants from Asia (Syrians, Kurds, Afghans, Pakistanis) trying to enter Europe.

Christian is a patrilineal great-great-great-great-grandson of Fletcher Christian, leader of the mutineers in the late 18th century on HMS &quot;Bounty&quot;, a story told in the 1932 Nordoff and Hall novel &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, and several subsequent motion picture versions. He is the son of Ivan Roa Christian and Verna Carlene &quot;Dobrey&quot; Young, a descendant of Ned Young. Ivan Roa Christian is the son of Richard Charles Edgar Christian and nephew of Charles Richard Parkin Christian, and is the grandson of Francis Hickson Christian. Steve Christian married Olive Jal Brown in 1972 and they have four children: Trent, Randy, Shawn and Tania.

Public respect for Steve Christian&#x27;s lineage gave him considerable influence long before he held political office, first as a member of the Island Council in 1976. He again served on the Council in 1982, and was briefly Chairman of the Internal Committee (considered the second-most influential political position on the island) in 1985. He was to hold this position again in 1991 and 1992, 1994 and 1995, and 1998 and 1999, when he was elected as the island&#x27;s first mayor. The title was new but the office was not: the mayor had previously been known as the magistrate.

Christian was the Mayor of the Pitcairn Islands, a British dependency in the Pacific Ocean, from 7 December 1999 to 30 October 2004. He also acted as the island&#x27;s supervising engineer, dentist, radiographer, and as coxswain of the longboat, which is described as Pitcairn&#x27;s umbilical cord to the outside world. He was formally dismissed from office on 30 October 2004, following his rape conviction on 24 October.

==Sexual assault trial==
In 2004, Steve Christian, along with six other men, was tried on charges of rape and child sexual abuse by the Pitcairn Supreme Court. Over the course of the trial, it was alleged that Christian repeatedly raped or assaulted a number of island women, including his children, over a period of several years – using the remoteness of the island and his position of power to coerce their silence. Christian denied all accusations of impropriety, but admitted having consensual sex with several of his children. Christian pleaded not guilty to all charges of rape and indecent assault, but on 24 October 2004, he was convicted of committing five rapes between 1964 and 1975 for which he was sentenced for three years. He was acquitted of a sixth rape charge and of four indecent assault charges. 

On 8 November 2004, Christian&#x27;s sister Brenda, the island&#x27;s sole police officer, was elected by the Island Council to succeed him in an interim capacity, pending elections scheduled for 15 December, when Jay Warren, the acquitted former magistrate, was elected mayor.

==Later life==
Christian served as one of the two assessors during the trial of Mayor Mike Warren for child pornography charges. When Warren was found guilty in 2016, Christian reportedly reacted: &quot;I know I did some bad things in the past but never anything like that sort of stuff.&quot;

<text>Rose-Marie is an operetta-style musical with music by Rudolf Friml and Herbert Stothart, and book and lyrics by Otto Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein II. The story is set in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and concerns Rose-Marie La Flemme, a French Canadian girl who loves miner Jim Kenyon. When Jim falls under suspicion for murder, her brother Emile plans for Rose-Marie to marry Edward Hawley, a city man.

The work premiered on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre on September 2, 1924, running for 557 performances. It was the longest-running Broadway musical of the 1920s until it was surpassed by &quot;The Student Prince&quot; (1926). It was then produced at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London in 1925, enjoying another extraordinary run of 581 performances. It was filmed in 1928, in 1936 and again in 1954.

The best-known song from the musical is &quot;Indian Love Call&quot;. It became Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy&#x27;s &quot;signature song&quot;. Several other numbers have also become standards, including the title song.

==Background==
Producer Arthur Hammerstein, attempting to create popular new Broadway shows in the operetta tradition, sought exotic, unusual settings for his new productions. &quot;The Fortune Teller&quot; (1898) is set in Hungary, &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1907) takes place in France, and &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; (1910) features New Orleans. He sent his nephew, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Otto Harbach to Quebec, Canada, to witness a rumored magnificent ice sculpture festival. The men reported that there was not, nor had there ever been, such a festival in Quebec or any part of Canada.

Arthur Hammerstein still liked the Canadian setting, and Oscar Hammerstein II and Harbach began work on the book for a new musical set in the Canadian Rockies. Rudolf Friml and Herbert Stothart collaborated on the score, and opera star Mary Ellis was cast in the title role. British actor and singer Dennis King was cast opposite her as Jim Kenyon.

==Productions and adaptations==
;Stage versions
&quot;Rose-Marie&quot; premiered on September 2, 1924 at the Imperial Theatre in New York City, running for 557 performances. Direction was by Paul Dickey and choreography was by Dave Bennett. The orchestrations were by Robert Russell Bennett. Costumes were designed by Charles LeMaire, and settings were by Gates and Morange. It had a brief revival on Broadway in 1927.

It was then produced at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London in 1925, enjoying another extraordinary run of 581 performances. The original West End production had a chorus of eighty. It was London&#x27;s most successful Broadway show after World War I until it was surpassed by &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. In Paris&#x27;s Théâtre Mogador, &quot;Rose-Marie&quot; ran for an unprecedented 1,250 performances.

A touring company premiered the work in Canada on January 12, 1925 at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto, and the piece toured Australia and played in Paris. Other Canadian productions were given by the Variétés lyriques in 1937 and another in 1945, in French, and by Theatre Under the Stars in 1940, Melody Fair in 1951, and the Eaton Operatic Society in 1959. It was produced by the Light Opera of Manhattan several times in the 1970s and 1980s, the Shaw Festival in Canada (1981), Light Opera Works of Illinois (1987), and Ohio Light Opera in 2003.

;Film versions

The show has been filmed three times, including a silent film in 1928. Joan Crawford starred in this version, alongside James Murray. The best known film version was released in 1936, starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. Although the plot was changed, and most of the songs were dropped, it was a huge success and became MacDonald and Eddy&#x27;s best-known film. In 1954, MGM produced an Eastmancolor version in Cinemascope, which more closely followed the original plot, but it still dropped most of Friml&#x27;s songs. This version starred Ann Blyth, Howard Keel and Fernando Lamas, with Bert Lahr and Marjorie Main as comic relief. It was choreographed by Busby Berkeley.

;&quot;Little Mary Sunshine&quot;
&quot;Rose-Marie&quot; is the main (but not the only) target of the satirical musical &quot;Little Mary Sunshine&quot;, which parodies elements of the plot as well as the style of several of the songs. In particular, the song &quot;Colorado Love Call&quot; from &quot;Little Mary Sunshine&quot; is a parody of &quot;Indian Love Call&quot; from &quot;Rose-Marie&quot;.

==Synopsis==
;Act I
In Fond-du-Lac, Saskatchewan, Canada, trappers, hunters and travellers gather at &quot;Lady&quot; Jane&#x27;s hotel (&quot;Vive la Canadienne&quot;). Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Malone is flirting with Lady Jane, while wealthy city man Edward Hawley is watching a French Canadian girl, Rose-Marie La Flamme, even though she&#x27;s miner Jim Kenyon&#x27;s sweetheart. Rose-Marie&#x27;s brother, Emile, is searching for her, fearing she is alone with Jim. Wanda, a half-blooded Indian, dances close to Hawley, enraging her Indian lover, Black Eagle. Lady Jane&#x27;s man, the cowardly &quot;Hard-Boiled Herman&quot;, arrives at the bar. Jim arrives to greet Rose-Marie enthusiastically and explains to Sergeant Malone that he has given up his former wild ways because of his love for &quot;Rose-Marie&quot;. Black Eagle claims some land (and the gold on it) belonging to Jim and Herman. Herman thinks that shooting Black Eagle will solve everything, but Jim prefers to use legal means, declaring that he will visit Black Eagle and show him the boundary line the property map. Sergent Malone and &quot;The Mounties&quot; warn Herman that they will not hesitate to enforce the laws.

Emile is going to take Rose-Marie with him to the trapping grounds at Kootenay Pass. He dislikes Jim and wants her to marry Hawley for financial security. Rose-Marie doesn&#x27;t want to go, insisting to her brother that she is in love with Jim (&quot;Lak Jeem&quot;). Hawley plans to accompany Emile, but first he has to end his affair with Wanda. He plans to visit her at Black Eagle&#x27;s log cabin and bribe her to stay away from him. Jim tells Rose-Marie that he will follow her to Kootenay Pass, and they will meet in an old house he calls a castle near a valley with a beautiful echo. According to legend, Indians would call down into the valley to the girls they wished to marry (&quot;Indian Love Call&quot;).

Hawley meets Wanda at her cabin and tries to pay her off, just as Jim arrives with a map to prove his claim. Wanda sends Jim away. Black Eagle returns home and catches Wanda and Hawley embracing. He attacks Hawley, and Wanda stabs Black Eagle to save Hawley. Jim and Herman, unaware of the murder, follow Emile, Hawley, and Rose-Marie to Kootenay Pass. Jim and Rose-Marie communicate through their &quot;Indian Love Call&quot; (reprise). Emile tells Rose-Marie that she should marry Hawley because he could buy her all the &quot;Pretty Things&quot; she wants. Wanda arrives at Kootenay Pass and tells everyone that Jim is wanted for the murder of Black Eagle; his map was discovered near Black Eagle&#x27;s body.

Herman continues romancing Lady Jane (&quot;Why Shouldn&#x27;t We?&quot;). Hawley proposes to Rose-Marie, but she refuses him. He and a city girl whom he has employed, Ethel Brander, try to impress Rose-Marie with the glamour of city life in Quebec. Wanda leads an Indian &quot;Totem-Tom-Tom&quot; dance. Jim has received an offer from the Brazilian government to lead a mining project there. He asks Rose-Marie to come with him, even though it would be safer for her to go to Quebec and wait for him there. If she decides to come, they will meet at the &quot;castle&quot; and go to the United States to be married. If she does not, she should sing the Indian Love Call up the valley to him. Rose-Marie insists she will go with him; he leaves immediately, and she plans to follow twenty minutes later to avoid attracting suspicion. Sergeant Malone arrives with a warrant to arrest Jim for murder. Emile knows that Jim is hiding in the &quot;castle&quot;. He tells Rose-Marie that he will not reveal Jim&#x27;s hiding place to the Mounties if she will go to Quebec and marry Hawley. Holding back tears, Rose-Marie tells Hawley that she must sing the &quot;Indian Love Call&quot; to him, but she is really singing to Jim, telling him that she will not go with him.

;Act II
Many months have passed. Rose-Marie is about to marry Hawley in Quebec, believing that Jim was the killer. Ethel Brander has convinced her that Jim murdered Black Eagle because he loved Wanda. Herman and Lady Jane have married, and they have a shop in Quebec. He still flirts with other women, but he catches her giving Sergeant Malone &quot;Only a Kiss&quot;. Jim returns with Wanda intending for her to clear his name. But, seeing Wanda, Rose-Marie jumps to conclusions about Jim and Wanda. Rose-Marie tells Jim that she loves Hawley (&quot;I Love Him&quot;).

The wedding preparations commence (&quot;The Minuet of the Minute&quot;), and Wanda jealously threatens Hawley. Sergeant Malone prepares to arrest Jim, who is hiding in Kootenay Pass, even though Malone is troubled by the evidence. Herman suspects Wanda and gets her to confess by pretending that Hawley has accused her of the murder. Jane interrupts them and incorrectly assumes Herman is cheating on her (&quot;One Man Woman&quot;). The wedding begins (&quot;Doorway of My Dreams&quot;), but as Rose-Marie walks down the aisle, Wanda publicly confesses to the murder and declares her love for Hawley. Everyone rushes to Jim&#x27;s lodgings, and Rose-Marie goes to the pass to return Jim&#x27;s &quot;Indian Love Call&quot;. The lovers are finally united.

===Musical style===
In &quot;Rose-Marie&quot;, Friml and Stothart emulated the late 19th-century Viennese operetta style of Johann Strauss II and American composer Victor Herbert, using lilting waltzes and sweeping romantic or sentimental passages. They added to this new dance styles, notably the foxtrot (for example in the title song of the show).

==Recordings==
The operetta has been recorded a number of times. The 1925 original London cast recorded six numbers along with an orchestral medley. These recordings have been collected on a number of LP and CD editions. Al Goodman recorded the major songs in 1948 as part of his series of operetta recordings for RCA Victor. These were reissued on LP on the budget RCA Camden label in 1958.

Nelson Eddy recorded eight numbers for a Columbia Records ten-inch Lp in 1950. Around the same time, singles recorded by Eddy and MacDonald in 1936, at the time of the film&#x27;s release, were reissued in an extended Play 45-rpm disc by RCA Victor Red Seal as ERA 220. The sleeve featured a photo of the two of them as they appeared in the film. The MGM soundtrack album of the 1954 technicolor and CinemaScope remake was released on records just prior to the film&#x27;s premiere in March 1954.

The most complete recording released prior to 2022 was made in 1958 by RCA Victor (LSO-1001) starring Julie Andrews and Giorgio Tozzi. In 1961 EMI issued an LP of selections with Barbara Leigh, David Hughes, Andy Cole and Maggie Fitzgibbon (Cole and Fitzgibbon had appeared together in a 1961 London revival). The following year, Reader&#x27;s Digest included a recording of one side of highlights in their 12-record &quot;Treasury of Great Operettas&quot; set. The Smithsonian Institution recorded the complete score, performed in concert in 1981, conducted by James R. Morris, starring Debra Vanderlinde and Ron Raines, but the recording was not commercially released until 2022.

<text>The Battle of the Pyramids (), also known as the Battle of Embabeh (), was a major engagement fought on 21 July 1798, during the French invasion of Egypt. The battle took place near the village of Imbaba, across the Nile River from Cairo, but was named by Napoleon after the Great Pyramid of Giza visible nearly nine miles away.

After capturing Alexandria and crossing the desert, the French army, led by General Napoleon Bonaparte, scored a decisive victory against the main army of the local Mamluk rulers, wiping out almost the entire Ottoman army located in Egypt. It was the first battle where Bonaparte personally devised and employed the divisional square tactic to great effect. The deployment of the French brigades into these massive rectangular formations repeatedly threw back multiple cavalry charges of the Mamluks.

The victory effectively sealed the French conquest of Egypt as Murad Bey salvaged the remnants of his army, chaotically fleeing to Upper Egypt. French casualties amounted to roughly 300, but Ottoman and Mamluk casualties soared to approximately 10,000. Napoleon entered Cairo after the battle and created a new local administration under his supervision. The campaign formed part of a great global rivalry between France and Britain; the French objective was to establish a base from which to continue its campaign against British India. After the French fleet was destroyed by Horatio Nelson at the Battle of the Nile, Bonaparte marched through the Levant until his advance was stalled by Anglo-Turkish forces at Acre.

==Prelude==
After landing in Ottoman-controlled Egypt and capturing Alexandria on 2 July 1798, the French army led by General Bonaparte marched down the desert toward Cairo. They met the forces of the ruling Mamluks nine miles (15 kilometres) from the Pyramids and only four miles (6 kilometres) from Cairo. The Mamluk forces were commanded by two Georgian mamluks, Murad Bey and Ibrahim Bey, and had a force of powerful and highly trained cavalry at their command as well as fellahin militia acting as infantry.
On 13 July after French scouts located Murad&#x27;s encampment, Bonaparte ordered an advance toward the enemy&#x27;s forces, engaging them during the brief battle of Chobrakit. After the destruction of their flagship by French field artillery, the Mamluks retreated. The skirmish ended in a minor French victory.

==Battle==
On 21 July, after marching all night, the French caught up with the Ottoman force in the vicinity of the village of Embabeh. After one hour rest, the men were ordered to get ready for battle. Bonaparte ordered an advance on Murad&#x27;s army with each of the five divisions of his army organised into hollow rectangles with cavalry and baggage at the center and cannon at the corners. Bonaparte exhorted his troops to remain steady and keep their ranks closed up when facing the Mameluke cavalry.
The French divisions advanced south in echelon, with the right flank leading and the left flank protected by the Nile. From right to left, Bonaparte posted the divisions of Louis Charles Antoine Desaix, Jean-Louis-Ébénézer Reynier, Charles-François-Joseph Dugua, Honoré Vial and Louis André Bon. In addition, Desaix sent a small detachment to occupy the nearby village of Biktil, just to the west. Murad anchored his right flank on the Nile at the village of Embabeh, which was fortified and held with infantry and some ancient cannons, his left flank was anchored on the village of Biktil, where the rest of his cannons were placed there to protect from French flanking movements. His Mamluk cavalry deployed in the center, between these villages. The other Mamluk army, commanded by Ibrahim Bey, stood across the Nile and watched the events unfold, unable to cross and intervene. Murad Bey&#x27;s original plan was to repulse the French attacks on his fortified flanks, and then attack their demoralized center.

The Mamluks, being a force that was still largely feudal and medieval in all of its practical characteristics, including its military, were completely at odds with the modern standing French army. The majority of the Egyptian army was drafted Fellahin (peasants), its mainstay was the Mamluk horse. An episode during the battle that demonstrated the rift between the armies occurred when a Mamluk rider, dressed in heavy armour, rode to within only a few steps from the French lines and demanded a duel. The French responded with gunfire.

Napoleon ordered Desaix&#x27;s square to advance to the right (towards the Egyptian center) and the rest of his squares to the left (in the direction of Embebeh), Murad Bey saw an opportunity and ordered his Ayyub Bey to attack the French squares, at about 15:30, the Mamluk cavalry hurled itself at the French without warning. The divisional squares of Desaix, Reynier and Dugua held firm and repelled the horsemen with point-blank musket and artillery fire. Unable to make an impression on the French formations, some of the frustrated Mamluks rode off to attack Desaix&#x27;s detached force. This was also a failure. Meanwhile, nearer the river, Bon&#x27;s division deployed into attack columns and charged Embabeh. Breaking into the village, the French routed the garrison. Trapped against the river, many of the Mamluks and infantry tried to swim to safety, and hundreds drowned. The French reported a loss of 29 killed and 260 wounded. Murad&#x27;s losses were far heavier, perhaps as many as 10,000 including 3,000 of the elite Mamluk cavalry, and his defterdar Ayyub Bey was also killed in the battle. Murad Bey himself was also wounded in the cheek with a hit from a saber. Murad escaped to Upper Egypt with his 3,000 surviving cavalry, where he carried out an active guerrilla campaign before being defeated by Desaix in late 1799.

==Aftermath==
Upon hearing news of the defeat of their legendary cavalry, the waiting Mamluk armies in Cairo dispersed to Syria, Bonaparte entered the conquered capital of Egypt on 24 July. On 11 August French forces caught up with Ibrahim Bey inflicting on him a crushing defeat at Salalieh.

After the Battle of Pyramids, Napoleon instituted French administration in Cairo and suppressed the subsequent rebellions violently. Although Napoleon tried to co-opt the local Egyptian &quot;ulema&quot;, scholars like Al-Jabarti poured scorn on the ideas and cultural ways of the French. Despite their cordial proclamations to the natives, with some French soldiers even converting to Islam in order to take Muslim wives, clerics like Abdullah al-Sharqawi, who headed Napoleon&#x27;s Cairo government or divan, later described the French as: &quot;‘materialist, libertine philosophers … [who] deny the resurrection, and the afterlife, and … [the] prophets&quot; while for the French, mathematician Joseph Fourier regretted that &quot;the Muslim religion would on no account permit the development of the mind&quot;.

The Battle of the Pyramids signalled the beginning of the end of seven centuries of Mamluk rule in Egypt. Despite this auspicious beginning, British Admiral Horatio Nelson&#x27;s victory in the Battle of the Nile ten days later effectively ended Napoleon&#x27;s ambitions in Egypt.

==In literature and the arts==
The battle was depicted in the 2023 historical drama Napoleon, although the depiction of the battle has been heavily criticized for its historical inaccuracies, among which include Napoleon&#x27;s army shooting at the pyramids.

The battle was depicted by François-André Vincent in a sketch, and by various other artists.

<doc id="873906" wikidata="Q207751" url="?curid=873906" title="Southampton Island">
<text>Southampton Island (Inuktitut: &quot;Shugliaq&quot;) is a large island at the entrance to Hudson Bay at Foxe Basin. One of the larger members of the Arctic Archipelago, Southampton Island is part of the Kivalliq Region in Nunavut, Canada. The area of the island is stated as by Statistics Canada. It is the 34th largest island in the world and Canada&#x27;s ninth largest island. The only settlement on Southampton Island is Coral Harbour (population 1,035, 2021 Canadian census), called &quot;Salliq&quot; in Inuktitut.

Southampton Island is one of the few Canadian areas, and the only area in Nunavut, that does not use daylight saving time.

==History==
Historically speaking, Southampton Island is famous for its now-extinct inhabitants, the &quot;Sadlermiut&quot; (modern Inuktitut &quot;Sallirmiut&quot; &quot;Inhabitants of &quot;Salliq&quot;&quot;), who were the last vestige of the &quot;Tuniit&quot; or Dorset. The &quot;Tuniit&quot;, a pre-Inuit culture, officially went ethnically and culturally extinct in 1902-03 when infectious disease killed all of the &quot;Sallirmiut&quot; in a matter of weeks.

The island&#x27;s first recorded visit by Europeans was in 1613 by Welsh explorer Thomas Button.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the island was repopulated by Aivilingmiut from Naujaat and Chesterfield Inlet, influenced to do so by whaler Captain George Comer and others. Baffin Islanders arrived 25 years later. John Ell, who as a young child travelled with his mother Shoofly on Comer&#x27;s schooners, eventually became the most famous of Southampton Island&#x27;s re-settled population.

The Native Point archaeological site at the mouth of Native Bay is the largest Sadlermiut site on the island.

== Geology ==
Southampton Island has geological resources that are of scientific and industrial interest.

However, full knowledge of the island is still lacking according to the Nunavut government.

==Gallery==
==Geography==
It is separated from the Melville Peninsula by Frozen Strait. Other waterways surrounding the island include Roes Welcome Sound to the west, Bay of Gods Mercy in the southwest, Fisher Strait in the south, Evans Strait in the southeast, and Foxe Channel in the east.

Hansine Lake is located in the far north. Bell Peninsula is located in the southeastern part of the island. Mathiassen Mountain, a member of the Porsild Mountains, is the island&#x27;s highest peak. The island&#x27;s shape is vaguely similar to that of Newfoundland.

===Climate===
Southampton Island has a severe subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) which transitions into a tundra climate (&quot;ET&quot;). Like almost all of Nunavut, Southampton Island is entirely above the tree line. Coral Harbour has never gone above freezing in January, February and March (although the latter has recorded . Due to the frozen nature of Hudson Bay, there is a severe seasonal lag until June, especially compared to more continental areas such as Fairbanks despite much sunshine and perpetual twilight at night. Due to the drop of solar strength and the absence of warm water even in summer, temperatures still drop off very fast as September approaches. Cold extremes are severe, but in line with many areas even farther south in Canada&#x27;s interior.

==Fauna==
East Bay Migratory Bird Sanctuary and Harry Gibbons Migratory Bird Sanctuary are located on the island and are important breeding sites for the lesser snow goose (&quot;Anser caerulescens caerulescens&quot;). The island is also the site of two Important Bird Areas (IBAs), the Boas River wetlands in the southwest and East Bay/Native Bay in the southeast. Both host large summer colonies of the lesser snow goose, together comprising over 10% of the world&#x27;s snow goose population, with Boas River site alone hosting over 500.000 individuals nesting there. Smaller, but also important, are the colonies of the brent goose (&quot;Branta bernicla&quot;) and numerous other polar bird species there. Southampton Island is one of two main summering grounds known for bowhead whales in Hudson Bay.

<text>Vladimir Alekseyevich Solovyov (; born 11 November 1946) is a former Soviet and Russian cosmonaut.

He was selected as a cosmonaut on 1 December 1978 and flew as Flight Engineer on Soyuz T-10 and Soyuz T-15, spending a total of 361 days, 22 hours, 49 minutes in space. His first flight, Soyuz T-10, took off on 8 February 1984, to join Salyut 7. The crew spent ten months (nearly 237 days) performing numerous medical and space manufacturing experiments. They came down aboard Soyuz T-11 on 2 October 1984. Solovyov&#x27;s second flight was aboard Soyuz T-15, taking off on 13 March 1986 and coming back aboard the same craft on 16 July 1986, 125 days later. During the T-15 mission, the crew transferred equipment from Salyut-7 to the new Mir space station; they were the last aboard the former and the first aboard the latter.

Solovyov then became the Mir flight director (Russian Mission Control) for several years. He retired on 18 February 1994 but came back to head the Russian segment of the International Space Station (ISS).

Solovyov is married and has two children.

He was awarded:
* Twice Hero of the Soviet Union (2 October 1984 and 16 July 1986);
* Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR;
* Order of Honour (Russian Federation);
* Order of Friendship (Russian Federation);
* Two Orders of Lenin (USSR);
* Medal &quot;For Merit in Space Exploration&quot; (Russian Federation);
* Knight of the Legion of Honour (France);
* Kirti Chakra (India).

<doc id="873910" wikidata="Q13406117" url="?curid=873910" title="Roberta (musical)">
<text>Roberta is a musical from 1933 with music by Jerome Kern, and lyrics and book by Otto Harbach. The playful romantic comedy is based on the novel &quot;Gowns by Roberta&quot; by Alice Duer Miller. It features the songs &quot;Yesterdays&quot;, &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Begin&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Devastating&quot;, &quot;Something Had To Happen&quot;, &quot;The Touch of Your Hand&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Hard to Handle&quot;.

==Productions==
The original Broadway production opened at the New Amsterdam Theatre on November 18, 1933, and ran for 295 performances closing on 21 July 1934. It starred Tamara Drasin (billed as Tamara), Bob Hope, George Murphy, Lyda Roberti, Fred MacMurray, Fay Templeton, Ray Middleton (billed as Raymond E. Middleton), Allan Jones, and Sydney Greenstreet. Hope, Murphy, MacMurray and Greenstreet were not yet the Hollywood stars they would soon be, and Middleton was not the Broadway leading man he would become after &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;.

An Australian production opened at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Melbourne on December 22, 1934. The cast featured Madge Elliot and Cyril Ritchard.

==Original Broadway cast==

* Bob Hope as Huckleberry Haines, owner of a fashion house in Paris from America
* Tamara Drasin as Russian Princess Stephanie
* Ray Middleton as John Kent
* Fay Templeton as Aunt Minnie, also known as Roberta
* George Murphy as Billy Boyden
* Lyda Roberti as Madame Nunez / Clementina Scharwenka
* Sydney Greenstreet as Lord Henry Delves
* Fred MacMurray as California Collegian
* Allan Jones as California Collegian
* Helen Gray as Sophie Teale
* Jane Evans as Mrs. Teale
* Bobette Christine as Angele
* William Hain as Ladislaw
* Nayan Pearce as Luella Laverne
* Mavis Walsh as Marie
* Ed Jerome as Monsieur Leroux
* Berenice Alaire as Sidonie
* Gretchen Sherman as The Buyer
* Virginia Whitmore as The Flower Girl

==Other versions==
The play was made into a 1935 film by RKO starring Irene Dunne, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, and Randolph Scott. The film omitted &quot;The Touch of Your Hand&quot; (sung by a minor character), &quot;Something Had To Happen&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re Devastating&quot; (originally Middleton&#x27;s big song in the show), but added the Kern songs &quot;I Won&#x27;t Dance&quot; (lifted from the flop Kern show &quot;Three Sisters&quot;) and &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot; (written for the 1935 film and nominated for an Academy Award). These two additions became so popular that they are now frequently included in revivals and recordings of &quot;Roberta&quot;.

A radio adaptation of &quot;Roberta&quot; was presented on &quot;Philip Morris Playhouse&quot; on CBS May 14, 1943. Mary Martin and William Gargan starred in the program.

In 1952, MGM remade &quot;Roberta&quot; under the title &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot;. This remake also included the two songs added to the 1935 film. It starred Kathryn Grayson, Howard Keel, Red Skelton, Ann Miller, Gower Champion, Marge Champion, and Zsa Zsa Gabor, was made in Technicolor and reuniting four members of the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Show Boat&quot; (Grayson, Keel and the two Champions).

In 1958, it was made into a made-for-TV-movie starring Bob Hope, Anna Maria Alberghetti, Howard Keel and Janis Paige.

The show was also presented on television in a highly adapted, modernized 1969 NBC color telecast. This production was presented by Bob Hope, who reprised his original stage role, inserting many new, then-topical jokes about current events. Others in the cast included Michele Lee, John Davidson, Eve McVeagh, and Janis Paige (who sang &quot;I Won&#x27;t Dance&quot; with a male chorus).

In 2014, New World Records released a complete recording of the score, reconstructed by Larry Moore, with Rob Berman conducting the Orchestra of Ireland and a cast of American, British, and Irish performers, including Jason Graae, Annalene Beechey, Kim Criswell, Patrick Cummings, Tally Sessions, Diana Montague, Laura Daniel, Jeanne Lehman, John Molloy, and Eamonn Mulhall.

<doc id="873914" wikidata="Q582076" url="?curid=873914" title="Radboud of Utrecht">
<text>Saint Radbod (or Radboud) (before 850 – 917) was bishop of Utrecht from 899 to 917.

==Life==
Radboud was born around the middle of the 9th century from a noble Frankish family near Namur. His mother was of Frisian origin and a descendant of the Frisian king Radboud (died in 719). Radboud began his studies under the care of his maternal uncle Günther, Archbishop of Cologne, from 850 until his deposition in 863. After that Radboud continued his studies at the court school of the Western Frankish king Charles the Bald (843- 877), whose chaplain he became. Much of his life was devoted to study and science. 

After Charles&#x27;s death, he presumably became a Benedictine monk in the famous Saint-Martin convent of Tours. In 899 Radboud was elected bishop of the diocese of Utrecht with the permission of Emperor Arnulf of Carinthia (887-899). Because Utrecht was destroyed by the Normans, he did not live there but in Deventer in the Oversticht, where one of his predecessors had settled. 

As bishop, Radboud was the most important representative of East Frankish authority in the northern Netherlands. In 911, however, the Duchy of Lorraine, in which the diocese of Utrecht was located, came to the western Frankish kingdom. Radboud then seems to have wavered between loyalty to his old king or loyalty and connection with the new monarch. His most ancient biographical description criticizes him for the use of bishops in the East Frankish government, but this criticism may be the responsibility of the author. Around 914/915 he traveled to Rome where he presented a further unknown conflict with Count Meginhard of Hamaland to Pope John X (914-928); After having heard Radboud and representatives of Meginhard, the pope found a settlement. 

Radboud made preparations to take the seat in Utrecht again. To do so, he drew up a list of all the possessions of the diocese before the expulsion by the Normans. Radboud fell ill on a mission trip in Drenthe and died in Ootmarsum in November 917 before these plans could be executed. He was buried in the Lebuïnuskerk, Deventer. 

He had appointed his successor, Balderik, himself.

==Writings== 
A number of smaller writings are attributed to Radboud, but there are doubts about his authorship. Most of the writings are saints&#x27; lives, some in prose, others in verses. He described the life of the Anglo-Saxon missionaries Boniface (in prose), Suitbert and Lebuïnus (both in a sermon and in verses), as well as St. Amalberga (?) and Bishop Saint Servatius of Maastricht .

==Veneration==
He was buried in the Lebuin Church of Deventer. Several sources, including historian Johan Picardt, indicate that his intestines have been buried in the church in Nijenstede. During the Middle Ages, the veneration of Saint Radboud remained limited to the diocese of Utrecht. His feast day is 29 November.

===Patronage=== 
In the Netherlands, Radboud is the patron of Catholic scientific practice. In 1905, the St. Radboud Foundation was established with the aim of promoting Catholic higher education in the Netherlands and in particular the establishment of a Catholic university. In 1923 the Catholic University of Nijmegen was opened, in 1956 the associated Sint-Radboud hospital (now Radboudumc). On 1 September 2004, the university adopted the name Radboud University Nijmegen.

<text>Fatu-Hiva (the &quot;H&quot; is not pronounced, see name section below) is the southernmost island of the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia, an overseas territory of France in the Pacific Ocean. With Motu Nao as its closest neighbour, it is also the most isolated of the inhabited islands.

&quot;Fatu Hiva&quot; is also the title of a book by explorer and archaeologist Thor Heyerdahl, in which he describes his stay on the island in the 1930s.

==Name==
The name of the island in Marquesan is Fatu Iva (without &quot;h&quot;: ). However, the name was recorded by Europeans as &quot;Fatu-Hiva,&quot; perhaps under the influence of other Marquesan islands containing the element &quot;Hiva&quot; (Nuku-Hiva and Hiva-Oa) and also because in French the letter &quot;h&quot; is silent. The spelling &quot;Fatu-Hiva&quot; has now become official.

The island was named &quot;Isla Magdalena&quot; (&quot;Magdalene Island&quot;) by Spanish explorers in the 16th century, a name rarely used.

Hatauheva is another name form that appears in 1817, by Camille de Roquefeuil during his voyage around the world on the &quot;Bordelais&quot;.

The spelling Fatou-Hiva appears in 1838 in a work by Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville.

==History==
=== First settlers ===
Like the other islands of the archipelago, Fatu Iva was originally populated by Polynesians, who probably came from Western Polynesia.

Rivalries between the different valleys were frequent. In one of them, around the middle of the 19th century, the Anainoapa tribe of Hanavave and the Tiu of Omoa confronted each other. The latter, defeated, fled the island on bamboo rafts and ended up in the Tuamotus, on Napuka Atoll, where their descendants still live. The Tiu sorcerer, who remained on Fatu Iva, revealed to the victors the names of the places in the valley (a way of acknowledging their sovereignty), and had himself buried alive, head down, symbolizing his defeat and the end of his tribe.

Little is known of Fatu Hiva culture before European influence, as it was greatly affected by the arrival of the missionaries. Stratified tribal societies were formed in the great valleys, as in the rest of the Marquesas Islands. In 1897, the German explorer Karl von den Steinen described nine tribes inhabiting the Hanamoohe, Hanateone, Hanahouuna, Ouia, Hanavave and Omoa valleys. In the Hanavave valley, four tribes are known from the stones.

Systematic archaeological excavations have not yet been carried out. Surface investigations were carried out by the American anthropologist Ralph Linton on behalf of the Bishop Museum of Honolulu in 1920–1921. The finds are less numerous than on the other islands of the Marquesas and indicate less extensive building activity. Linton found the remains of several tohua (ceremonial and power centers) with dwelling platforms (paepae) and small me&#x27;ae in the Omoa Valley. This led Linton to suspect that several tribes had resided there. During his brief visit to the Hanavave Valley, Linton was only able to find small remains of a tohua and a ceremonial stone platform. Unlike the other islands of the Marquesas, the dead of Fatu Hiva were occasionally mummified (smoked) and often buried in the dwellings.

No colossal stone statues have been found on the island, but some small, crude stone sculptures have been preserved. This does not mean that there were no outstanding works of art on Fatu Hiva in prehistoric times. The island was known for tattoo artists and wood carvers, whose ephemeral works have barely survived the ages.

=== European exploration and colonization ===

From a Western perspective, the first explorer to discover Fatu Iva was the Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña, on 21 July 1595. It was the first island in the archipelago that he saw, but he was unable to land there because he could not find a safe anchorage. He mistakenly believed that he had found the Solomon Islands, the goal of his voyage, before realizing that he had just discovered a new land. He named the archipelago &quot;Marquesas de Mendoza&quot;, in honor of the viceroy of Peru at the time, who had helped him launch his expedition, &quot;wishing to show his gratitude for the help he had given him&quot;. As Mendaña arrived during the vigil of St. Mary Magdalene in 1595, he named the place Isla Magdalena.

In 1937 and 1938, Norwegian anthropologist and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl and his wife Liv lived for a year and a half in Fatu Iva, first in Omoa and then in Ouia, a now deserted valley on the eastern coast of the island. Officially commissioned by the University of Oslo to investigate the distribution and spread of animal species among the Polynesian islands, his most personal goal on this trip, which was also his wedding trip, was to &quot;sail the South Seas&quot; and never return. The couple landed on Omoa in 1937, but found that civilization was still too much for their liking. They crossed the island and settled in Ouia, on the east coast of the island, a valley formerly inhabited by marqueses. However, after a year and a half, mosquitoes, disease and bad weather dampened their enthusiasm. He recounted his experience in the book Paa Jakt efter Paradiset (1938), rewritten in 1974 and published as Fatu Hiva, the return to nature.

In the early 1960s, until 1966, most of the island&#x27;s men went to work in Moruroa, in the Tuamotu archipelago, on the construction of the Pacific [Nuclear] Experimental Center.

On 11 March 2011, Swiss explorer Raphaël Domjan, expedition leader of the PlanetSolar adventure, the first ship to circumnavigate the planet on solar power, called at Fatu Hiva.

==Geography==

The eastern coastline of Fatu-Hiva is characterized by a number of narrow valleys, carved by streams that lead to the interior. Between these valleys are headlands which terminate in cliffs that plunge directly into the sea, making travel between them possible only by travelling over the high mountain ridges between them, or by boat. The largest of these valleys is at Uia.

The western coastline has two significant bays, Hana Vave (also known as Bay of Virgins or &quot;Baie des Vierges&quot;) in the north, one of the most picturesque sites in the South Pacific, and the well-protected harbor of Omoa near the south. There are several smaller valleys between these two.

The centre of the island is a plateau which is covered largely by tall grasses and pandanus trees. To the south of the plateau, running to the south, is a mountain ridge, called Tauauoho, its highest peak, at 1,125 m (3,691  ft.) is the highest point on Fatu-Hiva. Proceeding to the north and northwest from the plateau is a mountain ridge called Fa‘e One, the highest peak of which is 820 m (2,690 ft.).

=== Geology ===
Fatu Hiva is formed by the eastern half of two interlocking volcanoes.

The first caldera, about eight kilometers in diameter, has a sharply cut rim, formed by a hemicircular series of peaks rising to over 1000 meters. It is composed mainly of basalt, picrite and hawaiite. Its age is dated between 2.46 and 1.81 million years. The second caldera, located within the first, has a diameter of three to four kilometers. It was created by a powerful eruption, as evidenced by the impressive basalt columns, the &quot;statues&quot; of the Virgin, in Hanavave Bay, caused by lahars. It dates to between 1.68 and 1.33 million years ago. The main explosion seems to date back to 1.40 Ma2.

The valleys of the two villages of the island are located at the extremes of the space between the two calderas.

=== Flora ===

The landscape surrounding the settlements in the coastal zone and in the valleys has been extensively remodelled for human food production, so little of the original vegetation remains. Massive interventions, already in historical times, probably caused the extinction of an unknown number of endemic and native plants in the lower and middle areas of the island. The present inhabitants cultivate breadfruit, coconut, yam, taro, sweet potatoes, bananas and other fruits.

The higher areas of the mountainous island are covered with mountain rainforest and cloud forest interspersed with tree ferns. Above 600 m, grass forests, with the trees &quot;Metrosideros&quot; sp. and &quot;Pterophylla marquesana&quot;, dominate. However, even these inaccessible areas are threatened as feral goats are seriously affecting the flora. Peak tops and extensive leeward areas of the mountains are arid.

The mountain rainforest still harbours some endemic plants, such as &quot;Ochrosia fatuhivensis&quot; and &quot;Melicope fatuhivensis&quot; (syn. &quot;Pelea fatuhivensis&quot;), a tree of the Rutaceae family which may already be extinct. &quot;Pterophylla tremuloides&quot; is an endemic shrub which grows in low ridge top and cliff shrubland with &quot;Metrosideros, Dicranopteris&quot; and &quot;Lycopodium&quot; from 700 to 850 metres elevation.
A systematic study of the flora with the support of the Smithsonian Institution in 1988 revealed the number of 175 native, 21 endemic, and 136 anthropochoric plants.

=== Fauna ===
The rich flora contrasts with a relatively species-poor fauna. It is limited to land and sea birds, small mammals, insects, spiders and lizards. The Fatu Hiva monarch (&quot;Pomarea whitneyi&quot;), a bird of the family Monarchidae, is endemic.

==Administration==
Administratively, Fatu-Hiva forms the commune (municipality) of Fatu-Hiva, part of the administrative subdivision of the Marquesas Islands. The commune consists solely of Fatu-Hiva itself. Its administrative seat is the settlement of Omoa, on the island&#x27;s southwestern side.

==Demographics==

Fatu-Hiva&#x27;s population was 584 at the 2002 census, 611 in 2012, and 600 in 2022. Its main villages are Omoa, the capital and Hanavave, in the bays of the same name. The population lives mainly from agriculture, handicrafts and tourism. The island&#x27;s orography does not allow the construction of an airstrip; it is accessible only by boat.

Fatu-Hiva experienced a demographic decline beginning in the late 1990s, mainly due to two types of emigration:

* School emigration, as there is no secondary school on the island and young people must leave at a young age—first to Hiva Oa, then to Papeete—to pursue their studies. Many do not return to Fatu-Hiva afterwards.
* Economic emigration, as the island&#x27;s development prospects are limited by its isolation. It is the most remote of the islands of the archipelago, and its rugged terrain prevents the building of an airstrip.

However, since 2007 there has been a demographic recovery, with a 4% increase in five years, spread primarily across the villages of Hana Vave, Omoa and Uia.
=== Religion ===
The island was converted to Christianity by Catholic missionaries in 1877. The Catholic Church administers two religious buildings on the island under the Diocese of Taiohae (&quot;Dioecesis Taiohaënus&quot; &quot;seu Humanae Telluris&quot; or &quot;Diocèse de Taiohae&quot;): The Church of Saint Michael in Hanavave (&quot;Église de Saint-Michel&quot;), and the Church of Our Lady of Peace in Omoa (&quot;Église de Notre-Dame-de-Paix&quot;).

== Economy ==
The primary sector is still predominant, especially tuna, mackerel, bonito, swordfish and marlin fishing, as well as crayfish. The municipality has a cold storage facility that allows waiting for the arrival of cargo ships to sell the merchandise. Copra cultivation is still very important, as is the more recent cultivation of 
noni. Coffee cultivation was practically abandoned in the second half of the 20th century. For their personal needs, the inhabitants also hunt wild pigs and goats, and gather seafood and fruit in great abundance. They do not hesitate to offer fruit spontaneously to visitors.

Since the 1960s and 1970s, handicrafts have developed considerably, thanks mainly to tourism. The Island&#x27;s speciality is the tapa. Today they are still made in the traditional way, mainly in monochrome. However, chemical dyes are now used instead of soot from the luminous walnut.

The currency is the CFP franc, which is pegged to the euro.

The islanders live mainly from subsistence farming. Selling monoi oil, carvings and painted bark raffia to infrequent cruise ship tourists and other sailors generates some income.

=== Tourism ===

Tourism is limited due to the lack of an airport, though the island is visited by cruise ships. There is only limited tourist infrastructure, with no banks, ATM machines or taxis, and only limited accommodation. Fatu Hiva has no bathing beaches.

The three-hour hike between the two villages is steep but offers views of the island, ocean and waterfalls.

The Grélet Museum in Omoa holds a collection of local artifacts, including war clubs, tikis and carved wood bowls.

== Politics and government ==
Politically, the island belongs to French Polynesia (Pays d&#x27;outre-mer - POM) and is therefore affiliated with the European Union. It is administered by a subdivision (&quot;Subdivision administrative des Îles Marquises&quot;) of the High Commissariat of the Republic in French Polynesia (&quot;Haut-commissariat de la République en Polynésie française&quot;) based in Papeete. Fatu Hiva forms an independent municipality (&quot;Commune de Fatu Hiva&quot;) with 636 inhabitants (2012), the population density is about 7 inhabitants/km2.

The official language is French. The main town and administrative centre is the village of Omoa, on the west coast, with about 250 inhabitants.

== Infrastructure ==

The inhabitants of this 8,400 hectare island live mainly in the villages of Omoa and Hanavave, on the west coast, which are connected by a dirt road through the mountains. The largest of the villages is Omoa, with a Catholic church, a nursery and elementary school, a small shop, a post office and a satellite telephone. Fatu Hiva has no paved roads between the two villages, no harboir dock for large ships and no airfield. Safe landing on the difficult-to-access coast is only possible in the two bays on the west coast, where the villages are also located.

The seventeen-kilometre road linking the two villages is very bumpy, especially near Hanavave, and the rains often make the road sweeping and dangerous for traffic. The inhabitants prefer to use a boat to reach the other village, which takes about 15 minutes.

== Fatu Hiva in literature ==
The island became better known through the book of the same name by Thor Heyerdahl, who spent about eight months on the island in 1937 with his first wife Liv in a self-imposed robinsonade. The couple lived first near the west coast in the Omoa Valley, and later on the east coast in Ouia, which is now uninhabited. In 1937 there was also an old man named Tei Tetua, by his own account the son of one of the last true cannibals, who lived there accompanied by his twelve-year-old adopted daughter.

A first book about the stay was published in 1938 by Gyldendal in Oslo, sold poorly despite the best reviews and was never translated, probably also because of the war. Heyerdahl&#x27;s well-known book Fatu Hiva was later rewritten, according to the author&#x27;s note: After the success of his book his first work had become outdated.

In Jack London&#x27;s short story collection &quot;A Son of the Sun&quot;, the island appears under the name Fitu-Iva. In the story &quot;Feathers of the Sun,&quot; Fitu-Iva falls under the influence of a cunning Solomon Islands swindler who, with the connivance of the ever-elusive chief, introduces paper money and exchanges all valuables for domestically manufactured currency. When the fraud is discovered, he is beaten with a dead pig, a particularly dishonorable punishment, and banished from the island.

<text>Oleg Yur&#x27;yevich At&#x27;kov (Russian: Оле́г Ю́рьевич Атько́в; born 9 May 1949) is a Russian cardiologist and former Soviet cosmonaut. With a doctorate from the Russian Academy of Medical Science, Atkov was chosen to be the health specialist on board Soyuz T-10 and Soyuz T-11. After Atkov&#x27;s rather long time in space, he returned to work at the Myasnikov Institute of Clinical Cardiology to continue his research on the adaptation of weightlessness and cardiology. With his published research and time in space, Atkov holds two of the USSR&#x27;s highest honors; the Order of Lenin and the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Atkov is a professor of medicine at the Russian National Research Medical University and currently serves as the vice president of Russian Railways.

==Early life==
Oleg Yur&#x27;yevich Atkov was born May 9, 1949, in Khvorostyanka, the former USSR. In 1973, Atkov graduated from I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University. After his studies at the university, he worked on postgraduate training and received from the Russian Academy of Medical sciences his doctorate in cardiology. Upon receiving his doctorate, Atkov started as a research fellow at the Myasnikov Institute of Clinical Cardiology of the Academy of Sciences and soon became the senior research fellow. He gained some fame in his field when he discovered a method to diagnose cardiovascular diseases using ultrasound.

==Cosmonaut career==
Atkov is notable for his lengthy time in orbit, with a total flight time of 236 days, 22 hours, and 49 minutes. As a cardiologist, it was his duty to monitor the health of the other cosmonauts on board and to research the long term effects of zero gravity on the human body.

In 1977, Oleg Atkov joined the training group of the Soviet cosmonauts. On September 3, 1983 Dr. Atkov was selected to be part of the AMN selection group along with Ural Sultanov and Magomed Tolboyev. On February 8, 1984 Atkov made a spaceward flight as a cosmonaut-researcher at the spaceship &quot;Soyuz T-10V&quot;.

In 1984, a space flight was performed on board the orbital complex Salyut-7-Soyuz-T. The crew consisted of Oleg Atkov (Cosmonaut Researcher), member Leonid Kizim (the commander), and Vladimir Solovyov (the Flight-Engineer). As the cardiologist, Atkov brought with him his own invention—a portable ultrasound cardiograph—which he would use to oversee the crew&#x27;s health throughout their time in space. The initiative for this team was to continue a major medical task that would advance the study of the acute stage of adaptation to weightlessness, phenomenology, and mechanisms of changes in hemodynamics, metabolism, and other functions. At the end of the Soyuz T-10 expedition, Atkov had estimated a total of 87 days spent on flight dedicated to medical work. When the three cosmonauts landed back on Earth they realized that they had become the new space endurance record holders, staying up in space over a month longer than Soyuz T-5. The crew spent a total of 236 days, 22 hours, and 49 minutes in space.

===In-space research===
While in flight, Dr. Atkov had the primary duty of researching the long term effects of space flight such as what happens to the body over the course of a year in zero gravity. Measurements were consecutively taken using echocardiographic and biochemical systems. In addition, studies were conducted on vestibular and sensory organs. In order to avoid muscle deterioration and keep the crew members active, the cosmonauts exercised for an hour twice a day three days in a row, with an &quot;active rest&quot; day in between where they were encouraged to take water-salt supplements.

==Post-cosmonaut career==
When Atkov returned to Earth he ended his cosmonaut career by retiring on October 2, 1984. Atkov&#x27;s decision led to the return to the Myasnikov Institute of Clinical Cardiology, where he became Head of Department of new diagnostic methods. Once he finished at the Myasnikov Institute, he soon became the Deputy-Director of the Department of Space Life Science at the International Space University in Strasbourg, France in 1989 to 1996.

During most of his career, Atkov was dedicated to researching the importance of telemedicine. He has since written about 150 published articles and has done several monographs. In addition, Atkov has created 15 inventions and holds several patents. He has helped and supervised 30 candidates from Russia for the Doctor of Medical Science and five candidates for a master&#x27;s degree in space studies at the International Space University.

After Atkov&#x27;s time in space, he decided to dedicate most of his work towards the Russian railways and cardiology. Atkov has now been a part of 15 projects that produced a new type of technology to help with cardiology research. He also holds several patents. One invention was a device for positioning cardiograph sensor. This invention had seven other cardiology specialist involved. The main objective was to create something that could hold and maneuver an echocardiograph and an electrocardiograph at the same time while not being in the way. Another notable invention was the Photogrammetrical plotting projector apparatus for radial nadir point triangulation. This invention was to make sure that a Photogrammetrical plotting projector could take what images it needs at the correct angles and explore now angles that images could be taken from. Atkov was not the leader of this project but he helped experiments and design.

===Russian Railways===
In 2000, Dr. Atkov became the President of the Russian Telemedicine Association. Two years after this, he would become the Head of the Health Department of the Ministry of Railways of Russian Federation (soon to be reformed to the JSC Russian Railways) where he would promote and continue his work in telemedicine. In August 2005 he was promoted to be the Vice-President Russian Railways JSC while keeping his responsibility and focus in healthcare.

===Current opinions===
In a 2012 interview with 3 Eyes Observer, Dr. Atkov was questioned about the future of space exploration. He answered the question by saying that we need to focus on returning to the Moon, but with a different goal than the space race that occurred half a century prior. He told the interviewer that space exploration used to be two superpower nations, the United States and the Soviet Union, racing against each other. However space travel should now be more focused on establishing an international base on the surface of the Moon in order to create an &quot;outpost for Universe observation and solar system observation.&quot; Additionally, he added that there should be a focus on reaching Mars as well, but that those two goals should be prepared in safe conditions because of the known hazards that will be found.

==Medical research==
Once Dr. Atkov returned from space, he participated in many research studies. These studies included coronary heart disease research, &quot;The Variations of Intrathoracic Amount of Blood as a Reason of ECG Voltage Changes,&quot; and several other projects.

===Coronary heart disease research===
Oleg Atkov, and other scientist conducted a research titled the Coronary heart disease diagnosis by artificial neural networks including genetic polymorphisms and clinical parameters. The members of this research include Oleg Yu. Atkov, MD, PhDa, Svetlana G. Gorokhova, MD, PhDb, Alexandr G. Sboev, PhDc, Eduard V. Generozov, PhDd, Elena V. Muraseyeva, MD, PhDe, Svetlana Y. Moroshkinad, and Nadezhda N. Cherniyc.“The goal of this study was to develop an artificial neural networks-based diagnostic model for coronary heart disease using traditional and genetic factors of CHD (Coronary heart disease). In summary, this study was used to create CHD diagnostic models with the appropriate analytical characteristics. These characteristics consisted of using MLP artificial neural networks. The best accuracy was provided in models that had both genetic and non-genetic factors associated with CHD. The models that had less than a 90% accuracy could potentially serve as a basis for development of software tools for diagnosis and predictors for CHD.

===The effect of ECG Voltage Changes on Variations of Intrathoracic Amount of Blood===
Oleg Atkov participated in a study titled &quot;The Variations of Intrathoracic Amount of Blood as a Reason of ECG Voltage Changes.&quot; Marina Saltykova Ph.D.1, Andre Capderou M.D., Ph.D.2, Oleg Atkov M.D.1, Victor Gusakov M.S.3, Gennagiy Konovalov M.S.3, Leonid Voronin M.D.3, Rustem Kaspranskiy M.D.3, Valeriy Morgun M.D.3, Olivier Bailliart M.D., Ph.D.4, Milan Cermack M.D.5 and Pierre Vaïda M.D.6 were the members of this team. “The main goal of the study was to estimate the influence of the variations of thoracic electroconduction, and heart volume on QRS voltage in humans due to gravity change.” The balance between changes of degree of short circuiting by changes in the amount of blood in thorax and the changes of distance between heart and electrodes as a result of position, form, and volume of the heart are what influence the steadiness.

===Atkov&#x27;s inventions===
After Atkov&#x27;s time in space, he dedicated most of his work towards the Russian railways and cardiology. Within the cardiology field, Atkov has been a part of 15 major projects that has helped advance the types of technology in cardiology research. He also holds several patents for inventions he produced or helped develop. One of his major inventions was a device for positioning a cardiograph sensor. This invention had seven other cardiology specialist involved. The main objective was to create something that could hold and maneuver an Echocardiograph and an Electrocardiograph at the same time while not being in the way of physicians. This device has paved the way towards greater and more advanced technology for better ultrasound techniques. Another notable invention was the Photogrammetrical plotting projector apparatus for radial nadir point triangulation. This invention was to make sure that a Photogrammetrical plotting projector could take what images it needs at the correct angles and explore new angles that images could be taken from. This device helped physicians and patients take difficult images that may not have been possible before. Attkov was not the patent holder for this device but he was the head for the design and prototype. Atkov has been a part of many other cardiology technology developments but most were small or did not impact the cardiology field as much as the device for positioning a cardiograph sensor or the Photogrammetrical plotting projector apparatus for radial nadir point triangulation.

<text>Cedar Creek (from ) is the largest tributary of the St. Joseph River, draining in the Eastern Corn Belt Plains of northeastern Indiana. It is long, rising in northwestern DeKalb County and joining the St. Joseph just below the Cedarville Dam in Allen County.

==Origins and history==
Upper Cedar Creek originated as an ice-marginal channel at the western edge of the Erie Lobe of the Wisconsin Glacier and formed a single stream with the southwest-flowing Eel River which connected to the Wabash River. Lower Cedar Creek was a tributary of the ancestral Eel, carrying glacial meltwater under the ice through a tunnel valley known today as Cedar Creek Canyon. Blockage of the Eel&#x27;s channel by outwash from the canyon and a decline in the volume of meltwater caused lower Cedar Creek to reverse its flow. In so doing, it captured the flow of the upper Eel, a classic example of &quot;stream piracy&quot; that shifted Cedar Creek&#x27;s drainage (about 175,000 acres) from the Eel-Wabash system to that of the St. Joseph-Maumee.

Once a meandering stream, upper Cedar Creek was channelized (straightened and deepened) in the early 20th century for agricultural and urban drainage, which has increased the watershed&#x27;s vulnerability to erosion and contaminated runoff. Once home to 27 species of freshwater mussel, Cedar Creek has experienced a drastic decline in mussel population since the 1980s.

==Course==
Cedar Creek originates at Indian Lake (41º27&#x27;51&quot; N 85º10&#x27;11&quot; W), northwest of Corunna, Indiana, and comes into formal existence downstream at Cedar Lake. Its DeKalb County section flows east-southeast from Indian Lake, loops around Waterloo, passes through Auburn, then angles southwest until it enters Allen County, where it is crossed by Indiana State Road 327 south of Garrett before turning back to the southeast toward Leo-Cedarville.

Lower Cedar Creek, from river mile 13.7 to its confluence with the St. Joseph, is officially designated as an &quot;Outstanding State Resource Water&quot; and is one of four streams in Indiana&#x27;s Natural, Scenic and Recreational Rivers system.

<doc id="873929" wikidata="Q4783436" url="?curid=873929" title="Arabic numeral variations">
<text>There are various stylistic and typographic variations to the Arabic numeral system.

==Old-style numerals==
The numerals used by Western countries have two forms: &quot;lining&quot; (&quot;in-line&quot; or &quot;full-height&quot;) figures as seen on a typewriter and taught in North America, and &quot;old-style&quot; figures, in which numerals 0, 1 and 2 are at x-height; numerals 6 and 8 have bowls within x-height, and ascenders; numerals 3, 5, 7 and 9 have descenders from x-height; and the numeral 4 rests along the baseline. Lining figures are generally designed all the same setting width, as this makes the printing of mathematical and trigonometrical tables simpler to do and clearer to read. Non-lining figures tend to be preferred where numbers occur within sentences, for instance when a date is given in figures in a line of text.

British presses have been partial to &quot;old-style&quot; numerals, even though typewriters cannot print them and they are not assigned separate Unicode values. The old-style numeral &quot;one&quot; can resemble a capital &quot;I&quot; reduced to x-height, and this can lead to confusion e.g. of the number 11 (when written in old-style digits) with the Roman numeral II (meaning the number two). On the other hand, with some sans serif faces, using lining figures, there can be confusion between the figure 1, lower case l (L) and upper case I (I).

==Slashed zero==

A distinction exists between the Danish/Norwegian letter &quot;Ø,&quot; the Latin letter &quot;O,&quot; and the numeral &quot;0&quot;.
Handwritten data to be typed into a computer necessitates having a distinction between the letter &quot;O&quot; and numeral &quot;0&quot;. In English-speaking countries, zero was often slashed in technical writing, and was used in many computer keyboards, screens and printing methods. Some early computerized systems for managers assumed that the numeral would be entered more often than the letter, so they slashed the letter instead. In time this became a minority practice, and it is very confusing for Danish and Norwegian speaking people.

There are three ways of ticking the numeral zero to make it distinct from the letters O and Ø. A tick in the upper right corner derives from the earlier practice, a tick in the upper left corner is used to prevent confusion with all earlier practices, and the very-low-resolution typeface &quot;Fixedsys&quot; has an internal tick, that does not extend beyond the bowl, in both the upper right and lower left. This is the most elegant, but it would take quite a flourish to write it on hundreds of inventory tags. Scandinavian countries prefer a numeral zero with a dot in the middle, although low-resolution displays can confuse this with a numeral eight, and it takes longer to assuredly make a dot with a ballpoint pen than making a tick.

==Other variations==
The &quot;Crossed Seven&quot; is commonly used throughout Continental Europe, but, outside of mathematics, is only sporadically used in the British Isles or the United States, and it is not permitted to be written on some inventory tags that are optically read by computers.

There are two forms of the numeral one used in France, as seen on Citroën cowls:
*numeral one with a long initial stroke and an underserif; and
*numeral one with a long initial stroke that starts below the underserif and is concave upward.

Central Europe uses a &#x27;one&#x27; that has two half-serifs so it looks somewhat like a &#x27;Z&#x27;. The region further uses a numeral four that looks like a lightning bolt, and in some areas of Eastern Europe, as seen on Romanian tanks, there is a numeral four that does not have a closed loop, but has a Greek cross form of strokes. Usually the numeral two is not slashed, whereas the letter Z is, because the handwritten form could be confused with the numeral two.

<doc id="873932" wikidata="Q868561" url="?curid=873932" title="PCI-X">
<text>PCI-X, short for Peripheral Component Interconnect eXtended, is a computer bus and expansion card standard that enhances the 32-bit PCI local bus for higher bandwidth demanded mostly by servers and workstations. It uses a modified protocol to support higher clock speeds (up to 133 MHz), but is otherwise similar in electrical implementation. PCI-X 2.0 added speeds up to 533 MHz, with a reduction in electrical signal levels.

The slot is physically a 3.3 V PCI slot, with the same size, location and pin assignments. The electrical specifications are compatible, but stricter. However, while most conventional PCI slots are the 85 mm long 32-bit version, most PCI-X devices use the 130 mm long 64-bit slot, to the point that 64-bit PCI connectors and PCI-X support are seen as synonymous.

PCI-X is specified for both 32- and 64-bit PCI connectors, and PCI-X 2.0 added a 16-bit variant for embedded applications.

PCI-X has been replaced in modern designs by the similar-sounding PCI Express (PCIe), with a different physical connector and a different electrical design, having one or more serial lanes instead of a number of slower parallel connections.

==History==

===Background and motivation===

In PCI, a transaction that cannot be completed immediately is postponed by either the target or the initiator issuing retry-cycles, during which no other agents can use the PCI bus. Since PCI lacks a split-response mechanism to permit the target to return data at a later time, the bus remains occupied by the target issuing retry-cycles until the read data is ready. In PCI-X, after the master issues the request, it disconnects from the PCI bus, allowing other agents to use the bus. The split-response containing the requested data is generated only when the target is ready to return all of the requested data. Split-responses increase bus efficiency by eliminating retry-cycles, during which no data can be transferred across the bus.

PCI also suffered from the relative scarcity of unique interrupt lines. With only 4 interrupt pins (INT A/B/C/D), systems with many PCI devices require multiple functions to share an interrupt line, complicating host-side interrupt-handling. PCI-X added Message Signaled Interrupts, an interrupt system using writes to host-memory. In MSI-mode, the function&#x27;s interrupt is not signaled by asserting an INTx line. Instead, the function performs a memory-write to a system-configured region in host-memory. Since the content and address are configured on a per-function basis, MSI-mode interrupts are dedicated instead of shared. A PCI-X system allows both MSI-mode interrupts and legacy INTx interrupts to be used simultaneously (though not by the same function).

The lack of registered I/Os limited PCI to a maximum frequency of 66 MHz. PCI-X I/Os are registered to the PCI clock, usually through means of a PLL to actively control I/O delay the bus pins. The improvement in setup time allows an increase in frequency to 133 MHz.

Some devices, most notably Gigabit Ethernet cards, SCSI controllers (Fibre Channel and Ultra320), and cluster interconnects could by themselves saturate the PCI bus&#x27;s 133 MB/s bandwidth. Ports using a bus speed doubled to 66 MHz and a bus width doubled to 64 bits (with the pin count increased to 184 from 124), in combination or not, have been implemented. These extensions were loosely supported as optional parts of the PCI 2.x standards, but device compatibility beyond the basic 133 MB/s continued to be difficult.

Developers eventually used the combined 64-bit and 66-MHz extension as a foundation, and, anticipating future needs, established 66-MHz and 133-MHz variants with a maximum bandwidth of 532 MB/s and 1064 MB/s respectively. The joint result was submitted as PCI-X to the PCI Special Interest Group (Special Interest Group of the Association for Computing Machinery). Subsequent approval made it an open standard adoptable by all computer developers. The PCI SIG controls technical support, training, and compliance testing for PCI-X. IBM, Intel, Microelectronics, and Mylex were to develop supporting chipsets. 3Com and Adaptec were to develop compatible peripherals. To accelerate PCI-X adoption by the industry, Compaq offered PCI-X development tools at their Web site.

===PCI-X 1.0===
The PCI-X standard was developed jointly by IBM, HP, and Compaq and submitted for approval in 1998. It was an effort to codify proprietary server extensions to the PCI local bus to address several shortcomings in PCI, and increase performance of high bandwidth devices, such as Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and Ultra3 SCSI cards, and allow processors to be interconnected in clusters.

Intel gave only a qualified welcome to PCI-X, stressing that the next generation bus would have to be a &quot;fundamentally new architecture&quot;. Without Intel&#x27;s support, PCI-X failed to be adopted in PCs. According to Rick Merritt of the EE Times, &quot;A falling-out between the PCI SIG and a key Intel interconnect designer who spearheaded development on the Accelerated Graphics Port caused Intel to pull out of the initial PCI-X effort&quot;. The PCI-X interface was however briefly adopted by Apple, for the first few generations of the Power Macintosh G5.

The first PCI-X products were manufactured in 1998, such as the Adaptec AHA-3950U2B dual Ultra2 Wide SCSI controller, however at that point the PCI-X connector was merely referred to as &quot;64-bit ready PCI&quot; on packaging, hinting at future forward compatibility. Actual PCI-X branding only became standard later, likely coinciding with widespread availability of PCI-X equipped motherboards. When more details of PCI Express were released in August 2001, PCI SIG chairman Roger Tipley expressed his belief that &quot;PCI-X is going to be in servers forever because it serves a certain level of functionality, and it may not be compelling to switch to 3GIO [PCI Express] for that functionality. We learned that from not being able to get rid of ISA. ISA hung around because of all of these systems that weren&#x27;t high-volume parts.&quot; Tipley also announced that (at the time) the PCI SIG was planning to fold PCI Express and PCI-X 2.0 into a single work tentatively called PCI 3.0, but that name was eventually used for a relatively minor revision of conventional PCI.

===PCI-X 2.0===
In 2003, the PCI SIG ratified PCI-X 2.0. It adds 266-MHz and 533-MHz variants, yielding roughly 2,132 MB/s and 4,266 MB/s throughput, respectively. PCI-X 2.0 makes additional protocol revisions that are designed to help system reliability and add Error-correcting codes to the bus to avoid re-sends. To deal with one of the most common complaints of the PCI-X form factor, the 184-pin connector, 16-bit ports were developed to allow PCI-X to be used in devices with tight space constraints. Similar to PCI-Express, PtP functions were added to allow for devices on the bus to talk to each other without burdening the CPU or bus controller.

Despite the various theoretical advantages of PCI-X 2.0 and its backward compatibility with PCI-X and PCI devices, it has not been implemented on a large scale (). This lack of implementation primarily is because hardware vendors have chosen to integrate PCI Express instead.

IBM was one of the (few) vendors which provided PCI-X 2.0 (266 MHz) support in their System i5 Model 515, 520 and 525; IBM advertised these slots as suitable for 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapters, which they also provided. HP offered PCI-X 2.0 in some ProLiant and Integrity servers and offered dual-port 4 Gbit/s Fibre Channel adapters, also operating at 266 MHz. AMD supported PCI-X 2.0 (266 MHz) via its 8132 Hypertransport to PCI-X 2.0 tunnel chip. ServerWorks was a vocal supporter of PCI-X 2.0 (to the detriment of the first generation PCI Express) particularly through its chief Raju Vegesna, who was however fired soon thereafter for roadmap disagreements with the Broadcom leadership.

In 2003, Dell announced it would skip PCI-X 2.0 in favor of more rapid adoption of PCI Express solutions. As reported by PC Magazine, Intel began to sideline PCI-X in their 2004 roadmap, in favor of PCI Express, arguing that the latter had substantial advantages in terms of system latency and power consumption, more dramatically stated as avoiding &quot;the 1,000-pin apocalypse&quot; for their Tumwater chipset.

==Technical description==
PCI-X revised the conventional PCI standard by doubling the maximum clock speed (from 66 MHz to 133 MHz) and hence the amount of data exchanged between the computer processor and peripherals. Conventional PCI supports up to 64 bits at 66 MHz (though anything above 32 bits at 33 MHz is seen only in high-end systems). The theoretical maximum amount of data exchanged between the processor and peripherals with PCI-X is 1.06 GB/s, compared to 133 MB/s with standard PCI. PCI-X also improves the fault tolerance of PCI, allowing, for example, faulty cards to be reinitialized or taken offline.

PCI-X is backward compatible to PCI in the sense that the entire bus falls back to PCI if any card on the bus does not support PCI-X.

The two most fundamental changes are:
* The shortest time between a signal appearing on the PCI bus and a response to that signal occurring on the bus has been extended to 2 cycles, rather than 1. This allows much faster clock rates, but causes many protocol changes:
** The ability of the conventional PCI bus protocol to insert wait states on any cycle based on the IRDY# and TRDY# signals has been deleted; PCI-X only allows bursts to be interrupted at 128-byte boundaries.
** The initiator must deassert FRAME# &quot;two&quot; cycles before the end of the transaction.
** The initiator may not insert wait states. The target may, but only before any data is transferred, and wait states for writes are limited to multiples of 2 clock cycles.
** Likewise, the length of a burst is decided before it begins; it may not be halted on an arbitrary cycle using the FRAME# and STOP# signals.
** Subtractive decode DEVSEL# takes place two cycles after the &quot;slow DEVSEL#&quot; cycle rather than on the next cycle.
* After the address phase (and before any device has responded with DEVSEL#), there is an additional 1-cycle &quot;attribute phase&quot;, during which 36 additional bits (both AD and C/BE# lines are used) of information about the operation are transmitted. These include 16 bits of requester identification (PCI bus, device and function number), 12 bits of burst length, 5 bits of tag (for associating split transactions), and 3 bits of additional status.

==Versions==
Essentially all PCI-X cards or slots have a 64-bit implementation and vary as follows:
* Cards
** 66 MHz (added in Rev. 1.0)
** 100 MHz (works in 133 MHz slots by forcing a downclock of the bus to 100 MHz)
** 133 MHz (added in Rev. 1.0)
** 266 MHz (added in Rev. 2.0)
** 533 MHz (added in Rev. 2.0)
* Slots
** 66 MHz (speed as 66 MHz 64-bit PCI, can be found on older servers)
** 133 MHz (most common)
** 266 MHz (rare on x86, main bus on IBM pSeries from the era)
** 533 MHz (rare)

==Mixing of 32-bit and 64-bit PCI cards in different width slots==

Most 32-bit PCI cards will function properly in 64-bit PCI-X slots, but the bus speed will be limited to the clock frequency of the slowest card, an inherent limitation of PCI&#x27;s shared bus topology. For example, when a PCI 2.3 66-MHz card is installed into a PCI-X bus capable of 133 MHz, the entire bus backplane will be limited to 66 MHz. To get around this limitation, many motherboards have multiple PCI/PCI-X buses, with one bus intended for use with high-speed PCI-X peripherals, and the other bus intended for general-purpose peripherals.

Many 64-bit PCI-X cards are designed to work in 32-bit mode if inserted in shorter 32-bit connectors, with some loss of speed. An example of this is the Adaptec 29160 64-bit SCSI interface card. However some 64-bit PCI-X cards do not work in standard 32-bit PCI slots. Even if it would work, installing a 64-bit PCI-X card in a 32-bit slot will leave the 64-bit portion of the card edge connector not connected and overhanging, which requires that there be no motherboard components positioned so as to mechanically obstruct the overhanging portion of the card edge connector.

==Comparison with PCI-Express==

PCI-X should not be confused with the similar-sounding but incompatible PCI Express, commonly abbreviated as PCI-E or PCIe. While both are high-speed computer buses for internal peripherals, they differ in looks and technology. PCI-X is a 64-bit parallel interface, backward compatible with 32-bit PCI. PCIe is a serial point-to-point connection with a different physical interface that was designed to supersede both PCI and PCI-X.

PCI-X and standard PCI buses may run on a PCIe bridge, similar to the way ISA buses ran on standard PCI buses in some computers. PCIe also matches PCI-X and even PCI-X 2.0 in maximum bandwidth. PCIe 1.0 x1 offers 250 MB/s in each direction (lane), and up to 16 lanes (x16) are currently supported each direction, in full-duplex, giving for PCIe 1.0 a maximum of 4 GB/s bandwidth in each direction. PCI-X 2.0 offers (at its maximum 64-bit 533-MHz variant) a maximum bandwidth of 4,266 MB/s (≈4.3 GB/s), although only in half-duplex.

PCI-X has technological and economical disadvantages compared to PCI Express. The 64-bit parallel interface requires difficult trace routing, because, as with all parallel interfaces, the signals from the bus must arrive simultaneously or within a very short window, and noise from adjacent slots may cause interference. The serial interface of PCIe suffers fewer such problems and therefore does not require such complex and expensive designs. PCI-X buses, like standard PCI, are half-duplex bidirectional, whereas PCIe buses are full-duplex bidirectional. PCI-X buses run only as fast as the slowest device, whereas PCIe devices are able to independently negotiate the bus speed. Also, PCI-X slots are longer than PCIe 1x through PCIe 16x, which makes it impossible to make short cards for PCI-X. PCI-X slots take quite a bit of space on motherboards, which can be a problem for ATX and smaller form factors.

<doc id="873936" wikidata="Q574556" url="?curid=873936" title="Anti-Secession Law">
<text>The Anti-Secession Law () is a law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, passed by the 3rd Session of the 10th National People&#x27;s Congress. It was ratified on March 14, 2005, and went into effect immediately. President Hu Jintao promulgated the law with Presidential Decree No. 34. Although the law, at ten articles, is relatively short, Article 8 formalized the long-standing policy of the PRC to use military means against Taiwan independence in the event peaceful means become otherwise impossible. The law does not explicitly equate &quot;China&quot; with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (referred to in the law as &quot;the State&quot;).

== Background ==
Taiwan was formally incorporated into the Qing dynasty in 1683. After the First Sino-Japanese War, it was ceded by the Qing to the Empire of Japan in perpetuity in 1895. At the end of World War II, it was surrendered by Japan to the Kuomintang (KMT) administration of the Republic of China. After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Taiwan and some neighboring islands continued to be controlled by the Republic of China government. In 1952, the Treaty of Taipei nullified all treaties, conventions and agreements previously concluded between China and Japan before December 9, 1941. Currently, the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) government considers Taiwan to be a province of China. According to the PRC, it is the sole legitimate government of China, and the government of the Republic of China ceased to hold sovereignty over China when it lost control of the Chinese mainland following the Chinese Civil War. It argues that the PRC assumed sovereignty over the entirety of China in 1949–1950, including Taiwan, although the latter remained under the administration of the Republic of China government.

The official Republic of China (ROC) view is that it did not cease to exist in 1949 and has continued to function as a sovereign political entity in Taiwan to the present day, making the relationship between the PRC and ROC similar to that between other partitioned states (such as North Korea and South Korea). Official recognition by most international organizations (such at the United Nations and World Health Organization) rests largely with the PRC. In 1992, the &quot;One-China policy&quot; was agreed between the governments of both sides whereby each would assert that there was only &#x27;one China&#x27;, while disagreeing about which side was the legitimate government of it. However, some advocates of Taiwan independence oppose both the PRC&#x27;s and the ROC&#x27;s claim to Taiwan and the legality of the Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.

Multiple opinion polls conducted in Taiwan have indicated that there is very little support for immediate unification on the PRC&#x27;s terms or for an immediate declaration of independence. Polls have also consistently shown that a large majority of Taiwanese would support discussion of unification only if the economic and political systems of the two sides were comparable. A majority of Taiwan residents appear to support the &quot;status quo&quot; but there are different opinions in Taiwanese society, within the PRC, and within the international community, over what the status quo is. A full 74 percent of the Taiwanese public agree that &quot;Taiwan is an independent sovereign country&quot;

The re-election of Chen Shui-bian to the ROC Presidency, led many to conclude that there has been an increase in Taiwan independence sentiment and that a new Taiwanese identity is emerging on the island which is opposed to identification with China. During the 2004 ROC Legislative Election, the strategy of the pan-Green coalition was to try to capitalize on this trend to win a majority in the Legislative Yuan of Taiwan. Among some Taiwanese Independence supporters, it is believed that a pan-green majority could force a crucial referendum for constitutional reform and, perhaps, to further move the island toward de jure independence. Many Taiwanese independence supporters, including former President Lee Teng-Hui, argued that Taiwan should declare independence before 2008 on the theory that international pressure over the Beijing Olympics would prevent the PRC from using force against Taiwan.

These events in late 2004 caused a great deal of alarm in Beijing. Observers indicated that many in Beijing believed that its policies toward Taiwan had failed both because it did not have sufficient incentives to gain Taiwanese public support for unification and at the same time, it seemed that many in Taiwan did not take Beijing&#x27;s stated threats of force seriously. The ROC government had defined the status quo in such a way that a de jure declaration of independence could be argued to not represent a change in the status quo. Some Chinese believe these events led to the formulation in 2003 and 2004 of the Anti-Secession Law.

In early 2004 a similar proposed law had been tabled. Titled the National Unification Promotion Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (), it was authored by a Chinese academic Yu Yuanzhou (余元洲), a professor from Jianghan University in Wuhan who did not hold any formal governmental position, as a suggestion to create a formal legal basis for the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s unification with Taiwan. Although no formal legislative action was taken on the document, the heavy debate surrounding it, and the suggestion that some sort of anti-secession law would be passed, was viewed by many in Taiwan as evidence of hostile intent by the PRC government towards Taiwan independence supporters.

In the December 2004 ROC Legislative elections, although the ruling DPP party increased its share of votes in the legislature and remained the largest single party there, the pan-blue coalition gained a razor-thin majority, which surprised many. However, this result may have been less a reflection of popular sentiment than a testament to the effectiveness of the KMT&#x27;s more frugal nomination of candidates (116) compared with the DPP&#x27;s over-nomination of candidates (122) and the KMT&#x27;s rigid party rules for allotment of votes to its candidates within individual districts. This election result ended most prospects of an immediate declaration of independence and also called into question whether there really had been an increase in Taiwanese independence sentiment. Despite this, the PRC proceeded with the drafting of the anti-secession law. The main reasons given to foreign interlocutors were that the PRC leadership believed that its Taiwan policy in the past had been reactive rather than proactive and that it was necessary for the PRC to show initiative. Furthermore, Beijing expressed a residual distrust of Chen Shui-bian. Many foreign experts have argued that the PRC&#x27;s decision-making system was rigid and that plans put into place to deal with a pan-green victory had simply developed too much momentum to be shut down.

In announcing the drafting of the law in December 2004, the Head of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress () mentioned explicitly that the law was not intended to be applied to Hong Kong and Macau.

== Development ==
In December 2004, the PRC state news agency Xinhua reported that the National People&#x27;s Congress in its upcoming session would enact an &#x27;anti-secession law&#x27;, without specifying further details.

In a rare moment of agreement, politicians in Taiwan from both the Pan-green coalition and Pan-blue coalition reacted negatively towards this development. Some politicians have proposed that the ROC enact an &#x27;anti-annexation law&#x27; to counter the proposed PRC law. Various opinion polls have revealed that 80% of Taiwan residents oppose such an &#x27;anti-secession law&#x27; and a majority agree that a defensive referendum should be held in the advance of such a law to protect the status quo.

President Chen Shui-bian commented on the &#x27;anti-secession law&#x27; during his 2005 new year speech: &quot;Such actions will not only unilaterally change the status quo of peace in the Taiwan Strait, but will also pose the greatest threat to regional stability and world peace.&quot; Whereas the PRC Paramount leader Hu Jintao said &quot;We will definitely not allow anyone to separate Taiwan from China by any means,&quot; in his New Year&#x27;s Eve speech.

Although the PRC&#x27;s official English translation of the law is the &quot;Anti-Secession Law&quot;, the Mainland Affairs Council in Taiwan has consistently translated it as &quot;Anti-Separation Law&quot; as secession implies that Taiwan is a part of the PRC. The Mainland Affairs Council and the ROC government has argued that the relationship across the Taiwan Strait is not analogous to the situation during the American Civil War since Taiwan was never part of the PRC.

== Early reaction ==
===Reaction in Hong Kong===
At the time the unification law was proposed by legal scholar Yu Yuanzhou, the press in Hong Kong expressed concern that it would lead to legislation by stealth of the anti-treason or anti-secession provision of the Basic Law Article 23 legislation in 2003. These concerns were addressed when a mainland China official stated explicitly the law would not be added to Annex III of the Basic Law, which means that it would not be applicable to Hong Kong. After the passage of the law in March 2005, there was very little reaction in Hong Kong and news of the law was far overshadowed by the resignation of Hong Kong&#x27;s chief executive, Tung Chee-Hwa. In the 15 years since the law was passed, it has cast a long shadow over Hong Kong.

===Reaction in Taiwan===
In Taiwan, the passage of the law was condemned by officials and politicians from both the Pan-Green Coalition and the Pan-Blue Coalition, although there were differences in the content of their criticism. Supporters of the Pan-Green Coalition tended to react angrily to the spirit and content of the law as an infringement of what they saw as Taiwanese sovereignty. By contrast, supporters of the Pan-Blue Coalition, while stating that they opposed the law and the threat of force against Taiwan, called for more dialogue with the PRC and pointed to parts of the law in which Beijing showed hitherto unseen flexibility.

Opinion polls indicated widespread opposition to the law among the general public. Some questioned whether Beijing had the authority to enact such a law as they claim that Taiwan is not under the PRC jurisdiction (See Political status of Taiwan). The Pan-Green Coalition, in particular, reacted with distaste and there have been calls for an &quot;anti-annexation law&quot; to be passed by the legislature. Premier Frank Hsieh pointed out that the PRC law had already infringed on ROC sovereignty and thus met the criteria for initiating a &quot;defensive referendum&quot; under the ROC constitution. However, he added that whether a defensive referendum would be invoked is at the discretion of the ROC president.

On March 25, 2008, DPP legislators tabled a bill titled the &quot;Anti-Annexation Peace Law&quot; at the procedural committee level in the legislature, which would have stated that &quot;Taiwan and China are not subordinate to each other&quot;; that &quot;Taiwan is a sovereign state&quot;; and that &quot;the relationship between Taiwan and China is one between two states&quot;. It would have expressed hope that the Taiwan issue be resolved peacefully, but that if the status quo of the Taiwan Strait should change, the President would have the power to deal non-peacefully with &quot;China&#x27;s annexation&quot;. The bill was rejected at the procedural committee level by a vote of 11:2 and was not presented to the legislature.

===International responses===
United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice commented that the law was &quot;not necessary&quot;, while White House spokesman Scott McClellan called its adoption &quot;unfortunate&quot;, adding &quot;It does not serve the purpose of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait&quot;. In speaking about the law, the United States repeated that it remained supportive of the One China policy as the US defines it, that it did not support Taiwan independence, and opposed any unilateral action to change the status quo. The United States House of Representatives approved a resolution criticizing the PRC for the approval of the PRC law in Beijing. The resolution expressed grave concern about the law and said the PRC law provides a legal justification for PRC to use force against Taiwan, in its words, altering the status quo in the region.

In response to the enactment of the PRC law, the European Union issued a statement urging &quot;all sides to avoid any unilateral action that could stoke tensions,&quot; and recalled the &quot;constant principles that guide its policy, namely its commitment to the principle of one China and the peaceful resolution of dispute...and its opposition to any use of force.&quot; Later, on 14 April 2005, the European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report by Elmar Brok MEP, with paragraph 33 stating:
: [The European Parliament expresses] its deepest concern at the large number of missiles in southern China aimed across the Taiwan Straits and at the so-called &quot;anti-secession law&quot; of the People&#x27;s Republic of China that in an unjustified way aggravates the situation across the Straits; calls on the People&#x27;s Republic of China and on the R.O.C. in Taiwan to resume political talks on the basis of mutual understanding and recognition in order to promote stability, democracy, human rights and the rule of law in east Asia.
Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer stated that if war were to occur in the Taiwan Straits, Australia would be required under the ANZUS treaty to consult with the United States but depending on the situation that it would not necessarily commit Australia to war. He said that &quot;we don&#x27;t think that the PRC should resolve the Taiwan status question militarily, that it has got to be done through negotiations with Taiwan&quot;. Downer further commented that Australia would have preferred it had China not passed the anti-secession law.

<doc id="873938" wikidata="Q1207283" url="?curid=873938" title="British M-class submarine">
<text>The British Royal Navy M-class submarines were a small class of diesel-electric submarines built during World War I. The unique feature of the class design was a 12-inch (305 mm) gun mounted in a casemate forward of the conning tower.

Due to the limitations imposed on submarine armament by the Washington Naval Conference, &quot;M2&quot; and &quot;M3&quot; had their guns removed. &quot;M2&quot; was converted to carry a small seaplane and &quot;M3&quot; was made into a minelayer.

==Background==
They were ordered in place of the last four of the first group of steam-propelled K-class fleet submarines, &quot;K17&quot; - &quot;K21&quot;, the original orders being cancelled.

They were initially intended as coastal bombardment vessels, submarine monitors, but their role had been changed before detailed design begun. The intention was that merchant ships could be engaged at periscope depth or on the surface using the gun, rather than torpedoes. At that time torpedoes were considered ineffective against moving warships at more than 1,000 yards (900 m). A 12-inch gun fired at relatively short range would have a flat trajectory simplifying aiming, and few ships would be expected to survive a single hit.

==Design==
The guns were 12-inch (305 mm) 40 calibre Mark IX guns from spares for the &quot;Formidable&quot;-class battleships. The mounting allowed them to elevate by 20 degrees, depress 5 degrees and train 15 degrees in either direction from the centre line. The weapon was normally fired from periscope depth using a simple bead sight on the end of the gun aligned with the target through the periscope at a range of around . The exposure time of the gun above the surface was around 75 seconds. The submarine had to surface to reload the gun, which would take about three minutes. In practice the concept was not very successful and only three of the four M-class boats ordered were completed, all between 1917 and 1918. M-class submarines are sometimes called submarine monitors.

&quot;M1&quot; and &quot;M2&quot; also had four 18-inch (450-mm) torpedo tubes whilst &quot;M3&quot; and &quot;M4&quot; had 21-inch (533 mm) diameter tubes and were longer to accommodate them.

==Service==
&quot;M1&quot; was the only one to enter service before the end of World War I but did not see action. She was captained during her sea trials by experienced submariner Commander Max Horton after his return from the Baltic, and was later lost with all hands while on exercise in the English Channel near Start Point in Devon after a collision with a Swedish collier, SS &quot;Vidar&quot;, on 12 November 1925. The wreck of &quot;M1&quot; was discovered by a diving team led by Innes McCartney in 1999 at a depth of . Later that year the wreck was visited again by Richard Larn and a BBC TV documentary crew, and the resulting film was aired in March 2000.
&quot;M2&quot; was converted to a seaplane carrier in 1925, a hangar replacing the gun turret. She was lost off Chesil Beach, Dorset, on 26 January 1932. It is thought that the hangar door was opened prematurely. &quot;M2&quot; lies in shallow water, deep with the top of the conning tower only below the surface at low tide. She is a popular attraction for local scuba divers with as many as six boats anchored above her on busy days.

&quot;M3&quot; was converted to a minelayer in 1927 with stowage for 100 mines, primarily to test the mine-handling equipment of the &quot;Grampus&quot; class. The mines were carried on a conveyor belt which ran along her upper deck and was covered by an enlarged casing. The mines were laid through a door at the stern. She was scrapped in 1932 after the trials had been completed.

&quot;M4&quot; was broken up before completion.

In 1924 all three completed members of the class were used to test hull camouflage to reduce the visibility of submarines to aircraft; &quot;M1&quot; was painted grey-green, &quot;M2&quot; dark grey and &quot;M3&quot; was painted dark blue.

<text>The Soviet Air Defence Forces (, &quot;voyska protivovozdushnoy oborony&quot;, voyska PVO, V-PVO, lit. &quot;Anti-Air Defence Troops&quot;; and formerly &quot;protivovozdushnaya oborona strany&quot;, PVO strany, lit. &quot;Anti-Air Defence of the Country&quot;) was the air defence branch of the Soviet Armed Forces.

Formed in 1941, it continued being a service branch of the Russian Armed Forces after 1991 until it was merged into the Air Force in 1998. Unlike Western air defence forces, V-PVO was a branch of the military unto itself, separate from the Soviet Air Force (VVS) and Air Defence Troops of Ground Forces. During the Soviet period it was generally ranked third in importance of the Soviet services, behind the Strategic Rocket Forces and the Ground Forces.
==History==

===Service during Second World War===
Preparations for creation of the air defence forces started in 1932, and by the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, June 1941, there were 13 PVO zones within the military districts. At the outbreak of war, air defence forces were in the midst of rearmament. Anti-aircraft artillery teams had few of the latest 37 mm automatic and 85 mm guns. Moreover, the troops were deficient in Yak-1s and MiG-3s; 46 percent of the fleet were obsolete aircraft. Increased rates of production were initiated to provide the troops with new equipment. In July 1941, the National Defence Committee took several measures to strengthen the forces guarding Moscow and Leningrad, Yaroslavl and Gorky industrial areas, and strategic bridges across the Volga. To this end, the formation of parts of the IA, IN, anti-aircraft machine gun and searchlight units were accelerated.

A classic example of a major political organization of defence and industrial center was the defence of Moscow. It was carried out by the 1st Air Defence Corps and the 6th Fighter Aviation Corps PVO. As part of these formations at the beginning of German air raids had more than 600 fighters; more than 1,000 guns of small and medium calibers; 350 machine guns; 124 fixed anti-aircraft barrage balloons; 612 stations and 600 anti-aircraft searchlights. The presence of such large forces and their skilful management foiled enemy attempts to inflict massive air strikes. Only 2.6 percent of the total number of Axis aircraft flew in the outskirts of Moscow as a result of their efforts. Air defence forces defending Moscow destroyed 738 enemy aircraft. Assaults by the 6th Fighter Aviation Corps inflicted heavy blows, destroying 567 enemy aircraft on the ground. The Air Defence Forces destroyed 1,305 aircraft and in combat with the armies of Nazi Germany and its allies, alongside the Air Force, destroyed 450 tanks and 5,000 military vehicles.

On November 9, 1941, the post of the Commander of the Air Defence Forces was created and Major General Mikhail Gromadin (:ru:Громадин, Михаил Степанович) was appointed. In January 1942, to improve the interaction of forces and air defence systems, the fighter aircraft and crews manning them were ordered to be subordinated to the Air Defence Command. In April 1942, the Moscow Air Defence Front was founded, and the Leningrad and Baku Air Defence Armies were later raised. These were the first operational formations of the Air Defence Forces.

In June 1943, the Office of the Commander of Air Defence Forces of the country was disbanded. Following the reorganization in April 1944 that created the Western and Eastern Air Defence Fronts, and caused the division of the Transcaucasian Air Defence Area, which this year have been reorganized as the North, the South and the Transcaucasian Air Defence Fronts, air defence forces in the vicinity of Moscow were renamed the Moscow Air Defence Army. In the Far East in March 1945, three air defence armies were established: Maritime, Amur and Baikal.

During the Second World War, the Air Defence Forces provided defensive cover to defense industry complexes and vital communication elements, and successfully minimized aerial damage to Soviet industrial and transportation capacity. In the course of the war, the PVO destroyed 7,313 German aircraft, of which 4,168 and 3,145 were targeted by the IA antiaircraft artillery, machine guns and barrage balloons. More than 80,000 soldiers, sergeants, officers and generals of the Country Air Defence Forces were awarded state orders and medals, and 92 soldiers were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union and one was twice awarded the Gold Star Medal in service with the PVO.

During the war PVO formations were organised as Air Defence Fronts and Air Defence Armies. PVO Fronts normally covered airspace over several ground Army Fronts; these should not be confused with each other. The Air Defence Fronts () had the following service history:
* Western Air Defence Front
** 1st formation 29 June 1943 – 20 April 1944 renamed to Headquarters, Northern PVO Front
** Northern Front PVO 21 April 1944 – 23 December 1944 formed from Headquarters, Western PVO Front (1st formation); re-flagged as Headquarters, Western PVO Front (2nd formation)
** 2nd formation 24 December 1944 – 9 May 1945 formed from Headquarters, Northern PVO Front
* Moscow Front PVO 6 April 1942 – 10 July 1943 formed from Headquarters, Moscow PVO Corps Region; re-flagged as Headquarters, Special Moscow PVO Army
* Southern Front PVO 21 April 1944 – 24 December 1944 formed from Headquarters, Eastern PVO Front; re-flagged as Headquarters, Southwestern PVO Front
* Southwestern Front PVO 24 December 1944 – 9 May 1945 formed from Headquarters, Southern PVO Front

===Cold War===
All the possible air components were divided (as of 1945, before the 1949 reforms of the Soviet Armed Forces) into:
* Active army (, &quot;deystvuyuschaya armiya&quot;) – air forces assigned to fighting fronts, known as frontal aviation
* PVO Territorial Defence Forces (, &quot;voiska PVO territorii strany&quot;)
* PVO Territorial Armies (, &quot;armiya PVO territorii strany&quot;)
* Reserve forces of the Stavka High Command (, &quot;rezerv Stavki VGK&quot;)
* PVO of military districts (, &quot;PVO voennyh okrugov&quot;)
* PVO of inactive fronts (, &quot;PVO nedeystvuyuschih frontov&quot;)

The PVO Strany was separated from the other Soviet Armed Forces services in 1949. In June 1949, the 15th Guards Fighter Aviation Division and 180th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO, among its regiments, were transferred to the PVO Strany, becoming part of the 20th Fighter Air Defence Army at Oryol. There, the regiment became one of the first equipped with the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9, the first of a series of Mikoyan-and-Gurevich Design Bureau jet fighters. In April 1950, the regiment received its first Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s.

In May 1954, the PVO Strany was raised to a status equal to the other service branches of the Soviet Armed Forces, receiving its first commander-in-chief: Marshal of the Soviet Union Leonid Govorov.

The PVO&#x27;s principal role was to shoot down United States Strategic Air Command bombers if they penetrated Soviet airspace. Secondary target were U.S. air reconnaissance aircraft. There were a number of such aircraft shot down while operating around the Soviet borders, including MiG-17s downing a US reconnaissance Lockheed C-130 Hercules over Armenia, with 17 casualties in 1958. The PVO gained an important victory on May 1, 1960, when a S-75 Dvina missile downed Gary Powers&#x27;s U-2, causing the short U-2 crisis of 1960. (See Strategic Air Command#Strategic Reconnaissance)

The PVO had its own chain of command, schools, radar and sound director sites. 

On March 30, 1967, a Directorate of the Chief of Anti-Missile and Anti-Space Defence (&quot;Управление командующего войсками противоракетной и противокосмической&quot; (&quot;УКВ ПРО и ПКО&quot;)), under Lieutenant-General of Artillery Yuri Votintsev, was formed within the Air Defence Forces. In February 1971 the 1st Division for Warning Against Missile Attack (1st Division WAMA, &quot;1-я Дивизия предупреждения о ракетном нападении&quot; (&quot;1-я дПРН&quot;)) was formed with HQ in Solnechnegorsk, the 57th Separate Radiotechnical Nod in Olenegorsk, Murmansk Oblast and the 129th Separate Radiotechnical Nod in Skrunda, Latvian SSR.

Organisationally, there were two main PVO districts for most of the USSR&#x27;s postwar history, the Moscow Air Defence District (formed 1950) and Baku (formed 1954). The rest of the country was initially divided into PVO regions covering Belarus, Ukraine, the Baltics and Central Asia. However, in 1960 it appears that most of the PVO regions/areas were reorganised into seven separate armies of the Air Defence Forces – the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 14th, and 19th Air Defence Army. In 1963 the 30th independent Air Defence Corps in Tashkent became the 12th Independent Air Defence Army.

In 1977, the Air Forces and Air Defence Forces were re-organised in the Baltic states and the Leningrad Oblast (a trial run for the larger re-organisation in 1980 covering the whole country). All fighter units in the PVO were transferred to the VVS, the PVO only retaining the anti-aircraft missile units and radar units – the 6th Independent Air Defence Army was disbanded, and the 15th Air Army became the Air Forces of the Baltic Military District. By 1981, the now Voyska PVO had been stripped of many command and control and training assets, which were moved to the Air Force.

During the 1980s, the PVO interceptor units were re-equipped with the Mikoyan MiG-31 and Sukhoi Su-27P, while missile units received new electronic countermeasures systems and the S-300 surface-to-air missile system. The modernization of the PVO prioritized units in the High North and the Far East due to the threat from American spyplane missions and United States Pacific Fleet carrier aircraft.

Shelton lists a total of 140 officer commissioning schools, drawn from a &quot;Krasnaya Zvezda&quot; list of 17 January 1980. That total included 15 Air Defence Forces schools (four Fighter Aviation, five radio-electronics, and six Anti-Aircraft Rocket).

On 1 September 1983 the PVO shot down Korean Air Flight 007 after the civilian airliner had crossed into restricted Soviet airspace and was mistaken for a spy plane. Previously Korean Air Flight 902 had once crossed into Murmansk airspace, and had to make an emergency landing when a Soviet Air Force Su-15 fired on it. Soviet government officials finally admitted their mistake much to the anger of the South Korean and the United States governments. It even resulted in the forced and sudden resignation of the then Armed Forces Chief of the General Staff, Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov, in the following year by the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (leader of the Soviet Union) Konstantin Chernenko.

Mathias Rust&#x27;s flight to Moscow in May 1987 caused a massive shakeup within the PVO. It seems that after the KAL 007 shootdown of 1983, no one was willing to give an order to bring Rust&#x27;s tiny Cessna 172 down, and modernization programmes within the PVO had led to the installation of radar and communications systems at the state border that could not effectively pass tracking data to systems closer to Moscow. PVO Commander-in-Chief Marshal A. I. Koldunov was only among the first to be removed from his position. Over 150 officers, mostly from the PVO, were tried in court and removed from their posts. A large-scale changeover of senior officers of the force more generally followed as well.

===Under the Russian flag===

When the Soviet Union dissolved, the air fleet of the PVO included roughly 2,200 fighters and interceptors. The personnel and equipment of many units were left in newly independent republics, although the impact of the loss was reduced by the relocation of some units back to Russia. The Russian Air Defence Forces ultimately inherited about 65% of final Soviet PVO assets. 

In December 1994, the 4th Independent Air Defence Army at Ekaterinberg in the Urals was transformed into the 5th Independent Air Defence Corps, which in 1998 became the 5th Air and Air Defence Forces Army. In accordance with a December 1994 directive, the 14th Independent Air Defence Army was reorganized as the 6th Independent Air Defence Corps (:ru:6-й_отдельный_корпус_ПВО) with the 16th Guards, 20th, and 94th Mukden Air Defence Divisions). In 1998, the force groupings and headquarters of the PVO that had remained within Russia were merged with the Russian Air Force becoming part of the Moscow District of Air and Air Defence Forces, and the 4th, 5th, 6th, 11th, and 14th Armies of VVS and PVO.

The Day of Air Defence Forces (&quot;Den&#x27; Voysk PVO&quot;) was initially established in 1975, to be celebrated on April 11. In 1980 this was changed to the second Sunday of April. It is still celebrated in the Russian Federation even after the 1998 merger of the Air Defence Forces with the Air Force. The unofficial motto of the PVO is &#x27;Сами не летаем – другим не дадим&#x27;(&#x27;Sami ne letaem – drugim ne dadim&#x27;), which can be translated as &quot;Don&#x27;t fly – don&#x27;t let others&quot; / &quot;If we can&#x27;t fly – we won&#x27;t let anyone else either&quot;.

==Commanders-in-Chief, Air Defence Forces==
* Marshal of the Soviet Union Leonid Govorov – 1954–1955
* Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergey Biryuzov – 1955–1962
* Marshal of Aviation Vladimir Sudets – 1962–1966
* Marshal of the Soviet Union Pavel Batitsky – 1966–1978

The post was then disestablished with the merger of the PVO and VVS in 1998.

<doc id="873961" wikidata="Q263219" url="?curid=873961" title="Helen Shapiro">
<text>Helen Kate Shapiro (born 28 September 1946) is a British pop and jazz singer and actress. While still a teenager in the early 1960s, she was one of Britain&#x27;s most successful female singers. With a voice described by AllMusic as possessing &quot;the maturity and sensibilities of someone far beyond their teen years&quot;, Shapiro recorded two 1961 UK chart toppers, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know&quot; and &quot;Walkin&#x27; Back to Happiness&quot;, when she was just 14 years old.

Shapiro first achieved prominence in 1961 when her debut single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Treat Me Like a Child&quot;, reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. After the two million-sellers, her success continued in 1962 with further hits including &quot;Tell Me What He Said&quot; and film appearances in &quot;Play It Cool&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Trad, Dad!&quot; In 1963, Shapiro toured with the Beatles, who were her supporting act. Since the 1970s, she has branched out as a performer in musical theatre and jazz; she appeared in the West End and toured extensively with the British jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton and his band.

==Early life==
Shapiro was born at Bethnal Green Hospital in the East End district of Bethnal Green, London. Her early childhood was spent in a Clapton council flat in the London Borough of Hackney, where she attended Northwold Primary School and Clapton Park Comprehensive School until Christmas 1961. She is the granddaughter of Russian-Jewish immigrants; her parents, who were piece-workers in the garment industry, attended Lea Bridge Road Synagogue. The family moved from Clapton to the Victoria Park area of Hackney, on the Parkside Estate, when she was nine. &quot;It was, and remains, a beautiful place,&quot; she said in a 2006 interview.

Although too poor to own a record player, Shapiro&#x27;s parents encouraged music in their home (she had to borrow a neighbour&#x27;s player to hear her first single). Shapiro played banjolele as a child and occasionally sang with her brother Ron in the skiffle group of his youth club. She had a deep timbre to her voice, unusual in a girl not yet in her teens; school friends nicknamed her &quot;Foghorn&quot;.

At the age of 10, Shapiro was a singer with Susie and the Hula Hoops (together with her cousin, 1960s singer Susan Singer), a school band that included Marc Bolan (then using his real name of Mark Feld) as guitarist. At 13, she started singing lessons at the Maurice Burman School of Modern Pop Singing, based in London&#x27;s Baker Street, after the school produced singing star Alma Cogan. &quot;I had always wanted to be a singer. I had no desire to slavishly follow Alma&#x27;s style, but chose the school merely because of Alma&#x27;s success&quot;, she said in a 1962 interview. Burman&#x27;s connections included John Schroeder, a young songwriter man at EMI&#x27;s Columbia Records, who recorded a demonstration tape of Shapiro singing &quot;Birth of the Blues&quot;, and motivated by her singing, signed her to the label.

==Early career==
In February 1961, at 14, Shapiro released her first single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Treat Me Like a Child&quot;. The song was recorded at EMI Recording Studios, Abbey Road with a nine-piece band under the direction of Martin Slavin. After Helen&#x27;s appearance on the ITV music programme &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;, the record took off and reached number three in the UK Singles Chart in May 1961. According to AllMusic, Shapiro&#x27;s rich, mature voice made her &quot;an extraordinary new phenomenon on the British pop scene.&quot; Her next single, the ballad &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, topped the chart in August. The follow-up, &quot;Walkin&#x27; Back to Happiness&quot;, was written by John Schroeder and Mike Hawker and featured backing orchestrations by Norrie Paramor. The single quickly reached the top of the chart with far greater sales than her last in October 1961, by which time Shapiro had turned 15. She had initially been reluctant to record the song, as she considered it old-fashioned and corny. Both of Shapiro&#x27;s number-one singles sold over a million copies, earning her two gold discs. Her mature voice made her an overnight sensation, as well as the youngest female chart topper in the UK.

Shapiro&#x27;s next single release, &quot;Tell Me What He Said&quot;, peaked at number two, meaning each of her first four single releases made the top three of the UK Singles Chart. Her success led to film roles; she appeared as herself in the Billy Fury film &quot;Play It Cool&quot; and played the lead female role in Richard Lester&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Trad, Dad!&quot; Her final UK Top Ten hit single was with the ballad &quot;Little Miss Lonely&quot;, which peaked at number eight for two weeks in 1962. Before she was sixteen years old, Shapiro had been voted Britain&#x27;s &quot;Top Female Singer&quot;.

The Beatles&#x27; first national tour of Britain, in the late winter and early spring of 1963, was as one of her supporting acts. During the course of the tour, John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote the song &quot;Misery&quot; for her, but Shapiro&#x27;s producer, Norrie Paramor, turned it down, and she did not record the composition. In 1995, during an episode of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; highlighting her life and career, Shapiro revealed, &quot;It was actually turned down on my behalf before I ever heard it, actually. I never got to hear it or give an opinion. It&#x27;s a shame, really.&quot; Shapiro lip-synched her then-current single, &quot;Look Who It Is&quot;, on the British television programme &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; with three of the Beatles (John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison). In January 1964 she released her cover version of the song Fever, made famous by Peggy Lee in the late 1950s. Shapiro&#x27;s version, however, did not do as well as hoped, reaching only no.38, and was her last UK chart hit.

On 31 December 1969, Shapiro appeared in the BBC-ZDF co-production, &quot;Pop Go the Sixties&quot;, singing &quot;Walkin&#x27; Back to Happiness&quot;.

By the time she was in her late teens, Shapiro&#x27;s career as a pop singer was on the wane. With the new wave of beat music and newer female singers such as Dusty Springfield, Cilla Black, Sandie Shaw, and Lulu, Shapiro appeared old-fashioned and emblematic of the pre-Beatles era of the 1950s. As her pop career declined, Shapiro turned to cabaret appearances, touring the workingmen&#x27;s clubs of the north-east of England. Her final cabaret show took place at Peterlee&#x27;s Senate Club on 6 May 1972, where she announced she was giving up touring, as she was &quot;travel-weary&quot; and had had enough of &quot;living out of a suitcase&quot;. Later, after a change of mind, she branched out as a performer in musical theatre and jazz, one of her musical interests.

==Later career==
Shapiro played the role of Nancy in Lionel Bart&#x27;s musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; in London&#x27;s West End and appeared in a British television soap opera, &quot;Albion Market&quot;, where she played one of the main characters until it was taken off air in August 1986. Shapiro also played the part of Sally Bowles in &quot;Cabaret&quot; and starred in &quot;Seesaw&quot; to great critical acclaim.

Between 1984 and 2001, she toured extensively with British jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton and his band, whilst still performing her own jazz and pop concerts. Her one-woman show, &quot;Simply Shapiro&quot;, ran from 1999 to the end of 2002.

Her autobiography, published in 1993, is titled &quot;Walking Back to Happiness&quot;. She appeared in August 2012 as a guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Reunion&quot; in a programme about &quot;60s Girl Singers&quot;. In March 2013 she appeared on BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Sunday&quot;.

Since 2015, she has played in a trio called Hebron with Chrissy Rodgers and Simon Elman. They are promoted via Shapiro&#x27;s ministry umbrella, Manna Music.

==Personal life==
She married the theatre producer Duncan Weldon in 1967 and they divorced in 1971.

In 1982, Shapiro met John Judd (real name John Williams), an actor with numerous roles in British television and cinema. They were married on 31 August 1988. 

In 1987, she became a Messianic Jew. She temporarily retired from show business in 2002.

==Discography==
==In popular culture==
In the &quot;Rock Notes&quot; sketch on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot;, Eric Idle jokingly refers to &quot;Helen Shapiro&quot; as the last of many names with which a particular rock band reinvents itself after every break-up: &quot;That last name, their favourite, had to be dropped following an injunction, and they split up again.&quot;

<text>Vladimir Viktorovich Aksyonov (; 1 February 1935 – 9 April 2024) was a Russian-born Soviet cosmonaut who served as the flight engineer on Soyuz 22 and Soyuz T-2.

==Early life==

Aksyonov was born on 1 February 1935 in in the Kasimovsky District to a Russian family. He became orphaned in his youth, with his father Viktor Stepanovich Zhivoglyadov being killed in action in 1944 on the Eastern Front of World War II; his mother Aleksandra Ivanovna Aksyonova worked as an accountant before she died in 1949. He was then raised by his maternal grandparents, who were well educated. That year, he became a member of the Komsomol and graduated from a rural seven-year school where he received good grades before being admitted to the Asimov Industrial College. In 1950, his family decided to send him to Kaliningrad, Moscow Oblast, to live with his aunt. He went on to attend the Mytishchi Engineering College, which he graduated from in 1953. He then attended the 10th Military Aviation School for Primary Pilot Training in Kremenchuk, which he graduated from with honors in 1955, and then went to the Chuguev Military Aviation School of Pilots. However, he left the school in December 1956 due to being demobilized in the mass reduction of Soviet troops. The next year he began working for OKB-1, and in 1963 he graduated from the All-Union Correspondence Polytechnic Institute with a degree in mechanical engineering. Previously in 1959, he became a member of the Communist Party. Eventually he began working at the test department, led by Sergey Anokhin. A government decree on 15 June 1966 permitted civilians and former military personnel to be crew members on Soyuz flights. As a tester, Aksyonov flew over 250 flights on laboratory aircraft and worked in simulations of zero gravity. However, it was not until 1973 that be became a cosmonaut candidate.

==Cosmonaut career==

Having been admitted to the cosmonaut corps as a civilian cosmonaut in 1973, he initially trained for spaceflight in the 7K-S with Leonid Kizim, and helped train a group of fellow civilian flight engineers. In January 1976, he started training with Valery Bykovsky to operate the MKF-6 camera, which was made in East Germany. On 15 September 1976, he was launched into space for the first time, serving as a flight engineer on Soyuz 22, with Valery Bykovsky in command. They spent a week in orbit, taking photographs of various locations on Earth including parts of East Germany and the Soviet Union as well as photos of the Moon, totaling 2,400 photographs, and returned to earth on 23 September. The crew had some difficulty changing out the rolls of film in the MKF-6 camera, and their feedback was used in the design of the later MKF-6M version of the camera. The flight lasted 7 days 21 hours and 52 minutes. For his work on the flight he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 28 September.

After his flight on Soyuz 22 he remained with the cosmonaut program, and continued to train with the 7K-ST group until 1978, and from 1978 to 1980 he trained to serve as flight engineer on the Soyuz T. On 5 June 1980, he was launched into space as the flight engineer on the Soyuz T-2 with Yuri Malyshev in command to visit the Salyut 6 space station. Before docking with the station on 6 June, they oriented the Soyuz capsule towards the sun to do a test of new solar cells. While the Soyuz T-2 docking was supposed to be done automatically, due to a technical failure, Malyshev had to revert to manual control, but he managed to perform the approach and docking successfully on manual mode. The flight was a success, and they returned to Earth on 9 June, spending 3 days 22 hours and 19 minutes in space. For his success in the Soyuz T-2 flight he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union again on 16 June. In total he spent 11 days 20 hours and 11 minutes in space.

From 1983 to 1992, he was deputy chairman of the board of the .

==Later life==

After retiring from the cosmonaut program in 1988, he became director of the State Research Center for the Study of Natural Resources of the State Hydrometeorological Service. From 1990 to 1992 he worked as general direct of the NPO Planeta. In 1992, he became deputy chairman of the Executive Committee of the Cosmos Association. Meanwhile, from 1990 to 1996, he was deputy chairman of the board of directors of Mosbiznesbanka. In 1996, he became the chairman of the presidium of the public organization &quot;Spiritual Movement of Russia&quot;. In 2001, he became the president of the Institute for Security and Sustainable Development Science Foundation. Aksyonov lived in Moscow. He died on 9 April 2024, at the age of 89. He was buried with military honours in the Federal Military Memorial Cemetery on 11 April.

<doc id="873971" wikidata="Q1284998" url="?curid=873971" title="All About Eve (band)">
<text>All About Eve were an English rock band. The initial creative core consisted of Coventry-born Julianne Regan (vocals), Huddersfield-born Tim Bricheno (guitar) and Andy Cousin (bass guitar), with other members changing over the years. Their highest-charting UK single was &quot;Martha&#x27;s Harbour&quot; (1988). The band was active from 1984 to 1993, then 1999 to 2004, achieving four UK Top-50 albums. The band had been recognised for their &quot;unique, folk-rock-influenced take&quot; on the gothic rock style, and Regan has been described as &quot;certainly one of the more talented singers&quot; of the scene in the late 1980s.

==History==

===Foundation===
Julianne Regan, a former journalist, played bass in an early line-up of the gothic rock group Gene Loves Jezebel before leaving to form, with Manuela Zwingmann of Xmal Deutschland, The Swarm, the precursor to All About Eve. The band&#x27;s name was taken from the 1950 film starring Bette Davis. The original line-up of All About Eve consisted of Regan, Zwingmann, former Aemotti Crii guitarist Bricheno and bassist Gus Ferguson. The band released the independent single &quot;D for Desire&quot; in 1985, prior to Zwingmann and Ferguson leaving, the latter joining Test Department. Bricheno suggested Cousin as a replacement for Ferguson, and so as a three-piece (plus a drum machine), they released &quot;In the Clouds&quot; (1986) and &quot;Flowers in Our Hair&quot; (1987). Both singles, &quot;D for Desire&quot; and &quot;In the Clouds&quot;, were partially based on an ethereal gothic sound, sometimes compared to the music of the Cocteau Twins and Siouxsie and the Banshees.

After Regan sang backing vocals for The Mission&#x27;s &quot;God&#x27;s Own Medicine&quot; album, the band received greater attention and were signed to Phonogram. Drummer Mark Price was added around this time.

===Debut and chart success===
Their self-titled debut album was produced by Paul Samwell-Smith and released in 1988. It includes UK hit singles &quot;In the Clouds&quot;, &quot;Wild-Hearted Woman&quot;, &quot;Every Angel&quot;, &quot;Martha&#x27;s Harbour&quot;, and &quot;What Kind of Fool&quot;.

The album itself reached No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart, with much of its lyrical material drawing from hippie ideals, white magic and dreamlike fairy tales. Their music was sometimes considered gothic rock by the media.

The band later performed a dubbed version of &quot;Martha&#x27;s Harbour&quot; on the BBC television music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, but, owing to a studio technical error, the taped vocals were broadcast without the band being able to hear them, resulting in the audience of BBC1 hearing the recorded version of the song, while the band members sat motionless on screen waiting for their cue to begin. By way of compensation, the band were invited back on to the show to perform the song the following week, this time with the vocals performed live. This performance passed off smoothly, with the resultant publicity helping the track to climb the singles chart.

The following year, their second album, &quot;Scarlet and Other Stories&quot;, was released and the band toured around the UK. It also reached the top 10 of the UK Albums Chart.

===Activity through the 1990s===
In 1990, Bricheno left the group (later to join The Sisters of Mercy for their &quot;Vision Thing&quot; era, and subsequent bands XC-NN and Tin Star) to be replaced by The Church&#x27;s Marty Willson-Piper. They went on to record &quot;Touched by Jesus&quot; in 1991 (which featured David Gilmour of Pink Floyd on guitar on two tracks), which made the UK Top 20, before changing record labels and releasing &quot;Ultraviolet&quot;, the year after. Released by MCA it reached UK No. 46. The band continued working on new material, but Regan soon left. Although remaining members continued for a couple more months without Regan&#x27;s input, they disbanded in early 1993, with the album they had been working on being subsequently released under the group name Seeing Stars.

Regan went on to form Mice, and to work with Bernard Butler, and she teamed up with Jean-Marc Lederman in the Jules et Jim project.

In 1993, bassist Cousin went on to join a reformed Mission, touring extensively and contributing to their albums &quot;Neverland&quot; (1995) and &quot;Blue&quot; (1996) before the band again split.

In 1999, Hussey reformed the Mission yet again and although there was no room in the line-up for Cousin (bass duties being taken by the band&#x27;s original bassist, Craig Adams) Cousin was asked to approach Regan to invite her to reform All About Eve to open for them. The offer was accepted and the band reformed, with a line-up of Regan, Cousin, Willson-Piper, plus Ric Carter (who had been in the Mission with Cousin) on guitars/keyboards and Del Hood on drums. This line-up toured during 2000 and 2001, releasing a live album &quot;Live and Electric at the Union Chapel&quot;. In addition, Regan, Willson-Piper and Cousin toured as a pared down, mainly acoustic trio for two years, releasing live albums &quot;Fairy Light Nights&quot; in 2000, and &quot;Fairy Light Nights Volume 2&quot; in 2001.

In 2002, Willson-Piper left the band to pursue other projects, to be replaced by new guitarist Toni Haimi, previously of the band Malluka and currently a member of the Sohodolls. Later that year, All About Eve released the live album and DVD &quot;Cinemasonic&quot; with a line-up of Regan, Cousin, Haimi, Carter and Hood. A collection of early recordings was also released, entitled &quot;Return to Eden, Vol. 1: The Early Recordings&quot;.

Also in 2002, Regan and Cousin released their first studio recordings in a decade, with the EP &quot;Iceland&quot;; a collection of &#x27;winter songs&#x27;, including reworkings of &quot;December&quot; and cover versions of Wham!&#x27;s &quot;Last Christmas&quot;, Queen&#x27;s &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and &quot;Walking in the Air&quot;. (In the original &quot;December&quot; single, of 1989, there was a cover version of &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Promise&quot;, from Jethro Tull).

===Latter days===
Carter and Hood departed, with Ben Savigear taking over on drums. In mid-2004, shortly after the release of their first single in a decade, &quot;Let Me Go Home&quot;, the band split once again. Their last gig, with a line-up of Regan, Cousin, Haimi and Savigear, was at the Mean Fiddler in London on 30 April 2004, at the end of a British tour; this was filmed and copies of the performance were made available through a fan website.

Regan latterly worked with The Eden House, In April 2009, Regan stated on her Facebook page: &quot;All About Eve are dormant and may never happen again. I don&#x27;t ever like to say never though, but it seems we&#x27;ve all moved on and are exploring other avenues.&quot;

A double CD collection entitled &quot;Keepsakes&quot;, consisting of the singles, key album tracks and previously unreleased rarities, as well as some newly recorded songs, was released in early March 2006, and was initially available with a DVD of the promo videos and TV appearances.

=== 2019 ===
In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing on 20 July, Regan and Bricheno created a video and song called &quot;Pale Blue Earth&quot;. The pair released another song and video on 31 October 2019, called &quot;Seance&quot;.

=== 2023 ===
Julianne Regan and Tim Bricheno released a new two track single, featuring the traditional Christmas songs &quot;In The Bleak Midwinter&quot; and &quot;The Snows They Melt the Soonest&quot;.

=== 2024 ===
Regan &amp; Bricheno released a 10-track album &quot;Apparitions&quot; on 3 May via their Bandcamp channel.

Drummer Robin Guy died from cancer on 12 September 2024, at the age of 54.

<doc id="873975" wikidata="Q5345491" url="?curid=873975" title="Edward Sturgis Ingraham">
<text>Edward Sturgis Ingraham (April 8, 1852 – August 16, 1926) was the first superintendent of the Seattle Public Schools, a noted mountaineer who climbed to the summit of Mount Rainier 13 times, and a leader in the effort to establish Mount Rainier National Park. Seattle&#x27;s Ingraham High School is named in his honor, as is the Ingraham Glacier on Mount Rainier.
==Early life==
Ingraham was born in Albion, Maine. His parents, Samuel and Almira, were natives of the same state, their ancestors being numbered among the earliest settlers of New England. Samuel Ingraham was a master mariner, whose service was chiefly in packet ships which sailed from the Kennebec River and conducted a general passenger and freight business along the coast to the West Indies. E. S. Ingraham, when a boy, attended the public schools of Maine until his
fifteenth year, and then entered the Free Press office at Rockland and learned
the printer&#x27;s trade.

With an increasing fondness for a literary life and a higher education, he entered the Eastern Maine State Normal School, and graduated that institution in 1871. According to the laws of Maine relating to normal school graduates, Ingraham then began teaching in the public schools, and at the same time pursued a classical course of study through the Waterville Classical Institute, which he followed for three years until his eyes failed and he had to end his studies.

==Educational work in Seattle==
In August, 1875, he came to Seattle, where his half-brother, Andrew Ingraham (who emigrated west in 1849), then resided. Ten days after arriving, E. S. Ingraham was offered the position of principal of the central school and to assume charge of the schools of the city, which then numbered three buildings, six teachers and about 200 pupils. He continued as principal of
the dental school for thirteen years, and saw the number of teachers of the city schools increase to twenty-nine and the average attendance to 1,700 pupils. Ingraham was elected by the Republican party as Superintendent of King County Schools in 1876, and re-elected, in 1878 and 1880, serving six years continuously. In 1883, he was appointed Superintendent of Seattle Public Schools, and held the office five years.

After the admission of Washington to statehood, Ingraham was a member of the first State Board of Education, by appointment of Governor Elisha P. Ferry. He materially advanced the educational interests of Washington, was actively connected with state institute work, and was among the first to advocate county institutes by organizing one in King County.

== Mountaineering ==
Ingraham first climbed Mt. Rainier in summer, 1886, using an approach from the northeast, however his party failed to summit on that attempt. He made a second attempt from the northeast in 1887, but only reached the 13,800 foot elevation. In 1888, Ingraham joined the party accompanying John Muir to the summit of Mount Rainier. They reached the top of mountain on August 14, 1888. This expedition was notable in two aspects: it inspired Muir to write about Mt. Rainier for the wider public, and Arthur Churchill Warner, a photographer accompanying them, took the first photographs from the summit. Muir describes this climb in a chapter of his book &quot;Steep Trails&quot;.

In the summer of 1894, Ingraham led a large party from Seattle. This was the largest party to summit Mt. Rainier at the time, consisting of 14, including three women. On this ascent, using a aneroid barometer, he determined the elevation of the summit to be 15,500 feet, an inaccurate measurement as he failed to account for weather conditions. The party agreed to name the summit Columbia Crest.

On behalf of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, Ingraham led a party to investigate concerns of an eruption on Mt. Rainier in December, 1894 after numerous observers reported smoke from the crater. 

Ingraham led another successful ascent of Mt. Rainier in August, 1889.

In 1897, Ingraham joined the party of Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi in summitting Mount St. Elias in Alaska.

==Printing and politics==
In 1888 he retired from educational work and shortly thereafter entered into partnership with UK Coryell and established the printing house of Ingraham &amp; Coryell. They published the Northwest Journal of Education and the Seattle Guide, a monthly publication of general information connected with the city, besides conducting a general job-printing business. Ingraham was a member of the Board of Aldermen for the city of Seattle, serving one term, and in March, 1893, he was appointed by Governor John H. McGraw to the position of Regent of the State Agricultural College and School of Science for a term of four years.

== Later life ==
Ingraham was a member of the Home Guard militia during the Seattle riot of 1886. Ingraham served in the Washington National Guard for more than five years, retiring in April, 1897, as a lieutenant colonel, although he was generally called Major Ingraham by the public.

In 1898, Ingraham organized a party of 15 men to travel to Kotzebue, Alaska in search of gold on behalf of Prince Luigi. Three days into their voyage on the schooner &quot;Jane Gray&quot;, the ship foundered in inclement weather about 90 miles west of Cape Flattery. Most of Ingraham&#x27;s party died.

Ingraham&#x27;s obituary calls him the father of the Boy Scout movement in Washington and notes that he was an active Free Mason.

== Family ==
Ingraham was married in Seattle, in April, 1888, to Myra Ada Carr, a native of Oregon, whose parents were pioneers in the early 1860s. They had two sons, Norman and Kenneth Carr Ingraham.

<text>Shakespeare by the Sea is a professional theatre company and registered charitable society in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

==History==
Founded in 1994, Shakespeare by the Sea specializes in performing the works of William Shakespeare. Plays are performed outdoors in an amphitheatre formed by the ruins of the Cambridge Battery, an old military battery in Point Pleasant Park, and occasionally at other locations. The company is partially funded by government grants and private enterprise, with the main source of revenue coming from patrons&#x27; donations, which makes up about 70% of their revenues.

The Studio at Shakespeare by the Sea is their in-house theatre school, which offers training in Shakespeare and musical theatre performance.

The company was formed by the late Patrick Christopher-Carter (1945–2005), his lifelong partner Elizabeth Murphy, and Jean Morpurgo. It has played every year in the park, performing three to four productions every summer.

In 1999, a &quot;family&quot; show was added to the repertoire using a theme from a classical fairy tale or legend. The tale&#x27;s script is collectively created by the director and the cast and usually includes a musical element created by a composer. From 1999 to 2004, the family show was known for its lack of traditional props, with only colourful Styrofoam pool noodles being used to create all props and set pieces.

In the summer of 2005, the company went away from the Pool Noodle concept and transformed the family show into a musical, directed by Jesse MacLean, with music written by actor Jeremy Hutton and lyrics by Hutton, MacLean, William Foley, Kevin MacPherson, and Kate Smith titled &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. The show, with new music and lyrics by Hutton and Kieren MacMillan, then received two workshop productions at the Toronto Youth Theatre in 2007 and 2008, both directed by Hutton. Shakespeare By The Sea brought the show back to Point Pleasant Park for production in the summer of 2011, garnering significant popular and critical success. In January, 2013, Toronto&#x27;s Hart House Theatre presented a three-week run of the newest incarnation of the show, now entitled &quot;Robin Hood: The Legendary Musical Comedy&quot;. This production played to many sold-out houses, and was a darling of both audiences and critics.

In 2005, the Canada Day performance was &quot;The Midnight Twelfth Night&quot;, which began at midnight and concluded with the marriage of founders Patrick Christopher-Carter and Elizabeth Murphy. Following the sudden passing of Christopher-Carter later that year, in 2006 Elizabeth Murphy and Jennie Raymond formed a co-artistic directorship to steer the company through a transitional year. In 2007, Elizabeth Murphy took over as Artistic Director.

In some years a one-off peripatetic performance is staged, using various local, historic sites and batteries as dramatic settings for the play. To date, the company has performed Hamlet at the Prince of Wales Martello Tower twice, Richard III at the Sir Sandford Fleming Tower and at the Halifax Citadel, Henry V at the Halifax Citadel, King Lear at the Halifax Citadel, Julius Caesar in the historic courthouse on Spring Garden Road and Measure for Measure at the Prince of Wales Martello Tower.

Murphy led the drive to develop the rehearsal and office space that the company uses into The Park Place Theatre, an 82-seat black box venue, to be used in the event of poor weather during the summer. The theatre has allowed the company to expand its operations into the spring and fall with small-scale productions happening on an annual basis. The venue has also become a valued rehearsal and performance space for other small theatre companies based in Nova Scotia from September to May each year.

In 2012, longtime Artistic Associate Jesse MacLean joined Elizabeth Murphy as a Co-Artistic Director. Since 2003, MacLean has directed over two dozen productions for the company.

2013 marked the 20th season of professional theatre presentation by Shakespeare By The Sea. The company played to 13,000 over 68 performances in Point Pleasant Park, making it one of the most successful seasons in recent years.

In 2013, Shakespeare by the Sea was presented with the Theatre Nova Scotia Robert Merritt Legacy Award.

In 2019, Shakespeare by the Sea launched The Studio at Shakespeare by the Sea, a theatre school encompassing training programs in Shakespeare and Musical Theatre performance for young people. Jade Douris O&#x27;Hara joined the staff as the company&#x27;s first-ever Resident Artist, and as the Studio Director.

Drew Douris-O&#x27;Hara joined the staff as Artistic Associate (2019-2012), and later Associate Artistic Director (2021-present)

<doc id="873982" wikidata="Q784649" url="?curid=873982" title="Fables (comics)">
<text>Fables is an American comic book series created and written by Bill Willingham, published by DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo imprint. Willingham served as sole writer for its entirety, with Mark Buckingham penciling more than 110 issues. The series featured various other pencillers over the years, most notably Lan Medina and Steve Leialoha. &quot;Fables&quot; was launched in July 2002 and concluded in July 2015. It was revived in 2022 with a 12-issue continuation to the main series, as well as a 6-issue spin-off miniseries &quot;Batman vs. Bigby! A Wolf in Gotham&quot;, both published under DC Black Label.

The series features various characters from fairy tales and folklore – referring to themselves as &quot;Fables&quot; – who formed a clandestine community centuries ago within New York City known as Fabletown, after their Homelands were conquered by a mysterious and deadly enemy known as &quot;The Adversary&quot;. It is set in the modern day and follows several of Fabletown&#x27;s legal representatives, such as sheriff Bigby Wolf, deputy mayor Snow White, her sister Rose Red, Prince Charming, and Boy Blue, as they deal with troublesome Fables and try to solve conflicts in both Fabletown and &quot;the Farm&quot;, a hidden town in upstate New York for Fables unable to blend in with human society. The series also deals with such other matters as the main characters&#x27; personal lives, their attempts to hide the Fables&#x27; true nature from regular humans (or &quot;Mundies&quot;), and, later, the return of the Adversary.

&quot;Fables&quot; was a critical and commercial success, winning many Eisner Awards and receiving several Hugo Award nominations for Best Graphic Story. Its success led to several spin-offs and a 2013 prequel video game titled &quot;The Wolf Among Us&quot;.

==Publication history==

Various artists worked on the title. The covers until issue #81 were done by James Jean, after which João Ruas took over as cover artist. The majority of the interior pencil work was done by Mark Buckingham (who reportedly would have been given the writing reins if Willingham became unable to continue it). Other artists include Bryan Talbot, Lan Medina, P. Craig Russell, Mike Allred, Craig Hamilton, and Linda Medley.

The series ended with issue #150. The final issue of &quot;Fables&quot; was a larger than normal issue comprising most of the twenty-second &quot;Fables&quot; trade paperback. It was released in July 2015. It resumed publication with issue #151 for a 12-issue arc in May 2022.

Until 2023, Willingham was the sole owner of the IP rights to &quot;Fables&quot;. In September, Willingham announced that he had allowed the &quot;Fables&quot; IP to enter the public domain after growing disenchanted with DC Comics. Willingham cited his frustration with DC, stating that for years the company fought him on royalties, media rights, and various other issues. In his announcement, Willingham wrote: &quot;If I understand the law correctly...you have the rights to make your &quot;Fables&quot; movies, and cartoons, and publish your &quot;Fables&quot; books, and manufacture your &quot;Fables&quot; toys, and do anything you want with your property, because it&#x27;s your property&quot;. The decision does not affect any &quot;Fables&quot; works already in print, which Willingham will continue to collect royalties on. DC denied Willingham&#x27;s assertion that the franchise is public domain, stating that they continue to own the rights to the storylines, characters, and elements in the comics.

==Characters==

The main characters of &quot;Fables&quot; are public domain figures from folklore, mythology, and literature. Bill Willingham said the only considerations in deciding what characters and fables to use were &quot;is the character or story free for use?&quot; and &quot;do I want to use it?&quot; A principal character is the Big Bad Wolf (who calls himself &quot;Bigby&quot;), who has not only reformed but gained the ability to take on a more human appearance. At the series&#x27; beginning he serves as Fabletown&#x27;s sheriff.

Most of the characters who appear in &quot;Fables&quot; are from European stories, the major exceptions being Arabian fables and American fables (from the fable world of &quot;Americana&quot;, appearing in &quot;Jack of Fables&quot;, such as Paul Bunyan, Black Sambo [now known as Sam] and the Lone Ranger). Most of these characters appear primarily in the &quot;Jack of Fables&quot; spin-off.

The story&#x27;s been adapted for the comic by Lilah Sturges, who has previously written for the &quot;Fables&quot; series, and Dave Justus, staying otherwise true to the game&#x27;s story but exploring some characters and back story in more depth. The comic is canon to the &quot;Fables&quot; universe.

===Prose stories===
&quot;A Wolf in the Fold&quot;, featured in &quot;Legends in Exile&quot; trade paperback and in the &quot;Deluxe Edition: Volume 2&quot;, tells the history of Bigby Wolf and Snow White and how they came to the mundane world.
&quot;Pinocchio&#x27;s Army&quot;, featured in &quot;Fables: Rose Red&quot;, focuses on Pinocchio and Geppetto during the events of the &quot;Rose Red&quot; story arc.

Prominent review site IGN has called it &quot;the best comic book currently being produced&quot; in 2006.

==Adaptations==
===Convention===
Fabletown and Beyond was a comic convention created and hosted by Willingham to showcase and appreciate comic books that fall under the genre of mythic fiction. Willingham announced this new project during his panel at the 2012 San Diego Comic Convention: &quot;We&#x27;re going to have a nearly-all &quot;Fables&quot; dedicated con called &#x27;Fabletown and Beyond&#x27; – it&#x27;s &quot;Fables&quot; and books like &quot;Fables&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Fables&quot; artist Mark Buckingham was the guest of honor for the first FablesCon, held on March 22–24, 2013, at the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester, Minnesota. Other guests included Gene Ha, Mike Carey, Matt Sturges, Peter Gross, Kurt Busiek, Anthony Del Col, Shelly Bond, Adam Hughes, Chrissie Zullo, and Lauren Beukes.

===Television series===
A television series based on &quot;Fables&quot; was put into development by NBC in 2005 for the 2006–07 television season. The show received a script order and was developed by Craig Silverstein and Warner Bros. Television but was not developed any further than the scripting stage. NBC later produced &quot;Grimm&quot;, a police procedural set in a world where fairytales are real.

In December 2008, ABC picked up the rights to develop a pilot of &quot;Fables&quot; for the 2009–10 television season. &quot;Six Degrees&quot; creators and executive producers Stu Zicherman and Raven Metzner were writing the script for the hourlong drama, again set up at Warner Bros. Television, while David Semel had come on board to direct. There has been no news since concerning a series based directly on Willingham&#x27;s series and, in late 2010, he said &quot;[t]he TV show that was prematurely announced is probably dead&quot;. Instead, ABC developed a new series called &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, which features fairy tale characters such as Snow White and Prince Charming who have been cursed to live in the real world by the Evil Queen without the memories of their former lives. The show&#x27;s creators, Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, stated that they &quot;read a couple issues&quot; of &quot;Fables&quot; but believe that while the two concepts are &quot;in the same playground&quot;, they are &quot;telling a different story&quot;.

===Film===
In 2015, Warner Bros. was developing a live-action &quot;Fables&quot; film with David Heyman and Jeffrey Clifford producing, Jeremy Slater and Jane Goldman writing and Nikolaj Arcel directing, but these plans were quietly cancelled.

===Video game===
Telltale Games developed &quot;The Wolf Among Us&quot;, an episodic graphic adventure game based upon &quot;Fables&quot;. With the first of its five episodes released on October 11, 2013 (and the final episode released on July 8, 2014), the game is canon with the comic book universe and is set as a prequel to the comic book.

&quot;The Wolf Among Us 2&quot; was set for release in 2024, the final release being currently unknown. It is a sequel to the 2013 game &quot;The Wolf Among Us&quot;, with the title taking place six months following the events of the previous title.

The popular Blue Tea Games series &quot;Dark Parables&quot; was inspired by &quot;Fables&quot;.

<text>The heat wave of 1995 derecho series are a series of derechos that occurred from Tuesday, July 11 through Saturday, July 15, 1995, primarily impacting areas from Montana to the US Midwest, and the Great Lakes Region.

== Synopsis ==

A tremendously hot and humid air mass over the Great Plains contributed to the development of four powerful derechos. These particular derechos occurred during the Heat Wave of 1995. The derechos developed along the northern rim of the air mass on a stationary front.

* The first derecho (shown in green) started in Montana during the evening of July 11 and dissipated over northern Michigan and northern Wisconsin during the morning hours on July 12.
* The second, and the longest lived, of the derecho series (shown in orange) started in Montana on July 12 following the same path as the first and moved into northern Michigan on the morning of the 13th. It moved south and hit eastern Michigan and southwestern Ontario before dissipating over southern Ohio and extreme northern West Virginia at around midnight on July 14.
* The third (shown in purple) began developing in southwestern central South Dakota in the late evening hours of July 13. It moved northeast through Minnesota on the 14th. For some residents of northern Minnesota, this is the third day in a row they have been hit by a derecho.
* The fourth and final derecho of this series (shown in red), started over upper Michigan on the evening of July 14 and moved east through southern and eastern Ontario, continuing east through western and eastern New York State in the early morning hours on the 15th. Wind damage was particularly heavy in the Adirondack Mountains region of upstate New York. The derecho moved into the waters of the Atlantic Ocean in the mid-afternoon hours that same day where it dissipated quickly.

==The &quot;Right Turn Derecho&quot; of July 12 and 13==

This derecho raced through eight states in 24 hours: Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania and West Virginia as well as one Canadian province, Ontario. This was termed a &#x27;right turn&#x27; derecho because its initial eastward progression moved sharply to a south-southeast direction, having developed from a band of thunderstorms in Montana. Hector International Airport in Fargo, North Dakota recorded a 91 mph wind gust. This was the second day of three that Minnesota suffered hits from derecho winds—five million trees were blown down and buildings were damaged or destroyed, and six campers were injured by falling trees in the early morning hours.

The derecho moved south and southeast during the afternoon hours and blew more trees down. Three people were killed and several injuries occurred in eastern Michigan. In Roscommon County, 100,000 trees and 100 miles of power lines were blown down. In Detroit, 400,000 people lost power. It was the biggest power loss for the city since the July 7, 1991 derecho event. The power loss only added to what might have been a very uncomfortable situation. As previously mentioned, Detroit was in a massive heat wave. Luckily, the heat was mitigated by cooling from rain.

The derecho wreaked havoc in southwestern Ontario, hundreds of trees fell and damage was caused to buildings. When the derecho crossed Lake Erie, the storm capsized many boats and one man was killed.

The derecho moved into Ohio and felled thousands of more trees. Three more people were killed and several more were injured. The derecho finally dissipated near the Ohio River at midnight on July 14.

Amazingly, this was not the only major heat wave of July 1995. At the end of the month and the beginning of August, another major heat wave spread across the country. An example of this was the 128 degrees Fahrenheit temperature registered on July 28 in Indio, California.

==The Ontario-Adirondacks Derecho of July 14 and 15==

The Ontario-Adirondacks Derecho got its start near the straits of Mackinac on Friday evening July 14, 1995. At the Mackinac Bridge connecting the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan, 100 mph winds were detected and sustained winds above 80 mph continued on the bridge for 10 additional minutes. After crossing the open waters of Lake Huron/Georgian Bay, the storm raced southeastward into central southern Ontario. Several brief tornadoes were reported. An F1 tornado struck the Balsam Lake Trailer Park near Kirkfield, flipping over vehicles, destroying several trailers and sending ten people to hospital with non life-threatening injuries. One trailer was thrown over 250 meters. Across the lake from the trailer park, straightline winds caused extensive damage in the cottage community of Long Point. Further east, near Peterborough, an F2 tornado hit Bridgenorth damaging or destroying 20 homes and a marina with winds estimated upward of 200 km/h (120 mp/h). To get an idea of the straight line wind damage over a wide area, a sustained wind gust of 136 km/h (84 mp/h) was recorded just north of Toronto at the Buttonville Airport, which was located on the far southern periphery of the main derecho.

Many thousands of trees were blown down across the province severing power lines, blocking roadways, and damaging homes. One person was killed, and dozens of people were injured. Eight people trapped in a flipped houseboat in Pigeon Lake near Peterborough were rescued hours after the storm. Power was not restored to some affected areas for up to a week after the event. The derecho caused CAN$53 million in damage.

The storm entered New York state at around 4 A.M. The storm slammed into the Adirondacks felling 900,000 acres (3,600 km2) of forest. The value of the loss of timber was estimated at over $200 million (1995 dollars) ($306M in 2014 dollars)

The derecho passed through the Syracuse airport with a 76 mph wind gust. A parked Boeing 727 was blown into another plane. A 77 mph wind gust was recorded at Albany. It moved into New England a little after sunrise producing 70-90 mph wind gusts in several towns in Massachusetts. Fifty people were left homeless after the derecho blew the roof off an apartment building in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Three people were injured in Deerfield, Massachusetts when a hot air balloon got caught into the winds of the derecho gust front and blew into a tree.

During the July 15, 1995 derecho, over 600 lightning strikes were observed in a 10-minute period during the storms peak intensity. 600 lightning strikes in 10 minutes translates into 60 strikes a minute or one strike every second. A Lightning Detection System (LDS) displayed flash rates of 3000 strokes per hour. Satellite photography depicted expanding cloud tops to 75,000 feet.

The Ontario-Adirondacks Derecho was the strongest of the derecho events of the previous days and is among the costliest thunderstorms in US/Canadian history. It caused $500 millions in damage. Altogether, the four derecho events caused nearly $1 billion in damage.

<text>Milton Slocum Latham (May 23, 1827 – March 4, 1882) was an American politician, who served as the sixth governor of California and as a U.S. representative and U.S. senator. Latham holds the distinction of having the shortest governorship in California history, lasting for five days between January 9 and January 14, 1860. A Lecompton Democrat, Latham resigned from office (the second governor to do so) after being elected by the state legislature to a seat in the U.S. Senate.

==Biography==
Born in Columbus, Ohio in 1827, Latham was educated in classical studies at Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1845. Following his graduation, Latham moved to Russell County, Alabama, working briefly as a school teacher while studying law. He was admitted to the Alabama State Bar in 1848, working as Russell County&#x27;s circuit court clerk for two years until 1850, when he relocated to San Francisco, California following the Gold Rush.

In San Francisco, Latham continued in law, becoming a recording clerk for the county, and in 1851, the district attorney of Sacramento. After serving for one year, Latham entered politics, and in 1852, ran as a Democrat and won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. After the completion of his two-year term, Latham declined to run for another term and returned to California to again practice law, despite being renominated by state Democrats.

Only a year after returning to San Francisco, Latham was appointed U.S. Customs Collector for the Port of San Francisco by President Franklin Pierce, a post the former congressman protested initially, but reluctantly later accepted. Latham held the post until 1857.

Since the beginning of the 1850s, issues regarding slavery had effectively split the national Democratic Party. California was controlled by the states-rights Chivalry wing, who had defeated Tammany Hall in the state. Nationally, by 1857, the party had split into the Lecompton and Anti-Lecompton factions. Lecompton members supported the Kansas Lecompton Constitution, a document explicitly allowing slavery into the territory, while Anti-Lecompton faction members were in opposition to slavery&#x27;s expansion. The violence between supporting and opposition forces led to the period known as Bleeding Kansas. Splits in the Democratic Party, as well as the power vacuum created by the collapse of the Whig Party, helped facilitate the rise of the American Party both in state and federal politics. In particular, state voters voted Know-Nothings into the California State Legislature, and elected J. Neely Johnson as governor in the 1855 general elections.

During the 1859 general elections, Lecompton Democrats voted Latham, who had briefly lived in the American South, as their nominee for governor. Anti-Lecomptons in turn selected John Currey as their nominee. The infant Republican Party, running in its first gubernatorial election, selected businessman Leland Stanford as its nominee. To make matters more complicated, during the campaign, Senator David C. Broderick, an Anti-Lecompton Democrat, was killed in a duel by slavery supporter and former state Supreme Court Justice David Terry on September 13.

Despite the party split and Republican entrance to the campaign, Latham won the election, garnering sixty percent of the vote.

==Governor==

Latham was inaugurated on January 9, 1860. In his inauguration speech, the new governor outlined his main priority as solving the state&#x27;s creeping debt, an issue that previously challenged former governors John Bigler, J. Neely Johnson and John Weller. Latham suggested curtailing legislative expenses, erecting more governmental buildings—such as completing the new State Capitol building—without raising taxes, and increasing U.S. Mail links from the Eastern United States to California to help facilitate commerce and personal links. Latham also suggested that the Office of the governor should not be made more powerful, and be securely checked by the legislature and courts.

However, only hours into his term, Latham&#x27;s desire for political advancement was quickly known. Within days, Latham had proposed to the Assembly and Senate that he be elected to finish the term of the late U.S. Senator David C. Broderick, who had been killed in a duel the previous September. (Prior to the Seventeenth Amendment, state legislatures selected U.S. senators.) Henry P. Haun had been appointed to fill the vacancy on an interim basis and ran for the remainder of the term, but Latham was chosen by the legislature, and on January 14, 1860, just five days into his governorship, Latham resigned. He was the second California Governor to resign from office.

Latham&#x27;s five-day tenure as governor remains the shortest in California history. His record for the shortest tenure of any California constitutional officer held until Republican Sean Wallentine served three days – December 31, 2010 to January 3, 2011 – as an acting member of the California State Board of Equalization.

==Post governorship==

Latham traveled to Washington, D.C. to take his U.S. Senate seat later that year. Serving for the next three years as a Democrat, he ran for reelection once Broderick&#x27;s original term expired in 1863. However, political support in California had turned away from the Democrats in favor of Unionist Republicans, who now controlled the State Legislature. Latham lost his bid for a second Senate term to Republican John Conness, himself a former Anti-Lecompton Democrat.

Following his defeat, Latham traveled to Europe, joining the London and San Francisco Bank Ltd (now MUFG Union Bank), where he became the bank&#x27;s San Francisco chief. Throughout the late 1860s and into the 1870s, Latham helped finance the California Pacific and the North Pacific Coast Railroad, earning recognition as one of California&#x27;s rail barons.

In 1872, Latham bought and began renovating a 50-room Menlo Park mansion, Thurlow Lodge, as a gift to his bride, only for the estate to burn down before completion. Nevertheless, it was entirely rebuilt in 1873. In 1874, Latham commissioned Carleton Watkins to photograph the huge estate and produce two presentation albums of mammoth plate prints.

Latham moved to New York City in 1879 to become president of the New York Mining Stock Exchange. The former governor died in New York three years later in 1882 at 54. He was originally buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery in San Francisco (now the site of the Lone Mountain campus of the University of San Francisco), and re-interred at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in nearby Colma in 1940.

<text>The Treaty of London () or the Pact of London () was a secret agreement concluded on 26 April 1915 by the United Kingdom, France, and Russia on the one part, and Italy on the other, in order to entice the latter to enter World War I on the side of the Triple Entente. The agreement involved promises of Italian territorial expansion against Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and in Africa where it was promised enlargement of its colonies. The Entente countries hoped to force the Central Powers – particularly Germany and Austria-Hungary – to divert some of their forces away from existing battlefields. The Entente also hoped that Romania and Bulgaria would be encouraged to join them after Italy did the same.

In May 1915, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary but waited a year before declaring war on Germany – leading France and the UK to resent the delay. At the Paris Peace Conference after the war, the United States of America applied pressure to void the treaty as contrary to the principle of self-determination. A new agreement produced at the conference reduced the territorial gains promised by the treaty: Italy received Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and the Julian March in addition to the occupation of the city of Vlorë and the Dodecanese Islands. Italy was compelled to settle its eastern border with the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes through the bilateral Treaty of Rapallo. Italy thus received Istria and the city of Zadar as an enclave in Dalmatia, along with several islands along the eastern Adriatic Sea shore. The Entente went back on its promises to provide Italy with expanded colonies and a part of Asia Minor.

The results of the Paris Peace Conference transformed wartime national fervour in Italy into nationalistic resentment championed by Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio by declaring that the outcome of Italy&#x27;s war was a mutilated victory. He led a successful march of veterans and disgruntled soldiers to capture the port of Rijeka – claimed by Italy and denied by the Entente powers. The move became known as the &quot;Impresa di Fiume&quot;, and D&#x27;Annunzio proclaimed the short-lived Italian Regency of Carnaro in the city – before being forced out by the Italian military so that the Free State of Fiume could be established instead. The Regency of Carnaro was significant in the development of Italian fascism.

==Background==
Soon after the outbreak of World War I, the Triple Entente powers – the United Kingdom, France, and Russia – sought to attract more allies to their side. The first attempt to bring in Italy (a part of the Triple Alliance) as an ally of the Entente was in August–September 1914. The matter became closely related to contemporary efforts to obtain an alliance with Bulgaria, or at least secure its neutrality, in return for territorial gains against Entente-allied Serbia. As compensation, Serbia was promised territories which were parts of Austria-Hungary at the time – specifically Bosnia and Herzegovina and an outlet to the Adriatic Sea in Dalmatia.

==Negotiations==
===First offers===

The August–September 1914 negotiations between the Entente and Italy were conducted on Russian initiative. On 4 August, only a day after Italy , its ambassador to Russia said that Italy might join the Entente in return for Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Vlorë, and a dominant position in the Adriatic. Believing that such a move by Italy would prompt Romania to join the Entente as well against Austria-Hungary, Russian foreign minister Sergey Sazonov pursued the matter. British Foreign Minister Edward Grey supported the idea; he said that Trieste should be added to the claim as potentially important to win over Italian public opinion on joining the war.

The Italian ambassador to the United Kingdom, Guglielmo Imperiali, presented Grey with Italy&#x27;s conditions, but Grey did not consider the talks could produce any practical results. He told Imperiali that Britain would not consider the matter any further until Italy committed itself to joining the Entente. On Grey&#x27;s instructions, Rennell Rodd, British ambassador to Italy, asked Italian Prime Minister Antonio Salandra if Italy could enter the war. Salandra informed Rodd that this was impossible at the time and that any premature attempt to abandon neutrality would jeopardise any prospect of a future alliance. Sazonov was informed accordingly, and Russia abandoned the matter.

The motives for the Entente&#x27;s overture to Italy and Italian consideration of entering the war were entirely opportunistic. The Entente saw Germany as the principal enemy and wanted to force it to divert some of its forces away from the existing battlefields. Italy had basically different interests from the Entente powers. It saw opportunities to fulfil Italian irredentist objectives in Austria-Hungary, to gain a dominant position in the Adriatic basin and to expand its colonial empire. Initially, the majority of the Italian public favoured neutrality, but groups favouring an expansionist war against Austria-Hungary formed in every part of the political spectrum. The most ardent supporters of war became irredentist groups such as &quot;Trento e Trieste&quot; (Trento and Trieste) led by Giovanni Giuriati or Alfredo Rocco who saw the war as an opportunity for ethnic struggle against neighbouring South Slavic populations.

===Occupation of Vlorë===

Salandra and his foreign minister Antonino Paternò Castello did not break off the negotiations completely. They used the subsequent months to wait for a chance to increase Italian demands to the maximum at an opportune time. There was an attempt to relaunch the negotiations in London on 16 September when Castello told Rodd that British and Italian shared interests in preventing westward spread of Slavic domains under Russian influence – specifically by preventing Slavic influence in the Adriatic, where irredentists claimed Dalmatia. While Castello instructed Imperiali to tell the British that Italy would not decide to abandon its neutrality before the Entente accepted their conditions, Grey insisted on Italy first committing to joining the Entente and the talks collapsed again.

Particular opposition to the Italian claim against Dalmatia came from the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Arthur Nicolson who remarked that Sazonov was right to claim that Dalmatia wished to unite with Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. He added that if Dalmatia were annexed by Italy, it would inherit a problem from Austria-Hungary – that of having a large South Slavic population looking for greater independence.

Nonetheless, Castello managed to obtain British endorsement for Italian occupation of Vlorë. The move was made as a preparation for Italian intervention and designed to lend some prestige to the Italian government. Expecting opposition from Sazonov, Castello asked Grey to get the Russians to let him have this without making any concessions in return as a necessary evil to attract Italy to join the Entente.

===Sonnino replaces Castello===

In late October, there was an attempt to get Italy to intervene against an expected Turkish attack against the Suez Canal. Sazonov warned Grey not to offer Dalmatia in exchange and the latter replied that no such offer was made as the canal remaining open was in Italian interests too.

The matter of an Italian alliance was taken up by Castello&#x27;s successor Sidney Sonnino and Rodd in November. Sonnino proposed a non-binding agreement which could be turned into a binding one at an opportune time. Even though similar proposals by his predecessor were turned down, Rodd was informed through his contacts in the Italian government that the Italian Armed Forces were prepared to intervene by February 1915 – prompting Rodd to urge Grey to consider the proposal. However, Grey declined the idea as a hypothetical bargain as he appeared indifferent to an Italian alliance at this point.

Following this, Salandra and Sonnino conducted negotiations with the Central Powers in an apparent attempt to keep the Central Powers at bay until further negotiations were possible with the Entente. These talks collapsed on 15 February 1915. The following day, Sonnino sent Imperiali a specific list of conditions set out in sixteen points necessary for Italy to enter the war.

===Seeking Bulgarian alliance===
While the Entente Powers were negotiating with Italy, they led a concurrent diplomatic effort aimed at obtaining Bulgarian alliance (or at least friendly neutrality). This situation led to a conflict of territorial claims staked by Italy and Serbia. Namely, awarding Italy Dalmatia would largely block the Adriatic outlet offered to Serbia (in addition to Bosnia and Herzegovina) as compensation to Serbia&#x27;s cession of much of Vardar Macedonia to Bulgaria requested by the Entente as enticement to Bulgaria. Sazonov wanted to strengthen his offer to Serbia and indirectly to Bulgaria by guaranteeing such an outlet to Serbia, but Grey blocked the initiative – arguing that an Italian alliance was more important.

In mid-February, following the start of the Gallipoli campaign, the British were convinced that Bulgaria would enter the war on the side of the Entente within weeks, certain of its victory. Even though it worked to bring Bulgaria on board, Russia was anxious that Bulgarian and Greek forces might occupy Constantinople to push Russia out of the region despite being promised control of the city by the Entente. Sonnino saw the combined Bulgarian and Greek entry into the war likely to assure Entente victory in the Balkans. On 4 March, Imperiali informed Grey that Italy would enter the war and presented him with the 16 conditions insisting on curtailing Slavic westward advance.

===Russian claim over Constantinople===

Grey noted that the Italian claims were excessive, but also that they did not conflict with British interests. He also thought that recent Russian stubborn objections against Greek attack to capture Constantinople could be overcome by addition of Italian troops, and that Italian participation in the war would expedite a decision from Bulgaria and Romania – still waiting to commit to the war.

Sazonov objected to any Italian role regarding Constantinople – seeing it as a threat to Russian control of the city promised by the allies in return for Russian losses in the war. This led Grey to obtain formal recognition of the Russian claim to the city by the Committee of Imperial Defence and by France – leading Sazonov to acquiesce to an agreement with Italy, except he would not consent to Italy taking the Adriatic coast south of the city of Split and as long as the Italian troops did not participate in the capture of the Turkish Straits.

The request concerning the Turkish Straits was found acceptable by Grey since the British never anticipated Italy would take part in the campaign against Constantinople. The bulk of the Italian claim, concerning acquisition of Trentino, Trieste, and Istria was likely to attract protests against handing predominantly Slav-populated territories to Italy from Frano Supilo – a dominant figure in the nascent Yugoslav Committee advocating interests of South Slavs living in Austria-Hungary. On the other hand, the Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pašić and Sazonov found it acceptable. Even though Serbian Niš Declaration of war objectives called for the struggle to liberate and unify &quot;unliberated brothers&quot;, referring to &quot;three tribes of one people&quot; meaning the Serbs, the Croats, and the Slovenes, as means to attract support from South Slavs living in Austria-Hungary, Pašić was primarily concerned with achieving a Greater Serbia. Sazonov acquiesced, adding that he has nothing to say on behalf of the Croats and the Slovenes and would not approve Russian forces to fight &quot;half a day&quot; for liberty of the Slovenes.

===Final six weeks of talks===

Nonetheless, negotiations extended for six weeks over disagreements as the extent of Italian territorial gains in Dalmatia was still objected to by Sazonov. The Italian claim of Dalmatia to the Neretva River, including the Pelješac Peninsula and all Adriatic islands was not based on self-determination, but on security concerns in a future war – as the Italian negotiators alleged that Russia might occupy the Austrian-controlled coast while Italy had no defensible port on the western shore of the Adriatic. The Committee of Imperial Defence was concerned about rising Russian naval power in the Mediterranean and it is possible, although there is no direct evidence, that this influenced the British support for the Italian claims in the Adriatic – as means to deny it to Russia.

Hoping to achieve the diplomatic breakthrough in securing alliances with Bulgaria, Romania, and Greece, Grey turned Sonnino&#x27;s 16 points into a draft agreement and forwarded it to Russia against protests by the Yugoslav Committee. Sazonov objected to the draft agreement and dismissed an Italian offer of Dubrovnik as a port for South Slavs as it lacked inland transport routes. Sazonov demanded Split in addition as a better port and objected to the requested demilitarisation of the coast belonging to the Kingdom of Montenegro. Grey drew up a document taking into consideration the Russian objections and forwarded it to Imperiali, but Sonnino threatened to end the negotiations over the differences.

The deadlock was broken by French Foreign Minister Théophile Delcassé who was ready to pay any price to obtain an alliance with Italy believing it would bring about alliances with Bulgaria, Greece, and Romania as well. Delcassé proposed a reduction in the Italian claim in Dalmatia to favour Serbia in exchange for unrestricted possession of the Dodecanese Islands. The initiative succeeded because the Russian Imperial Army lost initiative in the Carpathians and its commander in chief, Grand Duke Nicholas, informed Sazonov that Italian and Romanian support would be needed urgently to regain the initiative. In response, Sazonov accepted the proposal put forward by Delcassé, insisting that Italy enter the war by the end of April and leaving all treaty-related demilitarisation matters to the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith to decide. Asquith produced a draft agreement on 9 April and it was accepted by Sonnino with minor amendments five days later. The agreement was signed on 26 April by Grey and ambassadors Paul Cambon, Imperiali, and Alexander von Benckendorff, behalf of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Russia.

==Terms==

Article 1 of the treaty determined that a military agreement shall be concluded to guarantee the number of troops committed by Russia against Austria-Hungary to prevent it from concentrating all its forces against Italy. Article 2 required Italy to enter the war against all enemies of the United Kingdom, Russia, and France, and Article 3 obliged the French and British navies from supporting the Italian war effort by destroying Austro-Hungarian fleet.

Article 4 of the treaty determined that Italy shall receive Trentino, and the South Tyrol by defining a new Italian–Austrian frontier line between the Piz Umbrail and Toblach, and a new eastern Italian frontier running from Tarvisio in the north to the coast in the Kvarner Gulf leaving Rijeka just outside the Italian territory.

Article 5 awarded Dalmatia to Italy – specifically the part north of a line running northeast from Cape Planka – including cities of Zadar and Šibenik, as well as the basin of the Krka River and its tributaries in the Italian territory. The article also awarded Italy all Austro-Hungarian Adriatic islands except Brač, Šolta, Čiovo, Drvenik Mali, Drvenik Veli, Krk, Rab, Prvić, Sveti Grgur, Goli Otok, Jakljan, and Koločep. The article specified that the remaining coast between Rijeka and the Drin River is awarded to Croatia, Serbia, and Montenegro.

Furthermore, Article 5 required demilitarisation of the coast between the Cape Planka and the Aoös River with exception of the strip between Pelješac and a point southeast of Dubrovnik and in Montenegrin territory where military bases were allowed through prewar arrangements. The demilitarisation was meant to assure Italy of military dominance in the region. The coast between the point 10 kilometres southeast of Dubrovnik and the Drin River was to be divided between Serbia and Montenegro. Articles 4 and 5 thus added to Italy&#x27;s population 200,000 speakers of German, and 600,000 South Slavs.

Articles 6 and 7 gave Italy full sovereignty over Vlorë, the Sazan Island, and surrounding territory necessary for defence – requiring it to leave a strip of land west of the Lake Ohrid to allow a border between Serbia and Greece. Italy was to represent Albania in foreign relations, but it was also required to acquiesce to its partition between Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece if the United Kingdom, France, and Russia decided so. Article 8 gave Italy full sovereignty over the Dodecanese Islands.

Provisions detailing territorial gains beyond Europe were comparably vaguely written. Article 9 promised Italy territory in the area of Antalya in a potential Partition of the Ottoman Empire, while Article 10 gave it rights belonging to the Sultan in Libya under the Treaty of Ouchy. Article 13 promised Italy compensation if the French or British colonial empires made territorial gains against the German colonial empire in Africa. In Article 12, Italy upheld the Entente powers in support of future control of Mecca and Medina by an independent Muslim state.

Articles 11 and 14 promised a share in any war indemnity and a loan to Italy in the amount of 50 million pounds sterling respectively. Article 15 promised Entente support to Italian opposition to inclusion of the Holy See in any settlement of questions raised by the war, and Article 16 stipulated that the treaty was to be kept secret.

==Aftermath==
===Response===

Even though the treaty was meant to be secret, an outline of its provisions became known to the Yugoslav Committee and its supporters in London in late April 1915. Serbia and the Yugoslav Committee protested it in strong terms in Entente capitals. Pašić condemned the disregard for the self-determination principle on which the Niš Declaration rested and the lack of consultations with Serbia. He demanded the Entente refrain from treaties with Hungary or Romania on borders of interest to Croatia without conferring with Serbia first, as well as requesting assurances of future political union of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. Pašić telegraphed his proposal to Grey from the provisional wartime capital of Niš through British ambassador Charles Louis des Graz. However, Grey declined both requests. The Yugoslav Committee president Ante Trumbić met with Lord Crewe, a senior member of the British Cabinet, demanding support for unification of Croatia, Istria, and Dalmatia and then for a political union with Serbia. News of the treaty also compelled the Yugoslav Committee to adopt a less critical view of Serbian demands concerning the method of political unification of the South Slavs as it became clear that the unity of the Croats and the unity of the Slovenes would depend on success of Serbia. Full text of the treaty text was published by the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution. In 1917, Pašić and Trumbić negotiated and agreed upon the Corfu Declaration setting out a plan for post-war unification of South Slavs to counter the Italian territorial claims outlined in the Treaty of London.

Grey&#x27;s policy and the treaty were criticised in British press. An early example of such critique was &quot;The National Union of South Slavs and the Adriatic Question&quot; written by Arthur Evans and published in April 1915. Evans described the treaty as a manifestation of Italian chauvinistic ambitions against Dalmatia causing a crisis. Evans expanded on his criticism in article &quot;Italy and Dalmatia&quot; published by &quot;The Times&quot; on 27 April. Evans was joined by historians Robert Seton-Watson and Wickham Steed by describing the Italian claims as absurd and Grey&#x27;s policies as unjust. Grey responded by reiterating that in the event of victory in the war, Serbia would receive territories from Austria-Hungary allowing its enlargement.

===Further course of the war===
In the final weeks before entering the war, internal struggle took place in Italy. National fervour was whipped up by speeches of Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio – calling for war as a measure of national worth and inciting violence against neutralists and the former Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti who favoured neutrality. This period became known as the &quot;radiant days&quot;.

On 22 May 1915, the Italian government decided to launch the Alpine Front by declaring war against Austria-Hungary alone. This ignored the requirement set out in Article 2 to wage war against all the Central Powers. France accused Italy of violating the Treaty of London, and Russia speculated on the potential existence of a non-aggression agreement between Italy and Germany. Lack of preparation of the army was cited as the decision for the non-compliance with the treaty. Failure to declare war on other Central Powers, especially Germany, led to isolation of Italy among the Entente powers. Following pressure from the Entente and internal political struggle, war was declared on the Ottoman Empire on 20 August. Italy did not declare war on Germany until 27 August 1916. Italy was nearly militarily defeated by the Central Powers in 1917, at the Battle of Caporetto. Following a major retreat, the Italian forces managed to recover and mount a comeback a year later in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto at the cost of 600,000 dead, social unrest in the country and a badly damaged economy. Under the provisions of the Armistice of Villa Giusti, Italy was allowed to occupy Austro-Hungarian territory promised to her under the Treaty of London – parts of which were also claimed by the diplomatically unrecognised State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Italian troops began to move into those areas on 3 November 1918, entered Rijeka on 17 November and were stopped before Ljubljana by city-organised defence including a battalion of Serbian prisoners of war.

The entry of Italy into the war did not entice Bulgaria to join the Entente as it became more cautious regarding further developments after early British and French setbacks at Gallipoli. Following the German capture of Kaunas in Lithuania in late June during the Russian retreat, Bulgaria became convinced the Entente would lose the war. In August, the Entente powers sent a note to Pašić, promising territorial gains in exchange for territorial concessions in Vardar Macedonia to Bulgaria. The note promised Bosnia and Herzegovina, Syrmia, Bačka, the Adriatic Coast from Cape Planka to the point 10 kilometres southeast from Dubrovnik, Dalmatian islands not assigned to Italy, and Slavonia if it was captured by the Entente militarily. On Sonnino&#x27;s request, Pašić was not offered Central Croatia. Pašić agreed, offering to cede to Bulgaria a part of Vardar Macedonia largely along the lines agreed in 1912 at the end of the First Balkan War but asked for further territorial gains – by addition of Central Croatia and Banat. The Slovene Lands not promised to Italy appeared to be meant to remain in Austria-Hungary. On 6 October, Bulgaria joined the Central Powers and attacked Serbia five days later.

===Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne===

Partition of the Ottoman Empire was discussed by the Entente powers at two conferences in London in January and February 1917, and in Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne in April 1917. While it was apparent that the Italian interests were clashing with the British and the French, Italian representatives insisted on fulfilment of the promise given under the 1915 Treaty of London in the region of Antalya. To reinforce proportionality of Italian gains to those of their allies, the Italians added Konya and Adana vilayets to the claim. Most of the Italian demands were accepted in the Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne. The French required that the Russia confirm the agreement though – which proved impossible following the Russian Revolution.

===Paris Peace Conference===
Provisions of the Treaty of London were a major point of dispute between Italy and the remaining Entente powers at the Paris Peace Conference. The chief Italian representatives, Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando and Sonnino demanded enforcement of the Treaty of London relying on application of the security principle, and annexation of Rijeka on the basis of self-determination. The British and the French would not publicly endorse any claims exceeding those afforded by the treaty while privately holding Italy deserved little because of its reserved attitude towards Germany in early stages of the war.

The French and the British let the President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, hold Italian ambitions in check in the Adriatic by advocating self-determination of the area in accordance with point nine of his Fourteen Points. Wilson deemed the Treaty of London a symbol of perfidy of European diplomacy. He held the treaty invalid by application of the legal doctrine of clausula rebus sic stantibus on account of fundamental changes of circumstances following the breakup of Austria-Hungary. While the British and the French representatives remained passive on the issue, Wilson published a manifesto explaining his principles and appealing for sense of justice among Italians on 24 April 1919. Orlando and Sonnino left Paris in protest and were celebrated in Italy as champions of national honour. Even after their return on 7 May, they refused to take any initiative expecting a conciliatory offer from the Allies. In absence of the Italian delegation, the French and the British decided to annul the Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne for lack of Russian consent and not to honour any Italian claims in Asia Minor or Africa.

Orlando and Sonnino held different positions regarding the eastern Adriatic shore claims. Orlando was prepared to give up on Dalmatia except Zadar and Šibenik while insisting on annexing Rijeka. Sonnino held the opposite view. This led to adoption of a widely publicised slogan of &quot;Pact of London plus Fiume&quot; – and demanding the London Treaty promises and Rijeka becoming the matter of Italian national honour. Ultimately, Italian gains on the eastern Adriatic shore were limited to the Julian March, Istria, and several islands. Rijeka was assigned the status of an independent city – following negotiations between Orlando and Trumbić. Italian gains included corrections of the Treaty of London borders around Tarvisio to give Italy a direct rail link with Austria. In Dalmatia, the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George only supported a free-city status for Zadar and Šibenik, while French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau only supported such a status for Zadar. In the secret Venizelos–Tittoni agreement, Italy renounced its claims over the Dodecanese Islands except for Rhodes in favour of Greece while the two countries agreed to support each other&#x27;s claims in partition of Albania.

===Mutilated victory===

Orlando&#x27;s and Sonnino&#x27;s inability to secure all the territory promised by the Treaty of London or the city of Rijeka produced a sense that Italy was losing the peace. Patriotic fervour gave way to nationalistic grievance and the government was seen as incapable of defending national interests. Orlando&#x27;s successor as Prime Minister, Francesco Saverio Nitti, decided to pull out occupying Italian troops from Rijeka and hand the city over to the inter-Allied military command. That prompted D&#x27;Annunzio to lead a force consisting of veterans and rebelling soldiers (with the support of regular troops deployed in the border area) in what became known as the &quot;Impresa di Fiume&quot; to the successful capture of Rijeka. D&#x27;Annunzio declared the Italian Regency of Carnaro in the city; its system of government influenced the development of Fascism. It became a model for an alternative parliamentary order sought by the Fascists.

The &quot;Impresa di Fiume&quot; brought about the fall of the Nitti government under pressure from the Italian Socialist Party, D&#x27;Annunzio, and Benito Mussolini. Nitti&#x27;s successor Giolitti and &quot;democratic renouncers&quot; of Dalmatian heritage were next criticised by the nationalists. D&#x27;Annunzio formulated the charge in the slogan &quot;Victory of ours, you shall not be mutilated&quot;, referencing the promise of Dalmatia given in the Treaty of London, failure to annex the &quot;utterly Italian&quot; city of Rijeka, and elusive Adriatic domination as rendering Italian participation in the war meaningless. His position thus gave rise to the myth of the mutilated victory.

Following the , in what is termed the 1920 Vlora War, Albanian forces forced out the Italian garrison deployed to Vlorë; the latter retained Sazan Island. On 22 July, Italy renounced the Venizelos–Tittoni agreement and guaranteed Albanian independence within its 1913 borders instead. Italy directly contacted the newly established Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes for a compromise on their borders on the eastern Adriatic shores. The border was settled by the Treaty of Rapallo, conceding a little of the hoped for northern gains (within today&#x27;s largely Slovene Littoral (also called Austrian Littoral, coast or Julian March)) but gaining Istria and the city-enclave of Zadar and several islands. Giolitti had the Italian Navy drive D&#x27;Annunzio from Rijeka, and the city became the Free State of Fiume under provisions of the Treaty of Rapallo. It comprised settlement of the border awarding Italy territory on the Snežnik Plateau north of Rijeka and a strip of land between the city and Italian-controlled Istria. The Treaty of Rapallo nonetheless added 350,000 Slovenes and Croats to the population of Italy.

<text>Henry Huntly Haight (May 20, 1825 – September 2, 1878) was an American lawyer and politician. He was the tenth governor of California from December 5, 1867, to December 8, 1871.

==Early life==

===Childhood and education===
Haight was of English and Scottish parentage. The son of Fletcher Mathews Haight and Elizabeth Stewart (MacLachlan), Henry H. Haight was born in Rochester, New York. He was the second of twelve children and the third generation of lawyers. He traced his ancestors to Cameron of Lochiel and to Jonathan Teal Haight of England.

Growing up, Haight was fond of poetry. He attended the Rochester Collegiate Institute before entering Yale in 1840 at 15. Haight graduated with honors from Yale University in 1844.

He married Anna Bissell (1834-1898) on January 24, 1855, in St. Louis. Bissell was born in Missouri, the daughter of Capt. Lewis Bissell and Mary (Woodbridge) of Connecticut. The couple had at least one son, Dr. Louis Montrose Haight (1868-1942).

==Political career==
===Early politics===
Haight later joined his father in St. Louis, Missouri where he studied and later practiced law. While in St. Louis, the younger Haight became politically active and edited a &quot;Free Soil&quot; publication. Upon discovery of gold in California in 1848, he decided to head further west.

In 1856, Haight supported John C. Fremont&#x27;s campaign for president. By 1859, Haight became chair of the state Republican Party. He led Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s campaign in California, although in 1861, he told a friend he regretted supporting Lincoln.

In 1863, shortly after President Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation, Haight announced he had joined the Democratic Party. He campaigned against Lincoln in 1864, and was involved in a small controversy for allegedly disrespecting the President.

===Gubernatorial election of 1867===

Haight never held public office of any kind before he was elected Governor of California. In 1867, California Democrats nominated Haight for governor. Earlier at their convention, the Democratic Party adopted an anti-Reconstruction platform, particularly against &quot;indiscriminate suffrage.&quot; Upon his nomination, Haight expanded on the party&#x27;s platform. 
At his July 9 speech at San Francisco&#x27;s Union Hall, Haight denounced Reconstruction and its potential impact in California. He claimed Congress&#x27;s policies put white Americans &quot;under the heel of negroes&quot; and warned that indiscriminate suffrage would allow Chinese to vote in California. Haight deemed Chinese people unworthy of voting as they would be manipulated by their railroad employers. As &quot;pagans,&quot; &quot;serfs&quot; and members of a &quot;servile, effeminate and inferior race,&quot; their suffrage rights would &quot;pollute and desecrate&quot; the democratic &quot;heritage&quot; of white Americans. Haight called for increased immigration from Europe to prevent Asian migration. &quot;But if we are powerless to prevent the swarming of millions of Asia from pouring in upon us, we can at least keep in our hands the government of the country.&quot;

In September 1867, white Californians elected Haight in a landslide. Haight, with 9,000 votes more than George Gorham, carried the entire Democratic ticket into office.

==Governorship==

===Civil rights===
On December 5, 1867, newly elected Governor Haight took to a stage in Sacramento to give his inaugural address. Haight spent the majority of his speech condemning Congress&#x27; Reconstruction policy. He claimed Reconstruction was extreme and destroyed White Southerners&#x27; liberties. &quot;Reconstruction,&quot; Haight proclaimed, &quot;... takes from White people of 10 states their constitutional rights, and leaves them subject to military rule; and disenfranchises enough White men to give political control to a mass of Negroes just emancipated and just as ignorant of political duties as beasts of the field.&quot;


As Governor, Haight then used the powers of his office to prevent citizenship and voting rights from being extended to non-White California residents. Shortly after taking office, Haight wrote privately to President Andrew Johnson to thank him for his stance against Congress&#x27;s Reconstruction policy. The 14th Amendment had been waiting on Gov. Haight&#x27;s desk when he took office. Haight never transmitted to the state legislature the Constitutional Amendment to extend citizenship to all.

The U.S. Congress sent the 15th Amendment to states for ratification in late 1869, the January 1870 debates renewed opposition to non-White suffrage. Transmitting the amendment to California&#x27;s legislature, Haight warned, &quot;If this amendment is adopted, the most degraded Digger Indian within our borders becomes at once an elector, and so far, a ruler. His vote would count for as much as that of the most intelligent White man in the State.&quot; The Democratic majority followed Haight&#x27;s lead and rejected the 15th Amendment in January 1870.

===Legislation===
Haight was the first governor to use the offices in the California State Capitol in Sacramento. Haight has received credit for signing legislation to create the University of California (UC) and ending subsidies to railroads. On March 23, 1868, he signed the &quot;Organic Act&quot;, the legislation creating the University of California, although he had not been involved in its formation. Haight appointed primarily Democrats to the board of regents, and none of the university&#x27;s predecessors. A friend credited Haight with ending state subsidies for the railroads during his term as governor.

===Reelection===
In 1871, Haight lost his bid for reelection to Newton Booth. Haight returned to his Alameda estate and his law practice.

==Alameda==
After he was governor, he returned to his estate in Alameda, California. 
Haight later served on the City of Alameda&#x27;s Board of Trustees, including time as its first president. He also served on the UC Board of Regents. He was also selected for a state Constitutional Convention, but died in 1878.

Haight died on September 2, 1878, in San Francisco. He is buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California.

==Legacy==
Haight is remembered with his portrait at the State Capitol and the Alameda Museum, as well as a public school and public street in Alameda named after him.

In 1892, Alameda named Haight Ave after H.H. Haight.

Though it is commonly thought to be true, Haight Street in San Francisco may or may not have been named after Haight himself; it is thought by some that the street was named after his uncle, the pioneer and exchange banker Henry Haight (1820–1869).

===Rename Haight campaign===
Henry Haight Elementary School in Alameda, California, is named after the former governor. On the 150th anniversary of Haight&#x27;s inauguration speech, Rasheed Shabazz, a local journalist and activist wrote the school&#x27;s PTA and asked them to create a petition to rename Haight. On December 12, 2017, Shabazz, addressed the AUSD School Board and asked them to consider renaming Haight Elementary due to white supremacist statements of Haight, citing Haight&#x27;s inaugural address as governor. AUSD Superintendent Sean McPhetridge &quot;...called on the school board to direct AUSD staff to create a School Renaming Committee&quot; at that meeting. Parents of the school gathered signatures asking the school&#x27;s principal to form a School Renaming Committee. AUSD proceeded to announce the formation of the Renaming Committee in February 2018.

The Coalition to Rename Haight created a website including primary and secondary sources, and a syllabus, about the life and times of Henry H. Haight.

On April 23, 2019, the Alameda Board of Education voted to rename &quot;Haight Elementary School&quot; to &quot;Love Elementary School.&quot;

<doc id="874009" wikidata="Q1744672" url="?curid=874009" title="Classical dressage">
<text>Classical dressage evolved from cavalry movements and training for the battlefield, and has since developed into the competitive dressage seen today. Classical riding is the art of riding in harmony with, rather than against, the horse.
Correct classical riding only occurs when the rider has a good seat and a correct and well-balanced body position, moves with the horse&#x27;s motion, and applies and times the aids correctly.

==Natural abilities of the horse==
The origins of classical dressage and collection lie in the natural ability of the horse and its movements in the wild. In fact, most modern definitions of dressage state that the goal is to have the horse perform under saddle with the degree of athleticism and grace that it naturally shows when free.

Horses naturally use collection when playing, fighting, competing and courting with each other. When trying to impress other horses, they make themselves look bigger, just as other animals do. They achieve this by lifting the forehand, raising the neck and making it bigger by flexing the poll, while at the same time transforming their gaits to emphasize more upwards movement. When fighting, the horse will collect because in collection he can produce lightning speed reactions for kicking, rearing, spinning, striking with the front feet, bucking and jumping.

This natural ability to collect is visible in every horse of any breed, and probably inspired early trainers to reproduce that kind of behavior in more controlled circumstances. This origin also points out why, according to most Classical dressage trainers, every healthy horse, regardless of its breed, can perform classical dressage movements, including the Haute Ecole jumps, or &quot;Airs above the ground,&quot; even though it may perform them a little differently from the ideal performance due to the build of its body.

The ultimate goal of dressage training is to develop a horse to its ability as an athlete: maximum performance with a minimum of effort. The training scale (as set for in the German riding instruction) is to physically develop the horse in a consistent manner with longevity in mind. Dressage is fitness training and needs to be treated as such, with thought, compassion and patience.

==History==

The Western World&#x27;s earliest complete surviving work on many of the principles of classical dressage is Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;On Horsemanship&quot;. Xenophon emphasized training the horse through kindness and reward.

In the 15th century, brute force training fell out of favour, while artistry in riding came to the fore. Along with these developments came an increase in indoor riding. The Renaissance gave rise to a new and more enlightened approach to riding, as a part of the general cultivation of the classical arts. By the Victorian age, indoor riding had become a sophisticated art, with both rider and horse spending many years perfecting their form. Gueriniere, Eisenberg, Ruy d&#x27;Andrade and Marialva wrote treatises on technique and theory during these periods.

The horses were trained to perform a number of airs above the ground (or &quot;sauts d&#x27;école&quot;) movements, which could enable their riders to escape if surrounded, or to fight more easily. These included movements such as levade, capriole, courbette, and ballotade. Movements still seen today in competitive dressage include the piaffe, passage, and half-pass.

==Compared to competitive dressage==


Modern, or competitive, dressage evolved in the competition arena, although it now exists in a very different form from its ancestor. Competitive dressage is an international sport ranging from beginner levels to the Olympics. 

In theory, competitive dressage should follow the same principles as classical dressage. However, there has been criticism by some riders for the trend at all levels for &quot;quick fixes&quot; and incorrect training that makes the horse &quot;appear&quot; correct, but that is in fact neglecting the fundamentals. Classical riders criticize such training methods on the grounds that they are biomechanically incompatible with correct movement, are painful to the horse, and cause long-term physical damage. These short-cuts usually catch up to the rider as they move up the levels and need to be corrected to perform certain movements. While these modern methods, such as the highly controversial rollkur technique, can produce winning animals, classical dressage riders argue that such training is incorrect and even abusive .

It is also believed by some that competitive dressage does not always reward the most correctly trained horse and rider, especially at the lower levels . For example, some riders who consider themselves to be training classically would not ask their horse to hold his head near-vertical when he first began training, and this would be penalized at the lower levels of competitive dressage, marked down because the horse is not considered to be correctly on the bit . Other riders, who also would consider themselves classically trained, would disagree, saying that if a horse is not ready to travel in a correct outline (&quot;on the bit&quot;) he is not ready for competition, and this is the reason such horses would be marked down .

The highest form of classical riding, as well as dressage, high school dressage, or haute école, takes years for both the horse and rider to master. When a horse is advanced in its training, it can perform not only Grand Prix dressage movements such as collected and extended gaits, passage and piaffe, but some can also perform certain &quot;Airs Above the Ground,&quot; although usually a horse will only be trained in one air, and only if it is particularly able.

==The school jumps==

The &quot;high school&quot; or &quot;haute ecole&quot; school jumps, popularly known as the &quot;airs above the ground&quot;, include the courbette, capriole, levade, and ballotade. Though these movements are said to come from when the horse was used in war, in their modern form, the airs were unlikely to have been used in actual battle, as all but the capriole expose the horse&#x27;s sensitive underbelly to the weapons of foot soldiers, and they were more likely training exercises used off the battlefield.

The courbette is a movement where the horse balances on its hind legs and jumps, keeping its fore legs off the ground, thus it &quot;hops&quot; on its hind legs.

The capriole is a movement where the horse leaps into the air and pulls his fore legs in towards his chest at the height of elevation, while kicking out with his hind legs.

The levade&#x27; is a movement where the horse is balanced on its haunches at a 45° angle from the ground. It requires great control and balance, and is very strenuous.

Two main breeds are most well known for their abilities for airs above ground: the Lipizzaner and the Andalusian. Other breeds known for their abilities in high school dressage include the Friesian and Lusitano.

The Spanish Riding School in Vienna, as well as the Cadre Noir in Saumur, still practices and teaches the &quot;haute ecole.&quot; The Spanish Riding School exclusively uses Lipizzaner stallions for their work.

Today, the only remaining large schools of classical dressage are the Cadre Noir, the Spanish Riding School, the Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art in Jerez de la Frontera, the Portuguese School of Equestrian Art in Lisbon and the Mexican Haute École of Riders Domecq in Texcoco. Independent classical dressage trainers also endeavor to keep this branch of the art alive, including the Portuguese riding master Nuno Oliveira and his students, Bent Branderup, and the American clinician, Paul Belasik.

==Dressage masters and authors==
*Xenophon (427-355 BC): Greek general, the earliest European master with surviving treatises, wrote &quot;On Horsemanship&quot; which advocated the use of sympathetic training of the horse. Despite living over 2000 years ago, his ideas are still widely praised
* Federico Grisone (mid-16th century): one of the few to write on horsemanship to that point since Xenophon. Was considered a master of his time; his methods are viewed as harsh and cruel by modern standards
* Giovanni Battista Pignatelli (mid- to late-16th century)
* Salomon de La Broue (1530–1610)
* Antoine de Pluvinel (1555–1620): the first of the French riding masters, author of &quot;L’Instruction du Roy en l’Exercise de Monter a Cheval&quot;, tutor to King Louis XIII, and is the first notable writer to advocate for gentle training since Xenophon
* William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle (1592–1676): Master of Horse to Charles II of England
* François Robichon de La Guérinière (1688–1751): taught the classical position still used today, introduced the flying change, and had great impact on the Spanish Riding School
* Maximilian Weyrother (1783–1833) director of the Spanish Riding School
* François Baucher (1796–1873): introduced the one-tempi flying change, his method, which is still hotly contested, was based on the fact that the horse&#x27;s jaw is the source of all resistance; there are two &#x27;manners&#x27; by which Baucher is known, the first a more dominant form of riding comparable to the modern rollkur, the second more associated with &#x27;lightness&#x27; and a lessening of the hands and legs as the horse progresses
* Count Antoine Cartier D&#x27;Aure (1799–1863)
* Gustav Steinbrecht (1808–1885)
* James Fillis (1834-1913)
* Alois Podhajsky (1898–1973): became director of the Spanish Riding School in 1939; his books in English translation form the basis of Classical Dressage today
* Nuno Oliveira (1925–1989) quite possibly the greatest horseman of the last century, a master of classical dressage.
* Egon von Neindorff (1923–2004): author of &quot;The Art of Classical Horsemanship&quot;

<text>John Gately Downey (June 24, 1827 – March 1, 1894) was an Irish-American politician and the seventh governor of California from January 14, 1860, to January 10, 1862. He was the first governor of California born outside the United States and the first to live in Southern California.

==Early years==

Downey was born on June 24, 1827, in the townland of Castlesampson, Taughmaconnell, County Roscommon, Ireland, to Denis Downey and Bridget Gately. Castlesampson is 12 kilometres west of the town of Athlone. He emigrated with his family at the age of 14 to the United States in 1842, before the famine years. Settling in Charles County, Maryland, the family joined two stepsisters who had already settled in the U.S. Dwindling family finances forced him to halt his education at age 16 and start working toward independence. He apprenticed at an apothecary in Washington, D.C. until 1846.

==Career==
Downey relocated to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he worked as a druggist. Like many who heard about the California Gold Rush, he went to the West Coast of the United States. He stopped along the way at Vicksburg, Mississippi; then Havana, Cuba and finally New Orleans, Louisiana. By 1849, he had arrived in California, briefly prospecting in Grass Valley before finding a job at a drug store in San Francisco.

Downey soon moved to Los Angeles and was elected for a one-year term to the Los Angeles Common Council in May 1852 and again in May 1856. He resigned from the council in December 1856.

A Lecompton Democrat who favored slavery in the Kansas Territory, Downey was elected as a member of the California State Assembly, the lower house of the State Legislature, for the 1st District, serving from 1856 to 1857. In the 1859 general elections, he was elected lieutenant governor, overcoming the split within the Democratic Party between Lecompton and Anti-Lecompton Democrats, as well as fending off a challenge from the infant Republican Party.

===Governorship===
Five days after Downey was sworn in as lieutenant governor, Governor Milton Latham resigned after being elected (by the Legislature) to fill the U.S. Senate vacancy left by the death of David C. Broderick, killed in a duel in 1859. He assumed the governorship on January 14, 1860.
During Downey&#x27;s governorship, the Assembly and Senate passed the &quot;Bulkhead Bill,&quot; a highly controversial bill heavily supported by San Francisco capitalists. It would have placed the city&#x27;s waterfront in the hands of private companies within monopolies. Despite support for the bill among San Francisco&#x27;s wealthy, local merchants and the public alike were in staunch opposition. In a move that stunned many wealthy former supporters, Downey vetoed the Bulkhead Bill, writing:
[I]ts provisions are not only in conflict with the constitution and the principles of natural justice, but that the measure as a whole is calculated to work irreparable injury to our commerce, internal and external, of which San Francisco is and must forever remain a metropolis.

Downey&#x27;s veto was widely popular in San Francisco and throughout California, and it marked the peak of his popularity. Visiting the city shortly afterward, he was greeted as a hero. But supporters of the Bulkhead Bill never forgave the governor. During a later visit to San Francisco, he described a protester as a &quot;bulkheader&quot;. The man responded with a fist fight, broken up only when his supporters physically restrained his opponent.

At the 1860 presidential election, the Democratic Party again splintered. Anti-Lecomptons favored Stephen A. Douglas, while Lecomptons supported John C. Breckinridge. Previously part of the Lecompton faction, Downey sided with Anti-Lecomptons, supporting Douglas in his failed bid against Abraham Lincoln.

===American Civil War===
By the outbreak of the American Civil War, Downey pledged support to the Union, responding to requests by U.S. Secretary of War Simon Cameron for California troop assistance. What support he gave remains vague. According to Victorian historian Theodore H. Hittell:

Downey&#x27;s unionism, it was very plain, was not of the kind by which the Union could be preserved. It meant continued submission and subserviency to slavery and the slave power, which had hitherto dominated the country while the advance of the age had outgrown it ... It cannot be said that Downey had any special love for slavery or the slave power; on the contrary, he had to a very considerable extent broken loose of the chivalry and what was called an Anti-Lecompton Democrat; but unfortunately for himself, he was still hampered with old-time doctrines when slavery ruled unquestioned ...

With the Civil War in its first stages by the 1861 general elections, Downey&#x27;s earlier support generated by his veto of the Bulkhead Bill had all but evaporated. The Democratic Party again splintered violently over slavery and the Union. Despite turning away from the Lecompton &quot;Breckinridge&quot; faction, he lost the nomination of the Anti-Lecompton &quot;Unionist&quot; Democrats during the state Democratic convention. During the election, the Republican Party capitalized on the Democratic split and won the elections. Californians voted for Leland Stanford over Breckinridge Democrat John R. McConnell and Unionist Democrat John Conness.

In 1863, the Democratic factions reunited and Downey won a unified nomination for governor. In the general election, he lost to his Republican opponent, former congressman Frederick F. Low. This effectively ended Downey&#x27;s political career.

===Bank and university foundings===
Downey returned to Southern California after leaving politics. In 1871, he helped found Farmers and Merchants Bank, the first successful bank in Los Angeles, with Isaias W. Hellman, a banker, philanthropist and future president of Wells Fargo.

In 1879, Downey joined some public-spirited citizens led by Judge Robert Maclay Widney, in laying the groundwork for the University of Southern California, the first university in the region. When Widney formed a board of trustees, he secured a donation of 308 lots of land from three prominent members of the community: Ozro W. Childs, a Protestant horticulturist; Hellman, a German-Jew; and Downey. The gift provided land for a campus as well as a source of endowment, the seeds of financial support for the nascent institution. Downey Street on the USC campus is named after him.

==Train plunge, remarriage, ranch disputes and death==
In 1883, Downey and his wife, Maria Jesus Guirado, the daughter of a prominent Mexican gentleman of Sonora, were involved in a train accident at Tehachapi Pass, when their train plunged into a ravine. A porter pulled Downey from the burning wreckage, but his wife&#x27;s charred body was misidentified and taken to San Francisco for burial. Later her remains were correctly identified and she was re-buried at Old Calvary Cemetery in Los Angeles. &quot;Nervous shock&quot; (today called post-traumatic stress disorder) affected Downey for the rest of his life.

Following the accident, Downey&#x27;s friend Frank M. Pixley introduced him to the 20-year-old Yda Hillis Addis, a new writer at Pixley&#x27;s San Francisco journal &quot;The Argonaut&quot;. He was 32 years older than her, and they became engaged to marry. When his two sisters discovered the betrothal, they were not pleased. He was a wealthy man and when he would die, his wealth would go to her. The sisters put him on a boat to Ireland. Addis sued for breach of promise, but left San Francisco before the trial. In 1888, some time after returning to America, Downey married Rosa V. Kelly, of Los Angeles, who died in 1892.

In 1880, Downey had acquired the nearly Warner&#x27;s Ranch in San Diego County, which was being used for cattle ranching. In 1892 he moved to evict Cupeño American Indians who occupied some of the land as their traditional historic territory, especially near the hot springs (&quot;Agua Caliente&quot;.) The Cupeño challenged the eviction in a case that reached the U.S. Supreme Court, but by the time it was decided in 1901, he had died. While the court ruled the Cupeño did have a right to land, it said they had waited too long to press their case, according to a law about the issue when California entered the Union. In 1903 they were relocated to the Pala Indian Reservation about away.

Downey died in 1894 at his home in Los Angeles. He was originally interred at Old Calvary Cemetery in Los Angeles, next to his first wife. After the cemetery was removed, their remains were relocated by Downey&#x27;s sisters to Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma.

==Legacy==
Downey, California was named after Downey. His land company owned the land that was subdivided to create the town in the 1870s.

During Downey&#x27;s governorship, construction began on the California State Capitol in Sacramento. Also, during his governorship, the Pony Express began service to San Francisco, and the Central Pacific Railroad was formed.

<doc id="874023" wikidata="Q5027885" url="?curid=874023" title="Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars">
<text>By 1799, the French Revolutionary Wars had resumed after a period of relative peace in 1798. The Second Coalition had organized against France, with Great Britain allying with Russia, Austria, the Ottoman Empire, and several of the German and Italian states. While Napoleon&#x27;s army was still embroiled in Egypt, the allies prepared campaigns in Italy, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.

==Egypt==
Napoleon had consolidated his control of Egypt for the time being. Soon after the beginning of the year, he mounted an invasion of Syria, capturing El Arish and Jaffa. On 17 March, he laid siege to Acre, and defeated an Ottoman effort to relieve the city at the Battle of Mount Tabor on 17 April. 

However, his repeated assaults on Acre were driven back by Ottoman and British forces under the command of Jezzar Pasha and Sir Sidney Smith. By May, with plague rampant in his army and no sign of success against the city, Napoleon was forced to retreat into Egypt. In July, Turkey, with the help of the British navy, mounted an invasion by sea from Rhodes. Napoleon attacked the Turkish beachheads and annihilated their army at Aboukir. 

In August–September, after six months of getting no news from France due to an effective enemy blockade, and now reading some French newspapers conveniently provided to him by his enemy Great Britain, Napoleon decided to return to Europe the next day, hearing from these newspapers of the political and military crisis in France. Leaving his &#x27;Army of Egypt&#x27; behind with Kléber in command, he somehow managed to sail through the British blockade and returned to France on 9 October and then on to Paris where he resolved to take control of the then five-man Directory government there in a coup.

==Netherlands==

In August, the allies mounted an invasion of the Netherlands (which at that time was a French vassal state, known as the 1795-1806 Batavian Republic) with a combined Anglo-Russian army under the Duke of York, who landed at the northern tip of Holland. This army fought a series of battles, winning the first couple of fights and then losing the next few before finally ending in defeat at Castricum on 6 October. 

That town passed from British-Russian to Batavian-French hands several times until the former finally fled, losing 2536 men and 11 guns; the Batavian-French losses stood at 1382.The Battle of Castricum persuaded the Duke that his position was untenable. After a chaotic retreat, in which two field hospitals were &quot;forgotten&quot;, he reached an agreement with the French commander, Brune. 

The British and Russians were allowed to withdraw, without paying reparations, and retaining captured bounty. As thanks, Brune received several magnificent horses from the Duke. By 19 November all the British and Russian troops had been embarked and the whole unhappy episode was over.

==Italy==

By January, the French army had pursued the Neapolitan army from Rome to Naples, taking the capital. French general Schérer attacked the Austrian army under Kray, but was heavily defeated at Magnano near Verona on 5 April. Russian general Suvorov, taking over the allied campaign, pursued the French to Cassano, defeating them and recapturing Milan and Turin. 

In June, Suvorov won the Battle of Trebbia against a reinforcing army under MacDonald, pushing the French back into the Alps and Genoa. Gen. Moreau was briefly appointed to command the French forces, followed quickly by General Joubert, who was severely defeated at Novi, a few miles south of Marengo. 

Joubert was killed there amongst the French skirmishers while reconnoitering the enemy lines.
By the end of the year, French forces had almost been driven from Italy and Suvorov was ordered to Switzerland.

==Germany==
The French offensive relied on coordinated attacks by the Army of the Danube, the Army of Mayence, and the Army of the North.

===Southwestern Germany===

On 1 March 1799, the Army of Observation, in an order of battle of approximately 30,000 men in four divisions, crossed the Rhine at Kehl and Basel. The following day, it was renamed the Army of the Danube.
 Under the command of Jourdan, the army advanced in four columns through the Black Forest. First Division, the right wing, assembled at Hüningen, crossed at Basel and advanced eastward along the north shore of the Rhine toward Lake Constance. The Advanced Guard crossed at Kehl, and Vandamme led it north-east through the mountains via Freudenstadt. 

This column eventually became the left flank. It was followed across the Rhine, also at Kehl, by the II. Division. The Third Division and the Reserve also crossed at Kehl, and then divided into two columns, III. Division traveling through the Black Forest via Oberkirch, and the Reserve, with most of the artillery and horse, by the valley at Freiburg im Breisgau, where they would find more forage, and then over the mountains past the Titisee to Löffingen and Hüfingen.

The major part of the imperial army, under command of Archduke Charles&#x27;, had wintered immediately east of the Lech, which Jourdan knew, because he had sent agents into Germany with instructions to identify the location and strength of his enemy. This was less than distant; any passage over the Lech was facilitated by available bridges, both of permanent construction and temporary pontoons and a traverse through friendly territory.

In March 1799, the Army of the Danube engaged in two major battles, both in the southwestern German theater. At the intensely fought Battle of Ostrach, 21–2 March 1799, the first battle of the War of the Second Coalition, Austrian forces, under the command of Archduke Charles, defeated Jourdan&#x27;s Army of the Danube. The French suffered significant losses and were forced to retreat from the region, taking up new positions to the west at Messkirch (Mößkirch, Meßkirch), and then at Stockach and Engen. 

At the second battle, in Stockach, on 25 March 1799, the Austrian army achieved a decisive victory over the French forces, and again pushed the French army west. Jourdan instructed his generals to take up positions in the Black Forest, and he established a base at Hornberg. From there, General Jourdan relegated command of the army to his chief of staff, Jean Augustin Ernouf, and traveled to Paris to ask for more and better troops and, ultimately, to request a medical leave.

The Army was reorganized, and a portion was placed under the command of André Masséna and merged with the Army of Helvetia. Following the reorganization and change in command, the Army participated in several skirmishes and actions on the eastern part of the Swiss Plateau, including the Battle of Winterthur. After this action, three forces of the imperial army united north of Zürich, completing a partial encirclement of Masséna&#x27;s combined Army of the Danube and Army of Switzerland. 

A few days later, at the First Battle of Zurich, Masséna was forced west, across the Limmat. In the late summer, of 1799, Charles was ordered to support imperial activities in the middle Rhineland; he withdrew north across the Rhine, and marched toward Mannheim, leaving Zürich and northern Switzerland in the hands of the inexperienced Alexander Korsakov and 25,000 Russian troops. 

Although the highly capable Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze remained in support, his 15,000 men were not able to counter Korsakov&#x27;s poor defensive arrangements. Three weeks later, at the Second Battle of Zurich, the Russian force was annihilated, and Hotze was killed south of Zürich. This left Masséna in control of northern Switzerland, and closed forced Suvorov into an arduous three-week march into the Vorarlberg, where his troops arrived, starving and exhausted, in mid-October.

==Switzerland==
In March, Masséna&#x27;s army occupied Switzerland, preparing an attack against Tyrol through Vorarlberg. However, the defeats of French armies in Germany and Italy forced him to return to the defensive. Taking over Jourdan&#x27;s army, he pulled it back into Switzerland to Zürich. Archduke Charles pursued him and drove him back at the First Battle of Zurich. 

When Charles left Switzerland for the Netherlands, the allies were left with a smaller army under Korsakov, who was ordered to unite with Suvorov&#x27;s army from Italy. Masséna attacked Korsakov, crushing him at the Second Battle of Zurich. Subsequently, the French superior forces suffered tactical setbacks, e.g. the Battle of Muottental, anyway forcing Suvorov to retreat with considerable loss. Russia abandoned the Second Coalition soon after this debacle.

<text>Karl Otto Stetter (born 16 July 1941) is a German microbiologist and authority on astrobiology. Stetter is an expert on microbial life at high temperatures.

==Career==
Stetter was born in Munich and studied biology at the Technical University of Munich. Stetter wrote Stetter&#x27;s doctoral dissertation on lactobacilli. From 1980 to 2002 Stetter was professor at, and head of, the department of microbiology and of the Archaea center of the University of Regensburg.

The majority of Stetter&#x27;s research has focused on sampling, isolating and characterizing archaeal organisms which comprise the third domain of life, particularly undiscovered extremely heat-loving (&quot;hyperthermophilic&quot;) bacteria and Archaea, also called extremophiles, growing optimally between 80 and 113 °C.

==Major discovery==
In 1992, Stetter, along with Robert Huber, discovered a new species of thermophilic bacteria near Kolbeinsey Ridge and named the species &quot;Aquifex pyrophilous&quot;. 

&quot;Nanoarchaeum equitans&quot;, an archaeal microorganism containing the world&#x27;s smallest known genome, was discovered by Stetter in 2002 in a hydrothermal vent off the coast of Iceland. This archaebacterium was described in the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; in May 2002.

==Discoveries==
Among the other extremophiles discovered by Stetter has been &quot;Pyrococcus furiosus&quot;, which was found on the Italian island of Vulcano in 1981. This extremophile was the source of Pfu DNA polymerase. Stetter also discovered &quot;Aquifex aeolicus&quot; and &quot;Aquifex pyrophilus&quot;.

==Awards and memberships==
In 2003, Stetter was honored with the Leeuwenhoek Medal by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, an award given every 10 years to the scientist who has made the most outstanding contributions to the advancement of microbiology.

Stetter is a member of the:

<text>Newton Booth (December 30, 1825July 14, 1892) was an American entrepreneur and politician who served as the 11th governor of California from 1871 to 1875 and as U.S. Senator from California from 1875 to 1881. He was the only member of the Anti-Monopoly Party elected to the U.S. Senate.

== Early life ==
Born to Hannah (née Pitts) of North Carolina and Beebe Booth of Connecticut, Quakers, in Salem, Indiana, he attended the common schools. In 1841, his parents Beebe and Hannah Booth moved from Salem to Terre Haute, Indiana. In 1846, he graduated from Asbury College (later renamed DePauw University), in nearby Greencastle, Indiana. Booth worked in his father&#x27;s Terre Haute store, then studied law in the office of attorney William Dickson Griswold (1815–1896). He was admitted to the bar in 1849 and became a partner in Griswold&#x27;s law firm.

== Business career ==
In 1850, Booth traveled to Panama, continuing by ship to San Francisco. Central Pacific Railroad founder, Lucius Anson Booth (1820–1906), a cousin, and New York native, and Thomas Morton Lindley Sr. (1819–1896), in 1849, began the firm of Lindley &amp; Booth. When Newton Booth arrived in Sacramento, the first cholera epidemic was spreading, and he went to Amador County, where he was sick for some time. The epidemic, reportedly, ended in three weeks. In May 1850, John Forshee, Lucius Anson Booth and John Dye established Forshee, Booth &amp; Co. In the Spring of 1851, Lucius Anson Booth and John Dye retired from Forshee, Booth &amp; Co. In February, 1851, Charles Smith and Newton Booth established a business of Smith &amp; Booth., on J Street, between 4th and 5th streets. Kleinhaus &amp; Co., established in 1852, Theodore P. and David W. Kleinhaus as partners.

The firms suffered from the Sacramento Fire of 2 November 1852. Soon after Lucius Anson Booth, one of the organizers of Lindley &amp; Booth, became a partner, and the firm assumed the name of Booth &amp; Co. and continued until 1856, when Newton Booth retired and returned to Indiana, while the firm consolidated with Kleinhans &amp; Co., but the name was not changed from Booth &amp; Co. In 1856, C. T. Wheeler and T. L. Barker were admitted as partners. The Kleinhaus retired in 1860, and Newton Booth again entered the firm. Lucius Anson Booth and T. L. Barker retired in 1862, and Joseph Terry Glover (1832–1886), of San Francisco, became a partner in the firm. In 1869, Lucius Anson Booth was working in SF and living in Oakland. In December 1871, business was established in San Francisco in connection with W. W. Dodge. The firm in 1878 was composed of Newton Booth, C. T. Wheeler, Joseph Terry Glover and W. W. Dodge.

Newton Booth made his fortune as a saloon keeper.

He returned to Terre Haute in 1856 and engaged in the practice of law with future U.S. Congressman Harvey D. Scott. In the summer of 1857 Booth traveled through Europe.

== Political career ==
In 1860, Booth returned to Sacramento and the wholesale mercantile business. He campaigned for Abraham Lincoln for president. In 1862, he was elected to the California State Senate, serving from 1863 to 1865. In 1871, Booth was elected the eleventh governor of California, serving from December 8, 1871, to February 27, 1875. Booth openly sought black support.
In 1873, Booth helped to organize the &quot;Dolly Vardens&quot;, a new, independent, republican, anti-monopoly political party. The party was named for a calico pattern composed of many different colors and figures, alluding to a political party made up of &quot;sore heads from any party or by any name&quot;. With their support, he was elected to the U.S. Senate as a member of the Anti-Monopoly Party in December 1873, serving from March 4, 1875, to March 3, 1881. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1880. During his time in the Senate, he served as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Manufacturers and the U.S. Senate Committee on Patents, both during the 45th Congress. In 1876, the Greenback Party nominated him for Vice President of the United States on the ticket with Peter Cooper. However, Booth declined the nomination and Samuel F. Cary replaced him. As of 2021, Booth remains the only senator from California who served as a member of a third party.

After serving in Congress, he returned to his wholesale mercantile business in Sacramento.

== Personal life ==

He married the widow of Joseph Terry Glover, his business partner, Octavine C. Glover (1833–1907) on 9 February 1892, in Sacramento, where he died, in July 1892. His wife, Octavine C. Booth (1833–1907), Glover&#x27;s mother-in-law, Eliza Payne (1810–1873); his sister-in-law, Julia E. Dunn (1839–1923); and his brother-in-law, William Henry Payne (1848–1919); are interred in the Newton Booth plot in Sacramento Historic City Cemetery.

He was the uncle of author Booth Tarkington, son of his sister Elizabeth Booth, who was raised in Terre Haute.

<doc id="874028" wikidata="Q315850" url="?curid=874028" title="Akira Yamaoka">
<text>is a Japanese composer and music producer. He is best known for composing music for several video games in the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series by Konami, among other games. Yamaoka also worked as a producer on the series, as well as composing for the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; film and its sequel. Since 2010, he has been the sound director at Grasshopper Manufacture.

== Early life ==
Yamaoka attended Tokyo Art College, where he studied product design and interior design. He originally planned to follow a career in design.

== Career ==
Yamaoka joined Konami on September 21, 1993. He immediately began to work on the games &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sparkster&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Shortly thereafter, he worked on the music for the PC Engine and Sega CD versions of &quot;Snatcher&quot;. When Konami began searching for a musician to compose &quot;Silent Hill&quot;&#x27;s score, Yamaoka volunteered because he thought he was the only one capable of making the soundtrack. Although initially hired as a composer, he soon became involved in overall sound design.

On December 2, 2009, it was announced that Yamaoka was leaving his long term employer Konami. On February 3, 2010, it was announced that Yamaoka had joined Grasshopper Manufacture and was working with Goichi Suda and Shinji Mikami on their action game, &quot;Shadows of the Damned&quot;. He was first appointed to the role of chief sound officer at Grasshopper, but became involved in aspects of game production as well.

On August 10, 2012, Yamaoka announced he would be releasing a second solo album in late 2012, one &quot;different from the usual &quot;Silent Hill&quot; music.&quot; On October 31, 2012, he announced via Facebook, that the new three-track Spanish-language single &quot;Revolución&quot; would premiere at V-CON during a live performance. In 2014, he expressed interest in returning as a composer for &quot;Silent Hills&quot;, although the project was later cancelled.

In late October and early November 2015, Yamaoka and his band performed tracks from the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series at nine live events in cities across the United Kingdom, titled &quot;Silent Hill Live&quot;. In July 2016, Yamaoka performed live at the BitSummit 4th indie game festival in Kyoto, Japan.

== Style and influences ==
When asked what other artists influenced his work, Yamaoka cited Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails as his &quot;main inspiration, both performing and in music style.&quot; Among his other influences are Angelo Badalamenti (best known for his soundtrack work with David Lynch), Metallica and Depeche Mode.

When asked if his studies at Tokyo Art College had helped him in his musical career, he replied: &quot;At that time, Mick Karn of Japan, Steve Strange of Visage, and a lot of other musicians combined the notions of Art and Music with their own new style. I got really influenced by that. Therefore, every time I write songs, I try to combine Art and Music.&quot; He has also stated that he derives much of his influence from baroque styles common throughout the 18th century.

Yamaoka stated some of his favorite songs to be &quot;Der Mussolini&quot; by D.A.F., &quot;Amber&quot; by Craig Armstrong, &quot;Moments in Love&quot; by Anne Dudley, &quot;Moon Over Moscow&quot; by Visage, and &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot; by Ennio Morricone.

== Personal life ==
Before working as a video game composer, Yamaoka initially sought a career as a designer, but instead became a musician after studying product design at Tokyo Art College. Yamaoka stated in 2009 that his favorite game creator is Suda51 and his favorite video game is &quot;No More Heroes&quot;. In March 2011, Yamaoka auctioned some of his musical instruments to raise charity funds for the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. His favorite of his own soundtracks is &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;. In 2014, he stated his favorite film was Dario Argento&#x27;s &quot;Suspiria&quot;. He is married to Ai &quot;Tamu&quot; Murata, who is the drummer of the heavy metal band Nemophila. They have two daughters.

<doc id="874029" wikidata="Q881061" url="?curid=874029" title="George C. Perkins">
<text>George Clement Perkins (August 23, 1839 – February 26, 1923) was an American businessman and politician. A member of the Republican Party, Perkins served as the 14th governor of California from 1880 to 1883, and as United States senator from California from 1893 to 1915. He also served in the California State Senate.

==Life and career==
Perkins was born in 1839 in Kennebunkport, Maine, the son of Lucinda (Fairfield) and Clement Perkins. Perkins ran away to sea at age twelve, eventually arriving in San Francisco in 1855. After making an unsuccessful effort at staking a mining claim in Butte County, Perkins worked a succession of jobs in Sacramento and the mining town of Oroville, including driving a mule team and working as a store clerk. Perkins eventually bought the Oroville store he clerked at, and was soon grossing $500,000 a year.

Perkins was elected to California State Senate in 1869, representing Butte County. While in serving in the Senate in Sacramento, Perkins met businessman Charles Miner Goodall, with whom Perkins would form what would become the Pacific Coast Steamship Company.

Leaving his Oroville business to be operated by his brother, Perkins moved to San Francisco in 1875 and expanded his interests in the shipping industry.

Perkins sought the Republican nomination for governor in 1879 and ran a successful campaign emphasizing his purported independence from railroad interests given his interests in shipping, a competing industry.

During Perkins&#x27; term as governor, former Civil War general John Mansfield served as his lieutenant governor.

Perkins was appointed to the Senate by Governor Henry Markham in 1893 following the death of Leland Stanford. As a Senator, Perkins was a part of the powerful Southern Pacific political machine, commonly called the Southern Pacific Political Bureau, headed by Southern Pacific chief counsel William F. Herrin.

Perkins is buried alongside his wife Ruth Parker Perkins in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California.

=== Personal life ===
Perkins married Ruth Parker, the daughter of his business partner Edward Parker, on May 3, 1864, in Marysville. Born in 1843 in County Cork, Ireland, she immigrated to California with her family at age eight. An avid reader of poetry, Ruth Perkins had several poems of her own published in magazines and newspapers. She died on February 4, 1921, in Oakland, California.

Perkins and his wife Ruth had seven children. Mount Perkins in California is named after him.

<text>Manduca sexta is a moth of the family Sphingidae present through much of the Americas. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1763 &quot;Centuria Insectorum&quot;.

Commonly known as the Carolina sphinx moth and the tobacco hawk moth (as adults) and the tobacco hornworm and the Goliath worm (as larvae), it is closely related to and often confused with the very similar tomato hornworm (&quot;Manduca quinquemaculata&quot;); the larvae of both feed on the foliage of various plants of the family Solanaceae. The larvae of these species can be distinguished by their lateral markings: Tomato hornworms have eight V-shaped white markings with no borders; tobacco hornworms have seven white diagonal lines with a black border. Additionally, tobacco hornworms have red horns, while tomato hornworms have dark blue or black horns. A mnemonic to remember the markings is tobacco hornworms have straight white lines like cigarettes, while tomato hornworms have V-shaped markings (as in &quot;vine-ripened&quot; tomatoes). &quot;M. sexta&quot; has mechanisms for selectively sequestering and secreting the neurotoxin nicotine present in tobacco. 

&quot;M. sexta&quot; is a common model organism, especially in neurobiology, due to its easily accessible nervous system and short life cycle. Due to its immense size &quot;M. sexta&quot; is big enough for medical imaging modalities (like CT, MRI, or PET) and used as a model in imaging and gut inflammation. It is used in a variety of biomedical and biological scientific experiments. It can be easily raised on a wheat-germ-based diet. The larva is large, and thus it is relatively easy to dissect it and isolate its organs.

==Life cycle==
&quot;M. sexta&quot; has a short life cycle, lasting about 30 to 50 days. In most areas, &quot;M. sexta&quot; has about two generations per year, but can have three or four generations per year in Florida.

===Eggs===
&quot;M. sexta&quot; eggs are spherical, approximately 1.5 millimeters in diameter, and translucent green. They typically hatch two to four days after they are laid. Eggs are normally found on the underside of foliage, but can also be found on the upper surface.

===Larva===
&quot;M. sexta&quot; larvae are bright green in color and grow up to 100 millimeters in length. The posterior abdominal segment is tipped with a dorsocaudal horn that earns them the name &quot;hornworm&quot;. The final instar consists of a cylindrical body covered with fine hairlike setae. The head is equipped with a pair of ocelli and chewing mouthparts. Each of the three thoracic segments bears a pair of true legs, and there is a pair of prolegs on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and last abdominal segments in all larval instars. The prothoracic segment bears one pair of spiracles, and additional pairs occur on each of the eight abdominal segments.

The hemolymph (blood) of this species contains insecticyanin, a blue-colored biliprotein. When the larva feeds on its normal diet of plant foliage, it ingests pigmentacious carotenoids, which are primarily yellow in hue. The resulting combination is green. Under laboratory conditions—when fed a wheat-germ-based diet—larvae are turquoise in color due to the lack of carotenoids in their diet.

The caterpillar stage of the tobacco hornworm is quite similar in appearance to that of the closely related tomato hornworm. The larvae of these two species can however be readily distinguished by their lateral markings. Specifically, the &quot;M. sexta&quot; caterpillar has seven white diagonal lines with a black border at the first seven abdominal segments, and the horn is red or green with a red tip. The &quot;M. quinquemaculata&quot;caterpillar has V-shaped white markings with no borders at all eight of its abdominal segments, and the horn is dark blue or black in color.

During the larval stage, &quot;M. sexta&quot; caterpillars feed on plants of the family Solanaceae, principally tobacco, tomatoes and members of the genus &quot;Datura&quot;. &quot;M. sexta&quot; has five larval instars, which are separated by ecdysis (molting), but may add larval instars when nutrient conditions are poor. Near the end of this stage, the caterpillar seeks a location for pupation, burrows underground, and pupates. This searching behavior is known as &quot;wandering&quot;. The imminence of pupation—suggested behaviorally by the wandering—can be anatomically confirmed by spotting the heart (aorta), which is a long, pulsating vessel running along the length of the caterpillar&#x27;s dorsal side. The heart becomes visible through the skin just as the caterpillar is reaching the end of the final instar.

A common biological control for hornworms is the parasitic braconid wasp &quot;Cotesia congregata&quot;, which lays its eggs in the bodies of the hornworms. The wasp larvae feed internally and emerge from the body to spin their cocoons. Parasitized hornworms are often seen covered with multiple white, cottony wasp cocoons, which are often mistaken for large eggs. A wasp species, &quot;Polistes erythrocephalus,&quot; feeds on hornworm larvae.

===Pre-pupa===
Before the larva pupates, it goes through a stage called the pre-pupa, where it shrinks considerably and prepares to pupate. Often people mistake this stage for a dead or dying caterpillar.

===Pupa===
The pupal stage lasts approximately 14–18 days under laboratory conditions (17 hours light, 7 hours dark, 27 °C). When reared on a short-day photoperiod (12 hours light, 12 hours dark), pupae enter a state of diapause that can last several months. During the pupal stage, structures of the adult moth form within the pupal case, which is shed during eclosion (adult emergence).

===Adult===
Adult &quot;M. sexta&quot; have narrow wings with a wing span of approximately 100 mm. &quot;M. sexta&quot; moths are nectarivorous and feed on flowers, demonstrating a remarkable ability to hover.

Adults are sexually dimorphic. Males are identifiable by their broader antennae and the presence of claspers at the end of the abdomen. Female moths are typically ready to mate one week after eclosion, and do so only once. Males may mate many times. Mating generally occurs on a vertical surface at night, and can last several hours, with the male and female facing in opposite positions, their posterior ends touching. After mating, females deposit their fertilized eggs on foliage, usually on the underside of leaves.
===Laboratory rearing===
Like &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, &quot;M. sexta&quot; is commonly used as a model organism for experiments. They are frequently studied in the laboratory due to their large size and relative ease of rearing. They may be reared on host plants, such as tobacco and tobacco relatives, tomato plants, or wheat-germ-based artificial diet. Their rearing is straightforward, provided they receive a long daylight cycle (e.g., 14 hours) during development to prevent diapause.

Eggs are rinsed for one to five minutes in dilute household bleach for disinfection.

Eggs are placed on diet cubes or host plants. The eggs hatch and develop at different speeds depending on temperature. The larvae are moved to a fresh diet or leaves as their food spoils or is consumed. When they start to &quot;wander&quot;, they are about to pupate, so are placed in a pupation chamber. Pupation chambers are holes drilled into a wood board. The &quot;Manduca&quot; larvae are sealed in the chamber using a stopper and allowed to pupate. After pupation, the pupae are placed in a breeding or colony chamber to eclose. Providing a cup of sugar water and a tobacco (or related) plant will allow mated females to oviposit fertile eggs, which can then be reared.

When fed an artificial diet, &quot;Manduca&quot; larvae do not consume the xanthophyll -which is a yellow pigment- needed to produce their green coloration; instead they appear blue. On some diets, they have very little pigment and pigment precursors, so are a very pale blue-white. As vitamin A and other carotenoids are necessary for the visual pigments (rhodopsin), an artificial-diet-reared hornworm may have poor vision due to lack of carotenoids in the diet.

===As pet food===
Captive-bred hornworms fed on an artificial diet are often given to insectivorous exotic animals, such as certain reptiles, fish and small mammals. They are preferred over wild-collected hornworms, which may bioaccumulate poisonous substances found in dietary plants. Hornworms, though originally bred for laboratories, are also farmed for this purpose. They are often sold already packed into pods that include everything the larvae need, including food. Care is relatively easy, and animals seem to relish their bright color and flavor.

== Animal model ==
&quot;M. sexta&quot; larvae grow up to 100 millimeters in length, reaching up to 20 grams. Due to their large size, they are used as alternative animal models for medical imaging modalities like computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography. Researchers around Anton Windfelder have established the larvae of &quot;M. sexta&quot; as an alternative animal model for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases or as an animal model for testing new contrast agents for radiology.

==Behavior==

===Feeding===
Tobacco hornworms are facultative specialists; the larvae can grow and develop on any host plants. However, the larvae prefer solanaceous plants, such as tobacco and tomato plants. On these types of plants, larvae grow and develop faster. The lateral and medial sensilla styloconia (sensory receptors) on their mouthparts help them to identify solanaceous plants by recognizing indioside D, a steroidal glycoside found in those particular plants (del Campo et al., 2001). Salicin is a distasteful phagodeterrent, found only in &quot;Salix&quot; spp. while caffeine is a phagodeterrent that is actually toxic. Schoonhoven 1969 found that &quot;M. sexta&quot; habituation to salicin is mediated by desensitization of the deterrence associated peripheral neurons and Glendinning et al. 1999 the same for caffeine. However Glendinning et al. 2001 find only a small peripheral desensitization for salicin, concluding that Schoonhoven erred, and that habituation in this case is centrally mediated. Tobacco hornworms are considered pests because they feed on the upper leaves of tobacco plants and leave green or black droppings on the plants. As adults, they do not damage plants since they feed on nectar.

Tobacco hornworm larvae prefer humid environments. When dehydrated, tobacco hornworm larvae will move towards a source of water or to an area with a high relative level of humidity. They use their antennae to locate water to drink .

===Defense===
Nicotine is poisonous to most animals that use muscles to move because nicotine targets the acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. However, the tobacco hornworm is capable of metabolizing nicotine from the tobacco plant and using nicotine as a defense against predators. It possesses a gene called cytochrome P450 6B46 (CYP6B46) that converts nicotine into a metabolite. About 0.65% of nicotine metabolites are transported from the gut to the hemolymph, where they are reconverted to nicotine and released into the air from the tobacco hornworm&#x27;s spiracles. The emitted nicotine is used as a way to deter spiders, a practice known as “toxic halitosis.” In one study, tobacco hornworms that fed from nicotine-deficient plants or expressed low levels of CYP6B46 were more susceptible to wolf spider predation.

Tobacco hornworm caterpillars emit short clicking sounds from their mandibles when they are being attacked. This sound production is believed to be a type of acoustic aposematism, or warning sounds that let predators know that trying to eat them will be troublesome; tobacco hornworms have been observed to thrash and bite predators after producing those clicking sounds. These clicks can be heard at a close distance with a frequency range of 5 to 50 kHz. The intensity of clicks increases with the number of attacks (Bura et al., 2012).
