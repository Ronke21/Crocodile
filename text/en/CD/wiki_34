<text>Dakshina Kannada district is located in the state of Karnataka in India, with its headquarters in the coastal city of Mangalore. The district covers an area nestled in between the Western Ghats to its east and the Arabian Sea to its west. Dakshina Kannada receives abundant rainfall during the Indian monsoon. It is bordered by Udupi district (formerly a part of this district) to the north, Chikmagalur district to the northeast, Hassan district to the east, Kodagu to the southeast and Kasaragod district of Kerala to the south. According to the 2011 census of India, Dakshina Kannada district had a population of 2,083,625. It is the only district in Karnataka state to have all modes of transport like road, rail, water and air due to the presence of a major hub, Mangalore. This financial district is also known as the Cradle of Indian banking.

== Geography ==

The district geography consists of seashore in the west and Western Ghats in the east. The soil is mostly lateritic type, characterised by high iron and aluminium content.

The major rivers are Netravathi, Kumaradhara, Gurupura (Phalguni), Shambhavi, Nandini or Pavanje and Payaswini; all join the Arabian Sea. At Uppinangadi, the Netravathi and Kumaradhara rivers rise during the monsoon and meet. This event is called &quot;Sangam&quot;, which in Sanskrit means confluence. Near Mangalore, an estuary is formed by the union of the rivers Netravathi and the Gurupura which merge into the Arabian Sea.

The topography of the district is plain up to inside the coast and changes to undulating hilly terrain sharply towards the east in the Western Ghats. Teak, bamboo and rosewood trees are found in the hilly areas towards the east. The Geological Survey of India has identified this district as a moderately earthquake-prone region and categorised it in the Seismic III Zone. In rural Dakshina Kannada, houses are in the midst of a farm field or plantations of coconut or arecanut, separated by a few hundred metres.

Shirlalu village (in the Kudremukh range of Belthangady taluk), with a maximum elevation of , is the highest point in Dakshina Kannada.

=== Climate ===

The rainfall varies from at the Mangalore coast, at Moodabidri and at Puttur near the Western Ghats. The average humidity is 75% and peaks in July at 89%.


== History ==

=== Legend ===

As per the &quot;Gramappadhathi&quot;, Dakshina Kannada (along with the rest of the west coast) was created by Parshurama standing on top of the Western Ghats, and caused the land to rise from the sea by throwing his axe. It was then given to 64 families of Brahmins to settle. He created a temple on Kunjaragiri Hill in memory of his mother. Kutashila spoken of in the Markandeya Purana is believed to be the town of Kollur, the abode of Mookambika Devi. Several rivers in the district, including the Netravati, are believed to be mentioned in the Markandeya Purana. Other traditions in the local Paddanas speak of Mayurasharma&#x27;s inviting of Brahmins from Ahichchhatraa and his organisation of the district.

=== Early history ===
The earliest recording of what would become Dakshina Kannada district is found in Sangam literature, specifically in a poem of Mamulanar. M Govinda Pai identified the kingdom of Harita mentioned in the Harivamsha as Dakshina Kannada, specifically correlating the word &quot;Mudugara&quot; with Moger, part of the title of the fishermen community in the district. Pai speculated as an alternative that the entire strip from North Kanara to Kanyakumari was inhabited by Nagas who worshipped snakes, and that the character Shankachuda mentioned in several works including the work Nagananda, was from this region. Several scholars identified the Satiyaputras mentioned in Ashoka&#x27;s edicts as belonging to this region.

The region, owing to its position on the west coast, also finds mention in Greek sources. Pliny mentioned pirates that infested the coast between the regions of Muziris and Nitiras, which many scholars have identified with the Netravati. Ptolemy mentions two ports: Barace and Maganur which modern-day scholars identified with Barsur and Mangalore respectively. Ptolemy mentioned an inland centre of pirates called Oloikhera, which has been identified with Alvakheda, or territories of the Alupas. The region also finds mention in a play called the Chariton Mime, which contains dialogue in a language scholars have variously interpreted as an early form of Kannada or Tulu.

=== Alupas ===

The Alupas (ಆಳುಪರು) ruled the erstwhile Dakshina Kannada region between the 8th and 14th century CE. Their origins go back further, and if Greek identifications are to be believed the Alupas may have been prominent local chiefs since the 2nd century CE. The Halmidi inscription of 450 CE mentions an Alupa chief fighting as a commander of the Kadambas in a battle against the Kekayas and Pallavas. In a stone inscription near Gudnapur dated to c. 500 CE, the Alupas are mentioned as subordinates to the Kadambas. In 602, the Mahakuta Pillar inscription refers to the Aluvas as being conquered by Kirtivarman I of the Chalukyas. In the Aihole inscription, it appears the Chalukyas had crushed an Alupa rebellion in the early 7th century. During the reign of Vinayadtiya, it is mentioned how the Alupa chiefs helped the king restore peace after the disastrous war with the Pallavas. This Alupa ruler, Aluvarassa I, travelled from Mangalapura (modern Mangalore). After a civil war, and the overthrow of the Chalukyas by Dantidurga in 753, the Alupas entered into tributary relations with the Pallavas. Starting in the 9th century, the Alupas began to lose territory and Rashtrakuta king Krishna II sent a military expedition which placed the Alupas firmly under Rashtrakuta control. When the Cholas occupied Alupa territory during the reign of Rajaraja I, Bankideva Alupendra drove the Cholas out. In the late 11th and early 12th century, the Alupas had to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Chalukyas of Kalyani, before it was attacked by the Hoysalas and forced to acknowledge their suzerainty. An Old Malayalam inscription (Ramanthali inscriptions), dated to 1075 CE, mentioning king Kunda Alupa, the ruler of Alupa dynasty of Mangalore, can be found at Ezhimala (the former headquarters of Mushika dynasty) near Kannur in Kerala.

=== Vijayanagara Empire ===
A 1204 inscription shows Mangalore had regained its position as capital from Barkur. Over the course of the 13th and 14th centuries, Alupa power declined steadily until Alupakheda was annexed by the Vijayangara Empire. The first Vijayanagara inscription in the district was from 1345 in Attavara. For the next three centuries, the empire administered Tulu Nadu with a firm hand especially as Tulu Nadu was the conduit through which much of their western trade, and how they secured horses from Arabia. Harihara Raya built a fort at Barkur, and instituted a revenue system where half of crops went to the cultivators while the rest were divided between landlords, Brahmins and the state. Ibn Batutta mentioned how the Muslim governor of &#x27;Honore&#x27; paid tribute to a Vijayanagara revenue collector in Barkur with the title Wadiyar. While passing from Karwar to Kozhikode, he stayed in a port identified as &#x27;Manjarur&#x27;, identified as Mangalore, and noted the country to be prosperous but with few wheeled vehicles.

Two hero stones dated to 1398 in Bhatkal record a rebellion in Tulu Nadu. At this time, the Alupa rule was basically ended and replaced with Barakur and Mangaluru , sometimes united into one Tulu Rajya. The governors were often transferred: during the reign of Devaraya II, there were eight governors of Mangaluru . During the usurpation of Saluva Narasimharaya, he did much to improve the horse trade, which had suffered under previous rulers with his governor Mallappa Nayaka. When Krishnadevaraya came to power, he largely relied on the local feudal chiefs to remain obedient. Sadashiva Nayaka of Keladi ruled over Barakuru, Mangaluru, Chandragutti and Araga .

=== Portuguese arrival ===
When the Portuguese first arrived in the region, they described Tulunadu as a prosperous trading country populated by both Moors (Muslims) and Genitles (Hindus). They were received well by Krishnadevaraya. But when they discovered Muslim merchants in Mangalore and Barakur, they blockaded the rivers leading there in 1526, they conquered Mangalore facing some resistance. Franciscan friars began preaching in Mangalore and the surrounding regions, while the Portuguese began collecting tribute in grain and other goods. In 1530, the Portuguese stormed the Mangalore fort again facing resistance they easily annihilated. In 1547, Aliya Rama Raya entered into a treaty with the Portuguese by which all imports and exports passed through their hands. This treaty was highly unpopular among the local chiefs, who often resisted Portuguese tributary collection. Some chiefs even supported the alliance of sultanates which defeated Aliya Rama Raya at the Battle of Talikota, hoping to get rid of Portuguese influence. In 1571, this failed when the Portuguese defeated Bijapur at Goa.
Rani Abbakka, the Chowta wife of Banga Raja and the Queen of Ullal, fought the Portuguese. She stopped paying tribute to the Portuguese, causing them to send a fleet to Mangalore and force a settlement, but soon she aided the enemies of the Portuguese and again stopped tribute payment. In 1566, she defeated a Portuguese expedition and killed its commander, causing the Portuguese in Goa to send an armada to subdue her in 1567. On 15 January 1568, however, the Portuguese defeated the Rani and forced her to sign a new treaty.

=== Nayakas of Keladi ===
The Nayakas of Keladi were a Veerashaiva family which had ruled a large portion of Tulu Nadu starting in the 16th century, when they had control over Mangalore and the rest of Tulu Nadu. Eventually in 1613, Venkatappa Nayaka I became independent and was the most powerful ruler in Tulu Nadu, taking territory which owed fealty to Bijapur and aiding Rani Abbakka. Under Shivappa Nayaka, the Nayakas of Keladi, now with capital at Bidnur, conquered the entirety of Tulu Nadu. Shivappa Nayaka utterly defeated the power of the Portuguese in Tulu Nadu. His successor made a treaty with the Portuguese where they could set up unarmed factories in Mangalore and Basrur, but were not to convert the locals. His successor, Keladi Chennamma, is famous for sheltering Rajaram and fending off Aurangzeb&#x27;s forces. She also put down rebellions of Tuluva chieftains. During this time Arab traders, who were kicked out by the Portuguese, burnt Mangalore and other trade towns. In 1714, due to trade disputes, the Portuguese bombarded Mangalore and defeated the ruler Basavappa Nayaka I, who promised to ban Arab traders from entering. From 1757 to 1763, while Queen Veerammaji was looking after the kingdom, the Ali Raja of Kannur along with Maratha followers led a devastating raid into the district. They plundered to Manjeshwar and took a large booty from the Kollur Mookambika temple.

=== Mysore rule ===
Due to this unrest, Hyder Ali was able to sack Bidnur in 1763 and annex Tulu Nadu the same year. He conquered Mangalore, and set a governor Latif Ali Baig. This threatened English shipping in the Arabian Sea, so during the First Anglo Mysore War in 1766 Company soldiers from Bombay conquered Mangalore. However, as soon as he heard the news of the capture of Bangalore, Tipu Sultan made a lightning attack on Mangalore and forced the British to retreat only a week after they captured Mangalore. Hyder Ali then confiscated all Portuguese holdings in the region due to their support for the English. In 1770, Hyder Ali made a treaty with the British allowing for rice to be supplied from Mangalore to Bombay. The next year, he gave Portuguese some privileges back such as the ability to evangelize. However, in 1776, Hyder Ali revoked all these privileges, ejected the Portuguese from Mangalore and built up a large navy in the region.

During the Second Anglo-Mysore War starting in 1781 the British quickly took over most of Tulunadu, as well as Bidnur, due to the treachery of the fort&#x27;s guardian Iyaz Khan. In March 1783, however, they were forced to capitulate the fort. Tippu also sent a large force to besiege Mangalore, and after two months took the fort. Tippu&#x27;s rule was harsh for the local chiefs, who he executed and dispossessed due to their perceived collaboration with the English.

=== British rule and early resistance ===
During the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799, the British returned the lands to their feudal chiefs. After Tippu&#x27;s defeat, the British gave the Raja of Coorg several maganes which had been taken from him by Hyder Ali and set up their administration, with Thomas Munro the first Collector of Kanara. However Vittala Hegde, who had fled when Tippu campaigned in Tulunadu and returned at the start of the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, began to develop an armed following to retake his lands. His ally Subba Rao attacked the Tehsildar of Kadaba, but was defeated by a British ally, Kumara Hegde. In July 1800, the British pursued the last remnants of Vittala Hedge&#x27;s army into Shishila Ghat, where they were defeated and many of the chief rebels were arrested.

At this time, the district was in severe distress due to the many bloody wars waged across it. The British deputed an administrator to study the economic condition of Kanara district, which noted severe deprivation in the south but more commerce further north. The Company then imposed harsh revenue demands on the poor peasants, who were already reeling from depression. The peasants organised themselves and participated in a &#x27;no-tax&#x27; campaign, forcing the British to rethink their tax policy on the poor. The British then invaded Coorg when its ruler objected to British interference and took all territory of the state below the Western Ghats, adding it to Kanara district.

In 1837, the British faced the Amara Sullia rebellion. After the British had deposed Kalyanaswami, a pretender to the throne of Coorg, he went to Bellare, and gathered a large number of supporters who marched on Puttur. Kalyanaswami defeated two companies of sepoys near Puttur, and Kalyanaswami then marched on Mangalore, causing the British to flee. For two weeks Kalyanaswami held Mangalore, released prisoners and set the homes of British soldiers alight. When British forces came from Thalassery to Mangalore, his poorly armed forces melted away. Kalyanaswami and other prominent leaders were hanged while others were deported to Singapore.

Before 1860, Dakshina Kannada was part of a district called Kanara, which was under a single administration in the Madras Presidency. In 1860, the British split the area into South Canara and North Canara, the former being retained in the Madras Presidency, while the latter was made a part of Bombay Presidency in 1862. Kundapur Taluk was earlier included in North Kanara but was later re-included in South Kanara. South Kanara included present Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Kasaragod districts and the Aminidivi Islands.

=== Independence movement ===
During the 1920s, several newspapers in the district drew inspiration from the freedom struggle such as &quot;Tilaka Sandesh&quot;, &quot;Satyagrahi&quot; and others. South Kanara participated in the non-cooperation movement led in the district by Karnad Sadashiva Rao. All independence movement movements gained significant traction in the district, and Gandhi and Nehru both visited Mangalore during the Freedom struggle. In 1942 large numbers of leaders were jailed in the Quit India movement.

=== Post-independence ===
In 1947 South Kanara joined India as part of Madras State. In 1956, the states were reorganised on linguistic lines. The Malayalam-majority Kasaragod subdivision became a part of Kerala, the Aminidivi Islands were joined with the Laccadive and Minicoy islands in a union territory, while the Tulu and Kannada majority Dakshina Kannada subdivision became a district of Mysore State in 1956 which later was renamed Karnataka in 1973. The Udupi district was formed from the northern taluks of Dakshina Kannada in 1997. Later, the Karnataka Government, for the purpose of administration, split the greater Dakshina Kannada district into Udupi and present day Dakshina Kannada districts on 15 August 1997. Three taluks of the former district – Udupi, Karkala and Kundapura – formed the new Udupi district.

== Administration ==

The district comprises nine talukas: Mangalore, Puttur, Sullia, Bantwal, Belthangady, Kadaba, Ullala, Mulki and Moodabidri. It used to include seven northern talukas (Udupi, Kundapur, Karkala, Hebri, Brahmavar, Kaup and Byndoor), but these were separated in August 1997 to form Udupi district. The office where taluk administration is hosted is called &quot;Taluk Kacheri&quot;. The Taluk (Taluka or Tehsil) are further divided into Hobli&#x27;s. Mangalore, Surathkal, Gurupura and Mulki are Hobli&#x27;s under Mangaluru taluk. Panemamangalore, Vitla and Bantval are under Bantwal taluk. Puttur and Uppinangady are under Puttur taluk. Belthangadi, Kokkada and Venoor are under Belthangady taluk. Sulya and Panja Hobli&#x27;s are under Sullia taluk. The newly formed taluks of Moodabidri, Ullala and Kadaba have one Hobli each. The office in which Hoblis function is called &quot;Nada Kacheri&quot;. The district has 2 revenue subdivisions, namely Mangaluru and Puttur. Mangaluru subdivision has 5 taluks and Puttur subdivision has 4 taluks.

According to legend, the district was reclaimed by Parashurama from the sea. According to the 17th-century Malayalam work &quot;Keralolpathi&quot;, the lands of Kerala and Tulu Nadu were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called &quot;Parasurama Kshetram&quot; &#x27;The Land of Parasurama&#x27;). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached.

According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar theorised, that Senguttuvan may have been inspired by the Parasurama legend, which was brought by early Aryan settlers. &quot;Nagaradhane&quot; or &quot;snake worship&quot; is practiced according to the popular belief of the &quot;Naga Devatha&quot; to go underground and guard the species on the top. Rituals such as Bhuta Kola are performed to satisfy the spirits. Kambala, a form of buffalo race on muddy track in the paddy field is organised in 16 sites across the district.

== Agriculture ==
Agriculture, which was once a major occupation of the people of Dakshina Kannada, has taken a backseat because of the influx of money from natives settled in other cities, states and countries. Significant number of people from this district work in the Gulf (Middle East) countries and other states of India. Farms and fields have been converted into residential plots and commercial (shopping) complexes around Mangalore city. Horticulture, though, has made some strides, and measures have been taken to improve the fruit plantation sector. The main crops of Dakshina Kannada are Paddy, Coconut, Arecanut, Black Pepper, Cashew and Cocoa. Rice is generally cultivated three seasons in a year, &quot;Karthika&quot; or &quot;Yenel&quot; (May–October), &quot;Suggi&quot; (October to January) and &quot;Kolake&quot; (January to April). &quot;Urad&quot; (Black gram) is grown in some areas during the season of Suggi. The Karnataka Milk Federation has a milk processing plant at Kulshekar in Mangalore. This plant processes milk procured from the cattle owned by farmers of the district.

== Cuisine ==
Some of the well-known Tuluva community dishes in this district include Kori Rotti (dry rice flakes dipped in chicken gravy), Bangude Pulimunchi (spicy sour silver-grey mackerels), Beeja-Manoli Upkari, Neer dosa, Boothai Gasi and Kadubu. In Coastal Karnataka, the Mangalorean Fish Curry is a popular dish. The Konkani community&#x27;s specialties include Daali thoy, Bibbe-upkari (cashew based), Val val, Avnas ambe sasam, Kadgi chakko, Paagila podi, Malpuri, Patrode and Chane gashi. Mangalore bajji, also known as Golibaje, is a popular snack made from maida, curd, rice flour, chopped onion, coriander leaves, coconut, cumin, green chillies, and salt. Tulu vegetarian cuisine in Mangalore, also known as Udupi cuisine, is known and liked throughout the state and the coastal region. Being a coastal district, fish forms the staple diet of most people.

The Beary community have their own unique dishes. &quot;Pattir&quot;, &quot;Pole&quot;, &quot;Pulchepole&quot;, &quot;Kalthappa&quot;, &quot;Aapa&quot;, &quot;Neyyappa&quot;, &quot;Neypathir&quot;, &quot;Irmandappa&quot;, &quot;Pindi&quot;, &quot;Erchi pindi&quot;, &quot;Kunji pindi&quot;, and &quot;Vodupole&quot; are some of the traditional breakfasts and are primarily made from rice. Various dishes made from fresh or dried fish are also extensively consumed. Molavtanni made from lentils or sprouted pulses is the traditional soup usually eaten along with rice. Kakka is the traditional gravy made from fish, chicken, egg or mutton. Like in other coastal cuisine, coconut and its products form integral part of the Beary cuisine.

Mangalorean Catholics&#x27; Sanna-Dukra Maas (&quot;Sanna&quot; means Idli fluffed with toddy or yeast and &quot;Dukra Maas&quot; means Pork) Pork Bafat and Sorpotel . Pickles such as Happala, Sandige and Puli munchi are unique to Mangalore.

<text>Blindheim (), traditionally known in English as Blenheim ( ), is a village and a municipality in the Bavarian district of Dillingen in southern Germany. It is north of Augsburg, on the left bank of the Danube River. 

The municipality consists of four villages (Blindheim, Unterglauheim, Wolpertstetten and Berghausen). Its population is roughly 1,700. For administrative purposes, it is affiliated with the municipal association of Höchstädt an der Donau.

Since about 1700 the Lordship of Blindheim in the Electorate of Bavaria has been held by the Counts of Rechberg.

On 13 August 1704 the Battle of Blenheim () was fought in the vicinity, having decisive importance on the War of the Spanish Succession. Blenheim Palace in England and Blenheim, the most populous town in the New Zealand region of Marlborough, were named in memory of the battle, and thus ultimately after Blindheim.

In June 1800, the armies of the French First Republic, under command of Jean Victor Moreau, fought Habsburg regulars and Württemberg contingents, under the general command of Pál Kray. At this battle, the culmination of the Danube Campaign of 1800, Moreau forced Kray to abandon Ulm and withdraw into eastern Bavaria.

<text>Bakkeveen () is a village in the municipality of Opsterland in eastern Friesland (Fryslân) in the Netherlands. It had a population of around 1,465 in January 2017.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1232-1233 as &quot;apud Backenvene&quot;, and means &quot;raised bog of Bakke (person)&quot;. Bakkeveen developed in the 13th century around the outpost Mariënhof of monastery in Hallum. 

In 1685, the Bakkeveense vaart was dug by the Drachtster Company to exploit the peat in the region. From 1732 onwards, the houses were moved to the canal by order of &quot;Jonkheer&quot; Tjaerd van Aylva. A church was planned and a model had even been made, however it was never built.

Bakkeveen was home to 453 people in 1840. The Dutch Reformed church was finally built in 1856 in neoclassic style. The was a farm built in 1818. In 1922, it was transformed into an estate by Baron . The estate has a forest. The estate was purchased by Vereniging Natuurmonumenten in 1997. 

In the late-20th century, the forests and heaths attracted recreational tourism to Bakkeveen.

<doc id="883465" wikidata="Q5342206" url="?curid=883465" title="Edward Cardwell">
<text>Edward Cardwell (178723 May 1861) was an English theologian also noted for his contributions to the study of English church history. In addition to his scholarly work, he filled various administrative positions in the University of Oxford.

==Life==
Cardwell was born at Blackburn in Lancashire. He was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford (B.A. 1809; M.A. 1812; B.D. 1819; D.D. 1831), and after being for several years tutor and lecturer, was appointed, in 1814, one of the examiners to the university.

In 1825, Cardwell was chosen Camden Professor of Ancient History and held the chair for 35 years, the longest of any occupant to date. In 1831, he succeeded Archbishop Whately as principal of St Alban Hall (later merged with Merton College).

Cardwell was one of the best men of business in the university, and held various important posts, among which were those of delegate of the press, curator of the university galleries, manager of the Bible department of the press, and private secretary to successive chancellors of the university. He established the Wolvercote paper mill.

Cardwell died at Oxford on 23 May 1861.

==Works==
Cardwell&#x27;s major works were in the field of English church history. He planned an extensive work on the entire synodical history of the church in England, which was to be based on David Wilkins&#x27;s &quot;Concilia Magnae Britanniae et Hiberniae&quot;. He carried out some portions only. The first published was &quot;Documentary Annals of the Reformed Church of England from 1546 to 1716&quot;, which appeared in 1839.

It was followed by a &quot;History of Conferences, etc.&quot;, connected with the &quot;Revision of the Book of Common Prayer&quot; (1840). On 1842 appeared &quot;Synodalia, a Collection of Articles of Religion, Canons, and Proceedings of Convocation from 1547 to 1717&quot;, completing the series for that period. Closely connected with these works is the &quot;Reformatio Legum Ecclesiasticarum&quot; (1850), which treats of the efforts for reform during the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, and Elizabeth I.

During his tenure as Camden Professor, Cardwell published editions of the &quot;Ethics&quot; of Aristotle (Oxford, 1828) and his course of &quot;Lectures on the Coinage of the Greeks and Romans&quot; (Oxford, 1832). He published in 1837 a students&#x27; edition of the Greek Testament, and an edition of the Greek and Latin texts of the History of the Jewish War, by Josephus, with illustrative notes.

Cardwell also published in 1854 a new edition of Bishop Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Synodus Anglicana&quot;.

<doc id="883468" wikidata="Q1510380" url="?curid=883468" title="Grove (nature)">
<text>A grove is a small group of trees with minimal or no undergrowth, such as a sequoia grove, or a small orchard planted for the cultivation of fruits or nuts. Other words for groups of trees include &quot;woodland&quot;, &quot;woodlot&quot;, &quot;thicket&quot;, and &quot;stand&quot;. A grove may be called an &#x27;arbour&#x27; or &#x27;arbor&#x27; (see spelling differences), which is not to be confused with the garden structure pergola, which also sometimes goes under that name.

== Name ==
The main meaning of &quot;grove&quot; is a group of trees that grow close together, generally without many bushes or other plants underneath. It is an old word in the English language, with records of its use dating as far back as the late 9th century as Old English &quot;grāf&quot;, &quot;grāfa&quot; (&#x27;grove; copse&#x27;) and subsequently Middle English &quot;grove&quot;, &quot;grave&quot;; these derive from Proto-West Germanic *graib, *graibō (&#x27;branch, group of branches, thicket&#x27;), from Proto-Germanic *graibaz, *graibô (&#x27;branch, fork&#x27;).

It is related to Old English &quot;grǣf&quot;, &quot;grǣfe&quot; (&#x27;brushwood; thicket; copse&#x27;), Old English &quot;grǣfa&quot; (&#x27;thicket&#x27;), dialectal Norwegian &quot;greive&quot; (&#x27;ram with splayed horns&#x27;), dialectal Norwegian &quot;greivlar&quot; (&#x27;ramifications of an antler&#x27;), dialectal Norwegian &quot;grivla&quot; (&#x27;to branch, branch out&#x27;), Old Norse &quot;grein&quot; (&#x27;twig, branch, limb&#x27;), and cognate with modern English &quot;greave&quot;.

== Cultivation ==

Naturally-occurring groves are typically small, perhaps a few acres at most. In contrast, orchards, which are normally intentional planting of trees, may be small or very large, like the apple orchards in Washington state, and orange groves in Florida.

== Cultural significance ==

Historically, groves were considered sacred in pagan, pre-Christian Germanic and Celtic cultures. Helen F. Leslie-Jacobsen argues that &quot;we can assume that sacred groves actually existed due to repeated mentions in historiographical and ethnographical accounts. e.g. Tacitus, &quot;Germania&quot;.&quot;

<text>Edmund Gibson (16696 September 1748) was a British divine who served as Bishop of Lincoln and Bishop of London, jurist, and antiquary.

==Early life and career==
He was born in Bampton, Westmorland. In 1686 he was entered a scholar at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. Shortly after Thomas Tenison&#x27;s elevation to the see of Canterbury in 1694 Gibson was appointed chaplain and librarian to the archbishop, and in 1703 and 1710 respectively he became rector of Lambeth and archdeacon of Surrey.

==Episcopal career==
In 1716 Gibson was presented to the see of Lincoln, whence he was in 1723 translated to London. For twenty-five years he exercised influence, being consulted by Sir Robert Walpole on ecclesiastical affairs.

While a conservative in church politics, and opposed to Methodism, he was no persecutor, and indeed broke with Walpole on the Quakers&#x27; Relief Bill of 1736. He exercised oversight over the morals of his diocese; and his denunciation of the masquerades which were popular at court finally lost him the royal favour. He served as a founding governor of a charity called the Foundling Hospital. His endorsement can be seen as significant since the Foundling Hospital, created by royal charter, was the nation&#x27;s first non-church initiated institution to target this sort of social ill.

Gibson died in 1748, and is buried at All Saints Church, Fulham, London.

==Works==

In 1692 Gibson published an edition of the &quot;Saxon Chronicle&quot; with a Latin translation, indices and notes, and later a similar translation of the Lindsey Chronicle. These were followed in 1693 by an annotated edition of the &quot;De institutione oratoria&quot; of Quintilian, and in 1695 by a translation of William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot;, with additions and improvements, for which he recruited a team of antiquaries including Edward Lhuyd, William Lloyd and John Smith.

In the discussions which arose during the reigns of William and Anne relative to the rights and privileges of the Convocation, Gibson took a very active part, and in a series of pamphlets warmly argued for the right of the archbishop to continue or prorogue even the lower house of that assembly.

The controversy suggested to him the idea of those researches which resulted in the &quot;Codex juris ecclesiastici Anglicani&quot;, published in two volumes folio in 1713, a work which discusses more learnedly and comprehensively than any other the legal rights and duties of the English clergy, and the constitution, canons and articles of the English Church. His substantial collection of pamphlets on which his research is based are housed at Lambeth Palace Library (where he began his clerical career as Librarian), as part of the Sion College Collection.

Among the literary efforts of his later years the principal were a series of &quot;Pastoral Letters&quot; in defence of the gospel revelation, against lukewarmness and enthusiasm, and on various topics of the day; also the &quot;Preservative against Popery&quot;, in 3 vols. folio (1738), a compilation of numerous controversial writings of eminent Anglican divines, dating chiefly from the period of James II.

A second edition of the &quot;Codex juris&quot;, revised and improved, with large additions by the author, was published at Oxford in 1761. Besides the works already mentioned, Gibson published a number of Sermons, and other works of a religious and devotional kind. The &quot;Vita Thomae Bodleii&quot; with the &quot;Historia Bibliothecae Bodleianae&quot; in the &quot;Catalogi librorum manuscriptorum&quot; (Oxford, 1697), and the &quot;Reliquiae Spelmannianae&quot; (Oxford, 1698), are also from his pen.

<text>Townsend&#x27;s warbler (Setophaga townsendi) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family.

==Taxonomy==
Townsend&#x27;s warbler was formally described in 1837 by the American naturalist John Kirk Townsend under the binomial name &quot;Sylvia townsendi&quot;. The type locality is Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River in the state of Washington. After the merger of the genera &quot;Dendroica&quot; and &quot;Setophaga&quot;, Townsend&#x27;s warbler is now placed in the genus &quot;Setophaga&quot; that was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1827. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
Townsend&#x27;s warbler has a yellow face with a black stripe across its cheeks extending into an ear patch, a thin pointed bill, two white wing bars, olive upperparts with black streaks on their backs and flanks, and a white belly. Adult males have a black cap, black throat and yellow lower breast; females have a dark cap and a yellow throat. Immature birds are similar to females with a dark green cap and cheeks.
==Life history==

Their breeding habitats are coniferous forests with large trees on the northwestern coast of North America. Their nests are shallow cups built with grass and lined with moss. These nests are usually placed atop a branch in a conifer. The female lays 4 to 5 brown-speckled white eggs.

This bird is closely related to the hermit warbler, and the two species interbreed where their ranges overlap.

Birds from Haida Gwaii migrate short distances further south on the Pacific coast. Other birds winter in Mexico, Central America, and the south-western United States.

They forage actively in the higher branches, often gleaning insects from foliage and sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight. They mainly eat insects and spiders and seeds. Outside of the nesting season, these birds forage in mixed flocks. In winter, they also eat berries and plant nectar, and honeydew directly from the anus of scale insects.

The song of the male bird is a buzzed &quot;zee-zee-zee-bzz-zee&quot; or &quot;weazy weazy weazy weazy twea&quot;, somewhat similar to that of its eastern relative, the black-throated green warbler. The call is a sharp &quot;tup&quot;.

This bird was named after the American ornithologist, John Kirk Townsend. Although Townsend is also credited with first describing this bird, he used a name chosen by Thomas Nuttall, who was travelling with him, and so sidestepped the convention against naming a species after oneself.

<text>Richard Estcourt (1668–1712) was an English actor, who began by playing comedy parts in Dublin.

His first London appearance was in 1704 as Dominick, in Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Spanish Friar&quot;, and he continued to take important parts at Drury Lane, being the original Pounce in Steele&#x27;s &quot;Tender Husband&quot; (1705), Sergeant Kite in Farquhar&#x27;s &quot;Recruiting Officer&quot;, and Sir Francis Gripe in Mrs Centlivre&#x27;s &quot;Busybody&quot;. He was an excellent mimic and a great favourite socially.

Estcourt wrote a comedy, &quot;The Fair Example, or the Modish Citizen&quot; (1703), and &quot;Prunella&quot; (1704), an interlude. He also was the first president of the first London Beefsteak Club.

<doc id="883479" wikidata="Q2385226" url="?curid=883479" title="List of districts of Karnataka">
<text>The southern Indian state of Karnataka consists of 31 districts grouped into 4 administrative divisions, &quot;viz&quot;., Belagavi, Bengaluru, Gulbarga, and Mysore. Geographically, the state has three principal variants: the western coastal stretch, the hilly belt comprising the Western Ghats, and the plains, comprising the plains of the Deccan plateau.
==History==
Karnataka took its present shape in 1956, when the former states of Mysore and Coorg were unified into a linguistically homogenous Kannada-speaking state along with agglomeration of districts of the former states of Bombay, Hyderabad, and Madras as part of the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. The unified Mysore State was made up of ten districts, &quot;viz&quot;., Bangalore, Kolar, Tumkur, Mandya, Mysore, Hassan, Chikkamagalur, Shimoga, Chitradurga, and Ballari which had been transferred from Madras Presidency to Mysore State earlier in 1953, when the new state of Andhra Pradesh was created out of Madras&#x27; northern districts. Coorg State became Kodagu district, South Canara was transferred from Madras State, North Canara, Dharwad, Belgaum, and Bijapur from Bombay State. Bidar, Gulbarga, and Raichur from Hyderabad State. The state received its new name of Karnataka in the year 1973.

=== Formations of districts ===
===Proposed districts===
Currently there are demands to carve out the following district,
* Bailhongala, Kitturu, Chikkodi and Gokak from Belagavi (largest district)
*Tipaturu from Tumakuru
*Sirsi from Uttara Kannada
*Jamakhandi from Bagalkote
*Madhugiri from tumakuru

==Administrative structure==
A district of an Indian state is an administrative geographical unit, headed by a Deputy Commissioner (DC), an officer belonging to the Indian Administrative Service. The deputy commissioner is assisted by a number of officers belonging to the Karnataka Administrative Service. The Deputy Commissioner is also the Collector and District Magistrate of the district. The deputy commissioner/collector is assisted by assistant commissioners and tahsildars, who are incharge of subdivisions and taluks respectively.

A Superintendent of Police (SP), usually an officer belonging to the Indian Police Service (IPS), is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining law and order and related issues of the district. He is assisted by the officers of the Karnataka Police Service and other Karnataka Police officials. Big cities like Bengaluru, Belagavi, Hubballi-Dharwad, Kalaburagi, Mangaluru and Mysuru are headed by a Commissioner of Police holding the rank of Additional Director General of Police(ADGP) for Bengaluru, Inspector General of Police (IGP) for Mysuru and Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) for Belagavi, Hubballi-Dharwad, Kalaburagi and Mangaluru. They are assisted by officers belonging to the Karnataka Police Service (KSPS).

A Deputy Conservator of Forests, an officer belonging to the Indian Forest Service selected through the UPSC examination is responsible for managing the forests, the environment and wildlife of the district. He is assisted by the officers of the Karnataka Forest Service selected through the KPSC examination.

Sect-oral development is looked after by the district head of each development department such as Public Works, Health, Education, Agriculture, Animal husbandry, etc. These officers belong to the various state services.

<text>Susanna Centlivre (c. 1669 (baptised) – 1 December 1723), born Susanna Freeman, and also known professionally as Susanna Carroll, was an English poet, actress, and &quot;the most successful female playwright of the eighteenth century&quot;. Centlivre&#x27;s &quot;pieces continued to be acted after the theatre managers had forgotten most of her contemporaries.&quot; During a long career at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, she became known as the second woman of the English stage, after Aphra Behn.

==Life==
The main source of information on Centlivre&#x27;s early life is Giles Jacob, who claimed he had received an account of it directly from her. This was published in &quot;The Poetical Register&quot; of 1719, yet it includes little information about her early life. Centlivre was probably baptised Susanna Freeman at Whaplode, Lincolnshire on 20 November 1669, as the daughter of William Freeman of Holbeach and his wife, Anne, the daughter of Mr Marham, a gentleman of Lynn Regis, Norfolk. Her father was a dissenter and a parliamentarian; as a result, the family certainly faced persecution at the Restoration. 

Several biographical sources state that Holbeach was the possible place of her birth or at least the place where she spent her childhood. There is some mystery surrounding her early life, but it is generally believed that her father died when she was three, her mother died shortly after remarrying, and her stepfather married soon after that. 

There are two stories that tell of her transition to acting and eventual arrival in London. The romanticized version has Centlivre found weeping by the roadside by Anthony Hammond, a student at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Enraptured by her manners and good looks, he smuggled her into his college, where she was disguised as a male cousin, Jack. There she remained hidden for some months studying grammar and acquiring &quot;some of the terms of logic, rhetoric, and ethics&quot; before &quot;attracting too much attention&quot; and deciding to head to London. The more believable scenario has her joining a company of strolling actors in Stamford (about 25 miles from Holbeach), where she gained popularity acting in breeches roles, for which she was suited due to a &quot;small Wen on her left Eye lid, which gave her a Masculine Air.&quot; 

Centlivre&#x27;s skill in such roles charmed many men, especially Mr Fox, who would soon become Centlivre&#x27;s first husband when she was sixteen. However, he died less than a year later. Following Fox&#x27;s death, Centlivre is claimed to have married an army officer named Carroll, who died in a duel a year and a half after their union. She kept the name Carroll until her next marriage. Although much of her early years is speculation, biographers agree that Susanna&#x27;s knowledge was predominantly self-acquired through reading and conversation. Looking at her use of French drama, it is not hard to see that Centlivre also had a sound knowledge of the French language. After her husband&#x27;s death, Centlivre spent much of her time in London, where she turned to writing partly for financial support.

By 1706, Centlivre had made a small name for herself; however, she still relied on financial support from strolling (acting). It was during a performance when she played the role of Alexander the Great in Nathaniel Lee&#x27;s tragedy &quot;The Rival Queens, or the Death of Alexander the Great&quot; for the court at Windsor Castle that she caught the eye of Joseph Centlivre. Though he was of a lower social class, a mere &quot;yeoman of the mouth [cook] to Queen Anne,&quot; they were married on 23 April 1707. 

There is no evidence to suggest where they resided for the first seven years of their marriage. Eventually, in late 1712 or early 1713, the Centlivres moved into residence at Buckingham Court, Spring Gardens, paying the highest rent second only to the Admiralty Office. After a long, illustrious career in high literary esteem with writings in the form of poems, letters, books, and, most famously, plays, Susanna Centlivre died on 1 December 1723, from lingering effects of a serious illness contracted in 1719. &quot;The Evening Post&quot;, &quot;London Journal&quot;, &quot;British Journal&quot;, and &quot;Weekly Journal&quot; had brief notices of her death. Centlivre&#x27;s body was buried three days after her death in St. Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden. A little over a year later, her husband followed.

==Writings 1700–1710==
Giles Jacob mentions Centlivre&#x27;s inclination to poetry with her first poem being written when she was merely seven years old. However, her first published work, a series of five letters, would not appear until May 1700. These letters contain playful, witty back-and-forth banter between her and the correspondent. Although early in her career, she is complimented as woman of sense. In July 1700, Abel Boyer published a second set of Centlivre&#x27;s letters (among other writers). This time, Centlivre published the letters under the name of Astrea, a pen name previously used by Aphra Behn, a move that was most likely motivated by a wish for public attention. In the letters, the exchange between Astrea and Celadon (Capt. William Ayloffe) are of particular interest due to their intense romantic suggestions. However, biographers generally agree that this was merely practice for the epistolary fiction form. 

We also get a glimpse of Centlivre&#x27;s poetry in her correspondence with George Farquhar, who also sometimes published under the name Celadon. Again, it is hard to suggest a definitive romantic relationship between Farquhar and Centlivre; the letters may have been intended for the public eye. Centlivre continued in September 1700, when she contributed a poem, &quot;Of Rhetorick,&quot; under the name Polumnia, to The Nine Muses, an elegiac poetry collection left on the grave of John Dryden.

In October 1700, Centlivre published her first play, &quot;The Perjur&#x27;d Husband: or, The Adventures of Venice&quot;. This tragicomedy (although considered a tragedy at the time) was performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and, according to Centlivre, &quot;went off with a general Applause.&quot; It was published under Susanna&#x27;s own name, and the prologue made a point of pride out of its female authorship. By the end of 1700, with a long list of literary acquaintances and actors alike, Centlivre was well established in London.

Her next play, &quot;The Beau&#x27;s Duel&quot;, was performed in June 1702. Well received in its own right, the play did not see a lengthy stage life. Over the next five years or so, Centlivre&#x27;s work was less successful. As a result, her next two plays, &quot;The Stolen Heiress&quot; (December 1702) and &quot;Love&#x27;s Contrivance&quot; (June 1703), were performed under attempts to conceal the sex of the author. Although received well, all of Centlivre&#x27;s plays up to this point had been performed at inopportune times in the season. It wasn&#x27;t until &quot;Love&#x27;s Contrivance&quot; that the experience and reputation of the cast allowed for a three-night run (in addition to some later productions and an eventual revival, three years after her death). Centlivre&#x27;s next comedy, &quot;The Gamester&quot;, was first performed in February 1705. Here, she declared her intent to reform gamblers. This play was Centlivre&#x27;s most successful to date and was frequently revived in later years.
In 1705, Centlivre, in a brief moment away from the theatre, wrote a complimentary poem for a collection by Sarah Fyge Egerton. Centlivre continued the gambling theme in her next play entitled &quot;The Basset Table&quot;, performed in November 1705. Although not explicit regarding its authorship, this play&#x27;s Epilogue indirectly attributes the play to a woman. Following her success with &quot;The Basset Table&quot;, Centlivre wrote &quot;Love at a Venture&quot; and saw it performed in 1706.

Centlivre was a highly successful professional playwright. A similarly renowned playwright, Colley Cibber, was accused of borrowing parts of &quot;Love at a Venture&quot; to write his own play, &quot;The Double Gallant&quot;. However, in an apparent reconciliation he accepted a part in Centlivre&#x27;s next play, &quot;The Platonick Lady&quot; (November 1706). Having grown weary with anonymous authorship, Centlivre used the preface to &quot;The Platonick Lady&quot; to express her distaste for society&#x27;s outlook on the female writer. 

Following her third marriage, Centlivre took some time off. This decision turned out to be a good one; her time away resulted in her most successful comedy, &quot;The Busie Body&quot; (May 1709). The play ran for thirteen nights, a remarkable run for the time, and was revived the following season. 

Centlivre&#x27;s next play, &quot;The Man&#x27;s Bewitch&#x27;d&quot;, was first performed in December 1709, and satirized the squirearchy of Tory gentlemen. This political satire appeared during an ongoing election campaign, and the Tory press struck back. The weekly &quot;Female Tatler&quot; printed an &quot;interview&quot; that it claimed to have done with Centlivre, where she insulted the actors and blamed them for all her failures. The acting company was on the verge of walking out on her before she persuaded them that she was the victim of a politically inspired hoax.

==Writings 1710–1723==
All of Centlivre&#x27;s later works have a clear anti-Tory, pro-Whig political affiliation, &quot;notable through the characters of tory fathers or guardians, whose party fervour forms another obstacle to the happiness of young lovers – always whiggishly inclined.&quot; 

In March 1710, Centlivre released &quot;A Bickerstaff&#x27;s Burying&quot;, a political satire. Despite the risk of annoying Anne, Queen of Great Britain, Centlivre was not afraid to openly support the Hanoverian succession. Next, Centlivre took it upon herself to write a sequel to the successful &quot;The Busy Body&quot;, entitled &quot;Marplot, or, The Second Part of the Busie-Body&quot; (December 1710). Although it didn&#x27;t receive the same attention as its precursor, it was performed seven times. The sequel reflects Centlivre&#x27;s continuing interest in politics, specifically the battle between Whig and Tory. Once again, Centlivre turned to poetry with a complimentary poem on the recovery of the Duke of Newcastle&#x27;s daughter. Although this might seem an odd subject to modern readers, Centlivre was merely following conventional protocol in securing patronage. 

With her next comedy, &quot;The Perplex&#x27;d Lovers&quot; (January 1712), Centlivre became outspoken in her political stance. Most of her plays over the next five years were directly related to the advancement of the Whigs and the House of Hanover. The play&#x27;s success was limited, and it only ran for three nights. The theatre managers banned the Epilogue for fear of backlash. 

In 1713, after moving into a new home in Buckingham Court, Centlivre wrote two poems. The first poem is a response to Anne Oldfield&#x27;s brilliant performance in a play. The second, entitled &quot;The Masquerade,&quot; is addressed to the Duke d&#x27;Aumont, ambassador from France. Centlivre&#x27;s next play was &quot;The Wonder&quot; (April 1714), a comedy. She dedicated the play to the then Duke of Cambridge. This political move of showing loyalty to the House of Hanover was risky, but, in the end, paid off for Centlivre when the Duke ascended the throne as King George I. We can see her gloating in an ironic autobiographical poem, &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Case.&quot; Not solely a political play, &quot;The Wonder&quot; was a popular hit and notably was the performance in which famous actor/playwright David Garrick chose &quot;to make his farewell to the stage on 10 June 1776.&quot; 

Centlivre&#x27;s next two plays, &quot;A Gotham Election&quot; and &quot;A Wife Well Manag&#x27;d&quot;, were published in 1715 (although &quot;A Gotham Election&quot; would not be performed until 1724) and fell under her now common theme, political farce. These two plays illustrate how Centlivre was ahead of her time with her exemplification of social problems in the theatre.
In 1716, as a response to a Whig leader&#x27;s illness and subsequent retirement, Centlivre contributed a poem to a small publication entitled &quot;State Poems&quot;. Her contribution was &quot;Ode to Hygeia&quot;. She followed this with a series of poems in response to the political climate of the time. After attacks by satirist Alexander Pope on Centlivre and others, she and co-author Nicholas Rowe published her next play, &quot;The Cruel Gift&quot; (December 1716). It was her first heroic drama (often considered tragedy): the reception was good, and the play was performed seven times that year. In February 1718 Centlivre published &quot;A Bold Stroke for a Wife&quot;. This comical farce was very successful and is considered by some to be her best play. It is the only play for which Centlivre claims complete originality. (It was not uncommon for dramatists to procure various plot pieces and characters from other works.) 

Continuing her political works, in 1717 Centlivre directed her attention to Charles XII, a Swedish king threatening to attack England. She published a poem, entitled &quot;An Epistle from a Lady of Great Britain to the King of Sweden, on the intended Invasion,&quot; in response to Charles&#x27;s threats. We have two records of poems to Mr. Rowe (Nicholas) in 1718. The first was written during a visit to her hometown of Holbeach and is entitled &quot;From the Country, To Mr. ROWE in Town. M.DCC.XVIII.&quot; The second poem followed Rowe&#x27;s death and is entitled &quot;A PASTORAL TO THE Honoured Memory of Mr. ROWE.&quot; The sincerity in the elegy brought Centlivre positive attention. 

In 1719, Centlivre became seriously ill. Although the effects of this illness would linger until her death, she continued to write. We find two more published poems in 1720. Both are included in Anthony Hammond&#x27;s &quot;A New Miscellany of Original Poems, Translations, and Imitations&quot;. Following this, Centlivre published a poem entitled &quot;A Woman&#x27;s CASE: in an Epistle to CHARLES JOYE, Esq; Deputy-Governor of the South Sea&quot;, that traces her political associations and shines some light on her relationship with her husband. She continued to write poetry until her death. Her last play, &quot;The Artifice&quot;, was produced and published in October 1722.

==Themes and genres==
Centlivre reflected positively on England&#x27;s political, economic, and juridical systems. Her plays were often concerned with a theme of liberty within the areas of marriage and citizenry.

===Politics===
Centlivre was sometimes a political dramatist. She was anti-Catholic, as is shown by some of her play dedications, prologues and epilogues. This is especially apparent in her dedication at the beginning of &quot;The Wonder&quot;, where she expressed her strong support for the proposed Protestant succession. The majority of her plays eschew party political commentary, her only work with an overtly political agenda being &quot;The Gotham Election&quot;. Some of her more controversial epilogues, such as that of &quot;The Perplexed Lovers&quot; where she identifies the out-of-favour war hero Marlborough as the &quot;ONE&quot;, were not spoken in the theatre, just published in the play text.

===Comedies===
Centlivre is best known for her comedies, often following the Spanish style, which is &quot;romantic in plot and spirit, [but containing] far more of the emotions of love and jealousy than Restoration comedies.&quot; This type of comedy tended to focus on the romantic intrigues among a triangle of wealthy main characters (generally one young woman being fought over by two young men, one promiscuous, the other devoted). It often involves disguises, duels (or talk of them), and scenarios that balance emotion and farce. Her best-known comedies feature quick-witted female intellects to equal their male counterparts. Due to the widespread prejudice against women playwrights, Centlivre sometimes wrote under a pseudonym, or withheld more controversial messages.

===Tragedies===
Little positive is said of her two tragi-comedies, &quot;The Perjur&#x27;d Husband&quot; and &quot;The Stolen Heiress&quot;, although her pure tragedy, &quot;The Cruel Gift&quot;, was somewhat better received. These plays were thought to have &quot;figures [that] are shadowy and [a] plot [that] is unconvincing.&quot;

==Reception and criticism==
Her plays were popular with audiences but less so with literary critics such as William Hazlitt who wrote condescendingly of them. Satirist Alexander Pope found her writings offensive for political and religious reasons, and thought them a threat to greater dramatists by pandering to popular taste. He assumed that she had helped with Edmund Curll&#x27;s anti-Catholic pamphlet &quot;The Catholic Poet: or, Protestant Barnaby&#x27;s Sorrowful Lamentation&quot;. Regardless of her peers&#x27; opinions, her plays continued to be performed for over 150 years after her death.

The diarist Agnes Porter, governess to the children of Henry Fox-Strangways, 2nd Earl of Ilchester, saw a performance of Centlivre&#x27;s &quot;The Busy Body&quot; at the Little Theatre, Haymarket on 7 March 1791, but wrote that it was &quot;very badly performed&quot;.

<text>Delfo Cabrera Gómez (April 2, 1919 – August 2, 1981) was an Argentine athlete, winner of the marathon race at the 1948 Summer Olympics in one of the most dramatic finishes in athletics history.

==Biography==
Born in Armstrong, Santa Fe Province, Delfo played football as a youth, but decided to turn to athletics after Juan Carlos Zabala&#x27;s triumph at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

He moved to Buenos Aires in 1938 and began training in San Lorenzo de Almagro under Francisco Mura. In the same year, he won his first national championships title (in 5000 m). Over the years he would win 9 more titles, but none of them in marathon.

Delfo served in the army during the World War II where he met Juan Perón. After the war, being a friend of Perón, he was active member of the Justicialist Party.

The London Olympic Games was Cabrera&#x27;s first major international competition. Etienne Gailly from Belgium dominated the marathon race most of the way and until almost the very last moments. He was the first to enter the stadium, but with 400 m to go, Gailly fell down, exhausted, got up and fell again. It was like Dorando Pietri&#x27;s dramatic finish 40 years before. Cabrera and Tom Richards of Great Britain managed to pass the staggering Gailly, Delfo winning 16.0 seconds ahead of Richards.

For 64 years, the victory remained the last Argentinian gold medal in an individual competition, until the victory of Sebastián Crismanich in taekwondo in the 2012 games.

Cabrera also participated in the 1952 Summer Olympics and was the flag bearer for Argentina at the opening ceremony; he finished in sixth place in the marathon, which was won by Emil Zátopek. Cabrera ended his athletics career after finishing sixth at the 1954 Boston Marathon. After that he taught physical education in several schools.

Delfo died in a car accident near the town of Alberti, Buenos Aires province, when driving back to Buenos Aires from a reception in his honour at Lincoln.

<doc id="883486" wikidata="Q3498549" url="?curid=883486" title="Stephen Fox">
<text>Sir Stephen Fox (27 March 1627 – 28 October 1716) of Farley in Wiltshire, of Redlynch Park in Somerset, of Chiswick, Middlesex and of Whitehall, was a royal administrator and courtier to King Charles II, and a politician, who rose from humble origins to become the &quot;richest commoner in the three kingdoms&quot;. He made the foundation of his wealth from his tenure of the newly created office of Paymaster-General of His Majesty&#x27;s Forces, which he held twice, in 1661–1676 and 1679–1680. He was the principal force of inspiration behind the founding of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, to which he contributed £13,000 ().

==Origins==
Stephen Fox was sixth but fourth surviving son of William Fox, of Farley, Wiltshire, a yeoman farmer, by his wife Elizabeth Pavey, a daughter of Thomas Pavy of Plaitford, Hampshire. His eldest surviving brother was John Fox (1611–1691), Clerk of the Acatry to King Charles II. Stephen&#x27;s sister was Jane Fox (1639–1710), who married Nicholas Johnson (died 1682), who was Paymaster-General of His Majesty&#x27;s Forces from 1680 to 1682, following Stephen Fox&#x27;s second shorter term in that office.

==Career==
Stephen was a Chorister of Salisbury Cathedral in Wiltshire ( – ) and was mentioned in John Evelyn&#x27;s Diary as &quot;a poore boy from the quire of Salisbury&quot;. His elder brother John Fox had obtained a position in the royal court on the recommendation of the Dean of Salisbury Cathedral, and first introduced his younger brother Stephen to the royal court, specifically to the household of the royal children, as &quot;supernumerary servant and play-fellow&quot;. At the age of fifteen Stephen obtained a post in the household of Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland; then he entered the service of Lord Percy, the earl&#x27;s younger brother, and was present with the royalist army at the Battle of Worcester as Lord Percy&#x27;s deputy at the ordnance board. Accompanying King Charles II in his flight to the continent, he was appointed manager of the royal household on the recommendation of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. Clarendon described him as &quot;a young man bred under the severe discipline of Lord Percy ... very well qualified with languages, and all other parts of clerkship, honesty and discretion&quot;.

The skill with which Fox managed the finances of the exiled court earned him further confidence and promotion. He was employed on several important missions, and acted eventually as intermediary between the king and General Monck. Honours and emolument were his reward after the Restoration of the monarchy; he was appointed to the lucrative offices of First Clerk of the Green Cloth and Paymaster of the Forces.

===Paymaster of the Forces===
Immediately on his Restoration, King Charles II struggled to fund the new standing army, a concept invented by Oliver Cromwell during the Civil War and the following Commonwealth. The problem was solved by Fox, who was deemed &quot;one of the financial wizards of his age&quot;, and from 1654 to 1660 had managed the finances of the exiled king with great success.

The king established a new office of Paymaster of the Forces, of which Fox was the first occupant, with premises in a wing of Horseguards in Whitehall. His success in restoring the financial position of the army stemmed from his ability to raise credit in the City of London, largely thanks to his reputation for honesty and reliability, which would later be repaid to him by the Treasury, when Parliament so voted. The yield from bills passed to this effect were often below that forecast, which in the absence of loans would leave the troops unpaid. Fox, however, was personally liable for the loans he raised, and to compensate him for the great risks he undertook, he was allowed to retain certain profits on his repayment by the Treasury. He charged the Treasury 6% on the funds he had borrowed, but much of that he repaid to his own creditors.

He was allowed other perquisites, including 2% bonus on capital and interest repaid to him by the Treasury, and &quot;poundage&quot; from 1667 which allowed him to retain 4 pence, and from 1668 one shilling, in every pound of army pay, ostensibly to cover administration costs, but in reality mostly profit. This therefore amounted to one twentieth of all army pay, an annual income for Fox of about £7,000, added to his official salary of £400 per annum, and whatever he could save from borrowing at rates below 6%. In just 20 months from January 1665 to September 1666 he advanced a total of £221,000 for army pay, on repayment of which he received interest from the Treasury of almost £13,000. In addition he received a further 2% bonus, worth another £3,000 and also poundage. This office he held for 15 years between 1661 and 1676, and for another year in 1679–1680.

===Political career===
In November 1661 he became a Member of Parliament for Salisbury. In 1665 he was knighted; was returned as a Member of Parliament for Westminster on 27 February 1679, and succeeded the Earl of Rochester as a Commissioner of the Treasury, filling that office for twenty-three years and during three reigns. In 1672 he bought the manor of Redlynch in Somerset, where he built a new house in 1708–1709.

In 1680 he resigned the paymastership and was made First Commissioner of Horse. In 1684 he became sole Commissioner of Horse. He was offered a peerage by King James II, on condition of converting to Roman Catholicism, but refused, in spite of which he was allowed to retain his commissionerships. In 1685 he was again an MP for Salisbury, and opposed the bill for a standing army supported by the king. During the Glorious Revolution, he maintained an attitude of decent reserve, but on James&#x27;s flight, he submitted to the new King William III, who confirmed him in his offices. He was again elected for Westminster in 1691 and 1695, for Cricklade in 1698, and finally in 1713 once more for Salisbury.

It is his distinction to have founded Royal Hospital Chelsea, to which he contributed £13,000. As a statesman he was second-rate, but as a public servant he creditably discharged all the duties with which he was entrusted. Unlike some other statesmen of his day, he grew rich in the service of the nation without being suspected of corruption or forfeiting the esteem of his contemporaries.

==Marriages and children==
Fox married twice:

*Firstly on 8 December 1651, at the age of 24, to Elizabeth Whittle (died 11 August 1696), a daughter of William Whittle of the City of London, whose mural monument with bust survives in the Ilchester Chapel of Farley Church. His niece Margaret Fox (buried on 22 June 1729), a daughter of his elder brother John, also married a member of the Whittle family. By Elizabeth Whittle he had seven sons, all of whom predeceased him, and three daughters, including:
**William Fox (1660–1680), eldest son, a captain in the army. A mural monument survives in the north cloister of Westminster Abbey inscribed in Latin and translated as follows: &quot;Near this place, among the ashes of their three brothers Edward, John and Stephen, sleep William and James Fox, sons of the Honorable Sir Stephen Fox, Kt. and Elizabeth his wife. Parents and sons worthy each other, whom love made one in life, one distemper in death and one grave in burial. Each of them was embellished with useful learning, which their modesty seemed to conceal, and in their youth the man grew up with them. They were born for their country and to honours, which the eldest, being Captain in the army, acquired by his fatigues over all England. William died April 17, 1680 aged 20. James died November 19, 1677 aged 13&quot;.
**Charles Fox (1660–1713), 2nd son, a Member of Parliament for Salisbury and Paymaster of the Forces to Kings James II, William III and to Queen Anne. His mural monument survives in the Ilchester Chapel of Farley Church.
**Edward Fox (1663–1669), 4th son, died aged six, buried with his brother John Fox in Westminster Abbey, where survives his gravestone in the cloisters inscribed: &quot;Here lie interred two Children of the right Worshipful Sir Stephen Fox of Farley in the County of Wilts Knight, viz. Edward Fox, his fourth Son, aged six years and one month, who died on the nineteenth day of Octob. 1669. and John Fox his sixth son of the age of one year, who deceased upon the seventeenth day of Novemb. in the year of our Lord 1667&quot;.
**James Fox (1665–1677), 5th son, died of smallpox on 19 November 1677 aged 12, buried in the cloister of Westminster Abbey, where survives his mural monument inscribed in Latin as follows: (&quot;Here below is situated, near the ashes of his three brothers Edward, John and Stephen, the most select youth James Fox, the fifth-born son of the Hon. Sir Stephen Fox, Knight, and of his wife Elizabeth, parents to son and son to parents most worthy... He was a man even while he was a child and an Hercules both in his cradle and at his death&quot;). 
**John Fox (1666–1667), 6th son, died aged one, as recorded on his gravestone in Westminster Abbey.
**Stephen Fox (died October 1675), died an infant, as recorded om his monument in Westminster Abbey.
**Elizabeth Fox (c. 1655 – 28 February 1681), born at Tunbridge Wells, who in Westminster Abbey on 27 December 1673 married Charles Cornwallis, 3rd Baron Cornwallis (1655 – 29 April 1698), of Brome Hall in Suffolk. Her great-grandson was General Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis. Her mural monument with relief-sculpted bust survives in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Brome.
**Jane Fox (died 10 June 1721), wife of George Compton, 4th Earl of Northampton.
**3rd daughter, died young.
*Secondly on 11 July 1703, aged 76, he married Christiana Hope (died 17 February 1718), a daughter of Rev. Francis Hope, Rector of Aswarby, Lincolnshire, by his wife Christian Palfreyman. On her husband&#x27;s monument in Farley Church are displayed (impaled by Fox) the arms of the Scottish Clan Hope: &quot;Azure, a chevron or between three bezants&quot;. By Christiana Hope he had two sons and two daughters, including:
**Stephen Fox-Strangways, 1st Earl of Ilchester (1704–1776), eldest son, of Redlynch Park in Somerset, created Baron Ilchester and Stavordale in 1747 and Earl of Ilchester in 1756. In 1758 he took the additional surname of Strangways and his descendants, the family of Fox-Strangways, still hold the Earldom of Ilchester. They also still hold part of the valuable central London &quot;Holland House estate&quot;, acquired by them on the extinction of the junior line of the Barons Holland.
**Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland (1705–1774), of Holland House in Kensington, who followed his father into politics. Father of the Whig statesman Charles James Fox.
**Charlotte Fox (died November 1778), wife of Hon. Edward Digby (died 1746), MP, of Wandsworth, 3rd son of William Digby, 5th Baron Digby.
**Christiana Fox (1705–1707), twin of Henry Fox, died an infant.

==Residences and estates==
Fox had the following residences and estates:
*Farley, Wiltshire, his paternal estate and burial place.
*The manor of Plaitford, Hampshire, purchased in 1679 from its lord, Richard Compton, which remained a possession of his descendants until 1911 when it was sold to its tenants by Giles Fox-Strangways, 6th Earl of Ilchester.
*Chiswick, Middlesex, to the west of London, where in 1682–1686, at a cost of £7,117 4s 3d, he built a house described in 1725 by Daniel Defoe as &quot;the flower of all the private gentlemens&#x27; palaces in England&quot;. Fox had purchased at first, in 1663, only two acres for £1,797 13s., on which stood a house having 18 hearths, which he demolished, next to the large Jacobean Chiswick House, then owned by the Duke of Monmouth, but which was later acquired by the 1st Earl of Burlington in 1682. In 1666 he purchased more adjoining land from the Duke of Monmouth for stables, and in 1685 he purchased the lease of the prebendal manor of Chiswick, comprising a further 140 acres. In 1726–1729 the old Jacobean Chiswick House was demolished and replaced by the famous Palladian villa of Chiswick House, built and designed by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington (1694–1753), where by coincidence died Fox&#x27;s famous grandson Charles James Fox in 1806. Fox&#x27;s architect was Hugh May, with a distinguished team of craftsmen including Antonio Verrio and Grinling Gibbons. Fox&#x27;s house was purchased and demolished in about 1812 by the Duke of Devonshire, then the owner of Chiswick House, but the walled gardens survive as part of Chiswick House grounds. The gardens were much admired by King William III as recorded by Daniel Defoe, who wrote as follows regarding &quot;Sir Stephen Fox&#x27;s gardens at Istleworth&quot; (i.e. Chiswick):

:After Fox&#x27;s death in 1716 it was sold to the Countess of Northampton, the mother-in-law of Fox&#x27;s daughter Jane. It was later re-named Moreton Hall after a later 18th-century owner.
*Redlynch, Somerset, an estate Fox acquired in 1672 in settlement of a debt due from the Gorges family. In 1688 he commenced repairs to the large 16th-century house then standing. In 1708/9 he commenced building a new house adjacent to the old one, to the designs of the architect Thomas Fort, and also developed the formal gardens. 
*Palace of Whitehall, Westminster, where before 1677 he rebuilt his lodgings at his own expense.

==Other building works==
Fox constructed further buildings including:

*All Saints Church, Farley, 1688–1690, to the design of Sir Christopher Wren, probably with Alexander Fort, Joiner to His Majesty&#x27;s Office of Works. He obtained a private act of Parliament to make it into a parish church, as it replaced a mere chapel of ease to the adjoining parish of Alderbury.
*Fox&#x27;s Hospital, Farley, an almshouse with schoolroom, 1688–1690, by Alexander Fort, Joiner to His Majesty&#x27;s Office of Works. Total cost £1835.8s.8d. Established for six poor women, with a master, and a free-school, the master to be a clergyman, and to officiate in the church. Continues to operate as a charity. A stone tablet below a broken pediment containing a bust of a winged putto, affixed to the external wall above the central doorway, is inscribed in Latin as follows
::&quot;Deo Opt(imo) Max(imo) bonarum omnium largitori isthoc quantulumcumque grati animi monumentum acceptum refert scholae huius et ptochotrophii fundator humilis gratabundus Anno Salutis reparatae MDCLXXXI quid tibi divitiae prosunt quas congeris hospes solas quas dederis semper habebis opes&quot;.

:(&quot;To God, most good, most great, liberal giver of all (things) good, of a thankful soul the humble and fully-grateful founder gives back what is received this how unimportant monument of this school and place for maintaining the poor restored in the Year of Salvation 1681. For what are riches useful to you, you will bring together a guest/stranger, what thou hast given alone shall be eternal riches unto thee&quot; (last sentence from Epigrams of Martial, XLII (&quot;solas quas dederis semper habebis opes&quot;))
*A contribution of £13,000 towards the building of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, designed by Sir Christopher Wren.
*In 1698, Fox built Manor Farm House in Chiswick, to replace the previous manor house on Chiswick Mall (which is shown on a map in Warwick Draper&#x27;s book). It was southeast of Chiswick House, roughly where Edensor Gardens are today. The map names it &quot;Sir Stephen Fox’s 1st house&quot;. Fox was the lord of Chiswick&#x27;s prebendal manor at the time. The house survived until 1896 when it was demolished to build Wilton Avenue. Some of the wall of the farm exists today as garden walls in Manor Alley. Almost next door to it on the Sulhamstead Estate is a modern block of flats called Stephen Fox House.

==Death and burial==
Fox died on 28 October 1716, aged 89, at his house in Chiswick. He was buried in the Church he rebuilt at Farley, where survives his mural monument. He left assets with an estimated value of over £174,000. (equivalent to over £ in ).

<doc id="883488" wikidata="Q7183576" url="?curid=883488" title="Philip Fruytiers">
<text>Philip Fruytiers (1610–1666) was a Flemish Baroque painter and engraver. Until the 1960s, he was especially known for his miniature portraits in watercolor and gouache. Since then, several large canvases signed with the monogram PHF have been ascribed to him. These new findings have led to a renewed appreciation for his contribution to the Antwerp Baroque.

==Life==
Details about his life are scarce. He was born in Antwerp on 10 January 1610 as the son of Jan Fruytiers and Catherina Vervloet. He is listed as a pupil at the Jesuit college in Antwerp in 1627. He contributed texts in Latin, French and Dutch to an emblem book published in 1627 by that college at the Joannes Cnobbaert imprint in Antwerp under the title &quot;Typus mundi in quo ejus calamitates et pericula nec non divini, humanique amoris antipathia, emblematice proponuntur&quot;. The illustrations of this publication were made by Philips van Mallery.

No information about his artistic training is available. He became a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in the guild year 1631–32. He is described in the register of the Guild as an illuminator, painter and engraver.

Between September 1630 and 18 October 1665 he was very active in the &#x27;Sodaliteit van de Bejaerde Jongmans&#x27;, a fraternity for bachelors established by the Jesuit order.

He was the teacher of Ambrosius Gast (II), Gualterus Gysaerts, Franciscus Fruytiers, Adrian Cockx (1649–50), Wauter Gyssels (1662–63) and Gregoris de Vos (1663–64).

He died in Antwerp on 19 June 1666 and was buried on 21 June.

==Work==
Philip Fruytiers was until the middle of the 20th century mainly known as a miniature painter and portraitist who worked in watercolor and gouache. A portrait of a &quot;Family on a Terrace&quot; signed and dated 1638 (Cambi auction in Genoa of 30 June 2020 lot 114) shows a family in an outdoor setting with an artist drawing in a sketchbook. This may be a self-portrait of Fruytiers. His most famous miniature depicts Rubens&#x27; four children, his second wife Helena Fourment and two servants date 1638 (Royal Collection, Windsor Castle). This miniature is probably the portrait listed in the inventory of the estate of Rubens in 1641 and on which at that time the price of the frame and glass was still outstanding. Fruytiers also painted large portraits like that of David Teniers the Younger and group or family portraits such as that of the three children of Rubens.
The accepted view of Philip Fruytiers as principally a miniaturist and watercolorist was based partially on the descriptions in the early biographical works by Cornelis de Bie and Arnold Houbraken.

Although Cornelis de Bie mentioned that Fruytiers also painted altarpieces, the only known works by his hand until the 1960s were works on paper or vellum. As a result, the established view about the nature of his work was not challenged. In the 1960s this view had to be revised, however, when three large paintings of saints dated 1652 with the monogram &quot;PHF&quot; (in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp), which were previously attributed to a hypothetical painter PH Franck, were identified as being by the hand of Fruytiers. The same signature was subsequently discovered on another altarpiece in the parish church in Zundert, North Brabant, which had been purchased from the inventory of the dissolved Antwerp St Michael&#x27;s Abbey in 1802. This led to the attribution to Fruytiers of other paintings in collections of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels, the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp and the Museo del Prado in Madrid, and in the parish church of Gistel, West Flanders. Drawings for some of his altarpieces are kept in the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp, the Yale University Art Gallery and the Kupferstichkabinett Berlin.
Fruytiers&#x27; style is generally much closer to the refinement and delicacy of Anthony van Dyck than to the more monumental art of Rubens. 

An expressive portrait drawing of the Jesuit Jan de Tollenaere (Johannes Tollenarius) (Morgan Library &amp; Museum) was a study for an engraving made by Jacob Neefs.

Fruytiers was an accomplished engraver and produced several portrait etchings such as those of the Capuchin Innocentius de Caltagirone and the Flemish mathematician and astronomer Govaert Wendelen. He made designs for the frontispiece and illustrations for devotional books and other religious prints by Antwerp engravers such as Cornelis Galle the Younger and Conraad Lauwers. One of his outstanding designs of a frontispiece is that for the &quot;Imago primi saeculi Societatis Iesu a Provincia Flandro-Belgica eiusdem Societatis repraesentata&quot;, a book written by Jean Bolland and Godfrey Henschen was printed by Balthasar I Moretus at the Plantin Moretus press in Antwerp in 1640. The design which was engraved by Cornelis Galle the Elder.

<text>Mona Lisa Smile is a 2003 American drama film produced by Revolution Studios and Columbia Pictures in association with Red Om Films Productions, directed by Mike Newell, written by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal, and starring Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The title is a reference to the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, and to the song of the same name, originally performed by Nat King Cole, which was covered by Seal for the film. Julia Roberts received a record $25 million for her performance, the highest ever earned by an actress at that time.

==Plot==
In 1953, 30-year-old Katherine Ann Watson accepts an Art History teaching position at Wellesley College. She quickly discovers her students have memorized the entire textbook and syllabus, so she introduces modern art and encourages discussion about what art is. Katherine also challenges her students to achieve more in life than marriage.

Outspoken conservative Betty Warren writes editorials for the college paper, and insists that a universal standard exists for what is good art. She attacks Katherine for advocating that women seek careers in addition to marriage and exposes campus nurse and lesbian Amanda Armstrong for supplying contraception to students, resulting in her termination.

Betty is eager to marry her fiancé Spencer and expects the traditional married-student exemptions; however, Katherine insists she will grade her based on merit and expects her to complete all assignments and tests. When Betty&#x27;s married life does not go smoothly, she begins taking out her frustrations on the other girls, particularly Connie and Giselle.

Betty often ridicules Connie Baker and insists her cousin, Charlie, is taking Connie to her wedding reception only as a favor. Connie is surprised when he expresses genuine interest in her, and they begin dating. Connie breaks things off after Betty claims Charlie is actually dating Deb, the daughter of the couple Charlie had avoided while they were on holiday. Betty claims Connie is just a casual fling Charlie was trying to hide.

Weeks later, Connie and Charlie reconnect with him insisting he had stopped seeing Deb the previous summer and only began dating his current girlfriend after Connie stopped seeing him. Connie tearfully confronts Betty for lying and being hurtful, asking why Betty could not let her be happy. Later, Connie breaks into Charlie&#x27;s dorm to ask for another chance, and they rekindle their relationship.

Joan Brandwyn considers studying law at Yale Law School, so Katherine encourages her to apply. Although accepted, Joan declines admission to instead elope with Tom Donegal. When Joan tells Katherine it is what she truly wants, Katherine offers congratulations and wishes her happiness.

Giselle Levy is liberal about sex and has had several lovers, including Wellesley Italian professor, Bill Dunbar. She moves on from him when he and Katherine begin dating. Giselle admires Katherine for encouraging students&#x27; independence. She earns Betty&#x27;s enmity as her marriage falls apart.

Katherine&#x27;s California boyfriend Paul unexpectedly visits and proposes, but Katherine declines and they break up. She begins dating Bill Dunbar, who often recounts stories about his war service in Italy. Bill has had affairs with students, including Giselle, so Katherine insists he stop. Upon learning Bill never served in Italy and was only stationed at the Army Languages Center on Long Island, Katherine ends the relationship.

Betty&#x27;s marriage falls apart after Spencer has an affair. Betty leaves him but her mother demands she forgive him. She confronts Giselle in her dorm, at first attacking her for being promiscuous, then breaking down. Giselle is the only student who knows about Spencer&#x27;s infidelity and comforts Betty.

Betty regrets maligning Katherine in her editorials. Eventually, Betty files for divorce, and she and Giselle plan to find an apartment in Greenwich Village. When Betty’s mother confronts her at graduation, Betty chastises her and credits Katherine as being the only one who supported her, vowing to live her own life.

Despite disapproving of Katherine&#x27;s progressive teaching methods, Wellesley administrators invite her to return the following year as her course is extremely popular, but only under strict conditions. Katherine refuses and resigns. Betty dedicates her last editorial to her, admiring her for living by example and challenging them to see the world through new eyes. As Katherine leaves in a taxi, the students follow on their bikes to say goodbye.

==Box office==
In its first weekend, &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; opened at number two at the U.S. box office, earning US$11,528,498 behind &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. By the end of its run, while the film had grossed a respectable $141,337,989 worldwide, its U.S. domestic gross did not meet its $65 million budget, falling short at $63,860,942.

==Reception==
&quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; received mixed to negative reviews from film critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 33% approval rating based on 150 reviews, with an average score of and a consensus: &quot;Though &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; espouses the value of breaking barriers, the movie itself is predictable.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In a typical review, Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote, &quot;it&#x27;s &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; as a chick flick, without the compelling drama and inspiration... even Roberts doesn&#x27;t seem convinced. She gives a rather blah performance as if she&#x27;s not fully committed to the role... Rather than being a fascinating exploration of a much more constrained time in our social history, the film simply feels anachronistic. The film deserves a solid &#x27;C&#x27; for mediocrity and muted appeal.&quot; Critic Elizabeth M. Tamny of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; shared this negative assessment, writing &quot;Part of the problem is simply that &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; is a Hollywood film, and Hollywood isn&#x27;t good at depicting the life of the mind... And Julia Roberts is no help--you either like her or you don&#x27;t, but either way it has little to do with talent. She&#x27;s not so much an actor as a vessel for earnest reactions. The fact is... It&#x27;s easier to take on an extremely black-and-white version of the most salient question from this film - can women bake their cake and eat it too? - than try to answer it in the present.&quot;

David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote, &quot;What drew the usually astute Mike Newell (&#x27;&quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;&quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;&#x27;) to this project? There are hints that the script (credited to Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner) may once have had more shadings - a suggestion that Katherine&#x27;s idealism is a form of power-tripping; that she&#x27;s afraid of intimacy - but any ambiguity is quickly brushed aside to make way for the Julia lovefest. Newell, no hack, tries not to milk the cliches shamelessly, and that may be the movie&#x27;s final undoing. Lacking the courage of its own vulgarity, &quot;&#x27;Mona Lisa Smile&quot;&#x27; is as tepid as old bathwater.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
==Reaction from Wellesley and Wellesley alumnae==
The college issued an official statement explaining their decision to allow the film to shoot on campus.

In a message to Wellesley alumnae concerning the film, Wellesley College president Diana Chapman Walsh expressed regret about some of the reactions it generated, as many alumnae from the 1950s felt that the film&#x27;s portrayal of Wellesley was inaccurate.

<text>M-Squadron, formerly the &quot;Unit Interventie Mariniers&quot; (Marine Intervention Unit, UIM), and before that known as the &quot;Bijzondere Bijstandseenheid&quot; (Special Support Unit, BBE), is an elite Dutch special forces unit which is tasked with conducting domestic counter-terrorist operations. M-Squadron is part of the Netherlands Maritime Special Operations Forces of the Netherlands Marine Corps.

==History==
On 22 February 1973, the Dutch government officially created a specialist counter-terrorism unit in response to the Munich massacre, when 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by Palestine pro-Fatah militants. The government felt the urge of protecting the nation against such incidents in the future, and so members of the Dutch Marine Corps were selected for this special unit. Marines were chosen because, at that time, they were particularly notorious: Dutch marines are hardened, highly trained, professional soldiers. 

On July 1, 2006, a new government organ, &quot;Dienst Speciale Interventies&quot; (DSI) was founded. This is a joint operations centre for counter-terrorism actions in the Netherlands. Members of the UIM and special police units work together, and form a &quot;Unit Interventie&quot;, which is a joint task force of Defence and police personnel.

As part of the reorganization, the BBE changed its name in 2006 to the UIM. In 2009, the UIM changed its name once again to M-Squadron.

The unit was reorganized into the Maritime Special Operations Force since January 1, 2009.

==Role==
It consists of a selection of specially trained marines of the Dutch Marine Corps, and it is part of the Netherlands Maritime Special Operations Forces (NLMARSOF), which is the maritime counterpart of the Dutch Army&#x27;s &quot;Korps Commandotroepen&quot;. NLMARSOF is able to operate in and outside of the Netherlands, with emphasis on maritime special operations. 

It currently consists of two operational SOF squadrons, one training squadron and a support group;
* C Squadron (Mountain Leader Recon and Amphibian Recon) – Foreign operations
* M Squadron (Counter-Terrorism) – Domestic operations
* T Squadron (Training Squadron)
* Special Operation Forces Support Group

M-Squadron consists of teams of six operators, each team and each operator with their own specialty. Among those are diver and breach teams. Tasks are:
*To conduct special operations on sea and land;
*To conduct quick-reaction counter-terrorism and hostage release operations in the Netherlands;
*To provide quick-reaction maritime intervention (harbours, oil platforms, ships, etc.);
*To assist the Dutch police and Royal Marechaussee in domestic joint law enforcement and counter-terrorism operations;
*To act as a security detachment on board Royal Netherlands Navy ships during humanitarian or peace-enforcing/-keeping missions;

===Within DSI===
The &quot;Dienst Speciale Interventies&quot; is the joint operations centre for domestic CT operations, and it combines special units from the Ministries of Defence and Justice. These units are:
*Unit Arrest Teams: regional SWAT teams of the National Police Corps.
*Unit Intervention: rapidly deployable counter-terrorist unit consisting of both military and law enforcement personnel.
*Unit Expertise and Operational Support: support unit providing sniper fire support, crisis negotiation and technical support.

==Operations==
The UIM has seen a lot of action since its creation. The first real intervention mission was the recapture of the Scheveningen prison in October 1974. Operators used hand-to-hand combat and stun grenades against jailed terrorists, who had revolted and held the prison under siege.

The best-known intervention mission was ending the combined siege of a train and a primary school, which was done by South Moluccan terrorists. The UIM managed to kill the six captors on the train during a short but precise raid. Two hostages did not survive this. The raid was successful due to the fact that the Royal Netherlands Air Force was called in, with six F-104 Starfighter aircraft making very low flypast manoeuvres in full afterburn. This was mainly a distraction, allowing for a swift raid and the killing of the six captors on board. The siege at the primary school ended not long after the train siege had ended.

On 13 March 1978, the UIM responded to a province hall hostage crisis in Assen. The raid came just in time: the hijackers had almost executed two people.

The UIM was meant to be deployed to enforce arms embargoes in the Balkans, but they were never deployed in the 1990s.

A known operation of the UIM was on 10 November 2004 in The Hague. The police had tried to arrest Ismail A. and Jason W. (members of the Hofstad Network) in a house at the Laakkwartier, but failed, as three police officers had been injured by grenades thrown at them by the terrorists. UIM operators were ordered to secure and maintain the site. After a successful raid, the two young terrorists were arrested.

The unit has been deployed to Afghanistan under Task Force 55 with KCT operators.

In 2008, the UIM had been active in the seas near Somalia as a security detachment for the Royal Netherlands Navy frigate Hr. Ms. De Ruyter, that was tasked with the escort of cargo ships that were contracted by the United Nations&#x27; World Food Programme. The unit was deployed several times to fight off pirates that attempted to raid the ships, and some teams were stationed on some of the ships as well.

In April 2010, an UIM-team embarked on board Hr. Ms. Tromp re-captured the German container ship MS Taipan off the coast of Somalia, that was under the control of Somali pirates. Though multiple shots were fired, including a machine gun barrage on the ship&#x27;s bridge, the only injury was an operator that was slightly injured when he fell while storming the ship. A video released by the Royal Netherlands Navy, shows helmet camera footage of the Marines storming and re-taking the ship.

<text>The Stanton Drew stone circles are just outside the village of Stanton Drew in the English county of Somerset. The largest stone circle is the Great Circle, in diameter and the second largest stone circle in Britain (after Avebury); it is considered to be one of the largest Neolithic monuments to have been built. The date of construction is not known, but is thought to be between 3000 and 2000 BCE, which places it in the Late Neolithic
to Early Bronze Age. It was made a scheduled monument in 1982.

The Great Circle was surrounded by a ditch and is accompanied by smaller stone circles to the northeast and southwest. There is also a group of three stones, known as The Cove, in the garden of the local pub. Slightly further from the Great Circle is a single stone, known as Hautville&#x27;s Quoit. Some of the stones are still vertical, but the majority are now recumbent, and some are no longer present.

The stone circles have been studied since John Aubrey&#x27;s visit in 1664, and some excavations of the site were performed in the 18th century. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, geophysical surveys have confirmed the size of the stone circles and identified additional pits and postholes. The Cove has been shown to be around 1000 years older than the stone circles, and so date from 4000–3000 BCE. A variety of myths and legends about the stone circles have been recorded, including one about dancers at a celebration who have been turned to stone.

== Monument ==
The most famous feature is the Great Circle, the second largest stone circle in Britain (after Avebury). The stone circle is in diameter and probably consisted of 30 stones, of which 27 survive today. It was recorded by both John Aubrey in 1664 and William Stukeley in 1723. The Great Circle probably was surrounded by the ditch (approximately outer diameter — now filled in) of a henge. The North East Circle is in diameter and probably consisted of 10 or more stones, of which 8 survive today. The South West Circle is in diameter, and has 12 stones surviving today. An avenue extends to the northeast of the Great Circle towards the River Chew and a second avenue meets it from the north eastern stone circle.

A (now recumbent) standing stone called Hautville&#x27;s Quoit lies across the river to the north on an alignment with the centres of the Great Circle and the southern circle. It is a large stone close to Hautville Quoit Farm, recumbent since at least the mid 17th century but assumed to have originally been upright. Described by Stukeley in 1723 as being long, it is now about half that length, Leslie Grinsell suggesting that fragments have occasionally been broken off for mending the roads. Stukeley also referred to the presence of a second stone.
Further to the west is a cove of two standing stones with a recumbent slab between them, which can be found in the garden of the Druid&#x27;s Arms public house. All are of different heights, the stone to the north east being the south western , and the north eastern . The stones of The Cove are mineralogically different from those in the nearby stone circles. A long barrow burial chamber has been found under the stones of The Cove. It is thought that this predates the erection of the stones by approximately a thousand years.

== Excavations ==

In 1740 the site was surveyed and mapped by architect, freemason and antiquarian John Wood, the Elder, who noted the different stones used. He suggested the layout was based on the Pythagorean planetary system, and thought it was used as the Druid&#x27;s &quot;University&quot;. The number and positioning of the stones according to Wood, corresponded to the Pythagorean planetary system of worlds, with three of the circles corresponding to the solar, lunar and Earth cycles. This deeply influenced his plans for a circle of 30 houses called The Circus in Bath, an ambitious architectural project completed by his son John Wood, the Younger.

When one of the stones fell in the mid 17th century, some human bones were discovered accompanied by an object described as a &quot;round bell, like a large horse-bell&quot;. The burial date and the purpose of the bell-like object are unknown.

== Geophysical survey ==
Geophysical work by English Heritage in 1997 revealed a surrounding ditch and nine concentric rings of postholes within the stone circle. More than four hundred pits, across and at intervals, stood in rings at the site. The ditch is in diameter and about wide. A wide entrance was visible on the north east side. No surrounding bank has been identified although the site awaits excavation.

The geophysical work transformed the traditional view of Stanton Drew as being a surface monument and the Great Circle is now seen as being one of the largest and most impressive Neolithic monuments to have been built. Analogous with the circles of postholes at sites at Woodhenge, Durrington Walls and The Sanctuary, it is thought that the pits would have held posts which would have either been freestanding or lintelled as they could not have supported a roof at that size. The postholes in nine concentric rings held posts up to in diameter indicating the use of ancient trees which were sacred to the druids.

Nearby and to the north east is a smaller ring of eight stones in the centre of which the geophysical work identified four further pits. A third ring of twelve stones, measuring wide, stands to the south west.

A fluxgate gradiometer survey in July 2009 investigated standing stones in the garden of the Druids Arms public house known as The Cove, which showed that the stones date from nearly a thousand years before the stone circles. The conclusion from the study was that these upright stones are likely to have been the portals or façade of a chambered tomb.

In 2010 a further survey was carried out by Bath and Camerton Archaeological Society and the Bath and North East Somerset Archaeological Officer. This involved high data density magnetometer, resistance pseudosection profiles and photographic surveys showed a new henge entrance and further detail of post holes.

== Myths about Stanton Drew ==

Being a henge and stone circle site, astronomical alignments are a common theory to explain the positioning of the stones at Stanton Drew. Similarly, there are less well evidenced theories relating to ley lines.

One theory suggests the site was dedicated to funerary ritual. As a sacred site this is to be expected, but also then to be host to other significant events of the local community such as weddings and religious ceremonies. 
There are several local traditional stories about the megalithic complex. The best known tells how a wedding party was turned to stone: the party was held throughout Saturday, but a man clothed in black (the Devil in disguise) came and started to play his violin for the merrymakers after midnight, continuing into holy Sunday morning. When dawn broke, everybody had been turned to stone by the Demon: so the stone circles are the dancers, the avenues are the fiddlers and The Cove is the bride and the groom with the drunken churchman at their feet. They are still awaiting the Devil who promised to come back someday and play again for them.

Wade and Wade in their 1929 book &quot;Somerset&quot; suggest:

One of the curiosities of the place is Hautville&#x27;s Quoit, which, to save time, should also be looked for on approaching the village. (Enter iron gate on L. a few hundred yards before reaching tollhouse, and search backwards along the hedge bordering road.) It is a large stone, which legend says was hurled by Sir J. Hautville (whose effigy is in Chew Magna Church) from the top of Maes Knoll. The famous &quot;druidical remains&quot; will be found near the church. About 50 yards from the entrance to the churchyard take a lane to the L. leading to an orchard: the stones will be observed in the field beyond (admission free, but field closed on Sundays). The &quot;remains&quot; consist of three contiguous circles. The first is of considerable area, and is marked out by twelve large stones, only three of which remain upright; a smaller circle of eight stones lies just beyond; and a third circle of eight will be found farther away in an orchard on the R. The two larger circles have each a few scattered stones thrown off as a kind of avenue. Standing apart from the circles is a curious group of three stones huddled together in a garden abutting on the churchyard, from which they can be easily seen by looking over the W. boundary wall. These mystic rings probably had the same origin (whatever that may have been) as that of the more famous circle at Avebury in Wiltshire, with which they should be compared. The proximity of Maes Knoll is comparable with that of Silbury Hill. A ridiculous theory suggests that the monoliths were erected as a trophy after one of Arthur&#x27;s victories. Arthur is connected to the site because a site in the nearby village of Camerley is reputed to be the location of Camelot in an oral tradition. The stones are of a reddish hue similar to that described in the Arthurian legend as connected to Camelot and to a sword that was seen in a stone near to Camelot. The country story is that a local wedding once took place on a Sunday, when the frivolous guests would insist on winding up with a dance. The penalty for a &quot;Sabbath&quot; thus &quot;profaned&quot; was the prompt transformation of the bridal party into stone. Hence the local appellation of &quot;The fiddlers and the maids&quot;.

<text>East End Park, currently named KDM Group East End Park for sponsorship purposes, is a football stadium situated in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland with a seating capacity of .

The stadium plays host to the home matches of side, Dunfermline Athletic The stadium currently comprises four stands: the East Stand (currently sponsored by SQMC), the Main Stand (currently sponsored by srj windows), the North Stand and the Norrie McCathie Stand. The stadium is all seater and has under-soil heating.

==History==

East End Park was first used in 1885, the same year as the club was formed. The original stadium was situated slightly to the west. In 1920, the Board of Directors purchased of land from the North British Railway company for £3,500, and the present position of the ground was laid out. A wooden stand with a low roof and a pavilion were built on the southern side, backing onto Halbeath Road (A907). Terrace banks were extended to give a capacity of 16,000 when the club was promoted to the First Division in 1926. Relegation and the effects of the Great Depression forced East End Park to be used for greyhound racing in the early 1930s. The rent from this activity helped keep the club afloat, but the dog track cut across the corners of the pitch. Dunfermline were promoted in 1934 and a roof was built over the northern terrace. One year later, the eastern terrace was improved using wood salvaged from the liner &quot;Mauretania&quot;, which was being broken up in the Rosyth Dockyards. 

Polish and British army units were stationed at East End Park during the Second World War. Dunfermline received £329 in compensation, but the ground remained quite primitive. Crush barriers were not installed until 1951, after a 20,000 crowd had attended a match. East End Park was greatly developed between 1957 and 1970, a period in which the club qualified several times for European competition. A two-tier Main Stand was constructed in 1962, funded by the club winning the 1960–61 Scottish Cup. The terracing was also improved, with an L-shaped roof formed over the western and northern sections. The record attendance for a Dunfermline Athletic home game of 27,816 was against Celtic on 30 April 1968. There was some chaotic crowd scenes, as people scaled the stand roof and floodlight pylons to gain access. One person died from his injuries after falling.

In the late 1990s, East End Park was converted to an all-seater stadium with a capacity of 12,509. But since then, the capacity has been downgraded to the present 11,480. Since then there have been sell-outs against Rangers in the Scottish Cup and against Raith Rovers in a title decider for the 2010–11 Scottish First Division. An artificial playing surface was installed at East End Park in 2003, as part of an experiment by UEFA. Opposing managers and players expressed reservations at the time that the surface could lead to injuries. The pitch was subsequently replaced with grass two seasons later. The 2006–07 Scottish Junior Cup Final between Kelty Hearts and Linlithgow Rose was held at East End Park on 3 June 2007. Dunfermline announced in November 2011 that the North Stand was to close, in order to reduce operating costs. However, in July 2012 the club announced it planned to reopen the stand.

In August 2022, Dunfermline made a long-term business agreement with local business KDM Group, which included renaming the stadium KDM Group East End Park.

==Greyhound racing==
The greyhound racing was independent (unlicensed) and started on 5 June 1931 until 1951.

<text>Sebastiano Conca (Gaeta, 8 January 1680 – Naples, 1 September 1764) was an Italian painter.

==Biography==
He was born at Gaeta, then part of the Kingdom of Naples, and apprenticed in Naples under Francesco Solimena. In 1706, along with his brother Giovanni, who acted as his assistant, he settled in Rome, where for several years he worked only in chalk, to improve his drawing. He was patronized by the Cardinal Ottoboni, who introduced him to Clement XI, who commissioned him a well-received &quot;Jeremiah&quot; painted for the church of St. John Lateran. 
He also painted an &quot;Assunta&quot; for the church of Santi Luca e Martina in Rome.

Conca was knighted by the pope. He collaborated with Carlo Maratta in the &quot;Coronation of Santa Cecilia&quot; (1721–24) in the namesake church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. In 1718 he was elected to the Accademia di San Luca, and was its director in 1729–1731, replacing Camillo Rusconi as &quot;Principe&quot; in 1732. He was also elected Principe in 1739–1741.

His painting was strongly influenced by the Baroque painter Luca Giordano. Among Conca&#x27;s pupils there were Pompeo Battoni, Andrea Casali, Placido Campoli, Corrado Giaquinto, Gregorio Giusti, Gaetano Lapis, Salvatore Monosilio, Litterio Paladini, Francesco Preziao, Rosalba Maria Salvioni, Gasparo Serenari, Agostino Masucci, Domenico Giomi, and the Bavarian religious painter Franz Georg Hermann. Sebastiano&#x27;s brother, Giovanni Conca (died in 1764), painted the main altarpiece of the &quot;Madonna of the Rosary and St Dominic&quot; for the church of San Domenico, Urbino.

He received widespread official acclaim and patronage. He worked for a period of time for the Savoy family in Turin on the Oratory of San Filippo and Santa Teresa, in the Venaria (1721–1725), for Basilica di Superga (1726), and Royal Palace (1733). He painted the frescoes of &quot;Probatica&quot; (Pool of Siloam), in the Ospedale di Santa Maria della Scala (hospital) of Siena. In Genoa, he painted the large allegorical canvases of the Palazzo Lomellini-Doria (1738–1740).

In 1739, he published a guide to painting: &quot;Ammonimenti&quot; (or Admonishments), which blended moralistic advice with technique. He returned to Naples in 1752, and enjoyed the royal patronage of Charles III. His studio was prodigious and he painted frescoes for the Church of Santa Chiara (1752–1754), five canvases for the Chapel in Caserta Palace (now lost), as well as many others including for the Benedictines of Aversa (1761), a &quot;History of Saint Francis of Paola&quot; for the Sanctuary of Saint Maria di Pozzano of Castellammare di Stabia (1762–1763), and many other altarpieces. He painted till late in life.

Among the works that reflect his late-Baroque style there are paintings such as &quot;The Vision of Aeneas in the Elysian Fields&quot; (c. 1735/1740); the scene is crowded with mythologic and classical figures, adrift in academic quotation, and enveloped by a world of overwrought with allegory. Dancing or flying putti proliferate. The landscape is often a billowing cloud.

Even in a more intimate scene such as &quot;Rinaldo &amp; Armida&quot;, instead of depicting the focused scene between two lovers, love itself has to be allegorized as an intruding, hovering cupid. Similarly, the somber introspection of the moment recounted by &quot;Christ at the Garden of Gesthmane&quot; is afflicted with a cascade of angels. It is a mannerist Baroque, not its distilled apotheosis, but a distanced elaboration from its roots in Carracci and Cortona.

<text>The &#x27; (also known as or &quot;Sd.Kfz. 166&quot;) is a German armoured infantry support gun based on the Panzer IV chassis used in the Second World War. It was used at the Battles of Kursk, Anzio, Normandy, and was deployed in the Warsaw Uprising. It was known by the nickname &#x27; (German: &quot;Grouch&quot;) by Allied intelligence, a name which was not used by the Germans. German soldiers nicknamed it the &quot;&quot;, a contraction of the term . Just over 300 vehicles were built and they were assigned to four independent battalions.

==Development==
The was a development of the Panzer IV tank designed to provide a vehicle offering direct infantry fire support, especially in urban areas. It used a Panzer IV chassis with the upper hull and turret replaced by a new casemate-style armoured superstructure housing a new gun, the (StuH) 43 L/12 developed by Skoda. It fired the same shells as the 15 cm sIG 33 heavy infantry gun. Thirty-eight rounds, with separate propellant cartridges, could be carried. It used the &quot;Sfl.Zf. 1a&quot; sight. The combined weight of the shell and cartridge ( for an HE shell and for a propellant cartridge) made the work of the loader arduous, especially if the gun was elevated to a high angle.

An MG 34 machine gun was carried that could be fastened to the open gunner&#x27;s hatch, much like the arrangement on the Sturmgeschütz III Ausf. G. Early vehicles carried an MP 40 sub-machine gun inside, which could be fired through firing ports in the side of the superstructure.

The driver&#x27;s station projected forward from the casemate&#x27;s sloped frontal armour plate and used the Tiger I&#x27;s driver&#x27;s sight. The fighting compartment was, albeit poorly, ventilated by natural convection, exiting out the rear of the superstructure through two armoured covers. Sideskirts were fitted on all vehicles.

Early vehicles were too heavy for the chassis, which led to frequent breakdowns of the suspension and transmission. Efforts were made to ameliorate this from the second series onwards, with some success.

In October 1943, it was decided that the StuH 43 gun needed to be redesigned to reduce its weight. A new version, some lighter than the StuH 43, was built as the StuH 43/1. Some of the weight was saved by reducing the armour on the gun mount itself. This gun was used from the third production series onwards.

Zimmerit coating was applied to all vehicles until September 1944.

==Production series==
=== First ===
Production of the first series of 60 vehicles began in April 1943. Fifty-two of these were built using new Panzer IV Ausf. G chassis and the remaining 8 from rebuilt Ausf. E and F chassis. Survivors, about half, were rebuilt beginning in December 1943; they were mostly rebuilt to 2nd series standards.

=== Second ===
Production restarted in December 1943 with another 60 vehicles, using only new Ausf. H chassis, and continued until March 1944. The baptism in combat at the Battle of Kursk proved that the driver&#x27;s compartment was too lightly armoured and it was reinforced. The gunner&#x27;s hatch was removed and a ventilator fan was fitted, much to the relief of the crew. Internally sprung, steel-rimmed road wheels replaced the front two rubber-rimmed road wheels in an effort to reduce the stress on the forward suspension that was only partially successful.

=== Third ===
Production of the third series ran from March to June 1944 with few changes from the second series. The Fahrersehklappe 80 was replaced by periscopes and the lighter StuH 43/1 was used.

=== Fourth ===
The superstructure was redesigned in early 1944 for the fourth series, which used the chassis and HL120 TRM112 engine of the Ausf. J, and was in production between June 1944 and March 1945. It featured a redesigned gun collar, as well as a general reduction in height of the superstructure. This redesign also introduced a ball mount in the front superstructure for a MG 34 machine gun with 600 rounds. The vehicle commander&#x27;s position was modified to use the cupola of the III Ausf. G, which could mount a machine gun for anti-aircraft defense.

==Combat history==


The first unit to take the into battle was . It was formed at the end of April 1943 and transferred in early May to Amiens to train on its new assault guns. It was organized into 3 line companies, each with 14 vehicles, and a battalion headquarters with 3 vehicles. It arrived in Central Russia on 10 June 1943 to prepare for  (Operation Citadel), the German attack on the Kursk salient. For this action, it was temporarily assigned as the third battalion of (&quot;Heavy Anti-tank Regiment 656&quot;) under the command of the 9th Army of Army Group Center.

It remained in the Orel-Bryansk area until its transfer to the Dnepropetrovsk-Zaporozhe area at the end of August. Its vehicles were refitted there and it remained there until the Zaporozhe Bridgehead was abandoned on 15 October. The battalion retreated to Nikopol, where it helped defend the German salient there until it was withdrawn back to the Reich at the end of December.

The Allied landing at Anzio on 22 January 1944 caused the battalion, fully independent once more, to be transferred there in early February with 28 vehicles to participate in the planned counterattack against the Allied beachhead, Operation Fischfang. This failed in its objective, but the battalion remained in Italy for the rest of the war. The battalion still had 42 vehicles on hand when the Allies launched their Po Valley offensive in April 1945, but all were blown up to prevent capture, or lost during the retreat, before the war ended in May.
 was formed on 20 April 1944 at the Grafenwöhr Training Area from cadres provided by and , although it did not have any armoured fighting vehicles until 19 were delivered at the end of May. It departed 1/2 July for the Normandy Front. It had to detrain in Condé sur Noireau, some behind the front lines, because the Allies had heavily damaged the French rail network. Many of the battalion&#x27;s vehicles broke down during the road march to the front lines. The first mention of s in combat is on 7 August near Caen. On 19 August, the battalion had 17 operational and another 14 in maintenance. Most of the battalion was not trapped in the Falaise Pocket and managed to retreat to the northeast. It had only 22 vehicles in October, which were divided between the 1st and 2nd Companies; the surplus crews were sent to . It participated in the Battle of the Bulge, only advancing as far as St. Vith. It was continually on the retreat for the rest of the war and was captured in the Ruhr Pocket in April 1945.
 was raised in August 1944. It was sent to Warsaw, where it was attached to . It remained on the Eastern Front after the Warsaw Uprising was suppressed and was eventually wiped out in East Prussia in April 1945. It was supposed to have been the cadre for in January 1945, but it was never pulled out of the front lines to do so.

 was raised simultaneously with , but was transferred to the Paris area on 20 August. Nothing is known of its service in France, but company personnel were sent to at the end of the year and were supposed to have been used in the formation of .

 was ordered formed on 6 January 1945 with three companies with a total of 45 , but it received III assault guns during February instead.
 was originally to be formed from , but this was changed to in September 1944. In mid-September 1944, the brigade transferred to the Döllersheim Training Area to reorganize and re-equip. Only ten had been received when the battalion was alerted on 15 October to participate in , the German coup to forestall Hungary&#x27;s attempt to surrender to the Allies. All the vehicles were given to the First Company and it departed for Budapest on the following day. Bomb damage to the rails delayed its arrival until 19 October, by which time it was no longer needed as a pro-German government had been installed. It was moved by rail to St. Martin, Slovakia for more training. The battalion was transferred to the vicinity of Stuhlweissenburg to relieve trapped German forces in Budapest. It remained in the vicinity of Budapest until forced to retreat by advancing Soviet forces.

<text>Maumbury Rings is a Neolithic henge in the south of Dorchester town in Dorset, England (). It is a large circular earthwork, 85 metres in diameter, with a single bank and an entrance to the north east. It was modified during the Roman period when it was adapted for use as an amphitheatre, and the site was remodelled again during the English Civil War when it was used as an artillery fort guarding the southern approach to Dorchester. The monument is now a public open space, and used for open-air concerts, festivals and re-enactments.

==Description==
Maumbury Rings is a roughly circular henge situated close to the centre of Dorchester. It has an internal diameter of around 50 metres. The bank has an average width of 4 metres, and is around 5.6 metres high internally and 4.0 metres high externally. A bulge in the earthworks to the southwest marks the site of a gun emplacement built during the English Civil War, and the inner side of the bank was terraced on the east and west sides at this time. There is no trace of the original internal ditch.

==History==

===Neolithic===

Maumbury Rings were excavated by Harold St George Gray from 1908–1913. The excavations showed that the site originated in the later Neolithic period. The excavations revealed an internal ditch which comprised a series of deep shafts cut into the chalk. These number up to 45, and were up to 11 metres deep. Eight shafts were fully excavated. They contained various deposits including antler, animal and human bone, flints and carved chalk.The latter represent human phalloi and may be evidence of a fertility cult among the builders. A single Grooved ware pottery sherd was recovered from one pit, and a later Beaker sherd was recovered from the fill of another pit. The henge had a single entrance on the northeast side. It is recorded that a large stone was discovered during cultivation in 1849 to the west of the entrance, but it was reburied and has not been seen since.

Around 2 km due east are the faint traces of a larger henge known as Mount Pleasant henge, and archaeology has revealed the presence of another Neolithic enclosure known as Flagstones near there. In addition, when archaeologists were digging on the site of the Tudor Arcade/Waitrose development in the 1980s (around 800 metres northeast of Maumbury Rings) they discovered large timber postholes. The evidence suggests that they were part of a large Neolithic enclosure with a diameter of around 300 to 400 metres. Red markings, denoting sites of some of the timber posts, can be seen in the car park of Waitrose.

===Roman era===

Maumbury Rings was remodelled in the Roman period when it was adapted for use as an amphitheatre for the use of the citizens of the nearby Roman town of Durnovaria (Dorchester). The banks were lowered by around 3 metres, with the material produced piled onto the banks. The interior was modified by the excavation of an oval, level arena floor, and the cutting of seating into the scarp and bank which was revetted with either chalk or timber. Chambers were cut into the bank to the south-west and one on each side of the centre. Finds found during the excavations include an uninscribed British coin, Roman pottery, leg bones, coins, and a 2nd-century burial. The amphitheatre may have been out of use by the mid-2nd century, although objects found on the arena floor and elsewhere suggest activity in the 4th century.

===Civil war===

Between 1642 and 1643 the henge was modified in response to the English Civil War. The site was used as an artillery fort by Parliament supporters in order to guard the southern approach to Dorchester. This involved the placing of a gun platform and a ramp on the southwest side, and the internal terrace was built. An unfinished well near the northwest edge of the arena and finds of 160 lead pistol bullets on the east bank all date to this time, along with a ditch beyond the northern enclosure bank.

===Later use===
Its amphitheatre role was briefly revived in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, as a place of public execution. In 1685, at the close of the Monmouth Rebellion, Judge Jeffreys ordered eighty of the rebels to be executed here. In 1705 Mary Channing, a nineteen-year-old woman found guilty of poisoning her husband, was executed by strangulation and burning at the Rings. Thomas Hardy used this event in his poem &quot;The Mock Wife&quot; and mentioned it in his 1886 novel &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;, as well as recording some details of his research into the event in his personal writings.

By the later 18th century, the enclosure was being used as farmland.

In 1846, the proposed alignment of the Southampton and Dorchester Railway was amended in order to protect the Rings.

===The site today===
The monument is now a public open space, and used for open-air concerts, festivals and re-enactments. Finds from the excavations are in the Dorset Museum.

<text>Douglas Charles Howlett (born 21 September 1978) is a retired New Zealand professional rugby union player. He was primarily a wing, but he also sometimes played as a fullback.

He played for Auckland, and the Highlanders, Hurricanes and Blues in Super Rugby. He finished his career with Munster in Ireland.

With 49 tries in 62 tests, Howlett is currently the seventh-highest try scorer in rugby union history and the top try scorer for New Zealand.

==Early life==
Born in Auckland, New Zealand, Howlett attended May Road School and Mt Roskill Intermediate School. Howlett is of Tongan descent, with roots in the small coastal village of Kolonga. He started playing rugby at Auckland Grammar School, where he was also a star sprinter, captain of athletics and, during his final year in 1996, Head Prefect. He calls upon his speed as a sprinter (he once clocked a personal best 10.94 seconds for the 100 metres in an under 20 athletics championship in 1998) to great effect in his rugby career.

==Playing career==
Howlett made his first-class debut at the age of 18 for Auckland in the Air New Zealand Cup. He has played with three Super Rugby teams, briefly with the Otago Highlanders and Wellington Hurricanes and, for the majority of his career in his home city, the Auckland Blues. It was with his hometown Blues that he established himself as one of the finest back players in the world, winning a Super 12 title in 2003. Throughout his domestic career, he remained affiliated with Auckland in the Air New Zealand Cup, with more than 50 appearances for the union.

===Barbarians===
In May 2009, Howlett was named in the Barbarians squad to play England and Australia.

On 30 August 2007, Howlett signed for Munster, following in the footsteps of another All Black great, Christian Cullen. Howlett joined Munster at the start of 2008.
He made his debut for Munster in the Heineken Cup against ASM Clermont Auvergne, notably starting the movement for Lifeimi Mafi&#x27;s try. His second match came against London Wasps where he notably dived to save the ball in the build-up to Denis Leamy&#x27;s try. He scored his first Munster try against Ulster on 22 March 2008.

On 24 May 2008, Howlett was part of the Munster team that beat Toulouse 16–13 to win the 2007–08 Heineken Cup. Howlett had won his first cup with Munster only five and a half months into his career in the Northern Hemisphere. Howlett himself scored a try in the final only for it to be disallowed due to a forward pass from Rua Tipoki.

Howlett joins Rod Kafer and Brad Thorn in having won major rugby tournaments in both the southern and northern hemispheres, the Super 14 and Heineken Cup respectively. He enjoyed his success with the Auckland Blues in the 2003 Super 12 and Munster in 2008. With Munster winning the Magners League title for the 08–09 season, Howlett held both a Heineken Cup and Magners League medal in the space of just two seasons with Munster. On 26 February 2010 it was announced Howlett had signed a contract to stay on at Munster until the end of the 2010–11 season, with the option for a further year. That option was confirmed by Munster in February 2011, and he began the 2011/2012. But in December 2011, Howlett picked up an Achilles tendon injury in a Pro 12 game against Ospreys which ruled him out for the rest of the season.

On 24 February 2012, Munster announced that Howlett had extended his contract until the end of the 2012–13 season. On 24 August 2012, it was announced that Howlett would take over from Paul O&#x27;Connell as the Munster squad captain for the 2012–13 season. He underwent successful knee surgery in late January 2013, and returned to action after the surgery on 2 March 2013. On 14 May 2013, it was confirmed that Howlett, after receiving medical advice, would retire from rugby due to a shoulder injury he sustained playing against Glasgow Warriors in March 2013.

Howlett returned to the province as a corporate ambassador in December 2013. He went on to become Munster&#x27;s head of commercial and marketing, before returning to New Zealand in the autumn of 2019.

===International===
Howlett debuted for the All Blacks on 16 June 2000. In his career, he scored on average 4 points per game (155 from his first 38). He was also a first choice winger in the 2003 World Cup.

Howlett scored 49 tries for the All Blacks, a team record. His hat-trick against Italy on 8 September 2007, at the 2007 Rugby World Cup, brought him level with the record of Christian Cullen, the All Blacks&#x27; previous leading try scorer and then his try in the 15th minute against Scotland on 23 September gave him the record.

He was selected for the Rugby World Cup squad ahead of Canterbury and Tasman player Rico Gear; however, he was expected to play the first three rounds of the 2007 Air New Zealand Cup. He scored a hat trick in Auckland&#x27;s victory over Counties Manukau in the first round, and on 11 August against Waikato he scored two, bringing his try total for Auckland to 50. Howlett was known as a winger with a high work rate and strong defensive tackling ability.

==Personal==
Howlett is the brother of former Tongan rugby league international Phil Howlett.

On 22 February 2007 Howlett launched &quot;The Doug Howlett Outreach Foundation&quot; to support New Zealand children between the ages of 8 and 14 who demonstrated academic and sporting ability, initially in the codes of rugby union, rugby league, and netball. It was intended to assist with school and sports fees and sporting equipment. Scholarships and equipment were distributed in 2007 and 2008. The Foundation website is now offline and it appears defunct.

In May 2019, Howlett announced his decision to leave his role as Munster Rugby&#x27;s Head of Commercial and Marketing after 6 years to return to New Zealand with his family.

==Controversies==
Howlett was arrested on 9 October 2007 outside Heathrow Airport&#x27;s Hilton Hotel on suspicion of criminal damage to two cars. This followed the All Blacks&#x27; World Cup loss in Cardiff to France a few days earlier, a game in which Howlett did not play. Howlett subsequently issued an apology through the media.

He was again arrested on 23 December 2010 on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly after his team&#x27;s Christmas party in Kilkenny city.

<doc id="883560" wikidata="Q5520325" url="?curid=883560" title="Gamma-ray spectrometer">
<text>A gamma-ray spectrometer (GRS) is an instrument for measuring the distribution (or spectrum—see figure) of the intensity of gamma radiation versus the energy of each photon.
The study and analysis of gamma-ray spectra for scientific and technical use is called gamma spectroscopy, and gamma-ray spectrometers are the instruments which observe and collect such data.
Because the energy of each photon of EM radiation is proportional to its frequency, gamma rays have sufficient energy that they are typically observed by counting individual photons.

Some notable gamma-ray spectrometers are Gammasphere, AGATA, and GRETINA.

==Gamma-ray spectroscopy==

Atomic nuclei have an energy-level structure somewhat analogous to the energy levels of atoms, so that they may emit (or absorb) photons of particular energies, much as atoms do, but at energies that are thousands to millions of times higher than those typically studied in optical spectroscopy.
(Note that photons in the short-wavelength high-energy end of the atomic spectroscopy energy range (few eV to few hundred keV), generally termed X-rays, overlaps somewhat with the low end of the nuclear gamma-ray range (~10 MeV to ~10 keV) so that the terminology used to distinguish X-rays from gamma rays can be arbitrary or ambiguous in the overlap region.)
As with atoms, the particular energy levels of nuclei are characteristic of each species, so that the photon energies of the gamma rays emitted, which correspond to the energy differences of the nuclei, can be used to identify particular elements and isotopes.
Distinguishing between gamma-rays of slightly different energy is an important consideration in the analysis of complex spectra, and the ability of a GRS to do so is characterized by the instrument&#x27;s spectral resolution, or the accuracy with which the energy of each photon is measured.
Semi-conductor detectors, based on cooled germanium or silicon detecting elements, have been invaluable for such applications.
Because the energy level spectrum of nuclei typically dies out above about 10 MeV, gamma-ray instruments looking to still higher energies generally observe only continuum spectra, so that the moderate spectral resolution of scintillation (often sodium iodide (NaI) or caesium iodide, (CsI) spectrometers), often suffices for such applications.

==Astronomical spectrometers==
A number of investigations have been performed to observe the gamma-ray spectra of the Sun and other astronomical sources, both galactic and extra-galactic. The Gamma-Ray Imaging Spectrometer, the Hard X-ray/Low-Energy Gamma-ray experiment (A-4) on HEAO 1, the Burst and Transient Spectrometry Experiment (BATSE) and the OSSI (Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment) on CGRO, the C1 germanium (Ge) gamma-ray instrument on HEAO 3, and the Ge gamma-ray spectrometer (SPI) on the ESA INTEGRAL mission are examples of cosmic spectrometers, while the GRS on the SMM and the imaging Ge spectrometer on the RHESSI satellite have been devoted to solar observations.

==Planetary gamma-ray spectrometers==

Gamma-ray spectrometers have been widely used for the elemental and isotopic analysis of bodies in the Solar System, especially the Moon and Mars.
These surfaces are subjected to a continual bombardment of high-energy cosmic rays, which excite nuclei in them to emit characteristic gamma-rays which can be detected from orbit. 
Thus an orbiting instrument can in principle map the surface distribution of the elements for an entire planet. 
Examples include the mapping of 20 elements observed in the exploration of Mars, Eros and the Moon. They are usually associated with neutron detectors that can look for water and ice in the soil by measuring neutrons. They are able to measure the abundance and distribution of about 20 primary elements of the periodic table, including silicon, oxygen, iron, magnesium, potassium, aluminum, calcium, sulfur, and carbon. Knowing what elements are at or near the surface will give detailed information about how planetary bodies have changed over time. To determine the elemental makeup of the Martian surface, the Mars Odyssey used a gamma-ray spectrometer and two neutron detectors.

GRS instruments supply data on the distribution and abundance of chemical elements, much as the Lunar Prospector mission did on the Moon. In this case, the chemical element thorium was mapped, with higher concentrations shown as yellow/orange/red in the left image.

===How a GRS works===
Some constructions of scintillation counters can be used as gamma-ray spectrometers. The gamma photon energy is discerned from the intensity of the flash of the scintillator, a number of low-energy photons produced by the single high-energy one. Another approach relies on using Germanium detectors - a crystal of hyperpure germanium that produces pulses proportional to the captured photon energy; while more sensitive, it has to be cooled to a low temperature, requiring a bulky cryogenic apparatus. Handheld and many laboratory gamma spectrometers are therefore the scintillator kind, mostly with thallium-doped sodium iodide, thallium-doped caesium iodide, or, more recently, cerium doped lanthanum bromide. Spectrometers for space missions conversely tend to be of the germanium kind.

When exposed to cosmic rays (charged particles from space thought to possibly originate in supernova and active galactic nuclei), chemical elements in soils and rocks emit uniquely identifiable signatures of energy in the form of gamma rays. The gamma-ray spectrometer looks at these signatures, or energies, coming from the elements present in the target soil.

By measuring gamma rays coming from the target body, it is possible to calculate the abundance of various elements and how they are distributed around the planet&#x27;s surface. Gamma rays, emitted from the nuclei of atoms, show up as sharp emission lines on the instrument&#x27;s spectrum output. While the energy represented in these emissions determines which elements are present, the intensity of the spectrum reveals the elements concentrations. Spectrometers are expected to add significantly to the growing understanding of the origin and evolution of planets like Mars and the processes shaping them today and in the past.

Gamma rays and neutrons are produced by cosmic rays. Incoming cosmic rays—some of the highest-energy particles—collide with the nucleus of atoms in the soil. When nuclei are hit with such energy, neutrons are released, which scatter and collide with other nuclei. The nuclei get &quot;excited&quot; in the process, and emit gamma rays to release the extra energy so they can return to their normal rest state. Some elements like potassium, uranium, and thorium are naturally radioactive and give off gamma rays as they decay, but all elements can be excited by collisions with cosmic rays to produce gamma rays. The HEND and Neutron Spectrometers on GRS directly detect scattered neutrons, and the gamma sensor detects the gamma rays.

===Water detection===

By measuring neutrons, it is possible to calculate the abundance of hydrogen, thus inferring the presence of water. The neutron detectors are sensitive to concentrations of hydrogen in the upper meter of the surface. When cosmic rays hit the surface of Mars, neutrons and gamma-rays come out of the soil. The GRS measured their energies. Certain energies are produced by hydrogen. Since hydrogen is most likely present in the form of water ice, the spectrometer will be able to measure directly the amount of permanent ground ice and how it changes with the seasons. Like a virtual shovel &quot;digging into&quot; the surface, the spectrometer will allow scientists to peer into this shallow subsurface of Mars and measure the existence of hydrogen.

GRS will supply data similar to that of the successful Lunar Prospector mission, which told us how much hydrogen, and thus water, is likely on the Moon.

The gamma-ray spectrometer used on the Odyssey spacecraft consists of four main components: the gamma sensor head, the neutron spectrometer, the high energy neutron detector, and the central electronics assembly. The sensor head is separated from the rest of the spacecraft by a 6.2 meter (20 ft) boom, which was extended after Odyssey entered the mapping orbit at Mars. This maneuver is done to minimize interference from any gamma rays coming from the spacecraft itself. The initial spectrometer activity, lasting between 15 and 40 days, performed an instrument calibration before the boom was deployed. After about 100 days of the mapping mission, the boom was deployed and remained in this position for the duration of the mission. The two neutron detectors-the neutron spectrometer and the high-energy neutron detector-are mounted on the main spacecraft structure and operated continuously throughout the mapping mission.

===GRS specifications for the Odyssey mission===

The Gamma-Ray Spectrometer weighs 30.5 kilograms (67.2 lb) and uses 32 watts of power. Along with its cooler, it measures 468 by 534 by 604 mm (18.4 by 21.0 by 23.8 in). The detector is a photodiode made of a 1.2 kg germanium crystal, reverse biased to about 3 kilovolts, mounted at the end of a six-meter boom to minimize interferences from the gamma radiation produced by the spacecraft itself. Its spatial resolution is about 300 km.

The neutron spectrometer is 173 by 144 by 314 mm (6.8 by 5.7 by 12.4 in).

The high-energy neutron detector measures 303 by 248 by 242 mm (11.9 by 9.8 by 9.5 in). The instrument&#x27;s central electronics box is 281 by 243 by 234 mm (11.1 by 9.6 by 9.2 in).

<text>King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table is a Neolithic henge in the village of Eamont Bridge in the English county of Cumbria, around south east of Penrith. It is 400 metres from Mayburgh Henge. The site is free to visitors and is under the control of English Heritage.

==Description==
King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table is a henge situated in a field next to the A6 road in the village of Eamont Bridge, south of Penrith, Cumbria. The northern part of the henge is now covered by the B5320 road and the Crown Hotel, while the A6 road has encroached on the eastern part. The larger Mayburgh Henge is just 400 metres to the west, and the fragments of the Little Round Table henge are 200 metres to the south. This indicates the presence of a henge complex and possible ritual landscape similar to those at Thornborough or Salisbury Plain.

The henge is around 90 metres in diameter. The enclosed area is about 50 metres across; the ditch has a maximum width of 16 metres; the berm 7 metres; and the bank 13 metres. There appears to have been two original entrances, but only the south-east entrance survives as the northwest entrance has been mostly destroyed by the modern road. Parts of the henge were landscaped in the late 18th to early 19th century, apparently with an intent to use the site as a tea garden. The site is in the care of English Heritage and open to the public.

==Archaeology==

Around 1664 William Dugdale sketched the remains, showing the two opposing entrances, and also showing that there were two standing stones, one each side of the northwest entrance. These stones had disappeared when William Stukeley saw the monument in 1725. In 1891, C. W. Dymond produced a comprehensive record of the remains.

Excavations were undertaken in 1937 by R. G. Collingwood and continued in 1939 by Gerhard Bersu. The excavations showed that the ditch had been cleared out and reshaped and the entrance through it made narrower in modern times. Collingwood claimed to have identified a number of structures, represented by postholes, and identified a &quot;cremation trench&quot; near the centre of the site. Bersu, however, contradicted most of Collingwood&#x27;s findings, arguing that the posthole features were not of archaeological significance, and he found no evidence of cremation burning, although he accepted that there might be a disturbed grave. However Grace Simpson (1998), the daughter of the excavator F.G. Simpson, and Stephen Leach (2019) have queried Bersu&#x27;s work and largely rehabilitated Collingwood as an excavator.

In 1988 a geophysical survey was conducted to examine the north segment and the southeast entrance, but the results were directly affected by the 18th–19th century landscaping.

==Little Round Table==
Little Round Table henge is 200 metres to the south of King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table. It is mostly destroyed by buildings, tracks and roads. There is a barely discernible bank on the northern side 30 metres in length, up to 5 metres wide, but only 15 centimetres high. There are some fragmentary traces of a low earthen bank with some stone visible along the south side. These remains suggest that the site was originally about 90 metres in diameter. This corresponds to the sketch William Stukeley made in 1725 showing a roughly circular enclosure circa 90 metres in diameter with a bank with outer ditch.

<text>The Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) is a gamma-ray spectrometer on the &quot;2001 Mars Odyssey&quot; spacecraft, a space probe orbiting the planet Mars since 2001. Part of NASA&#x27;s Mars Surveyor 2001 program, it returns geological data about Mars&#x27;s surface such as identifying elements and the location of water. It is maintained by the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona in the United States. This instrument has mapped the distribution surface hydrogen, thought to trace water in the surface layer of Martian soil.

<text>Haggard () is a German symphonic metal band founded in 1989. The group combines classical music and early music with death doom metal.

==History==

Haggard was founded in 1989 and originally played death metal. They changed their musical style after their first demo tape, &quot;Introduction&quot; in 1992, becoming a band with symphonic melodies and classical instruments but folk themes. The album &quot;And Thou Shalt Trust... the Seer&quot; marked their breakthrough in 1997. After their second album &quot;Awaking the Centuries&quot; (the life of the prophet Nostradamus), they toured through Mexico twice. 

Just before their album &quot;Awaking the Centuries&quot; was released, the group had its highest number of musicians at 21. All their songs are written by vocalist and guitarist Asis Nasseri.

In 2004, they released their third album &quot;Eppur Si Muove&quot; about the life of Italian scholar Galileo Galilei, sentenced to house arrest for heresy by the Catholic Church for supporting Copernicus&#x27; claim that the Earth revolved around the Sun. In 2021 the album was elected by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; as the 23rd best symphonic metal album.
The fourth album, &quot;Tales of Ithiria&quot;, was released in 2008 and is based on a fantasy story.

In 2010, the band had its first concert along with a symphonic orchestra. Haggard played together with the philharmonic orchestra of Plovdiv in the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv on 19 April 2010.

Although a new album with the title of &quot;Grimm&quot; was originally announced for the end of 2012, the album has since been postponed indefinitely.

<text>The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (; ; ; ; SRG SSR) is the Swiss public broadcasting association, founded in 1931, the holding company of 24 radio and television channels. Headquartered in Bern, the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation is a non-profit organisation, funded mainly through radio and television licence fees (79%) and making the remaining income from advertising and sponsorship.

Switzerland&#x27;s system of direct democracy and the fact that the country has four official languages (German, French, Italian and Romansh) mean that the structure of Swiss public service broadcasting is rather complicated. The actual holders of the broadcasting licences that enable SRG SSR to operate are four regional corporations:
* German Switzerland: (SRF)
* French Switzerland: (RTS)
* Italian Switzerland: (RSI)
* Romansh: (RTR)

These four corporations maintain SRG SSR as a joint central production and broadcasting association. The fifth business unit of the SRG SSR is the ten-language news platform Swissinfo.

==Name==

The association&#x27;s official name is (SRG, formerly &quot;) in German, (SSR, formerly &quot;) in French, (SSR, formerly &quot;) in Italian, and (SSR, formerly &quot;) in Romansh. The corporate name, SRG SSR, is derived from its initials in German and its initials in French, Italian and Romansh. In English, the organisation is known as the &quot;Swiss Broadcasting Corporation&quot;. The moniker , which refers to the public service mission of the organisation, was adopted in 1999 and was removed from the name in 2010.

==History==

Europe&#x27;s third public radio station started broadcasting from Lausanne in 1922, from the start based on a licence fee system. 980 licences were bought in 1923. Within a few years radio cooperatives working along the same principles had started throughout the country. In 1930 it was decided that radio was an important public service that should not be allowed to become a money maker for private interests, and that it needed to be structured on a federal basis. In 1931 SRG SSR was founded (see original names above), as a co-ordination organisation for the regional broadcast associations, and received the only licence to broadcast from the Federal Council. The same year it was agreed that all news reports in the new medium had to be provided by the Swiss news agency SDA, a decision that remained unchanged until 1971.

The first national transmitters began operating in 1931: Radio Sottens for French, Radio Beromünster for German, and 1933 Radio Monte Ceneri for Italian. In 1938 Romansh was recognised as the country&#x27;s fourth national language, and the Zürich studios began broadcasting programmes in Romansh in between those in German. During the Second World War, SRG SSR filled an important function as a neutral, unbiased supplier of news, reaching far outside Switzerland&#x27;s borders through shortwave transmissions. Radio Beromünster and Radio Monte Ceneri became known as the only free German and Italian-language radio stations in Europe.

In 1950, SRG SSR was one of 23 founding broadcasting organisations of the European Broadcasting Union. In 1939 television test transmissions started in Zürich. In 1953 regular TV transmissions started in German (from Zürich) – one hour per evening, five days a week. A year later, in 1954, French transmissions were broadcast from Geneva. For the Italian-speaking region, the programmes were re-transmitted with Italian subtitles until dedicated Italian studios were built in 1961.

In 1960, the company was renamed &quot;Schweizerische Radio- und Fernsehgesellschaft&quot; (and the equivalent names in the other languages - see above) to reflect the addition of television services. In 1965, the Federal Council allowed television advertising, as a means of keeping licence fees down. In 1966, the three main language communities were each given a second radio channel, in order to counter the effects of new commercial broadcasters outside the country, whose strong signals were reaching the Swiss population. In the same year, a dedicated Romansh broadcasting unit was created in Chur, using some of the new German-language second channel&#x27;s broadcasting time. In 1968, colour television was introduced.

In 1978, the radio channels started stereo transmissions. In 1983, the Federal Council relaxed the Swiss media legislation to permit local private and commercial radio channels. SRG SSR countered this threat by launching its third set of channels, aimed at a younger audience. In 1991, SRG SSR underwent a wide-ranging restructuring. The enterprise organised itself as a private industry association, structured as a holding company under Swiss company law. The name, SRG SSR idée suisse, was introduced in 1999. In 1992, Radio Rumantsch was separated from the German-language radio broadcaster that had housed the Romansh broadcasting activities since 1938, and in 1995, the Romansh TV activities were moved over as well and the Romansh company renamed itself Radio e Televisiun Rumantscha.

In 1997, SRG SSR started digital broadcasts via the Hot Bird (13 degrees East) satellite. It is encrypted from satellite due to copyright restrictions. SRG SSR Sat Access information channel stopped broadcasting in 2005. Since 2016, all channels have been broadcasting via satellite only in HD quality. All radio and SRF info TV channels are free-to-air via satellite.

On 3 June 2019, SRG SSR terminated digital terrestrial (DVB-T) broadcasts of all of its television channels due to the extremely low usage of digital terrestrial signals on television sets in Switzerland, which was part of a series of cost-saving measures partly brought about as a result of the 2018 &quot;No Billag&quot; popular initiative. The corporation estimated that 1.9% of the public used the DVB-T broadcasts, nearly all of which was for viewing on secondary devices. Television broadcasts remain available through cable, IPTV and DTH satellite. SRG SSR recommended DVB-T viewers switch to satellite.

SRG SSR planned to shut down its FM transmission infrastructure on 31 December 2024. The corporation concluded that maintaining FM broadcasts along with DAB+ and Internet streaming was no longer cost-effective, as due to widespread adoption of DAB+ the share of the public relying exclusively on FM was under ten percent and decreasing. This will be followed by a general switch-off of FM broadcasting by 31 December 2026.

==Organisation==
SRG SSR is headquartered in Bern. It is governed by an Executive Board, appointed by a central council consisting of representatives of the four organisations.

Broadcasting is handled by five business units:
* Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen: handles German-speaking radio and television
* Radio télévision suisse: handles French-speaking radio and television
* Radiotelevisione svizzera di lingua italiana: handles Italian-speaking radio and television
* Radio Television Rumantscha: handles Romansh-speaking radio and television
* Swissinfo.ch: provides reporting on Swiss politics, business, science, culture and society for an international audience with an interest in Switzerland and handles the web portal swissinfo.ch

The corporation also has two subsidiary companies which produce, for example,the teletext pages.

It also operated HD suisse, its first high-definition television channel, with programming came from the four language networks of SRG SSR.

The television channels of SRG SSR are free to watch on the internet within Switzerland only due to broadcasting rights, except for its radio stations.

==Swissinfo==

The former abbreviation SRI originally stood only for &quot;Swiss Radio International&quot;, which was SRG SSR&#x27;s international broadcasting arm (1935–2004), aimed at expatriates and others interested in Switzerland. In October 2004, SRI ceased broadcasting on shortwave and satellite, and instead concentrated its efforts on its multimedia internet platform SWI swissinfo, which now takes most of the resources. The Swissinfo website is produced in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Chinese, Russian and Japanese.

==Swiss Satellite Radio==
 (SSatR) is a radio company owned by SRG SSR that includes three stations: (pop music); (jazz, soul and blues) and (classical music) all without interruptions. These stations have been on air since 1 September 1998.

<doc id="883596" wikidata="Q3901296" url="?curid=883596" title="Phelix">
<text>Phelix is a high-speed stream cipher with a built-in single-pass message authentication code (MAC) functionality, submitted in 2004 to the eSTREAM contest by Doug Whiting, Bruce Schneier, Stefan Lucks, and Frédéric Muller. The cipher uses only the operations of addition modulo 232, exclusive or, and rotation by a fixed number of bits. Phelix uses a 256-bit key and a 128-bit nonce, claiming a design strength of 128 bits. Concerns have been raised over the ability to recover the secret key if the cipher is used incorrectly.

== Performance ==
Phelix is optimised for 32-bit platforms. The authors state that it can achieve up to eight cycles per byte on modern x86-based processors.

FPGA Hardware performance figures published in the paper &quot;Review of stream cipher candidates from a low resource hardware perspective&quot; are as follows:
== Helix ==
Phelix is a slightly modified form of an earlier cipher, Helix, published in 2003 by Niels Ferguson, Doug Whiting, Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Stefan Lucks, and Tadayoshi Kohno; Phelix adds 128 bits to the internal state.

In 2004, Frédéric Muller published two attacks on Helix. The first has a complexity of 288 and requires 212 adaptive chosen-plaintext words, but requires nonces to be reused. Souradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel later showed that the number of adaptive chosen-plaintext words of Muller&#x27;s attack can be reduced by a factor of 3 in the worst case (a factor of 46.5 in the best case) using their optimal algorithms to solve differential equations of addition. In a later development, Souradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel showed that the above attack can also be implemented with chosen plaintexts (CP) rather than adaptive chosen plaintexts (ACP) with data complexity 235.64 CP&#x27;s. Muller&#x27;s second attack on Helix is a distinguishing attack that requires 2114 words of chosen plaintext.

Phelix&#x27;s design was largely motivated by Muller&#x27;s differential attack.

== Security ==
Phelix was selected as a Phase 2 Focus Candidate for both Profile 1 and Profile 2 by the eSTREAM project. The authors of Phelix classify the cipher as an experimental design in its specifications. The authors advise that Phelix should not be used until it had received additional cryptanalysis. Phelix was not advanced to Phase 3, largely because of Wu and Preneel&#x27;s key-recovery attack noted below that becomes possible when the prohibition against reusing a nonce is violated.

The first cryptanalytic paper on Phelix was a chosen-key distinguishing attack, published in October 2006. Doug Whiting has reviewed the attack and notes that while the paper is clever, the attack unfortunately relies on incorrect assumptions concerning the initialisation of the Phelix cipher. This paper was subsequently withdrawn by its authors.

A second cryptanalytic paper on Phelix titled &quot;Differential Attacks against Phelix&quot; was published on 26 November 2006 by Hongjun Wu and Bart Preneel. The paper is based on the same attacks assumption as the Differential Attack against Helix. The paper shows that if the cipher is used incorrectly (nonces reused), the key of Phelix can be recovered with about 237 operations, 234 chosen nonces and 238.2 chosen plaintext words. The computational complexity of the attack is much less than that of the attack against Helix.

The authors of the differential attack express concern that each plaintext word affects the keystream without passing through (what they consider to be) sufficient confusion and diffusion layers. They claim this is an intrinsic weakness in the structure of Helix and Phelix. The authors conclude that they consider Phelix to be insecure.

<text>Allan MacLeod Cormack (February 23, 1924 – May 7, 1998) was a South African and American physicist, academic, and Nobel laureate. He was Professor of Physics at Tufts University and won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (along with Godfrey Hounsfield) for his work on X-ray computed tomography (CT), a significant and unusual achievement since Cormack did not hold a doctoral degree in any scientific field.

==Early life and education==
Cormack was born on February 23, 1924, in Johannesburg, South Africa. He attended Rondebosch Boys&#x27; High School in Cape Town, where he was active in the debating and tennis teams. He received his B.Sc. in physics in 1944 from the University of Cape Town and his M.Sc. in crystallography in 1945 from the same institution. He was a doctoral student at Cambridge University from 1947 to 1949, and while at Cambridge he met his future wife, Barbara Seavey, an American physics student.

==Career==
After marrying Barbara, he returned to the University of Cape Town in early 1950 to lecture. Following a sabbatical at Harvard in 1956–57, the couple agreed to move to the United States, and Cormack became a professor at Tufts University in the fall of 1957. Cormack became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1966. Although he was mainly working on particle physics, Cormack&#x27;s side interest in x-ray technology led him to develop the theoretical underpinnings of CT scanning. This work was initiated at the University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital in early 1956 and continued briefly in mid-1957 after returning from his sabbatical. His results were subsequently published in two papers in the Journal of Applied Physics in 1963 and 1964. These papers generated little interest until Hounsfield and colleagues built the first CT scanner in 1971 in the UK, taking Cormack&#x27;s theoretical calculations into a real application. For their independent efforts, Cormack and Hounsfield shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. It is notable that the two built a very similar type of device without collaboration in different parts of the world [3]. He was member of the International Academy of Science, Munich. In 1990, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.

==Death==
Cormack died of cancer in Winchester, Massachusetts, at age 74. He was posthumously awarded the Order of Mapungubwe on December 10, 2002, for outstanding achievements as a scientist and for co-inventing the CT scanner.

<doc id="883599" wikidata="Q617671" url="?curid=883599" title="Icehouse (band)">
<text>Icehouse are an Australian rock band, formed in Sydney in 1977 as Flowers.
Initially known in their homeland for their pub rock style, the band later achieved mainstream success playing new wave and synth-pop music and attained Top 10 singles chart success locally and in both Europe and the U.S. The mainstay of both Flowers and Icehouse has been Iva Davies (singer-songwriter, record producer, guitar, bass, keyboards, oboe) supplying additional musicians as required. The name &quot;Icehouse&quot;, adopted in 1981, comes from an old, cold flat Davies lived in and the strange building across the road populated by itinerant people.

Davies and Icehouse extended the use of synthesisers particularly the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 (&quot;Love in Motion&quot;, 1981), Linn drum machine (&quot;Hey Little Girl&quot;, 1982) and Fairlight CMI (&quot;Razorback&quot; trailer, 1983) in Australian popular music. Their best known singles on the Australian charts include &quot;Great Southern Land&quot;, &quot;Hey Little Girl&quot;, &quot;Crazy&quot;, &quot;Electric Blue&quot; and &quot;My Obsession&quot;; with Top Three albums being &quot;Icehouse&quot; (1980, as Flowers), &quot;Primitive Man&quot; (1982) and &quot;Man of Colours&quot; (1987).

Icehouse was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame on 16 August 2006.
ARIA described Icehouse as &quot;one of the most successful Australian bands of the eighties and nineties... With an uncompromising approach to music production they created songs that ranged from pure pop escapism to edgy, lavish synthesised pieces...&quot; Icehouse has produced eight top-ten albums and twenty top-forty singles in Australia, multiple top-ten hits in Europe and North America and album sales of over 28-times platinum in Australasia alone.

Flowers were formed in Sydney in 1977 by Iva Davies (vocals, guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, oboe), a classically trained musician, and their main creative force; with bass player Keith Welsh. Davies was working as a part-time cleaner at a Lindfield squash court managed by Welsh&#x27;s mother, they lived nearby and were both interested in forming a band. Additional musicians used by Flowers in 1978 were Michael Hoste on keyboards and Don Brown on drums. The band built up a strong following as a live act around the pub circuit, providing distinctive cover versions of songs by David Bowie, Lou Reed, T-Rex, Ultravox and Brian Eno. The band performed at Cloudland on 28 July 1979, with The Numbers and British group XTC. By the middle of 1979 John Lloyd (ex-Paul Kelly and the Dots) replaced Don Brown on drums, with Anthony Smith (who was sometimes called Adam Hall), on keyboards, replacing Michael Hoste who remained associated with the band and later rejoined. 

After signing to the independent Regular Records label, distributed by Festival, Flowers released their debut single in May 1980, &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Myself&quot; (written by Davies), which reached the Australian Top 10 in June 1980. This was followed by their debut album &quot;Icehouse&quot;, which reached No. 4 on the National albums chart and became one of the year&#x27;s biggest selling albums in Australia. The album, co-produced by Cameron Allan (Mental As Anything&#x27;s producer) and Davies, made use of synthesisers, including the Minimoog, Solina Strings and Oberheim OB-1. Hoste co-wrote four tracks with Davies and played additional keyboards, with Smith continuing to provide the main keyboards. Further singles &quot;We Can Get Together&quot; and &quot;Walls&quot; from &quot;Icehouse&quot; also hit the Top 20.

Flowers&#x27; popularity was recognised when they were awarded the 1980 &quot;TV Week&quot; / &quot;Countdown&quot; Rock Awards &#x27;Johnny O&#x27;Keefe New Talent Award&#x27; ahead of The Dugites, INXS and Karen Knowles. They were also nominated for &#x27;Best Album&#x27; and &#x27;Best Album Cover&#x27; for &quot;Icehouse&quot; but lost on both to Cold Chisel&#x27;s &quot;East&quot;, Iva Davies was nominated as &#x27;Best Songwriter&#x27; but lost to Cold Chisel&#x27;s Don Walker. At the award ceremony, Flowers performed &quot;Icehouse&quot; with Davies framed within a cube of white neon tubing. In early 1981, Flowers signed to Chrysalis Records for European, Japanese, UK and U.S. releases; they had to change their name due to legal restrictions and to prevent confusion with a Scottish group The Flowers. Their last performance under the name Flowers was on 27 June 1981 at the Capitol Theatre in Sydney, they chose the name of their album to become known as Icehouse.

==1981–1989: Icehouse==
As Icehouse, the band spent the second half of 1981 touring the UK, Canada and the U.S., whilst Chrysalis released most of their Flowers material under the name Icehouse. The single &quot;Icehouse&quot; was released in Europe and created some interest in the UK, partly because of a video directed by Russell Mulcahy, while in the U.S. the song peaked at No. 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Tracks chart in 1981. &quot;Icehouse&quot; had been written by Davies when he lived at 18 Tryon Road, Lindfield in an old, cold flat of a two-storey mansion – across the street was a dishevelled house which had its lights on all night peopled by short-term residents. Davies later learned it was a half-way house for psychiatric and drug rehab patients. The first U.S. single &quot;We Can Get Together&quot; peaked at No. 62 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. A single-only release, &quot;Love in Motion&quot;, was recorded by Davies using the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5, and became the first new recording credited to Icehouse; it hit the Australian Top 10 in November 1981. Icehouse split up late in 1981, Keith Welsh later becoming manager of Australian bands Do-Ré-Mi and Boom Crash Opera.

===1981–1983: &quot;Primitive Man&quot;, &quot;Fresco EP&quot;===
In January 1982 Davies recorded &quot;Primitive Man&quot; essentially as a solo project, it was co-produced with Keith Forsey who had worked with Giorgio Moroder and later worked with Simple Minds. Forsey supplied additional percussion; Davies supplied vocals, guitars, keyboards (Prophet 5), bass and programmed the Linn drum machine. Released on September 20, 1982, as an Icehouse album, &quot;Primitive Man&quot; reached No. 3 on the National album charts and provided their international breakthrough single, &quot;Hey Little Girl&quot; which peaked at No. 7 in Australia, No. 2 in Switzerland, No. 5 in Germany and top 20 in UK, Sweden and Netherlands. The album was less successful in the U.S where it peaked at number 129 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the song &quot;Hey Little Girl&quot; appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Tracks chart for one week at number 31. 

Another single &quot;Great Southern Land&quot; made the Australian Top 5, and was later featured in the 1988 Yahoo Serious film &quot;Young Einstein&quot;. To promote &quot;Primitive Man&quot; on tour, Davies re-assembled Icehouse with Hoste and Lloyd, and new members: Robert Kretschmer (guitar, backing vocals), Guy Pratt (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Andy Qunta (keyboards, backing vocals). &quot;Fresco&quot; was a five-track EP released in 1983 by this line-up, they supported David Bowie on the European section of his Serious Moonlight tour. &quot;Love in Motion&quot; was released in 1983 by Chrysalis for the UK market, it was the &quot;Primitive Man&quot; album with &quot;Love in Motion&quot; replacing album track &quot;Break These Chains&quot;. Back in 1982, Russell Mulcahy had directed two of their video clips: &quot;Hey Little Girl&quot; and &quot;Street Cafe&quot; (released February 1983), after these Mulcahy asked Davies to record the score for his film &quot;Razorback&quot;; it was entirely instrumental, and featured Davies&#x27; first recorded use of the Australian designed Fairlight Music Computer. The trailer for the movie was released in 1983, the film itself in April 1984.

===1984–1986: &quot;Sidewalk&quot; and &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;===
Icehouse&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Sidewalk&quot; was released in 1984 and peaked at No. 8 on the National albums chart with singles &quot;Taking the Town&quot; peaked at No. 29 in May, &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe Anymore&quot; peaked at No. 31 August and &quot;Dusty Pages&quot; peaked at No. 82 in November. Davies used the Fairlight CMI digital sampling synthesiser exclusively.

Davies was commissioned to compose and record the score for the Sydney Dance Company production of Graeme Murphy&#x27;s work &quot;Boxes&quot;. Davies only used Kretschmer, with percussion being supplied by Masaki Tanazawa. &quot;Boxes&quot; was first performed live at the Sydney Opera House on 7 November 1985. After the &quot;Boxes&quot; project, Icehouse was Davies, Kretschmer, Pratt and Qunta with former Members member Simon Lloyd (sax, trumpet, keyboards) and Steve Jansen (drums, percussion).

In 1986, their fourth studio album, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; featured Brian Eno as an additional performer; it provided the Australian singles of &quot;No Promises&quot; No. 19, &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re So Strange&quot; No. 12, &quot;Mr. Big&quot; No. 14 and &quot;Cross the Border&quot;. Further inroads into the U.S. market occurred with &quot;No Promises&quot; peaking at No. 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart and &quot;Cross the Border&quot; reaching No. 19. In Canada, &quot;No Promises&quot; reached No.61. On tour for &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, Icehouse were Davies, Kretschmer, Lloyd and Qunta with Glenn Krawczyk on bass (replacing new member Vito Portolesi after nine shows) and Paul Wheeler on drums. On 14 August 1986 their performance at New York City&#x27;s The Ritz was recorded as &quot;Icehouse: Live at the Ritz&quot;, directed by John Jopson and broadcast on U.S. TV on 9 September 1987 and on Australian TV on 15 November 1987; it was released on VHS and NTSC formats. Jopson was subsequently used to direct four music videos for Icehouse. Stephen Morgan replaced Krawczyk on bass during 1987.

===1987–1989: &quot;Man of Colours&quot; and &quot;Great Southern Land&quot;===

Their best-selling album is 1987&#x27;s &quot;Man of Colours&quot;, which contained the Australian hit singles &quot;Crazy&quot; which peaked at No. 4 in July, &quot;Electric Blue&quot;, co-written by Davies and John Oates of U.S. band Hall &amp; Oates, peaked at No. 1 in October, &quot;My Obsession&quot; No. 12 in December, &quot;Man of Colours&quot; No. 28 in February 1988 and &quot;Nothing Too Serious&quot; No. 29 in May 1988. It was the first Australian album to have five singles charting in the top 30, it remained at No. 1 on the Australian album charts for eleven weeks and has sold over 700,000 copies. 

In Canada, &quot;Crazy&quot; reached No. 22, &quot;Electric Blue&quot; reached No. 10, and &quot;My Obsession&quot; reached No. 84. With U.S. chart success for &quot;Crazy&quot;, which reached No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 10 on its Mainstream Rock chart, and &quot;Electric Blue&quot; peaked at No. 7 Hot 100 and No. 10 Mainstream, the band had reached their zenith of popularity, the album &quot;Man of Colours&quot; reached No. 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Man of Colours&quot; was lauded in Australia during 1988, it won two ARIA Awards, &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27; and &#x27;Highest-Selling Album&#x27;. The associated song &quot;Electric Blue&quot; won &#x27;Most Performed Australasian Popular Work&#x27; at the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) Music Awards in 1989 for its writers, Davies and Oates. The cover artwork, designed by Davies and Kretschmer, depicts a human figure holding three different coloured flowers.

In 1988, Davies and Kretschmer also wrote and recorded the track &quot;Dance Of Life&quot; for Yukihiro Takahashi&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Ego&quot;. The only Icehouse releases for 1989 were a single &quot;Touch the Fire&quot; which reached No. 13 in Australia in November and a compilation double album and video collection &quot;Great Southern Land&quot;. December 1989 saw the release of &quot;Jimmy Dean&quot; as a single which reached No. 47 on the ARIA singles charts.

==1990–present: Iva Davies and Icehouse==
===1990–1992: &quot;Code Blue&quot;, &quot;Masterfile&quot;===
Qunta left at about this time with Icehouse recording their next album, &quot;Code Blue&quot; released in October. Singles released from the album were &quot;Big Fun&quot; which peaked at No. 47 on the ARIA singles charts in August, &quot;Miss Divine&quot; at No. 16 in October and &quot;Anything is Possible&quot; at No. 49 in January 1991. For &quot;Code Blue&quot; recording, Icehouse were Davies, Lloyd, Morgan and Wheeler, for touring they added guitarist Paul Gildea and keyboardist Roger Mason (ex-Models). In 1992, EMI released a compilation, &quot;Masterfile&quot; containing a new version of &quot;Love in Motion&quot; also released as a single featuring Davies in a duet with Christina Amphlett of Divinyls.

===1993–1995: &quot;Full Circle&quot;, &quot;Big Wheel&quot;, and &quot;Berlin&quot;===
&quot;Full Circle&quot;, an entire album of remixes was recorded during 1993, it included the track &quot;Shakin&#x27; the Cage&quot; which was released on the &quot;Spin One&quot; EP in early 1993 and was followed by their seventh and final studio album, &quot;Big Wheel&quot; in November, which contained the singles &quot;Satellite&quot; in October and &quot;Big Wheel&quot; in March 1994, while the &quot;Full Circle&quot; album itself was not released until December 1994; neither albums nor singles had any Top 40 chart success.

By 1995, Davies was again involved with the Sydney Dance Company, this time with their production of &quot;Berlin&quot;. The musical score was a collection of cover versions of songs by David Bowie, Brian Eno, Simple Minds, The Psychedelic Furs, Frank Sinatra, Lou Reed, Roxy Music, XTC, Talking Heads, The Velvet Underground, PiL, The Cure and Killing Joke, which saw Davies collaborating with pianist Max Lambert in the development of the music. Sessions were released as &quot;The Berlin Tapes&quot; under the name Iva Davies and Icehouse in 1995 on DIVA (Iva Davies&#x27; own label) / Massive Records for Australian release and Warner Records for international release in 2002. As well as recording the ballet score, Davies and Icehouse performed live at each performance, &quot;Berlin&quot; ran for two seasons. 

During 1999 Davies, together with Richard Tognetti and Christopher Gordon, composed &quot;The Ghost of Time&quot; as an expansion of &quot;Great Southern Land&quot; into a forty-minute performance for Sydney&#x27;s part of the worldwide millennial celebrations. On New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1999, Davies (vocals, guitar), Tognetti (violin), Guy Pratt (bass), Krawczyk (drums) ROM=Pari (Taiko – Japanese drums) and Sydney Symphony Orchestra performed &quot;The Ghost of Time&quot; on the northern forecourt of Sydney Opera House alongside Sydney Harbour and was televised around the world on CNN and other news networks. Davies had released the solo album, &quot;The Ghost of Time&quot; earlier in December 1999.

===2001–2010: &quot;Bipolar Poems&quot;, remasters===
Davies has been working since 2001 on a proposed Icehouse album to be titled &quot;Bi-polar Poems&quot; with certain tracks available between 2004 and 2008 from the Official Iva Davies – Icehouse website including &quot;Your God Not Mine&quot;. As of 2024, the album is still unreleased, and no updates on the album&#x27;s progress—if any—have been issued in over a decade.

In 2002, The Whitlams covered &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe Anymore&quot; from &quot;Sidewalk&quot; for their album &quot;Torch the Moon&quot;, which enjoyed moderate radio success. During 2002, Davies digitally remastered all of Flowers&#x27; and Icehouse&#x27;s studio albums adding bonus tracks to each—they were released by Warner Music Australia. In 2003 Iva Davies contributed &quot;Ghost of Time&quot; and other music to the film score of the Russell Crowe epic &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Heroes&quot;, which was &quot;The Berlin Tapes&quot; repackaged from the Australian and Japanese versions, was released. On 16 August 2006, Icehouse were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame alongside Midnight Oil, Divinyls and Rose Tattoo. Icehouse performed on 21 September 2007 with the line-up: Davies, Paul Gildea (guitars), Steve Morgan (bass), Peter Maslen (drums) and Glen Reither (keyboards, saxophone).

Icehouse / Flowers featured on Triple M&#x27;s 2007 Essential Countdown with 14 songs including: &quot;Great Southern Land&quot; at No. 13, &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe Any More&quot; No. 78, &quot;Street Cafe&quot; No. 187, &quot;Love in Motion&quot; No. 327, &quot;We Can Get Together&quot; No. 428, and &quot;Electric Blue&quot; No. 454.

From 15 June 2008, Davies was a judge on Seven Network TV series &quot;Battle of the Choirs&quot;. Davies commented on the status of Icehouse:

The grand final show of &quot;Battle of the Choirs&quot;, broadcast on 3 August 2008, had Icehouse provide a rare live performance of &quot;Great Southern Land&quot;. For the performance, Icehouse were Iva Davies (vocals, guitar), Paul Wheeler (drums, percussion), Paul Gildea (guitar), David Chapman (guitar), Steve Bull (bass guitar); they were supported by the three grand-finalist choirs.

On 14 March 2009, Icehouse reformed for Sound Relief benefit concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Sound Relief is a benefit concert for victims of the Victorian Bushfire Crisis and the Queensland Floods. Appearing with Icehouse at the Sydney concert were, Coldplay, Eskimo Joe, Hoodoo Gurus, Jet, Josh Pyke, Little Birdy, The Presets, Wolfmother, You Am I and additional artists.

On 4 June 2009, Icehouse performed at the Sacred Heart Mission&#x27;s &quot;Heart of St Kilda Concert&quot;. The concert featured many Australian performers such as Kate Ceberano, Joe Camilleri, Dave Hughes, Mark Seymour, Mick Molloy, Tex Perkins, Tim Rogers, Corinne Grant, Ash Grunwald and Greg Fleet. On stage with Iva Davies were Paul Gildea (guitar), Paul Wheeler (drums), Steve Morgan (bass) and Glen Reither (sax/keys).

===2011–present: &quot;Icehouse&quot; 30th anniversary, &quot;White Heat: 30 Hits&quot; and &quot;DubHouse Live&quot;===
On 6 April 2011, Icehouse and Universal Music Australia publicly announced a new partnership for sales and distribution of the band&#x27;s material. Accompanying this were details of the planned issue of a 30th-anniversary edition of the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Icehouse&quot;. This release marked the first time any of the band&#x27;s catalogue had been available for commercial download. The album was released on 20 May 2011 digitally and as a multi-disc set.

On 7 July 2011, the band issued a press release about the forthcoming release of a new greatest hits compilation, titled &quot;White Heat: 30 Hits&quot;. The album was released on 26 August 2011.

Since 2011 Icehouse started to play regular live concerts again in Australia. One of the concerts was at the December Homebake 2011 concert, performing under the moniker of &quot;Icehouse Plays Flowers&quot;, where they played songs from their first two albums (both released singles and unreleased songs) — &quot;Icehouse&quot;, &quot;We Can Get Together&quot;, &quot;Skin&quot;, &quot;Boulevard&quot;, &quot;Great Southern Land&quot; and &quot;Sister.&quot; Keith Welsh joined them on stage, playing bass-guitar.

On 12 July 2012, the entire Icehouse studio catalogue was reissued. &quot;Primitive Man&quot; and &quot;Man of Colours&quot; also received a bonus DVD to celebrate their 30th and 25th anniversaries, respectively. The band will be promoting the two anniversary albums with the &quot;Primitive Colours&quot; tour.

On 4 and 7 December, Icehouse performed two shows at the Esplanade Hotel in Melbourne and the Oxford Art Factory in Sydney, respectively, under the moniker of &quot;DubHouse performing reggae-styled versions of classic Icehouse songs and old reggae favourites&quot;. These concerts spawned the release of a live album released in January 2014. They also performed a 40th anniversary concert at the Roche Estate, in the New South Wales Hunter Valley in March 2017.

On 9 February 2020, Icehouse played at the St. Kilda Festival in Melbourne, Flowers had played the first festival in 1980, so for the 40th anniversary Icehouse played the majority of the Flowers album plus a few covers that they would have played back then, a recording of the concert was released in October 2020 as &quot;Icehouse Plays Flowers&quot;.

In 2021, a remix of &quot;Hey Little Girl&quot; was released by Australian duo Mark Vick and Danny Muller, with the record credited to The Antipodeans Vs Icehouse.

In 2022, Icehouse performed &quot;Great Southern Land&quot; and &quot;We Can Get Together&quot; at the ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup final at Melbourne Cricket Ground, Australia.

<text>Maxime Du Camp (8 February 1822 – 9 February 1894) was a French writer and photographer.

==Biography==

Born in Paris, Du Camp was the son of a successful surgeon. After finishing college, he indulged in his strong desire for travel, thanks to his father&#x27;s assets. Du Camp traveled in Europe and the East between 1844 and 1845, and again between 1849 and 1851 in company with Gustave Flaubert. After his return, Du Camp wrote about his traveling experiences. Flaubert also wrote about his experiences with Maxime.

In 1851, Du Camp became a founder of the &quot;Revue de Paris&quot; (suppressed in 1858), in which his friend Flaubert&#x27;s Madame Bovary was first published in serialised form in 1856, as well as a frequent contributor to the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;. In 1853, he became an officer of the Legion of Honour. Serving as a volunteer with Garibaldi in his 1860 conquest of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Du Camp recounted his experiences in &quot;Expédition des deux Siciles&quot; (1861). In 1870 he was nominated for the senate, but his election was frustrated by the downfall of the Empire. He was elected a member of the Académie française in 1880, mainly, it is said, on account of his history of the Commune, published under the title of &quot;Les Convulsions de Paris&quot; (1878–1880).

Du Camp was an early amateur photographer who learned the craft from Gustave Le Gray shortly prior to departing on his 1849–1859 trip to Egypt. His travel books were among the first to be illustrated with photographs.

Du Camp, the most famous traveller of his time, was the dedicatee of the final poem, &quot;Le Voyage&quot;, written in 1859, from Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Les Fleurs du Mal&quot;. Du Camp&#x27;s 1855 poetry collection, &quot;Les Chants Modernes&quot;, includes a poem titled &quot;Le Voyageur&quot;. Baudelaire&#x27;s original title for &quot;Le Voyage&quot; was &quot;Les Voyageurs&quot;. The original title has obvious echoes of Du Camp’s poem.

Maxime Du Camp died in 1894 and was buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris.

Du Camp authored a valuable 6-volume book on the daily life of Paris, &quot;Paris, ses organes, ses fonctions, sa vie dans la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle&quot; (1869–1875). He published several works on social questions, one of which, the &quot;Auteurs de mon temps&quot;, was to be kept sealed in the Bibliothèque Nationale until 1910. His &quot;Souvenirs littéraires&quot; (2 vols., 1882–1883) contain much information about contemporary writers, especially Gustave Flaubert, of whom Du Camp was an early and intimate friend. In 1878, he published an account of the Paris Commune called &quot;Les Convulsions de Paris&quot;, drawing from articles on the subject he had written for the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;.

<text>Iain David Wright (born 9 May 1972) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hartlepool from 2004 to 2017, and served also as the Chairman of Business Innovation and Skills Committee. He was previously Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for apprenticeships, and 14 to 19 reform in the Department for Children, Schools and Families until 11 May 2010.

In April 2017, he announced that he would not be seeking re election at the snap election of 2017. On 12 July 2017, fellow Labour MP Rachel Reeves succeeded Wright as Chair of the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee.

==Early life==
Wright was born in Hartlepool and graduated with a BA in 1994, and MA in 1995 in History from University College London. That year, he joined the Labour Party and was elected as an officer of Cleveland and Richmond Young Labour. He worked as a chartered accountant for Deloitte &amp; Touche from 1996 to 2003, and for the One NorthEast RDA from 2003 to 2004, prior to his election to Parliament.

He was elected as a councillor for the Rift House ward of Hartlepool Borough Council in 2002, and a served on the council&#x27;s Cabinet with responsibility for performance management.

==Parliamentary career==
He was the only Hartlepool member on the shortlist when Peter Mandelson stepped down as Labour MP for the town in September 2004, and was easily selected as the Labour Party candidate for the by election.

During the later stages of the campaign, three local members, one of whom featured in Conservative Party leaflets and another of whom had earlier failed to win the nomination, were reported in the &quot;Guardian&quot; (which subsequently endorsed Liberal Democrat rival Jody Dunn) to have been unhappy that no other local candidate had been available.

The Labour Party dismissed the claims as having come from the &quot;usual suspects&quot;. One subsequently apologised, and another was expelled.

During the campaign, Wright highlighted the Labour government&#x27;s controversial policies for tackling anti-social behaviour as well as the Liberal Democrats&#x27; refusal to support such measures in Parliament and stressed his local origins, in contrast to his main rival&#x27;s. On polling day (30 September 2004), Wright was elected with a majority of 2,033, reduced from Mandelson&#x27;s majority of 14,571.

The campaign was unusually long for British by elections, effectively having begun on 22 July (the day Peter Mandelson announced his intention to become a European Commissioner), seventy one days before polling day itself.

His first act as an MP was to actively campaign for the proposed North East Regional Assembly, in the referendum held in November 2004. The proposal for an assembly was rejected by 78% to 22%.

Wright was re elected at the 2005 General Election, with an increased majority of 7,478 votes. In June 2005, he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Health Minister Rosie Winterton, a role he resigned from on 7 September 2006.

In 2006, he became Chairman of Labour Friends of Israel. He returned to Government in July 2007, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Communities and Local Government, before moving to the Department for Children, Schools and Families in the Cabinet reshuffle of June 2009.

In May 2009, during the MP&#x27;s expenses row, Wright and fellow Labour MP Tom Watson were criticised by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; for &quot;lavishing&quot; £100,000 on a &quot;shared Central London crash pad&quot;.

Wright and Watson claimed the legal fees for buying the property and the following year claimed £1,431.46 legal fees for buying the freehold, which significantly enhanced the property value. Rules at the time did not require them to reimburse any profits made on the sale of the property.

In response, Wright said &quot;As a new MP, I purchased furniture and electrical equipment once I was in the process of purchasing a half share of a small two bedroom flat in London.&quot; His expenses for 2008 to 2009 were £136,725 and ranked 489 out of 647 MPs. 
The &quot;Legg Report&quot; stated that he was reimbursed £805.97 for an extra month mortgage interest during 2006 to 2007, which he subsequently repaid.

At the 2015 General Election, Wright&#x27;s majority was cut to 3,024 votes by UKIP candidate Phillip Broughton. On 19 June 2015, he was announced as having been elected to the chairmanship of the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee. He supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election. On 19 April 2017, he announced his intention not to stand for re election at the snap election, scheduled for Thursday 8 June 2017.

==Charity work==
Wright completed the 2011 Great North Run in aid of the Stroke Association. He joined his son Benjamin, 17, on the half marathon. The pair ran in aid of the Stroke Association, a cause which has been close to their hearts, since Ben suffered a serious stroke in 2006. Wright completed the course in his personal best time of two hours and fifty minutes, with Ben achieving a time of two hours thirty minutes.

Wright has also supported &quot;Whizz-Kidz&quot;, a charity for disabled children.

<text>Teufelsberg (; German for &quot;Devil&#x27;s Hill&quot;) is a non-natural hill in Berlin, Germany, in the Grunewald locality of former West Berlin. It rises about above the surrounding Teltow plateau and above the sea level, in the north of Berlin&#x27;s Grunewald Forest. It was named after the Teufelssee (Devil&#x27;s Lake) in its southerly vicinity. The hill is made of debris and rubble, and covers an unfinished Nazi military-technical college (Wehrtechnische Fakultät). During the Cold War, there was a U.S. listening station on the hill, Field Station Berlin. The site of the former field station is now fenced off and is currently being managed by an organisation which charges 10 euros for public access.

==History==
Teufelsberg is a non-natural hill, created in the 20 years following the Second World War by moving approximately of debris from Berlin.

After the Communist putsch in the city parliament of Greater Berlin (for all four sectors of Berlin) in September 1948, separate parliaments and magistrates (; city government) were formed for East and West Berlin. This also ended much of the cooperation between West Berlin and the state of Brandenburg, surrounding West Berlin in the North, West and South.

While part of the rubble from destroyed quarters in East Berlin was deposited outside the city boundary, all the debris from West Berlin had to be dumped within the western boundary. Due to the shortage of fuel in West Berlin, the rubble transport stopped during the Berlin Blockade.

Although there are many similar man-made rubble mounds in Germany (see Schuttberg) and other war-torn cities of Europe, Teufelsberg is unique in that the never completed Nazi military-technical college (Wehrtechnische Fakultät) designed by Albert Speer is buried beneath. The Allies tried using explosives to demolish the school, but it was so sturdy that covering it with debris turned out to be easier. In June 1950 the West Berlin Magistrate decided to open a new rubble disposal on that site. The disposal was planned for .

With the end of material shortages after the blockade, an average of 600 trucks deposited of material daily. On 14 November 1957, the ten millionth cubic metre arrived. The site was closed to dumping in 1972, leaving approximately of debris, and to a lesser extent construction waste. The Senate of (West) Berlin opted to plant greenery on the hill as a beautification project.

Teufelsberg was originally thought to be high, which placed it at the same elevation as Großer Müggelberg (the summit of Müggelberge), and was the highest point in West Berlin. New measurements show that Teufelsberg is actually high, making it higher than Großer Müggelberg.

In February 1955, a ski jump opened on the hill, designed by the ski jumper and architect Heini Klopfer. A larger ski jump opened March 4, 1962, offering space for 5,000 spectators. Ski jumping ceased in 1969, allowing the ski jumps to fall into decay. The jumps were removed in 1999.

Teufelsberg has been a location for several recent movies and television programmes, such as &quot;The Gamblers&quot;, &quot;Berlin Station&quot;, &quot;Covert Affairs&quot; (second-season episode titled &quot;Uberlin&quot;) and &quot;We Are the Night&quot; in which the finale takes place on Teufelsberg.

As in the whole of Grunewald Forest, wild boar frequently roam the hill.


==Listening station: Field Station Berlin==
The US National Security Agency (NSA) built one of its largest listening stations atop the hill in 1963, supposedly as part of the global ECHELON intelligence gathering network. &quot;The Hill&quot;, as it was known colloquially by the many American soldiers who worked there around the clock and who commuted there from their quarters in the American Sector, was located in the British Sector. In July 1961, mobile Allied listening units began operations on Teufelsberg, having surveyed various other locales throughout West Berlin in a search for the best vantage point for listening to Soviet, East German, and other Warsaw Pact nations’ military traffic. They found that operations from atop Teufelsberg offered a marked improvement in listening ability. This discovery eventually led to a large structure being built atop the hill, which would come to be run by the NSA (National Security Agency). Construction of a permanent facility was begun in October 1963. At the request of the US government, the ski lifts were removed because they allegedly disturbed the signals. The station continued to operate until the fall of East Germany and the Berlin Wall, but after that the station was closed and the equipment removed. The buildings and antenna radomes still remain in place.

During the NSA operations some other curious things happened: It was noticed that during certain seasons the reception of radio signals was better than during the rest of the year. The &#x27;culprit&#x27; was found after a while: it was the Ferris wheel of the annual German-American &quot;Volksfest&quot; Festival on the &quot;Hüttenweg&quot; in Zehlendorf. From then on, the Ferris wheel was left standing for some time after the festival was over. 

While there were rumors that the Americans had excavated a shaft down into the ruins beneath, that was never proven, and was likely based on reports that those who maintained equipment in one of the first enclosed antenna structures accessed the upper levels of the inflated dome via an airlock that led to a &quot;tunnel&quot; that was embedded in the structure&#x27;s central column. Speculation as to what might have existed within the highly restricted area frequently gave rise to rather elaborate but false rumors; one theory stated that &quot;the tunnel&quot; was an underground escape route, another that it housed a submarine base.

In the 1990s, as Berlin experienced an economic boom after German reunification, a group of investors bought the former listening station area from the City of Berlin with the intention to build hotels and apartments. There was talk of preserving the listening station as a spy museum. Berlin&#x27;s building boom produced a glut of buildings, however, and the Teufelsberg project became unprofitable. The construction project was then aborted. As of the early 2000s, there has been talk of the city buying back the hill. However, this is unlikely, as the area is encumbered with a mortgage of nearly 50 million dollars. The site has been heavily covered in graffiti since the company abandoned the project. Since 1996, the site has been privately owned and is currently fenced off from the surrounding forest. In the summer of 2016, landlord Marvin Schutte opened the site to visitors who are able to climb the listening station towers and admire the ever-evolving &quot;street art gallery&quot; that fills the site&#x27;s abandoned buildings. The site and buildings have uneven surfaces, broken glass, and building debris. Accessing the main dome involves ascending a pitch dark stairwell in the centre of the building. As of April 2017, entry to the site is €8 payable at the main entrance gate and a sign informs visitors that it is open from 10am to &quot;one hour before sunset.&quot;

Following the announcement of plans to raze the facility and reforest the hill, talk of preserving the facility resurfaced in 2009, spearheaded by the Field Station Berlin Veterans Group, which hopes to have the memorial named in honor of Major Arthur D. Nicholson, the last military Cold War casualty, the U.S. Military Liaison Mission tour officer who was shot and killed by a Russian sentry near Ludwigslust on March 24, 1985. After no further construction was done after 2004, in 2006 the hilltop was categorised as forest in the land use plan of Berlin, thereby eliminating the possibility of building.

In September 2013, U.S. Army Teufelsberg veterans marked the fiftieth anniversary (1963-2013) of the construction of the permanent buildings for Field Station Berlin atop Teufelsberg with a special commemorative issue of Cinderella stamps, and with the dedication of a commemorative plaque. The designer is T. H. E. Hill, the award-winning author of two novels about Field Station Berlin.

<doc id="883618" wikidata="Q369159" url="?curid=883618" title="Wu Ding">
<text>Wu Ding (; died ); personal name (), was a king of the Chinese Shang dynasty who ruled the central Yellow River valley . He is the earliest figure in Chinese history mentioned in contemporary records. The annals of the Shang dynasty compiled by later historians were once thought to be little more than legends until oracle script inscriptions on bones dating from his reign were unearthed at the ruins of his capital Yin (near modern Anyang) in 1899. Oracle bone inscriptions from his reign have been radiocarbon dated to 1254–1197 BC ±10 years, closely according with regnal dates derived by modern scholars from received texts, epigraphic evidence, and astronomical calculations.

Wu Ding&#x27;s reign is characterized by a prosperous period of the late Shang state, with a wide network of allies and subordinates. The first inscriptions unequivocally recognized as Chinese appeared during his reign, together with new technological innovations. More than half of Shang inscriptions date to his reign, concerning a wide variety of deities. In classical Chinese historiography, he is often depicted as a meritorious king who appears with worthy officials.

== Dating ==
Because Wu Ding is the earliest Chinese ruler whose reign is confirmed by contemporary material, dating his reign is a matter of significant historical interest.

According to the traditional chronology, he reigned from 1324 to 1266 BC. This has been shown to be an artifact of incorrect backdating due to misunderstanding of King Wen of Zhou&#x27;s Mandate calendar. In the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, Han dynasty scholar Sima Qian wrote of his reign as beginning in the year &quot;dingwei&quot; (丁未), which can be either 1333 BC or 1273 BC according to the &quot;ganzhi&quot; calendar&#x27;s 60-year repetition. The &quot;Guben Zhushu Jinian&quot; (&quot;ancient version&quot; of Bamboo Annals) gives Wu Ding&#x27;s regnal dates as 1273–1213 BC. &quot;The Cambridge History of Ancient China&quot; gives 1189 BC as the end date of his reign based on records of lunar eclipses. The Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project draft release (2000), sponsored by the Chinese government and disbanded without producing a final report, gives his reign as 1250–1192 BC. 
Inscriptions from twenty-six oracle bone divinations of his reign have been radiocarbon dated to 1254–1197 BC ±10 years. It is important to note that the methodology of the radiocarbon investigators involved accepting uncritically the purported reign length of 59 years attributed to Wu Ding in the transmitted record.

== Life and reign ==
=== Early life ===
The Shang dynasty practiced royal succession using a form of agnatic seniority, at times distributed across multiple lines of descent. In the generations preceding Wu Ding, succession had been split between the descendants of Zu Yi (祖乙) through his two sons Zu Xin (祖辛) and Qiang Jia (沃甲). This was interpreted by later historians as a weakening of an incorrectly reconstructed system of primogeniture. The Shang kings immediately preceding Wu Ding were three of his uncles (including the famous Pan Geng, who moved the capital to Huanbei) and finally his father, Xiao Yi. By the custom of the time, Xiao Yi could potentially have been succeeded by one of his second cousins from the alternate royal line. The fact that Xiao Yi was able to place his son on the throne despite the claims of a rival lineage may explain why Wu Ding built a new capital for the second time in living memory, as well as the transmitted tradition that he was sent away from the capital during his father&#x27;s reign.

He happened to be Xiao Yi&#x27;s only son, and therefore was created crown prince. The &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; carry an entry stating that in the sixth year of his father&#x27;s reign, Wu Ding was ordered to live at He () 
(ancient name for the Yellow River). Gan Pan (), a prominent minister in Xiao Yi&#x27;s court, was chosen to be Zi Zhao&#x27;s tutor. A late chapter in the &quot;Shangshu&quot; asserts that during these early years, he worked together with the local peasants. The times spent among the common people allowed Wu Ding to become familiar with their daily problems, which affected the ruling method of the future king.

=== King of the Shang dynasty ===

In Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Shiji&quot; he was listed as the twenty-second Shang king. Oracle bone script inscriptions unearthed at Yinxu alternatively record that he was the twenty-first Shang king. The &quot;Shiji&quot; says that he was enthroned with Yin () as his capital.

Although his ruling period was characterized with wars, traditional Chinese historiography still portrayed him as a virtuous monarch who showed great care to his country. Chapter XXI of the Book of Documents describes him remaining silent in the beginning of his reign as to cultivate his virtue. According to the text, Wu Ding restrained himself from speaking even after his three-year mourning for his father&#x27;s death (during which all the state affairs were discussed and managed by his court ministers) had ended:

(By referring to the anecdote, classical historians have emphasized on his righteousness, filial piety and the desire to be an upright ruler like his predecessors.)

According to the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;, in the twenty-fifth year of his reign, his son Zu Ji () died at a remote area after being exiled.

==== Participation in Shang religious activities ====

Later Chinese historians when referring to him tended to stress on him attending ceremonies through romanticized anecdotes. According to the &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, in the twenty-ninth year of his reign, he conducted rituals in honour of his ancestor Da Yi (), the first king of the Shang dynasty, at the Royal Temple. When he saw a crowing pheasant on one of the ceremonial bronze vessels, he became frightened and considered it an ominous omen. Zu Ji, who was accompanying his father during the rituals, is said to have wanted to advocate religious modifications. Following this thought, Zu decided to discuss the omen with his father. He was quoted as saying: 
Wu Ding was actively involved in divination and sacrifice. The king, with the assistance of his priests, was responsible for a large proportion of oracle bone divinations found at Yin. Wu Ding specifically divined about his queen, both when she was alive and after her departure. In particular, one inscription on Fu Hao&#x27;s being pregnant said that the conception was &quot;inauspicious&quot; (that the child was a girl). Aside from pregnancy, he also divined on her health, prosperity, as well as praying for her in the afterlife. (He is believed to have married her three more times to his ancestors, since he believed they would act as her guardians after death). He also asked divinatory questions on human sacrifice as well as warfare. He also seemed to be in awe of his ancestors, especially his second uncle Pan Geng. He regularly wrote questions on weathers, agricultural issues for his deceased predecessors, and he held a thought that they were capable of indirectly supporting his army in battles. Moreover, Pan Geng was specifically perceived to be involved in his nephew&#x27;s health. One example based on contemporary records is a reconstructed ceremony by Keightley, which aimed to seek improvement for Wu&#x27;s dental problems. In the ritual, Wu Ding offered one dog and one sheep to Pan Geng and tried to convince him to treat his toothache.

Oracle bones often include the names of diviners. Wu Ding particularly divined exceptionally many times; numerous bone texts feature the king himself as the chief diviner. He interpreted the cracks on oracle bones to predict future events, of which four notable examples are:

*Crack-making divination on the day &quot;guiwei&quot;: Wu&#x27;s assistants predicted no disaster, but he divined that the near future would be misfortune. It is purportedly said that six days after, a relative of Wu died. The relative was possibly Zu Ji, although the texts do not specify his identity. He allegedly died in &quot;wuzi&quot; day of the First Month.
*Another time, he interpreted the signs as negative. It is said that eight days later, the Sun was covered by large clouds, and a rainbow appeared in the Yellow River.
*Divinations on wars and territorial defense: on the day &quot;guisi&quot;, Wu Ding predicted the opposite future from his diviners that confrontational polities were going to launch attacks on his border. In the day &quot;dingyou&quot;, it is believed that bad news came from the West by an entrusted regional lord, Guo. The lord reported that Tu Fang had attacked the territory and destroyed two towns, and another tribe had taken over the kingdom&#x27;s western fields. However, this is somewhat contradictory, since Tu Fang supposedly mobilized its men from the east, contrary to their being located northwestern of Yin.
*A prognostication of disasters gave the outcome that one of Wu Ding&#x27;s accompanying ministers would fall off his chariot during a hunting expedition. The misfortune occurred on &quot;jiawu&quot; day, when the king was seeking for a rhinoceros. Two people, one of his &quot;xiaochen&quot; (petty minister) and his child fell off their chariots.

The divinations of the scribes often included the prediction of fortune in a certain period (usually a Shang week). An ox scapula records the divinations by Zhēng (爭), one of the Bīn (賓) group of diviners serving Wu Ding. On the piece of bone, four separated divinations were carved (either by the king or Zheng himself):

*On the top: 卜，☐，貞[旬]亡𡆥。&quot;... divined: In the next ten days (week), there will be no disasters.&quot;
*On the left: 癸卯卜，爭，貞旬亡𡆥。甲辰☐大掫風，之曰皿，乙巳[疛]𰙫(止幸)☐五人。五月在[𦎧]。 &quot;guǐmǎo (day 40) Zheng divined: in the next ten days there will be no disasters. jiǎchén (day 41) ... strong gale, evening cleaved to yǐsì (day 42), captured ... five people. Fifth month, in Dun.&quot;
*On the middle: 癸丑卜，爭，貞旬亡𡆥。王(占)曰：有祟，有夢。甲寅，允有來艱。左告曰：有往芻自(皿)，十人又二。 &quot;guǐchǒu (day 50) Zheng divined: in the next ten days there will be no disasters.&quot; The character 王 (king) indicates the personal involvement of Wu Ding in this specific divination. Wu Ding added to Zheng&#x27;s conclusion that there would be ominous spirits, and on the day &quot;jiayin&quot; there would be obstacles.
*On the right: 癸丑卜，爭，貞旬亡𡆥。三日乙卯[有](壴女)艱，單邑豊[尿]于彔...丁已貍子豊尿...鬼亦得疾。 &quot;guǐchǒu (day 50) Zheng divined: in the next ten days there will be no disasters. Third day, yǐmǎo (day 52) ... dīngsì (day 54) ... Gui will also have sickness.&quot;

Wu Ding&#x27;s royal family, predictably, also played a part in religious practice. They appeared to have been granted their own authorization of exercising power as priests, and some oracle texts carved by the assistants might have been made in the service of the princes. The majority (70%) of oracle characters date back to Wu Ding&#x27;s reign, which indicates his emphasis on the religion.

=== First chancellor Gan Pan ===

It is believed that two individuals were chosen as administrative chancellors by this king. Several texts state that after becoming king, Wu Ding appointed his former tutor, Gan Pan (甘盘), as the chief minister at his court. Gan began to arrange military formations of the country while also acting as an adviser to the new ruler. In the work &quot;Shangshu Zhengyi&quot;, Kong Anguo mentioned Gan Pan as an exemplary minister that could be compared with Yi Yin. The Book of Documents makes the same analogy in its chapter on the Duke of Shao, who would act as one of the Three Regents under King Cheng of Zhou approximately 250 years after Gan Pan. In the text, the Duke of Zhou is quoted as delivering a lesson about Shang meritorious officials that ought to be viewed as models of loyal and capable ministers:

=== Second chancellor Fu Yue ===

According to Kong Anguo&#x27;s source, Gan Pan died shortly after Wu Ding inherited the throne. After his death, the chancellor position was replaced by Fu Yue (傅說) (alternatively called Fu Shuo). The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; and the &quot;Shangshu&quot; contain paragraphs mentioning the story of Wu Ding encountering Fu Yue. According to the source, Wu Ding was informed by Heaven that he would receive a man named &quot;Yue&quot; who would assist him in governing the country. After waking up, he consulted his court but no one recognized the man. Therefore, he produced a painting of the man from his memory and dispatched his troops to seek for the person. Yue was found as a worker at a defense construction; his appearance was said to perfectly match the description of the desired person. Seeing that Yue was intelligent and learned, Wu Ding appointed him as his chancellor and gave him the surname &quot;Fu&quot;.

It is indicated that Fu Yue was potentially a historical character. Based on information on the oracle bones, historians have constructed a list of ten court officials at the time of Wu Ding&#x27;s reign: Gan Pan, Hou Que, Wangcheng, Jun He, Jichen, Jian, Qin Dian, Xi Li Zhi, Cang Hou Hu, Hou Gao. It is thought that Fu Yue was likely to be identical to Hou Que: in fact, several oracle bones describing Hou Que handling affairs that were very similar to those of Fu Yue mentioned in the Tsinghua Bamboo Slips as well as other texts. Hou Que, similar to the romanticized Fu Yue, had an important part in Wu Ding&#x27;s assistants. (The list, however, remains controversial because necessary information about many of the ten individuals included are yet to be found.)

=== Regional lords ===

As Wu Ding achieved greatly in his expansion schemes, his rule was established on a much larger area than that of his ancestors. However, the king&#x27;s control of regions that were farther from Yin was practically nominal. Ruling from modern-day Anyang, the monarch was unable to protect the most vulnerable lands of his state. The primitive conditions of transportation also proved an obstacle to his ability to immediately respond to urgent situations in remote lands. That led to the fact that he had to resort to the strategy of sharing power with other people. He divided the country into portions which served as autonomous lands. Unlike the central governing body which only included a certain number of people who controlled court affairs and central military, regional administration was performed by numerous local lords of varied backgrounds. They were given personal lands and expected to give tributes, portions of harvest, and military support to the Shang monarch, a practice similar to the system used by later dynastic regimes. Obedient lords were accepted as trustable allies of the central government and were given nobility titles. A notable chief is Guo of Zhi, mentioned several times in contemporary texts; he was apparently an ally and a chief of Wu Ding&#x27;s distant lands. In two inscriptions, Guo of Zhi is recorded to have merged his local troops into the central army, which-at that time commanded by Wu-was mobilizing to battle.

== Military campaigns ==

=== Military structure and equipment ===

Although little is known about military arrangements during the king&#x27;s reign, their armies contributed significantly to the kingdom&#x27;s warfare and defense. The central government disposed of 3 regiments: zhongshi (中師), zuoshi (左師), youshi (右師). These were used to defend the royal domain as well as secure the new territories gained. In order to defend border regions, the royal troops (wangshi 王師, woshi 我師) were sent and garrisoned in remote regions. Wu Ding&#x27;s court also had military conscriptions reserved for dangers. They were called &quot;deng&quot; (登) or &quot;zheng&quot; (征) (conscripts), and were trained to react to urgent situations such as enemies&#x27; attack of the capital. However, such conscriptions were still rare during the Shang dynasty, and records of them are few. The royal force numbered at thousands and were militaristically trained during royal hunts. The royal servants were able to be promoted to official positions by taking part in battles.

The Shang armed forces employ a wide range of weapons and supporting equipment. Troops had both bone and bronze weapons, including máo (矛) spears, yuè (鉞) pole-axes, gē (戈) pole-based dagger-axes, composite bows. At the time of Wu Ding, bronze weapons became widely distributed in the kingdom, both in the capital and provincial regions; in the preceding periods, they appeared in smaller numbers. Weapons found in Shang royal 
tombs reveal an advanced bronze metallurgy that makes the instruments more useful in utilization than in the reign of previous rulers. Soldiers also possessed defensive instruments such as bronze and leather helmets. The presence of chariots in Wu Ding&#x27;s period gave the forces an advantage over other chiefdoms and tribes. According to literary sources, a chariot was drawn by more than one horse, and accompany 3 people with swords, halberds, and bows.

=== Major expansions ===

Oracle bone inscriptions dating back to Wu Ding mention a wide range of unstable connections with tribes and chiefdoms, generally addressed as &quot;fang&quot; (方). Oracle bone scripts record that the Shang dynasty maintained contact with Guifang (), a chiefdom northwest of Yin that was sometimes interpreted as &quot;unfriendly&quot; to the central region. According to the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;, the thirty-second year of Wu&#x27;s reign, he sent troops to counter Guifang, stationing the army at Jing (荊). After three years of fighting, he conquered it and annexed it into the kingdom, turning Guifang into his supporters in expeditions against other foes.

In the eastern neighboring regions, the state of Dapeng () had been a vassal of the Shang dynasty since the early 14th century BC. This was a notable autonomous region of the kingdom that lay in the eastern direction relative to Yin. According to traditional texts, the first ruler of Dapeng was given the title &quot;hou&quot; by Wu Ding&#x27;s ancestors. During the previous kings&#x27; reign, the region is recorded to have maintained a relationship with Shang through rare tributes. However, during Wu Ding&#x27;s period, Dapeng began to show hostilities towards the suzerainty held by the Shang king. In the forty-third year of his reign ( 1200 BC), Wu Ding waged war on Dapeng and annexed the territory into the kingdom. Seven years later, his army went on to conquer Tunwei ().

=== Relations with Predynastic Zhou ===

During Wu Ding&#x27;s reign, the western regions (west of the western &quot;fang&quot; tribes) were inhabited by the Ji clan, predecessor of the Zhou dynasty. The center of the chiefdom had been Bin (modern Xunyi County) for thousands of years, located very far from Wu Ding&#x27;s seat in Yin. It was not fully brought under Shang suzerainty, but instead maintained a loose connection with the Shang kings. Wu Ding&#x27;s reign had considerably more inscriptions about Predynastic Zhou than later periods, concerning Zhou soldiers&#x27; welfare, inquiries on Zhou hunts. On the other hand, Wu Ding never visit Zhou territory to tour or hunt. He also did not order Zhou manpower to aid Shang&#x27;s public construction works and wars. Furthermore, despite his concerns about Zhou people&#x27;s prosperity, he made no questions and divinations about whether their harvests were successful.

Predynastic Zhou did not actually participate in any expansion schemes of Wu Ding, and they also did not show discontent with the court (oracle bones dating back to Wu Ding do not show any signs of military conflicts between the chiefdom and his court). Only after 1200 BC, the Ji leaders began to involve themselves more in their relationship with the last Shang kings.

=== Southern wars ===

Wu Ding&#x27;s campaigns in the southern areas include his conflict with the Hufang (虎方), a Jingman tribe located between the Han River Basin and Huai River Basin. During his reign, the general and official Wangcheng (望乘) was ordered to command a force to engage with Hufang. The army arrived at the Yangtze River&#x27;s bank, in what is now between Suizhou and Jingshan (Hubei), and launched an offense via Gui (now Zigui County). The Hu Fang tribe, upon being attacked, surrendered to Wangcheng without much resistance. Subsequently, their land was merged into Shang&#x27;s southern territory.

Oracle bone inscriptions rarely mention a southern polity that was hostile to Wu Ding. He expanded his rule further south than his predecessors had done. Several tribes submitted themselves under Shang rule and acted as supportive forces in its northwestern wars.

Roughly seventy-five percent of human sacrifices of Shang dynasty excavated at Yinxu date back to his reign. This shows his great military successes, since Shang human sacrifices consisted mostly of prisoners of war. Since Shang dynasty practiced slavery, the captured peoples that were not executed for sacrificial ceremonies were shown little mercy and forced to work for the king. For example, the Qiang slaves were expected to prepare oracle bones for diviners in coming ceremonies.

=== War with other peoples ===

The Shang dynasty was contemporary to civilization in parts of Sichuan, located considerably distant from major Shang cities like Yin and Zhengzhou. Traditional histories say that the region was home to two states, Ba and Shu. Ba was an ancient confederation of tribes, and its history extended back to the middle of the 2nd millennium BC. The state had recorded relations with Wu Ding&#x27;s kingdom around the 13th century BC, although the relation was mostly conflicts. The oracle bones documented on the division of Shang army attacking Ba. The Shang forces, numbered up to thirteen thousand, were led by Xi Li Zhi and Hou Gao, under the commands of Fu Hao. One of the battles with Ba was a large-scale ambush schemed by the Shang, the first one ever recorded in Chinese history. However, Ba seemed to be unaffected by Wu Ding&#x27;s influence, and it continued to be independent after his wars (the presence of Ba as an independent state during the Zhou dynasty proves that the state did not belong to the Shang).

==Significant events==
The earliest version of Chinese writing, Oracle bone script (; &quot;jiaguwen&quot;), found on tortoise plastrons and ox scapulae, was unearthed at the royal tombs in Yinxu. Wu Ding was the earliest monarch at that Shang capital. The contents are divinatory questions on war, human sacrifice, and national economy. The scripts are found to have almost all principles of modern Chinese writing, which suggests a previous period of development. Another major type of Shang writing, bronze inscriptions (&quot;jinwen&quot; 金文), also came into use the same time as their bone counterpart. Shang bronze script was used in a smaller extent than oracle scripts, especially in Wu Ding&#x27;s reign when only a few characters were cast on cerremonial vessels. They often contain information about family names and personal names of the individual being honored.

Wu Ding&#x27;s reign is the latest point at which chariots entered China. They were acquired as a mature technology through interactions with nomadic tribes in Central Asia and the Northern Steppe (probably a branch of the then-Proto-Indo-European peoples), and used for royal hunts and military command. Contemporary oracle bone inscriptions of the character 車 depict a chariot-like two wheeled vehicle with a single pole for the attachment of horses. Many Shang chariots were eventually interred with royal family members in tombs. The Shang chariots, despite their limited utilization in tactical combats, remain prevalent throughout the Shang period and early Zhou era.

Astronomy in China traces its origin back to Wu Ding&#x27;s time. Since the 13th century BC, numerous stars (that were later categorized) have been recorded on oracle bones at Anyang. The system of &quot;xiu&quot; (宿, lit.&quot;mansion&quot;) that played an important role in ancient astronomy also appeared during his reign. It is commonly thought that the earliest examples of calendrical use also appeared along with astronomy. The Shang calendar, which served to organize days, appeared from the start of literacy. It arranges ten days into a week, a feature that was used by the royal house to schedule sacrifices. Calendrical use later attracted a religious or magical focus.

Bronze technology underwent a significant change starting from the late Shang era, whose beginning is taken from the reign of Wu. Quantity and quality of the products increased drastically. The most notable utilizations of them are war uses and tomb furnishings; the latter reflects a parallel between advancement in bronze weaponry and the sociopolitical development seen from Wu Ding&#x27;s reign onward. Large numbers of bronze weapons were excavated in tombs, suggesting the affluency and wealthy lives of the nobility. In terms of warfare, qualified bronzemaking settled differences between Wu Ding&#x27;s armies and their rivals, which enabled him to extend both influence and land area. Along with the bronze products, the writing that was inscribed on them provides insights into the &quot;artisan&quot; class who made the bronze. Bronze scripts indicate that they enjoyed certain privileges, and had a defined occupation that was separated from the common people.

==Women in government==
At the time of Wu Ding&#x27;s accession to the throne, women had a greater role to play in the exercise of official power than in subsequent Chinese culture. This is mainly due to the fact that the Shang was not influenced by Confucian ideologies which only appeared 700 years after Wu Ding (although its succession traditions preferred masculine children to feminine ones similar to Confucianism). The most prominent females in Shang dynasty were verified to have lived during his period. Most of them acquired power through marriage to the king. Wu Ding&#x27;s spouses participated in warfare and divination, worshipping the Shang celestial ancestor &quot;Shangdi&quot; (), along with participation in managing the kingdom&#x27;s agricultural-based economy.

=== Fu Hao ===

Fu Hao, the queen consort, was recorded in oracle bones as a renowned military commander. Being skilled in warfare, she was trusted by her husband and was appointed a general. She held various campaigns against several groups in the west of Shang territory. At its peak, the forces of Fu Hao reached over 13,000 troops, headed by herself and subordinate generals. The force helped Shang dynasty conquer many opposing tribes and further expand their territory.

Although Fu Hao raised and commanded troops on behalf of Wu Ding, she did not have her own army or independent base of power like a vassal chieftain might. Nevertheless, she was Wu Ding&#x27;s favorite consort, being mentioned the most among the large number of his wives. Fu Hao&#x27;s militaristic operations was dictated by divinatory inquiries, which decides her army&#x27;s mobilization. For example, a divination says: Cheng divined: &quot;Fu Hao shall follow Guo of Zhi to attack the enemy. The King shall attack Zhonglu from the East to where Fu Hao shall be.&quot; Another text reads: &quot;The King should not order Fu Hao to follow Guo, [because] we will not perhaps receive enough support.&quot;

Along with warfare, it is known that the queen also played a religious role as a priestess. She was allowed to take part in ceremonies, sacrifices, and divination with Wu Ding&#x27;s diviners. She featured herself in human sacrifices, as the humans killed were often prisoners taken from her post-war opponents. Some oracle bones contain graphics depicting her organizing executions of captured enemy for ancestor sacrifices. As a priestess, she was one of very few women in Shang China who had full literacy. Many paragraphs on oracle bones happen to feature her as the diviner.
When Fu Hao died ( 1200 BC), Wu Ding had a famous tomb built for her, the Tomb of Fu Hao, located at Yin. Inside the tomb archaeologists found numerous Shang vessels, mirrors, bronze artifacts, weapons (probably to honour her contributions to warfare), as well as sacrificial remains of sixteen humans and six dogs. The size of the construction was that of a room, indicating the importance of the queen and showing Wu Ding&#x27;s favor towards her. Fu Hao&#x27;s body remains itself was believed to have been buried in a lacquered coffin that has long been rotten away. There also seems to have once been a structure built over the tomb for holding memorial ceremonies. Posthumously, she was given the temple name Mu Xin () by the subsequent generation of kings and Bi Xin () thereafter. She was one of three of Wu Ding&#x27;s wives to receive sacrifices in the later Shang ritual cycle.

=== Other women ===

Another of Wu Ding&#x27;s wives, Fu Jing (referred to in oracle bones as &quot;Biwu&quot; ), was probably responsible for overseeing agricultural production, as this was the subject she divined about most frequently. She also received a royal burial in Yin and was interred in Tomb 260. Unfortunately, the tomb was found to have been looted by grave robbers. Evidence from oracle bones indicates at least 60 female individuals (Wu Ding&#x27;s spouses) who contributed to the court, mainly through military achievements. Nevertheless, their marriages seemed to be only for political purposes; Fu Jing and Fu Hao were the most active females among them and were recorded the most. Wu Ding&#x27;s daughter, Princess Zi Tao (子妥) also received similar privileges. Her father enfeoffed her as a noble, and she acted as a local lord of her fief, paying tributes to the central government regularly. She was additionally promoted to the rank of a minister, &quot;xiao chen&quot; (小臣) (&quot;humble servant&quot;; hence her alternative name &quot;Xiao Chen Tao&quot;), which in turn allowed her to participate in court discussions and political actions. Her enfranchisement is not detailed but has been proof of the Shang&#x27;s reverence of women.

==Family==

*Father: Xiao Yi (小乙),personal name Zi Lian (子敛). Recorded on oracle bones as the 20th Shang king. Nivison proposed that he succeeded the throne on &quot;xinwei&quot;, 26 January 1263 BC.
*Mother: Oracle bone scripts mention the name of one of Xiao Yi&#x27;s wives as Bi Geng (妣庚): &quot;小乙配妣庚&quot; (Xiao Yi married Bi Geng). She might or might not be Wu Ding&#x27;s mother.
Uncles:
*Yang Jia (陽甲), personal name Zi He (子和). 17th Shang king. Reigned from &quot;jiazi&quot;, 23 January 1298 BC according to Nivison.
*Pan Geng (盘庚), personal name Zi Xun (子旬). 18th Shang king. Reigned from &quot;gengyin&quot;, 17 January 1292 BC.
*Xiao Xin (小辛), personal name Zi Song (子颂). 19th Shang king. Reigned from &quot;xinchou&quot;, 22 January 1268 BC.
Consorts: 
*Fu Hao (婦好), died 1200 BC, posthumous temple name Mu Xin (母辛). One of the primary consorts that are known as queens.
*Fu Jing (婦妌), known for overseeing millet farming. Also, a queen like Fu Hao.
*Fu Jie (妇嬕) or Fu Gui (妣癸). The third primary queen consort.
*There were more than 60 other consorts, many of which were titled &quot;Fu&quot; (lit. &quot;priest&quot;, &quot;wife&quot;). Some of those recorded by oracle bones include Fu Bi (妇嫀), Fu Zhou (妇周), Fu Chu (妇楚), Fu Zhi (妇蛭), Fu Qi (妇杞), Fu Zheng (妇妊), Fu Pang (妇庞), Fu Tuo (妇妥).
Children:
*Zu Ji (祖己), personal name Zi Jie (子卩), initially crown prince but died young.
*Zu Geng (祖庚), personal name Zi Yue (子曜), son of Fu Gui. Appointed as crown prince, officially received the title &quot;Xiaowang&quot; (Expectant King) after Zu Ji&#x27;s death and later became the 22nd Shang king.
*Zu Jia (祖甲), personal name Zi Zai (子載). Succeeded Zu Geng to be the 23rd Shang king. 
*Xiao Chen Tao (小臣妥), personal name Zi Tao (子妥) (died during Geng Ding&#x27;s regnal era). Wu Ding&#x27;s daughter.

A large store of well-preserved turtle plastrons with inscriptions was discovered in 1991 at a place called Huayuanzhuang (outside the palaces at Yin). The initial &quot;owner&quot; of the plastrons appeared to be a male relative of Wu Ding. The oracle texts mention Wu Ding and Fu Hao visiting the prince frequently, which suggests his close relations with the king himself. The person was similarly licensed to carry out divinations: several texts in the found plastrons contain future foretellings. One divination records his inquiries about the central governments&#x27; decisions: in the day &quot;xinwei&quot;, the Prince asked whether Wu Ding would send Fu Hao to launch offensive campaigns or not.

=== Burial of royal relatives ===

All the members in Wu Ding&#x27;s family, except Fu Hao, were buried in the royal cemetery at Xibeigang. Half of his relatives, including his father and sons, were buried in the West zone of Xibeigang. Meanwhile, his uncles and wives&#x27;s tombs were constructed in the East zone. It is known that the two zones were separated by Wu Ding, who was the first king and the head of the &quot;late Shang&quot;. He founded the West zone for his future successors&#x27; burial, apart from the section for his predecessors. Ancestor rituals that honored kings before Wu Ding were conducted in the East zone. Investigating tombs in both sections, archaeologists have identified specific tombs that contained the royal family&#x27;s corpses. Three tombs, numbered 1550, 1400 and 1004, belong to the late Wu Ding era and are the most convincingly identified graves (that archaeologists are certain about the persons who were buried in). The study of the tombs&#x27; relative locations to each other suggests that the construction planners designed them so that respect was paid to several individuals.

==Death and succession==

=== Attempts in determining death year ===

He died in the fifty-ninth year of his reign according to all the sources available, none of which are contemporary. His year of death is unknown. Opinions vary from 1197 BC to 1180 BC, with the commonly accepted year being 1192 BC (the year proposed by the defunct Xia-Shang-Zhou Chronology Project). Many attempts to find his exact death year have used varied methods. One of the prevalent ones is to use astronomical records in dating. Oracle bone inscriptions from Wu Ding&#x27;s reign mention lunar eclipses, of which those from 1199 BC to 1180 BC are usually associated with his death. The celestial phenomena were often linked to the Shang king&#x27;s destiny: in fact, during the eclipse series, Wu Ding was recorded in oracle bones as having already declined in health. David Keightley studied four oracle bones that record eclipses, and suggested various death years. David Nivison, using Keightley&#x27;s results, ruled out the possibility of a 1180 BC death, claiming that that year actually refers to an eclipse in 1201 BC. He concluded that Wu Ding died in 1189 BC, during which the corrected period&#x27;s last eclipse happened. This conclusion is reached by counting Wu Ding&#x27;s 3 years of filial mourning as separated from his 59-year reign. The factor is not considered in the 1192 BC approximation.

=== Burial ===

The king&#x27;s place of burial is uncertain. However, there is one site that is very likely to be his grave, Tomb 1400 (located in Xibeigang&#x27;s East zone). The most obvious evidence lies in its location: it was built to be near his consort Fu Jing&#x27;s grave. Wu Ding&#x27;s tomb&#x27;s construction layout later became a symbol of glory and the height of power. In the last years of the 12th century BC, his descendants tended to commission their graves identical to his. The notable example is Wen Wu Ding, Wu Ding&#x27;s 5th-generation descendant (and one of his admirer, who took his regnal name to be a component of his own). His actions took place when the Shang dynasty had been experiencing sharp declines; therefore, they have been perceived as attempts to revitalize power using connecting the ruler with his most exemplary ancestors.

===Honor and succession issues===
Widely regarded in later tradition as one of the greatest kings of the Shang dynasty, he was given the name Wu Ding () in accordance with the sexagenary cycle. As to comply with the religious tradition of worshipping royal ancestors in the day which the ancestors were named after, he was honoured by subsequent kings on the &quot;ding&quot; day. He additionally received the temple name &quot;Gaozong&quot; and later posthumously titled &quot;Xiangwang&quot;. Following his passing away, he was given a royal funeral and buried in the Shang cemetery. Having become a deified being in Shang pantheon, he was addressed as &quot;Grandfather Ding&quot; and &quot;Ancestor Ding&quot; by subsequent generations and was offered numerous sacrifices.

After Wu&#x27;s passing away, the Shang throne&#x27;s rule of succession was changed. His successors happened to be his offspring, who were namely his three documented sons. Following his death, his child Zi Yue (子曜) became the next Shang king and was later known by the regnal name Zu Geng (). Zu Geng, according to Nivison, succeeded Wu Ding in 1188 BC. The Bamboo Annals fixes Zu&#x27;s succession at the beginning of the year &quot;renshen&quot;, which most probably lied on January or February 1188 BC. The year began with a ding day; according to Shang traditional naming, Zu Geng could not use his father&#x27;s regnal name. Instead, he used the stem &quot;geng&quot;, the first day of the first year after his mourning preamble (1185 BC).

<doc id="883619" wikidata="Q722912" url="?curid=883619" title="Willem van de Velde the Elder">
<text>Willem van de Velde the Elder (1610/11 – 13 December 1693) was a Dutch Golden Age seascape painter, who produced many precise drawings of ships and ink paintings of fleets, but later learned to use oil paints like his son.

==Biography==
Willem van de Velde, known as the Elder, a marine draughtsman and painter, was born in Leiden, the son of a Flemish skipper, Willem Willemsz. van de Velde, and is commonly said to have been bred to the sea. He married Judith Adriaens van Leeuwen in Leiden in 1631.

His three known legitimate children were named Magdalena, born 1632; Willem, known as the Younger, also a marine painter, born 1633 in Leiden; and Adriaen, a landscape painter, baptized in 1636 in Amsterdam. Meanwhile the family lived Korte Koningstraat, close to the harbour, an area known as the Lastage.

His marriage was stormy, at least in its later years. David Cordingly relates that Willem the Elder fathered two children out of wedlock in 1653, one “by his maidservant, and the other by her friend. Nine years later the Elder and his wife went through a legal separation, ‘on account of legal disputes and the most violent quarrels’. The immediate cause of the dispute was his affair with a married woman.” Michael S. Robinson noted that “on 17/27 July 1662, he and his wife agreed to part. A condition of the separation was that the Elder could recover from his son Adriaen ‘two royal gifts’, presumably gifts from Charles II for work done in England.” Cordingly’s account further relates that the dispute was still continuing after another ten years, since “in the autumn of 1672 Judith complained to the woman’s husband.” Robinson adds that by 1674 the couple “must have been reconciled”, for at a chance meeting with Pieter Blaeu in Amsterdam in July the Elder explained that he was only visiting for a few days “in order to fetch his wife”. His son, Adriaen, had died in Amsterdam early 1672, and Willem the Elder was also fetching his grandson, similarly named Adriaen, who was then aged two.

After his move to England, the exact date of which is uncertain, but reportedly at the end of 1672 or beginning of 1673, he is said to have lived with his family in East Lane, Greenwich, and to have used the Queen&#x27;s House, now part of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, as a studio. Following the accession of William III and Mary II as King and Queen of England, it appears that this facility was no longer provided, and by 1691 he was living in Sackville Street, now close to Piccadilly Circus. He died in London, and was buried in St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly, at the south end of the street. A memorial to him and his son lies with in the church.

==Professional career==
He was the official artist of the Dutch fleet for a period, being present at the Four Days Battle, 1–4 June 1666, and the St James&#x27;s Day Battle, 25 July 1666, to make sketches. In his work on the biographies of artists, Arnold Houbraken quotes Gerard Brandt&#x27;s biography of Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, relating the anecdote where Willem van de Velde asked Admiral de Ruyter permission to have a galley row him around for a good view of the proceedings on the evening of the Four Days battle in 1666. He wasn&#x27;t the only artist to paint the scenes of this battle, his son, Ludolf Bakhuysen and Pieter Cornelisz van Soest also made paintings of it.
This act later was the reason that van Velde gained his marine commission in London. The date, 1672, commonly given for his entry into the service of Charles II of England, was at a time when the Dutch Republic was at war with England (Third Anglo-Dutch War).

According to the inventory Bartholomeus van der Helst owned or stored many paintings by Van de Velde. They lived close to each other (near Nieuwmarkt) and must have been friends.

<doc id="883623" wikidata="Q270018" url="?curid=883623" title="Fu Hao">
<text>Fu Hao () died 1200 BC, posthumous temple name Mu Xin (), was one of the many wives of King Wu Ding of the Shang dynasty and also served as a military general and high priestess. Minimal evidence detailing Fu Hao&#x27;s life and military achievements survived the Shang dynasty, and the records may have perished over the course of time.

The Tomb of Fu Hao was unearthed intact in 1976 at Yinxu by archaeologist Zheng Zhenxiang, with treasures - known as her 700+ jade objects (Fu Hao was a collector, so some were already antiques), and also her collection of more than 500 bone objects, such as oracle bones (they were from her role as a religious priestess, and were used in her many rituals). Along with the jade and bone objects, Fu Hao was buried with 6 dogs, and 16 human sacrifices. Inside the pit was evidence of a wooden chamber long, wide and high containing a lacquered wooden coffin that has since completely disintegrated. The tomb of Fu Hao provides the most insight into her life, her relationship with the royal family, and her military role and achievements - as the objects she was buried with provide clues to her activities and interests.

==Biography==
What is known is that King Wu Ding cultivated the allegiance of neighbouring tribes by marrying one woman from each of them. Fu Hao (who was believed to be one of the king&#x27;s 64 wives) entered the royal household through such a marriage and took advantage of the semi-matriarchal slave society to rise through the ranks to become one of King Wu Ding&#x27;s three consorts. She may have come from the border or from the Steppe, as suggested by the assortment of weapons in her tomb.

The other two wives were Fu Jing () and Fu Shi (). Fu Jing was the primary queen while Fu Hao was the secondary queen. Fu Hao was also the mother of Prince Zu Ji. Oracle bone inscriptions show concern for her well-being at the time of the birth.

The activities of priestess and ritual matters of China only exist in the Shang dynasty, so some evidence is vague. Since each Chinese character like &quot;Fu&quot; () often has variable meanings, even with the oracle bones of Shang deciphered, it is possible that women like Fu Hao were originally priestesses instead of the king&#x27;s wives; she just happened to marry the king later. That is to say, the meaning of &quot;wife&quot; in some contexts may actually refer to a position as priestess.

Fu Hao owned her land. According to the oracle bones, she offered the king remarkably valuable tributes many times. Although the Shang king had control over ritual matters, which constituted the most important political activity of the day, oracle bone inscriptions show that Wu Ding repeatedly instructed Fu Hao to conduct the most special rituals and to offer sacrifices to the ancestors. The Shang dynasty had two most important activities: ritual matters and battles; Lady Hao played extraordinary roles in both at that time.

== Military role ==
Fu Hao is known to modern scholars mainly from inscriptions on Shang dynasty oracle bone artifacts unearthed at Yinxu. From these inscriptions and from the presence of weapons in her tomb, it can be determined that Fu Hao was a general in charge of several military campaigns for the Shang dynasty.

In her military role, she was responsible for conquering enemies and neighbours of the Shang dynasty. The Tufang () had fought against the Shang for generations until they were finally defeated by Fu Hao in a single decisive battle. Further campaigns against the neighbouring Yi, Qiang and Ba followed; the latter is particularly remembered for being the earliest recorded large-scale ambush in Chinese history. With up to 13,000 soldiers and important generals Zhi and Hou Gao serving under her, she was the most powerful Shang general of her time.

This highly unusual status is confirmed by the many weapons, including great battle-axes, unearthed in her tomb.

While Fu Hao&#x27;s achievements were notable and unique, other women in this period were also active in military roles; in a similar manner Fu Jing was also thought to have served in the military based on the presence of many weapons and military equipment in her tomb. Oracle bones also revealed records of at least six hundred women participating in the military during this era.

==Tomb==
Remarkably, after her death Fu Hao was buried in a tomb on her land across the river from the main royal cemetery, even though usually the royal families were buried together. She died well in advance of King Wu Ding, who constructed her tomb at his capital Yin.

Because of its location, Lady Hao&#x27;s tomb is the only royal Shang tomb to have been left unnoticed and unlooted, giving unique insights into her life and the burial practices of the time. The King later made many sacrifices there in hopes of receiving her spiritual assistance in defeating the attacking Gong, who threatened to wipe out the Shang completely. This shows his great favor towards Hao and after her death, he had her married to the three greatest kings before him. The tomb was unearthed by archaeologists in 1976 and is now open to the public.

The tomb itself was only a pit that contains a smaller, , , and wooden structure within. The inside was packed with burial sacrifices and wealth which signified Lady Hao&#x27;s prodigious position.

She was buried with a large and varied quantity of weapons signifying her important martial status, since only warriors and generals were buried with such objects. Additionally, Fu Hao was entombed with hundreds of bronze, jade, bone, and stone objects such as figurines, vessels, and mirrors, many of which were rare objects from around the kingdom. These objects are some of the best preserved from that time period. The sacrificial bronze vessels and tortoise shells inscribed &quot;prepared by Fu Hao&quot; discovered in her tomb are further evidence of her status as a high priestess and oracle caster. As was the custom during the Shang dynasty, Fu Hao was buried with 16 human sacrifices and six dogs. The remains of Fu Hao herself were found to have disintegrated.

=== Contents of tomb ===

In total, Fu Hao was buried with: 
* 755 jade objects
* 564 bone objects, including nearly 500 bone hairpins and over 20 bone arrowheads

<text>The Garabit viaduct () is a railway arch bridge spanning the Truyère, near Ruynes-en-Margeride, Cantal, France, in the mountainous Massif Central region.

The bridge was constructed between 1882 and 1884 by Gustave Eiffel, with structural engineering by Maurice Koechlin, and was opened in 1885. It is in length and has a principal arch of span.

==Background==
By the late 1870s, Eiffel &amp; Cie, the company founded by Eiffel in partnership with Théophile Seyrig, had established a place among the leading French engineering companies. Between 1875 and 1877, the company had built the Maria Pia Bridge over the Douro at Porto, and when the construction of a railway between Marvejols and Neussargues, both in Cantal, was proposed, the work of constructing a viaduct to cross the Truyère was given to Eiffel without the usual process of competitive tendering. That was at the recommendation of the state engineers since the technical problems involved were similar to those of the Maria Pia Bridge. Indeed, it was Eiffel &amp; Cie&#x27;s success with that project that had led to the proposal for a viaduct at Garabit.

==Design and construction==
The Garabit viaduct, which uses a parabolic arch to support a single rail line across the gorge,
opened in November 1885. The crossing is long and weighs (metric) . It cost 3,100,000 francs to complete (roughly €80 million in 2023).

Rail traffic using the bridge causes a deflection (load displacement) of about , which was the same value as the one calculated by Eiffel. The bridge, which is above the river, had the world&#x27;s longest arch when it was completed in 1884. This was surpassed two years later with the opening of the Dom Luís I Bridge across the Douro in Porto, Portugal in 1886. 

Until 11 September 2009, one regular daily Corail passenger train passed each way from Clermont-Ferrand to Béziers. However, the viaduct was closed when cracks were discovered in one of the foundation piles. The Garabit viaduct reopened the following month after a safety inspection, with a speed limit of for all traffic.

==In popular culture==
In 1976, it was used to represent the condemned &quot;Cassandra Crossing&quot; bridge in the film &quot;The Cassandra Crossing&quot;. In the film, the bridge is depicted as being unused and derelict for 30 or 40 years and is considered dangerous, to the extent that people living nearby moved away fearing it could collapse.

<text>The Garfagnana () is a historical and geographical region of central Italy, today part of the province of Lucca, in Tuscany. It is the upper valley or basin of the river Serchio, and thus lies between the main ridge of the Northern Apennines to the north-east and the Alpi Apuane to the west. The principal towns are Castelnuovo di Garfagnana and Barga.

== History ==
Garfagnana was historically inhabited by Ligurian (Apuani and Friniati) and Etruscan populations. The area was conquered by the Romans in 180 BC. After the fall of the Carolingian empire in 888 it came under the control of various feudal lords, and was later caught up in the rivalry between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. In 1248 the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II ceded it to the Republic of Lucca. In the fifteenth century much of the territory came under the control of the d&#x27;Este family of Ferrara, and in 1847 the remaining part was absorbed into the Duchy of Modena. With the unification of Italy, the Garfagnana became part of the province of Massa e Carrara, and in 1923 passed to that of Lucca.

== Geography ==
The Garfagnana is almost entirely mountainous. It has heavy rainfall, and much of it is densely wooded, often with sweet chestnut, &quot;Castanea sativa&quot;. Chestnuts were until recently an important food source; the Farina di Neccio della Garfagnana, a chestnut flour, has DOP status. The spelt from the region, Farro della Garfagnana, has Indicazione Geografica Protetta status; the area is also known for its lentils and for its porcini mushrooms. It is the area of origin of the Garfagnina breed of cattle, of the Garfagnina breed of goat, and of the Garfagnina Bianca sheep breed.

The capital of the region is Castelnuovo di Garfagnana.

The Garfagnana and Lunigiana were struck by a powerful earthquake on 7 September 1920. The worst damage and largest number of deaths were at Villa Collemandina; the greatest intensity was recorded there and at Fivizzano.

<text>Coalbrookdale is a town in the Ironbridge Gorge and the Telford and Wrekin borough of Shropshire, England, containing a settlement of great significance in the history of iron ore smelting. It lies within the civil parish called the Gorge.

This is where iron ore was first smelted by Abraham Darby using easily mined &quot;coking coal&quot;. The coal was drawn from drift mines in the sides of the valley. As it contained far fewer impurities than normal coal, the iron it produced was of a superior quality. Along with many other industrial developments that were going on in other parts of the country, this discovery was a major factor in the growing industrialisation of Britain, which was to become known as the Industrial Revolution. Today, Coalbrookdale is home to the Ironbridge Institute, a partnership between the University of Birmingham and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust offering postgraduate and professional development courses in heritage.

==Before Abraham Darby==
Before the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Madeley and the adjacent Little Wenlock belonged to Much Wenlock Priory. At the Dissolution there was a bloomsmithy called &quot;Caldebroke Smithy&quot;. The manor passed about 1572 to John Brooke, who developed coal mining in his manor on a substantial scale. His son Sir Basil Brooke was a significant industrialist, and invested in ironworks elsewhere. It is probable that he also had ironworks at Coalbrookdale, but evidence is lacking. He also acquired an interest in the patent for the cementation process of making steel in about 1615. Though forced to surrender the patent in 1619, he continued making iron and steel until his estate was sequestrated during the Civil War, but the works continued in use.

In 1651, the manor was leased to Francis Wolfe, the clerk of the ironworks, and he and his son operated them as tenant of (or possibly manager for) Brooke&#x27;s heirs. The surviving old blast furnace contains a cast-iron lintel bearing a date, which is currently painted as 1638, but an archive photograph has been found showing it as 1658. What ironworks existed at Coalbrookdale and from precisely what dates thus remains obscure. By 1688, the ironworks were operated by Lawrence Wellington, but a few years after the furnace was occupied by Shadrach Fox. He renewed the lease in 1696, letting the Great Forge and Plate Forge to Wellington. Some evidence may suggest that Shadrach Fox smelted iron with mineral coal, though this remains controversial. Fox was evidently an iron founder, as he supplied round shot and grenade shells to the Board of Ordnance during the Nine Years War, but not later than April 1703, the furnace blew up. It remained derelict until the arrival of Abraham Darby the Elder in 1709. However the forges remained in use. A brass works was built sometime before 1712 (possibly as early as 1706), but closed in 1714.

==Industrial Revolution==


In 1709, the first Abraham Darby rebuilt Coalbrookdale Furnace, and eventually used coke as his fuel. His business was that of an ironfounder, making cast-iron pots and other goods, an activity in which he was particularly successful because of his patented foundry method, which enabled him to produce cheaper pots than his rivals. Coalbrookdale has been claimed as the home of the world&#x27;s first coke-fired blast furnace; this is not strictly correct, but it was the first in Europe to operate successfully for more than a few years.

Darby renewed his lease of the works in 1714, forming a new partnership with John Chamberlain and Thomas Baylies. They built a second furnace in about 1715, which was intended to be followed up with a furnace in Wales at Dolgûn near Dolgellau and in Cheshire taking over Vale Royal Furnace in 1718. However, Darby died prematurely at Madeley Court in 1717 – the same year as he began the house Dale End which became home to succeeding generations of the family in Coalbrookdale – followed quickly by his widow Mary. The partnership was dissolved before Mary&#x27;s death, Baylies taking over Vale Royal. After Mary&#x27;s death, Baylies had difficulty extracting his capital. The works then passed to a company led by his fellow Quaker Thomas Goldney II of Bristol and managed by Richard Ford (also a Quaker). Darby&#x27;s son Abraham Darby the Younger was brought into the business as an assistant manager when old enough.

The company&#x27;s main business was producing cast-iron goods. Molten iron for this foundry work was not only produced from the blast furnaces, but also by remelting pig iron in air furnaces, a variant of the reverberatory furnace. The Company also became early suppliers of steam engine cylinders in this period.

From 1720, the Company operated a forge at Coalbrookdale but this was not profitable. In about 1754, renewed experiments took place with the application of coke pig iron to the production of bar iron in charcoal finery forges. This proved to be a success, and led to the partners building new furnaces at Horsehay and Ketley. This was the beginning of a great expansion in coke ironmaking.

In 1767, the Company began to produce the first cast-iron rails for railways. In 1778, Abraham Darby III undertook the building of the world&#x27;s first cast-iron bridge, the iconic Iron Bridge, opened 1 January 1781. The fame of this bridge leads many people today to associate the iron-making part of the Industrial Revolution with the neighbouring village of Ironbridge, but in fact most of the work was done at Coalbrookdale, as there was no settlement at Ironbridge in the eighteenth century. Expansion of Coalbrookdale&#x27;s industrial facilities continued, with the development of sophisticated ponds and culverts to provide water power, and even &quot;Resolution&quot;, a water-returning beam engine to recirculate this water.

In 1795, the first porcelain factory near Coalbrookdale was founded at Coalport, east of the Iron Bridge, by William Reynolds and John Rose, producing Coalport porcelain.

In 1802, the Coalbrookdale Company built a rail locomotive for Richard Trevethick, but little is known about it, including whether or not it actually ran. The death of a company workman in an accident involving the engine is said to have caused the company to not proceed to running it on their existing railway. To date, the only known information about it comes from a drawing preserved at the Science Museum, London, together with a letter written by Trevithick to his friend Davies Giddy. The design incorporated a single horizontal cylinder enclosed in a return-flue boiler. A flywheel drove the wheels on one side through spur gears, and the axles were mounted directly on the boiler, with no frame. The drawing indicates that the locomotive ran on a plateway with a track gauge of . This was two years before Trevethick&#x27;s first engine to tow a train was run at Penydarren in south Wales.

In the 19th century, Coalbrookdale was noted for its decorative ironwork. It is here (for example) that the gates of London&#x27;s Hyde Park were built. Other examples include the Coalbrookdale verandah at St John&#x27;s in Monmouth, Wales, and as far away as the Peacock Fountain in Christchurch, New Zealand. The blast furnaces were closed down, perhaps as early as the 1820s, but the foundries remained in use. The Coalbrookdale Company became part of an alliance of ironfounding companies called Light Castings Limited. This was absorbed by Allied Ironfounders Limited in 1929. This was in turn taken over by Glynwed which has since become Aga Foodservice. The Coalbrookdale foundry closed in November 2017.

Several of Coalbrookdale&#x27;s industrial heritage sites are to be found on the local trail: including: Coalbrookdale railway station, the Quaker Burial Ground, the Darby Houses, Tea Kettle Row and the Great Western Railway Viaduct.

==Museum==

In the century after the Old Blast Furnace closed, it became buried. There was a proposal for the site to be cleared and the furnace dismantled, but instead, it was decided to excavate and preserve it. It and a small museum were opened to celebrate 250 years of the Company in 1959. This became part of a larger project, the Ironbridge Gorge Museums. Its Museum of Iron is based in the Great Warehouse constructed in 1838 and Ironbridge Institute is based in the Long Warehouse, these two form the sides of an open space. On another side of which is the Old Blast Furnace, now under a building (erected in 1981) to protect it from the weather. The fourth side is a viaduct carrying the railway that delivered coal to the now demolished Ironbridge Power Station. One of the two tracks is due to be taken over by Telford Steam Railway as part of its southern extension from Horsehay. The Museum&#x27;s archaeology unit continues to investigate the earlier history of Coalbrookdale, and has recently excavated the remains of the 17th century cementation furnaces, near the site of the Upper (formerly Middle) Forge.

==Old Furnace==
The Old Furnace began life as a typical blast furnace, but went over to coke in 1709. Abraham Darby I used it to cast pots, kettles and other goods. His grandson Abraham Darby III smelted the iron here for the first Ironbridge, the world&#x27;s first iron bridge.
The lintels of the furnace bear dated inscriptions. The uppermost reads &quot;Abraham Darby 1777&quot;, probably recording its enlargement for casting the Iron Bridge. It is unclear whether the date on one of the lower ones should be 1638 (as it is now painted) or 1658 (as shown on an old photo). The interior profile of the furnace is typical of its period, bulging around the middle, below which the boshes taper in again so that the charge descends into a narrower and hotter hearth, where the iron was molten. When Abraham Darby III enlarged the furnace, he only made the boshes wider on the front and left sides, but not on the right where doing so would have entailed moving the water wheel. The mouth of the furnace is thus off-centre.

Iron was now being made in large quantities for many customers. In the 1720s and 1730s, its main products were cast-iron cooking pots, kettles and other domestic articles. It also cast the cylinders for steam engines, and pig iron for use by other foundries. In the late 18th century, it sometimes produced structural ironwork, including for Buildwas Bridge. This was built in 1795, 2 miles up the river from the original Ironbridge. Due to advances in technology, it used only half as much cast iron despite being 30 feet (9 m) wider than the Ironbridge. The year after that, in 1796, Thomas Telford began a new project, Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct. It carried the Shrewsbury Canal over the River Tern and was supported by cast-iron columns. Charles Bage designed and built the world&#x27;s first multi-storey cast-iron-framed mill. It used only brick and iron, with no wood, to improve its fire-resistance. In the 19th century ornamental ironwork became a speciality.

<doc id="883632" wikidata="Q3811326" url="?curid=883632" title="Junkers Jumo 204">
<text>The Jumo 204 was an opposed-piston, inline, liquid-cooled 6-cylinder aircraft Diesel engine produced by the German manufacturer Junkers. It entered service in 1932. Later engines in the series, the Jumo 205, Jumo 206, Jumo 207 and Jumo 208, differed in stroke, bore, and supercharging arrangements.

==Design and development==
Development of the Junkers diesel engines started in the 1920s with the Junkers Fo3 and Junkers Fo4/Junkers SL1. The Fo4 was re-designated Junkers 4, which in turn was re-designated Junkers Jumo 204 by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM), where the first number indicates the manufacturer; 2 – Junkers Motoren.

These engines used a two-stroke cycle with six cylinders and twelve pistons, in an opposed piston configuration with two crankshafts, one at the bottom of the cylinder block and the other at the top, geared together. The pistons moved towards each other during the operating cycle. There were two cam-operated injection pumps per cylinder, each feeding two nozzles, totaling four nozzles per cylinder.

As is typical of two-stroke designs, the Jumos used fixed intake and exhaust ports instead of valves, which were uncovered when the pistons reached a certain point in their stroke. Normally such designs have poor volumetric efficiency because both ports open and close at the same time and are generally located across from each other in the cylinder. This leads to poor scavenging of the burnt charge, which is why valve-less two-strokes generally run smoky and are inefficient.

The Jumo 204 solved this problem to a very large degree through a better arrangement of the ports. The intake port was located under the &quot;lower&quot; piston, while the exhaust port was under the &quot;upper&quot;. The lower crankshaft ran eleven degrees behind the upper, meaning that the exhaust ports opened first, allowing proper scavenging. This system made the two-stroke Jumos run as cleanly as four-stroke engines using valves, but with considerably less complexity.

The Jumo 204 (originally designated Jumo 4) was test flown in early 1929 installed in a Junkers G 24.

The Jumo Fo3 and 204 were licensed to Napier &amp; Son, who built a small number as the Napier Culverin just prior to the war. Late in the war, they mounted three Culverins in a triangle layout to produce the Napier Deltic, which was for some time one of the most powerful and compact diesel engines in the world.

==Variants==
&quot;Data from Junkers Aircraft &amp; Engines 1913–1945.&quot;
;Mo3:A research diesel engine for test bed use only, the Mo3 was a four-cylinder, (eight piston), opposed-piston engine designed to run horizontally. Tested from 1913, the problems found in testing the Mo3 were progressively solved after World War I with the Fo3 and later opposed piston diesels.
;Fo3:From 1924, Junkers experimented with the Fo3, A vertical 5-cyl. opposed-piston diesel, which ran on a test bed in the summer of 1926, developing at 1,200 rpm. Mostly successful, the Fo3 did highlight the need for accurate dynamic balancing of the rotating components.
;Fo4: (a.k.a. SL1) The Fo4, benefiting from the experience gained with the Fo3, was a six-cylinder opposed-piston diesel engine, tested from 1928 and flown in the nose of a Junkers G.24 from 30 August 1929.
;Jumo 4: After the successful bench runs and flight tests, the Fo4 was refined into the certificated Jumo 4, enjoying limited success powering re-engined Junkers F24kay airliners of Deutsche Luft Hansa, remaining in service until 1939.
;Jumo 204:Later production of refined Jumo 4s: Jumo 204A, 204B, and 204C, differing in airscrew drive arrangements.
;Napier Culverin:The Jumo 204 and 205 were licensed to Napier, who built a small number of Jumo 204 developments as the Napier Culverin just prior to the war. After the war, they mounted three Culverins in a triangle layout to produce the Napier Deltic, which was for some time one of the most powerful and compact diesel engines in the world. Work on this engine started in 1947 and engines were running by 1950.

<text>This article lists the colonial residents of Burundi, during the time when modern-day Burundi was part of German East Africa and Ruanda-Urundi.

==Overview of office==

===German rule===
The Germans established the office of Resident of Urundi in 1906. They moved the seat of the residency to Gitega in 1912.

===Belgian rule===
After Urundi fell under Belgian control and became part of the League of Nations mandate of Ruanda-Urundi, the Belgians placed it under the oversight of a Residency based in Gitega. The office included a resident, assistant resident, and other staff for specialised purposes. This system of administration continued when Ruanda-Urundi became a United Nations trust territory. A significant amount of Belgian colonial policy was carried out by the residency. The office of the Vice Governor-General, based in Usumbura (now Bujumbura), was responsible for overseeing the whole of Ruanda-Urundi.

<text>Standard bed sizes are based on standard mattress sizes, which vary from country to country. Bed sizes also vary according to the size and degree of ornamentation of the bed frame. Dimensions and names vary considerably around the world, with most countries having their own standards and terminology. In addition, two mattresses with the same nominal size may have slightly different dimensions, due to manufacturing tolerances, amount of padding, and support type. Mattress sizes may differ from bedding sizes.

== Nomenclature ==
Naming standards on different bed sizes and their corresponding actual measurements can vary across national standards. Examples of such nomenclature are names like &quot;Single&quot;, &quot;Full&quot; or &quot;Double&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot; or &quot;King&quot; size. Sometimes the naming standards are further divided by adding adjectives such as &quot;Narrow&quot;, &quot;Wide&quot;, &quot;Extra Wide&quot;, &quot;Long&quot;, &quot;Extra Long&quot; and so on, which also can vary across national standards.

For example, a &quot;King size&quot; bed may measure (in width by length):
* in the UK.
* in New Zealand.
* in Portugal, but is also available in lengths.
* in Indonesia.
* in Singapore and Malaysia.
* in Australia.
* in India.
* in the US.

Because of the growth of international trade and the above potential cause of confusion, bed sizes are becoming more standardized. In most countries, using the International System of Units, bed dimensions most often appear in centimeters, and often only by width and length. In the United States, Canada and other regions influenced by the former British Empire, dimensions are often in inches.

== Europe ==

Europe may traditionally have had more variations in national bed size standards than any other part of the world, but in the recent years a few sizes have become more common than others. Bed sizes are defined in centimeters in all European countries, although supplementary Imperial equivalents are sometimes shown in the United Kingdom.

Today, the most common widths sold by pan European retailers are:

* for single beds.
* for double beds.

Other sizes are also available in some European countries (e.g., ), but the widths listed above are the most common when looking at the European market as a whole, while and (nominal) are more typical in the UK and Ireland.

Today, the length is the most common bed length sold by pan-European retailers. Lengths of are often also available by special order. The longer beds are intended for taller people, and as a rule of thumb beds may be recommended for people or taller, while beds are recommended for people over tall.

=== France ===
In France, single size beds are usually: 
* or .

The most common sizes for double beds are:
* Valet size 
* Queen size 
* King size 

=== Italy ===
In Italy, beds are classified by name and use the term as in &quot;place&quot;. Standard sizes are:
* (literally &quot;one place&quot;) or (&quot;single&quot;): and 
* (literally &quot; places&quot;) or (literally &quot;priest&#x27;s bed&quot;): 
* (literally &quot;French places&quot;): 
* (double, literally &quot;two places&quot;) or (literally &quot;matrimonial bed&quot;): and 

=== Northern Europe ===
These sizes are for Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, Poland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. There are some variations between different countries, but these are the most common sizes. Until the 1980s the most common mattress length was .

=== Portugal ===
In Portugal, the most common widths for beds are:

* (single): or 
* (double): 
* Queen size: 
* King size: 
* Super king size: 

Beds are typically or long, but have become more common.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, standardized lengths are , with being the most common. Standardized widths are . The most common bed sizes are:

* individual (single): 
* &quot;matrimonio&quot; (Spanish) or &quot;matrimoni&quot; (Catalan) (double, literally &quot;matrimonial&quot;): 

=== UK and Ireland ===
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, beds are measured according to the size of mattress they hold, not the dimensions of the bed frame itself; bed frame sizes are not standardized and may differ between manufacturers. Listed below are the typical bed sizes from the National Bed Federation, which is the trade association for the majority of British and Irish bed manufacturers and their suppliers. Most NBF manufacturers use designs dimensioned in feet and inches with the metric indicators not being exact equivalents. There can legally be a tolerance of up to ± between the quoted measurements and the size of the mattress itself.
.

Some UK retailers may have a &quot;queen&quot; size which refers to one of the above standard sizes, but there is inconsistency around which size specifically, with both the small double and super king being prevalent.

Adjustable beds or electric adjustable bed sizes differ from the standard bed size. The length of these beds differ from a standard size due to the nature of the bed needing to bend. So they are 200 cm in length rather than 191 cm. King size and super king size are normally two 75 cm or two 90 cm adjacent beds.

As well as customary UK sizes, some common European sizes can be found in the UK from imports and IKEA. The typical length of an IKEA and other European mattresses is , whereas UK lengths vary depending on the width of the mattress, being usually either . In 2015, IKEA started offering beds and mattresses in customary UK sizes alongside their standard European sizes.

=== Turkey ===

In Turkey, single size beds are usually ;
long single size ;
large single size .

There is also an intermediate size used for one and a half people in Turkey: .

The most common sizes for double beds are:
small double size ;
young size ;
double size ;
double size ;
double large size ;
double XL size .

==North America==


The sizes of mattresses use non-numeric labels such as a &quot;king&quot; or &quot;full&quot;, but are defined in inches. Historically most beds were &quot;twins&quot; or &quot;doubles&quot; but in the mid-1940s larger mattresses were introduced by manufacturers. These were later standardized as &quot;queen&quot; and &quot;king&quot;, and first made a significant impact on the market in the 1950s and 60s. Standard mattress depth ranges from the &quot;standard&quot; size of to &quot;high contour&quot; of up to . Below are the standard ISPA widths and heights in the United States and Canada.

While the dimensions are specified to the half-inch below, the actual dimension used by manufacturers or various websites may be half an inch larger or smaller.
Less common sizes include:
There are also a number of specialty sizes for specific use cases:
Bedding in the United States must state the type of bed it is intended for, in addition to the dimensions in both inches and centimeters.

=== Bed Height ===
In addition to the horizontal dimensions of beds, another aspect to bed size is the vertical height of the bed. This is particularly relevant for bunk beds, loft beds, Murphy beds, and canopy beds, which require more vertical space than other beds.

In the case of both bunk beds and loft beds, it&#x27;s generally suggested that there is at least 40 inches (1 meter) of vertical space between the top of the mattress to the ceiling. This allows the average-sized adult to sit up comfortably in bed.

For vertical Murphy beds, which fold up against the wall, ceiling height must accommodate the full length of the Murphy bed wall frame.

For canopy beds, there needs to be suitable clearance between the top of the canopy point and the ceiling.

==Oceania==
===Australia===
The following bed sizes are available in Australia.


===New Zealand===
The following bed sizes are available in New Zealand.

==Africa==
===South Africa===
In South Africa, bed sizes have standard lengths of either , with the latter being called &quot;XL&quot; variants. XL mattresses have the same widths as their non-XL counterparts. The XL length is recommended for persons over tall.

*Single: wide
*Three-quarter: wide
*Double: wide
*Queen: wide
*King: wide. Equal to the width of two single mattresses.
*Super king: wide. Available in XL length only.

== Asia ==
=== China ===
In China, the following sizes are standard:

<text>A single tax is a system of taxation based mainly or exclusively on one tax, typically chosen for its special properties, often being a tax on land value.

Pierre Le Pesant, sieur de Boisguilbert and Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban were early advocates for a single tax, but, rejecting the claim that land has certain economic properties which make it uniquely suitable for taxation, they instead proposed a flat tax on all incomes.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, a populist single tax movement emerged which also sought to levy a single tax on the rental value of land and natural resources, but for somewhat different reasons. This &quot;Single Tax&quot; movement later became known as Georgism, after its most famous proponent Henry George. It proposed a simplified and equitable tax system that upholds natural rights and whose revenue is based exclusively on ground and natural resource rents, with no additional taxation of improvements such as buildings. Some libertarians advocate land value capture as a consistently ethical and non-distortionary means to fund the essential operations of government, the surplus rent being distributed as a type of guaranteed basic income, traditionally called the citizen&#x27;s dividend, to compensate those members of society who by legal title have been deprived of an equal share of the earth&#x27;s spatial value and equal access to natural opportunities (see &quot;geolibertarianism&quot;).

Related taxes derived in principle from the land value tax include Pigouvian taxes to internalize the external costs of pollution more efficiently than litigation, as well as severance taxes on raw material extraction to regulate the depletion of unreplenishable natural resources and to prevent irreparable damage to valuable ecosystems through unsustainable practices such as overfishing. 

There have been other proposals for a single tax concerning property, goods, or income. Others have made proposals for a single tax based on other revenue models, such as the FairTax proposal for a consumption tax and various flat tax proposals on personal incomes.

<doc id="883645" wikidata="Q627368" url="?curid=883645" title="Blastomycosis">
<text>Blastomycosis, also known as Gilchrist&#x27;s disease, is a fungal infection, typically of the lungs, which can spread to brain, stomach, intestine and skin, where it appears as crusting purplish warty plaques with a roundish bumpy edge and central depression. Around half of people with the disease have symptoms, which can include fever, cough, night sweats, muscle pains, weight loss, chest pain, and fatigue. Symptoms usually develop between three weeks and three months after breathing in the spores. In 25% to 40% of cases, the infection also spreads to other parts of the body, such as the skin, bones or central nervous system. Although blastomycosis is especially dangerous for those with weak immune systems, most people diagnosed with blastomycosis have healthy immune systems.
&quot;Blastomyces dermatitidis&quot; is found in the soil and decaying organic matter like wood or leaves. Outdoor activities like hunting or camping in wooded areas increase the risk of developing blastomycosis. There is no vaccine, but the risk of the disease can be reduced by not disturbing the soil. Treatment is typically with an azole drug such as itraconazole for mild or moderate disease. In severe cases, patients are treated with amphotericin B before azole treatment. In either event, the azole treatment lasts for 6–12 months. Overall, 4–6% of people who develop blastomycosis die; however, if the central nervous system is involved, this rises to 18%. People with AIDS or on medications that suppress the immune system have the highest risk of death at 25–40%.
Blastomycosis is endemic to the eastern United States and Canada, especially the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, the Great Lakes, and the St. Lawrence River valley. In these areas, there are about 1 to 2 cases per 100,000 per year. Less frequently, blastomycosis also occurs in Africa, the Middle East, India, and western North America. Blastomycosis also affects a broad range of non-human mammals, and dogs in particular are an order of magnitude more likely to contract the disease than humans. The ecological niche of &quot;Blastomyces&quot; in the wild is poorly understood, and it is unknown if there are any significant host animals.

Blastomycosis has existed for millions of years but was first described by Thomas Caspar Gilchrist in 1894. Because of this, it is sometimes called &quot;Gilchrist&#x27;s disease&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==

The symptoms of blastomycosis cover a wide range, overlapping with more common conditions; for this reason, blastomycosis has often been called &quot;the great pretender&quot;. Many cases are asymptomatic or subclinical. Lung symptoms are common, because the lungs are infected in 79% of blastomycosis cases. However, in 25–40% of cases the disease also disseminates to other organs, including the skin.

The extent and severity of symptoms depends in part on a person&#x27;s immune status; less than 50% of healthy people with blastomycosis have symptoms, while immunocompromised patients are especially likely to have the disease spread beyond the lungs to other organs like the skin and bones.

Blastomycosis manifests as a primary lung infection in about 79% of cases. The onset is relatively slow and symptoms are suggestive of bacterial pneumonia, often leading to initial treatment with antibacterials. Because the symptoms are variable and nonspecific, blastomycosis is often not even considered in differential diagnosis until antibacterial treatment has failed, unless there are known risk factors or skin lesions. The disease may be misdiagnosed as a carcinoma, leading in some cases to surgical removal of the affected tissue. Upper lung lobes are involved somewhat more frequently than lower lobes. If untreated, many cases progress over a period of months to years to become disseminated blastomycosis.

Blastomycosis in the lungs may present a variety of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. If symptoms are present they may range from mild pneumonia resembling a pneumococcal infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Common symptoms include fever, chills, headache, coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain, and malaise. Without treatment, cases may progress to chronic pneumonia or ARDS.

ARDS is an uncommon but dangerous manifestation of blastomycosis. It was seen in 9 of 72 blastomycosis cases studied in northeast Tennessee. Such cases may follow massive exposure, such during brush clearing operations. In the Tennessee study, the fatality rate was 89% in the ARDS cases, but only 10% in the non-ARDS cases.

In disseminated blastomycosis, the large &quot;Blastomyces&quot; yeast cells translocate from the lungs and are trapped in capillary beds elsewhere in the body, where they cause lesions. The skin is the most common organ affected, being the site of lesions in approximately 60% of cases. The signature image of blastomycosis in textbooks is the indolent, verrucous or ulcerated dermal lesion seen in disseminated disease. Osteomyelitis is also common (12–60% of cases). Other recurring sites of dissemination are the genitourinary tract (kidney, prostate, epididymis; collectively ca. 25% of cases) and the brain (3–10% of cases). Among immunocompromised individuals, 40% have CNS involvement presenting as brain abscess, epidural abscess or meningitis.

Blastomycosis in non-lung organs such as the skin may present a very wide range of symptoms, including the following:
* skin lesions, which may be verrucous (wart-like) or ulcerated with small pustules at the margins.
* bone or joint pain due to bone lytic lesions.
* pain when urinating due to prostatitis.
* hoarseness due to laryngeal involvement.
* headache, confusion or other neurological symptoms caused by central nervous system involvement.

==Cause==

Blastomycosis is caused by dimorphic fungi in the genus &quot;Blastomyces&quot;, in the phylum Ascomycota and family Ajellomycetaceae. In eastern North America, the most common cause of blastomycosis is &quot;Blastomyces dermatitidis&quot;, but &quot;Blastomyces gilchristii&quot; has been associated with some outbreaks. In western North America, many cases of blastomycosis are caused by &quot;Blastomyces helicus&quot;, which most commonly attacks immunodeficient people and domestic animals. The species &quot;Blastomyces percursus&quot; causes many cases of blastomycosis in Africa and the Middle East. In Africa, blastomycosis may also be caused by &quot;Blastomyces emzantsi&quot;, which is often associated with infections outside the lungs.

In endemic areas, &quot;Blastomyces dermatitidis&quot; lives in soil and rotten wood near lakes and rivers. Although it has never been directly observed growing in nature, it is thought to grow there as a cottony white mold, similar to the growth seen in artificial culture at 25 °C. The moist, acidic soil in the surrounding woodland harbors the fungus.

==Pathogenesis==
Inhaled conidia of &quot;Blastomyces&quot; are phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages in alveoli. Some of these escape phagocytosis and transform into yeast phase rapidly. Having thick walls, these are resistant to phagocytosis. Once they have transitioned to the yeast phase, the &quot;Blastomyces&quot; cells express the protein &quot;BAD-1&quot;, which helps the yeast cells attach to host cells, and also impairs activation of immune cells while inhibiting release of tumor necrosis factor.
 In lung tissue, the cells multiply and may also disseminate through blood and lymphatics to other organs, including the skin, bone, genitourinary tract, and brain. The incubation period for pulmonary blastomycosis is 3 to 15 weeks, although 30–50% of infections are asymptomatic.

==Diagnosis==
Because the symptoms of blastomycosis resemble those of many other conditions, including tuberculosis and lung cancer, diagnosis is often delayed. In 40% of cases, the diagnosis takes more than a month. A rapid diagnosis can however be made based on microscopic examination of sputum samples or samples obtained from a tissue biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage.

Once suspected, the diagnosis of blastomycosis can usually be confirmed by demonstration of the characteristic broad based budding organisms in sputum or tissues by KOH prep, cytology, or histology. Tissue biopsy of skin or other organs may be required in order to diagnose extra-pulmonary disease. Blastomycosis is histologically associated with granulomatous nodules.

Commercially available urine antigen testing appears to be quite sensitive in suggesting the diagnosis in cases where the organism is not readily detected. However, commercial antigen tests have a high degree of cross-reactivity with other endemic fungal conditions such as histoplasmosis, and thus cannot distinguish blastomycosis from other similar conditions. This cross-reactivity is caused by these related fungal organisms using similar galactomannans in the cell wall.

While culture of the &quot;Blastomyces&quot; organism remains the definitive diagnostic standard, its slow growing nature can lead to a delay of up to four weeks. In addition, sometimes blood and sputum cultures may not detect blastomycosis. Cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid also have poor sensitivity compared to histopathological examination of the affected tissue.

== Treatment ==

Under Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, severe cases of blastomycosis and cases with central nervous system (CNS) involvement are treated initially with amphotericin B, followed by a lengthy course of an azole drug such as itraconazole. In most cases the amphotericin treatment lasts for 1–2 weeks, but in cases of CNS involvement it may last for up to 6 weeks. Cases that do not require amphotericin B treatment are treated with a lengthy course of an azole drug.

Among azole drugs, itraconazole is generally the treatment of choice. Voriconazole is often recommended for CNS blastomycosis cases due to its ability to pass the blood–brain barrier. Other azole drugs that may be used include fluconazole. Ketoconazole was the azole drug first used for blastomycosis treatment, but has been largely replaced by itraconazole because ketoconazole is less effective and less tolerated by patients. The azole treatment generally lasts for a minimum of six months. Cure rates from itraconazole treatment are nearly 95%. Relapse is rare but does occur even after a full course of treatment.

== Prognosis ==

Published estimates of the case fatality rate for blastomycosis have varied from 4% to 78%. A 2020 meta-analysis of published studies found an overall mortality rate of 6.6%. This rose to 37% for immunocompromised patients and 75% for patients with ARDS. A 2021 analysis of 20 years of disease surveillance data from the five US states where blastomycosis is reportable found an overall mortality rate of 8% and a hospitalization rate of 57%. These numbers may be affected by the under-reporting of mild cases.

== Epidemiology ==

Incidence in most endemic areas is about 0.5 per 100,000 population, with occasional local areas attaining as high as 12 per 100,000. Most Canadian data fit this picture. In Ontario, Canada, considering both endemic and non-endemic areas, the overall incidence is around 0.3 cases per 100,000; northern Ontario, mostly endemic, has 2.44 per 100,000. Manitoba is calculated at 0.62 cases per 100,000. Remarkably higher incidence was shown for the Kenora, Ontario region: 117 per 100,000 overall, with aboriginal reserve communities experiencing 404.9 per 100,000. In the United States, the incidence of blastomycosis is similarly high in hyperendemic areas. For example, the city of Eagle River, Vilas County, Wisconsin, which has an incidence rate of 101.3 per 100,000; the county as a whole has been shown in two successive studies to have an incidence of about 40 cases per 100,000. An incidence of 277 per 100,000 was roughly calculated based on 9 cases seen in a Wisconsin aboriginal reservation during a time in which extensive excavation was done for new housing construction. The new case rates are greater in northern states such as Wisconsin, where from 1986 to 1995 there were 1.4 cases per 100,000 people.

The study of outbreaks as well as trends in individual cases of blastomycosis has clarified a number of important matters. Some of these relate to the ongoing effort to understand the source of infectious inoculum of this species, while others relate to which groups of people are especially likely to become infected. Human blastomycosis is primarily associated with forested areas and open watersheds; It primarily affects otherwise healthy, vigorous people, mostly middle-aged, who acquire the disease while working or undertaking recreational activities in sites conventionally considered clean, healthy and in many cases beautiful. Repeatedly associated activities include hunting, especially raccoon hunting, where accompanying dogs also tend to be affected, as well as working with wood or plant material in forested or riparian areas, involvement in forestry in highly endemic areas, excavation, fishing and possibly gardening and trapping.

===Urban infections===
There is also a developing profile of urban and other domestic blastomycosis cases, beginning with an outbreak tentatively attributed to construction dust in Westmont, Illinois. The city of Rockford, Illinois, was also documented as a hyperendemic area based on incidence rates as high as 6.67 per 100,000 population for some areas of the city. Though proximity to open watersheds was linked to incidence in some areas, suggesting that outdoor activity within the city may be connected to many cases, there is also an increasing body of evidence that even the interiors of buildings may be risk areas. An early case concerned a prisoner who was confined to prison during the whole of his likely blastomycotic incubation period. An epidemiological survey found that although many patients who contracted blastomycosis had engaged in fishing, hunting, gardening, outdoor work and excavation, the most strongly linked association in patients was living or visiting near waterways. Based on a similar finding in a Louisiana study, it has been suggested that place of residence might be the most important single factor in blastomycosis epidemiology in north central Wisconsin. Follow-up epidemiological and case studies indicated that clusters of cases were often associated with particular domiciles, often spread out over a period of years, and that there were uncommon but regularly occurring cases in which pets kept mostly or entirely indoors, in particular cats, contracted blastomycosis. The occurrence of blastomycosis, then, is an issue strongly linked to housing and domestic circumstances.

===Seasonal trends===
Seasonality and weather also appear to be linked to contraction of blastomycosis. Many studies have suggested an association between blastomycosis contraction and cool to moderately warm, moist periods of the spring and autumn or, in relatively warm winter areas. However, the entire summer or a known summer exposure date is included in the association in some studies. Occasional studies fail to detect a seasonal link. In terms of weather, both unusually dry weather and unusually moist weather have been cited. The seemingly contradictory data can most likely be reconciled by proposing that &quot;B. dermatitidis&quot; prospers in its natural habitats in times of moisture and moderate warmth, but that inoculum formed during these periods remains alive for some time and can be released into the air by subsequent dust formation under dry conditions. Indeed, dust per se or construction potentially linked to dust has been associated with several outbreaks The data, then, tend to link blastomycosis to all weather, climate and atmospheric conditions except freezing weather, periods of snow cover, and extended periods of hot, dry summer weather in which soil is not agitated.

===Gender bias===
Sex is another factor inconstantly linked to contraction of blastomycosis: though many studies show more men than women affected, some show no sex-related bias. As mentioned above, most cases are in middle aged adults, but all age groups are affected, and cases in children are not uncommon.

=== Ethnic populations ===

Ethnic group or race is frequently investigated in epidemiological studies of blastomycosis, but is potentially confounded by differences in residence and in quality and accessibility of medical care, factors that have not been stringently controlled for to date. In the United States, some studies show a disproportionately high incidence and/or mortality rate for blastomycosis among Black people.

In Canada, some studies, but not others, indicate that First Nations people have a disproportionately high incidence of blastomycosis. Incidence in First Nations children may be unusually high. The Canadian data in some areas may be confounded or explained by the tendency to establish indigenous communities in wooded, riparian, northern areas corresponding to the core habitat of &quot;B. dermatitidis&quot;, often with known &quot;B. dermatitidis&quot; habitats such as woodpiles and beaver constructions in the near vicinity.

===Communicability===
Blastomycosis is not considered contagious, either among humans or between animals and humans. However, there are a very small number of cases of human-to-human transmission of &quot;B. dermatitidis&quot; related to dermal contact or sexual transmission of disseminated blastomycosis of the genital tract among spouses.

== History ==

The organisms causing blastomycosis have existed for millions of years. The pathogenic group of onygenalean fungi that give rise to conditions including blastomycosis and histoplasmosis emerged approximately 150 million years ago. The most closely related blastomycosis-causing fungi, &quot;Blastomyces dermatitidis&quot; and &quot;Blastomyces gilchristii&quot;, diverged during the Pleistocene, approximately 1.9 million years ago.

At the Koster Site in Illinois, evidence pointing to possible blastomycosis infections among Late Woodland Native Americans has been identified. At that site, Dr. Jane Buikstra found evidence for what may have been an epidemic of a serious spinal disease in adolescents and young adults. Several of the skeletons showed lesions in the spinal vertebrae in the lower back. There are two modern diseases that produce lesions in the bone similar to the ones Dr. Buikstra found in these prehistoric specimens: spinal TB and blastomycosis. The bony lesions in these two diseases are practically identical. Blastomycosis seems more probable as these young people in Late Woodland and Mississippian times may have been affected because they were spending more time cultivating plants than their Middle Woodland predecessors had done. If true, it would be another severe penalty Late Woodland people had to pay as they shifted to agriculture as a way of life, and it would be a contributing factor to shortening their lifespans compared to those of the Middle Woodland people.

Blastomycosis was first described by Thomas Caspar Gilchrist in 1894, as a skin disease. Because of this, blastomycosis is sometimes called &quot;Gilchrist&#x27;s disease&quot;. Gilchrist initially identified the cause of the disease as a protozoan, but later correctly identified it as a fungus. In 1898 he and William Royal Stokes published the first description of &quot;Blastomyces dermatitidis&quot;. Gilchrist referred to the disease as &quot;blastomycetic dermatitis&quot;.

The systemic spread of blastomycosis was first described in 1902, in a case that had been misdiagnosed as a combination of tuberculosis and a blastomycosis skin infection. In 1907, the dimorphic nature of the &quot;Blastomyces&quot; fungus was first identified. In 1912, the first case of canine blastomycosis was reported.

Prior to the 1930s, blastomycosis was not clearly distinguished from similar fungal conditions. A paper by Rhoda Williams Benham in 1934 distinguished the causative agent of blastomycosis from cryptococcosis and coccidioidomycosis.

In the early 1950s, blastomycosis was first determined to be a primarily respiratory disease, with most skin lesions caused by systemic spread from an initial lung infection. In 1952, the first documented case outside North or Central America, in Tunisia, was reported. The 1950s also saw the first introduction of antifungal drugs including amphotericin B. Before 1950, the fatality rate for disseminated blastomycosis was 92%, and treatment options were limited to iodide compounds, radiation therapy, and surgery. The first azole antifungal drug, ketoconazole, was developed in the 1970s and approved in the United States in 1981.

Prior to 2013, the only species known to cause blastomycosis was &quot;B. dermatitidis&quot;. Since that time, genomic analysis has identified multiple other &quot;Blastomyces&quot; species causing blastomycosis, including &quot;B. gilchristii&quot; (2013), &quot;B. helicus&quot; (reassigned from the genus &quot;Emmonsia&quot; in 2017), &quot;B. percursus&quot; (2017), and &quot;B. emzantsi&quot; (2020).

The largest-ever &quot;blastomycosis&quot; outbreak in United States history occurred at an Escanaba, Michigan, paper mill in 2023. , one person had died and almost a hundred more had fallen ill.

== Other animals ==

Blastomycosis affects a broad range of mammals. As with humans, most animals that become infected were formerly healthy and immunocompetent. Dogs are frequently affected; blastomycosis is eight to ten times more common in dogs than in humans. Sporting and hound breeds are at the greatest risk. Cats and horses can also be infected. Cats with feline immunodeficiency virus are particularly at risk. However, the overall risk of blastomycosis in cats is 28 to 100 times lower than in dogs. Cases of blastomycosis have also been reported in captive lions and tigers, in a wild North American black bear, and in marine mammals such as the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin.

The nonspecific symptoms that make blastomycosis difficult to diagnose in humans also complicate veterinary diagnosis. Cats in particular are often only diagnosed after death.

Dogs and humans frequently acquire blastomycosis from the same exposure event. In most such cases, the infection in the dog becomes apparent before the human infection. This may be due to a shortened incubation period, caused by the dog inhaling larger quantities of &quot;Blastomyces&quot; spores than the human.

In veterinary care, blastomycosis is typically treated with itraconazole. 70% of treated dogs respond to medication and recover. In dogs as in humans, the prognosis for blastomycosis depends on the severity of the symptoms.

<text>The Mars Radiation Environment Experiment, or MARIE, was designed to measure the radiation environment of Mars using an energetic particle spectrometer as part of the science mission of the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft (launched on April 7, 2001). It was led by NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center and the science investigation was designed to characterize aspects of the radiation environment both on the way to Mars and while it was in the Martian orbit.

Since space radiation presents an extreme hazard to crews of interplanetary missions the experiment was an attempt to predict anticipated radiation doses that would be experienced by future astronauts and it helped determine possible effects of Martian radiation on human beings.

Space radiation comes from cosmic rays emitted by Earth&#x27;s local star, the Sun, and from stars beyond the Solar System as well. Space radiation can trigger cancer and cause damage to the central nervous system. Similar instruments are flown on the Space Shuttles and on the International Space Station (ISS), but none have ever flown outside Earth&#x27;s protective magnetosphere, which blocks much of this radiation from reaching the surface of our planet.

MARIE was turned off on 28 October 2003 after communication was lost during a large solar proton event.

==Operation==

A spectrometer inside the instrument measured the energy from two sources of space radiation: galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar energetic particles (SEP). As the spacecraft orbited the red planet, the spectrometer swept through the sky and measured the radiation field.

The instrument, with a 68-degree field of view, was designed to collect data continuously during Mars Odyssey&#x27;s cruise from Earth to Mars. It stored large amounts of data for downlink, and operated throughout the entire science mission.

==MARIE specifications==
The Martian Radiation Environment Experiment weighs 3.3 kilograms (7.3 pounds) and uses 7 watts of power. It measures 29.4 x 23.2 x 10.8 centimeters (11.6 x 9.1 x 4.3 inches).

==Results==

The diagram above indicates that a main radiation exposure is about 20 mrad/d resulting in annual dose of about 73 mGy/a. However occasional solar proton events (SPEs) produce a hundred and more times higher doses (see the diagram above). SPEs, which were observed by MARIE, were not observed by sensors near Earth confirming that SPEs are directional. Thus the average in-orbit doses were about 400–500mSv/a.

JPL reported that MARIE-measured radiation levels were two to three times greater than that at the International Space Station (which is 100–200 mSv/a). The levels at the Martian surface might be closer to the level at the ISS due to atmospheric shielding – ignoring the effect of thermal neutrons induced by GCR.

<text>The General Land Office (GLO) was an independent agency of the United States government responsible for public domain lands in the United States. It was created in 1812 to take over functions previously conducted by the United States Department of the Treasury. Starting with the enactment of the Land Ordinance of 1785, which created the Public Land Survey System, the Treasury Department had already overseen the survey of the Northwest Territory, including what is now the state of Ohio.

Placed under the Department of the Interior when that department was formed in 1849, it was merged with the United States Grazing Service (established in 1934) to become the Bureau of Land Management on July 16, 1946.

==History==

The GLO oversaw the surveying, platting, and sale of the public lands in the Western United States and administered the Homestead Act and the Preemption Act in disposal of public lands. The frantic pace of public land sales in the 19th century American West led to the idiomatic expression &quot;land-office business&quot;, meaning a thriving or high-volume trade.

For most of the active period of public land settlement, district land offices were the basic operating units that conducted the business of transferring title. All transactions relative to the disposal of public land within a declared land district were handled through its land office by officials designated as registers, who recorded land applications, and receivers, who accepted payments for land and issued receipts. The position of receiver was abolished, July 1, 1925, and the functions devolved upon the register, whose title was changed to &quot;manager&quot; in 1946. The first of 362 district land offices was opened at Steubenville, Ohio, on July 2, 1800; the last at Newcastle, Wyoming, on March 1, 1920. The peak year for land offices was 1890, with 123 in operation. The subsequent closing of the public domain gradually reduced the number of land offices, until, in 1933, only 25 offices remained.

The GLO was placed under the Secretary of the Interior when the Department of the Interior was formed in 1849. Reacting to public concerns about forest conservation, Congress in 1891 authorized the President to withdraw timber lands from disposal. Grover Cleveland then created 17 forest reserves of nearly , which were initially managed by the GLO. In 1905, Congress transferred responsibility for these reserves to the newly created Forest Service, under the Department of Agriculture.

Beginning in the early 20th century, the GLO shifted from a primary function of land sales to issuing leases and collecting grazing fees for livestock raised on public lands, and royalties from minerals off lands recently withdrawn from disposal under the Withdrawal Act of 1910, as well as other custodial duties. Thus, beginning around 1900, the GLO gained a focus for conservation of renewable public resources, as well as for their exploitation.

On July 16, 1946, the GLO was merged with the United States Grazing Service (established in 1934 under the Taylor Grazing Act) to become the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an agency of the Interior Department responsible for administering the remaining of public lands still in federal ownership.

An early commissioner was John McLean, later an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

The BLM makes images of GLO records (federal land patents, survey plats and field notes, land status records, and tract books) issued between 1787 and present publicly available on its website.
Since 1990, the BLM&#x27;s Geographic Coordinates Database (GCDB) program has endeavored to generate coordinate values for each established PLSS corner using the official survey records of the GLO and BLM on a township basis. The GCDB data are available for download by the public in GIS shapefile format from the GeoCommunicator Land Survey Information System website. The GCDB coordinates are also available to the public in the GCDB flat file and GCDB coverage formats via the National Operations Center website.

<doc id="883653" wikidata="Q379914" url="?curid=883653" title="Saint Cajetan">
<text>Gaetano dei Conti di Thiene (6 October 1480 – 7 August 1547), known as Saint Cajetan, was an Italian Catholic priest and religious reformer, co-founder of the Theatines. He is recognised as a saint in the Catholic Church, and his feast day is 7 August.

==Life==
Cajetan was born in October 1480, the son of Gaspar, lord of Thiene, and Mary Porta, persons of the first rank among the nobility of the territory of Vicenza, in Veneto Region.

His father died when he was two years of age. Quiet and retiring by nature, he was predisposed to piety by his mother. Cajetan studied law in Padua, receiving his degree as &quot;doctor utriusque juris&quot; (i.e., in civil and canon law) at age 24. In 1506 he worked as a diplomat for Pope Julius II, with whom he helped reconcile the Republic of Venice. But he was not ordained a priest until the year 1516.

With the death of Pope Julius II in 1513, Cajetan withdrew from the papal court. Recalled to Vicenza by the death of his mother, he founded in 1522 a hospital for incurables there. By 1523, he had established a hospital in Venice, as well. His interests were as much or more devoted to spiritual healing than the physical kind, and he joined a confraternity in Rome called the &quot;Oratory of Divine Love&quot;. He intended to form a group that would combine the spirit of monasticism with the exercises of the active ministry.

==Theatines==
A new congregation was canonically erected by Pope Clement VII in the year 1524. One of his four companions was Giovanni Pietro Carafa, the Bishop of Chieti, elected first superior of the order, who later became pope as Paul IV. From the name of the city of Chieti (in ), arose the name by which the order is known, the &quot;Theatines&quot;. The order grew at a fairly slow pace: there were only twelve Theatines during the sack of Rome in 1527, during which Cajetan was tortured by mutinous soldiers of Charles V. The Theatines managed to escape to Venice.

There Cajetan met Jerome Emiliani, whom he assisted in the establishment of his Congregation of Clerks Regular. In 1533, he founded a house in Naples. The year 1540 found him in Venice again and from there he extended his work to Verona. He founded a bank to help the poor and offer an alternative to usurers (who charged high interest rates). It later became the Banco di Napoli.

Cajetan died in Naples on 7 August 1547. His remains are in the church of San Paolo Maggiore in Naples; outside the church is Piazza San Gaetano, with a statue.

==Veneration==
He was beatified on 8 October 1629 by Pope Urban VIII. On 12 April 1671, Cajetan was canonized by Pope Clement X. Saint Cajetan&#x27;s feast day is celebrated on 7 August.

Jesuit missionary Eusebio Kino in 1691 established the mission San Cayetano de Tumacácori in honour of Cajetan. It is now Tumacacori National Historical Park in Arizona.

He is known as the patron saint of Argentina and of the unemployed.

<doc id="883655" wikidata="Q7379572" url="?curid=883655" title="Run it up the flagpole">
<text>Let&#x27;s run it up the flagpole and see if anyone salutes it is a catchphrase which became popular in the United States during the late 1950s and early 1960s. It means &quot;to present an idea tentatively and see whether it receives a favorable reaction&quot;. It is now considered a cliché. Sometimes it is used seriously, but more often it is used humorously, with the intention that it be recognized as both hackneyed and outdated. An equivalent phrase is &quot;to send up a trial balloon&quot;.

==Background==
The phrase was associated with the advertising agencies then located on Madison Avenue in New York, and with the &quot;men in the grey flannel suits&quot;. Comedians, when mocking corporate culture, were certain to use it, along with expressions such as &quot;the whole ball of wax&quot; and the use of invented words adding the suffix &quot;-wise&quot; (e.g. &quot;We&#x27;ve had a good year, revenue wise&quot;).

The phrase was also used as an ice breaker between serious moments in the motion picture &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; starring Henry Fonda. The line was delivered by Juror no. 12, an advertising executive played by Robert Webber.

In Stan Freberg&#x27;s 1961 comedy album, &quot;Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America Volume One: The Early Years&quot;, General George Washington, after having just received the nation&#x27;s new flag from seamstress Betsy Ross, announces that he&#x27;ll just &quot;run it up the flagpole... see if anyone salutes.&quot;

In Allan Sherman captured the essence of this phrase in his 1963 album My Son, the Celebrity, with a parody of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;When I Was a Lad&quot;. In Sherman&#x27;s lyrics, the narrator joins an advertising firm:

In a double entendre reflecting the narrator&#x27;s mental dissonance, the group Harvey Danger used the phrase in their 1997 song &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot;:
As it became hackneyed, it got a second life as a launching point for the invention of joking variations, such as &quot;Let&#x27;s drop it in the pool and see if it makes a splash&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s throw it against the wall and see if it sticks&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s put it in a saucer and see if the cat licks it up&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s put it on the five-fifteen and see if it gets off at Westport&quot; (i.e., let&#x27;s put it on a New York City commuter train and find out whether it is destined for Westport, Connecticut, a town thought to be the home of many successful executives).

<text>Carmella Danielle DeCesare (born July 1, 1982) is an American model who was &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s Miss April 2003 and Playmate of the Year for 2004. She is also known for her time in WWE as a WWE Diva search contestant. She was featured in the 2008 &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; in the players&#x27; wives feature.

==Early life==
Carmella DeCesare was born July 1, 1982. A native of Avon Lake, Ohio, she is of Italian and Puerto Rican ancestry.

==Career==
===Modeling career===
Carmella DeCesare came to Playboy&#x27;s attention after she applied to a Fox reality show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Playboy Centerfold&quot; search. After she was selected as a finalist, she withdrew from the competition due to having second thoughts about the endeavor. When &quot;Playboy&quot; publisher Hugh Hefner learned this, he invited her to his birthday party and convinced her to change her mind. She was subsequently chosen as a Playboy Cyber Girl of the Week, then a Cyber Girl of the Month before becoming Playboy&#x27;s Miss April in 2003.

DeCesare appeared in the 2005 &quot;Playmates at Play at the Playboy Mansion&quot; swimsuit calendar as calendar girl of March. The calendar was the inaugural &quot;Playmates at Play&quot; calendar and it was shot on the grounds of the Playboy Mansion in 2004. It was &quot;Playboy&quot;″s first attempt at creating a non-nude swimsuit calendar featuring Playmates similar in style with those from &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot;. In 2005, DeCesare received breast implants. In an episode of the E! reality-TV series &quot;The Girls Next Door&quot; in August 2005, she said that her implants looked fake because they were new and had not fully settled.

DeCesare modeled in the 2008 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.

== Professional wrestling career ==
DeCesare made her first World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) appearance as a contestant in the 2004 WWE Diva Search. Following the Diva Search she feuded with Diva Search winner Christy Hemme which led to a Lingerie Pillow Fight match at Taboo Tuesday. She left the promotion soon after.

==Media==

=== Television ===
=== Video ===
==Charity work==
DeCesare and her husband, Jeff Garcia, founded the Garcia Pass It On Foundation in order to share resources with people in less fortunate circumstances.

==Legal issues==
On September 10, 2004, DeCesare pleaded not guilty to assault in a Cleveland, Ohio court after a fight in a bar on August 21, 2004 with a woman named Kristen Hine. She was acquitted of the assault charge on January 12, 2005 but found guilty of violating a restraining order. She was sentenced to do twenty-four hours of community service, given one year probation, and fined $150. During the trial, DeCesare testified that Jeff Garcia, her boyfriend at that time and the quarterback for the Cleveland Browns, had been involved in an affair with Hine after DeCesare&#x27;s and Garcia&#x27;s relationship began. Garcia commented, &quot;It&#x27;s embarrassing that I am here today, to be caught up in a situation like this.&quot;

==Personal life==
On April 21, 2007, DeCesare married then-NFL quarterback Jeff Garcia at the CordeValle Resort in San Martin, California. Their daughter was born in 2008. The couple&#x27;s second child was born in 2009. The couple&#x27;s third child was born in 2010. In December 2011 their fourth child was born. In a Christmas Day 2020 post on his Instagram account, Garcia stated that he and DeCesare were divorced, saying, &quot;Things happen but we are still great friends and co parent our beautiful 4 kids together.&quot;

<text>Waldemar Cierpinski (born 3 August 1950) is a former East German athlete and two-time Olympic champion in the marathon.

==Career==
Cierpinski was born in Neugattersleben, East Germany to Polish parents who had moved to Germany in 1945. He was originally a successful steeplechase runner but decided to switch to the marathon in 1974.

He was virtually unknown when he entered the 1976 Olympic marathon. He ran with the lead pack until American Frank Shorter broke free after the 25 km mark. Cierpinski chased Shorter down then took the lead, winning the race by 51 seconds. His victory was so unexpected that in the Olympic football final that evening, goalkeeper Jürgen Croy, invoked Cierpinski, a &quot;living example of mediocrity&quot;, to inspire East Germany to a 3–1 victory over fancied Poland.

Cierpinski finished in fourth place at the 1978 European Championships. In the 1980 Summer Olympics, he ran wisely and did not match the suicidal pace the leaders had set. He caught up to the leaders at the 36 km mark and soon led by a healthy margin. Although Gerard Nijboer from the Netherlands narrowed the gap in the last kilometre, Cierpinski sprinted the last 200 m to win his second consecutive Olympic gold medal and duplicate the feat of legendary Ethiopian Abebe Bikila of winning two straight Olympic marathons.

Cierpinski finished third in the marathon in the 1983 World Championships in Athletics. He was denied a chance of an unprecedented third Olympic marathon win by the Eastern Bloc boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, which was tit for tat for the United States-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. He left competition the same year and started a coaching career.

In &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; World Rankings, Cierpinski was ranked first in the marathon in 1976 and 1980 and eighth in 1978 and 1983.

Cierpinski is a member of the German Olympic Committee. Since 2007, Cierpinski has been an honorary member of the SG WiP Goettingen 06. He lives in Halle an der Saale.

==Drug allegations==
It is now well known that East Germany operated a state-sponsored system of providing performance-enhancing drugs to as many as 10,000 athletes from about 1968 to 1988. Cierpinski was implicated by East German track and field research files uncovered by Werner Franke at the Stasi headquarters in Leipzig in the late 1990s.

As a result, 1976 silver medallist Frank Shorter has advocated the belief that Cierpinski cheated and has supported official review of past performances, i.e. considering stripping medals from athletes who are found later on to have cheated, as a deterrent to drug-cheats. Fourth-place finisher Don Kardong has also written that he believed Cierpinski was involved in the East German doping program. Shorter&#x27;s allegations are very similar to those of Shirley Babashoff, who accused the East German women of drug cheating during the swimming events in the same Olympic Games, which was later substantiated by investigators in the PBS documentary &quot;Secrets of the Dead: Doping for Gold&quot;.

<doc id="883664" wikidata="Q1361206" url="?curid=883664" title="Post-exposure prophylaxis">
<text>Post-exposure prophylaxis, also known as post-exposure prevention (PEP), is any preventive medical treatment started after exposure to a pathogen in order to prevent the infection from occurring.

It should be contrasted with pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is used before the patient has been exposed to the infective agent.

==COVID-19==
In 2021, the US FDA gave emergency use authorization (EUA) to bamlanivimab/etesevimab for post-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19. However, due to its reduced effectiveness against Omicron variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is no longer recommended for this purpose.

Ensitrelvir has been studied for its potential use as post-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19 in a phase 3 clinical trial. Top-line results from this trial suggested that use of ensitrelvir as post-exposure prophylaxis may significantly reduce the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection in exposed household contacts compared to placebo.

== Rabies ==
PEP is commonly and very effectively used to prevent the onset of rabies after a bite by a suspected-rabid animal, since diagnostic tools are not available to detect rabies infection prior to the onset of the nearly always-fatal disease. The treatment consists of a series of injections of rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin. Rabies vaccine is given to both humans and animals who have been potentially exposed to rabies.

As of 2018, the average estimated cost of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis was US$ 108 (along with travel costs and loss of income).

== Tetanus ==
Tetanus toxoid can be given in case of a suspected exposure to tetanus. In such cases, it can be given with or without tetanus immunoglobulin (also called &quot;tetanus antibodies&quot; or &quot;tetanus antitoxin&quot;). It can be given as intravenous therapy or by intramuscular injection.

The guidelines for such events in the United States for non-pregnant people 11 years and older are as follows:

== HIV ==
=== History ===
AZT was approved as a treatment for AIDS in 1987. Healthcare workers would occasionally be exposed to HIV during work. Some people thought to try giving health care workers AZT to prevent seroconversion. This practice dramatically decreased the incidence of seroconversion among health workers when done under certain conditions.

Later the questions arose of whether to give HIV treatment after known exposure or high risk of exposure. Early data from preclinical studies established the efficacy of AZT in preventing transmission of HIV infection. AZT was also seen to reduce maternal-infant transmission of HIV in a randomized controlled trial, suggesting AZT&#x27;s post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) use. Subsequent data show combination antiretroviral therapy is significantly superior than AZT in reducing perinatal transmission rates. In addition, AZT is generally no longer recommended due to poor tolerance resulting in high rates of patient noncompliance.

Non-occupational exposures include cases when a condom breaks while a person with HIV has sex with an HIV-negative person in a single incidence, or in the case of unprotected sex with an anonymous partner, or in the case of a non-habitual incident of sharing a syringe for injection drug use. Evidence suggests that PEP also reduces the risk of HIV infection in these cases. In 2005, the US DHHS released the first recommendations for non-occupational PEP (nPEP) use to lower risk of HIV infection after exposures. The recommendations were replaced with an updated guideline in 2016.

Occupational exposures include needlestick injury of health care professionals from an HIV-infected source. In 2012, the US DHHS included guidelines on occupational PEP (oPEP) use for individuals with HIV exposures occurring in health care settings.

Since taking HIV-attacking medications shortly after exposure was proven to reduce the risk of contracting HIV, this led to research into pre-exposure prophylaxis by taking medication before a potential exposure to HIV occurred.

A report from early 2013 revealed that a female baby born with the HIV virus displayed no sign of the virus two years after high doses of three antiretroviral drugs were administered within 30 hours of her birth. The findings of the case were presented at the 2013 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Atlanta, U.S. and the baby is from Mississippi, U.S. The baby—known as the &quot;Mississippi baby&quot;—was considered to be the first child to be &quot;functionally cured&quot; of HIV. However, HIV re-emerged in the child as of July 2014.

=== Risk evaluation ===
Initiation of post-exposure prophylaxis with the use of antiretroviral drugs is dependent on a number of risk factors, though treatment is usually started after one high-risk event. In order to determine whether post-exposure prophylaxis is indicated, an evaluation visit will be conducted to consider risk factors associated with developing HIV. Assessments at this visit will include whether the at-risk person or the potential source-person are HIV positive, details around the potential HIV exposure event, including timing and circumstances, whether other high-risk events have occurred in the past, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, testing for hepatitis B and C (nPEP is also effective against hepatitis B), and pregnancy tests for women of childbearing potential.

Risk factors for developing HIV includes exposure of mucous membranes (vagina, rectum, eye, mouth, broken skin or under the skin) of an HIV-negative person to bodily fluids (blood, semen, rectal secretions, vaginal secretions, breast milk) of a person known to be HIV positive. For example, having unprotected sex with HIV positive partner is considered risky, but sharing sex toys, spitting and biting considered to be negligible risks for initiating post-exposure prophylaxis. The highest non-sexual risk is blood transfusion and the highest sexual contact risk is receptive anal intercourse. The timing of exposure does not affect the risk of developing HIV, but it does alter whether post-exposure prophylaxis will be recommended. Exposures that occurred 72 hours or less to beginning treatment are eligible for post-exposure prophylaxis. If the exposure occurred over 73 hours prior to treatment initiation, post-exposure prophylaxis is not indicated.

=== Testing ===
Initial HIV testing: Before initiating PEP after potential HIV exposure, persons should be tested for HIV1 and HIV2 antigens and antibodies in the blood using a rapid diagnostic test. PEP should only be started if rapid diagnostic test reveals no HIV infection present or if tests results are not available. However, if HIV infection is already present then PEP should not be started. HIV testing should be repeated four to six weeks and three months after exposure.

People may experience signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection, including fever, fatigue, myalgia, and skin rash, while taking PEP. CDC recommends seeking medical attention for evaluation if these signs and symptoms occur during or after the month of PEP. If follow-up laboratory antibody tests reveal HIV infection, HIV treatment specialists should be sought out and PEP should not be discontinued until person is evaluated and treatment plan is established.

STI and HBV testing: People with potential exposure to HIV are also at risk of acquiring STI and HBV. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends STI-specific nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for gonorrhea and chlamydia and blood tests for syphilis. PEP is also active against HBV infections so discontinuation of medication can cause the reactivation of HBV, though rare. Health care providers must monitor HBV status closely.

Follow up testing: Serum creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance should be measured at baseline to determine the most appropriate PEP antiretroviral regimen. While on PEP, liver function, renal function, and hematologic parameters should be monitored.

=== Treatment ===
In the case of HIV exposure, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a course of antiretroviral drugs which reduces the risk of seroconversion after events with high risk of exposure to HIV (e.g., unprotected anal or vaginal sex, needlestick injuries, or sharing needles). The CDC recommends PEP for any HIV-negative person who has recently been exposed to HIV for any reason.

To be most effective, treatment should begin within an hour of exposure. After 72 hours PEP is much less effective, and may not be effective at all. Prophylactic treatment for HIV typically lasts four weeks.

While there is compelling data to suggest that PEP after HIV exposure is effective, there have been cases where it has failed. Failure has often been attributed to the delay in receiving treatment (greater than 72 hours post-exposure), the level of exposure, and/or the duration of treatment (lack of adherence to the 28-day regimen). In addition, since the time and level of non-occupational exposures are self-reported, there is no absolute data on the administration timeframe to which PEP would be efficacious. The standard antibody window period begins after the last day of PEP treatment. People who received PEP are typically advised to get an antibody test at 6 months post-exposure as well as the standard 3 month test.

The antiretroviral regimen used in PEP is the same as the standard highly active antiretroviral therapy used to treat AIDS. A typical prescription is a 28-day course of emtricitabine/tenofovir pills containing 200 mg of emtricitabine and 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil to be taken once daily, along with either 50 mg of dolutegravir once daily or 400 mg of raltegravir twice daily. People initiating nPEP treatment typically receive a 28-day starter pack rather than a 3–7 day starter pack, to facilitate strong medication adherence. They should also be counseled on unpleasant side effects including malaise, fatigue, diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, and insomnia, depending on the medication administered.

People at high risk for re-exposure due to unprotected intercourse or other behavioral factors should begin PrEP immediately after the completion of the nPEP treatment course. Conversely, if a medically adherent patient is already taking PrEP medication upon non-occupational exposure, nPEP treatment is not necessary.

== Hepatitis A ==
For exposure to hepatitis A, human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) and/or hepatitis A vaccine may be used as PEP depending on the clinical situation.

== Hepatitis B ==
If the person exposed is an HBsAg positive source (a known responder to HBV vaccine) then if exposed to hepatitis B a booster dose should be given. If they are in the process of being vaccinated or are a non-responder they need to have hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the vaccine. For known non-responders HBIG and the vaccine should be given whilst those in the process of being vaccinated should have an accelerated course of HBV vaccine.

== Hepatitis C ==

Persons exposed to hepatitis C should be tested monthly with PCR, and if seroconversion occurs then treatment with interferon, or possibly ribavirin.

== Anthrax ==
A 60-day course of oral ciprofloxacin should be given when exposure to anthrax is suspected.

== Lyme disease ==
A single 200 milligram oral dose of doxycycline may be used within 3 days of a deer tick bite in a high risk area (such as New England), if the tick was attached for at least 36 hours.

== Poxviruses ==
The smallpox vaccine decreases the incidence risk of severe illness when administered after exposure to mpox and smallpox. The CDC advises &quot;that smallpox vaccine be given within 4 days from the date of exposure to prevent onset of the disease but should be offered up to 14 days post-exposure&quot;; the NHS concurs with this but also urges to vaccinate as soon as possible after exposure.

<doc id="883666" wikidata="Q1944060" url="?curid=883666" title="Monarchomachs">
<text>The Monarchomachs () were originally French Huguenot theorists who opposed monarchy at the end of the 16th century, known in particular for having theoretically justified tyrannicide. The term was originally a pejorative word coined in 1600 by the Scottish royalist and Catholic William Barclay (1548–1608) from the Greek μόναρχος (&quot;monarchos&quot; &quot;monarch, sole ruler&quot;) and μάχομαι (&quot;makhomai&quot; the verb meaning &quot;to fight&quot;), meaning &quot;those who fight against monarchs&quot; or &quot;anti-monarchists&quot;.

Born out of the French Wars of Religion, they were most active between 1573, a year after the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, and 1584. The Monarchomachs pleaded in favour of a form of &quot;popular sovereignty&quot;. Arguing for a sort of contract between the sovereign and the people, they have been considered as the precursors of social contract theories.

== Theory of tyrannicide ==

The Monarchomachs included jurists such as the Calvinists François Hotman (1524–1590), Théodore de Bèze (1519–1605), Simon Goulart (1543–1628), Nicolas Barnaud (1538–1604), Hubert Languet (1518–1581), Philippe de Mornay (1549–1623) and George Buchanan (1506–1582), as well as Catholic writers such as Juan de Mariana (1536–1624). They had a special influence in the so-called Dutch revolt and contributed to the Netherlands&#x27; Act of Abjuration. Through the means of libels and theoretical tracts, they revived the doctrine of the tyrannicide. It had been opposed during the Middle Ages by the &quot;legists&quot; (jurists who theorized the royal power) who attempted to reserve the title of tyrant to those who tried to overturn the ruling monarch. Legists thus ended up legitimizing, under the name of &quot;tyrannicide&quot;, the assassinations of political opponents ordered by the monarch. The Dutch Constitutional Law professor A.M. Donner on page 16 of his state law manual calls Johannus Althusius &quot;the last of the monarchomachs&quot;. Typically Johannes Althusius in his &quot;Politica&quot; opposes Jean Bodin.

Monarchomachs considered that the end of the state was prosperity of the whole social group, as the true sovereign, granting effective practice of power to the king, whose authority remained of divine right. Exercise of popular sovereignty was to be delegated to the magistrates and the officers of the crown. They considered that the people were a collective body, possessed of a specific wisdom, which allowed them to understand better than the king the common good, distinct from the interest of each of its parties. Assimilated to the medieval &quot;&quot;, the people was thus considered as a legal subject, whose interests were represented by the General Estates. This conception of the magistrates and the association of wise people as best representants of the people separated them from modern conception of democracy, as they restricted effective power to a minority. Max Weber considered them in his lecture &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot; as participants of the movement of rationalization of law in Europe.

The Monarchomachs also claimed that if the sovereign persecuted true religion, he would violate the contract concluded between God and the people, who were thus granted a right of rebellion. They were inspired by Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and the School of Salamanca on the killing of &quot;bad kings&quot;. This legitimization of tyrannicide may have inspired as much the friar Clément, who assassinated Henry III in 1589, as Ravaillac, who assassinated Henry IV in 1610. Rebellion against tyranny was considered not only as necessary, but as a divine right.

== Monarchomach theory in the 16th century ==

The term &quot;Monarchomachs&quot; was coined by William Barclay in his book &quot;De Regno et Regali Potestate&quot; (”About the Powers of Authority and Royalty”), published in 1600. Barclay&#x27;s theory was that the Huguenots had lost their struggle with the Catholic Church and were turning their battle towards the government to undermine the king&#x27;s support of the Catholics. Eventually, the term was used to classify anyone who was opposed to the king&#x27;s rule.

At first a Protestant doctrine, the notion of tyrannicide was reappropriated by the Catholics when Protestants came to be kings. It was then used in revolutionary discourses during the debates concerning the execution of Louis XVI, while the right of rebellion was included in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

Influenced by the Huguenots, some British thinkers also embraced the Monarchomaque movement.

<doc id="883670" wikidata="Q1471412" url="?curid=883670" title="IAAF World Athletics Final">
<text>The IAAF World Athletics Final was an annual track and field competition organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). It was inaugurated in 2003 to replace the IAAF Grand Prix Final. The competition was part of the IAAF World Athletics Series and was the seasonal culmination of the IAAF World Outdoor Meetings series from 2003 to 2005, then the IAAF World Athletics Tour from 2006 to 2009. Due to changes in the one-day meeting system introduced by the IAAF, the World Athletics Final was discontinued after the 2009 season.

==History==
The competition was introduced as part of the overhaul of the IAAF Grand Prix, with the IAAF World Outdoor Meetings series replacing it as the IAAF&#x27;s primary seasonal outdoor track and field series. The programme of the former IAAF Grand Prix Final competition varied from year to year and the IAAF World Athletics Final introduced a fixed programme of events. The new schedule comprised events which were largely similar to those held at the World Athletics Championships. The differences were that a 3000 metres race was included at the World Athletics Final, while the 10,000 metres, marathon, combined events (decathlon and heptathlon), race walks and relay races were omitted as these events generally did not feature at IAAF outdoor track and field meetings.

The first three editions of the competition were held in Monaco. However, the competition&#x27;s stadium in Fontvieille, the Stade Louis II, was not of an adequate size to hold the hammer throw competition. As a result, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hammer events were generally held a week earlier than the competition itself, taking place in Szombathely, Hungary at the Stadion Rohonci Út.

This situation was resolved in 2006 by a move to the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion (Mercedes-Benz Arena) in Stuttgart, which had previously held the 1993 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2007 and 2008 editions of the final were also held there. The IAAF World Athletics Final changed to an alternating host city format in 2009, beginning with Thessaloniki, because the 2009 World Championships in Athletics had also been held in Germany that year. However, although the IAAF agreed in 2008 that Rabat, Morocco would be the venue for the 2010 Final, general secretary Pierre Weiss confirmed that the last edition would the 2009 competition as a result of changes in the structure of the one-day outdoor meetings tour.

Over its seven-year history, Asafa Powell and Meseret Defar were the most successful male and female athletes: Defar won nine events and Powell won five in total. After Defar, Tatyana Lebedeva and Sanya Richards were the second and third highest earners of the competition. In terms of the 87 nations represented over the history of the World Athletics Final, the United States dominated the performance lists with 56 winners – over twice that of second placed Kenya. Russia, Jamaica, Germany and Ethiopia rounded out the top six nations by performance. This underlined these countries&#x27; strength in depth of athletes as—unlike the World Championships—there was no limit on the number of athletes representing a specific nation.

==Competition structure==
===Qualification===

The results of the World Athletics Tour, an annual series of 25 athletics meetings, were used to form a points ranking system. Over the course of a year, athletes were awarded points for their performance in each specific event. The number of points earned depended upon both the athlete&#x27;s finishing position in the race and the level of the competition. The IAAF Golden League and IAAF Super Grand Prix meetings formed the upper tier of competition, followed by the intermediate tier of IAAF Grand Prix meetings. Additionally, it was possible to earn a limited number of points at Area Permit Meetings, although an athlete had to compete in at least one of the higher level competitions to qualify for the World Athletics Final. Furthermore, athletes were awarded bonus points if they broke or equalled a world record at a World Athletics Tour meeting.

The rankings were calculated by combining the points total of an athlete&#x27;s five best performances on the World Athletics Tour (or four best performances in the throwing events). After the end of the final meeting of the season&#x27;s World Athletics Tour, the top seven ranked athletes in each event received qualification into that event at the World Athletics Final. In the events of 1500 metres or longer, the top eleven athletes were allowed to compete at the final. In the event of a tie, the athlete with the superior season&#x27;s best was entered into the Final. One additional athlete was allocated to each event as a wild card. In the event of absence or cancellation of a qualified athlete, the IAAF offered invitations to suitable athletes who did not originally qualify. However, any athletes who won a share of the IAAF Golden League US$1 million jackpot that year had to attend the competition in order to receive the prize.

===Final competition format===
The World Athletics Final was held over two days and comprised 36 athletic events, 18 for athletes of each gender. The events remained largely unchanged, with the only difference since the 2003 inauguration being the addition of the women&#x27;s 3000 metres steeplechase. Each event at the World Athletics Final featured eight athletes, with an extra four athletes competing in each of the 1500 metres, 3000 metres, 5000 metres and 3000 metres steeplechase races.

All competitors received prize money rising from US$1,000 for the 9th to 12th-placed athletes in the longer distance races to US$30,000 for the winner in each event. A further US$100,000 was awarded to any athlete breaking a world record.

<doc id="883672" wikidata="Q632482" url="?curid=883672" title="Kentucky Colonel">
<text>Kentucky Colonel is the highest title of honor bestowed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. It is the most well known colonelcy in the United States. A Kentucky Colonel Commission (the certificate) is awarded in the name of the Commonwealth by the governor of Kentucky to individuals with &quot;Honorable&quot; titular style recognition preceding the names of civilians aged 18 or over, for noteworthy accomplishments, contributions to civil society, remarkable deeds, or outstanding service to the community, state, or a nation. The Governor bestows the honorable title with a colonelcy commission, by issuance of letters patent.

While many famous and noteworthy people have received commissions as Kentucky colonels, the award is equally available to those of all backgrounds based on their deeds. A Kentucky Colonel is traditionally considered a goodwill ambassador of the Kentucky state, culture, folklore, traditions and values.

Although Kentucky colonels are considered in Common Law to be aides-de-camp to the governors and members of their staff and thus entitled to the style of &quot;Honorable&quot;, Kentucky colonels are usually just referred to and addressed as &quot;Colonel&quot; and use the abbreviation &quot;Col.&quot; or &quot;Kentucky colonel&quot; when the term is not being used as a specific title for an individual. Most properly in writing this becomes &quot;Col. First Name, Middle, Surname, Kentucky Colonel&quot;.

==History==
=== First Kentucky Colonels ===
In 1776, Col. John Bowman was the first Kentucky colonel officially appointed. Col. John Bowman was appointed as colonel of the Militia of Kentucky County by Governor of the Colony of Virginia, Patrick Henry. Notable pioneer, Daniel Boone was given the title &quot;colonel&quot; by Col. Judge Richard Henderson in 1775 when he founded the settlement of Boonesborough. Boone was not officially granted a Kentucky colonelcy until 1780 when he was commissioned by the governor of Virginia. At the time Kentucky colonelcy was still military appointment in contrast to the modern Kentucky colonelcy which is an honorary title for civilians.

Charles S. Todd is often mistakenly believed to be the first recipient an honorary commission of a Kentucky colonel in 1813. This is disputed by Col. Todd&#x27;s biography, and US military archives. The identity of first civilian honorary colonel is not known. In 1895, Governor William O&#x27;Connell Bradley commissioned the first honorary Kentucky colonels as an award of merit bestowed upon citizens for their individual contributions to the state, good deeds, and noteworthy actions.

=== Kentucky Colonels in Literature ===
In 1784, John Filson published his book &quot;The discovery, settlement and present state of Kentucke&quot; which contained an appendix entitled &quot;The adventures of Col. Daniel Boon, one of the first settlers&quot;&quot;&quot;. Filson&#x27;s book gained popularity and Boone became a symbol of American pioneering. There became increased interest in the trans-Appalachian West among both Europeans and Americans. Filson&#x27;s &quot;The adventures of Col. Daniel Boon, one of the first settlers&quot; was reprinted in France, Germany, England and New York. With the widespread fame of Filson&#x27;s novel came a greater recognition of Kentucky and its colonelcy.

In 1890 Opie Read published &quot;A Kentucky Colonel&quot; which spawned a new public perception of what a Kentucky colonel was, posing himself more as a refined, well-mannered southern gentleman, rather than a figure in the Kentucky militia. In 1905, this view was expanded by Zoe Anderson Norris publishing &quot;Twelve Kentucky Colonel Stories: Describing Scenes and Incidents in a Kentucky Colonel&#x27;s Life in the Southland&quot; in &quot;The New York Sun&quot;.

=== Contemporary History ===
In 1931, a story about the growing amount of Kentucky colonels emerged, &quot;Thousand New Kunnels, Suh, In 25 Years&quot;. Prior to 1932, only about 1,000 people had received official &quot;Honorable&quot; commissions as Kentucky colonels from Kentucky&#x27;s governors. Governor Ruby Laffoon, in office from 1931 to 1935, dramatically increased the number of colonels by issuing more than 10,000 commissions in 1933 and 1934; among his motives was officializing the Kentucky colonel to identify with the Commonwealth, taxing the title of colonel, and boosting his own political support. One of his most famous colonelships was granted to restaurateur Harland Sanders, who was commissioned by Laffoon in 1935. 

When Governor Albert Benjamin Chandler (better known as Happy Chandler) took office in 1935, he took a very different view on the distinction of a Kentucky colonel commission and only issued about a dozen new commissions annually, on Derby Day. Governor Keen Johnson followed Governor Chandler&#x27;s lead during his time in office from 1939 to 1943, commissioning only those select individuals who were deemed to have exhibited exceptionally noteworthy accomplishments and outstanding service to a community, state or the nation. The subsequent governors, however, have typically been much more liberal in issuing Kentucky colonel commissions.

== Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels ==

The Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels (HOKC) was first established during the depression in 1933 by Governor Ruby Laffoon as a state order of merit with an office at the capital. In 1957, it was incorporated as a nonprofit dedicated to building playgrounds, curating history, awarding scholarships and providing relief to Kentuckians in need.

After a person receives a commission from the governor they automatically become an &quot;honorary lifetime member&quot; of the organization and, via donation to and participation in the HOKC&#x27;s charitable efforts throughout the state they can be considered an active member.

=== Kentucky colonel toast ===
In 1936, New York advertising agency owner, Kentucky colonel Arthur Kudner, wrote a toast to Kentucky colonels. The toast was quickly adopted by the HOKC, and it was widely promoted and published for use by colonels. The toast has since been ceremoniously presented at each of the Kentucky Colonels&#x27; Derby Eve Banquets:

=== Involvement in the Nomination Process ===
In 2016, Governor Matt Bevin briefly suspended the program to conduct a review of the requirements for receiving the title and then changed the nomination process so that &quot;only active members of the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels&quot; were allowed to make recommendations for the honor. Up to that point in time, the longstanding practice had been that recommendations could be submitted by anyone who already was a Kentucky colonel, without any requirement for donations or membership in any particular organization. The nomination process was changed under Governor Andy Beshear. Beshear had the nomination process frozen starting in December 2019. In February 2020, Governor Beshear removed the requirement that the nominators be among those previously designated as Kentucky Colonels.

=== Lawsuits ===
The Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels filed a Federal lawsuit against Kentucky Colonels International in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky in 2020. The lawsuit alleged infringement of the registered trademark &quot;Kentucky Colonels ®&quot; . In 2021, the parties settled the case with a permanent Injunction prohibiting Kentucky Colonels International from using the &quot;Kentucky Colonels ®&quot; trademark. In 2023, The Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels opened a new lawsuit against Kentucky Colonels International for &quot;one count of civil contempt, four counts of various federal trademark infringement, one count anticybersquatting, and three counts of various common law trademark infringement&quot;. In August 2023 the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels won their lawsuit. David J. Wright and his organization Kentucky Colonels International were held in contempt of the Permanent Injunction and ordered to pay legal fees of the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels.

== Kentucky colonel influence on culture ==
Starting around 1889, culture began incorporating the idea of the Kentucky Colonel as the name or part of the name of bars, beer, bourbon, barbecue, burgoo, clubs, hotels, food, liquor stores, plants, restaurants, social venues, sports teams, tobacco products and even a political lobby. The Kentucky Colonel has always been most notorious for drinking bourbon, making moonshine liquor, storytelling and dueling over their honor starting in the 19th century. Likewise the Kentucky colonel has been portrayed in a number of films, cartoons, movies, books and featured in newspapers since as early as the 1850s.

Those who have received a Kentucky colonelcy commission have often used the title, idea or the image of the concept of the idealistic Kentucky Colonel to promote art, business, events, music, places and recreational activities while simultaneously promoting the state&#x27;s customs and traditions, resulting in the honor becoming a well-recognized trademark of Kentucky&#x27;s culture. As it was explained by the defense in the U.S. District Court in 2020, &quot;the idea and image of the Kentucky Colonel and Kentucky colonels is inextricably intertwined with the state&quot;.

Examples of the concept of the Kentucky Colonel being used to promote a product or idea include:
*Colonel G.W. Gist built the first modern hotel in Tulsa, Oklahoma, called the Kentucky Colonel Hotel, in 1903.
*Col. Matt Winn was present at the first race at Churchill Downs in 1875 and helped to turn it into the Kentucky Derby.
*The 1960s bluegrass band Kentucky Colonels included Clarence White (later with The Byrds).
*A wide range of memorabilia has been created for sale or recognition including by the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels.
*A number of sports teams in Kentucky, have been known as the Kentucky Colonels including the Kentucky Colonels professional basketball team of 1967–1976, the Kentucky Colonels professional basketball team of 2004, and the Eastern Kentucky Colonels athletic teams of Eastern Kentucky University. The athletic teams from Centre College in Danville are also known as the Colonels.
*Harland David Sanders (1890 – 1980) used his title of &quot;Colonel&quot; and his own personal determination to make himself and Kentucky world-famous for fried chicken. From a gas station in Corbin, Kentucky, Colonel Sanders (as he became known) started the fast food franchise Kentucky Fried Chicken, known today as KFC. He became so well known, both nationally and internationally, that he was often referred to simply as &quot;The Colonel&quot;, which is also the title of a book that was written about his life.

=== Bourbon whiskey ===
The Kentucky colonel title in business marketing is seen in the ongoing historic association between Kentucky and bourbon whiskey production. As of 2013, approximately 95 percent of all bourbon was produced in Kentucky, and the state had 4.9 million barrels of bourbon in the process of aging. The historic distiller James B. Beam is referred to as &quot;Colonel James B. Beam&quot; for the marketing of the Jim Beam brand (the largest-selling brand of bourbon). The Sazerac Company similarly refers to the distiller Albert Blanton as &quot;Colonel Blanton&quot; for their marketing of the Blanton&#x27;s brand. In both cases, the &quot;Colonel&quot; title refers to being a Kentucky colonel. A brand of Kentucky bourbon called Kentucky Colonel was produced in the 1980s, and at least two current brands of Kentucky bourbon have the word &quot;Colonel&quot; in their name, the Colonel E. H. Taylor and Colonel Lee bourbon brands. In 2020 the Neeley Family Distillery (a craft bourbon distiller) in Sparta, Kentucky filed for the trademark &quot;Old Kentucky Colonel&quot; to bring back the original Kentucky Colonel brand.

== Kentucky colonel nominations ==
Each governor decides the selection process and number of colonelcies that are issued. The process has previously required a nomination from another colonel or direct recognition by the governor but, under the process established by Governor Andy Beshear, nominations and recommendations for other people can be submitted by both Kentucky colonels and members of the general public by completing an online form.

<text>Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer or TES was a satellite instrument designed to measure the state of the earth&#x27;s troposphere.

==Overview==
TES was a high-resolution infrared Fourier Transform spectrometer and provided key data for studying tropospheric chemistry, troposphere-biosphere interaction, and troposphere-stratosphere exchanges. It was built for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. It was successfully launched into polar orbit by a Delta II 7920-10L rocket aboard NASA&#x27;s third Earth Observing Systems spacecraft (EOS-Aura) at 10:02 UTC on July 15, 2004. Originally planned as a 5-year mission, it was decommissioned after almost 14 years on January 31, 2018.

<doc id="883698" wikidata="Q1150410" url="?curid=883698" title="Battle of Boyacá">
<text>The Battle of Boyacá (1819), also known as the Battle of Boyacá Bridge was a decisive victory by a combined army of Venezuelan and New Granadan troops along with a British Legion led by General Simon Bolivar over the III Division of the Spanish Expeditionary Army of Costa Firme commanded by Spanish Colonel José Barreiro. This victory ensured the success of Bolívar&#x27;s campaign to liberate New Granada. The battle of Boyaca is considered the beginning of the independence of the north of South America, and is considered important because it led to the victories of the battle of Carabobo in Venezuela, Pichincha in Ecuador, and Junín and Ayacucho in Peru. New Granada acquired its definitive independence from the Spanish Monarchy, although fighting with royalist forces would continue for years.

Under the overall command of General Simon Bolivar, the Brigadier Generals Francisco de Paula Santander and José Antonio Anzoátegui led a combined patriot army of Neogranadines and Venezuelans that defeated in two hours the Spanish Royalist forces led by Spanish Colonels José María Barreiro and Francisco Jiménez who would both be captured in battle. The effective destruction of the Royalist Army led to the collapse of the Royalist Government in the capital of Santa Fe with Viceroy Juan de Samano along with other government officials fleeing the capital shortly after news had reached of the battle. The battle led to the liberation of much of central New Granada and would lead to the union between New Granada and Venezuela creating the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia) in December of that same year. 

The battle occurred 150 km from Bogotá in the Andes Mountains, in a place known as &quot;Casa de Teja&quot;, close to a bridge over the Teatinos River and 3 roads heading to Samaca, Motavita and Tunja, an area which is now part of the Boyacá Department. The site of the battlefield today is dotted with various monuments and statues that commemorate the battle.

==Prelude==

General Simon Bolivar&#x27;s Patriot Army surprised the Spanish by strategically crossing the Andes Mountain Range through the Paramo de Pisba into the Boyacá region in early July of 1819, however the march had weakened his army. To prevent this threat from growing stronger, Viceroy Juan de Samano ordered the commander of the Spanish forces in New Granada–which were the III Division of the Expeditionary Army of Costa Firme, led by artillery Colonel Jose Maria Barreiro to intercept and defeat Bolivar&#x27;s army to prevent him from reaching the capital of Santa Fe. This would lead to the two forces clashing at the Battle of Vargas Swamp on July 25.

After Bolívar secured a narrow victory at the Battle of Vargas Swamp on July 25th, the Patriot Army camped near the vicinity of the battlefield, while Spanish Forces camped in the nearby town of Paipa. Both armies still had the same goal of reaching the capital Santa Fe, which was only defended by some 400 Spanish troops. On August 3, still camped in Paipa the Spanish observed Bolivar&#x27;s forces cross the Chicamocha River near Paipa and then at night observed him by candlelight retreat to his original positions across the river. The Spanish then rested unaware of Bolivar&#x27;s feint, as he ordered a nocturnal countermarch crossing the river again and taking the alternate route to the city of Tunja through the Toca Road.

This allowed Bolivar to outmaneuver his Spanish counterpart and gain the lead for the race to Santa Fe, a reversal of the previous situation with Bolivar now trying to prevent Barreiro from reaching the capital. On August 4 at 9:00 am the Patriot Army reached the village of Chivata and 2 hours later entered and occupied the city of Tunja. The city had been lightly defended as a small garrison and the Governor Juan Lono had left the city in the direction of Paipa to give Colonel Barreiro the supplies and reinforcements he had begged the Viceroy for, in the city Bolivar was able to obtain 600 rifles for his army. 

Barreiro would eventually find out about this on August 5 and quickly marched his army southwest, midday he rendezvoused with Governor Juan Lono who provided him with 12,000 cartridges and 3 artillery pieces (2 howitzers and 1 cannon) that had been sent by the Viceroy. Upon learning that Bolivar had taken the city and seeing that his line of communication with the capital was cut, he ordered his army march around Tunja through the mountains northwest of the city at night through roads deemed impassable during the rainy season to avoid detection and gain the lead once gain. This march began in the town of Combita at 1 am August 6 and then proceeded to Motavita through a heavy downpour reaching the town at 11:30am where the army camped for the night. Marching through Motavita was considered a wise move strategically for the Spanish, due to its higher elevation one is able to observe Tunja from it. However Barreiro&#x27;s movement did not go undetected and patriot spies informed Bolivar of their movements

== Battle ==
At 3:30 a.m. on Saturday, August 7, the Royalist army departed Motavita and continued their march towards Santa Fe. From Motavita they marched down the Samaca road with the intention of rejoining the main &quot;Camino Real&quot; (Royal Road to Santa Fe) at the Casa de Teja or Casa de Postas where the road formed a Y shape as both the Samaca road and Camino Real converged and became a single road that crossed the Boyacá Bridge. The Boyacá Bridge was an important bridge that was part of the &quot;Camino Real de Santa Fe,&quot; where it crossed the Teatinos River which was swollen at this time of year as a result of winter rain season. The distance to the bridge was only 25 km which the Spanish completed in 7 hours 30 minutes, at an average pace of 18 minutes per kilometer. Early morning that same day at 7 am, Bolivar left Tunja and took up an observation point at the San Lazaro heights near Tunja, from there around 9 am he spotted the Royalist Army and was able to deduce the route that they were taking. A little after 10 through Colonel Manuel Manrique he ordered that

Upon receiving this order, General Santander&#x27;s Vanguard Division set out from Tunja toward Casa de Teja on the &quot;Camino Real&quot; with Anzoátegui&#x27;s Rearguard Division following suit. Since 7am the Patriot army had been assembled in the central plaza of Tunja ready to move out at a moments notice, the bridge lay some 16km from Tunja, the Patriot army completed this in around 4 hours of marching. Between the hours of 12 to 1pm a fraction of the Royalist vanguard which was composed of the 2nd and 3rd Numancia infantry battalions along with some dragoons under the command of Colonel Francisco Jiménez arrived and took up position near the Casa de Teja, from where they could observe the bridge. Jiménez observing that there was no presence of patriot forces in the vicinity allowed his troops to rest and ordered that lunch rations be served.

Shortly before 2:00 p.m., patriot Captain Andres Ibarra and his forces spotted the Casa de Teja and the vanguard of the Spanish Army. The Spaniards spotted him too and the two exchanged fire, with Jimenez ordering his men to follow and engage what he believed was only a small observation force. 20 royalists chased after the Patriot force but later returned when they realized that this was a bigger force. General Santander who came marching down the &quot;Camino Real&quot; with the rest of the patriot vanguard upon seeing this unfold ordered Lieutenant Colonel Joaquín París commander of the &quot;Cazadores&quot; Battalion to attack the Royalist forces at the Casa Teja. 

The Spanish vanguard was forced to fall back to river and crossed the strategic bridge over the Teatinos River and took defensive positions there. Meanwhile, the full vanguard of the Patriot army under Santander had reached Casa de Teja. The two vanguards now found themselves on opposite sides of the river, with this Santander then ordered Colonel Antonio Bejar to take some forces down the river and cross it in order to attack the Spanish vanguard from the rear. The Spanish rearguard was still several kilometers behind, so General Anzoátegui ordered to block the way between the vanguard and the rearguard of the Spanish forces. The rearguard, outnumbered, retreated to a small hill close to Casa de Teja.

Anzoátegui then ordered a flank attack on the Spanish rearguard: battalions Barcelona and Bravos de Paez were to attack on the right side while the Legion Britanica and Rifles Battalion attacked on the left. The British Legion was a special forces squad composed of British and Irish people, which aided the revolutionary army in certain key battles for independence in South American countries. Unable to cross the river the Spanish assumed battle positions by the Casa de Teja: in the center they positioned three artillery pieces surrounded by the King&#x27;s 1st infantry battalion to the left and the King&#x27;s 2nd infantry battalion on the right, and on the wings, the Mounted Grenadiers and Dragoon cavalry units. Arthur Sandes commander of Rifles Battalion charged the royalist artillery. This charge disrupted the arming of the 3 artillery pieces the Spanish possessed (they had transported them unassembled) only one of them was able to be assembled which allowed it to fire 3 shots before the gun carriage that supported it broke rendering it useless. Outnumbered, the Spanish rear guard began to retreat without any clear direction. Therefore, Bolívar ordered lancers units to attack the center of the Royalist infantry, the 3rd and 5th companies of the Granadan Dragoons charged the Patriot cavalry however the patriot cavalry conducted a turn face maneuver causing the dragoons to retreat as the patriot lancers had longer lances than they did. The other Spanish cavalry squadron the Mounted Grenadiers, ran away from the battle via the road towards Samaca. The charge of two patriot army cavalry squadrons caused panic amongst the Spanish troops, who were formed up in a column to resist the attack, although they were given the order to perform a bayonet charge this was not carried out due to the panic and confusion. Barreiro and his officers tried in vain to contain the rout of their soldiers and dismounted from their horses which condemned them to easily be captured by their enemy.

Meanwhile, one kilometer and a half behind Casa de Teja, Bejar&#x27;s Patriot vanguard managed to ford the river and was approaching the rear of the Royalist vanguard force. Once it reached them, the vanguard forces engaged in battle, while this occurred Santander led a charge across the bridge by force, using bayonets. The Spanish forces fled, leaving on the bridge their leader, Colonel Juan Tolrá who was killed. As the assembly of enemy prisoners began, the battle was over shortly after 4:30 p.m have only lasted a little more than 2 hours. The Patriots only suffered 66 casualties in total with some 13 dead and 53 wounded, meanwhile Barreiro&#x27;s III Division was effectively dismantled as a result of the battle suffering 100 dead, 150 wounded, and 1,600 captured.

==Aftermath ==

For their actions on the battlefield, Santander and Anzoátegui were both promoted to General of Division. At least 1,600 troops and several of the Spanish commanders, including Barreiro himself, were captured at the end of the battle. Since the majority of these captured troops were composed of Venezuelan and New Granadans, these troops were immediately incorporated into the Patriot Army which considerably augmented its size allowing Bolivar to dispatch these new units from the battlefield to other areas of New Granada that had not been liberated yet. 

Through a messenger, who rode nonstop for 30 hours over the 100 km of bad roads that separated the battlefield from the capital, Viceroy Juan de Samano was informed of Barreiro&#x27;s defeat around 10 pm on August 8th. Not wishing to take any chances Samano hastily prepared to abandon the capital and did so at 9:00 am on August 9 bound for Cartagena by way of Honda disguised as a peasant. So hasty was the Viceroy&#x27;s departure that he failed to destroy important government documents and archives and left behind some 900,000 pesos in gold, silver, and currency. Earlier that same day at 7:00 am Colonel Sebastian de La Calzada blew up the gunpowder supply in the arsenal and left with the 400 troops who were stationed in the city bound for Popayan. Royalist sympathizers and other government officials also fled the capital. 

Bolivar arrived on the 10th August with a group of cavalry in advance of his army where he received a jubilant welcome from the inhabitants of the city. On 18 September, a victory ceremony was held for the patriot army in the &quot;Plaza Mayor,&quot; Bolivar was crowned with a laurel wreath given to him by a group of 20 women of the most prestigious families of the city who were all dressed in white. Along with this crown, Bolivar, Santander, and Anzoategui were all awarded the &quot;Cruz de Boyaca&quot; medal which had been created for the occasionThis victory ceremony was accompanied by a large number of dances and balls held in honor of the victors with many of the officers along with Bolivar himself attending these festivities.

On the orders of Santander, Colonel Barreiro and 38 more were executed in Bogotá on October 11, 1819, because of the Decree of War to the Death. The bridge in question, el Puente de Boyacá, is no longer in use but it has been maintained as a symbol of the Independence of South America.

== Consequences ==
The consequences of Bolivar&#x27;s victory at Boyaca bridge lead to large chain of events that would end up changing the history of South America forever. 
* The final defeat of Royal forces in central New Kingdom of Granada and the weakening of the rest of the forces in all America.
* The end of Spanish control over the American provinces, with the escape of viceroy Juan de Samano.
* The creation of Gran Colombia in December of 1819.
* The start of an autonomous government in the former Spanish provinces.
* The subsequent independence of Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador and the creation of Bolivia, after a liberation campaign.

August 7 is a national holiday in Colombia. On this date every 4 years the elected President of Colombia is inaugurated as president by taking the presidential oath of office while also receiving the Presidential sash in the Plaza de Bolivar in Bogota. August 7 is also Army Day (Spanish: &quot;Día del Ejército Nacional&quot;) in Colombia, the Colombian Army holds a large military ceremony at the site of the battle to commemorate its anniversary. This was established officially in 1978 under the administration of President Alfonso López Michelsen.

<text>In baseball, a submarine is a pitch in which the ball is released often just above the ground, but not underhanded, with the torso bent at a right angle, and shoulders tilted so severely that they rotate around a nearly horizontal axis. This is in stark contrast to the underhand softball pitch in which the torso remains upright, the shoulders are level, and the hips do not rotate.

==Description==
The &quot;upside down&quot; release of the submariner causes balls to move differently from pitches generated by other arm slots. Gravity plays a significant role, for the submariner&#x27;s ball must be thrown considerably above the strike zone, after which it drops rapidly back through. The sinking motion of the submariner&#x27;s fastball is enhanced by forward rotation, in contrast with the overhand pitcher&#x27;s hopping backspin.

Submarine pitches are often the toughest for same-side batters to hit (i.e., a right-handed submarine pitcher is the more difficult for a right-handed batter to hit, and likewise for left-handed pitchers and batters). This is because the submariner&#x27;s spin is not perfectly level; the ball rotates forward and toward the pitching arm side, jamming same-sided hitters at the last moment, even as the ball drops rapidly through the zone.

Though the bending motion required to pitch effectively as a submariner means that submariners may be more at risk of developing back problems, it is commonly thought that the submarine motion is less injurious to the elbow and shoulder. Kent Tekulve and Gene Garber, two former submarine pitchers, were among the most durable pitchers in baseball history with 1,944 appearances between the two.

Past major league submariners include Carl Mays, Ted Abernathy, Elden Auker, Chad Bradford, Mark Eichhorn, Gene Garber, Kent Tekulve, Todd Frohwirth, and Dan Quisenberry. Steve Olin was also a submarine pitcher.
Japanese pitcher Shunsuke Watanabe is known as &quot;Mr. Submarine&quot; in Japan. Watanabe has an even lower release point than the typical submarine pitcher, dropping his pivot knee so low that it scrapes the ground. He now wears a pad under his uniform to avoid injuring his knee. His release is so low that his knuckles often become raw from their periodic drag on the ground.

<text>John McLean (February 4, 1791 – October 14, 1830) was a United States representative and a Senator from Illinois. He was the brother of Finis McLean and uncle of James David Walker.

==Biography==
Born near Guilford Court House (now Greensboro), Guilford County, North Carolina, February 4, 1791, McLean moved with his parents to Logan County, Kentucky in 1795. He moved to Illinois Territory in 1815. After studying law, he was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Shawneetown, Gallatin County, Illinois.

==Political career==
When Illinois was admitted as a State into the Union, McLean was elected to the Fifteenth Congress and served from December 3, 1818, to March 3, 1819. He failed to be re-elected in 1818 to the Sixteenth Congress. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for congress in the 1820 and 1822 elections. He was elected to the Illinois State House of Representatives in 1820, 1826, and 1828, and served as speaker. In 1824, McLean was elected to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Ninian Edwards and served from November 23, 1824 to March 3, 1825. He was unsuccessful in a bid for re-election, not managing to get more than 12 votes of the 27 needed in the legislature through 10 ballots, but resumed the practice of law. He was again elected to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1829, until his death, aged 39, in Shawneetown, Illinois in 1830. He was interred in Westwood Cemetery, near Shawneetown.

==Legacy==
McLean County, Illinois is named after him.

<doc id="883711" wikidata="Q6848165" url="?curid=883711" title="Mike Myers (baseball)">
<text>Michael Stanley Myers (born June 26, 1969) is an American former professional left-handed relief pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1995 to 2007.

==High school and college==
Myers attended high school at Crystal Lake Central High School in Illinois and later attended Iowa State University, where he played college baseball for the Iowa State Cyclones baseball team. In the summers of 1988 and 1989, he pitched for the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star in 1989.

==Minor league career==
Myers was in the minor leagues for parts of six seasons. In his final four minor league seasons, he was 14–27 with a 4.29 ERA. He was used primarily as a starting pitcher until , when he pitched 42 games, all in relief, for the Charlotte Knights and Toledo Mud Hens.

==Professional career==
The San Francisco Giants drafted Myers in the fourth round of the 1990 Major League Baseball Draft. Before he ever played for the Giants at the major league level, he was drafted by the Florida Marlins in the Rule 5 draft. He made his major league debut with the Marlins on April 25, 1995, pitching an inning of scoreless relief. In August of that year, the Marlins traded Myers to the Detroit Tigers as the player to be named later from an earlier deal between the two clubs, in which the Marlins acquired Buddy Groom.

He went a combined 1–9 for Detroit between the 1996 and 1997 seasons. He did lead the Majors in appearances, appearing in 83 and 88 games respectively in both seasons. Myers pitched for Detroit through the season. After the season, Myers was traded by the Tigers with Rick Greene and Santiago Perez to the Milwaukee Brewers for Bryce Florie.

Myers pitched for the Brewers for two seasons, pitching in 70 games in 1998 and 71 in 1999. After the 1999 season, the Brewers traded Myers to the Colorado Rockies for Curt Leskanic.

In 2000, Myers had the best season of his career while pitching half his games in Coors Field. He had a 2.05 ERA in 43 games at Coors Field in 2000. He finished the season with a career low 1.99 ERA in 78 games. The following season, Myers pitched in 73 games for the Rockies, going 2–3 with a 3.60 ERA.

Before the 2002 season, the Rockies traded Myers to the Arizona Diamondbacks for JD Closser and Jack Cust. In 2002, he had a 4.38 ERA in 69 games while in 2003 he had a 5.70 ERA in 64 games.

He signed as a free agent with the Seattle Mariners for the 2004 season, but was selected off of waivers by the Boston Red Sox in August 2004. He signed as a free agent with the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004–05 offseason, but was traded back to the Red Sox for two minor league players before the 2005 season began.

During the 2005–06 offseason, Myers signed as a free agent with the New York Yankees. He got off to an amazing start in 2006, with an ERA under 2.00 by mid July. But he then struggled down the stretch. One big highlight late in the season was the big outs he got in Boston during a five-game series against the Red Sox. The Yankees released Myers in August 2007, and he signed with the Chicago White Sox.

On January 25, , Myers signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers to a minor league contract and was invited to spring training. Myers did not make the Dodgers team, but was assigned to play for the Las Vegas 51s in Triple-A. He asked for his release from the 51s on April 25 and became a free agent.

On March 17, 2009, Myers was hired as a special assistant to the head of the Major League Baseball Players Association, Donald Fehr.

==Pitching style==

Myers is a submarine pitcher, throwing the ball with his arm at or below his shoulder rather than above. When Myers was with the Tigers, Baseball Hall of Famer Al Kaline, then a broadcaster with the team, suggested that Myers experiment with the submarine style of pitching. His luck improved in his next two appearances against Baltimore, retiring three batters in a row both times. &quot;Kaline suggested my throwing sidearm to give me a little bit of funk and mystery against left-handed hitters. After what I did against Baltimore, I just kept going from there,&quot; Myers said. He threw two different breaking balls with a deceptive movement that disconcerted opposing hitters, especially left-handed hitters. Myers was also known to be particularly durable. From his first full major league season in , he appeared in at least 60 games every year, topping 80 appearances in his first two seasons to lead the league both years, and over 70 in his next four seasons.

Myers&#x27;s primary role was as a left-handed relief specialist (known in the sport as a &quot;LOOGY, or &quot;Lefty One-Out GuY&quot;), against baseball&#x27;s left-handed hitters, though the statistics say he may have had difficulty performing his job against the top left-handed hitters of his era. With the Rockies and Diamondbacks, he would frequently come into games to face Giants slugger Barry Bonds, and was similarly used by the Red Sox against Hideki Matsui of the Yankees and by the Yankees against David Ortiz of the Red Sox. However, through the end of the season, Bonds was 8-for-25 (.320) with a home run and eight walks against Myers, while Ortiz was 5-for-17 (.294) with a home run and two walks, and Matsui was 3-for-9 (.333) with a home run and a walk.

==Personal life==
Myers became an evangelical Christian in 1993.

<text>The Wallflowers are an American rock solo project of American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Jakob Dylan. The Wallflowers were originally a roots rock band formed in Los Angeles by Dylan and guitarist Tobi Miller. It has undergone several personnel changes, but has remained centered on Dylan.

The band signed with Virgin Records to release their debut studio album (1992), which, despite critical praise, failed to chart and served as their only release with the label. Following the success of their 1996 single &quot;6th Avenue Heartache,&quot; the band signed with Interscope Records to release their second album, &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; (1996), which spawned their signature song, &quot;One Headlight.&quot; Their third album, &quot;(Breach)&quot; (2000), yielded the single &quot;Sleepwalker,&quot; which became their only song to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (previous singles, popularity notwithstanding, did not chart due to &quot;Billboard&quot; rules at the time). The group released two further albums—&quot;Red Letter Days&quot; (2002) and &quot;Rebel, Sweetheart&quot; (2005)—before going on hiatus. Their sixth and seventh albums, &quot;Glad All Over&quot; (2012) and &quot;Exit Wounds&quot; (2021), followed thereafter and were met with continued praise. Lyrically, the band focuses on Dylan&#x27;s introspection, exploring themes of nostalgia, heartache, purpose and insecurities.

The Wallflowers have sold over ten million albums internationally. They have won two Grammy Awards—Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Rock Song for &quot;One Headlight&quot;—from six nominations. The song was also included on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Pop Songs&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; named &quot;One Headlight&quot; as the Greatest of All Time Adult Alternative Song, while &quot;6th Avenue Heartache&quot; ranked at number 37 on the list. 15 of the band&#x27;s songs have peaked within the top ten of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Alternative Airplay chart. The Wallflowers&#x27; personnel has been shared with other bands including Foo Fighters, Ozomatli, and Gogol Bordello; two former members have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==History==
===1988–1990: Early history===
The Wallflowers&#x27; inception came in 1988/1989 when singer-guitarist Jakob Dylan called his childhood friend, Tobi Miller, also a guitarist, about starting a band. Dylan and Miller had been in several bands together in high school but went their separate ways upon graduation. Dylan had moved to New York City to go to art school while Miller had started his own band called the 45&#x27;s. After the 45&#x27;s broke up in 1989, Miller regained contact with Dylan and they began forming a new band called the Apples. Barrie Maguire, who was in the 45&#x27;s with Miller, joined the band as their bass player. In 1990, Peter Yanowitz was added as the drummer. The final member to join the group was keyboardist Rami Jaffee. Jaffee was an active member of the Los Angeles music scene and had been playing with multiple bands in the area. He met Dylan in 1990 in the Kibitz Room, a bar located in the back of Canter&#x27;s; a Jewish deli located on Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles. He had heard the Apples were looking for an organ player and after meeting and talking with Dylan in the Kibitz Room, the two headed for Dylan&#x27;s car to listen to the band&#x27;s demo tape. Jaffee was impressed by the songs and asked to join in on the band&#x27;s next rehearsal. After a long rehearsal session, Jaffee joined the band on the spot.

===1991–1994: Debut album===
The Apples changed their name to The Wallflowers and began playing clubs around Los Angeles, specifically the Sunset Strip, such as the Whisky a Go Go, Gazzarri&#x27;s and the Viper Room. While they were playing clubs the band was also sending their demo tape to record companies and figures within the music industry. One of those tapes caught the attention of Andrew Slater, who would eventually become The Wallflowers&#x27; manager. Slater brought The Wallflowers to Virgin Records, who signed the band to a record contract. The Wallflowers then set out to make their first album. However, finding a producer who was willing to work with them proved to be difficult. The band was intent on recording live and few producers were willing to produce that way. Paul Fox eventually stepped in and agreed to produce the album. By the time The Wallflowers got into the studio in 1991, they had a small catalog of songs they had been performing live which they wanted to record for their debut album. All of the songs were written by Dylan with the rest of the band members contributing input on the music. When in the studio, the band were intent on using as little recording equipment as possible. Dylan explained: &quot;If I could have had it my way I would not have seen a microphone or a cable anywhere.&quot; When it came to recording, the songs were drawn out past the 3 to 4 minute norm; many songs were close to 5 minutes in length with two exceeding 7 minutes. The Wallflowers finished recording and released their self-titled debut album on August 25, 1992. After the release they began touring nationwide as an opening act for bands such as Spin Doctors and 10,000 Maniacs.

The Wallflowers continued to tour through the first half of 1993 but despite this sales of the album were slow. In total, 40,000 copies were sold. Reviews for the album, however, were mostly positive. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 4 stars calling it, &quot;one sweet debut&quot; and describing Dylan&#x27;s songwriting as &quot;impressive.&quot; Great reviews notwithstanding, executives at Virgin Records were reportedly not pleased with the album&#x27;s lack of commercial success. Around this time, the company was going through a shift in management which led to the removal of Jeff Ayeroff and Jordan Harris, the two people who initially brought The Wallflowers to Virgin. After Ayeroff and Harris left the company The Wallflowers began to feel that they had no future with Virgin and asked to be released from their contract. The split with Virgin has been regarded as mutual. By mid-1993 The Wallflowers were without a record label.

After leaving Virgin, The Wallflowers went back to playing Los Angeles clubs in hopes of getting signed with another label. The band found it difficult to even get label representatives to come to their shows. In the year it took to get another record deal The Wallflowers gained and lost several band members. Bass player Barrie Maguire was asked to leave for undisclosed reasons in early 1993. The Wallflowers continued playing shows with replacement bass player Jimmie Snider until May 1993 when the band hired Greg Richling. Dylan and Richling went to high school together. The Wallflowers continued to play club shows in Los Angeles through early 1994 when drummer Peter Yanowitz left the band to join his girlfriend Natalie Merchant&#x27;s band. Yanowitz brought in Barrie Maguire to help record Merchant&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Tigerlily&quot;. Around the time of Yanowitz&#x27;s departure The Wallflowers caught the attention of Jimmy Iovine and Tom Whalley of Interscope Records, who then signed the band to their label in 1994.

===1995–1998: &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot;===
After signing with Interscope Records, The Wallflowers began preparations for their second album, &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot;. They again had trouble finding a producer that was willing to work with them. The Wallflowers began sending demo tapes to producers and one of the tapes landed in the hands of T Bone Burnett. Burnett was impressed by the songs and agreed to produce the band. However, just as they were getting ready to record, the band&#x27;s guitarist Tobi Miller quit. This left The Wallflowers without a permanent drummer or guitarist while they were in the studio. Matt Chamberlain filled in on drums throughout the recording sessions and several guitarists were brought in to fill Miller&#x27;s role including Mike Campbell, Fred Tackett, Jay Joyce and Michael Ward, who would go on to become a permanent member of The Wallflowers.

The Wallflowers released &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; on May 21, 1996. The band began touring for the album soon after the release. Album sales were slow to start but after the first single, &quot;6th Avenue Heartache&quot; (featuring Adam Duritz of Counting Crows) was released on August 19, interest in The Wallflowers began picking up as the song began getting more radio play. The David Fincher-directed music video for &quot;6th Avenue Heartache&quot; was also receiving attention on MTV and VH1. The Wallflowers continued to tour through the rest of 1996 and were featured as a musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; that November. On December 1, &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; received Gold certification from the RIAA by selling 500,000 copies of their album.

In January 1997, The Wallflowers were nominated for two Grammy Awards, both for &quot;6th Avenue Heartache&quot;. Dylan was a presenter at the 1997 Grammy Awards though he and The Wallflowers did not win either of the awards they were nominated for.

The band continued to tour and gain popularity. In February 1997, The Wallflowers completed a tour opening for Sheryl Crow before beginning a string of their own headlining shows beginning at the end of February and running through May. On February 24, the second single from &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot;, &quot;One Headlight&quot;, was released. &quot;One Headlight&quot; received heavy radio play, which propelled &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; to Platinum certification on March 4 by selling one million copies of the album. Within six weeks, sales for &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; doubled and on April 16, the album received Double-Platinum status by selling two million copies. In mid-May, The Wallflowers crossed over to Europe for a three-week-long tour. Upon return in mid-June, The Wallflowers continued to tour the United States. On June 12, Dylan received his first &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine cover. In the accompanying interview, Dylan spoke both candidly and at length about his lineage for the first time. Five days later, album sales for &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; reached the three million mark, qualifying the album for Triple-Platinum status. On June 21, The Wallflowers co-headlined a festival at Texas Motor Speedway called Rock Fest. The day-long festival drew upwards of 400,000 people, making it one of the largest concerts in US history.

On July 2, 1997, The Wallflowers kicked off a co-headlining tour with Counting Crows that continued through September. This tour included opening acts by Bettie Serveert, Engine 88, Gigolo Aunts, and That Dog, with each opening band touring for a three-week stretch. The Wallflowers took over full-headlining duties for several shows in July when Counting Crows were unable to perform due to Duritz&#x27;s swollen vocal cords. On September 22, The Wallflowers released their third single from &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot;, &quot;The Difference&quot;. On October 30, &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; hit another milestone by receiving Quadruple-Platinum status by selling four million copies. After taking the month of October off from touring, The Wallflowers hit the road again in November. On November 9 and 10, The Wallflowers broke from their headlining tour to open for the Rolling Stones at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. Less than a week later, The Wallflowers again broke from their tour to co-headline a private show at an arena in San Jose, California with Bob Dylan on November 14. The Wallflowers continued to tour through the end of December. By the end of 1997, &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; had become the most played album on rock radio and peaked at Number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 while &quot;One Headlight&quot; had received some 209,000 radio spins across all formats.

On January 6, 1998, The Wallflowers received three Grammy nominations; &quot;One Headlight&quot; and &quot;The Difference&quot; were both nominated for Best Rock Song while &quot;One Headlight&quot; received an additional nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. At the 1998 Grammy Award ceremony on February 25, The Wallflowers walked away with two Grammy Awards; &quot;One Headlight&quot; won for Best Rock Song as well as Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Despite the fact that &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; was released nearly two years previously, The Wallflowers released an additional single from that album on March 23, &quot;Three Marlenas&quot;. &quot;Three Marlenas&quot; would be the fourth and final single to be released from &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot;. By 1998 The Wallflowers had begun declining on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and receiving fewer spins on the radio. That changed, however, when the for the 1998 film &quot;Godzilla&quot; was released on May 19. The Wallflowers had recorded a version of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot; which was chosen as the lead single for the soundtrack. The album peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and The Wallflowers&#x27; version of Heroes received heavy radio play. Though The Wallflowers did not tour in 1998 they did play a series of one-off shows including the Tibetan Freedom Concert in June at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. and the Bridge School Benefit in September in Mountain View, California, which was hosted by Neil Young and his wife Pegi.

===1999–2001: &quot;(Breach)&quot;===
After taking a five-month break from writing and touring, The Wallflowers set out to make their third album, &quot;(Breach)&quot;. Dylan was very diligent in the songwriting process; he rented a studio near his home and would routinely go there to write songs for the album. However, Dylan was not satisfied with the first batch of songs he came up with. He decided to scrap them and start over. The songs that did make it to the studio were considered to be far more personal than any of the songs The Wallflowers had released in the past. Dylan explained; &quot;I think all my songs are personal, but I just made them a little more dense before, made &#x27;em real thick so that I didn&#x27;t feel exposed. A lot of younger writers do that. Before, I haven&#x27;t really wanted anybody buying my records looking for information about myself or my family, but at this point, the group has a lot of people buying the records who aren&#x27;t interested in that, so it gives me more freedom.&quot; By the end of 1999, The Wallflowers were ready to begin recording. The bulk of the album was recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles. The Wallflowers&#x27; longtime manager, Andrew Slater co-produced the album with Michael Penn. The band took their time in the studio. Like &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot;, &quot;(Breach)&quot; took about eight months to record. &quot;(Breach)&quot; also featured an array of guest artists including Elvis Costello, Mike Campbell and Frank Black.

Four years after the release of &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; in 1996, &quot;(Breach)&quot; was released on October 10, 2000. The album was met with generally positive critical reception but underwhelming sales. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave &quot;(Breach)&quot; four stars, calling the band &quot;more muscular&quot; than they used to be. However, &quot;(Breach)&quot; commercially floundered in comparison to its high-selling predecessor. The album peaked at No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and took almost a year to receive the Gold certification, which is the highest certification &quot;(Breach)&quot; has received to date.

A month before the official release of &quot;(Breach)&quot;, the album was leaked in its entirety to file-sharing giant Napster, where a reported 25 million users had the ability to listen to and download The Wallflowers&#x27; third album. With regard to the impact of leaks for big recording artists, former Capitol Records senior vice president and general manager, Lou Mann stated: &quot;For The Wallflowers or any major superstar band, the problems are major. In fact they&#x27;re Herculean, because people already want it and you don&#x27;t want to dilute your audience.&quot; Jakob Dylan also explained his feelings about &quot;(Breach)&quot; being leaked: &quot;[Album sales are] one of the ways that we have of making a living really. It&#x27;s not about record companies, it&#x27;s not about people&#x27;s right to trade, you know, it&#x27;s also how we put food on the table.&quot;

Despite the disappointing release, The Wallflowers set out on another tour beginning in early October 2000. After one show in Atlanta on October 2, The Wallflowers traveled to New York to open for the Who for four nights at Madison Square Garden. Later that month, Jakob Dylan was featured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; for a second time. The Wallflowers continued to tour throughout the U.S. through mid-December before heading to Japan in February 2001 for their first tour there.

The Wallflowers covered the Bee Gees&#x27; 1968 hit song &quot;I Started a Joke&quot; for the 2001 film, &quot;Zoolander&quot;.

The band continued to tour the U.S. for the remainder of 2001 until it was announced in early October that guitarist Michael Ward had left The Wallflowers due to creative differences.

===2002–2003: &quot;Red Letter Days&quot;===
In 2001, Jakob Dylan began writing for The Wallflowers&#x27; fourth album, &quot;Red Letter Days&quot;. Later that year while on tour with John Mellencamp, the band began recording using portable equipment. Some recording was also done at keyboardist Rami Jaffee&#x27;s house. Once the band was finished touring for the year they began recording the bulk of the new record at Jackson Browne&#x27;s studio in Santa Monica. By the time The Wallflowers had gotten into Browne&#x27;s studio, Michael Ward had left the band, leaving them without a lead guitarist for the recording process. Dylan took on much of the lead guitar duties with Mike McCready, Rusty Anderson and Val McCallum also contributing on guitar. Moe Z M.D., who had been touring with Mellencamp, contributed additional percussion and background vocals to the album. &quot;Red Letter Days&quot; was produced by founding Wallflowers member Tobi Miller along with Bill Appleberry. Recording continued through the new year and was completed on April 12, 2002. The album was mixed by Tom Lord-Alge, who had mixed the band&#x27;s previous two albums. Mixing was completed on May 15, 2002.

While The Wallflowers were working on &quot;Red Letter Days&quot;, they recorded a cover of The Beatles&#x27; 1965 song &quot;I&#x27;m Looking Through You&quot; for the soundtrack to the 2001 film &quot;I Am Sam&quot;. The soundtrack was released on January 8, 2002.

The first single from the &quot;Red Letter Days&quot;, &quot;When You&#x27;re On Top,&quot; was released to radio on August 16, 2002. A music video directed by Marc Webb followed. After a few false starts, &quot;Red Letter Days&quot; was released on November 5, 2002. The album was met with mixed to positive reviews. Many critics noted the harder rock sound and catchy melodies used throughout the album. Commercial performance was relatively mixed as well, peaking at No.32 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. Around the time of &quot;Red Letter Days&quot;&#x27; release The Wallflowers embarked on a monthlong U.S. tour stretching into early December. After another U.S. tour in January 2003, The Wallflowers toured in several European countries in February including Spain, Italy, Germany and Great Britain. After this tour, The Wallflowers&#x27; drummer since 1995, Mario Calire announced he was parting ways with the band.

In 2003, The Wallflowers were featured on the soundtrack for the film &quot;American Wedding&quot;. The band recorded a cover of Van Morrison&#x27;s 1970 song &quot;Into the Mystic&quot;. The film&#x27;s music department weren&#x27;t able to secure the licensing rights to use Morrison&#x27;s version so they enlisted The Wallflowers to cover the song. Both versions of the song were, however, featured in the film.

===2004–2005: &quot;Rebel, Sweetheart&quot;===
In July 2004, The Wallflowers returned to the studio to record their fifth album, &quot;Rebel, Sweetheart&quot;. This time the band decided to record in Atlanta, Georgia, which is where their producer for this album, Brendan O&#x27;Brien, is based. O&#x27;Brien also contributed on guitar. Fred Eltringham joined The Wallflowers as their new drummer. Jakob Dylan wrote the songs, of which keyboardist Rami Jaffee has said: &quot;What I did notice is that kind of upbeat song with some pretty scary lyrics.&quot; Dylan painted the album&#x27;s cover art himself.

On October 14, 2004, the Warren Zevon tribute album &quot;Enjoy Every Sandwich: The Songs of Warren Zevon&quot; was released, on which The Wallflowers covered Zevon&#x27;s 1978 song &quot;Lawyers, Guns and Money.&quot; In promotion of the album, The Wallflowers performed &quot;Lawyers, Guns and Money&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; with Zevon&#x27;s son, Jordan, on October 12, 2004.

On October 31, 2004, The Wallflowers were flown via military transport plane to the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the middle of the Pacific Ocean to perform for the returning troops.

&quot;Rebel, Sweetheart&quot; was released on May 24, 2005, and was met with positive reviews. Despite widespread critical acclaim, &quot;Rebel, Sweetheart&quot; performed relatively poorly commercially, peaking at No. 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. However, the first single from the album, &quot;The Beautiful Side of Somewhere&quot;, hit No. 5 on AAA radio. The second single was &quot;God Says Nothing Back&quot;. This was the first Wallflowers album to be released on DualDisc. On one side was the album, and on the other was a DVD that included exclusive performances and arrangements of some of the band&#x27;s songs, as well as an interview with comedian Jon Lovitz. In promotion of the album, The Wallflowers did concerts for the Oxygen Custom Concert Series and PBS &quot;Soundstage&quot;. Around the time of the album&#x27;s release, the band set out on what would be their last tour for two years. They were joined by Stuart Mathis on lead guitar. After 2005, The Wallflowers ended their relationship with Interscope Records.

===2006–2010: Hiatus===

2006 was the first year in over a decade that The Wallflowers did not tour. Instead, band members embarked on other projects. Jakob Dylan toured with former Wallflowers producer T-Bone Burnett in the early summer, performing a solo acoustic opening set with a keyboard player. Later that year, he signed a contract with Columbia Records as a solo artist. He also wrote and recorded a song called &quot;Here Comes Now&quot;, which was featured as the theme song for the ABC television drama &quot;Six Degrees&quot;. The show premiered in the fall of 2006. Meanwhile, keyboardist Rami Jaffee joined the Foo Fighters as a touring and session member. Jaffee had previously contributed keyboards to the Foo Fighters&#x27; 2005 album &quot;In Your Honor&quot;. In 2006, he also contributed on albums for Willie Nile and Pete Yorn.

On August 31, 2007, The Wallflowers announced they would be touring for the first time in over two years. They toured in the Midwest and Northeastern U.S. in October and November. Before the tour, Jaffee announced that he was leaving The Wallflowers. This left Dylan, Greg Richling and Fred Eltringham as the remaining members and a guitar player, Stuart Mathis, as a touring member. In 2008, The Wallflowers toured on-and-off throughout the summer. Touring for The Wallflowers was limited as Dylan had released his first solo album, &quot;Seeing Things&quot;, on June 10, 2008. Eltringham joined Dylan on tour in promotion for the album.

On March 31, 2009, The Wallflowers released a greatest-hits album called &quot;Collected: 1996–2005&quot;. The album featured every single released from the four albums The Wallflowers released between 1996 and 2005. It also featured several non-single songs from those four albums, a demo version of &quot;God Says Nothing Back&quot; and an unreleased song called &quot;Eat You Sleeping&quot;. That summer, The Wallflowers embarked on a U.S. tour in support of the album. In addition to Dylan, Richling, Eltringham and Mathis, Bill Appleberry joined the band on this tour as a keyboard player. The Wallflowers did not tour in 2010 as Dylan had released his second solo album, &quot;Women + Country&quot;, on April 6, 2010, and was touring in support of that album.

===2011–2012: &quot;Glad All Over&quot;===

On November 1, 2011, Jakob Dylan announced that The Wallflowers would be reuniting to release an album, explaining: &quot;I never suggested we were breaking up. We all felt we were losing the plot a bit and we needed a break. And that year break becomes two years, then becomes three years, and before you know it five or six years go by pretty quickly. I can&#x27;t do what I do in The Wallflowers without them. I miss it.&quot; In an interview with the &quot;St. Joseph News-Press&quot;, Dylan stated that The Wallflowers would be getting into the studio in January and the lineup would include Greg Richling on bass, Rami Jaffee on keys, Stuart Mathis on guitar and Fred Eltringham on drums. However, weeks before The Wallflowers began recording, Eltringham left the band to pursue other projects. The band quickly got former Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons to join the band. Irons was previously involved in a side project with Wallflowers bassist Richling.

On January 20, 2012, The Wallflowers began recording their sixth studio album, &quot;Glad All Over,&quot; at the Black Keys&#x27; Dan Auerbach&#x27;s Easy Eye studio in Nashville. Jay Joyce, who had played guitar on The Wallflowers&#x27; &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; agreed to produce the album. Before going to the studio, the band had decided have a more collaborative writing process than they had in the past. Instead of Dylan bringing in fully completed songs like he had done in the past, he only brought lyrics. Dylan and the rest of the band wrote the music for the songs together in the studio. Joyce explained: &quot;Jakob came to Nashville and we sat down and I asked him to play me a song, but instead he pulled out this 2-inch-thick notebook. ‘This is what I’ve got. Let’s play some grooves and throw it around.’ I thought, ‘Wow, that’s kind of scary, but it’s exciting.’ So we didn&#x27;t really know going in what we were going to do. We had no songs, no demos. It was all developed in the studio. The band finished recording on February 20, 2012.

At a private solo performance in New York on April 19, 2012, Dylan announced that the new The Wallflowers album was expected to be released in fall later that year. On July 14, 2012, the band announced that the title of their new album would be &quot;Glad All Over&quot;. They also announced that the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Reboot the Mission&quot;, would be available for free download from their website.

Following several one-off shows in the summer of 2012, The Wallflowers kicked off a fall tour in San Diego on September 8, 2012. From there, they continued to tour the U.S. and Canada through mid-November, playing a mix of clubs and festivals, with an additional four East Coast dates at the end of December. &quot;Glad All Over&quot; was released on October 9, 2012, on Columbia Records and was met with generally positive reviews. Leading up to the album&#x27;s release, The Wallflowers promoted the album on various television shows including &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Ellen&quot;.

===2013–2020: Tours and roster changes===

Beginning in the spring of 2013, the band toured with Eric Clapton on his arena tour. The tour with Clapton began on March 14, 2013, in Phoenix, Arizona, at the US Airways Center and continued through the South and East Coast, eventually coming to an end on April 6, 2013, in Pittsburgh at the Consol Energy Center.

After the Clapton tour, The Wallflowers played several additional shows of their own in May 2013. On May 12 in Napa, California, the band&#x27;s longtime keyboardist Rami Jaffee played what would be his final show with The Wallflowers to date. Although no official announcement was made, Jaffee has not appeared with the group again, and became an official member of the Foo Fighters in June 2017. Jimmy Wallace subbed in his spot for the remaining dates of 2013, and played regularly with the band up until 2019. The Wallflowers continued to tour through the summer of 2013 and played their final show of the summer on August 17 at the River Roots Live Festival in Davenport, Iowa, to a crowd of 17,000 people. This show would turn out to be longtime bassist Greg Richling&#x27;s and drummer Jack Irons&#x27; final show with the band. On September 8, Richling officially announced that he was leaving The Wallflowers after 20 years with the band. Jack Irons announced he was leaving soon after, on September 15. Irons reportedly left to focus on his band project, Arthur Channel, a group he had put together with Greg Richling in 2009, prior to Irons joining The Wallflowers in 2012. Arthur Channel released their debut album on October 15, 2013.

The Wallflowers have continued to play shows since 2013 with a new drummer, bass player, guitar player, and keyboardist filling in for Irons, Richling, Mathis, and Jaffee. Dylan stated later he would be continuing making music under name The Wallflowers as a solo project: &quot;The Wallflowers is me, and if I go under my own name, it&#x27;s me. It&#x27;s the same thing, ultimately. It&#x27;s really dictated on the songs I have and how I want to record them and would they sound better with a full-band sound. In many ways it&#x27;s the same person. It&#x27;s just what outfit do I want to put on&quot;. As of 2017, the touring lineup consisted of Stanton Adcock on lead guitar, Steve Mackey on bass, keyboardist Jimmy Wallace and Lynn Williams on drums.

In May 2016, The Wallflowers&#x27; 1996 album &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; was issued on vinyl for the first time in honor of the 20th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release. The Wallflowers was among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire, although later research showed the master tapes for &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; were not actually destroyed in the fire.

The band was set to undertake a North American summer tour in 2020 alongside Matchbox Twenty prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===2021–present: &quot;Exit Wounds&quot;===

The band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Exit Wounds&quot;, was released on July 9, 2021, on New West Records. With the release of the new album, Dylan would reiterate that the band&#x27;s sound is an extension of his solo work, saying &quot;There&#x27;s never been one lineup that&#x27;s made two records. So the constant is myself. If you think there&#x27;s a sound of The Wallflowers, I&#x27;m making that with my choices in the studio and with my songs and voice&quot;. It was produced by Butch Walker and the band announced a 53-date arena tour to promote the album (which was postponed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). About writing the album, Dylan says, &quot;I was just also writing during a time when the world felt like it was falling apart. That changes the way you address even the simplest things, because you have panic in your mind all the time. You have anxiety. And you also have hope. And it’s all in there&quot;. The album was well received, and scored the band their highest position on a Billboard albums chart, with the album debuting at #3 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Album Sales Chart. The band promoted the new album with a number of television appearances; debuting their new single on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on April 8, 2021, in addition to performances on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, and other network television shows.

The band&#x27;s planned 2022 tour with Matchbox Twenty, which had already been postponed from 2020, was postponed again to 2023 and The Wallflowers had to drop off the tour due to scheduling conflicts. The band went ahead to schedule their own headlining tour in North America, announcing initial dates in April 2022, and continued to tour into 2023, with numerous sold out shows.

On October 14, 2023, Jakob Dylan and former Wallflowers guitarist Michael Ward reunited for the first time in over 20 years in Las Vegas, with Dylan being a surprise guest at Ward&#x27;s show, joining him for &quot;One Headlight&quot;. On April 1, 2024, former Wallflowers guitarist Michael Ward passed away due to complications of diabetes. The band paid tribute to him in a Facebook post from their official page, on April 3.

On May 7, 2024 the band announced they would perform &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; live in its entirety for the first time, at a special show at the Palace Theatre on October 2 in Los Angeles, California.

<text>The People&#x27;s Alliance () was an electoral alliance in Iceland from 1956 to 1968 and a socialist political party from 1968 to 1998.

== History ==
In 1916, the Social Democratic Party (&quot;Alþýðuflokkurinn&quot;) was formed in Iceland. In 1930 the party split, leading to the formation of the Communist Party of Iceland (&quot;Kommúnistaflokkur Íslands&quot;), recognised as the Icelandic section of the Communist International. In 1937 the social democrats suffered another split, and the splinter group unified itself with the communists forming the Socialist Party (&quot;Sósíalistaflokkurinn&quot;). However, the new party did not become a ComIntern member as its forerunner. The first chairman of the People&#x27;s Alliance was Ragnar Arnalds.

On 4 April 1956, the Socialist Party created an electoral alliance with yet another left-wing split of the Social Democratic Party led by Hannibal Valdimarsson, thus forming the People&#x27;s Alliance with Hannibal as its chairman.

In 1963, National Preservation Party (&quot;Þjóðvarnarflokkurinn&quot;) contributed people to the joint electoral alliance, resulting in Gils Guðmundsson, a former member of parliament (1953–1956) for &quot;Þjóðvarnarflokkurinn&quot; gaining a seat in the parliament, which he held until 1979. In 1968 the People&#x27;s Alliance officially became a political party. At that time Hannibal left and formed his own Union of Liberals and Leftists. The later president of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, was chairman of the party from 1987 to 1995 after joining it coming from Union of Liberals and Leftists after he broke away from the Progressive Party.

In the mid-1960s, the U.S. States Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 1,000 (1% of the working age population of Iceland).

In 1998, it joined forces with the Social Democrat Party, the Women&#x27;s Alliance (&quot;Samtök um kvennalista&quot;) and the National Awakening (&quot;Þjóðvaki&quot;) in forming the Social Democratic Alliance (&quot;Samfylkingin&quot;), a broad centre-left party. However the People&#x27;s Alliance continues to exist on papers until its debts are paid. Some members of the People&#x27;s Alliance did not support the forming of the Alliance, including some MPs of the party, and formed the Left-Green Movement (&quot;Vinstrihreyfingin – grænt framboð&quot;), a socialist-green party, in 1999. 

The party was not a communist party, but it used to be the Icelandic referent of the World Communist Movement. It was opposed to NATO and the presence of U.S. military forces in Iceland. It was also opposed to Icelandic membership of the European Union and the EEA agreement in 1993 between the EFTA and the EU, Iceland being a member of EFTA.

It participated in five coalition governments from 1956 to 1991, beginning in Hermann Jónasson&#x27;s last government 1956–1958, then in both of Ólafur Jóhannesson&#x27;s governments 1in 1971–1974 and in 1978–1979, then in Gunnar Thoroddsen&#x27;s only government 1980–1983 and finally in Steingrímur Hermannsson&#x27;s latter government in 1988–1991.

The youth league of the People&#x27;s Alliance was known as ÆFAB.

<text>Crocker National Bank was an American bank headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was acquired by and merged into Wells Fargo Bank in 1986.

==History==
The bank traces its history to the Woolworth National Bank in San Francisco. Charles Crocker, who was one of The Big Four of the Central Pacific Railroad and who constructed America&#x27;s first transcontinental railroad, acquired a controlling interest in Woolworth for his son William Henry Crocker. The bank was renamed Crocker Woolworth National Bank, later Crocker National Bank.

In 1925, Crocker National merged with the First National Bank of San Francisco, founded by James D. Phelan, to form Crocker First National Bank.

In 1956, Crocker First National Bank merged with the Anglo California National Bank (established by Herbert Fleishhacker) to form Crocker-Anglo Bank. In 1963, Crocker-Anglo Bank merged with Los Angeles&#x27; Citizens National Bank, to become Crocker-Citizens Bank. and later, Crocker Bank.


In the 1970s and early 1980s, Crocker cultivated a reputation for customer service and convenience, including expanded hours. As a part of its promotional campaign, the bank gave various stuffed animals to new customers, including &quot;Sunny&quot;, a teddy bear, &quot;Crocker&quot; Spaniel stuffed dogs, and a set of stuffed circus animal “Crockers”. It was also one of the first California banks to offer automated teller machine service. One early television commercial showed a young businessman confidently using the machine, while speaking to it as if it were a person. He was followed by an elderly woman approaching it for the first time, and greeting it with a very uncertain &quot;Hello.&quot;

Crocker National Bank was purchased by the British financial institution Midland Bank in 1981, but after a series of financial losses, it was sold to Wells Fargo Bank in 1986. Crocker&#x27;s executive vice president and two-thirds of the top 70 executives lost their jobs because of the merger.

==Other history==
On April 21, 1975, a Carmichael, California branch of the bank in the Sacramento area was robbed by several members of the Symbionese Liberation Army. SLA member Emily Harris accidentally fired her shotgun (as she later said in a plea deal) and killed Myrna Opsahl, a 42-year-old customer and mother of four.

==In popular culture==
Scott Adams worked at Crocker during his first years in the business world. He drew on that and other business experience when creating the &quot;Dilbert&quot; comic strip.

The song &quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot; was originally commissioned by advertising agent Hal Riney for an advertisement for Crocker that ran in early 1970.

<text>The Öland Bridge (Swedish: &quot;Ölandsbron&quot;) is a road bridge in Sweden that spans the Kalmar Strait, between Jutnabben in Kalmar on the mainland and Möllstorp in Algutsrum parish near Färjestaden on Öland in the Baltic Sea.

It is a 6,072-metre (3¾ mile) long beam bridge with a clear bridge width of 13 metres (43&#x27;). Maximum height 41.69 metres (136&#x27;9&quot;), minimum height 6.65 metres (21&#x27;10&quot;). The bridge is built of reinforced concrete in 155 spans, including the high bridge section in 6 spans of 130 metres (430&#x27;), and has a characteristic hump at its western end which was created to provide a vertical clearance of 36 metres (120&#x27;) for shipping. The Öland Bridge is one of the longest in all of Europe (the longest one until completion of Vasco da Gama Bridge in 1998) and currently Sweden&#x27;s longest bridge, if one only compares the bridge sections that are on Swedish territory (the Öresund Bridge, which is longer, is partly built on Danish territory).

A little to the south of the western end of the bridge a small wooden pedestrian and bicycle bridge, around 150 metres (160 yards) in length and connecting the island of Svinö to the mainland, echoes the form of the Öland bridge. This &quot;replica&quot; is clearly visible to anyone crossing to Öland via the main bridge. The road crossing the bridge is County Road 137, which connects to the E22 on the mainland, and County Road 136 on Öland.

==Construction==
The plan for a fixed link between Öland and the Swedish mainland had existed for a long time and led to a number of motions in the Swedish parliament and inquiries. The first concrete proposal was presented in 1932, and in the 1950s the question of the Öland Bridge was raised. Parliamentary politician Fritz Börjesson was a strong driving force for a fixed link between Kalmar and Öland. Another advocate was Uno Danielson, a forester on Öland.

On 18 November 1966, the Swedish government adopted a plan for the construction of major bridges, which included the Öland Bridge. The first sod was turned on the Småland side by then Minister of Communications Svante Lundkvist (S) on 30 December 1967. On the Öland side, the first sod was turned on 4 January 1968 by MP Fritz Börjesson (C).

The Öland Bridge was inaugurated on 30 September 1972. Among the speakers at the ceremony, which took place on the island side of the bridge, was the Crown Prince Carl Gustaf. The bridge cost 80 million Swedish kronor to build. Construction took 4.5 years, and about 100,000 cubic meters (cu. yd.) of concrete was used. The bridge was also prepared for transporting fresh water from the mainland to Öland. The bridge project received much support, but there were also protests. The main objection was that the bridge would threaten the environment, possibly causing a huge influx of tourists to Öland and its vulnerable and precious nature.Already in connection with the decision to build the Ölandsbron, emigration from Öland was reversed. A large number of homes began to be built in Färjestaden and the surrounding area. The Öland Bridge cost SEK 130 million to build.

<doc id="883733" wikidata="Q1933496" url="?curid=883733" title="Ned's Atomic Dustbin">
<text>Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin is an English rock band formed in Stourbridge, West Midlands, in November 1987. The band took their name from an episode of radio comedy programme &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. The band is unusual for using two bass-players in their line-up.

==History==
Frontman and co-founder Jonn Penney has listed Joni Mitchell, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, The Cure and The Teardrop Explodes among his favourite artists. His favourite albums include &quot;Closing Time&quot; by Tom Waits and &quot;Architecture &amp; Morality&quot; by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD). Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin quickly gathered a strong fanbase after being offered a support slot by local heroes The Wonder Stuff on their 1989 and 1990 UK tours. During 1990, Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin signed with Birmingham-based indie label Chapter 22 Records for their debut release, &quot;The Ingredients EP&quot;, followed by a single, &quot;Kill Your Television&quot;, which reached No. 92 and No. 53 respectively in the UK singles chart. &quot;Kill Your Television&quot; also topped the UK independent singles chart. This, combined with their acclaimed live reputation, drew a huge crowd to their afternoon appearance on the main stage of the Reading Festival in August 1990. The buzz created was significant enough to catalyse the interest of major record labels. One final single for Chapter 22 followed, &quot;Until You Find Out&quot; which eventually stalled at No. 51. The band decided to sign to Sony Records, on the proviso that they be allowed to release their music through their own Furtive label – thus regaining a higher degree of creative control while still enjoying the benefit of the major label&#x27;s distribution and advertising clout.

In March 1991, Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin found themselves in the UK top 20 with their next single, &quot;Happy&quot;, their Sony/Furtive debut. It reached No. 16 and earned the band the first of two &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearances. They released their debut album &quot;God Fodder&quot; shortly afterwards, in April 1991, which made No. 4 in the UK top 40 albums chart. In July 1991, British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; noted that the band were, along with The KLF, Seal, The La&#x27;s and Electronic, making their mark in the United States. The band released a new UK single, &quot;Trust&quot;, towards the end of 1991, while America got the &quot;God Fodder&quot; versions of &quot;Kill Your Television&quot; and &quot;Grey Cell Green&quot;, the video for the latter track proving to be a big hit on MTV&#x27;s taste-making alternative show &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. During 1991, the group toured around the world with, amongst others, Mega City Four, Senseless Things and Jesus Jones. They recorded their second album &quot;Are You Normal?&quot; in 1992, which was promoted by the singles &quot;Not Sleeping Around&quot;, &quot;Intact&quot; and, in some European territories, &quot;Walking Through Syrup&quot;.

Having headlined the &quot;NME&quot; stage at the Glastonbury Festival in 1992, the band spent the next couple of years on a worldwide tour, releasing a compilation of older non-album material and two new tracks called &quot;0.522&quot; in 1994 before decamping to Wales to record their final album, &quot;Brainbloodvolume&quot;. While still retaining the band&#x27;s trademark melodic sensibilities, this album boasted a heavier, more diverse sound than their previous releases, moving away from the distinctive twin bass set-up to incorporate samplers and keyboards. Sony released the album in America before the UK, meaning that most die-hard fans bought it on import. This damaged its UK chart position when it was eventually released domestically, increasing tensions between the band and their label.

Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin had one last UK top 40 single with &quot;All I Ask of Myself Is That I Hold Together&quot; in 1995, following a final appearance on &quot;The Word&quot;, while the uncharacteristically slow number, &quot;Stuck&quot;, became the band&#x27;s final single, making the BBC Radio One B-list. In 1995, after an extensive US tour to support &quot;Brainbloodvolume&quot;, Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin split up in New York City following what would be their final show.

Singer Penney formed a new band, Groundswell (initially featuring Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin guitarist, Rat), who recorded one single, &quot;Corrode&quot;, and a studio album &quot;Plausible/Infeasible&quot; for New Jersey–based indie label, Gig Records. They disbanded shortly thereafter – in fact, the album was only actually released after their demise.

Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin took the stage in 2000 for the first time since their initial breakup for a show in Dudley with Groundswell members Andy King and Martin Warlow taking the place of Mat Cheslin and Rat. Originally billed as &quot;the last 30 minutes of Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin,&quot; it was intended as an opportunity to say a proper goodbye to British fans who never got to see a final Ned&#x27;s show. However, the resounding success convinced members of the band to continue working together, and they continue to perform sporadically ever since. 2004 saw the band perform two new songs, &quot;Hibernation&quot; and &quot;Ambush&quot;. In 2005 they again played a few late-December gigs, and on 5 June 2006 their first new single in 11 years, &quot;Hibernation&quot;, was released, supported with a weekend concert series called &quot;Ned-Fest&quot;. The single was available as both a download and a CD, available to buy online via their website.

The video game &quot;NCAA Football 2006&quot; for PlayStation 2 and Xbox features the song &quot;Kill Your Television&quot;. Their song &quot;Grey Cell Green&quot; is featured in the video game &quot;Saints Row&quot; for the Xbox 360 platform, on &quot;The Rock&quot; radio station. The Neds&#x27; cover version of the Bay City Rollers song &quot;Saturday Night&quot; features in the movie &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot;.

On 7 May 2007, a compilation album was released with the name of &quot;Some Furtive Years – A Ned&#x27;s Anthology&quot;: &quot;Furtive&quot; is a reference to their earlier record label. Unlike the others, this compilation features liner notes by Penney and Cheslin, offering insight into the background of songs featured on the album.

==Reunited==

On 12 May 2008, the band announced that the original line-up would be performing live together for the first time since 1995, for a gig in London at The Astoria. When asked about performing together for the first time in over a decade, Penney stated, &quot;It just felt right! There was the understandable awkwardness when we stood in a room together for the first time in 13 years, but that just melted away as soon as we started to play the songs.&quot; &quot;We didn&#x27;t really know what was going to happen once we got playing on stage, because it had been such a long time since we&#x27;d all been in it together. It&#x27;s different from rehearsal. It was such an incredible kind of electric feeling atmosphere for everybody. You felt at one with the crowd again, similar to very early on, when everybody was excited about what was happening.&quot; Matt Cheslin says, &quot;It was great, it&#x27;s been quite nostalgic. I haven&#x27;t played for the whole time that I haven&#x27;t been in the band, but some of the really old songs I remember more. You do really notice the difference in the really early songs. It was as exciting as it was when I was 17.&quot;

Of the reunion shows, Penney said: &quot;The reunion shows have gone down well and the fans gave us a massive welcome back so we wanted to do something different for them and play the album that made it happen for us. It was a time that was exciting for us and the fans, it is not an anniversary as such, we just wanted to celebrate that album and era.&quot;

Penney spoke of the loyalty of Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin fans in a 2009 interview. &quot;We see masses of familiar faces every time we play – we were always pretty familiar with our audiences anyway and we&#x27;re very lucky that so many of them are so loyal to us. People still fly in to shows from all over the world – Japan, Australia, Canada, U.S. and all over Europe. It&#x27;s incredibly humbling to see these people keep coming back.&quot;

When asked whether Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin are planning on recording any new material together, Penney replied, &quot;I think we will, but don&#x27;t hold your breath – songwriting is a slow process for Ned&#x27;s.&quot;

The band has continued to play event-style gigs with other 1990s indie bands, such as the Nedstock shows in Leeds, Birmingham and London with Republica and Cud in November 2013. On 24 May 2014, Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin headlined the Gigantic Classic Indie All-Dayer in Manchester, with The Wedding Present, Cud, The Frank and Walters and The Sultans of Ping. In 2014 Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin also joined a host of &#x27;90s indie stars to play the first Mute Elephant Promotions &#x27;Indie Daze&#x27; festival on 13 September, at The Forum in Kentish Town.

==Ned&#x27;s Acoustic Dustbin==
Encouraged by Miles Hunt to perform some songs acoustically, Ned&#x27;s Acoustic Dustbin was born in 2017. Featuring Jonn and Rat, the duo released the album &quot;Ned&#x27;s Acoustic Dustbin&quot; in 2019 which featured versions of such tracks as &quot;Intact&quot; and &quot;All I Ask of Myself Is That I Hold Together&quot; without drums or bass. The duo toured in support of the release.

Timeline
==Discography==

Furtive was the band&#x27;s own label distributed under Sony, which allowed the band to retain a level of independence and control (although which subsidiary of Sony distributed each release depended on which one and where it was bought. In the UK it was Sony Soho Square, Japan Epic, and in the US they were shifted about – first Columbia, then Chaos, then Work.)

<text>Screenshop was a British strand of infomercial-based shopping programming and television channel, owned by Sit-up Ltd. Screenshop sold a wide variety of products from TV Warehouse.

==Channels==
===Screenshop 1===
In 2004, Screenshop 1 began to be run for Sit-Up by Vector Direct. Vector broadcast their presentations exclusively on the channel, and eventually this led to the channel being stripped of its own identity. In 2005, it began to broadcast under Vector Direct&#x27;s own &#x27;TV Warehouse&#x27; brand (as TV Warehouse 1). This may be due to Vector Direct&#x27;s appearance on the BBC&#x27;s Watchdog programme, which was due to the company charging unknowing customers £99.00 for entrance into a &quot;Travel and Leisure&quot; club, in which entry was automatic with every purchase. It is expected that Vector Direct do not use their own brand because of this bad publicity, however this has not been confirmed. Vector Direct went into voluntary liquidation just before Christmas in 2007, TV Warehouse was purchased by JML but closed in 2009.

===Screenshop 2===
On 3 March 2008, a Screenshop branded channel &quot;Screenshop 2&quot; launched exclusively on Sky channel 680, using the downtime of Speed Auction. The channel showed items from Vector Direct between 1.30am to 7.30am every night. Screenshop 2 closed on 29 April 2012.

==Screenshop strand==
Screenshop broadcast a strand during the night (until 7am) on UK Gold and also during the day on the Discovery channel feed on Sky in the late 90s. It also initially broadcast 24 hours a day on empty channel space on an Astra satellite, though this was short lived. In the 2000s, Screenshop broadcast daily from 1.30am to 7.45am, on sister channels Bid and Price Drop. Each of these channels carried a different feed of Screenshop, broadcasting different products at different times. The arrangement ended when Sit-Up went into administration in the early 2010s.

<text>Frank Arnold Cremeans (April 5, 1943 – January 2, 2003) was an American small-businessman who represented Ohio in the United States House of Representatives as a Republican. He served one term in Congress, from 1995 to 1997.

== Biography ==
Cremeans was born in Cheshire, Ohio. After graduating from Kyger Creek High School, Cheshire, Ohio he earned his B.A. at the University of Rio Grande, Rio Grande, Ohio, in 1965 and his M.A. at Ohio University in 1969.

=== Congress ===
Cremeans, the self-made millionaire owner of a concrete company in Gallipolis, was elected in the Republican landslide in 1994, narrowly defeating one-term incumbent Ted Strickland in Ohio&#x27;s sixth congressional district.

Strickland challenged Cremeans in 1996 to regain the seat. Strickland won by a slim majority thanks to strong Democratic turnout in southeastern Ohio, particularly in Athens County.

=== Later career ===
Cremeans subsequently returned to Gallipolis and his concrete business.

In 1998, Cremeans sought to retake his seat from Strickland, but he was defeated in a three-way Republican primary by Lieutenant Governor Nancy Hollister. In March 2000, he challenged GOP incumbent Senator Mike DeWine in a three way primary, finishing in third place with 8% of the vote. (DeWine drew 80%, and gun show promoter Ronald Dickson drew 12%.)

=== Death ===
He died in Gallipolis in 2003 due to a respiratory disease.

<text>Gelindo Bordin (born 2 April 1959) is an Italian former Long Distance Runner, winner of the marathon race at the 1988 Summer Olympics. He is the first Italian to have won an Olympic gold in the marathon and the only male to win both the Boston Marathon and the Olympic gold medal in this event.

==Biography==
Born in Vicenza, Italy, Bordin made his first breakthrough at the 1986 European Championships, where he won a gold medal in the marathon. His next international competition was the 1987 World Championships in Rome. The marathon race was held on a very hot and humid day. Bordin wisely held back from the leaders in the early stages. He caught up with the leaders after the 35 km mark and finally managed to hold on to the third place, winning a bronze medal.

At the Olympic marathon in Seoul, Bordin stayed with the leaders from the start. After the leading pack started to distance itself from the rest of the runners. With remaining, only three runners remained: Bordin, Wakiihuri, the Kenyan and the Djiboutan, Salah. With to go, Salah surged forward taking Wakihuri with him and establishing a comfortable gap between the two and Bordin. At this late stage of the race the move seemed a decisive one, leading most viewers and sport commentators to reasonably conclude that the gold and silver medals were to be decided between Wakihuri and Salah, with Bordin hopefully holding on to his bronze medal position. But Bordin&#x27;s sheer courage and determination gradually saw him lessen the gap and finally catch up with the leaders once again, much to the delight of the Italian commentators and fans who were now ecstatic. He first passed Wakihuri and then the tiring Salah with to go, gradually increasing his lead and achieving the ultimate prize of Olympic gold.

Bordin successfully defended his European marathon title in 1990, becoming the first man to win the title twice, but at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo, he finished in a disappointing eighth place. Bordin attempted to defend his Olympic title at 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, but he strained a groin muscle jumping over a fallen runner just after the halfway mark, and failed to finish. Shortly after the 1992 Summer Olympics Bordin decided to retire.

Bordin is the only male to win both the Boston Marathon and an Olympic gold medal in the marathon. He won the Boston Marathon in 1990 and describes the victory as his &quot;second greatest run, after winning the Olympics&quot;.

<doc id="883741" wikidata="Q596505" url="?curid=883741" title="Ophidiophobia">
<text>Ophidiophobia (), or ophiophobia (), is fear of snakes. It is sometimes called by the more general term herpetophobia, fear of reptiles. The word comes from the Greek words &quot;ophis&quot; (), snake, and &quot;phobia&quot; () meaning fear.

==Research==
About one-third of adult humans have a fear of snakes, making it one of the most commonly reported phobias. However, adults manifesting &quot;clinically relevant&quot; ophidiophobia accounts for only about 3–4% of the population. 

In &quot;The Handbook of the Emotions&quot; (1993), psychologist Arne Öhman studied pairing an unconditioned stimulus with evolutionarily-relevant fear-response neutral stimuli (snakes and spiders) versus evolutionarily-irrelevant fear-response neutral stimuli (mushrooms, flowers, physical representation of polyhedra, firearms, and electrical outlets) on human subjects and found that ophidiophobia and arachnophobia required only one pairing to develop a conditioned response while mycophobia, anthophobia, phobias of physical representations of polyhedra, firearms, and electrical outlets required multiple pairings and went extinct without continued conditioning while the conditioned ophidiophobia and arachnophobia were permanent. Similarly, psychologists Susan Mineka, Richard Keir, and Veda Price found that laboratory-raised rhesus macaques did not display fear if required to reach across a toy snake to receive a banana unless the macaque was shown a video of another macaque withdrawing in fright from the toy (which produced a permanent fear-response), while being shown a similar video of another macaque displaying fear of a flower produced no similar response. 

Psychologist Paul Ekman cites this anecdote by Charles Darwin in &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot; (1872) in connection with Öhman&#x27;s research:

Psychiatrist Randolph M. Nesse notes that while conditioned fear responses to evolutionarily novel dangers such as electrical outlets is possible, the conditioning is slower because such cues have no prewired connection to fear, and that despite the emphasis on the risks of speeding and drunk driving in driver&#x27;s education, it does not provide reliable protection against traffic collisions and that nearly one-quarter of all deaths in 2014 of people aged 15 to 24 in the United States were in traffic collisions. Also, Nesse, psychiatrist Isaac Marks, and evolutionary biologist George C. Williams wrote that people with systematically deficient responses to adaptive phobias (e.g. ophidiophobia, arachnophobia, basophobia) are more temperamentally careless and more likely to receive unintentional injuries that are potentially fatal and have proposed that such deficient phobia should be classified as &quot;hypophobia&quot; due to its selfish genetic consequences.

A 2001 study at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden suggested that mammals may have an innate negative reaction to snakes (and spiders), which was vital for their survival as it allowed such threats to be identified immediately. 
A 2009 report of a 40-year research program demonstrated strong fear conditioning to snakes in humans and fast nonconscious processing of snake images; these are mediated by a fear network in the human brain involving the amygdala.
A 2013 study provided neurobiological evidence in primates (macaques) of natural selection for detecting snakes rapidly.

==In fiction==
In non-medical press and literature, the movie-character Indiana Jones has been used as an example of someone with ophidiophobia.

<text>Oppenheim ( ) is a town in the Mainz-Bingen district of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. The town is a well-known wine center, being the home of the German Winegrowing Museum, and is particularly known for the wines from the Oppenheimer Krötenbrunnen vineyards.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town lies on the Upper Rhine in Rhenish Hesse between Mainz and Worms. It is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde (special administrative district).

== History ==
In 765, the first documented mention of the Frankish village was recorded in the Lorsch Codex, in connection with an endowment by Charlemagne to the Lorsch Abbey. Further portions of Oppenheim were added to the endowment in 774. In 1008, Oppenheim was granted market rights. In October 1076 Oppenheim gained special importance in the Investiture Controversy. At the princely session of Trebur and Oppenheim, the princes called on King Henry IV to undertake the &quot;Walk to Canossa&quot;. After Oppenheim was returned to the Empire in 1147, it became a Free Imperial City in 1225, during the Staufer Emperor Frederick II&#x27;s reign. At this time, the town was important for its imperial castle and the Burgmannen who lived there.

In the 14th century, the town was pledged to the Electorate of Mainz and beginning in 1398, it belonged to the territory of the Electoral Palatinate.

In 1621, the Oppenheim town chronicle reports a great fire in which the Oppenheim Town Hall was almost completely destroyed. The Electoral &quot;Oberamt&quot; archive, too, was lost in the fire, and so it was moved to Mainz.

On 14 September 1620, Spanish troops overran the town in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The Spaniards occupied Oppenheim until 1632. In 1688, French troops overran the town in the Nine Years&#x27; War (1688–1697). On 31 May 1689, Landskrone Castle and the town were utterly destroyed by the French under General Mélac. Until 1797, Oppenheim remained an Electoral Palatinate holding. After being in French hands, Oppenheim passed, in 1816, to the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt. It remained Hessian until 1945.

In March 1945, troops of the 3rd Army under General George S. Patton managed to build a crossing over the Rhine near Oppenheim and to occupy it.

== Politics ==

=== Town partnerships ===
* Givry, Saône-et-Loire, France
* Adnet, Salzburg, Austria
* Werder, Potsdam-Mittelmark, Brandenburg
* Calp, Alicante, Spain
* Sant&#x27;Ambrogio di Valpolicella, Province of Verona, Veneto, Italy

=== Coat of arms ===
The town&#x27;s arms might be described thus: Or an eagle displayed sable.

All town seals up until 1925 showed a crowned king&#x27;s head, but for one, from 1266, that showed the Emperor on his throne. Nevertheless, the town adopted arms with this composition while still using the king&#x27;s head seal. The arms have not changed since their adoption.

The arms have been borne since 1609.

== Wine sponsorship ==
In Oppenheim, wine was given considerable publicity by Mayor Dr. Heinz Scheller after he took office in 1935: For Scheller, the only city worthy of sponsoring Oppenheim&#x27;s wine was none other than the capital, Berlin. The town of Ansbach and the city of Osnabrück were also subsequently chosen. To revive this wine sponsorship and to give thanks for the commitment to the town of Oppenheim, the Governing Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, was “knighted” on 11 March 2006 by Mayor Marcus Held, earning the title of &quot;Wine Knight&quot; (&quot;Weinritter&quot;).

The sponsorship has found active expression in, among other things, the town&#x27;s participation in the estate festivals held by the Senate of Berlin in 2007 and 2008. At the invitation of Berlin&#x27;s governing mayor, Klaus Wowereit, a citizens’ delegation, under Mayor Marcus Held, took part in the festivities at the German Embassy in Paris on German Unity Day, as well as during the jubilee celebrations of the Berlin-Paris city partnership.

== Culture and sightseeing==


Worth seeing are:
* Katharinenkirche, with the stained glass (the &quot;Oppenheim Rose&quot;), is the most outstanding Gothic church on the Rhine between the Cologne Cathedral and the Strasbourg Cathedral.
* Landskron Castle&#x27;s ruins, with a lovely view over the Rhine rift and other church buildings in Oppenheim, also a venue for festival plays and other cultural events.
* The old town with its marketplace, town hall from 1621 (with a column from Landskron Castle&#x27;s hall in front, which reputedly came from the Ingelheim Imperial Palace), the former town fortifications with the Gautor and Rheintorpforte (gates), clocktower and town wall remnants, and unique museums (German Viticultural Museum, Town Museum).

Quite extraordinary is the &quot;Oppenheimer Kellerlabyrinth&quot; (“Oppenheim Cellar Labyrinth”) under the Old Town. Underground passageways, stairways and rooms link the houses and facilities with each other on a number of levels. In the heart of Old Town, near the Town Hall, there are altogether roughly of cellar passageways open to visitors, which are largely preserved in their original state. It is believed, however, that what has been opened to the public is only about 3% of the total underground passages. The exact extent of the passageways is still not known with any great certainty, despite investigations commissioned by the town, but the length is estimated to be at least . Guided tours through this unique underground labyrinth are offered all year round by the town&#x27;s Tourism and Festival Play Bureau. There are also town tours and night watchman tours.

=== Theatre ===
Annually, between August and October, the &quot;Oppenheimer Theaterfestspiele&quot; (“Oppenheim Theatre Festival Plays”) take place in the town&#x27;s &quot;Kulturkeller&quot; (“Culture Cellar”) and at Landskron Castle&#x27;s ruins.

=== Museums ===
Particularly worth visiting, besides Saint Katherine&#x27;s Church, the Town Museum and the underground labyrinth, is the German Viticultural Museum (&quot;Deutsches Weinbaumuseum&quot;) with the region&#x27;s oldest wine press from the &quot;Geistermühle&quot;, a centuries-old mill in Flonheim. Everything worth knowing about wine can be found here.

=== Music ===
In the &quot;Kultursommer&quot; (“Cultural Summer”), there are regular concerts in the town&#x27;s historic marketplace in front of the Town Hall. The Oppenheim Trombone Choir also gives regular performances.

=== Sport ===
There are several sport clubs in Oppenheim, e.g., TC Rot-Weiß Oppenheim (Red-White Tennis Club) (tennis), FSV Oppenheim (Football Sport-Verein) (football), and one founded in 1846 that may well have the most members, TV Oppenheim. TV (Turn-Verein= gymnastics and sports association) Oppenheim is successful well beyond its home region in gymnastics, swimming, cycling sports and above all, basketball.

=== Regular events ===
Each year in the town at Landskron Castle&#x27;s ruins, Saint Katherine&#x27;s Church, the &quot;Kulturkeller&quot; under the courthouse square and the marketplace, the &quot;Festspiele Oppenheim&quot; (“Oppenheim Festival Plays”) take place.

An Easter Market also takes place annually early in the year and later in the year, the Saint Katherine&#x27;s Market in the Old Town.

Other regular events in town are:
*The Easter Artists’ Market (&quot;Osterkünstlermarkt&quot;), a fortnight before Easter;
*The well-known and well-loved Oppenheim Wine Festival (&quot;Oppenheimer Weinfest&quot;) during the second weekend of August;
*&quot;Mittelalterspectaculum&quot; (“Mediaeval Spectacle”) in early May;
*Rhine Bicycle Ride between Worms and Oppenheim in mid-May;
*Fairytale Christmas Market (&quot;Märchenweihnachtsmarkt&quot;) at the historic Town Hall, Saint Katherine&#x27;s Church and the marketplace on the third Sunday of Advent.

<text>Nádia Conceição Almada (born 28 January 1977) is a Portuguese-born English television personality. She won the fifth series of &quot;Big Brother&quot;.

==Career==

===&quot;Big Brother&quot;===
Almada competed in the fifth series of &quot;Big Brother&quot; in 2004; she kept her transgender identity secret from fellow contestants although viewers were informed. After 71 days in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; house, she emerged as the winner, securing 74% of the overall vote and winning £63,500.

===Life after &quot;Big Brother&quot;===
Almada went on to record a single entitled &quot;A Little Bit of Action&quot;, which reached Number 27 in the UK Singles Chart in December 2004. She also made a guest appearance in the soap opera &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; turning on the Christmas Lights. She entered the &quot;Big Brother Australia&quot; house, visiting the three finalists during week 14 and has made various appearances on televised chat shows and game shows. In 2008, she co-presented &quot;The Big Brother Launch Night Project&quot; on the launch night of &quot;Big Brother 9&quot;. She also took part in &quot;Celebrity Fitness Videos Not Fit For TV&quot;, which was hosted by Lorraine Kelly and Eamonn Holmes. The show featured celebrities performing Almada&#x27;s own Latino inspired dance/fitness video, &quot;Latino Dance Workout&quot;, which she released in 2004.

Almada was also a contestant on the Channel 5 reality series, &quot;Trust Me...I&#x27;m A Holiday Rep&quot;. Almada was a replacement for &quot;Make Me a Supermodel&quot; contestant Jasmine Lennard. The following year, she was a celebrity guest on a four-day stay on Channel 4 reality series &quot;Fool Around With...&quot;; her goal was to decipher who out of several male contestants was single, enabling them to win £10,000. In an interview with &quot;Heat&quot; magazine in June 2009, Almada revealed that she is writing her memoirs. In 2010, to mark the end of &quot;Big Brother&quot; in the UK, she appeared on a &quot;Big Brother&quot; winners special of Channel 4 show &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot;, with &quot;Big Brother&quot; winners Brian Dowling, Brian Belo and Sophie Reade. Almada finished in third place.

===&quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot;===
On 24 August 2010, Almada entered the Big Brother house in &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot;. She was nominated for eviction on Day 8, and was evicted with 33.3% of the public vote in a double eviction after Makosi Musambasi on Day 11.
