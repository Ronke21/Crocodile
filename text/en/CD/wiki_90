<doc id="900674" wikidata="Q2634521" url="?curid=900674" title="Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament">
<text>Two names and a variety of titles are used to refer to Jesus in the New Testament. In Christianity, the two names Jesus and Emmanuel that refer to Jesus in the New Testament have salvific attributes. After the crucifixion of Jesus the early Church did not simply repeat his messages, but focused on him, proclaimed him, and tried to understand and explain his message. One element of the process of understanding and proclaiming Jesus was the attribution of titles to him. Some of the titles that were gradually used in the early Church and then appeared in the New Testament were adopted from the Jewish context of the age, while others were selected to refer to, and underscore the message, mission and teachings of Jesus. In time, some of these titles gathered Christological significance.

Christians have attached theological significance to the Holy Name of Jesus. The use of the name of Jesus in petitions is stressed in when Jesus states: &quot;If you ask the Father anything in my name he will give it you.&quot; There is widespread belief among Christians that the name Jesus is not merely a sequence of identifying symbols but includes intrinsic divine power.

==Names==

===Jesus===
In the New Testament the name Jesus is given both in the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of Matthew, and Emmanuel only in Matthew. In an angel tells Mary to name her child Jesus, and in an angel tells Joseph to name the child Jesus. The statement in Matthew 1:21 &quot;you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins&quot; associates salvific attributes to the name Jesus in Christian theology.

Although the precise difference between a &#x27;name&#x27; and a &#x27;title&#x27; may be open to interpretation, 198 different names and titles of Jesus in the Bible are listed in Cruden&#x27;s Concordance, first published in 1737, and continuously in print ever since. The first index of the book (following the royal dedications and author&#x27;s preface) is entitled &quot;A collection of the Names and Titles given to Jesus Christ&quot;, with 198 names listed, each accompanied by a biblical reference.

During his lifetime, when the need for specificity arose, a patronym or toponym would be added to his given name. These forms of address have been translated into English as &quot;Jesus son of Joseph,&quot; &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; and &quot;Jesus the Nazarene.&quot;

====Etymology====

There have been a number of proposals as to the origin and etymological origin of the name &quot;Jesus&quot;. The name is related to the Biblical Hebrew form &quot;Yehoshua`&quot;(), which is a theophoric name first mentioned in the Bible in referring to one of Moses&#x27; companions and his successor as leader of the Israelites. This name is usually considered to be a compound of two parts: &quot;Yeho&quot;, a theophoric reference to YHWH, the distinctive personal name of the God of Israel, plus a form derived from the Hebrew triconsonantal root &quot;y-š-ʕ&quot; or י-ש-ע &quot;to liberate, save&quot;. There have been various proposals as to how the literal etymological meaning of the name should be translated, including:

:*YHWH saves
:*YHWH (is) salvation
:*YHWH (is) a saving-cry
:*YHWH (is) a cry-for-saving
:*YHWH (is) a cry-for-help
:*YHWH (is) my help

This early Biblical Hebrew name (&quot;Yehoshua`&quot;) underwent a shortening into later biblical (&quot;Yeshua`&quot;), as found in the Hebrew text of verses Ezra 2:2, 2:6, 2:36, 2:40, 3:2, 3:8, 3:9, 3:10, 3:18, 4:3, 8:33; Nehemiah 3:19, 7:7, 7:11, 7:39, 7:43, 8:7, 8:17, 9:4, 9:5, 11:26, 12:1, 12:7, 12:8, 12:10, 12:24, 12:26; 1 Chronicles 24:11; and 2 Chronicles 31:15—as well as in Biblical Aramaic at verse Ezra 5:2. These Bible verses refer to ten individuals (in Nehemiah 8:17, the name refers to Joshua son of Nun). This historical change may have been due to a phonological shift whereby guttural phonemes weakened, including [h]. Usually, the traditional theophoric element &quot;Yahu&quot; was shortened at the beginning of a name to &quot;[Yo-]&quot;, and at the end to &quot;[-yah]&quot;. In the contraction of &quot;Yehoshua`&quot; to &quot;Yeshua`&quot;, the vowel is instead fronted (perhaps due to the influence of the &quot;y&quot; in triliteral root &quot;y-š-ʕ&quot;). During the post-biblical period, the name was also adopted by Aramaic and Greek-speaking Jews.

By the time the New Testament was written, the Septuagint had already transliterated ישוע (&quot;Yeshua`)&quot; into Koine Greek as closely as possible in the 3rd-century BCE, the result being (&quot;Iēsous&quot;). Since Greek had no equivalent to the Semitic letter &quot;shin&quot; [sh], it was replaced with a σ &quot;sigma&quot; [s], and a masculine singular ending [-s] was added in the nominative case, in order to allow the name to be inflected for case (nominative, accusative, etc.) in the grammar of the Greek language. The diphthongal [a] vowel of Masoretic &quot;Yehoshua`&quot; or &quot;Yeshua`&quot; would not have been present in Hebrew/Aramaic pronunciation during this period, and some scholars believe some dialects dropped the pharyngeal sound of the final letter (&quot;`ayin&quot;) [`], which in any case had no counterpart in ancient Greek. The Greek writings of Philo of Alexandria and Josephus frequently mention this name. It also occurs in the Greek New Testament at Acts 7:45 and Hebrews 4:8, referring to Joshua son of Nun.

From Greek, (&quot;Iēsous&quot;) moved into Latin at least by the time of the Vetus Latina. The morphological jump this time was not as large as previous changes between language families. (&quot;Iēsous&quot;) was transliterated to Latin &quot;IESVS&quot;, where it stood for many centuries. The Latin name has an irregular declension, with a genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative of &quot;Jesu&quot;, accusative of &quot;Jesum&quot;, and nominative of &quot;Jesus&quot;. Minuscule (lower case) letters were developed around 800 AD and some time later the U was invented to distinguish the vowel sound from the consonantal sound and the J to distinguish the consonant from I. Similarly, Greek minuscules were invented about the same time, prior to that the name was written in capital letters: or abbreviated as: with a line over the top, see also Christogram.

Modern English &quot;Jesus&quot; derives from Early Middle English &quot;Iesu&quot; (attested from the 12th century). The name participated in the Great Vowel Shift in late Middle English (15th century). The letter J was first distinguished from &#x27;I&#x27; by the Frenchman Pierre Ramus in the 16th century, but did not become common in Modern English until the 17th century, so that early 17th century works such as the first edition of the King James Version of the Bible (1611) continued to print the name with an I.

====&quot;Jesus&quot; forms====
&quot;Jesu&quot; is a remnant in modern English of the declension and use of grammatically inflected case endings with some proper nouns in Middle English, which persisted into Early Modern English to around the time of Shakespeare. The form Jesu is often a vocative, &quot;Jesu!&quot;, but may also stand for other cases, such as genitive, as in Latin. The form &quot;Jesu&quot; was preserved in hymns and poetry long after it had fallen out of general use in speech, for example in poet laureate Robert Bridges&#x27; translation of Johann Schop&#x27;s wording for the English translation of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s cantata, &quot;Jesu, Joy of Man&#x27;s Desiring&quot; and in T. S. Colvin&#x27;s hymn, &quot;Jesu, Jesu, fill us with your love&quot;, based on a song from northern Ghana. During the late 19th century, as &quot;Jesu&quot; was increasingly seen as antiquated, some churches attempted to update the wording of hymns containing &quot;Jesu&quot; to &quot;Jesus&quot;. In modernizing hymn texts the use of &quot;Jesu&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;Jesus&#x27;&quot; could cause problems where the metre only allowed two syllables, &quot;Je-su&#x27;s&quot;.

====Significance of the name====
Christians have attached theological significance to the name of Jesus from the earliest days of Christianity. Devotions to and feasts for the Holy Name of Jesus exist both in Eastern and Western Christianity. The devotions and venerations to the name Jesus also extend to the IHS monogram, derived from the Greek word for Jesus ΙΗΣΟΥΣ.

The significance of the name of Jesus in the New Testament is underscored by the fact that in his Nativity account Matthew pays more attention to the name of the child and its theological implications than the actual birth event itself.

Reverence for the name of Jesus is emphasized by Saint Paul in where he states: &quot;That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth&quot;.

The use of the name of Jesus in petitions is stressed in when Jesus states: &quot;If you ask the Father anything in my name he will give it you.&quot; Many Christian prayers thus conclude with the words: &quot;Through Our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. There is widespread belief among Christians that the name Jesus is not merely a sequence of identifying symbols but includes intrinsic divine power, and that where the name of Jesus is spoken or displayed the power of Jesus can be called upon.

===Emmanuel===
Matthew 1:23 (&quot;they shall call his name Emmanuel&quot;) provides the name &#x27;Emmanuel&#x27; (meaning &quot;God is with us&quot;). &#x27;Emmanuel&#x27;, which is taken from Isaiah 7:14, does not appear elsewhere in the New Testament.

The name &#x27;Emmanuel&#x27; (also &quot;Immanuel&quot; or &quot;Imanu&#x27;el&quot;) of the Hebrew &quot;עִמָּנוּאֵל&quot; &quot;God [is] with us&quot; consists of two Hebrew words: אֵל (’El, meaning &#x27;God&#x27;) and עִמָּנוּ (ʻImmānū, meaning &#x27;with us&#x27;); Standard Hebrew &quot;ʻImmanuʼel&quot;, Tiberian Hebrew &quot;ʻImmānûʼēl&quot;. It is a theophoric name used in the Bible in Isaiah 7:14 and .

Some interpreters see Matthew 1:23 providing a key to Emmanuel Christology in the New Testament, with Matthew showing an interest in identifying Jesus as &quot;God with us&quot; and later developing the Emmanuel theme at key points throughout his Gospel. The name Emmanuel does not directly appear elsewhere in the New Testament, but Matthew builds on the motif in to indicate that Jesus will be with the faithful to the end times. According to Ulrich Luz, the Emmanuel motif brackets the entire Gospel of Matthew between 1:23 and 28:20, appearing explicitly and implicitly in several other passages, setting the tone for the salvific theme of Matthew. Some Christians see the same meaning in Matthew 28:20 (&quot;I am with you always, even unto the end of the world&quot;) indicates that Jesus will be with the faithful to the end of the age.

==Titles==

===Christ===

The title &quot;Christ&quot; used in the English language is from the Greek (&quot;Christos&quot;), via the Latin &quot;Christus&quot;. It means &quot;anointed one&quot;. The Greek is a loan translation of the Hebrew &quot;mashiaħ&quot; (מָשִׁיחַ) or Aramaic &quot;mshiħa&quot; (מְשִׁיחָא), from which the English word &quot;messiah&quot; is derived. &quot;Christ&quot; has now become a name, one part of the name &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;, but originally it was a title (&quot;the Messiah&quot;) and not a name; however its use in the phrase &quot;Christ Jesus&quot; is a title.

The Greek-language Septuagint version of the Hebrew Bible (translated over a century before the time of Jesus), used the word &quot;Christos&quot; to express in Greek the Hebrew word &quot;mashiach&quot; (messiah), meaning &quot;anointed&quot;. (Another Greek word, &quot;Messias&quot;, appears in Daniel 9:26 and Psalm 2:2.) The New Testament states that the long-awaited Messiah had come and describes this savior as &quot;the Christ&quot;. In , the Apostle Peter—in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the first century—said, &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot; In Martha tells Jesus &quot;you are the Christ&quot;, just before the raising of Lazarus.

In the Pauline Epistles the word &quot;Christ&quot; is so closely associated with Jesus that it is apparent that for the early Christians there is no need to claim that Jesus is Christ, for that is considered widely accepted among them. Hence Paul can use the term &quot;Christos&quot; with no confusion as to whom it refers to, and as in and he can use expressions such as &quot;in Christ&quot; to refer to the followers of Jesus.

Canonical biblical texts lack any account of a formal literal anointing of Jesus as &quot;Christ&quot; with the traditional oil (or chrism).Christological thought may interpret the baptism of Jesus in water by John the Baptist (Matthew 3:16) as a metaphorical anointing carried out in the light of Isaiah 61:1 – &quot;the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings&quot;.

Early followers of Jesus, who soon came known as &quot;Christians&quot; () after the title &quot;Christos&quot;, developed symbols for representing Christ (i.e. Christograms) – for example, the &quot;Chi Rho&quot; symbol, formed by superimposing the first two Greek letters in &quot;Christ&quot; ( Greek : &quot;Χριστός&quot; ): chi = ch () and rho = r (), to produce ☧.

===Lord===
Early Christians viewed Jesus as &quot;the Lord&quot; and the Greek word &quot;Kyrios&quot; (κύριος) which may mean God, lord or master appears 775 times in the New Testament, referring to him. In everyday Aramaic, &quot;Mari&quot; was a very respectful form of polite address, well above &quot;Teacher&quot; and similar to Rabbi. In Greek this has at times been translated as Kyrios. While the term Mari expressed the relationship between Jesus and his disciples during his life, the Greek Kyrios came to represent his lordship over the world.

Pauline writings further established the various theological consequences of the Lord/Kyrios concept among early Christians, and emphasized the attributes of Jesus as not only referring to his eschatological victory, but to him as the &quot;divine image&quot; (Greek &quot;eikōn&quot;) in whose face the glory of God shines forth. In Paul emphasized the salvific value of the title, and stated that confessing by mouth (&quot;homologeo&quot;) the belief that Jesus is Lord (&quot;Kyrion Iesoun&quot;) signifies one&#x27;s salvation.

The high frequency of the use of the term Kyrios in the Acts of the Apostles indicates how natural it was for early Christians to refer to Jesus in this way. This title persisted among Christians as the predominant perception of Jesus for a number of centuries.

The use of the &quot;Kyrios title&quot; for Jesus is central to the development of New Testament Christology, for the early Christians placed it at the center of their understanding and from that center attempted to understand the other issues related to the Christian mysteries. The question of the deity of Christ in the New Testament is inherently related to the Kyrios title of Jesus used in the early Christian writings and its implications for the absolute lordship of Jesus. In early Christian belief, the concept of Kyrios included the pre-existence of Christ for they believed that if Christ is one with God, he must have been united with God from the very beginning.

The title, even in the Greek form, continues to be widely used in Christian liturgy, e.g. in the Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison combination (i.e. &quot;Lord have mercy&quot;, &quot;Christ have mercy&quot;), where Jesus is referred to as Lord in one case, and as Christ immediately thereafter.

===Master===
The Greek word &quot;Epistates&quot; (&quot;Epistata&quot; in the vocative case) is used only in Luke&#x27;s gospel, where it occurs six times. Robert O&#x27;Toole argues that the word relates to Jesus&#x27; power over the material world rather than his teaching. Some commentators suggest that in Luke 5, Peter progresses from seeing Jesus as &quot;Master&quot; (v. 5) to seeing him as &quot;Lord&quot; (v. 8).

===Logos (the Word)===


 calls Jesus the &quot;Logos&quot; (Greek ), often used as &quot;the Word&quot; in English translations. The identification of Jesus as the Logos which became Incarnate appears only at the beginning of the Gospel of John and the term Logos/Word is used only in two other Johannine passages: and . It appears nowhere else in the New Testament.

The series of statements regarding the Logos at the very beginning of the Gospel of John build on each other. The statement that the Logos existed &quot;at the beginning&quot; asserts that as Logos Jesus was an eternal being like God. The statement that the Logos was &quot;with God&quot; asserts the distinction of Jesus from God. The statement that the Logos &quot;was God&quot; states the unity of Jesus with God the Father, thus stating his divinity as God the Son.

In the arrival of the Logos as &quot;the Word of life&quot; from the beginning is emphasized and builds on it to emphasize the water and blood of incarnation. With the use of the title Logos, Johannine Christology consciously affirms the belief in the divinity of Jesus: that he was God who came to be among men as the Word Incarnate.

Although as of the 2nd century the use of the title Logos gave rise to debate between the Alexandrian and Antiochian schools of thought regarding the interaction of the human and divine elements in the Person of Christ, after the First Council of Nicaea in 325 and Council of Chalcedon in 451 the Logos and the second person of the Trinity were often used interchangeably.

===Son of God===
The title &quot;Son of God&quot; is applied to Jesus in many cases in the New Testament. It is often used to refer to his divinity, from the beginning in the Annunciation up to the Crucifixion. The declaration that Jesus is the Son of God is made by many individuals in the New Testament, on two separate occasions by God the Father as a voice from Heaven, and is also asserted by Jesus himself. The Son of God title, according to most Christian denominations, Trinitarian in belief, refers to the relationship between Jesus and God, specifically as &quot;God the Son&quot;.

For thousands of years, emperors and rulers ranging from the Western Zhou dynasty (c. 1000 B.C.) in China to Alexander the Great in Greece have assumed titles that reflect a filial relationship with deities. At the time of Jesus, Roman Emperor Augustus exploited the similarity between the titles Divi filius (son of the Divine One) and &quot;Dei filius&quot; (Son of God) and used the ambiguous inscription &quot;DF&quot; to refer to himself to emphasize the divine component of his image. J. D. Crossan argues that early Christians adopted this title.

The Gospel of Mark begins by calling Jesus the Son of God and reaffirms the title twice when a voice from Heaven calls Jesus &quot;my beloved Son&quot; in and . In Matthew 14:33, after Jesus walks on water, the disciples tell Jesus: &quot;You really are the Son of God!&quot; In , while Jesus hangs on the cross, the Jewish leaders mock him to ask God help, &quot;for he said, I am the Son of God&quot;, referring to the claim of Jesus to be the Son of God. Matthew 27:54 and include the exclamation by the Roman commander, &quot;He was surely the Son of God!&quot;, after the earthquake following the Crucifixion of Jesus. When, in , Apostle Peter states, &quot;You are Christ, the Son of the living God&quot;, Jesus not only accepts the titles, but calls Peter &quot;blessed&quot; and declares the profession a divine revelation, unequivocally declaring himself to be both Christ and the Son of God in .

In the New Testament, Jesus uses the term &quot;my Father&quot; as a direct and unequivocal assertion of his sonship, and a unique relationship with the Father beyond any attribution of titles by others, e.g., in , and . In a number of other episodes, Jesus claims sonship by referring to the Father, e.g., in Luke 2:49, when he is found in the temple, a young Jesus calls the temple &quot;my Father&#x27;s house&quot;, just as he does later in in the Cleansing of the Temple episode. In Matthew 1:11 and , Jesus allows himself to be called the Son of God by the voice from above, not objecting to the title.

Of all the Christological titles used in the New Testament, Son of God has had one of the most lasting impacts in Christian history and has become part of the profession of faith by many Christians. In the mainstream Trinitarian context, the title implies the full divinity of Jesus as part of the Holy Trinity of Father, Son and the Spirit. However, the concept of God as the father of Jesus and Jesus as the one and only Son of God is distinct from the concept of God as the Creator and father of all people, as indicated in the Apostles&#x27; Creed. The profession begins with expressing belief in the &quot;Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth&quot; and then immediately, but separately, in &quot;Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord&quot;, thus expressing both senses of fatherhood within the Creed.

===Son of man===
The term &quot;son of man&quot; appears many times in all four gospel accounts, e.g. 30 times in Matthew. However, unlike the title &quot;son of God&quot;, its proclamation has never been an article of faith in Christianity. While the profession of Jesus as the son of God has been an essential element of Christian creeds since the Apostolic Age, such professions do not apply to son of man. Yet, the Christological analysis of the relationship between the two terms has been the subject of much research.

In modern biblical research the occurrences of son of man in the Synoptic gospels are generally categorized into three groups: those that refer to his &quot;coming&quot; (as an exaltation), those that refer to &quot;suffering&quot; and those that refer to &quot;now at work&quot;, i.e. referring to the earthly life.

The presentation in the Gospel of John is somewhat different from the Synoptics and in John 1:51 he is presented as contact with God through &quot;angelic instrumentality&quot;, in John 6:26 and 6:53 he provides life through his death and in John 5:27 he holds the power to judge men. The first chapter of the Book of Revelation refers to &quot;one like unto a son of man&quot; in which radiantly stands in glory and speaks to the author. In the Gospel of John Jesus is not just a messianic figure, nor a prophet like Moses, but the key emphasis is on his dual role as son of God and son of man.

Although the son of man is distinct from the son of God, some gospel passages equate them in some cases, e.g. in , during the Sanhedrin trial of Jesus when the high priest asked Jesus: &quot;Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?&quot; Jesus responded &quot;I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.&quot; This builds on the statement in that &quot;The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again.&quot; In the parable of the Sheep and the Goats, the returning son of man has the power to judge, by separating men from &quot;all the nations&quot; into distinct groups, in Matthew 25:31–46.

For centuries, the Christological perspective on son of man has been a natural counterpart to that of son of God and in many cases affirms the humanity of Jesus just as son of God affirms his divinity. In the 5th century, Saint Augustine viewed the duality of son of God and son of man in terms of the dual nature of Christ in hypostatic union, in that the son of God became the son of man through the act of incarnation and wrote: &quot;Since he is the only Son of God by nature, he became also the Son of Man that he might be full of grace as well.&quot;

Geza Vermes has argued that &quot;the son of man&quot; in the Gospels is unrelated to these Hebrew Bible usages. He begins with the observation that there is no example of &quot;the&quot; son of man in Hebrew sources. He suggests that the term originates in Aramaic—&quot;bar nash/bar nasha&quot;. Based on his study of Aramaic sources, he concludes that in these sources: (1) &quot;Son of man&quot; is a regular expression for &quot;man&quot; in general. (2) It often serves as an indefinite pronoun (&quot;one&quot; or &quot;someone&quot;). (3) In certain circumstances it may be employed as a circumlocution. In monologues or dialogues the speaker can refer to himself, not as &#x27;I&#x27;, but as &quot;the son of man&quot; in the third person, in contexts implying awe, reserve, or modesty. (4) In none of the extant texts does &quot;son of man&quot; figure as a title.

James E. Talmage, a prominent writer and leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints argued that the definitive article used in the New Testament makes the title &quot;the Son of Man&quot; a distinguishing appellation exclusive to Jesus. Talmage supports the view of Vermes, but adds to it the additional meaning that Jesus is the son of an exalted man, subscribing to the Church&#x27;s doctrine of Exaltation. In this sense, too, the title is unique to Jesus, as he is the only literal physical offspring of God the Father.

No discussion of the title &quot;Son of Man&quot; (בר אנש) is complete without reference to the appearance of the term in the seventh chapter of the biblical book of Daniel. Daniel 7:13-14 in the English Standard Version reads,I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.In the context of this vision, Daniel is troubled and approaches someone standing there with him observing this bequeathal of kingship at the Throne of the Ancient of Days. The heavenly by-stander explains the import of the vision in the following words:And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; his kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him (Daniel 7:27, ESV).Here the term son of man is explained in three distinct ways: 1) as &quot;the people of the saints of the Most High,&quot; 2) as a single entity in the words &quot;&quot;his&quot; kingdom&quot; and &quot;serve and obey &quot;him&quot;,&quot; and 3) as &quot;the Most High&quot; Himself where it says &quot;the Most High; his kingdom.&quot; Furthermore, the passage presents a contextual time frame for the events envisioned—the time of the &quot;fourth kingdom on earth&quot; (Daniel 7:23). The most traditional and widespread view is that the fourth kingdom represents the Roman governmental system. With the establishment of Christianity under this Roman governmental system, the Christian Churches came to identify the son of man in Daniel 7 as Jesus the Christ. The Apostle Paul describes the corporate nature of the Son of Man envisioned in Daniel 7 when he writes to the Church at Corinth, saying, For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ (First Corinthians 12:12, ESV).The Pauline epistles depict Christ as the Head of His people the Church (Ephesians 1:15-23; Colossians 1:13-18). The New Testament identifies Jesus the Christ as the Most High, Whose Name is above all names (Philippians 2:9-10). The Gospel of Mark, often claimed by modern scholarship to be the first and earliest of the Four Gospels, identifies Jesus Christ as the LORD God of Israel by reference to the Tetragrammaton at the beginning of his Gospel:The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, “Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way, the voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight’” (Mark 1:1-3, ESV).From the context, it is evident that Mark is identifying &quot;my messenger&quot; as John the Baptist, sent to prepare the way of Jesus Christ. The Sender of the messenger is God. When it says &quot;before your face, who will prepare your way,&quot; the context confirms Mark as speaking of the face of Jesus Christ and of preparing Jesus Christ&#x27;s way. The most striking element of this passage, however, is the equivalency Mark draws between the way of Jesus Christ and &quot;the way of the Lord&quot; (τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου). The implication is that Jesus Christ is the Lord (Κύριος). This reference to the way of the Lord is taken from the prophet Isaiah 40:3:A voice cries: “In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; make straight in the desert a highway for our God (ESV).In the Hebrew texts, &quot;the way of the LORD&quot; is &quot;the way of Y-WH,&quot; using the Holy Tetragrammaton, the Divine Name of the God of Israel revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 3:13-15). In this way the Gospel according to Mark identifies Jesus as both Messiah and the LORD God of Israel. Likewise, the most Jewish Gospel of Matthew, held to be the first Gospel according to the tradition of the Christian Church, identifies Jesus Christ as &quot;the Son of Man&quot; and &quot;the Son of the Living God&quot; (Matthew 16:13), the Son of the Virgin and as God with us (Matthew 1:23). So in Orthodox Christian theology, Jesus Christ is both Most High and Son of Man, whose mystical Body is the Church, and &quot;of His Kingdom there shall be no end&quot; (Luke 1:33; Nicene Creed). According to Christian theology, the faithful of Christ will reign with Him over sin, death, and corruption both in this life and in the next (Romans 5:17; 2 Timothy 2:12). This unfolding kingdom is held by Christians to be the fulfillment of the Son-of-Man vision recorded in Daniel 7.

===Son of David===
The title &quot;Son of David&quot; indicates Jesus&#x27; physical descent from David, as well as his membership of the Davidic line of kings, establishing the claim of Jesus Christ to the Davidic Throne based on the promises God made to King David through Nathan the prophet when David was hoping to build God a house, or temple:Moreover, the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house. When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, but my steadfast love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you. And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever (2 Samuel 7:11-16).This promise assures King David of an ongoing royal lineage forever that cannot be thwarted or annulled through human sin. The Promised Offspring par excellence will build a House for God, will reign on an Eternal Throne, will be called the &quot;son&quot; of God, and will be chastened with beating should he commit iniquity. One might well ask what would be the result for humankind if a Son of David who is sinless were to be beaten with &quot;the stripes of the sons of men.&quot; Would it result in Divine judgment or Divine mercy? The Apostle Paul seems to answer this question in his Epistle to the Romans:Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations, including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ, To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 1:1-7, ESV).According to the Apostle Paul, the unjust death of the Son of God and His resurrection from the dead result in grace, peace, and an increasing faithful obedience among all nations through the proclamation of the Gospel. The Kingdom of the Son of David, Jesus Christ, is portrayed in the New Testament as being current as He reigns at the right hand of the Father (Hebrews 8:1; Revelation 2:26-27; 20:4-6). It should be no surprise to anyone familiar with the Scriptures that the Throne of the LORD is the same as the Throne of David because these are equated in First Chronicles 29:23. The Messianic vision of Isaiah in Isaiah chapter 11 is envisioned in the New Testament as spreading gradually toward a final culmination (Matthew 13:33; Luke 17:20-21).

The phrase &quot;Son of David&quot; is used a number of times in the gospel of Matthew. It appears in Matthew 1:1 to introduce both the genealogy and the gospel. It is found on the lips of the blind men healed in Galilee (&quot;Have mercy on us, Son of David&quot;, ), the crowd who are amazed at Jesus&#x27; healing of a blind, mute and demon-possessed man ), the Canaanite woman whose daughter is exorcised (&quot;Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me,&quot; ), and the blind men healed near Jericho (&quot;Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us&quot;, ). It also forms part of the shout of the crowds when Jesus enters Jerusalem: &quot;Hosanna to the Son of David&quot; (Matthew 21:9). Other references with the same use include and . A variant of this title is found in , where Jesus refers to himself as &quot;the Root and the Offspring of David&quot;. According to Anglican Bishop Charles Ellicott, &quot;Son of David&quot; was &quot;the most popular of all the names of the expected Christ&quot;.

===Son of Joseph===
Jesus was referred to as the Son of Joseph in the genealogy accounts of Matthew and Luke.

===Lamb of God===
The title &quot;Lamb of God&quot; (Agnus Dei) only appears in the Gospel of John, with the exclamation of John the Baptist: &quot;Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world&quot; in , the title reaffirmed the next day in . The second use of the title Lamb of God takes place in the presence of the first two apostles of Jesus, who immediately follow him, address him as Rabbi with respect and later in the narrative bring others to meet him.

These two proclamations of Jesus as the Lamb of God closely bracket the Baptist&#x27;s other proclamation in : &quot;I have borne witness that this is the Son of God&quot;. From a Christological perspective, these proclamations and the descent of the Holy Spirit as a dove in John 1:32 reinforce each other to establish the divine element of the Person of Christ. In Johannine Christology the proclamation &quot;who takes away the sins of the world&quot; begins the unfolding of the salvific theme of the redemptive and sacrificial death of Jesus, followed by his resurrection, which is built upon in other proclamations such as &quot;this is indeed the Saviour of the world&quot; uttered by the Samaritans in . 

Paul refers to &quot;Christ, our Passover lamb&quot; in ; however, nothing in the context of this passage directly implies that Paul refers in that specific wording to the death of Jesus using the same theme.

The Book of Revelation includes over twenty references to a lion-like lamb (&quot;slain but standing&quot;) which delivers victory in a manner reminiscent of the resurrected Christ. In the first appearance of the lamb in Revelation () only the lamb (which is of the tribe of Judah, and the root of David) is found worthy to take the judgment scroll from God and break the seals. In the lamb is said to have twelve apostles.

The theme of a sacrificial lamb which rises in victory as the Resurrected Christ was employed in early Christology, e.g. in 375 Saint Augustine wrote: &quot;Why a lamb in his passion? For he underwent death without being guilty of any inequity. Why a lion in his resurrection? For in being slain, he slew death.&quot; The Lamb of God title has found widespread use in Christian prayers and the &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; (&quot;Lamb of God who take away the sins of the world have mercy on us; Lamb of God who take away the sins of the world grant us peace&quot;) is used both in liturgy and as a form of contemplative prayer. It references the concept of a scapegoat, where people put their blame on others, however with the interpretation of Jesus taking on Christian&#x27;s sins.

===New Adam / Second Adam / Last Adam===

Just as the Gospel of John proclaims the universal relevance of the Incarnation of Jesus as Logos, the Pauline view emphasizes the cosmic view that his birth, Crucifixion and Resurrection brought forth a new man and a new world. Paul&#x27;s eschatological view of Jesus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to Adam. Unlike Adam, the new man born in Jesus obeys God and ushers in a world of morality and salvation.

In the Pauline view, Adam is positioned as the first man and Jesus as the second and last Adam (), the first having corrupted himself by his disobedience, also infected humanity and left it with a curse as inheritance. The birth of Jesus, on the other hand, counterbalanced the fall of Adam, bringing forth redemption and repairing the damage done by Adam.

The theme is reiterated by Paul, in , when he states:
Therefore just as one man&#x27;s trespass led to condemnation for all, so one man&#x27;s act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all. For just as by the one man&#x27;s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man&#x27;s obedience the many will be made righteous. But law came in, with the result that the trespass multiplied; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, so that, just as sin exercised dominion in death, so grace might also exercise dominion through justification* leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
In the 2nd century Church Father Irenaeus continued this tradition and stated: &quot;so that what we had lost in Adam - namely to be according to the image and likeness of God- that we might recover in Christ Jesus.&quot; Irenaeus also used the analogy of &quot;second Adam and second Eve&quot; and suggested the Virgin Mary as the &quot;second Eve&quot; who had set a path of obedience for the second Adam (i.e. Jesus) from the Annunciation to Calvary.

The tradition continued in the 4th century by Ephrem the Syrian and later by Saint Augustine in his &quot;Felix culpa&quot;, i.e. the happy fall from grace of Adam and Eve. Later, in the 16th century, John Calvin viewed the birth of Jesus as the second Adam one of the six modes of atonement.

=== Light of the World ===

Jesus is called a light in seven instances in the New Testament and Light of the World only in the Gospel of John. The terms &quot;Bread of Life&quot; and &quot;Life of the World&quot; are also applied by Jesus to himself in John&#x27;s Gospel in the same Christological sense.

In Jesus applies the title to himself while debating with the Jews, and states:

:I am the light of the world: he who follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

Jesus again claims to be Light of the World in , during the miracle of healing the blind at birth, saying:
:When I am in the world, I am the Light of the World.

This episode leads into where Jesus metaphorically explains that he came to this world, so that the blind may see.

In the Christological context, the use of the title &quot;Light of the World&quot; is similar to the use of the title &quot;Bread of Life&quot; in , where Jesus states: &quot;I am the bread of life: he who comes to me shall not hunger. These assertions build on the Christological theme of where Jesus claims to possess life Just as the Father does and provide it to those who follow him. The term &quot;Life of the World&quot; is applied in the same sense by Jesus to himself in .

This application of &quot;light compared with darkness&quot; also appears in which applies it to God and states: &quot;God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.&quot;

Jesus also used the term Light of the World to refer to his disciples, in : The term &quot;Light of the World&quot; is related to the parables of Salt and Light and Lamp under a bushel.

===King of the Jews===
In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the &quot;King of the Jews&quot; on three occasions, coming at the beginning of his life and at the end. Both uses of the title lead to dramatic results in the New Testament accounts. In the account of the Nativity of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, wise men (called the Magi) who come from the east call Jesus the &quot;King of the Jews&quot;, causing King Herod to order the Massacre of the Innocents. In the accounts of the Passion of Jesus in all four Canonical Gospels, the use of the &quot;King of the Jews&quot; title leads to charges against Jesus that result in his Crucifixion.

The title &quot;King of the Jews&quot; is used only by the gentiles, namely by the Magi, Pontius Pilate and the Roman soldiers. In contrast the Jewish leaders in the Passion accounts prefer the designation &quot;King of Israel&quot;, as in , . The use of the term &quot;King&quot; in the charges brought against Jesus is central in the decision to crucify him. In Pilate seeks to release Jesus, but the Jews object, saying: &quot;If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar&#x27;s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar&quot; bringing the power of Caesar to the forefront of the discussion for the assumption of the title King implies rebellion against the Roman Empire.

The final use of the title only appears in . Here, after Jesus has carried the cross to Calvary and has been nailed to the cross, the soldiers look up on him on the cross, mock him, offer him vinegar and say: &quot;If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.&quot; In the parallel account in the Jewish priests mock Jesus as &quot;King of Israel&quot;, saying: &quot;He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.&quot;

===Rabboni and Rabbi===

In , when Mary Magdalene encounters Jesus shortly after the Resurrection, she calls him Rabbouni (&quot;ῥαββουνί&quot;) literally &quot;my great [one]&quot; or (more extensively) &quot;my Teacher&quot;. For those who do not speak Aramaic the Gospel of John translates this as &quot;teacher&quot;, a Rabbi being a Jewish teacher, or master. In the New Testament, the term &quot;Rhabbouni&quot; is only used by the Magdalene here in John 20:16 and in by the blind man Bartimaeus in the account of the miracle of healing the blind near Jericho.

The Rabbi title is used in several New Testament episodes to refer to Jesus, but more often in the Gospel of John than elsewhere and does not appear in the Gospel of Luke at all. In Matthew&#x27;s account of the Last Supper () when Jesus says that he will be betrayed by one of his Apostles, one after another the Apostles say &quot;Surely it is not I, Lord&quot; but Judas Iscariot says &quot;Surely it is not I, Rabbi&quot;, using the term Rabbi instead of Lord. The Iscariot again calls Jesus Rabbi in when he betrays him in the Kiss of Judas episode, heavily implying he may never have acknowledged, believed, or understood the divinity of Jesus.

In , Jesus affirms the term Rabbi and Father are not to be used for any man, but only for God and for Christ.
Jesus is called Rabbi in conversation by Apostle Peter in and , and by Judas Iscariot in 
by Nathanael in , where he is also called the Son of God in the same sentence. On several occasions, the disciples also refer to Jesus as Rabbi in the Gospel of John, e.g. , , and .

Intimating that the title Rabbi was used by status-seeking Pharisees (who &quot;sit on the seat of Moses&quot;) and use the title as a sign of authority, in Jesus rejected the title of Rabbi for his disciples, saying: &quot;But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your teacher, and all ye are brethren&quot;. The role of teacher is also referred to the Paraclete, mentioned by Jesus for the first time on the night before the Crucifixion.

Talmudic Scholar [Sherira Gaon] (c. 906 CE to c. 1006 CE) wrote that the title Rabbi did not exist until at least 50 CE. Thus, the New Testament references to rabbi are anachronisms.

===Other names and titles===
The New Testament uses several titles to refer to Jesus. However, some terms that are commonly used in the Christian tradition rarely appear in the New Testament, e.g. the exact term &quot;Savior&quot; appears only once, and is uttered by the Samaritans in . The title &quot;Nazarene&quot; applied to Jesus has been also used to designate Christians in Syriac and Arabic traditions.

The title &quot;Chosen one&quot; or &quot;Elect one&quot; is used twice in Luke&#x27;s gospel: &quot;eklektos&quot; is used in 23:35 when the rulers mock Jesus, while &quot;eklelegmenos&quot; is used in 9:35 when Jesus is transfigured. James R. Edwards notes that the phrase is used repeatedly in 1 Enoch, but was associated in Jewish thinking with triumph and glory, rather than with suffering.
Christian theologians such as Thomas Aquinas have produced significant arguments analyzing various names and titles for Jesus. In Jesus says: &quot;Before Abraham was born, I am.&quot; The phrase &quot;I am&quot; (εγω ειμι in Greek) was considered a name for Jesus by Aquinas who considered it the most proper of all divine names, for Aquinas believed it to refer to the &quot;being of all things&quot;.

One of the titles preceded by an &quot;I am&quot; assertion of Jesus is the &quot;Bread of Life&quot; title in : &quot;I am the bread of life: he who comes to me shall not hunger.&quot; The Bread of Life Discourse takes place in the Gospel of John shortly after Jesus feeds the crowds with five loaves of bread and two fish.

In the Epistle to the Hebrews, Jesus is called an &quot;Apostle&quot; and a &quot;High Priest&quot; in , the preparation for the two titles being the preceding text of which present the two functions of Jesus: as an Apostle he represents God to humanity and as a High Priest he represents humanity to God.

While John&#x27;s Gospel emphasizes Jesus as the Son of God, the Gospel of Luke depicts him as a prophet above all else, attributing that title to Jesus more often than even Mark. A prophet is not someone who merely preaches, but claims divine revelation through God. In , following his hometown rejection, Jesus remarks that as a prophet he is not welcome in his own hometown. Elsewhere, in the Jews again doubt that Jesus is a prophet. The view of Jesus as a prophet is used in the concept of threefold office which sees his three roles as &quot;Prophet, Priest and King&quot;. While during early Christianity there were people claiming to be prophets, there are no records of anyone else claiming to be a prophet during the life of Jesus.

In Jesus said he will ask the Father to send &quot;another&quot; paraclete, i.e. comforter. The term paraclete only appears in Johannine literature and apart from the four uses in the Gospel of John it appears only in . Given that views Jesus as a paraclete, the reference in John 14:16 states that Jesus sends a second paraclete to continue the life of the Church after his departure. The statement regarding the paraclete is made within the &quot;farewell discourse&quot; during the Last Supper of Jesus and the Apostles. The paraclete is thus a link between the ministry of Jesus and the future life of the Church.

Some titles of Jesus are unique to the Book of Revelation. He is referred to as &quot;Faithful and True&quot; in , the &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot; in and elsewhere, and the &quot;Morning Star&quot; in .

<text>Rosecliff is a Gilded Age mansion of Newport, Rhode Island, now open to the public as a historic house museum. The house has also been known as the Hermann Oelrichs House or the J. Edgar Monroe House.

It was built 1898–1902 by Theresa Fair Oelrichs, a silver heiress from Nevada, whose father James Graham Fair was one of the four partners in the Comstock Lode. She was the wife of Hermann Oelrichs, American agent for Norddeutscher Lloyd steamship line. She and her husband, together with her sister, Virginia Fair, bought the land in 1891 from the estate of George Bancroft and commissioned the architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White to design a summer home suitable for entertaining on a grand scale. With little opportunity to channel her considerable energy elsewhere, she &quot;threw herself into the social scene with tremendous gusto, becoming, with Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish and Mrs. O.H.P. Belmont (of nearby Belcourt), one of the three great hostesses of Newport.&quot;

The principal architect, Stanford White, modeled the mansion after the Grand Trianon of Versailles, but smaller and reduced to a basic &quot;H&quot; shape, while keeping Mansart&#x27;s scheme of a glazed arcade of arched windows and paired Ionic pilasters, which increase to columns across the central loggia. White&#x27;s Rosecliff adds to the Grand Trianon a second storey with a balustraded roofline that conceals the set-back third storey, containing twenty small servants&#x27; rooms and the pressing room for the laundry.

==Construction and interiors==

The commission was given to McKim, Mead, and White in 1898, and the New York branch of Jules Allard and Sons were engaged as interior decorators. Construction started in 1899, but the sharp winter slowed construction; Mrs. Oelrichs&#x27; sister had married William K. Vanderbilt II that winter season, and the house was required for parties in the following Newport season; the eager Mrs. Oelrichs moved in July 1900, sending the workmen out in order to give a first party in August, a dinner for one hundred and twelve to outdo Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish&#x27;s Harvest Festival Ball at Crossways. Ferns and floral arrangements concealed the unfinished areas. The house was not completed until 1902.

Rosecliff&#x27;s brick construction is clad in white architectural terracotta tiles. Stanford White&#x27;s sophisticated spatial planning offered unexpected views &quot;en filade&quot; through aligned doorways centered on handsome monumental fireplaces with projecting overmantels.

The central &quot;corps de logis&quot; is entirely taken up with the ballroom as it appeared on White&#x27;s plans which, with the Louis XIV furniture removed, could serve as Newport&#x27;s largest ballroom at . Its scheme of single and paired Corinthian pilasters alternating with arch-headed windows and recessed doorways echoes the articulation of the exterior. This is reached through the French doors on either side, to a plain terrace dropping by broad stairs to the lawn facing the ocean, or to a planted terrace garden with a central fountain.

In the northernmost of the wings that project from both sides of the central block, is a dining room and a billiard room separated by a marble anteroom backed, on the service side, by a butler&#x27;s pantry with two dumbwaiters. These communicate with the all-but-subterranean kitchens below which were lit, invisibly, from the sunken service yard on the north side of the house. The main entrance, on the opposite south wing, is through a vestibule where the exterior Ionic order is carried inside, now suitably enriched, under an emphatic cornice that divides the height 2:3.

The vestibule is separated, by a tripartite screen with an arched central opening flanked above the cornice by bull&#x27;s-eye openings in which baroque vases stand, from a grand Stair Hall. The Stair Hall projects from the south block to accommodate a grand staircase that sweeps forward through a heart-shaped opening into the floor space. This divides at a landing to return in matched recurving flights to the upper floor.

Beyond the Stair Hall is the Salon with the same proportions as the Dining Room (3:4, or 30 by 40 feet) and like it, originally hung with tapestry. Its ceiling is coffered. Its overscaled Gothic fireplace of Caen stone is the one eclectic anomaly in Rosecliff&#x27;s interiors.

Upstairs, three grand bedrooms of equal importance and guest bedrooms of graduated sizes may be linked by opened doors or isolated by locked ones, in a flexible arrangement of rooms or suites, all with baths, and all separated from the wide corridor by intervening dressing closets for hermetic privacy from the staff, who moved up and down stairs by means of two small service stairs contrived in spaces smaller than the master bedrooms&#x27; walk-in closets.

The most famous of Mrs. Oelrich&#x27;s parties was the &quot;Bal blanc&quot; of 19 August 1904 to celebrate the Astor Cup Races, in which everything was white and silver.

Mrs. Oelrich died at Newport on November 22, 1926. The funeral took place in the &quot;beautiful blue and gold tapestry room&quot; at Rosecliff.

=== Monroe family ===

Hermann Oelrichs, Jr. kept Rosecliff in the family until 1941, then the estate went through several changes of ownership before being bought by Mr &amp; Mrs J. Edgar Monroe of New Orleans in 1947. Mr. Monroe, a southern gentleman who had made his fortune in the ship building industry, came to Newport with his wife Louise every summer to escape the summer heat of the Deep South. The two became well known for the large parties they threw at Rosecliff; many of which had a mardi gras theme, as the Monroes loved dressing up in fancy costumes for these parties. Unlike Mrs. Oelrichs&#x27; parties, which were stiff and formal, the Monroes&#x27; parties were relaxed and easygoing.

Hermann Oelrichs Jr. sold off all the furnishings in 1941. In 1971, Mr. and Mrs. Monroe donated the entire estate with its contents and a $2 million operating endowment to the Preservation Society of Newport County, who opened it to the public for tours. Mr. Monroe often would come back to the estate for charity events up until his death in 1991.

The American Beauty Rose was developed by earlier owner of the property George Bancroft and his gardener.

==In television and film==
The ballroom was used to film scenes for the 1974 version of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and for &quot;The Betsy&quot;, &quot;High Society&quot;, &quot;True Lies&quot;, and &quot;Amistad&quot;.

Footage for three episodes of the PBS television series &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; was shot inside and on the grounds of Rosecliff on September 19, 2017, with 3,000 people attending to have their antiques appraised. It was the first time in its 22 seasons on the air that any of the show&#x27;s episodes included appraisals filmed outdoors, although plans for all the appraisals to take place outdoors were spoiled by rain generated by Hurricane Jose offshore, and most of the appraisals took place inside the mansion or in tents erected on its grounds. The three episodes premiered on PBS in May 2018.

<doc id="900687" wikidata="Q406146" url="?curid=900687" title="Aintree">
<text>Aintree is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, Merseyside, England. Historically in Lancashire, it lies between Walton and Maghull on the A59 road, northeast of Liverpool city centre. In 2011 the parish had a population of 6689.

It is best known as the site of Aintree Racecourse, which since the 19th century has staged the Grand National horserace. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was also a three-mile-long international Grand Prix motor racing circuit on the site, which used the same grandstands as the horserace. A shorter form of the racing circuit is still used for various motorsport events.

The northern terminus of the Aintree district is commonly referred to by the local populace as &quot;Old Roan.&quot; This nomenclature is a colloquial moniker employed by residents and lacks formal legal recognition as a distinct geographical location.

==History==
The name Aintree, thought to be of Saxon origin, means &quot;one tree&quot; or &quot;tree standing alone.&quot; It is first recorded in 1226, also as Ayntre (the usual mediaeval spelling) in 1292. Eyntre occurs; Ayntree and Ayntrie, 16th century. Local legend held that an oak tree on Bull Bridge Lane (removed in 2004) was &quot;the Ain tree&quot; though the antiquity of the name excludes the possibility.

The historic core of the village was a small linear settlement near the junction of School Lane, Bull Bridge Lane and Wango Lane. Much of the nearby flat, wet and boggy land was reclaimed for agriculture following the Alt Drainage Act 1779 (19 Geo. 3. c. 33).

==Today==
The village itself has two primary schools, Aintree Davenhill and Holy Rosary and a Music School; five churches, St. Giles (Anglican), Holy Rosary (Roman Catholic), Old Roan Methodist Church, Old Roan Baptist Church (which met in Davenhill Primary School until recently and now meets at the former site of Holy Rosary Infants School) and Aintree Village Family Church (a Baptist church, meeting at Old Roan Methodist Church Hall, Altway); two small local shopping areas (on Altway and at the Old Roan); and three public houses, the Blue Anchor (which backs onto the Leeds and Liverpool Canal), The Valentine, named after a fence on the racecourse, and the Old Roan (now closed), which gives its name to a railway station in the village. The village also had a public library (now closed). A retail park along Ormskirk Road on former industrial land has brought a significant number of major out-of-town shops to the area.

Aintree Davenhill Primary School has a large field with a metal building that was built in the 1950s (since been rebuilt). The building was going to be a hospital building, but was turned into a school. The classrooms were along corridors that were originally going to be hospital wards.

Holy Rosary Primary School was a split-site school until 2008 with an approximate between the schools. The reception and infant classes were based at a site at the Old Roan end of the village between Altway and Aintree Lane, and the junior classes based at the Valentine end of the village in the Oriel Drive site. After substantial building work to extend the Oriel Drive school, the Aintree Lane/Altway site was closed as a school at the beginning of the 2008–09 academic year, was taken over by Old Roan Baptist Church and is now called the Hope Centre, providing various services for the local community. The school has a large field used for events such as their sports day and an all-weather sports pitch. The original building was built in the 1970s and 1980s.

==Transport==
The main road from Liverpool to Aintree is the A59 (known as Ormskirk Road as it passes through Aintree) - with the road passing through Aintree&#x27;s retail parks. The M57, M58, A59, and A5036 meet at a complex junction called Switch Island, between Aintree and Maghull.

Although Aintree railway station is convenient for the racecourse, the village itself is closer to Old Roan railway station. Both are on the Merseyrail Northern Line&#x27;s Ormskirk branch, with regular service between Liverpool Central and Ormskirk.

In the past, it was also served by Aintree Central railway station on the North Liverpool Extension Line, located behind Aintree railway station. The North Mersey Branch also ran through, close to the station, and had Aintree Racecourse railway station.

Bus services are regular: a bus every 20 minutes to Liverpool runs through the village, while various other routes to Liverpool and destinations to the north—including Maghull, Ormskirk, and Southport—stop near the Old Roan.

The Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs through the village.

<text>The Amazing Race 6 is the sixth season of the American reality competition show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. Hosted by Phil Keoghan, it featured eleven teams of two, each with a pre-existing relationship, competing in a race around the world to win US$1,000,000. This season visited four continents and ten countries and traveled over during twelve legs. Starting in Chicago, racers traveled through Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Senegal, Germany, Hungary, France, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, and China before returning to the United States, traveling through Hawaii, and finishing in Chicago. New twists introduced in this season include uniting teams for a task, the double-length leg, and limits on team members&#x27; Roadblock performances. The season premiered on CBS on November 16, 2004, and concluded on February 8, 2005.

Engaged couple Freddy Holliday and Kendra Bentley were the winners of this season, while dating couple Jon Buehler and Kris Perkins finished in second place, and exes Adam Malis and Rebecca Cardon finished in third place.

==Production==
===Development and filming===

In May 2004, CBS ordered the sixth season of the show, despite the fact that &quot;The Amazing Race 5&quot; had not yet aired. Early renewal was likely due to the success of the changes made in season 5. CBS also delayed the airing of season 6 until late in the fall and moved it out of its proposed Saturday timeslot in order to create a &quot;cool down&quot; period between races, in the hopes that this would help continue the newfound ratings success.

&quot;The Amazing Race 6&quot; spanned a total of over ten countries on four continents. The 30 days of filming began on August 13, 2004, and finished on September 12. &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; made its first trip to seven new countries: Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Hungary, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, and Senegal.

This season was the first in which team members had to complete an equal number of Roadblock tasks. No team member was permitted to complete more than six Roadblocks on the entire race. Throughout the season, host Phil Keoghan verbally stated this rule when introducing each leg&#x27;s Roadblock. This season also reduced the number of times the Yield appeared to three, compared to the previous season, where the Yield had been featured in almost every leg. This trend would continue in subsequent seasons.

A task in the second leg marked the first time that teams were required to work with each other. The ten teams had to split themselves into two groups of five, each of which had to row a Viking boat across a fjord.

According to Aaron Crumbaugh, the sixth leg was originally planned as two separate legs with the first part being a non-elimination point, where the losing team would have been stripped of their money. However, those planned legs were combined into one after producers realized that begging was illegal in Hungary.

This season featured a visit to Sri Lanka, where filming occurred just a few months before the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The episodes aired four weeks after the earthquake had devastated the locations the teams had visited. A special message was inserted at the beginning of the episodes in Sri Lanka, dedicating them to the victims and to those helping with the recovery.

==Cast==
This season&#x27;s cast included married professional wrestlers, dating actors, high school buddies, engaged models, and a team of married entrepreneurs. &quot;Early Show&quot; hosts Harry Smith and Dave Price ran the season&#x27;s first leg with the actual teams as part of a special segment on their morning show.
;Future appearances
Jonathan &amp; Victoria appeared on a &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; special to try to improve their marriage. Jonathan &amp; Victoria then competed on &quot;Battle of the Network Reality Stars&quot;. Later, in a celebrity version of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, Victoria attacked contestant Jon &quot;Jonny Fairplay&quot; Dalton (of &quot;&quot;), and Jonathan attacked host Joe Rogan, resulting in their expulsion from the show. Aaron competed on the twelfth season of &quot;Food Network Star&quot; and on &quot;Cutthroat Kitchen&quot;. Victoria had a cameo appearance on &quot;Whose Line is it Anyway?&quot;. Rebecca Cardon was in the reality show &quot;Kill Reality&quot; and appeared on the Bravo reality series &quot;Work Out&quot;.

==Results==
The following teams are listed with their placements in each leg. Placements are listed in finishing order. 
*A placement with a dagger () indicates that the team was eliminated. 
*An placement with a double-dagger () indicates that the team was the last to arrive at a Pit Stop in a non-elimination leg. As a penalty, they were stripped of all their money and were not given any at the start of the next leg.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
At the time it aired, &quot;The Amazing Race 6&quot; received negative reviews. Linda Holmes of &quot;Television Without Pity&quot; called this season disappointing. Scott Pierce of &quot;Deseret News&quot; said that his immediate reaction after the season finished was &quot;I&#x27;m never going to watch this show again.&quot; Reece Forward of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked this season as the show&#x27;s second-worst, writing that it &quot;is actively unlikable at points,&quot; but the season &quot;escapes the bottom slot due to at least having a few teams that are likable or interesting&quot;. Since its airing, this season was ranked 9th out of the first 27 seasons by the &quot;Rob Has a Podcast Amazing Race&quot; correspondents in 2016. In 2021, Val Barone of &quot;TheThings&quot; ranked this season as the show&#x27;s 4th best season. In 2022, Rhenn Taguiam of Game Rant ranked this season as the seventh-best season. In 2024, Taguiam&#x27;s ranking was updated with this season ranked 12th out of 36.

===Controversy===
The fifth episode featured two of the more controversial moments in the show&#x27;s history. In Dakar, Senegal, Kendra Bentley, who had previously decried being in &quot;ghetto Africa&quot; complained, &quot;This city is wretched and disgusting. And they just keep breeding and breeding in this poverty. I can&#x27;t take it.&quot; These comments were largely denounced as racist due to the equation of people in Africa as animals. Bentley later claimed that her comments were taken out of context saying, &quot;I was actually talking about the government and how they put people in these situations. They don’t give them opportunities for education or birth control.&quot; Lesser outrage was also directed at Rebecca Cardon for similar insensitive comments. On the way to the House of Slaves on Gorée Island, Cardon commented, &quot;I&#x27;d love to get out of Africa. I can see why so many people escaped.&quot; Kevin McDonough of &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; wrote, &quot;Now that&#x27;s a novel way to look at the Middle Passage.&quot;

Later in the episode, Jonathan Baker, angry at his wife, Victoria Fuller, for picking up his bag which he had dropped during a footrace to the mat, shoved her. He was modestly rebuked at the mat by Phil Keoghan, who saw Jonathan berating his wife but hadn&#x27;t witnessed the shove. In response, critics and fans decried seeing possible domestic violence on television. Baker later stated &quot;[t]he shove in Berlin was wrong. It was wrong and I should not have done it. I can&#x27;t apologize any more because I really felt that it hurt.&quot;

<text>A gold digger is a person, typically a woman, who engages in a type of transactional sexual relationship for money rather than love. If it turns into marriage, it is a type of marriage of convenience. 

== Etymology and usage ==
The term &quot;gold digger&quot; is a slang term that has its roots among chorus girls and sex workers in the early 20th century. In print, the term can be found in Rex Beach&#x27;s 1911 book, &quot;The Ne&#x27;er-Do-Well&quot;, and in the 1915 memoir &quot;My Battles with Vice&quot; by Virginia Brooks. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Random House&#x27;s Dictionary of Historical Slang&quot; state the term is distinct for women because they were much more likely to need to marry a wealthy man in order to achieve or maintain a level of socioeconomic status.

The term rose in usage after the popularity of Avery Hopwood&#x27;s play &quot;The Gold Diggers&quot; in 1919. Hopwood first heard the term in a conversation with Ziegfeld performer Kay Laurell. As an indication on how new the slang term was, Broadway producers urged him to change the title because they feared that the audience would think that the play was about mining and the Gold Rush.

==Society and culture==
===General===
There exist several cases where female public figures have been perceived as exemplars of the gold digger stereotype by the public. The best-known gold digger of the early 20th century was Peggy Hopkins Joyce. Joyce was a former show girl who married and divorced millionaires. She was characterized as a gold digger during her divorce battle with Stanley Joyce during the early 1920s. Some have argued that she was the real-life inspiration for Lorelei Lee, the protagonist in Anita Loos’ 1925 novel &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; which holds gold digging as a central theme. Additionally, some have contended that the term &quot;gold digger&quot; was coined to describe her. Former Olympian Eleanor Holm was dubbed the &quot;swimming gold digger&quot; for her divorce contest with Broadway impresario Billy Rose during the 1950s. The press and public described model/actress Anna Nicole Smith as a gold digger for marrying multi-millionaire octogenarian J. Howard Marshall II. There was even a book published as a Little Blue Book (Little Blue Book No. 1392, &quot;Confessions of a Gold Digger&quot;, by Betty Van Deventer, 1929).

=== Law ===
The recurring image of the gold digger in Western popular media throughout the 1920s and 1930s developed into an important symbol of a moral panic surrounding frivolous lawsuits. Sharon Thompson&#x27;s research has demonstrated how public perception of the prevalence of gold digging has created disadvantages for female spouses without their own source of income in the negotiation of alimony cases and prenuptial agreements. The gold digger stereotype triggered public discussions about heartbalm legislation during the 1930s, particularly breach of promise cases. Public outrage surrounding the image of frivolous lawsuits and unfair alimony payouts related to the gold digger archetype contributed to a nationwide push throughout the middle and late 1930s to outlaw heart balm legislation in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1935/03/26/first-lady&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
===Film===
The gold digger emerged as a dominant trope in American popular culture beginning in the 1920s. Stephen Sharot stated that the gold digger supplanted the popularity of the &quot;vamp&quot; in 1920s cinema.

By the 1930s, the term &quot;gold digger&quot; had reached the United Kingdom through a British remake of &quot;The Gold Diggers&quot;. While the film received negative critical reception, several sequels with the same title have been produced.

In the 1930s, the gold digger trope was used in a number of popular American films, most notably &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, &quot;Gold Diggers of 1935&quot;, &quot;Baby Face&quot;, &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot;, &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;, and &quot;Havana Widows&quot;. Film historian Roger Dooley notes that the gold digger is one of the most common of the “stock company of stereotypes that continually reappear in the films of the 1930s.” Gold diggers in 1930s cinema were often portrayed in positive, sometimes heroic, ways. The character has featured in many films since the 1930s such as &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1953) and &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; (1953), both starring Marilyn Monroe, or as a villainous foil, as in both versions of Disney&#x27;s film &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;.

===Music===
The gold digger image or trope appears in several popular songs, including &quot;My Heart Belongs to Daddy&quot; (1938), &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend&quot; (1949), &quot;Santa Baby&quot; (1953), &quot;She Got the Goldmine (I Got The Shaft)&quot; (1982), and &quot;Material Girl&quot; (1984). Rap music&#x27;s use of the &quot;gold digger script&quot; is one of a few prevalent sexual scripts that is directed at young African-American women. The 2005 hit &quot;Gold Digger (Kanye West song)&quot; was the ninth best selling and ninth most played song of the 2000s, according to People Magazine.

<text>Geyserite, or siliceous sinter, is a form of opaline silica that is often found as crusts or layers around hot springs and geysers. Botryoidal geyserite is known as fiorite. Geyserite is porous due to the silica enclosing many small cavities. Siliceous sinter should not be confused with calcareous sinter, which is made of calcium carbonate.

In May 2017, evidence of the earliest known life on land may have been found in 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia.

<doc id="900702" wikidata="Q275593" url="?curid=900702" title="Bebe Buell">
<text>Beverle Lorence &quot;Bebe&quot; Buell ( ; born July 14, 1953) is an American singer and former model. She was &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s November 1974 Playmate of the Month. Buell moved to New York in 1972 after signing a modeling contract with Eileen Ford, and garnered notability after her publicized relationship with musician Todd Rundgren from 1972 until 1978, as well as her liaisons with several rock musicians during that time and over the following four decades. She is the mother of actress Liv Tyler (born 1977), whose biological father is Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler. Todd Rundgren is Liv&#x27;s legally adoptive father.

In 2001 Buell published her autobiography with St. Martin&#x27;s Press (with Victor Bockris), &quot;Rebel Heart: An American Rock and Roll Journey&quot;. The book was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. The paperback was issued in 2002.

==Early life==
Buell was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, the daughter of Dorothea (Brown) Johnson, who founded the Protocol School of Washington, and Harold Lloyd Buell, a U.S. Navy officer and World War II veteran. As her father was not at home at the time of Buell&#x27;s birth, her mother waited until he got back before naming her daughter. The nurses in the hospital took to calling her &quot;Baby Buell,&quot; which is where her nickname of &quot;Bebe&quot; originated. She is of German descent.

==Career==
===Modeling===
Buell was discovered by modeling agency executive Eileen Ford after high school graduation at age 17, and relocated to New York City at age 18. She was &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s Playmate of the Month for the November 1974 issue; her centerfold was photographed by Richard Fegley. Describing her early years and modeling career, Buell said, &quot;[I wanted] to be a professional singer [which was why] I came to New York—yes, I was a pretty young girl, so I fell into the modeling thing, and [then] I did &quot;Playboy&quot;, so then the rock stars came a-hunting, as I like to say.&quot;

===Music===

In 1981 Buell recorded a four-song EP on Rhino Records, produced by Rick Derringer and Ric Ocasek, with the Cars serving as her band on two tracks. The rock band the Power Station began in 1984 when her then-boyfriend John Taylor (of Duran Duran fame) pulled some famous friends together to provide backing for another of Buell&#x27;s musical efforts. She also formed the band the B-Sides in 1980; it disbanded in 1985.

In 1985 Buell started another band, The Gargoyles, and released a couple of singles. A few large record companies showed interest, but the Gargoyles disbanded when Liv Tyler&#x27;s paternity became public in 1991. Buell withdrew from performing for six years in the 1990s. She managed Liv&#x27;s career as an international model and actress. She also represented actress Charis Michelsen.

After Liv left home in 1997, Buell recorded a solo effort with producer Don Fleming, released in 2000. She also performed around New York with the Bebe Buell Band and later with Boston musicians The Rudds and the Neighborhoods&#x27; drummer Johnny Lynch, forming a new band for a few shows that also included her husband, James Wallerstein.

In May 2009 Buell released her first recording in ten years, the single &quot;Air Kisses for the Masses&quot;. She then recorded a 12-song album that can be downloaded on iTunes or Amazon MP3. Buell played a series of live shows in the New York City area to promote the single.

In September 2011 Buell released &quot;Hard Love&quot;, an aggressive rock album influenced by grunge and glam rock. It was produced by Wallerstein and Stephen DeAcutis. The 11-track record features original songs alongside covers of Gang of Four&#x27;s &quot;I Love a Man in Uniform&quot; and &quot;Baby Baby&quot; by the English punk rock band the Vibrators.

==Personal life==
Buell has dated many musicians, beginning with Paul Cowsill of the Cowsills when she was 15. She has dated Mick Jagger, Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Elvis Costello, Todd Rundgren, Jimmy Page, Duran Duran&#x27;s John Taylor, and Steven Tyler among others, but she rejects the label &quot;groupie&quot;.

From 1972 to 1978, Bebe Buell had a longterm, on and off, relationship with Todd Rundgren. In 1976, Buell became unexpectedly pregnant from a brief relationship with Steven Tyler. On July 1, 1977, Buell gave birth to future actress/model Liv Tyler, but Buell initially named her child Liv Rundgren and claimed that Todd Rundgren was the biological father to protect the child from Tyler&#x27;s drug addiction. Rundgren and Buell ended their romantic relationship shortly after Liv&#x27;s birth. At age 9, Liv found out that she was Steven Tyler&#x27;s biological daughter.

In 1992, Buell married for the first time. She wed sometime-musician and actor Coyote Shivers. They divorced in 1999 after a year-long separation. In 2002, she married musician Jim Wallerstein (aka Jim Walters) of Das Damen.

For his film &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, music journalist and filmmaker Cameron Crowe developed the &quot;band-aid&quot; character Penny Lane as a composite of a handful of girls he saw backstage in the late 1960s and early 1970s at concerts calling themselves the &quot;Flying Garter Girls&quot;. One girl who went by the nickname Penny Lane is real-life Pennie Lane Trumbull, born in Portland, Oregon, in 1954. Though they were not in the Flying Garter Girls group, various other women have been described as Crowe&#x27;s inspiration, for instance Pamela Des Barres and Buell. Buell partially inspired Crowe; he named a lead singer character Jeff Bebe.

Buell lived in New York and New Jersey before relocating to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2013.

<text>Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco (born 20 June 1970) is a member of the Alawi dynasty. He is the younger brother of King Mohammed VI and the youngest child of the late King Hassan II and his wife, Lalla Latifa. He is currently second in the line of succession to the Moroccan throne, after his nephew Crown Prince Moulay Hassan. 

==Early life and education==
Prince Moulay Rachid is the second son, fifth and youngest child of King Hassan II and his wife, Lalla Latifa Hammou. Prince Moulay Rachid has four older siblings, Princess Lalla Meryem, King Mohammed VI, Princess Lalla Asma and Princess Lalla Hasna.

After primary and secondary studies at the Royal College in Rabat and obtaining his Baccalauréat in June 1989, he entered Mohammed V University in this very city to start his higher studies in law. In May 1993, Prince Moulay Rachid obtained his Bachelor of Law (LL.B.) majoring in economic and social law. The same year the Prince received his License to Practice Law – Public Law. In 1994, he was promoted to the rank of Senior colonel of the Royal Navy. On 29 June 1995, the Prince completed his graduate studies and received a Master of Law (LL.M.) in Political Science. The Bosnia question was the subject of his research and the thesis that the Prince presented and supported publicly. In order to complete his training for his postgraduate education, in November 1993, the Prince started an internship with the United Nations in New York. On 21 June 1996, the Prince successfully completed the written and oral tests for his postgraduate education and received a postgraduate Degree in International Relations. 

In July 2000, he obtained the rank of Brigadier general of the Royal Navy. On 18 May 2001, the Prince presented his doctorate thesis on the Organisation of the Islamic Conference at the Université Montesquieu-Bordeaux IV, which merited a specific mention for the quality of his work.

== Crown prince (1999–2003) ==
In 1999, Moulay Rachid became crown prince following the death of his father and the enthronement of his brother King Mohammed VI. Analysts Nicolas Beau and Catherine Graciet argued that Moulay Rachid was better suited for the throne than his brother, expressing concern that Mohammed VI might not have adequate expertise to deal with militant Islamists. After the birth of his nephew Moulay Hassan in 2003, Moulay Rachid became second in the line of succession.

== Fouad Mourtada controversy==
On 5 February 2008, Fouad Mourtada was arrested on suspicion of stealing the identity of Moulay Rachid by creating a fake profile on Facebook as a joke. Although the prince did not seek to press charges, on 23 February, Fouad Mourtada was sentenced to three years in jail and fined 10,000 dirhams (~US$1,350). After local protests and international criticism, Fouad Mourtada was granted a royal pardon on 19 March 2008 just days before an appeal hearing.

== Activities ==

Moulay Rachid occasionally serves Morocco as a diplomat, representing his brother King Mohammed VI at foreign engagements. On 22 October 2019, he attended the enthronement ceremony of Emperor Naruhito of Japan. On 19 September 2022, Rachid attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.

On 7 November 2022, Rachid attended the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference that took place in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt.

On 20 December 2022, Moulay Rachid, along with King Mohammed VI and Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, received the members of the Moroccan national football team at the Royal Palace in Rabat, following their performance in the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

On 7 December 2024, Moulay Rachid attended the reopening of Notre-Dame de Paris, which underwent reconstruction following the 2019 fire.

== Personal life ==
On 15 June 2014 he married his second cousin Oum Kalthum Boufarès, who is daughter of Moulay El Mamoun Boufarès, former Minister of Interior, and paternal granddaughter of Lalla Khadija (a sister of Mohammed V). Their marriage was publicly celebrated in November at the Royal Palace of Rabat. His wife, henceforth &quot;Lalla&quot; Oum Kalthum, was granted the title of Princess and the status of Royal Highness by King Mohammed VI on 8 June 2017. Their first child, a son, Prince Moulay Ahmed was born on 23 June 2016. A second child, Prince Moulay Abdeslam, was born on 1 June 2022. As Moulay Rachid is second in line to the throne, his sons are respectively third and fourth in line.

On 14 October 2022, Moulay Rachid tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequently missed the state opening of parliament for that year.

<text>Hyperpolarization is the spin polarization of the atomic nuclei of a material in a magnetic field far beyond thermal equilibrium conditions determined by the Boltzmann distribution. It can be applied to gases such as and , and small molecules where the polarization levels can be enhanced by a factor of 104–105 above thermal equilibrium levels. Hyperpolarized noble gases are typically used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lungs.
Hyperpolarized small molecules are typically used for &quot;in vivo&quot; metabolic imaging. For example, a hyperpolarized metabolite can be injected into animals or patients and the metabolic conversion can be tracked in real-time. Other applications include determining the function of the neutron spin-structures by scattering polarized electrons from a very polarized target (3He), surface interaction studies, and neutron polarizing experiments.

==Spin-exchange optical pumping==

=== Introduction ===
Spin exchange optical pumping (SEOP) is one of several hyperpolarization techniques discussed on this page. This technique specializes in creating hyperpolarized (HP) noble gases, such as 3He, 129Xe, and quadrupolar 131Xe, 83Kr, and 21Ne. Noble gases are required because SEOP is performed in the gas phase, they are chemically inert, non-reactive, chemically stable with respect to alkali metals, and their T1 is long enough to build up polarization. Spin 1/2 noble gases meet all these requirements, and spin 3/2 noble gases do to an extent, although some spin 3/2 do not have a sufficient T1. Each of these noble gases has their own specific application, such as characterizing lung space and tissue via &quot;in vivo&quot; molecular imaging and functional imaging of lungs, to study changes in metabolism of healthy versus cancer cells, or use as targets for nuclear physics experiments. During this process, circularly polarized infrared laser light, tuned to the appropriate wavelength, is used to excite electrons in an alkali metal, such as caesium or rubidium inside a sealed glass vessel. Infrared light is necessary because it contains the wavelengths necessary to excite the alkali metal electrons, although the wavelength necessary to excite sodium electrons is below this region (Table 1).

The angular momentum is transferred from the alkali metal electrons to the noble gas nuclei through collisions. Nitrogen is used as a quenching gas, which prevents the fluorescence of the polarized alkali metal, which would lead to de-polarization of the noble gas. If fluorescence was not quenched, the light emitted during relaxation would be randomly polarized, working against the circularly polarized laser light. While different sizes of glass vessels (also called cells), and therefore different pressures, are used depending on the application, one amagat of total pressure of noble gas and nitrogen is sufficient for SEOP and 0.1 amagat of nitrogen density is needed to quench fluorescence. Great improvements in 129Xe hyperpolarization technology have achieved &gt; 50% level at flow rates of 1–2 L/min, which enables human clinical applications.

=== History ===
The discovery of SEOP took decades for all the pieces to fall into place to create a complete technique. First, in 1897, Zeeman&#x27;s studies of sodium vapor led to the first result of &quot;optical pumping&quot;. The next piece was found in 1950 when Kastler determined a method to electronically spin-polarize rubidium alkali metal vapor using an applied magnetic field and illuminating the vapor with resonant circularly polarized light. Ten years later, Marie-Anne Bouchiat, T. M. Carver, and C. M. Varnum performed &quot;spin exchange&quot;, in which the electronic spin polarization was transferred to nuclear spins of a noble gas (3He and 129Xe) through gas-phased collisions. Since then, this method has been greatly improved and expanded to use with other noble gases and alkali metals.

=== Theory ===

To explain the processes of excitation, optical pumping, and spin exchange easier, the most common alkali metal used for this process, rubidium, will be used as an example. Rubidium has an odd number of electrons, with only one in the outermost shell that can be excited under the right conditions. There are two transitions that can occur, one referred to as the D1 line where the transition occurs from the 52S1/2 state to the 52P1/2 state and another referred to the D2 line where the transition occurs from the 52S1/2 to the 52P3/2 state. The D1 and D2 transitions can occur if the rubidium atoms are illuminated with light at a wavelength of 794.7 nm and 780 nm, respectively (Figure 1). While it is possible to cause either excitation, laser technology is well-developed for causing the D1 transition to occur. Those lasers are said to be tuned to the D1 wavelength (794.7 nm) of rubidium.

In order to increase the polarization level above thermal equilibrium, the populations of the spin states must be altered. In the absence of magnetic field, the two spin states of a spin I = nuclei are in the same energy level, but in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels split into ms = ±1/2 energy levels (Figure 2). Here, ms is the spin angular momentum with possible values of +1/2 (spin up) or -1/2 (spin down), often drawn as vectors pointing up or down, respectively. The difference in population between these two energy levels is what produces an NMR signal. For example, the two electrons in the spin down state cancel two of the electrons in the spin up state, leaving only one spin up nucleus to be detected with NMR. However, the populations of these states can be altered via hyperpolarization, allowing the spin up energy level to be more populated and therefore increase the NMR signal. This is done by first optically pumping alkali metal, then transferring the polarization to a noble gas nucleus to increase the population of the spin up state.

The absorption of laser light by the alkali metal is the first process in SEOP. Left-circularly polarized light tuned to the D1 wavelength of the alkali metal excites the electrons from the spin down 2S1/2 (ms=-1/2) state into the spin up 2P1/2 (ms=+1/2) state, where collisional mixing then occurs as the noble gas atoms collide with the alkali metal atoms and the ms=-1/2 state is partially populated (Figure 3). Circularly polarized light is necessary at low magnetic fields because it allows only one type of angular momentum to be absorbed, allowing the spins to be polarized. Relaxation then occurs from the excited states (ms=±1/2) to the ground states (ms=±1/2) as the atoms collide with nitrogen, thus quenching any chance of fluorescence and causing the electrons to return to the two ground states in equal populations. Once the spins are depolarized (return to the ms=-1/2 state), they are excited again by the continuous wave laser light and the process repeats itself. In this way, a larger population of electron spins in the ms=+1/2 state accumulates. The polarization of the rubidium, PRb, can be calculated by using the formula below:

:formula_1

Where n↑ and n↓ and are the number of atoms in the spin up (mS=+1/2) and spin down (mS=-1/2) 2S1/2 states.

Next, the optically pumped alkali metal collides with the noble gas, allowing for spin exchange to occur where the alkali metal electron polarization is transferred to the noble gas nuclei (Figure 4). There are two mechanisms in which this can occur. The angular momentum can be transferred via binary collisions (Figure 4A, also called two-body collisions) or while the noble gas, N2 buffer gas, and vapor phase alkali metal are held in close proximity via van der Waals forces (Figure 4B, also called three body collisions). In cases where van der Waals forces are very small compared to binary collisions (such is the case for 3He), the noble gas and alkali metal collide and polarization is transferred from the AM to the noble gas. Binary collisions are also possible for 129Xe. At high pressures, van der Waals forces dominate, but at low pressures binary collisions dominate.

=== Buildup of polarization ===
This cycle of excitation, polarization, depolarization, and re-polarization, etc. takes time before a net polarization is achieved. The buildup of nuclear polarization, PN(t), is given by:

:formula_2

Where ⟨PA⟩ is the alkali metal polarization, γSE is the spin exchange rate, and Γ is the longitudinal relaxation rate of the noble gas. Relaxation of the nuclear polarization can occur via several mechanisms and is written as a sum of these contributions:

:formula_3

Where Γt, Γp, Γg, and Γw represent the relaxation from the transient Xe2 dimer, the persistent Xe2 dimer, diffusion through gradients in the applied magnetic field, and wall relaxation, respectively. In most cases, the largest contributors to the total relaxation are persistent dimers and wall relaxations. A Xe2 dimer can occur when two Xe atoms collide and are held together via van der Waals forces, and it can be broken when a third atom collides with it. It is similar to Xe-Rb during spin exchange (spin transfer) where they are held in close proximity to each other via van der Waals forces. Wall relaxation is when the hyperpolarized Xe collides with the walls of the cell and is de-polarized due to paramagnetic impurities in the glass.

The buildup time constant, ΓB, can be measured by collecting NMR spectra at time intervals falling within the time it takes to reach steady-state polarization (i.e. the maximum polarization that can be achieved, seen by the maximum signal output). The signal integrals are then plotted over time and can be fit to obtain the buildup time constant. Collecting a buildup curve at several different temperatures and plotting the values as a function of alkali metal vapor density (since vapor density increases with an increase in cell temperature) can be used to determine the spin destruction rate and the per-atom spin exchange rate using:

:formula_4

Where γ&#x27; is the per-atom spin exchange rate, [AM] is the alkali metal vapor density, and ΓSD is the spin destruction rate. This plot should be linear, where γ&#x27; is the slope and ΓSD is the y-intercept.

=== Relaxation: T1 ===
Spin exchange optical pumping can continue indefinitely with continuous illumination, but there are several factors that cause relaxation of polarization and thus a return to the thermal equilibrium populations when illumination is stopped. In order to use hyperpolarized noble gases in applications such as lung imaging, the gas must be transferred from the experimental setup to a patient. As soon as the gas is no longer actively being optically pumped, the degree of hyperpolarization begins to decrease until thermal equilibrium is reached. However, the hyperpolarization must last long enough to transfer the gas to the patient and obtain an image. The longitudinal spin relaxation time, denoted as T1, can be measured easily by collecting NMR spectra as the polarization decreases over time once illumination is stopped. This relaxation rate is governed by several depolarization mechanisms and is written as:

:formula_5

Where the three contributing terms are for collisional relaxation (CR), magnetic field inhomogeneity (MFI) relaxation, and relaxation caused by the presence of paramagnetic oxygen (O2). The T1 duration could be anywhere from minutes to several hours, depending on how much care is put into lessening the effects of CR, MFI, and O2. The last term has been quantified to be 0.360 s−1 amagat−1, but the first and second terms are hard to quantify since the degree of their contribution to the overall T1 is dependent on how well the experimental setup and cell are optimized and prepared.

=== Experimental setup in SEOP ===

In order to perform SEOP, it is first necessary to prepare the optical cell. Optical cells (Figure 5) are designed for the particular system in mind and glass blown using a transparent material, typically pyrex glass (borosilicate). This cell must then be cleaned to eliminate all contaminants, particularly paramagnetic materials which decrease polarization and the T1. The inner surface of the cell is then coated to (a) serve as a protective layer for the glass in order to lessen the chance of corrosion by the alkali metal, and (b) minimize depolarization caused by the collisions of polarized gas molecules with the walls of the cell. Decreasing wall relaxation leads to longer and higher polarization of the noble gas. 

While several coatings have been tested over the years, SurfaSil (Figure 6, now referred to as hydrocarbon soluble siliconizing fluid) is the most common coating used in a ratio of 1:10 SurfaSil: hexane because it provides long T1 values. The thickness of the SurfaSil layer is about 0.3-0.4 μm. Once evenly coated and dried, the cell is then placed in an inert environment and a droplet of alkali metal (≈200 mg) is placed in the cell, which is then dispersed to create an even coating on the walls of the cells. One method for transferring the alkali metal into the cell is by distillation. In the distillation method, the cell is connected to a glass manifold equipped to hold both pressurized gas and vacuum, where an ampoule of alkali metal is connected. The manifold and cell are vacuumed, then the ampoule seal is broken and the alkali metal is moved into the cell using the flame of a gas torch. The cell is then filled with the desired gas mixture of nitrogen and noble gas. Care must be taken not to poison the cell at any stage of cell preparation (expose the cell to atmospheric air).

Several cell sizes and designs have been used over the years. The application desired is what governs the design of the optical pumping cell and is dependent on laser diameter, optimization needs, and clinical use considerations. The specific alkali metal(s) and gases are also chosen based on the desired applications. 

Once the cell is complete, a surface coil (or coils, depending on the desired coil type) is taped to the outside of the cell, which a) allows RF pulses to be produced in order to tip the polarized spins into the detection field (x,y plane) and b) detects the signal produced by the polarized nuclear spins. The cell is placed in an oven which allows for the cell and its contents to be heated so the alkali metal enters the vapor phase, and the cell is centered in a coil system which generates an applied magnetic field (along the z-axis). A laser, tuned to the D1 line (electric-dipole transition) of the alkali metal and with a beam diameter matching the diameter of the optical cell, is then aligned with the optical flats of the cell in such a way where the entirety of the cell is illuminated by laser light to provide the largest polarization possible (Figure 7). The laser can be anywhere between tens of watts to hundreds of watts, where higher the power yields larger polarization but is more costly. In order to further increase polarization, a retro-reflective mirror is placed behind the cell in order to pass the laser light through the cell twice. Additionally, an IR iris is placed behind the mirror, providing information of laser light absorption by the alkali metal atoms. When the laser is illuminating the cell, but the cell is at room temperature, the IR iris is used to measure the percent transmittance of laser light through the cell. As the cell is heated, the rubidium enters the vapor phase and starts to absorb laser light, causing the percent transmittance to decrease. The difference in the IR spectrum between a room temperature spectrum and a spectrum taken while the cell is heated can be used to calculate an estimated rubidium polarization value, PRb.

As SEOP continues to develop and improve, there are several types of NMR coils, ovens, magnetic field generating coils, and lasers that have been and are being used to generate hyperpolarized gases. Generally, the NMR coils are hand made for the specific purpose, either by turning copper wire by hand in the desired shape, or by 3D printing the coil. Commonly, the oven is a forced-air oven, with two faces made of glass for the laser light to pass through the cell, a removable lid, and a hole through which a hot air line is connected, which allows the cell to be heated via conduction. The magnetic field generating coils can be a pair of Helmholtz coils, used to generate the desired magnetic field strength, whose desired field is governed by:

:formula_6

Where ω is the Larmour frequency, or desired detection frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nuclei of interest, and B0 is the magnetic field required to detect the nuclei at the desired frequency. A set of four electromagnetic coils can also be used (i.e. from Acutran) and other coil designs are being tested.

In the past, laser technology was a limiting factor for SEOP, where only a couple alkali metals could be used due to the lack of, for example, cesium lasers. However, there have been several new developments, including better cesium lasers, higher power, narrower spectral width, etc. which are allowing the reaches of SEOP to increase. Nevertheless, there are several key features required. Ideally, the laser should be continuous wave to ensure the alkali metal and noble gas remains polarized at all times. In order to induce this polarization, the laser light must be circularly polarized in the direction which allows the electrons to become spin polarized. This is done by passing the laser light through a polarizing beam splitter to separate the &quot;s&quot; and &quot; p&quot; components, then through a quarter wave plate, which converts the linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light.

=== Noble gases and alkali metals ===
SEOP has successfully been used and is fairly well developed for 3He, 129Xe, and 83Kr for biomedical applications. Additionally, several improvements are under way to get enhanced and interpretable imaging of cancer cells in biomedical science. Studies involving hyperpolarization of 131Xe are underway, piquing the interest of physicists. There are also improvements being made to allow not only rubidium to be utilized in the spin transfer, but also cesium. In principle, any alkali metal can be used for SEOP, but rubidium is usually preferred due to its high vapor pressure, allowing experiments to be carried out at relatively low temperatures (80 °C-130 °C), decreasing the chance of damaging the glass cell. Additionally, laser technology for the alkali metal of choice has to exist and be developed enough get substantial polarization. Previously, the lasers available to excite the D1 cesium transition were not well-developed, but they are now becoming more powerful and less expensive. Preliminary studies even show that cesium may provide better results than rubidium, even though rubidium has been the go-to alkali metal of choice for SEOP.

The hyperpolarization method called spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP) is being used to hyperpolarize noble gases such as Xenon-129 and Helium-3. When an inhaled hyperpolarized gas like 3He or 129Xe is imaged, there is a higher magnetization density of NMR-active molecules in the lung compared to traditional 1H imaging, which improves the MRI images that can be obtained. Unlike proton MRI which reports on anatomical features of lung tissues, XenonMRI reports lung function including gas ventilation, diffusion, and perfusion.

==== Rationale ====
Our target is to identify the infection or disease (cancer, for example) anywhere in our body like cerebral, brain, blood, and fluid, and tissues. This infectious cell is called collectively biomarker. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and collaborating with United Nations and International Labor organization have convincingly defined the Biomarker as &quot;any substance, structure, or process that can be measured in the body or its products and influence or predict the incidence of outcome or disease&quot;. Biomarker has to be quantifiable up-to certain level in biological process in well-being.

One specific example of biomarker is blood cholesterol that is commonly acquainted with us reliable for coronary heart disease; another biomarker is PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) and has been contributing to prostate cancer. There are a lot of biomarkers are considering as being cancer: Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA), International Normalized Ratio (INR), Prothrombin Time (PT), Monoclonal Protein (M protein), Cancer Antigen-125 (CA-125), Human Immunodeficiency Virus -Ribonucleic Acid (HIV RNA), B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP).27and Lymphoma cell (Ramos cell lines and Jurkat cell lines) a form of cancer.

Other common biomarkers are breast cancer, Ovarian cancer, Colorectal cancer, Lung cancer and brain tumor.

This disease-causing verdict agent is the biomarker is existing extremely trace amount especially initial state of the disease. Therefore, identifying or getting images of biomarker is tricky and, in few circumstances, uncertain by NMR tech. Hence, we must use the contrasting agent to enhance the images at least to visualize level to Physicians. As molecules of biomarker is less abundant &quot;in vivo&quot; system. The NMR or MRI experiment provides a very small signal even in some cases, the analyzer can miss the signal peak in data due to the lack in abundance of biomarkers. Therefore, to make sure, to reach the true conclusion about the existence of trouble-causing biomarkers, we need to enhance the probe (contrasting mechanisms) to get the clear peak at the most visible level of peak height as well as the position of the peak in data. If it is possible to gather the acceptable and clearly interpretable data from NMR or MRI experiment by using the contrasting agent, then experts can take a right initial step to recover the patients who already have been suffering from cancer. Among the various technique to get the enhanced data in MRI experiment, SEOP is one of them.

Researchers in SEOP are interested to use the 129Xe. Because 129Xe has a number of favorable facts in NMR Tech. for working as a contrasting agent even over the other novel gases:

* Inert xenon does not show chemical reaction like other metals and non-metals because Xenon&#x27;s electronic configuration is fully occupied as well as it is not radioactive also.
* To get the solid, liquid state from naturally occurring gaseous state is easy going (figure-8). The solid and liquid state of 129Xe are existing experimentally doable temperature and pressure ranges.
* Xenon possesses highly polarizable electron cloud surrounding the nucleus. Therefore, easily prone to be soluble with lipid or organic compounds especially &quot;in vivo&quot; environment in biological respect. (table-2)
* Xenon does not alter the structurally or chemically (similarly other noble gases) when interacting with other molecules.
* According to the scientist Ostwald, solubility is defined as the partition coefficient of the gas absorbed to the volume of the absorbing liquid. The solubility of Xenon, SXe(g) = V absorbed amount of Xe(g) /V absorbing liquid at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

Solubility of Xenon in water medium 11% means at 25 °C 11 mL Xenon gas could be absorbed by 100 mL of water.
* Xenon atomic size is large and outer shell electrons are far from the nuclei, outermost electron is highly prone to be polarized specially lipid environment. Table 2 shows Xenon solubility in water medium at 37 °C is 8% but fat tissue &quot;in vivo&quot; environment the solubility value is 130%. Solubility leads the Xenon using in biological system as a contrasting agent.
* Solvent effect of xenon is very large for of 129Xenon by the fact of solubility (table 2). Chemical shift value range for Xenon is more than 7500 ppm. However solvent effect is limited range for 1H &amp; 13C (MRI active nuclei) because of low chemical shift value range for 1H is 20 ppm and for 13C is 300 ppm. Therefore, using the 129Xe is preferred.

Figure-9 below, In NMR experimental data, there are different chemical shift values for different tissues in &quot;in vivo&quot; environment. All peaks are positioned through such a big range of chemical shift values for 129Xe is viable. Because 129Xe has long range up-to 1700ppm chemical shift value range in NMR data. Other important spectral information includes:

 Figure 9. NMR data for Xe-129 biosensor in &quot;in vivo&quot; biological system.

* Naturally 129Xe NMR peak has been counted as reference at 0.0ppm.
* When 129Xe incorporated and bind with the Cryptophane-A molecule, then the chemical shift value in NMR acquisition shifted to around 70ppm.
* If hyperpolarized 129Xe gas is dissolved into the brain, then five NMR spectral peaks can be observed.
* Among them top sharp peak at 194.7ppm. In addition, at 189 ppm peak come out from the non-brain tissues.
* Another two peaks are still unknown at 191.6 ppm and 197.8 ppm. At 209.5 ppm smaller but broad peak has been found in NMR data when 129Xe was dissolved in the blood stream.
* Hyperpolarized 129Xe is very sensitive detector of biomarker (form of cancer in living system).
* The nuclear spin polarization of 129Xe or in generally for noble gases we can increase up to fivefold via SEOP technique.
*Using SEOP hyperpolarization technique, we can get images of uptake of xenon in the human brain tissue.
(Figure-10)
129Xe(g) shows satisfactory enhancement in polarization during SEOP compared to the thermal enhancement in polarization. This is demonstrated by the experimental data values when NMR spectra are acquired at different magnetic field strengths. A couple of important points from experimental data are:

* The 129Xe polarization has increased about 144,000-fold in SEOP tech. over thermally enhanced for 1H polarization in NMR experiment. Both experiments that showed this have been done in identical conditions and using same radio frequency during NMR experiment.
* A similar value of 140,000-fold signal enhancement for 129Xe hyperpolarization in SEOP compare to the reference thermally enhanced 13C NMR signal is also seen in experimental NMR data. Both data have been collected in identical Larmor frequency and other experimental conditions and same radio frequency during NMR data collection.

(Figure 11) Longitudinal spin relaxation time (T1) is very sensitive with an increase of magnetic field and hence enhance the NMR signals is noticeable in SEOP in case of 129Xe. As T1 is higher for blue marking conditioning NMR experiment shows more enhanced peak compare to other. For hyperpolarized 129Xe in tedlar bags, the T1 is 38±12 minutes when data collected in presence of 1.5 mT magnetic field. However, satisfactory increment in T1delay time (354±24 minutes) when data was collected in presence of 3000 mT magnetic field.

==== Use of Rb vs. Cs in SEOP NMR experiments ====
In general, we can use the either 87Rb or 133Cs alkali metal atoms with inert nitrogen gas. However, we are using 133Cs atoms with nitrogen to make the spin exchange with 129Xe for number of advantages:

* 133Cs has natural perfect abundance while rubidium has two (85Rb and 87Rb) isotopes. Abstraction of one isotope separately from these two (85Rb and 87Rb) is difficult compare to collect the 133Cs isotope. Abstraction of 133Cs is convenient.
* Optical pumping cell normally is operated at lower temperature to avoid chemically breakdown issue. SEOP is using 133Cs at low temperature and hence it has fewer chemical corrosion with SEOP cell wall glass.
* 133Cs-129Xe couple have spin exchange rate about 10% that is more compare to the 87Rb-129Xe couple have.

Although 129Xe has a bunch of preferable characteristic applications in NMR technique, 83Kr can also be used since it has a lot of advantages in NMR techniques in different ways than 129Xe.

* 83Kr stable isotope has spin &quot;I=&quot;9/2 and has larger Van der Waals size 2.02A0. It has quadrupolar effect can be diffuse to nearby environment shortly &amp; distinctively (polar to nonpolar media &quot;in vivo&quot; system).
* Chemical composition of materials can influence the longitudinal relaxation of hyperpolarized 83Kr.
* The relaxation can distinguish among the hydrophobic and hydrophilic substrate. Although 3He and 129Xe have spin half but they are not quadrupolar active.
* However, the 21Ne (&quot;I=3/2)&quot;, 83Kr(&quot;I=9/2) and&quot; 131Xe (&quot;I=3/2)&quot; have Quadrupolar moment.34 Quadrupolar interactions make these isotopes having spin relaxation.
* Due to this spin relaxation and evolution, these isotopes can be used as contrasting agents to say about the probe can determine the structural feature and chemical compositions of the surfaces for a permeable media.
* SEOP can calculate the relaxation of spin T1 by using the equation nonlinear least-squares fitting for 83Kr signal as a function of time as well as experimental number of media flip angle (≈12°) for NMR experimenting radio frequency pulses.
* Hyperpolarized 83Kr is being separated from 87Rb gases after spin exchanging in the optical pumping process and then used in variety of &quot;in vivo&quot; system to get MRI signal. This is the first isotope showed lots of applicability for MRI technique even though has the spin is .
* During experiment of canine lung tissue, the using magnet was 9.4 T, media was porous and similar porosity to alveolar dimensions which is disseminated at atmospheric pressure. Spin lattice relaxation was reasonably long enough so it is applicable &quot;in vivo&quot; system although the oxygen level could be 20%.
* As 83Kr contrasting agent is promising to develop pristine &quot;in vivo&quot; MRI methodology to identify the lung diseases epically those effect have been caused in parenchyma surface due to the surfactant concentration.
* Boyed the boundary this particular contrasting agent can work to figure out the size of pour of porous media in materials science.
* In addition, this technique can take us about to prepare the surface coating, spatial fluctuations of surfaces. Eventually, never ending the good sign of this contrasting agent like natural abundance (11.5% of 83Kr) makes it easy to get with reasonable price $5/L.

=== Imaging applications of SEOP ===
Steps are also being taken in academia and industry to use this hyperpolarized gas for lung imaging. Once the gas (129Xe) is hyperpolarized through the SEOP process and the alkali metal is removed, a patient (either healthy or suffering from a lung disease), can breathe in the gas and an MRI can be taken. This results in an image of the spaces in the lungs filled with the gas. While the process to get to the point of imaging the patient may require knowledge from scientists very familiar with this technique and the equipment, steps are being taken to eliminate the need for this knowledge so that a hospital technician would be able to produce the hyperpolarized gas using a polarizer.

Hyperpolarization machines are currently being used to develop hyperpolarized xenon gas that is used as a visualization agent for the lungs. Xenon-129 is a safe inert noble gas that can be used to quantify lung function. With a single 10-second breath hold, hyperpolarized Xenon-129 is used with MRI to enable 3-dimensional lung imaging. Xenon MRI is being used to monitor patients with pulmonary-vascular, obstructive, or fibrotic lung disease.

Temperature-ramped 129Xe SEOP in an automated high-output batch model hyperpolarized 129Xe can utilize three prime temperature range to put certain conditions: First, 129Xe hyperpolarization rate is superlative high at hot condition. Second, in warm condition the hyperpolarization of 129Xe is unity. Third, at cold condition, the level of hyperpolarization of 129Xe gas at least can get the (at human body&#x27;s temperature) imaging although during the transferring into the Tedlar bag having poor percentage of 87Rb (less than 5 ng/L dose).

Multiparameter analysis of 87Rb/129Xe SEOP at high xenon pressure and photon flux could be used as 3D-printing and stopped flow contrasting agent in clinical scale. In &quot;situ&quot; technique, the NMR machine was run for tracking the dynamics of 129Xe polarization as a function of SEOP-cell conditioning with different operating parameters such as data collecting temperature, photon flux, and 129Xe partial pressure to enhance the 129Xe polarization (&quot;P&quot;Xe).

All of those polarization values of 129Xe has been approved by pushing the hyperpolarized 129Xe gas and all MRI experiment also done at lower magnetic field 47.5 mT. Finally demonstrations indicated that such a high pressure region, polarization of 129Xe gases could be increment even more that the limit that already has been shown. Better SEOP thermal management and optimizing the polarizing kinetics has been further improved with good efficacy.

=== SEOP on solids ===
Not only can SEOP be used to hyperpolarize noble gases, but a more recent development is SEOP on solids. It was first performed in 2007 and was used to polarize nuclei in a solid, allowing for nuclei that cannot be polarized by other methods to become hyperpolarized. For example, nuclear polarization of 133Cs in the form of a solid film of CsH can be increased above the Boltzmann limit. This is done by first optically pumping cesium vapor, then transferring the spin polarization to CsH salt, yielding an enhancement of 4.0.

The cells are made as previously described using distillation, then filled with hydrogen gas and heated to allow for the Cs metal to react with the gaseous hydrogen to form the CsH salt. Unreacted hydrogen was removed, and the process was repeated several times to increase the thickness of the CsH film, then pressurized with nitrogen gas. Usually, SEOP experiments are done with the cell centered in Helmholtz or electromagnetic coils, as previously described, but these experiments were done in a superconducting 9.4 T magnet by shining the laser through the magnet and electrically heating the cell. In the future, it may be possible to use this technique to transfer polarization to 6Li or 7Li, leading to even more applications since the T1 is expected to be longer.
Since the discovery of this technique that allows solids to be characterized, it has been improved in such a way where polarized light is not necessary to polarize the solid; instead, unpolarized light in a magnetic field can be used. In this method, glass wool is coated with CsH salt, increasing the surface area of the CsH and therefore increasing the chances of spin transfer, yielding 80-fold enhancements at low field (0.56 T). Like in hyperpolarizing CsH film, the cesium metal in this glass wool method was allowed to react with hydrogen gas, but in this case the CsH formed on the glass fibers instead of the glass cell.

==Metastability exchange optical pumping==
3He can also be hyperpolarized using metastability exchange optical pumping (MEOP). This process is able to polarize 3He nuclei in the ground state with optically pumped 3He nuclei in the metastable state. MEOP only involves 3He nuclei at room temperature and at low pressure (≈a few mbars). The process of MEOP is very efficient (high polarization rate), however, compression of the gas up to atmospheric pressure is needed.

==Dynamic nuclear polarization==
Compounds containing NMR-sensitive nuclei, such as 1H, 13C or 15N, can be hyperpolarized using Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). DNP is typically performed at low temperature (≈1 K) and high magnetic field (≈3 T). The compound is subsequently thawed and dissolved to yield a room temperature solution containing hyperpolarized nuclei. This liquid can be used in &quot;in vivo&quot; metabolic imaging for oncology and other applications. The 13C polarization levels in solid compounds can reach up to ≈64% and the losses during dissolution and transfer of the sample for NMR measurements can be minimized to a few percent. Compounds containing NMR-active nuclei can also be hyperpolarized using chemical reactions with para-hydrogen, see Para-Hydrogen Induced Polarization (PHIP).

==Parahydrogen induced polarization==

Molecular hydrogen, H2, contains two different spin isomers, para-hydrogen and ortho-hydrogen, with a ratio of 25:75 at room temperature. Creating para-hydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) means that this ratio is increased, in other words that para-hydrogen is enriched. This can be accomplished by cooling hydrogen gas and then inducing ortho-to-para conversion via an iron-oxide or charcoal catalyst. When performing this procedure at ≈70 K (i.e. with liquid nitrogen), para-hydrogen is enriched from 25% to ca. 50%. When cooling to below 20 K and then inducing the ortho-to-para conversion, close to 100% parahydrogen can be obtained.

For practical applications, the PHIP is most commonly transferred to organic molecules by reacting the hyperpolarized hydrogen with precursor molecules in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. Proton NMR signals with ca. 10,000-fold increased intensity can be obtained compared to NMR signals of the same organic molecule without PHIP and thus only &quot;thermal&quot; polarization at room temperature.

==Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE)==
Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) is a technique to hyperpolarize samples without chemically modifying them. Compared to orthohydrogen or organic molecules, a much greater fraction of the hydrogen nuclei in parahydrogen align with an applied magnetic field. In SABRE, a metal center reversibly binds to both the test molecule and a parahydrogen molecule facilitating the target molecule to pick up the polarization of the parahydrogen. This technique can be improved and utilized for a wide range of organic molecules by using an intermediate &quot;relay&quot; molecule like ammonia. The ammonia efficiently binds to the metal center and picks up the polarization from the parahydrogen. The ammonia then transfers it other molecules that don&#x27;t bind as well to the metal catalyst. This enhanced NMR signal allows the rapid analysis of very small amounts of material.

<text>Samuel Augustus Maverick Jr. (1837–1936) was a Texas soldier and businessman, born May 14, 1837, at Montpelier Plantation, near Pendleton, South Carolina, the first-born of Samuel Augustus Maverick and Mary Ann Adams. His parents brought him to Texas in June 1838 and he grew up in San Antonio during the Republic. In two volumes of memoirs, he recounted his memories of the Council House Fight in 1840 (in which the family&#x27;s cook saved his life), the evacuation of the city during the incursion by Gen. Rafael Vásquez in 1842, and his father&#x27;s return from the prison at Perote, Veracruz, in 1843.

Maverick&#x27;s early education was provided by tutors, and he later attended several local private schools. In 1856, he traveled to Scotland to attend the University of Edinburgh, from which he graduated, probably in 1859.

At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Maverick enlisted in Company B of the First Texas Mounted Rifles under Col. Henry E. McCulloch, but the unit saw insufficient action to satisfy him. In May 1862, he joined Company G of the 8th Texas Infantry, commanded by Col. Benjamin F. Terry and known as Terry&#x27;s Texas Rangers, with whom he saw action throughout the South. At Fort Donelson, Tennessee, he swam the Cumberland River and set fire to a Union gunboat, for which feat he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant.

After the war, Maverick returned to San Antonio, where he farmed on the land that now makes up Brackenridge Park, north of downtown. In 1867, he passed the state bar examination. He subsequently ran a series of businesses, including a lumberyard and several stores. In 1884 he built the Maverick Bank at the corner of East Houston Street and Alamo Plaza, but the bank failed in 1892. He retired from active business in 1906.

He was long involved in preservation efforts at the Alamo, and in 1888, he contributed $10,000 toward the construction of the Alamo Monument. In 1889, he escorted the Belknap Rifles, a local volunteer military company, to New York to participate in the centennial of the founding of Manhattan. He also donated land to San Antonio which was named Maverick Park in his honor.

Samuel Maverick married Sallie Frost on May 14, 1871 in San Antonio and they had several children. He died in Austin February 27, 1936, at the age of ninety-eight, the last survivor of Terry&#x27;s Texas Rangers, and was buried at Mission Burial Park in San Antonio.

<doc id="900730" wikidata="Q1554083" url="?curid=900730" title="Guillotine (game)">
<text>Guillotine is a card game created by Wizards of the Coast and designed by Paul Peterson. The game is set during the French Revolution, and was released on Bastille Day in 1998. The goal is to collect the heads of Nobles, accumulating points. Despite the grim topic of the game, the artwork is comical and the tone light.

==Overview==
Game play, for two to five players, takes approximately 30 minutes. Game equipment consists of two decks of cards, &quot;Nobles&quot; and &quot;Actions&quot;, and a small cardboard structure representing the guillotine itself. This is mostly symbolic, though it can serve as a convenient indicator of the direction of the &quot;line&quot; of face-up Noble cards played on the game table representing condemned persons waiting to be beheaded. The Nobles cards carry points values and are collected by players after execution, while Action cards allow the player to perform various acts including rearranging the order of Nobles approaching the guillotine, stealing Nobles or Action cards from other players, enhancing the point values of certain categories of Nobles (see &quot;Noble Types&quot; below) and so forth.

==Gameplay==
The game is divided into three rounds or &quot;days&quot;. Each day, twelve noble cards are dealt face-up in a row to be executed. A player&#x27;s turn consists of:

# Playing an Action card. This is optional.
# Collecting the Noble card at the front of the line.
# Drawing an Action card from the deck.

==Noble types==
The Nobles come in five categories, each with its own color border:
* Church (blue)
* Military (red)
* Royal (purple)
* Negative (grey)
* Civic (green)

Grey nobles, typically martyrs that have public sympathy, are worth negative points so the player&#x27;s goal is to avoid collecting them if possible. Palace guards, in the red category, have a special value in that each guard is worth the total number of guards collected. Thus one guard is worth one point, two guards are worth four points, three guards are worth nine points and so forth. The other Nobles have values ranging from 1 to 5 points.

A typical turn example is a player using an Action card to move a Noble two places forward in the line, i.e. advance a high-point Noble from third position to first, collecting that Noble, then drawing another Action card to end the turn. Other Action cards allow the player to move a Noble one or more places backward, useful for moving a low- or negative-value card off the front of the line to collect a higher-value second-position Noble.

Certain Noble cards affect the game, including a &quot;Fast Noble&quot; requiring the player who collects it to also take the next Noble in line. A card symbolizing Maximilien Robespierre (beheaded in 1794) causes the &quot;day&quot; to instantly end upon his decapitation. At the end of a &quot;day&quot; of gameplay (either by the collection of the Robespierre card or the exhaustion of the line), a new line of Nobles is dealt face-up and play resumes. After three &quot;days&quot;, the player with the highest point total wins.

==Strategy==
The key to winning the game is to manage which Nobles one collects through careful use of action cards while forcing other players to collect low- or negative-scoring Nobles. Some Action cards allow a player to prolong the &quot;day&quot; (by adding new Nobles to the line), shorten it by allowing Nobles to &quot;escape,&quot; or end it, by playing the &quot;Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; action card.

==Availability==
After several years of &quot;Guillotine&quot; being out of print, Wizards re-released the game in 2005 alongside &quot;The Great Dalmuti&quot;, another Wizards card game.

In addition to being reprinted, &quot;Guillotine&quot; was featured as one of the playable games in Gleemax Games Alpha on the Gleemax website. 

==Reception==
The reviewer from the online second volume of &quot;Pyramid&quot; stated that &quot;Take France in the late 1700s. Add a large helping of various and sundry mostly useless nobility. Stir in a group of disaffected common citizens with no real political power. Then toss in a pinch of Professor Guillotine and agitate vigorously. Garnish with extremely amusing art and you have &quot;Guillotine&quot;, the hilarious new card game from Wizards of the Coast about trying to get a head.&quot; A review from &quot;Lautapeliopas&quot; praised the entertainment value, ease of play, and theme while criticising the components and omissions in the game&#x27;s rules.

&quot;Guillotine&quot; won the 1998 Origins Award for &quot;Best Traditional Card Game&quot;.

<doc id="900732" wikidata="Q412212" url="?curid=900732" title="Thromboxane">
<text>Thromboxane is a member of the family of lipids known as eicosanoids. The two major thromboxanes are thromboxane A2 and thromboxane B2. The distinguishing feature of thromboxanes is a 6-membered ether-containing ring.

Thromboxane is named for its role in blood clot formation (thrombosis).

==Production==
Thromboxane-A synthase, an enzyme found in platelets, converts the arachidonic acid derivative prostaglandin H2 to thromboxane.

People with asthma tend to have increased thromboxane production, and analogs of thromboxane act as bronchoconstrictors in patients with asthma.

==Mechanism==
Thromboxane acts by binding to any of the thromboxane receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors coupled to the G protein Gq.

==Functions==
Thromboxane is a vasoconstrictor and a potent hypertensive agent, and it facilitates platelet aggregation.

It is in homeostatic balance in the circulatory system with prostacyclin, a related compound.
The mechanism of secretion of thromboxanes from platelets is still unclear.
They act in the formation of blood clots and reduce blood flow to the site of a clot.

If the cap of a vulnerable plaque erodes or ruptures, as in myocardial infarction, platelets stick to the damaged lining of the vessel and to each other within seconds and form a plug. These &quot;Sticky platelets&quot; secrete several chemicals, including thromboxane A2 that stimulate vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow at the site.

==Role of A2 in platelet aggregation==
Thromboxane A2 (TXA2), produced by activated platelets, has prothrombotic properties, stimulating activation of new platelets as well as increasing platelet aggregation.

Platelet aggregation is achieved by mediating expression of the glycoprotein complex GP IIb/IIIa in the cell membrane of platelets. Circulating fibrinogen binds these receptors on adjacent platelets, further strengthening the clot.

==Pathology==
It is believed that the vasoconstriction caused by thromboxanes plays a role in Prinzmetal&#x27;s angina. Omega-3 fatty acids are metabolized to produce higher levels of TxA3, which is relatively less potent than TxA2 and PGI3; therefore, there is a balance shift toward inhibition of vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. It is believed that this shift in balance lowers the incidence of myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke.
Vasoconstriction and, perhaps, various proinflammatory effects exerted by TxA on tissue microvasculature, is probable reason why the TxA is pathogenic in various diseases, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury., hepatic inflammatory processes, acute hepatotoxicity etc. TxB2, a stable degradation product of TxA2, plays a role in acute hepatoxicity induced by acetaminophen.

==Thromboxane inhibitors==

Thromboxane inhibitors are broadly classified as either those that inhibit the synthesis of thromboxane, or those that inhibit the target effect of it.

Thromboxane synthesis inhibitors, in turn, can be classified regarding which step in the synthesis they inhibit:
*The widely used drug aspirin acts by inhibiting the ability of the COX enzyme to synthesize the precursors of thromboxane within platelets. Low-dose, long-term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. This anticoagulant property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks. 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.
*Thromboxane synthase inhibitors inhibit the final enzyme (thromboxane synthase) in the synthesis of thromboxane. Ifetroban is a potent and selective thromboxane receptor antagonist. Dipyridamole antagonizes this receptor too, but has various other mechanisms of antiplatelet activity as well.
*High-dose naproxen can induce near-complete suppression of platelet thromboxane throughout the dosing interval and appears not to increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, whereas other high-dose NSAID (non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory) regimens have only transient effects on platelet COX-1 and have been found to be associated &quot;with a small but definite vascular hazard&quot;.

The inhibitors of the target effects of thromboxane are the thromboxane receptor antagonist, including terutroban.

Picotamide has activity both as a thromboxane synthase inhibitor and as a thromboxane receptor antagonist.

Ridogrel is another example.

<doc id="900733" wikidata="Q1754650" url="?curid=900733" title="Plasma oscillation">
<text>Plasma oscillations, also known as Langmuir waves (after Irving Langmuir), are rapid oscillations of the electron density in conducting media such as plasmas or metals in the ultraviolet region. The oscillations can be described as an instability in the dielectric function of a free electron gas. The frequency depends only weakly on the wavelength of the oscillation. The quasiparticle resulting from the quantization of these oscillations is the &quot;plasmon&quot;.

Langmuir waves were discovered by American physicists Irving Langmuir and Lewi Tonks in the 1920s. They are parallel in form to Jeans instability waves, which are caused by gravitational instabilities in a static medium.

== Mechanism ==

Consider an electrically neutral plasma in equilibrium, consisting of a gas of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. If one displaces by a tiny amount an electron or a group of electrons with respect to the ions, the Coulomb force pulls the electrons back, acting as a restoring force.

=== &#x27;Cold&#x27; electrons ===

If the thermal motion of the electrons is ignored, it is possible to show that the charge density oscillates at the &quot;plasma frequency&quot;
: formula_1 (SI units),
:formula_2 (cgs units),

where formula_3 is the number density of electrons, formula_4 is the electric charge, formula_5 is the effective mass of the electron, and formula_6 is the permittivity of free space. Note that the above formula is derived under the approximation that the ion mass is infinite. This is generally a good approximation, as the electrons are so much lighter than ions.

Proof using Maxwell equations. Assuming charge density oscillations formula_7 the continuity equation:
formula_8
the Gauss law
formula_9
and the conductivity
formula_10
taking the divergence on both sides and substituting the above relations:
formula_11
which is always true only if
formula_12
But this is also the dielectric constant (see Drude Model)
formula_13
and the condition of transparency (i.e. formula_14 from a certain plasma frequency formula_15 and above), the same condition here formula_16 apply to make possible also the propagation of density waves in the charge density.

This expression must be modified in the case of electron-positron plasmas, often encountered in astrophysics. Since the frequency is independent of the wavelength, these oscillations have an infinite phase velocity and zero group velocity.

Note that, when formula_17, the plasma frequency, formula_18, depends only on physical constants and electron density formula_3. The numeric expression for angular plasma frequency is
formula_20

Metals are only transparent to light with a frequency higher than the metal&#x27;s plasma frequency. For typical metals such as aluminium or silver, formula_3 is approximately 1023 cm−3, which brings the plasma frequency into the ultraviolet region. This is why most metals reflect visible light and appear shiny.

=== &#x27;Warm&#x27; electrons ===

When the effects of the electron thermal speed formula_22 are considered, the electron pressure acts as a restoring force, and the electric field and oscillations propagate with frequency and wavenumber related by the longitudinal Langmuir wave:
formula_23
called the Bohm–Gross dispersion relation. If the spatial scale is large compared to the Debye length, the oscillations are only weakly modified by the pressure term, but at small scales the pressure term dominates and the waves become dispersionless with a speed of formula_24. For such waves, however, the electron thermal speed is comparable to the phase velocity, i.e., 
formula_25
so the plasma waves can accelerate electrons that are moving with speed nearly equal to the phase velocity of the wave. This process often leads to a form of collisionless damping, called Landau damping. Consequently, the large-&quot;k&quot; portion in the dispersion relation is difficult to observe and seldom of consequence.

In a bounded plasma, fringing electric fields can result in propagation of plasma oscillations, even when the electrons are cold.

In a metal or semiconductor, the effect of the ions&#x27; periodic potential must be taken into account. This is usually done by using the electrons&#x27; effective mass in place of &quot;m&quot;.

=== Plasma oscillations and the effect of the negative mass ===

Plasma oscillations may give rise to the effect of the “negative mass”. The mechanical model giving rise to the negative effective mass effect is depicted in Figure 1. A core with mass formula_26 is connected internally through the spring with constant formula_27 to a shell with mass formula_28. The system is subjected to the external sinusoidal force formula_29. If we solve the equations of motion for the masses formula_28 and formula_26 and replace the entire system with a single effective mass formula_32 we obtain:
formula_33
where formula_34. When the frequency formula_35 approaches formula_36 from above the effective mass formula_32 will be negative.

The negative effective mass (density) becomes also possible based on the electro-mechanical coupling exploiting plasma oscillations of a free electron gas (see Figure 2). The negative mass appears as a result of vibration of a metallic particle with a frequency of formula_35 which is close the frequency of the plasma oscillations of the electron gas formula_26 relatively to the ionic lattice formula_28. The plasma oscillations are represented with the elastic spring formula_41, where formula_15 is the plasma frequency. Thus, the metallic particle vibrated with the external frequency &quot;ω&quot; is described by the effective mass
formula_43
which is negative when the frequency formula_35 approaches formula_15 from above. Metamaterials exploiting the effect of the negative mass in the vicinity of the plasma frequency were reported.

<doc id="900737" wikidata="Q244232" url="?curid=900737" title="Tabuk, Saudi Arabia">
<text>Tabuk ( &quot;&quot;, ) is the capital city of the Tabuk Region in northwestern Saudi Arabia. It has a population of 594,350 (as of 2022). It is close to the Jordan–Saudi Arabia border and houses the largest air force base in Saudi Arabia.

== History ==
Ptolemy mentioned a place by the name &#x27;Tabawa&#x27;, at the northwestern corner of Arabia. This name may be a reference to &#x27;Tabuka&#x27; or &#x27;Tabuk&#x27;. If this is true, the town may be as old as Ptolemy&#x27;s time. Pre-Islamic Arab poets such as Antra and Nabiqa mention the mountain &#x27;Hasmi&#x27; in their poems.

Tabouk became famous for the Expedition of Tabuk in 630 CE, during the period of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Since then, it remained a gateway to North Arabia. It was visited by Charles Montagu Doughty in 1877. 

Tabuk was captured by the Arab forces in 1918, three weeks after the British capture of Damascus. Tabuk became a centre of military activity during the 1991 Gulf War as the city faced threats from Iraqi Scud missiles and air attacks.

== Archaeology ==
The region is rich in antiquities and archaeological sites such as petroglyphs, inscriptions, forts, palaces, walls, the Syrian-Egyptian pilgrimage route, and the remains of the Hejaz railway, the main station of which is located in Tabuk.

Hundreds of localities with rock art and inscriptions dating to different chronological periods and ranging from the Paleolithic to the Islamic period were recorded at Wadi Dam and the region west of Tabuk. A study of the art revealed rich stylistic variability and both human and animal figures were represented in it. Numerous sites in the area with Thamudic, Greek and Nabataean inscriptions have been found.
Tabuk Castle, known as the castle of &quot;Aṣ-ḥāb al-Aykah&quot; (, &quot;Companions of the Wood&quot;), is mentioned in the Quran. The castle dates back to about 3500 BCE and has been restored many times; the last was in 1652. Several forts and stations were built along the Syrian pilgrimage route, from the Jordanian border to Medina to welcome the pilgrims. The fort consists of two floors built around an open courtyard with a mosque, a well, and a stairway leading to the watch towers used by the guards. Tabuk Castle is considered an archaeological landmark of the region and is open to visitors.

Ain Sukkrah is an ancient &quot;‘spring&quot; (, &#x27;ayn&#x27;) dating back to Iron Age times (, &#x27;Ignorance&#x27;). There is a legend that during the expedition of Tabuk, Muhammad camped for more than ten days near the spring and drank from its water.

The Prophet&#x27;s Mosque is also known as the Repentance Mosque. It was originally built with mud and roofed with palm trunk trees. It was restored in 1652. Eventually, its complete renewal was ordered by the late King Faisal ibn Abdul-Aziz, along the pattern of the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina.

== Demographics ==
In 1950, Tabuk had a population of 12,000. By 2022, this number had grown to 594,350.

== Education ==

Universities include:
* University of Tabuk
* Fahad bin Sultan University

Private schools include:
* British International School of Tabuk
* International Indian School Tabuk
* Pakistan International School of Tabuk
* Philippine International School
* King Abdulaziz Model schools
* Tabuk International School
* Bangladesh International School, Tabuk

== Geography and climate ==


== Transportation ==
Tabuk Regional Airport is served by Saudia and other airlines, with both domestic and international destinations.

<doc id="900742" wikidata="Q663041" url="?curid=900742" title="Maturity-onset diabetes of the young">
<text>Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) refers to any of several hereditary forms of diabetes mellitus caused by mutations in an autosomal dominant gene disrupting insulin production. Along with neonatal diabetes, MODY is a form of the conditions known as monogenic diabetes. While the more common types of diabetes (especially type 1 and type 2) involve more complex combinations of causes involving multiple genes and environmental factors, each forms of MODY are caused by changes to a single gene (monogenic). HNF1A-MODY (MODY 3) are the most common forms.

Robert Tattersall and Stefan Fajans initially identified the phenomenon known as maturity onset diabetes of the young in a classic study published in the journal &quot;Diabetes&quot; in 1975.

==Signs and symptoms==

MODY accounts for at least 1-5% of all diagnoses of diabetes mellitus, though 50-90% of cases are estimated to be misdiagnosed as type 1, or type 2 diabetes. Estimated prevalence rates indicate 1 per 10,000 in adults, and 1 per 23,000 in children. 50% of first-degree relatives will inherit the same mutation, giving them a greater than 95% lifetime risk of developing MODY themselves. For this reason, correct diagnosis of this condition is important. Typically patients present with a strong family history of diabetes (i.e.: presence of diabetes before the age of 25 in two consecutive generations).

There are two general types of clinical presentation.
* Some forms of MODY produce significant hyperglycemia and the typical signs and symptoms of diabetes: increased thirst and urination (polydipsia and polyuria).
* In contrast, many people with MODY have no signs or symptoms and are diagnosed either by accident, when a high glucose is discovered during testing for other reasons, or screening of relatives of a person discovered to have diabetes. Discovery of mild hyperglycemia during a routine glucose tolerance test for pregnancy is particularly characteristic.

While the goals of diabetes management are the same no matter what type, there are two primary advantages of confirming a diagnosis of MODY.
* Insulin may not be necessary and it may be possible to switch a person from insulin injections to oral agents without loss of glycemic control.
* It may prompt screening of relatives and so help identify other cases in family members.

As it occurs infrequently, many cases of MODY are initially assumed to be more common forms of diabetes: type 1 if the patient is young and not overweight, type 2 if the patient is overweight, or gestational diabetes if the patient is pregnant. Standard diabetes treatments (insulin for type 1 and gestational diabetes, and oral hypoglycemic agents for type 2) are often initiated before the doctor suspects a more unusual form of diabetes.

==Pathophysiology==
The recognised forms of MODY are all due to ineffective insulin production or release by pancreatic beta cells. Several of the defects are mutations of transcription factor genes. One form is due to mutations of the glucokinase gene. For each form of MODY, multiple specific mutations involving different amino acid substitutions have been discovered. In some cases, there are significant differences in the activity of the mutant gene product that contribute to variations in the clinical features of the diabetes (such as degree of insulin deficiency or age of onset).

==Diagnosis==
The following characteristics suggest the possibility of a diagnosis of MODY in hyperglycemic and diabetic patients:
* Mild to moderate hyperglycemia (typically 130–250 mg/dL, or 7–14 mmol/L) discovered before 25 years of age. However, anyone under 50 can develop MODY.
* A first-degree relative with a similar degree of diabetes.
* Absence of positive antibodies or other autoimmunity (e.g., thyroiditis) in patient and family. However, Urbanova et al. found that about one quarter of Central European MODY patients are positive for islet cell autoantibodies (GABA and IA2A). Their expression is transient but highly prevalent. The autoantibodies were found in patients with delayed diabetes onset, and in times of insufficient diabetes control. The islet cell autoantibodies are absent in MODY in at least some populations (Japanese, Britons).
* Persistence of a low insulin requirement (e.g., less than 0.5 u/kg/day) past the usual &quot;honeymoon&quot; period.
* Normal insulin levels (e.g. 2.6-24.9)
* Absence of obesity (although overweight or obese people can get MODY) or other problems associated with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, polycystic ovary syndrome).
* Insulin resistance very rarely happens.
* Cystic kidney disease in patient or close relatives.
* Non-transient neonatal diabetes, or apparent type 1 diabetes with onset before six months of age.
* Liver adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma in MODY type 3
* Renal cysts, rudimentary or bicornuate uterus, vaginal aplasia, absence of the vas deferens, epidymal cysts in MODY type 5

The diagnosis of MODY is confirmed by specific gene testing available through commercial laboratories.

===Classification===
==== Heterozygous ====
MODY is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and most patients therefore have other members of the family with diabetes; penetrance differs between the types (from 40% to 90%).

A newly discovered monogenetic form of diabetes is marked by a missense variant in the RyR2 gene. It has not yet received a MODY type.

==== Homozygous ====
By definition, the forms of MODY are autosomal dominant, requiring only one abnormal gene to produce the disease; the severity of the disease is moderated by the presence of a second, normal allele which presumably functions normally. However, conditions involving people carrying two abnormal alleles have been identified. Unsurprisingly, combined (homozygous) defects of these genes are much rarer and much more severe in their effects.
* MODY2: Homozygous glucokinase deficiency causes severe congenital insulin deficiency resulting in persistent neonatal diabetes mellitus. About 6 cases have been reported worldwide. All have required insulin treatment from shortly after birth. The condition does not seem to improve with age.
* MODY4: Homozygous IPF1 results in failure of the pancreas to form. Congenital absence of the pancreas, termed pancreatic agenesis, involves deficiency of both endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas.

Homozygous mutations in the other forms have not yet been described. Those mutations for which a homozygous form has not been described may be extremely rare, may result in clinical problems not yet recognized as connected to the monogenic disorder, or may be lethal for a fetus and not result in a viable child.

==Treatment==

In some forms of MODY, standard treatment is appropriate, though exceptions occur:
* In MODY2, oral agents are relatively ineffective, however most patients are managed conservatively through diet and exercise.
* In MODY1 and MODY3, sulfonylureas are usually very effective, delaying the need for insulin treatment.
* Sulfonylureas are effective in the KATP channel forms of neonatal-onset diabetes. The mouse model of MODY diabetes suggested that the reduced clearance of sulfonylureas stands behind their therapeutic success in human MODY patients, but Urbanova et al. found that human MODY patients respond differently to the mouse model and that there was no consistent decrease in the clearance of sulfonylureas in randomly selected HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY patients.

Chronic hyperglycemia due to any cause can eventually cause blood vessel damage and the microvascular complications of diabetes. The principal treatment goals for people with MODY — keeping the blood sugars as close to normal as possible (&quot;good glycemic control&quot;), while minimizing other vascular risk factors — are the same for all known forms of diabetes.

The tools for management are similar for all forms of diabetes: blood testing, changes in diet, physical exercise, oral hypoglycemic agents, and insulin injections. In many cases these goals can be achieved more easily with MODY than with ordinary types 1 and 2 diabetes. Some people with MODY may require insulin injections to achieve the same glycemic control that another person may attain with careful eating or an oral medication.

When oral hypoglycemic agents are used in MODY, the sulfonylureas remain the oral medication of first resort. When compared to patients with type 2 diabetes, MODY patients are often more sensitive to sulphonylureas, such that a lower dose should be used to initiate treatment to avoid hypoglycaemia. Patients with MODY less often suffer from obesity and insulin resistance than those with ordinary type 2 diabetes (for whom insulin sensitizers like metformin or the thiazolidinediones are often preferred over the sulfonylureas).

==Epidemiology==
According to data from Saxony, Germany, MODY was responsible for 2.4% of diabetes incidence in children younger than 15 years.

==History==
The term MODY dates back to 1964, when diabetes mellitus was considered to have two main forms: juvenile-onset and maturity-onset, which roughly corresponded to what we now call type 1 and type 2. MODY was originally applied to any child or young adult who had persistent, asymptomatic hyperglycemia without progression to diabetic ketosis or ketoacidosis. In retrospect we can now recognize that this category covered a heterogeneous collection of disorders which included cases of dominantly inherited diabetes (the topic of this article, still called MODY today), as well as cases of what we would now call type 2 diabetes occurring in childhood or adolescence, and a few even rarer types of hyperglycemia (e.g., mitochondrial diabetes or mutant insulin). Many of these patients were treated with sulfonylureas with varying degrees of success.

The current usage of the term MODY dates from a case report published in 1974.

Since the 1990s, as the understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes has improved, the concept and usage of MODY have become refined and narrower. It is now used as a synonym for dominantly inherited, monogenic defects of insulin secretion occurring at any age, and no longer includes any forms of type 2 diabetes.

<text>Edward James &quot;Ed&quot; Begley Jr. (born September 16, 1949) is an American actor and environmental activist. He has appeared in hundreds of films, television shows, and stage performances. He played Dr. Victor Ehrlich on the television series &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; (1982–1988). The role earned him six consecutive Primetime Emmy Award nominations and a Golden Globe Award nomination. He also co-hosted, along with wife Rachelle Carson, the green living reality show titled &quot;Living with Ed&quot; (2007–2010), and recurred as Dr. Grant Linkletter in &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; (2019–2024).

In 2020, he was cast along with his wife Rachelle in the award-winning mockumentary &quot;Reboot Camp&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Begley was born in 1949 in Los Angeles, California, to Allene Jeanne Sanders and Oscar-winning film actor Ed Begley. When Begley Jr. was born, Begley Sr. was married to Amanda Huff, who died of cancer when Begley Jr. was 7 years old. Until he was 16, Begley Jr. believed that Huff was his biological mother. He only later became acquainted with Sanders, his biological mother.

Begley&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants. He grew up in Buffalo, New York, and attended Stella Niagara Education Park, a private Catholic school in Lewiston, New York. When he was 13, the family moved back to California, where he graduated from Notre Dame High School, Sherman Oaks, a Catholic high school, and from Los Angeles Valley College in North Hollywood.

==Career==
Begley has had numerous roles in television and film. He appeared as a guest actor on &quot;Maude&quot; and had guest appearances in the 1970s series &quot;Room 222&quot;. He had recurring roles on &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, &quot;Meego&quot;, and &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and starring roles in &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s Kingdom Hospital&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, and &quot;Wednesday 9:30 (8:30 Central)&quot;. He was in one episode of &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, playing a tall classmate of Chip&#x27;s.

He has played significant roles in Christopher Guest&#x27;s mockumentary films &quot;Best in Show&quot;, &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;, &quot;For Your Consideration&quot;, and &quot;Mascots&quot;. Additionally, Begley played Viper pilot Greenbean on the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; TV series, Boba Fett in the radio adaptation of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, and Seth Gillette, a fictional Democratic U.S. senator from North Dakota on &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

From 2000 to 2016, Begley was a member of the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 1996, he appeared in a TV movie called &quot;The Late Shift&quot;, where he portrayed CBS executive Rod Perth. He has guest-starred on shows such as &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. He had a recurring guest role in season three of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;. He appeared in the 2008 HBO film &quot;Recount&quot;, which profiled the 2000 presidential election and its aftermath, which was decided by Florida&#x27;s electoral votes after the United States Supreme Court halted the counting of the state&#x27;s popular vote. Begley also made an appearance on &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot; Season 3, Episode 3, as a spokesman for Cinco.

In 2003, Begley wrote and directed the musical &quot;Cesar and Ruben&quot;. It was performed at the El Portal Theatre in Los Angeles and was revived in 2007. Begley played Dr. Walter Krandall, the protagonist&#x27;s former marriage counselor and fiancé of his ex-wife in the CBS sitcom &quot;Gary Unmarried&quot;. Since 2008 he has been in a series of DirecTV commercials as a &quot;Cable Corp Inc.&quot; executive. In 2013, he appeared on the reality television show &quot;Beverly Hills Pawn&quot;. In 2016, he began appearing in the &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; prequel and spinoff &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; as Clifford Main, senior partner at the Davis &amp; Main law firm. Beginning in 2019, he appeared in &quot;Bless This Mess&quot; for the duration of the two seasons that the show ran.

==Personal life==
According to a feature on the Bio Channel television program &quot;Celebrity Close Calls&quot;, Begley nearly died in 1972 after being stabbed multiple times while, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, being mugged by a street gang of 25 youths.

Begley was married to Ingrid Taylor from 1976 to 1989. They had two children, a son and a daughter. In 2000, he married actress Rachelle Carson; they have a daughter.

Begley was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 2016.

==Activism==
===Environmental===
Since 1970, Begley has been an environmentalist, beginning with his first electric vehicle (a Taylor-Dunn, golf cart–like vehicle), recycling, and becoming a vegan.

Begley&#x27;s former home is in size, using solar power, wind power via a PacWind vertical-axis wind turbine, an air conditioning unit made by Greenway Design Group, LLC., and an electricity-generating bicycle used to toast bread. In 2008 he stated that he was paying around $300 a year in electric bills.

Noting that the suburban lawn is environmentally unsustainable, especially in Southern California, owing to water shortage, Begley has converted his own to a drought-tolerant garden composed of native California plants. He is noted for riding bicycles and using public transportation, and owns a 2003 Toyota RAV4 EV electric-powered vehicle. In 2023 and 2024, he took public transit to the Academy Awards.

Begley&#x27;s hybrid electric bicycle was often featured on his television show &quot;Living With Ed&quot;. Begley also spoofed his own environmentalist beliefs on &quot;Homer to the Max&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; by showing himself using a nonpolluting go-kart that is powered by his &quot;own sense of self-satisfaction&quot; and on an episode of &quot;Dharma and Greg&quot;. Later, he appeared in &quot;Gone Maggie Gone&quot;, another episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in Season 20. In the episode, during a solar eclipse, he drives a solar-powered car that stops running on train tracks as a train approaches, but the train also stops because it is an Ed Begley Jr. Solar Powered Train. According to another of Groening&#x27;s animated comedy series, &quot;Futurama&quot;, Begley&#x27;s electric motor is &quot;the most evil propulsion system ever conceived&quot; as stated in &quot;The Honking&quot; (19 minutes in).

Begley and friend Bill Nye are in a friendly competition to see who can have the lowest carbon footprint.

In 2009, Begley appeared in the Earth Day edition of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. He announced the final showcase, which included an electric bicycle, a solar-powered golf cart and a Toyota Prius.

Begley was featured during &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;&#x27;s Green Car Challenge. Various celebrities drove an electric Ford Focus automobile and tried to set records on an outdoor track. During the second lap, cutouts of Begley and Al Gore would pop out, and if the celebrity had hit either of them, one second was added to his or her time.

Begley is the author of &quot;Living Like Ed: A Guide to the Eco-Friendly Life&quot; (2008) and &quot;Ed Begley Jr.&#x27;s Guide to Sustainable Living: Learning to Conserve Resources and Manage an Eco-Conscious Life&quot; (2009) both published by Random House. He also wrote &quot;A Vegan Survival Guide for the Holidays&quot; (2014) with Jerry James Stone.

From 2007 to 2010, Begley and his wife Rachelle Carson starred in their own reality television series, &quot;Living with Ed&quot; on HGTV and Discovery&#x27;s Planet Green channel. In 2013 he, his wife and daughter Hayden filmed &quot;On Begley Street&quot;, a Web series chronicling the deconstruction of his current home and the &quot;building of North America&#x27;s greenest, most sustainable home&quot;.

He received the Thomas Alva Edison Award for Energy Independence from the American Jewish Congress, the first one to be presented. Begley has been a leader in this field and was recognized in November 2007 for his lifelong work in environmentalism.

===Political===
Begley was also on the advisory committee for the group &quot;2004 Racism Watch&quot;, founded by fellow actor Ed Asner. The group was formed to respond to the advertisement campaign of the George W. Bush/Dick Cheney presidential campaign that they claimed was encouraging racism. The advertisement in question, &quot;100 Days&quot;, made a reference to terrorism and terrorists while highlighting a photograph of an anonymous man of Middle Eastern descent.

==Friendships with other actors==

===William Daniels===
When Begley was a child, his future &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; series lead, William Daniels, met Begley&#x27;s father when the two were working on live television. By the time Begley Jr. grew up, he was already a fan of his mentor&#x27;s work; he would work with Daniels on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, where the two had on- and off-screen chemistry for six seasons. Daniels, himself, on the show, was a moody Irishman like Ed Sr., though a far more nurturing father figure. This proved so rich that the role grew beyond even the writers&#x27; expectations. Begley Jr. said about his future TV chief of surgery, &quot;I was a huge fan of Bill Daniels. I had seen him in &quot;Two for the Road&quot;. I had seen him in &quot;The Graduate&quot;, and in &quot;Parallax View&quot;. He was an actor I just thought the world of. He played these &#x27;Type A&#x27; personalities quite effectively, but (in real life) he is the sweetest guy in the world.&quot; He also added: &quot;He is an actor I just thought the world of. I had no delusions about how my character came to be. I rode on the coattails of Bill Daniels... the kind of Mutt and Jeff routine of Dr. Craig looking up and berating a 6 foot 4 doctor Victor Ehrlich. So I owe all my success on the show to Bill Daniels.&quot; After the series was canceled, the two still remained friends, living not too far away from each other. In 2002, Daniels and Begley Jr., alongside other surviving &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; cast members Stephen Furst and Eric Laneuville, all appeared on an episode of &quot;Scrubs&quot;.

=== Norman Lloyd ===
Before &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; in the early 1980s, the struggling and unknown Begley met Norman Lloyd, who became a mentor to him while Lloyd was directing an episode of &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;. The two became friends. In a 2014 interview with Jimmy Falcon of Cloverleaf Radio, he said this about Lloyd: Not only did I enjoy working with him, but I see him fairly regularly. I just had dinner with him 4 nights ago. We had dinner together at Sarah Nichols&#x27;s house, his neighbor of mine and friend of his. We had a lovely time and reminisced – he&#x27;s unbelievable. He&#x27;s going to be 100 years old this year—and still very active, getting around on his own. He&#x27;s a force of nature, so Norman Lloyd was somebody I idolized. When I was quite young, wow, James Dean is great and this is one and that. Now look at Janis Joplin, what a great voice and Jim Morrison, those people left us so young, like my point of view has change somewhere, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, saying, &#x27;No, you idolized Jimmy Stewart, Gloria Swanson.&#x27; The people that have families and happiness and a long, economy life. You know, Norman Lloyd, he wasn&#x27;t much older than me, when I did &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, and I went &#x27;These are my role models, now, people had a long/happy life and continued to be creative.&#x27; Those are my role models, not the people that left us so early and I&#x27;m sorry they did, I don&#x27;t mean to trifle with that, but, my role models changed from the people who had an incredible, brief spurt of creativity and life, but to people that went the distance, they became my role models at some point in my early 30s really.

On November 9, 2014, along with former &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; co-stars, Begley attended Lloyd&#x27;s 100th birthday in Los Angeles. Begley said, &quot;I worked with Norman Lloyd the actor, and Norman Lloyd the director, and no one informed me better on the art of storytelling than that talented man. He is a constant inspiration and my eternal friend.&quot;

<doc id="900748" wikidata="Q1508678" url="?curid=900748" title="George Yardley">
<text>George Harry Yardley III (November 3, 1928 – August 12, 2004) was an American basketball player. He was the first player in NBA history to score 2,000 points in one season, breaking the 1,932-point record held by George Mikan. Yardley was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1996.

==Early life==
A two-time All-American at Stanford University, Yardley was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, and earned the nickname &quot;Yardbird&quot; due to the chores he was required to complete by his fraternity brothers. The nickname was later shortened to &quot;Bird&quot;. After his three-year career at Stanford, Yardley played one year of AAU basketball and served in the United States Navy for two years. During his navy stint, Yardley&#x27;s amateur team won the national A.A.U. championship in 1951, with Yardley being selected the national amateur player-of-the-year. He was drafted by the NBA Fort Wayne Pistons in 1950.

==NBA career==
At 6&#x27;5&quot;, Yardley was a good-sized forward in 1950s basketball and was described as &quot;an offensive-minded player with a knack for scoring&quot; in his Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame biography.

Described as a &quot;flamboyant&quot; and &quot;gregarious&quot; player who &quot;never did anything without flair&quot;, Yardley had a stellar 7-year career, making the NBA All-Star team every year except for his rookie season. Paired with fellow all-star Larry Foust, Yardley led the Fort Wayne Pistons to two NBA Finals before the team moved to Detroit in 1957. In &#x27;57–58, the Pistons&#x27; first year in Detroit, Yardley led the league in scoring, averaging 27.8 points per game, and tallied 2001 points, just enough to make him the first NBA player to score 2000 points in a season. That year, Yardley also set NBA records for most free throws attempted (808) and most free throws made (655), and was named to the All-NBA First Team for the only time in his career.

On February 13, 1959, Yardley was traded to the Syracuse Nationals for Ed Conlin. Following a sixth All-Star selection the following season in 1959–1960, in which he averaged 20.2 points per game, he retired from basketball at the age of 31. He was the first player in NBA history to retire after averaging at least 20 PPG in his final year. Although Alex Groza had a 21.7 PPG average in his final NBA season in 1951, his career ended as a result of a lifelong ban, instead of a voluntary retirement like that of Yardley&#x27;s. He made a brief comeback in the short-lived American Basketball League with the Los Angeles Jets in 1961–62.

==Post-basketball career==
Making use of his engineering degree from Stanford, Yardley started his own engineering company in California following his retirement from the NBA. In 1996, Yardley was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a player.

In a tribute to Yardley posted after his death, Pete Newell later said &quot;George Yardley embodies what the Hall of Fame is all about. A marvelous athlete who made full use of his natural talents, a demeanor on the court a coach admires, and a life off the court and after his basketball career ended that has been very successful.&quot;

Yardley died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease, at the age of 75.

<doc id="900762" wikidata="Q298886" url="?curid=900762" title="Paolo Bettini">
<text>Paolo Bettini (born 1 April 1974) is an Italian former champion road racing cyclist, and the former coach of the Italian national cycling team. Considered the best classics specialist of his generation, and probably one of the strongest of all times, he won gold medals in the 2004 Athens Olympics road race and in the 2006 and 2007 World Road Race Championships. He is nicknamed &quot;Il Grillo&quot; (&quot;the cricket&quot;) for his repeated sudden attacks and his sprinting style.

He gained prominence by winning Liège–Bastogne–Liège in 2000 and 2002. He set the record for World Cup wins in a season in 2003, winning the Milan–San Remo, HEW Cyclassics and Clásica de San Sebastián. He won the Giro di Lombardia in 2005 and 2006, the Züri-Metzgete in 2001 and 2005 and Tirreno–Adriatico in 2004.

==Career==
===Early career===
Paolo Bettini lived with his family on the Tuscany coast. He began racing when he was seven and won 23 of his first 24 races. His first bike had a secondhand frame which his father, Giuliano, had painted orange. The components were cannibalised from other bikes. He started racing after the encouragement of his brother.

He came fourth in the world under-23 road championship in 1996, behind three other Italians, Giuliano Fugeras, Roberti Sgambelluri and Luca Sironi. He turned professional the following year for the MG-Technogym team. There he rode as domestique to Michele Bartoli, &quot;a working class cyclist&quot;, wrote Stephen Farrand, &quot;destined to work for others to earn his crust.&quot; He worked for Bartoli, who in return helped with advice. Bartoli won the World Cup in 1997 and 1998 with Bettini&#x27;s help.

Bartoli fell heavily on a knee in 1999 and Bettini was freed to race for himself. He won Liège–Bastogne–Liège in 2000 – treating himself to a €100,000 Porsche – and a flat stage of that year&#x27;s Tour de France, from Agen to Dax. He won the 2001 Züri-Metzgete after a few months without wins, beating Jan Ullrich in the sprint to the finish. His success led to a feud with Bartoli. It culminated in the 2001 world championship in Lisbon, Portugal, where Bartoli refused to lead Bettini to a flying start in the sprint finish and the Spaniard, Óscar Freire, won instead.

===2002 World Cup and race season===
The 2002 season was a breakthrough. In the World Cup, Bettini was caught in the final kilometers of Milan–San Remo. After his 1–2 win with Stefano Garzelli in Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Bettini ran neck-to-neck against Museeuw, who won Paris–Roubaix in a 50 km solo breakaway, and the HEW Cyclassics. A tactical ride in Giro di Lombardia earned Bettini the World Cup.

Bettini played strong support in Mario Cipollini&#x27;s victory in the UCI Road Cycling World Championship in Zolder, Belgium.

===2003 World Cup and race season===
The 2003 World Cup series started with Milan–San Remo. Attacking twice in the last hills leading down to the Primavera, Bettini had the help of Luca Paolini, who attacked down the tricky descent towards the finish.

However, injury in the Gent–Wevelgem forced Bettini to miss several races until the Tour de France in July. He then followed with a win in the HEW Cyclassics in front of Tour runner-up Jan Ullrich, and a win in the Clásica de San Sebastián.

Bettini failed to win the UCI Road Cycling World Championship despite being favorite due to a mistake at the end of the race. Having established himself in the winning breakaway, hesitation allowed the Spaniard Igor Astarloa to break away to win. Astarloa claimed that Bettini had offered him money to relinquish the win, which Astarloa said he refused. A feud ensued, and Astarloa attributed his comment to a misunderstanding of Bettini&#x27;s Italian.

===2004 World Cup and race season===

The 2004 season started well with Milan–San Remo, but Davide Rebellin won the La Flèche Wallonne (not in the World Cup), Liège–Bastogne–Liège and Amstel Gold Race. Bettini&#x27;s disappointments continued with second places in the HEW Cyclassics, which he had won previously, and in the Clásica de San Sebastián, which he had won the previous year. The points gained in Paris–Tours put him in the leader&#x27;s jersey, but with the last race the Giro di Lombardia better suited to Rebellin, the World Cup was not yet safe. Bettini followed Rebellin throughout the race, resulting in Rebellin&#x27;s quitting in frustration.

Bettini&#x27;s most important victory was the 2004 Summer Olympics, where he broke away with Portuguese Sérgio Paulinho for a comfortable victory decided on a last moment sprint with both. He again failed to win the world championship due to an injury when he banged his knee against the team car at the beginning of the race.

===2005 UCI ProTour and race season===
After Milan–San Remo, Bettini had an injury-marked start which prevented significant participation in the spring classics, and he had no victories until he got two stage wins at the 2005 Giro d&#x27;Italia, where he wore the pink jersey as leader of the general classification for several days. After that, no more good results until the 2005 Vuelta a España, where he beat Alessandro Petacchi in an uphill sprint in Valladolid. After that, he took part in the world championship in Madrid, where he got into the decisive break but did not get a medal. A week later, he won Züri-Metzgete for a second time. Two weeks later he won the Giro di Lombardia as well.

===2006 UCI ProTour and race season===
Bettini won the first race of the season, the &quot;Trofeo Soller&quot;, which is part of the Challenge Mallorca. He also won the Gran Premio di Lugano, two stages in the Tirreno–Adriatico and the 15th stage in the Giro d&#x27;Italia, where he won the points classification. Following the Giro he became the Italian road champion and won a stage at the Vuelta a España before winning the world championship.

His brother Sauro died in a car accident a few days after that victory and Bettini was close to abandoning cycling. He changed his mind and won the Giro di Lombardia in tears.

On 2 March 2007, the French magazine &quot;Velo&quot; awarded Bettini its Vélo d&#x27;Or as best rider of 2006.

===2007 UCI ProTour and race season===

Bettini raced in the second annual 2.HC-rated 2007 Tour of California and made it worth his while by capturing Stage 4 in a sprint finish. He later won the third stage of the Vuelta a España and finished second in three more stages. Then he won once again the rainbow jersey of the Elite Men&#x27;s Road at Stuttgart.

===2008 season===

Bettini&#x27;s start was plagued by injuries, including a fall at the Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne and a rib broken when he fell on a wet descent in the Tour of the Basque Country. He won the Trofeo Matteotti and stages at the Tour of Austria and Tour de Wallonie. He also won two stages at the Vuelta a España, where he said he was leaving Quick Step after 10 years due to a financial dispute.
On September 27 he announced his retirement.
On 4 November, he fell during the Milan six-day and was taken to hospital unconscious.

===Coaching career===
On 17 June 2010, Bettini was named as the new Italian national coach, following the death of Franco Ballerini in a car accident earlier that year. He left this role in 2014 to work with Fernando Alonso on his new cycling team in preparation for its launch in 2015.

==Track racing==
Bettini followed the path of riders before the 1970s and took up six-day racing in the winter. He rode at Munich and Grenoble in 2006. &quot;I didn&#x27;t do it for the money&quot;, he said. &quot;I had that already. I did it through my love of racing, to see what it&#x27;s like to race on a track.&quot; The bankings proved trickier than the road, however, and his debut was described as &quot;catastrophic&quot; as he failed to get alongside his partner in the two-man relay race, the madison, and finished the first night &quot;with fear in his face.&quot; Charly Mottet said:

:I saw him at the start of the evening and he worried me. Two hours later, I can tell you, he had won the respect of the others. He was making proper changes, he was taking part in the race and he was going better and better. The others couldn&#x27;t believe their eyes [&quot;commencaient à ne plus voir le jour&quot;].

==Personal life==
Bettini married Monica Orlandini, a literature teacher, in 2000. They moved into a farmhouse belonging to his wife&#x27;s family, who have been olive farmers for four generations. They live in Riparbella, 10 km from Cecina, where Bettini was born.

<text>May Fung Yee Pang (born October 24, 1950) is an American former music executive. She worked for John Lennon and Yoko Ono as a personal assistant and production coordinator. When Lennon and Ono separated in 1973, Pang and Lennon began a relationship that lasted more than 18 months. Lennon later referred to this time as his &quot;Lost Weekend&quot;. Pang published two books about her relationship with Lennon: a memoir, &quot;Loving John&quot; (Warner, 1983); and a book of photographs, &quot;Instamatic Karma&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Press, 2008). A documentary about their relationship, &quot;The Lost Weekend: A Love Story,&quot; was produced in 2022.

Pang was married to producer Tony Visconti from 1989 to 2000 and has two children.

==Early years and education==
Pang was born in Manhattan. She is the daughter of Chinese immigrants and grew up in the Spanish Harlem section of New York City with an elder sister and an adopted brother, both of whom were born in China. Pang&#x27;s mother owned and operated a laundry business in the area. The Pang family left Spanish Harlem when the tenements where they lived were scheduled to be razed, moving to an apartment near 97th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan.

After graduating from Saint Michael Academy, Pang attended New York City Community College. She aspired to be a model, but modeling agencies reportedly told her she was too &quot;ethnic&quot;. Pang&#x27;s early jobs included being a song-plugger, which meant encouraging artists to record songs written by songwriters. In 1970, she began work in New York as a receptionist at ABKCO Records, Allen Klein&#x27;s management office, which at that time represented Apple Records and three former Beatles: Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.

Pang was asked to help Lennon and Ono with their avant-garde film projects, &quot;Up Your Legs Forever&quot; and &quot;Fly&quot;, in December 1970. Pang then became Lennon and Ono&#x27;s secretary, factotum and gofer in New York City and Britain. This led to a permanent position as their personal assistant when the Lennons moved from London to Manhattan in 1971. Pang coordinated an art exhibition in Syracuse, New York, on October 9, 1971, for Ono&#x27;s &quot;This Is Not Here&quot; art show at the Everson Museum. Ono&#x27;s show coincided with Lennon&#x27;s 31st birthday, and a party was held at the Hotel Syracuse, which was attended by Ringo Starr, Phil Spector, and Elliot Mintz.

==&quot;Lost Weekend&quot;==
In mid-1973, Pang was working on the recording of Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Mind Games&quot; album. Lennon and Ono were having marital problems, and Ono suggested to Pang that she become Lennon&#x27;s companion. Ono explained that she and Lennon were not getting along, they had been arguing and were growing apart, and that Lennon would start seeing other women. She pointed out that Lennon had said he found Pang sexually attractive. Pang replied that she could never start a relationship with Lennon as he was her employer and married. Ono ignored Pang&#x27;s protests and said that she would arrange everything. Ono later confirmed this conversation in an interview.

At the time Lennon had his 18-month relationship with Pang, he was in a period of his life that he later referred to as his &quot;Lost Weekend&quot;, in reference to the film and novel of the same title.

In October 1973, Lennon and Pang left New York for Los Angeles to promote &quot;Mind Games&quot;, and decided to stay for a while, living at lawyer Harold Seider&#x27;s apartment for a couple of days and then Lou Adler&#x27;s house. While there, Lennon was inspired to embark on two recording projects: to make an album of the old rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll songs that inspired him to become a musician, and to produce another artist. In December 1973, Lennon collaborated with Phil Spector to record the oldies album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. Lennon&#x27;s drinking and Spector&#x27;s erratic behavior (which included his firing a gun in the studio control room) caused the sessions to break down. Then Spector, who claimed to have been in a car accident, took the session tapes and became unreachable.

In March 1974, Lennon began producing Harry Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;Pussy Cats&quot; album, thus named to counter the &quot;bad boy&quot; image the pair had earned in the media with two drinking incidents at the Troubadour. The first was when Lennon placed a Kotex on his forehead and scuffled with a waitress at a concert given by Ann Peebles, who had released &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand the Rain&quot;, one of Lennon&#x27;s current favorite records; and the second, two weeks later when Lennon and Nilsson were ejected from the same club after heckling the Smothers Brothers. Lennon thought it would be a good idea for the musicians to live under one roof to ensure they would get to the studio on time, so Pang rented a beach house in Santa Monica for her, Lennon, Nilsson, Ringo Starr and Keith Moon to live. At this time, Pang encouraged Lennon to reach out to family and friends. He and Paul McCartney mended fences and played together for the first and only time after the breakup of the Beatles (see &quot;A Toot and a Snore in &#x27;74&quot;). Pang also arranged for Julian Lennon to visit his father for the first time in over two years.

Julian began to see his father more regularly. Lennon bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul copy guitar and a drum machine for Christmas in 1973, and encouraged Julian&#x27;s interest in music by showing him some chords. &quot;Dad and I got on a great deal better then,&quot; recalls Julian. &quot;We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general when he was with May Pang. My memories of that time with Dad and May are very clear—they were the happiest time I can remember with them.&quot; The cover of Julian&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Jude,&quot; features a childhood photo of him taken by Pang.

In June 1974, Lennon and Pang returned to live in Manhattan. Lennon stopped drinking and concentrated on recording. Lennon previously had cats while he lived at his Aunt Mimi&#x27;s house in Liverpool; he and Pang adopted two cats that they named Major and Minor. In the early summer, Lennon was working on his &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; album when the couple moved into a penthouse apartment at 434 East 52nd Street. On August 23, Lennon and Pang claimed to have seen a UFO from their terrace, which had a panoramic view of Queens. To gain access to the deck, Lennon and Pang had to climb out of their kitchen window. On the night in question, a naked Lennon excitedly called Pang to join him on the deck outside and they both watched a circular object silently floating less than 100 feet away. Lennon called Bob Gruen—Lennon&#x27;s &quot;official&quot; photographer—and told him what had happened. Gruen suggested Lennon should call the police, but Lennon laughed it off, saying, &quot;I’m not going to call up the newspaper and say &#x27;This is John Lennon and I saw a flying saucer last night.&#x27;&quot; Gruen called the local police precinct which confirmed that three other people had reported a sighting, and the &quot;Daily News&quot; wrote that five people had reported a sighting in the same area of New York where Lennon and Pang lived. Lennon refers to the incident in the song &quot;Nobody Told Me&quot;.

&quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; rose to the top spot on the album charts. Lennon achieved his only number-one solo US single in his lifetime with &quot;Whatever Gets You thru the Night&quot;. Pang&#x27;s is the voice whispering Lennon&#x27;s name on &quot;#9 Dream&quot;. &quot;Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox)&quot; was written about her. Julian played drums on the album&#x27;s last track, &quot;Ya Ya&quot;. While recording &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot;, Al Coury, vice president of promotion for Capitol Records, got possession of the chaotic Spector session tapes and brought them to New York. Lennon completed his oldies album, which was titled &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, with the same musicians he used on &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot;. Pang received an RIAA gold record award for her work on &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; and continued her work as production coordinator of Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; album, where she was credited as &quot;Mother Superior&quot;. Pang also worked on albums by Nilsson, Starr, Elton John and David Bowie.

While visiting Mick Jagger at Andy Warhol&#x27;s compound in Montauk, New York, Lennon and Pang saw a Scottish-style cottage for sale close to the Montauk Point Lighthouse. Lennon asked a real estate broker to put in an offer for it in February 1975. In the same month, Lennon and Pang were also planning on visiting Paul and Linda McCartney in New Orleans, where Wings were recording the &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; album, but Lennon reconciled with Ono the day before the planned visit, after Ono said she had a new cure for Lennon&#x27;s smoking habit. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang he had reconciled with Ono and their relationship was over. Over the coming years, Pang quietly met Lennon a few times but their relationship was never rekindled.

Lennon lamented this period publicly but not in private. Journalist Larry Kane, who befriended Lennon in 1964, wrote a comprehensive biography of Lennon which detailed the &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; period. In the interview with Kane, Lennon explained his feelings about his time with Pang; &quot;You know Larry, I may have been the happiest I&#x27;ve ever been... I loved this woman (Pang), I made some beautiful music and I got so fucked up with booze and shit and whatever.&quot;

===Pang&#x27;s books about Lennon===

After Lennon returned to Ono, Pang started working for United Artists Records and Island Records as a public relations manager, working on albums by Bob Marley and Robert Palmer.

Pang published her memoir &quot;Loving John&quot; in 1983. It was updated and renamed &quot;John Lennon: The Lost Weekend&quot;. The original 500-page &quot;Loving John&quot; book focused mainly on Pang&#x27;s role on Lennon&#x27;s albums and sessions. It was edited down to 300 pages, concentrating mostly on the sensational aspects of their relationship. It also included postcards that Lennon had written to Pang during his travels throughout the world in the late 1970s. Pang claims that she and Lennon remained lovers until 1977, and stayed in contact until his death.

Pang&#x27;s book of photographs &quot;Instamatic Karma&quot; was published in 2008. Besides the candid personal portraits, the book contains some historically important photographs, such as Lennon signing the official dissolution of the Beatles&#x27; partnership, and one of the last known photographs of Lennon and Paul McCartney together. Cynthia Lennon also provided a back cover endorsement, acknowledging Pang&#x27;s role in reuniting Lennon with his estranged first son, Julian.

== &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; documentary ==
The Tribeca Film Festival announced the 2022 premiere of &quot;The Lost Weekend: A Love Story&quot;, a 97-minute documentary about Pang&#x27;s life and relationship with Lennon, on June 10 via virtual home viewing. The film was produced and directed by Eve Brandstein, Richard Kaufman and Stuart Samuels. &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; appeared in theaters internationally for a limited run April 13th and 14th 2023 and became available via streaming and on BluRay in October 2023.

== Photography ==
Coinciding with the release of the 2022 documentary, Pang published a collection of her photographs of Lennon which were made available for sale in an touring exhibition called &quot;The Lost Weekend: The Photography of May Pang&quot;.

== Jewelry ==
Pang started her own jewelry business. She designs stainless-steel feng shui jewelry. 

==Subsequent personal life==
Pang married record producer Tony Visconti in 1989; the couple divorced in 2000. They had two children. Pang remains in touch with some of the people from her time with Lennon, and Paul McCartney invited her to Linda McCartney&#x27;s memorial service. She was an invited guest at The Concert for George in 2002 and remained close to Cynthia Lennon and Lennon&#x27;s first son, Julian.

Although having had no contact for 30 years, on October 9, 2006, Pang accidentally met Ono in Iceland, on what would have been Lennon&#x27;s 66th birthday. Ono was in Iceland to unveil a sculpture in Reykjavík and was staying in the same hotel.

Pang still resides in New York City. She volunteers with an animal shelter called Animal Haven in New York and owned a dog that was rescued after Hurricane Katrina. She also co-hosts an Internet talk radio show, &quot;Dinner Specials with Cynthia and May Pang&quot;, at blogtalkradio.com, with on-air partner Cynthia Neilson.

<doc id="900766" wikidata="Q4020393" url="?curid=900766" title="Wings (1977 TV series)">
<text>Wings is a drama series about the Royal Flying Corps that ran on BBC television from 1977 to 1978. It stars Tim Woodward as Alan Farmer, a young blacksmith turned fighter pilot in the First World War. Nicholas Jones played his teacher and mentor, Captain Triggers and Michael Cochrane played his upper-class friend, Charles Gaylion, who began a relationship with Farmer&#x27;s girlfriend while Farmer was believed dead, shot down over France.

The series reveals that the British pilots are struggling with aeroplanes which are unreliable and inferior to the German machines and with an Establishment that classes voicing an opinion to that effect as being tantamount to cowardice. The airmen must also face the resentment of British soldiers who see them having an &quot;easy&quot; life. The rigidity of the British class structure is highlighted when Farmer becomes an officer in the second series – he faces resentment from some officers because of his class and NCOs because of his new rank. The series takes great care with historical accuracy, covering the early days of the parachute, the fitting of weaponry to British biplanes (lacking the Germans&#x27; interruptor gear, they had to be fired at an angle rather than between the propeller blades) and the horrors of trench warfare. &quot;Wings&quot; depicts a Britain that is, in some areas, struggling to adapt in the face of change, at a period that was a turning point for many people&#x27;s way of life.

The series was created by Barry Thomas. Twenty-five episodes were made in all.

==Effects==
The book &quot;BBC VFX&quot; (Mat Irvine and Mike Tucker) states that few First World War aircraft were still airworthy at the time of production so the majority of flying shots were achieved with 1/6 scale radio-controlled models under the guidance of long-time model aircraft expert David Boddington alongside Derek Piggott and Tony Bianchi. Piggott served as a stunt pilot during the filming of the 1966 movie &quot;The Blue Max&quot;.

* Reg Lye as Tom
* Michael Jayes as 2nd Lieutenant Michael Starling
* Graham Wyles as Roger Pearson

==Episodes==
Series 1 consisted of 12 episodes. Series 2 consisted of 13 episodes.

===Series 1 (1977)===
===Series 2 (1978)===
==Broadcast==
The first series was screened on BBC1 on Sundays from 2 January 1977 to 20 March 1977. The second series was shown on BBC1 on Thursdays from 5 January 1978 to 30 March 1978.

<text>Taipei Metro (also known as Taipei Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and branded as Metro Taipei) is a rapid transit system operated by the Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation serving the capital Taipei and New Taipei City in Taiwan.

It was the first rapid transit system to be built on the island. The initial network was approved for construction in 1986 and work began two years later. It began operations on 28 March 1996, and by 2000, 62 stations were in service across three main lines. 

Over the next nine years, the number of passengers had increased by 70%. Since 2008, the network has expanded to 131 stations and the passenger count has grown by another 96%. The system has been praised by locals for its effectiveness in relieving growing traffic congestion in Taipei and its surrounding satellite towns, with over eight million trips made daily.

==History==
===Proposal and construction===

The idea of constructing a rapid transit system on the island was first put forth at a press conference on 28 June 1968, where the Ministry of Transportation and Communications announced its plans to begin researching the possibility of constructing such a network in the Taipei metropolitan area; however, the plan was shelved due to financial concerns and the belief that such a system was not urgently needed at the time. With the increase of traffic congestion accompanying economic growth in the 1970s, the need for a rapid transit system became more pressing. In February 1977, the Institute of Transportation (IOT) of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) released a preliminary rapid transport system report, with the designs of five lines: U1, U2, U3, S1, and S2, to form a rough sketch of the planned corridors, some of which would be converted from single-tracked Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) branch lines, resulting in the first rapid transit system plan for Taipei.

In 1981, the IOT invited British Mass Transit Consultants (BMTC) and to form a team and provide in-depth research on the preliminary report. In 1982, the Taipei City Government commissioned National Chiao Tung University to do a research and feasibility study on medium-capacity rapid transit systems. In January 1984, the university proposed an initial design for a medium-capacity rapid transit system in Taipei City, including plans for Wenhu line and Tamsui–Xinyi line of the medium-capacity metro system. The pre-1985 plans would have retained the 3 ft 6 in gauge of the TRA lines and the rolling stock design would have to be conform to TRA and Japanese narrow-gauge standards. On 1 March 1985, the Executive Yuan Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) signed a treaty with the Taipei Transit Council (TTC), composed of three American consultant firms, to do overall research on a rapid transit system in metropolitan Taipei. Apart from adjustments made to the initial proposal, such as the move to standard gauge track and wider and longer rolling stock for the high-capacity lines, Wenhu line of the medium-capacity metro system was also included into the network. In 1986, the initial network design of the Taipei Metro by the CEPD was passed by the Executive Yuan, although the network corridors were not yet set. A budget of NT$441.7 billion was allocated for the project.

On 27 June 1986, the Preparatory Office of Rapid Transit Systems was created, which on 23 February 1987 was formally established as the Department of Rapid Transit Systems (DORTS) for the task of handling, planning, design, and construction of the system. Apart from preparing for the construction of the metro system, DORTS also made small changes to the metro corridor. The 6 lines proposed on the initial network were: Tamsui line and Xindian line (Lines U1 and U2), Zhonghe Line (Line U3), Nangang Line and Banqiao Line (Line S1), and Muzha (now Wenhu) line (Wenhu line medium-capacity), totaling 79 stations and route length, including of elevated rail, at ground level, and underground. The Neihu Line corridor was approved later in 1990. On 27 June 1994, the Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation (TRTC) was formed to oversee the operation of the Taipei Metro system.

The Executive Yuan approved the initial network plan for the system on 27 May 1986. Ground was broken and construction began on 15 December 1988. The growing traffic problems of the time, compounded by road closures due to TRTS construction led to what became popularly known as the &quot;dark age of Taipei traffic&quot;. The TRTS was the center of political controversy during its construction and shortly after the opening of its first line in 1996 due to incidents such as computer malfunction during a thunderstorm, alleged structural problems in some elevated segments, budget overruns, and fare prices.

=== Opening and Initial network ===
The system opened on 28 March 1996, with the elevated , a driverless, medium-capacity line with twelve stations running from to . The first high-capacity line, the , began service on 28 March 1997, running from to , then extended to at the end of the year. On 23 December 1998, the system passed the milestone of 100 million passengers.

=== 1999–2006 Expansions ===
On 24 December 1999, a section of the was opened between and . This section became the first east–west line running through the city, connecting the two previously completed north–south lines. On 31 May 2006, the second stage of the Banqiao–Nangang section and the Tucheng section began operation. The service was then named Bannan after the districts that it connects (Banqiao and Nangang).

=== Maokong Gondola ===

On 4 July 2007, the Maokong Gondola, a new aerial lift/cable-car system, was opened to the public. The system connects the , , and Maokong. Service was suspended on 1 October 2008 due to erosion from mudslides under a support pillar following Typhoon Jangmi. The gondola officially resumed service as of 31 March 2010, after relocation of the pillar and passing safety inspections.

=== 2009–2014 expansions ===
On 4 July 2009, with the opening of the Neihu segment of , the last of the six core segments was completed. Due to debate on whether to construct a medium-capacity or high-capacity line, construction of the line did not begin until 2002.

 was extended from to and in 2012. The Xinyi section of and Songshan section of were opened on 24 November 2013 and 15 November 2014 respectively.

Prior to 2014, only physical lines had official names; services did not. In 2008, all full-run and short-turn services were referred to by termini while Bannan and Wenhu services were referred to by the physical lines on which they operated.

Following the completion of the core sections of the system in 2014, the naming scheme for services was set and &#x27;lines&#x27; started to referred to services. Between 2014 and 2016, lines were given alternative number names based on the order of the dates the lines first opened. Brown, Red, Green, Orange and Blue lines were named lines 1 to 5 respectively. The planned Circular, Wanda–Shulin and Minsheng–Xizhi lines were to be lines 6 to 8 respectively. In 2016, the number names were replaced by colour names. Today, on-board announcements in Chinese use full official names, whereas in English, colour names are used instead.

In June 2023, due to an increasing number of South Korean tourists, the metro announced the addition of Korean announcements at stations where there are high amounts of tourists.

On 3 April 2024, following a magnitude 7 earthquake hitting the island, all active MRT trains were suspended for safety checks to be conducted. All Taipei Metro routes resumed operations later that day.

==Timeline of services==
== Size ==


==Lines==
The system is designed based on the spoke-hub distribution paradigm, with most rail lines running radially outward from central Taipei. The MRT system operates daily from 06:00 to 00:00 the following day (the last trains finish their runs by 01:00), with extended services during special events (such as New Year festivities). Trains operate at intervals of 1:30 to 15 minutes depending on the line and time of day. Smoking is forbidden in the entire metro system, while eating, drinking, and chewing gum and betel nuts are forbidden within the paid area.

Stations can become extremely crowded during rush hours, especially at transfer stations such as , , and . Automated station announcements are recorded in Mandarin, English, Taiwanese, and Hakka, with Japanese at busy stations. Japanese coverage across the network was expanded on 24 August 2023. Select stations also received Korean announcements to accommodate for the high influx of South Korean tourists to the capital. Subsequently, announcement order was changed to Mandarin, English, Japanese, Korean, then Taiwanese and Hakka.
==Fares and tickets==

Fares range between –65 per trip as of 2018. RFID single journey tokens and rechargeable IC cards (such as the EasyCard and the iPASS), as well as NFC-based mobile payments (only Google Wallet and Samsung Wallet) are used to collect fares for day-to-day use. 

===Discounts and Cocessions===
A 20% off discount was given to all IC card users, but it was cancelled at the start of February 2020. The discount program was instead switched to an intensity-based scheme. The more times passengers take the MRT, the higher the level of discount they could receive. For example, 10% discount is given for 11–20 rides; 20% discount is provided for 31–40 rides; the highest discount is 30% off for more than 50 rides. The discount is considered a rebate and is deposited to the user&#x27;s card on the first of each month from the previous month. Those with welfare cards issued by local governments could receive 60% off per ride. Children aged 6 or over pay adult fares. Other ticket types include passes, joint tickets with other services and tickets for groups and discounts for YouBike rentals at the Taipei Main Station.

===Ticketing System===
Turnstiles of Taipei Metro are being replaced by the end of 2025 to enable contactless bank card and QR code payments.
== Infrastructure ==

The Taipei Metro provides an obstacle-free environment within the entire system; all stations and trains are handicap accessible. Features include: handicap-capable restrooms, ramps and elevators for wheelchairs and strollers, tactile guide paths, extra-wide faregates, and trains with a designated wheelchair area.

Beginning in September 2003, the English station names for Taipei Metro stations were converted to use Hanyu pinyin before the end of December, with brackets for Tongyong Pinyin names for signs shown at the station entrances and exits. However, after the conversion, many stations were reported to have multiple conflicting English station names caused by inconsistent conversions, even for stations built after enactment of the new naming policy. The information brochures (臺北市大眾捷運系統捷運站轉乘公車資訊手冊) printed in September 2004 still used Wade–Giles romanizations.

To accommodate increasing passenger numbers, all metro stations have replaced turnstiles with speed gates since 2007, and single-journey magnetic cards have been replaced by RFID tokens.
TRTS provides free mobile phone connections in all stations, trains, and tunnels and also provides WiFi WLAN connections at several station hotspots. The world&#x27;s first WiMAX-service metro trains were introduced on the in 2007, allowing passengers to access the internet and watch live broadcasts. Several stations are also equipped with mobile charging stations.
=== Platforms ===

Most underground stations have island platform configurations while a few have side platform configurations. Most elevated and at-grade stations have side platform configurations, while a few have island platform configurations. All high-capacity metro stations have a long platform to accommodate all six-train cars on a typical metro train (with the exception of ). The width of the platform and concourse depends on the volume of transit; the largest stations include Taipei Main Station, , and . Some other transfer stations, including , , and , also have wide platforms.

Several stations have a cross-platform interchange: Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall, Guting, Dongmen and Ximen. Both lines&#x27; tracks in one direction use the lower floor, while both lines&#x27; tracks in the other direction use the upper floor. Dongmen station is unique in that the directions of travel on each floor are reversed, so that there&#x27;s a cross-platform interchange when travelling between the city center and the suburbs. 

Each station is equipped with LED displays and LCD TVs both in the concourse and on the platforms which display the time of arrival of the next train. At all stations, red lights on or above automatic platform gates at stations flash prior to a train arrival to alert passengers and an arrival melody would play (except on the and certain elevated and at-grade stations). Similarly, before platform screen doors were retrofitted, stations would have lights on the edges of platforms which would flash upon a train&#x27;s arrival. This can still be seen on other metro systems such as the Washington Metro.

As of September 2018, all stations have automatic platform gates. Before 2018, all the stations on the Wenhu line and most stations on the , as well as a few stations on other lines, were equipped with platform screen doors. A Track Intrusion Detection System had also been installed to improve passenger safety at stations without platform doors. The system uses infrared and radio detectors to monitor unusual movement in the track area.

===Signalling===

When the Muzha Line first opened in 1996, the line was initially equipped with automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train control (ATC), which in turn comprised automatic train protection (ATP) and automatic train supervision (ATS); in particular the ATP relied on transmission coils and wayside control units whereas the ATO relied on dwell operation control units. The transmission coils are controlled by the Control Centre to ensure safety of the line and were positioned on the guideway. Among such coils included the PD loop, safety frequency loop, stopping program loop, vehicle station link and station vehicle link; these loops were cross-arranged to produce electromagnetic induction with the interval between two cross points being 0.3 seconds to both monitor the train and control its speed. However this fixed-block ATC system used on the Muzha Line was plagued with problems in its early years of operation and was replaced with the new moving-block Cityflo 650 CBTC that was supplied by Bombardier Transportation of Canada for the Neihu Line.

On the other hand, the heavy-capacity lines use the traditional fixed block system design, which were initially supplied by General Railway Signal of Rochester, New York, for the Tamsui, Xindian, Zhonghe, and Bannan lines; and later by Alstom for the Tucheng, Xinzhuang, Luzhou, Xinyi and Songshan lines. Key components of the system include impedance bond, 4-foot loops, marker coils, alignment antennae and two-aspect light signals for the wayside as well as automatic train supervision which utilises centralized traffic control.

=== Public art ===
In the initial network, important stations such as transfer stations, terminal stations, and stations with heavy passenger flow were chosen for the installation of public art. The principles behind the locations of public art were visual focus and non-interference with passenger circulation and construction schedules. The artworks included murals, children&#x27;s mosaic collages, sculptures, hung forms, spatial art, interactive art, and window displays. The selection methods included open competitions, invitational competitions, direct assignments, and cooperation with children.
Stations with public art displays include: , , , , , , , , , , , Songshan Airport, , , and . Stations with art galleries include , , , and . station contains a small archeological museum. 

=== Other facilities ===
In addition to the rapid transit system itself, Taipei Metro operates several public facilities such as underground shopping malls, parks, and public squares in and around stations, including:

*Zhongshan Metro Mall: – – (815 m, 81 shops).
*Taipei main station underground mall: on floor B1 of the station.
*Taipei New World Shopping Center: Between the metro and TRA sections of Taipei Station.
*Station front metro mall: West of Taipei main station, beneath Zhongxiao W Road.
*Taipei City Mall: Northwest of Taipei main station, beneath Zhengzhou Rd and Civic Blvd.
* East Metro Mall: Between and (825 m, 35 shops).
* Ximen Underground Mall: north of (currently used as an office building and library).
* Longshan Temple Underground Mall: north and south sides.
* Global Mall: floors B1 to 2F.

As of 2022 there are 229 shops within the stations themselves.

===Transit===
Transfers to city bus stations are available at all metro stations. In 2009, transfer volume between the metro and bus systems reached 444,100 transfers per day (counting only EasyCard users). Connections to Taiwan Railway Administration and Taiwan High Speed Rail trains are available at , and . Connections to Taipei Bus Station and Taipei City Hall Bus Station are available at and stations, respectively. The Maokong Gondola is accessible from .

Taipei Songshan Airport is served by the station. A metro system to connect Taipei to Taoyuan International Airport has also been available since March 2017.

Connections with New Taipei Metro is also available, specifically with Circular line and Danhai LRT.

== Rolling stock ==
All rolling stocks on the Taipei Metro are electric multiple units, powered by a third rail at 750 volts direct current. Each train is equipped with automatic train operation (ATO) for a partial or complete automatic train piloting and driverless functions.

===Medium-capacity trains===
The medium-capacity trains of are broad gauge rubber-tired trains with no onboard train operators but are operated remotely by the medium-capacity system operation control center. It initially used a fixed-block automatic train control (ATC) system. Each train consists of two 2-car electric multiple unit (EMU) sets, with a total of 4 cars. The Wenhu line is the only line on the system to have no open-gangway carriages, meaning that passengers cannot move between carriages when the train is moving.

The was initially operated with VAL 256 trains cars, where two VAL 256 cars in the same set would share the same road number. As a result of this numbering scheme, the 102 cars of the VAL fleet have car numbers from 1 to 51. In June 2003, Bombardier was awarded a contract to supply the with 202 INNOVIA APM 256 train cars, to install the CITYFLO 650 moving-block communications-based train control (CBTC) system to replace the fixed-block ATC system and also to retrofit the existing 102 VAL 256 cars with the CITYFLO 650 CBTC system. Integration of Bombardier&#x27;s trains with the existing proved to be difficult in the beginning, with multiple system malfunctions and failures during the first three months of operation. Retrofitting older trains also took longer than expected, as the older trains must undergo several hours of reliability tests during non-service hours. The VAL 256 trains resumed operations in December 2010.

===Heavy-capacity trains===
The heavy-capacity trains have steel wheels and are operated by an on-board train operator. The trains are computer-controlled. The operator, who is both driver and conductor, is responsible for opening and closing the doors and making (not all) announcements. Most announcements are pre-recorded in Mandarin, English, Hokkien and Hakka, with Japanese and Korean at busy stations. The ATC provides the functions of ATP, ATO and ATS and controls all train movements, including braking, acceleration and speed control, but can be manually overridden by the operator in case of an emergency. Newer trains also use a Train Supervision Information System (TSIS) supplied by Mitsubishi Electric that allows the operator to monitor the conditions of the train and identify any faults.

Each train consists of two 3-car Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) sets, with a total of 6 cars. Each 3-car EMU set is permanently coupled as DM–T–M, where DM is the motor car with full-width cab, T is a trailer car and M is the motor car without cab. Each motor car has four 3-phase AC traction motors. The configuration of a 6-car train is DM–T–M+M–T–DM, not interchanged with other car types. Like many contemporary metro rolling stock designs such as the MOVIA by Bombardier, each train features open gangways, allowing passengers to move freely between cars.

All carriages of the heavy-capacity trains are wide by high, and have a total capacity of 368 passengers, 60 of which seated. Their design maximum speed is , which is limited to in service.

The first digit of a DM car is 1, while that of a T car is 2 and that of an M car is 3. This digit then follows the three digits of the set number. For example, C301 set 001/002 consists of carriages 1001-2001-3001+3002-2002-1002.

A single set cannot be in revenue service except C371 single sets 397–399, where their M car is exactly a DM car despite its first digit being 3. These single sets run exclusively on the Xinbeitou and Xiaobitan branch lines. Before the C371 single sets were in revenue service on 22 July 2006, the M cars of C301 sets 013/014 were converted to temporary cab cars to run the Xinbeitou branch.

In 2010, the new C381 was built for Taipei Metro to cope with increasing passenger ridership and the expansion of its network route. Upon entering service on 7 October 2012, three C381 trainsets are servicing the Beitou – Taipower Building segment of the Tamsui and Xindian Lines, with the remaining fleet being put into service on 20 October 2012. These trains provided much-needed capacity increase when the Xinyi and Songshan extensions opened in late 2013. After November 2014, the C381 trains are serving both and . Whereas the earlier heavy capacity train types have largely retained the same design, the C381 sets are more distinctive with double blue stripes and the re-positioning of the logo from the driver&#x27;s door to well below the passenger&#x27;s windows, right on the stripe. Also placed were the more &quot;sleeker&quot; cab and the new advertising screens (as seen in newer Japanese commuter trains such as the E233 series) to improve energy efficiency, although it retains the same propulsion as the C371s.

Taipei Metro also uses a fleet of specialised trains for maintenance of way purposes:
=== Depots ===
The system currently has 9 depots, with more under construction.


== Reception ==


Taipei Metro is one of the most expensive rapid transit systems ever constructed, with phase one of the system costing US$18 billion and phase two estimated to have cost US$13.8 billion.

Despite earlier controversy, by the time the first phase of construction was completed in 2000, it was generally agreed that the metro project was a success, and it has since become an essential part of life in Taipei. The system has been effective in reducing traffic congestion in the city and has spurred the revival of satellite towns (like Tamsui) and development of new areas (like Nangang). The system has also helped to increase average vehicle speed for routes running from New Taipei into Taipei. Property prices along metro routes (both new and existing) tend to increase with the opening of more lines.

Since the Taipei Metro joined the Nova International Railway Benchmarking Group and the Community of Metros (Nova/CoMET) in 2002, it has started collecting and analysing data of the 33 Key Performance Indicators set by Nova/CoMET in order to compare them with those of other metro systems around the world, as a reference to improve its operation. Taipei Metro also has gained keys to success from case studies on different subjects such as safety, reliability, and incidents, and from the operational experiences of other metro systems.

According to a study conducted by the Railway Technology Strategy Center at Imperial College London, and data gathered by Nova/CoMET, the Taipei Metro has ranked number 1 in the world for four consecutive years in terms of reliability, safety, and quality standards (2004–2007). The most congested route sections handle over 38,000 commuters per hour during peak times.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2009 and New Year&#x27;s Day 2010, the Metro system transported 2.17 million passengers in 42 consecutive hours. On 22 April 2010 after 14 years of service, the system achieved the milestone of 4 billion cumulative riders. On 29 December 2010, the system passed the benchmark of 500 million annual passengers for the first time. The record for single day ridership hit 2.5 million passengers during the New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations on 31 December 2010. Following opening of the Xinyi section of , the system reached another record of 2.75 million passengers on 31 December 2013.

In May 2016, the Singapore Transport Minister, Khaw Boon Wan, said that his country&#x27;s rail operators, SBS Transit and SMRT, should emulate the example of Taipei Metro. Speaking at a rail engineering forum, he cited the Taipei Metro&#x27;s timely maintenance and replacement of assets, as well as its fast response to rail network problems. Khaw said the Singapore Land Transport Authority (LTA) is working with the TRTC to attach staff from SBS and SMRT to its metro workshops, so they can learn from its asset maintenance practices and engineering improvements.

== Future expansions ==

Several lines are planned to be added to the network.

=== Wanda–Zhonghe–Shulin line (Light Green line) ===

Wanda–Zhonghe–Shulin is a metro line under construction. Phase 1 will run from to Juguang, Zhonghe, New Taipei. Phase 1 is expected to be completed in 2027.

Phase 2 will connect Zhonghe Senior High School, the previous station of Juguang, to , making the part between Zhonghe Senior High School and Juguang a branch line. The entire line is expected to be fully completed around late 2028.

=== Minsheng–Xizhi line (Sky Blue line) ===
Minsheng–Xizhi is a planned metro line. As of February 2011, New Taipei has been pursuing the construction of the 17.52-km Minsheng–Xizhi line, though the most recent plan was rejected by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, citing the need for further evidence for the line&#x27;s viability. The city plans to re-submit the proposal, and the project is estimated to cost NT$42.2 billion (US$1.44 billion). A possible 4.25-km extension of the line to connect with the planned Keelung light rail is also being considered. The line is planned to be built partially underground and partially elevated. It will begin from Dadaocheng Harbour beneath Minsheng West Road in Taipei, run along Minsheng East and West Roads, pass through Minsheng Community and journey under the Keelung River towards the Neihu District. The line will then change to an elevated mode and reach its termini at Xintai 5th Road in Xizhi District, New Taipei City. As of May 2018, the proposal for this line has been submitted to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, but has yet to be approved.

===2001 typhoon flooding===
On 17 September 2001, Typhoon Nari flooded all underground tracks as well as 16 stations, the heavy-capacity system operation control center, the administration building, and the Nangang Depot. The elevated was not seriously affected and resumed operations the next day. However, the heavy-capacity lines were not restored to full operational status until three months later.

===2014 stabbing attack===

==Controversies==
In early 2021, it was discovered that a pornographic film production company had created a series of sets which copied the design of MRT trains and stations. This caused a brief stir when it was first released as many were concerned that the films had been shot on actual MRT trains and stations. Nevertheless, it was still condemned by Taipei MRT for imitating its train carriages.

<doc id="900779" wikidata="Q12058841" url="?curid=900779" title="Gore (road)">
<text>In road and highway construction, a gore (or nose in modern British English) is a triangular plot of land as designated when a road forks at the intersection with second road, or merges on and off from a larger one. A &quot;virtual&quot; (or theoretical) gore is a triangular shaped space, characteristically marked off with distinguishing highway paint, often found leading to the unpaved area of a larger physical gore.

The term &quot;gore&quot; (describing a space) is a historic one, representing a characteristically triangular piece of land, often designated incidentally when two surveys failed to meet. Etymologically it is derived from , meaning spear. 

A theoretical gore is commonly marked with transverse or chevron painted lines (much as traffic islands) at both entrance and exit ramps. These help separate drivers on the mainline from those entering and exiting the highway, and also aid the latter category of drivers in regulating their speed while accelerating and decelerating. Gores at exit ramps occasionally feature impact attenuators, especially when something solid follows the theoretical or physical gore, such as a bridge abutment.

In the US, at the &quot;theoretical gore point&quot;, a dotted white line becomes a wide solid white channelizing line and another wide solid white line angles off along the edge of the diverging road, forming an elongated white triangle in front of the gore. This as a &quot;neutral area&quot; with white chevron markings optionally added.

<doc id="900780" wikidata="Q211693" url="?curid=900780" title="200 Motels">
<text>200 Motels is a 1971 surrealist musical film written and directed by Frank Zappa and Tony Palmer, and featuring music by Zappa. An international co-production of United States and the United Kingdom, the film stars the Mothers of Invention, Theodore Bikel, Keith Moon and Ringo Starr.

A soundtrack album was released in the same year, with a slightly different selection of music.

==Plot==
The film attempts to portray the craziness of life on the road as a rock musician, and as such consists of a series of unconnected nonsense vignettes interspersed with concert footage of the Mothers of Invention. Ostensibly, while on tour The Mothers of Invention go crazy in the small fictional town of Centerville (&quot;a real nice place to raise your kids up&quot;), wander around, and get beaten up in &quot;Redneck Eats&quot;, a cowboy bar. In an animated interlude passed off as a &quot;dental hygiene movie&quot;, bassist &quot;Jeff&quot;, tired of playing what he refers to as &quot;Zappa&#x27;s comedy music&quot;, is persuaded by his bad conscience to quit the group, as did his real-life counterpart Jeff Simmons. Simmons was replaced by Martin Lickert (who was Starr&#x27;s chauffeur) for the film. Almost every scene is drenched with video special effects (double and triple exposures, solarisation, false color, speed changes, etc.) which were innovative in 1971. The film has been dubbed a &quot;surrealistic documentary&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
Principal scenes of &quot;200 Motels&quot;, including the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, were filmed in a week at Pinewood Studios outside London, and featured The Mothers of Invention, The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Ringo Starr, Theodore Bikel, and Keith Moon. Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting. However, director Tony Palmer (on his 2009 reissue of &quot;200 Motels&quot;) claims that all elements of the script derived from Zappa&#x27;s trunk&#x27;s worth of material were completed during production. It was the first feature film photographed on videotape and transferred to 35 mm film, a process that allowed for novel visual effects.

==Release and reception==
United Artists&#x27; press kit for the film stated &quot;For the audience that already knows and appreciates THE MOTHERS, [it] will provide a logical extension of our concerts and recordings.&quot; The film premiere was shown at Doheny Plaza Theater in Hollywood, California to mixed reviews. &quot;200 Motels&quot; currently holds a 57% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on seven reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, saying that the film; &quot;is a joyous, fanatic, slightly weird experiment in the uses of the color videotape process&quot;, and also stating; &quot;It assaults the mind with everything on hand&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to &quot;200 Motels&quot; was released by United Artists Records on October 4, 1971, and features a combination of rock and jazz songs, orchestral music and comedic spoken dialogue. The rock and comedy songs &quot;Mystery Roach&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Cowboy Burt&quot;, &quot;Daddy, Daddy, Daddy&quot;, &quot;What Will This Evening Bring Me This Morning&quot; and &quot;Magic Fingers&quot;, and the finale &quot;Strictly Genteel&quot;, which mixes orchestral and rock elements, were noted as highlights of the album by reviewer Richie Unterberger.

The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the Royal Albert Hall after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract. When &quot;Penis Dimension&quot; was played to the judge, Mr Justice Mocatta, he responded &quot;Have I got to listen to this?&quot;. The UK première was not until 29 October 2013, almost 20 years after Zappa&#x27;s death.

The album was not released on compact disc until 1997, as a result of a licensing deal between Rykodisc (at the time the licensee for all of Zappa&#x27;s other albums from the Zappa Family Trust (ZFT), numbering over 60 titles) and MGM allowing them to re-release numerous rare movie-musical soundtracks on CD. With the addition of this title, Ryko was finally able to offer the complete catalog of official Zappa recordings, as numerous legal proceedings both during Zappa&#x27;s lifetime and afterwards failed to cede ownership of the rights and tapes to ZFT. That 2-CD edition, now out of print, contained extensive liner notes and artwork as well as a small poster for the film, as well as bonus tracks consisting of radio promos for the film and the single edit of the song &quot;Magic Fingers&quot;.

Though many Zappa fans consider this album a key recording of the period, it was deemed by some music critics to be a peripheral album. AllMusic&#x27;s Richie Unterberger critiqued what he referred to as the &quot;growing tendency to deploy the smutty, cheap humor that would soon dominate much of Zappa&#x27;s work&quot;, but said that &quot;Those who like his late-&#x27;60s/early-&#x27;70s work [...] will probably like this fine&quot;.

==Legacy==
After &quot;200 Motels&quot;, the band went on tour; the live album &quot;Just Another Band From L.A.&quot; included the 20-minute track &quot;Billy the Mountain&quot;, Zappa&#x27;s satire on rock opera set in Southern California. This track was representative of the band&#x27;s theatrical performances in which songs were used to build up sketches based on &quot;200 Motels&quot; scenes as well as new situations often portraying the band members&#x27; sexual encounters on the road.

A show was produced in 2018 in France (Festival Musica Strasbourg and Philharmonie de Paris), staged by Antoine Gindt and conducted by Léo Warynski. This production is revivaled in Opéra de Nice in December 2023.

<text>Since Maine became a U.S. State in 1820 it has sent congressional delegations to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives, beginning with the 17th United States Congress. Each state elects two senators to serve for six years, and members of the House to two-year terms. Each state elects two senators to serve for six years in general elections, with their re-election staggered. Prior to the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, senators were elected by the Maine Legislature. Each state elects varying numbers of members of the House, depending on population, to two-year terms. Maine has sent two members to the House in each congressional delegation since the 1960 United States census.

The current dean, or longest-serving member, of the Maine delegation is Senator Susan Collins, having served in the Senate since 1997.

<doc id="900796" wikidata="Q2583981" url="?curid=900796" title="Drunken Lullabies">
<text>Drunken Lullabies is the second studio album by the Irish-American punk band Flogging Molly. Their first album to feature guitarist Dennis Casey, it reached number 157 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. It has since been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

The title track &quot;Drunken Lullabies&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot; as well as the Fat Wreck Chords compilation &quot;Rock Against Bush, Vol. 2&quot;.

==Reception==
AllMusic gave the album a positive review. The review called the title track a standout and noted its themes of &quot;decrying the ills of modern society&quot; as well as its &quot;breakneck speed&quot;. It also referred to the song &quot;Death Valley Queen&quot; as a &quot;dirge of Dylanesque proportions.&quot; The reviewer concluded that &quot;After one listen, you&#x27;ll probably wish you were Irish.&quot;
In a four-star review, Punknews.org said that Flogging Molly &quot;sounds authentic&quot; and named &quot;What&#x27;s Left of the Flag&quot;, &quot;Rebels of the Sacred Heart&quot; and &quot;The Rare Ould Times&quot; as the standout tracks.

<doc id="900798" wikidata="Q2587899" url="?curid=900798" title="Fecundity">
<text>Fecundity is defined in two ways; in human demography, it is the potential for reproduction of a recorded population as opposed to a sole organism, while in population biology, it is considered similar to fertility, the natural capability to produce offspring, measured by the number of gametes (eggs), seed set, or asexual propagules.

== Human demography ==
Human demography considers only human fecundity, at its culturally differing rates, while population biology studies all organisms. The term &quot;fecundity&quot; in population biology is often used to describe the rate of offspring production after one time step (often annual). In this sense, fecundity may include both birth rates and survival of young to that time step. While levels of fecundity vary geographically, it is generally a consistent feature of each culture. &quot;Fecundation&quot; is another term for fertilization.

In obstetrics and gynecology, fecund-ability is the probability of being pregnant in a single menstrual cycle, and fecundity is the probability of achieving a live birth within a single cycle.

== Population ecology ==
In ecology, fecundity is a measure of the reproductive capacity of an individual or population, typically restricted to the reproductive individuals. It can be equally applied to sexual and asexual reproduction, as the purpose of fecundity is to measure how many new individuals are being added to a population. Fecundity may be defined differently for different ecological studies to explain the specific data the study examined. For example, some studies use apparent fecundity to describe that their data looks at a particular moment in time rather than the species&#x27; entire life span. In other studies, these definitions are changed to better quantify fecundity for the organism in question. This need is particularly true for modular organisms, as their modular organization differs from the more typical unitary organism, in which fecundity is best defined through a count of offspring.

=== Life history patterns (parity) ===
Parity is the organization of fecundity into two distinct types, semelparity, and iteroparity.

Semelparity occurs when an organism reproduces only once in its lifetime, with death being a part of its reproductive strategy. These species produce many offspring during their one reproductive event, giving them a potential advantage when it comes to fecundity, as they are producing more offspring.

Iteroparity is when a species reproduces multiple times over its lifetime. This species&#x27; strategy is to protect against the unpredictable survivability of their offspring, in which if their first litter of offspring dies, they can reproduce again and replace the dead offspring. It also allows the organism to care for its offspring, as they will be alive during their development.

=== Factors affecting fecundity ===
There are a multitude of factors that potentially affect the rates of fecundity. For example: ontogeny, population density and latitude.

Ontogeny

Fecundity in iteroparous organisms often increases with age but can decline at older ages. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this relationship. For species with declining growth rates after maturity, the suggestion is that as the organism&#x27;s growth rate decreases, more resources can be allocated to reproduction. Other possible explanations exist for this pattern for organisms that do not grow after maturity. These explanations include: increased competence of older individuals; less fit individuals have already died off; or since life expectancy decreases with age, older individuals may allocate more resources to reproduction at the expense of survival. In semelparous species, age is frequently a poor predictor of fecundity. In these cases, size is likely a better predictor.

==== &quot;Population density&quot; ====
Population density is often observed to negatively affect fecundity, making fecundity density-dependent. The reasoning behind this observation is that once an area is overcrowded, fewer resources are available for each individual. Thus there may be insufficient energy to reproduce in high numbers when offspring survival is low. Occasionally high density can stimulate the production of offspring, particularly in plant species, because if there are more plants, there is food to lure pollinators, who will then spread that plant&#x27;s pollen and allow for more reproduction.

==== &quot;Latitude&quot; ====
There are many different hypotheses to explain the relationship between latitude and fecundity. One claimed that fecundity increases predictably with increasing latitude. Reginald Morean proposed this hypothesis, the explanation being that there is higher mortality in seasonal environments.

A different hypothesis by David Lack attributed the positive relationship to the change in daylight hours found with changing latitudes. These differing daylight hours, in turn, change the hours in which a parent can collect food. He also accounts for a drop in fecundity at the poles due to their extreme amounts of day lengths, which can exhaust the parent.

Fecundity intensity due to seasonality is a hypothesis proposed by Phillip Ashmole. He suggests latitude affects fecundity due to seasonality increasing with increasing latitudes. This theory relies on the mortality concept proposed by Moreau but focuses on how seasonality affects mortality and, in turn, population densities. Thus in places with higher mortality, there is more food availability, leading to higher fecundity. Another hypothesis claims that seasonality affects fecundity due to varying lengths of breeding seasons. This idea suggests that shorter breeding seasons select a larger clutch size to compensate for the reduced reproduction frequency, thus increasing those species&#x27; fecundity.

=== Fecundity and fitness ===
Fecundity is a significant component of fitness. Fecundity selection builds on that idea. This idea claims that the genetic selection of traits that increase an organism&#x27;s fecundity is, in turn, advantageous to an organism&#x27;s fitness.

Fecundity Schedule

Fecundity Schedules are data tables that display the patterns of birth amongst individuals of different ages in a population. These are typically found in life tables under the columns Fx and mx.

Fx lists the total number of young produced by each age class, and mx is the mean number of young produced, found by finding the number of young produced per surviving individual. For example, if you have 12 individuals in an age class and they produced 16 surviving young, the Fx is 16, and the mx is 1.336.

== Infecundity ==
Infecundity is a term meaning &quot;inability to conceive after several years of exposure to the risk of pregnancy.&quot; This usage is prevalent in medicine, especially reproductive medicine, and in demographics. &quot;Infecundity&quot; would be synonymous with &quot;infertility&quot;, but in demographic and medical use &quot;fertility&quot; (and thus its antonym &quot;infertility&quot;) may refer to quantity and rates of offspring produced, rather than any physiological or other limitations on reproduction.

== Additional information ==
Additionally, social trends and societal norms may influence fecundity, though this influence tends to be temporary. Indeed, it is considered impossible to cease reproduction based on social factors, and fecundity tends to rise after a brief decline.

Fecundity has also been shown to increase in ungulates with relation to warmer weather.

In sexual evolutionary biology, especially in sexual selection, fecundity is contrasted to reproductivity.

<text>A whaleboat is a type of open boat that was used for catching whales, or a boat of similar design that retained the name when used for a different purpose. Some whaleboats were used from whaling ships. Other whaleboats would operate from the shore. Later whaleboats usually could operate under sail or oar - American whaling crews in particular obtained better results by making their first approach to a whale under sail, then quickly unstepping the mast and using oars thereafter.

Most whaleboats have double-ended, clinker-built hulls of light construction. The hulls were narrow and with sharp ends to achieve the best possible speed for the length of waterline. Length was between 27 and 31 feet. Beam was just over a fifth of the length. Typically they were propelled by five oars when rowed, and stepped a single removable mast when under sail. A rudder was used when under sail and a steering oar when the boat was rowed. The latter provided the manoeuvrability needed when closing with a harpooned whale.

Outside of whaling, whaleboats were well thought of for their seaworthiness and as a useful compromise between optimisation for sail or oar. They were therefore used as a type of ship&#x27;s boat and for other utility purposes. Many of these derivative types varied from the whale-hunting types to some extent - for instance the Montagu whaler was a somewhat sturdier version with slightly fuller lines, but still retaining, for example, the five oars, clinker build, double ends and a reputation for seaworthiness.

==History==
The early history of whaleboats includes a &quot;c.&quot; 1335 image of Basque whalers working from a double-ended boat of this type. The similarity of the whaleboat to the Shetland sixern has been commented on - suggesting a Norse design heritage. An early 1600s description of whale-hunting from a whaleboat follows closely the methods of New Bedford whalers in the 1870s. There is little information on the actual boats used in the 1600s, but with a whaleship of that time carrying half a dozen or more whaleboats, they are likely to have been specialised types. Illustrations from 1711 and the 1720s show double-ended whaleboats with a crew of six, single-banked oars and a steering oar. The bollards (loggerheads in American terminology) on which the whale-rope would be controlled are clearly depicted. There is no evidence of sails being used in on whale-boats before 1825, but this soon became the preferred technique of approaching a whale prior to harpooning. (The crew would rapidly unstep the mast as the harpooned whale moved off, towing the boat behind.) Boats became more optimised for sailing, with slightly more beam and less slack bilges in the section (to give greater stability); by the 1850s centreboards were common. The last whaleships to carry whaleboats worked under oar and sail operated in the 1920s.

== Modern applications and derivative designs ==
Today whaleboats are used as safety vessels aboard some marine vessels. The United States Coast Guard has used them since 1791 and stopped using them some time in the 1900s for motorized lifeboats. Their simple open structure allows for easy access and personnel loading in the event of an emergency. Some USCG whaleboats were used as lifeboats, with standardized equipment such as a hatchet, compass, sea anchor, emergency signal mirror, drinking water, first aid kit, jack knife with can opener, bilge pump, and other emergency provisions.

On modern warships, a relatively light and seaworthy double-ender for transport of ship&#x27;s crew may be referred to as a &quot;whaleboat&quot; or &quot;whaler&quot;. Many have fuller hulls with more capacity, but far more drag.

Monomoy surfboats, a lifeboat directly descended from whaleboats, are used for recreational and competitive rowing in the San Francisco Bay Area and coastal Massachusetts.

The Tancook Schooner descends from whaleboats through the tancook whaler, a double-ended design optimized for sail.

== Uses in war ==
Whaleboats were also extensively used in warfare. Colonel Benjamin Church is credited with pioneering their use for amphibious operations against Abenaki and Mi&#x27;kmaq tribes in what is today Maine and Acadia. His troops, New England colonial forces and Native allies from southern New England, used them as early as 1696 (during King William&#x27;s War). Others in the Northeastern borderlands followed suit and they were used throughout the imperial conflicts of the early 18th century, and extensively used by both British and colonial troops during the French and Indian War. Units that made extensive use of whaleboats were the 7th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment at the siege of Louisburg in 1745, often referred to as &quot;the whaleboat regiment&quot;, and Gorham&#x27;s Rangers, formed in 1744, initially a company of Indians mainly from Cape Cod, many of whom were employed as whalers, and which later evolved into a British Army ranger company in the 1750s and 1760s. John Bradstreet&#x27;s Bateaux and Transport service, a corps of armed boatmen tasked with moving supplies on inland waterways during the French and Indian War also used whaleboats extensively. In 1772, American colonials used whaleboats to attack and destroy the Gaspee in Narragansett Bay. During the American Revolutionary War, there were many whaleboat raids, including one with 230 men led by Return J. Meigs Sr. to sack Sag Harbor on Long Island in 1777. On December 7, 1782, two fleets of whaleboats fought a bloody battle on Long Island Sound known as the Boats Fight. During the desperate hand-to-hand conflict, every man involved was either killed or injured.

== Construction and use ==
The whaleboat was originally a lapstrake design, clearly in the Northern European building tradition that created the longship and the yole. Its &quot;superior handling characteristics soon made it a popular general-purpose ship&#x27;s boat&quot;. In the first half of the 20th century, many navies carried whaleboats on their warships, such as the 27ft whalers used in the Royal Navy. 

Whaleboats were equipped with a mast, which was stepped immediately after launching. The preferred whale-hunting technique was to approach a target whale under sail, as this was less likely to startle the animal than under oars. In light winds, paddles were used as these created less noise than oars. Boats used strictly for whaling often used only a long steering oar, while those used as ship&#x27;s boats often had dismountable pintle-and-gudgeon rudders as well. A main sail, and occasionally a jib were used. After 1850 most were fitted with a centreboard.

<text>Henry Campbell Liken McCullough (21 July 1943 – 14 June 2016) was a musician and singer-songwriter from Northern Ireland. He was best known for his work as a member of Spooky Tooth, The Grease Band and Paul McCartney and Wings. He also performed and recorded as a solo artist and session musician.

==Early life==
McCullough was born in Portstewart, County Londonderry, to a Protestant family. He first came to prominence in the early 1960s as the teenage lead guitarist with the Skyrockets showband from Enniskillen. 

In 1964, with three other members of the Skyrockets, he left and formed a new showband fronted by South African- born vocalist Gene Chetty, which they named Gene and the Gents. In 1967, McCullough moved to Belfast where he joined Chris Stewart (bass), Ernie Graham (vocals) and Dave Lutton (drums) to form the psychedelic band the People. Later that year the band moved to London and were signed by Chas Chandler&#x27;s management team, who changed the group&#x27;s name to Éire Apparent. Under Chandler&#x27;s guidance after a single release they toured with groups such as Pink Floyd, Soft Machine, the Move and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, as well as Eric Burdon and the Animals. In mid-February 1968, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, while the band was touring with the Animals, McCullough returned to the United Kingdom, officially because of &quot;visa problems&quot;, and Mick Cox flew out to take his place in the band. Back in Ireland, around May 1968, McCullough joined folk group Sweeney&#x27;s Men.

==1970s==
McCullough returned to London around 1969 to work with Joe Cocker as a member of his backing band, the Grease Band. With Cocker he toured the U.S. and performed at the Woodstock Festival. He later played on the Grease Band&#x27;s eponymous album. During his time with the band he appeared as lead guitarist on the studio album of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1970) and on the progressive Spooky Tooth album &quot;The Last Puff&quot; (1970).

In January 1972 Paul McCartney asked McCullough to join his new band, Wings, with an eye toward starting a tour of British universities. McCullough&#x27;s first recording with Wings was the February 1972 protest single, &quot;Give Ireland Back to the Irish&quot;. The song, which expressed outrage at the events of Bloody Sunday, proved controversial. McCartney was accused by the British media of expressing support for the Irish Republican Army, and author Howard Sounes suggests that McCullough, as an Ulster Protestant with British unionist sympathies, may have had his misgivings about releasing the song as a single. He spent more than a year in the band, playing lead guitar on several singles, including &quot;Hi, Hi, Hi&quot;, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; and &quot;My Love&quot;, as well as on the album &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot;. Musical and business differences with McCartney, however, saw McCullough leave on the eve of the &quot;Band on the Run&quot; sessions in August 1973.

McCullough&#x27;s spoken words &quot;I don&#x27;t know; I was really drunk at the time&quot; can be heard on the Pink Floyd album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973), at the end of the song &quot;Money&quot;. He was recalling a fight he had the night before with his wife.

In 1975 McCullough joined the Frankie Miller Band with bassist Chris Stewart, keyboard player Mick Weaver and drummer Stu Perry. They recorded the album, &quot;The Rock&quot; with Miller. Later the same year McCullough released &quot;Mind Your Own Business&quot; on George Harrison&#x27;s Dark Horse label.

McCullough played concerts as a session musician with Roy Harper, Frankie Miller, Eric Burdon, Marianne Faithfull, Ronnie Lane and Donovan. In 1977 he temporarily joined Dr. Feelgood, following the departure of Wilko Johnson.

==1980s==

Recovering from an injury to his hand while visiting his family in 1980, McCullough decided to stay in Ireland. He began to sit in with old friends the Fleadh Cowboys, at their Sunday afternoon residency in The Lower Deck in Dublin. Following this he moved back to Portstewart and put a new band together. He was joined by Percy Robinson on pedal steel guitar, Roe Butcher on bass and Liam Bradley on drums.

==1990s==
In 1998 McCullough travelled to Poland, where he rehearsed with a band of Polish musicians for a tour. After the tour, they recorded a &#x27;live&#x27; album which was released as &quot;Blue Sunset&quot;. This was followed by a further Polish tour. On returning home, McCullough recorded and released &quot;Failed Christian&quot;, a song that has since been covered by Nick Lowe on his album &quot;Dig My Mood&quot;.

==2000s==

McCullough continued to record and perform and released solo material, including &quot;Belfast To Boston&quot; (2001) and &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; (2003). The latter contained his 1998 single, &quot;Failed Christian&quot;. McCullough performed at concerts in Northern Ireland and Scotland, playing with a backing band (featuring Stephen Quinn on drums and Sean McCarron on saxophone).

McCullough contributed guitar on and organised the band for the Alaskan musician, The Rev Neil Down&#x27;s 2003 release, &quot;When A Wrong Turns Right&quot;. &quot;The Henry McCullough Band – FBI Live&quot; was released in 2007 on Mundell music, from a recording at The Famous Bein Inn in 2006.

In 2007, Over the Rhine covered &quot;Failed Christian&quot; on their album, &quot;Live from Nowhere, Vol. II&quot;.
In the same year, McCullough started to work with Dave Sharp from The Alarm) and together they enlisted keyboard player Zoot Money, bassist Gary Fletcher and drummer Colin Allen, a line up which became known as the Hard Travelers. In January 2008 the Hard Travelers performed their debut gig at The Cellars in Portsmouth.

In 2008 McCullough recorded &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Moon&quot; at Amberville Studios, which was released in Ireland only on 5 September 2008. and featured new McCullough compositions. The album also included a number of songs co-written with poet Eamon Carr from Horslips and included the single &quot;Too Late to Worry&quot;. Among the musicians featured on the album were keyboard player James Delaney, bassists Roe Butcher and Nicky Scott (also double bass), keyboard player Enda Walsh, drummer Adie McIlduff and Percy Robinson on dobro and pedal steel guitar. The album also included drum sequences by Peter McKinney.

At the end of 2007 he worked on the album &quot;Dark Nite of the Soul&quot; with Jeff Greene, as well as other musical collaborations recorded at Wind-Mill Lane Studios, Dublin; Metropolis Studios, London; and The Sound Kitchen, Nashville. McCullough attended Paul McCartney&#x27;s concert at the O2 in Dublin on 20 December 2009 and McCartney publicly acknowledged McCullough&#x27;s contribution to Wings. On 13 March 2010, McCullough and his band were the headline act at the Fifestock Festival at the Inn at Lathones, Scotland.

==2010s==
McCullough remained active in the European music scene and played regular live gigs with artists including Ed Deane, James Delaney, Noel Bridgeman, also John Quearney. In 2011 Henry collaborated with songwriter Paul Doherty and the Vals on the track &quot;Look to the One&quot;. The song gained worldwide airplay, with McCullough contributing backing vocals and guitar.

==Health problems and death==
McCullough suffered a heart attack in November 2012, leaving him in critical condition. His death was mistakenly reported on Ronan Collins&#x27;s RTÉ Radio 1 show on 7 November and the BBC also apologised after prematurely reporting his death. In an interview with website Something Else, Denny Seiwell, who had played with McCullough in Wings, stated that it was doubtful McCullough would make a complete recovery.

On 17 March 2015, a benefit concert for McCullough was held at the Half Moon music venue in Putney, featuring Paul Carrack, Nick Lowe, Andy Fairweather Low, Suggs and Bobby Tench (who also performed with the backing band). The backing band was named Henry&#x27;s Heroes, and included Tim Hinkley, Mel Collins, Neil Hubbard and John Halsey and bass player Kuma Harada.

On 14 June 2016, his wife Josie confirmed that McCullough had died at his home at Ballywindelland, Ballymoney, County Antrim, earlier that morning after a long illness. He had never fully recovered from the heart attack he suffered in 2012. Some sources state he also suffered a major stroke.

<text>Kakuro or Kakkuro or Kakoro () is a kind of logic puzzle that is often referred to as a mathematical transliteration of the crossword. Kakuro puzzles are regular features in many math-and-logic puzzle publications across the world. In 1966, Canadian Jacob E. Funk, an employee of Dell Magazines, came up with the original English name &quot;Cross Sums&quot; and other names such as &quot;Cross Addition&quot; have also been used, but the Japanese name &quot;Kakuro,&quot; abbreviation of Japanese &quot;kasan kurosu&quot; (加算クロス, &quot;addition cross&quot;), seems to have gained general acceptance and the puzzles appear to be titled this way now in most publications. The popularity of Kakuro in Japan is immense, second only to Sudoku among Nikoli&#x27;s famed logic-puzzle offerings.

The canonical Kakuro puzzle is played in a grid of filled and barred cells, &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; respectively. Puzzles are usually 16×16 in size, although these dimensions can vary widely. Apart from the top row and leftmost column which are entirely black, the grid is divided into &quot;entries&quot;—lines of white cells—by the black cells. The black cells contain a diagonal slash from upper-left to lower-right and a number in one or both halves, such that each horizontal entry has a number in the half-cell to its immediate left and each vertical entry has a number in the half-cell immediately above it. These numbers, borrowing crossword terminology, are commonly called &quot;clues&quot;.

The objective of the puzzle is to insert a digit from 1 to 9 inclusive into each white cell so that the sum of the numbers in each entry matches the clue associated with it and that no digit is duplicated in any entry. It is that lack of duplication that makes creating Kakuro puzzles with unique solutions possible. Like Sudoku, solving a Kakuro puzzle involves investigating combinations and permutations. There is an unwritten rule for making Kakuro puzzles that each clue must have at least two numbers that add up to it, since including only one number is mathematically trivial when solving Kakuro puzzles.

At least one publisher includes the constraint that a given combination of numbers can only be used once in each grid, but still markets the puzzles as plain Kakuro.

Some publishers prefer to print their Kakuro grids exactly like crossword grids, with no labeling in the black cells and instead numbering the entries, providing a separate list of the clues akin to a list of crossword clues. (This eliminates the row and column that are entirely black.) This is purely an issue of image and does not affect either the solution nor the logic required for solving.

In discussing Kakuro puzzles and tactics, the typical shorthand for referring to an entry is &quot;(clue, in numerals)-in-(number of cells in entry, spelled out)&quot;, such as &quot;16-in-two&quot; and &quot;25-in-five&quot;. The exception is what would otherwise be called the &quot;45-in-nine&quot;—simply &quot;45&quot; is used, since the &quot;-in-nine&quot; is mathematically implied (nine cells is the longest possible entry, and since it cannot duplicate a digit it must consist of all the digits from 1 to 9 once). Curiously, both &quot;43-in-eight&quot; and &quot;44-in-eight&quot; are still frequently called as such, despite the &quot;-in-eight&quot; suffix being equally implied.

==Solving techniques==

===Combinatoric techniques===

Although brute-force guessing is possible, a more efficient approach is the understanding of the various combinatorial forms that entries can take for various pairings of clues and entry lengths. The solution space can be reduced by resolving allowable intersections of horizontal and vertical sums, or by considering necessary or missing values.

Those entries with sufficiently large or small clues for their length will have fewer possible combinations to consider, and by comparing them with entries that cross them, the proper permutation—or part of it—can be derived. The simplest example is where a 3-in-two crosses a 4-in-two: the 3-in-two must consist of &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; in some order; the 4-in-two (since &quot;2&quot; cannot be duplicated) must consist of &quot;1&quot; and &quot;3&quot; in some order. Therefore, their intersection must be &quot;1&quot;, the only digit they have in common.

When solving longer sums there are additional ways to find clues to locating the correct digits. One such method would be to note where a few squares together share possible values thereby eliminating the possibility that other squares in that sum could have those values. For instance, if two 4-in-two clues cross with a longer sum, then the 1 and 3 in the solution must be in those two squares and those digits cannot be used elsewhere in that sum.

When solving sums that have a limited number of solution sets then that can lead to useful clues. For instance, a 30-in-seven sum only has two solution sets: {1,2,3,4,5,6,9} and {1,2,3,4,5,7,8}. If one of the squares in that sum can only take on the values of {8,9} (if the crossing clue is a 17-in-two sum, for example) then that not only becomes an indicator of which solution set fits this sum, it eliminates the possibility of any other digit in the sum being either of those two values, even before determining which of the two values fits in that square.

Another useful approach in more complex puzzles is to identify which square a digit goes in by eliminating other locations within the sum. If all of the crossing clues of a sum have many possible values, but it can be determined that there is only one square that could have a particular value which the sum in question must have, then whatever other possible values the crossing sum would allow, that intersection must be the isolated value. For example, a 36-in-eight sum must contain all digits except 9. If only one of the squares could take on the value of 2 then that must be the answer for that square.

===Box technique===

A &quot;box technique&quot; can also be applied on occasion, when the geometry of the unfilled white cells at any given stage of solving lends itself to it: by summing the clues for a series of horizontal entries (subtracting out the values of any digits already added to those entries) and subtracting the clues for a mostly overlapping series of vertical entries, the difference can reveal the value of a partial entry, often a single cell. This technique works because addition is both associative and commutative.

It is common practice to mark potential values for cells in the cell corners until all but one have been proven impossible; for particularly challenging puzzles, sometimes entire ranges of values for cells are noted by solvers in the hope of eventually finding sufficient constraints to those ranges from crossing entries to be able to narrow the ranges to single values. Because of space constraints, instead of digits, some solvers use a positional notation, where a potential numerical value is represented by a mark in a particular part of the cell, which makes it easy to place several potential values into a single cell. This also makes it easier to distinguish potential values from solution values.

Some solvers also use graph paper to try various digit combinations before writing them into the puzzle grids.

As in the Sudoku case, only relatively easy Kakuro puzzles can be solved with the above-mentioned techniques. Harder ones require the use of various types of chain patterns, the same kinds as appear in Sudoku (see &quot;Pattern-Based Constraint Satisfaction and Logic Puzzles&quot;).

==Mathematics of Kakuro==

Mathematically, Kakuro puzzles can be represented as integer programming problems, and are NP-complete. See also Yato and Seta, 2004.

There are two kinds of mathematical symmetry readily identifiable in Kakuro puzzles: minimum and maximum constraints are duals, as are missing and required values.

All sum combinations can be represented using a bitmapped representation. This representation is useful for determining missing and required values using bitwise logic operations.

==Popularity==
Kakuro puzzles appear in nearly 100 Japanese magazines and newspapers. Kakuro remained the most popular logic puzzle in Japanese printed press until 1992, when Sudoku took the top spot. In the UK, they first appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, with &quot;The Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; following.

<text>Swagger is the debut studio album by the Celtic punk band Flogging Molly, mixed by Steve Albini. It was released in 2000.

== Reception ==
In a very positive review, AllMusic called &quot;Swagger&quot; a combination of the &quot;folk of the Pogues with an Oi! blast by way of the Dropkick Murphys&quot;. The reviewer went on to call the album &quot;music that&#x27;s perfect for any barroom brawl.&quot;
Punknews.org gave the album 5 out of 5 stars and said that &quot;every song is a keeper, without a clunker in the bunch&quot;. The review also called &quot;Salty Dog&quot; the &quot;quintessential Flogging Molly song&quot; and noted the album&#x27;s contrast between aggressive punk-influenced songs and slower ballads like &quot;The Worst Day Since Yesterday&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
*&quot;The Worst Day Since Yesterday&quot; was used as the music for the opening and closing montage in &quot;&quot; season 1, episode 9, &quot;Life&quot; (first broadcast November 20, 2009).
*&quot;The Worst Day Since Yesterday&quot; was heard in the background in the bar scene in &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&quot;.
*&quot;Selfish Man&quot; was used during the closing scene, and over the closing credits, of the fourth episode of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Brotherhood&quot;.
*&quot;The Ol&#x27; Beggars Bush&quot; was playing the bar when Dean picked up Rory in the fourth-season episode &quot;Last Week Fights, This Week Tights&quot; of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.
*&quot;Devil&#x27;s Dance Floor&quot; was used in &quot;Derry Girls&quot;, episode 5 of series 1.

<doc id="900808" wikidata="Q4774332" url="?curid=900808" title="Anti-circumvention">
<text>Anti-circumvention refers to laws which prohibit the circumvention of technological barriers for using a digital good in certain ways which the rightsholders do not wish to allow. The requirement for anti-circumvention laws was globalized in 1996 with the creation of the World Intellectual Property Organization&#x27;s Copyright Treaty.

== Background ==
Article 11 of WIPO Copyright Treaty &quot;Obligations concerning Technological Measures&quot; requires contracting parties to

&quot;...provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that are used by authors in connection with the exercise of their rights under this Treaty or the Berne Convention and that restrict acts, in respect of their works, which are not authorized by the authors concerned or permitted by law.&quot;
Article 12 of WIPO Copyright Treaty &quot;Obligations concerning Rights Management Information&quot;
requires contracting parties to

&quot;...provide adequate and effective legal remedies against any person knowingly performing any of the following acts knowing, or with respect to civil remedies having reasonable grounds to know, that it will induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement of any right covered by this Treaty or the Berne Convention:

(i) to remove or alter any electronic rights management information without permission;

(ii) to distribute, import for distribution, broadcast or communicate to the public, without authority, works or copies of works knowing that electronic rights management information has been removed or altered without authority.&quot;
==Law by region==

===European Union===
The following anti-circumventing rules were implemented in European Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the council of on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

This directive states in article 6, &#x27;Obligations as to technological measures&#x27;:
# Member States shall provide adequate legal protection against the circumvention of any effective technological measures, which the person concerned carries out in the knowledge, or with reasonable grounds to know, that he or she is pursuing that objective.
# Member States shall provide adequate legal protection against the manufacture, import, distribution, sale, rental, advertisement for sale or rental, or possession for commercial purposes of devices, products or components or the provision of services which:
#*(a) are promoted, advertised or marketed for the purpose of circumvention of, or
#*(b) have only a limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent, or
#*(c) are primarily designed, produced, adapted or performed for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the circumvention of, any effective technological measures.
# For the purposes of this Directive, the expression &#x27;technological measures&#x27; means any technology, device or component that, in the normal course of its operation, is designed to prevent or restrict acts, in respect of works or other subject matter, which are not authorised by the rights holder of any copyright or any right related to copyright as provided for by law or the &quot;sui generis&quot; right provided for in Chapter III of Directive 96/9/EC. Technological measures shall be deemed &#x27;effective&#x27; where the use of a protected work or other subject matter is controlled by the rights holders through application of an access control or protection process, such as encryption, scrambling or other transformation of the work or other subject-matter or a copy control mechanism, which achieves the protection objective.
# Notwithstanding the legal protection provided for in paragraph 1, in the absence of voluntary measures taken by rights holders, including agreements between rights holders and other parties concerned, Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that rights holders make available to the beneficiary of an exception or limitation provided for in national law in accordance with Article 5(2)(a), (2)(c), (2)(d), (2)(e), (3)(a), (3)(b) or (3)(e) the means of benefiting from that exception or limitation, to the extent necessary to benefit from that exception or limitation and where that beneficiary has legal access to the protected work or subject-matter concerned. (...)

===United States===
In the United States, the &quot;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&quot; (&quot;DMCA&quot;) has implemented the treaty provisions regarding the circumvention of some technological barriers to copying intellectual property.

====Circumvention of Access Controls====
Section 103 (17 U.S.C Sec. 1201(a)(1)) of the DMCA states:
No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.

The Act defines what it means in Section 1201(a)(3):

(3) As used in this subsection—
(A) to &quot;circumvent a technological measure&quot; means to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner; and
(B) a technological measure &quot;effectively controls access to a work&quot; if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain access to the work.

Thus, if there is some &quot;technological measure that effectively controls access to a work&quot;, it is illegal to circumvent that measure. However, Section 1201 creates several exceptions to this rule, and the Library of Congress is empowered to create additional exceptions.

====Distribution of Circumvention Tools====
The Act also prohibits the distribution of tools that enable a user to circumvent access controls or controls that protect a right of the copyright holder.
====Access Controls====
17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201 (a)(2) provides:
(2) No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof, that—
(A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title;
(B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title; or
(C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that person with that person&#x27;s knowledge for use in circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.

====Rights Controls====
Distribution of tools intended to circumvent controls that protect a right of the copyright holder is also prohibited. 17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201 (b) states:

 (1) No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof, that—
(A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing protection afforded by a technological measure that effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under this title in a work or a portion thereof;

(B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure that effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under this title in a work or a portion thereof; or

(C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that person with that person&#x27;s knowledge for use in circumventing protection afforded by a technological measure that effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under this title in a work or a portion thereof.
A rights control is defined in 17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201 (b)(2) (B):

a technological measure &quot;effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under this title&quot; if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, prevents, restricts, or otherwise limits the exercise of a right of a copyright owner under this title.
Unlike access controls, the DMCA does not ban the circumvention of rights controls. It was thought that traditional copyright law was sufficient to protect the interests of copyright holders in cases of individual acts of circumvention.

====Other Rights====
The Act states that its provisions are not intended to modify a number of already existing rights. Section 1201(c) provides:

(c) Other Rights, Etc., Not Affected.—
(1) Nothing in this section shall affect rights, remedies, limitations, or defenses to copyright infringement, including fair use, under this title.
(2) Nothing in this section shall enlarge or diminish vicarious or contributory liability for copyright infringement in connection with any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof.
(3) Nothing in this section shall require that the design of, or design and selection of parts and components for, a consumer electronics, telecommunications, or computing product provide for a response to any particular technological measure, so long as such part or component, or the product in which such part or component is integrated, does not otherwise fall within the prohibitions of subsection (a)(2) or (b)(1).
(4) Nothing in this section shall enlarge or diminish any rights of free speech or the press for activities using consumer electronics, telecommunications, or computing products.

====Fair Use and Circumvention====
Critics of the DMCA have often noted the absence of an explicit exception for circumvention to enable fair use.

Section 103(c)(1) of the DMCA (17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201 (c)(1)) does state that [n]othing in this section shall affect rights, remedies, limitations, or defenses to copyright infringement, including fair use, under this title. However, a violation of the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA is not itself copyright infringement and therefore it is unclear whether fair use can be raised as a defense in circumvention cases.

Courts have come out both ways on the issue. Some have held that the anti-circumvention provisions can only be violated when the circumvention has a connection to copyright infringement. For example, in Storage Tech. Corp. v. Custom Hardware Eng&#x27;g &amp; Consulting, Inc., 421 F.3d 1307, 1318-19 (Fed. Cir. 2005) the Federal Circuit held that a copyright holder must show a connection to copyright infringement in order to succeed in a claim under the DMCA.

Similarly, in Chamberlain Group, Inc. v. Skylink Technologies, Inc. 381 F.3d 1178 (Fed. Cir. 2004) the court held that distribution of a circumvention device (in that case a garage door opener) did not violate the anti-circumvention provisions because its use did not lead to any copyright violation.

However, in a number of cases involving DVD decryption courts have held that there is no fair use defense in circumvention cases. In Universal City Studios v. Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d 294, 322 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), the court stated that &quot;[i]f Congress had meant the fair use defense to apply to such actions, it would have said so.&quot;

====Reverse Engineering and Circumvention====
Sec. 103(f) of the DMCA (17 U.S.C. § 1201 (f)) says that you are allowed to reverse-engineer a protected program in order to figure out how to get it to interoperate (i.e., exchange and make use of information) with other programs.. The section states:
(f) Reverse Engineering.—
 (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement under this title.
 (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a person may develop and employ technological means to circumvent a technological measure, or to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure, in order to enable the identification and analysis under paragraph (1), or for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, if such means are necessary to achieve such interoperability, to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title.
 (3) The information acquired through the acts permitted under paragraph (1), and the means permitted under paragraph (2), may be made available to others if the person referred to in paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, provides such information or means solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title or violate applicable law other than this section.
 (4) For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;interoperability&quot; means the ability of computer programs to exchange information, and of such programs mutually to use the information which has been exchanged.
====Notable cases====
* &quot;Universal v. Reimerdes&quot;
* &quot;United States v. ElcomSoft and Sklyarov&quot;

====Criticism====
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) criticized DMCA anti-circumvention clauses, saying it &quot;chills free expression and scientific research&quot;, jeopardizes fair use, impedes competition and innovation, and interferes with computer intrusion laws.

===Australia===

Australia prohibits circumvention of &quot;access control technical protection measures&quot; in Section 116 of the Copyright Act. The law currently imposes penalties for circumvention of such measures as well as the manufacturing and distribution of tools to enable it.

DRM may be legally circumvented under a few distinct circumstances which are named as exceptions in the law:
#permission of the rightsholder
#enabling interoperability with copyrighted software
#encryption research
#security testing
#disabling access to private information (circumvention only)
#national security or law enforcement
#library acquisition decisions (circumvention only)
#acts prescribed by regulation (circumvention only)

A person circumventing the access control bears the burden of proof that one of these exceptions apply.

Penalties for violation of the anti-circumvention laws include an injunction, monetary damages, and destruction of enabling devices.

====Notable cases====
* Stevens v. Sony, holding that a device allowing PlayStations to play games with a different region code did not violate the anti-circumvention laws, because the mechanism in the PlayStation did not directly prevent the infringement of copyright.

<text>The Grease Band was a British rock band that originally formed as Joe Cocker&#x27;s backing group. They appeared with Cocker during the 1960s, including his performance at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969. The band&#x27;s name derived from an interview Cocker had read with the American jazz organist Jimmy Smith, who had approvingly described another performer as having &quot;a lot of grease&quot;, with &quot;grease&quot; referring to soul. After Cocker formed the &quot;Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen&quot; album band line-up, the group released two albums without him in the 1970s. 

Their keyboard player was Chris Stainton, who went on to tour extensively with Eric Clapton. Bassist Alan Spenner and rhythm guitarist Neil Hubbard went on to play in the UK blue-eyed soul band Kokomo; following this, the pair worked in support of the late 1970s/early 1980s incarnation of Roxy Music. Drummer Bruce Rowland later joined Fairport Convention. Henry McCullough was the Grease Band&#x27;s lead guitarist, a role he later occupied in Paul McCartney&#x27;s Wings, and continued as a solo artist until his death in June 2016. Rowland, Spenner, Hubbard and McCullough all played on the original 1970 recording of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.

<text>Ruše (; ) is a small town in northeastern Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Ruše and lies on the right bank of the Drava River west of Maribor. The area is part of the traditional region of Styria. It is now included in the Drava Statistical Region.

==Name==
Ruše was mentioned in written sources in 1091 as &quot;Rovste&quot; (and as &quot;Roiste&quot; in 1184 and &quot;Råst&quot; in 1372, among other names). The name developed from the plural demonym &quot;*Rovьščane&quot;, derived from &quot;*rovъ&quot; &#x27;ditch, trench&#x27;, thus referring to people living near such a feature.

==Church==
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to the Holy Name of Mary and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maribor. It was first mentioned in written documents dating to 1387, but was destroyed in an Ottoman raid in 1532. It was rebuilt soon after and then extended in the 17th century. The church was damaged by fire in 1779.

<doc id="900816" wikidata="Q5228762" url="?curid=900816" title="Dave Ferriss">
<text>David Meadow Ferriss (December 5, 1921 – November 24, 2016) was an American Major League Baseball player who pitched for the Boston Red Sox from 1945 through 1950. Ferriss was given the nickname &#x27;Boo&#x27; as the result of a childhood inability to pronounce the word &#x27;brother&#x27;.

After Ferriss&#x27;s MLB playing career was over, he returned to the Mississippi Delta for two stints as the head baseball coach at Delta State University where he retired as the school&#x27;s all-time leader in wins with 639. In November 2002, he was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==

===College and minor league baseball===
Ferriss received the first full baseball scholarship to Mississippi State University, where he pitched in 1941 and 1942 and joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity. He was signed by the Red Sox in 1942, and he appeared in 21 games for the Greensboro Red Sox of the Class B Piedmont League, compiling a 7–7 record. Shortly afterward, he was drafted into the Army for service in World War II, serving for over two years at Randolph Field in Texas, where he was able to continue playing baseball in a military league. After an early discharge in February 1945 due to asthma, Ferriss was assigned by the Red Sox to the Louisville Colonels.

===Major League Baseball===
When the Red Sox started slowly in 1945, Ferriss was called up and made a spectacular major league debut with a five-hit shutout against the Athletics on April 29. He went on to set a longstanding American League (AL) record for scoreless innings pitched at the start of a career with 22, which stood until 2008, when it was broken by Brad Ziegler. Ferriss compiled a 21–10 win–loss record for the Red Sox in his rookie season.

Ferriss then compiled a 25–6 record (the best in the AL) that helped the Red Sox win the AL pennant in 1946. He was selected for the All-Star Game that season for the first and only time but did not pitch, as the 1945 All-Star Game was not held due to wartime travel restrictions. He started two games in the 1946 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, and pitched a complete-game shutout in the third game before getting a no-decision in the seventh and deciding game, which was won by the Cardinals.

Ferriss&#x27; record in 1947 was 12–11. His arm troubles and asthma restricted him to only nine starts and 31 appearances in 1948, and four appearances in 1949. His final major league appearance was on Opening Day of the 1950 season, when he pitched only one inning. Ferriss compiled a career record of 65–30, and shares the MLB record for consecutive home wins to start a season (13, in 1946). He was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2002.

Ferriss was a very good hitting pitcher in his six-year major league career, posting a .250 batting average (93-for-372) with one home run, 52 RBIs, and 44 runs scored. He had 19 RBIs in each of the 1945 and 1947 seasons. He finished his career with a .979 fielding percentage.

==Coaching career==
Ferriss served as pitching coach for the Red Sox under manager Pinky Higgins from 1955 to 1959 before moving on to Delta State University as head coach in 1960. He held that role until early 1967, when he left Delta State to take the role of assistant athletic director at Mississippi State University. Ferriss returned to Delta State in mid-1968, and he again served as head coach from 1970 until retiring after the 1988 season. His 639–387–8 record as Delta State head coach ranks him among all-time national coaching leaders at the NCAA Division II level. He guided Delta State teams to the NCAA Division II playoffs in eight of his last twelve seasons, including three trips to the NCAA Division II Baseball Championship resulting in finishes of third (1977), second (1978), and third (1982). Gulf South Conference championships came in 1978, 1979, 1985, and 1988, along with a second-place finish in 1981 and third-place in 1982.

Ferriss spent 46 years in baseball at the collegiate and professional levels and was inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1988. He was also inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame, the Delta State University Sports Hall of Fame (1989), the Mississippi State University Sports Hall of Fame, and the Mississippi Semi-Pro Baseball Hall of Fame (1981). In 1988, he received the United States Baseball Federation Service Award for his contributions to the game. He was named NCAA Regional Coach of the Year three times, and earned similar Gulf South Conference coaching honors three times as well. In 1978 and 1982, he was elected College Baseball Coach of the Year in Mississippi, and was runner-up in 1985.

Under his direction, 20 Delta State players earned All-American honors, 20 earned Academic All-American honors, 49 earned All-Gulf South Conference honors, 23 continued their baseball careers onto the professional level, and 40 former players coached in the high school and college ranks. In addition to coaching at Delta State, Ferriss also served at various times as athletic director and director of the DSU Foundation.

In February 2008, Ferriss welcomed back author John Grisham to Delta State&#x27;s campus for an athletic fundraiser. Grisham, a Mississippi native, began his career path &quot;thanks to coach Ferriss&quot; after Ferriss had cut Grisham from his team in the fall of 1978. In Grisham&#x27;s &quot;The Kindest Cut,&quot; the author details his time at Delta State and how coach Ferriss handled the difficult task of cutting the would-be outfielder. Also in 2008, Ferriss received an honorary Doctor of Public Service degree from Delta State.

===Namings===
* The baseball field at Delta State University is named Ferriss Field in his honor. 
*The &quot;Boo&quot; Ferriss Baseball Museum – located at the Robert L. Crawford Center at Delta State University – was named after him.

==Ferriss Trophy==
In the fall of 2003, the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame announced its sponsorship of an annual Mississippi Collegiate Baseball Player of the Year award, and that the trophy would bear Ferriss&#x27; name and likeness. The award is officially called the C Spire Ferriss Trophy, including the name of corporate cosponsor C Spire Wireless.

==Personal life==
Ferriss lived with his wife, Miriam Izard Ferriss, in Cleveland, Mississippi. They had two children, Dr. David Ferriss and Margaret Ferriss White, and two grandchildren. He was a member of Covenant Presbyterian Church (PCA) in Cleveland. He died on November 24, 2016, in Cleveland.

<doc id="900841" wikidata="Q231281" url="?curid=900841" title="Princess Märtha of Sweden">
<text>Princess Märtha of Sweden (Märtha Sofia Lovisa Dagmar Thyra; 28 March 1901 – 5 April 1954) was Crown Princess of Norway as the spouse of the future King Olav V from 1929 until her death in 1954. As Olav only became king in 1957, Märtha never became Queen of Norway. Her son, Harald V, is the current king of Norway. Princess Märtha was also an elder sister of Queen Astrid of Belgium and a maternal aunt of Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte of Luxembourg and Kings Baudouin and Albert II of Belgium.

In 1940, Crown Princess Märtha and her family were immersed in World War II as Germany invaded Norway. After escaping to her home country of Sweden, and then being evacuated to America by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, she effectively advocated for Norway and did fundraising until the end of the war. In 1942, King Haakon VII of Norway, Märtha&#x27;s father-in-law, invested her as a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of Saint Olav.

== Early life ==
Märtha was born at her parents&#x27; home of Arvfurstens Palats in Stockholm on 28 March 1901, the second child of Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of Västergötland, and his wife Princess Ingeborg of Denmark. Her father was the younger brother of King Gustav V of Sweden, making her a first cousin twice removed of the present King of Sweden, and her mother was the younger sister of King Christian X of Denmark and of King Haakon VII of Norway.

Märtha had an elder sister, Princess Margaretha of Denmark, a younger sister, Queen Astrid of the Belgians, and a younger brother, Prince Carl Bernadotte. Märtha grew up to be much more confident and outgoing and so the daughter most admired by her mother.

As a child, Märtha was taught at home by private tutors and completed in-depth courses in childcare and first aid. She and her sisters were occasionally seen shopping unaccompanied on the streets of Stockholm.

== Crown Princess ==
During the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Princess Märtha of Sweden became engaged to her first and second cousin, Prince Olav, only son and heir apparent of her uncle the King of Norway and grandson of her grandfather King Frederik VIII of Denmark&#x27;s younger sister. News of the engagement was very well received: it was taken as a sign that there was no longer any tension following the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden. An excellent match in terms of strengthening royal ties, it was also clearly a match based on love. Initially, her younger sister, Astrid, was expected to marry Olav being younger than Olav by two years, while Märtha was two years older. Astrid was also considered more beautiful, but she instead married the future King Leopold III of Belgium.

Following a year-long engagement, she married Crown Prince Olav in Oslo Cathedral on 21 March 1929. Märtha&#x27;s was the first royal wedding in Norway in 340 years. The marriage is widely believed to have been a success due in large part to their genuine mutual love. They had three children: Ragnhild (1930–2012); Astrid (b. 1932); and the much awaited heir, Harald (b. 1937).

Crown Princess Märtha soon became a popular and respected member of the royal family, later undertaking a range of official engagements and also gave many speeches, unusual for royal females in that era.

Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Märtha resided at the country estate of Skaugum, which was a wedding gift from Baron Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg. When the main house at Skaugum was destroyed by fire in 1930, the Crown Princess took active part in its rebuilding.

Tragedy struck Crown Princess Märtha in 1935 when her sister, the Queen of the Belgians, was killed in a car crash; the two siblings had been very close. Later King Olav said that it took his wife more than ten years to come to terms with her sister&#x27;s death, and he did not think that she ever really got over it. She – together with her elder sister Margaretha – became a great support for her sister&#x27;s children in Belgium.

In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the Crown Prince and Princess visited the United States. The couple befriended President Franklin Roosevelt and his wife, Eleanor. During this visit, the royal couple conducted an extensive tour of the Upper Midwest, where many Norwegian immigrants were settled. Also during their US tour, Crown Princess Märtha was initiated, together with her lady-in-waiting Ragni Østgaard, into the Delta Zeta sorority being pinned at the University of North Dakota by Delta Zeta national president Myrtle Graeter Malott.

In 1938 upon the death of her mother-in-law, Queen Maud, Crown Princess Märtha became the royal Norwegian court&#x27;s senior lady.

===World War II===
Crown Princess Märtha contributed greatly towards Norway mobilizing for self-defence by making a public announcement on 26 January 1940 when she encouraged Norwegian women to participate in the mobilization work. During the flight from the German invasion in 9–10 April 1940, the Norwegian government decided that the Crown Princess and her children were to flee across the border to her native Sweden while her husband and father-in-law remained. Upon their arrival at the Swedish border, they were first denied entry because they could not provide passports; she then instructed her driver to run through the border gate, thus gaining entry into her native Sweden.

In Sweden she stayed at first at a tourist hotel in Sälen, before travelling on to Stockholm where her parents and relatives lived. Her presence in Sweden became problematic where some considered her presence to put Sweden&#x27;s neutrality in jeopardy. President Roosevelt then offered her a personal invitation to the United States. Her uncle, King Gustav V of Sweden, telegraphed her father-in-law King Haakon and advised against the trip, but Märtha insisted on accepting the invitation. Roosevelt sent the US Army transport to the then Finnish port city of Petsamo to pick her up. In the U.S., she and her children initially stayed at the White House. Crown Prince Olav, however, accompanied his father to the United Kingdom with the Norwegian government-in-exile. Thus the Norwegian royal couple, like many other couples during that time, were separated for much of the war.
In August 1941, Crown Princess Märtha traveled with President Roosevelt aboard the presidential yacht, , and sailed to Newfoundland and the Atlantic Charter meetings with Winston Churchill.

The friendship that the Crown Prince and Crown Princess had cultivated with the Roosevelts was further developed during the war years. In 1942, the US presented the exiled Norwegian forces with the gift of the submarine chaser . This ship was launched by Crown Princess Märtha, when she gave a speech in support of Norwegian liberation. Her work to assist the American Red Cross and on behalf of Norwegian interests greatly impressed Roosevelt and influenced his &quot;Look to Norway&quot; speech in 1942. Novelist and essayist Gore Vidal later asserted that Crown Princess Märtha was Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;last love&quot;.
Roosevelt&#x27;s son James stated that &quot;There was no question that Martha was an important figure in Father&#x27;s life during the war ... there is a real possibility that a true romantic relationship developed between the president and the princess.&quot; Roald Dahl, later a well-known author and then a young RAF fighter pilot assigned to Washington, seems to have agreed: 
Princess Märtha spent much of World War II in the United States, where she worked tirelessly to keep up support for Norway among the American public and government. 
Trygve Lie wrote about her war-work: 
: &quot;During those years of struggle, she was undeniably Norway&#x27;s Ambassador Number 1, because of her charm, humanity, wisdom and tact. As Secretary of Foreign Affairs I had to turn to her many times, and the results she achieved and the advice she offered, were always of value.&quot;

In 1942, during her father-in-law&#x27;s birthday celebrations in London, Märtha was invested by him as a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of Saint Olav, stating that her appointment to the order was &quot;not because you are a Crown Princess, but because you have earned it.&quot;

=== Post-war period ===
When she returned to Norway following the war in 1945, Princess Märtha received a hero&#x27;s welcome and was referred to as &quot;Mother of the Nation&quot;. She wholly embraced her role as Crown Princess of Norway and made tremendous efforts towards ensuring the stability and well-being of all Norwegians.

As King Haakon&#x27;s health declined, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess assumed a growing number of official engagements. The Crown Princess became involved in many official tasks, and even made the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve speeches in 1946 and 1950.
After the war, Crown Princess Märtha suffered from poor health.

==Death==
Following a lengthy period of ill-health, Märtha died at The National Hospital in Oslo on 5 April 1954 and was buried at Akershus Castle. Her death is often attributed to cancer or hepatitis. 

Her death came while her elder daughter Princess Ragnhild was expecting her first child and just over three years before her husband ascended the throne as King.

==Legacy==
A 970,000 km² area in Antarctica is named Princess Martha Coast in her honor.

A statue of the princess, created by Kirsten Kokkin was erected outside the Norwegian embassy in Washington, D.C. in 2005. In 2007, a replica of the statue was erected in the courtyard of the Royal Palace in Oslo. A third replica was erected outside The Norwegian Seamen`s Church in Stockholm, Sweden, unveiled by her daughter, Princess Astrid in 2008. This church, &quot;Kronprinsesse Märthas kirke&quot; is named after her.

Crown Princess Märtha’s Memorial Fund is a charitable trust administered by the Norwegian Crown. The Crown Princess&#x27;s youngest daughter, Princess Astrid, serves as chairperson. Initially established as &quot;Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Märtha’s Fund&quot; on 1 April 1929, the fund &quot;is to provide financial support to social and humanitarian initiatives carried out by non-governmental organizations.&quot; In 2005, the Fund had assets of approximately 28 million Norwegian krone (NOK), and issued grants totaling about 1.5 million NOK for roughly 300 recipients.

Her son King Harald V named his daughter Princess Märtha Louise after her grandmother.

The popular Swedish layer Princess cake was named for Märtha and her two sisters when they were children.

The ship &quot;MS «Kronprinsesse Märtha»&quot;, launched in 1929, was named after her. This ship which helped to save hundreds of passengers from the sinking German cruise ship &quot;Dresden&quot; in 1934 has, since 2000, been used as a hotel ship in Stockholm.

Märtha is depicted in the historical docudrama television miniseries &quot;Atlantic Crossing,&quot; a co-production of Cinenord and the state broadcaster, NRK.

<text>Beyond Therapy is a 1981 American play written by Christopher Durang.

==Synopsis==
This farcical comedy focuses on Prudence and Bruce, two Manhattanites who are seeking stable romantic relationships with the help of their psychiatrists, each of whom suggests their patient place a personal ad in the newspaper. Bruce is a highly emotional bisexual who tends to cry easily, a trait Prudence sees as a weakness. Their first meeting proves to be disastrous and the two report back to their respective therapists—libidinous Stuart, who once seduced Prudence, and eccentric Charlotte, who stumbles over the simplest of words, who references the play &quot;Equus&quot; as a good source of advice, and who interacts with her patients with the help of a stuffed Snoopy doll. Clearly the two therapists are more troubled than their patients. Charlotte suggests a revised ad, which once again attracts Prudence, but this time Prudence and Bruce manage to get past their initial loathing and discover they actually like each other. Complications ensue when Bruce&#x27;s jealous live-in lover Bob decides to assert himself and do everything possible to maintain his status quo.

==Productions==
An off-Broadway production directed by Jerry Zaks opened on January 1, 1981 at the Phoenix Theatre in New York, where it ran for 30 performances. The cast included Sigourney Weaver as Prudence, Stephen Collins as Bruce, Jim Borrelli as Stuart, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Charlotte, and Jack Gilpin as Bob. The sets were designed by Karen Schultz, costumes by Jennifer von Mayrhauser, and lighting by Richard Nelson.

&quot;Beyond Therapy&quot; premiered on Broadway on May 26, 1982. It was directed by John Madden, sets were designed by Andrew Jackness, costumes by Jennifer von Mayrhauser, lighting by Paul Gallo. The cast included Dianne Wiest as Prudence, John Lithgow as Bruce, Jack Gilpin as Bob, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Charlotte, and Peter Michael Goetz as Stuart. David Hyde Pierce made his Broadway debut in the role of a waiter.

McGregor-Stewart was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play.

In 1987, Durang adapted his play for a screenplay that was rewritten substantially by director Robert Altman. Although the two shared a screenwriting credit, Durang described the project as &quot;a very unhappy experience and outcome.&quot;

&quot;Beyond Therapy&quot; is one of Durang&#x27;s most frequently produced plays. A recording of the play, featuring Catherine O&#x27;Hara as Prudence and David Hyde Pierce as Bruce, has been released on CD by the Fynsworth Alley label.

<doc id="900863" wikidata="Q1463941" url="?curid=900863" title="Estates General of 1789">
<text>The Estates General of 1789 () was a general assembly representing the French estates of the realm: the clergy (First Estate), the nobility (Second Estate), and the commoners (Third Estate). It was the last of the Estates General of the Kingdom of France.

Summoned by King Louis XVI, the Estates General of 1789 ended when the Third Estate, along with some members of the other Estates, formed the National Assembly and, against the wishes of the King, invited the other two estates to join. This signaled the outbreak of the French Revolution.

== The decision to summon the Estates ==

=== First Assembly of Notables and peasants ===
The suggestion to summon the Estates General came from the Assembly of Notables installed by the king on 22 February 1787. The Estates General had not been called since 1614. In 1787, the Parlement of Paris refused to ratify Charles Alexandre de Calonne&#x27;s program of financial reform, due to the competing interests of its noble members. Calonne was the Controller-General of Finances, appointed by the King to address the state deficit. As a last measure, Calonne was hoping to bypass them by reviving the archaic institution. The initial roster of Notables included 137 nobles, among them many future revolutionaries, such as Comte de Mirabeau and Marquis de Lafayette, known at this time for his central role in the American Revolution. Calonne received little cooperation from the assembly, being dismissed on 8 April 1787 and banished shortly after for proposing a &#x27;Subvention Territoriale&#x27;, or land tax. He continued to comment on the French political scene from London.

Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne, President of the Assembly of Notables, succeeded Calonne as the Controller-General of Finances. He was offered the post of Prime Minister by the king, which was to include being Controller. The Notables nevertheless remained recalcitrant. They made a number of proposals but they would not grant the king money. Lafayette suggested that the problem required a national assembly. Brienne asked him if he meant the Estates General. On receiving an affirmative answer, Brienne recorded it as a proposal. Frustrated by his inability to obtain money, the King staged a day-long harangue, and then on 25 May dissolved the Notables. Their proposals reverted to the Parlement.

=== Rebellion of the Parlements ===
Turning again to the parlements, the king found that they were inclined to continue the issues that had been raised in the Assembly of Notables. Their proper legal function, besides giving advice to the king, was only to register, or record, his edicts as law, a matter of simple obedience, which the king&#x27;s antecessors had been able to command, sometimes by sternness, threats, and losses of temper. Unless registered, the edicts were not lawful.

On 6 July 1787, Loménie forwarded the &quot;Subvention Territoriale&quot; and another tax, the &quot;Edit du Timbre&quot;, or &quot;Stamp Act&quot;, based on the American model, for registration. The parlement refused to register an illegal act, demanding accounting statements, or &quot;States,&quot; as a prior condition. It was the king&#x27;s turn to refuse. The members of the parlement insisted that they required either the accounting States or a meeting of the Estates General. The king would not let this slight to his authority pass and commanded the parlement to assemble at Versailles, where on 6 August he ordered them in person to register the taxes. On 7 August back in Paris, parlement declared in earnest this time the order to be null and void, repudiating all previous registrations of taxes. Only the Estates General, they said, could register taxes.

For the second time, the king summoned the parlement away from Paris, where crowds of people cheered their every action from the street, this time to meet at Troyes, Champagne on 15 August. He did not personally appear. By messenger he and the parlement negotiated an agreement: the king withdrew the Stamp Tax and modified the Land Tax to exclude the lands of people of title in return for the assured registration of further loans. The parlement was allowed to return on 20 September. Encouraged, Loménie, with the support of the king, went beyond what was agreed to by parlement—the granting of specific loans. He proposed an Emprunt Successif (Successive Loan) until 1792 giving the king a blank cheque. When parlement delayed, the king resorted to a ruse; he scheduled a Royal Hunt for 19 November. On that day at 11:00 AM the king and his peers noisily entered the session of parlement dressed in hunting clothes. They would confer with each other and have the decisions registered immediately, they said.

Nearly the entire government was now face-to-face. They argued the problems and issues concerned until dusk, some six hours later. Parlement believed that the problem had gone beyond the government and needed the decisions of the Estates General which did not correspond to the king&#x27;s concept of monarchy. At the end of the day, the king demanded the registration of the Successive Loan. The Duc d&#x27;Orléans (a previous Notable, a relative of the king, and an ardent revolutionary), later known as &quot;Philippe Égalité&quot;, asked if this were a Royal Session of the Peers or a Session of Parlement. On being told it was a Royal Session he replied that edicts were not registered at Royal Sessions. The king retorted, &quot;Vous êtes bien le maître&quot; (do as YOU will) with some sarcasm as the king&#x27;s will was legally required, and strode angrily from the session with a retinue. &quot;Lettres de Cachet,&quot; or arbitrary arrest warrants, followed on the 20th for D&#x27;Orleans and two others. They were taken into custody and held under comfortable conditions away from Paris; D&#x27;Orleans on his country estate. Parlement began a debate on the legality of &quot;Lettres de Cachet&quot;. The men being held became a &quot;cause célèbre.&quot;

As the king and parlement could accomplish no more together, Brienne, over the winter, pressed for an alternative plan; to resurrect even more archaic institutions. The &quot;Grand Bailliages,&quot; or larger legal jurisdictions that once had existed, would assume parlements&#x27; legal functions, while the Plenary Court, last known under Louis IX, when it had the power to register edicts, would assume the registration duties of the parlements, leaving them with no duties to perform. The king planned a sudden revelation and dismissal of parlement. However, Jean-Jacques Duval d&#x27;Eprémesnil heard the government presses running and bribed the printer to give him the proofs of the edict. Hearing it read the next day, 3 May 1788, parlement swore an oath not to be disbanded and defined a manifesto of their rights.

Warrants were issued for d&#x27;Eprémesnil and another but they escaped from their homes from the backdoor in the early morning to seek refuge in parlement. The king sent his guards to arrest them, and they surrendered. Parlement filed silently out between a line of guards. The commander gave the key to the building to the king.

=== The Jacobins ===
The transfer of power to the new government was to begin on 8 May 1788 with the registration of the edicts establishing it in the regional Parlement. The latter refused unanimously following the Parlement of Paris. If the King&#x27;s commissioners forced the issue, Parlement abandoned the meeting place only to return the next day to declare the registration null and void. Armed protests swept the kingdom. Street fighting broke out at Rennes, Brittany. A deputation sent to Paris from there was imprisoned in the Bastille. The Bretons in Paris founded the Breton Club, later renamed the Jacobin Society. The Grand Bailliages could not be created and the Plenary Court met only once.

== Convening the Estates-General ==

=== Edict of 24 January 1789 ===

The Estates-General were summoned by a royal edict dated to 24 January 1789. It comprised two parts: a &quot;Lettre du Roi,&quot; and a &quot;Règlement&quot;.

The &quot;Lettre&quot; announces:
:&quot;We have need of a concourse of our faithful subjects, to assist us surmount all the difficulties we find relative to the state of our finances... These great motives have resolved us to convoke the &quot;assemblée des États&quot; of all the provinces under our authority ...&quot;

The King promises to address the grievances of his people. The &quot;most notable persons&quot; of each community and judicial district are summoned &quot;to confer and to record remonstrances, complaints, and grievances.&quot; Elections for Deputies are to be held. He says that he intends &quot;reform of abuse,&quot; &quot;establishment of a fixed and durable order,&quot; and &quot;general prosperity.&quot; The &quot;Lettre&quot; is signed &quot;Louis.&quot;

&quot;Lettres de Convocation&quot; were sent to all the provinces with the &quot;Règlement&quot; prescribing the methods of election. During the preceding autumn the Parliament of Paris, an aristocratic advisory body to the King, had decided that the organization of the convention would be the same as in 1614, the last time the Estates had met. As 175 years had gone by since then it is clear the Estates were not a functional institution in French society. By reviving them as much as possible like they had been the King and the Parlement intended to control the authority of the people. The previous Estates had voted by order; that is, the Nobles and the Clergy could together outvote the Commons by 2 to 1.

If on the other hand, each delegate were to have one vote, the majority would prevail. The issue was widely discussed in the press during the autumn of 1788. The people would nonetheless accept any national convention confident that enough members of the Nobility and the Clergy would be with them to sway the votes. A National Party was formed. It argued that France had never had a constitution and the proper function of the convention was to establish one. The royalist defenders, however, accepted the absolute monarchy as the constitution. Just to be certain the press began to demand that the Commons be allocated twice as many delegates as each of the other two Estates. In an attempt to bolster his failing popularity the King acceded to this measure of &quot;doubling the Third.&quot; He was confident of his influence over the Nobility and Clergy.

=== Elections of early spring 1789 ===
The First Estate represented 100,000 Catholic clergy; the Church owned about 10 percent of the land and collected its own taxes (the tithe) from peasants. The lands were controlled by bishops and abbots of monasteries, but two-thirds of the 303 delegates from the First Estate were ordinary parish priests; only 51 were bishops. The Second Estate represented the
nobility, about 400,000 men and women who owned about 25 percent of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their peasant tenants. About a third of the 282 deputies representing the Second Estate were landed, mostly with minor holdings. The Third Estate representation was doubled to 578 men, representing about 98 percent of the population of roughly 28 million. Half were well-educated lawyers or local officials. Nearly a third were in trades or industry; 51 were wealthy land owners.

The &quot;Règlement&quot; that went out by post in January thus specified separate voting for delegates of each Estate. Each tax district (cities, boroughs, and parishes) would elect their own delegates to the Third Estate. The &quot;Bailliages&quot;, or judicial districts, would elect delegates to the First and Second Estates in separate ballots. Each voting assembly would also collect a &quot;cahier de doléances&quot; (notebook of grievances) to be considered by the Convocation. The election rules differed somewhat depending on the type of voting unit, whether city, parish or some other. Generally, the distribution of delegates was by population: the most populous locations had the greatest number of delegates. The City of Paris was thus dominant. The electorate consisted of males 25 years and older, property owners, and registered taxpayers. They could be native or naturalized citizens.

The number of delegates elected was about 1,200, half of whom formed the Third Estate. The First and Second Estates had 300 each. But French society had changed since 1614, and these Estates-General were not identical to those of 1614. Members of the nobility were not required to stand for election to the Second Estate, and many of them were elected to the Third Estate. The total number of nobles in the three Estates was about 400. Noble representatives of the Third Estate were among the most passionate revolutionaries in attendance, including Jean Joseph Mounier and the comte de Mirabeau. Some clergy were also elected as Third Estate delegates, most notably the abbé Sieyès. Despite their status as elected representatives of the Third Estate, many of these nobles were executed by guillotine during the Terror.

The Nobles in the Second Estate were the richest and most powerful in the kingdom. The King could count on them, but that was of little use to him in the succeeding course of history. He had also expected that the First Estate would be predominantly the noble Bishops. The electorate, however, returned mainly parish priests, most of whom were sympathetic to the Commons. The Third Estate elections returned predominantly magistrates and lawyers. The lower levels of society, the landless, working men, though present in large numbers in street gangs, were totally absent from the Estates-General, as the King had called for &quot;the most notable persons&quot;.

The grievances returned were mainly about taxes, which the people considered a crushing burden. Consequently, the people and the King were totally at odds from the very beginning. Aristocratic privilege was also attacked. The people resented the fact that nobles could excuse themselves from most of the burden of taxation and service that fell on the ordinary people. A third type complained that the ubiquitous tolls and duties levied by the nobility hindered internal commerce.

=== Opening of the Convention ===

On 5 May 1789, amidst general festivities, the Estates-General convened in an elaborate but temporary &quot;Île des États&quot; set up in one of the courtyards of the official Hôtel des Menus Plaisirs in the town of Versailles near the royal château. With the &quot;étiquette&quot; of 1614 strictly enforced, the clergy and nobility ranged in tiered seating in their full regalia, while the physical locations of the deputies from the Third Estate were at the far end, as dictated by the protocol. When Louis XVI and Charles Louis François de Paule de Barentin, the Keeper of the Seals of France, addressed the deputies on 6 May, the Third Estate discovered that the royal decree granting double representation also upheld the traditional voting &quot;by orders&quot;, i.e. that the collective vote of each estate would be weighed equally.

The apparent intent of the King and of Barentin was for everyone to get directly to the matter of taxes. The larger representation of the Third Estate would remain merely a symbol while giving them no extra power. Director-General of Finance Jacques Necker had more sympathy for the Third Estate, but on this occasion he spoke only about the fiscal situation, leaving it to Barentin to speak on how the Estates-General was to operate.

Trying to avoid the issue of representation and to focus solely on taxes, the King and his ministers had gravely misjudged the situation. The Third Estate wanted the estates to meet as one body and for each delegate to have one vote. The other two estates, while having their own grievances against royal absolutism, believed – correctly, as history was to prove – that they stood to lose more power to the Third Estate than they stood to gain from the King. Necker sympathized with the Third Estate in this matter, but the astute financier lacked equal astuteness as a politician. He decided to let the &quot;impasse&quot; play out to the point of stalemate before he would enter the fray. As a result, by the time the King yielded to the demand of the Third Estate, it seemed to all to be a concession wrung from the monarchy, rather than a magnanimous gift that would have convinced the populace of the King&#x27;s goodwill.

== Proceedings and dissolution ==

The Estates-General reached an impasse. The Second Estate pushed for meetings that were to transpire in three separate locations, as they had traditionally. The Comte de Mirabeau, a noble himself but elected to represent the Third Estate, tried but failed to keep all three orders in a single room for this discussion. Instead of discussing the King&#x27;s taxes, the three estates began to discuss separately the organization of the legislature. These efforts continued without success until 27 May, when the nobles voted to stand firm for each estate to verify its members separately. The following day, the Abbé Sieyès (a senior member of the clergy, but, like Mirabeau, elected to represent the Third Estate) moved that the representatives of the Third Estate, who now called themselves the &quot;Communes&quot; (&quot;Commons&quot;), proceed with verification and invite the other two estates to take part, but not to wait for them.

On 13 June 1789, the Third Estate had arrived at a resolution to examine and settle the powers of the three orders. They invited the clergy and nobles to work with them on this endeavor. On 17 June, with the failure of efforts to reconcile the three estates, the &quot;Communes&quot; completed their own process of verification and almost immediately voted a measure far more radical: they declared themselves redefined as the National Assembly, an assembly not of the estates, but of the people. They invited the other orders to join them, but made it clear that they intended to conduct the nation&#x27;s affairs with or without them. As their numbers exceeded the combined numbers of the other estates, they could dominate any combined assembly in which issues were decided based on majority or supermajority votes of its members, rather than the traditional arrangement giving equal decision-making power to each of the three Estates. The Third Estate balked at this traditional arrangement, because the clergy and nobility were more conservative than the commoners and could overrule the Third Estate on any matter 2–1. The Third Estate had initially demanded to be granted double weight, allowing them to match the power of the First and Second Estates, but those estates had refused to accept this proposal.

The King attempted to resist this reorganization of the Estates-General. On the advice of the courtiers of his privy council, he resolved to go in state to the Assembly, annul its decrees, command the separation of the orders, and dictate the reforms to be effected by the restored Estates-General. On 20 June, he ordered the hall where the National Assembly met to be closed. The Assembly then went in search of a building large enough to hold them, taking their deliberations to the nearby tennis court, where they proceeded to swear the &#x27;Tennis Court Oath&#x27;, agreeing not to disband until they had settled the constitution of France. Two days later, deprived of the use of the tennis court as well, the Assembly met in the Church of Saint Louis, where the majority of the representatives of the clergy joined them: efforts to restore the old order had served only to accelerate events.

In the &quot;séance royale&quot; of 23 June, the King announced a &quot;Charte octroyée&quot;, a constitution granted by royal favor, which affirmed, subject to the traditional limitations, the right of separate deliberation for the three orders, which constitutionally formed three chambers. This move too failed; soon, at the request of the King, those representatives of the nobility who still stood apart also joined the National Assembly. The Estates-General had ceased to exist, having become the National Assembly (after 9 July 1789, renamed the National Constituent Assembly).

<text>During the French Revolution, the National Assembly (), which existed from 17 June 1789 to 9 July 1789, was a revolutionary assembly of the Kingdom of France formed by the representatives of the Third Estate (commoners) of the Estates-General and eventually joined by some members of the First and Second Estates. Thereafter (until replaced by the Legislative Assembly on 30 September 1791), it became a legislative body known as the National Constituent Assembly (), although the shorter form was favored.

==Background==

The Estates-General had been called on 5 May 1789 to manage France&#x27;s financial crisis, but promptly fell to squabbling over its own structure. Its members had been elected to represent the estates of the realm: the 1st Estate (the clergy), the 2nd Estate (the nobility) and the 3rd Estate (which, in theory, represented all of the commoners and, in practice, represented the bourgeoisie). The Third Estate had been granted &quot;double representation&quot;—that is, twice as many delegates as each of the other feudal estates—but at the opening session on 5 May 1789 was informed that all voting would be &quot;by power&quot; not &quot;by head&quot;, so the double representation would be meaningless in terms of power. They refused this and proceeded to meet separately.

Shuttle diplomacy among the estates continued without success until 27 May; on 28 May, the representatives of the 3rd Estate began to meet on their own, calling themselves the &quot;Communes&quot; (&quot;Commons&quot;) and proceeding with their &quot;verification of powers&quot; independently of the other bodies; from 13 June to 17 June they were gradually joined by some of the nobles and the majority of the clergy as well as other people such as the peasants. On 17 June this group began to call itself the National Assembly.

==The King resists==
Jacques Necker, finance minister of Louis XVI, had earlier proposed that the king hold a &quot;Séance Royale&quot; (Royal Session) in an attempt to reconcile the divided Estates. The king agreed; but none of the three orders were formally notified of the decision to hold a Royal Session. All debates were to be put on hold until the &quot;séance royale&quot; took place.

Events soon overtook Necker&#x27;s complex scheme of giving in to the &quot;Communes&quot; on some points while holding firm on others. No longer interested in Necker&#x27;s advice, Louis XVI, under the influence of the courtiers of his privy council, resolved to go in state to the Assembly, annul its decrees, command the separation of the orders, and dictate the reforms to be effected by the restored Estates-General. On 19 June he ordered the Salle des États, the hall where the National Assembly met, closed, and remained at Marly for several days while he prepared his address.

==Confrontation and recognition==
Two days later, also deprived of use of the tennis court that they had been using as an improvised meeting place, the National Assembly met in the Church of Saint Louis, where the majority of the representatives of the clergy joined them: efforts to restore the old order had served only to accelerate events. When, on 23 June in accord with his plan, the king finally addressed the representatives of all three estates, he encountered a stony silence. He concluded by ordering all to disperse. The nobles and clergy obeyed; the deputies of the common people remained seated in a silence finally broken by Mirabeau, whose speech culminated, &quot;A military force surrounds the assembly! Where are the enemies of the nation? Is Catiline at our gates? I demand, investing yourselves with your dignity, with your legislative power, you inclose yourselves within the religion of your oath. It does not permit you to separate till you have formed a constitution.&quot; The deputies stood firm.

Necker, conspicuous by his absence from the royal party on that day, found himself in disgrace with Louis, but back in the good graces of the National Assembly. Those of the clergy who had joined the Assembly at the church of Saint Louis remained in the Assembly; forty-seven members of the nobility, including the Duke of Orléans, soon joined them; by 27 June the royal party had overtly given in, although the likelihood of a military counter-coup remained in the air. The French military began to arrive in large numbers around Paris and Versailles.

=== Royal session of 23 June 1789 ===
In the &quot;séance royale&quot; of 23 June the King granted a &quot;Charte octroyée&quot;, a constitution granted of the royal favour, which affirmed, subject to the traditional limitations, the right of separate deliberation for the three orders, which constitutionally formed three chambers. This move failed; soon that part of the deputies of the nobles who still stood apart, joined the National Assembly at the request of the king. The Estates-General had ceased to exist, having become the National Assembly (and after 9 July 1789, the National Constituent Assembly), though these bodies consisted of the same deputies elected by the separate orders.

==Reconstitution==

Messages of support poured into the Assembly from Paris and other French cities. On 9 July 1789, the Assembly, reconstituting itself as the National Constituent Assembly, addressed the king in polite but firm terms, requesting the removal of the troops (which now included foreign regiments, who showed far greater obedience to the king than did his French troops), but Louis declared that he alone could judge the need for troops, and assured them that the troops had deployed strictly as a precautionary measure. Louis &quot;offered&quot; to move the assembly to Noyon or Soissons: that is to say, to place it between two armies and deprive it of the support of the Parisian people. Public outrage over this troop presence precipitated the Storming of the Bastille, beginning the next phase of the Revolution.

<text>The Storming of the Bastille ( ) occurred in Paris, France, on 14 July 1789, when revolutionary insurgents attempted to storm and seize control of the medieval armoury, fortress, and political prison known as the Bastille. After four hours of fighting and 94 deaths, the insurgents were able to enter the Bastille. The governor of the Bastille, Bernard-René Jourdan de Launay, and several members of the garrison were killed after surrender. At the time, the Bastille represented royal authority in the centre of Paris. The prison contained only seven inmates at the time of its storming and was already scheduled for demolition but was seen by the revolutionaries as a symbol of the monarchy&#x27;s abuse of power. Its fall was the flashpoint of the French Revolution.

In France, 14 July is a national holiday called &quot;Fête nationale française&quot; which commemorates both the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille and the &quot;Fête de la Fédération&quot; which occurred on its first anniversary in 1790. In English this holiday is commonly referred to as Bastille Day.

==Background==
During the reign of Louis XVI, France faced a major economic crisis caused in part by the cost of intervening in the American Revolution and exacerbated by regressive taxes as well as poor harvests in the late 1780s. Furthermore, Finance Minister Calonne, Louis XVI&#x27;s replacement for Jacques Necker, thought that lavish spending would secure loans by presenting the monarchy as wealthy. That only added to Louis&#x27; financial woes. On 5 May 1789, the Estates General convened to deal with the issue but were held back by archaic protocols and the conservatism of the Second Estate, representing the nobility, which made up less than 2% of France&#x27;s population.

On 17 June the Third Estate, with its representatives drawn from the commoners, reconstituted itself as the National Assembly, a body whose purpose was the creation of a French constitution. The king initially opposed that development but was forced to acknowledge the authority of the assembly, which renamed itself the National Constituent Assembly on 9 July.

Paris, close to insurrection and in François Mignet&#x27;s words, &quot;intoxicated with liberty and enthusiasm&quot;, showed wide support for the Assembly. The press published the debates, and political debate spread beyond the Assembly itself into the public squares and halls of the capital. The Palais-Royal and its grounds became the site of an ongoing meeting.

The crowd, on the authority of the meeting at the Palais-Royal, broke open the Prisons of the Abbaye to release some grenadiers of the French Guards who had been reportedly imprisoned for refusing to fire on the people. The Assembly recommended the imprisoned guardsmen receive the clemency of the king, return to prison for a token one-day period, and receive a pardon. The rank and file of the regiment, which had been considered reliable, now leaned toward the popular cause.

==Necker&#x27;s dismissal==
On 11 July 1789, Louis XVI, acting under the influence of the conservative nobles of his privy council, dismissed and banished Necker (who had been sympathetic to the Third Estate) and completely reconstituted the ministry. The marshals Victor-François, duc de Broglie, La Galissonnière, the duc de la Vauguyon, the Baron Louis de Breteuil, and the intendant Joseph Foullon de Doué, took over the posts of Puységur, Armand Marc, comte de Montmorin, La Luzerne, Saint-Priest, and Necker.
News of Necker&#x27;s dismissal reached Paris on the afternoon of 12 July. The Parisians generally presumed that the dismissal marked the start of a coup by conservative elements. Liberal Parisians were further enraged by the fear that a concentration of Royal troops, brought in from frontier garrisons to Versailles, Sèvres, the Champ de Mars and Saint-Denis, would attempt to shut down the National Constituent Assembly, which was meeting in Versailles. Crowds gathered throughout Paris, including more than 10,000 at the Palais-Royal. Camille Desmoulins successfully rallied the crowd by &quot;mounting a table, pistol in hand, exclaiming: &#x27;Citizens, there is no time to lose; the dismissal of Necker is the knell of Saint Bartholomew for patriots! This very night all the Swiss and German battalions will leave the Champ de Mars to massacre us all; one resource is left; to take arms!&#x27;&quot;

The Swiss and German battalions referred to were among the foreign mercenary troops who made up a significant portion of the pre-revolutionary Royal Army and were seen as being less likely to be sympathetic to the popular cause than ordinary French soldiers. By early July, approximately half of the 25,000 regular troops in Paris and Versailles were drawn from those foreign regiments. The French regiments included in the concentration appear to have been selected either because of the proximity of their garrisons to Paris or because their colonels were supporters of the reactionary &quot;court party&quot; opposed to reform.

During the public demonstrations that started on 12 July, the multitude displayed busts of Necker and of Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans and marched from the Palais Royal through the theatre district before it continued westward along the boulevards. The crowd clashed with the Royal German Cavalry Regiment (&quot;Royal-Allemand&quot;) between the Place Vendôme and the Tuileries Palace. From atop the Champs-Élysées, Charles Eugene, Prince of Lambesc (Marshal of the Camp, Proprietor of the Royal Allemand-Dragoons) unleashed a cavalry charge that dispersed the remaining protesters at Place Louis XV—now Place de la Concorde. The Royal commander, Baron de Besenval, fearing the results of a blood bath amongst the poorly-armed crowds or defections among his own men, then withdrew the cavalry towards Sèvres.

Meanwhile, unrest was growing among the people of Paris who expressed their hostility against state authorities by attacking customs posts blamed for causing increased food and wine prices. The people of Paris started to plunder any place where food, guns, and supplies might be hoarded. That night, rumours spread that supplies were hoarded at Saint-Lazare, a huge property of the clergy, which functioned as a convent, hospital, school, and even a jail. An angry mob broke in and plundered the property, seizing 52 wagons of wheat, which were taken to the public market. The same day, multitudes of people plundered many other places including weapon arsenals. Royal troops did nothing to stop the spreading of social chaos in Paris.

==Armed conflict==
The regiment of Gardes Françaises (French Guards) formed the permanent garrison of Paris and, with many local ties, was favourably disposed towards the popular cause. The regiment had remained confined to its barracks during the initial stages of the mid-July disturbances. With Paris becoming the scene of a general riot, Charles Eugene, not trusting the regiment to obey his order, posted sixty dragoons to station themselves before its depot in the Chaussée d&#x27;Antin. The officers of the French Guards made ineffectual attempts to rally their men. The rebellious citizenry had now acquired a trained military contingent. As word of that spread, the commanders of the royal forces encamped on the Champ de Mars became doubtful of the dependability of even the foreign regiments.

The future &quot;Citizen King&quot;, Louis-Philippe, duc d&#x27;Orléans, witnessed those events as a young officer and was of the opinion that the soldiers would have obeyed orders if put to the test. He also commented in retrospect that the officers of the French Guards had neglected their responsibilities in the period before the uprising and left the regiment too much to the control of its non-commissioned officers. However, the uncertain leadership of Besenval led to a virtual abdication of royal authority in central Paris.

On the morning of 13 July, the electors of Paris met and agreed to the recruitment of a &quot;bourgeois militia&quot; of 48,000 men from the 60 voting districts of Paris to restore order. Their identifying cockades were of blue and red, the colours of Paris. Lafayette was elected commander of that group on 14 July and subsequently changed its name to the National Guard. He added the colour white to the cockade on 27 July, to make the famous French tricolour. White was the historic colour of the Bourbon monarchy and Lafayette&#x27;s decision to retain it in the new symbol of national identity illustrates his intention to achieve a constitutional monarchy rather than moving to a revolutionary republic.

==Storming the Bastille==

On the morning of 14 July Paris was in a state of alarm. The partisans of the Third Estate in France, now under the control of the Bourgeois Militia of Paris (soon to become Revolutionary France&#x27;s National Guard), had earlier stormed the Hôtel des Invalides without meeting significant opposition. Their intention had been to gather the weapons held there (29,000 to 32,000 muskets, but without powder or shot). The commandant at the Invalides had in the previous few days taken the precaution of transferring 250 barrels of gunpowder to the Bastille for safer storage.

At this point, the Bastille was nearly empty, housing only seven prisoners: four forgers arrested under warrants issued by the Grand Châtelet court; James F.X. Whyte, an Irish born &quot;lunatic&quot; suspected of spying and imprisoned at the request of his family; Auguste-Claude Tavernier, who had tried to assassinate Louis XV 30 years before; and one &quot;deviant&quot; aristocrat suspected of murder, the Comte de Solages, imprisoned by his father using a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot;. A previous prisoner the Marquis de Sade had been transferred out ten days earlier, after shouting to passers-by that the prisoners were being massacred. The high cost of maintaining a garrisoned medieval fortress, for what was seen as having a limited purpose, had led to a decision being made shortly before the disturbances began to replace it with an open public space. Amid the tensions of July 1789, the building remained as a symbol of royal tyranny.

An analysis in 2013 of the Bastille&#x27;s dimensions showed that it did not tower over the neighbourhood as depicted in some paintings, but was a comparable height to other buildings in the neighbourhood. The regular garrison consisted of 82 &quot;invalides&quot; (veteran soldiers no longer suitable for service in the field). It had however been reinforced on 7 July by 32 grenadiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment from the regular troops on the Champ de Mars. The walls mounted 18 eight-pound guns and 12 smaller pieces. The Bastille&#x27;s governor was Bernard-René de Launay, son of a previous governor and actually born within the Bastille.

The official list of &quot;vainqueurs de la Bastille&quot; (conquerors of the Bastille) subsequently compiled has 954 names, and the total of the crowd was probably fewer than one thousand. A breakdown of occupations included in the list indicates that the majority were local artisans, together with some regular army deserters and a few distinctive categories, such as 21 wine merchants.

The crowd gathered outside the fortress around mid-morning, calling for the pulling back of the seemingly threatening cannon from the embrasures of the towers and walls and the release of the arms and gunpowder stored inside. Two representatives from the (municipal authorities from the Town Hall) were invited into the fortress and negotiations began, while another was admitted around noon with definite demands. The negotiations dragged on while the crowd grew and became impatient. Around 1:30 pm, the crowd surged into the undefended outer courtyard. A small party climbed onto the roof of a building next to the gate to the inner courtyard of the fortress and broke the chains on the drawbridge, crushing one &quot;vainqueur&quot; as it fell. Soldiers of the garrison called to the people to withdraw, but amid the noise and confusion these shouts were misinterpreted as encouragement to enter. Gunfire began, apparently spontaneously, turning the crowd into a mob. The crowd seems to have felt that they had been intentionally drawn into a trap and the fighting became more violent and intense, while attempts by deputies to organise a cease-fire were ignored by the attackers.

The firing continued, and after 3:00 pm, the attackers were reinforced by mutinous &quot;gardes françaises&quot;, along with two cannons, each of which was reportedly fired about six times. Several farm wagons were filled with damp straw, which was set alight to provide cover for the besiegers. The clouds of smoke however proved a distraction for both sides and the wagons were hauled away. A substantial force of Royal Army troops encamped on the Champ de Mars did not intervene. 
With the possibility of mutual carnage becoming apparent, Governor de Launay ordered the garrison to cease firing at 5:00 pm. A letter written by de Launay offering surrender but threatening to explode the powder stocks held if the garrison were not permitted to evacuate the fortress unharmed, was handed out to the besiegers through a gap in the inner gate. His demands were not met, but Launay nonetheless capitulated, as he realised that with limited food stocks and no water supply his troops could not hold out much longer. He accordingly opened the gates, and the &quot;vainqueurs&quot; swept in to take over the fortress at 5:30 pm.

Ninety-eight attackers and one defender had died in the actual fighting or subsequently from wounds, a disparity accounted for by the protection provided to the garrison by the fortress walls. Launay was seized and dragged towards the in a storm of abuse. Outside the Hôtel, a discussion as to his fate began. The badly beaten Launay shouted &quot;Enough! Let me die!&quot; and kicked a pastry cook named Dulait in the groin. Launay was then stabbed repeatedly and died. An English traveller, Doctor Edward Rigby, reported what he saw, &quot;[We] perceived two bloody heads raised on pikes, which were said to be the heads of the Marquis de Launay, Governor of the Bastille, and of Monsieur Flesselles, Prévôt des Marchands. It was a chilling and a horrid sight! ... Shocked and disgusted at this scene, [we] retired immediately from the streets.&quot;

The three officers of the permanent Bastille garrison were also killed by the crowd; Surviving police reports detail their wounds and clothing.

Three of the &quot;invalides&quot; of the garrison were lynched plus possibly two of the Swiss regulars of the Salis-Samade Regiment who were reported missing. The remaining Swiss were protected by the French Guards and eventually released to return to their regiment. Their officer, Lieutenant Louis de Flue wrote a detailed report on the defense of the Bastille, which was incorporated in the logbook of the Salis-Samade Regiment and has survived. It is (perhaps unfairly) critical of the dead Marquis de Launay, whom Flue accuses of weak and indecisive leadership. The blame for the fall of the Bastille would rather appear to lie with the inertia of the commanders of the 5,000 Royal Army troops encamped on the Champ de Mars, who did not act when either the nearby Hôtel des Invalides or the Bastille were attacked. A brief order sent from the Baron de Besenval to the Governor read only &quot;M. de Launay is to hold firm to the end; I have sent him sufficient forces&quot;.

Returning to the Hôtel de Ville, the mob accused the &quot;prévôt dès marchands&quot; (roughly, mayor) Jacques de Flesselles of treachery, and he was assassinated on the way to an ostensible trial at the Palais-Royal.
The King first learned of the storming only the next morning through the Duke of La Rochefoucauld. &quot;Is it a revolt?&quot; asked Louis XVI. The duke replied: &quot;No sire, it&#x27;s not a revolt; it&#x27;s a revolution.&quot; Indeed, the storming of the Bastille is occasionally suggested to be the founding point of the Revolution in national discourse. In his book &quot;The French Revolution: From Enlightenment to Tyranny&quot;, however, historian Ian Davidson argued that Louis XVI capitulating to the Third Estate at Versailles has a better claim to being the founding event, noting that the &quot;bourgeois Revolutionaries&quot; of Versailles had a major role in steering the future of the revolution, using parliamentary and political mechanisms, for the next three years. Nonetheless, the fall of the Bastille marks the first time the regular citizens of Paris, the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, made a major intervention into the Revolution&#x27;s affairs. For this stage of the Revolution, the &quot;sans-culotte&quot; were allies to the &quot;bourgeois Revolutionaries&quot;.

==14 to 15 July – immediate reaction==
At Versailles, the Assembly were for a few hours ignorant of most of the Paris events. The representatives remained however concerned that the Marshal de Broglie might still unleash a pro-Royalist coup to force them to adopt the order of 23 June, and then dissolve the Assembly. Noailles apparently was first to bring reasonably accurate news of the Paris events to Versailles. M. Ganilh and Bancal-des-Issarts, dispatched to the Hôtel de Ville, confirmed his report.

By the morning of 15 July, the outcome appeared clear to the king as well, and he and his military commanders backed down. The twenty-three regiments of Royal troops concentrated around Paris were dispersed to their frontier garrisons. The Marquis de la Fayette took up command of the National Guard at Paris; Jean-Sylvain Bailly—leader of the Third Estate and instigator of the Tennis Court Oath—became the city&#x27;s mayor under a new governmental structure known as the &quot;Commune de Paris&quot;. The king announced that he would recall Necker and return from Versailles to Paris; on 17 July, in Paris, he accepted a blue-and-red cockade from Bailly and entered the Hôtel de Ville to cries of &quot;Long live the King&quot; and &quot;Long live the Nation&quot;.

==Aftermath==
===Political===
Immediately after the violence of 14 July members of the nobility—little assured by the apparent and, as it was to prove, temporary reconciliation of king and people—started to flee the country as &quot;émigrés&quot;. Among the first to leave were the comte d&#x27;Artois (the future Charles X of France) and his two sons, the prince de Condé, the prince de Conti, the Polignac family, and (slightly later) Charles Alexandre de Calonne, the former finance minister. They settled at Turin, where Calonne, as agent for the count d&#x27;Artois and the prince de Condé, began plotting civil war within the kingdom and agitating for a European coalition against France.

The news of the successful insurrection at Paris spread throughout France. In accord with principles of popular sovereignty and with complete disregard for claims of royal authority, the people established parallel structures of municipalities for civic government and militias for civic protection. In rural areas, many went beyond this: some burned title-deeds and no small number of châteaux, as the &quot;Great Fear&quot; spread across the countryside during the weeks of 20 July to 5 August, with attacks on wealthy landlords impelled by the belief that the aristocracy was trying to put down the revolution.

On 16 July 1789, two days after the Storming of the Bastille, John Frederick Sackville, British ambassador to France, reported to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds, &quot;Thus, my Lord, the greatest revolution that we know anything of has been effected with, comparatively speaking—if the magnitude of the event is considered—the loss of very few lives. From this moment we may consider France as a free country, the King a very limited monarch, and the nobility as reduced to a level with the rest of the nation.&quot;

On 22 July 1789 the populace lynched Controller-General of Finances Joseph Foullon de Doué and his son-in-law Louis Bénigne François Bertier de Sauvigny. Both had held official positions under the monarchy.

About 900 people who claimed to have stormed the Bastille received certificates (&quot;Brevet de vainqueur de la Bastille&quot;) from the National Assembly in 1790, and a number of these still exist.

===Demolition of Bastille===

Although there were arguments that the Bastille should be preserved as a monument to liberation or as a depot for the new National Guard, the Permanent Committee of Municipal Electors at the Paris Town Hall gave the construction entrepreneur Pierre-François Palloy the commission of disassembling the building. Palloy commenced work immediately, employing about 1,000 workers. The demolition of the fortress itself, the melting down of its clock portraying chained prisoners, and the breaking up of four statues were all carried out within five months.

In 1790, Lafayette gave the wrought-iron, one-pound and three-ounce key to the Bastille to U.S. President George Washington. Washington displayed it prominently at government facilities and events in New York and in Philadelphia until shortly before his retirement in 1797. The key remains on display at Washington&#x27;s residence of Mount Vernon.

Palloy also took bricks from the Bastille and had them carved into replicas of the fortress, which he sold, along with medals allegedly made from the chains of prisoners. Pieces of stone from the structure were sent to every district in France, and some have been located. Various other pieces of the Bastille also survive, including stones used to build the Pont de la Concorde bridge over the Seine, and one of the towers, which was found buried in 1899 and is now at Square Henri-Galli in Paris, as well as the clock bells and pulley system, which are now in the Musée d’Art Campanaire. The building itself is outlined in brick on the location where it once stood, as is the moat in the Paris Metro stop below it, where a piece of the foundation is also on display.

==In popular media==
A Tale of Two Cities, the 1859 novel by Charles Dickens, dramatizes the Bastille storming in &quot;Book The Second - the Golden Thread,&quot; Chapter 21, “Echoing Footsteps” (“Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken hearts, - such, and such - like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven hunderd and eighty-nine.”)

&quot;La Révolution française&quot;, a 1989 French film dramatizes the storming in Part I.

&quot;One Nation, One King&quot;, a 2018 French film dramatizes the storming.

<text>Santiago Casares y Quiroga (8 May 1884, in A Coruña, Galicia – 17 February 1950, in Paris) was Prime Minister of Spain from 13 May to 19 July 1936. Casares Quiroga resigned just 48 hours after the beginning of the military insurrection that led to the Spanish Civil War.

==Biography==
Casares Quiroga was one of seven siblings born at A Coruña, the son of Santiago Casares Paz and Rogelia Quiroga Moredo. He inherited the republican ideology from his father, a freemason who was elected mayor of A Coruña in 1917. Also like his father, Casares Quiroga was an atheist.

Leader and founder of the Autonomous Galician Republican Organization (ORGA), a Galician regionalist party, Casares participated in the Pact of San Sebastián in 1930, a platform composed of the principal parties of the republican opposition which aimed to bring down the monarchy of Alfonso XIII. He served as a representative of the Galician Republican Federation, a republican group formed by his ORGA along with other Galician republican forces such as the Radical Party, the Federalists and the Radical Socialists.

In December 1930, he was sent clandestinely to Jaca as a delegate of the National Revolutionary Committee (CRN), to prevent Captain Fermín Galán Rodríguez from raising the Jaca garrison in advance of the date agreed by the CRN. Casares Quiroga did not arrive in time to stop Galán, and the Jaca uprising took place on 12 December 1930 without success. As a result, Casares Quiroga was imprisoned.

With the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in April 1931, he was named Minister of the Navy in the provisional government, becoming later the Minister of Governance (Interior). He was elected a deputy for ORGA in the Constituent Cortes and remained Minister of Governance during the socialist-republican biennium (1931–1933) in the government of Manuel Azaña, Casares’ personal friend.

He was reelected to the Cortes in 1933, and in 1934 joined his party (now the Galician Republican Party) with Azaña’s and others to create the Republican Left, a party which would then become a part of the Popular Front. Casares Quiroga was again reelected in February 1936 and was named Minister of Public Works. After Azaña became President of the Republic in May, Casares Quiroga on 10 May became the 132nd Prime Minister and Minister of War. As the prime minister, he organized the referendum on the Galician Statute of Autonomy (the third statute of autonomy under the Republic, after Catalonia and the Basque Country), which was approved on 28 June 1936.

He was serving as prime minister when the military conspiracy and then uprising of 17 July 1936 took place, which then developed into the Spanish Civil War. Incapable of confronting the rebellion, Casares resigned on 19 July and was replaced by Diego Martínez Barrio, whose government was never confirmed, and then definitely by José Giral. Historians have generally agreed that Casares refused to deliver arms to the revolutionary workers’ organizations as the right-wing uprising unfolded. The memoirs of his daughter María Casares denied this.

He did not hold any other office during the Civil War and left for France along with Azaña and Martínez Barrio after the fall of Catalonia. Casares Quiroga died in exile in 1950. He was the father of actress María Casares.

<text>Drilling is a cutting process where a drill bit is spun to cut a hole of circular cross-section in solid materials. The drill bit is usually a rotary cutting tool, often multi-point. The bit is pressed against the work-piece and rotated at rates from hundreds to thousands of revolutions per minute. This forces the cutting edge against the work-piece, cutting off chips (swarf) from the hole as it is drilled.

In rock drilling, the hole is usually not made through a circular cutting motion, though the bit is usually rotated. Instead, the hole is usually made by hammering a drill bit into the hole with quickly repeated short movements. The hammering action can be performed from outside the hole (top-hammer drill) or within the hole (down-the-hole drill, DTH). Drills used for horizontal drilling are called drifter drills.

In rare cases, specially-shaped bits are used to cut holes of non-circular cross-section; a square cross-section is possible.

== Process ==
Drilled holes are characterized by their sharp edge on the entrance side and the presence of burrs on the exit side (unless they have been removed). Also, the inside of the hole usually has helical feed marks.

Drilling may affect the mechanical properties of the workpiece by creating low residual stresses around the hole opening and a very thin layer of highly stressed and disturbed material on the newly formed surface. This causes the workpiece to become more susceptible to corrosion and crack propagation at the stressed surface.
A finish operation may be done to avoid these detrimental conditions.

For fluted drill bits, any chips are removed via the flutes. Chips may form long spirals or small flakes, depending on the material, and process parameters. The type of chips formed can be an indicator of the machinability of the material, with long chips suggesting good material machinability.

When possible drilled holes should be located perpendicular to the workpiece surface. This minimizes the drill bit&#x27;s tendency to &quot;walk&quot;, that is, to be deflected from the intended center-line of the bore, causing the hole to be misplaced. The higher the length-to-diameter ratio of the drill bit, the greater the tendency to walk. The tendency to walk is also preempted in various other ways, which include:
* Establishing a centering mark or feature before drilling, such as by:
** Casting, molding, or forging a mark into the workpiece
** Center punching
** Spot drilling (i.e., center drilling)
** Spot facing, which is machining a certain area on a casting or forging to establish an accurately located face on an otherwise rough surface.
* Constraining the position of the drill bit using a drill jig with drill bushings

Surface finish produced by drilling may range from 32 to 500 microinches. Finish cuts will generate surfaces near 32 microinches, and roughing will be near 500 microinches.

Cutting fluid is commonly used to cool the drill bit, increase tool life, increase speeds and feeds, increase the surface finish, and aid in ejecting chips. Application of these fluids is usually done by flooding the workpiece with coolant and lubricant or by applying a spray mist.

In deciding which drill(s) to use it is important to consider the task at hand and evaluate which drill would best accomplish the task. There are a variety of drill styles that each serve a different purpose. The subland drill is capable of drilling more than one diameter. The spade drill is used to drill larger hole sizes. The indexable drill is useful in managing chips.

=== Spot drilling ===
The purpose of spot drilling is to drill a hole that will act as a guide for drilling the final hole. The hole is only drilled part way into the workpiece because it is only used to guide the beginning of the next drilling process.

=== Centre drilling ===
Centre drill is a two-fluted tool consisting of a twist drill with a 60° countersink; used to drill countersink center holes in a workpiece to be mounted between centers for turning or grinding.

=== Deep hole drilling ===

Deep hole drilling is defined as drilling a hole of depth greater than ten times the diameter of the hole. These types of holes require special equipment to maintain the straightness and tolerances. Other considerations are roundness and surface finish.

Deep hole drilling is generally achievable with a few tooling methods, usually gun drilling or BTA drilling. These are differentiated due to the coolant entry method (internal or external) and chip removal method (internal or external). Using methods such as a rotating tool and counter-rotating workpiece are common techniques to achieve required straightness tolerances. Secondary tooling methods include trepanning, skiving and burnishing, pull boring, or bottle boring. Finally, a new kind of drilling technology is available to face this issue: vibration drilling. This technology breaks up the chips by a small controlled axial vibration of the drill. The small chips are easily removed by the flutes of the drill.

A high tech monitoring system is used to control force, torque, vibrations, and acoustic emission. Vibration is considered a major defect in deep hole drilling which can often cause the drill to break. A special coolant is usually used to aid in this type of drilling.

==== Gun drilling ====
Gun drilling was originally developed to drill out gun barrels and is used commonly for drilling smaller diameter deep holes. The depth-to-diameter ratio can be even greater than 300:1. The key feature of gun drilling is that the bits are self-centering; this is what allows for such deep accurate holes. The bits use a rotary motion similar to a twist drill; however, the bits are designed with bearing pads that slide along the surface of the hole keeping the drill bit on center. Gun drilling is usually done at high speeds and low feed rates.

====Trepanning====

Trepanning is commonly used for creating larger diameter holes (up to ) where a standard drill bit is not feasible or economical. Trepanning removes the desired diameter by cutting out a solid disk similar to the workings of a drafting compass. Trepanning is performed on flat products such as sheet metal, granite (curling stone), plates, or structural members like I-beams. Trepanning can also be useful to make grooves for inserting seals, such as O-rings.

=== Microdrilling ===
Microdrilling refers to the drilling of holes less than . Drilling of holes at this small diameter presents greater problems since coolant fed drills cannot be used and high spindle speeds are required. High spindle speeds that exceed 10,000 RPM also require the use of balanced tool holders.

=== Vibration drilling... ===
The first studies into vibration drilling began in the 1950s (Pr. V.N. Poduraev, Moscow Bauman University). The main principle consists in axial vibrations or oscillations in addition to the feed movement of the drill so that the chips break up and are then easily removed from the cutting zone.

There are two main technologies of vibration drilling: self-maintained vibration systems and forced vibration systems. Most vibration drilling technologies are still at a research stage. In the case of self-maintained vibration drilling, the eigenfrequency of the tool is used in order to make it naturally vibrate while cutting; vibrations are self-maintained by a mass-spring system included in the tool holder. Other works use a piezoelectric system to generate and control the vibrations. These systems allow high vibration frequencies (up to 2 kHz) for small magnitude (about a few micrometers); they are particularly suitable for drilling small holes. Finally, vibrations can be generated by mechanical systems: the frequency is given by the combination of the rotation speed and the number of oscillation per rotation (a few oscillations per rotation), with magnitude about 0.1 mm.

This last technology is a fully industrial one (example: SineHoling® technology of MITIS). Vibration drilling is a preferred solution in situations like deep hole drilling, multi-material stack drilling (aeronautics) and dry drilling (without lubrication). Generally, it provides improved reliability and greater control of the drilling operation.

=== Circle interpolating ===

&quot;Circle interpolating&quot;, also known as &quot;orbital drilling&quot;, is a process for creating holes using machine cutters.

Orbital drilling is based on rotating a cutting tool around its own axis and simultaneously about a centre axis which is off-set from the axis of the cutting tool. The cutting tool can then be moved simultaneously in an axial direction to drill or machine a hole – and/or combined with an arbitrary sidewards motion to machine an opening or cavity.

By adjusting the offset, a cutting tool of a specific diameter can be used to drill holes of different diameters as illustrated. This implies that the cutting tool inventory can be substantially reduced.

The term orbital drilling comes from that the cutting tool “orbits” around the hole center. The mechanically forced, dynamic offset in orbital drilling has several advantages compared to conventional drilling that drastically increases the hole precision. The lower thrust force results in a burr-less hole when drilling in metals. When drilling in composite materials the problem with delamination is eliminated.

== Material ==

=== Drilling in metal ===
Under normal usage, swarf is carried up and away from the tip of the drill bit by the fluting of the drill bit. The cutting edges produce more chips which continue the movement of the chips outwards from the hole. This is successful until the chips pack too tightly, either because of deeper than normal holes or insufficient &quot;backing off&quot; (removing the drill slightly or totally from the hole while drilling). Cutting fluid is sometimes used to ease this problem and to prolong the tool&#x27;s life by cooling and lubricating the tip and chip flow. Coolant may be introduced via holes through the drill shank, which is common when using a gun drill. When cutting aluminum in particular, cutting fluid helps ensure a smooth and accurate hole while preventing the metal from grabbing the drill bit in the process of drilling the hole. When cutting brass, and other soft metals that can grab the drill bit and causes &quot;chatter&quot;, a face of approx. 1-2 millimeters can be ground on the cutting edge to create an obtuse angle of 91 to 93 degrees. This prevents &quot;chatter&quot; during which the drill tears rather than cuts the metal. However, with that shape of bit cutting edge, the drill is pushing the metal away, rather than grabbing the metal. This creates high friction and very hot swarf.

For heavy feeds and comparatively deep holes oil-hole drills are used in the drill bit, with a lubricant pumped to the drill head through a small hole in the bit and flowing out along the fluting. A conventional drill press arrangement can be used in oil-hole drilling, but it is more commonly seen in automatic drilling machinery in which it is the workpiece that rotates rather than the drill bit.

In computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools a process called &quot;&quot;, or &quot;interrupted cut drilling&quot;, is used to keep swarf from detrimentally building up when drilling deep holes (approximately when the depth of the hole is three times greater than the drill diameter). Peck drilling involves plunging the drill part way through the workpiece, no more than five times the diameter of the drill, and then retracting it to the surface. This is repeated until the hole is finished. A modified form of this process, called &quot;high speed peck drilling&quot; or &quot;chip breaking&quot;, only retracts the drill slightly. This process is faster, but is only used in moderately long holes, otherwise it will overheat the drill bit. It is also used when drilling stringy material to break the chips.

When it is not possible to bring the material to the СNС machine, a Magnetic Base Drilling Machine may be used. The base allows drilling in a horizontal position and even on a ceiling. Usually, for these machines, it is better to use cutters because they can drill much faster with less speed. Cutter sizes vary from 12mm to 200mm DIA and from 30mm to 200mm DOC(depth of cut). These machines are widely used in construction, fabrication, marine, and oil &amp; gas industries. In the oil and gas industry, pneumatic magnetic drilling machines are used to avoid sparks, as well as special tube magnetic drilling machines that can be fixed on pipes of different sizes, even inside. Heavy-duty plate drilling machines provide high-quality solutions in the manufacturing of steel construction, bridge construction, shipyards, and various fields of the construction sector.

=== Drilling in wood ===
Wood being softer than most metals, drilling in wood is considerably easier and faster than drilling in metal. Cutting fluids are not used or needed. The main issue in drilling wood is ensuring clean entry and exit holes and preventing burning. Avoiding burning is a question of using sharp bits and the appropriate cutting speed. Drill bits can tear out chips of wood around the top and bottom of the hole and this is undesirable in fine woodworking applications.

The ubiquitous twist drill bits used in metalworking also work well in wood, but they tend to chip wood out at the entry and exit of the hole. In some cases, as in holes for rough carpentry, the quality of the hole does not matter, and a number of bits for fast cutting in wood exist, including spade bits and self-feeding auger bits. Many types of specialised drill bits for boring clean holes in wood have been developed, including brad-point bits, Forstner bits and hole saws. Chipping on exit can be minimized by using a piece of wood as backing behind the work piece, and the same technique is sometimes used to keep the hole entry neat.

Holes are easier to start in wood as the drill bit can be accurately positioned by pushing it into the wood and creating a dimple. The bit will thus have little tendency to wander.

=== Others ===
Some materials like plastics as well as other non-metals and some metals have a tendency to heat up enough to expand making the hole smaller than desired.

== Related processes ==
The following are some related processes that often accompany drilling:

;Counterboring : This process creates a stepped hole in which a larger diameter follows a smaller diameter partially into a hole.
;Countersinking : This process is similar to counterboring but the step in the hole is cone-shaped.
;Boring : Boring precisely enlarges an already existing hole using a single point cutter.
;Friction drilling : drilling holes using plastic deformation of the subject (under heat and pressure) instead of cutting it.
;Reaming : Reaming is designed to enlarge the size of a hole to leave smooth sides.
;Spot facing :This is similar to milling, it is used to provide a flat machine surface on the workpiece in a localized area

<text>Catterick Garrison is a major garrison and military town south of Richmond, North Yorkshire, England. It is the largest British Army garrison in the world, with a population of around 13,000 in 2017 and covering over 2,400 acres (about 10 km2).

== History ==
At the beginning of August 1907, Robert Baden-Powell, Inspector-General of Cavalry, held his experimental camp for boys on Brownsea Island. In October 1907, he was appointed to command the Northumbrian Division of the newly formed Territorial Army. His headquarters were in Richmond Castle, which was too small to hold the garrison, so he chose as a replacement the site for the Catterick military town. The following year saw the founding of the Scouting movement.

On 12 August 1914, the order was issued for the construction of the camp, following the outbreak of the First World War. The original intention was for Catterick to be a temporary camp to accommodate two complete divisions with around 40,000 men in 2,000 huts.

The base was originally named Richmond Camp but was changed to Catterick Camp in 1915 and later modified to Catterick Garrison in 1973. After serving as a prisoner of war camp at the end of the First World War, the idea to make Catterick a permanent military barracks was first suggested after the partitioning of Ireland in 1921, to replace The Curragh. The required land was purchased, and building plans were put forward in 1923. Construction was undertaken by John Laing &amp; Son, and by the mid-1930s most of the camp&#x27;s facilities were complete. During the Second World War, the camp was once again used to house prisoners of war.

RAF Catterick closed in 1994 and was transferred to the British Army to become Marne Barracks, which falls under the command of Catterick Garrison.

In 2007 an investigation began after allegations that a parachute regiment soldier was filmed being sexually assaulted in Catterick.

In 2018, to celebrate the centenary of the Armistice and the end of the First World War, four stone monuments, including a steam locomotive and a likeness of Lord Baden Powell, were erected on the town&#x27;s central roundabout.

== Deaths and suicides ==
Between 1990 and June 2004, there were 27 non-combat-related deaths at Catterick Garrison. Between 1995 and 2003, 7 soldiers had been found hanged in Catterick Garrison, and another 6 soldiers had been killed by gunshot wounds.

In 1997, 18-year-old British soldier Daniel Farr of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire died under mysterious circumstances in Catterick. His death was widely covered in British news media and led to the creation of the Daniel Trust.

In 2003, Lance Corporal Derek McGregor was found hanged in Catterick Camp. He reportedly left behind a note alleging that he was beaten up and his superiors failed to take action.

In 2004, the corpse of a-24-year old soldier, Andrew John Browne, belonging to the Coldstream Guards was found in Catterick Camp.

In 2016, Adam Hosford, died on his 25th birthday at Catterick Garrison.

In 2018 (sometimes reported as 2019) Alistair McLeish, an 18-year-old soldier of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, was found hanged in the Bourlon Barracks of Catterick Garrison.

In 2019, a soldier driving a Supacat Jackal in Catterick Camp died of brain injuries after crashing his vehicle. A jury-led inquest concluded that &quot;a lack of supervision by chain of command and inadequate safety enforcement contributed to Sgt. McKelvie&#x27;s death.&quot;

In 2020, the decomposing body of Royal Signals Lance Corporal Bernard Mongan was discovered in his barracks in Catterick. He had been missing for three weeks before his absence was noticed. Before his disappearance and death, there had been reports that Mongan had suffered from abuse from fellow British military staff.

== Governance ==
Between 1974 and 2023 it was in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire, within the Central Richmondshire electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council and divided between the Hipswell and Scotton wards of Richmondshire District Council.

The town is divided between two civil parishes, the southern part of the town, south of a small stream known as Leadmill Gill, is in the civil parish of Scotton, the northern part forms the greater part of the civil parish of Hipswell. Each parish has its own parish council.

Catterick Garrison was within the Richmond (Yorks) parliamentary constituency, following the completion of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the seat was abolished. Subject to moderate boundary changes, it was reformed as Richmond and Northallerton, first contested at the 2024 general election. These seats have been represented since 2015 by Conservative Rishi Sunak.

== Geography ==
Catterick Garrison is located on the A6136 road, connecting Richmond with the A1(M) at Catterick Village, to the east. Nearby are the suburban settlements of Scotton south and Hipswell to the east, as well as Colburn, to the east.

Foxglove Covert, a local nature reserve, was the first of its kind in North Yorkshire and the first to be located on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land in the UK. It covers 100 acres of moorland edge, and was opened in 1992. In 2001 it was declared a Site of Local Nature Conservation Importance (SLNCI).

==Commerce==
The town has two centres for shopping, a small shopping parade (on Catterick Road between Byng Road and Vicarage Road) and the town centre. The town centre developed around Richmond Road from the 2000s. Richmondshire Walk and a supermarket were opended in 2000 on the west side of Richmond Road near village shops on east side of the road. From 2013 to 2015, the centre was expanded with the Princes Gate development, on MoD-owned land north of Richmondshire Walk, with new retail outlets, a cinema, 60-bedroom hotel as well as places for eating and drinking.

== Transport ==
There is no longer a railway station at the garrison. Catterick Camp railway station was a terminus station on the Eryholme-Richmond branch line until its closure in 1964; the closest mainline railway stations are now at Northallerton and Darlington; they are equidistant, at south-east and north-east respectively. Regular bus services to Richmond and Darlington are operated by Arriva North East; the closest airport is Teesside International Airport, north-east.

== Education ==
Primary education is provided by Carnagill Community Primary School, built in 1966, Wavell School, Le Cateau Community Primary School and Cambrai Primary School, a free school opened in 2019 on the complex formerly housing a campus of Darlington College. Pupils then receive secondary education at Risedale School. Alternatively, children may also attend school at Richmond School and Sixth Form College.

== Religion ==
The town has three existing churches, St. Joan of Arc is a Roman Catholic memorial church built in 1930 and situated within the Diocese of Middlesbrough, but owing to its position is governed by the Bishopric of the Forces. on the same road is St Aidan&#x27;s Garrison Church, and The Garrison Memorial Church of St Martin and St Oswald.

=== Garrison Cemetery ===
Catterick Garrison Cemetery, on the north side of St John&#x27;s Churchyard in Hipswell, was opened by the War Office in 1930 to serve the camp. Among its graves are those of 42 Commonwealth service personnel of the Second World War and some Polish servicemen.

Previously soldiers from the camp and military hospital were buried in St John&#x27;s Churchyard, which now contains the war graves of 64 Commonwealth service personnel of the First World War and two of the Second World War.

== Community and culture ==

=== Sport ===
The town&#x27;s football club, Catterick Garrison Football Centre, was founded in 2006, and the senior team play in the Wensleydale Creamery League, an affiliate league of the North Riding County Football Association. The Catterick Crusaders rugby league team play in the North East Division of the Rugby League Conference, originally known as the Northallerton Stallions, they adopted their current name after relocation in 2012.

=== Media ===
The town was formerly home to Garrison FM until 2013, when the Ministry of Defence merged Garrison FM&#x27;s contract with that of overseas forces&#x27; station BFBS, who took over local broadcasting for the garrison area. The Catterick Garrison Military WAGS Choir, formed in 2010 was the basis for the BBC programme The Choir: Military Wives and the 2019 film Military Wives (film), which also has scenes filmed in the garrison itself.

=== Leisure facilities ===
Catterick Leisure Centre is a purpose-built complex opposite the retail park, opened in July 2009; it offers a broad spectrum of leisure and fitness facilities including a swimming pool and a gym, as well as an adjoining public library.

Catterick Garrison once had one of Yorkshire&#x27;s largest cinemas, the Ritz Cinema, which opened on 21 December 1940 and had over 1000 seats. It closed on 2 July 1977 after declining usage; today, the site is used as a health and beauty salon. The town would gain a seven screen cinema in 2015 as part of the Princes Gate retail complex.

== Public services ==
The town has a leisure centre and its primary healthcare provider is the Harewood Medical general practice managed by South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The Duchess of Kent Hospital was a military hospital opened on 6 October 1976 and closed its major surgery and hospital wings in 1999, it was still used as a medical facility until 2015, when services were relocated to RAF Leeming. However, an upgraded and brand new facility, known as the &quot;Catterick Integrated Care Campus&quot; is expected to open in 2026. Groundwork on the £55 million facility, a joint venture between the NHS and the Ministry of Defence, began in January 2024.

The local ambulances are run by the Yorkshire Ambulance Service, the town is also in the catchment area of the Great North Air Ambulance. North Yorkshire Police and the Royal Military Police have stations located on a shared complex while North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue provide firefighting services mainly from Colburn Fire Station (between the town and Colburn).

<text>Alice Mona Best (née Shaw; 3 January 1924 – 9 September 1988) was a British music club proprietor, best known as the owner of The Casbah Coffee Club, a club in Liverpool which served as a venue for rock and roll music during the late 1950s and 1960s. Among the bands to play at The Casbah was the Beatles, for whom her son Pete Best (b. 24 November 1941) was a drummer at the time. Mona Best also had two other sons, John Rory (b. 29 January 1945), and Vincent &quot;Roag&quot; Best (b. 21 July 1962). It was later confirmed that Roag&#x27;s father was Beatles&#x27; associate, music executive Neil Aspinall, although he was not registered as the father on Roag&#x27;s birth certificate.

After moving to Liverpool from India, where she was born, Best used gambling winnings to buy a house in 1957. She later opened The Casbah Coffee Club in the cellar of the house. It was planned as a members-only club for her sons and their friends. The club was often referred to as The Casbah Club, or The Casbah. In 2006, the property was accorded a Grade II heritage listing.

Best died on 9 September 1988 in a Liverpool hospital after a heart attack coupled with an unspecified &quot;long illness&quot;.

== Early life in India ==

Best was born on 3 January 1924, in Delhi, British India, to an Irish father Thomas (a major in an Irish regiment) and English mother Mary Shaw. She was the youngest of four children: Brian, Patrick and Aileen. When she was 17, her first son, Randolph Peter Scanland (later surnamed Best), was born on 24 November 1941 in Madras. Pete&#x27;s biological father was marine engineer Donald Peter Scanland, who subsequently died during World War II.

Mona was training with the Red Cross when she met Johnny Best, who came from a family of sports promoters in Liverpool that once owned and ran the Liverpool Stadium. At the time of their meeting, Best was a commissioned officer serving as a Physical Training Instructor in India, and was the British Army&#x27;s middleweight boxing champion. After their marriage on 7 March 1944, at St. Thomas&#x27;s Cathedral, Bombay, the Bests had one child: John Rory Best (b. 29 January 1945). Less than a year later, the family sailed for four weeks to Liverpool on the &quot;Georgic&quot;, which was carrying single and married ranks who had previously been a part of General Sir William Slim&#x27;s forces in southeast Asia. The ship docked in Liverpool on 25 December.

== Move to Liverpool ==

Being a part of Best&#x27;s family meant Mona was accorded respect on Merseyside, which included meeting well-known sports personalities of the time and receiving preferential treatment when booking a table in a restaurant, or a seat in the theatre. The Bests lived for a short time at the Best family&#x27;s large home in West Derby, which was called Ellerslie, but Mona fell out with Johnny’s sister Edna, who resented her brother&#x27;s choice of wife. The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool (above Ma Edgerton&#x27;s public house), but Mona was always looking for a large house — as she had been used to in India — instead of a smaller semi-detached house, which were prevalent in the area. After moving to a three-bedroom house in Princess Drive, Mona persuaded her parents to leave India and live with them in Liverpool.

After moving to 17 Queenscourt Road in 1948 — where the Bests lived for nine years — Rory saw a large Victorian house for sale at 8 Hayman&#x27;s Green in 1954, and told his mother about it. This house was built around 1860 and had previously been owned by the West Derby Conservative Club. Unlike many other family houses in Liverpool, it was set back from the road, had 15 bedrooms and an acre of land. All the rooms were painted dark green or brown, and the garden was totally overgrown. In a widely repeated story (which Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn believes to be false), Mona managed to afford this mansion by pawning all her jewellery and putting the proceeds on a rank outsider running in the 1954 Epsom Derby horse race. The horse, Never Say Die ridden by Lester Piggott in his first Derby victory, came home at 33-1.

Mona decorated the living room in an Oriental style, which reflected her own upbringing in India. She had previously tried to interest her husband in other houses, including a Formby lighthouse, a windmill in St. Helens and a circular house in Southport, which John disliked and rejected.

From 1961–62, Neil Aspinall became good friends with Pete and subsequently rented a room in the Bests&#x27; home. Aspinall became romantically involved with Mona, and during this period, he fathered a child by Mona: Vincent &quot;Roag&quot; Best. Roag was born on 21 July 1962, and just three weeks later, on 16 August 1962, Pete was dismissed from the Beatles. Roag&#x27;s birth certificate was registered on 31 August 1962, stating his name as &quot;Vincent Rogue [sic] Best&quot; and naming John Best as his father. Mona and Johnny had separated in the late 1950s or early 1960s.

== The Casbah Coffee Club ==
Mona came up with the idea of the club after watching a television report about The 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar in London&#x27;s Soho, where several singers had been discovered. She decided to open The Casbah Coffee Club — which was located in her cellar — on 29 August 1959, for young people to meet and listen to the popular music of the day. Mona charged half a crown annually for membership—to &quot;keep out the rough elements&quot;—and served soft drinks, snacks, cakes, and coffee from an espresso machine, which no other club had at that time. The current pop records were played on a small Dansette record player, which amplified them through a speaker of .

Mona had booked the Les Stewart Quartet to play the opening night with George Harrison on guitar, but they cancelled the booking after Stewart and Ken Brown had a quarrel. Stewart was angry that Brown had missed a rehearsal, because Brown was helping Mona to decorate the club. As 300 membership cards had already been sold, Harrison said that he had two friends in a band called the Quarrymen, who would play instead.

John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe and Harrison went to the club to arrange the booking, to which Mona agreed, but she said she needed to finish painting the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows, stars, and a beetle, which still survive. Lennon was short-sighted, mistaking gloss for emulsion paint, which took a long time to dry in the dark, damp cellar. Cynthia Powell, later Lennon’s wife, painted a silhouette of Lennon on the wall, which is also still intact.

The Quarrymen played a series of seven Saturday night concerts in The Casbah for 15 shillings each, from 29 August to October 1959, featuring Brown, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, but without a drummer, or a PA system. The opening night concert was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air-conditioning, and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. As there was no amplification, Lennon later persuaded Mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called Harry to play a short set before the Quarrymen, but this was only so they could use his 40-Watt amplifier. After the success of the first night, Mona gave the Quarrymen a residency, and paid the whole group £3 a night (equivalent to £ in 2025).. Every Saturday thereafter, queues lengthened onto the street, which was financially good for Mona, as she charged one shilling admission on top of the annual membership fee.

Pete was studying at the Collegiate Grammar School when he decided he wanted to be in a music group, so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler&#x27;s music store and Best formed his own band, the Black Jacks. Chas Newby joined the group, as did Brown, but only after he had left the Quarrymen.

The reason for Brown&#x27;s exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of the Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the flu, so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best&#x27;s living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel with the rest of the group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown&#x27;s money to be shared amongst the three of them, since Brown had not played. Mona refused, and so the Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out. Colin Manley, from the Remo Four, was also given a booking to play in the club, which was the only venue that young amateur bands could play at the time. Other groups like the Searchers and Gerry and the Pacemakers later played in the club. The Black Jacks became the resident group at The Casbah, although the Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited. It was in The Casbah Club that Lennon and McCartney convinced Sutcliffe to buy a Höfner president bass guitar and join the Quarrymen.

Although the membership list later spiralled to over a thousand, Mona closed the club on 24 June 1962, with the Beatles as the last group to perform.

In 2006, the Best&#x27;s ex-coal cellar was awarded Grade II listed building status by English Heritage. It has now been opened as a tourist attraction in Liverpool, along with Lennon&#x27;s and McCartney’s previous homes.

=== The Beatles ===

When Pete became a member of the Beatles, Mona repeatedly tried to get the group a lunchtime residency at The Cavern Club by talking to the owner, Ray McFall, but they were turned down, as The Cavern had a jazz-only policy at the time. This was soon to change, as rock became more profitable than jazz. Brian Epstein later wanted to manage the group, and Mona was asked for her advice, and although she had her own plans for the group, she concluded that Epstein would be good for them over time.

After the Beatles signed a management contract with Epstein, Mona did not relinquish her control over them, as they had been using her telephone to call agents, and frequently slept over in her living room between concerts. She reportedly harassed Epstein about the quality of their bookings, and his management of them, which led to Epstein never referring to her by name, but always calling her &quot;that woman&quot;. One musician commented that if Mona said it was a Sunday when it was Tuesday, one would be forced to agree with her.

After Best, McCartney and Harrison were deported from Hamburg in November 1960, Mona made numerous phone calls to Hamburg to recover the group&#x27;s equipment, which she eventually managed to do. Mona wrote to Granada Television in 1961, in an attempt to gain the group a booking on the television programme &quot;People And Places&quot;, but was sent a letter telling her that they would contact her in the future. After Pete had been dismissed from the Beatles on 16 August 1962, Mona was later quoted by biographer Hunter Davies as saying: 

== Later years ==

In 1967, when the Beatles had to pose for the photograph for the cover of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, Lennon asked Mona if he could borrow the war medals her father had been given in India to wear for the photo session. Although still upset at the way Pete had been dismissed from the Beatles, Mona agreed, and the medals were then returned, along with a Cash Box trophy that is in the letter &#x27;L&#x27; of THE BEATLES flower-sign on the cover. Mona never opened another club, or engaged in another business venture, although she did have paying guests at her house, which she shared with her bed-ridden mother and her sons after she and her husband Johnny had parted. Mona died of a heart attack on 9 September 1988, after a long illness.

<text>The Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad (C&amp;LE) was a short-lived electric interurban railway that operated in 1930–1939 Depression-era Ohio and ran between the major cities of Cincinnati, Dayton, Springfield, Columbus, and Toledo. It had a substantial freight business and interchanged with other interurbans to serve Detroit and Cleveland. Its twenty high-speed &quot;Red Devil&quot; interurban passenger cars operated daily between Cincinnati and Cleveland via Toledo, the longest same equipment run by an interurban in the United States. The C&amp;LE failed because of the weak economy and the loss of essential freight interchange partners. It ceased operating in 1939.

== History ==

=== Background: The Consolidation ===

The Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad was legally formed as a corporate entity in January, 1930, by the consolidation of three existing 1929 electric interurban lines: the Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton (CH&amp;D); the Indiana, Columbus and Eastern (IC&amp;E); and the Lima-Toledo Railroad (LT). The combination of these three companies created an interurban system that operated a south-north line from Cincinnati through Dayton and Springfield to Toledo, and an east bound line from Springfield to Columbus.

The Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway was acquired and reorganized in 1926 by Dr. Thomas Conway, Jr., a professor of business at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Wharton School. Believing that he could turn the interurban into a very profitable operation, he made substantial investments in infrastructure and rolling stock, including passenger cars and freight locomotives. He spent $500,000 to purchase the CH&amp;D and then spent $1.5 million on improvements. The interurban&#x27;s business and prospects improved as hoped, particularly in the movement of freight. In 1929, it handled of freight in Cincinnati. Conway then contemplated the advantages of extending his railway north to Toledo, Ohio connecting to Detroit where the C&amp;HD could tap the shipping business of the automotive industry. Thus Conway acquired the Indiana, Columbus and Eastern and the Lima-Toledo as the two teetered at the edge of bankruptcy. These acquisitions gave him the desired access to Toledo. In early January, 1930, the three combined lines were officially incorporated as the Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad.

=== Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad ===
====Financing and rebuilding====
Conway had his new Cincinnati and Lake Erie enterprise issue $3.7 million in stock and $3.5 million in bonds and began an extensive 1930 round of infrastructure improvements and equipment purchases. The timing proved unfortunate as this extensive borrowing was added to the already large bond debt of the earlier CH&amp;D, and it came as the United States entered the Great Depression, which lasted ten years to 1939. The requirement to make the large interest payments on these bonds when added to the railway&#x27;s normal operating expenses caused the line to operate at a paper loss every year except 1936. When in bankruptcy court mandated &quot;Receivership&quot;, the C&amp;LE had the cash to continue to operate due to the suspension of bond payments. The C&amp;LE totaled in length and consisted of three operating divisions. Company offices and the train dispatching center were located in Dayton, Ohio. The Toledo Division ran from Toledo south to Springfield. The Columbus Division ran west alongside U.S. Route 40 and met the Toledo Division at Springfield, Ohio, and turned south to Dayton. The Cincinnati Division ran south from Dayton through Hamilton to Cincinnati. It followed the old towpath of the Miami and Erie Canal for part of its route. The Toledo Division, formerly the Lima–Toledo, ran parallel to the route of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

====Connecting interurbans were essential====

At Toledo, the C&amp;LE interchanged with the Lake Shore Electric Railway (LSE) from Cleveland and the Eastern Michigan Railway from Detroit. At Dayton, it interchanged with the Dayton and Western Traction Company from Indianapolis. All of these neighboring interurban lines provided important freight business for the C&amp;LE, but all were hurting financially. The Eastern Michigan abandoned operations in 1932 and the C&amp;LE lost its connection to Detroit. The Dayton and Western was so weak that the C&amp;LE, in conjunction with the Indianapolis interurban Indiana Railroad, provided the financial support to keep it operating, but it ultimately failed in 1937. The absolutely essential Cleveland connection ended in 1938 when the Lake Shore Electric abandoned after an unwise freight agent strike. The loss of these connections with the related loss of the interchange freight business, particularly that of the LSE, eventually proved fatal to the C&amp;LE.

====New rolling stock====

Part of Conway&#x27;s effort to rejuvenate the C&amp;LE involved improving both passenger and freight business. For passenger service, this meant providing new passenger equipment running on faster schedules. To that end, the C&amp;LE ordered twenty lightweight &quot;Red Devil&quot; cars from the Cincinnati Car Company and participated in the design. They were lighter due to the use of aluminum and sat lower due to the use of smaller wheels and traction motors. These cars featured Art deco styling and had a distinctive bright red paint scheme. Half of the cars were outfitted as parlor cars with first class seating. To demonstrate the new equipment, the C&amp;LE staged a race between car #126 and an airplane. The car &quot;won&quot; after topping out at . The Red Devils operated a daily service between Cincinnati–Toledo–Detroit () and Cincinnati–Toledo–Cleveland (). These were the longest straight through operations using the same equipment on any interurban in the United States. New freight motors were purchased along with freight cars designed to operate on city streets with tight turns at corners.

====Overnight freight delivery====
C&amp;LE management turned the numerous and prior legacy regional mid 1920s interurban companies&#x27; trolley-freight feeble operations into an efficient, high-speed, freight carrier. With the cooperation of neighboring interurbans in Indiana and northern Ohio, it guaranteed next-morning freight delivery to major cities throughout Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. The C&amp;LE’s nightly runs between Cincinnati and Cleveland made it the longest and probably the fastest regional interurban freight carrier in America. To improve freight business, the C&amp;LE guaranteed 5pm 8am overnight 178 mile delivery between Cincinnati to Cleveland, a service that conventional steam railroads could not provide. This enabled the C&amp;LE to secure considerable new business, notably that of a Frigidaire plant near Dayton which had the C&amp;LE construct loading tracks directly into their factory. Conway stated that in 1936 that 10 million pounds of freight were interchanged monthly at Toledo. The freight service operating at night had the additional benefit of not interfering with the daytime operation of the new, fast &quot;Red Devil&quot; passenger interurbans. The C&amp;LE also established interchange freight rates with some steam railroads, a rarity for an interurban. 

====Freight train damage to city streets====
The expanded freight business created tension with local municipalities who did not want freight motors towing multiple freight cars on city streets mixing with automobiles and pedestrians and damaging pavement. There was substantial street damage in both Springfield and Dayton. Springfield sued the C&amp;LE for damages to its brick streets and won, but the railroad was unable to pay or repair the damage it was so broke.
====Wrecks====
The C&amp;LE did not employ protective block signaling on its railway due to the cost of installation. It relied on a system of train orders, and train orders have the danger of a motorman not paying attention to where he is scheduled to meet an opposing train. The C&amp;LE experienced several head-on wrecks due to this. One in 1932 near Hamilton, and another in 1934 near Springfield, Ohio. There were fatalities. The costs to settle bodily injury and death claims combined with the serious damage to the Red Devils exceeded the cost of installing block signals had this been done in 1930.

====Interurban bridge====
A 1908 constructed reinforced concrete seven arch quarter mile long bridge was built (and still exists though in poor condition) at Waterville near Toledo over the Maumee River which the C&amp;LE used on its route north from Lima to Toledo.

====Abandonment====

Competition with a growing population of automobiles riding on state paved highways plus the dire financial impact of the Depression led to a decline in C&amp;LE passenger business. The reasonably good freight business collapsed as the C&amp;LE&#x27;s interchange partners went out of business. The C&amp;LE ceased operations in 1939. The innovative Red Devils were sold after abandonment: six to the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City Railway (CRANDIC) and thirteen to the Lehigh Valley Transit Company. They operated satisfactorily for both interurbans into the early 1950s.

<text>Joe English (born July 2, 1949) is an American musician, vocalist and songwriter who, during the 1970s, played drums in Paul McCartney&#x27;s band Wings and in the rock band Sea Level, among others.

==Biography ==
Born on July 2, 1949, in Rochester, New York, Joe English was a member of the band Jam Factory, a group based in Syracuse, that evolved into the Tall Dogs Orchestra of Macon, Georgia. Searching for an opportunity to expand his talent, he answered an ad for a drummer in early 1975. The address led him to the basement of an old building where, much to his surprise, he found himself face to face with Paul McCartney. The audition was for McCartney&#x27;s Wings, and English got the job. His first album with Wings was &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; and, one album later, he would even take the lead vocals for the song, &quot;Must Do Something About It&quot; from &quot;Wings at the Speed of Sound&quot;. He accompanied Wings on tour and was the drummer on the &quot;Wings Over the World&quot; tour.

In September 1977, during the recording sessions for Wings&#x27; &quot;London Town&quot;, English became homesick and returned to Macon, Georgia, where he began playing with Chuck Leavell&#x27;s band Sea Level. This ended his time with McCartney and Wings.

Following his Christian salvation experience, he formed the Joe English Band, performing as lead singer and drummer. The band toured the world, playing with other major Christian bands of the era, including Petra, DeGarmo &amp; Key, Mylon LeFevre and Servant. In 1983, The Joe English Band toured with Servant during the Great American Album Giveaway Tour. The band recorded a release without English&#x27;s vocals called &quot;AKA Forerunner&quot;. The band included John Lawry, who left to play for Petra in 1984. In 1986, English played in former Petra vocalist Greg X. Volz&#x27;s band, Pieces of Eight. In the late 1980s, English joined Randy Stonehill, Phil Keaggy, Rick Cua and others as part of the Compassion All Star Band. In 1988, the band recorded live &quot;One by One&quot;, their only album together.

English played the snare with his right hand and the hi-hat and ride cymbals with his left, a technique commonly termed &quot;open handed&quot;. He has been unable to play drums professionally since the late 1990s, due to chronic problems with his ankles.

In 1990, English joined the Word of Faith Fellowship in Rutherfordton, North Carolina. As of 2020, he remains a member and is involved in music within the church.

<text>The Union of Democratic Forces (, СДС/SDS) is a political party in Bulgaria, founded in 1989 as a union of several political organizations in opposition to the communist government. The Union was transformed into a single unified party with the same name. The SDS is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). In the 1990s the party had the largest membership in the country, with one million members, but has since splintered into a number of small parties totaling no more than 40,000 members. The SDS proper had 12,000 members in 2016.

== History ==

Dissident groups formed under the faltering regime of Todor Zhivkov in the late 1980s were the basis for the Union. Once Zhivkov fell, a loose political confederation was envisioned where constituent groups could continue to work for their own cause, while the coordinating council would include three members from each organization. The Longtime dissident philosopher Zhelyu Zhelev, who would later become Bulgaria&#x27;s president, was elected chairman, and Petar Beron, a well-known environmental scientist, was chosen as secretary.

The SDS was officially founded on 7 December 1989 as a union of eleven political organizations, such as Ekoglasnost, Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (United) and Bulgarian Agrarian People&#x27;s Union &quot;Nikola Petkov&quot;. The following year, six more parties were incorporated (Radical Democratic Party, Green Party of Bulgaria, Democratic Party, New Social Democratic Party, United Democratic Centre, Democratic Front).

The SDS lost the 1990 elections to the Bulgarian Socialist Party but still participated in the joint cabinet of Dimitar Iliev Popov. On 15 May 1991 39 members left the SDS because of disagreements with the draft of the new constitution and founded the new organizations SDS-Center and SDS-Liberals. Later the remnants of the SDS formed their own cabinet with Prime Minister Filip Dimitrov in November 1991, though the cabinet lasted only a little over a year when the government failed a motion of confidence in September 1992. The socialists, together with the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, formed a coalition government headed by Prof. Lyuben Berov. Following the resignation of Berov&#x27;s cabinet in October 1994, the BSP went on to win the 1994 elections.

However, following discontent over economic problems, Prime Minister Zhan Videnov resigned at the end of 1996, clearing the way for new elections, this time won by the SDS with a crushing 55% vote. Party leader Ivan Kostov went on to form the new government and successfully passed several economic reforms. He was eventually rewarded in December 1999 with an invitation to begin membership talks with the European Union. But public discontent over the social cost of the reforms, including increased unemployment, as well as allegations of corruption led to the SDS&#x27;s defeat in the June 2001 elections, which were won by the National Movement for Simeon II. The United Democratic Forces won 18.2% of the popular vote and 51 out of 240 seats.

The SDS was chaired until the May 20, 2007 European elections by Petar Stoyanov, former president of the country. Meanwhile, Kostov, the former Prime Minister and SDS party leader went on to form his own party - Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria. At the 2005 parliamentary election, the United Democratic Forces won 8.4% of the popular vote and 20 out of 240 seats.

It was announced at the inaugural conference of the Movement for European Reform (MER, March 2007) that the SDS would become official partners alongside the British Conservative Party and the Czech Civic Democratic Party. In mid April 2007, the SDS backtracked on its decision, stating that it remains loyal to the EPP and that it will never leave the EPP section of the EPP-ED Group to join another Group.

In the May 20, 2007 European elections the SDS failed to elect even a single MEP, resulting in the resignation of Stoyanov who led the list.

At the start of 2009 the SDS entered in an electoral alliance named the &quot;Blue Coalition&quot; with four other center-right parties: the DSB, the United Agrarians, the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party and the Radical Democratic Party. The alliance fielded candidates for the June 2009 European election winning a seat. When the Lisbon Treaty came into force in December of that year, their representation doubled. Now both the SDS and the DSB had an MEP.

The Blue coalition placed fifth in the legislative election a month later with a combined 6.8% of the vote and 15 seats.

In the May 2013 elections, the SDS ran alone and lost all of its seats in the Bulgarian National Assembly, but regained four next year as a part of the Reformist Bloc alliance. The same pattern repeated in 2017 and April of 2021, with zero and then two seats respectively (running together with GERB in 2021). Two other MPs joined the SDS later on.

== Coalitions ==
=== United Democratic Forces ===
For the 1997 parliamentary elections, an alliance named United Democratic Forces was formed around SDS. The same name was later used for other elections and parliamentary groups.

=== The Blue Coalition ===
In early 2009 an alliance was formed together with Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria for the European Parliament elections and National Assembly elections. The coalition was named the Blue Coalition and included some other parties.

=== The Reformist Bloc ===
The coalition agreement to form the alliance of the Reformist Bloc was signed on 20 December 2013. The five parties that signed the agreement were the Union of Democratic Forces, Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria, Bulgaria for Citizens Movement, People&#x27;s Party Freedom and Dignity, and the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union.

=== GERB ===
Since 2019 the party is in a coalition with GERB.

<doc id="900972" wikidata="Q3578249" url="?curid=900972" title="École nationale supérieure des mines de Nancy">
<text>Mines Nancy, officially École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Nancy (; &quot;Nancy School of Mines&quot;), also referred to as ENSMN, École des Mines de Nancy or Mines Nancy, is one of the leading French engineering Grandes Écoles.

It is located in the campus Artem, in the city of Nancy, Eastern France (only 1h30 from Paris by TGV), and is part of the University of Lorraine. Around 400 students are taught general science and management and 300 follow specialised Master programs. These students are taught by 60 permanent professors. There are also 400 researchers including a hundred PhD students.
Despite its small size, it is well represented in the French industry. Most of its alumni hold executive positions in the industry and large corporations or scientific research positions in France or abroad.

It was created in 1919 on the request of the University of Nancy in order to contribute to the reconstruction of the mining and steel industry in the east of France after World War I. At the end of the 1950s, under the impulse of its then-director Bertrand Schwartz (younger brother of Laurent Schwartz), the school reorganized its curriculum to include a balanced blend of engineering, management and social sciences. At the time, it was an innovative educational model for engineers, that was later extended to other Grandes Ecoles.

==The Ingénieur civil des Mines degree==

===Description===

The school was initially aimed at training mining engineers. In 1957, its director Bertrand Schwartz began its transformation into a modern &quot;generalist&quot; school. The school focuses on training innovative managers for the industry and researchers, with a broad generalist and high scientific knowledge, able to communicate in different languages.
The Ingénieurs civils des Mines degree (Master of Science and Executive Engineering) is ranked among the best French Grande Ecole degrees. 20% of the students are international students, mainly from Morocco, Tunisia and China. In addition to the general science (advanced mathematics and physics) and management classes, the students have to specialise (one third of their classes) from their second year to the third (and last) year:
* &quot;Département Matériaux&quot; (materials and mechanics) 
* &quot;Département Énergie&quot; (energetics and environment)
* &quot;Département Génie Industriel&quot; (applied mathematics and industrial engineering)
* &quot;Département Information et Systèmes&quot; (computer science)
* &quot;Département Géoingénierie&quot; (geosciences and civil engineering).
The students must learn English and at least another language.

===Internships===
The students have to do at least three internships in order to get the degree.
*Operator internship (6 weeks), whose aim is to discover the reality of work, become aware of the repetitive nature or physical difficulties of the tasks and understand human relations within a company.
*Assistant-engineer internship (at least 10 weeks).
*Engineer internship (at least 20 weeks, usually around 6 months), the end-of-course thesis has to be research oriented.
The engineer internship is usually an opportunity for the companies to hire the students.

===Admission===
For students having studied in the Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Ecoles (a two-year highly selective undergraduate program in Mathematics, Physics), admission to the Ingénieur Civil des Mines degree is decided through a nationwide competitive examination ( Concours Commun Mines-Ponts) and their origin can vary: MP, PC, PSI..., with a number of places for each which was, in 2015:

* MP: 54
* PC: 32
* PSI: 40
* PT: 4
* TSI: 3
* CCP (concours commun polytechniques): 5
* AST: 5

It is also possible for student to be accepted for specialised master&#x27;s or an exchange programs, in particular through partnerships with other schools or universities around the world.

==The Ingénieur degree in Industrial Engineering and Materials==

===Description===

The Industrial Engineering and Materials Grande Ecole program [Ingénieur spécialité Génie Industriel et Matériaux] was established in 1991 under the joint initiative of Ecole des Mines de Nancy and its three partner companies: Renault, Saint-Gobain PAM and ArcelorMittal. This three-year graduate program is designed to provide students with general science and high skills in two complementary fields:
* Materials Science and Engineering

* Industrial Engineering
At the end of this graduate program, students are granted the Ingénieur degree in Industrial Engineering and Materials (Master of Science in Engineering), a French Grande Ecole degree (Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur) validated by Commission des Titres d’Ingénieur (CTI).
In 2018, 80% of graduates found a job before graduation and 100% were hired within 4 months after graduation. 19% of graduates work in the automotive, aviation, naval, and rail industries, 12% in consulting firms and some graduates continue their materials science research in research institutes.

===Internships===
*Technician internship in the first year (at least 19 weeks).

*Assistant engineer internship in the second year (5 months).

*Engineer internship in the final year (6 months).

===Admission===

This Grande Ecole graduate program admits the students from Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Ecoles (PT, TSI, ATS, CPP) and the best students from French universities (bachelor&#x27;s degree or 2-year technical degree). The first round of selection is primarily based on students&#x27; undergraduate transcripts. Students who pass the first round must take the IELTS test and pass an interview at Ecole des Mines de Nancy. The admission is competitive, with only about 25 students admitted each year. In addition, there are also about 3 students from international partner universities of Ecole des Mines de Nancy admitted to this program.

==The Ingénieur degree in Mechanical design==

After ingénieur civil des Mines and ingénieur industrial engineering and matérials, this engineering Grande Ecole program was established in 2000. Students who accomplish this three-year engineering curriculum receive the Ingénieur degree in Mechanical design [Ingénieur Génie Mécanique parcours ingénierie de la conception], a French Grande Ecole degree (Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur) validated by Commission des Titres d’Ingénieur (CTI).

==Research==
*LSG2M: science and engineering of materials and metallurgy
*LSGS: science and engineering of surfaces
*LPM: physics of materials
*GeoRessources: Geological resources and hazards
*CRPG: petrography and geochemistry
*LORIA: computer science and its applications
*ERPI: innovative Processes

==Forum Est-Horizon==

The students of the ENSMN organize their own meeting with professionals, who present their companies and their activities.
The FORUM EST-HORIZON is currently the biggest meeting between the professional world and the students in the East of France. With 50 exhibitors covering a large variety of economic and industrial fields, the forum gathered last year over 1000 students, looking for advice, information and internships.

<doc id="900974" wikidata="Q5690140" url="?curid=900974" title="Heaf test">
<text>The Heaf test, a diagnostic skin test, was long performed to determine whether or not children had been exposed to tuberculosis infection. The test was named after F. R. G. Heaf. Also known as the Sterneedle test, it was administered by a Heaf gun (trademarked &quot;Sterneedle&quot;), a spring-loaded instrument with six needles arranged in a circular formation which was inserted in the wrist or shoulder.

The Heaf test was discontinued in 2005 because the manufacturer deemed its production to be financially unsustainable after manufacturers could not be found for tuberculin or Heaf guns. Until 2005, the test was used in the United Kingdom to determine if the BCG vaccine was needed; the Mantoux test is now used instead. The Heaf test was preferred in the UK, because it was thought to be easier to interpret, with less variability between observers, and less training was required to administer and read the test.

Patients who exhibited a negative reaction to the test were considered for BCG vaccination.

The Heaf test was used to test for tuberculosis in adolescents aged around 13–14.
==Procedure==
A Heaf gun was used to inject multiple samples of testing serum under the skin at once. The needle points were dipped in tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) and pricked into the skin.
A Heaf gun with disposable single-use heads was recommended.

The gun injected PPD equivalent to 100,000 units per ml to the skin over the flexor surface of the left forearm in a circular pattern of six. The test was read between two and seven days later. The injection could not be into sites containing superficial veins.

The reading of the Heaf test was defined by a scale:
* Negative – no induration, maybe six minute puncture scars
* Grade 1 – four to six papules (also considered negative)
* Grade 2 – confluent papules form indurated ring (positive)
* Grade 3 – central filling to form disc (positive)
* Grade 4 – disc &gt;10 mm with or without blistering (strongly positive)

Grades 1 and 2 could result from previous BCG or avian tuberculosis, rather than human TB infection.

Children who were found to have a grade 3 or 4 reaction were referred for X-ray and follow-up.

For interpretation of the test, see Tuberculosis diagnosis.

==Other tests==
The equivalent Mantoux test positive levels done with 10 TU (0.1 mL 100 TU/mL, 1:1000) are
* 0–4 mm induration (Heaf 0-1)
* 5–14 mm induration (Heaf 2)
* &gt;15 mm induration (Heaf 3-4)

The Mantoux test is preferred in the United States for the diagnosis of tuberculosis; multiple puncture tests, such as the Heaf test and Tine test, are not recommended.

<text>Long Lake is a lake between the towns of Naples, Maine, Bridgton, Maine and Harrison, Maine. It is connected to Brandy Pond through the Chute River. Long Lake was created by receding glaciers, and has many coves and rocks.

Canal boats from Portland harbor reached Long Lake through the Cumberland and Oxford Canal, completed in 1832. The canal&#x27;s Songo Lock facilities still control Long Lake water level. Each November, Long Lake is drained by about so that melting snow does not cause a flood in the spring. The lake is the site of many summer camps, including Camp Newfound, Camp Owatonna, Camp Takajo, and Camp Wildwood (actually located on nearby Wood&#x27;s Pond).

The famous author, E.B. White, owned a vacation house on Long Lake in the North Bridgton section. Long Lake is the home of fictional character David Drayton in Stephen King&#x27;s 1980 novella, &quot;The Mist&quot;, which was made into a 2007 movie, &quot;The Mist&quot;. Long Lake is the story&#x27;s opening setting, as well as origin of the mysterious mist.

While the official max depth is listed as , there is a spring near Half Loon Bay, a small bay near Bridgton Academy, that registers as being deep, according to depth finders on multiple boats.

<text>The Alvin Show is an American animated television series that aired on CBS in the early 1960s. This was the first series to feature the singing characters Alvin and the Chipmunks. &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; aired for one season, from October 4, 1961, to September 12, 1962 and was originally sponsored by General Foods through its Jell-O gelatin and Post Cereal brands. Although the series was created in color, it was initially telecast in black and white. It was later rebroadcast in color from 1962-65 for Saturday mornings on CBS and again Saturday mornings on NBC in 1979.

The series rode the momentum of creator Ross Bagdasarian Sr.&#x27;s original hit musical gimmick and developed the singing Chipmunk trio as rambunctious kids–particularly the show&#x27;s namesake star–whose mischief contrasted to his tall, brainy brother Simon and his chubby, gluttonous brother Theodore, as well as their long-suffering, perpetually put-upon manager-father figure, David Seville. The animation was produced by Herbert Klynn&#x27;s Format Films. The pilot episode, an early version of the fifth episode &quot;Good Neighbor&quot;, was written and produced to sell the show to CBS. The actual show featured a re-worked version, which aired as part of the fifth episode. With producer Fred Calvert (who would later work on &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;) calling them in, the opening sequence was animated by Bobe Cannon and assistant animated by Iwao Takamoto.

Each episode consisted of a Chipmunks and Clyde Crashcup segment, both of them seven minutes long. Following each segment was a musical number with Dave and the Chipmunks. Most of the songs came from the first three albums that had already been released by the time the show premiered (&quot;Let&#x27;s All Sing with The Chipmunks&quot;, &quot;Sing Again with The Chipmunks&quot;, and &quot;Around the World with The Chipmunks&quot;). By the second half, all the songs from the new fifth album, &quot;The Chipmunk Songbook&quot;, were also featured. In addition to the non-album &quot;Alvin for President&quot;, &quot;Maria from Madrid&quot;, which was previously released as a non-Chipmunks B-Side to &quot;Judy&quot; in 1959 under Bagdasarian&#x27;s stage name of David Seville, and two unreleased Chipmunk covers, &quot;Clementine&quot; and &quot;Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair&quot;, rounded out the remaining song segments.

The show was followed in 1983 by another Chipmunks series, &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; which aired on NBC.

== Syndication ==
CBS reran the series on Saturday mornings after the show&#x27;s prime time run ended in 1962.

In the mid to late 1960s, the individual show segments were culled together and sold as a syndication package under the title &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;. The original episodes began airing under the &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; title on NBC Saturday mornings in 1979 for a short period.

Ross Bagdasarian Sr. died of a heart attack on January 16, 1972, seemingly bringing to an end any further Chipmunk productions. Years later, his son, Ross Jr., picked up on a disc jockey&#x27;s joke and produced the album &quot;Chipmunk Punk&quot; in 1980. The success of &quot;Chipmunk Punk&quot; spurred renewed interest in a new animated series by Ruby-Spears, which launched in September 1983 on NBC and was titled &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;, with Ross Jr. taking over for his father as the voices of Alvin, Simon, and Dave Seville. His wife, Janice Karman, voiced Theodore, as well as The Chipettes, who are the Chipmunks&#x27; female counterparts. The show ran until 1990, with episodes after 1988 produced by DIC Entertainment. (Eleven episodes were produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson in association with DIC; these were strictly for a syndication package that included all of the Ruby-Spears produced by episodes.)

To coincide with the new series, Viacom Enterprises distributed reruns of &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; to local (mostly independent and future Fox) stations; the rerun package was also carried nationally over superstations WGN and WTBS at various times beginning in September 1983 and ran for mostly a few years on half of the markets. However, some stations continue to run the show at various times as late as 1993. Prior to its superstation runs, &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; was picked up in a few markets such as Detroit, New York, Cleveland, and in international markets such as in Australia and Brazil among others. The show made its way to Europe in the United Kingdom when the BBC (now BBC One) began broadcasting the program as well.

In 1981, Clyde Crashcup made an appearance during a dream sequence in &quot;A Chipmunk Christmas&quot;. During recent network airings of the special, the sequence has been cut out, due to network time constraints concerning commercial ad time.

In 1990, &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; versions of the Chipmunks and Clyde Crashcup reappeared in an episode of &quot;The Chipmunks Go To the Movies&quot; titled &quot;Back to Alvin’s Future&quot; (a spoof of the 1985 movie, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;).

A majority of the songs and clips from &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; were featured in the &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks Sing Along Songs&quot; VHS releases that were released in the mid-1990s. The songs, however, were slightly remixed to sound more modern. The only song that kept its original broadcast soundtrack was &quot;Alvin&#x27;s Orchestra&quot; in the 1993 Sing-Along video &quot;Ragtime Cowboy Joe&quot;. The Bagdasarian closing logo from the show was also remixed in the 1994 Sing-Along video, &quot;Working on the Railroad&quot;.

Nickelodeon picked up US broadcast rights to &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; on March 7, 1994, after the last of a few independent stations pulled the show. The prints from the syndicated reruns were digitized and the Nickelodeon logo was added to several spots in the opening theme. The show aired as part of Nickelodeon’s morning lineup for most of the next year.

During this time, as well as for some time after the full episodes stopped airing, the individual Chipmunk and Clyde Crashcup cartoons and musical segments were inserted into episodes of &quot;Weinerville&quot;. In 1996, Nickelodeon stopped showing &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; segments altogether and no television station has aired them since then.

26 episodes each were produced for the &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; and &quot;Clyde Crashcup&quot; segments, along with 52 musical segments.

General Foods was the show&#x27;s main sponsor; as such, Dave Seville and The Chipmunks appeared in several humorous half-minute commercials for Jell-O and Post Cereals.

== Home media ==
Other than the two VHS releases from Buena Vista Home Video, both of which featured 11 songs from &quot;The Alvin Show&quot;, up until recently, the show has never been released on DVD. However, on September 8, 2009, Paramount Home Entertainment released the first episode of the show, along with two &quot;modern&quot; specials. In 2014, &quot;The Brave Chipmunks&quot; musical sequence was released as a bonus feature on &quot;The Chipmunk Adventure&quot; Blu-ray and DVD combo pack. In 2015, three complete episodes (#01, #04, and #10) were released together as &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; on Blu-ray and DVD.

<doc id="901000" wikidata="Q1781818" url="?curid=901000" title="Sebago Lake">
<text>Sebago Lake (Sih-Bay-Goh) is the deepest and second-largest lake in the U.S. state of Maine. The lake is deep at its deepest point, with a mean depth of . It is possible that Sebago is the deepest lake wholly contained within the entire New England region, although some sources say that Vermont&#x27;s Lake Willoughby is slightly deeper. Along with Lake Champlain, Sebago is one of the only lakes in the area that do not consistently freeze solid during the winter months, with total ice cover occurring for only a short period of time every few winters. Sebago covers about in surface area, has a length of and has a shoreline length of roughly . The surface is around above sea level, so the deep bottom is below the present sea level. It is in Cumberland County, and bordered by the towns of Casco, Naples, Raymond, Sebago, Standish and Windham. The seasonally occupied town of Frye Island is on an island in the lake. Sebago Lake and the surrounding area is known for its erratic and sudden changes in weather during all seasons, likely due to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and to Mt. Washington, a very notorious extreme weather hotspot. The name comes from the Abenaki &quot;sobagoo&quot;, meaning &quot;it is the sea&quot; or &quot;it resembles the sea&quot;.

== History ==
Two Corsair fighter planes were destroyed in a fatal midair collision over the lake on 16 May 1944.

== Transportation ==
The lake is connected to Brandy Pond by the Songo River and eventually to Long Lake in Naples. The lake is drained primarily by the Presumpscot River. The lake and rivers were an early transportation corridor from the coast to the interior, and encouraged the first incorporated European settlement of interior Maine in 1762. Sebago Lake was linked to Portland harbor by the Cumberland and Oxford Canal in 1832. The outlet to the Presumpscot River was controlled for the canal by the Eel Weir Dam and the Head Dam, owned and operated by the Oriental Powder Company after the canal was replaced by a railroad and by the S. D. Warren Paper Mill after 1878.

The lake was a comparatively safe place for training military pilots from NAS Brunswick about flying over water; but several navy planes were lost over the lake during World War II. A Grumman TBF Avenger from the Lewiston Naval Auxiliary Air Facility ditched and sank near Raymond on 16 August 1943. Two low-flying British Vought Corsairs from Brunswick were lost after a mid-air collision over the lake near Raymond on 16 May 1944; and a third Corsair flew into the lake on July 16. In December 2014 a yellow Piper PA-18 Super Cub monoplane landed on a Sebago Lake beach, in what some believe is the first landing of a plane on Sebago beaches.

==Water supply==
Sebago Lake is the primary water supply for the Portland Water District, which serves the Greater Portland region and about 20% of Maine&#x27;s population. The lake&#x27;s watershed is more than long and covers parts of 24 Maine towns.

The direct watershed is about of land plus the of the lake, and the indirect watershed about of land plus about of other bodies of water. As of May 1990, roughly 86% of the watershed was forests and fallow fields, 2.5% in active timber operations, 9.3% in residential, agricultural, and commercial use, and 2.2% used for other purposes. 

The lake holds roughly of water that on average resides 5.1 to 5.4 years in the lake. Water inflow is estimated at per day and outflow at per day, of which /day are for the water district.

==Recreation==
In 1938, the state of Maine purchased and opened Sebago Lake State Park as one of its original five state parks. However, the area was known as a public recreation center even before this. The park now consists of , is open year-round, and has facilities including two public boat launches, an expansive natural sandbar for swimming, and a 250-site campground. There are also numerous private beach clubs and campgrounds spread around the lake, such as Point Sebago in Casco, which contains numerous cottages and facilities that can be rented out to guests. 

Sebago Lake hosts a sailing instruction and charter service and is located in what Maine&#x27;s tourism industry refers to as the Western Lakes and Mountains Region.

Efforts are underway to complete the Sebago to the Sea Trail, a trail running 28 miles from Sebago Lake to Casco Bay, mostly following the path of the Presumpscot River.

===Fishing===
The lake is the likely point of origin of the landlocked salmon, stated in the species&#x27; scientific name (&quot;Salmo salar sebago&quot;). At one point, the entire watershed was under seawater, and the first populations of these marine animals became established as the land rose and seawaters retreated.

Other game fish that can be found in the lake include lake trout, brook trout, brown trout, largemouth bass, and northern pike. Some of these are regularly stocked by the state, or came to the lake naturally. However, others were introduced illegally, particularly bass and pike. The state encourages anglers to kill, hold, and notify them of all northern pike taken in the lake because they were introduced illegally, are not native to the region, and could disrupt the lake ecosystem, including that of Sebago Lake&#x27;s original fish species, such as the landlocked salmon.

Ice fishing for the aforementioned Trout and Pike populations is also popular in areas where it is safely possible, with annual fishing derbies held in the smaller “Jordan Bay” portion of the lake.

==Camps==
The lake also contains numerous summer camp options for children of all ages, genders, and skillsets:

Center Day Camp, an all-inclusive day camp run by the Jewish Community Alliance of Southern Maine, is located on the Eastern Shore of the lake in the town of Windham.

Camp O-At-Ka, founded in 1906, is a boy&#x27;s sleep-away camp located along a half mile of waterfront in the northwest corner of Sebago Lake.

Camp Sebago, a co-ed camp geared towards 7-12 year olds and run by The Salvation Army, is located on the southwestern corner of the lake.

Camp Wohelo, the original Camp Fire Girls camp (WOrk HEalth LOve) was established on Sebago Lake in 1907. Founded by Luther Halsey Gulick and Charlotte Vetter Gulick, known by their native American names of Timanous and Hiitini, the camp strove to teach independence and back woods skills to young girls aged 6–16. Wohelo is still strong today.

<text>Elizabeth J. Magie Phillips (&quot;née&quot; Magie; May 9, 1866 – March 2, 1948) was an American game designer, writer, feminist, and Georgist. She invented &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot;, the precursor to &quot;Monopoly&quot;, to illustrate teachings of the progressive era economist Henry George.

== Life and occupations ==

Elizabeth J. Magie was born in Macomb, Illinois, in 1866 to Mary Jane (née Ritchie) and James K. Magie, a newspaper publisher and an abolitionist who accompanied Abraham Lincoln as he traveled around Illinois in the late 1850s debating politics with Stephen Douglas.

After moving to the D.C. and Maryland area in the early 1880s, she worked as a stenographer and typist at the Dead Letter Office. She was also a short story and poetry writer, comedian, stage actress, feminist, and engineer.

At the age of 26, Magie received a patent for her invention that made the typewriting process easier by allowing paper to go through the rollers more easily. At the time, women were credited with less than one percent of all patents. She also worked as a news reporter for a brief time in the early 1900s. In 1910, at age 44, she married Albert Wallace Phillips. They had no children.

== Political activism ==
Magie was an outspoken activist for the feminist movement, and Georgism, which reflected her father&#x27;s political beliefs when she was young. Georgism refers to the economic perspective that instead of taxing income or other sources, the government should create a universal land tax based on the usefulness, size, and location of the land (Single tax). Then, after funding the government, the left over money would be distributed to the people. Many progressive political leaders at the time supported this economic perspective as it motivated people to cultivate land, redistributed wealth to people of low socioeconomic standing, eradicated the idea that landowners or landlords held the power and monetary value of the land that citizens used, and let people own all of the value and benefits of their creations. This belief became the basis for her game known as &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game.&quot;

Furthermore, she believed that women were as capable as men in inventing, business, and other professional areas. In the 1800s, this belief was considered both novel and radical. When she worked as a stenographer, she was making around $10 a week which was not enough to support herself without the help of a husband. 

In order to bring the struggles of women in the United States to the public&#x27;s attention, she bought an advertisement and tried to auction herself off as a &quot;young woman American slave&quot; looking for a husband to own her. This advertisement was meant to show the position of women and black people in the country, emphasizing the fact that the only people that were truly free were white men. The ad that Magie published became the talk of the town. It spread rapidly through the news and gossip columns around the country. Magie made a name for herself as an outspoken and proud feminist.

== &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot; ==

Magie first made her game, known as &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot;, popular among friends while living in Brentwood, Maryland. In 1903, Magie applied to the US Patent Office for a patent on her board game. She was granted U.S. Patent 748,626 on January 5, 1904. Magie received her patent before women were legally allowed to vote.

&quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot; was designed to demonstrate the economic ill effects of land monopolism and the use of land value tax as a remedy for it. Originally, the goal of the game was to simply obtain wealth. In the following patents, the game developed to eventually have two different settings: one being the monopolist set up (known as Monopoly) where the goal was to own industries, create monopolies, and win by forcing others out of their industries and the other being the anti-monopolist setup (known as Prosperity) where the goal was to create products and interact with opponents. The game would later go on to be the inspiration for the game &quot;Monopoly&quot;.

In 1906, she moved to Chicago. That year, she and fellow Georgists formed the Economic Game Co. to self-publish her original edition of &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot;. In 1910, the Parker Brothers published her humorous card game &quot;Mock Trial&quot;. Then, the Newbie Game Co. in Scotland patented &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot; as &quot;Bre&#x27;r Fox and Bre&#x27;r Rabbit;&quot; however, there was no proof that the game was actually protected by the British patent.

She and her husband moved back to the east coast of the U.S. and patented a revised version of the game in 1924. As her original patent had expired in 1921, this is seen as her attempt to reassert control over her game, which was now being played at some colleges where students made their own copies. In 1932, her second edition of &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot; was published by the Adgame Company of Washington, D.C. This version included both Monopoly and Prosperity.

Magie also developed other games including &quot;Bargain Day&quot; and &quot;King&#x27;s Men&quot; in 1937 and a third version of &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot; in 1939. In &quot;Bargain Day&quot;, shoppers compete with each other in a department store; &quot;King&#x27;s Men&quot; is an abstract strategy game.

== Death ==

Magie died at the age of 81 in 1948. She was buried with her husband Albert Wallace Phillips, who had died in 1937, in Columbia Gardens Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia. Magie died without having any children. At her death, she was not credited for the impact that she had on the board game community and American culture.

== &quot;Monopoly&quot; ==
Magie&#x27;s game was becoming increasingly popular around the Northeastern United States. College students attending Harvard, Columbia, and University of Pennsylvania, left-leaning middle-class families, and Quakers were all playing her board game. Three decades after &quot;The&quot; &quot;Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot; was invented in 1904, Parker Brothers published a modified version, known as &quot;Monopoly&quot;. Charles Darrow claimed the idea as his own, stating that he invented the game in his basement. Magie later spoke out against them and reported that she had made a mere $500 from her invention and received none of the credit for &quot;Monopoly&quot;.

In January 1936, an interview with Magie appeared in a Washington, D.C. newspaper, in which she was critical of Parker Brothers. Magie spoke to reporters about the similarities between &quot;Monopoly&quot; and &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot;. The article published spoke to the fact that Magie spent more money making her game than she received in earnings, especially with the lack of credit she received after &quot;Monopoly&quot; was created. After the interviews, Parker Brothers agreed to publish two more of her games but continued to give Darrow the credit for inventing the game itself.

Darrow was known as the inventor of &quot;Monopoly&quot; until Ralph Anspach, creator of the &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot; game, discovered Magie&#x27;s patents. Anspach had researched the history of &quot;Monopoly&quot; in relation to a legal struggle against Parker Brothers regarding his own game, and discovered Darrow&#x27;s decision to take credit for its invention, despite his having learned about it through friends. Subsequently, Magie&#x27;s invention of &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot; has been given more attention and research. Despite the fact that Darrow and Parker Brothers capitalized on and were credited with her idea, she has posthumously received credit for one of the most popular board games.

== Legacy ==
It was only after her death that the impact Magie had on many aspects of American culture and life began to be appreciated. First and foremost, she helped to popularize the circular board game. Most board games at the time were linear; a circular board game that concentrated on interacting both socially and competitively with the opponents was a novel idea. Her board game not only laid the foundation and inspiration for &quot;Monopoly&quot;, the most famous board game in the United States, but also provided entertainment that taught about Georgist principles, the value in spreading wealth, and the harmfulness of monopolies (this aspect of her game was absent from the Darrow version of &quot;Monopoly&quot;).

She also contributed to pressure for women&#x27;s and black people&#x27;s rights, through educating others about these concepts, inventing board games at a time when women held less than one percent of US patents, and publishing political material in newspapers to speak out against the oppression of women and black communities in the United States.

<doc id="901013" wikidata="Q7759139" url="?curid=901013" title="The RBX Files">
<text>The RBX Files is the debut album by American rapper RBX, released September 26, 1995, on Premeditated/Warner Bros. Records. It peaked at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and at number 62 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was produced by Greg &quot;Gregski&quot; Royal.

Along with singles, music videos were released for two songs: &quot;A.W.O.L.&quot; and &quot;Rough Is the Texture.&quot;

== Background ==
Following his guest appearances on &quot;The Chronic&quot; and &quot;Doggystyle&quot;, RBX was tagged to be Death Row’s next big star, but that was not to be—Dr. Dre and Suge Knight pushed back his debut, and he wound up leaving the label and putting out the album on Premeditated Records.

== Reception ==
Alex Henderson of AllMusic called it an &quot;interesting, if uneven, debut&quot;, noting the &quot;distinctive rapping style&quot;. &quot;Option&quot; called it &quot;subtly funky&quot; with &quot;expertly paced backing tracks&quot;. Wesley K. Marshall of &quot;The Source&quot; magazine called RBX&#x27;s style unorthodox, while praising the artist himself as &quot;an unquestionably skillful lyricist&quot;. The critic described the instrumentals used on the album as &quot;eerie, clashing rugged beats&quot;.

<doc id="901014" wikidata="Q1839461" url="?curid=901014" title="Plimoth Patuxet">
<text>Plimoth Patuxet is a complex of living history museums in Plymouth, Massachusetts founded in 1947, formerly Plimoth Plantation. It replicates the original settlement of the Plymouth Colony established in the 17th century by the English colonists who became known as the Pilgrims. They were among the first people who emigrated to America to seek religious separation from the Church of England. It is a not-for-profit museum supported by administrations, contributions, grants, and volunteers. The recreations are based upon a wide variety of first-hand and second-hand records, accounts, articles, and period paintings and artifacts, and the museum conducts ongoing research and scholarship, including historical archaeological excavation and curation locally and abroad. 

In the English Village section of the museum, trained first-person (&quot;historical&quot;) interpreters speak, act, and dress appropriately for the period, interacting with visitors by answering questions, discussing their lives and viewpoints, and participating in tasks such as cooking, planting, and animal husbandry. Third-person (&quot;modern&quot;) interpreters answer guests&#x27; questions that the first-person interpreters cannot. The English Village represents the year 1627 through most of the museum season (which lasts from early April to late November), depicting day-to-day life and seasonal activities. In November, the English Village typically represents the year 1621, which is the year of the first Thanksgiving to take place in Plymouth Colony.

==History ==

Henry Hornblower II, son of Ralph Hornblower, started the museum in 1947 with help and support from friends, family, and business associates as two English cottages and a fort on Plymouth&#x27;s waterfront. Since then, the museum has grown to include the &quot;Mayflower II&quot;, a 1957 replica of the Mayflower, the English Village (1959), the Wampanoag Homesite (1973), the Hornblower Visitor Center (1987), the Craft Center (1992), the Maxwell and Nye Barns (1994), and the Plimoth Grist Mill (2013). Alongside the settlement is a recreation of a Wampanoag home site, where Indians from a variety of tribes explain and demonstrate how the Wampanoags&#x27; ancestors lived.

The museum grounds at Plimoth Patuxet also include Nye Barn where historical breeds of livestock are kept, a crafts center where many objects are created for use in the village exhibits, a cinema where educational videos are shown, a Colonial Education site for youth and adult groups, and a visitors&#x27; center with indoor exhibits and educational programs. The two houses on the Colonial Education site were built for the PBS show &quot;Colonial House&quot;, which was filmed in Maine. Following the filming, the museum disassembled the houses and reconstructed them at on their current site. The roof of the Cooke House was destroyed by a fire from a fireplace on November 19, 2011, and the building had to be demolished.

&quot;Mayflower II&quot; is docked near Plymouth Rock and is also under the care of the museum. Museum employees in modern dress interpret history to guests from a third-person perspective.

===Name change===
In July 2020, officials announced that the museum would be renamed, noting that their plan, &quot;for some time, has been to announce a new name for the Museum later this year as we commemorate the 400th anniversary (1620–2020) of the Pilgrims&#x27; arrival on the shores of historic Patuxet.&quot; It coincided with a wave of name changes caused by the George Floyd protests that year meant to be more inclusive. While the word &quot;plantation&quot; historically referred to a type of colony, and this was the sense intended for Plimoth Plantation, it soon came to refer to a type of farming estate established to grow cash crops, and in the modern era has become popularly associated with those plantations that employed slave labor, especially in the South. Officials stated that discussions had been ongoing for more than a year to assess whether the existing name reflected &quot;the full, multivalent history that is at the core of the museum&#x27;s mission.&quot; While a new name was not yet revealed, the museum began using a new logo that read &quot;Plimoth Patuxet&quot; instead of &quot;Plimoth Plantation&quot;.

<doc id="901017" wikidata="Q3033511" url="?curid=901017" title="Doctor Fun">
<text>Doctor Fun is a single-panel, gag webcomic by David Farley. It began in September 1993, making it one of the earliest webcomics, and ran until June 2006. &quot;Doctor Fun&quot; was part of United Media&#x27;s website from 1995, but had parted ways by 2003. The comic was one of the longest-running webcomics before it concluded, having run for nearly thirteen years with over 2,600 strips. The webcomic has been compared to &quot;The Far Side&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Doctor Fun&quot; began on September 24, 1993, and has been called &quot;first comic published on the Web&quot;. It was not the first comic series published through the Internet – &quot;Witches and Stitches&quot; was distributed through CompuServe in 1985, and &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot; was distributed though Usenet in 1991 – but it published through the World Wide Web, meaning it appeared on its own webpage rather than being sent out just by mailing lists or other earlier Internet technology. Its creator, Dave Farley, started uploading &quot;Doctor Fun&quot; while working as a computer technician for the library system at the University of Chicago.

In 1995, David Farley was signed by newspaper comic strip syndication service United Media; under the deal, &quot;Doctor Fun&quot; appeared on United Media&#x27;s website. By 2003, Farley&#x27;s contract with United Media had &quot;fallen through.&quot; A book collection was published by Plan Nine Publishing in 2004.

In 2003, Farley said to The News &amp; Observer that &quot;Doctor Fun&quot; was the longest-running webcomic. (This is no longer the case, with longer-running comics such as &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; and &quot;Sluggy Freelance&quot;.) Farley said in 2005 that he hoped to keep doing &quot;Doctor Fun&quot; for at least ten years in total, or 520 weeks. On June 9, 2006, after posting the final page of his 520th week of strips, he announced that his series was concluded. According to a mirror archive, the comic ran every weekday with some weeks off through the years, for nearly thirteen years. Farley produced over 2,600 &quot;Doctor Fun&quot; strips during its run.

&quot;Doctor Fun&quot; was hosted on the digital library and archive project Ibiblio. The Ibiblio page is no longer live on the Internet, but archives exist.

==Content==
Each &quot;Doctor Fun&quot; comic is a single-panel gag. Subjects include science, pop culture, and &quot;outright weirdness&quot;. Farley said in 1994 that he drew the comics &quot;in batches&quot; and that it took about an evening to finish each color cartoon. He drew the comics on paper and scanned them.

== Reception ==
A writer for the National Center for Supercomputing Applications said in the comic&#x27;s first month that the creation of the strip was &quot;a major breakthrough for the Web&quot;.

A columnist for the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; discussed &quot;Doctor Fun&quot; in 1994 in an article on webcomics, or &quot;net.toons&quot; as they called them. The columnist called &quot;Doctor Fun&quot; &quot;a Far Side clone&quot;, describing it as a &quot;one-panel, full-color net.toon with a decidedly twisted outlook&quot; and saying, &quot;Farley&#x27;s appeal is universal&quot;. A brief article in The Daily Telegraph in 2000 recommended &quot;Doctor Fun.&quot;

Farley said in 2003 that &quot;Doctor Fun&quot; received close to 50,000 hits per day.

<doc id="901022" wikidata="Q1382101" url="?curid=901022" title="Streetlight Manifesto">
<text>Streetlight Manifesto is an American ska punk band from New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States, formed in 2002. They released their first album, &quot;Everything Goes Numb&quot;, which was distributed by Victory Records, on August 26, 2003. The band headlined and sold out their first concert at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on December 9, 2003. Several of Streetlight Manifesto&#x27;s members were well known in the New Jersey third wave ska community for their roles in past ska punk bands from that area, primarily Kalnoky&#x27;s Catch 22 and fellow New Jersey band One Cool Guy and several members attended Rutgers.

== History ==

===2001–2002: Formation===
Kalnoky, Ansley and Egan (also from New Jersey) had previously been members of Catch 22. In 2002, Kalnoky gathered a large number of musicians—including Ansley and Egan, several members of One Cool Guy, his brother Achilles, and several of Achilles&#x27; orchestra friends—to perform on the Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution EP, &quot;A Call to Arms&quot;. Included on the five track independently released CD is &quot;Here&#x27;s to Life&quot;, a song which Streetlight Manifesto reworked and included on &quot;Everything Goes Numb&quot;, and a new version of Catch 22&#x27;s &quot;Dear Sergio&quot;, which included a new verse. Both Streetlight and the Bandits are members of The RISC Group, a collaboration of artists to self produce and retain rights to their music.

===2003–2004: &quot;Everything Goes Numb&quot;===
Streetlight Manifesto&#x27;s first recording consisted of a four-track demo EP, featuring the songs &quot;Everything Went Numb&quot;, &quot;Point/Counterpoint&quot;, &quot;The Saddest Song&quot; and &quot;We Are the Few&quot;, all of which were re-recorded for their debut album. The line-up that recorded the demo consisted almost entirely of musicians from Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution: Josh Ansley (bass guitar), Jamie Egan (trombone and trumpet), Tomas Kalnoky (guitar and vocals), Stuart Karmatz (drums), Dan Ross (alto and baritone saxophone) and Pete Sibilia (tenor saxophone). The band was signed to Victory Records, the same label as Catch 22.

After the demo was recorded Karmatz left and was replaced by Paul Lowndes and Jim Conti took the place of Pete Sibilia. This line-up then recorded &quot;Everything Goes Numb&quot;, but changed again before the band could perform any live shows. Jamie Egan played both trumpet and trombone while recording, but as he would not be able to do this live, Mike Soprano joined on trombone. Paul Lowndes had no intention to tour and was replaced by Chris Thatcher.

===2004–2007: More lineup changes and continued touring===
In September 2004, Ansley announced his departure to pursue an acting career. The next departure was Egan, who left on January 22, 2005, before Streetlight Manifesto began the Ska Is Dead 2 tour, headlining alongside MU330 and the Voodoo Glow Skulls. Delano Bonner came in to play trumpet starting on January 25, 2005, performing at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey. Dan Ross had planned to leave after the Ska Is Dead 2 tour to pursue a business career, and was forced to leave early just before the end of the tour due to a family crisis. He would later go on to teach math at Piscataway High School. He has been replaced by Mike Brown, whose first concert was at the start of the European tour. Brown&#x27;s first concert in the United States was on May 31, 2005 in Baltimore.

In April 2005, the band headed overseas to Europe for their first tour outside North America despite personnel difficulties, including visa trouble for various members. Then in October 2005, in Jacksonville, Florida, the band&#x27;s van was broken into; in total around $80,000 worth of instruments, merchandise, and personal belongings were stolen. Following the burglary and theft, the band was forced to cancel their following four shows. In November 2005, they were robbed again, in Paris, France, and the band lost &quot;the one expensive piece of equipment that wasn&#x27;t stolen in last month&#x27;s debacle, a 24 track hard drive recorder we&#x27;ve been using to document our live shows.&quot; Sometime between December 3, 2006 and July 3, 2007, Delano Bonner left the band. Sometime before the recording of &quot;Somewhere in the Between&quot;, Matt Stewart took over for Bonner.

===2006–2010: &quot;Keasbey Nights&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in the Between&quot;===
In 2004, Kalnoky decided to re-record &quot;Keasbey Nights&quot;, originally recorded by his previous band Catch 22. The decision was prompted by Victory Records&#x27; plan to re-release the album with additional content. The Streetlight Manifesto version was originally scheduled to be released in late 2004, but was continually delayed until being released on March 7, 2006.

Streetlight Manifesto&#x27;s second album, &quot;Somewhere in the Between&quot;, was released in November 2007 through Victory Records to generally positive reviews.

===2010–2012: &quot;99 Songs of Revolution&quot;===
&quot;99 Songs of Revolution&quot; is a collaborative project that intended to consist of two full-length albums by Streetlight Manifesto, two full-length albums by the Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution; as well as four other albums, two each by two other Streetlight-related artists. The project consists entirely of cover songs. Volume No. 1 of the project was released by Streetlight Manifesto on March 16, 2010, and is the only volume of the project released as of 2024.

===2012–2016: &quot;The Hands That Thieve&quot;, The End of the Beginning Tour and Victory Records dispute===
On August 22, 2012, the band announced that their new album would be called &quot;The Hands That Thieve&quot;. It was originally set to be released on November 6, 2012. On October 23, however, Tomas addressed the fans of their Facebook page, apologizing that he would need to set the release date back to sometime in January 2013. Victory Records was slated to announce the release date on February 1, 2013, but did not follow through. On February 15, it was announced by Victory Records that the album would be released on April 30, 2013. An acoustic version of the album was released by Toh Kay on the same date with the name &quot;The Hand That Thieves&quot;. The album was leaked on April 19, 2013. The album has received positive reviews.
In February 2013, Victory Records allegedly withheld all copies of &quot;The Hands That Thieve&quot; from both Streetlight Manifesto and those that had pre-ordered the album through Streetlight&#x27;s web store, and barred Streetlight Manifesto from releasing the &quot;Toh Kay&quot; album. The album was available via Victory Records&#x27; website, along with all the major physical retailers. The band called for a boycott of all merchandise and music purchased from Victory Records, be it through online sources such as Amazon.com or through traditional methods of buying physical CDs. They instructed their fans and customers to instead buy merchandise from their website, such as shirts and stickers. Despite the fact that Streetlight allegedly had no physical copies they had been continuously taking pre-orders for the album, which culminated in the band asking customers not to ask for a refund and rather accept an unspecified gift sent instead of the actual album. On May 16 it was announced the mystery gift to be a digipack case containing a blank CD-R with a custom label and 24 page booklet with poems and photos.

On March 1, 2013, Streetlight announced plans to dramatically cut down on touring within the next year:
They continued by announcing their End of the Beginning Tour, a multiple-leg outing that will last until the end of the year. On May 16, 2014, the band announced its only tour for the year, titled Once More Into the Fray, a series of six shows in the North American North East, with support from Dan Potthast and Chris Murray.

On October 20, 2015, after years of poor relations between Streetlight Manifesto and Victory Records, media outlets reported of a $1,000,000 lawsuit filed against Kalnoky. The lawsuit was filed in regard to the band not fulfilling their record deal of four studio albums to be released under Victory Records. The band released five albums under Victory Records however, Victory claims that &quot;... the band agreed not to count this album as one of the four albums under its contract to receive a $10,000 emergency advance.&quot; Victory also claims that the album 99 Songs of Revolution: Vol. 1 does not count towards the contract due to it being a covers album. The lawsuit claims the $1,000,000 is to be paid for Streetlight not fulfilling their four-album record deal, as well as damages for copyright infringement relating to the release of their last album, &quot;The Hands That Thieve&quot;, in which Kalnoky released an acoustic version of the album under his pseudonym Toh Kay titled &quot;The Hand That Thieves&quot;. Kalnoky took to the band&#x27;s Twitter account to comment on the removal of the Victory catalog from streaming service Spotify:&quot;Ironically, @victoryrecords hasn&#x27;t paid us a cent in royalties in over 2 yrs. More info soon. #irony #douchenuggets&quot;On October 23 the band uploaded the following statement to their Facebook page:&quot;THE REPORTS ARE SIMPLY NOT TRUE. Tony Brummel / Victory Records are NOT suing Tomas for $1 Million… ...He&#x27;s actually suing Tomas for FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.&quot;

During the second leg of The Last Good Fight Tour, it was revealed that Dan Ross had returned to the band, now playing alto and tenor saxophone. It was also revealed that Nadav Nirenberg had parted ways with the band and been replaced by Karl Lyden.

===2017–present: Independence and sixth studio album===
On April 19, 2017, Streetlight Manifesto and Victory Records issued a joint statement that the two parties had reached a settlement under which the band left the record label, and the record label sold the band all master recordings for an undisclosed sum.

On July 27, 2021, Streetlight announced plans to release a sixth studio album &quot;sometime in 2022.&quot; On an Instagram post at the start of 2023, they stated they were slowly approaching the end of that endeavor.

On December 16, 2022, Streetlight teased a new song, titled &quot;Mayday&quot;, at their performance at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, NJ, during their The Calm Before The Chaos Tour. 

Trumpet player Matthew Stewart died on September 10, 2023, at the age of 41. Following Stewart&#x27;s passing, Mike Soprano returned to the band on trumpet and trombone for September shows in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Soprano would later be replaced by Joshua Gawel of brass-funk band Lucky Chops.

On April 25, 2024, Streetlight Manifesto announced information about the new album. The album is close to finished, according to the band. The album is long, but &quot;in length of each song, complexity of parts, variety of melodies, etc.&quot; On December 14th, at the last show of the year, Tomas stated that the album was going to be pushed back to the first half of 2025.

==Musical influences and style==
Kalnoky writes the band&#x27;s songs on an acoustic guitar and then fleshes out the song structure on the computer and hums basic hornlines, after which the rest of the band comes in and adds their parts. He has cited the soundtrack of the film &quot;Stand By Me&quot; as his biggest musical influence, and stated that he looks to the 1950s and 1960s for inspiration when writing. For &quot;Somewhere in the Between&quot; he sought to &quot;branch out in different directions&quot;, adding &quot;eastern European and gypsy sounds&quot; to give the album &quot;a world influence&quot;.

<doc id="901027" wikidata="Q5030267" url="?curid=901027" title="Canadian Junior Football League">
<text>The Canadian Junior Football League (CJFL) is a national Canadian football league consisting of 19 teams playing in five provinces across Canada. The teams compete annually for the Canadian Bowl. Many CJFL players move on to professional football careers in the Canadian Football League (CFL) and elsewhere.

Formed May 8, 1974, the CJFL&#x27;s formal mission statement is: &quot;The Canadian Junior Football League provides the opportunity for young men aged 17 to 22 to participate in highly competitive post-high school football that is unique in Canada. The goal of the league is to foster community involvement and yield a positive environment by teaching discipline, perseverance and cooperation. The benefits of the league are strong camaraderie, national competition and life-long friends.&quot;

A handful of standout players are typically signed directly to CFL rosters each season, while U Sports permits up to two years of play in leagues such as the CJFL before a player begins to lose eligibility.

The 9-team Quebec Junior Football League was formerly part of the CJFL, but eventually withdrew and now operates independently. Meanwhile, The Ontario Football Conference (OFC) consists of two divisions: Varsity Division (ages 11 to 19) and Junior Division (ages 17 to 22). While the Junior Division remains affiliated to the CJFL and its teams compete for the Canadian Bowl, the Varsity Division is operated solely by the OFC.

== Teams ==

The CJFL has 19 teams as of 2024, including 7 in the B.C. conference, 6 in the Prairie conference, and 6 in the Ontario conference.

==History==
The ancient Indian kingdom of Chedi had its capital at Suktimati, which was located at Sagar during contemporary times. The history of Sagar District before 1022 A.D. is generally unknown; after that, records are available. Sagar was under the rule of Ahir Rajas and their capital was at Garhpehra. In 1660, Udenshah founded the present town of Sagar.

After 1735, the city came under the rule of the Peshwas. When Chhatrasal gave a region (Subha) to Bajirao, he appointed Govindpant Kher (later Bundele) as an administrator. Govindpant founded the city of Sagar next to the Sagar Lake and made the city his capital. In 1818, a large part of the Sagar district was ceded by Peshwa Baji Rao II to the British East India Company. Administratively, the position of Sagar and the neighbouring territories underwent frequent changes.

The Saugor territory was first placed under the superintendent of Political Affairs of Bundelkhand. Later, in 1820, this area, called the &#x27;Saugor and Nerbudda Territories,&#x27; was placed under the administration of an agent to the governor-general. The region fell under the North-Western Province, following its constitution in 1835. In 1842 occurred the Bundela rising, the quelling of which demanded more direct attention from the Governor-General. But the order was restored in the following year, and the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories were again placed under the political control of an Agent named to the Governor-General. The arrangement, however, was not found to be satisfactory, and these territories were once again restored to the North-Western Provinces in 1853. After that in 1861, the Saugor and Nerbudda territories and the Nagpur state formed a Commissioner&#x27;s Province called Central Provinces.
