<text>The University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus (; UPR-RP, or informally La IUPI) is a public land-grant research university in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It is the largest campus in the University of Puerto Rico system in terms of student population and it was Puerto Rico&#x27;s first public university campus.

The university serves more than 18,000 students, 20% of whom are graduate students, and grants an average of over 3,000 degrees a year. Its academic offerings range from the bachelor to the doctoral level with 70 undergraduate programs and 19 graduate degrees including 71 specializations in the basic disciplines and professional fields. UPR‐RP has consistently granted the largest number of doctorate degrees to Hispanic students under the United States jurisdiction.

== History ==
In the year 1900 the &quot;Escuela Normal Industrial&quot; (Normal Industrial School) was established in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, as the first institution of higher education in Puerto Rico dedicated to train those who would become teachers and educators. At the time it only had 20 students and 5 professors.

A year later (1901) the institution was moved to an area previously occupied by farmland immediately north of the town of Río Piedras, today part of the municipality of San Juan. The Normal School was established in &quot;La Convalecencia&quot;, which was one of the residences of the former Spanish Governors. The school enrolled 273 students on its first year, and its first bachelor&#x27;s degrees were granted four years later in 1907.

On March 12, 1903, under the administration of the Public Instruction Commissioner, Samuel McCune Lindsay, the 2nd Legislative Assembly approved a law creating the University of Puerto Rico in Río Piedras, transferring all the funding of the Insular Normal School there. This school became the first department of the university, what is now the Faculty of Education, becoming the nucleus of the University of Puerto Rico.

Now legally established, the University of Puerto Rico started its first academic year (1903–1904) with an enrollment of 173 students. Due to the scarcity of teachers in the island, most of these students were appointed by the Department of Public Instruction to teach at schools without having finished four years of college. The first graduating class (June 1907) consisted of 13 students.

In 1907, the first class graduated from the normal course of four years after the university was legally established. Among the students in that class were Carlota Matienzo, Isabel Andréu, Loaíza Cordero, Marina Roviro, and Juan Herrero.

On September 22, 1913, the departments of Law and Pharmacology were established. The university at the time required only an eighth grade diploma, but with the expansion of its courses, this requirement changed. After 1917, the departments of Normal Education, Liberal Arts, Pharmacology, and Law required a high school diploma for admission.

On February 21, 1931, Dr. Carlos E. Chardón was appointed as chancellor of the university. During his tenure the university experienced significant growth in endowments. These were used in the expansion of the physical facilities at the Río Piedras and Mayagüez Campuses. This helped turn the university into a respected educational center. Chardón resigned from the post of Chancellor in 1936, being succeeded by Juan B. Soto. The most important part of this period was the expansion of the buildings of the university as part of a plan for the rehabilitation of Puerto Rico.

=== History of student protests ===
The university was the site of social upheaval during the 1960s and 1970s, when nationalist students protested for civil rights, against the war in Vietnam, for the independence of Puerto Rico, and to expel the ROTC from the campus. In 1970 Antonia Martínez was murdered by the police during the anti-education reform and Vietnam War protests of that year. As the shouting started in the street, everyone in the building she was in, on Ponce de León Avenue, went to the balconies to see what was happening. She was, like many others, watching the events, saw policemen attacking at the students, and allegedly shouted at the police &quot;¡Asesinos!&quot; (Assassins!). A policeman turned and shot her in the head, killing her and injuring a roommate. A mural of her and her story existed on the College of Humanities, until administrative personnel covered it with paint. Other stories claim that she was shot by mistake. The students of the university also had a strike in the Spring of 2017 during which the school was shut down for several months.

== Campus and academic facilities ==
The Río Piedras Campus is located in the northern end of the downtown area of Río Piedras, a former town but now a district (&quot;barrio&quot;) of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The campus is easily accessible via public transportation by means of the Tren Urbano metro system with a station (Universidad) located in campus, and the public bus system of San Juan (AMA). The campus is home to a rich diversity in architecture and urban planning with old and modern buildings that showcase the architectural development of the past 120 years in Puerto Rican architecture.

=== &quot;La Torre&quot; and the Quadrangle ===

In 1936, architect Rafael Carmoega, working under the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA), designed the distinctive University of Puerto Rico clock tower based on the 1924 Parsons Plan. The iconic university clock tower was built in 1937 and christened as the Franklin Delano Roosevelt tower, in honor of the president and his interest in the building of the university. &quot;La Torre&quot; (as &quot;The Tower&quot; is nicknamed in Spanish) is located at the entrance of the Román Baldorioty de Castro Building. Right below the tower there is a monument to the nations of the Americas portraying the coats of arms of all American states within a bronze circle, as a symbol of the Panamerican Union. Under the supervision of architect Rafael Carmoega, a group of local architects designed what is known as &quot;El Cuadrángulo&quot; (The Quadrangle), a plaza-like quadrangle. The campus&#x27;s central quadrangle and tower were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

=== Campus architecture ===

The University of Puerto Rico was established in Río Piedras in 1903. The first buildings were the Normal School (1902), the Model School (1903), and the Principal&#x27;s Residence (1903), next to the Central Road (today Ponce de Leon Avenue). Over the years, the development of the university occurred somewhat spontaneously. In 1908 the architectural firm of &quot;Clark, Howe and Homer&quot; designed a new façade for the Model School in the California Mission Style. In 1909 a milk processing building was constructed in an agricultural area, east of the academic center. Arts and Crafts&#x27; Workshop buildings, a Library and a Gymnasium were planned, as well as the grandstand and the fence (all demolished now). In 1912 construction began for the Memorial Hall (Baldorioty Building) and buildings for the Law School and the School of Pharmacy were in the works in 1918. In 1924 the Chicago firm of urbanists &quot;Bennett, Parsons and Frost&quot; were contacted to design a master plan for the future development of the university. It was not until 1935, with the establishment of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA) and the large sum of federal funds that it invested for public works in Puerto Rico, that the partial design and construction of the so-called &quot;Parson Plan&quot; began. However, from the 1940s onward a new architectural paradigm, which discarded historical vocabularies and incorporated attitudes learned from Germany and from the studio of Frank Lloyd Wright, stemmed from German émigré Henry Klumb. For 20 years Klumb was sole architect for the University of Puerto Rico, designing buildings for the campuses at Río Piedras and Mayagüez until in 1966. At that time chancellor Jaime Benítez assigned the design of the General Studies Building to the architectural firm of Toro &amp; Ferrer. Other buildings for the university have been designed by architects Antonio Marqués Carrión (sports facilities, 1971); José Firpi (student residence &quot;Torre Norte&quot;, 1971); the firm of Reed, Torres, Beauchamp &amp; Marvel (new Education Faculty Building, 1974 and the first expansion to the Faculty of Natural Sciences Building, 1978); the firm of García &amp; Landray (second expansion the Faculty of Natural Sciences Building, 1989); GDO Arquitectos (School of Architecture Building, 2001) and Toro Ferrer (new General Studies Building, 2007).

In addition to &quot;La Torre&quot; and The Quagrangle, several buildings in the UPR-RP campus have been added to the National Register of Historic Places, such as the former female residence hall &quot;Residencia de Señoritas&quot; building which now houses administrative offices.

=== Library system ===
The university library serves the research and teaching needs of the university community. It also extends its services to the Puerto Rican community at large. The system comprises eighteen specialized and general libraries, with holdings totaling more than 4,000,000 items, access to which may be gained through the university&#x27;s online catalog. Of special interest are the Caribbean and Latin American Studies Library and the Puerto Rican Collection, both located in the José M. Lázaro Building.

In addition to the traditional library services, such as reference, circulation, reserves, photocopying, local interlibrary loan, and the compilation of bibliographies and acquisition lists, the Library System also participates in on-line interlibrary loans with many libraries worldwide. Other services include Dial Order, DIALOG, microfilming, reproduction of photographs, library instruction and orientation, lectures, and exhibits. The Integration of the Information Competencies to the Curriculum Projects promotes the development of information competencies around the campus. The Library System offers facilities for the blind and physically handicapped. The graduate and special collections in the Business Administration, Planning, Public Administration, Social Work, and Library Science programs are integral parts of the Library System, but the libraries of the School of Law, Natural Sciences Faculty, and the School of Architecture, also located on the university campus, operate independently.

=== Information system ===
The Information Systems Office serves the educational, research and administrative efforts of the institution. As a member of Internet2 and the Internet, the university enjoys instant communication with institutions all over the world for the purposes of correspondence and information access. Improvements to existing telecommunications infrastructure include the installation of structured cabling in campus buildings and fiber optics as a means of interconnecting them. Currently, campus buildings are configured to ATM (155Mbits / s) and Gigabit Ethernet interfacing equipment, providing greater capacity to transfer video, voice and data. The campus is capable of offering video conferencing over ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), or via the Internet in H.323 format.

=== University museums ===

The &quot;Museum of Art, History, and Anthropology&quot; (MAHA) was created in 1951 by legislative act to &quot;complete and preserve our art, history, and anthropological heritage,&quot; as a means to educate and enrich our culture. The current building, designed by the architect Henry Klumb, was inaugurated in 1959. Since its establishment, the museum has actively contributed to the growth of Puerto Rican cultural life by holding art, historical, and anthropological exhibits and sponsoring lectures, seminars, publications, and workshops–to the benefit of both the academic and the general communities.

=== Housing ===
The Río Piedras campus provides housing in three residence halls:

* &quot;Torre del Norte (Currently Closed)&quot;; a 22-story building located within a block of the campus. It has capacity to house 437 students in double and single units.
* &quot;ResiCampus&quot;; located within the campus consists of a structure of nine floors and have a capacity to house 354 students.
* &quot;Plaza Universitaria Residence Hall&quot;; administered by a private company in consortium to UPR; offers housing to undergraduate and graduate students.
There is also a Guest House within the Student Center, with rooms at affordable rates for visitors to the university, faculty, or students.

10% of first-year and 4% of all undergraduates live in college housing. No married student housing is available. Also, private housing is available in surrounding areas of the university.

== Organization ==
The Río Piedras Campus is a collegiate university. The Chancellor of the Campus is the top academic and administrative officer and presides over its two deliberative bodies: the Administrative Board and the Academic Senate.

=== Administrative Board ===
The &quot;Administrative Board&quot;, composed of the deans, two senators representing the faculty, and one student senator, advises the Chancellor in matters pertaining to the university program. The Board makes recommendations on leaves and faculty aid applications, and grants promotions and tenures.

=== Academic Senate ===
The &quot;Academic Senate&quot;, in turn, is the official academic forum. It is composed of the deans, the director of the library system, elected faculty representatives from all the colleges and schools, student senators, and representatives from the staff of academic advisors. Its members participate on the institutional processes, establishing academic rules and collaborating with other organisms of the University of Puerto Rico system.

=== Student Councils ===
The &quot;General Student Council&quot; (&quot;Consejo General de Estudiantes&quot; or CGE in Spanish) of the UPRRP is the elected student government of the campus. The council is composed of several representatives to the student council, elected by each School or College, the number of representatives varies depending on the number of students enrolled in the School or College, and the President and Senator of each School and College, for a total of around 50 members. Elections are held in April and representatives are elected for one year, from July 1 to June 30.

Having its origins in the 1920s, the Student Council was dissolved in 1948 while Jaime Benitez was chancellor, and under the council presidency of Juan Mari Brás and it was not until 1968 that the Student Council was re-installed under the name General Student Council and under the council presidency of David Noriega.

The General Student Council is governed by the Board of Directors, which is elected from among the council&#x27;s members and is composed of:

* President
* Vice President
* Executive Secretary
* Press Secretary
* Public Relations Secretary
* Records Clerk

Additionally, they select Representatives to the Campus&#x27; Administrative Board and the university&#x27;s University Board, both of them with an Alternate Representative. They are members of the board of directors.

Every College and School has a student council of its own, composed by a President, Vice President, Executive Secretary, Treasurer, Records Clerk, Public Relations Chair, the college or School&#x27;s Student Senator (and, if available for the college/school, an alternate senator), Representatives to the General Student Council (up to four), and representatives of each department or subdivision present in the School or College.

=== Colleges organization ===
Colleges have a dean, an associate dean, assistant deans, department chairs, and other administrative directors. In August 2019, the president-elect of the College of Business Administration Student Council, Alberto J. Lebrón, established the university&#x27;s first independent college board, founding the UPRRP College of Business Administration Directive Board, composed of two representatives from each of the college&#x27;s associations and student council directives, with Lebrón serving as the board&#x27;s first chairman. Each college also has several committees established; examples being the school or college&#x27;s advisors committee, the curriculum committee, and the accreditation committee.

=== Deanery ===

<text>David John Mazzucchelli (; born September 21, 1960) is an American comics artist and writer, known for his work on seminal superhero comic book storylines &quot;Daredevil: Born Again&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as for graphic novels in other genres, such as &quot;Asterios Polyp&quot; and &quot;City of Glass: The Graphic Novel&quot;. He is also an instructor who teaches comic book storytelling at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.

==Career==
Mazzucchelli received his BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design, and started working in comics in the early 1980s, first at Marvel Comics where, after a few fill-in jobs, he became the regular artist on &quot;Daredevil&quot;. He worked with writer Denny O&#x27;Neil and culminated his work on this title with the &quot;Daredevil: Born Again&quot; (Feb.–Aug. 1986) story arc, written by Frank Miller.

Miller and Mazzucchelli collaborated again on the graphic novel &quot;&quot;, serialized in issues #404–407 (Feb.–May 1987) of DC Comics&#x27; monthly &quot;Batman&quot; title, and published in a single volume shortly afterwards. &quot;Batman: Year One&quot; is considered one of the best Batman stories ever produced. Mazzucchelli had previously drawn Batman in a five page backup story in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #302 (April 1984).

After &quot;Batman: Year One&quot;, Mazzucchelli drew an Angel story in &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; #40 (Oct. 1988). He then moved on to focus on more personal projects. He published three issues of his own independent anthology, &quot;Rubber Blanket&quot;, co-edited by his wife, painter Richmond Lewis, in which he began finding his voice as a writer in addition to exploring new avenues of visual expression. His evocative and haunting stories in &quot;Rubber Blanket&quot;, notably &quot;Near Miss,&quot; &quot;Dead Dog,&quot; &quot;Discovering America,&quot; and &quot;Big Man,&quot; set the stage for his work to come. Mazzucchelli&#x27;s work in &quot;Rubber Blanket&quot;, and especially his use of two-color printing to create his artwork, influenced a number of young indie-comics artists through the 1990s and 2000s, including Darwyn Cooke, Frank Santoro, and Dash Shaw. With writer/artist Paul Karasik, he co-wrote and illustrated an adaptation of Paul Auster&#x27;s &quot;City of Glass&quot;, published first by Avon Books in 1994, then by Picador in 2004 as &quot;City of Glass: The Graphic Novel&quot;. Auster&#x27;s later book &quot;The Brooklyn Follies&quot; features a character with the name Nancy Mazzucchelli, an homage to David. He continued to write and draw short comics for various publishers until 2000. Mazzucchelli was one of the artists on the &quot;Superman and Batman: World&#x27;s Funnest&quot; one-shot written by Evan Dorkin.

In 2009, Pantheon Books published Mazzucchelli&#x27;s graphic novel, &quot;Asterios Polyp&quot;. The book was named a New York Times Notable Book for that year, and won the 2010 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for graphic novels.

Mazzucchelli has done illustrations for various publications, including interior pieces and covers for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; In 2011, an of &quot;Batman: Year One&quot; was released by Warner Home Video.

Mazzucchelli has taught a cartooning course for BFA students at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.

<text>Robert Frederic Schenkkan Jr. (born March 19, 1953) is an American playwright, screenwriter, and actor. He received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1992 for his play &quot;The Kentucky Cycle&quot; and his play &quot;All the Way&quot; earned the 2014 Tony Award for Best Play. He has three Emmy nominations and one WGA Award.

==Early years==
Schenkkan was born in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the son of Jean Gregory (née McKenzie) and Robert Frederic Schenkkan, a professor in the Department of Radio-Television-Film at The University of Texas at Austin, and public television executive. He grew up in Austin, Texas. As a Plan II Honors student he received a B.A. in Drama, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, from the University of Texas, Austin in 1975 (Phi Beta Kappa, Friars&#x27; Society, UT Texas Exes Distinguished Young Alumnus Award and E. William Doty College of Fine Arts Distinguished Alumnus Award), and an M.F.A. in Theatre Arts from Cornell University in 1977. For many years, he lived in New York City and then Los Angeles, California, working both as a writer and an actor in film, television, and theatre. Since 1990 he has focused exclusively on his writing and divides his time between New York City and Seattle. Schenkkan is of Dutch-Jewish (father), and Scottish and English (mother) descent.

==Career==
Schenkkan is the author of ten full-length plays. &quot;By the Waters of Babylon&quot; premiered at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in February, 2005. The play is unrelated to the Stephen Vincent Benét short story &quot;By the Waters of Babylon&quot; or its subsequent adaptation. &quot;Lewis and Clark Reach the Euphrates&quot; premiered at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in December 2005. &quot;The Marriage of Miss Hollywood and King Neptune&quot; premiered at the University of Texas at Austin in November 2005. &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; premiered at the Seattle Children&#x27;s Theatre in February 2006.

&quot;Handler&quot;, a play dealing with a snake handling church, premiered at the Actors Express Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia. &quot;Heaven On Earth&quot; won the Julie Harris/Beverly Hills Theatre Guild Award, participated in the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Playwright&#x27;s Conference, and premiered Off-Broadway at the WPA Theatre. &quot;Final Passages&quot; premiered at the Studio Arena theatre. &quot;Tachinoki&quot; premiered at the Ensemble Studio Theatre in Los Angeles and was designated a Critic&#x27;s Choice by the LA Weekly. His other play for young audiences, &quot;The Dream Thief&quot;, had its premier at Milwaukee&#x27;s First Stage.
Schenkkan has written numerous one-act plays which are collected together and published by Dramatists Play Service as &quot;Conversations With the Spanish Lady&quot;. Among them is &quot;The Survivalist&quot; which premiered at Actors Theatre of Louisville&#x27;s Humana festival, went on to the EST Marathon in NYC, Canada&#x27;s DuMaurier Festival, and the Edinburgh Festival where it won the &quot;Best of the Fringe&quot; award.

&quot;The Kentucky Cycle&quot; underwent several years of development, starting in New York City at New Dramatists and the Ensemble Studio Theatre. The two part epic was later workshopped at the Mark Taper Forum, EST-LA, the Long Wharf Theatre, and the Sundance Institute. The complete &quot;cycle&quot; was awarded the largest grant ever given by the Fund for New American Plays and had its world premiere in 1991 at the Intiman Theatre in Seattle (Liz Huddle, producer) where it set box office records. In 1992, it was the centerpiece of the Mark Taper forum&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Season. It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the first time in the history of the award that a play was so honored which had not first been presented in New York City. It also won both the PEN Centre West and the L.A. Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Play. In 1993 it appeared at the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and opened on Broadway in November of that year where it was nominated for a Tony, Drama Desk, and Outer Critics Circle awards.

His play &quot;All the Way&quot;, about the behind-the-scenes political maneuvering of President Lyndon Baines Johnson to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964, premiered at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival on July 28, 2012. Schenkkan describes this work as a play about &quot;the morality of politics and power.&quot; &quot;All the Way&quot; won the 2012 ATCA/Steinberg Award for Best Play and the inaugural Edward M. Kennedy Prize for Drama Inspired by History. It opened in Boston at the American Repertory Theater on September 19, 2013, starring Bryan Cranston and sold out its entire run. The play had its Broadway premiere on March 6, 2014, at the Neil Simon Theatre, and was awarded the 2014 Tony Award for Best Play, with Cranston also winning a Tony Award for his performance as Lyndon Baines Johnson. A sequel, titled &quot;The Great Society&quot;, premiered at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in July 2014 and on Broadway in September 2019. Additionally he wrote &quot;Building the Wall&quot; in the run-up to the 2016 Presidential election.

Schenkkan&#x27;s film work includes: &quot;The Quiet American&quot;, directed by Phillip Noyce and starring Michael Caine (who received an Oscar nomination). For television he wrote four episodes of &quot;The Pacific&quot; (HBO, 2010) for which he was nominated for two Emmy Awards and won a WGA Award for Best Miniseries writing. Other television work includes &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (A&amp;E, 2009), &quot;Spartacus&quot; (USA Network, 2006), and &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; (TNT). In 2005, he was hired by Sony Pictures to develop a script based on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Killraven&quot;. Schenkkan was also named as the writer for the adaptation of the comic book &quot;Incognito&quot; published by the Marvel imprint Icon Comics. In 2016, his television adaptation of &quot;All the Way&quot; was filmed for HBO, with Cranston reprising his role as Lyndon Baines Johnson, and premiered in May. Also that year, he co-wrote the war drama film &quot;Hacksaw Ridge&quot;, directed by Mel Gibson.

Schenkkan is the recipient of grants from New York State, the California Arts Council, and the Vogelstein and the Arthur foundations. He is a New Dramatists alumnus and a member of the Ensemble Studio Theatre and the National Theatre Conference. He was the 2012 Thornton Wilder Fellow at the MacDowell Colony and a member of the College of Fellows of the American Theater.

As an actor, Schenkkan has appeared in numerous roles, including the 1989 film &quot;Out Cold&quot;; he also starred in the 1990 cult drama teen film &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot;, in which he played David Deaver, the high school guidance counselor. He appeared as Lieutenant Commander Dexter Remmick in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episodes &quot;Coming of Age&quot; and &quot;Conspiracy&quot;.

==Personal life==
Schenkkan has been married twice. His first marriage was to Mary Anne Dorward in 1984, and produced two children, Sarah Schenkkan and Joshua Schenkkan. The couple divorced in 1999. His second marriage was to the writer Maria Dahvana Headley in 2004. They divorced in 2012. Schenkkan is an uncle of actor Ben McKenzie.

<doc id="874605" wikidata="Q1187603" url="?curid=874605" title="Hang Tuah">
<text>Hang Tuah (Jawi: , from /tuha/ or /toh/ (توه)), according to the semi-historical &quot;Malay Annals&quot; (), was a warrior and Laksamana (equivalent to modern-day Admiral) who lived in Malacca during the reign of Sultan Mansur Shah in the 15th century. However, there is limited historical evidence for his existence. He was supposedly a great laksamana, or admiral, a diplomat and a silat master. Hang Tuah is the most illustrious warrior figure in Malay literature. He is however, a somewhat controversial figure and there is much in dispute about the factual basis of Hang Tuah&#x27;s story.

== Historicity ==
The veracity of Hang Tuah has been the subject of debate of historians for a century. In 2012, historian Khoo Kay Kim, noted that there was no historical evidence for Hang Tuah&#x27;s existence. Since 2016, some historians have suggested that Hang Tuah is referred to in the Rekidai Hoan, an official record from the Ryukyu Islands. The document spans the period from the 15th to the 19th century and records the arrival of a certain admiral from Malacca. The document mentions the word &quot;Lezoumana&quot; or &quot;Lo-hsi-ma-na&quot; (Laksamana), Hang Tuah&#x27;s supposed title, according to the Malay Annals. However, since Hang Tuah is not mentioned by name, this claim remains unproven.

==Ethnicity==
Regardless of the historicity of Hang Tuah, his ethnicity is the source of some dispute. Legend has it that Hang Tuah had aboriginal Malay ancestry. In the early 21st century, there arose an unfounded cybermyth that Hang Tuah was of Chinese descent.

== Legend ==
According to legend, Hang Tuah learns silat together with his four comrades, Hang Kasturi, Hang Jebat, Hang Lekir and Hang Lekiu. Their teacher is Adi Putra, a renowned master who lived a hermetic life at the top of a mountain. The comrades encounter and deal with a man running amok. Following this incident, Hang Tuah is presented to Sultan Muzaffar Shah of Malacca by his bendahara, Tun Perak.
Hang Tuah&#x27;s career as an admiral or laksamana includes tales of his absolute and unfaltering loyalty to his Sultan, some of which are chronicled in &quot;Sejarah Melayu&quot; (the semi-historical Malay Annals) and &quot;Hikayat Hang Tuah&quot; (a romantic collection of tales involving Hang Tuah).

Hang Tuah is said to have become the sultan&#x27;s constant aide, accompanying the king on official visits to foreign countries. On one such visit to Majapahit, Hang Tuah fights a duel with the famed pendekar Taming Sari. After this brutal fight Hang Tuah emerges as winner, and then Singhavikramavardhana, the ruler of Majapahit, bestows upon him Taming Sari&#x27;s kris or dagger. The Keris Taming Sari was named after its original owner, and is purported to be magical, empowering its owner with physical invulnerability.

Hang Tuah is also said to have acted as the sultan&#x27;s ambassador, travelling on the king&#x27;s behalf to allied countries. Another story concerning Hang Tuah&#x27;s loyalty to the ruler is found in the Hikayat Hang Tuah, and involves his visit to Inderaputra or Pahang during one such voyage. The sultan sends Hang Tuah to Pahang with the task of persuading the princess Tun Teja, who was already engaged, to become the sultan&#x27;s companion. Tun Teja falls under the impression that Hang Tuah had come to persuade her to marry him, not the sultan, and agrees to elope with him to Malacca. It was only during the voyage home that Hang Tuah reveals his deception to Tun Teja. The Hikayat Hang Tuah and Sejarah Melayu each carry different accounts of this incident. The Hikayat records that it is Hang Tuah who persuades Tun Teja to elope with him, thus deceiving her.

Perhaps the most famous story in which Hang Tuah is involved is the fight with his closest childhood companion, Hang Jebat. Hang Tuah&#x27;s deep loyalty to and popularity with the sultan leads to rumours being circulated that Hang Tuah is having an illicit affair with one of the sultan&#x27;s &quot;dayang&quot; (court stewardesses). The sultan then sentences Hang Tuah to death without trial for the alleged offence. The death sentence is not carried out, however, because Hang Tuah&#x27;s executioner, the &quot;bendahara&quot; (chief minister), goes against the sultan&#x27;s orders and hides Hang Tuah in a remote region of Malacca.

The story continues, with Hang Jebat, believing that Hang Tuah was dead, murdered unjustly by the king he served. Hang Jebat then decides to avenge his friend&#x27;s death. Hang Jebat&#x27;s revenge allegedly becomes a palace killing spree or furious rebellion against the sultan (sources differ as to what actually occurred). It remains consistent, however, that Hang Jebat wreaks havoc onto the royal court, and the sultan is unable to stop him, as none of the warriors dares to challenge the more ferocious and skilled Hang Jebat. The bendahara then informs the sultan that the only man who is able to stop Hang Jebat, Hang Tuah, is still alive. The bendahara recalls Hang Tuah from his hiding place and the warrior is given full amnesty by the sultan and is instructed to kill Hang Jebat. After seven gruelling days of fighting, Hang Tuah is able to kill Hang Jebat.

The two main sources for Hang Tuah differ yet again on the details of the final aspect of his life. According to the &quot;Hikayat Hang Tuah&quot;, it is Hang Jebat who avenges his friend&#x27;s death, only to be killed by the same friend, but according to &quot;Sejarah Melayu&quot;, it is Hang Kasturi. The Sejarah Melayu or the Malay Annals are unique in that they constitute the only available account of the history of the Malay Sultanate in the 15th and early 16th century, but the Hang Jebat story, as the more romantic tale, remains more popular.

Hang Tuah is said to continue to serve Malacca after the death of Hang Jebat. Later in life, Hang Tuah is ordered by Sultan Mahmud Shah to court a princess on the sultan&#x27;s behalf. The Puteri Gunung Ledang (Princess of Mount Ledang) was so named because she resided on Mount Ledang at the Malacca-Johor border. According to legend, the Princess meets with Hang Tuah, and only agrees to marry the sultan if he satisfies a list of requirements, or pre-wedding gifts. The list includes a golden bridge linking Malacca with the top of Gunung Ledang, seven trays of mosquito livers, seven jars of virgins&#x27; tears and a bowl of the sultan&#x27;s first-born son&#x27;s blood. Hang Tuah knows the tasks will not be fulfilled, and is so overwhelmed that he fails his king that he flings his kris into a river and vows only to return to Malacca if it resurfaces, which it never does. He then vanishes into thin air. 

According to other sources, Hang Tuah lives to an old age, and his body is buried in Tanjung Kling in Malacca, where his tomb can still be seen today; however some say his body is actually buried elsewhere. Other sources state that, following the arrival of the Portuguese, Hang Tuah moves to Singapura.

== Legacy ==
Hang Tuah remains popular in Malaysia, embodying the values of allegiance and loyalty. The legend of the tragic friendship between Hang Tuah and Hang Jebat represents the conflict between loyalty and justice.

Hang Tuah is associated with the saying, &quot;Takkan Melayu hilang di dunia, selagi berpegang teguh kepada Agama Islam,&quot; meaning, &quot;Never shall Malays vanish from the earth, as long as they adhere to the religion of Islam&quot;. The saying is a rallying cry for Malay nationalism. It was popularised by well known local author Abdul Ahmad Samad in his 1950 literary work, &quot;Dosaku&quot;. However, there is no historical record attributing the saying to Hang Tuah, nor is the quote found in the &quot;Hikayat Hang Tuah&quot; .

<text>Walter Moberly (August 15, 1832 – May 15, 1915) was a civil engineer and surveyor who played a large role in the early exploration and development of British Columbia, Canada, including discovering Eagle Pass, now used by the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Trans-Canada Highway.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Steeple Aston, Oxfordshire, England in 1832. In 1834, Walter moved with his family to Penetanguishene, Upper Canada (now Ontario), where his father, Capt. John Moberly, R. N. was appointed Post Commander. Walter received his primary education at the Base and later went to grammar school in Barrie.

==Career==
During the construction of the railway to Collingwood, Walter worked clearing bush and following that, chose a career of Lumberman, with timber holdings in Essa and Tossorontio, near Angus, and on the Severn River, in Muskoka. Most of his survey work was in British Columbia, and Utah.

It is thought that Walter was lured to the West, following a brief visit by Henry to the family home at Barrie, Ontario. From Ontario, Walter sailed via Cape Horn to reach British Columbia, a trip of over 16,000 miles as opposed to around 2,000 miles overland.

His first survey work was laying out the streets for the community of New Westminster, now a suburb of Vancouver. Between 1861 and 1864 he worked on several government road building contracts. With Edgar Dewdney, Moberly helped construct the Dewdney Trail across the Coast Range from the town of Hope into the Okanagan. Also under contract from the government, Moberly was involved in building a section of the Cariboo Road north of Lytton in the Fraser River canyon. This road was built to provide access to the gold fields in the Cariboo.

In 1865, he was appointed Assistant Surveyor General of the Colony of British Columbia. His job was to explore new routes for travel and trade for the growing population of the territory. It was during this time that he discovered Eagle Pass through the Gold Range between Shuswap Lake in the north Okanagan and the Columbia River at what is now Revelstoke. The story is that he shot at an eagle&#x27;s nest and watched the birds fly up a valley. Reasoning that the birds were unlikely to fly up a blocked valley, he followed them up and discovered the pass. In his recollections, he says he blazed a tree in the pass and inscribed the words, &quot;This is the Pass of the Overland Railway.&quot; The Canadian Pacific Railway did go through his pass but not for another 20 years.

After 1865, he left the province and worked in the mining fields of Utah.

In 1871, when British Columbia was about to enter Confederation with Canada, one of the terms was a promise by Canada to build a railway across the continent. Moberly was sought out by Joseph Trutch, British Columbia&#x27;s first provincial Lieutenant-Governor, and invited back to organize surveys for the railway. His survey crews headed out into the wilderness on the day the province joined confederation. Moberly&#x27;s survey crews were responsible for the territory around what is now Eagle Pass, Revelstoke, and Golden. From the time of his discovery of Eagle Pass, he formed the conviction that this was the best route for the railway. However, Sandford Fleming, Chief Engineer of the railway project, asked Moberly to relocate his crews north to the Yellowhead Pass for the 1872 season. Moberly was very frustrated with these orders requiring him to abandon his preferred route.

After the 1873 survey season, Moberly left the Canadian Pacific Survey and moved to Manitoba. He continued to do private survey work there.

Moberly was very bitter towards Major A.B. Rogers, who was credited with discovering the Rogers Pass through the Selkirk Mountains in 1881. Moberly argued that while discovering Eagle Pass, he had explored the Illecillewaet River and that his journals aided Rogers in his exploration of the pass.

In 1898, Moberly would return to British Columbia and stayed in Vancouver to retire. He would die there in 1915. 

==Honors==
Because of his early explorations and visionary — some say wishful — ideas on the route of the Canadian Pacific Railway, he has a prominent spot in Canadian Pacific Railway lore. Placement of the last spike of the Canadian Pacific Railway took place in Eagle Pass at Craigellachie, British Columbia.

Moberly Lake in northern British Columbia is named for Walter&#x27;s younger brother Henry John Moberly, a fur trader who lived on that lake. The railway station bearing the name Moberly on CPKC Mountain subdivision at mile 40.3 is named after him.

==Writing==
He published several books including his autobiographic book, &quot;The Rocks and Rivers of British Columbia&quot; (H. Blacklock &amp; Co, London, 1885).

<doc id="874623" wikidata="Q1189611" url="?curid=874623" title="Singlestick">
<text>Singlestick is a martial art that uses a wooden stick as its weapon. It began as a way of training soldiers in the use of backswords (such as the sabre or the cutlass). Canne de combat, a French form of stick fighting, is similar to singlestick play, which also includes a self-defense variant with a walking stick.

==Weapon==
The singlestick itself is a slender, round wooden rod, traditionally of ash, with a basket hilt. Singlesticks are typically around in length, and in diameter, and thicker at one end than the other, used as a weapon of attack and defence, the thicker end being thrust through a cup-shaped hilt of basket-work to protect the hand. It bears approximately the same relationship to the backsword as the foil to the small sword in being a sporting version of the weapon for safe practice.

The original form of the singlestick was the waster, which appeared in the 16th century and was merely a wooden sword used in practice for the backsword, and of the same general shape. By the first quarter of the 17th century wasters had become simple clubs known as cudgels with the addition of a sword guard. When the basket hilt came into general use about twenty five years later, a wicker one was added to the singlestick, replacing the heavy metal hilt of the backsword. The guards, cuts and parries in singlestick play were at first identical with those of backsword play, no thrusts being allowed.

==History and technique==

In 16th-century England, hits below the girdle were considered unfair. In the 18th century, all parts of the person became valid targets. By the turn of the 19th century, the target area had been restricted to the upper body (with the exception of the back of the head) and the upper part of the forward leg. These rules are in use today by the Association for Historical Fencing. Historically, the target area has varied, with bouts sometimes only being decided by the drawing of blood from the head of one of the contestants, in the manner of the Mensur.

Under Kings George I and George II, backsword play with sticks was immensely popular under the names cudgel-play and singlesticking, not only in the cities but in the countryside as well, wrestling being its only rival. Towards the end of the 18th century the play became very restricted. The players were placed near together, the feet remaining immovable and all strokes being delivered with a whip-like action of the wrist from a high hanging guard, the hand being held above the head. Blows on any part of the body above the waist were allowed, but all except those aimed at the head were employed only to gain openings, as each bout was decided only by a broken head, i.e. a cut on the head that drew blood. At first the left hand and arm were used to ward off blows not parried with the stick, but near the close of the 18th century the left hand grasped a scarf tied loosely round the left thigh, the elbow being raised to protect the face. Thomas Hughes&#x27;s story &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; contains a spirited description of cudgel-play during the first half of the 19th century. This kind of single-sticking practically died out during the third quarter of that century, but was revived as weapon training for the sabre within some military and civilian academies, the play being essentially the same as for that weapon. The point was introduced and leg hits were allowed.

American President Theodore Roosevelt and his friend General Leonard Wood were said to be fond of this sport and that they used to emerge from a contest quite bruised from their rounds. In &quot;Letters to his Children&quot;, Theodore Roosevelt writes in a letter dated December 26, 1902, &quot;Late in the afternoon I played at single stick with General Wood and Mr. [Bob] Ferguson...We have to try to hit as light as possible, but sometimes we hit hard, and today I have a bump over one eye and a swollen wrist.&quot; However the use of the term in this context may be more colloquial than technical. It is very unlikely that Theodore Roosevelt or General Wood ever practiced the British sport of Singlestick; more likely, Roosevelt&#x27;s use of the term refers to the French art of canne de combat. Indeed, their own fencing instructor Maître François Darrieulat was a veteran of the French Army, where singlestick was unknown but cane was mandatory for officers, and many other facts tend to point out that situation.

Singlestick was an event at the 1904 Summer Olympics, but the sport was already in decline. Again recent investigation found that most likely singlestick was not present at the 1904 Olympics, but rather a form of cane fighting. Singlestick was very seldom taught in late 19th century United States until it was introduced for a short while in Annapolis, and most of the competitors came from academies where singlestick was unknown but French cane was taught. The use of the term &quot;singlestick&quot; in contemporary newspapers explains the confusion as it was an umbrella term at the time to refer to combat sports and games using a stick such as singlestick, cane, quarterstaff or even kendo. With the introduction of the light Italian fencing sabre in the early 20th century, singlestick play became unnecessary and was subsequently neglected. In the UK, Singlestick competition ceased in the Services in the 1950s, although the skills continue to be passed down from one generation of fencing Professor to the next. The singlestick of the British Armed Services of the Great War period was passed to Scotland&#x27;s National Fencing Coach in the mid-1960s, and thence passed on to the founders of many HEMA groups in the UK. Stickplay with wooden swords as a school for the cutlass remained common in some navies.

The art, occasionally practised by a few fencing veterans in the United Kingdom, was revived by the Royal Navy in the 1980s. Within today&#x27;s martial arts community, a growing interest in traditional Western martial arts has revived interest in this particular form of weapon training.

== Media ==
In the television series &quot;Elementary&quot;, based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories, but updated to the 21st Century and relocated mostly to New York, Sherlock (played by Jonny Lee Miller) frequently practices singlestick.

<doc id="874626" wikidata="Q1531522" url="?curid=874626" title="Glitter">
<text>Glitter is an assortment of flat, small, reflective particles that are precision cut and come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. Glitter particles reflect confetti, sparkles and sequins, but somewhat smaller. 

Since prehistoric times, glitter has been made from many different materials including stones such as malachite, and mica, as well as insects and glass. Uses for glitter include clothing, arts, crafts, cosmetics and body paint. Modern glitter is usually manufactured from the combination of aluminum and plastic, which is rarely recycled and can find its way into aquatic habitats, eventually becoming ingested by animals, leading some scientists to call for bans on plastic glitter.

==Antiquity==

Glittering surfaces have been found to be used since prehistoric times in the arts and in cosmetics. The modern English word &quot;glitter&quot; comes from the Middle English word &quot;gliteren&quot;, possibly by way of the Old Norse word &quot;.&quot; However, as early as 30,000 years ago, mica flakes were used to give cave paintings a glittering appearance. Prehistoric humans are believed to have used cosmetics, made of powdered hematite, a sparkling mineral.

The Ancient Egyptians produced &quot;glitter-like substances from crushed beetles&quot; as well as finely ground green malachite crystal. Researchers believe Mayan temples were sometimes painted with red, green, and grey glitter paint made from mica dust, based on infrared scans of the remnants of paint still found on the structures in present-day Guatemala.

People of the Americas 8,000 years ago were using powdered galena, a form of lead, to produce a bright greyish-white glittering paint used for objects of adornment. The collecting and surface mining of galena was prevalent in the Upper Mississippi Valley region by the Cahokia native peoples, for regional trade both raw and crafted into beads or other objects.

==Modern glitter==
===Development===
The first production of modern plastic glitter is credited to the American machinist Henry F. Ruschmann who invented a machine to cut photo films and paper in the 1930s. Sometimes, the machine &quot;stuttered,&quot; generating small pieces of glossy cellulose that employees picked up and used as &quot;snow&quot; to decorate their Christmas trees, and modern glitter was born. With his partner, Harry Goetz, Ruschmann cut mica into washers and glitter from metallized cellulose acetate film. During World War II, glass glitter became unavailable so Ruschmann found a market for scrap plastics, which were ground into glitter. In 1943, he purchased Meadowbrook Farm in Bernardsville, New Jersey where he founded Meadowbrook Farm Inventions (MFI) in 1948 to produce industrial glitter. MFI became Meadowbrook Inventions, Inc. in 1953. Ruschmann filed a patent for a mechanism for cross-cutting films as well as other glitter-related inventions. Substrates for cutting glitter expanded from metalized cellulose and aluminum foil to metalized and iridescent film, polyester, PVC, and laminations cut into various shapes.

===Production===
Today over 20,000 varieties of glitter are manufactured in a vast number of different colors, sizes, and materials. One estimate suggests of glitter was either purchased or produced between the years of 1989 and 2009, however the source provides no evidence or reference point. Commercial glitter ranges in size from a side. First, flat multi-layered sheets are produced combining plastic, coloring, and reflective material such as aluminium, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, and bismuth oxychloride. These sheets are then cut into tiny particles of many shapes including squares, triangles, rectangles, and hexagons.

===Use===
Prior to fabrics made with modern glitter, sequins were sewn or woven on to fabric to give it a glittering appearance. Edible glitter made from gum arabic and other ingredients is even used by culinary artists.

Glitter is used in cosmetics to make the face and nails shiny or sparkly. After the Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015, the use of microbeads in toothpaste and other &quot;rinse-off&quot; cosmetics has been discontinued in the US; since 2015 the industry has shifted toward using FDA-approved &quot;rinse-off&quot; metallized-plastic glitter as their primary abrasive agent instead.

Glitter is commonly used in arts and crafts to color, accessorise and texture items. The small, brightly colored particles often stick to clothing, skin, and furniture, and can be difficult to remove. It is also used in optically variable inks. 

Glitter coatings or finishes are frequently used on fishing lures to draw attention by simulating the scales of prey fish.

Due to its unique characteristics, glitter has also proven to be useful forensic evidence. Because of the tens of thousands of different commercial glitters, identical glitter particles can be compelling evidence that a suspect has been at a crime scene. Forensic scientist Edwin Jones has one of the largest collections of glitter, consisting of over 1,000 different samples used in comparison of samples taken from crime scenes. Glitter particles are easily transferred through the air or by touch, yet cling to bodies and clothing, often unnoticed by suspects.

== Glitter in culture ==

Glitter can be seen as a tool of fashion used by various subcultures, as it allows for a visible statement to be worn and seen on the body. This is because it has been theorized to be a &quot;flickering signifier&quot;, or something that destabilizes known notions of popular culture, identity, and society. Glitter is associated with &quot;fringe cultures&quot;, which often use excessive glitz and glamor (such as glitter) to evoke a deeper understanding between the relationships of commercialized popular culture and &quot;high&quot; culture, or &quot;high-brow&quot; art.

Used by glam rockers, such as David Bowie, Gary Glitter and Iggy Pop, glitter is also used as a tool to help blur gender lines. This helped to create the more extreme &quot;glitter rock&quot; – an even more heightened version of glam rock.

Glitter is also used by nail artists and make-up artists to make statements about femininity and beauty standards. The flashy, sparkling nature of glitter allows users to push standard ideas of beauty and what is and is not considered &quot;excessive&quot; in terms of make-up. Glitter is usually associated with nightlife and not professionalism, but wearing it in different settings can push these boundaries.

Because of its tendency to shed off items it is applied to and stick onto unwanted surfaces, including skin, hair, and clothes, glitter is also used for glitter bombing, which is an act of protest in which activists throw glitter on people at public events. Glitter bombers have frequently been motivated by, though not limited to, their targets&#x27; opposition to same-sex marriage. Some legal officials argue glitter bombing is technically assault and battery. It is possible for glitter to enter the eyes or nose and cause damage to the cornea or other soft tissues potentially irritating them or leading to infection, depending on the size of the glitter. Whether a prosecutor would pursue the charges depends on a number of factors.

==Environmental impact==
Trisia Farrelly, an environmental anthropologist at Massey University, has called for a ban on glitter made of polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) and aluminum, as it is a microplastic that can leach hormonal disruptors into the environment. Furthermore, plastic glitter takes about one thousand years to biodegrade, according to Victoria Miller, a materials and engineering scientist at North Carolina State University. When dozens of British music festivals pledged to ban single-use plastics by 2021, the proposed ban included plastic glitter.

Biodegradable glitter made from eucalyptus tree extract is metaled with aluminium and can be coloured. It is &quot;40% softer and more delicate on the skin than conventional glitter,&quot; and it decomposes in soil or water. Cellulose glitter is also available.

According to Chris Flower, director-general of the Cosmetic Toiletry and Perfumery Association, &quot;the total contribution to marine plastic litter from glittery cosmetic products is negligible when compared to the damaging effects of bags and bottles... [While the] total effect of giving up traditional glitter might not be great in comparison with other harmful plastics, we should still do everything we can.&quot;

Since October 2023, some types of glitter have been restricted in the European Union as part of a ban on microplastics intentionally added to products.

<doc id="874634" wikidata="Q15206109" url="?curid=874634" title="Statute of Westminster 1275">
<text>The Statute of Westminster of 1275 (3 Edw. 1), also known as the Statute of Westminster I, codified the existing law in England, into 51 chapters. Chapter 5 (which mandates free elections) is still in force in the United Kingdom and the Australian state of Victoria whilst part of Chapter 1 remains in force in New Zealand. It was repealed in Ireland in 1983.

William Stubbs gives a summary of the Statute:
Though it is a matter of dispute when &#x27; ([[Law French]] for &quot;hard and forceful punishment&quot;) was first introduced, chapter 3 states that those felons standing mute shall be put in&#x27;.

==History==
The Statute of Westminster of 1275 was one of two English statutes largely drafted by Robert Burnell and passed during the reign of Edward I. Edward I had returned from the Ninth Crusade on 2 August 1274 and was crowned King of England on 19 August. His first Parliament was summoned for the of the Purification on 16 February 1275 but was prorogued until the day after Easter on 22 April 1275, but did not meet until the week commencing 29 April or, according to Chronicle records, until the beginning of May, for unknown reasons. It met at Westminster, its main work being the consideration of the Statute of Westminster I, the agreement of new levies in Ireland and allowing the King to levy a new tax on wool. This was drawn up, not in Latin, but in Norman French, and was passed &quot;by the assent of Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, and [all] the Commonalty of the Realm, being thither summoned.&quot;

According to Yuen Yuen Ang, the statute had replaced a previously communal regime of enforcing agreements with one based on &quot;individual responsibility, territorial law, the central administration of justice, and personal collateral.&quot;

==Chapters==
The Statute of Westminster I is composed of 51 chapters:

==Ireland==
In the early history of the Lordship of Ireland, English statutes were often applied to Ireland. A 1285 writ authorised Stephen de Fulbourn, then Justiciar of Ireland, to apply there English statutes including Westminster I, Westminster II, Gloucester, and those of merchants. A 1320 act of the Parliament of Ireland (13 Edw. 2 c.2) readopted all these statutes. An act of Edward Poynings&#x27; 1495 session of the Parliament of Ireland adopted statutes &quot;formerly made for the common weal&quot; in England; later the Maintenance and Embracery Act 1634 adopted all English statutes dealing with champerty and maintenance and embracery. Many chapters of the 1275 English statute were repealed with respect to Ireland by the Statute Law (Ireland) Revision Act 1872 (35 &amp; 36 Vict. c. 98). In the Republic of Ireland, the Short Titles Act 1962 assigned the short title &quot;Distress Act 1275&quot; to chapter 16 of the 1275 English statute, as adopted under the 1495 Irish act; and the short title &quot;Maintenance and Champerty Act 1275&quot; to chapters 25 and 28 of the 1275 English statute, as adopted under the 1634 Irish act. The Statute Law Revision Act 1983 repealed the whole of the 1275 English statute and the 1285 and 1320 Irish statutes.

<doc id="874641" wikidata="Q7314231" url="?curid=874641" title="Representation theory of the symmetric group">
<text>In mathematics, the representation theory of the symmetric group is a particular case of the representation theory of finite groups, for which a concrete and detailed theory can be obtained. This has a large area of potential applications, from symmetric function theory to quantum chemistry studies of atoms, molecules and solids.

The symmetric group S&quot;n&quot; has order &quot;n&quot;!. Its conjugacy classes are labeled by partitions of &quot;n&quot;. Therefore according to the representation theory of a finite group, the number of inequivalent irreducible representations, over the complex numbers, is equal to the number of partitions of &quot;n&quot;. Unlike the general situation for finite groups, there is in fact a natural way to parametrize irreducible representations by the same set that parametrizes conjugacy classes, namely by partitions of &quot;n&quot; or equivalently Young diagrams of size &quot;n&quot;.

Each such irreducible representation can in fact be realized over the integers (every permutation acting by a matrix with integer coefficients); it can be explicitly constructed by computing the Young symmetrizers acting on a space generated by the Young tableaux of shape given by the Young diagram. The dimension formula_1 of the representation that corresponds to the Young diagram formula_2 is given by the hook length formula.

To each irreducible representation ρ we can associate an irreducible character, χρ.
To compute χρ(π) where π is a permutation, one can use the combinatorial Murnaghan–Nakayama rule
. Note that χρ is constant on conjugacy classes,
that is, χρ(π) = χρ(σ−1πσ) for all permutations σ.

Over other fields the situation can become much more complicated. If the field &quot;K&quot; has characteristic equal to zero or greater than &quot;n&quot; then by Maschke&#x27;s theorem the group algebra &quot;K&quot;S&quot;n&quot; is semisimple. In these cases the irreducible representations defined over the integers give the complete set of irreducible representations (after reduction modulo the characteristic if necessary).

However, the irreducible representations of the symmetric group are not known in arbitrary characteristic. In this context it is more usual to use the language of modules rather than representations. The representation obtained from an irreducible representation defined over the integers by reducing modulo the characteristic will not in general be irreducible. The modules so constructed are called &quot;Specht modules&quot;, and every irreducible does arise inside some such module. There are now fewer irreducibles, and although they can be classified they are very poorly understood. For example, even their dimensions are not known in general.

The determination of the irreducible modules for the symmetric group over an arbitrary field is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in representation theory.

== Low-dimensional representations ==
=== Symmetric groups ===
The lowest-dimensional representations of the symmetric groups can be described explicitly, and over arbitrary fields. The smallest two degrees in characteristic zero are described here:

Every symmetric group has a one-dimensional representation called the trivial representation, where every element acts as the one by one identity matrix. For , there is another irreducible representation of degree 1, called the sign representation or alternating character, which takes a permutation to the one by one matrix with entry ±1 based on the sign of the permutation. These are the only one-dimensional representations of the symmetric groups, as one-dimensional representations are abelian, and the abelianization of the symmetric group is C2, the cyclic group of order 2.

For all &quot;n&quot;, there is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional representation of the symmetric group of order &quot;n!&quot;, called the , which consists of permuting &quot;n&quot; coordinates. This has the trivial subrepresentation consisting of vectors whose coordinates are all equal. The orthogonal complement consists of those vectors whose coordinates sum to zero, and when , the representation on this subspace is an -dimensional irreducible representation, called the standard representation. Another -dimensional irreducible representation is found by tensoring with the sign representation. An exterior power formula_3 of the standard representation formula_4 is irreducible provided formula_5 .

For , these are the lowest-dimensional irreducible representations of S&quot;n&quot; – all other irreducible representations have dimension at least &quot;n&quot;. However for , the surjection from S4 to S3 allows S4 to inherit a two-dimensional irreducible representation. For , the exceptional transitive embedding of S5 into S6 produces another pair of five-dimensional irreducible representations.

=== Alternating groups ===

The representation theory of the alternating groups is similar, though the sign representation disappears. For , the lowest-dimensional irreducible representations are the trivial representation in dimension one, and the -dimensional representation from the other summand of the permutation representation, with all other irreducible representations having higher dimension, but there are exceptions for smaller &quot;n&quot;.

The alternating groups for have only one one-dimensional irreducible representation, the trivial representation. For there are two additional one-dimensional irreducible representations, corresponding to maps to the cyclic group of order 3: and .

* For , there is just one irreducible representation of degree , and this is the smallest degree of a non-trivial irreducible representation.
* For the obvious analogue of the -dimensional representation is reducible – the permutation representation coincides with the regular representation, and thus breaks up into the three one-dimensional representations, as is abelian; see the discrete Fourier transform for representation theory of cyclic groups.
* For , there is just one irreducible representation, but there are the exceptional irreducible representations of dimension 1.
* For , there are two dual irreducible representations of dimension 3, corresponding to its action as icosahedral symmetry.
* For , there is an extra irreducible representation of dimension 5 corresponding to the exceptional transitive embedding of &quot;A&quot;5 in &quot;A&quot;6.

==Tensor products of representations==

===Kronecker coefficients===

The tensor product of two representations of formula_6 corresponding to the Young diagrams formula_7 is a combination of irreducible representations of formula_6,
:formula_9
The coefficients formula_10 are called the Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group.
They can be computed from the characters of the representations :
:formula_11
The sum is over partitions formula_12 of formula_13, with formula_14 the corresponding conjugacy classes. The values of the characters formula_15 can be computed using the Frobenius formula. The coefficients formula_16 are
:formula_17
where formula_18 is the number of times formula_19 appears in formula_12, so that formula_21.

A few examples, written in terms of Young diagrams :
:formula_22
:formula_23
:formula_24
:formula_25
There is a simple rule for computing formula_26 for any Young diagram formula_2 : the result is the sum of all Young diagrams that are obtained from formula_2 by removing one box and then adding one box, where the coefficients are one except for formula_2 itself, whose coefficient is formula_30, i.e., the number of different row lengths minus one.

A constraint on the irreducible constituents of formula_31 is 
:formula_32
where the depth formula_33 of a Young diagram is the number of boxes that do not belong to the first row.

===Reduced Kronecker coefficients===
For formula_2 a Young diagram and formula_35, formula_36 is a Young diagram of size formula_13. Then formula_38 is a bounded, non-decreasing function of formula_13, and 
:formula_40
is called a reduced Kronecker coefficient or stable Kronecker coefficient. There are known bounds on the value of formula_13 where formula_38 reaches its limit. The reduced Kronecker coefficients are structure constants of Deligne categories of representations of formula_6 with formula_44.

In contrast to Kronecker coefficients, reduced Kronecker coefficients are defined for any triple of Young diagrams, not necessarily of the same size. If formula_45, then formula_46 coincides with the Littlewood-Richardson coefficient formula_47. Reduced Kronecker coefficients can be written as linear combinations of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients via a change of bases in the space of symmetric functions, giving rise to expressions that are manifestly integral although not manifestly positive. Reduced Kronecker coefficients can also be written in terms of Kronecker and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients formula_48 via Littlewood&#x27;s formula
:formula_49
Conversely, it is possible to recover the Kronecker coefficients as linear combinations of reduced Kronecker coefficients.

Reduced Kronecker coefficients are implemented in the computer algebra system SageMath.

==Eigenvalues of complex representations==

Given an element formula_50 of cycle-type formula_51 and order formula_52, the eigenvalues of formula_53 in a complex representation of formula_6 are of the type formula_55 with formula_56, where the integers formula_57 are called the cyclic exponents of formula_53 with respect to the representation.

There is a combinatorial description of the cyclic exponents of the symmetric group (and wreath products thereof). Defining formula_59, let the formula_60-index of a standard Young tableau be the sum of the values of formula_61 over the tableau&#x27;s descents, formula_62.
Then the cyclic exponents of the representation of formula_6 described by the Young diagram formula_2 are the formula_60-indices of the corresponding Young tableaux.

In particular, if formula_66 is of order formula_13, then formula_68, and formula_69 coincides with the major index of formula_70 (the sum of the descents). The cyclic exponents of an irreducible representation of formula_6 then describe how it decomposes into representations of the cyclic group formula_72, with formula_55 being interpreted as the image of formula_53 in the (one-dimensional) representation characterized by formula_75.

<doc id="874649" wikidata="Q1636619" url="?curid=874649" title="Liahona (Book of Mormon)">
<text>In the Book of Mormon, the Liahona () is described as a brass ball with two spindles, one of which directs where Lehi and his companions should travel after they leave Jerusalem at the beginning of the narrative. Some early participants in the Latter Day Saint movement claimed to have seen the Liahona. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its members have used the Liahona as a namesake, such as in the name of the magazine the &quot;Liahona&quot; and in the idea of &quot;Liahona Mormons&quot;.

== Background ==
The Book of Mormon, published in 1830, is one of the primary religious texts of Mormonism, also known as the Latter Day Saint movement. Founder Joseph Smith said that an angel of the Christian God directed him to uncover metal plates inscribed with the history of an ancient American people and that by miraculous means he translated the writing on these plates, producing the Book of Mormon. Most in the Latter Day Saint movement regard the Book of Mormon as being genuinely ancient and historical.

==Depiction==

In the Book of Mormon, a man named Lehi and his family live in Jerusalem prior to the Babylonian captivity. God communicates with Lehi and directs him to lead his family away from Jerusalem. While they camp in the wilderness, the Liahona is found one morning at Lehi&#x27;s tent door. It is not named as the Liahona at this point. It is described as a &quot;brass ball&quot; of &quot;curious workmanship&quot; with &quot;two spindles&quot;, one of which indicate the direction that his party should travel (). On occasion writing appeared on the ball that displayed additional instructions from God (). Using the Liahona, Lehi and his party travel through a wilderness and across an ocean. The Liahona works &quot;according to the faith and diligence&quot; () with which they heed its direction, and ceases functioning at times when the members of the party demonstrate a loss of faith in God&#x27;s commandments, notably when Nephi&#x27;s brothers rebelled against Lehi during their ocean crossing ().

In the Book of Alma, Alma identifies the object as &quot;Liahona&quot; when speaking to his son Helaman, saying, &quot;our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass&quot; ().

== Cultural reception ==
Joseph Smith and three associates—Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, known as the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon—said that God promised to show them the Liahona and did show it to them in what they believed was a miraculous vision. This claimed promise is included in the Doctrine and Covenants, a Mormon religious text that compiles documents that adherents believe to be divine revelations. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement, named one of its magazines, the &quot;Liahona&quot;, after the object, referencing its purpose of directing people. A 1967 essay categorized approaches to Latter-day Saints worship as being either like the Iron Rod (another object from the Book of Mormon)—rigid and unambiguous—or like the Liahona, flexible and based on experiencing what Latter-day Saints believe to be revelation. This has been called the &quot;Iron Rod–Liahona scales&quot;. The concept of &quot;Liahona Mormons&quot; circulated among Latter-day Saints, and it was acknowledged in the denomination&#x27;s General Conference.

<text>Garrett Brown (born April 6, 1942) is an American inventor, best known as the creator of the Steadicam. Brown&#x27;s invention allows camera operators to film while walking without the normal shaking and jostles of a handheld camera. The Steadicam was first used in the Hal Ashby film &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; (1976), receiving an Academy Award (Best Cinematography), and since used on such films as &quot;Rocky&quot;, filming Rocky&#x27;s running and training sequences, and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, where Brown walked through a Redwood forest with the Steadicam shooting film at 1 frame per second to achieve the illusion of high speed motion during the speeder-bike chase.

The sequence in &quot;Rocky&quot; that took the audience up what would later be known as the Rocky Steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art for the triumphant moment at the top was first filmed during tests for the original Steadicam system.
The system was used extensively on Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1980 classic horror film &quot;The Shining&quot;, starring Jack Nicholson. Brown&#x27;s Steadicam work can be seen in over seventy motion pictures.

Brown has also invented the DiveCam (following olympic divers), MobyCam (underwater camera following olympic swimmers) and the SkyCam (for football games) with the latter perfected with help from a team including Anastas Michos, Larry McConkey, John Jurgens and others. 

Garrett Brown is the father of TV Director Jonathan Brown. Both worked together as Steadicam operators on the film &quot;Bulworth&quot;, directed by and starring Warren Beatty. A member of the American Society of Cinematographers and the Directors Guild of America, Garrett Brown was recipient of an Oscar for Scientific or Technical Achievement from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and an Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for his invention of the Steadicam.

==Early years==

After his graduation from Haverford High School, he matriculated at Tufts University, where he met Al Dana. Together, they formed the folk duo Brown &amp; Dana, and recorded the classic &quot;It Was a Very Good Year&quot;, among others.
Brown also attained a cult following for his radio advertisements with Anne Winn, especially for Molson Golden beer. Their witty repartee became a template for others.

==Inventions==
Garrett Brown has invented multiple camera supports focusing mostly on camera stabilization.

* Equipois: A mechanical arm for heavy equipment.
* FlyCam: A closed loop, stabilized tracking camera system.
* DiveCam: The first dropping vertical camera system.
* GoCam: The ultra-light high speed camera tracking system.
* MobyCam: The first submarine tracking camera system.

<text>Henry Bennion Eyring (born May 31, 1933) is an American educational administrator, author, and religious leader. Eyring has been the second counselor to Russell M. Nelson in the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) since January 14, 2018. Previously, Eyring was the first counselor to Thomas S. Monson in the First Presidency from 2008 until Monson&#x27;s death on January 2, 2018. Eyring was the second counselor to Gordon B. Hinckley in the First Presidency from October 6, 2007, until Hinckley&#x27;s death on January 27, 2008.

While he has been a general authority of the church, Eyring has also served in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the First Quorum of the Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric. Eyring has served twice as commissioner of the Church Educational System. Currently, he is the fourth most senior apostle among the ranks of the church.

==Early life==
Eyring was born in Princeton, New Jersey, the second child of Henry Eyring, then a professor at Princeton and later the dean of the graduate school at the University of Utah and president of the American Chemical Society, and his wife, Mildred Bennion. His father&#x27;s sister, Camilla Eyring, married Spencer W. Kimball, making Henry B. the nephew of Kimball, who was the twelfth president of the LDS Church.

He lived in Princeton until his early teenage years. Until the start of World War II they attended LDS meetings at the branch in New Brunswick, New Jersey, but with the gasoline rationing of the war, they received permission to hold meetings in their home, which often had only the Eyring family. As a teenager, Eyring and his family moved to Salt Lake City, where his father took a post at the University of Utah.

==Military service and education==
Eyring spent two years in the U.S. Air Force, stationed at Sandia Base in New Mexico. In New Mexico, Eyring served as a district missionary for the LDS Church. Eyring had been in the ROTC at the University of Utah. While in the Air Force, he served as a liaison between military officers and scientists. His main responsibility was to analyze data from weapons tests of nuclear weapons. At the end of the assignment, he gave a report and ended up meeting in person with a collection of several leading generals.

He had previously received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics from the University of Utah. He went on to earn both master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in business administration from the Harvard Business School, before embarking on a career in academia. Over the summer after his first year at Harvard, Eyring did an internship with Arthur D. Little as a consultant for Abitibi Power and Paper Company. He did an analysis to study how to improve the process of river logging. His suggestion was to abandon river logging and turn to truck transport of logs, but a combination of not studying the issue deeply enough and having a CEO of the company who had risen through the ranks from being a river logger prevented Eyring&#x27;s suggestions from being adopted then.

While studying at Harvard, Eyring was heavily influenced by Georges Doriot, who offered Eyring a chance to work with him and Ken Olsen, the founder of Digital Equipment Company. Eyring chose instead to pursue a doctorate in business.

==Academic and business career==
In the fall of 1962, Eyring began work as a professor at Stanford University. He finished his doctorate in business in the summer of 1963. That summer, Eyring completed a fellowship with the RAND Corporation. Eyring had married his wife, Kathleen, the summer before he started at Stanford, and they spent their first year of married life moving through various homes his real estate developer father-in-law was in the process of refurbishing. They then spent the next ten years living in the guest house of his in-laws&#x27; property.

Among Eyring&#x27;s associates at Stanford were Roger Sant and Ed Zschau. Eyring worked with Zschau in the founding of the computer company System Industries.

Eyring was an associate professor of business at the Stanford Graduate School of Business from 1962 to 1971. He was also a Sloan Visiting Faculty Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At MIT, he took multiple courses in human behavior, including courses from Douglas McGregor, who died of a heart attack while Eyring was at MIT, and also Ed Schein and Warren Bennis.

Eyring has served twice as commissioner of church education, from September 1980 to April 1985, and from September 1992 to January 2005, when he was replaced by W. Rolfe Kerr.

==LDS Church service==

Among other callings in the LDS Church, Eyring has served as a regional representative, bishop and member of the Sunday School General Board. Eyring served as an early-morning seminary teacher early in his time as a professor at Stanford University, and as bishop of the Stanford singles ward later on.

Eyring served as president of Ricks College from 1971 to 1977, as a counselor to Presiding Bishop Robert D. Hales from 1985 to 1992, and as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy, from 1992 to 1995.

Following the death of church president Howard W. Hunter, Eyring was sustained as a member of the church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on April 1, 1995 and ordained an apostle later that week.

Eyring was sustained as second counselor in the church&#x27;s First Presidency on October 6, 2007, filling the vacancy left by the death of James E. Faust, on August 10, 2007. When the First Presidency was reorganized following the death of Gordon B. Hinckley, Eyring was called and set apart as the first counselor on February 3, 2008. The new First Presidency, with Monson as president, was announced on February 4, 2008.

As a member of the First Presidency, Eyring has dedicated the San Salvador El Salvador, Gilbert Arizona, Payson Utah, Indianapolis Indiana, and Philadelphia Pennsylvania Temples where he had also presided at the groundbreaking in 2011 as well as rededicating the Buenos Aires Argentina and Mexico City Mexico Temples.

In 2014, after a meeting with Pope Francis, Eyring spoke at Humanum, &quot;an International Interreligious Colloquium on The Complementarity of Man and Woman,&quot; held in Vatican City. It was the first time that a pope and a top LDS general authority ever met.

==Family==
Eyring and his wife, Kathleen Johnson, met at a YSA meeting held at Rindge, New Hampshire at the Cathedral of the Pines in the spring of 1960. They became further acquainted at a meeting at the LDS Longfellow Park Chapel in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the next summer. Johnson was a native of Palo Alto and was a student at Stanford University. She had previously studied summers at the University of Vienna and University of Paris and was studying at Harvard University the summer she met Eyring. Wilbur Cox, the LDS Church&#x27;s district president (to whom Eyring was serving as a counselor), made accommodations to facilitate Eyring&#x27;s dating Johnson. After an intense courtship that first summer, Eyring and Johnson continued courting with her making multiple cross-country airplane trips until they were engaged early in 1961. They were married in the LDS Church&#x27;s Logan Temple on July 27, 1962, with the ceremony performed by his uncle, Spencer W. Kimball. The couple were married for 61 years until Kathleen&#x27;s death on October 15, 2023, at the age of 82.

They are the parents of six children (four sons and two daughters). Their sons include Henry J. Eyring, past president of BYU–Idaho (2017 to 2023); and Matthew J. Eyring, the chief strategy innovation officer of Vivint, a home automation company in North America. Eyring is a first cousin once-removed of former Michigan governor George W. Romney; his paternal grandmother was Romney&#x27;s aunt.

She graduated from Brookline High School in 1954 and attended Pennsylvania State University. She dropped out of college in 1956 and married John Chaffetz in 1957. They had one son, John. After four years and several moves the marriage ended in divorce, and she returned to Cambridge. Her former husband later remarried and had a son, Jason Chaffetz, who was a Republican Congressman from Utah. Kitty received her B.A. from Lesley College in 1963, the same year she married Michael Dukakis. She received a M.A. degree from Boston University College of Communication in 1982.
During the 1988 presidential election, several false rumors were reported in the media about the Dukakises, including the claim by Idaho Republican Senator Steve Symms that Kitty had burned an American flag to protest the Vietnam War. Republican strategist Lee Atwater was accused of having initiated these rumors.

In 1989, Dukakis was briefly hospitalized after drinking rubbing alcohol. In 1991, Dukakis published her memoir, &quot;Now You Know&quot;, in which she candidly discussed her ongoing battle with alcoholism. The book also discussed the pressures of being a political wife and her disappointment over her husband&#x27;s defeat in the 1988 election. In the mid-1990s, Dukakis graduated from the Boston University School of Social Work with a master&#x27;s degree in social work, successfully performing her practicum at Charles River Hospital in Wellesley, Massachusetts. In 2006, her book &quot;Shock&quot; revealed that she had undergone electroconvulsive therapy treatment beginning in 2001 in order to treat major depression. Dukakis is a leading proponent of using ECT to treat depression.

In 2007, the Lemuel Shattuck Hospital in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, opened a center for addiction treatment named after Dukakis.

Dukakis appears in the 2008 documentary on Lee Atwater, &quot;Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story&quot;.

<doc id="874661" wikidata="Q3176723" url="?curid=874661" title="Jeffrey R. Holland">
<text>Jeffrey Roy Holland (born December 3, 1940) is an American educator and religious leader. He served as the ninth president of Brigham Young University (BYU) and is the acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, Holland is accepted by the church as a prophet, seer, and revelator. Currently, he is the third most senior apostle in the church.

Holland was born and raised in St. George, Utah. After graduating from high school, his college education began at Dixie College and he also served as a missionary for the LDS Church in Great Britain. After returning from his mission, he transferred to BYU and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English. He later earned a master&#x27;s degree in religious education at BYU. Holland received a second master&#x27;s degree and later a PhD in American studies at Yale University. In 1974, Holland was appointed BYU&#x27;s dean of religious education, then two years later he was appointed as the eleventh commissioner of the Church Educational System (CES), replacing Neal A. Maxwell. In 1980, Holland became BYU&#x27;s ninth president, replacing Dallin H. Oaks.

==Early life and education==
Holland was born in St. George, Utah. His father, Frank D. Holland, was a convert to the LDS Church while his mother, Alice, came from a long line of Latter-day Saints. As a youth, he worked as a newspaper carrier, a grocery bagger, and a service station attendant. As a young man, Holland served in what was then known as the British Mission. His mission president was Marion D. Hanks, a church general authority. He and Quentin L. Cook were missionary companions.

Holland graduated from Dixie High School in 1959. He helped the Flyers capture state high school championships in football and basketball. He began his college education at Dixie College before his mission. After returning from his mission, he served as co-captain of the Dixie basketball team. In 2011, the school broke ground for the Jeffrey R. Holland Centennial Commons Building, a building to honor both Holland and the school&#x27;s 2011 centennial. The completed building was dedicated in September 2012.

Holland transferred to BYU, where he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English. He did graduate study in religious education, receiving a Master of Arts (M.A.) degree in 1966 with a thesis on selected changes to the text of the Book of Mormon, while also teaching religion classes part-time. After earning his master&#x27;s degree, Holland became an Institute of Religion teacher in Hayward, California. He later worked as an institute director in Seattle, Washington. Holland then studied American studies at Yale University, where he received a second M.A. and a PhD in 1972. At Yale, Holland studied with American literary scholar and critic R. W. B. Lewis and authored a dissertation on the religious sense of Mark Twain. He was an instructor at the LDS Church&#x27;s institute in Hartford while he was a student at Yale.

While studying at Yale, Holland served as a counselor in the presidency of the LDS Church&#x27;s Hartford Connecticut Stake.

==Leadership at BYU and CES==
Holland served as an institute director in Salt Lake City after earning his PhD. He also served as director of the Melchizedek Priesthood MIA and as chair of the Young Adult Committee for the LDS Church. In 1974, at age 33, Holland was appointed Dean of Religious Education at BYU. As dean, Holland founded BYU’s Religious Studies Center and became its first director. From 1976 to 1980, he served as the eleventh commissioner of CES, replacing Neal A. Maxwell, who was called to the First Council of the Seventy. During this time, Holland also served on the board of directors of both LDS Hospital and the Polynesian Cultural Center.

In 1980, Holland was appointed to succeed Dallin H. Oaks as BYU&#x27;s president. After a search committee was formed, as a favorite candidate of N. Eldon Tanner, First Counselor in the LDS Church&#x27;s First Presidency, and the protégé of the chair of the executive committee of the BYU Board of Trustees, Gordon B. Hinckley, Holland was appointed less than two days later. As the church&#x27;s commissioner of education at the time Oaks was released, Holland was supposed to compile a list of candidates to be the next BYU president. Instead, he was unexpectedly notified of the First Presidency&#x27;s intention to make him president. After his appointment, rumors on campus cited the decision as &quot;politically motivated&quot;. Before he arrived at BYU, Holland reduced the number of vice-presidents to four and increased the number of assistant and associate vice-presidents over academics.

Holland easily transitioned into the role of president. He was familiar with the president&#x27;s duties, since he had worked closely with Oaks as the commissioner of education. He placed emphasis on upgrading programs and improving relationships with faculty rather than focusing on physical expansion of the campus. In order to supplement the school&#x27;s funds, Holland launched a fundraiser called &quot;Excellence in the Eighties&quot; which sought to raise $100 million from 1982 to 1987. Specific funds were raised for student scholarships, academic programs, faculty salaries, and extension programs. He emphasized hiring more qualified faculty and purchasing more library and research materials. He supervised the building of the Crabtree Technology Building, but didn&#x27;t promise more than ten new buildings during his presidency.

A significant achievement during Holland&#x27;s presidency was the founding of the BYU Jerusalem Center. Also during his presidency, the BYU Center for International Studies was renamed the David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies and had its role at BYU re-emphasized. There had been a large amount of debate about BYU&#x27;s dress code throughout the previous administration. Holland clarified his support for dress code rules. Regarding violations of the Honor Code, if a student requested their names be removed from the church records, Holland instituted a policy in which they would have to receive special permission from the board of trustees in order to remain enrolled in school.

During Holland&#x27;s presidency, the weekly independent student newspaper, &quot;The 7th East Press&quot; was shut down due to writing about controversial topics. However, student editor, Dean Huffaker, believed that Holland had tried to prevent them from being banned because Holland was conscious of public relations and didn&#x27;t want to cause controversy. The students stated that they believed the ban came from one of the LDS Church&#x27;s general authorities.

Holland had the re-establishment of religious instruction as the &quot;hub&quot; of BYU&#x27;s academics as one of his significant administrative goals. While he did not initiate any significant changes along these lines, his public communications regularly emphasized the importance of religious education. As BYU&#x27;s president, Holland encouraged academic excellence in an atmosphere of faith. Holland emphasized that BYU could not do everything but would seek excellence in what it did choose to do.

Holland served as the president of the American Association of Presidents of Independent Colleges and Universities (AAPICU) and as a member of the NCAA&#x27;s presidents&#x27; committee. He also received the &quot;Torch of Liberty&quot; award from the Anti-Defamation League.

==LDS Church service==
Holland was called as a general authority and member of the First Quorum of the Seventy on April 1, 1989, bringing an end to his term as BYU&#x27;s president. As a member of the Seventy, Holland was a counselor in the general presidency of the church&#x27;s Young Men organization from 1989 to 1990.

Prior to his call as a general authority, Holland served as bishop of a single adult ward in Seattle, as a counselor in the presidency of the Hartford Connecticut Stake, and as a regional representative. He also served in the presidency of two other stakes and as a stake high councilor.

From 1990 to 1993, Holland and his wife lived in Solihull, England, where he served as president of the church&#x27;s Europe North Area.

On June 23, 1994, Holland was called and ordained as an apostle by new church president Howard W. Hunter. The vacancy was created by the death of Ezra Taft Benson and subsequent reorganization of the First Presidency. This timing differed from the typical sustaining of new apostles in a general conference and ordaining them afterward. Holland also met with the media on the day of his ordination. His call to the apostleship was subsequently ratified by the church during the October 1994 General Conference.

In 2000, Holland became the chair of the Missionary Curriculum Task Force which worked to develop &quot;Preach My Gospel&quot;.

Holland lived in Santiago and served as president of the church&#x27;s Chile Area from 2002 to 2004.

In church general conferences in the fall of 2007 and spring of 2008, Holland gave sermons that directly answered accusations that Latter-day Saints are not Christians. At the April 2009 general conference, Holland gave a sermon about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the importance of Christ&#x27;s statement, &quot;my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me&quot;. This talk was later reformatted with music and put on a church website where it had been viewed over 500,000 times by August 2009.

In 2012, Holland was the member of the Quorum of the Twelve with responsibility for the affairs of the LDS Church in Africa. Early in that year, he went to Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ghana to meet with members and missionaries. He also met with the Vice President of Sierra Leone, Samuel Sam-Sumana. In December 2012, Holland organized the LDS Church&#x27;s 3,000th stake, located in Freetown, Sierra Leone. On March 12, 2012, the Harvard Law School hosted Holland for a &quot;Mormonism 101&quot; series. On June 10, 2015, he addressed the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Foreign Affairs in the House of Lords at the UK Parliament. In 2016, Holland was keynote speaker at the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s (BSA) Duty to God breakfast, as part of his assignment as the LDS Church&#x27;s chief BSA representative.

From 2015 to 2023, among his other assignments, Holland served on the Church Board of Education and Boards of Trustees, where he also served as chairman of the Board&#x27;s Executive Committee from January 2018 to May 2023.

In November 2018, Holland spoke at a major inter-religious conference at Oxford University. During the same trip, Holland met with Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. This may have been the first official meeting of an LDS Church apostle and a British prime minister.

In January 2019, Holland presided at the groundbreaking for the church&#x27;s Urdaneta Philippines Temple. He also spoke at a multi-stake conference in the Philippines that week. In 2020, as chairman of the executive committee of the BYU-Hawaii board of trustees, he announced the appointment of John S. K. Kauwe III as the institution&#x27;s new president.

In August 2021, Holland spoke at BYU&#x27;s annual conference for faculty and staff and the speech sparked controversy within the LGBTQ+ community. In the address, Holland asked the faculty to defend the doctrine of the LDS Church, BYU&#x27;s institutional sponsor, with the use of metaphorical &quot;musket fire.&quot;

In April 2023, the church reported that Holland would take a two-month hiatus from service to focus on his health. He had been undergoing dialysis for a kidney issue and had also contracted COVID-19. In early June, Holland began to gradually return to church service.

After the death of M. Russell Ballard on November 12, 2023, Holland was appointed and set apart as the acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on November 15, 2023.

==Personal life==
Holland and his wife, Patricia Terry, were married on June 7, 1963, in the St. George Temple. They are the parents of three children. Their oldest son, Matthew S. Holland, served as president of Utah Valley University from 2009 to 2018 and has been a general authority since April 2020.
Their youngest son, David F. Holland, is the John A. Bartlett Professor of New England Church History
and Interim Dean of Harvard Divinity School. Patricia died on July 20, 2023, from causes incident to age and health.

<text>William Ladd (May 10, 1778 – April 9, 1841) was one of the earliest American anti-war activists, and the first president of the American Peace Society.

==Biography==
Ladd was born in Exeter, New Hampshire as a direct lineal descendant of Daniel Ladd, Sr. (1613–1693). After he graduated from Harvard in 1797 he shipped as a seaman from Portsmouth, New Hampshire in a vessel owned by his father, a local merchant. At 20 years old he was a capable New England captain and had seen much of the world. He briefly had a plantation in Florida which ultimately failed as he refused to use slave labor.

A disbeliever in war for any purpose, he turned at the outbreak of the War of 1812, when the British blockade temporarily stopped commerce. He moved to Minot, Maine, became a prosperous farmer, and devoted both his tongue and his pen to preaching non-resistance. In 1823 he wrote the first of 32 &quot;Essays on Peace and War&quot;, published in the &quot;Christian Mirror&quot; of Portland, Maine, which laid out a Christian case for pacifism. These essays were published pseudonymously as a book in 1825 (Portland, ME: Shirley &amp; Edwards) under the title &quot;The Essays of Philanthropos on Peace and War&quot;; a second revised and corrected edition was published in 1827 (Exeter, NH: J. T. Burnham in behalf of the Exeter and other peace societies). Subsequent essays would criticize the slave trade and the raising of the Bunker Hill Monument in Charlestown, Massachusetts as a memorial to war.

State and local &quot;peace societies&quot; already existed in the 1820s, but in 1828 the American Peace Society was formed with Ladd as its first president. The first meeting was held in New York City. Ladd wrote and published the society&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Harbinger of Peace&quot; (later &quot;The Calumet&quot;) from his house in Minot, Maine. In 1837, due to Ladd&#x27;s influence and against the arguments of other members, including the president of Bowdoin College, the constitution of the American Peace Society was amended to declare that all war was contrary to the Christian Gospel.

In 1840 Ladd proposed a plan for a World Congress and Court of Nations, somewhat similar to the later League of Nations or United Nations. He published &quot;An Essay on a Congress of Nations&quot; (1840). He was partly influenced by the military build-up the year before in his home state of Maine because of a border dispute with Britain, the so-called Aroostook War.

Ladd is buried in Portsmouth, New Hampshire

<doc id="874676" wikidata="Q1052359" url="?curid=874676" title="Hexi Corridor">
<text>The Hexi Corridor ( ), also known as the Gansu Corridor, is an important historical region located in the modern western Gansu province of China. It refers to a narrow stretch of traversable and relatively arable plain west of the Yellow River&#x27;s Ordos Loop (hence the name &quot;Hexi&quot;, meaning &#x27;west of the river&#x27;), flanked between the much more elevated and inhospitable terrains of the Mongolian and Tibetan Plateaus.

As part of the Northern Silk Road, running northwest from the western section of the Ordos Loop between Yinchuan and Lanzhou, the Hexi Corridor was the most important trade route in Northwest China. It linked China &quot;proper&quot; to the historic Western Regions for traders and military incursions into Central Asia. It is a string of oases along the northern edges of the Qilian Mountains and Altyn-Tagh, with the high and desolate Tibetan Plateau further to the south. To the north are the Longshou, Heli and Mazong Mountains separating it from the arid Badain Jaran Desert, Gobi Desert and the cold steppes of the Mongolian Plateau. At the western end, the route splits into three, going either north of the Tianshan Mountains or south on either side of the Tarim Basin. At the eastern end, the mountains around Lanzhou grants access to the Longxi Basin, which leads east through Mount Long along the Wei River valley into the populous Guanzhong Plain, and then into the Central Plain.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The Hexi Corridor is located in western Gansu province, bordered to the south by the Qilian Mountains and to the north by the Gobi Desert. It extends for approximately from Wushao Mountain in the south to Dunhuang in the north, and covers around .

There are several major cities along the Hexi Corridor. From west to east, the major cities are: Dunhuang, Yumen, Jiayuguan, Jiuquan, Zhangye, Jinchang, Wuwei, and finally Lanzhou in the southeast. Just south of the provincial boundary of Gansu lies Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, which served as the chief commercial hub of the Hexi Corridor along the Northern Silk Road.

==History==

=== Prehistory ===
The Hexi Corridor had been the site of east-west cultural exchanges across Eurasia since prehistory. It was first settled around 4800 BP in Neolithic times by millet farmers from the Yangshao Culture in the western Loess Plateau, who enabled the spread of millet to Central Asia and the rest of Eurasia and Africa. These farmers also had pottery production techniques from Northern China. Several cultures developed in the Hexi corridor during this time, such as the Majiayao, Banshan, and Machang.

The oldest bronze object to be discovered in China, dating to 5000-4500BP, was found at the Majiayao site. However, none of the Neolithic cultures in the Hexi Corridor at this time possessed the technology to smelt bronze, and only two sites had any bronze at all. As such, the Bronze Age only began in the Hexi Corridor around 4200BP with the arrival of smelting technology from Central Asia, and the production of bronze reached its peak around 4000-3500 BP. Domesticated livestock were also introduced to the area around this time; thus, these cultures typically farmed millet and wheat, while keeping livestock such as sheep, pigs, cattle and horses. Bronze age societies in the Hexi Corridor at this time include the Shajing, Qijia, Xichengyi, Siba, and Shanma cultures.

Wheat and barley from the Fertile Crescent arrived in the Hexi Corridor via Central Asia around 4000 BP, and later spread into China proper. By around 3700-3500 BP, most likely due to the continual weakening and retreat of the East Asian monsoon since 4000 BP which had caused increasing aridity, the more drought-resistant wheat and barley had replaced millet as the main staple crop in the Hexi Corridor. Cultures after this time period (such as the Shajing culture) saw a decrease in site numbers and bronze artifacts, and became dominated by nomadic production rather than agriculture.

=== Xiongnu conquest ===

The Yuezhi were a nomadic tribe that lived in the Hexi Corridor, and were possibly associated with the Shajing culture. The Xiongnu were a nomadic people, centered around the Ordos Block near the Yellow River, who were subordinate to the Yuezhi. The Xiongnu were pushed out of their heartlands by the Qin dynasty in 215 BCE, and the Great Wall of China was constructed to enclose these conquered territories, which included parts of the Hexi Corridor. As a result of this defeat, the Xiongnu unified under Modu Chanyu into a confederacy against the Qin. Following the collapse of the Qin dynasty in 206 BCE, the Xiongnu reoccupied the captured territories.

In 176 BCE, the Xiongnu confederation under Modu Chanyu decisively defeated their previous overlords, the Yuezhi, while also subjugating twenty-six other tribes in the vicinity. This, combined with two more defeats at the hands of the Xiongnu under Modu&#x27;s son Laoshang Chanyu, caused the westward escape of the majority of the Yuezhi survivors (later known as the Greater Yuezhi) from the Hexi Corridor, with the remaining population (the Lesser Yuezhi) mixing among the Qiang people south of the Hexi Corridor.

===Han incursions and occupation===
After their expulsion of the Yuezhi, the Xiongnu were in complete control of modern-day Gansu, and by extension the Hexi Corridor. Around 138 BCE, during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, diplomat Zhang Qian was sent to make contact with the Greater Yuezhi to convince them to ally with the Han dynasty against the Xiongnu, and for them to move back into their former lands in the Hexi Corridor. He was unsuccessful in doing so, and was captured and held by the Xiongnu on both his way to the Yuezhi and back, but was able to give detailed accounts of various kingdoms in the Tarim Basin and further areas which had been unknown to the Chinese before then. These accounts may have influenced the Han dynasty&#x27;s later decision to expand westwards.

In 134 or 133 BCE, Emperor Wu launched an attack against the Xiongnu in the Battle of Mayi, and the centuries-long Han-Xiongnu Wars began in a few years later in 129 BCE. In the in 121 BCE, Han general Huo Qubing expelled the Xiongnu from the region, and four new commanderies were established on these lands, namely (from east to west) Wuwei, Zhangye, Jiuquan and Dunhuang.

From around 115-60 BCE, using the Hexi Corridor as a base of operations, the Han dynasty fought with the Xiongnu over control of the Tarim Basin. An important turning point in this conflict was the War of the Heavenly Horses, which allowed the Han dynasty access to the Ferghana horses, known as &quot;heavenly horses&quot; following Zhang Qian&#x27;s account of them to the Han court. In 60 or 59 BCE, the Han dynasty gained control of the region and established the Protectorate of the Western Regions, partly because many of the oasis city-states in the Tarim Basin had become vassal states of the Han following the conquest of the Hexi Corridor and the War of the Heavenly Horses.

During the turbulent reign of Wang Mang, Han lost control over the Tarim Basin, which was reconquered by the Xiongnu in 63 CE and used as a base to invade the Hexi Corridor. Dou Gu defeated the Xiongnu again at the Battle of Yiwulu in 73 CE, evicting them from Turpan and chasing them as far as Lake Barkol before establishing a garrison at Hami.

After the new Protector General of the Western Regions Chen Mu was killed in 75 CE by allies of the Xiongnu in Karasahr and Kucha, the garrison at Hami was withdrawn. At the Battle of the Altai Mountains in 89 CE, Dou Xian defeated the Northern Chanyu, who retreated into the Altai Mountains. The Han forces, allied with the subjugated Southern Xiongnu, again defeated the Northern Chanyu twice in 90 CE and 91 CE, forcing him to flee west into Wusun and Kangju territories.

===Tang dynasty===


The Tang dynasty fought the Tibetan Empire for control of areas in Inner and Central Asia. There was a long string of conflicts with Tibet over territories in the Tarim Basin between 670 and 692.

In 763 the Tibetans even captured the Tang capital of Chang&#x27;an for fifteen days during the An Lushan Rebellion. It was during this rebellion that the Tang withdrew its western garrisons stationed in what is now Gansu and Qinghai, which the Tibetans then occupied along with the area that is modern Xinjiang. Hostilities between the Tang and Tibet continued until they signed a formal peace treaty in 821. The terms of this treaty, including fixed borders between the two countries, are recorded in a bilingual inscription on a stone pillar outside the Jokhang in Lhasa.

===Western Xia dynasty===
The Western Xia dynasty was established in the 11th century by the Tangut people. Western Xia controlled from 1038 CE up to 1227 CE the areas in what are now the northwestern Chinese provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Ningxia.

===Yuan dynasty===

Genghis Khan began the conquest of the Jin dynasty around 1207 and Ögedei Khan continued it after his death in 1227. The Jurchen-led Jin dynasty fell in 1234 CE with help from the Han-ruled Southern Song dynasty.

Ögedei also conquered the Western Xia dynasty in 1227, pacifying the Hexi Corridor region, which was later absorbed into the Yuan dynasty.

==Geography and climate==
The Hexi Corridor is a long, narrow passage stretching for some from the steep Wushaolin hillside near the modern city of Lanzhou to the Jade Gate at the border of Gansu and Xinjiang. There are many fertile oases along the path, watered by rivers flowing from the Qilian Mountains, such as the Shiyang, Jinchuan, Ejin (Heihe), and Shule Rivers.

A strikingly inhospitable environment surrounds this chain of oases: the snow-capped Qilian Mountains (the so-called &quot;southern mountains&quot; or &quot;Nanshan&quot;) to the south; the Beishan (&quot;northern mountains&quot;) mountainous area, the Alashan Plateau, and the vast expanse of the Gobi desert to the north.

Geologically, the Hexi Corridor belongs to a Cenozoic foreland basin system on the northeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau.
The ancient trackway formerly passed through Haidong, Xining and the environs of Juyan Lake, serving an effective area of about . It was an area where mountain and desert limited caravan traffic to a narrow trackway, where relatively small fortifications could control passing traffic.

There are several major cities along the Hexi Corridor. In western Gansu Province is Dunhuang (Shazhou), then Yumen, then Jiayuguan, then Jiuquan (Suzhou), then Zhangye (Ganzhou) in the center, then Jinchang, then Wuwei (Liangzhou) and finally Lanzhou in the southeast. In the past, Dunhuang was part of the area known as the Western Regions. South of Gansu Province, in the middle just over the provincial boundary, lies the city of Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province. Xining used to be the chief commercial hub of the Hexi Corridor.

The Jiayuguan fort guards the western entrance to China. It is located in Jiayuguan pass at the narrowest point of the Hexi Corridor, some southwest of the city of Jiayuguan. The Jiayuguan fort is the first fortification of Great Wall of China in the west.

<text>The genus Fagopyrum is in the flowering plant family Polygonaceae. It includes some important food plants, such as &quot;F. esculentum&quot; (buckwheat) and &quot;F. tataricum&quot; (Tartary buckwheat). The genus is native to the Indian subcontinent, much of Indochina, and central and southeastern China. Species have been widely introduced elsewhere, throughout the Holarctic and parts of Africa and South America.

==Description==
&quot;Fagopyrum&quot; contains 15 to 16 species of plants, including two important crop plants, buckwheat (&quot;Fagopyrum esculentum&quot;), and &quot;Fagopyrum tataricum&quot; (Tartary buckwheat). The two have similar uses, and are classed as pseudocereals, because they are used in the same way as cereals but do not belong to the grass family Poaceae.

Within &quot;Fagopyrum&quot;, the cultivated species are in the Cymosum group, including &quot;Fagopyrum cymosum&quot; or perennial buckwheat, the artificial hybrid &quot;Fagopyrum&quot; × &quot;giganteum&quot;, and &quot;Fagopyrum homotropicum&quot;.

This genus has five-petaled flowers arranged in a compound raceme that produces laterally flowered cymose clusters.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Fagopyrum&quot; was first published by Philip Miller in 1754. It is placed in the tribe Fagopyreae (as the only genus) in the subfamily Polygonoideae.

===Species===

<doc id="874698" wikidata="Q2707277" url="?curid=874698" title="Eriogonum">
<text>Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat. This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing. It includes some common wildflowers such as the California buckwheat (&quot;Eriogonum fasciculatum&quot;).

The genus derived its name from the Greek word &quot;erion&quot; meaning &#x27;wool&#x27; and &quot;gonu&quot; meaning &#x27;knee or joint&#x27;. The author of the genus, Michaux, explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus (&quot;E. tomentosum&quot;) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems (&quot;planta lanata, geniculata&quot;). Despite sharing the common name &quot;buckwheat&quot;, &quot;Eriogonum&quot; is part of a different genus than the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat.

In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened. One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat (&quot;Eriogonum truncatum&quot;, believed to be extinct) was rediscovered.

==Ecology==

&quot;Eriogonum&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). An example of a butterfly that uses this plant for food is the &quot;Lycaena heteronea&quot;. Several of these are monophagous, meaning their caterpillars only feed on this genus, sometimes just on a single taxon of &quot;Eriogonum&quot;. Wild buckwheat flowers are also an important source of food for these and other Lepidoptera. In some cases, the relationship is so close that &quot;Eriogonum&quot; and dependent Lepidoptera are in danger of coextinction.

Monophagous Lepidoptera on wild buckwheat include:
* &quot;Apodemia mormo&quot; (Mormon metalmark) – feeds exclusively on &quot;Eriogonum&quot;
** &quot;Apodemia mormo langei&quot; (Lange&#x27;s metalmark) – only known from &quot;Eriogonum nudum&quot; ssp. &quot;auriculatum&quot;
* &quot;Chionodes dammersi&quot; – feeds exclusively on &quot;Eriogonum&quot;
* &quot;Chionodes luteogeminatus&quot; – only known from &quot;Eriogonum niveum&quot;
* &quot;Euphilotes enoptes smithi&quot; (Smith&#x27;s blue butterfly) – only known from &quot;Eriogonum latifolium&quot; and &quot;Eriogonum parvifolium&quot;
* &quot;Euphilotes battoides allyni&quot; (El Segundo blue butterfly) - only known from &quot;Eriogonum parvifolium&quot;
Additionally, bees of the sagebrush steppe rely on the nectar of desert buckwheats, and birds and rodents eat the seeds.

==Uses==
Some varieties of eriogonum, such as California buckwheat were and still are used as medicinal and food crops by Native American tribes.

<text>Robert Dean Hales (August 24, 1932 – October 1, 2017) was an American businessman and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1994 until his death. As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, Hales was accepted by the church as a prophet, seer, and revelator. At the time of his death he was the fifth most senior apostle in the church.

==Biography==
Hales was born in New York City and raised in both Queens and Great Neck, New York. He was the youngest of three children born to John Rulon Hales, an artist who worked in advertising primarily, and his wife, Vera Marie Holbrook. The Hales family was heavily involved in the LDS Church. The family attended the Queens Ward, which met in a rented space. As a youth Hales would help clean it from the party that had occurred the night before. 

Hales played baseball while he was a student at Great Neck High School and then later at the University of Utah (U of U). He also played in some semi-professional leagues, but hurt his arm from pitching that was too intense while playing in Arizona. Prior to this injury, he had been considered to have a strong chance of playing in the major leagues. After the injury forced him out of baseball, Hales joined the Air Force ROTC unit at the U of U. While he was a student at the U of U, Hales worked for KSL-TV and KDYL. After obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree at the U of U, he was a fighter pilot for four years in the U.S. Air Force. Hales later earned an MBA degree from the Harvard Business School (HBS) in 1960.

Hales married Mary Crandall, whom he met in New York the summer before his sophomore year of college, in the Salt Lake Temple on June 10, 1953. During the summer they were married, Hales was working at the United Nations building. Crandall, who was a student at Brigham Young University, had moved from California to New York shortly before she met Hales. They had two sons.

During his professional business career, Hales served in executive positions with four major national companies. His first job out of HBS was with the Gillette Company. To ensure a broad perspective of the business, Hales convinced management to let him work some on the factory floor and also in stocking razors in drug stores. This gave him a broad perspective that allowed him to quickly rise to senior management.

After joining the Gillette Company, he became president of Papermate, a division of Gillette. He later joined Max Factor as a vice president. Hales was appointed executive vice president for marketing of the Hughes Television Network and its division, Hughes Sports Network in 1973. Just prior to his call to be a general authority, Hales was president of Chesebrough-Pond&#x27;s. One of his strengths as a businessman was being able to synthesize both financial data and a strong sense of where the market was going from interacting with it as much as possible. His presentations of new products and marketing approaches were presented in ways that to some seemed like painting ideas.

In 1987, Hales was appointed to the Utah State Board of Regents. Hales was close with the musical family, The 5 Browns, and performed the marriages for the oldest two children. In 2010, Deseret Book published a book written by Hales entitled &quot;Return&quot;.

==LDS Church service==
While Hales was a graduate student at HBS he served in the LDS Church as an elders quorum president. He also served as a seminary teacher while he lived in Downey, California. Hales served three times in the church as a bishop (in Weston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; and Frankfurt, Germany). He served as a branch president, both in Weston and in Albany, Georgia. The assignment as branch president in Weston was while he was a student at HBS, where one of the counselors in the district presidency was Henry B. Eyring. Hales served in the branch presidency in Seville, Spain and in Germany. He also served on the stake high council, both while living in London, England and in Massachusetts. He also became a counselor in the presidency of the Boston Massachusetts Stake when it was first organized in 1960. He later served as a regional representative, with assignments in both Louisiana and Minnesota. 

===General Authority===
In 1975, Hales was called as a general authority and became an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In 1976, the role of Assistant to the Twelve was discontinued and he, along with others serving at the time, became members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. He was the last living person who had served as an Assistant to the Twelve. 

During his first decade as a general authority, Hales was given assignments related to the physical and financial operations of the LDS Church. He oversaw a reduction in the number of the church&#x27;s welfare farms and also divestment from the Utah and Idaho Sugar Company.

In the late 1970s, while serving as a general authority, Hales also served as president of the church&#x27;s England London Mission. After his service in London, Hales was appointed the church&#x27;s Area Supervisor in Europe. In this capacity, he worked with Thomas S. Monson on supervising the church in East Germany and worked towards the building of a temple there. He also served for a time as a counselor in the Sunday School General Presidency. Hales served in the First Quorum of the Seventy until 1985 when he became the church&#x27;s eleventh presiding bishop. He served as the presiding bishop until 1994, during which time he emphasized the importance of the principles of the church&#x27;s welfare program.

Hales was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve on April 2, 1994. He was ordained an apostle on April 7, 1994, filling a vacancy created by the death of Marvin J. Ashton. In 2002, Hales served as chair of the church&#x27;s Olympic Coordinating Council. As a native of New York City, Hales was often the church&#x27;s &quot;point man&quot; on dealing with issues in the city. He was involved in some of the early planning that led to the building of the Manhattan New York Temple.

== Health issues and death ==
Over the years, Hales had several health issues impacting his church service. This included missing the church&#x27;s April 2011 General Conference. In September 2017, he was again hospitalized and a church spokesman noted that, in view of the recommendations of attending physicians, Hales would not participate in the upcoming General Conference. Hales died on October 1, 2017, shortly after the conclusion of the conference&#x27;s Sunday morning session. His death was announced by Henry B. Eyring at the beginning of the afternoon session. Funeral services for Hales were held in the Salt Lake Tabernacle in Salt Lake City, on October 6, 2017. A private burial service followed at the Bountiful City Cemetery in Bountiful, Utah.

<doc id="874724" wikidata="Q460578" url="?curid=874724" title="Michael G. Wilson">
<text>Michael Gregg Wilson, (born January 21, 1942) is an American-British screenwriter and film producer, best known for his association with the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series.

== Background ==
Wilson was born in New York City, the son of Dana (née Natol) and actor Lewis Wilson. His father was the first actor to play the DC Comics character Batman in live action, which he did in the 1943 film serial &quot;Batman&quot;. He is the stepson of the James Bond producer Albert R. Broccoli and half-brother to Bond co-producer Barbara Broccoli. Wilson graduated from Harvey Mudd College in 1963 as an electrical engineer. He later studied law at Stanford University. After graduating, Wilson worked for the United States government and later a firm located in Washington, D.C. that specialized in international law.

Wilson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2022 New Year Honours for services to film, drama, philanthropy and skills, both alongside Barbara Broccoli. Wilson was awarded the British Film Institute Fellowship in 2022. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli are founders of the London Screen Academy. 

In 2010, Wilson was given The Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s award for Outstanding Service to Photography, which carries with it an Honorary Fellowship of The Society. in 1998 Wilson and his wife Jane founded the Wilson Centre of Photography, a facility for research on the history, aesthetics and preservation of photographs. The Centre has an active programme that includes exhibition collaborations and loans for international museums and galleries. 

Wilson is Honorary Vice President of the Science Museum Foundation, Fellow of the Science Museum London, as well as Trustee for the Carnegie Institution for Science and Harvey Mudd College.

== James Bond franchise ==
In 1972, Wilson joined Eon Productions, the production company responsible for the James Bond film series dating back to 1962, beginning with his stepfather Albert R. &#x27;Cubby&#x27; Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. Wilson specifically worked in Eon Productions&#x27; legal department until taking on a more active role as an assistant to Cubby Broccoli for the film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977). In 1979 Wilson became executive producer of the film &quot;Moonraker&quot; and since has been an executive producer or producer in every James Bond film, currently co-producing with his half-sister Barbara Broccoli.

Wilson collaborated five times with veteran Bond screenwriter Richard Maibaum, starting in 1981 with &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;. In 1989, Wilson was forced to finish the screenplay to &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; alone due to a strike by the Writers Guild of America West which prevented Maibaum from having any further involvement. For both, this was their final James Bond script, as Maibaum died in 1991 and Wilson ceased writing, although he outlined a never-produced film in the series with writer Alfonse Ruggiero, scrapped due to internal legal issues between Eon and MGM (the following film, &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, being a completely different story written by Michael France).

In addition to his production duties, Wilson has also made many cameo appearances (speaking and non-speaking) in the Bond films. His first appearance, long before becoming a producer, was in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; in which he appeared as a soldier. Wilson has made cameo appearances in every Eon-produced Bond film since 1977. In February 2025, Wilson and Broccoli announced that they would be ceding creative control of the Bond franchise to Amazon MGM Studios for a reported $1 billion, forming &quot;a new joint venture to house the James Bond intellectual property rights&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Wilson and his wife Jane have two sons: A younger son, Gregg Wilson, and an older son, David G. Wilson, both of whom work at Eon Productions.

<text>Allan Charles Wilson FRS AAA&amp;S (18 October 1934 – 21 July 1991) was a professor of biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, a pioneer in the use of molecular approaches to understand evolutionary change and reconstruct phylogenies, and a revolutionary contributor to the study of human evolution. He was one of the most significant figures in post-war biology; his work attracted a great deal of attention both from within and outside the academic world. He is the only New Zealander to have won the MacArthur Fellowship.

He is best known for experimental demonstration of the concept of the molecular clock (with his doctoral student Vincent Sarich), which was theoretically postulated by Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl, revolutionary insights into the nature of the molecular anthropology of higher primates and human evolution, and the so-called Mitochondrial Eve hypothesis (with his doctoral students Rebecca L. Cann and Mark Stoneking).

==Early life and education==
Allan Wilson was born in Ngāruawāhia, New Zealand, and raised on his family&#x27;s rural dairy farm at Helvetia, Pukekohe, about twenty miles south of Auckland. At his local Sunday School, the vicar&#x27;s wife was impressed by young Allan&#x27;s interest in evolution and encouraged Allan&#x27;s mother to enroll him at the elite King&#x27;s College secondary school in Auckland. There he excelled in mathematics, chemistry, and sports. Wilson already had an interest in evolution and biochemistry, but intended to be the first in his family to attend university by pursuing studies in agriculture and animal science. Wilson met Professor Campbell Percy McMeekan, a New Zealand pioneer in animal science, who suggested that Wilson attend the University of Otago in southern New Zealand to further his study in biochemistry rather than veterinary science. Wilson gained a BSc from the University of Otago in 1955, majoring in both zoology and biochemistry. The bird physiologist Donald S. Farner met Wilson as an undergraduate at Otago and invited him to Washington State University at Pullman as his graduate student. Wilson obliged and completed a master&#x27;s degree in zoology at WSU under Farner in 1957, where he worked on the effects of photoperiod on the physiology of birds.

Wilson then moved to the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue his doctoral research. At the time the family thought Allan would only be gone two years. Instead, Wilson remained in the United States, gaining his PhD at Berkeley in 1961 under the direction of biochemist Arthur Pardee for work on the regulation of flavin biosynthesis in bacteria. From 1961 to 1964, Wilson studied as a post-doc under biochemist Nathan O. Kaplan at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. In Kaplan&#x27;s lab, working with lactate and malate dehydrogenases, Wilson was first introduced to the nascent field of molecular evolution. Nate Kaplan was one of the very earliest pioneers to address phylogenetic problems with evidence from protein molecules, an approach that Wilson later famously applied to human evolution and primate relationships. After Brandeis, Wilson returned to Berkeley where he set up his own lab in the Biochemistry department, remaining there for the rest of his life.

==Career and scientific contributions==
Wilson joined the UC Berkeley faculty of biochemistry in 1964, and was promoted to full professor in 1972. His first major scientific contribution was published as &quot;Immunological Time-Scale For Hominid Evolution&quot; in the journal &quot;Science&quot; in December 1967. With his student Vincent Sarich, he showed that evolutionary relationships of the human species with other primates, in particular the great apes (humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans), could be inferred from molecular evidence obtained from living species, rather than solely from fossils of extinct creatures. Their microcomplement fixation method (see complement system) measured the strength of the immune reaction between an antigen (serum albumin) from one species and an antibody raised against the same antigen in another species. The strength of the antibody-antigen reaction was known to be stronger between more closely related species: their innovation was to measure it quantitatively among many species pairs as an &quot;&quot;immunological distance&quot;. When these distances were plotted against the divergence times of species pair with well-established evolutionary histories, the data showed that the molecular difference increased linearly with time, in what was termed a &quot;molecular clock&quot;&quot;. Given this calibration curve, the time of divergence between species pairs with unknown or uncertain fossil histories could be inferred. Most controversially, their data suggested that divergence times between humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas were on the order of 3~5 million years, far less than the estimates of 9~30 million years accepted by conventional paleoanthropologists from fossil hominids such as &quot;Ramapithecus&quot;. This &#x27;recent origin&#x27; theory of human/ape divergence remained controversial until the discovery of the &quot;Lucy&quot; fossils, in 1974, definitively dated in 1992 as between 3.22 and 3.18 million years.

Wilson and another PhD student Mary-Claire King subsequently compared several lines of genetic evidence (immunology, amino acid differences, and protein electrophoresis) on the divergence of humans and chimpanzees, and showed that all methods agreed that the two species were &gt;99% similar. Given the large organismal differences between the two species in the absence of large genetic differences, King and Wilson proposed that it was not structural gene differences that were responsible for species differences, but gene regulation of those differences, that is, the timing and manner in which near-identical gene products are assembled during embryology and development. In combination with the &quot;molecular clock&quot; hypothesis, this contrasted sharply with the accepted view that larger or smaller organismal differences were due to large or smaller amounts of genetic divergence.

In the early 1980s, Wilson further disturbed and refined traditional anthropological thinking by his work with PhD students Rebecca Cann and Mark Stoneking on the so-called &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot; hypothesis. In his efforts to identify informative genetic markers for tracking human evolutionary history, he focused on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) – genes that are found in mitochondria organelles in the cytoplasm of the cell outside the nucleus. Because of its location in the cytoplasm, mtDNA is passed exclusively from mother to child, the father making no contribution, and in the absence of genetic recombination defines female lineages over evolutionary timescales. Because it also mutates rapidly, it is possible to measure the small genetic differences among individual within species and between closely related species by restriction endonuclease gene mapping. Wilson, Cann, and Stoneking measured differences among many individuals from different human continental groups, and found that humans from Africa showed the greatest inter-individual differences, consistent with an African origin of the human species (the Recent African origin of modern humans or &quot;Out of Africa&quot; hypothesis). The data further indicated that all living humans shared a common maternal ancestor, who lived in Africa only a few hundreds of thousands of years ago. This common ancestor became widely known in the media and popular culture as the &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot;. This had the unfortunate and erroneous implication that only a single female lived at that time, when in fact the occurrence of a coalescent ancestor is a necessary consequence of population genetic theory, and the Mitochondrial Eve would have been only one of many humans (male and female) alive at that time. This finding was, like his earlier results, not readily accepted by anthropologists. The conventional hypothesis had been that various human continental groups had evolved from diverse ancestors, over several millions of years since divergence from chimpanzees. The mtDNA data, however, strongly support the alternative and now generally accepted hypothesis, that all humans descend relatively recently from a common, relatively small African population.

==Death and legacy==
Wilson became ill with leukaemia, and after a bone marrow transplant, died on Sunday, 21 July 1991, at the Fred Hutchinson Memorial Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He had been scheduled to give the keynote address at an international conference the same day. He was 56, at the height of his scientific recognition and powers. He was survived by his wife, Leona Wilson (died in 2009), and two children, Ruth (1961-2014), of East Lansing, Michigan, and David (born 1964), of San Francisco.

Wilson&#x27;s success can be attributed to his strong interest and depth of knowledge in biochemistry and evolutionary biology, his insistence of quantification of evolutionary phenomena, and his early recognition of new molecular techniques that could shed light on questions of evolutionary biology. After development of quantitative immunological methods, his lab was the first to recognise restriction endonuclease mapping analysis as a quantitative evolutionary genetic method, which led to his early use of DNA sequencing, and the then-nascent technique of PCR to obtain large DNA sets for genetic analysis of populations. He trained scores of undergraduate, graduate (17 women and 17 men received their doctoral degrees in his lab), and post-doctoral students in molecular evolutionary biology, including sabbatical visitors from six continents. His lab published more than 300 technical papers, and was recognised in the 1970s ~ 80s as the mecca for those wishing to enter the field of molecular evolution.

The Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution was established in 2002 in his honour to advance knowledge of the evolution and ecology of New Zealand and Pacific plant and animal life, and human history in the Pacific. The Centre was under the Massey University, at Palmerston North, New Zealand, as a national collaboration among the University of Auckland, Victoria University of Wellington, the University of Otago, University of Canterbury, and the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research. The Centre closed at the end of 2015 when the Government stopped funding it.

A 41-minute documentary film of his life entitled &quot;Allan Wilson, Evolutionary: Biochemist, Biologist, Giant of Molecular Biology&quot; was released by Films Media Group in 2008.

<text>Richard Gordon Scott (November 7, 1928 – September 22, 2015) was an American scientist and religious leader who served as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

Scott was born in Idaho in 1928 and grew up in Washington, D.C. He attended George Washington University as an undergraduate, graduating in 1950 with a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering. He then served a full-time LDS mission in Uruguay from 1950 to 1953, achieving fluency in Spanish. Upon his return in 1953, Scott married Jeanene Watkins, his college girlfriend and the daughter of U.S. Senator Arthur Watkins, and began working as a nuclear engineer for Naval Reactors under the leadership of Admiral Hyman Rickover. Scott worked for the U.S. government until 1965, when the LDS Church selected him to serve as a mission president in Argentina. He completed his service in 1968 and returned to Washington, D.C., where he worked for a private nuclear engineering consulting firm. Scott&#x27;s scientific career ended in 1977 when the LDS Church called him to serve as a general authority. Following the death of Marion G. Romney in 1988, Scott was chosen to fill the subsequent vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and served in that position until his death in 2015.

==Background and education==
Scott was born in Pocatello, Idaho, to Kenneth Leroy Scott and Mary Eliza Whittle. When he was five years old, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where his father worked in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. His father was not a member of the LDS Church at the time, and his mother was marginally active, until the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture in the Eisenhower administration, church apostle Ezra Taft Benson, named Kenneth Scott as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture. Benson&#x27;s influence led to his father&#x27;s conversion and the reactivation of his mother. In 1988, as church president, Benson appointed Richard as a church apostle.

Encouraged by his bishop and home teachers, Scott had attended church sporadically at times during his youth but felt out of place. He lacked confidence socially and athletically at school, although he excelled academically, was a class president, played the clarinet in the band, and was a drum major in the marching band.

During his high school summers, Scott worked various jobs to earn money for college. Working on an oyster boat off the coast of Long Island, New York, during one summer, the hardened fishermen mocked him for not drinking alcohol. When a man went overboard and 17-year-old &quot;Scotty&quot; was the only sober man on board, he was sent overboard to look for him. In other summers, Scott cut down trees in Utah for the forest service and repaired railroad cars; he also worked as a dishwasher and assistant cook for a logging company in Utah.

Scott graduated from George Washington University with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. At the time, he was dating Jeanene Watkins, the daughter of U.S. Senator Arthur V. Watkins. When she categorically stated that she would only marry a returned missionary in an LDS temple, Scott&#x27;s career plans changed and he applied for missionary service. He was called to serve in the Uruguay Montevideo Mission. It was during his missionary service that Scott was able to fill &quot;all the voids of loneliness&quot; he had felt since his youth. Jeanene graduated in sociology and left the day after graduation for a mission to the northwestern United States. After they both completed their missionary service, they married in the Manti Temple on July 16, 1953.

The Scotts had seven children, five of whom reached adulthood. Their first son died after an operation to correct a congenital heart condition. Their second daughter lived only minutes and died six weeks before the death of their first son. Jeanene Watkins Scott died on May 15, 1995, after a short battle with cancer.

==Career==

A few weeks after returning from Uruguay, Scott was interviewed by Hyman G. Rickover, &quot;father of the nuclear Navy&quot;. The interview seemed to go poorly since, when Scott mentioned his recent missionary service, the volatile Captain snapped, &quot;and what do I care about your mission?&quot; When asked what was the last book he read, Scott had to answer truthfully that it was the Book of Mormon. When all seemed lost to Scott, he stood to leave, but Rickover told him to wait, saying that he had only been testing his confidence and whether he would be true to what he believed, since this would be a difficult project. Scott was then offered the job working on the design of the nuclear reactor for the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, the first nuclear-powered submarine of the U.S. Navy. While working for Naval Reactors, Scott reported to Harry Mandil, reactor engineering branch director and became one of Mandil&#x27;s key reactor material engineers. Scott later completed what was an equivalent to a doctorate in nuclear engineering at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, but due to the classified nature of the work, a formal university degree was not awarded. He also worked on the development of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station—the first commercial land-based nuclear power plant. He worked with Rickover until 1965 when he and his family moved to Córdoba, Argentina, when he was called as president of the church&#x27;s Argentina North Mission. One of his missionaries was D. Todd Christofferson, who would later be called to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve with Scott.

After his return from Argentina, Scott joined other former Rickover staffers at a private consulting firm specializing in nuclear engineering, working out of Washington, D.C. He worked there until his call as a church general authority in 1977.

==LDS Church service==
Scott served in the LDS Church in many capacities. His ability to speak Spanish aided him in many assignments. Apart from his 31-month mission to Uruguay, he served as a stake clerk and as a counselor in a stake presidency before his service as a mission president. He served as a regional representative in the Uruguay, Paraguay, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. areas. He was called as a general authority and member of the First Quorum of the Seventy in April 1977. In 1983, he was called to the Presidency of the Seventy.

As a seventy, Scott served as managing director of the Genealogical Department and Executive Administrator of the church for Southern Mexico and Central America.

On October 1, 1988, Scott was called to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, filling the vacancy created by the death of quorum president Marion G. Romney. As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, Scott was accepted by the church as a prophet, seer, and revelator.

After not speaking in the church&#x27;s general conference earlier in the month, on April 23, 2015, Scott was hospitalized with gastrointestinal bleeding. The bleeding was brought under control within the next 24 hours, and he was released from the hospital on April 28. The bleeding was later determined to have been caused by an ulcer. The church reported that &quot;Elder Scott, known for his gentle manner and devoted service, has experienced a fading memory incident to age, and is not fully able to participate in meetings of the Quorum of the Twelve at this time. Doctors consider his condition as stable.&quot;

Scott died on September 22, 2015, at age 86, due to causes incident to age. His death meant that there were three vacancies in the Quorum of the Twelve apostles. With the death of fellow apostles L. Tom Perry and Boyd K. Packer in the previous months, there had not been so many vacancies in the Quorum since 1906. The vacancies were filled in the next general conference in October.

==Writings==
Scott was a regular speaker at Church Educational System firesides and at the church&#x27;s general conferences. In these settings he was known &quot;for delivering compassionate talks ... looking directly into the camera, and pleading for repentance and improvements in the lives of members. He emphasizes the Savior&#x27;s compassion and willingness to forgive past transgressions, and pleads for members to repent and move on with their lives.&quot;

In 2007, Scott wrote &quot;Finding Peace, Happiness and Joy&quot;, his first book written as an apostle. It carries on many themes from his talks such as repentance and finding happiness through the atonement of Jesus Christ.

Some of the addresses he has delivered in general conferences include:
* &quot;To Heal the Shattering Consequences of Abuse&quot;, April 2008 General Conference
* &quot;Truth, the Foundation of Correct Decisions&quot;, October 2007 General Conference
* &quot;Jesus Christ, Our Redeemer&quot;, April 1997 General Conference

<doc id="874736" wikidata="Q2478413" url="?curid=874736" title="Mesoamerican languages">
<text>Mesoamerican languages are the languages indigenous to the Mesoamerican cultural area, which covers southern Mexico, all of Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, and parts of Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The area is characterized by extensive linguistic diversity containing several hundred different languages and seven major language families. Mesoamerica is also an area of high linguistic diffusion in that long-term interaction among speakers of different languages through several millennia has resulted in the convergence of certain linguistic traits across disparate language families. The Mesoamerican sprachbund is commonly referred to as the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area.

The languages of Mesoamerica were also among the first to evolve independent traditions of writing. The oldest texts date to approximately 1000 BCE (namely Olmec and Zapotec), though most texts in the indigenous scripts (such as Maya) date to c. 600–900 CE. Following the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, and continuing up until the 19th century, most Mesoamerican languages were written in Latin script.

The languages of Mesoamerica belong to 6 major families – Mayan, Oto-Mangue, Mixe–Zoque, Totonacan, Uto-Aztecan and Chibchan languages (only on the southern border of the area) – as well as a few smaller families and isolates – Purépecha, Huave, Tequistlatec, Xincan and Lencan. Among these Oto-Manguean and Mayan families account for the largest numbers of speakers by far – each having speakers numbering more than a million. Many Mesoamerican languages today are either endangered or already extinct, but others, including the Mayan languages, Nahuatl, Mixtec and Zapotec, have several hundred thousand speakers and remain viable.

==Language vs. dialect==
The distinction between related languages and dialects is notoriously vague in Mesoamerica. The dominant Mesoamerican socio-cultural pattern through millennia has been centered around the town or city as the highest level community rather than the nation, realm or people. This has meant that within Mesoamerica each city-state or town community, called in Nahuatl an , has had its own language standard which, in the typical case, has evolved separately from closely related but geographically remote languages. Even geographically close communities with closely related, mutually intelligible languages have not necessarily seen themselves as being ethnically related, or their language as being a unifying factor between them. The relative endogamy of the town community has also resulted in a large linguistic diversification between communities despite geographical and linguistic proximity, often resulting in a low intelligibility between varieties of the same language spoken in adjacent communities. The exception to this rule is when a common “lingua franca” has evolved to facilitate communication between different linguistic groups. This has been the case for Classical Nahuatl and Classical Maya, both of which, at different times in history, have been used as a common language between different ethnic groups. Further complicating matters are the semi-nomadic lifestyle of many Mesoamerican peoples, and political systems which often have used relocation of entire communities as a political tool. Dialect or variant “chaining” is common, where any adjacent two or three towns in a sequence are similar enough in speech to understand each other fairly well, but those separated more widely have trouble understanding each other, and there are no clear breaks naturally separating the continuum into coherent sub-regions.

All of these factors together have made it exceedingly difficult to distinguish between what constitutes a language or a dialect in Mesoamerica. Linguistic isoglosses do not coincide often or strongly enough to prove very useful when trying to decide, and sociological factors often further cloud the picture. The significance of measurements of intelligibility (which is itself difficult to measure) depends very much on analysts&#x27; purposes and theoretical commitments. In Spanish the word has often been used generically about indigenous languages in order to describe them as inherently inferior to the European languages. In recent years this has caused an aversion to the term “dialect” among Spanish-speaking linguists and others, and the term has often been applied instead.

Many Mesoamerican linguistic groupings have not had different names in common usage for their different languages and some linguistic groups known by a single name show a sufficiently significant variation to warrant division into a number of languages which are quite low in mutual intelligibility. This is the case for example for the Mixtecan, Zapotecan and Nahuan linguistic groups, which all contain distinct languages that are nonetheless referred to by a single name. Sometimes a single name has even been used to describe completely unrelated linguistic groups, as is the case with the terms &quot;Popoluca&quot; or &quot;Chichimeca&quot;. This shortage of language names has meant that the convention within Mesoamerican linguistics when writing about a specific linguistic variety is to always mention the name of the broad linguistic group as well as the name of the community, or geographic location in which it is spoken, for example Isthmus-Mecayapan Nahuatl, Zoogocho Zapotec or Usila Chinantec. Some language groups however have been more adequately named. This is the case of the Mayan languages, with an internal diversity that is arguably comparable to that found between the Nahuatl dialects, but many of whose linguistic varieties have separate names, such as Kʼicheʼ, Tzotzil or Huastec.

==Geographical overview==
Mesoamerica can be divided into smaller linguistic subareas wherein linguistic diffusion has been especially intense, or where certain families have extended to become predominant.

One such subarea would be the Maya area, roughly covering the Yucatán Peninsula, Guatemala, Belize, Chiapas and Tabasco, where Mayan languages have been highly predominant. The fringes of the area have been home to Xincan (in the southeast) and Mixe-Zoque (along the Pacific coast) speakers, in addition to Nawat (also along the Pacific coast) and the Oto-Manguean Chiapanec language (in the southwest) following postclassic migrations.

Another linguistic area is Oaxaca, which is dominated by speakers of Oto-Manguean languages, mainly Mixtec and Zapotec, both of which are extremely internally diverse. Non-Oto-Manguean languages include Mixe, Tequistlatecan, Huave, and the Nahuan Pochutec language. Huave was the original language of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, but lost territory to Zapotec. Oaxaca is the most linguistically diverse area of Mesoamerica and its contain at least 100 mutually unintelligible linguistic variants.

The subarea commonly called Central Mexico, covering valleys and mountainous areas surrounding the Valley of Mexico, originally was mainly host to Oto-Pamean languages; however, beginning in the late classic these languages were largely gradually displaced by Nahuatl, which was henceforth the predominant indigenous language of the area. Otomi, Matlatzinca, and Mazahua retained significant presences.

The Western area was inhabited mostly by speakers of Purépecha in Michoacán, Huichol and Cora in Nayarit, and Western Peripheral Nahuatl in Jalisco and Colima. A host of small undocumented languages were spoken in Colima and southern Jalisco, such as Jalisco Otomi and Jalisco Zapotec.

The Northern Rim area has been inhabited by semi-nomadic Chichimec speakers of Uto-Aztecan languages (probably related to the Tepiman and Corachol groups) as well as Pame (Oto-Mangue), and other undocumented languages that are now extinct, such as Jalisco Otomi.

The Gulf area is traditionally the home of speakers of Totonacan languages in the northern and central area and Mixe–Zoque languages in the southern area. However, the northern gulf area became home to the speakers of Huastec in the preclassic period, and the southern area began speaking Isthmus Nahuatl in the post-classic period.

The areas of Central America (excluding the Maya areas) that formed part of Mesoamerica during the preclassic were dominated by Lencan speakers. Based on toponymy, it is possible that Xincan languages were originally spoken in western El Salvador, but were replaced by Nawat after postclassic migrations. The migrations of Subtiaba and Mangue speakers, possibly also during the postclassic period, expanded the realm of Mesoamerican cultural influence to include the Pacific coast of Nicaragua and the Nicoya Peninsula, which were previously part of the Isthmo-Colombian area and probably inhabited by Misumalpan and Chibchan speakers.

The Guerrero subarea has been home to the Oto-Manguean Tlapanec and the unclassified Cuitlatec, and later Nahuatl, as well as a handful of undocumented languages along the Costa Grande.

==Linguistic prehistory==
The linguistic history of Mesoamerican languages can roughly be divided into pre-Columbian, colonial and modern periods.

===Pre-Columbian period===
The first human presence in Mesoamerica is documented around 8000 BCE, during a period referred to as the Paleo-Indian. Linguistic data, however, including language reconstruction derived from the comparative method, do not reach further back than approximately 5000 years (towards the end of the Archaic period). Throughout the history of Mesoamerica, an unknown number of languages and language families became extinct and left behind no evidence of their existence. What is known about the pre-Columbian history of the Mesoamerican languages is what can be surmised from linguistic, archeological and ethnohistorical evidence. Often, hypotheses concerning the linguistic prehistory of Mesoamerica rely on very little evidence.

====Archaic period (–2000 BCE)====
Three large language families are thought to have had their most recent common homelands within Mesoamerica. The time frames and locations in which the common ancestors of these families, referred to by linguists as proto-languages, were spoken are reconstructed by methods of historical linguistics. The three earliest known families of Mesoamerica are the Mixe–Zoquean languages, the Oto-Manguean languages and the Mayan languages. Proto-Oto-Manguean is thought to have been spoken in the Tehuacán valley between 5000 and 3000 BCE, although it may only have been one center of Oto-manguean culture, another possible Oto-Manguean homeland being Oaxaca. Proto-Mayan was spoken in the Cuchumatanes highlands of Guatemala around 3000 BCE. Proto-Mixe–Zoquean was spoken on the gulf coast and on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and on the Guatemalan Pacific coast around 2000 BCE, in a much larger area than its current extension. Totonacan languages, Purépecha, Huave and the Tequistlatecan languages can also be assumed to have been present in Mesoamerica at this point although it is unknown.

====Preclassic period (2000 BCE – 200 CE)====
The first complex society in Mesoamerica was the Olmec civilization, which emerged around 2000 BCE during the Early Preclassic. It is documented that around this time many Mesoamerican languages adopted loanwords from the Mixe–Zoquean languages, particularly loanwords related to such culturally fundamental concepts as agriculture and religion. This has led some linguists to believe that the carriers of Olmec culture spoke a Mixe–Zoquean language and that words spread from their language into others because of their potential cultural dominance in the Preclassic period, though the relationship between the Olmec and other Preclassic groups is still debated (see Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures). During this time the Oto-Manguean languages diversified and spread into Oaxaca and central Mexico. In the Valley of Oaxaca, the Oto-Manguean Zapotec culture emerges around c. 1000 BCE. The splitting of Proto-Mayan into the modern Mayan languages slowly began at roughly 2000 BCE when the speakers of Huastec moved north into the Mexican Gulf Coast region. Uto-Aztecan languages were still outside of Mesoamerica during the Preclassic, their speakers living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers on the northern rim of the region and co-existing with speakers of Coracholan and Oto-Pamean languages.

====Classic period (200–1000 CE)====
During the Classic period the linguistic situation simultaneously becomes both clearer and more obscure. While the Maya actually left examples of their writing, researchers have been unable to determine the linguistic affiliations of several important Classic civilizations, including Teotihuacan, Xochicalco, Cacaxtla, and El Tajín. During this time it is well established that Mixtec languages were spoken at Tilantongo and Zapotec at Monte Albán (in the Valley of Oaxaca). The linguistic situation of the Maya area is relatively clear – Proto-Yucatec and Proto-Cholan were established in their respective locations in Yucatán and in the Tabasco area. Around 200 CE speakers of the Tzeltalan branch of Proto-Cholan moved south into Chiapas displacing speakers of Zoquean languages. Throughout the southern part of the Maya area and the highlands the elite of the Classic Maya centers spoke a common prestige language based on Cholan, a variant often referred to as Classic Ch&#x27;olti&#x27;an.

An important question that remains to be answered is what language or languages were spoken by the people and rulers of the empire of Teotihuacan. During the first part of the Classic period Teotihuacan achieved dominance over central Mexico and far into the Maya area. Possible candidates for the language of Teotihuacan have been Nahuatl, Totonac or Mixe–Zoque. Terrence Kaufman has argued that Nahuatl is an unlikely candidate because Proto-Nahuan did not enter Mesoamerica until around the time of the fall of Teotihuacan (c. 600 AD), and that Totonac or Mixe–Zoque are likely candidates because many Mesoamerican languages have borrowed from these two languages during the Classic period. Others find Mixe–Zoque an unlikely candidate because no current Mixe–Zoque settlements are found in central Mexico. Around 500–600 CE a new language family entered Mesoamerica when speakers of Proto-Nahuan, a southern Uto-Aztecan language, moved south into central Mexico. Their arrival, which coincides with the decline of Teotihuacan and a period of general turmoil and mass migration in Mesoamerica, has led scientists to speculate that they might have been involved somehow in the fall of the Teotihuacan empire.

What is known is that in the years following Teotihuacan&#x27;s fall Nahuan speakers quickly rose to power in central Mexico and expanded into areas earlier occupied by speakers of Oto-Manguean, Totonacan and Huastec. During this time Oto-Manguean groups of central Mexico such as the Chiapanec, Chorotega and Subtiaba migrated south some of them reaching the southern limits of Mesoamerica in El Salvador and Nicaragua. Also some speakers of Nahuan moved south, some settling on the coast of Oaxaca where their speech became the language Pochutec, and others moving all the way to El Salvador, becoming the ancestors of the speakers of modern Pipil.

====Postclassic period (1000–1521 CE)====
In the Postclassic period Nahuan languages diversified and spread, carried by the culture commonly known as Toltec. In the early Postclassic period feuds between royal lineages in the Yucatán Peninsula caused the forefathers of the Itza&#x27; to move south into the Guatemalan jungle. In northwestern Oaxaca speakers of Mixtec and Chocho-Popolocan languages built successful city-states, such as Teotitlan del Camino, which did not fall under Nahuan subjugation. Speakers of Otomian languages (Otomi, Mazahua and Matlatzinca) were routinely displaced to the edges of the Nahuan states. The Otomi of Xaltocan, for example, were forcibly relocated to Otumba by the early Aztec empire.

As Nahuatl, carried by the Toltec and later the Aztec culture, became a lingua franca throughout Mesoamerica even some Mayan states such as the Kʼicheʼ Kingdom of Qʼumarkaj adopted Nahuatl as a prestige language. In Oaxaca Zapotec and Mixtec peoples expanded their territories displacing speakers of the Tequistlatecan languages slightly. During this time the Purépecha (Tarascans) consolidated their state based at Tzintzuntzan. They were resistant to other states of Mesoamerica and had little contact with the rest of Mesoamerica. Probably as a result of their isolationist policy the Purépecha language is the only language of Mesoamerica to not show any of the traits associated with the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area. In Guerrero the Tlapanecs of Yopitzinco speaking the Oto-Manguean Tlapanec language remained independent of the Aztec empire as did some of the Oaxacan cultures such as the Mixtecs of Tututepec and the Zapotec of Zaachila. In the late postclassic around 1400 CE Zapotecs of Zaachila moved into the Isthmus of Tehuantepec creating a wedge of Zapotec speaking settlements between the former neighbors the Mixe and the Huave who were pushed into their current territories on the edges of the Isthmus.

===Colonial period (1521–1821)===

The Spanish arrival in the new world turned the linguistic situation of Mesoamerica upside down. And from then on the indigenous languages have been subject to varying policies imposed on them by the colonial rule. The first impact came from the decimation of the indigenous population by diseases brought by the Europeans. Within the first two centuries of Spanish rule Mesoamerica experienced a dramatic population decline and it is well documented that several small linguistic groups became completely extinct already during the 16th century. The policies that contributed most to a change in the linguistic situation of Mesoamerica were the policies used for conversion of Indians to Christianity. The first victim of this process was the native writing systems which were banned and prohibited and the existing texts destroyed – the pictorial scripts were seen as an idolatry by the Catholic Church. At first missionaries favoured the teaching of Spanish to their prospect converts but from 1555 the first Mexican Council established the policy that the Indians should be converted in their own languages and that parish priests should know the indigenous language of their parishioners. This called for a massive education of clergymen in native languages and the church undertook this task with great zeal. Institutions of learning such as the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco which was inaugurated in 1536 and which taught both indigenous and classical European languages to both Indians and priests were opened. And missionary grammarians undertook the job of writing grammars for the indigenous languages in order to teach priests. For example, the first grammar of Nahuatl, written by Andrés de Olmos, was published in 1547 – three years before the first grammar of French. During this time some literacy in indigenous languages written in the Latin script began to appear. In 1570 Philip II of Spain decreed that Nahuatl should become the official language of the colonies of New Spain in order to facilitate communication between the Spanish and natives of the colonies. Throughout the colonial period grammars of indigenous languages were composed, but strangely the quality of these were highest in the initial period and declined towards the ends of the 18th century. In practice the friars found that learning all the indigenous languages was impossible and they began to focus on Nahuatl. During this period the linguistic situation of Mesoamerica was relatively stable. However, in 1696 Charles II made a counter decree banning the use of any languages other than Spanish throughout the Spanish Empire. And in 1770 a decree with the avowed purpose of eliminating the indigenous languages was put forth by the Royal Cedula. This put an end to the teaching of and writing in indigenous languages and began a strict policy of hispanization of the Indians. However the fact that today around five million people in Mesoamerica still speak indigenous languages suggest that this policy wasn&#x27;t as effective after all. The most important factor towards the decline of indigenous languages in this period has probably been the social marginalization of the native populations and their languages – and this process has been particularly effective during modern times.

===Modern period (1821–)===
In the modern period what has affected the indigenous languages most has been the pressure of social marginalization put on the indigenous populations by a growing mestizo class, a growing institutionalization of Hispanic society, and, in some cases, instances of violent suppression and mass murder against indigenous groups in a concerted effort as recorded in El Salvador in 1932. Indigenous languages have been seen by the governing classes as a hindrance to building homogeneous nation states and as an impediment to social progress. These viewpoints sparked a renewed interest in the hispanization of indigenous communities and the introduction of compulsory education in Spanish resulted in a great decline of indigenous languages throughout the 20th century. In a number of indigenous communities it has become practice to learn Spanish first and the indigenous language second. Parents have refrained from teaching their children their own language in order not to subject them to the social stigma of speaking an Indian language – and youths have learned their languages only when they came of age and started taking part in the adult society.

Within the last 20 years there has been an overt change in the policies of governments of Mesoamerican countries towards the indigenous languages. There has been official recognition of their right to existence and some kind of governmental support, to the point of recognizing them as national languages. Bilingual (rather than monolingual Spanish) education has been recognized as desirable even if not always actually achieved in practice. In Guatemala the recognition of the indigenous languages as official languages and a valuable part of the country&#x27;s identity came after the Civil War which ended in 1996. In Mexico shifting governments had talked about the value of the country&#x27;s indigenous heritage but it was not until 2003 that the &quot;Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas&quot; established a framework for the conservation, nurturing and development of indigenous languages.

Despite these official changes, old attitudes persist in many spheres, and indigenous languages are not in any practical sense on a par with Spanish. At present the linguistic situation of Mesoamerican languages is most difficult in the Central American countries like Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua where indigenous languages still do not enjoy the rights or privileges now granted them elsewhere, and are still subject to social stigmatization.

==Writing==
Mesoamerica is one of the relatively few places in the world where writing has developed independently throughout history. The Mesoamerican scripts deciphered to date are logosyllabic combining the use of logograms with a syllabary, and they are often called hieroglyphic scripts. Five or six different scripts have been documented in Mesoamerica but archaeological dating methods make it difficult to establish which was earliest and hence the forebear from which the others developed. Candidates for being the first writing system of the Americas are Zapotec writing, the Isthmian or Epi-Olmec script or the scripts of the Izapan culture. The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and hence the most widely known, is the classic Maya script. Post-Classic cultures such as the Aztec and Mixtec cultures do not seem to have developed true writing systems, but instead used semasiographic writing although they did use phonetic principles in their writing by the use of the rebus principle. Aztec name glyphs for example do combine logographic elements with phonetic readings. From the colonial period on there exists an extensive Mesoamerican literature written in the Latin script.

==Literary traditions==
The literature and texts created by indigenous Mesoamericans are the earliest and well known from the Americas for two primary reasons. First, the fact that native populations in Mesoamerica were the first to interact with Europeans assured the documentation and survival of literature samples in intelligible forms. Second, the long tradition of Mesoamerican writing contributed to them readily embracing the Latin script used by the Spanish and resulted in many literary works written in it during the first centuries after the Spanish conquest of Mexico. Some important literary works in Mesoamerican languages are: The mythological narrative of the Popol Vuh and the theatrical dance-drama the Rabinal Achí both written in Classical Kʼicheʼ Maya. The ethnographical work in the Florentine Codex and the songs of the Cantares Mexicanos both written in Classical Nahuatl. The prophetical and historical accounts of the books of Chilam Balam written in the Yucatec Maya language. As well as numerous smaller documents written in other indigenous languages throughout the colonial period. No true literary tradition for Mesoamerican languages of the modern period has yet emerged.

==Mesoamerican Linguistic Area==

Throughout the millennia in which speakers of different Mesoamerican languages were engaged in contact the languages began to change and show similarities with one another. This has resulted in Mesoamerica evolving into a linguistic area of diffusion, a &quot;Sprachbund&quot;, where most languages, even though they have different origins share some important linguistic traits. The traits defining the Mesoamerican sprachbund are few but well established: the languages use relational nouns to express spatial and other relations, they have a base 20 (Vigesimal) numeral system, their syntax is never verb-final and as a consequence of this they don&#x27;t use switch reference, they use a distinct pattern for expressing nominal possession and they share a number of semantic calques]. Some other traits are less defining for the area, but still prevalent such as: the presence of whistled languages, incorporation of bodypart nouns into verbs, the derivation of locatives from bodypart nouns, grammatical indication of inalienable or intimate possession. Terrence Kaufman has worked with documenting the process of this linguistic convergence and he argues that the most probable donor languages of the borrowings into other Mesoamerican languages are the Mixe–Zoquean and Totonacan languages, this supports a theory of either or both of these cultures having a prominent role as a dominating power in early Mesoamerican history.

<text>Melvin Russell Ballard Jr. (October 8, 1928 – November 12, 2023) was an American businessman and religious leader who served as the Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 2018 until his death in 2023. He had been a member of the church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles since 1985. As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, Ballard was accepted by church members as a prophet, seer, and revelator. At the time of his death, he was the third most senior apostle in the church.

==Biography==
Ballard was born in Salt Lake City, Utah to Melvin Russell Ballard and his wife, Geraldine Smith. As a young man, Ballard served as a missionary in England from 1948 to 1950, during which he was a counselor in the mission presidency. He met his wife while they were studying at the University of Utah. Over the following years, Ballard served in multiple positions in the LDS Church, including twice as a bishop. In 1974, Ballard was called as president of the church&#x27;s Canada Toronto Mission. While serving as a mission president in 1976, he was called to the First Quorum of the Seventy; he completed his three-year term as mission president as a member of the seventy. Among other assignments as a seventy, he was the editor of the church&#x27;s magazines from the start of 1980 until the end of 1984. He was a member of the Presidency of the Seventy from 1980 until 1985. As a general authority, Ballard was also president of the church&#x27;s International Mission and the executive director of the church&#x27;s missionary department.

Following the death of apostle Bruce R. McConkie, Ballard was sustained to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on October 6, 1985 and ordained an apostle on October 10, 1985.

Ballard was the grandson of apostles Melvin J. Ballard and Hyrum M. Smith. Through Hyrum M. Smith, Ballard was a descendant of Hyrum Smith, brother of church founder Joseph Smith. Among other assignments as an apostle, Ballard oversaw the church&#x27;s celebration of the Pioneer Sesquicentennial in 1997.

Following the January 2018 death of church president Thomas S. Monson, the church&#x27;s First Presidency was reorganized with Russell M. Nelson as president. Nelson selected Dallin H. Oaks, the next senior apostle and new quorum president, as First Counselor in the First Presidency. As the next senior apostle not in the First Presidency, Ballard became the quorum&#x27;s acting president.

===Death===
In late October 2023, Ballard was briefly hospitalized for respiratory problems. He died less than a month later at his home in Salt Lake City on November 12, 2023, at age 95.

==Business activities==
Professionally, Ballard was involved in several enterprises, including automotive, real estate, and investment businesses. He was the top-selling salesman for his father&#x27;s Nash car dealership when he left it in the early 1950s to pursue other business interests. In 1956, Ballard returned and took over the Ballard Motor Company from his father. During this period, he also served in the United States Army Reserve, resigning his commission as a First Lieutenant in 1957.

During the late 1950s, Ballard was recruited by the Ford Motor Company to become the first Edsel car dealer for Salt Lake City. According to Ballard, after praying for guidance, he had the &quot;clear impression&quot; not to sign the franchise. He did anyway and incurred a huge loss, &quot;without doubt the darkest period&quot; of his business career.

One highlight of Ballard&#x27;s business career was his presidency of the Valley Music Hall in Bountiful, Utah, which offered family entertainment. There Ballard worked with Art Linkletter, Danny Thomas, Bob Cummings, and other Hollywood celebrities who were advisers to the enterprise. Although the music hall failed financially, investors recovered their money when the LDS Church purchased the building.

===Keystone Securities Corporation===
In 1961, Kay Stoker, a business partner of Ballard&#x27;s, created a mining company called Shasta Mineral and Chemical Corporation and filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declaring intent to offer public stock for the company. While processing the request, the SEC recommended that a separate company be created to handle issuance of stock, so Keystone Securities Corporation was established with Ballard as president. In November 1961 the SEC charged Shasta with fraud. Ballard attempted to withdraw Keystone Securities from the issue because he &quot;could not be affiliated with anything that was having this claim of &#x27;fraud&#x27; and &#x27;misleading statements&#x27; associated with it.&quot; The SEC subsequently charged Keystone and Ballard with violating the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933. The investigation centered around &quot;manipulation and fraud.&quot; 

The SEC completed its investigation in 1963 and withdrew its original charge of fraud but charged Keystone and Ballard with &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; fraud in Shasta. Without admitting or denying the charges, Keystone and Ballard settled the case by stipulating that the SEC could find them as having violated the acts through aiding and abetting Shasta. The SEC revoked the broker-dealer registration of Keystone as a result. In 1964 the SEC dropped the charges against Shasta. In a testimony before a Senate subcommittee in 1965, the lawyer for Keystone and Ballard asserted that the SEC charges against Ballard were solely &quot;to determine whether an underwriter can be charged vicariously with any wrongdoing of the issuing company,&quot; even though &quot;Keystone had not participated in the preparation of the registration statement or sold any stock pursuant to the proposed public offering&quot; of Shasta. In 1966, a U.S. district court found the SEC guilty of acting in an arbitrary and capricious manner by announcing their charges against both Shasta and Keystone.

==Family==
On August 28, 1951, Ballard married Barbara Bowen in the Salt Lake Temple; they were the parents of seven children. One of their daughters, Brynn, is married to Peter R. Huntsman, who is the son of late billionaire industrialist Jon Huntsman Sr. and brother of Jon Huntsman Jr., former United States Ambassador to Russia and China and former Governor of Utah.

Barbara Bowen Ballard died on October 1, 2018.

<text>Joseph Bitner Wirthlin (June 11, 1917 – December 1, 2008) was an American businessman, religious leader and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was sustained to the Twelve on October 4, 1986, and ordained an apostle on October 9, 1986, by Thomas S. Monson. He became an apostle following the death of church president Spencer W. Kimball. As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, Wirthlin was accepted by the church membership as a prophet, seer, and revelator.

==Biography==

Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Wirthlin was the son of Madeline Bitner and Joseph L. Wirthlin, who was also a general authority of the LDS Church, serving as Presiding Bishop from 1952 to 1961. Wirthlin was a half-first cousin of Gordon B. Hinckley, who became president of the LDS Church; the two cousins attended the same congregation as children.

As a young man, Wirthlin earned the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. As a standout high school quarterback, Wirthlin was offered a football scholarship at the University of Utah, but deferred it and served as a missionary in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland from 1936 to 1939, returning to Utah just before the outbreak of World War II. Wirthlin played football as a running back for the University of Utah following his mission. Wirthlin&#x27;s career was spent as a prominent business leader in Salt Lake City. He was also president of a trade association in Utah.

Wirthlin served in the LDS Church as bishop of the Bonneville Ward in Salt Lake City from 1955 to 1964. The day he was released as bishop he was called to serve in the stake high council and was set apart by Joseph Fielding Smith. On December 6, 1964, Wirthlin was set apart by LeGrand Richards as second counselor to Russell M. Nelson in the presidency of the Salt Lake Bonneville Stake; Wirthlin served in that capacity until Nelson&#x27;s release in 1971. Wirthlin became a general authority of the church in 1975, when he was called to serve as an Assistant to the Twelve. He was the last individual called to this position before it was discontinued in 1976. In 1984, when the LDS Church first organized areas with area presidencies, Wirthlin was the first president of the Europe Area. The area was headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany and covered all of Europe and Africa. Wirthlin&#x27;s call to the Quorum of the Twelve came shortly after his call to serve in the church&#x27;s Presidency of the Seventy.

Wirthlin married Elisa Young Rogers on May 26, 1941, in the Salt Lake Temple; they had eight children. She died in August 2006 of causes incident to age.

On December 1, 2008, Wirthlin &quot;had gone to bed at his Salt Lake City home, and died peacefully at about 11:30 pm of causes incident to age.&quot; At the time of his death, Wirthlin was the oldest apostle among the ranks of the church. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

Shortly after his death, the University of Utah announced that the Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin Family Scholarship, an endowed scholarship benefiting the Utah football program, would be named in his honor. On January 2, 2009, when the Utes won the Sugar Bowl, all of the Utah players wore a commemorative sticker on their helmets with the initials JBW in his honor.

<doc id="874757" wikidata="Q2892300" url="?curid=874757" title="Bayou Lafourche">
<text>Bayou Lafourche ( ), originally called Chetimachas River or La Fourche des Chetimaches (the fork of the Chitimacha), is a bayou in southeastern Louisiana, United States, that flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The bayou is flanked by Louisiana Highway 1 on the west and Louisiana Highway 308 on the east, and is known as &quot;the longest Main Street in the world.&quot; It flows through parts of Ascension, Assumption, and Lafourche parishes. Today, approximately 300,000 Louisiana residents drink water drawn from the bayou.

==History==
The name Lafourche is from the French for &quot;the fork&quot;, and alludes to the bayou&#x27;s large outflow of Mississippi River water. The first settlements of Acadians in southern Louisiana were near Bayou Lafourche and Bayou des Écores, which led to a close association of the bayou with Cajun culture.

It was formerly a Mississippi River outlet (distributary), but was dammed at Donaldsonville in 1905. The dam cut off nourishment and replenishment of a huge wetland area of central Louisiana. It changed the formerly flowing bayou into a stagnant ditch.

The Bollinger Shipyards, founded by Donald G. Bollinger, was launched on Bayou Lafourche in 1946.

On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Lafourche parish. Dam walls at the end of the bayou were closed to prevent a storm surge of salt water from entering.

On July 27, 2024, a 3-mile stretch of the bayou in Raceland faced an oil spill breach. The leak was caused by a valve failure at a Crescent Midstream crude oil facility and the resulting discharge travelled into the bayou from a storm drain. The spill was contained by parish officials and the community&#x27;s drinking water was not affected.

==Mississippi River reintroduction==

A long-term project to revitalize Bayou Lafourche with an increased flow of fresh water from the Mississippi River and halt the accelerated loss of land down the bayou is currently in progress.

In 2016, Bayou Lafourche was dredged from Donaldsonville to Napoleonville of vegetation and sediment that constricted the surface area of the water. In Lockport, a water gate was constructed on Bayou Lafourche to mitigate the amount of salt water invading the bayou during periods of low tide. In 2021, a weir was removed in Thibodaux, allowing recreational boating passage through the entire bayou.

By 2025, a $96 million pumping station is set to be completed in Donaldsonville, next to the original that was constructed in 1950. The new station will be able to pump three times the amount of fresh water from the Mississippi River than the original and, in turn, return the flow of water throughout the bayou during low tides.

==Crossings==
From north to south, the following roads and railroads cross the bayou (almost all connecting LA 1 to LA 308):
*LA 3089 (Albert Street) in Donaldsonville
*Union Pacific Railroad Livonia Subdivision in Donaldsonville
*Rondinaud Road in Donaldsonville
*LA 943
*LA 998 at Belle Rose

==In popular culture==
The film &quot;Southern Comfort&quot; is set on Bayou Lafourche.

At the end of the novel &quot;Post Office&quot; by Charles Bukowski, protagonist Henry Chinaski quits his job at the Los Angeles post office to &quot;pick up 10 or 20 grand for 3 months trapping at Bayou La Fourche. [...] Muskrats, nutria, mink, otter... coon. All I need is a pirogue.&quot;

In The CW Network&#x27;s supernatural-fantasy series, &quot;The Originals&quot;, the Bayou Lafourche is a major setting and has acted as the home of the Werewolf encampments for decades after the Vampires exiled them from the city of New Orleans.

In the film &quot;Hard Target&quot;, the lead character Chance Boudreaux, played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, is a Cajun from Bayou Lafourche in Southern Louisiana.

<doc id="874766" wikidata="Q830881" url="?curid=874766" title="Notre-Dame school">
<text>The Notre-Dame school or the Notre-Dame school of polyphony refers to the group of composers working at or near the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris from about 1160 to 1250, along with the music they produced.
The only composers whose names have come down to us from this time are Léonin and Pérotin. Both were mentioned by an anonymous English student, known as Anonymous IV, who was either working or studying at Notre-Dame later in the 13th century. In addition to naming the two composers as &quot;the best composers of organum,&quot; and specifying that they compiled the big book of organum known as the &quot;Magnus Liber Organi&quot;, he provides a few tantalizing bits of information on the music and the principles involved in its composition. Pérotin is the first composer of &quot;organum quadruplum&quot;—four-voice polyphony—at least the first composer whose music has survived, since complete survivals of notated music from this time are scarce.

Léonin, Pérotin and the other anonymous composers whose music has survived are representatives of the era of European music history known as the ars antiqua. The motet was first developed during this period out of the clausula, which is one of the most frequently encountered types of composition in the &quot;Magnus Liber Organi&quot;.

While music with notation has survived, in substantial quantity, the interpretation of this music, especially with regard to rhythm, remains controversial. Three music theorists describe the contemporary practice: Johannes de Garlandia, Franco of Cologne, and Anonymous IV. However, they were all writing more than two generations after the music was written, and may have been imposing their current practice, which was quickly evolving, on music which was conceived differently. In much music of the Notre-Dame School the lowest voices sing long note values while the upper voice or voices sing highly ornamented lines, which often use repeating patterns of long and short notes known as the &quot;rhythmic modes&quot;. This marked the beginning of notation capable of showing relative durations of notes within and between parts.

==Notre-Dame motets==
The earliest motets are the Notre-Dame motets, written by composers such as Leonin and Perotin during the 13th century. These motets were polyphonic, with a different text in each voice, and employed the rhythmic modes. An example of a Notre-Dame motet is &quot;Salve, salus hominum/O radians stella/nostrum&quot; by Perotin, composed between 1180 and 1238.

== Contemporary accounts ==
With polyphony, musicians were able to achieve musical feats perceived by many as beautiful, and by others, distasteful. John of Salisbury (1120–1180), philosopher and Bishop of Chartres, who taught at the University of Paris during the years of Léonin but before Pérotin, was one of the latter. He attended many services at the Notre-Dame Choir School. In his &quot;Policraticus&quot; he offers a first-hand description of what was happening to music in the High Middle Ages, writing:

<text>John Brown Gordon () was an American politician, Confederate States Army general, attorney, slaveowner and planter. &quot;One of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s most trusted generals&quot; by the end of the Civil War according to historian Ed Bearss, he strongly opposed Reconstruction era. A member of the Democratic Party, he was twice elected by the Georgia state legislature as a US Senator (as was the practice at the time), serving from 1873 to 1880, and again from 1891 to 1897. He served two terms as the 53rd Governor of Georgia from 1886 to 1890.

==Early life==
John Brown Gordon was of Scots descent and was born on the farm of his parents Zachariah Gordon and his wife in Upson County, Georgia; he was the fourth of twelve children. Many Gordon family members had fought in the Revolutionary War. His family moved to Walker County, Georgia by 1840, where his father was recorded in the US census that year as owning a plantation with 18 slaves.

Gordon was a student at the University of Georgia, where he was a member of the Mystical 7 Society. He left before graduating to &quot;read the law&quot; in Atlanta, where he passed the bar examination.

Gordon and his father, Zachariah, invested in a series of coal mines in Tennessee and Georgia. He also practiced law. In 1854 Gordon married Rebecca &quot;Fanny&quot; Haralson, daughter of Hugh Anderson Haralson and his wife. They had a long marriage and six children.

In 1860, Gordon owned one slave, a 14-year-old girl. His father owned four slaves in that same census year.

==American Civil War==
Although lacking military education or experience, Gordon was elected captain of a company of the 6th Alabama Infantry Regiment. He was present at First Manassas, but did not see any action. During a reorganization of the Confederate army in May 1862, the regiment&#x27;s original colonel, John Siebels, resigned and Gordon was elected the new colonel. Gordon&#x27;s first combat experience happened a few weeks later at Seven Pines, when his regiment was in the thick of the fighting. During the battle, Gordon witnessed his younger brother, Augustus Gordon, lying among the Confederate casualties, bleeding profusely with what appeared to be a fatal wound to the lungs. Augustus survived, but was killed a year later at the Battle of Chancellorsville. Toward the end of the two-day Battle of Seven Pines, Gordon took over as brigade commander from Brig. Gen. Robert Rodes when Rodes was wounded. Shortly after the battle, the 26th Alabama was transferred to Rodes&#x27;s Brigade as part of an army reorganization. Its commander, Col. Edward O&#x27;Neal, outranked Gordon and thus took command of the brigade until Rodes resumed command just before the Seven Days Battles. Gordon was again hotly engaged at Gaines&#x27; Mill, and he was wounded in the eyes during the assault on Malvern Hill. On June 29, Rodes, still suffering from the effects of his wound, took a leave of absence; O&#x27;Neal commanded the brigade once again. During the Northern Virginia Campaign, Gordon and his regiment were kept in the Richmond area.

Assigned by General Lee to hold the vital sunken road, or &quot;Bloody Lane&quot;, during the Battle of Sharpsburg, Gordon suffered new wounds. First, a Minié ball passed through his calf. A second ball hit him higher in the same leg. A third ball went through his left arm. Gordon continued to lead his men, despite the fact that the muscles and tendons in his arm were mangled and a small artery was severed. A fourth ball hit him in his shoulder. Ignoring pleas that he go to the rear, Gordon remained on the front lines. He was finally stopped by a ball that hit him in the face, passing through his left cheek and out his jaw. He fell with his face in his cap, and might have drowned in his own blood if it had not drained out through a bullet hole in the cap. A Confederate surgeon thought that he would not survive. After being returned to Virginia, Gordon was nursed back to health by his wife.

Impressed with Gordon&#x27;s performance, Lee requested a promotion to brigadier general on November 1, 1862; however, this was not confirmed by the Confederate States Congress due to his being wounded. After months of recuperation, Gordon returned to service, receiving the command of a brigade of Georgians in Jubal A. Early&#x27;s division. When he returned to duty, Lee requested a promotion again, which was approved by the Confederate Congress, ranking from May 7, 1863.

During the Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania, Gordon&#x27;s brigade occupied Wrightsville on the Susquehanna River, the farthest east in Pennsylvania that any organized Confederate troops would reach. Union militia under Col. Jacob G. Frick burned a mile-and-a-quarter-long covered wooden bridge to prevent Gordon from crossing the river, and the fire soon spread to parts of Wrightsville. Gordon&#x27;s troops formed a bucket brigade and managed to prevent further destruction to the town.

At the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1, Gordon&#x27;s brigade and other units drove the Union XI Corps from Barlow&#x27;s Knoll. There, he aided the opposing division commander, Francis Barlow, who was wounded. This incident led to a story about the two officers meeting later in Washington, D.C., Gordon unaware that Barlow had survived the battle. The story was told by Barlow and Gordon and published in newspapers and in Gordon&#x27;s postwar memoir.

Barlow returned to service in April 1865 and pursued Gordon and his troops during the Battle of High Bridge.

At the start of the 1864 Overland Campaign, in the Battle of the Wilderness, Gordon proposed a flanking attack against the Union right that might have had a decisive effect on the battle had Gen. Early allowed him freedom to launch it before late in the day. Gordon was an aggressive general; in a letter to Confederate President Jefferson Davis, Gen. Robert E. Lee said Gordon was one of his best brigadiers, &quot;characterized by splendid audacity&quot;. On May 8, 1864, Gordon was given command of Early&#x27;s division in Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell&#x27;s (later Early&#x27;s) corps, being promoted to major general on May 14. Gordon&#x27;s success in turning back the massive Union assault in the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House (the Bloody Angle) prevented a Confederate rout. His division was held in reserve at the Battle of North Anna and was positioned in the Magnolia Swamp, north of where the major fighting occurred at the Battle of Cold Harbor.
Gordon left with Early for the Valley Campaigns of 1864, participating in the Battle of Lynchburg and in Early&#x27;s Invasion of Maryland at the Battle of Monocacy before being wounded August 25, 1864, at Shepherdstown, West Virginia after they returned across the Potomac. After having a wound over his right eye dressed, Gordon returned to the battle. Confederate cartographer Jedediah Hotchkiss&#x27;s official report of the incident stated, &quot;Quite a lively skirmish ensued, in which Gordon was wounded in the head, but he gallantly dashed on, the blood streaming over him.&quot;

At the Third Battle of Winchester, Gordon&#x27;s wife, Fanny, accompanying her husband on the campaign as general&#x27;s wives sometimes did, rushed out into the street to urge Gordon&#x27;s retreating troops to go back and face the enemy. Gordon was horrified to find her in the street with shells and balls flying about her. Gordon continued to lead a division in Early&#x27;s Army of the Valley, fighting at Fisher&#x27;s Hill and Cedar Creek, where he led an overnight flanking maneuver around the northern base of Massanutten Mountain, followed by an early morning assault that he had devised while previously surveying the Union position from Signal Knob. The assault nearly crushed the Federal line at the Belle Grove Plantation before a &quot;fatal halt&quot; turned the tide of battle and doomed Gordon&#x27;s successes made earlier in the day.

Returning to Lee&#x27;s army around Richmond after Early&#x27;s defeat at the Cedar Creek, Gordon led the Second Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia until the end of the war. In this role, he defended the line in the Siege of Petersburg and commanded the attack on Fort Stedman on March 25, 1865. There he was wounded again, in the leg.

In April 1865, he was pursued by Francis Barlow, who had returned to service just days before, during the Battle of High Bridge in Virginia. At Appomattox Court House, Gordon led his men in the last charge of the Army of Northern Virginia, capturing the entrenchments and several pieces of artillery in his front just before the surrender.

On April 9, 1865, Gordon&#x27;s cavalry unit drove a brigade of Union infantry from a high ridge near Appomattox; Gordon looked around and realized that Lee`s embattled army was surrounded on three sides by masses of Union infantry. When Lee got word of the situation, he knew that escape was impossible and made up his mind to surrender to Grant that same day. On April 12, Gordon&#x27;s Confederate troops officially surrendered to Bvt. Maj. Gen. Joshua Chamberlain, acting for Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Chamberlain recorded this event in detail:

In his book &quot;Hymns of the Republic: The Story of the Final Year of the American Civil War&quot;, S. C. Gwynne states that this account is &quot;one of the most cherished of the bogus Appomattox stories ... [but] ... there is no convincing evidence that it ever happened ... [N]one of the thirty thousand other people who saw the surrender noted any such event&quot;. According to Gwynne, Chamberlain was, in his later years, &quot;one of the great embellishers of the war&quot;.

[Chamberlain&#x27;s] memoirs ... often reflect[ed] the world as he wanted it to be instead of the way it was. For one thing, he did not command the troops at the ceremony, as he claimed, and thus couldn&#x27;t order the men to salute. His story, moreover, changed significantly over the years. ... Its staying power was mostly rooted in the fact that Gordon never refuted it. The rebel general apparently liked it, and it reflected well on him, as the time went by Gordon added his own liberal embellishments, including the suggestion that Lee himself had led the Army through town. The two generals would clearly have preferred this distinctly Walter Scott-like sequence, described in countless books and memoirs, to the decidedly less romantic one that actually took place.

Though Gordon often claimed he was promoted to lieutenant general, there is no official record of this.

==Postbellum career==
As the government of the State of Georgia was being reconstituted for readmission to the Union, Gordon ran as the Democratic candidate for governor in 1868, but was defeated by Republican Rufus Bullock in a vote of 83,527 to 76,356. He was a presidential elector in 1868.

Gordon was elected by the state legislature to the US Senate in 1873, as Democrats regained their power in Georgia. In 1879, he became the first ex-Confederate elected to preside over the Senate. He was a strong supporter of the &quot;New South&quot; and industrialization, and he was a part of the Bourbon Triumvirate.

Gordon resigned as senator on May 19, 1880. After his unexpected resignation, Governor Alfred H. Colquitt quickly appointed Joseph E. Brown to succeed Gordon. There were allegations of corruption when it was discovered Gordon resigned to promote a venture for the Georgia Pacific Railway.

He was elected Governor of Georgia in 1886 and served the two-year term. He later returned to national politics, elected by the state legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1890 and serving from 1891 to 1897.

Gordon published memoir of his Civil War service entitled &quot;Reminiscences of the Civil War&quot;.

He engaged in a series of popular speaking engagements throughout the country. These lectures, entitled &quot;The Last Days of the Confederacy&quot;, were very well received in both the North and South. He tended to focus on anecdotes and incidents that humanized soldiers from both sides. This was a period of reconciliation among the soldiers of the North and the South.

General Gordon was the first Commander-in-Chief of the United Confederate Veterans when the group was organized in 1890. He held this position until his death. He died at the age of 71 while visiting his son in Miami, Florida. His body was returned to Georgia, where he was buried in Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta. Upwards of 75,000 people viewed and took part in the memorial ceremonies.

==Racial views==
Gordon, a former planter, slaveholder and Confederate general, held white supremacist views on race, which he retained for his lifetime. He opposed Republican efforts at Reconstruction and endorsed measures to preserve white-dominated society, including restrictions on freedmen and the use of violence against them.

Author Ralph Lowell Eckert concluded that Gordon was a member of the postwar Ku Klux Klan based on the former general&#x27;s evasive answers during an 1871 hearing. During congressional testimony in 1871, Gordon denied any involvement with the Klan but acknowledged that he was associated with a secret &quot;peace police&quot; organization, whose sole purpose was the &quot;preservation of peace.&quot; Gordon was thought to be the titular head of the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia, but the organization was so secretive that his role was never proven conclusively. In the midst of Reconstruction, a variety of organizations cropped up in the South, which existed to defy reconstruction (i.e. the Ku Klux Klan, White League, and Red Shirts). As many of these groups feared arrest while the states were occupied by Federal troops, they generally operated in secret.

In 1866, Gordon made substantial contributions in the form of money and materials to help build churches and schools for blacks in Brunswick, Georgia. He advised them to:

educate themselves and their children, to be industrious, save money and purchase houses, and thus make themselves respectable as property holders, and intelligent people. With submission to the laws, industry and economy, with union among yourselves, and courtesy and confidence toward the whites, you will reach these ends, and constitute an important element in the community.

Gordon hoped to ease the tensions between the blacks and whites in coastal Georgia, which had a long history of enslaved African-American workers on plantations.

Gordon seems to have been most concerned with incidents such as black Federal troops mistreating white Georgians, or alleged activities by members of the Union League and Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau who were reported to have been inciting newly freed slaves to use violence against whites. Historian Ralph Eckert notes that Gordon was willing to support blacks as long as they submitted to being in a subordinate social and political position. Eckert says that Gordon clearly did not believe in racial equality. He notes an 1868 speech in Charleston, South Carolina (a black majority city), in which Gordon said to the blacks in the audience, &quot;If you are disposed to live in peace with the white people, they extend to you the hand of friendship&quot; but &quot;if you attempt to inaugurate a war of races you will be exterminated. The Saxon race was never created by Almighty God to be ruled by the African.&quot;

<text>Dramatis Personæ is a poetry collection by Robert Browning. It was published in 1864.

== Background ==
Browning wrote the collection in London, where he had returned with his son after the death of his wife, Elizabeth Barrett Browning. It was his first publication after a nine-year hiatus. During this time, Browning&#x27;s reputation was fluctuating, and &quot;Dramatis Personae&quot; along with &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot;, which is widely considered his greatest work, were enough to begin a critical re-evaluation of the writer.

== The poems ==
The poems in &quot;Dramatis Personae&quot; are dramatic, with a wide range of narrators. The narrator is usually in a situation that reveals to the reader some aspect of his personality. Instead of speeches that are intended for others&#x27; ears, most are soliloquies. They are generally darker than the poems found in &quot;Men and Women&quot;, his previous collection, and along with &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot; these poems embody a turning point in Browning&#x27;s style. Browning&#x27;s poetry after this point most notably touches on religion and marital distress, two potent issues of his time period.

This new style was appreciated, as &quot;Dramatis Personae&quot; sold enough copies for a second edition to be published, which was a first in Browning&#x27;s career. However, though he gained respect, Browning didn&#x27;t have much commercial success as a poet. The sales of this work and most notably his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; were helped by public sympathy after the death of his wife.

<doc id="874771" wikidata="Q15278750" url="?curid=874771" title="Southeastern University (Washington, D.C.)">
<text>Southeastern University was a private, non-profit undergraduate and graduate institution of higher education located in southwestern Washington, D.C. The university lost its accreditation from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education on August 31, 2009. The Commission reported that the college lacked rigor and was losing faculty, enrollment, and financial stability. The 130-year-old school ceased offering classes after an extended summer session in 2009. The closure was very likely linked to the Great Recession.

Southeastern University was established by YMCA and chartered by an Act of Congress in 1879. It had degree programs in Criminal Justice, Child Development, Public Administration, Business Management, Accounting, Finance, Liberal Studies, Computer Science, and Allied Health, a program initiated in 2006 at Greater Southeast Community Hospital. There were also certificate programs in entrepreneurship, property management, real estate, Web development, and others. It was a member of the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area but lost this affiliation after the Fall 2009 semester.

Through the spring of 2009, Southeastern University had a total enrollment of about 870 students, with 222 of those students pursuing postgraduate degrees. About 77% were locally based, and a majority (60%) were female, but there was also a significant international enrollment. International enrollment had been in decline after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, when the student population shifted from international students to primarily low-income District residents. The university employed approximately 140 faculty and staff before the university was notified of its loss of accreditation.

==History==
Southeastern began as a series of classes offered by YMCA of the District of Columbia in 1879. The Washington School of accountancy was added in 1907. In 1923, the university incorporated under the authority of the District of Columbia as &quot;Southeastern University of YMCA of the District of Columbia&quot;. An August 19, 1937 federal charter from Congress renamed the institution &quot;Southeastern University&quot;. The university afterward added other colleges. In 1977, the university received accreditation from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. During the 1980s, two university officials were fired due to misappropriation of funds, and SEU&#x27;s student loan default rate reached 42% by 1987. In 1989, the federal government temporarily cut off the university&#x27;s loan funds. Enrollment declined from 1800 to 500 in the early 1990s.

==Closure==
Three months before the university was notified it would lose accreditation, Southeastern received $1.5 million from the District of Columbia to fund improvements intended to prevent the school&#x27;s loss of accreditation. Efforts by the D.C. government to recover the funding after the school lost accreditation were unsuccessful.

Elaine Ryan replaced Charlene Drew Jarvis as university president on March 31, 2009, after Jarvis had been president for 13 years. Prior to losing accreditation, the university was negotiating a merger with Graduate School USA (formerly Graduate School, USDA), also based in Washington, D.C.

In May 2014, the Shakespeare Theatre Company announced plans to redevelop the former site of Southeastern University at 501 Eye Street SW into an actors&#x27; campus. These plans fell through. The campus building was demolished and the space became a vacant lot.

<doc id="874782" wikidata="Q3180032" url="?curid=874782" title="Joe Comuzzi">
<text>Joseph Robert Comuzzi, (April 5, 1933 – December 31, 2021) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as a cabinet minister under Prime Minister Paul Martin. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1988 to 2008, representing Thunder Bay—Nipigon which was renamed Thunder Bay—Superior North in 2000.

==Early life==
Comuzzi was born in Fort William, Ontario, on April 5, 1933. He studied at the University of Windsor, graduating in 1954 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Twelve years later, he received the University of Windsor Alumni Award of Merit, the Alumni Association&#x27;s most prestigious award. After working in the Thunder Bay business community for 24 years, he went back to his alma mater and obtained a law degree in 1980. He also served as a school representative on the Lakehead Board of Education.

==Political career==
Comuzzi entered federal politics in 1988, running in the election that year for the Liberal Party of Canada. He was elected to the House of Commons, representing the riding of Thunder Bay—Superior North. As an opposition MP, he served as chair of the Standing Committee on Transport and a member of the Standing Joint Committee on the Scrutiny of Regulations. During his tenure as an MP, Comuzzi advocated for key issues specific to his riding: Great Lakes transportation and water quality, the pulp and paper industry, the softwood lumber dispute, grain transportation, mining, small business, health care and the local economy. He also served in various leadership capacities pertaining to transportation and industry. His views on gun registry spending and official bilingualism were at odds with the Liberals. His call to review the latter policy on its 25th anniversary in 1998 drew the ire of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien.

Comuzzi was appointed Minister of State responsible for the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario (FedNor) on December 12, 2003. While Minister of State, he was forced to apologize for remarks about Quebecers when, in commenting on the Sponsorship scandal, he stated, &quot;I guess that&#x27;s how they do politics there.&quot; He served as co-chair of the Canada–United States Inter-Parliamentary Group from December 2003 until the following July, and again from February 2005 to June 2006.

An opponent of same-sex marriage in Canada, Comuzzi resigned from cabinet on June 28, 2005, so that he could be free of a two-line party whip and oppose Bill C-38. He was eventually expelled from the Liberal caucus for pledging to support the Conservative budget on March 21, 2007. He stated that his support for the budget was due to &quot;a single issue that&#x27;s of absolute critical importance to all the people in Thunder Bay and northwestern Ontario, and that&#x27;s the cancer research centre&quot;. He subsequently joined the Conservative Party on June 26 that year. On September 5, 2008, Comuzzi announced that he would retire from politics and not seek another term in the following federal election.

==Personal life==
Comuzzi was married to Janet M. Casgrain until her death in 2014. Together, they had four children. He died on December 31, 2021, at the age of 88.

<text>The Macintyre River, a perennial river that forms part of the Border Rivers group, is part of the Barwon catchment of the Murray-Darling basin, located in the Northern Tablelands and North West Slopes regions of New South Wales, and the Southern Downs region of Queensland, Australia.

Part of the course of the river marks the border between Queensland and New South Wales.

==Course and features==
The Macintyre River rises on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range, west of Guyra and south of Glen Innes, and flows generally northwest and west, joined by twenty-two tributaries, including the Severn River (New South Wales) and Dumaresq River, before reaching its confluence with the Weir River to form the Barwon River, west of Goondiwindi. In 1914, the current Goondiwindi Border Bridge was opened. It replaced a timber structure which was built in 1878. The Macintyre River descends over its course; passing near the towns of Glen Innes, Inverell, Ashford, Yetman, and Boggabilla. The flow of the river is impounded by Boggabilla Weir.

The Macintyre River, together with Pike Creek, the Mole, Beardy, Severn (Queensland), Severn (New South Wales), and Dumaresq rivers, is part of the Border Rivers group. It was originally named the Dumaresq River by Allan Cunningham. The name &quot;Macintyre&quot; was given by Cunningham to what is now known as the Dumaresq River. Peter Macintyre was a pastoralist and land owner of Segenhoe Station in the Hunter River district.

===Flooding===
The Macintyre River is often affected by floods and the town of Goondiwindi is protected by levee banks that can cope with a water level rise of nearly . During the 2010–2011 Queensland floods the river peaked at .

Previous peaks have occurred during 1996, at and during 1976.

<text>Times Internet is an Indian multinational technology company, headquartered in Gurgaon, which owns, operates and invests in various internet-led products, services and technology. It is the digital arm of The Times Group, the largest media conglomerate in India. Times Internet currently owns and operates digital products across news, entertainment and classifieds.

Through its venture capital arm TVentures, Times Internet has invested in over 50 start-ups in the technology space such as logistics provider Delhivery, bus aggregating platform Shuttl, ed-tech platform Byju&#x27;s, and gaming platform MPL, among others.

== History ==

=== 1999–2011: Initial years ===

In its initial years, Times Internet primarily focused on digital media—handling the online versions of The Times Group which is owned by Sahu Jain family. Some major print publications includes &quot;The Times of India&quot;, &quot;The Economic Times&quot;, &quot;Maharashtra Times&quot; and &quot;Navbharat Times&quot;.

Times Internet ventured into multiple new categories with mixed success. It entered social networking and e-commerce with Indiatimes but was unable to scale the business. The company achieved success with MagicBricks, an online real estate platform launched in 2006 and iDiva, a women&#x27;s lifestyle portal in 2009.

=== 2012–2019: Investments ===

Times Internet made a series of acquisitions—buying majority stakes in MensXP in 2012, Cricbuzz, Coupondunia and Dineout in 2014, Taskbucks in 2015, &#x27;The Viral Shots&#x27; and WillowTV in 2016. In 2016, it also forged a strategic alliance with Haptik, an AI-enabled chatbot service. The company launched its startup accelerator, TLabs in 2012 through which it invested in upcoming digital startups like Delhivery, Pratilipi etc.

Times Internet launched new digital products—Happy Trips in 2014, ET Money and NewsPoint in 2015. In 2015, Times Internet launched &quot;Samayam&quot;, a website that provides news in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam languages. In association with HDFC Bank, it launched &#x27;Times Points HDFC Bank Debit Card&#x27;, an exclusive co-branded debit card in 2016. It also ventured into video streaming with Box TV Limited in 2012 but shut it down in 2016.

In 2016, Times Internet built Colombia, an ad-tech network.

Times Internet launched ET Insure in February 2017, BrainBaazi in February 2018, and ET Prime in April 2018. It acquired &#x27;House of God&#x27; in December 2017 and partnered with Tencent to invest $115 million in Gaana in February 2018.

On 28 June 2018, Times Internet acquired MX Player, the world&#x27;s largest video player for $140 million. On 20 February 2019, Times Internet re-launched MX Player as a platform streaming movies, TV and web shows.

On 24 April 2019, Times Internet participated as a lead investor in $35.5 million (Rs 2.50 billion) Series-A funding round of Mobile Premier League (MPL).

=== 2020–present: Divestments ===
In 2022, Times Internet sold its short video app MX Takatak to ShareChat for around $700 million in a cash-and-stock transaction. This was followed by the sale of table reservation platform Dineout to Swiggy in an all-stock deal valued at $120 million. Later that year, it sold MensXP, iDiva and Hypp to e-commerce rollup company Mensa Brands for an undisclosed amount.

In 2023, after failing to find a buyer, the music streaming service Gaana was consolidated with another Times Group company Entertainment Network India Limited (ENIL) for a consideration of 25 lakh.

In 2024, Times Internet sold MX Player to Amazon for around $100 million and ET Money to 360 One WAM for 366 crore in stock swap and cash.

<doc id="874812" wikidata="Q52353" url="?curid=874812" title="Benzyl alcohol">
<text>Benzyl alcohol (also known as α-[[cresol]]) is an aromatic alcohol with the formula C6H5CH2OH. The benzyl group is often abbreviated &quot;Bn&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;Bz&quot; which is used for benzoyl), thus benzyl alcohol is denoted as BnOH. Benzyl alcohol is a colorless liquid with a mild pleasant aromatic odor. It is useful as a solvent for its polarity, low toxicity, and low vapor pressure. Benzyl alcohol has moderate solubility in water (4 g/100 mL) and is miscible in alcohols and diethyl ether. The anion produced by deprotonation of the alcohol group is known as benzylate or benzyloxide.

== Natural occurrences ==
Benzyl alcohol is produced naturally by many plants and is commonly found in fruits and teas. It is also found in a variety of essential oils including jasmine, hyacinth and ylang-ylang. It is also found in castoreum from the castor sacs of beavers. Benzyl esters also occur naturally.

== Preparation ==
Benzyl alcohol is produced industrially from toluene via benzyl chloride, which is hydrolyzed:
: C6H5CH2Cl + H2O → C6H5CH2OH + HCl
Another route entails hydrogenation of benzaldehyde, a by-product of the oxidation of toluene to benzoic acid.

For laboratory use, Grignard reaction of phenylmagnesium bromide (C6H5MgBr) with formaldehyde and the Cannizzaro reaction of benzaldehyde also give benzyl alcohol. The latter also gives benzoic acid, an example of an organic disproportionation reaction.

== Reactions ==
Like most alcohols, it reacts with carboxylic acids to form esters. In organic synthesis, benzyl esters are popular protecting groups because they can be removed by mild hydrogenolysis.

Benzyl alcohol reacts with acrylonitrile to give &quot;N&quot;-benzylacrylamide. This is an example of a Ritter reaction:

:C6H5CH2OH + NCCHCH2 → C6H5CH2N(H)C(O)CHCH2

== Applications ==
Benzyl alcohol is used as a general solvent for inks, waxes, shellacs, paints, lacquers, and epoxy resin coatings. Thus it can be used in paint strippers, especially when combined with compatible viscosity enhancers to encourage the mixture to cling to painted surfaces.

It is a precursor to a variety of esters and ethers, used in the soap, perfume, and flavor industries. E.g. benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, benzyl cinnamate, dibenzyl ether, benzyl butyl phthalate.

It can be used as a local anesthetic, especially with epinephrine.

As a dye solvent, it enhances the process of dying wool, nylon, and leather.

=== Use in health care ===
Benzyl alcohol is used as a bacteriostatic preservative at low concentration in intravenous medications, cosmetics, and topical drugs. 

Benzyl alcohol, sold under the brand name Ulesfia, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009, as a 5% solution for the treatment of head lice in people 6 months of age and older. It affects the louse&#x27;s spiracles, preventing them from closing. These then become clogged with water or mineral oil or other matter and cause the insect to die from asphyxiation.

Benzyl alcohol is used effectively for treating lice infestations as the active ingredient in lotion shampoo with 5% benzyl alcohol.

Benzyl alcohol is an ingredient used in the manufacture of soaps, topical creams, skin lotions, shampoos, and facial cleansers and is popular due to its anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. It is a common ingredient in a variety of household products. 

== Safety ==
Sensitization to benzyl alcohol occurs very rarely, mainly in patients with stasis dermatitis.

Benzyl alcohol is not considered to be a carcinogen, and no data are available regarding teratogenic or reproductive effects.

Benzyl alcohol has low acute toxicity with an of 1.2 g/kg in rats. It oxidizes rapidly in healthy individuals to benzoic acid, conjugated with glycine in the liver, and excreted as hippuric acid. Very high concentrations can result in toxic effects including respiratory failure, vasodilation, hypotension, convulsions, and paralysis.

Benzyl alcohol is toxic to neonates and is associated with the gasping syndrome.

<text>Susaye Greene (born September 13, 1948) is an American singer and songwriter. She was the last official member to join the Motown girl group The Supremes, remaining in the group during its final year of existence from 1976 to 1977. She is a successful songwriter as well, having written hit records for Michael Jackson, Deniece Williams, and many others.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born in Houston, Texas, Greene began her professional career at age 12. As a teenager, she moved to New York City where she attended Professional Children School, graduating in 1966 and later from the New York City High School of Performing Arts, and appeared in various commercials. Prior to joining The Supremes, Greene sang with Ray Charles&#x27; Raelettes and Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Wonderlove, which paired her with Deniece Williams and Shirley Brewer. In 1973 she sang lead as a guest vocalist on New Birth&#x27;s hit &quot;Until It&#x27;s Time for You to Go&quot; (a cover of Buffy Sainte-Marie&#x27;s song). In 1975 she co-wrote &quot;Free&quot;, Williams&#x27; breakthrough single.

===The Supremes===
Greene was a member of The Supremes from February 1976 to June 1977 (replacing Cindy Birdsong), and performed on their last two albums, &quot;High Energy&quot; and &quot;Mary, Scherrie &amp; Susaye&quot;. Working alongside original member Mary Wilson and Scherrie Payne, Susaye quickly found her niche in the group and amongst the group&#x27;s legions of fans. Susaye took lead on &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother,&quot; in the group&#x27;s live shows, which never failed to garner a standing ovation, and recorded &quot;High Energy&quot;, the title song from the &quot;High Energy&quot; album. On June 12, 1977, the Supremes performed their farewell concert at the Drury Lane Theater in London and disbanded.

===After The Supremes===
In 1979, two years after The Supremes disbanded, Greene recorded a duet album with Payne entitled &quot;Partners&quot; under the name &quot;Scherrie &amp; Susaye&quot;. She also hosted her own cable television show, &quot;Hollywood Hot&quot;, and continued writing for various artists. One of her most noteworthy compositions was the track &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;, co-written with Stevie Wonder for Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Off the Wall&quot;.

While touring England in 1984 with Wonder, Greene met her present husband in London and relocated there. In 1986, she sang lead on jazz saxophonist Courtney Pine&#x27;s single &quot;Children of the Ghetto&quot;. She signed with Ian Levine&#x27;s Motorcity label, based in the United Kingdom, in 1989. She released two solo singles on Motorcity – &quot;Stop, I Need You Now&quot; in 1990, and her own version of &quot;Free&quot; in 1991. She also recorded the duet &quot;It&#x27;s Impossible&quot; with Billy Eckstine. An unreleased demo recording of &quot;Don&#x27;t Pity The Fool&quot; also exists, although no vocals were added. On July 5, 2014, Greene, along with Payne performed at the Sheraton in Los Angeles a concert program based on their album &quot;Partners&quot; which was released by Motown in 1979. They were featured in the magazine Daeida, with a photo shoot. The article chronicled career highlights with the Supremes and separately and the re-release of their &quot;Partners&quot; album on CD.

In October 2017, Greene replaced Lynda Laurence in the Former Ladies of the Supremes alongside Payne and Joyce Vincent Wilson. 

On June 14, 2024, Payne reported that Greene had departed the group to spend time on her &quot;entrepreneurial endeavors&quot;, and Laurence would be returning to the group.

===Solo albums===
Around the turn of the new millennium, Greene moved back to the United States, and in 2002, she finally released her first solo album, &quot;No Fear Here&quot;. Two singles and a video were released to critical acclaim. Greene penned most of the album herself. Susaye Greene released her second solo album, &quot;Brave New Shoes&quot;, in 2005.

<doc id="874825" wikidata="Q78624" url="?curid=874825" title="Ferdinand Stoliczka">
<text>Ferdinand Stoliczka (Czech written Stolička, 7 June 1838 – 19 June 1874) was a Moravian palaeontologist who worked in India on paleontology, geology and various aspects of zoology, including ornithology, malacology, and herpetology. He died of high altitude sickness in Murgo during an expedition across the Himalayas.

==Early life==
Stoliczka was born at the lodge &quot;Zámeček&quot; near Kroměříž in Moravia. Stoliczka, whose father was a forester who took care of the estate of the Archbishop of Olomouc, studied at a German Secondary school in Kroměříž. Although Stoliczka published 79 articles from 1859 to 1875, he never wrote anything in Czech. It is believed that he spoke German at home. In his Calcutta years he was an important figure in the German-speaking community there.

Stoliczka studied geology and palaeontology at Prague and the University of Vienna under Professor Eduard Suess and Dr Rudolf Hoernes. He graduated with a Ph D from the University of Tübingen on 14 November 1861. His early works were studies on some freshwater mollusca from the Cretaceous rocks of the north-eastern Alps about which he wrote to the Vienna Academy in 1859. His scientific career proper started in the Austrian Geological Survey, which he joined in 1861, and his first papers there were based on work in the Alps and Hungary.

==Career in India==

In 1862 Stoliczka joined the Geological Survey of India (GSI) under the British Government in India after being recruited by Dr Thomas Oldham (1816–1878). In Calcutta he was assigned the job of documenting the Cretaceous fossils of southern India and published them in the &quot;Palaeontologia indica&quot;, along with William Thomas Blanford. By May 1873 this work was completed with four volumes totalling nearly 1500 quarto size pages with 178 plates. Among these works was the osteological description of &quot;Oxyglossus pusillus&quot;, a fossil frog from the Deccan Traps of Bombay.

He studied the geology of the western Himalayas and Tibet, and published numerous papers on many subjects including Indian zoology. He was also briefly (in 1868) the joint curator of the Indian Museum and also the Natural History Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. He was involved in editing the Society&#x27;s journal.

==Expeditions==
He visited Burma, Malaya and Singapore, and made two trips to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the Rann of Kutch. His first Himalayan trip was in 1864 with F. R. Mallet of the GSI. In 1865 he visited again with an artist friend and a dog to the Ladakh Valley. He visited Kutch in 1871–1872 but noted that his geology work kept him from making many observations. He noted wild cheetahs from the region and also what is now Stoliczka&#x27;s bushchat. In 1873 he joined an expedition organized by Hume along with Valentine Ball to the Andaman and Nicobar islands.

==Last expedition==

His third and last expedition was the most important expedition (1873–1874) during the height of the &quot;Great Game&quot;, the rivalry between the Russian and British empires. Eastern Turkestan (Kashgaria) was a buffer state of prime importance. The British launched an official diplomatic enterprise—the Second Yarkand Mission led by Thomas Douglas Forsyth and to Yakub Beg, the ruler of Chinese Turkestan. The mission included 350 support staff and 550 animals. The expedition also needed 6476 porters and 1621 horses and it is said that the Ladakh economy took four years to recover from the losses incurred. The seven sahibs on the mission, in addition to Forsyth and Stoliczka, were Thomas E. Gordon, John Biddulph, Henry Bellew, Henry Trotter, and R. A. Champman.

The mission set out from Rawalpindi to Leh &quot;via&quot; Murree. The mission travelled past the Pangong Lake, Changchenmo and Karakash Valley onto Shahidulla and finally to Yarkand. They reached Kashgar in December 1873. On 17 March 1874 they began the return journey. They were to visit the Pamir and Afghanistan areas but could not do so due to the political situation and returned to India via Ladakh. On 16 June 1874 he had severe headaches as they crossed the Karakoram pass (5580 m). That night, he wrote...
:&quot;...upon this followed massive dolomitic limestone and this was overlain with blue shales. I must have a ramble in these limestones tomorrow.&quot;

Captain Trotter reported that on the 18th &quot;he started on horseback early in the morning to examine some rocks up the stream.&quot; He returned tired and complained of a headache. He breathed heavily and coughed all night. The native doctor diagnosed acute bronchitis and inflammation of the lungs and treated him with brandy mixed in a cough mixture. At 2 p.m. he drank some port wine and &quot;his respiration grew slower and slower, and also did his pulse, and he finally breathed his last, dying so quietly that it was impossible to say at what precise instant he passed away&quot;.

Stoliczka died on 19 June 1874 at Murgo in Ladakh. His dying request was that the birds part of the scientific results of the expedition be published by Allan Octavian Hume. This work was finally, however, completed by Richard Bowdler-Sharpe seventeen years later.

Dr. H. W. Bellew did the post-mortem and confirmed &quot;spinal meningitis deteriorated by over-exertion in strenuous endeavours after information, and the great height.&quot; Today this is generally believed to have been Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), a condition well known to Himalayan travellers. It manifests as pulmonary or cerebral oedema. Above this is fatal in about 40% of the cases. Conditions that aggravate it include exertion, fast ascent and alcohol, all of which were present in his case.
In his report on the expedition, Thomas E. Gordon touched on the death of his &quot;highly valued friend and talented companion.&quot;

A granite obelisk is erected in his memory at the Moravian mission cemetery in Leh. An obituary was published in &quot;Nature&quot; on 9 July 1874 by W. T. Blanford.

==Ornithological contributions==

Stoliczka&#x27;s interest in birds started only in 1864 when in the Himalayas and he was greatly encouraged by Allan Octavian Hume, the &quot;father of Indian Ornithology&quot;. His first ornithological work was making large collections of birds from the Sutlej Valley.

Arthur Viscount Walden recognized his contributions and welcomed the geologist Stoliczka &quot;to a high place among scientific ornithologists&quot; but disagreed with Stoliczka&#x27;s idea of adding new species due to small differences in plumage. Hume however supported Stoliczka and wrote a note in the journal, Ibis, against the &quot;cabinet naturalists&quot; of London who knew nothing about the geography of India. Hume shortly afterwards started the journal &quot;Stray Feathers&quot; and persuaded ornithologists in India to publish there.

Some of Stoliczka&#x27;s new species were later found to have been already described by the Russian zoologist N. A. Severtzov. A week before his death, Stoliczka wrote to Valentine Ball...
: &#x27;Please tell Waterhouse to order for the Asiatic, Severtzov&#x27;s &quot;Turkestanskie Jevotnie&quot; immediately, if it is not at the Indian Museum. If they do not like ordering it, order it for myself through Truebner without delay. Do not forget, please.&#x27;

<doc id="874827" wikidata="Q1181725" url="?curid=874827" title="List of storms named Alex">
<text>The name Alex has been used for twelve tropical cyclones worldwide: five in the Atlantic Ocean, four in the Western Pacific Ocean and three in the South-West Indian Ocean. The name has also been used for one extratropical European windstorm.

In the North Atlantic:
* Tropical Storm Alex (1998), a weak storm that never affected land.
* Hurricane Alex (2004), a hurricane that came within of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, then strengthened to Category 3 once clear of land.
* Hurricane Alex (2010), a Category 2 hurricane that made landfall in Belize as a tropical storm and passed over the Yucatán Peninsula before making landfall in Tamaulipas, Mexico, at maximum intensity.
* Hurricane Alex (2016), a rare Category 1 hurricane that formed in mid-January, made landfall in the Azores causing heavy rainfall and gusty winds.
* Tropical Storm Alex (2022), a short-lived tropical storm that produced heavy rainfall in the Yucatán Peninsula, western Cuba and South Florida while developing.

In the Western Pacific:
* Tropical Storm Alex (1980) (T8020, 24W), a short-lived tropical storm that formed to the north of Iwo Jima
* Typhoon Alex (1984) (T8403, 03W, Biring), a Category 1 typhoon that passed north over Taiwan before dissipating over South Korea
* Typhoon Alex (1987) (T8708, 08W, Etang), a minimal typhoon that brushed north Taiwan before striking mainland China; caused little damage from the typhoon, but its remnants contributed to some significant flooding in Korea
* Tropical Depression/Storm Alex (1998) (19W), a weak tropical cyclone that formed to the east of the Philippines before it was absorbed by the more powerful Typhoon Zeb; Japan Meteorological Agency analyzed it as a tropical depression, not as a tropical storm, but the Joint tropical Weather Center did call it a storm.

In the South-West Indian:
* Cyclone Alex (1981), a Category 2 cyclone that stayed well out to sea and did not approach any land
* Cyclone Alex (1990), a Category 5 cyclone (on the Australian scale) that formed in the Timor Sea and moved to the southwest without approaching land
* Cyclone Alex (2001), a tropical storm that formed to the north of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands before passing west of 90°E, when it was renamed Andre

In Europe:
*Storm Alex (2020), a powerful non-tropical storm that caused widespread wind and flood damage across Europe</text><links>

<doc id="874834" wikidata="Q583990" url="?curid=874834" title="Thurston Island">
<text>Thurston Island () is a largely ice-covered, glacially dissected island, long and wide, lying between Amundsen Sea and Bellingshausen Sea a short way off the northwest end of Ellsworth Land, Antarctica.
The island is separated from the mainland by Peacock Sound, which is occupied by the west portion of Abbot Ice Shelf.

== Geography ==
Thurston Island is separated from the mainland by Peacock Sound, which is occupied by the western portion of Abbot Ice Shelf.
It lies off the Eights Coast.
Bellingshausen Sea lies the east and Amundsen Sea to the west.
Sherman Island, Carpenter Island and Dustin Island in Seraph Bay lie to the south of Thurston Island.
The Walker Mountains form the spine of the island.
Peaks in that range include, from west to east, Landfall Peak, Mount Lopez, Mount Caldwell, Mount Kazukaitis, Mount Simpson, Mount Noxon, Mount Leech, Mount Hubbard, Smith Peak, Mount Borgesen, Guy Peaks, Mount Hawthorne, Mount Bramhall, Zuhn Bluff and Parker Peak.

The northwest side of the island consists of a series of capes, peninsulas and inlets.
From west to east they include Cape Flying Fish, Cape Petersen, Williams Island, Jones Peninsula, Dyer Point, Cape Davies, Hughes Peninsula, Henry Inlet, Tinglof Peninsula, Wagoner Inlet, Starr Peninsula, Potaka Inlet, Kearns Peninsula, Peale Inlet, Glacier Bight, Noville Peninsula, Porters Pinnacles and Mount Palmer.
Features of the north of the island include Sikorski Glacier, Mount Feury, Frankenfield Glacier, Mulroy Island, Black Crag, Pelter Glacier, Murphy Inlet, Linsley Peninsula, Ball Peninsula, Edwards Peninsula, Mount Bubier, Koether Inlet, Evans Peninsula, Cape Walden and Cape Braathen.

Features of the east coast include from north to south Cadwalader Inlet, Deadmond Glacier, Lofgren Peninsula, Cape Menzel, Barret Island, Morgan Inlet, Tierney Peninsula and Cape Annawan.

Features of the southeast coast include, from west to east, Von der Wall Point, Boker Rocks, Mount Dowling, Belknap Nunatak, Prickly Ridge, Shelton Head, Long Glacier, Simpson Bluff, Baker Knob, Harrison Nunatak, Cape Walker and Savage Glacier.

== History ==
Thurston Island island was discovered by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd and members of the United States Antarctic Service (USAS) in a flight from the &quot;Bear&quot; on 27 February 1940.
Byrd named it for W. Harris Thurston, a New York textile manufacturer, designer of the windproof &quot;Byrd Cloth&quot; and contributor to the expedition.
Originally charted as a peninsula, the feature was found to be an island by the USN Bellingshausen Sea Expedition in February 1960.

On 30 December 1946, Thurston Island was the site of Antarctica&#x27;s first fatal plane crash. A Martin PBM-5 Mariner (59098) of the US Navy with the Byrd expedition hit a ridge and burned on the island, killing 3 of the 9 occupants. The 6 survivors were rescued 13 days later.

==Northwest features==
===Cape Flying Fish===
An ice-covered cape which forms the west extremity of Thurston Island. 
Discovered by R. Admiral Byrd and members of the United States Antarctic Service (USAS) in a flight from the &quot;Bear&quot;, February 1940. 
Named by US-SCAN for the USEE ship &quot;Flying Fish&quot;, commanded by Lieutenant William M. Walker, United States Navy, which reached a point within of this cape; the ship&#x27;s position on the morning of 23 March 1839 was 70|00|S|100|16|W 

===Cape Petersen===
A rounded ice-covered cape on the north side of Thurston Island, about east-northeast of Cape Flying Fish. 
Delineated from air photos taken by United States Navy Operation Highjump in December 1946. 
Named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Carl O. Petersen, radio engineer with the ByrdAE in 1928-30 and 1933-35.

===Williams Island===
Ice-covered island about long, lying midway between Cape Petersen and Dyer Point and about off the north coast of Thurston Island.

<text>In electronics, desoldering is the removal of solder and components from a circuit board for troubleshooting, repair, replacement, and salvage.

==Tools==

Desoldering tools and materials include the following:

*Solder wick
*Heat guns, also called hot air guns
*Desoldering pump
*Removal alloys
*Removal fluxes
*Heated soldering tweezers
*Various picks and tweezers for tasks such as pulling at, holding, removing, and scraping components.
*Vacuum and pressure pumps with specialized heater tips and nozzles
*Rework stations, used to repair printed circuit board assemblies that fail factory test.
Terminology is not totally standardised. Anything with a base unit with provision to maintain a stable temperature, pump air in either direction, etc., is often called a &quot;station&quot; (preceded by rework, soldering, desoldering, hot air); one, or sometimes more, tools may be connected to a station, e.g., a rework station may accommodate a soldering iron and hot air head. A soldering iron with a hollow tip and a spring-, bulb-, or electrically operated suction pump may be called a . Terms such as &quot;suction pen&quot; may be used; the meaning is usually clear from the context.

===Pumps===
Electrically operated pumps are used for several purposes in conjunction with a hand-held head connected by a tube.

Suction pumps are used to suck away molten solder, leaving previously joined terminals disconnected. They are primarily used to release through-hole connections from a PCB. The desoldering head must be designed so that the extracted solder does not solidify so as to obstruct it, or enter the pump, and can be removed and discarded easily. It is not possible to remove a multi-pin part by melting solder on the pins sequentially, as one joint will solidify as the next is melted; pumps and solder wick are among methods to remove solder from all joints, leaving the part free to be removed.

Suction pumps are also used with a suction head appropriate for each part to pick up and remove tiny surface mount devices once solder has melted, and to place parts.

Hot air pumps blow air hot enough to melt all the solder around a small surface mounted part, and can be used for soldering parts in place, and for desoldering followed by removal before the solder solidifies by a vacuum pump or with tweezers. Hot air has a tendency to oxidise metals; a non-oxidising gas, usually nitrogen, can be used instead of air, at increased cost of equipment and consumables.

====Desoldering pump====

A desoldering pump, colloquially known as a solder sucker, is a manually-operated device which is used to remove solder from a printed circuit board. There are two types: the &quot;plunger&quot; style and &quot;bulb&quot; style. (An electrically operated pump for this purpose would usually be called a vacuum pump.)

The plunger type has a cylinder with a spring-loaded piston which is pushed down and locks into place. When triggered by pressing a button, the piston springs up, creating suction that sucks the solder off the soldered connection. The bulb type creates suction by squeezing and releasing a rubber bulb.

The pump is applied to a heated solder connection, then operated to suck the solder away.

===Desoldering braid===
Desoldering braid, also known as desoldering wick or solder wick, is finely braided 18 to 42 AWG copper wire coated with rosin flux, usually supplied on a roll.
The end of a length of braid is placed over the soldered connections of a component being removed. The connections are heated with a soldering iron until the solder melts and is wicked into the braid by capillary action. The braid is removed while the solder is still molten, its used section cut off and discarded when cool. Short lengths of cut braid will prevent heat being carried away by the braid instead of heating the joint.

==Technique==
Desoldering requires application of heat to the solder joint and removing the molten solder so that the joint may be separated. Desoldering may be required to replace a defective component, to alter an existing circuit, or to salvage components for re-use. Use of too high a temperature or heating for too long may damage components or destroy the bond between a printed circuit trace and the board substrate. Techniques are different for through-hole and surface-mounted components.

===Through-hole===

A component with one or two connections to the PCB can usually be removed by heating one joint, pulling out an end of the component while the solder is molten (bending the other lead to do so), and repeating for the second joint. Solder filling the hole can be removed with a pump or with a pointed object made of a material which solder does not wet, such as stainless steel or wood.

If a multi-pin component need not be salvaged, it is often possible to cut the pins, then remove the residual ends one by one.

Components with more connections cannot be removed intact in the way described above unless the wire leads are long and flexible enough to be pulled out one by one. For a component such as a Dual-Inline Package (DIP), the pins are too short to pull out, and solder melted on one joint will solidify before another can be melted. A technique sometimes used is the use of a large soldering-iron tip designed to melt the solder on all pins at once; different tips are required for different packages. The component is removed while the solder is molten, most easily by a spring-loaded puller attached to it before heating.

Otherwise all joints must be freed from solder before the component can be removed. Each joint must be heated and the solder removed from it while molten using a vacuum pump, manual desoldering pump, or desoldering braid.

For through-hole technology on double-sided or multi-layer boards, special care must be taken not to remove the via connecting the layers, as this will ruin the entire board. Hard pulling on a lead which is not entirely free of solder (or with solder not thoroughly molten in the case of a soldering iron tip heating all pins) may pull out a via.

To remove and recover all components, both through-hole and surface-mount, from a board which itself is usually no longer needed, a flame or hot air gun can be used to rapidly heat all parts so they can be pulled off. Parts may be damaged, and toxic fumes emitted, if excessive temperature or prolonged heating is used.

===Surface mount===
If they do not need to be re-used, some surface-mount components can be removed by cutting their leads and desoldering the remnants with a soldering iron.

Otherwise, surface-mount components must be removed by heating the entire component to a temperature sufficient to melt the solder used, but not high or prolonged enough to damage the component. For most purposes, a temperature not exceeding for a time not exceeding 10 seconds is acceptable.

The entire board may be preheated to a temperature that all components can withstand indefinitely. Then localised heat is applied to the component to remove, with less heating required than from cold. Most frequently, a hot air (or hot gas) gun, with a nozzle of appropriate size and shape, is used to heat the component, with nearby components shielded from the heat if necessary, followed by removal with tweezers or a vacuum tool. Removal of multi-pin components with a soldering iron and solder removal tools is impractical, as the solder between the component and the pads remains in place, unlike solder which can be removed from a hole.

Hot air (or gas) may be applied with tools ranging from some portable gas soldering irons such as the Weller Portasol Professional which can be fitted with a narrow hot-air nozzle, set to a temperature not controlled but approximately correct, to an industrial rework station with many facilities including hot-gas blowing, vacuum part holding, soldering iron head, and nozzles and fitting specific to particular component packages.

===Quad flat packages===
Quad Flat Package (QFP) chips have thin leads closely packed together protruding from the four sides of the integrated circuit (IC); usually a square IC. Removal of these chips can be problematic as it is impossible to heat all of the leads at once with a standard soldering iron. It is possible to remove them with the use of a razor blade or a high-rpm craft tool, simply by cutting off the leads. The stubs are then easy to melt off and clean with a soldering iron. Obviously this technique entails the destruction of the IC. Another method is to use a heat gun or pencil butane torch and heat up a corner, and gently pry it off, working the torch down the leads. This method often leads to traces getting lifted off the PCB where a lead did not get heated enough to cause the solder to flow.

Several vendors offer systems that use heat shields to concentrate hot air where it needs to be, protecting nearby components and avoiding damage to the board or the QFP. The extractor uses a spring system that gently pulls the IC upward when the liquid stage of solder has been reached. The IC is held by a vacuum nozzle similar to the ones used in pick &amp; place machines. This system prevents damage to the pads on the PCB, the IC, avoids overheating surrounding components and blowing them off and also reduces the risk of operator error when using tweezers or other tools that can damage the PCB or IC.

Another way to remove these devices is to use Field&#x27;s metal, an alloy which melts at around 140 °F (62 °C), lower than the boiling point of water. The metal is melted into the solder joints of the device, where it remains liquid even once cooled down to room temperature, and the chip can simply be lifted off the board. This has the advantage of not damaging the PCB or the IC, although the solder joints must be carefully cleaned of any remaining Field&#x27;s metal to maintain solder joint strength after resoldering.

<text>Velma Jean Terrell (born November 26, 1944) is an American R&amp;B and jazz singer. She replaced Diana Ross as the lead singer of The Supremes in 1970.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
She is the sister of the former WBA heavyweight boxing champion Ernie Terrell, who fought Muhammad Ali.

Before her career with the Supremes, she sang with her brother Ernie in the group Ernie Terrell and the Knockouts (sometimes the Heavyweights).

===The Supremes (1970–1973)===
Motown president Berry Gordy discovered Terrell in 1969 in Miami, where she was performing with her brother at a club. Looking for a replacement for Diana Ross, who was leaving the group she had fronted during most of the 1960s, the Supremes, for a solo career, Gordy first signed Terrell to Motown as a solo artist, but decided to join her with the Supremes as Ross&#x27;s replacement alongside Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong, as announced in 1969.

After Ross&#x27;s farewell show with the group at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas on January 14, 1970, Terrell joined the group on stage to be presented to the press and public. After this introduction, according to Mary Wilson, Gordy changed his mind about Terrell leading the group and suggested replacing her with Syreeta Wright. Gordy said: I don&#x27;t like Jean. I want to replace her with Syreeta. Wilson vetoed this move, instead wanting to continue the group with Terrell.

The group scored more chart success at the beginning of the new decade, scoring hits in the United Kingdom, while having several pop and soul hits in the United States, including &quot;Up the Ladder to the Roof&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got the Right to Love&quot;, &quot;Stoned Love&quot;, &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot; (with the Four Tops), &quot;Nathan Jones&quot;, and &quot;Floy Joy&quot;.

After the success of &quot;Floy Joy,&quot; Birdsong quit after getting pregnant and was replaced by Lynda Laurence. Despite the success towards the end of 1973, Terrell and Laurence decided that it would be best for the Supremes to leave Motown and seek another record label, however, Motown owned the name &quot;Supremes&quot;, and both Terrell and Laurence left the group that year. All three Supremes were not interested with Motown&#x27;s seeming lack of interest in promoting this line-up of the group, in addition, Laurence was expecting a child at the time. Scherrie Payne, sister of Freda Payne, replaced Terrell and Cindy Birdsong returned to replace Laurence in 1973.

===Solo career===
Signing a contract with A&amp;M Records, A&amp;M issued a solo album by Terrell, &quot;I Had to Fall in Love&quot;, in 1978, which did not make impact on any charts, although promoting the title track on the Dinah! show in July 1978. She did have a minor hit with &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Reaching for the Top&quot;, which peaked at #72 on the R&amp;B charts. In the early 1980s, Terrell put together a one-woman show, and did limited touring throughout the United States, and her act consisted of several Supremes songs, songs from her solo album and cover versions of songs by Bette Midler and Lionel Richie. Laurence would often perform background vocals for Terrell throughout the shows in the tour. Another who performed backing vocals for Terrell during these tours was Freddi Poole, later a member of Payne and Laurence&#x27;s group the Former Ladies of the Supremes.

===Former Ladies of the Supremes===

In 1985, eight years after the Supremes officially broke up in 1977, Payne was signed to SuperStar International Records, a Los Angeles-based record label. Her then-partner Ronnie Phillips approached her with the idea of reforming the Supremes, to which she agreed, and asked Wilson and Birdsong to join the group. Wilson declined, instead opting to continue her solo career, while Birdsong agreed and persuaded Terrell to join the new group.

The grouping of Terrell, Payne and Birdsong set about forming a spinoff group of the Supremes, although due to contractual difficulties over the ownership of the name. They decided to create an entirely new group using the abbreviation &quot;FLOS&quot;, for the name the Former Ladies of the Supremes. Before the group began their career, Birdsong left for a solo career, and Laurence joined the lineup alongside Terrell and Payne, replacing Birdsong just as she had in 1972, and the group released the song &quot;We&#x27;re Back&quot;, released on SuperStar International Records. However, the label did not have national distribution, the song failed to chart and the label folded after. The group began touring and performing in shows around this time, making their debut at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles in 1987. By then, they recorded several singles for the United Kingdom-based Motorcity Records label for Ian Levine throughout 1989 and 1990, joining a roster of former Motown artists.

===Recent years===

In December 1992, Terrell left the group and was replaced by Sundray Tucker. Terrell released a biographical DVD, &quot;Through the Eyes of a Supreme&quot;, and today she has continued to sing onstage with various jazz musicians. She made an occasional appearance onstage (along with Poole and Mary Flowers), singing Supremes hits.

==Personal life==

Jean was married to Juan Thompson. The union produced two sons, Jason and Jonathan.

<doc id="874843" wikidata="Q1621811" url="?curid=874843" title="Royal British Legion">
<text>The Royal British Legion (RBL), formerly the British Legion, is a British charity providing financial, social and emotional support to members and veterans of the British Armed Forces, their families and dependants.

== Membership ==
Service in the armed forces is no longer a requirement of Legion membership. The Legion has an official membership magazine, &quot;Legion&quot;, which is free to all Legion members as part of their annual subscription.

== History ==
The British Legion was founded on 15 May 1921 as a voice for the ex-service community as a bringing together of four organisations: the Comrades of the Great War, the National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers and the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, and incorporated the fundraising department of the Officers&#x27; Association.

Field Marshal The 1st Earl Haig (1861–1928), British commander at the Battle of the Somme and Passchendaele, was one of the founders of the Legion. Lord Haig served as the president of the British Legion until his death.
According to Mark Garnett and Richard Weight, it was established and run by Britain&#x27;s upper class, but gained a broad membership. They argue:

A royal charter was granted in 1925, accompanied by invaluable patronage from royal circles. During the Second World War, it was active in civil defence, providing officers to the Home Guard. Its membership grew rapidly from veterans of the Second World War, reaching three million in 1950. It declined to a half million elderly survivors by 2003.

In 1997, the Royal British Legion rejected calls to include gay and lesbian veterans in its ceremonies, and called the advent of a Queer Remembrance Ceremony &quot;offensive&quot;. In the 2000s, it reversed this policy.

== Functions ==

Perhaps best known for the yearly Poppy Appeal and Remembrance services, the Legion is a campaigning organisation that promotes the welfare and interests of current and former members of the British Armed Forces.

The Legion support nearly 36,000 War Disablement Pension cases for war veterans and make around 300,000 welfare and friendship visits every year.

Legion campaigns include calls for more research into: Gulf War syndrome and compensation for its victims; upgrading of War Pensions; the extension of endowment mortgage compensation for British military personnel serving overseas; and better support for British military personnel resettling into civilian life.

== Poppy Appeal ==
The Legion holds a fund-raising drive each year in the weeks before Remembrance Sunday, during which artificial Remembrance poppy red poppies, meant to be worn on clothing, are offered to the public in return for a donation to the Legion. The Poppy is the trademark of The Royal British Legion, RBL states &quot;The red poppy is our registered mark and its only lawful use is to raise funds for the Poppy Appeal&quot;. The paper poppies are manufactured at the Poppy Factory in Richmond. Other products bearing the Poppy, the Trademark of The Royal British Legion are sold throughout the year as part of the ongoing fundraising.

== Festival of Remembrance ==

The Legion organises &#x27;The Festival of Remembrance&#x27; in Royal Albert Hall, London on the Saturday before Remembrance Sunday. Originally featuring composer John Foulds&#x27;s &quot;World Requiem&quot; it now includes military displays by current members of the armed forces, choral works, and prayers. It culminates with Servicemen and Women, with representatives from youth uniformed organizations and uniformed public security services of the City of London, parading down the aisles and onto the floor of the hall. There is a release of poppy petals from the roof of the hall.

On the day there are two performances. The matinee is open to any member of the public. The evening event is open only to members of the Legion and their families, and is attended by senior members of the Royal Family; starting and ending with the British National Anthem, God Save the King, and includes the three cheers led by the army&#x27;s London District Garrison Sergeant Major at the finale. In 2007, the second half of the evening event was aired live on BBC Radio 2. BBC One showed the event an hour later.

Most parts of the Festival are of a formal, thought-provoking, and solemn nature. In recent years, the items have included more contemporary performers to attract a younger audience. They have included family members of serving military personnel (e.g. The Poppy Girls and the Military Wives choir); singers Gregory Porter, Joss Stone, Jim Radford and James Blunt, the latter two of whom being both military veterans; and the animatronic horse used in the war film &quot;War Horse&quot;.

Musical accompaniment for the event is provided by a military band from the Household Division together with The Countess of Wessex&#x27;s String Orchestra, joined by musicians of the Royal Air Force (via the RAF Music Services through the RAF Salon Orchestra) and representatives of the Royal Marines Band Service.

== Honour the Covenant campaign ==

&quot;Honour the Covenant&quot; is a campaign launched by The Royal British Legion in September 2007, which calls on the UK Government to honour the Military Covenant. The campaign aims to seek public support for the issues identified by the Legion and to encourage their Members of Parliament to act to ensure that Government policy is changed.

The campaign accuses the Government of failing to meet its commitments under the Covenant. The Legion highlighted the case of a 23-year-old paratrooper, injured in battle, who was awarded £152,150 despite injuries requiring care for the rest of his life. It also criticised the practice of treating soldiers in wards alongside civilian patients. In his conference speech that October, Conservative Party leader David Cameron referred to the Covenant and said &quot;Mr. Brown, I believe your government has broken it.&quot;

===Medical care===
Responding to the Royal British Legion&#x27;s campaign, the former Secretary of State for Health Alan Johnson announced in November 2007 that all armed forces veterans would get priority treatment on the National Health Service for service-related conditions, and those injured would be treated immediately in hospital rather than go through waiting lists. Prescription charges would also be waived.

== Online assistance ==
The Legion sponsors a website, CivvyStreet.org, which assists Service leavers and members of the ex-Service community and their dependents with information, advice and guidance (IAG) on resettlement, learning and work. Specialist services are provided by partner organisations. Opportunities for funding may also be available to those who qualify for assistance. The website has been designed to give a single gateway to the services and support that partners provide for resettlement, learning and work.

== Controversies ==
===Donations===
In September 2009, the Legion accepted a donation from Rachel Firth, a member of the British National Party (BNP). She raised money by spending 24 hours in a cardboard box, giving half to the BNP and half to the Legion. Initially, the donation was rejected, but, after Firth gave an assurance that its giving would not be &quot;exploited politically&quot;, it was accepted.

In August 2010, Tony Blair pledged the proceeds of his memoirs, &quot;A Journey&quot;, to the Legion, &quot;as a way of marking the enormous sacrifice [the armed forces] make for the security of our people and the world&quot;. This included a £4.6 million advance, making it the largest single donation in the charity&#x27;s history. Chris Simpkins, the Legion&#x27;s Director General, said he was delighted with what he called &quot;this very generous&quot; offer and the Legion announced that it would be used to help fund its planned &quot;Battle Back&quot; challenge, a project to provide state-of-the-art rehabilitation services for troops returning from the frontline with serious injuries. Amongst the generally favourable reaction to the news, some anti war campaigners and families of soldiers killed during the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan claimed the donation was &quot;blood money&quot; and a public relations stunt.

===Subscriptions===
In 2015, the administration office announced that the practice of subscriptions being paid informally within clubs by cash would cease, and that in future all subscriptions would need to be paid either via online payment, direct debit, cheque or in cash at PayPoint. In North Wales this prompted a number of associated clubs to leave the Legion, including Colwyn Bay and Conwy, with others voting on also doing so.

===Royal British Legion Women&#x27;s Section===
The Royal British Legion Women&#x27;s Section (RBLWS) was founded in 1921 and operated independently for some 96 years, with its own branches, standards and standard bearers, county branches, income and expenditure, national central committee, and annual conference. In mid-December 2015, with minimal consultation with the RBLWS, the Royal British Legion wrote to all RBLWS branches announcing its decision to integrate the Women&#x27;s Section into itself by October 2016, when the RBLWS would become a &quot;district&quot; of the RBL, no longer operating as a separate organisation. Its national standard would no longer appear at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday and would be “laid up”, never to be used again. The RBLWS national officers had been told about this in advance, but they were also told to treat the information as confidential, so that they could not fore-warn their members. This speedily led to mass protests and branch closures. By September 2016, public perception of the RBL had fallen to its lowest level in four years. In December, long-serving members accused the RBL of acting in a dictatorial fashion, and one member commented &quot;It is definitely like the pre-Suffragette era. Men are ordering the women around.&quot; By the beginning of 2017, membership of the RBLWS had fallen from about 32,000 to fewer than 16,000. The integration of the RBLWS into the RBL was completed in November 2017.

The RBLWS was still in existence in 2019, with a central committee of seven members and with its chairman having a seat on the RBL Board of Trustees. By then its substantial funds had been integrated into the accounts of the RBL.

== Bands ==

There are over 50 Legion bands around the world, each run and funded independently. They include full concert show bands, brass ensembles, pipe and drum bands, marching bands and youth bands.

The Central Band of the Royal British Legion is the Legion&#x27;s flagship band. In existence since 1944, the band was recognised as the Legion&#x27;s premier band in 1983 and gained its title of &quot;The Central Band of the Royal British Legion&quot; three years later.

== Clubs ==

The Royal British Legion has an extensive network of Social Clubs called Legion Clubs throughout the United Kingdom. The Royal British Legion also has branches in the Republic of Ireland. Other branches are spread around the world, mostly in mainland Europe, but also in the United States, Thailand, Belize, the Falkland Islands and Hong Kong.

The Royal British Legion Riders Branch (RBLR) is a specialist worldwide branch of The Royal British Legion for motorcyclists. Its members hold events such as Weston Bike Night in Weston-super-Mare and rallies such as the RBLR 1000, a 1,000 mile in 24 hours sponsored ride, all to raise money for the Poppy Appeal. Many RBLR members attended the repatriation ceremonies in Royal Wootton Bassett. Ex-services members of the RBLR often wear medals and head-dress with their leathers and motorcycle kit.

== Scotland ==

Within Scotland, a sister organisation to the RBL, the &quot;Royal British Legion Scotland&quot;, operates on the same basis as the RBL functions elsewhere within the UK, and is a Registered Charity within Scotland, (SC003323).

==Employment Tribunal - RBL HR not fit for purpose==

A former Royal British Legion case officer won a tribunal case in November 2017, exposing a culture of bullying and HR negligence that led to her wrongful dismissal. The employment tribunal heard that there was a culture of bullying in the HR function at the RBL HQ and the entire HR department had left the charity.

==Freedoms==
The Royal British Legion has received the freedom of several UK local government areas.

<text>The University of Puerto Rico-Humacao (, UPRH or UPR-Humacao) is a public college in Humacao, Puerto Rico. It is part of the University of Puerto Rico. Its campus is home to the UPRH Astronomical Observatory and the college graduates more majors in chemistry, physics, and mathematics than any other higher education institution on the island. UPRH has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) since 1965.

== History ==
In 1962, the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao was founded as the first UPR Regional College providing students from the eastern region of the country access to the University of Puerto Rico and facilitating the transfer to other UPR units with higher levels of academic offerings. The Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools gave the Regional College its first accreditation in 1965. From 1967 to 1972, the institution established around 8 associate degrees in Administrative Sciences, Health Sciences, and Arts. Pedro González Ramos was the second Dean of the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao from 1960 to 1972. 

In 1973, the Regional College was renamed as the Humacao University College &quot;(also known as CUH)&quot; approved by the Legislature of Puerto Rico, and started offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Arts and Sciences. Between 1973 and 1987 over 18 bachelor&#x27;s degrees were established and offered. The Council for Higher Education Accreditation gave the CUH its autonomy permitting the designation of the first rector (chancellor) and directive bodies.

The University of Puerto Rico Board of Trustees changed the institution&#x27;s name in 1999 to the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao. Nowadays, the UPRH is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and offers over 26 undergraduate programs, including 5 associate degrees.

In 2010 the campus went on strike as part of the 2010–2011 University of Puerto Rico strikes. In 2017 in response to budget cuts to the university system by the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico the campus students voted to join the University of Puerto Rico strikes, 2017.

==Academics==
The UPR Humacao campus offers more than 26 undergraduate major programs, through 10 departments in Natural Sciences, Administrative Sciences, Health Sciences, Social Sciences, and Arts.

The Program enrolls students from all faculties of the UPRH who are prepared to comply with the requirements of it (a total of 11 credits): a research seminar, an independent study, an undergraduate thesis, and a third language; and its objective is to complement and enrich, within an interdisciplinary framework, the actual curriculum of students whose desires are to pursue graduated studies. The Academic Honors Program of the UPR Humacao campus is a member of the National Collegiate Honors Council and of the Puerto Rico University Association of Honor Programs.

=== Unique programs ===
UPRH lies in the east of the island, highlighting the chemical-pharmaceutical and electronics as well as several areas of ecological and tourist value. To meet the demand for labor in that region UPRH offers unique baccalaureate programs in the UPR system and Puerto Rico in:

* Industrial Chemistry
* Computational Mathematics
* Applied Physics to Electronics
* Coastal Marine Biology
* Wild Life Management
Also, other unique major programs that UPRH offers are:
* Social Action Research
* International Commerce
* Occupational Therapy
This campus has been the scene of the Dove Project Sabanera, native species threatened with extinction, Project Moonbuggy for designing lunar vehicles, and maintains the Microbial Observatory of the Salinas in Cabo Rojo sponsored by the National Science Foundation. In April 2017, the UPR Humacao team won the first place in the university category during the fourth competition of NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge which was held at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

=== Faculty ===
The faculty is composed of the Chancellor, the Dean of Academic Affairs, the academic department directors, and the teaching staff of the university. As of Fall 2016, the student to faculty ratio for the UPRH 16:1, and there was more than 223 instructional faculty at the campus. Fifty percent of the faculty has doctoral degree and forty percent has mastery. Thirty-nine percent of the teaching staff held the rank of University Full Professor. In the same way, 359 non-teaching employees worked in the institution, of which fifty percent were female; fifteen of these employees had a master&#x27;s degree, forty percent had baccalaureate, ten percent had an associate degree, and thirty-five percent had non-university education.

UPRH faculty continue to be recognized on the academic stage constantly by many national agencies and associations as the Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography, the Partnership for Research and Education in Materials&quot;,&quot; National Science Foundation, Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students, the Puerto Rico Board of Accountacy, and the Emeritus Professor award. In June 2017, the International Astronomical Union assigned the name (11456) Cotto-Figueroa to the asteroid previously known as 1981 EK9 in recognition of the scientific researches executed by the Professor Desireé Cotto Figueroa, Director of the Astronomical Observatory of the University of Puerto Rico in Humacao.

=== Graduation ===
The first UPRH Commencement ceremony was held in 1968, where 4 associate degrees were conferred (Accounting, Management, Nursing, and Secretarial Sciences). In the 2016–2017 academic year, the UPR Humacao campus awarded more than 574 undergraduate degrees, having 31 summa cum laude, 127 magna cum laude, and 80 cum laude academic distinctions. Commencement ceremonies are held once a year, at the end of the second semester of the academic year. Students that complete graduation requirements at the end of the summer session or in the first academic year, may request a Graduation Certificate at the Registrar&#x27;s Office on which will be reflected that they have completed their studies.

=== Library ===

The UPR Humacao library (or Águedo Mojica Marrero Library) is one the largest and most comprehensive library in the UPR System. In addition to creating active collections, the library keeps 99,774 volumes in its book collection, 66,230 journal titles, and it is subscribed to 2 newspapers. The Library is located in a three-story building that has 88,000 square feet. It has six (6) reading rooms, more than 56 computers, two (2) microfiche readers, eleven (11) individual study rooms, and 148 cubicles. The library can accommodate 589 users. The integration of the IT infrastructure with the bibliographic infrastructure facilitates the creation of skill development information programs that supplements those of the classrooms and the training of users in the handling of electronic resources applied to the academic work. The library personnel and professional librarians have managed to turn the Institution into the home of very important biblio-technological projects, such as CONUCO (Puerto Rican journals database) and EMEUPR (authorities’ Spanish database of the UPR).

The UPRH&#x27;s Library uses the University of Puerto Rico automated system known as Horizon and is connected to the Internet through various means.

<text>Aleksander Fredro (20 June 1793 – 15 July 1876) was a Polish poet, playwright and author active during Polish Romanticism in the period of partitions by neighboring empires. His works including plays written in the octosyllabic verse (&quot;Zemsta&quot;) and in prose (&quot;Damy i Huzary&quot;) as well as fables, belong to the canon of Polish literature. Fredro was harshly criticized by some of his contemporaries for light-hearted humor or even alleged immorality (Seweryn Goszczyński, 1835) which led to years of his literary silence. Many of Fredro&#x27;s dozens of plays were published and popularized only after his death. His best-known works have been translated into English, French, German, Russian, Czech, Romanian, Hungarian and Slovak.

==Biography==
Count Aleksander Fredro, of the Bończa coat of arms, was born in the village of Surochów near Jarosław, then a crown territory of Austria. A landowner&#x27;s son, he was educated at home. He entered the Polish army at age 16 and saw action in the Napoleonic wars, including the Moscow campaign. His memoir &quot;Topsy Turvy Talk&quot;, which echoes the style of Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, recounts his military experiences during Bonaparte&#x27;s last campaign. While in France in 1814, he took an active interest in French drama. After leaving the army he settled on his estate and began as a writer.

Fredro made his literary debut in 1817, but he was not interested in the problems of Romanticism. His first work was &quot;Mąż i żona”. He wrote social comedies about the lifestyle of the Polish nobility and is known for his skill in characterization and plot, as well as the flexibility of his language. His work also features humor typical of folk theatre from the Romantic period, and a fast-paced farce with varying degrees of sophistication.

Two of Fredro&#x27;s fables, &quot;The Monkey in the Bath&quot; (&quot;Małpa w kąpieli&quot;) and &quot;Paul and Gawel&quot; (&quot;Paweł i Gaweł&quot;), belong to the most popular children&#x27;s stories in the country. His best-known comedy, &quot;Zemsta&quot; (The Revenge), was adapted for the screen in Poland by eminent film director Andrzej Wajda in 2002. 

Fredro was the maternal grandfather of the head of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky. He was commemorated on a Polish postage stamp issued in 1978.

He died on 15 July 1876 in Lviv and was buried in a family grave in Catholic Church of the Assumption of Rudky.

<doc id="874857" wikidata="Q3567546" url="?curid=874857" title="Epidamnos">
<text>Epidamnos &quot;(Ancient Greek: Επίδαμνος, Albanian: Epidamn)&quot;, later known as Dyrrachium &quot;(Latin: Dyrrhachium, Greek: Δυρράχιον, Albanian: Dyrrah)&quot;, was a prominent city on the Adriatic coast, located in modern-day Durrës, Albania. It was founded in 627 BC by Greek settlers from Corinth and Corcyra (modern Corfu). and evolved into a significant political, commercial, and military hub throughout antiquity. Initially a Greek colony, it became a major Illyrian center, then a key Roman and Byzantine stronghold, before continuing its historical trajectory under later empires.

== Greek period (7th century BC – 3rd century BC) ==
Epidamnos was established in a strategic coastal location, facilitating maritime trade and interaction with the Illyrians, making it a vital trading hub between Greek city-states and local Taulantii tribe. The Taulantii tribe played a key role in the city&#x27;s development, and evidence suggests a degree of cultural fusion between the Greek settlers and the indigenous Illyrians. Illyrians influenced the city but never ruled it independently.

Politically, Epidamnos was originally governed as an oligarchy, with power concentrated among the aristocracy. Allegedly, individual trading with the local Illyrians was forbidden and all traffic was through the authorized city agent or .. The exiled oligarchs appealed to Corcyra while the democrats enlisted the help of Corinth, initiating the struggle between the two cities. These internal struggles led to broader regional conflicts, with Corcyra and Corinth intervening in Epidamnos&#x27; affairs, setting the stage for the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), as described by Thucydides. 

Over time, internal conflicts led to a shift toward a more democratic system, as noted several times by Aristotle in &quot;Politics,&quot; who took Epidamnos as an example of governments with tight oligarchy that appointed a ruling magistrate.

In the fourth century BC the city-state was part of the kingdoms of Cassander and Pyrrhus. The general vicinity of Epidamnos was called Epidamnia. During the Hellenistic era, the city was briefly controlled by the Macedonian rulers Cassander and Pyrrhus of Epirus in the 4th century BC. Pyrrhus, one of the most formidable opponents of Rome, used Epidamnos as a strategic base in his campaigns.

== Roman period (3rd century BC – 4th century AD) ==
Epidamnos was seized by the Romans in 229 BC during their first campaign against Illyrian forces, the first Illyrian War, however, the city managed to maintain semi-autonomy and turned into a roman colony. Due to its strategic location along the Adriatic, Rome transformed the city into an important transit point, renaming it Dyrrachium to avoid the negative connotations of &quot;Epidamnos&quot; (which resembled the Latin word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;loss&quot;). Despite this, the name Dyrrachion had already been used on local coins as early as the 5th century BC, due to the fact that in the Roman period, &quot;Dyrrachium&quot; was more common. Pausanias (6.x.8) says &quot;the modern Roman city is not the ancient one, being at a short distance from it. The modern city is called Dyrrhachium from its founder.&quot;

Dyrrachium played a crucial role as the main port for Roman travelers crossing the Ionian Sea from Brundisium (modern Brindisi) in Italy. It served as the starting point of the Via Egnatia, the major military and trade route connecting Roman Illyria with Macedonia and Thrace, leading to key cities such as Thessalonica and Byzantium (later Constantinople).

In 48 BC, Dyrrachium became a battleground during the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey. Pompey successfully defended the city but failed to capitalize on his advantage, leading to his decisive defeat at Pharsalus. Under the Roman Empire, the city remained an important administrative center, and in AD 345, a devastating earthquake led to its reconstruction on its old foundations.

== Byzantine and medieval period ==
Dyrrachium became the capital of the newly established Roman province of Epirus Nova in the late 3rd century AD, reinforcing its religious and administrative importance. Its bishopric was elevated to a metropolitan see, overseeing the dioceses of the province. The city&#x27;s fortifications were reinforced under Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century to defend against barbarian invasions.

In the 9th century, Emperor Nikephoros I reorganized the province as the &quot;Theme of Dyrrachium&quot;, an important Byzantine military district. The city served as a key stronghold against Slavic and Norman incursions, playing a pivotal role in the empire&#x27;s defense of the Adriatic coast. The Normans, under Robert Guiscard, besieged and captured Dyrrachium in 1081, only for the Byzantines to reclaim it later.

Throughout the Middle Ages, control of Dyrrachium frequently shifted between the Byzantines, Venetians, and the Despotate of Epirus. The Byzantines continued to refer to the city by its original name, Epidamnus, as late as the 13th century, as recorded in the &quot;Synopsis Chronike&quot;.

== Legacy and modern significance ==
Dyrrachium, now Durrës, remains one of Albania&#x27;s most historically significant cities. Its ancient ruins, including remnants of Roman roads, an amphitheater, and Byzantine fortifications, stand as testaments to its rich and complex past. Its strategic location on the Adriatic continues to make it a crucial economic and cultural center in the region.

<text>Yau Ma Tei, formerly named Waterloo after Waterloo Road, is an MTR station located in Yau Ma Tei, Kowloon. It lays straightly like a long box under thoroughfare Nathan Road, ending north under Pitt Street and south near Man Ming Lane. It is served by the and the . The station opened on 22 December 1979 and was renamed as Yau Ma Tei on 31 May 1985 along with Argyle (Mong Kok) and Chater (Central).

Yau Ma Tei is an interchange station, even though the platforms are not designed for cross-platform interchange. After the Kwun Tong line has been extended to Whampoa, it is used by northbound passengers on one line to change to southbound trains on the other line. This station is used by many students during commuting hours, since it is in the vicinity of many large schools.

The station&#x27;s livery colour is a light grey. Red, white, and blue stripes, which prominently adorned the station walls until they were removed as part of renovation works in 2005 which also saw the original Helvetica typeface, used in station name signs, replaced by Myriad.

==History==
In 1967, the station was proposed as Waterloo, a double station with Tsuen Wan Line on the east side of Nathan Road, and Kwun Tong Line the west, linking with pedestrian tunnels, in Hong Kong Mass Transport Study. The design was later scaled down when the projected population was recalculated based on new census data. 

Contract 101 includes the construction of this station, along with Argyle (now Mong Kok) and Prince Edward stations. It was awarded to a joint venture between Gammon, Kier International, and Lilley Construction. The station, along with other sections under Nathan Road, was built with cut-and-cover. This inevitably brought much trouble on Nathan Road, the thoroughfare in Kowloon Peninsular. The construction induced serious traffic congestion in Kowloon, produced quite amount of dust to the environment, and affected the business on both side of the road.

On 16 December 1979, The Kwun Tong line was extended from Shek Kip Mei to Tsim Sha Tsui station. However, Yau Ma Tei station was opened on 22nd of that month as an infill station. When the station was first opened, only upper level platform was in use. Three weeks before Tsuen Wan line opened, on 26 April 1982, MTR Corporation split the Modified Initial System into Kwun Tong line and Tsuen Wan line, in order to let passengers to get used to transfer at Mong Kok station. On the same day, the lower level platform was put into use.

The Kwun Tong line was extended to Whampoa station on 23 October 2016.

==Station layout==
From the scissor crossing after Whampoa terminus to north of Yau Ma Tei, the Kwun Tong line drives on the right side of the tunnel, as opposed to almost everywhere else in the MTR, where the driving direction is usually on the left (except for the ). The difference in driving directionality is due to the track layout between Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok stations.

The Kwun Tong line extension towards Whampoa station via Ho Man Tin opened on 23 October 2016. In preparation, the numbers of the Kwun Tong line platforms were swapped starting on 11 June 2016, and platform 4 became alighting-only (and platform 3 boarding-only) from 21 August 2016. After the opening of the Kwun Tong line extension, Yau Ma Tei became an interchange station between the Kwun Tong line and the Tsuen Wan line, with each line using platforms on a different level.

<doc id="874862" wikidata="Q931065" url="?curid=874862" title="Kenneth Snelson">
<text>Kenneth Duane Snelson (June 29, 1927 – December 22, 2016) was an American contemporary sculptor and photographer. His sculptural works, exemplified by &quot;Needle Tower&quot;, are composed of flexible and rigid components arranged according to the idea of &#x27;tensegrity&#x27;. Snelson preferred the descriptive term floating compression.

Snelson said his former professor Buckminster Fuller took credit for Snelson&#x27;s discovery of the concept that Fuller named tensegrity. Fuller gave the idea its name, combining &#x27;tension&#x27; and &#x27;structural integrity.&#x27; Kārlis Johansons had exhibited tensegrity sculptures several years before Snelson was even born. The height and strength of Snelson&#x27;s sculptures, which are often delicate in appearance, depend on the tension between rigid pipes and flexible cables.

== Biography ==

Snelson was born in Pendleton, Oregon, in 1927. He studied at the University of Oregon in Eugene, at the Black Mountain College, and with Fernand Léger in Paris. His sculpture and photography have been exhibited at over 25 one-man shows in galleries around the world including the structurally seminal Park Place Gallery in New York in the 1960s. Snelson also did research on the shape of the atom. Snelson continued to work in his SoHo studio, occasionally collaborating with animator Jonathan Monaghan. He lived in New York City with his wife, Katherine.

He held five United States patents: #3,169,611: Discontinuous Compression Structures, February 1965; #3,276,148: Model for Atomic Forms, October 1966; #4,099,339: Model for Atomic Forms, July 1978; and #6,017,220: Magnetic Geometric Building System; and most recently, #6,739,937: Space Frame Structure Made by 3-D Weaving of Rod Members, May 25, 2004.

Snelson was a founding member of ConStruct, the artist-owned gallery that promoted and organized large-scale sculpture exhibitions throughout the United States. Other founding members include Mark di Suvero, John Raymond Henry, Lyman Kipp and Charles Ginnever. Snelson was also a pioneer of digital art, using a Silicon Graphics machine to produce artistic images in the 1980s. 

After suffering from prostate cancer, Snelson died on December 22, 2016, at the age of 89.

<doc id="874872" wikidata="Q5302363" url="?curid=874872" title="Dov S. Zakheim">
<text>Dov S. Zakheim (born December 18, 1948) is an American businessman, writer, and former official of the United States government. In the Reagan administration, he held various Department of Defense positions. In 2000, Zakheim was a member of &quot;The Vulcans&quot;, a group of foreign policy advisors assisting George W. Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign. From 2001 to 2004 he was Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and Chief Financial Officer of the Department of Defense.

==Early life and education==
Zakheim was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Yeshiva University High School in Brooklyn in 1966. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree Summa Cum Laude in government from Columbia University in 1970 and D.Phil. in economics and politics from the University of Oxford in 1974. He is Jewish. He is an ordained rabbi, having received his ordination from Rabbi Shmuel Walkin.

==Career==
Zakheim joined the United States Department of Defense in 1981 after serving as a principal analyst in the Congressional Budget Office. He served in various Department of Defense posts during the Reagan administration, including Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Planning and Resources from 1985 to 1987. There was some controversy in both the U.S. and Israel over Zakheim&#x27;s involvement in ending the Israeli fighter program, the IAI Lavi. He argued that Israeli and U.S. interests would be best served by having Israel purchase F-16 fighters, rather than investing in an entirely new aircraft. He left government service in 1987 and joined the technology and analysis firm System Planning Corporation as its corporate vice president.

From 1987–2001, Zakheim was CEO of SPC International, a subsidiary of System Planning Corporation, a high-technology analytical firm. During that period, he served as a consultant to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and sat on a number of major Department of Defense panels, including its Task Force on Defense Reform (1997) and the Department of Defense first Board of Visitors of Overseas Regional Centers (1998–2001).

Zakheim was an adjunct professor at the National War College, Yeshiva University, Columbia University, and Trinity College, where he was presidential scholar. Zakheim was an adjunct scholar of The Heritage Foundation, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and has published over 200 articles and monographs on defense-related issues.

Zakheim signed a letter to Bill Clinton about Iraq.

<text>Roots is a 1977 American television miniseries based on Alex Haley&#x27;s 1976 novel &quot;&quot;, set during and after the era of enslavement in the United States. The series first aired on ABC in January 1977 over eight consecutive nights.

A critical and ratings success over the course of its run, &quot;Roots&quot; received 37 Primetime Emmy Award nominations and won nine. It also won a Golden Globe and a Peabody Award. It received unprecedented Nielsen ratings for the finale, which holds the record as the third-highest-rated episode for any type of television series, and the second-most-watched overall series finale in U.S. television history.

A sequel, &quot;&quot;, first aired in 1979, and a second sequel, &quot;&quot;, a Christmas television film, starring LeVar Burton and Louis Gossett Jr., first aired in 1988. A related film, &quot;Alex Haley&#x27;s Queen&quot;, is based on the life of Queen Jackson Haley, who was Alex Haley&#x27;s paternal grandmother.

In 2016, a remake of the original miniseries, with the same name, was commissioned by the History channel and screened by the channel on Memorial Day.

==Plot==

===Colonial times===
In the Gambia, West Africa, in 1750, Kunta Kinte is born to Omoro Kinte, a Mandinka warrior, and his wife Binta. He is raised in a Muslim family.
When Kunta reaches the age of 15, he and other boys undergo a semi-secretive tribal rite of passage, under the Kintango, which includes wrestling, circumcision, philosophy, war-craft, and hunting skills.

Meanwhile, Captain Thomas Davies meets Vilars, the owner of a cargo ship named &quot;Lord Ligonier&quot;, and is given command of the vessel in order to trade goods between England, Africa and America. Only at the last minute is he informed that part of his cargo will consist of African slaves, to his dismay.

During the early voyage, Mr. Slater, First Deck Officer of the ship, pontificates to Davies about slavery. After learning that Slater is an expert in the field, having undertaken many similar voyages previously, Davies eventually grants him total authority and control over all procedures for ensuring their safe and secure passage to America.

When the ship docks in Africa, Slater introduces Davies to the trader and negotiator, Gardner, who is tasked with the capture or purchase of 170 Africans.

Back in Juffure, while still in training, Kunta is instructed to catch a bird unharmed. The bird escapes from the safety of the training area, and during the chase, Kunta crosses paths with Gardner&#x27;s small party of European slave hunters and their captives.

Shortly after his ceremonial return, while fetching wood outside his village to make a drum for his younger brother Lamin, Kunta is captured by Gardner and four black collaborators. He is then sold to a slave trader and placed aboard the slave ship for a three-month journey to Colonial America. The ship eventually leaves Africa with 140 Africans.

During the voyage, Kunta bonds with a Yoruba wrestler who was part of his manhood training, as well as a Mandinka girl named Fanta whom he met shortly before his kidnapping. An insurrection among the human cargo fails to take over the ship, but results in the death of Mr. Slater, several crew members and several Africans, including the wrestler.

The ship eventually arrives in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1767, with 98 Africans still living. The captured Africans are sold at auction as slaves. John Reynolds, a plantation owner from Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near Fredericksburg, buys Kunta and gives him the Christian name Toby. Reynolds assigns an older slave, Fiddler, to teach Kunta English and train him in the ways of servitude. Although Kunta gradually warms up to Fiddler, he wants to preserve his Mandinka (and Islamic) heritage, and he defiantly refuses to eat pork or accept his Christian name.

Kunta makes several unsuccessful attempts to escape, first breaking his ankle chain with a broken tool blade he finds half buried in a field. After this attempt the overseer, Ames, gathers the slaves in the barn, and directs another slave, James, to whip Kunta until he acknowledges his new name &quot;Toby.&quot; Fiddler comforts the bloody-backed Kunta and uses his Mandinka name for the first time, assuring him &quot;there will be another day.&quot;

===Late 18th century===
In 1776, the adult Kunta Kinte, still haunted by his Mandinka roots and desire for freedom, tries again to escape. He makes it to a nearby plantation where his boyhood friend Fanta is a slave, although he discovers after spending the night with her that she has turned away from her African name and heritage in the name of survival. A pair of slave-catchers track him there and hobble him by chopping off almost half his right foot with a hatchet. Exasperated, John Reynolds decides to sell Kunta, which will also settle a debt with his brother Dr. William Reynolds, the local physician. John also transfers several of his other slaves, including Fiddler, to William as well.

Bell, the cook for William&#x27;s family, successfully treats both Kunta&#x27;s mangled foot and wounded spirit. A trusted member of the Reynolds household, she arranges for Kunta to become Dr. Reynolds&#x27; driver. Eventually Kunta submits to a life of servitude, although he never entirely renounces Africa, his faith in Islam, nor his hope of returning home. He marries Bell, in a ceremony which includes jumping across a broom, although his talk of Africa frustrates her. Bell bears a daughter in 1790, to whom Kunta gives the name Kizzy, which means &quot;stay put&quot; in the Mandinka language (in hopes of ensuring that she will never be sold away). Fiddler continues to mentor Kunta, and dies an old man shortly after Kizzy&#x27;s birth.

===Turn of the 19th century===
An adulterous relationship between Dr. William Reynolds and John Reynolds&#x27; wife produces a daughter, Missy Anne, whom John believes is his own. Missy Anne and Kizzy become playmates and best friends despite the social confines of Southern plantation culture. Missy Anne secretly teaches Kizzy to read and write, a skill forbidden to slaves. In 1806, Kizzy falls in love with Noah, a spirited slave who attempts to flee North with a &quot;traveling pass&quot; forged by Kizzy from a pass given to her by Missy Anne.

Dr. Reynolds, although amiable and compassionate toward his slaves, regards the pass and escape to be such an egregious breach of trust that he separately sells both Noah and Kizzy, much to the horror of Bell and Kunta. Missy Anne, who had offered Kizzy a place as her companion and maid, watches dispassionately as Kizzy is dragged away. Tom Moore, a planter in Caswell County, North Carolina, with a sexual appetite for young female slaves, becomes Kizzy&#x27;s new owner, and makes her his concubine the night of her arrival. Kizzy becomes pregnant and gives birth to their son George nine months after her arrival.

===Early 19th century===
In 1824, the cheerful and confident George, under the tutelage of an older slave named Mingo, learns much about cockfighting. By direction of Moore, George takes over as the chief trainer, the &quot;cock of the walk.&quot; George befriends Marcellus, a free black man, and fellow cockfighter, who informs him about the possibility of buying his own freedom. At the same time, he believes Moore to be a close friend.

Meanwhile, the adult Kizzy is wooed by Sam Bennett, a fancy carriage driver whose master is visiting the Moores. Seeking to impress Kizzy, he takes her for a short visit to her former home on Dr. Reynolds&#x27;s plantation, in the hope that she can see her parents. Kizzy learns that Bell has been sold away and that Kunta died two years earlier. Kizzy sees her father&#x27;s grave and his wooden marker; using a small stone, she scratches over the name Toby and writes below it &quot;Kunta Kinte,&quot; and promises him that his descendants will be free one day.

In 1831, George realizes his master&#x27;s true feelings when he and his family are threatened at gunpoint by Moore and his wife, as a result of Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion. Although none of Moore&#x27;s slaves are personally involved in the rebellion, they become victims of the paranoid suspicions of their master, so they start planning to buy their freedom, although Moore tells George he will never allow it. Kizzy finally tells George that Moore is his father.

George, having become an expert in cockfighting, earns for himself the moniker &quot;Chicken George.&quot; Squire James, Moore&#x27;s main adversary in the pit, arranges for a British owner, Sir Eric Russell, and twenty of his cocks to visit and to participate in the local fights. Moore eventually bets a huge sum on his best bird, which George has trained, but he loses and cannot pay.

Under the terms of a settlement between Moore and Russell, George goes to England to train cocks for Russell and to train more trainers and is forced to leave behind Kizzy, his wife Tildy, and his sons, Tom and Lewis. Moore promises to set George free on the latter&#x27;s return and to keep the family together in his absence. However, a now-broke Moore then sells all of his remaining slaves except Kizzy.

Later in life, Kizzy and Missy Anne Reynolds meet by chance one last time. Missy Anne denies that she &quot;recollects&quot; a &quot;darkie by the name of Kizzy.&quot; Kizzy then spits into Missy Anne&#x27;s cup of water without Missy Anne realizing it.

===The Civil War===
George returns in 1861, shortly before the start of the Civil War. He proudly announces that Moore, after some reluctance on Moore&#x27;s part and some persuasion on George&#x27;s part, has kept his word by granting George his freedom. He learns that Kizzy has died two months before, and that Tildy, Tom and Lewis now belong to Sam Harvey. Tom has become a blacksmith on the Harvey plantation and has a wife, Irene, and two sons.

George is welcomed warmly and learns that his relatives have spoken well of him during his absence. He further learns that according to a law in North Carolina, if he stays 60 days in that state as a freed slave, he will lose his freedom, so he heads northward, seeking the next stage in his career as a cockfighter and awaiting the end of the war, the emancipation of the slaves, and another reunion of his family. Meanwhile, Tom meets harassment at the hands of two brothers, Evan and Jemmy Brent.

While the war continues to its inevitable end, a hungry and destitute young white couple from South Carolina, George and Martha Johnson, arrive and ask for help, and the slave family take them in. George Johnson is given a job as overseer of the plantation, but has no experience with slaves and balks at the expectation that he mistreat them. Martha soon gives birth, but the child is stillborn. The couple stays on with Tom and his wife, becoming a part of their community.

Eventually, a month before the surrender by the South, Jemmy deserts the Confederate Army, and he shows up at Tom&#x27;s blacksmith shop. Tom reluctantly runs an errand for him but, on returning, he finds Jemmy trying to rape Irene, and in the resulting fight Tom drowns him in the quenching tub. Later Evan, now an officer in the Confederate cavalry, arrives at the shop, demands to know about Jemmy, gets no answer, and angrily tells Tom that he has not yet finished with him.

=== Postwar ===
After the war, the former owner of the farm Tom works on, Sam Harvey, is forced to surrender all of his property to Senator Arthur Justin, a local politician intent on acquiring as much land as possible. Under the terms of the surrender, his former slaves are allowed to stay on as sharecroppers, with eventual rights to own a part of the land. However, because no written deed has been filed, the senator deems the agreement void and imposes heavy debts on the black farmers as a legal pretext to keep them from leaving the county. He later gives oversight of the farm to Evan Brent, who reinstates George Johnson as overseer, believing whites should not farm alongside blacks.

One night, several local white men, led by Evan and wearing white hoods (made from fabric sacks from Evan&#x27;s store) begin to harass and terrorize Tom, his family, and other members of his community. Tom emerges as the leader among his group, while tensions arise between the white Johnsons and Tom&#x27;s brother Lewis. As the local blacksmith, Tom devises a horseshoeing method to identify the horses involved in the raids by the hooded men. But when Tom reports his suspicions and his evidence to the sheriff, who sympathizes with Evan and knows every member of the white mob, the sheriff tips off Evan.

Evan&#x27;s mob leads another raid against Tom, during which Tom is whipped. George Johnson intervenes and reluctantly volunteers to whip Tom, in order to save his friend&#x27;s life. Lewis emotionally reconciles with the Johnsons as the family treats Tom&#x27;s injuries, unsure of their future. Chicken George then unexpectedly returns, raising the spirits of his relatives and friends, and begins to plot their next step. He reports that he has bought some land in Tennessee.

Using some cunning and deception of their own, the black farmers make preparations for their move away. The group eventually lures Evan and his gang to the farm and overpowers them, jubilantly departing for Tennessee. Chicken George and his group arrive on his land in Henning, Lauderdale County, Tennessee, to start their new life. Once there, George and Tom retell part of the story of Kunta Kinte in Africa to his (George&#x27;s) grandchildren in Tennessee.

==Production==
The miniseries was directed by Marvin J. Chomsky, John Erman, David Greene, and Gilbert Moses. It was produced by Stan Margulies. David L. Wolper was executive producer. The score was composed by Gerald Fried, and Quincy Jones for only the first episode. Many familiar white TV actors, such as Ed Asner (from &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;), Chuck Connors (&quot;The Rifleman&quot;), Lorne Greene (&quot;Bonanza&quot; and later &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;), Robert Reed (&quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;), and Ralph Waite (&quot;The Waltons&quot;) were cast against type as slave holders and traders. ABC television executives &quot;got cold feet&quot; after seeing the brutality depicted in the series and attempted to cut the network&#x27;s predicted losses by airing the series over eight consecutive nights in January in one fell swoop. The Museum of Broadcast Communications recounts the apprehensions that &quot;Roots&quot; would flop, and how this made ABC prepare the format:

==Musical score and soundtrack==
The majority of the miniseries&#x27; score, including the main &quot;Mural&quot; theme heard during the opening credits, was by veteran composer Gerald Fried. Quincy Jones contributed music for the first episode, however, and he and Fried each earned an Emmy for their work on that installment.

An album titled &quot;Roots: The Saga of an American Family&quot;, featuring music from and inspired by the program and re-arranged and conducted by Jones, became a hit for A&amp;M in 1977. The original soundtrack was released the following year.

In explaining the impetus for Jones&#x27; version, AllMusic critic Richard S. Ginell noted that the composer &quot;has been threatening to write a long tone poem sketching the history of black music for decades now, and he has yet to do it. This project, rushed out in the wake of the 1977 TV miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;, is about as close as he has come. A brief (28 minutes) immaculately produced and segued suite, &quot;Roots&quot; quickly traces a timeline from Africa to the Civil War, incorporating ancient and modern African influences (with Letta Mbulu as the featured vocalist), a sea shanty, field hollers and fiddle tunes, snippets of dialogue from &quot;Roots&quot; actor Lou Gossett, and some Hollywood-style movie cues. ... Though some prominent jazzers turn up in the orchestra, there is not a trace of jazz to be heard. This is a timely souvenir of a cultural phenomenon, but merely a curiosity for jazz fans&quot;.

===Charts and certifications===

==Reception==
The series received positive reviews. Review aggregator website, &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; later rated it 76% &quot;fresh&quot; based on 32 reviews, with the critic&#x27;s consensus stating &quot;Roots may shave off the nuances of Alex Haley&#x27;s landmark book for the sake of slicker storytelling, but excellent performances and the intrinsic power of this generational tale make for revelatory television.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; reviewed it positively, summarizing, &quot;The production and performances are strong, with newcomer LeVar Burton effective as the African youngster trapped into slavery. Edward Asner, as he did in &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; a year ago, dominates the screen in his opening scenes.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;Roots&quot; as the #10 greatest TV show of all time.

<text>Superchick, originally known as Superchic[k], was an American Christian rock/alternative pop band that debuted in 1999 and disbanded in 2013. Their music incorporated various styles such as pop, punk, rock, rap, and R&amp;B. Their sound has been compared to mainstream artists like No Doubt and Avril Lavigne only with a heavier sound. Superchick has had five songs reach No. 1 on music charts, and their song &quot;Stand in the Rain&quot; held the No. 1 spot for nine weeks on &quot;R&amp;R&quot; Christian Hit Radio (CHR) chart in 2006/2007.

==History==

===1999: Debut ===
Superchick made their debut in 1999 at an Audio Adrenaline concert in front of an audience of 5,000. They continued to perform at live events throughout that year.

===Early 2000s: &quot;Karaoke Superstars&quot; and &quot;Last One Picked&quot;===
Superchick self-released their first album in 2000. The album was re-released with three added remix tracks after they signed to Inpop Records, and became their first official album: &quot;Karaoke Superstars&quot;. Since then, their music has appeared in several movies and television shows, including the 2001 movie &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;, the 2002 made for TV Disney movie &quot;Cadet Kelly&quot;, and the 2009 movie &quot;To Save a Life&quot;. &quot;Last One Picked&quot; was released on October 8, 2002.

===Mid-2000s: &quot;Beauty from Pain&quot;===
Superchick signed with mainstream record label Columbia Records to promote their 2005 album &quot;Beauty from Pain&quot;, resulting in their 2006 mainstream debut &quot;Beauty from Pain 1.1&quot;. The re-release album contains their signature hit &quot;Stand in the Rain&quot;. Their music has received favorable reviews in both Christian and mainstream publications.

===Late 2000s: Grammy nomination and &quot;Rock What You Got&quot;===

<doc id="874889" wikidata="Q58754" url="?curid=874889" title="Doha International Airport">
<text>Doha International Airport () is an airport in Doha, Qatar. It was Qatar&#x27;s commercial international airport until Hamad International Airport opened on 27 May 2014. While all scheduled commercial traffic ceased, the airport site and existing runway are still used by Qatar Emiri Air Force, Qatar Amiri Flight, Rizon Jet, Gulf Helicopters and Qatar Aeronautical College. It also acts as a state/diplomatic airport catering to both Qatar Amiri Flight (which is based at the airport) and state-visit flights. The airport welcomed commercial flights again on 15 September 2022 for selected airlines to handle increased traffic for the 2022 FIFA World Cup that Qatar hosted in November.

==History==

Doha International Airport opened in 1959 replacing Dukhan Airport, which was built in the 1930s. That had been the secondary hub for the Bahraini-based Gulf Air, and was located west of Doha, and south-west of Dukhan. 

The airport suffered from overutilization, even though it had been expanded numerous times. Before the opening of the new airport, the capacity stood at 12 million passengers per year. Its runway was one of the longest at a civil airport. It was the main base of Qatar Airways. In the past, the airport was mostly used by Qatari holiday makers and foreign workers coming for the oil and gas sector. As Qatar Airways expanded rapidly, the airport grew and attracted more people such as holiday makers and transit travelers. In 2010, it was the world&#x27;s 27th busiest airport by cargo traffic. The control tower and ancillary buildings were designed by Curtis W. Fentress, FAIA, RIBA of Fentress Architects.

All scheduled commercial air traffic serving this airport moved to the new Hamad International Airport on 27 May 2014. The new airport is located east of the former facility. It covers of land and was able to handle 29 million passengers per year on opening day. The old airport was originally planned to be demolished, but it was refurbished and reopened for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and certain charter flights.

==Terminals==

=== Departure and Transfer Terminal ===
This was the main terminal at Doha and handled all economy class Qatar Airways flights, as well as all other airlines using the airport. This terminal was expanded several times in order to cope with the increasing number of passengers using the airport each year. The terminal had 44 satellite gates, as well as seating areas and a large duty-free area. There were 3 lounges in this terminal, including the Oryx Lounge, which was used by all foreign airlines&#x27; premium passengers, the Qatar Airways Gold Lounge, which was used by Qatar Airways Gold Privilege Club members, and the Qatar Airways Silver Lounge, used by Qatar Airways silver privilege club card holders. This terminal had been expanded as the old Arrivals Terminal was integrated into the departures terminal, while a new arrival terminal was opened. All departing and transferring passengers used this facility, as passengers arriving into Doha used the new Arrivals Terminal. The Departure and Transfer Terminal opened an additional 12 boarding positions located between the terminal and the Premium Terminal gates, as well as a revamped Oryx lounge to cater for the increase in passenger numbers. The passenger facilities featured 60 check-in counters, 42 parking bays for aircraft and 15 baggage claim belts.

====Terminal A====
Terminal A of the Departure and Transfer Terminal was the check-in area used by the airport&#x27;s biggest user, Qatar Airways, as well as Cathay Pacific, which operated a codeshare with Qatar Airways to Hong Kong under a strategic partnership agreement.

====Terminal B====
In June 2011, Terminal B, built on the location of the former arrivals terminal at Doha International Airport, was dedicated to more than 30 foreign airlines operating services from Doha. The terminal included an enlarged check-in area with 35 counters and a new baggage handling system, as well as food outlets. All foreign airlines were moved to Terminal B.

All terminals have been renovated recently and will be operational by the end 2021 or early to mid-2022 for the FIFA football World Cup that will be held in Qatar.

=== Arrivals Terminal ===
On 19 December 2010, a new Arrival Terminal was opened in the western apron, in the site of the former Asian Games (which Doha hosted in 2006) temporary terminal. The terminal had a capacity of 2,770 passengers per hour. The Arrivals Terminal replaced the arrivals hall of what became the Departure and Transfer Terminal. The Arrivals Terminal had 22 immigration counters, eight e-gates, eight baggage carousels, 36 concierge desks for hotel transfers, car rental and other services, as well as 746 parking spaces. The former arrivals hall was merged with the departing hall, adding extra valuable space and capacity to the airport. These changes were part of the multimillion-dollar expansion of Doha Airport to cope with the increasing traffic of Qatar Airways and other airlines before the new Hamad International Airport opened in 2014.

=== Qatar Airways Premium Terminal ===
The Qatar Airways Premium Terminal was opened in 2006 and handled all Qatar Airways first and business class passengers. There are 6 gates in this terminal.

== Airlines and destinations ==

The airport shut down for commercial traffic on 27 May 2014 when all airlines relocated to its successor, Hamad International Airport. The last commercial flight departing from Doha International Airport was a Lufthansa plane returning to its home base of Frankfurt at 00:30 on 28 May 2014.

On 14 September 2022, the airport was temporarily reopened for passenger traffic to relieve congestion at Hamad airport due to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. At least 13 airlines, including Etihad Airways, Flydubai, Pegasus Airlines, Jazeera Airways, Pakistan International Airlines and SalamAir moved their regular scheduled flights to the airport until shortly after the end of the World Cup. Designated Match Day Shuttle flights used the newer Hamad airport instead. All flights to the older airport came to a halt after the World Cup was over.

==Statistics==
Since 1998, the number of passengers and total cargo load increased significantly.
==Accidents and incidents==
*On 13 March 1979, an Alia Royal Jordanian Boeing 727 operating Flight 600 crashed following a missed approach. Three crew members and 42 passengers were killed. The aircraft was written off.
*In 2000, an Iraqi hijacker hijacked a Qatar Airways plane and demanded that the pilot fly to Saudi Arabia. The passengers and crew escaped unharmed when the man surrendered at Hael.

<text>Michel du Cille (January 24, 1956 – December 11, 2014) was a Jamaican-born American photojournalist who won three Pulitzer Prizes. He shared the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography with fellow &quot;Miami Herald&quot; staff photographer Carol Guzy for their coverage of the November 1985 eruption of Colombia&#x27;s Nevado del Ruiz volcano. He won the 1988 Feature Photography Pulitzer for a photo essay on crack cocaine addicts in a Miami housing project (&quot;photographs portraying the decay and subsequent rehabilitation of a housing project overrun by the drug crack&quot;). &quot;The Washington Post&quot; received the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for his work, with reporters Dana Priest and Anne Hull, &quot;in exposing mistreatment of wounded veterans at Walter Reed Hospital, evoking a national outcry and producing reforms by federal officials.&quot;

Du Cille was a photo editor for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; from 1988 until June 2005, when he became the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; senior photographer. He held a Bachelor of Journalism from Indiana University and a Master&#x27;s in Journalism from Ohio University.
Du Cille was born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1956. He worked as a photojournalism intern at &quot;The Louisville Courier Journal/Times&quot; and &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; in 1979 and 1980 and joined the &quot;Herald&quot; staff in 1981.

In October 2014, the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University disinvited du Cille from appearing at a workshop because he&#x27;d returned three weeks earlier from covering the Ebola outbreak in Liberia. Du Cille said at the time, &quot;It&#x27;s a disappointment to me. I&#x27;m pissed off and embarrassed and completely weirded out that a journalism institution that should be seeking out facts and details is basically pandering to hysteria.&quot;

Du Cille died December 11, 2014, from an apparent heart attack at the age of 58 while on assignment in Liberia.

<doc id="874901" wikidata="Q7562334" url="?curid=874901" title="Sons of Odin">
<text>Various gods and men appear as sons of [[Odin]] (, ) in Old Norse and Old English texts.

==Thor, Baldr, Víðarr and Váli==
Four gods, Thor, Baldr, Víðarr and Váli, are explicitly identified as sons of Odin in the Eddic poems, in the skaldic poems, in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, and in the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; section of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. But silence on the matter does not indicate that other gods whose parentage is not mentioned in these works might not also be sons of Odin.

==Other gods called sons of Odin by Snorri Sturluson==
In various kennings recorded in the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; section of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Snorri also describes Heimdallr, Bragi, Týr, Höðr, and Hermóðr as sons of Odin, information that appears nowhere else outside &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;.

# For Heimdall, there is no variant account of his father.
# The same may not be true for Bragi if Bragi is taken to be the skaldic poet Bragi Boddason made into a god.
# But Týr, according to the Eddic poem &quot;Hymiskviða&quot;, was son of the giant Hymir rather than a son of Odin.
# As to Höðr, outside of the single statement in the kennings, Snorri makes no mention that Höðr is Baldr&#x27;s brother or Odin&#x27;s son, though one might expect that to be emphasized. In Saxo&#x27;s version of the death of Baldr, Höðr, whom Saxo calls Høtherus, is a mortal and in no way related to Saxo&#x27;s demi-god Balderus.
# Hermóðr appears in Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; as the messenger sent by Odin to Hel to seek to bargain for Baldr&#x27;s release. He is called &quot;son&quot; of Odin in most manuscripts, but in the Codex Regius version—the Codex Regius is normally considered the best manuscript—Hermóðr is called &quot;sveinn Óðins&quot;, &#x27;Odin&#x27;s boy&#x27;, which might mean Odin&#x27;s son but in the context is as likely to mean Odin&#x27;s servant. However, when Hermóðr arrives in Hel&#x27;s hall, he calls Baldr his brother. To confuse matters, other texts know of a mortal hero named Hermóðr or Heremod.

==An alternative list of Odin&#x27;s sons==
In the &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot; section of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, there is a list of the sons of Odin, which does not altogether fit with what Snorri writes elsewhere. &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot; is not in all manuscripts of the &quot;Edda&quot; and appear independently, and are probably a later addition to Snorri&#x27;s original composition.

&quot;Nafnaþulur&quot; is omitted from some editions and translations, but it is included in Anthony Faulkes&#x27; 1982 translation. The text from Faulkes&#x27; translation reads:
&quot;Odin&#x27;s sons are Baldr and Meili, Vidar and Nep, Vali, Ali, Thor and Hildolf, Hermod, Sigi, Skiold, Yngvi-Freyr and Itreksiod, Heimdall, Sæming.&quot;

This list includes:
*the 4 gods who are most widely attested as sons of Odin (Thor, Baldr, Víðarr and Váli; see above);
*2 other gods mentioned as sons of Odin in kennings in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (Hermóðr and Heimdall; see above);
*4 men who are the origin of Scandinavian royal dynasties (Sigi, Skjöldr, Yngvi and Sæmingr; see below). All appear in Snorri&#x27;s pseudo-historical Prologue to the Prose Edda as sons of Odin and founders of these various lineages, perhaps all thought to be sons of Odin begotten on mortal women;
*5 other figures (Meili, Nepr, Hildólfr, Ali, Ítreksjóð):
**Meili is mentioned in the eddic poem &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot;, where Thor calls himself Odin&#x27;s son, Meili&#x27;s brother, and Magni&#x27;s father.
**In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Nepr is the father of Baldur&#x27;s wife Nanna. If this list is correct in giving Odin a son named Nep, and if that Nep is identical to the father of Nanna mentioned by Snorri, then Nanna would also be Baldur&#x27;s niece. But marriage between uncle and niece, though common in many cultures, does not normally appear in old Scandinavian literature.
**The name Hildólfr appears in the eddic poem &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot;, applied by the ferryman Hárbarðr to his supposed master. But Harbard is actually Odin in disguise and there is no clear reference here to a son of Odin.
**In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Ali is only another name for Váli.
**The otherwise unrecorded Ítreksjóð, meaning &quot;offspring of Ítrekr&quot;, may be a reference to any of the sons of Odin. &quot;Ít-rekr&quot; (&quot;glorious ruler&quot;) is a name of Odin.

Týr, Höðr, and Bragi are conspicuously absent from this list, despite being mentioned as sons of Odin elsewhere in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. This is one reason to believe it is not from Snorri&#x27;s hand. Some manuscripts have a variant version of the list which adds &quot;Höðr and Bragi&quot; to the end and replaces Yngvi-Frey with an otherwise unknown Ölldner or Ölner. This may be an attempt to bring the list into accord with Snorri, even though it still lacks Týr. Some manuscripts add additional names of sons of Odin which are otherwise unknown: &quot;Ennelang, Eindride, Bior, Hlodide, Hardveor, Sönnöng, Vinthior, Rymur.&quot;
==Founders of dynasties==
The prologue to Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Edda&quot; and the alternative list discussed above both include the following:
* Sigi. He was made the ancestor of the Völsung lineage (see Völsunga saga), who were Burgundian kings according to Snorri.
* Skjöld. He was ancestor of the Danish Skjölding dynasty. In Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Ynglinga Saga&quot; in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Skjöld&#x27;s wife is the goddess Gefjön and the same account occurs in most, but not all, manuscripts of the &quot;Edda&quot;. But Saxo makes Skjöld the son of Lother son of Dan. And in English tradition, Skjöld (called Scyld or Sceldwa) is son of Sceafa or of Heremod when a father is named.
* Yngvi. A son of Odin in the prologue to the &quot;Edda&quot; but identified with Frey son of Njörd in the &quot;Ynglinga Saga&quot;. In both accounts, this figure is made ancestor of the Yngling dynasty in Sweden (from which later kings of Norway also traced their descent). (A Faroese ballad recorded in 1840 names Odin&#x27;s son as Veraldur, this Veraldur being understood as another name of Frö, that is of Frey.)
* Sæming. Sæming is ancestor of a line of Norwegian kings. Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Ynglinga Saga&quot; relates that after the giantess Skaði broke off her marriage with Njörd, she &quot;married afterwards Odin, and had many sons by him, of whom one was called Sæming&quot; from whom Jarl Hákon claimed descent. Snorri then quotes a relevant verse by the poet Eyvindr skáldaspillir. However, in his preface to the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Snorri says that Eyvindr&#x27;s &quot;Háleygjatal&quot; which reckoned up the ancestors of Jarl Hákon brought in Sæming as son of Yngvi-Frey. Snorri may have slipped here, thinking of the Ynglings. As to the many sons, it is possible that some of the otherwise unknown sons in the previous section may be sons purportedly born by Skadi.

According to &quot;Herrauds saga&quot;:
* Gauti. Gauti&#x27;s son Hring ruled Östergötland (East Götaland), so Gauti appears to be the eponym of the Geatas in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Some versions of the English royal line of Wessex add names above that of Woden, purportedly giving Woden&#x27;s ancestry, though the names are now usually thought be in fact another royal lineage that has been at some stage erroneously pasted onto the top of the standard genealogy. Some of these genealogies end in Geat, whom it is reasonable to think might be Gauti. The account in the &quot;Historia Britonum&quot; calls Geat a son of a god, which fits. But Asser, in his &quot;Life of Alfred,&quot; writes instead that the pagans worshipped this Geat himself for a long time as a god. In Old Norse texts, Gaut is itself a very common byname for Odin. Jordanes, in &quot;The origin and deeds of the Goths,&quot; traces the line of the Amelungs up to Hulmul son of Gapt, purportedly the first Gothic hero of record. This &quot;Gapt&quot; is felt by many commentators to be an error for &quot;Gaut&quot; or &quot;Gauti&quot;.

According to &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heidreks konungs&quot; (&quot;The Saga of Hervor and King Heidrek&quot;) versions H and U:
* Sigrlami. He was son of Odin and king of Gardariki. His son Svafrlami succeeded him. Svafrlami forced the dwarves Dvalinn and Durin to forge for him a superb sword, Tyrfing. They did so and cursed it. In version R, Sigrlami takes on the role of Svafrlami and his parentage is not given.

In the prologue to the &quot;Edda,&quot; Snorri also mentions sons of Odin who ruled among the continental Angles and Saxons and provides information about their descendants that is identical, or very close, to traditions recorded in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. Snorri here may be dependent on English traditions. The sons mentioned by both Snorri and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; are:

* Vegdagr/Wægdæg/Wecta. According to Snorri, Vegdeg ruled East Saxony. In the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,&quot; the &quot;Wecta&quot; form of the name heads the lineage of the kings of Kent (of whom Hengest is traditionally the first), and the Wægdæg form of the name heads the lineage of the kings of Deira. The Anglian collection of Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies places the name Wægdæg in both pedigrees, while Snorri relates a single descent through Vegdeg and his son that later splits into two branches leading to the Kent and Deira ancestors.
* Beldeg. According to Snorri&#x27;s prologue, Beldeg was identical to Baldur and ruled in Westphalia. There is no independent evidence of the identification of Beldeg with Baldur. From Beldeg, the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; traces the kings of Bernicia and Wessex. &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; derives the kings of Deira from Beldeg rather than from Wægdæg.

Other Anglo-Saxon genealogies mention:

* Weothulgeot or Wihtlæg. According to the genealogies in the &quot;Anglian collection&quot;, Weothulgeot was ancestor to the royal house of Mercia and the father of Wihtlæg. According to the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, Weothulgeot was father of Weaga, who was father of Wihtlæg. But the two &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; versions of this genealogy include neither Weothulgeot nor Weaga, but make Wihtlæg himself the son of Woden. In all versions, Wihtlæg is father of Wermund, father of Offa of Angel. According to the Old English poem &quot;Widsith&quot;, Offa ruled over the continental Angles. Saxo, though not mentioning Wihtlæg&#x27;s parentage, introduces Wihtlæg as a Danish king named Wiglek, who was the slayer of Amleth (Hamlet).
* Casere (Kjárr). He was made ancestor to the royal house of East Anglia and is thought to represent none other than Julius Caesar.
* Winta. He was made ancestor to the royal house of Lindsey/Lindisfarne. This genealogy is found only in the &quot;Anglian collection&quot;, not in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;.
* Seaxnēat. Made ancestor of the kings of Essex. He is mentioned as Saxnôte alongside Uuôden (Wodan) and Thunaer (Thunor) in the Old Dutch/Saxon Baptismal Vow. He was originally at the top of the Essex pedigree, and only later was made son of Woden to harmonize with the other Anglo-Saxon royal pedigrees.

==Froger==
Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (Book 4) speaks of Froger, the King of Norway, who was a great champion. Saxo relates:
According to some, he was the son of Odin, and when he begged the immortal gods to grant him a boon, received the privilege that no man should conquer him, save he who at the time of the conflict could catch up in his hand the dust lying beneath Froger&#x27;s feet.
King Fródi the Active of Denmark, still a young man, learning of the charm, begged Froger to give him lessons in fighting. When the fighting court had been marked off, Fródi entered with glorious gold-hilted sword and clad in a golden breastplate and helmet. Fródi then begged a boon from Froger, that they might change positions and arms. Froger agreed. After the exchange, Fródi caught up some dust from where Froger had been standing and then quickly defeated Froger in battle and slew him.

==Loki in modern literature==
In modern literature (such as Marvel Comics) it has become popular to portray Loki as the adopted son of Odin. This however has no basis in Norse mythology, where Loki is portrayed as the blood brother of Odin, as mentioned in &quot;Lokasenna&quot;:

<text>The Gwiriko Kingdom (Dyula: &quot;Masaya Gwiriko&quot;), also spelled Gouiriko, was a kingdom in the 18th and 19th centuries in what is now part of present-day Burkina Faso around the watershed of the River Banifin. It was founded by Famagan Ouattara (Wattara) and lasted until French occupation in 1897. Its chief city was Bobo-Dioulasso.

==Historiography==
The nature of the Gwiriko polity is debated by historians. Juula elders in the region do not retain a historical tradition of any kingdom of that name, yet since its inclusion in Dominique Traore&#x27;s 1937 paper &#x27;Notes sur le royaume mandingue de Bobo&#x27; it has appeared in numerous historians&#x27; accounts. The early history of this kingdom is also recorded in the Ghunja Chronicle (&quot;Kitab al-Ghunja&quot;).

The word &quot;Gwiriko&quot; and its variant &quot;Gbirinko&quot; mean &quot;at the end of the long stage&quot;, or alternatively &quot;beyond the forest&quot;, in the Dyula language. The term, therefore, may have been a term for the remote lands far from the center of Ouattara power in Kong rather than denoting a specific territory.

==History==
In the early 18th century, Sékou Ouattara took control of the city of Kong and expanded his influence, creating the Kong Empire. In about 1714, Seku&#x27;s brother Famagan Ouattara established the Kingdom of Gwiriko in the bend of the Mouhoun River, acting as a representative of Seku but with a high degree of independence. At Seku&#x27;s death around 1740, Famagah refused to pay allegiance to Sekou Ouattara&#x27;s sons and seized the area which included Tiefo, Dafin, and Bwamu. He allied with the Bobo-Juula, and established a state. His successors faced repeated revolts which were put down by violent repression.

After the succeeding leader, Diori Ouattara, died in 1839, the state collapsed, and the Tiefo, Bobo Joola, Bolon, and other peoples became independent. Bako Moru stemmed the collapse by allying with the Tiéfo and Bobo Joola. In a battle at in the 1860s, the army of &quot;faama&quot; Daula Traoré of Kenedougou was defeated and his son Tieba was captured and later sold as a slave.

Guimbe Ouattara (c 1836–1919), daughter of Diori Ouattara, was a noted leader in campaigns against the Kénédougou Kingdom and Noumoudara in this era. 

During the reign of Ali Dyan (1854–1878) and his successor Kokoro Dyan, the central state lost control of the state and groups such as the Tyefo took control of the land. By the late 1800s, Gwiriko was pressed on many sides and in 1897, Pintieba Ouattara was installed to replace Tieba Ouattara by the French when Pintieba made a deal with French commandant Paul Caudrelier. Thereafter, the influence of the state quickly waned and while Pintieba and his successor Karamoko Ouattara held the title of King until 1915, by that time the state no longer existed.

<text>University station is an MTR station located near the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Ma Liu Shui. It is located between and / stations on the . This station was the first post-war station to open on the line, and has the most curved track of any MTR station.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Construction of the station, initially named Ma Liu Shui after the locality in which it is situated, began in January 1955. It was completed in August 1955. There had been a longstanding need to build a passing place along the stretch of track between Tai Po and Sha Tin, as the railway was only single-track at that time, and it was convenient to build a station at the same time to serve the new Chung Chi College.

The new station comprised &quot;a single storeyed station building, a flush latrine, 1,250 linear feet of platforms and a loop line of 1,900 linear feet&quot;. The opening was delayed due to the late arrival of signalling equipment ordered through the Crown Agents.

The station finally came into operation on 24 September 1956, at that time served by three up-trains and three down-trains daily. Though the Chinese University of Hong Kong was not founded until 1963, the adjacent Chung Chi College would become part of the new university in 1963, and would form the basis of CUHK&#x27;s campus. The station was given its present name on 1 January 1967. In 1983, its tracks were electrified along with the rest of the KCR East Rail .

A Chinese goods wagon derailed north of the station at around 2:00 p.m. on 4 June 1988. Nobody was injured, but the derailment led to thousands being stranded at University, Tai Po Market, and Fo Tan stations, leading to an &quot;almost hysterical scramble for road transport&quot;. At 5:00 p.m. a lorry overturned in the northbound carriageway of the Lion Rock Tunnel. Together, the accidents caused a &quot;great stoppage&quot; in Kowloon and the eastern New Territories, leading to anger and fights at massive queues for taxi ranks and bus stations. The Police Tactical Unit was dispatched to University station.

=== 2000 expansion ===
Originally, the station was the smallest in the system. In the early 1990s, the new town of Ma On Shan was developed on the other side of Tolo Harbour, and it seemed inefficient to make residents there go all the way to to catch a train. Therefore, university station was expanded at a cost of $72.4 million, becoming an important interchange between buses and minibuses from Ma On Shan and the East Rail line. Construction began in late 1998 and the expanded station, designed by Leigh &amp; Orange, was officially opened in October 2000. The total floor area of the station concourses increased from 800 square metres to 2,000 square metres. Four years later, in December 2004, the Ma On Shan rail opened to provide Ma On Shan with direct railway service. As a consequence, University station&#x27;s importance to residents of Ma On Shan was strongly diminished.

=== New station entrance ===
A new exit D opened at the north end of the station in 2012 to serve several newly opened teaching buildings nearby. The structure was awarded LEED silver precertification for features such as natural daytime lighting, rainwater storage for irrigation, natural ventilation, and furniture made from recycled railway sleepers. The entrance is unusual on the MTR system in that it opens directly onto a platform rather than a concourse level, meaning that it is convenient only for those using northbound trains because there is no way to cross the tracks at that area. To access southbound trains from exit D, passengers must walk the length of the platform to cross the tracks using the exit A/B concourse.

== Safety ==

The platform is built along a curve, causing gaps of a range of different sizes to exist while the trains are lined up to the platform. The KCRC responded to these complaints by assuring passengers that they will install plates on the side of platforms to reduce the gap, though this has not been done.

After two incidents of children falling onto the tracks at University station in 1985, the issue was discussed in the Legislative Council. The Secretary for Transport asserted that the gaps were within &quot;international safety limits&quot;, and that the gap could not be narrowed due to the curvature of the station as well as the &quot;rather wider bodies&quot; of the Chinese through trains which run through the station daily. A man who fractured his leg boarding a train at the station in 2008 asserted that he fell into a gap of about 35 cm, while the MTR claimed it was only 22 cm at the relevant section of platform.

Today, the station is one of three on the network marked with special signage noting the &quot;gap black spots&quot;. The platform edge is outfitted with flashing neon lighting and &quot;&quot; (mind the gap) decals, and typically there are several staff on duty on the platform. This station, along with the other stations along the East Rail Line, will eventually receive platform edge doors as part of a retrofitting program.

<text>A variety of magical creatures are depicted in the fictional universe of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, which is drawn from various types of media. Magical creatures appear in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels and their film adaptations, in the &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; film series, in other books by J. K. Rowling, and on the website of the Wizarding World media franchise. In 2001, Rowling released &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot;, which serves as a guidebook to the creatures described in the fictional universe. Some of these creatures were invented by Rowling. Others are derived from sources such as Greek mythology, English and Celtic folklore, and the works of Roman historians.

In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe, Magizoology is the study of magical creatures. There are magizoologists who work in the Ministry of Magic, particularly in the department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. One notable magizoologist is Newt Scamander, who is the author of the in-universe book &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot;. He is the protagonist of the &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; series of films, which serve as prequels to the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series.

<text>Ouest-France ( ; French for &quot;West-France&quot;) is a daily French newspaper known for its emphasis on both local and national news. The paper is produced in 47 different editions covering events in different French départements within the régions of Brittany, Lower Normandy and Pays de la Loire. Its readership has been unaffected by the decline of newspaper reading in France, unlike most other dailies.

With 2.5 million daily readers (and a circulation of almost 800 000 units), it is by far the most read francophone newspaper in the world, ahead of French national newspapers &quot;Le Figaro&quot; and &quot;Le Monde&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Ouest-France&quot; was founded in 1944 by Adolphe Le Goaziou and others following the closure of &quot;Ouest-Éclair&quot;, which was banned by Liberation forces for collaborationism during the war. It is based in Rennes and Nantes and has a circulation about 792,400 (greater than any French national daily newspaper), mostly in Brittany.

Its editorial line has been strongly pro-European integration from the beginning, influenced by Christian democracy (Popular Republican Movement), now MoDem, Nouveau Centre or Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). With 2.52 million readers, Ouest-France is also the leading French-language daily in the world.

The paper had a circulation of 773,471 copies in 2001 and 764,731 copies in 2002 with a market share of 14.41%. The paper had a circulation of 637,463 copies in 2020. 

===The distinct editions===
The 47 different editions are divided among twelve départements :

<text>Arsi () is a zone in Oromia Region of Ethiopia, named after a clan of the Oromo, who inhabit in the area.

Arsi is bordered on the south by Bale Zone, on the southwest by the West Arsi Zone, on the northwest by East Shewa Zone, on the north by the Afar Region and on the east by West Hararghe Zone. It covers an area of 19,825.22 km2, divided into 25 districts (&quot;weredas&quot;). The population was officially estimated at 3,894,248 in mid 2022. The highest point in Arsi Zone is Mount Chilalo; other notable mountains in this zone include Mount Kaka and Mount Gugu. Arsi Mountains National Park was created in 2011 to protect a section of the mountains. The administrative centre of this zone is in Asela, with an estimated 139,537 inhabitants in mid 2022; other towns in this zone (with estimated populations in mid 2022) include Bokoji (36,805) in Limuna Bilbilo District, Robe (31,445) in Robe District, Etaya (31,094) in Hitosa District, Dera (30,676) in Dodota District, Abomsa (30,377) in Merti District, Hurta (27,523) in Lude Hitosa District, Sagure (24,932) in Digeluna Tijo District, and Kersa (23,313) in Munesa District. Some districts in the southwestern part of this zone were separated from Arsi Zone to create a new West Arsi Zone.

In 2014, a monument has been erected to remember the victims.

== Economy ==
Coffee has been a major cash crop in Arsi as early as 1912, when two Belgian companies were granted concessions of 1,464 hectares of land for cultivating coffee in the area of the current Zone. After World War I, these companies encountered financial difficulties and merged, and harvested as much as 613 tons of coffee at their peak (1931-21). The Central Statistical Agency (CSA), reported that 2198 tons of coffee were produced in this zone in the year ending in 2005, based on inspection records from the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea authority. This represents 1.9% of the Region&#x27;s output and 0.97% of Ethiopia&#x27;s total output. Arsi University was established in 2014 at Asella.
