<text>Alchemilla is a genus of herbaceous perennial plants in the family Rosaceae, with the common name lady&#x27;s mantle applied generically as well as specifically to &quot;Alchemilla mollis&quot; when referred to as a garden plant. The plant used as a herbal tea or for medicinal usage such as gynaecological disorders is &quot;Alchemilla xanthochlora&quot; or in Middle Europe the so-called common lady&#x27;s mantle &quot;Alchemilla vulgaris&quot;. There are about 700 species, the majority native to cool temperate and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia, with a few species native to the mountains of Africa and the Americas.

Most species of &quot;Alchemilla&quot; are clump-forming or mounded perennials with basal leaves arising from woody rhizomes. Some species have leaves with lobes that radiate from a common point and others have divided leaves—both are typically fan-shaped with small teeth at the tips. The long-stalked, gray-green to green leaves are often covered with soft hairs, and show a high degree of water-resistance (see Lotus effect). Green to bright chartreuse flowers are small, have no petals and appear in clusters above the foliage in late spring and summer.

<text>Alisma plantago-aquatica, also known as European water-plantain, common water-plantain or mad-dog weed, is a perennial flowering aquatic plant widespread across most of Europe and Asia, and apparently spread elsewhere in both the Old and New World.

==Description==
&quot;Alisma plantago-aquatica&quot; is a hairless plant that grows in shallow water, consists of a fibrous root, several basal long stemmed leaves long, and a triangular stem up to tall. It has branched inflorescence bearing numerous small flowers, across, with three round or slightly jagged, white or pale purple petals. The flowers open in the afternoon. There are three blunt green sepals and six stamens per flower. The carpels often exist as a flat single whorl. It flowers from June until August. The fruits appear as a ring of seeds inside each flower.

=== Chemistry ===
Chemical constituents of —rhizomes of &quot;Alisma orientale&quot; (syn. &quot;Alisma &quot; var. &quot;orientale&quot;) as a traditional Chinese medicine—include alisol A 24-acetate and alisol B 23-acetate. The content of these two compounds are significantly different in of different areas.

=== Similar species ===
Narrow-leaved water plantain &quot;Alisma lanceolatum&quot; differs only in that the leaf tips are acuminate and shape is narrow lanceolate.

According to some sources, presumed specimens found in North America are actually the similar &quot;A. subcordatum&quot; and &quot;A. trivale&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The word &quot;alisma&quot; is said to be a word of Celtic origin meaning &quot;water&quot;, a reference to the habitat in which it grows. Early botanists named it after the &quot;Plantago&quot; because of the similarity of their leaves.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is widespread across most of Europe and Asia from Portugal and Morocco to Japan, Kamchatka and Vietnam. It is also regarded as native in northern and central Africa as far south as Tanzania, and in Australia. It is reportedly naturalized in southern Africa, New Zealand, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington state and Connecticut. Some sources maintain that the species is widespread across North America, but these reports appear to have been based on misidentified specimens. It is found on mud or in fresh waters.

==Uses==
The rootstocks contain starch and can be boiled or soaked to remove bitterness before eating. Aquatic plants in general should be cooked before consumption to kill parasites.

According to &quot;Flora of the U.S.S.R.&quot; (1934), &quot;A powder prepared from dried roots is used in popular medicine as a cure for rabies and crushed leaves are used against mammary congestion; fresh leaves are employed in homeopathy.&quot; &quot;... Since this species is often confounded or identified with others of the genus, the reported data may also refer to [&quot;A. orientale&quot; or &quot;A. lanceolatum&quot;].&quot; &quot;A. &quot; is also known as &quot;mad-dog weed&quot;, as if it could be used to cure rabies, but should not be confused with &quot;Scutellaria lateriflora&quot; (mad-dog skullcap), which is also sometimes called &quot;mad-dog weed&quot;.

&quot;Alisma orientale&quot; is sometimes treated as a variety of this species (&quot;A. &quot; var. &quot;orientale&quot;). The rhizomes of &quot;A. orientale&quot; have been used as a traditional Chinese medicine, &quot;ze xie&quot;. However, it may have serious side effects or even toxic effects such as hepatotoxicity in patients with chronic hepatitis&quot; &quot;B.

<doc id="900011" wikidata="Q154611" url="?curid=900011" title="Interwar period">
<text>In the history of the 20th century, the interwar period (&quot;[[Interbellum Generation|interbellum]]&quot;) lasted from 11 November 1918 to 1 September 1939 (20 years, 9 months, 21 days) – from the end of World War I (WWI) to the beginning of World War II (WWII). It was relatively short, yet featured many social, political, military, and economic changes throughout the world. Petroleum-based energy production and associated mechanisation led to the prosperous Roaring Twenties, a time of social and economic mobility for the middle class. Automobiles, electric lighting, radio, and more became common among populations in the first world. The era&#x27;s indulgences were followed by the Great Depression, an unprecedented worldwide economic downturn that severely damaged many of the world&#x27;s largest economies.

Politically, the era coincided with the rise of communism, starting in Russia with the October Revolution and Russian Civil War, at the end of WWI, and ended with the rise of fascism, particularly in Germany and Italy. China was in the midst of a half-century of instability and the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang, the Chinese Communist Party, and many warlords. The empires of Britain, France, and others faced challenges as imperialism was increasingly viewed negatively and independence movements emerged in many colonies; in Europe, after protracted low-level fighting most of Ireland became independent.

The Russian, Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and German Empires were dismantled, with the Ottoman territories and German colonies redistributed among the Allies, chiefly Britain and France. The western parts of the Russian Empire, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland became independent nations in their own right, and Bessarabia (now Moldova and parts of Ukraine) chose to reunify with Romania.

In Russia, the Bolsheviks managed to regain control of Belarus and Ukraine, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, forming the Soviet Union. In the Near East, Egypt and Iraq gained independence. During the Great Depression, countries in Latin America nationalised many foreign companies (most of which belonged to the United States) in a bid to strengthen their own economies. The territorial ambitions of the Soviets, Japanese, Italians, and Germans led to the expansion of their domains.

Militarily, the period would see a markedly rapid advance in technology which, alongside lessons learned from WWI, would catalyse new strategic and tactical innovations. While the period would largely see a continuation of the development of the technologies pioneered in WWI, debates emerged as to the most effective use of these advancements. On land, discussions focused on how armoured, mechanised, and motorised forces should be employed, particularly in-relation to the traditional branches of the regular infantry, horse cavalry, and artillery. In the air, the question of allocating air forces to strategic bombing versus dedicating such forces to frontline close air support was the primary contention, with some arguing that interceptor development was outpacing bombers, and others maintaining that &quot;the bomber will always get through.&quot; In the naval sphere, the primary question was whether battleships would maintain their dominance of the seas or be rendered virtually obsolete by naval aviation. 
The military deliberations and controversies characteristic of the interwar period would ultimately find resolution via the events of WWII, which served as a foundation for many of the tenets, doctrines, and strategies of modern warfare. Overall, the innovations of WWI and the interwar period would see a shift away from traditional line- and front-based warfare and towards a significantly more mobile, mechanised, and asymmetric form of combat.

== Turmoil in Europe ==

Following the Armistice of Compiègne on 11 November 1918 that ended World War I, the years 1918–1924 were marked by turmoil as the Russian Civil War continued to rage on, and Eastern Europe struggled to recover from the devastation of the First World War and the destabilising effects of not just the collapse of the Russian Empire, but the destruction of the German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires, as well. There were numerous new or restored countries in Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe, some small in size, such as Lithuania and Latvia, and some larger, such as Poland and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The United States gained dominance in world finance. Thus, when Germany could no longer afford war reparations to Britain, France and other former members of the Entente, the Americans came up with the Dawes Plan and Wall Street invested heavily in Germany, which repaid its reparations to nations that, in turn, used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington. By the middle of the decade, prosperity was widespread, with the second half of the decade known as the Roaring Twenties.

== International relations ==
The important stages of interwar diplomacy and international relations included resolutions of wartime issues, such as reparations owed by Germany and boundaries; American involvement in European finances and disarmament projects; the expectations and failures of the League of Nations; the relationships of the new countries to the old; the distrustful relations of the Soviet Union to the capitalist world; peace and disarmament efforts; responses to the Great Depression starting in 1929; the collapse of world trade; the collapse of democratic regimes one by one; the growth of efforts at economic autarky; Japanese aggressiveness toward China, occupying large amounts of Chinese land, as well as border disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan, leading to multiple clashes along the Soviet and Japanese occupied Manchurian border; fascist diplomacy, including the aggressive moves by Mussolini&#x27;s Italy and Hitler&#x27;s Germany; the Spanish Civil War; Italy&#x27;s invasion and occupation of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in the Horn of Africa; the appeasement of Germany&#x27;s expansionist moves against the German-speaking nation of Austria, the region inhabited by ethnic Germans called the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, the remilitarisation of the League of Nations demilitarised zone of the German Rhineland region, and the last, desperate stages of rearmament as the Second World War increasingly loomed.

Disarmament was a very popular public policy. However, the League of Nations played little role in this effort, with the United States and Britain taking the lead. U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes sponsored the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 in determining how many capital ships each major country was allowed. The new allocations were actually followed and there were no naval races in the 1920s. Britain played a leading role in the 1927 Geneva Naval Conference and the 1930 London Conference that led to the London Naval Treaty, which added cruisers and submarines to the list of ship allocations. However the refusal of Japan, Germany, Italy and the USSR to go along with this led to the meaningless Second London Naval Treaty of 1936. Naval disarmament had collapsed and the issue became rearming for a war against Germany and Japan.

== Roaring Twenties ==

The Roaring Twenties highlighted novel and highly visible social and cultural trends and innovations. These trends, made possible by sustained economic prosperity, were most visible in major cities like New York City, Chicago, Paris, Berlin, and London. The Jazz Age began and Art Deco peaked. For women, knee-length skirts and dresses became socially acceptable, as did bobbed hair with a Marcel wave. The young women who pioneered these trends were called &quot;flappers&quot;. Not all was new: &quot;normalcy&quot; returned to politics in the wake of hyper-emotional wartime passions in the United States, France, and Germany. The leftist revolutions in Finland, Poland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Spain were defeated by conservatives, but succeeded in Russia, which became the base for Soviet communism and Marxism–Leninism. In Italy, the National Fascist Party came to power under Benito Mussolini after threatening a March on Rome in 1922.

Most independent countries enacted women&#x27;s suffrage in the interwar era, including Canada in 1917 (though Quebec held out longer), Britain in 1918, and the United States in 1920. There were a few major countries that held out until after the Second World War (such as France, Switzerland, and Portugal). Leslie Hume argues:
In Europe, according to Derek Aldcroft and Steven Morewood, &quot;Nearly all countries registered some economic progress in the 1920s and most of them managed to regain or surpass their pre-war income and production levels by the end of the decade.&quot; The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Greece did especially well, while Eastern Europe did poorly, due to the First World War and Russian Civil War. In advanced economies the prosperity reached middle class households and many in the working class with radio, automobiles, telephones, and electric lighting and appliances. There was unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media began to focus on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars. Major cities built large sports stadiums for the fans, in addition to palatial cinemas. The mechanisation of agriculture continued apace, producing an expansion of output that lowered prices, and made many farm workers redundant. Often they moved to nearby industrial towns and cities.

== Great Depression ==

The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place after 1929. The timing varied across nations; in most countries it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s. It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century. The depression originated in the United States and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of 29 October 1929 (known as Black Tuesday). Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide GDP fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession. Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II.

The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries both rich and poor. Personal income, tax revenue, profits, and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50%. Unemployment in the United States rose to 25% and in some countries rose as high as 33%. Prices fell sharply, especially for mining and agricultural commodities. Business profits fell sharply as well, with a sharp reduction in new business starts.

Cities all around the world were hit hard, especially those dependent on heavy industry. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by about 60%. Facing plummeting demand with few alternative sources of jobs, areas dependent on primary sector industries such as mining and logging suffered the most.

The Weimar Republic in Germany gave way to two episodes of political and economic turmoil, the first culminated in the German hyperinflation of 1923 and the failed Beer Hall Putsch of that same year. The second convulsion, brought on by the worldwide depression and Germany&#x27;s disastrous monetary policies, resulted in the further rise of Nazism. In Asia, Japan became an ever more assertive power, especially with regard to China.

=== The rise of fascism ===

Democracy and prosperity largely went together in the 1920s. Economic disaster led to a distrust in the effectiveness of democracy and its collapse in much of Europe and Latin America, including the Baltic and Balkan countries, Poland, Spain, and Portugal. Powerful expansionary anti-democratic regimes emerged in Italy, Japan, and Germany.

Fascism took control of the Kingdom of Italy in 1922; as the Great Depression worsened, Nazism emerged victorious in Germany, fascism spread to many other countries in Europe, and also played a major role in several countries in Latin America. Fascist parties sprang up, attuned to local right-wing traditions, but also possessing common features that typically included extreme militaristic nationalism, a desire for economic self-containment, threats and aggression toward neighbouring countries, oppression of minorities, a ridicule of democracy while using its techniques to mobilise an angry middle-class base, and a disgust with cultural liberalism. Fascists believed in power, violence, male superiority, and a &quot;natural&quot; hierarchy, often led by dictators such as Benito Mussolini or Adolf Hitler. Fascism in power meant that liberalism and human rights were discarded, and individual pursuits and values were subordinated to what the party decided was best.

== Empire of Japan ==

The Japanese modelled their industrial economy closely on the most advanced Western European models. They started with textiles, railways, and shipping, expanding to electricity and machinery. The most serious weakness was a shortage of raw materials. Industry ran short of copper, and coal became a net importer. A deep flaw in the aggressive military strategy was a heavy dependence on imports including 100 per cent of the aluminium, 85 per cent of the iron ore, and especially 79 per cent of the oil supplies. It was one thing to go to war with China or Russia, but quite another to be in conflict with the key suppliers, especially the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands, of oil and iron.

Japan joined the Allies of the First World War to make territorial gains. Together with the British Empire, it divided up Germany&#x27;s territories scattered in the Pacific and on the Chinese coast; they did not amount to very much. The other Allies pushed back hard against Japan&#x27;s efforts to dominate China through the Twenty-One Demands of 1915. Its occupation of Siberia proved unproductive. Japan&#x27;s wartime diplomacy and limited military action had produced few results, and at the Paris Versailles peace conference at the end of the war, Japan was frustrated in its ambitions. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, its Racial Equality Proposal led to increasing diplomatic isolation. The 1902 alliance with Britain was not renewed in 1922 because of heavy pressure on Britain from Canada and the United States. In the 1920s Japanese diplomacy was rooted in a largely liberal democratic political system, and favoured internationalism. By 1930, however, Japan was rapidly reversing itself, rejecting democracy at home, as the Army seized more and more power, and rejecting internationalism and liberalism. By the late 1930s it had joined the Axis military alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.

In 1930, the London disarmament conference angered the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces. The Imperial Japanese Navy demanded parity with the United States, Britain and France, but was rejected and the conference kept the 1921 ratios. Japan was required to scrap a capital ship. Extremists assassinated Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in the May 15 Incident and the military took more power, leading to rapid democratic backsliding.
=== Japan seizes Manchuria ===
In September 1931, the Japanese Kwantung Army—acting on its own without government approval—seized control of Manchuria, an area in northeastern China that was controlled by the powerful warlord Zhang Xueliang. It created the puppet government of Manchukuo. Britain and France effectively controlled the League of Nations, which issued the Lytton Report in 1932, saying that Japan had genuine grievances, but it acted illegally in seizing the entire province. Japan quit the League, and Britain and France took no action. US Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson announced that the United States would also not recognise Japan&#x27;s conquest as legitimate. Germany welcomed Japan&#x27;s actions.

=== Towards the conquest of China ===

The civilian government in Tokyo tried to minimise the Army&#x27;s aggression in Manchuria, and announced it was withdrawing. On the contrary, the Army completed the conquest of Manchuria, and the civilian cabinet resigned. The political parties were divided on the issue of military expansion. Prime Minister Tsuyoshi tried to negotiate with China but was assassinated in the May 15 Incident in 1932, which ushered in an era of nationalism and militarism led by the Imperial Japanese Army and supported by other right-wing societies. The IJA&#x27;s nationalism ended civilian rule in Japan until after 1945.

The Army, however, was itself divided into cliques and factions with different strategic viewpoints. One faction viewed the Soviet Union as the main enemy; the other sought to build a mighty empire based in Manchuria and northern China. The Navy, while smaller and less influential, was also factionalised. Large-scale warfare, known as the Second Sino-Japanese War, began in August 1937, with naval and infantry attacks focused on Shanghai, which quickly spread to other major cities. There were numerous large-scale atrocities against Chinese civilians, such as the Nanjing massacre in December 1937, with mass murder and mass rape. By 1939 military lines had stabilised, with Japan in control of almost all of the major Chinese cities and industrial areas. A puppet government was set up. In the U.S., government and public opinion—even including those who were isolationist regarding Europe—was resolutely opposed to Japan and gave strong support to China. Meanwhile, the Japanese Army fared badly in large battles with the Soviet Red Army in Mongolia at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in summer 1939. The USSR was too powerful. Tokyo and Moscow signed a nonaggression treaty in April 1941, as the militarists turned their attention to the European colonies to the south which had urgently-needed oil fields.

== Spain ==
=== Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) ===
To one degree or another, Spain had been unstable politically for centuries, and in 1936–1939 was wracked by one of the bloodiest civil wars of the 20th century. The real importance comes from outside countries. In Spain the conservative and Catholic elements and the army revolted against the newly elected government of the Second Spanish Republic, and full-scale civil war erupted. Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany gave munitions and strong military units to the rebel Nationalist faction, led by General Francisco Franco. The Republican (or &quot;Loyalist&quot;) government, was on the defensive, but it received significant help from the Soviet Union and Mexico. Led by Great Britain and France, and including the United States, most countries remained neutral and refused to provide armaments to either side. The powerful fear was that this localised conflict would escalate into a European conflagration that no one wanted.

The Spanish Civil War was marked by numerous small battles and sieges, and many atrocities, until the Nationalists won in 1939 by overwhelming the Republican forces. The Soviet Union provided armaments but never enough to equip the heterogeneous government militias and the &quot;International Brigades&quot; of outside far-left volunteers. The civil war did not escalate into a larger conflict, but did become a worldwide ideological battleground that pitted all the Communists and many socialists and liberals against Catholics, conservatives and fascists. Worldwide there was a decline in pacifism and a growing sense that another world war was imminent, and that it would be worth fighting for.

== Great Britain and British Empire ==

The changing world order that the war had brought about, in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers, and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland, caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy. Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and instead signed the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, in which Britain accepted naval parity with the United States. The issue of the empire&#x27;s security was a serious concern in Britain, as it was vital to the British pride, its finance, and its trade-oriented economy.

India strongly supported the Empire in the First World War. It expected a reward, but failed to get self-government as the government was still kept in control of British hands and feared another rebellion like that of 1857. The Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for self-rule. Mounting tension, particularly in the Punjab region, culminated in the Amritsar Massacre in 1919. Indian nationalism surged and centred in the Congress Party led by Mohandas Gandhi. In Britain, public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy and those who viewed it with revulsion.

Egypt had been under &quot;de facto&quot; British control since the 1880s, despite its nominal ownership by the Ottoman Empire. In 1922, the Kingdom of Egypt was granted formal independence, though it continued to be a client state following British guidance. Egypt joined the League of Nations. Egypt&#x27;s King Fuad and his son King Farouk and their conservative allies stayed in power with lavish lifestyles thanks to an informal alliance with Britain who would protect them from both secular and Muslim radicalism. Mandatory Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, gained official independence as the Kingdom of Iraq in 1932 when King Faisal agreed to British terms of a military alliance and an assured flow of oil.

In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Palestinian Arabs and increasing numbers of Jewish settlers. The Balfour Declaration, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly revolted in 1936. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of Arabs as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency.

The Dominions (Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Irish Free State) were self-governing and gained semi-independence in the World War, while Britain still controlled foreign policy and defence in all except Ireland. The right of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy was recognised in 1923 and formalised by the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The Irish Free State effectively broke all ties with Britain in 1937, leaving the Commonwealth and becoming an independent republic.

== French Empire ==


French census statistics from 1938 show an imperial population with France at over 150 million people, outside of France itself, of 102.8 million people living on 13.5 million square kilometers. Of the total population, 64.7 million lived in Africa and 31.2 million lived in Asia; 900,000 lived in the French West Indies or islands in the South Pacific. The largest colonies were French Indochina with 26.8 million (in five separate colonies), French Algeria with 6.6 million, the French protectorate in Morocco, with 5.4 million, and French West Africa with 35.2 million in nine colonies. The total includes 1.9 million Europeans, and 350,000 &quot;assimilated&quot; natives.

=== Revolt in North Africa against Spain and France ===
The Berber independence leader Abd el-Krim (1882–1963) organised armed resistance against the Spanish and French for control of Morocco. The Spanish had faced unrest off and on from the 1890s, but in 1921, Spanish forces were massacred at the Battle of Annual. El-Krim founded an independent Rif Republic that operated until 1926, but had no international recognition. Eventually, France and Spain agreed to end the revolt. They sent in 200,000 soldiers, forcing el-Krim to surrender in 1926; he was exiled in the Pacific until 1947. Morocco was now pacified, and became the base from which Spanish Nationalists would launch their rebellion against the Spanish Republic in 1936.

== Germany ==
=== Weimar Republic ===

The humiliating peace terms in the Treaty of Versailles provoked bitter indignation throughout Germany, and seriously weakened the new democratic regime. The Treaty stripped Germany of all of its overseas colonies, of Alsace–Lorraine, and of predominantly Polish districts. The Allied armies occupied industrial sectors in western Germany including the Rhineland, and Germany was not allowed to have a real army, navy, or air force. Reparations were demanded, especially by France, involving shipments of raw materials, as well as annual payments.

When Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to passive resistance: shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal mines would not dig for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street. The German government printed vast quantities of paper money, causing hyperinflation, which also damaged the French economy. The passive resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making deal for the French government. But the hyperinflation caused many prudent savers to lose all the money they had saved. Weimar added new internal enemies every year, as anti-democratic Nazis, Nationalists, and Communists battled each other in the streets.

Germany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new Soviet Union. Under the Treaty of Rapallo, Germany accorded the Soviet Union &quot;de jure&quot; recognition, and the two signatories mutually agreed to cancel all pre-war debts and renounced war claims. In October 1925 the Treaty of Locarno was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain, and Italy; it recognised Germany&#x27;s borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy, and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rhineland. Locarno paved the way for Germany&#x27;s admission to the League of Nations in 1926.

=== Nazi era, 1933–1939 ===

Hitler came to power in January 1933, and inaugurated an aggressive power designed to give Germany economic and political domination across central Europe. He did not attempt to recover the lost colonies. Until August 1939, the Nazis denounced Communists and the Soviet Union as the greatest enemy, along with the Jews.

Hitler&#x27;s diplomatic strategy in the 1930s was to make seemingly reasonable demands, threatening war if they were not met. When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the League of Nations, rejected the Versailles Treaty, and began to rearm. Retaking the Territory of the Saar Basin in the aftermath of a plebiscite that favoured returning to Germany, Hitler&#x27;s Germany remilitarised the Rhineland, formed the Pact of Steel alliance with Mussolini&#x27;s Italy, and sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War. Germany seized Austria, considered to be a German state, in 1938, and took over Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement with Britain and France. Forming a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union in August 1939, Germany invaded Poland after Poland&#x27;s refusal to cede the Free City of Danzig in September 1939. Britain and France declared war and World War II began – somewhat sooner than the Nazis expected or were ready for.
After establishing the &quot;Rome-Berlin Axis&quot; with Benito Mussolini, and signing the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan – which was joined by Italy a year later in 1937 – Hitler felt able to take the offensive in foreign policy. On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, where an attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934. When Austrian-born Hitler entered Vienna, he was greeted by loud cheers. Four weeks later, 99% of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation (Anschluss) of their country Austria to the German Reich. After Austria, Hitler turned to Czechoslovakia, where the 3.5 million-strong Sudeten German minority was demanding equal rights and self-government.

At the Munich Conference of September 1938, Hitler, the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier agreed upon the cession of Sudeten territory to the German Reich by Czechoslovakia. Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reich&#x27;s territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the smouldering quarrel between Slovaks and Czechs as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In the same month, he secured the return of Memel from Lithuania to Germany. Chamberlain was forced to acknowledge that his policy of appeasement towards Hitler had failed.

== Italy ==

In 1922, the leader of the Italian Fascist movement, Benito Mussolini, was appointed Prime Minister of Italy after the March on Rome. Mussolini resolved the question of sovereignty over the Dodecanese at the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which formalised Italian administration of both Libya and the Dodecanese Islands, in return for a payment to Turkey, the successor state to the Ottoman Empire, though he failed in an attempt to extract a mandate of a portion of Iraq from Britain.

The month following the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne, Mussolini ordered the invasion of the Greek island of Corfu after the Corfu incident. The Italian press supported the move, noting that Corfu had been a Venetian possession for four hundred years. The matter was taken by Greece to the League of Nations, where Mussolini was convinced by Britain to evacuate Royal Italian Army troops, in return for reparations from Greece. The confrontation led Britain and Italy to resolve the question of Jubaland in 1924, which was merged into Italian Somaliland.

During the late 1920s, imperial expansion became an increasingly favoured theme in Mussolini&#x27;s speeches. Amongst Mussolini&#x27;s aims were that Italy had to become the dominant power in the Mediterranean that would be able to challenge France or Britain, as well as attain access to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Mussolini alleged that Italy required uncontested access to the world&#x27;s oceans and shipping lanes to ensure its national sovereignty. This was elaborated on in a document he later drew up in 1939 called &quot;The March to the Oceans&quot;, and included in the official records of a meeting of the Grand Council of Fascism. This text asserted that maritime position determined a nation&#x27;s independence: countries with free access to the high seas were independent; while those who lacked this, were not. Italy, which only had access to an inland sea without French and British acquiescence, was only a &quot;semi-independent nation&quot;, and alleged to be a &quot;prisoner in the Mediterranean&quot;:

In the Balkans, the Fascist regime claimed Dalmatia and held ambitions over Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Greece based on the precedent of previous Roman dominance in these regions. Dalmatia and Slovenia were to be directly annexed into Italy while the remainder of the Balkans was to be transformed into Italian client states. The regime also sought to establish protective patron-client relationships with Austria, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.

In both 1932 and 1935, Italy demanded a League of Nations mandate of the former German Cameroon and a free hand in the Ethiopian Empire from France in return for Italian support against Germany in the Stresa Front. This was refused by French Prime Minister Édouard Herriot, who was not yet sufficiently worried about the prospect of a German resurgence. The failed resolution of the Abyssinia Crisis led to the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, in which Italy annexed Ethiopia to its empire.

Italy&#x27;s stance towards Spain shifted between the 1920s and the 1930s. The Fascist regime in the 1920s held deep antagonism towards Spain due to Miguel Primo de Rivera&#x27;s pro-French foreign policy. In 1926, Mussolini began aiding the Catalan separatist movement, which was led by Francesc Macià, against the Spanish government. With the rise of the left-wing Republican government replacing the Spanish monarchy, Spanish monarchists and fascists repeatedly approached Italy for aid in overthrowing the Republican government, in which Italy agreed to support them to establish a pro-Italian government in Spain. In July 1936, Francisco Franco of the Nationalist faction in the Spanish Civil War requested Italian support against the ruling Republican faction, and guaranteed that, if Italy supported the Nationalists, &quot;future relations would be more than friendly&quot; and that Italian support &quot;would have permitted the influence of Rome to prevail over that of Berlin in the future politics of Spain&quot;. Italy intervened in the civil war with the intention of occupying the Balearic Islands and creating a client state in Spain. Italy sought the control of the Balearic Islands due to its strategic position—Italy could use the islands as a base to disrupt the lines of communication between France and its North African colonies and between British Gibraltar and Malta. After the victory by Franco and the Nationalists in the war, Allied intelligence was informed that Italy was pressuring Spain to permit an Italian occupation of the Balearic Islands.

After Great Britain signed the Anglo-Italian Easter Accords in 1938, Mussolini and Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano issued demands for concessions in the Mediterranean by France, particularly regarding French Somaliland, Tunisia and the French-run Suez Canal. Three weeks later, Mussolini told Ciano that he intended for an Italian takeover of Albania. Mussolini professed that Italy would only be able to &quot;breathe easily&quot; if it had acquired a contiguous colonial domain in Africa from the Atlantic to the Indian Oceans, and when ten million Italians had settled in them. In 1938, Italy demanded a sphere of influence in the Suez Canal in Egypt, specifically demanding that the French-dominated Suez Canal Company accept an Italian representative on its board of directors. Italy opposed the French monopoly over the Suez Canal because, under the French-dominated Suez Canal Company, all merchant traffic to the Italian East Africa colony was forced to pay tolls on entering the canal.

Albanian Prime Minister and President Ahmet Zogu, who had, in 1928, proclaimed himself King of Albania, failed to create a stable state. Albanian society was deeply divided by religion and language, with a border dispute with Greece and an undeveloped, rural economy. In 1939, Italy invaded and annexed Albania as a separate kingdom in personal union with the Italian crown. Italy had long built strong links with the Albanian leadership and considered it firmly within its sphere of influence. Mussolini wanted a spectacular success over a smaller neighbour to match Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia. Italian King Victor Emmanuel III took the Albanian crown, and a fascist government under Shefqet Vërlaci was established.

== Regional patterns ==

=== Balkans ===
The Great Depression destabilised the Kingdom of Romania. The early 1930s were marked by social unrest, high unemployment, and strikes. In several instances, the Romanian government violently repressed strikes and riots, notably the 1929 miners&#x27; strike in Valea Jiului and the strike in the Grivița railroad workshops. In the mid-1930s, the Romanian economy recovered and the industry grew significantly, although about 80% of Romanians were still employed in agriculture. French economic and political influence was predominant in the early 1920s but then Germany became more dominant, especially in the 1930s.

In the Albanian Kingdom, Zog I introduced new civil codes, constitutional changes and attempted land reforms, the latter which was largely unsuccessful due to the inadequacy of the country&#x27;s banking system that could not deal with advanced reformist transactions. Albania&#x27;s reliance on Italy also grew as Italians exercised control over nearly every Albanian official through money and patronage, breeding a colonial-like mentality.

Ethnic integration and assimilation was a major problem faced by the newly formed post-World War I Balkan states, which were compounded by historical differences. In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia for instance, its most influential element was the pre-war Kingdom of Serbia but also integrated states like Slovenia and Croatia, which were part of Austria-Hungary. With new territories came varying legal systems, social structures and political structures. Social and economic development rates also varied as for example Slovenia and Croatia was far more advanced economically than Kosovo and Macedonia, which had substantial Albanian populations that faced persecution. Redistribution of land led to social instability, with estate seizures generally benefiting Slavic Christians.

=== China ===

=== Latin America ===
The United States launched minor interventions into Latin America. These included military presence in Cuba, Panama with the Panama Canal Zone, Haiti (1915–1935), Dominican Republic (1916–1924), and Nicaragua (1912–1933). The U.S. Marine Corps began to specialise in long-term military occupation of these countries.

The Great Depression posed a great challenge to the region. The collapse of the world economy meant that the demand for raw materials drastically declined, undermining many of the economies of Latin America. Intellectuals and government leaders in Latin America turned their backs on the older economic policies and turned toward import substitution industrialisation. The goal was to create self-sufficient economies, which would have their own industrial sectors and large middle classes and which would be immune to the fluctuations of the global economy. Despite the potential threats to United States commercial interests, the Roosevelt administration (1933–1945) understood that the United States could not wholly oppose import substitution. Roosevelt implemented a Good Neighbour policy and allowed the nationalisation of some American companies in Latin America. Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas nationalised American oil companies, out of which he created Pemex. Cárdenas also oversaw the redistribution of a quantity of land, fulfilling the hopes of many since the start of the Mexican Revolution. The Platt Amendment was also repealed, freeing Cuba from legal and official interference of the United States in its politics. The Second World War also brought the United States and most Latin American nations together, with Argentina the main hold out.

During the interwar period, United States policy makers continued to be concerned over German influence in Latin America. Some analysts grossly exaggerated the influence of Germans in South America even after the First World War when German influence somewhat declined. As the influence of United States grew all-over the Americas Germany concentrated its foreign policy efforts in the Southern Cone countries where US influence was weaker and larger German communities were at place.

The contrary ideals of &quot;indigenismo&quot; and &quot;hispanismo&quot; held sway among intellectuals in Spanish-speaking America during the interwar period. In Argentina the &quot;gaucho&quot; genre flourished. A rejection of &quot;Western universalist&quot; influences was in vogue across Latin America. This last tendency was in part inspired by the translation into Spanish of the book &quot;Decline of the West&quot; in 1923.

== Sports ==
Sports became increasingly popular, drawing enthusiastic fans to large stadiums. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) worked to encourage Olympic ideals and participation. Following the 1922 Latin American Games in Rio de Janeiro, the IOC helped to establish national Olympic committees and prepare for future competition. In Brazil, however, sporting and political rivalries slowed progress as opposing factions fought for control of international sport. The 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris and the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam had greatly increased participation from Latin American athletes.

English and Scottish engineers had brought futebol (soccer) to Brazil in the late 19th century. The International Committee of the YMCA of North America and the Playground Association of America played major roles in training coaches. Across the globe after 1912, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) played the chief role in the transformation of association football into a global game, working with national and regional organisations, and setting up the rules and customs, and establishing championships such as the World Cup.

== End of an era ==
The interwar period ended in September 1939 with the German invasion of Poland and the start of World War II.

<doc id="900016" wikidata="Q907735" url="?curid=900016" title="The Love for Three Oranges">
<text>, Op. 33, is a 1921 satirical French-language opera by Sergei Prokofiev. He wrote his own libretto, basing it on the Italian play &quot;L&#x27;amore delle tre melarance&quot;, or &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot; ( &quot;Lyubov k tryom apyelsinam&quot;) by Carlo Gozzi, and conducted the premiere, which took place at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago on 30 December 1921.

== History ==
=== Composition ===
The opera resulted from a commission during Prokofiev&#x27;s first visit to the United States in 1918. After well-received concerts of his works in Chicago, including his First Symphony, Prokofiev was approached by the director of the Chicago Opera Association, Cleofonte Campanini, to write an opera. 

Conveniently the composer had already drafted a libretto during his voyage to America, one based on Gozzi&#x27;s Italian play in mock &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; style (itself an adaptation of Giambattista Basile&#x27;s fairy tale). He had done so using Vsevolod Meyerhold&#x27;s Russian translation of the Gozzi and had injected a dose of Surrealism into the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; mix. But Russian would have been unacceptable to an American audience, and Prokofiev&#x27;s English was scanty, so, with possible help from soprano Vera Janacopoulos, he settled on French.

=== Performance ===
Prokofiev conducted the premiere, which took place at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago on 30 December 1921. Initial criticism was harsh. &quot;It left many of our best people dazed and wondering&quot;; &quot;Russian jazz with Bolshevik trimmings&quot;; and &quot;The work is intended, one learns, to poke fun. As far as I am able to discern, it pokes fun chiefly at those who paid money for it&quot;. However, one newspaperman and author gave it an enthusiastic review. Ben Hecht wrote: &quot;There is nothing difficult about this music, unless you are unfortunate enough to be a music critic. But to the untutored ear there is a charming capriciousness about the sounds from the orchestra&quot;.

Five years after the premiere, in 1926, the French opera received its first production in Russian, in Petrograd.

&quot;L&#x27;amour des trois oranges&quot; was not performed again in the United States until 1949 when the New York City Opera resurrected it. As staged by Vladimir Rosing and conducted by Laszlo Halasz, the production was successful. &quot;Life&quot; magazine featured it in a color photo spread. The New York City Opera mounted a touring company of the production, and the production was brought back in New York for five additional seasons (1949-51, 1954-55, 1963).

Memorably a 1988 production by Richard Jones for Opera North, later seen at English National Opera, New York City Opera and elsewhere, used &quot;scratch&#x27;n&#x27;sniff&quot; cards handed out to the audience, suggesting various scents matching events in the staging (gunshots, Truffaldino&#x27;s &quot;wind&quot;, the aroma of oranges).

The work has entered the standard repertory, with regular stagings on both sides of the Atlantic and at least a dozen complete recordings, six of them videos, to its credit.

=== Popular culture ===
Its most familiar section is the March, used by CBS in the radio-drama series &quot;The FBI in Peace and War&quot; from 1944 to 1958, as an &quot;FBI&quot; leitmotiv in films such as The Brink&#x27;s Job (1978). It is also quoted by Prokofiev himself in the ballet &quot;Cinderella&quot;. It also has been used for the TM Books &amp; Video&#x27;s warning screen. It is also the title of the thirty-third issue of The Maxx, a comic loosely based upon theories of Personality psychology and theory of mind.

==Roles==
== Synopsis ==

=== Prologue ===
Advocates of Tragedy, Comedy, Lyric Drama, and Farce argue for their favourite form before the curtain goes up for a play. The &quot;Ridicules&quot; (Cranks) round them up and tell them they are to witness &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot;.

=== Act 1 ===
The King of Clubs and his adviser Pantalone lament the sickness of the Prince, brought on by an indulgence in tragic poetry. Doctors inform the King that his son&#x27;s hypochondria can only be cured with laughter, so Pantalone summons the jester Truffaldino to arrange a grand entertainment, together with the (secretly inimical) prime minister, Leandro.

The magician Tchelio, who supports the King, and the witch Fata Morgana, who supports Leandro and Clarice (niece of the King, lover of Leandro), play cards to see who will be successful. Tchelio loses three times in succession to Fata Morgana, who brandishes the King of Spades, alias of Leandro.

Leandro and Clarice plot to kill the Prince so that Clarice can succeed to the throne. The supporters of Tragedy are delighted at this turn of events. The servant Smeraldina reveals that she is also in the service of Fata Morgana, who will support Leandro.

=== Act 2 ===
All efforts to make the Prince laugh fail, despite the urgings of the supporters of Comedy, until Fata Morgana is knocked over by Truffaldino and falls down, revealing her underclothes—the Prince laughs, as do all the others except for Leandro and Clarice. Fata Morgana curses him: henceforth, he will be obsessed by a &quot;love for three oranges&quot;. At once, the Prince and Truffaldino march off to seek them.

=== Act 3 ===
Tchelio tells the Prince and Truffaldino where the three oranges are, but warns them that they must have water available when the oranges are opened. He also gives Truffaldino a magic ribbon with which to seduce the giant (female) Cook (a bass voice) who guards the oranges in the palace of the witch Creonte.

They are blown to the palace with the aid of winds created by the demon Farfarello, who has been summoned by Tchelio. Using the ribbon to distract the Cook, they grab the oranges and carry them into the surrounding desert.

While the Prince sleeps, Truffaldino opens two of the oranges. Fairy princesses emerge but quickly die of thirst. The &quot;Ridicules&quot; give the Prince water to save the third princess, Ninette. The Prince and Ninette fall in love. Several soldiers conveniently appear, and the Prince orders them to bury the two dead princesses. He leaves to seek clothing for Ninette so he can take her home to marry her, but, while he is gone, Fata Morgana transforms Ninette into a giant rat and substitutes Smeraldina in disguise.

=== Act 4 ===
Everyone returns to the King&#x27;s palace, where the Prince is now forced to prepare to marry Smeraldina. Tchelio and Fata Morgana meet, each accusing the other of cheating, but the &quot;Ridicules&quot; intervene and spirit the witch away, leaving the field clear for Tchelio. While Leandro and the Master of Ceremonies see that the palace is prepared for the wedding, Tchelio restores Ninette to her natural form. The plotters are sentenced to die but Fata Morgana helps them escape through a trapdoor, and the opera ends with everyone praising the Prince and his bride.

== Arrangements ==

<text>Beer die, or snappa is a table-based drinking game in which opposing players sit or stand at opposite ends and throw a die over a certain height with the goal of either landing the die in their opponent&#x27;s cup or having the die hit the table and bounce over the scoring area to the floor. The defending team attempts to catch the die one-handed after it hits the table, but before it touches a non-table surface. The game typically consists of two two-player teams with each of the four players having a designated cup on the table, but can also be played one-vs-one.

==Basic rules==

The Beer Die League website specified the following rules for the game in February 2014, based on a crowdsourced project and research into the history of the game:
*It is played on a standard sheet of plywood ( of at least thickness) placed on banquet tables, saw horses or similar objects between . The game uses a standard solo cup ( height, diameter). The official dice used for play is the standard Bicycle die, measuring .
*The game is to be played standing up, (sitting down is called Snappa), 2 vs. 2.
*A cup full of water or beer is to be placed from the back, from the side, for each player (hand from back, fist from side).
*The game is played to a particular end score, such as first to five, seven, eleven, or twelve points (win by 2, cap at seven)
*The number 5 must be referred to as bizz, the number 7 must be referred to as buzz.
*One player from each team will roll the die, the team rolling the highest number will be able to choose either side or first toss.
*Players must tap the die before tossing to signal the impending throw.
*The die must be thrown in such a manner that the opposing team does not see the thrower&#x27;s palm upon release of the die.
*The die must travel higher than from the ground. If the opposing team disputes the height, the shot does not count.
*A point is awarded if the die hits the table and bounces off the defensive () side of the table without being properly caught.
*The defending team may catch the die to nullify potential points scored. The die must be caught with one hand (juggling is permitted) but must not be trapped between any surface or body part or a point is awarded. Once the die comes in contact with the floor or stops moving, the play is dead and a point is awarded. Leaving the chair to catch the die is permitted. Players may not reach over the plane of the table to catch the die.
*If the die strikes the cup on a toss, this is a &quot;plink&quot; (also &quot;body&quot; or &quot;ting&quot;): the die is dead and no points can be awarded.
*If the die is thrown into the opposing team’s cup, this is a &quot;plunk&quot;, &quot;sink&quot; or &quot;sploosh&quot;: the throwing team is awarded one point and the thrower is permitted to sign the table. Each additional plunk is awarded a tally under their name.
*If a team shoots out of turn, the toss is negated and the team loses their next shot.
*A designated &quot;god&quot; referee has a final say in disputes.

===Drinking===
When played as a drinking game, players are required to take drinks when certain events occur, or fail to occur. The Beer Die League website specifies that the following rules are used:

==Snappa==

The standing variant of beer die was originally developed from the drinking game Snappa. The variant known as Snappa is played seated, with a chair at each corner of the table.

=== Other variants ===
*Players may be required to take all drinks with their left hand.

<doc id="900020" wikidata="Q961806" url="?curid=900020" title="NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement">
<text>The NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) is the basic contract between the National Hockey League (NHL) (32 team owners and NHL commissioner) and the NHL Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA), designed to be arrived at through the typical labour–management negotiations of collective bargaining. On January 6, 2013, an agreement was tentatively reached after a labour dispute cancelled 510 regular season games of the 2012–13 season, and was ratified by the league&#x27;s Board of Governors on January 9, 2013, as well as by the NHLPA membership three days later on January 12, 2013. As originally signed, the 2013 CBA was a 10-year deal, longest in NHL history, expiring after the 2021–22 season. On July 10, 2020, the NHL and NHLPA announced the extension of the CBA through the 2025–26 NHL season.

==History==
===1994–1995 lockout===

The previous agreement was signed in 1995 following a lockout which shortened the 1994–95 NHL season to 48 games, a loss of 34 games from what had originally been an 82-game schedule. None of the games scheduled for the 1994 segment of the season was ever played, the lockout lasting until after the beginning of 1995. The collective bargaining agreement was initially to last for six seasons and be open to re-negotiation in 1998, but was eventually extended to last until September 15, 2004 (one day after the World Cup of Hockey final in Toronto).

===2004–2005 lockout===

On the expiration date of the old agreement, the NHL Board of Governors, representing ownership, met and unanimously decided that the 2004–05 NHL season would be delayed until a new collective bargaining agreement was in place. The owners&#x27; lockout of players began at 12:01 a.m. on September 16, 2004, the day most NHL training camps would have opened had the NHLPA and the NHL come to an agreement. By November 2004 it became apparent that the entire 2004–05 season was in jeopardy and supposedly &quot;last-ditch&quot; efforts were undertaken to avoid this, but little, if any, progress was seen during the last few months of 2004. The general consensus of many sportswriters and other knowledgeable observers was that, if the entire 2004–05 season were cancelled, the owners would attempt to open training camps in September 2005 for the 2005–06 NHL season using &quot;replacement players,&quot; who are either not members of the NHLPA or were willing to resign their memberships.

On February 13, 2005, the U.S. Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service called a meeting between the two sides to negotiate a new deal. Three days later, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman officially cancelled the season. There was some hope that a season could have been salvaged, as hockey legends Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux, both now part-owners of NHL teams, brought the owners and players together for talks on February 19. However, the two sides failed to reach an agreement.

Once the possibility of losing a second season to the dispute became real and the two sides realized that the dispute had alienated a large portion of the league&#x27;s fan base, the league and the NHLPA resumed negotiations again in June 2005. Many pundits thought that the two sides wished to come to an agreement in early July, to coincide with the Canada Day (July 1) and United States Independence Day (July 4) holiday season. While July 4 passed without an agreement, momentum for a settlement was clearly building, with the two sides meeting daily between July 5 and July 13. Reportedly, the July 12 session lasted until 6 a.m. local time (1000 UTC) on July 13, at which time talks recessed for five hours. The sides announced a tentative agreement at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1630 UTC) on the 13th.

The most important provision of the new collective bargaining agreement was an overall salary cap for all NHL teams, tied to league revenues. The agreement also phased in a reduced age for free agency, which would eventually give players unrestricted rights to negotiate with any team at age 27 or after 7 years of play in the NHL, whichever came first.

On September 4, 2010, the NHL and NHLPA ratified an agreement to alter how the salary cap hit of long-term contracts would be calculated. The new salary cap accounting system would see two distinct changes. First, long-term contracts remain valid, but contracts that include years when a player aged 40 or older will only have the portion of their salaries before they turn 40 included in cap hit calculation. Second, if the average value of the three highest seasons is $5.75 million or more, then the value of years 36 through 39 will have a minimum cap &quot;charge&quot; of $1 million.

These changes came shortly after Ilya Kovalchuk&#x27;s contract extension with the New Jersey Devils was voided, due to &quot;cap circumvention&quot;. Other long-term contracts, such as Marc Savard, Roberto Luongo and Marian Hossa, were grandfathered and their respective cap hits calculated under the old accounting system. However, any long-term contracts signed on or after September 5, 2010 would be subject to the new system.

===2012–2013 lockout===
The 2005–12 CBA expired on September 15, 2012. The 2011–12 NHL season was the final year of the then-current collective bargaining agreement, as the NHL Players&#x27; Association would no longer have the option to extend the current CBA. The players&#x27; association could not move the expiration date to June 30 in order to avoid a repeat of the lockout that cancelled the 2004–05 season.

Just after 5 AM on January 6, 2013, after approximately 16 continuous hours of negotiating, a tentative deal was reached on a new collective bargaining agreement to end the lockout. It was ratified by the league&#x27;s Board of Governors on January 9, as well as by the NHLPA membership three days later on January 12. The deal was also officially signed that day.

===Present status===
Originally, the 2013 CBA was on a ten–year deal, and would have expired on September 15, 2022. The NHL and NHLPA had a choice to opt out of the CBA on September 1 and September 16, 2019, but they chose not to. The NHL paused play in its 2019–20 season on March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 10, 2020, the NHL and NHLPA announced the extension of the CBA through the 2025–26 NHL season. Various elements of the &quot;Return to Play&quot; plan were announced the same day.

<text>Sunand Tryambak Joshi (born June 22, 1958) is an American literary critic whose work has largely focused on weird and fantastic fiction, especially the life and work of H. P. Lovecraft and associated writers.

==Career==
His literary criticism focuses upon the worldviews of authors. His &quot;The Weird Tale&quot; examines horror and fantasy writing by Arthur Machen, Algernon Blackwood, Lord Dunsany, M. R. James, Ambrose Bierce, and Lovecraft.

==Personal life==
S. T. Joshi was born on June 22, 1958, in Pune, India, to Tryambak M. Joshi and Padmini T. Joshi. When he was four, his family moved to the United States and settled in Indiana. He discovered the work of Lovecraft at age 13 in a public library in Muncie, Indiana. He also read L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s biography of Lovecraft, &quot;&quot;, on publication in 1975, and began thereafter to devote himself to Lovecraft. This devotion led him to decline offers from Yale and Harvard so that he could attend Brown University, which is located in Providence, Rhode Island where Lovecraft had lived. He is an atheist.

He lives in Seattle, Washington. Joshi married Leslie Gary Boba on September 1, 2001. They divorced in December 2010.

In August 2014, Joshi opposed the decision to retire and replace Gahan Wilson&#x27;s bust of Lovecraft as the World Fantasy Award statuette in light of a campaign highlighting Lovecraft&#x27;s history of racism; Joshi returned his World Fantasy Awards in protest.

<doc id="900027" wikidata="Q939211" url="?curid=900027" title="Battle of Brávellir">
<text>The Battle of Brávellir or the Battle of Bråvalla was a legendary battle, said to have taken place c. 770, that is described in the sagas as taking place on the Brávellir between Sigurd Hring, king of Sweden and the Geats of Västergötland, and his uncle Harald Wartooth, king of Denmark and the Geats of Östergötland.

==Sources==
The battle is recounted in several sources such as the Norse sagas &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;, &quot;Bósa saga ok Herrauðs&quot; and &quot;Sǫgubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum&quot;, but it is most extensively described in the nationalistic Danish history &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; by Saxo Grammaticus.

==Cause==
Harald had inherited Sweden from his maternal grandfather Ivar Vidfamne, but ruled Denmark and East Götaland, whereas his subordinate king, Sigurd Hring, was the ruler of Sweden and West Götaland. According to legend, Harald realised that he was now old and might die of old age and therefore not go to Valhalla. He consequently asked Sigurd if he would let him leave this life gloriously in a great battle. Odin is also implicated.

==Preparation==
According to Saxo Grammaticus, both hosts prepared for seven years, and mustered armies of 200,000 men. Harald was joined by the legendary heroes Ubbe of Friesland, Uvle Brede, Are the One-eyed, Dag the Fat, Duk the Slav, Hroi Whitebeard and Hothbrodd the Indomitable as well as 300 shieldmaidens led by Hed, Visna of the Slavs and Hedborg. Sigurd recruited the legendary heroes Starkad, Egil the Bald, Grette the Evil (a Norwegian), Blig Bignose, Einar the Fatbellied and Erling Snake. Famous Swedes were Arwakki, Keklu-Karl, Krok the peasant, Gummi and Gudfast from Gislamark. They were joined by scores of Norwegians, Slavs, Finns, Estonians, Curonians, Bjarmians, Livonians, Saxons, Angles, Frisians, Irish, Rus&#x27;, and others, all picking a side. Whole forests were chopped down in order to build 3000 longships to transport the Swedes. Harald&#x27;s Danes built so many ships that they were able to walk on them across Øresund.

==Location==
The &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot; speaks of &quot;Brávelli í eystra Gautlandi&quot; (Bråvalla in East Götaland) and in &quot;Sǫgubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum&quot; the battle is said to have taken place south of Kolmården, which separated Svealand (Sweden proper) from East Götaland and is where Bråviken is located: &quot;Kolmerkr, er skilr Svíþjóð ok Eystra-Gautland ... sem heitir Brávík&quot;. Saxo ends his account by saying &quot;thus ended the battle of Bråvik&quot;. Most historians have held the battle to have taken place near Bråviken, but in the 17th century a minority view appears to have located it in Småland at Lake Åsnen.

==Battle==
The accounts found in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; and the &quot;Sǫgubrot&quot; saga are essentially the same.

At first the two armies fought collectively, but after a while Ubbi was in the centre of attention. He slew first Ragnvald the Wise Councilor, then the champion Tryggvi and three Swedish princes of the royal dynasty.

Humbled, King Sigurd Hring sent forth the champion Starkad, who managed to wound Ubbi but was himself even more seriously wounded. Then Ubbi killed Agnar, and took the sword in both hands and slashed a path through the Swedish host, until he fell riddled with arrows from the archers of Telemark. Then the shieldmaiden Veborg killed the champion Soti and managed to give additional wounds to Starkad, who was greatly angered. She was killed by the champion Thorkell.

Furious, Starkad went forth in the Danish army, killing warriors all around him, and cut off the Wendish shieldmaiden Visna&#x27;s arm, which held the Danish banner. Starkad then proceeded to slay the champions Brai, Grepi, Gamli and Haki.

When Harald had observed these heroic feats, he stood on his knees in his chariot with one sword in each hand and killed a great many warriors both to his left and to his right. After a while, Harald&#x27;s steward Bruni deemed that his liege had amassed enough glory and crushed the king&#x27;s skull with a club.

==Outcome==
Sigurd won the battle and became the sovereign ruler of all of Sweden and Denmark (40,000 warriors had died).

==Historicity==
The general agreement on the historicity of the battle has turned back and forth during the last two centuries depending on what was the prevalent ideology among Scandinavian historians. In 1925, the Swedish archaeologist Birger Nerman summarized the ebbs and tides of its historicity. He stated that older scholarship had treated the accounts of the battle uncritically and perceived the accounts as largely historical. During the last decades of the 19th century, however, the hypercritical school considered the battle as entirely fictional and considered even the area where it took place as mythical. The pendulum turned and during the first decades of the 20th century, the opinion was once again in favour of its historicity, although the contemporary scholarship regarded it as a fictionalized historic event. In 1990, the Swedish encyclopedia &quot;Nationalencyklopedin&quot; summed up the debate by claiming that the historicity of the battle is impossible to verify. There is also a hypothesis relating the battle to the events of 827 when Harald Klak was expelled from Denmark.

<text>Samuel Foster Damon (February 12, 1893 – December 25, 1971) was an American academic, a specialist in William Blake, a critic and a poet. When remembered as a Blake scholar, he is often compared in importance to Northrop Frye and David V. Erdman.

==Early life==
He was born in Newton, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard University in 1914, returning there after World War I as an instructor in the English Department. He was one of the Harvard Aesthetes, and married Louise Wheelwright, sister of John Brooks Wheelwright, another active Harvard Aesthete.

==Scholarly career==
His book &quot;William Blake, His Philosophy and Symbols&quot; from 1924 was later followed by &quot;A Blake Dictionary&quot; (1965), the work for which he is perhaps best known. Their encyclopedic scope expanded Blake studies into the examination of the mystical and occult elements of Blake&#x27;s work. In the foreword to a revised edition of the &quot;Dictionary&quot;, Morris Eaves says that when Damon&#x27;s first book on Blake came out, he was the &quot;Young Turk&quot; of Blake studies, and when the &quot;Dictionary&quot; appeared, he was the &quot;patriarch&quot; of the field.

His later academic career was at Brown University, where he had positions from 1927. His other writings include a biography of Amy Lowell, and the long poem &quot;The Moulton Tragedy, a heroic poem with lyrics&quot; (1971). He also published poetry under the pseudonym Samuel Nomad.

<text>The Deverel–Rimbury culture was a name given to an archaeological culture of the British Middle Bronze Age in southern England. It is named after two barrow sites in Dorset and dates to between &quot;c&quot;. 1600 BC and 1100 BC.

It is characterised by the incorrectly-named Celtic fields, palisaded cattle enclosures, small roundhouses and cremation burials either in urnfield cemeteries or under low, round barrows. Cremations from this period were also inserted into pre-existing barrows. The people were arable and livestock farmers.

Deverel–Rimbury pottery is characterised by distinctive globular vessels with tooled decoration and thick-walled, so-called &quot;bucket urns&quot; with cordoned, usually finger-printed decoration. In the southern counties of the UK, fabric is usually coarsely flint-tempered. In East Anglia and further northeast grog-tempering is typical.

The term Deverel-Rimbury is now mostly used to refer to the pottery types as archaeologists today believe that Deverel–Rimbury does not represent a single homogeneous cultural group but numerous disparate groups who shared a varying range of cultural traits.

<text>Dipsomania is a historical term describing a medical condition involving an uncontrollable craving for alcohol or other drugs. In the 19th century, the term dipsomania was used to refer to a variety of alcohol-related problems, most of which are known today as alcohol use disorder. Dipsomania is occasionally still used to describe a particular condition of periodic, compulsive bouts of alcohol intake. The idea of dipsomania is important for its historical role in promoting a disease theory of chronic drunkenness. The word comes from Greek &quot;dipso-&quot; (from &#x27;thirst&#x27;) and &quot;mania&quot; ( &#x27;madness, frenzy, compulsion etc.&#x27;).

It is mentioned in the World Health Organization ICD-10 classification as an alternative description for Alcohol Dependence Syndrome, episodic use F10.26.

== History ==
The term was coined by the German physician Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland in 1819, when, in a preface to an influential book by German-Russian doctor C. von Brühl-Cramer, he translated Brühl-Cramer&#x27;s term &quot;trunksucht&quot; as &quot;dipsomania&quot;. Brühl-Cramer classified dipsomania in terms of continuous, remittent, intermittent, periodic and mixed forms, and in his book he discussed its cause, pathogenesis, sequelae, and treatment options, all influenced by prevailing ideas about the laws of chemistry and concepts of excitability.

Due to the influence of Brühl-Cramer&#x27;s pioneering work, dipsomania became popular in medical circles throughout the 19th century. Political scientist Mariana Valverde describes dipsomania as &quot;the most medical&quot; of the many terms used to describe habitual drunkenness in the 19th century. Along with terms such as &quot;inebriety&quot;, the idea of dipsomania was used as part of an effort of medical professionals and reformers to change attitudes about habitual drunkenness from being a criminally punishable vice to being a medically treatable disease. As historian Roy MacLeod wrote about this dipsomania reform movement, it &quot;illuminates certain features of the gradual transformation taking place in national attitudes towards the prevention and cure of social illnesses during the last quarter of the 19th century.&quot;

Although &quot;dipsomania&quot; was used in a variety of somewhat contradictory ways by different individuals, by the late 19th century the term was usually used to describe a periodic or acute condition, in contrast to chronic drunkenness. In his 1893 book &quot;Clinical Lessons on Mental Diseases: The Mental State of Dipsomania&quot;, Magnan characterized dipsomania as a crisis lasting from one day to two weeks, and consisting of a rapid and huge ingestion of alcohol or whatever other strong, excitatory liquid was available. Magnan further described dipsomania as solitary alcohol abuse, with loss of all other interests, and these crises recurred at indeterminate intervals, separated by periods when the subject was generally sober.

Similarly, in 1892 the influential English physician and mental health expert Daniel Hack Tuke defined dipsomania as a syndrome involving &quot;an irresistible obsession and impulse to drink, coming on in attacks, during which the patients are in a condition of impotence of will and manifest great anguish.&quot; Tuke clarifies that dipsomania can be distinguished from what was at the time considered alcoholism by six key factors. First, &quot;an alcoholic patient becomes insane because he drinks; a dipsomaniac is insane before he commences to drink.&quot; Second, &quot;alcoholism is an intoxication which has as its cause alcohol; dipsomania has its cause in a defective mental condition, and alcohol is but a secondary factor, which may be replaced by any other poison, leaving to the syndrome all its psychological characters.&quot; Third, &quot;dipsomania proceeds in paroxysmal attacks, and the appetite for strong drink is absent during the intervals between the attacks. Alcoholism has no definite course.&quot; Fourth, &quot;a dipsomaniac satisfies a pathological and imperious want; he does not like alcohol, and takes it against his will,&quot; whereas &quot;an alcoholic individual has no actual want; he only obeys a vice, a proclivity, and an alteration of his moral sense.&quot; Fifth, a dipsomaniac is conscious and ashamed of his condition, whereas an alcoholic is sometimes unaware of, but more often indifferent to it. Finally, he concluded that &quot;dipsomania is a syndrome, always identical with itself, whilst alcoholism is an intoxication varying much in its clinical symptoms.&quot;

Over time, the term dipsomania became less common, replaced by newer ideas and terms concerning chronic and acute drunkenness and alcohol use disorder.

<doc id="900042" wikidata="Q531913" url="?curid=900042" title="MC Eiht">
<text>Aaron Bernard Tyler (born May 22, 1971), better known by his stage name MC Eiht (pronounced &quot;MC Eight&quot;), is an American rapper. Many of his songs are based on his life in Compton. His stage name was partly inspired by the numeral in KRS-One&#x27;s name. He chose Eiht for its links to &quot;hood culture&quot;, including Olde English 800 (8 Ball) and .38 caliber firearms. He is the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of West Coast hip hop group Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted, which also included fellow Compton-based rappers Boom Bam, The Unknown DJ, Tha Chill, DJ Mike T, DJ Slip and Ant Capone. He is also known for his role as A-Wax in the 1993 film &quot;Menace II Society,&quot; as well as voicing the character Ryder in the 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.&quot;

==Biography==

Tyler was born in Compton, California, and grew to fame on the West Coast as one of two MCs in the four-man crew Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted. After enjoying increasing success with the group, which peaked with 1992&#x27;s &quot;Music to Driveby&quot;, Eiht took a role in the hit movie &quot;Menace II Society&quot; as well as a high-profile spot on the soundtrack. The song &quot;Streiht Up Menace&quot;, which chronicles the unfortunate downturn of the film&#x27;s protagonist within the pathological conditions of American inner city life, is considered by many critics to be Eiht&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;. The movie spurred him into a solo career, although his next two albums &quot;We Come Strapped&quot; and &quot;Death Threatz&quot; would be accredited as MC Eiht featuring Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted. These albums were considered his best and took place during the most tense years of the &#x27;beef&#x27; between Eiht and DJ Quik, Eiht&#x27;s childhood friends Boom Bam and Tha Chill of N.O.T.R were heavily involved with both albums and the Quik beef, there are several explicit remarks towards Quik made on these albums by E, Bam and Chill. E was also associated with the West 159th Street Tragniew Park Compton Crips.

He states that he didn&#x27;t wish to star in comedy films in order to maintain his public image. He later only appeared in the low-budget movies &quot;Reasons&quot;, &quot;Thicker than Water&quot; and &quot;Who Made the Potatoe Salad?&quot; as well as providing the voice for Lance &#x27;Ryder&#x27; Wilson in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;. His music has also been included in the Grand Theft Auto series, both alone and with Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted.

He put out &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;, the first album accredited only to MC Eiht, then broke from the label for Big Beat/Atlantic. Eiht never ended up putting out an album on the label, instead eventually signing with and releasing the album &quot;Section 8&quot; on Priority/EMI in 1999.
Eiht would hop between record labels and one-off releases in the next years, moving between independent labels Half-Ounce, D3 Entertainment and Lookin&#x27; Up Entertainment from 2001 to 2003. He would put out records with Spice 1 and Brotha Lynch Hung in 2004 and 2006 on Real Talk Ent., releasing another solo album between them on West Inc./Native Records. His inability to settle at a label contributed to his joining the Warzone, a trio put together by Snoop Dogg and consisting of Goldie Loc, Kam, and MC Eiht himself. In 2006, Eiht and the group appeared on the single &quot;Candy (Drippin&#x27; Like Water)&quot; on Snoop Dogg&#x27;s album &quot;Tha Blue Carpet Treatment&quot;. In 2010, Eiht appears on the remix to Dam Funk&#x27;s &quot;Hood Pass Intact&quot;. MC Eiht also appeared with Young Maylay in Blaq Poet&#x27;s new street single, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nuttin&#x27; Changed (Remix)&quot;.

In June 2011, MC Eiht released his single &quot;Fine By Me&quot; accompanied by a music video directed by Director Hugo V. under his new label Year Round/Blue Stamp Records. Year Round Records is owned by New York-based hip hop artist DJ Premier.

In October 2012, MC Eiht was featured on the song &quot;m.A.A.d city&quot; by Kendrick Lamar, from his major label debut &quot;Good Kid, m.A.A.d City&quot;. Eiht released the &quot;Keep It Hood&quot; EP, through BLUESTAMP Music Group on January 4, 2013. The album features cuts from DJ Premier and production from Brenk Sinatra. In 2013, he plans to release a collaboration album with DJ Premier.

In the summer of 2014, MC Eiht released a single with the Outlawz, Tupac Shakur&#x27;s old group, titled &quot;Shut ’Em Down&quot;, which made references to old Outlawz members Tupac and Kadafi. The song is a part of Eiht&#x27;s upcoming &quot;Which Way Iz West LP&quot; and is MC Eiht&#x27;s first LP in eight years.

==Feud with DJ Quik==
MC Eiht and his group CMW got involved in a long tumultuous rivalry with fellow Compton DJ/rapper DJ Quik that lasted for several years. The feud traces back to a track on DJ Quik&#x27;s debut mixtape &quot;The Red Tape&quot;, where Quik indirectly dissed both Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted and N.W.A. During that time, Quik was a member of the Tree Top Piru Bloods and Eiht was a member of the 159th St. Tragniew Park Compton Crips. On the track &quot;Duck Sick&quot; from CMW&#x27;s debut album &quot;It&#x27;s a Compton Thang&quot;, they criticized and questioned Quik&#x27;s street credibility. They hit Quik again in 1991 on their second effort &quot;Straight Checkn &#x27;Em&quot;. Quik didn&#x27;t respond to CMW&#x27;s disses on his debut album &quot;Quik is the Name&quot;, but he responded to Eiht on the title track to his sophomore effort &quot;Way 2 Fonky&quot; &amp; &quot;Tha Last Word&quot;. CMW responded months later with a music video for &quot;Def Wish II&quot; which featured a DJ Quik lookalike having a surreal nightmare of CMW chasing &amp; ambushing him leading to him getting killed &amp; with &quot;Def Wish III&quot; leading to the peak of their rivalry. Quik then responded to it with &quot;Street Level Entrance&quot; &amp; &quot;Let You Have It&quot;, mentioning the &quot;Def Wish II&quot; music video, while facing label problems and other music projects. However, on the soundtrack to the 1994 short film &quot;Murder Was The Case&quot;, on the track &quot;Dollaz + Sense&quot;, Quik ruthlessly verbally attacks Eiht, calling him a movie script killer (in reference to Eiht&#x27;s appearance in the critically acclaimed 1993 film &quot;Menace II Society&quot;), a coward, and more. Quik fanned the flames even more by performing the song at the 1995 Source Awards in New York City. The feud stayed quiet until April 1996, where Eiht responded to Quik on his second solo album &quot;Death Threatz&quot; which featured the track Def Wish IV (Tap That Azz) exposing the backstory of how both artists met in person, &amp; &quot;Killin&#x27; Nigguz&quot; which were the last diss tracks of their feud. The feud between Quik and Eiht slowly died down in 1997 following the deaths of Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., but the feud didn&#x27;t actually end until the summer of 1998, where Snoop Dogg, Daz Dillinger, and other West Coast rappers helped Eiht and Quik squash the beef. MC Eiht and DJ Quik appeared in an interview on July 21, 1999 on BET Tonight. Since then, Quik and Eiht collaborated on various songs. Even though the rivalry was not on the level of the Nas-Jay Z rivalry or the East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry since it was not covered by the media, it has been hailed by most hip hop fans and critics that it stands out as one of the longest active hip hop rivalries of all time (from 1992 to 1998).

<text>The National Ocean Service (NOS) is an office within the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It is responsible for preserving and enhancing the nation&#x27;s coastal resources and ecosystems along approximately of shoreline, that is bordering of coastal, Great Lakes, and ocean waters. Its mission is to &quot;provide science-based solutions through collaborative partnerships to address the evolving economic, environmental, and social pressures on our oceans and coasts.&quot; Its projects focus on working to ensure the safe and efficient marine transportation, promoting the protection of coastal communities, conserving marine and coastal places. NOS employs 1,700 scientists, natural resource managers, and specialists in many different fields. The National Ocean Service was previously also known as the National Ocean Survey until it was renamed in 1983.

==Organization==
As one of the six NOAA Line Offices, NOAA&#x27;s National Ocean Service (NOS) observes, studies, and manages the nation&#x27;s coastal and marine resources. The NOS measures and predicts the coastal and ocean phenomena, protects large areas of the oceans, works to ensure safe navigation, and provides tools and information to protect and restore the coastal and marine resources. NOAA&#x27;s National Ocean Service is composed of seven programs and two staff offices.

===Program offices===

* Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS)
* National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) 
* Office of Coast Survey (OCS)
* Office for Coastal Management (OCM)
* National Geodetic Survey (NGS)
* Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS)
* Office of Response and Restoration (OR&amp;R)

===Staff offices===

* Integrated Ocean Observing System Program (IOOS)
* Management and Budget Office (MBO)

==Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services==
The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) is a source for water-level and current measurements that support safe and efficient maritime commerce, sound coastal management, and recreation. CO-OPS is composed of four divisions:

===Field Operations Division===
The Field Operations Division (FOD) operates and maintains all oceanographic and Great Lakes observing systems required to meet CO-OPS&#x27; mission objectives. The Division monitors the continuous operations of navigation and other real-time observing systems to support the protection of life and property. FOD also operates the Ocean Systems Test and Evaluation Facility (OSTEF) to support Requirements and Development Division (RDD), and Information Systems Division (ISD) development efforts. FOD operates equipment to evaluate new observing systems and software modules developed to support NOS mission objectives. The Division installs, documents, operates and maintains CO-OPS measurement systems (e.g., NWLON, PORTS); conducts field reconnaissance and geodetic operations to include the establishment, leveling, documentation, and inspection of NOS benchmarks; and provides training in the installation, operation and maintenance of CO-OPS observing equipment.

===Oceanographic Division===
The Oceanographic Division monitors the quality of all data collected by CO-OPS, and produces operational products from this data stream. The Division monitors the performance of all CO-OPS observing systems and reports discrepancies to appropriate Center personnel. The Division performs operational data quality control/data analysis; produces oceanographic products; manages the content of CO-OPS data/product delivery systems; develops web page services; distributes real-time data to CO-OPS customers; provides information for matters such as litigation and boundary disputes (e.g., certified water level and benchmark information); provides technical assistance to customers regarding the use of CO-OPS products and services; designs new products and services to meet user needs, and maintains customer lists, billing information and accounting procedures to ensure the accurate accounting of revenues collected through user fees.

===Engineering Division===
The Engineering Division establishes observation and analysis requirements for CO-OPS based on the assessment of user/customer needs. The Division also manages the Ocean Systems Test and Evaluation Program (OSTEP) and its associated test facilities. The Division develops new oceanographic measurement systems and techniques to improve the safety of marine navigation. The Division: develops and issues standard operating procedures, project instructions, and manuals, to guide the operation and maintenance of CO-OPS oceanographic and meteorological measurement systems; prepares measurement requirements (based on tidal zoning) for hydrographic or photogrammetric field surveys, and to support other NOS needs for water level and current information; prepares and monitors interagency agreements, technology transfer agreements and work plans; prepares and administers contracts; provides technical assistance and guidance to other countries, agencies, and the public in the establishment and operation of water level and current measurement stations; and develops/integrates measurement and telemetry systems needed to support CO-OPS activities.

==National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science==
The National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) provides research, scientific information and tools to help balance the nation&#x27;s ecological, social and economic goals. The research and tools provided are central to addressing coastal issues raised in legislation and NOAA&#x27;s priorities. NCCOS were formed within the National Ocean Service (NOS) in March 1999 as the focal point for coastal ocean science. Research areas and strategy were selected in response to Federal legislation, stakeholder input, and in concert with scientific expertise and capabilities.

==Office of Coast Survey==

Provides navigation products and services that ensure safe and efficient maritime commerce on America&#x27;s oceans and coastal waters, and in the Great Lakes. OCS consists of the following offices:
* Marine Chart Division
* Hydrographic Surveys Division
* Navigation Services Division
* Coast Survey Development Lab

==Office for Coastal Management==
Established in 2014 when NOAA combined two offices: the Coastal Services Center and the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management. In addition to implementing specific initiatives, a top priority for NOAA&#x27;s Office for Coastal Management is to unify efforts to make communities more resilient. Many organizations are involved, including the private sector, nonprofits, the scientific community, and all levels of government. The Office for Coastal Management works to be a unifying force in these efforts, providing unbiased NOAA data and tools and providing opportunities for the community to come together to define common goals and find ways to work smarter by working together. Issues include endangered species protection, erosion, and generating better building codes for storm-resistant buildings. The OCM has four programs:

===Coastal Zone Management===
The National Coastal Zone Management Program addresses the nation&#x27;s coastal issues through a voluntary partnership between the federal government and coastal and Great Lakes states and territories. Authorized by the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, the program provides the basis for protecting, restoring, and responsibly developing coastal communities and resources.
Currently 34 coastal states participate. While state partners must follow basic requirements, the program also gives states the flexibility to design unique programs that best address their coastal challenges and regulations.

===Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP)===
NOAA&#x27;s Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) is a cross-cutting program that brings together expertise from a wide array of NOAA programs and offices in the National Ocean Service (NOS), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), and the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS). The CRCP was established in 2000 to help fulfill NOAA&#x27;s responsibilities under the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 (CRCA) and the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force (established by Presidential Executive Order 13089 on Coral Reef Protection). The mission of the CRCP is to protect, conserve, and restore coral reef resources by maintaining healthy ecosystem function. CRCP focuses on four main pillars of work: increase resilience to climate change, reduce land-based sources of pollution, improve fisheries&#x27; sustainability, and restore viable coral populations. In strong partnership with local managers, CRCP addresses strategic coral reef management needs in a targeted, cost-effective, and efficient manner.

CRCP funds and equips reef conservation activities by NOAA and its partners in the seven U.S. states and jurisdictions containing coral reefs (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands), uninhabited islands including the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and Pacific Remote Island Areas, and the Pacific Freely Associated States (Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau). CRCP supports multiple cross-cutting activities and associated products including the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program and Coral Reef Watch.

===Digital Coast===
This NOAA-sponsored website is focused on helping communities address coastal issues and has become one of the most-used resources in the coastal management community.

===National Estuarine Research Reserves===
The National Estuarine Research Reserve System is a network of 29 coastal sites designated to protect and study estuarine systems. Established through the Coastal Zone Management Act, the reserves represent a partnership program between NOAA and the coastal states. NOAA provides funding and national guidance, and each site is managed on a daily basis by a lead state agency or university with input from local partners.

==Office of National Geodetic Survey==

The Office of National Geodetic Survey (NGS) provides the framework for all positioning activities in the nation. The foundational elements - latitude, longitude, elevation, shoreline information and their changes over time - contribute to informed decision making and impact a wide range of important activities including mapping and charting, navigation, flood risk determination, transportation, land use and ecosystem management. NGS&#x27; authoritative spatial data, models, and tools are vital for the protection and management of natural and manmade resources and support the economic prosperity and environmental health of the nation. The NGS consists of six divisions:
* Geodetic Services: provides a direct relationship between NGS and its customers through the state advisor program, geodetic equipment testing and evaluation, product evaluation, marketing, distribution, and various training programs.
* Spatial Reference Systems: maintains the Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) network and plans, coordinates and provides technical guidance for geodetic field projects and products required to preserve and develop the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS).
* Remote Sensing: involves all aspects of airport charting and shoreline mapping using traditional methods while exploring more efficient technologies to complement current practices.
* Observations &amp; Analysis: conducts geodetic surveys to support the National Spatial Reference System, the production of airport obstruction charts, the location of aeronautical aids to navigation, and the production of coastal maps, charts, and special products in the coastal zone. The Division also conducts field surveys required to support photogrammetric and hydrographic surveys.
* Systems Development: administers the central processing units, disk and storage systems, telecommunications and network systems, and peripheral input and output systems for NGS. The Division also researches, designs, develops, implements, and conveys the operational use of computer-assisted systems for the acquisition, reduction, analyses, display, and transmission of geodetic, photogrammetric, and remote sensing source data.
* Geosciences Research: coordinates the research, development and management of new geodetic data products. The Division also designs and programs scientific and geodetic software applications and procedures.

==Office of National Marine Sanctuaries==
The Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) serves as the trustee for the National Marine Sanctuary system, a network of underwater parks encompassing more than of Great Lakes and oceanic waters. As of October 11, 2024, the network includes a system of 17 national marine sanctuaries:

* Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary
* Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary
* Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary
* Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary
* Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary
* Gray&#x27;s Reef National Marine Sanctuary
* Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary
* Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary
* Lake Ontario National Marine Sanctuary
* Mallows Bay–Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary
* Monitor National Marine Sanctuary
* Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary
* National Marine Sanctuary of American Samoa
* Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary
* Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary
* Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary
* Wisconsin Shipwreck Coast National Marine Sanctuary

The ONMS also participates in the administration of two marine national monuments, the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, which it administers jointly with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the State of Hawaii, and the Rose Atoll Marine National Monument, which it administers jointly with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

==Office of Response and Restoration==
NOAA&#x27;s Office of Response and Restoration (OR&amp;R) is a center for preparation and response to threats to coastal environments, including oil and chemical spills, releases from hazardous waste sites, and marine debris. The Office of Response and Restoration&#x27;s tasks include:
* Provides scientific and technical support to prepare for and respond to oil and chemical releases.
* Determines damage to natural resources from these releases.
* Protects and restores marine and coastal ecosystems, including coral reefs.
* Works with communities to address critical local and regional coastal challenges.
OR&amp;R has three divisions:

===Emergency Response Division===
The Emergency Response Division (ERD) of NOAA&#x27;s Office of Response and Restoration (OR&amp;R) provides scientific expertise to an incident response. Under the National Contingency Plan, NOAA has responsibility for providing scientific support to the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) for oil and hazardous material spills. To support this mandate, ERD provides response to spill events at any time of day.

===Assessment and Restoration Division===

The Assessment and Restoration Division (ARD), formerly Coastal Protection and Restoration Division (CPRD), is responsible for evaluating and restoring coastal and estuarine habitats damaged by hazardous waste releases, oil spills, and vessel groundings. ARD joined with NOAA&#x27;s General Counsel for Natural Resources and Office of Habitat Conservation to create the Damage Assessment, Remediation and Restoration Program (DARRP). This NOAA partnership focuses on the protection and restoration of marine natural resources. The Assessment and Restoration Division is composed of NOAA biologists, toxicologists, ecologists, policy analysts, attorneys, geologists, environmental engineers, and economists. It assesses ecological, environmental ,and economic risk and injury from contamination and ship groundings. In particular, ARD has developed specific expertise in aquatic risk assessment techniques, contaminated sediment issues, and data interpretation. The ARD publishes the &quot;Screening Quick Reference Tables&quot; (&quot;SQuiRT&quot; cards), for rapid evaluation of water, sediment and soil contamination.

===Marine Debris Division===
Since 2005, the NOAA Marine Debris Program has been a NOAA program focused on researching, reducing, and preventing debris in the marine environment nationally and globally. The program works with various partners across the U.S. to fulfill its mission.

==Integrated Ocean Observing System==
The Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) is a national-regional partnership working to understand and predict coastal events - such as storms, wave heights, and sea level change.

== History ==
The National Ocean Service traces its history to 1807, when the Survey of the Coast was created as the U.S. Government&#x27;s first scientific agency. The agency was renamed the United States Coast Survey in 1836 and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878. On October 3, 1970, when the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) was replaced by NOAA, the Coast and Geodetic Survey was merged with other government scientific agencies to form NOAA. The Coast and Geodetic Survey′s organizational existence lingered until October 9, 1970, when its successor agency within NOAA, the National Ocean Survey, took over its assets and responsibilities. Under the National Ocean Survey, the Office of Coast Survey took over the Coast and Geodetic Survey′s hydrographic survey duties and its geodetic responsibilities were transferred to the National Geodetic Survey. The Coast and Geodetic Survey&#x27;s fleet of survey ships temporarily came under the direct control of the National Ocean Survey, although via a phased process during 1972 and 1973 they merged with ships temporarily assigned to NOAA&#x27;s National Marine Fisheries Service and ships formerly assigned to ESSA′s Environmental Research Laboratories to form the unified NOAA fleet operated by the National Ocean Survey&#x27;s Office of Fleet Operations. As a reflection of its diversifying responsibilities, the National Ocean Survey was renamed the National Ocean Service in 1983.

<doc id="900047" wikidata="Q2778023" url="?curid=900047" title="Faking It (British TV series)">
<text>Faking It is a television programme originating on Channel 4 which has spawned various international remakes, including a United States version which began in 2003 on the TLC network. Devised by Stephen Lambert of RDF Media, the programme&#x27;s original concept was &quot;a modern-day &quot;Pygmalion&quot;&quot;, referring to the George Bernard Shaw play in which flower girl Eliza Doolittle is trained to appear like an aristocrat.

==History==
The programme debuted in 2000 with a run of only two episodes, one of which featured Alex Geikie, a well-spoken gay man, being taught to &quot;fake it&quot; as a London club bouncer. The second episode was a straight use of the &quot;Pygmalion&quot; concept as a young working-class woman, Lisa Dickinson-Grey, was taught how to behave in high society by Tim Walker, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&#x27;s&quot; Mandrake diarist. Since the show began being sold abroad, these episodes have picked up the titles &quot;Alex The Animal&quot; and &quot;Lady Lisa&quot;. The series ended on Boxing Day 2006 with faker Sharon Pallister transforming from cleaner to burlesque performer and featured Wayne Sleep, Immodesty Blaize and Dita Von Teese.

The first two episodes were well received by critics and a further seven episodes followed in 2001, ten in 2002, five in 2003, thirteen in 2004, three T4 specials, and a final feature-length show in 2005. The programme had always fared well in the ratings, with an average audience of just over two million a strong showing for Channel 4.

==Format==
The programme shared much with earlier British TV shows such as &quot;In at the Deep End&quot; and &quot;Jobs For The Boys&quot;/&quot;Girls&quot;, and more recently the children&#x27;s show &quot;Bring It On&quot;, all of which featured TV presenters or other celebrities learning other trades, but &quot;Faking It&quot; was the first that successfully used members of the public in the role. Its basic format was that a member of the public lived with and trained with an expert for four weeks and then took part in a contest against experienced participants in whatever activity they have learned. A panel of expert judges then gave their verdict on which participant was the &quot;faker&quot;. Ostensibly, success meant fooling a majority of the judges, though there was no prize for success and the real point of the show was the experience that the fakers received over the course of the month&#x27;s filming.

==Success and controversy==
Among the most acclaimed episodes were cellist Sian Evans learning to be a club DJ, burger-van proprietor Ed Devlin training with Gordon Ramsay to become a cordon bleu chef, a former naval petty officer being trained as a drag artist and city lawyer George LuBega learning the art of the garage MC.

In 2003, participant Laura-Jane Foley claimed she had been misrepresented by the show. A former choirgirl, she had taken part in an episode in which she was taught how to be the front woman for a punk rock band. The episode in question had run into trouble before it even aired, with regular sponsors Smirnoff refusing to be associated with its scenes of &quot;irresponsible drinking&quot;, but apart from an article in the Cambridge University newspaper &quot;Varsity&quot;, Foley did not pursue the matter further. She is, however, the only participant to date not to co-operate with Channel 4 in pre- and post-publicity for the show.

The show has proven hugely successful in the UK and elsewhere, twice winning the BAFTA award for Best Factual Feature. A 2002 episode in which punk singer Chris Sweeney was trained as an orchestral conductor won the Golden Rose of Montreux in 2003 as well as the Press Prize at the same festival. The chef episode won an International Emmy Award.

<doc id="900048" wikidata="Q795178" url="?curid=900048" title="John I. Cox">
<text>John Isaac Cox (November 23, 1855 – September 5, 1946) was an American politician who served as the 29th governor of Tennessee from 1905 to 1907. He was elevated to the position when Governor James B. Frazier resigned, and, as Speaker of the Tennessee Senate, he was the first in the line of succession. He failed to win his party&#x27;s nomination for a second term, and returned to the state senate, where he remained until 1913. Cox also served as a county judge, city attorney, and local postmaster, and spent two terms in the Tennessee House of Representatives.

The Tennessee state flag was adopted during Cox&#x27;s term as governor.

==Early life==
Cox was born in Sullivan County, Tennessee, the son of Henry and Martha (Smith) Cox. His father was a Confederate soldier during the Civil War, and was killed in fighting in 1863. To help his family, young John worked for several years as a farm laborer before becoming a rural mail carrier at the age of 16. Two years later, he was appointed Road Commissioner of Sullivan County. He served as a justice of the peace in the late 1870s.

Cox was educated at field schools in Sullivan County, and attended Jefferson Academy in Blountville for at least one term. He began reading law with Judge William V. Deaderick (his future father-in-law) in 1880, and was admitted to the bar shortly afterward. He practiced in Blountville for several years before being elected Judge of Sullivan County in 1886.

In 1889, Cox moved to Bristol, where he served as a district attorney. He was elected to the state House of Representatives in 1892, but served only one term. He was elected to the state senate in 1900.

==Governor==

In early 1905, following his reelection to a third state senate term, Cox was elevated to Speaker of that body, which in Tennessee is the governor&#x27;s designated successor. On March 9, U.S. Senator William B. Bate died in office, prompting a scramble among potential candidates for his vacant senate seat. Former Governor Robert Love Taylor had for years tried unsuccessfully to get elected to the Senate, and considered himself next in line should one of the two seats become vacant. Governor James B. Frazier, however, also wanted the seat, and quickly convened a special session of the General Assembly to have himself elected before Taylor could return from a speaking tour.

On March 21, Frazier resigned and headed to Washington, D.C., to take his seat in the Senate, and Cox, as the constitutional successor, was sworn in as governor. Taylor and his supporters were furious at Frazier&#x27;s actions, and accused Cox and the state&#x27;s other U.S. senator, Edward W. Carmack, of conspiring with Frazier. Fearing a split in the party, state Democrats allowed Taylor to challenge Carmack in a statewide primary in 1906 (this was the first Senate primary in state history, as U.S. senators were chosen by state legislatures prior to the adoption of the 17th Amendment), which Taylor won. Bitterness toward Frazier and skepticism of Cox remained, however.

Cox continued Frazier&#x27;s policies and made few administrative changes. He implemented quarantines in an effort to eradicate yellow fever, which had long plagued the swampy western part of the state, and called up the state guard to protect strikebreakers at a coal mine in Tracy City during a miners&#x27; strike in 1905. He also dealt with rampant prison rioting, and increased pensions for Confederate veterans and spouses. In April 1905, a few weeks after Cox took office, the current Flag of Tennessee, designed by Colonel LeRoy Reeves of Johnson City, was adopted.

In the gubernatorial race of 1906, Malcolm R. Patterson of Memphis challenged Cox for the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination. He quickly gained the support of a number of party leaders, including former governors Robert Love Taylor and Benton McMillin, who blamed Cox for engineering Frazier&#x27;s controversial election in the General Assembly. At the party&#x27;s convention in late May, Patterson and Cox engaged in a fierce battle for delegates, and though it was close, a rule change allowed Patterson to claim all delegates from Davidson County, and he was declared the nominee on June 1. Cox refused to support Patterson in the general election, and the two remained at odds in subsequent months.

In 1908, Colonel Duncan Cooper, a Patterson advisor, arranged for a meeting between Cox and Patterson that helped mend the ties between the two. Ex-Senator Carmack, a Patterson opponent, published a newspaper article in October 1908 ruthlessly mocking Cooper for arranging the meeting. On November 8, Carmack was shot and killed by Cooper&#x27;s son, Robin, in downtown Nashville.

==Later life==

Cox remained in the state senate until 1913. He served another term as a state representative from 1913 until 1915, and was the postmaster of Bristol from 1914 to 1922. He afterward retired to his farm in the Holston Hills section of Bristol, but continued stumping for Democratic Party politicians. In the 1930s, he campaigned for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and supported the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority.

Cox died on September 5, 1946, at George Ben Johnston Hospital in Abingdon, Virginia, following a long struggle with kidney illness. His was 90 years and 9 months old, becoming the longest-lived governor in Tennessee history (Tom Rye also lived to 90, but was shy by 6 months of tying Cox). In April 2018, Winfield Dunn (b. July 1927) broke Cox&#x27;s longevity record and as of July 2019, has surpassed his 92nd birthday to become the longest-lived governor in Tennessee history.

==Family==

Cox married Laura Deaderick, daughter of his law mentor, William Deaderick, in 1882. They had one son, William, before she died in 1885. In 1889, Cox married Lorena Butler. They had two children, Matthew and Mary. Lorena Butler was a cousin of the Taylor brothers, Robert Love and Alf, who both also served as governors.

<text>Celtic field is an old name for traces of early (prehistoric) agricultural field systems found in North-West Europe, i.e. Britain, Ireland, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, France, Sweden, Poland and the Baltic states. The fields themselves are not related to the Celtic culture.

The name was given by O. G. S. Crawford. They are sometimes preserved in areas where industrial farming has not been adopted and can date from any time from the Early Bronze Age (c. 1800 BC) until the early medieval period. They can be preserved as earthworks or soil marks.

They are characterised by their proximity to other ancient features such as enclosures, sunken lanes and farmsteads and are divided into a patchwork quilt of square plots rarely more than in area although larger examples are known (e.g. Dorset and Wiltshire). Their small size (35–50 m; 40–55 yd) implies that each was cultivated by a single person or household.

Lynchets, evidence of early ploughing can often be seen at the upper and lower ends. Large scale Roman agriculture replaced them in lowland Britain and they are more common in less accessible regions such as the West Country.

<text>William Caesar Warfield (January 22, 1920 – August 25, 2002) was an American concert bass-baritone, known for his appearances in stage productions, Hollywood films, and television programs. A prominent African American artist during the Civil Rights era, he worked with many notable artists, represented the United States during foreign tours, taught at academic institutions, and earned numerous accolades, including a Grammy Award in 1984.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Warfield was born in West Helena, Arkansas, the oldest of five sons of a Baptist minister. He grew up in Rochester, New York, where his father was the pastor of Mt. Vernon Church. In 1938, as a senior at Washington High School in Rochester, he won the Music Educators National Song Competition in St. Louis and expressed an interest in pursuing a career on the concert stage. Inducted into the U.S. Army in November 1942 during World War II, Warfield, a senior at the Eastman School of Music, presented his graduation recital before an overflow audience at Kilbourn Hall, Eastman Theater on November 18. He attended his graduation ceremony the following May in military uniform. After earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1942 and serving in the military, he returned to the Eastman School to complete a master&#x27;s degree in 1946.

According to a recent exhibit about WWII, Warfield was one of less than one hundred African American members of the Ritchie Boys, thousands of soldiers who were trained at Fort Ritchie, Maryland. It was an intelligence center where hundreds of Jewish recruits who fled Nazi Germany for the United States were trained to interrogate their one-time countrymen. According to the exhibit at the Zekelman Holocaust Memorial Center in Farmington Hills, Michigan, Warfield was brought to the camp because of his strong German skills which he perfected while studying music. Because of segregation, his skills were never put to use.

According to Warfield, upon induction into the Army he was initially assigned to the ordnance department to be a truck driver, but after he objected, citing his language skills, he was assigned to Ft. Ritchie, where he was in charge of stage shows and spoke fluently with German, Italian and French soldiers in their native languages.

He was discharged from the Army, where he had served in military intelligence, in 1946. Later that year he was cast in the road show tour of Call Me Mister. According to Warfield, that road show cast included William Marshall, Carl Reiner, Buddy Hackett and Bob Fosse. Over the next three years he also appeared in &quot;Set My People Free&quot; and the opera Regina, while also studying with and Otto Herz of the veteran&#x27;s training program of the American Theatre Wing.

He gave his recital debut in New York&#x27;s Town Hall on March 19, 1950. He was quickly invited by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to tour Australia and give 35 concerts. In 1952, Warfield performed in &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; during a tour of Europe sponsored by the U.S. State Department (he made six separate tours for the US Department of State, more than any other American solo artist). In this production, he played opposite the opera star Leontyne Price, whom he soon married, but the demands of two separate careers left them little time together. They divorced in 1972, but were featured together in a 1963 studio recording of excerpts from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

In 1969 he participated in an oratorio in Riverside Park with youth from the New York All-City High School Chorus as a public service. His dear friend and colleague Marian Anderson invited the youth to her home in Connecticut afterwards. Warfield accompanied the youth; it was the same weekend as the Woodstock Festival that some of the youth’s friends went to instead. 

In 1975, William was a soloist with the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, in the Naumburg Bandshell, Central Park, in the summer series. That same year he accepted an appointment as Professor of Music at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He later became Chairman of the Voice Department. In 1994, he moved to Northwestern University&#x27;s School of Music, where he stayed until his death.

He sang the premiere performances of the version for soloist and orchestra of Set I of Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Old American Songs&quot; in 1955, and of the version for soloist and piano of Set II of the collection in 1958. (He also recorded both sets of the songs.) His vocal talents were also featured on two recordings of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; – a classic, but heavily cut, performance by the Philadelphia Orchestra under the direction of Eugene Ormandy (released in 1959), and a lesser-known, drastically restructured recording made in 1956, also heavily cut, with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic. Bernstein combined the Christmas and Resurrection sections and ended with the arias and choruses depicting the death of Jesus. The Ormandy recording featured the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and Bernstein&#x27;s the Westminster Choir.

Warfield was also accomplished in acting and poetry recitation. He played the character &quot;The Lord&quot; in a celebrated &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; television production of &quot;The Green Pastures&quot;, a role he played twice on live TV (both versions survive as kinescopes). He appeared in two Hollywood films, including a star-making performance as Joe in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s 1951 Technicolor remake of &quot;Show Boat&quot;. His other film was called &quot;Old Explorers&quot; (1990), starring James Whitmore and José Ferrer. In a nod to &quot;Show Boat&quot;, Warfield played a cameo role as a tugboat captain. Footage of Warfield in &quot;Show Boat&quot; has been included in several TV shows and/or films, notably &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot;. Warfield played his &quot;Show Boat&quot; role in two other productions of the musical – the 1966 Lincoln Center production, and a 1972 production in Vienna. He sang &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; in three different record albums of the show – the 1951 motion picture soundtrack album on MGM Records, a 1962 studio album featuring Barbara Cook and John Raitt on Columbia Masterworks, and the RCA Victor album made from the Lincoln Center production.

He made an appearance on &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; and on a program called &quot;TV Recital Hall&quot; in 1951, the same year that he made his screen debut in &quot;Show Boat&quot;. He later appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1955. In 1961, he appeared as a recital soloist on an episode of the Young People&#x27;s Concerts, conducted by Leonard Bernstein. In March 1984 he was the winner of a Grammy Award in the &quot;Spoken Word&quot; category for his outstanding narration of Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln Portrait&quot;, accompanied by the Eastman Philharmonia . And in the 1990s, he narrated a special jazz arrangement of music from &quot;Show Boat&quot;, on the PRI program Riverwalk Jazz. In 1999, Warfield joined baritones Robert Sims and Benjamin Matthews in a trio by the name of &quot;Three Generations&quot;. Managed by Arthur White, this ensemble toured the United States giving full concerts of African-American spirituals and folk songs until Warfield&#x27;s death in 2002.

===Decline and death===
Beginning in 1962, Warfield began to have trouble with his voice, a situation he described in his autobiography. By 1966 his voice had deepened from bass-baritone to a full-fledged bass, and he could not sing the climactic high note on &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; as easily as he had in the 1951 film version. To compensate he had to sing even more expressively than he had before. 

By 1976, Warfield, although still making various stage and television appearances, was not singing as much as he had in the past. He served as narrator in various orchestral works, such as Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln Portrait&quot;, and occasionally performed &quot;sprechstimme&quot; roles in works by Arnold Schoenberg. In the summer of 1976, he reprised his role as Porgy in a Lake George Opera Festival production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. Despite his issues, he did sing on occasion during his final years, despite the fact that by then his singing voice was practically gone. In those years, when he sang &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, he would not perform it with the original lyrics, but with the altered ones that Paul Robeson used in his recitals beginning in 1938. 

He died in Chicago in August 2002, following treatment at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, succumbing to injuries he sustained in his neck from a fall a month prior.

==Membership of organizations==
Warfield was active in many organizations, after appearing as the featured artist at the 50th year convention of the National Association of Negro Musicians , he became active with the organization, serving as its president for two terms. He later served on the boards of the NANM and the Schiller Institute. After joining the Schiller Institute in 1996, he began to collaborate with acclaimed vocal coach Sylvia Olden Lee in a project to save the performance tradition of the Negro spiritual. During the final years of his life, from 1999 to 2002, he performed regularly at Schiller Institute biannual conferences, often with Olden Lee as his accompanist, and the two of them traveled the country conducting singing workshops for members of the LaRouche Youth Movement. Warfield was made an honorary member of the Delta Lambda chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia at Ball State University in 1961, and awarded the Fraternity&#x27;s Charles E. Lutton Man of Music Award in 1976 at its national convention in Evansville, Indiana.

==Legacy==
The William Warfield Scholarship Fund was formed in 1977 to support young African American classical singers at the Eastman School of Music. His nephew, Thomas Warfield, has presided over the fund. Recipients include Claron McFadden and Nicole Cabell.

<text>Shere Hite ( ; November 2, 1942 – September 9, 2020) was an American-born German sex educator and feminist. Her sexological work focused primarily on female sexuality. Hite built upon biological studies of sex by Masters and Johnson and by Alfred Kinsey and was the author of &quot;The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study on Female Sexuality&quot;. She also referenced theoretical, political and psychological works associated with the feminist movement of the 1970s, such as Anne Koedt&#x27;s essay &quot;The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm&quot;. She renounced her United States citizenship in 1995 to become German.

==Early life, education, and career==
According to Katharine Q. Seelye, Hite was born Shirley Diana Gregory in St. Joseph, Missouri to Paul and Shirley Hurt Gregory. Shortly after the end of World War II, her parents divorced. When her mother remarried, she took the surname of her stepfather Raymond Hite. According to her friend Joanna Briscoe, Hite had never known her father, and had been abandoned twice by her mother; her grandparents raised her until they divorced, and she was sent to be raised by an aunt.

Hite graduated from Seabreeze High School in Daytona Beach, Florida. After she received a master&#x27;s degree in history from the University of Florida in 1967, she moved to New York City and enrolled at Columbia University to work toward her Ph.D. in social history. Hite said that the reason for her not completing this degree was the conservative nature of Columbia at that time. She posed in the nude for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine while studying at Columbia University.

In the 1970s, she did part of her research while at the National Organization for Women. Her most well-known work, &quot;The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study on Female Sexuality&quot;, was published in 1976.

In 1988, she made an extended appearance on the British TV discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;, alongside James Dearden, Mary Whitehouse, Joan Wyndham, and Naim Attallah.

In 1989, she was interviewed in London by Joanna Briscoe, who later became her friend, and whose flat she often lived in. Eighteen months later she left the United States because of &quot;vicious media attacks, doorstepping, public humiliation and death threats, all of which contributed to the loss of her American publishers and of her ability to make a living&quot;, despite &quot;The Hite Report&quot; selling 50 million copies, estimated to be the 30th bestselling book of all time. According to Briscoe she commuted between Paris, the Kensington Hilton and a mattress on the floor of a squat in north London, and perpetually swung between spending and thrift. Between 1991 and 1997, she lived largely in France and Briscoe&#x27;s small flat. She tended to write all night and sleep all day. Briscoe said that Hite &quot;had an extraordinary effect on people – possessing a strange, delicate charisma that hooked them&quot;.

Hite taught at Nihon University (Tokyo, Japan), Chongqing University in China, and Maimonides University in North Miami Beach, Florida.

==Research focus==
Hite focused on understanding how individuals regard sexual experience and the meaning it holds for them. Hite believed that the ease at which women orgasm during masturbation contradicted traditional stereotypes about female sexuality. Hite&#x27;s work concluded that 70% of women do not have orgasms through in-out, thrusting intercourse but are able to achieve orgasm easily by masturbation or other direct clitoral stimulation.

Hite, as well as Elisabeth Lloyd, criticized Masters and Johnson for uncritically incorporating cultural attitudes on sexual behavior into their research; for example, the argument that enough clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm should be provided by thrusting during intercourse and the inference that the failure of this is a sign of female &quot;sexual dysfunction.&quot; While not denying that both Kinsey and Masters and Johnson have played a crucial role in sex research, Hite believed that society must understand the cultural and personal construction of sexual experience to make the research relevant to sexual behavior outside the laboratory. She offered that limiting test subjects to &quot;normal&quot; women who report orgasming during coitus was basing research on the faulty assumption that having an orgasm during coitus was typical, something that her own research strongly refuted.

==Methodology==
Hite used an individualistic research method. Thousands of responses from anonymous questionnaires were used as a framework to develop a discourse on human responses to gender and sexuality. Her conclusions were met with methodological criticism. The fact that her data are not probability samples raises concerns about whether the sample data can be generalized to relevant populations. As is common with surveys concerning sensitive subjects such as sexual behavior, the proportion of nonresponse is typically large. Thus the conclusions derived from the data may not represent the views of the population under study because of sampling bias due to nonresponse.

Hite has been praised for her theoretical fruitfulness in sociological research. The suggestion of bias in some of Hite&#x27;s studies is frequently used as a talking point in university courses where sampling methods are discussed, along with &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; poll of 1936. One discussion of sampling bias is by Philip Zimbardo, who explained that women in Hite&#x27;s study were given a survey about marriage satisfaction, where 98% reported dissatisfaction, and 75% reported having had extra-marital affairs, but where only 4% of women given the survey responded. Zimbardo argued that the women who had dissatisfaction may have been more motivated to respond than women who were satisfied and that her research may just have been &quot;science-coded journalism.&quot; Some or all of her published surveys depended on wide multi-channel questionnaire distribution, opportunity for many long answers on a respondent&#x27;s own schedule, enforced respondent anonymity, and response by mail rather than polling by telephone. Sharon Lohr argues that the distribution of questionnaires to women&#x27;s organizations and the length of the questions and the allowance for long responses introduces a bias towards people who are not typical. She also argues that several of the questions are leading the respondent to reply in a particular way.

==Personal life==

In 1985, Hite married German concert pianist Friedrich Höricke, who was 19 years her junior. The couple divorced in 1999. Hite married Paul Sullivan in 2012. They moved across Europe multiple times together, settling in north London, England.

In 1995, Hite renounced her U.S. citizenship at the former Embassy of the United States in Bonn. She accepted German nationality because she regarded German society as more tolerant and open-minded about her endeavors.

<text>The Jewish National Fund (JNF; , &quot;Keren Kayemet LeYisrael&quot;; previously , &quot;Ha Fund HaLeumi&quot;) is a non-profit organization founded in 1901 to buy land and encourage Jewish resettlement in Ottoman Syria (later Mandatory Palestine, subsequently Israel and the Palestinian territories) for Jewish settlement. By 2007, it owned 13% of the total land in Israel. Since its inception, the JNF has planted over 240 million trees in Israel. It has also built 180 dams and reservoirs, developed of land and established more than 1,000 parks.

In 2002, the JNF was awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement and special contribution to society and the State of Israel.

==Name==
The name &quot;Keren Kayemet&quot; comes from the Mishnah. Tractate Peah (1:1) lists the types of good deeds whose rewards are enjoyed in this world, while the principal merit will be in the world to come: .

==History==

The idea of a national land purchasing fund was first presented at the First Zionist Congress in 1897 by Hermann Schapira, a Lithuanian-Jewish professor of mathematics. The fund, named Keren Hakayemet (later known in English as the &quot;Jewish National Fund&quot;) was formally established at the Fifth Zionist Congress in Basel in 1901. In its early years, the organization was headed by the Jewish industrialist Johann Kremenezky. Early land purchases were completed in Judea and the Lower Galilee. In 1909, the JNF played a central role in the founding of Tel Aviv. The establishment of the &quot;Olive Tree Fund&quot; marked the beginning of Diaspora support of afforestation efforts. The JNF collection box or &quot;blue box&quot; (known in Yiddish as a &quot;pushke&quot;) has been part of the JNF since its inception, symbolizing the partnership between Israel and the Diaspora. In the period between the two world wars, about one million of these blue and white tin collection boxes could be found in Jewish homes throughout the world. From 1902 until the late 1940s, the JNF sold JNF stamps to raise money. For a brief period in May 1948, JNF stamps were used as postage stamps during the transition from Palestine to Israel.

===Ottoman era===
The first parcel of land, east of Hadera, was received as a gift from the Russian Zionist leader Isaac Leib Goldberg of Vilnius, in 1903. It became an olive grove. In 1904 and 1905, the JNF purchased land plots near the Sea of Galilee and at Ben Shemen. In 1921, JNF land holdings reached 25,000 acres (100 km²), rising to 50,000 acres (200 km²) by 1927. At the end of 1935, JNF held 89,500 acres (362 km²) of land housing 108 Jewish communities.

===British Mandate===


In 1939, 10% of the Jewish population of the British Mandate of Palestine lived on JNF land. By 1948, the JNF owned 54% of the land held by Jews in the region, or a bit less than 4% of the land in what was then known as the British Mandate of Palestine. By the eve of statehood, the JNF had acquired a total of of land; another had been acquired by other Jewish organizations or individuals. Most of the JNF&#x27;s activities during the Mandatory period were closely associated with Yossef Weitz, the head of its settlement department.

From the beginning, JNF&#x27;s policy was to lease land long-term rather than sell it. In its charter, the JNF states: &quot;Since the first land purchase in Eretz Israel in the early 1900s for and on behalf of the Jewish People, JNF has served as the Jewish People&#x27;s trustee of the land, initiating and charting development work to enable Jewish settlement from the border in the north to the edge of the desert and Arava in the south.&quot;

===State of Israel===

After Israel&#x27;s establishment in 1948, the government began to sell absentee lands to the JNF. On January 27, 1949, 1,000 km² of land (from a total of about 3,500 km²) was sold to the JNF for the price of IL11 million. Another 1,000 km² of land was sold to the JNF in October 1950. Over the years questions about the legitimacy of these transactions have been raised but Israeli legislation has generally supported the JNF&#x27;s land claims.

In 1953, the JNF was dissolved and re-organized as an Israeli company under the name &quot;Keren Kayemet LeYisrael&quot; (JNF-KKL). In 1960, administration of the land held by the JNF-KKL, apart from forested areas, was transferred to a newly formed government agency, the Israel Land Administration (ILA). The ILA was then responsible for managing some 93% of the land of Israel. All the land managed by the ILA was defined as &quot;Israel lands&quot;; it included both land owned by the government (about 80%) and land owned by the JNF-KKL (about 13%). The JNF-KKL received the right to nominate 10 of the 22 directors of the ILA, lending it significant leverage within that state body.

After concentrating on the centre and northern part of the young state, the JNF-KKL started supporting Jewish settlements around the Negev border from around 1965. After the Six-Day War in 1967, the JNF-KKL started work in the newly occupied Palestinian territories as well.

==Reclamation projects==
The JNF charter specifies the reclamation of land for the Jewish people as its primary purpose. During the 1980s, almost were planted. Over of crop-land were reclaimed, and hundreds of miles of roads built. Research into the soil and water conservation and the construction of dams and reservoirs took on added importance in the face of water shortages and drought.

The JNF&#x27;s collaborative work involves participation in the International Arid Land Consortium, which explores the problems and solutions unique to arid and semiarid regions, working to develop sustainable ecological practices to improve the quality of life among people in the dry areas.

===Afforestation===


The early JNF was active in afforestation and reclamation of land. By 1935, JNF had planted 1.7 million trees over a total area of 1,750 acres (7.08 km²) and drained swamps, like those in the Hula Valley. Over fifty years, the JNF planted over 260 million trees largely in semi-arid, rocky, hilly terrain in which cultivation is not cost-effective and the risk of land degradation is high. While the Ministry of Agriculture is the official regulator of Israel&#x27;s forests, the JNF is responsible for the implementation of forest management and afforestation.
In 2006, the JNF signed a 49-year lease agreement with the State of Israel which gives it control over of Negev land for the development of forests. The JNF has been criticized for planting non-native pine trees which are unsuited to the climate, rather than local species such as olive trees. Others say that JNF deserves credit for this decision, and the forests would not have survived otherwise. According to JNF statistics, six out of every 10 saplings planted at a JNF site in Jerusalem do not survive, although the survival rate for planting sites outside Jerusalem is much higher – close to 95 percent. The Israeli newspaper &quot;Maariv&quot; wrote that workers remove saplings daily to allow more tourists to plant the following day, but the JNF denied this and said it would sue the paper for libel. The Union for Environmental Defense has criticized the fund&#x27;s forestry practices for &quot;overreliance on highly flammable pine trees&quot; and overuse of toxic herbicides, in the context of minimal government and public scrutiny. Some forests have been planted for security reasons and as a means of demarcating Israeli space. Critics argue that many JNF lands outside the West Bank were illegally confiscated from Palestinian refugees, and that the JNF furthermore should not be involved with lands in the West Bank. Shaul Ephraim Cohen has said trees have been planted to restrict Bedouin herding. Susan Nathan wrote that forests were planted on the site of abandoned Arab villages after the 1948 war. Nathan also writes that olive trees were replaced by pine and cypress trees and that JNF afforestation policy erases traces of the Arab presence prior to 1948. In 2008, the JNF announced that historical information plaques erected in JNF parks and forests would cite the names of the Arab villages formerly located there.

Since 2009, the JNF has been helping the Palestinian Authority plan public parks and other civic amenities for the Palestinian city of Rawabi, north of Ramallah. The JNF provided the Palestinian Authority with 3,000 tree seedlings for a forested area being developed on the edge of the new city.

===Water conservation===
Israel&#x27;s fresh water supply is dependent on 50 days a year of seasonal rainfall, while water consumption has doubled since 1960. Towards the end of the 1980s, the JNF undertook several large-scale water conservation projects. Dams and reservoirs were built to capture rainwater run-off which would have otherwise been lost in the Arava Valley, Reshafim in the Beit She&#x27;arim Valley and Kedma near Kiryat Gat. An artificial lake was built in Timna Park.

The JNF has built 200 reservoirs around the country, and plans to build 30 more reservoirs and water treatment plants over the next five years. Over the past decade, JNF has invested over $114.99 million in reservoir construction, increasing the country&#x27;s total storage capacity by 7%, to over of water. JNF is also involved in river rehabilitation projects all over Israel, such as the Nahal Alexander Restoration Project begun in 2003.

===Land development===

The JNF&#x27;s engagement in developing Israel for Jewish purposes has involved a range of massive land infrastructure development projects. In the 1980s, the JNF launched a project known collectively as &quot;Operation Promised Land&quot;, to meet the challenge of the massive upsurge of Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union and Ethiopia. In recent years, the JNF has again moved towards the development of towns to accommodate new Jewish immigrants, focusing on the Galilee and Negev regions, the two areas of Israel with a tenuous Jewish demographic majority. In particular, the JNF&#x27;s 600 million dollar Blueprint Negev aims to attract and build infrastructure for 250,000 new settlers in the Negev desert, which accounts for 60% of the country&#x27;s land mass but remains sparsely populated. The plan has come under scrutiny as groups such as Bustan, Save the Negev, and Ohalah have expressed concern over the project&#x27;s lack of transparency in light of the potential strain on ecological resources and the possible impacts on Bedouin communities nearby.

== Funding of Israeli military infrastructure and West Bank settlements ==
In addition to its reclamation and other charitable projects, the JNF also funded infrastructure projects on Israel Defense Forces sites. Documents by the JNF indicated that funds from the Canadian branch were used to fund projects including Camp Ariel Sharon in the Negev, an auditorium and training facilities at an Israeli Navy base in Bat Galim, and mess halls for the 124 Squadron and 131 Squadron of the Israeli Air Force at the Palmachim and Nevatim Airbases. A 2014 document by the JNF notes that funds from its Canadian branch were used for a dozen &quot;KKL for IDF&quot; projects in the previous decade. A JNF Canada document from the same year pitched donors on an IDF family meeting centre for members in active service as well as a road at the Israeli-Egyptian border to &quot;improve access to the area for security forces&quot; to be developed in coordination with the IDF. 

A document by JNF&#x27;s Canadian branch stated that it had helped develop an outdoor fitness area at a military base in Sde Boker for the Gadna program, which prepares young Israelis for IDF service. Regular army personnel could also use the area. Similarly, in 2014, the JNF Canada&#x27;s Edmonton branch stated that it was funding a family visitation area, a plaza by the barracks, and an intake and release facility at Tze&#x27;elim Army Base.

In 2016, the JNF also funded a soccer field at Hatzerim Airbase.

JNF&#x27;s Canadian branch also helped construct a hilltop settler outpost, Givat Oz VeGaon, which was deemed illegal by the Israeli government and received at least 18 demolition orders from the Ministry of Defense.

==International fundraising==
===United States===

The United States branch of the JNF, incorporated on January 26, 1926, is the largest contributor to JNF-KKL. In 1996, JNF-USA was accused of mismanaging funds. According to the charges, only 21% of US donations reached Israel, and money was being diverted to Latin American JNF offices. In the wake of this scandal, the North American management was forced to resign. The tax-exempt status of the JNF-USA was challenged in 2011 as violating the public policy of the United States with respect to ethnic and religious discrimination. In July 2017, in response to an investigation by the &quot;Jewish Daily Forward&quot;, the New York State attorney general&#x27;s office ordered JNF-USA to rescind two illegal loans totaling more than $500,000 the organization had made to its chief executive officer, Russell Robinson, and its chief financial officer, Mitchel Rosenzweig. (New York State forbids charities from lending their officers any money.) JNF-USA argued that Robinson and Rosenzweig were not officers under the meaning of the law, but the attorney general&#x27;s officer rejected that argument and the two executives agreed to repay the balance of their loans.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the JNF-UK (full name &quot;JNF Charitable Trust&quot;) was formed in 1939 and registered as a charitable organization. In October 2005, the JNF-KKL in Israel split from its British partner, accusing JNF-UK of having &quot;misled&quot; the public. The JNF-KKL claimed that the British group was using the KKL name to raise funds &quot;for their own causes which are not associated with KKL.&quot; The Israeli JNF-KKL said it would launch a separate fundraising operation in the UK. JNF-UK launched a legal action to stop KKL using the names &quot;JNF&quot; or &quot;Jewish National Fund&quot; in the UK. The two organisations made peace after the Israeli-born businessman Samuel Hayek took over as JNF-UK chairman in 2008. Israeli JNF-KKL ended its dispute with the JNF-UK within weeks of ending a similar dispute with the American JNF-USA On 1 May 2020 a ruling was issued to JNF on a will writing service encouraging elderly to leave money to KKL. District Judge Geddes noted on KKL&#x27;s &quot;lack of independence from JNF UK&quot;

The charitable status of the JNF-UK has come under increasing attack. British prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had been Honorary Patrons of the JNF-UK, like all British prime ministers before them since its inception. David Cameron resigned as Honorary Patron to JNF-UK in 2011. According to a spokesman, Cameron said it was an organisation that was specifically focused around work in one specific country—i.e., Israel. Cameron&#x27;s decision was interpreted as a snub, in spite of the spokesman&#x27;s assurances that his decision had &quot;absolutely nothing to do with any anti-Israel campaign&quot;. However, campaigners claimed that Cameron&#x27;s resignation was due to political pressure. Since then, the JNF-UK&#x27;s Honorary Patrons include no leader of the main British political parties. An Early Day Motion in the British parliament called for the revocation of the JNF&#x27;s charitable status in the UK and was signed by 66 Members of Parliament. In 2012 the Green Party called for the JNF to be stripped of its charity status.

In December 2021, JNF-UK Chairman Samuel Hayek was embroiled in controversy, following remarks that implied that Muslim immigration was endangering the future of British Jews.

===Canada===
Following the Six-Day War, the Canadian branch of the JNF raised about $15 million US to fund a 1,700-acre park called &quot;Canada Park&quot;. The park was built in 1970 on the land of three Palestinian villages which were destroyed on the orders of Yitzhak Rabin. Starting around 2013, Independent Jewish Voices has campaigned against JNF Canada&#x27;s charitable status, and in 2017 it filed a formal complaint with the Canadian government seeking the revocation of JNF&#x27;s charitable status on the basis of discrimination.

In 2018, JNF Canada informed its members that it was under audit by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). The following year, CBC News reported how JNF had used charitable donations to fund Israeli military infrastructure. While Canadians can directly support foreign militaries in their personal capacity, the CRA rules ban tax receipts or tax deductions for such donations by charities. JNF told CBC that it had stopped funding military projects in 2016. 

In August 2024, the Canadian government announced the removal of JNF Canada&#x27;s charitable status. The CRA revealed 358 pages of documents explaining its decision, which outlined &quot;repeated and serious non-compliance&quot; with the laws governing charities. Reasons included doubts that JNF Canada carries out its stated charitable purpose, an insufficient paper trail documenting where money was going, missing records that the CRA did not have, some documents provided only in Hebrew, and housing documents in a foreign country (Israel). In response, JNF Canada has accused the CRA of &quot;targeted bias&quot;, while CEO Lance Davis said JNF Canada repeatedly asked for a conversation with the CRA to explain the discrepancies, but was repeatedly denied.

==JNF collection boxes==
JNF&#x27;s blue charity boxes were distributed by the JNF almost from its inception at the initiative of Johann Kremenezky. Once found in many Jewish homes, the boxes became one of the most familiar symbols of Zionism. A children&#x27;s song about the boxes, written by Dr. Yehoshua Frizman, Headmaster of the Real Gymnasium for Girls in Kovno, ran

A bank clerk named Haim Kleinman in Nadvorna, Galicia placed a blue box labeled &quot;Keren Le&#x27;umit&quot; in his office and urged others to do the same. The first mass-produced boxes were distributed in 1904. Kleinman visited Mandate Palestine in the 1930s and planned to make aliyah, but perished in the Holocaust. Menahem Ussishkin wrote that &quot;The coin the child contributes or collects for the redemption of the land is not important in itself; it is not the child that gives to the Keren Kayemeth, but rather the Fund that gives to the child, a foothold and lofty ideal for all the days of his life.&quot;

The boxes could take a variety of shapes and sizes. Some were paper made to fold flat like envelopes and able to contain only a small number of coins, some early American boxes were cylindrical, some German boxes were made of tin stamped into the shape of bound books.

Israel issued postage stamps bearing the image of the blue box in 1983, 1991, and 1993 for the JNF&#x27;s 90th anniversary.

==Controversies==
===Transparency===
T&#x27;ruah has expressed concerns that the JNF is not transparent about where their funds go and that the organization may be subsidizing projects in West Bank settlements. The organization&#x27;s chief executive later acknowledged that JNF does fund projects within settlements. A review of their tax filing from 2014 led Rabbi Jill Jacobs of T&#x27;ruah to estimate that about $600,000 of the $27.2 million in grants by JNF-USA went to support settlements. In 2021, JNF announced that it would change its policy and subsidize Israeli settlements in the West Bank. However, the necessary vote of the board was delayed indefinitely in April after opposition from members and supporters abroad.

Israeli lawmakers have sought, unsuccessfully, to allow the State Comptroller to examine the books of the organization to determine whether the group&#x27;s funds were being spent appropriately.

===Leasing policy controversy===

The JNF stipulates that only Jews can buy, mortgage or lease JNF land. Article 23 of the JNF lease states that the lessee must pay compensation to the JNF if this stipulation is violated.
On 13 October 2004, Adalah, an organization and legal center for Arab minority rights in Israel, submitted a petition to the Supreme Court entitled &quot;Challenging the Prohibition on Arab Citizens of Israel from Living on Jewish National Fund Land&quot;. Shortly afterwards, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and the Arab Center for Alternative Planning also filed a petition to the Supreme Court challenging the ILA policy as discriminatory. The JNF responded to the two petitions on 9 December. In its response, the JNF stated:

On 26 January 2005, Israel&#x27;s Attorney General Menachem Mazuz ruled that lease restrictions violated Israeli anti-discrimination laws, and that the ILA could not discriminate against Arab citizens of Israel in the marketing and allocation of the lands it managed; this applied both to government lands and to lands belonging to the JNF. However, the Attorney General also decided that, whenever a non-Jewish citizen wins an ILA tender for a plot of JNF-owned land, the ILA would compensate the JNF with an equal amount of land. This would allow the JNF to maintain its current hold over of land, or 13% of the total land in Israel.

As a result of the Mazuz ruling, authorities found themselves facing a conundrum: on the one hand the JNF, as a &quot;private&quot; organization, had received donations from outside Israel which were specifically earmarked for the benefit of Jews; on the other hand, the state and the ILA (an agency of the state), which administered the land owned by the JNF, were banned from discriminating against non-Jews. In early 2005, the JNF and the Finance Ministry were reported as trying to draft a new agreement that would separate the JNF from the state, thereby allowing it to continue selling land to Jews only.

In July 2007, the Israeli Knesset approved the &quot;Jewish National Fund Bill&quot;, submitted by MK Uri Ariel (National Union/National Religious Party), in its preliminary reading; but the bill was later dropped. The bill sought to authorize the JNF practice of refusing to lease land to Arab citizens. The bill called for a new provision to the &quot;1960 Israel Land Administration Law&quot;, entitled &quot;Management of the Jewish National Fund&#x27;s Lands&quot;; the provision stated that regardless of other conflicting rulings, leasing JNF lands for Jewish settlement did not constitute discrimination, and: &quot;For the purpose of every law, the association documents of the Jewish National Fund will be interpreted according to the judgment of the Jewish National Fund&#x27;s founders and from a nationalist-Zionist standpoint.&quot;

In September 2007, the High Court heard a further Adalah petition seeking cancellation of an ILA policy as well as Article 27 of the &quot;Regulations of the Obligations of Tenders&quot;, which in concert prevent Arab citizens from participating in bids for JNF-controlled land. The High Court of Justice agreed to delay a ruling by at least four months, and a temporary settlement was reached (following the compromise proposed in 2005 by Menachem Mazuz) wherein, although the JNF would be prevented from discriminating on grounds of ethnicity, nevertheless every time land is sold to a non-Jew, the ILA would compensate it with an equivalent amount of land, thus ensuring the total amount of land owned by Jewish Israelis remains the same.

An alternative proposal submitted by Amnon Rubinstein, a former minister, recommended that a distinction be made between JNF lands and state lands, such that all JNF lands directly acquired via donations from abroad specifically for the benefit of Jews (some ) will pass to the direct control of the JNF; while properties purchased by the JNF from the state in the 1950s and formerly belonging to Palestinian refugees (the so-called &quot;lands of missing persons&quot; or &quot;absentee&quot; lands, amounting to ) would revert to state control. Rubinstein&#x27;s intention was &quot;to avoid passing racist legislation [such as the Ariel Bill] that would limit the use of these lands to the Jews&quot;. Others denied however that the Ariel Bill was racist.
The Rubinstein proposal was not taken up.

In late 2007, a land swap deal was proposed that would allow the JNF to continue leasing its lands only to Jews. Urban JNF land sold in future to non-Jews would include an automatic swap mechanism: the fund would transfer the land to the ILA, and in exchange would receive the purchase price plus a similar-sized plot in the Negev.

===Legal conflicts===
In December 2011, Seth Morrison resigned from the board of JNF-USA in protest at the decision by Himnuta, a subsidiary of JNF-KKL, to launch eviction proceedings against the Sumarin family, who lived in the Silwan neighborhood of East Jerusalem. In the case of the Sumarin family, the children of the original owner, Musa Sumarin, were declared absentees after his death even though there were other family members living in the home at the time. In 1991, the Israeli government took the step of transferring the property to the JNF subsidiary. A campaign against the JNF&#x27;s eviction was launched by Rabbis for Human Rights, the Sheikh Jarrah Solidarity Movement, and the Jewish organization Yachad. The pressures led the JNF to delay the eviction. The JNF played a similar role in evicting the Gozlan family in the 1990s.

<text>Philippe Flajolet (; 1 December 1948 – 22 March 2011) was a French computer scientist.

==Biography==
A former student of École Polytechnique, Philippe Flajolet received his PhD in computer science from University Paris Diderot in 1973 and state doctorate from Paris-Sud 11 University in 1979. Most of Philippe Flajolet&#x27;s research work was dedicated towards general methods for analyzing the computational complexity of algorithms, including the theory of average-case complexity. He introduced the theory of analytic combinatorics. With Robert Sedgewick of Princeton University, he wrote the first book-length treatment of the
topic, the 2009 book entitled &quot;Analytic Combinatorics&quot;. In 1993, together with Rainer Kemp, Helmut Prodinger and Robert Sedgewick, Flajolet initiated the successful series of workshops and conferences which was key to the development of a research community around the analysis of algorithms, and which evolved into the AofA—International Meeting on Combinatorial, Probabilistic, and Asymptotic Methods in the Analysis of Algorithms.

A summary of his research up to 1998 can be found in the article &quot;Philippe Flajolet&#x27;s research in Combinatorics and Analysis of Algorithms&quot; by H. Prodinger and W. Szpankowski, &quot;Algorithmica&quot; 22 (1998), 366–387.

At the time of his death from a serious illness, Philippe Flajolet was a research director (senior research scientist) at INRIA in Rocquencourt.

From 1994 to 2003 he was a corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences, and was a full member from 2003 on. He was also a member of the Academia Europaea.

==Memory==
The HyperLogLog commands of Redis, released in April 2014, are prefixed with &quot;PF&quot; in honor of Philippe Flajolet. The Flajolet Lecture Prize, which has been awarded since 2014, was also named in honor of him.

Philippe Flajolet also received the 2019 Leroy P. Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society for his work in Mathematical Exposition. More specifically, for his book &quot;Analytic Combinatorics&quot; which he co-wrote with Robert Sedgewick and Professor William O. Baker.

<text>Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted (C.M.W.) is an American gangsta rap group and part of the early West Coast hip hop scene. The leaders of the group are MC Eiht and Tha Chill.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
C.M.W. included rappers MC Eiht, Tha Chill, DJ Mike T, and producers DJ Slip and The Unknown DJ.

In the mid-1980s, founding members Tha Chill and MC Eiht were writing raps and recording demo tapes (also called &quot;hood tapes&quot;) in their spare time while gang bangin&#x27; in their hood in Compton, CA. Tha Chill and MC Eiht chose to leave that street corner hustle scene in Compton and start making money in a legit but fun way when they saw their long time friend MC Ren of the multi platinum West Coast hip hop group N.W.A started to create a huge street buzz in the Los Angeles County area by releasing records along with Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, DJ Yella and Arabian Prince. In 1987, while in Compton, The Unknown DJ was given one of these &quot;hood tapes&quot; by a friend and became very interested in the diverse style and rhyme schemes of the &quot;Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; rap group. The Unknown DJ then took the &quot;hood tape&quot; to DJ Slip in Gardena, a city just west of Compton, who at the time was the owner of Los Angeles County&#x27;s largest DJ Rental business called &quot;Music People - DJ4HIRE&quot;.

In 1988, Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted, under the production leadership of Terry &quot;DJ Slip&quot; Allen, recorded their 1st ever professional songs called Rhymes To Funky. It was one of the many featured songs on the &quot;Sound Control Mob - Under Investigation&quot; Compton compilation album on &quot;Kru Cut / City Fresh Records&quot;, along with artist like: &quot;Vanilla C&quot;, &quot;PG 13&quot; and &quot;MC Looney Tunes A.K.A. MC Loon E Toons&quot;. This label was owned by Compton, CA. Executive producers Alonzo Williams A.K.A. &quot;Grandmaster Lonz&#x27; of the World Class Wreckin&#x27; Crew and Charles Turner.

In 1989, C.M.W. released their first single &quot;This Is Compton&quot; b/w &quot;Give It Up&quot; and &quot;I Give Up Nothin&#x27;&quot; (pt. 1) on The Unknown DJ Los Angeles-based record label Techno Hop Records. Techno Hop Records label was primarily an Electro genre label, but thru the futuristic mind of The Unknown DJ, he single-handedly launched the legendary west coast gangsta rap genre with songs by Ice-T &quot;6 In The Mornin&#x27;&quot; and King Tee &quot;Ya Better Bring A Gun&quot; featuring Mixmaster Spade. In the middle of recording this maxi single &quot;This Is Compton&quot; b/w &quot;Give It Up&quot; and &quot;I Give Up Nothin&#x27;&quot; managing misunderstanding started to occur between DJ Ant Capone who, along with his father &quot;Old Man Conway&quot;, were acting managers for C.M.W. on the &quot;Sound Control Mob - Under Investigation&quot; (Compton Compilation album) and The Unknown DJ. Soon after DJ Ant Capone choose to leave the group.

In 1990, C.M.W. released their first album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Compton Thang&quot; on Orpheus Records. It contained the hit single and video &quot;One Time Gaffled Em Up&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s a Compton Thang&quot; was entirely produced by DJ Slip and The Unknown DJ and all song lyrics were written by MC Eiht. During the recording of this album Tha Chill was arrested for joy riding, but was released a few weeks later on time served and finished recording his remaining verses on the songs of the album. The album peaked at #132 in the U.S. charts.
A year later in 1991, the group C.M.W. released their 2nd album, &quot;Straight Checkn &#x27;Em&quot;, which featured popular hits songs like &quot;Growin&#x27; Up In tha Hood&quot;, &quot;Driveby Miss Daisy&quot;, &quot;Compton&#x27;s Lynchin&#x27;&quot;, and the first version of the &quot;Def Wish&quot; series.. &quot;Growin&#x27; Up In The Hood&quot; was also released on Warner Bros for the John Singleton block buster movie &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; starring Ice Cube, Cuba Gooding Jr., Laurence Fishburne, Nia Long and Morris Chestnut. During the recording of this album Tha Chill once again was arrested and this time sent to prison. This altercation had happened some months before the album was released and Tha Chill did not have the chance to participate on any of the other songs recordings, except for the original album version of &quot;Growin&#x27; Up In the Hood&quot;. However, the album &quot;Straight Check&#x27;n Em&quot; was a bigger success than their previous album, peaking at #92 in the U.S. charts.

Again in 1992, the group released their third and most successful studio album, &quot;Music to Driveby&quot;. It featured the single &quot;Hood Took Me Under&quot; which the original song was produced by DJ Mike T and the remix single and video version by DJ Slip. This song charted at #5 in U.S. The &quot;Hood Took Me Under&quot; album version was also featured years later in 2004 on the popular PlayStation 2 video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas radio station, Radio Los Santos and in 2005 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox. MC Eiht also has a voice role on one of the game characters &quot;Ryder&quot;. The album charted at #66 in the U.S. U.S. charts and is considered a classic by many people. C.M.W. are known especially for their slow, often melancholic raps, using samples from 1970s soul and funk records such as &quot;Joy&quot; and &quot;Walk On By&quot; by Isaac Hayes and &quot;Love T.K.O.&quot; by Teddy Pendergrass. They are also known for using movie samples such as &quot;Scareface&quot; and &quot;Deep Cover&quot;. Freestyle keyboardist, saxophone and harmonica player Willie Zimmerman, though not officially a member, is used extensively on songs Drive By Miss Daisy, Def Wish, Niggaz Strugglin, U&#x27;s A Bitch, and Hood Rat.

On the Music To Driveby album song &quot;Who&#x27;s Fucking Who,&quot; produced by DJ Mike T and DJ Slip which took aimed at Bronx, NY old school rapper Timothy &quot;Tim Dog&quot; Blair. This whole altercation had begun while C.M.W. was on their album promotional tour for Straight Checkn&#x27; Em in 1990. While at a Sony music release party for all the labels under the Sony Corporation. Epic Records Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted and Columbia Records Tim Dog were at the party. C.M.W. met Tim Dog and he explained his reasons for recording the &quot;Fuck Compton&quot; song saying it was a personal beef against N.W.A&#x27;s Dr. Dre for an altercation with rapper/ television personality Dee Barnes from the rap video show &quot;Pump It Up&quot;. Tim Dog felt that since Dee Barnes was born in New York City he had to address the issue represent all New Yorkers in some type of way . He also stated that he didn&#x27;t like jeri curls and he also hated R&amp;B singer Michel&#x27;le&#x27;s voice. But all that changed while taking pictures when Tim Dog asked members DJ Mike T and MC Eiht to spread a message to all Compton and West Coast hip hop rappers that &quot;he was accepting all diss records and he wanted to start a U.T.F.O. style of dissing like the &quot;Roxanne Roxanne&quot; era. DJ Mike T got infuriated by the gimmick approach, knowing that the New York/ Los Angeles feud was about to boil over and Tim Dog rhyme style was getting outdated in New York by their next generation of rap. Once back on the West Coast DJ Mike T had to convince MC Eiht to write a song because MC Eiht already knowing thatTim Dog was already irrelevant with his one hit wonder. C.M.W. released their 2nd single/ video &quot;Def Wish 2&quot; was focused at well-known Compton rapper name DJ Quik after, MC Eiht fellow gang members convinced him that DJ Quik made a low key diss in a controversial statement on his &quot;underground tape&quot;, prior to his signing with Profile Records. &quot;Def Wish II&quot; along with &quot;Another Victim, Dead Men Tell No Lies, U&#x27;s A Bitch, Hood Rat&quot;, were the last 5 songs ever produced again by The Unknown DJ for Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted, before being relieved of his production contract from Epic Records for sub selling MC Eiht writers publishing, misdirecting funds and covering it up in a fraudulent business tax write-off. It was the last album C.M.W. released before their long hiatus.

Finally, after a break of eight years, C.M.W. released &quot;Represent&quot; in 2000 on the independent record label Half Ounce Records Inc. owned by MC Eiht, Boom Bam and deceased rapper Bird from Lil Hawk and Bird. The album featured the single &quot;This Is Compton 2000&quot; and &quot;Some May Know&quot;, but did not achieve the success of their previous albums.

In 2006, C.M.W. released &quot;Music to Gang Bang&quot; on B Dub Records, which contained four singles, most notably the single titled &quot;Music to Gang Bang&quot;, with original member MC Eiht and newest members &quot;Big 2Da Boy and Diamond Rich&quot;. However the album was not as commercially successful as previous releases.

In 2008, Compton rapper The Game revealed in an interview that he was in talks with MC Eiht to revive the group; however, this has yet to materialize.

===Solo careers===
By serving over 2 years in prison Tha Chill had missed recording on two of C.M.W. biggest albums &quot;Straight Checkn &#x27;Em&quot; and &quot;Music to Driveby&quot;. So MC Eiht had a better plan to revamp Tha Chill’s rapping career and choose to connect him with Compton rapper and fellow gang brother Boom Bam to form the group Niggas On The Run. Tha Chill agreed with MC Eiht plan and began to tour with C.M.W. opening up for all their shows with songs from N.O.T.R. In 1994, the N.O.T.R. rap album was shelved after the short release and member Tha Chill rejoined C.M.W. along with Boom Bam. Tha Chill had never let making a few mistakes in life shorten his goals on becoming a respected artist. Knowing how to play the drums at an early age he ventured in producing and started recording songs for MC Eiht, MC Ren, Compton rapper C.P.O., Kokane, Jayo Felony, Killafornia Organization, Wanted Gang, Chillafornia, 1st Generation rap group King Tee, Kurupt, MC Eiht, Jayo Felony, producers Battlecat and Sir Jinx, Diirty OG&#x27;z with Kurupt, Tray Dee and Weasel Loc and the list goes on. Tha Chill is due any day in 2017 to release his solo album
&quot;4 Wit 80&quot; written and produced by himself with some features of many popular artist and of all the original Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted members: MC Eiht, DJ Slip and DJ Mike T.

After &quot;Music To Driveby&quot;, MC Eiht had 3 albums left under contract with Epic Records and decided to pursue a solo career since he had already written the lyrics for all three C.M.W. previous albums. In 1994, MC Eiht debut solo album &quot;We Come Strapped&quot; featuring C.M.W. which was certified &quot;Gold&quot; after selling over 500,000 copies. In 1995, he released his 2nd solo album &quot;Death Threatz&quot; featuring C.M.W.

<doc id="900061" wikidata="Q341870" url="?curid=900061" title="Lynchet">
<text>A lynchet or linchet is an earth terrace found on the side of a hill. Lynchets are a feature of ancient field systems of the British Isles. They are commonly found in vertical rows and more commonly referred to as &quot;strip lynchets&quot;. Lynchets appear predominantly in Southern Britain and many are in areas close to Iron Age forts and other earthworks, including later Roman earthworks and earlier barrows from the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods. The size, location, spacing and number of rows of many strip lynchets indicates that many were man-made. It is most likely that lynchets were dug to maximise the use of land for agriculture, although they may have had other, ceremonial uses.

The word is the diminutive form of &quot;lynch&quot;, now rarely appearing in the English language, indicating an agricultural terrace; it is cognate with the golf &quot;links&quot;. However, both &quot;lynchet&quot; and &quot;lynch&quot; may also be used to refer to a strip of green land left between two pieces of ploughed land on non-sloping ground; or to a natural slope or terrace along the face of a chalk down.

The traditional theory on the formation of lynchets is that they may form naturally on the downslope of a field ploughed over a long period of time. The disturbed soil slips down the hillside to create a &quot;positive lynchet&quot; (where the new surface is higher than the original surface), while the area reduced in level becomes a &quot;negative lynchet&quot; (where the new surface is lower).
In Loders, Dorset, lynchets form a terraced band structure similar to an amphitheatre overlooking the village. Lynchets also form part of the conservation area of the neighbouring village of Uploders, where they apparently form old hillside field systems in close proximity to an Iron Age fort and hill-top barrows. 19th-century maps indicate that cider orchards were planted on some lynchets in that area.

<doc id="900068" wikidata="Q2415612" url="?curid=900068" title="Survival (Doctor Who)">
<text>Survival is the final serial of the 26th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in three weekly parts on BBC1 from 22 November to 6 December 1989. It is the final story of the original 26-year run; the show did not return as a series until 2005. The story marks the final regular television appearances of Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor and Sophie Aldred as Ace, and the final television appearance of Anthony Ainley as the Master, appearing alongside McCoy&#x27;s Doctor for the only time.

In the story, the Doctor brings Ace home to Perivale, where her friends have been transported to the planet of the Cheetah People.

==Plot==
The Seventh Doctor brings Ace back home to Perivale in west London. Ace becomes worried when most of her friends seem to have disappeared, but the Doctor is preoccupied with a black cat called a Kitling he sees skulking about. The Kitling appears to be selecting people and transporting them to parts unknown. Ace finds herself being hunted down by a creature on horseback, which seems to be half-human, half-cheetah, which hunts with the Kitling. The Doctor and a fitness instructor called Paterson are transported to another world, where the Doctor is confronted by the Master.

The Master explains the situation: they are on a sentient planet, which has the power to transform the inhabitants into Cheetah People. The originally human inhabitants, which have since evolved into Cheetah People, used the kitlings as pets. The Master shows signs of transformation and needs the Doctor&#x27;s help to escape from the planet.

Ace finds her friends Shreela and Midge hiding in the woods with a young man called Derek. A hunting pack attacks, and during the fight Midge kills one of the Cheetah People while Ace injures another, called Karra. She begins to form an attachment to Karra and treats her injuries, which causes the Doctor concern. Ace&#x27;s eyes change and she begins to transform into a Cheetah. 

Midge submits to the power of the planet and begins to transform. The Master uses Midge to transport both of them back to Earth. Ace helps the Doctor get back to Perivale, enabling Paterson, Derek and Shreela to flee the planet. The Doctor and Ace return to Perivale, where they find Midge and the Master have killed Paterson for sport. Midge is killed in the Master&#x27;s machinations. Karra&#x27;s arrival brings comfort to Ace, whose transformation is continuing, but the Master kills Karra. 

The Master transports the Doctor with him back to the Cheetah Planet for a final conflict, but the Doctor resists the pull of the planet, turning away from violence, and is transported away from the dying world. However, the Master is trapped on the planet as it begins to break up. The Doctor has gone back to the TARDIS and Earth, where he retrieves Ace.

==Production==

===Writing===
Writer Rona Munro approached script editor Andrew Cartmel at a BBC scriptwriting workshop and said that she&#x27;d &quot;kill to write for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.&quot; The story Munro developed incorporated themes including the morals of hunting (personified by the Cheetah People and signposted by Ace&#x27;s friend Ange collecting for hunt saboteurs). The title &quot;Survival&quot; was chosen by Cartmel. Munro was disappointed by the realisation of the Cheetah People:

===Recording===
&quot;Survival&quot; was one of only a handful of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials to be recorded completely on BBC Outside Broadcast video, instead of the mix of OB and studio video that was more common during the late 1980s, and the mix of film and video that was usual before. The other stories to be recorded solely on OB video were: &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot; (1975), &quot;Delta and the Bannermen&quot; (1987), &quot;Silver Nemesis&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot; (1989).

It was almost on the shooting days for the scenes on the planet of the Cheetah people. One of the extras removed her costume and simply walked off the set, causing delays while a replacement was found. The battle at the climax of the story was recorded and set on the site of the ancient hill fort at Horsenden Hill. The majority of location recording was done in and around Perivale, with small sections shot at nearby Ealing, and outside and near The Drayton Court pub.

===The final &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story of the original &#x27;Classic&#x27; series===
Having already realized that &quot;Survival&quot; was likely to be the last story of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to be produced for some time, and possibly the very last ever with the series unlikely to return for the forseeable future, the show&#x27;s producer John Nathan-Turner decided close to transmission that a more suitable conclusion and coda should be given to the third and final episode of this story. Script editor Andrew Cartmel wrote a short, melancholic closing monologue for Sylvester McCoy, which McCoy recorded on 23 November 1989, the day after episode one was broadcast and, by coincidence, the show&#x27;s twenty-sixth anniversary date:

&quot;There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, the sea&#x27;s asleep, and the rivers dream. People made of smoke, and cities made of song. Somewhere there&#x27;s danger, somewhere there’s injustice, and somewhere else the tea&#x27;s getting cold. Come on, Ace – we&#x27;ve got work to do!&quot;

This was dubbed over the closing scene as the Doctor and Ace walked off into the distance, apparently to further adventures. Although &quot;Survival&quot; was the last &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial of the original series to be transmitted, it was not the last to have been produced; that was &quot;Ghost Light&quot;, which had been broadcast some weeks earlier, as the second story of the original run. The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; production office at the BBC finally closed down in August 1990, having been in continuous operation since 1963.

This story is the last to feature Anthony Ainley as the Master. Ainley was not asked to return as the Master for the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie. Instead, Gordon Tipple was cast as the Master for the prologue and Eric Roberts played the Master for the rest of the movie. Ainley reprised the role of the Master for the 1997 computer game &quot;Destiny of the Doctors&quot;. He continued to be active in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, attending conventions and recording a commentary track for the DVD of the 1981 serial &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot;. Ainley died in May 2004.

McCoy and Aldred would reprise their roles onscreen on a number of occasions: first in a 1990 episode of the educational series &quot;Search Out Science&quot;; and again in 1993, along with many other former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actors, for the Children in Need 30th anniversary special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;. McCoy would briefly return to the role for the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie which saw the Seventh Doctor regenerate into the Eighth Doctor, played by Paul McGann, and once more in 2021 for a webcast trailer promoting the Blu-ray release of Season 24 alongside Bonnie Langford as Mel Bush.

If the series continued, Aldred would have remained in her role until the expiry of her contract midway through the following season. Ace was to be written out of the series in &quot;Ice Time&quot;, an Ice Warrior story written by Marc Platt. Aldred returned as Ace in 2019 for a webcast trailer promoting the Blu-ray release of Season 26.

In 1999, McCoy agreed to reprise his role as the Doctor in officially licensed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio adventures produced by Big Finish, with Aldred also returning the following year. As of 2022, both McCoy and Aldred continue to make regular appearances in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio releases and associated spin-offs. The pair also returned in 2001 for the BBC webcast production, &quot;Death Comes to Time&quot;.

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; eventually returned to television as a BBC Wales production in 2005, helmed by Russell T Davies. In 2022, Aldred made a special guest appearance as Ace in the revived series, alongside Janet Fielding as Tegan Jovanka, in The Power of the Doctor, which saw the end of Jodie Whittaker&#x27;s tenure as the Thirteenth Doctor and was the last story produced entirely by BBC Studios before entering a co-production deal with Bad Wolf. McCoy also made a surprise cameo as a manifestation of the Seventh Doctor.

===Cast notes===
The part of Karra in this serial is played by Lisa Bowerman, who is now more familiar to fans as the voice of Bernice Summerfield in the Big Finish Productions audio dramas. She is also a director of many Big Finish productions, and also returned to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series proper when she provided voice-acting work for the animated special &quot;Dreamland&quot; in 2009.

This serial features guest appearances of the comedians Gareth Hale and Norman Pace, and actress Adele Silva (as an 8-year-old, in her first television role). See also Celebrity appearances in Doctor Who.

==Broadcast and reception==
There was no direct indication given to the public that this was to be the final regular instalment of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;; however, unlike previous years&#x27; final episodes, this one featured no announcement in the closing credits that the programme would return the following year.

Reviewing &quot;Survival&quot;, David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker described it as &quot;a very good story&quot;, with a
script that contains &quot;highly imaginative and original concepts&quot;. They also expressed admiration for the special effects used for the Cheetah People&#x27;s planet, 
calling them &quot;superb electronic video effects&quot;. Ainley&#x27;s performance was also praised, with the reviewers
stating it was &quot;deadly serious and implacably evil, but with occasional flashes of dark humour&quot;. 
While stating that it was &quot;deeply regrettable&quot; that the original series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; had to end with &quot;Survival&quot;, they added &quot;that it went out on such a high note is, however, something to be thankful for&quot;.

The serial was also positively received by Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, who praised Anthony Ainley&#x27;s performance and considered the show to be &quot;a great end to the series&quot; with &quot;an epic quality&quot;.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===
A novelisation of this serial, written by Rona Munro, was published by Target Books in October 1990, making Munro the third woman to write a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novelisation. A reprint edition was one of several possible books included with a 2008 issue of Doctor Who Magazine.

===Home media===

&quot;Survival&quot; was released on VHS in October 1995. It was released on DVD on 16 April 2007 as a 2-disc set. The serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files collection, in issue 51, published 15 December 2010.

The story was released once more as part of the Doctor Who: The Collection Season 26 blu-ray box set released in 2020. It is the only story from season 26 not to have an alternate extended cut.

===Soundtrack release===

The music from this serial, composed by Dominic Glynn, was first released on CD on 15 September 2017.

<text>The concept of home improvement, home renovation or remodeling is the process of renovating, making improvements or making additions to one&#x27;s home. Home improvement can consist of projects that upgrade an existing home interior (such as electrical and plumbing), exterior (masonry, concrete, siding, roofing) or other improvements to the property (i.e. garden work or garage maintenance/additions). Home improvement projects can be carried out for a number of different reasons; personal preference and comfort, maintenance or repair work, making a home bigger by adding rooms/spaces, as a means of saving energy, or to improve safety.

==Types of home improvement==
While &quot;home improvement&quot; often refers to building projects that alter the structure of an existing home, it can also include improvements to lawns, gardens, and outdoor structures, such as gazebos and garages. It also encompasses maintenance, repair, and general servicing tasks. Home improvement projects generally have one or more of the following goals:

===Comfort===
*Upgrading heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC).
*Upgrading rooms with luxuries, such as adding gourmet features to a kitchen or a hot tub spa to a bathroom.
*Increasing the capacity of plumbing and electrical systems.
*Waterproofing basements.
*Soundproofing rooms, especially bedrooms and baths.

===Maintenance and repair===
Maintenance projects can include:
*Roof tear-off and replacement.
*Replacement or new construction windows.
*Concrete and masonry repairs to the foundation and chimney.
*Repainting rooms, walls or fences
*Repairing plumbing and electrical systems
*Wallpapering 
*Furniture polishing
*Plumbing, home interior and exterior works
*Shower maintenance

===Additional space===
Additional living space may be added by:
*Turning marginal areas into livable spaces such as turning basements into recrooms, home theaters, or home offices – or attics into spare bedrooms.
*Extending one&#x27;s house with rooms added to the side of one&#x27;s home or, sometimes, extra levels to the original roof. Such a new unit of construction is called an &quot;add-on&quot;.

===Saving energy===
Homeowners may reduce utility costs with:
*Energy-efficient thermal insulation, replacement windows, and lighting.
*Renewable energy with biomass pellet stoves, wood-burning stoves, solar panels, wind turbines, programmable thermostats, and geothermal exchange heat pumps (see autonomous building).

=== Safety, emergency management, security and privacy ===
The need to be safer or for better privacy or emergency management can be fulfilled with diversified measures which can be improved, maintained or added. Secret compartments and passages can also be conceived for privacy and security.

* Interventions for fire protection and avoidance. Possible examples are fire sprinkler systems for automatic fire suppression, smoke detectors for fire detection, fire alarm systems, or passive fire protection (including some wildfire management strategies).
* Technical solutions to increase protection from natural disasters, or geotechnical and structural safety (e.g. hurricane or seismic retrofit).
* Interventions and additions to increase home safety from other hazards, like falls, electric injuries, gas leaks or home exposure to environmental health concerns.
* Physical security measures:
** Access control systems and physical barriers, which can include fences, physical door and window security measures (e.g. grilles, laminated glass, window shutters), locks;
** Security lighting, security alarms and video surveillance.
* Safes and vaults.
* Spaces for emergency evacuation, like emergency exits and rarer escape tunnels.
* Spaces which provide protection in the event of different emergencies: areas of refuge, storm cellars (as protection from tornadoes and other kinds of severe weather), panic rooms, bunkers and bomb shelters (including fallout shelters), etc.
* Home renovations or additions used to increase privacy can be as simple as curtains or much more advanced, such as some structural surveillance counter-measures. They may overlap with physical security measures.
* Public utility outage preparedness, like backup generators for providing power during power outages .

==Home improvement industry==
Home or residential renovation is an almost $300 billion industry in the United States, and a $48 billion industry in Canada. The average cost per project is $3,000 in the United States and $11,000–15,000 in Canada.

Professional home improvement is ancient and goes back to the beginning of recorded civilization. One example is Sergius Orata, who in the 1st century B.C. is said by the writer Vitruvius (in his famous book De architectura) to have invented the hypocaust. The hypocaust is an underfloor heating system that was used throughout the Roman Empire in villas of the wealthy. He is said to have become wealthy himself by buying villas at a low price, adding spas and his newly invented hypocaust, and reselling them at higher prices.

===Renovation contractors===
Perhaps the most important or visible professionals in the renovation industry are renovation contractors or skilled trades. These are the builders that have specialized credentials, licensing and experience to perform renovation services in specific municipalities.

While there is a fairly large &quot;grey market&quot; of unlicensed companies, there are those that have membership in a reputable association and/or are accredited by a professional organization. Homeowners are recommended to perform checks such as verifying license and insurance and checking business references prior to hiring a contractor to work on their house.

Because interior renovation will touch the change of the internal structure of the house, ceiling construction, circuit configuration and partition walls, etc., such work related to the structure of the house, of course, also includes renovation of wallpaper posting, furniture settings, lighting, etc.

===Aggregators===
Aggregators are companies that bundle home improvement service offers and act as intermediary agency between service providers and customers.

==In popular culture==
Home improvement was popularized on television in 1979 with the premiere of &quot;This Old House&quot; starring Bob Vila on PBS. American cable channel HGTV features many do-it-yourself shows, as does sister channel DIY Network.
Danny Lipford hosts and produces the nationally syndicated &quot;Today&#x27;s Homeowner with Danny Lipford&quot;. Tom Kraeutler and Leslie Segrete co-host the nationally syndicated &quot;The Money Pit Home Improvement Radio Show&quot;.

Movies that poked fun at the difficulties involved include: &quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House&quot; (1948), starring Cary Grant and Myrna Loy; &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot; (1942), featuring Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan; and &quot;The Money Pit&quot; (1986), with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. The sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot; used the home improvement theme for comedic purposes.

<text>The chess game between Emanuel Lasker and Johann Bauer played in Amsterdam in 1889 is one of the most famous on account of Lasker&#x27;s sacrifice of both bishops to eliminate the pawn cover around his opponent&#x27;s king, winning material and the game.

The same sacrificial pattern was echoed in a number of later games, notably Nimzowitsch–Tarrasch, St Petersburg 1914; Miles–Browne, Lucerne 1982; and Polgar–Karpov, Seventh Essent 2003.

The game against Bauer was played at the beginning of Lasker&#x27;s career in the first round of the 1889 Amsterdam tournament, Lasker&#x27;s first high-level closed event. Lasker finished second with a 6/8 score, a point behind the winner Amos Burn, and ahead of James Mason and Isidor Gunsberg, among others. Bauer finished sixth of the nine participants with a score of 3½/8.

A similar sacrifice occurred earlier in Burn–Owen, 1884, but in this case the sacrifice by John Owen was not correct and he lost the game. Nevertheless, it may have been an inspiration for Lasker.

<text>Bird&#x27;s Opening (or the Dutch Attack) is a chess opening characterised by the move:
: 1. 

Named after 19th century English player Henry Bird, Bird&#x27;s opening is a standard flank opening. White&#x27;s strategic ideas involve control of the e5-square, offering good attacking chances at the expense of slightly weakening their own . Black may challenge White&#x27;s plan to control e5 immediately by playing From&#x27;s Gambit (1...e5); however, the From Gambit is notoriously double-edged and should only be played after significant study.

The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; assigns two codes for Bird&#x27;s Opening: A02 (1.f4) and A03 (1.f4 d5).
==History==
The opening was mentioned by Luis Ramírez de Lucena in his book &quot;Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez con Cien Juegos de Partido&quot;, published c. 1497. In the mid-nineteenth century the opening was sometimes played by La Bourdonnais and Elijah Williams, among others. The British master Henry Edward Bird first played it in 1855 and continued to do so for the next 40 years. After a six year break from Chess, he forgot how to play the more familiar openings. In 1885, the &quot;Hereford Times&quot; named it after him. In the first half of the 20th century Aron Nimzowitsch and Savielly Tartakower sometimes played 1.f4. In more recent decades, grandmasters who have used the Bird&#x27;s with any regularity include Bent Larsen, Andrew Soltis, Lars Karlsson, Mikhail Gurevich, and Henrik Danielsen.

==1...d5==

Black&#x27;s most common response is 1...d5, when the game can take on the character of a Dutch Defence (1.d4 f5) with colours reversed. White will then often either fianchetto their with Nf3, g3, Bg2, and 0–0 with a reversed Leningrad Dutch; adopt a Stonewall formation with pawns on d4, e3, and f4 and attempt a attack; or fianchetto their to increase their hold on the e5-square. Another strategy, by analogy with the Ilyin–Zhenevsky variation of the Dutch Defence, involves White playing Nf3, e3, Be2, 0-0, d3 and attempting to achieve the break e3–e4 by various means, e.g. Ne5, Bf3, Qe2 and finally e3–e4, or simply Nc3 followed by e4. Timothy Taylor&#x27;s book on Bird&#x27;s Opening suggests as a main line: 1.f4 d5 2.Nf3 g6 3.e3 Bg7 4.Be2 Nf6 5.0-0 0-0 6.d3 c5.

White can also play 2.c4, the Mujannah-Sturm gambit. This is a decent opening and seems to borrow ideas from the Réti Opening (1.Nf3 d5 2.c4) and the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted. Eventually, this move order is followed by Nf3. The best move in this position is 2...d4, where the game continues in the style of the Réti Opening, with 3.Nf3 being a possible next move. 2.c4 is not a true gambit, since if Black tries to hold on to their pawn, they will be punished (2.c4 dxc4 3.e3 b5 [Black should pursue development instead] 4.a4 c6? 5.axb5 cxb5 6.Qf3, where Black must part with a , akin to the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted trap).

==From&#x27;s Gambit: 1...e5 ==

Black&#x27;s reply is 1...e5, From&#x27;s Gambit, named for the Danish chess player Martin Severin From (1828–1895). White then has the option to transpose into the King&#x27;s Gambit with 2.e4. This is an important option which may cause Black to consider playing a different line if they wish to avoid the King&#x27;s Gambit. It has been observed that one of the possible disadvantages of From&#x27;s Gambit is that it is very easy for White to avoid.

If White accepts the gambit with 2.fxe5, Black must choose between the main line 2...d6 and the rather obscure 2...Nc6. After 2...Nc6, International Master (IM) Timothy Taylor, in his 2005 book on the Bird&#x27;s, recommends 3.Nc3 Nxe5 4.d4 intending 5.e4, rather than 3.Nf3 g5! when Black stands well. After the normal 2...d6 3.exd6 Bxd6, White must play 4.Nf3, avoiding 4.Nc3 Qh4+ 5.g3 Qxg3+ 6.hxg3 Bxg3 checkmate. Then Black again has two alternatives: 4...g5 to drive away White&#x27;s knight, and 4...Nf6, threatening 5...Ng4 and 6...Nxh2! Future world champion Emanuel Lasker introduced 4...g5 in the game Bird–Lasker, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1892, so it is known as &quot;Lasker&#x27;s Variation&quot;. Taylor considers 4...g5 dubious; a quiet response that he considers favourable for White is 5.d4 g4 6.Ne5! (6.Ng5 leads to a dubious piece sacrifice) Bxe5 7.dxe5 Qxd1+ 8.Kxd1 Nc6 9.Nc3! Be6 (9...Nxe5?! 10.Bf4 f6 11.Nd5 Kd8 12.Nxf6!) 10.Bf4 0-0-0+ 11.Ke1 Nge7 12.e3 Ng6 13.Bg5 Rdf8 14.Bf6 Rhg8 15.Be2 Ngxe5 16.Rf1 &quot;with the typical edge for White that is characteristic of this variation&quot;, according to Taylor. He also considers the sharper 5.g3 g4 6.Nh4 favourable for White, giving as the main line 6...Ne7 7.d4 Ng6 8.Nxg6 hxg6 9.Qd3 Nc6 (9...Rh5 10.Bg2; 9...Na6 10.c3) 10.c3 (10.Nc3? Nxd4! 11.Qxd4?? Bxg3+ wins White&#x27;s queen) Bf5 (10...Qe7 11.Bg2! Bd7 12.Nd2 0-0-0 13.Ne4! favoured White in Taylor–Becerra Rivero, Minneapolis 2005) 11.e4 Qe7 12.Bg2 0-0-0 13.Be3. According to Taylor, White has a large advantage in all lines, although play remains extremely sharp, e.g. 13...Rde8 14.Nd2; 13...Rxh2 14.Rxh2 Bxg3+ 15.Kd1 Bxh2 16.exf5! Re8 17.fxg6! Qxe3 18.Qxe3 Rxe3 19.gxf7; or 13...Bd7 (threatening 14...Rxh2!) 14.Bf2!

The worst response to From’s Gambit is 2.g4??, since black will respond with Qh4#, which is a Fool’s mate.

==Other Black responses==
* The flexible 1...Nf6 is also possible. Then if White plays 2.b3?! (2.Nf3 is safer), 2...d6! 3.Bb2?! (or 3.Nf3 e5! 4.fxe5 dxe5 5.Nxe5?? Qd4!) e5!, a sort of From&#x27;s Gambit Deferred introduced by IM Michael Brooks, is dangerous for White, e.g. 4.fxe5 dxe5 5.Bxe5 Ng4! Then 6.Bb2 Bd6 &quot;leaves White in huge trouble down the e1–h4 diagonal&quot;, and Black wins an after 7.Nf3 Bxh2! 8.Rxh2 Nxh2. After the alternative 6.Bg3, 6...Qf6! (even better than 6...Bd6) 7.c3 (not 7.Nc3? Ne3! 8.dxe3 Bb4) Bd6 is strong for Black.
* Another popular response is 1...g6, a sort of Modern Defense, which may transpose into a reversed Dutch Defense (if Black plays ...d5 and ...c5), or a Sicilian Defence (if White plays e4 and Black plays ...c5). Black thus prevents White from playing on the a1–h8 diagonal.
* Also reasonable is 1...c5, hoping for a transposition into the Tal Gambit, a favourable variation of the Sicilian Defence, after 2.e4 d5! 3.exd5 (3.Nc3, the mellifluously named &quot;Toilet Variation,&quot; is also possible) 3...Nf6, but White need not oblige, and may build up more slowly with 2.Nf3, followed by g3, Bg2, d3, and possibly a later e4.
* The offbeat 1...b6!? is also known, and more soundly based than the same move after 1.e4 or 1.d4, since 1.f4 does not aid White&#x27;s , and weakens the a8–h1 diagonal as the move f3 is no longer available to shore up White&#x27;s . Taylor recommends 2.e4 Bb7 3.d3 e6 4.Nf3 Ne7 5.c3 d5 6.Qc2 Nd7 7.Be3, with a spatial advantage for White.
* Also possible is 1...b5!?, a form of the Polish Defense. After the natural 2.e4 Bb7, White has no good way to protect e4 while maintaining their attack on b5, since 3.Nc3? b4 4.Nd5 e6 wins a pawn.
* If Black chooses the symmetrical reply 1...f5, Taylor considers White&#x27;s best line to be quiet play with 2.b3 b6 3.Bb2 Bb7 4.e3, when 4...Nf6 5.Bxf6! exf6 6.Nf3 left White with the better pawn structure in Larsen–Colon Romero, San Juan 1969. Instead, 4...e6 5.Qh5+ forces the weakening 5...g6, with a slight advantage to White according to Taylor. Also possible is the aggressive 2.e4!?, when Taylor analyses 2...fxe4 3.d3 exd3 4.Bxd3 Nf6 5.Nf3 (5.g4 is well met by 5...d5, when after 6.g5, 6...Bg4 and 6...Ne4 both favour Black) 5...d5 6.0-0, when he considers White to have some, but not enough, compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Another possible continuation is 2...fxe4 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.g4, the Swiss Gambit. This gambit was named by Alexander Wagner (1868–1942), a Polish chess player and openings analyst who introduced it in the Swiss correspondence game Wagner–Kostin, 1910–11. The term &quot;Swiss Gambit&quot; is often used to refer more generally to 1.f4 f5 2.e4. Chess historian Edward Winter has criticized that usage, pointing out that 1.f4 f5 2.e4 was analysed by F.A. Lange in the June 1859 &quot;Deutsche Schachzeitung&quot;, and was played by many players, including Adolf Anderssen, in the nineteenth century.
* An aggressive but rare response is 1...g5?!, the Hobbs Gambit, with play possibly continuing 2.fxg5 h6, a sort of mirror image Benko Gambit. White can simply return the pawn with 3.g6, leaving Black with a weakened after 3...fxg6. A variant is the Hobbs–Zilbermints Gambit, 1...h6 intending 2...g5; against this, White could proceed with 2.e4 g5 3.d4, when Black has lost time and weakened their kingside.
* Another offbeat try is Martin Appleberry&#x27;s 1...Nh6!?, also known as the Horsefly, which exploits the closed c1-h6 diagonal. One idea is to meet 2.b3 with 2...e5, another deferred From Gambit, and 2.e4 with 2...d5, when 3.exd5 Qxd5 would result in a Scandinavian Defense where White&#x27;s pawn is oddly placed on f4. However, 2.Nf3 avoids both of these lines. The primary objective of the Horsefly is to retain control of e5, preventing the Stonewall attack, but otherwise giving White great flexibility.
* Another possible reply by Black is 1...Nc6. With this move, Black lays the support for the advance of the e-pawn. The general sequence of moves that Black may opt for is ...g6, ...Bg7 and ...d6 and eventually advance the e-pawn.
* Another possible reply is 1...e6. This exploits the weakness created by 1.f4 on the e1–h4 diagonal by releasing the queen, and also releases the without offering a pawn, unlike the From Gambit. White should avoid playing 2.g4?? as it leads to 2...Qh4# (a variation of the Fool&#x27;s Mate). 2.e4 transposes to the La Bourdonnais Variation of the French Defense (the normal order being 1.e4 e6 2.f4).

==Popularity==
Out of the twenty possible opening moves, 1.f4 ranks sixth in popularity in Chessgames.com&#x27;s database, behind 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, 1.c4, and 1.g3. It is less than one-twentieth as popular as the mirror image English Opening (1.c4). The move 1.f4 slightly weakens White&#x27;s king&#x27;s position. Chessgames.com&#x27;s statistics indicate that the opening is not an effective way of preserving White&#x27;s first-move advantage: as of February 2013, out of 3,872 games with 1.f4, White had won 30.7%, drawn 32%, and lost 37.7%, for a total score of 46.7%. White scores much better with the more popular 1.e4 (54.25%), 1.d4 (55.95%), 1.Nf3 (55.8%), 1.c4 (56.3%), and 1.g3 (55.8%), as well as with the less popular 1.b3 (52.5%).

According to the similar site 365chess.com, which includes data for lower-level games, as of August 2015, out of 20,010 games with 1.f4, White had won 35.1%, drawn 25%, and lost 39.9%, for a total score of 47.6%. The five more popular openings are still substantially more successful for White: 1.e4 (53.15%), 1.d4 (54.8%), 1.Nf3 (55.4%), 1.c4 (54.65%), and 1.g3 (54.9%).

At lichess.org, in the 1600-2200 rating range in Rapid, Classical, and Correspondence time controls White wins 50% of the time while losing 45% of the time in the 2,600,000 games in their database. In those games the most common responses to 1.f4 are d5 (41%), e6 (11%), c5 (9%), e5 (7%) and Nf6 (7%). Black&#x27;s most successful response to Bird&#x27;s Opening in that rating range is e5, where Black&#x27;s win percentage is 50-46%, but that evens to 48-48% when White plays 2.fxe5.

<doc id="900110" wikidata="Q1236228" url="?curid=900110" title="Anabasis of Alexander">
<text>The Anabasis of Alexander (, &quot;Alexándrou Anábasis&quot;; ) was composed by Arrian of Nicomedia in the second century AD, most probably during the reign of Hadrian. The &quot;Anabasis&quot; (which survives complete in seven books) is a history of the campaigns of Alexander the Great, specifically his conquest of the Persian Empire between 336 and 323 BC. Both the unusual title &quot;Anabasis&quot; (literally &quot;a journey up-country from the sea&quot;) and the work&#x27;s seven-book structure reflect Arrian&#x27;s emulation (in structure, style, and content) of the Greek historian Xenophon, whose own &quot;Anabasis&quot; in seven books concerned the earlier campaign &quot;up-country&quot; of Cyrus the Younger in 401 BC.

The &quot;Anabasis&quot; is by far the fullest surviving account of Alexander&#x27;s conquest of the Persian empire. It is primarily a military history, reflecting the content of Arrian&#x27;s model, Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot;; the work begins with Alexander&#x27;s accession to the Macedonian throne in 336 BC, and has nothing to say about Alexander&#x27;s early life (in contrast, say, to Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Alexander&quot;). Nor does Arrian aim to provide a complete history of the Greek-speaking world during Alexander&#x27;s reign. Arrian&#x27;s chief sources in writing the &quot;Anabasis&quot; were the lost contemporary histories of the campaign by Ptolemy and Aristobulus and, for his later books, Nearchus. One of Arrian&#x27;s main aims in writing his history seems to have been to correct the standard &quot;Vulgate&quot; narrative of Alexander&#x27;s reign that was current in his own day, primarily associated with the lost writings of the historian Cleitarchus.

==Content==

The &quot;Anabasis&quot; gives a broadly chronological account of the reign of Alexander the Great of Macedon (336–323 BC), with a particular focus on military matters. After a short Preface concerning Arrian&#x27;s sources, the seven books describe the reign of Alexander the Great. 

Book 1

This book covers the early years of Alexander&#x27;s reign (336–334 BC), including notable descriptions of Alexander&#x27;s sack of Thebes in 335 and the battle of the Granicus in summer 334 BC. 

Book 2

The majority of this book is dominated by three large set-piece military operations: the campaign and battle of Issus (333 BC) and the sieges of Tyre and Gaza (332 BC). This book also recounts the defeat of King Darius of Persia and how Alexander treated Darius&#x27;s family after his death. The trial of the Gordian Knot is also included in this book. 
Book 3

Book three begins with an account of Alexander in Egypt, including his visit to the oracle of Zeus-Ammon at Siwah (winter 332/331 BC), before turning to the battle of Gaugamela and defeat of Darius III (331 BC). The latter half of the book describes Alexander&#x27;s pursuit of Darius through northern Iran, the revolt of the pretender Bessus, and the deaths of Philotas and Parmenion (331–329 BC). 

Book 4

This book begins with describing the long Sogdian campaign of 329–327 BC against Bessus, Spitamenes, and Oxyartes, and the early stages of the campaigns in the Punjab (327–326 BC), with a notable departure from chronological sequence at 4.7–14, where Arrian collects many of the most notorious stories tending to Alexander&#x27;s discredit in a single apologetic digression (the killing of Cleitus, the proskynesis affair, the pages&#x27; conspiracy and the death of Callisthenes). 

Book 5

This book continues the narrative of the Indian campaign of Alexander the Great of 326 BC, including Alexander&#x27;s arrival at Nysa, the battle with Porus at the Hydaspes river, and the decision at the Hyphasis not to push on further into India. 

Book 6

The journey down the Indus to the Indian Ocean (326–325 BC) is described, including the increasingly brutal violence inflicted on the local inhabitants by the Macedonians &quot;en route&quot; (notably at the Malli town), and the crossing of the Gedrosian Desert (325–324 BC). 

Book 7

The last of the books recounts the events of Alexander&#x27;s final year, including the Susa marriages, the Opis mutiny, the multiple predictions and omens of Alexander&#x27;s own death, the death of Hephaestion, and Alexander&#x27;s own death (324–323 BC). The very end of this book concludes with speculation about how Alexander died, and whether it was by poisoning or something else.

== Criticism ==
Arrian&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot; has traditionally been regarded as the most reliable extant narrative source for Alexander&#x27;s campaigns. Since the 1970s, however, a more critical view of Arrian has become widespread, due largely to the work of A. B. Bosworth, who has drawn scholars&#x27; attention to Arrian&#x27;s tendency to hagiography and apologia, not to mention several passages where Arrian can be shown (by comparison with other ancient sources) to be downright misleading.

==Modern editions==

The only complete English translation of Arrian available online is a rather antiquated translation by E.J. Chinnock, published in 1884. The original Greek text used by the Perseus Digital Library is the standard A.G. Roos Teubner edition published at Leipzig in 1907. 

Probably the most widely used scholarly English translation is Loeb Classical Library edition (with facing Greek text), in two volumes. The work first appeared in 1929 and was later revised with a new introduction and appendices by P.A. Brunt in 1976. 

An English translation by Aubrey de Sélincourt appeared in Penguin Classics in 1958. This edition was revised and annotated by J.R. Hamilton in 1971.

The &quot;Landmark Ancient Histories,&quot; edited by Robert B. Strassler, includes &quot;The Landmark Arrian: The Campaigns of Alexander,&quot; edited by James Romm (Professor of Classics at Bard College, 2010), and translated by Pamela Mensch. The Landmark edition includes extensive margin notes and maps on every other page.

A new translation by Martin Hammond with introduction and notes by John Atkinson appeared in the &quot;Oxford World&#x27;s Classics&quot; series in 2013.

<text>John Shelton Wilder (June 3, 1921 – January 1, 2010) was an American politician who was the 48th Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee for 36 years from January 1971 to January 2007, possibly the longest time anyone has served as Lieutenant Governor or a similar position in the history of the United States. He was a Tennessee state senator from 1959 to 1961 and again from 1967 to 2009. Tennesseans do not elect their lieutenant governor; rather, the Speaker of the Senate, who is first in the line of succession to the governor, is granted the title by statute.

==Early life and education==
Wilder was from Fayette County, near Memphis. He was from an affluent family with extensive agricultural and agribusiness interests. He attended Fayette County Public Schools and received an undergraduate degree from the University of Tennessee College of Agriculture and a law degree from Memphis State University, now the University of Memphis.

He and his family were known for fairer dealings with African American farm employees and tenants than was typical of the area during the segregation era. This fact served him very well upon entering into elective politics at about the time that Tennessee blacks in rural areas were first being allowed their constitutional rights to participate in political decisions which had been guaranteed under the Tennessee and federal constitutions but previously unenforced. Wilder was also a prominent attorney in Somerville, the county seat of Fayette County.

Wilder married his wife Marcelle in 1941 and served in the U.S. Army during World War II.

==Political career==
He was a member of the former Fayette County Quarterly Court (now the County Commission) for 18 years. A Democrat, he was first elected to the Tennessee Senate in 1958, serving until January 1961.

Wilder did not run for reelection in 1960, but returned to the state Senate in 1967. After this time, a state constitutional amendment extended the length of terms in the state Senate to four years. Wilder was elected to a four-year term in 1968 and was reelected every four years thereafter until 2008. He represented Senate District 26, which currently included Chester, Crockett, Fayette, Hardeman, Hardin, Haywood, McNairy, and Wayne counties.

==Lieutenant governor==
Wilder was elected Speaker of the State Senate by his fellow senators in January 1971, which made him the state&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor. Under the Tennessee state constitution, the Speaker of the Senate is first in line of succession to the governorship. The title of Lieutenant Governor was granted to the Speaker of the Senate by statute in 1951.

He was the first Tennessee Lieutenant Governor in almost half a century, and only the second since Reconstruction, to serve under a governor of a different political party, Republican Winfield Dunn, who had been elected the previous November.

Prior to this time, the General Assembly had never had its own independent staff, or even its own offices, frequently working out of hotel rooms. Wilder now oversaw a massive building project (which somewhat ironically entailed the demolition of one of the hotels that many legislators had previously favored) which was undertaken to correct this and make the legislative branch of state government more co-equal to the other two.

Wilder defied precedent by seeking to serve as lieutenant governor for an extended period. Previously, no one had served more than three consecutive terms as Speaker of the Senate since Tennessee&#x27;s current constitution was adopted in 1870. He faced little opposition until the mid-1980s. By then, many of the members of the Senate Democratic Caucus had tired of his leadership. There were also regional issues at stake – by this time the speakers of both houses of the legislature had been from West Tennessee for almost two decades.
The dissident faction coalesced around the leadership of State Senate Majority Leader Riley Darnell from Clarksville in Middle Tennessee. When Darnell received the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor in 1987, Wilder&#x27;s long tenure as Lieutenant Governor appeared to be over.

However, in a surprise (but not entirely unprecedented) move, Wilder was then nominated by the &quot;Republican&quot; Caucus for Lieutenant Governor. With the support of all 15 Republicans in the chamber, and six dissenting Democrats, Wilder won the vote 21 – 15 and then proceeded to organize the Senate on a &quot;bipartisan&quot; basis, awarding a majority of the committee chairmanships to his Democratic loyalists with the remainder going to the Republicans. This was not out of character for Wilder; in 1979 he had acquiesced in the ouster of Governor Ray Blanton three days before his term was supposed to end after a series of controversial pardons. The state constitution is somewhat ambiguous on when a governor is supposed to be sworn in, so Wilder and his counterpart in the State House, Ned McWherter, supported the early swearing-in of his Republican successor, Lamar Alexander. Wilder called the move &quot;impeachment, Tennessee style.&quot;

After this, Wilder, until 2005, continued to be reelected &quot;unanimously&quot; and to award chairmanships to his supporters in both parties, making the Tennessee Senate one of the few legislative bodies in the world to be elected on a partisan basis, but organized on a more-or-less nonpartisan one. Even when two outgoing state Senators switched parties in the mid-1990s, giving the Republicans a short-lived one-seat Senate majority, nothing of consequence changed.

This coalition had made Wilder one of the longest-serving (reputedly &quot;the&quot; longest) freely-elected legislative leaders in the world. Given his support among many Republican state senators, he long faced little opposition in holding onto his State Senate seat, even though the Memphis suburbs were becoming increasingly Republican. In much of his district, he was the only elected Democrat above the county level by the turn of the millennium.

Unlike many lieutenant governors, particularly in other states, Wilder never ran for governor. In 2009 he said that he had wanted to run for governor in 1974, but had been talked out of it by his family, and was &quot;glad I stayed where I was because the Senate is the Senate.&quot;

Wilder was a cycling enthusiast and was a licensed private pilot for over a half-century, continuing occasionally until the end of his legislative career to fly himself 200 miles (320 km) from Fayette County to Nashville for legislative meetings.

Two Republican members of the Tennessee State Senate – enough to assure Wilder&#x27;s reelection provided his traditional unanimous Democratic support in recent years – voted for Wilder on January 11, 2005, and he was sworn in for his 18th term as lieutenant governor. (One of them, Micheal Williams, was then rewarded with the post of Speaker pro Tempore.) Wilder then appointed Republican majorities to seven of the nine committees but left the five existing Democratic chairmen in place; this resulted in Democratic majorities and chairs on two committees, including what is regarded as the most important one, the Finance Committee, which left many Republicans very upset.

Following the November 2006 elections, the Republican Party retained a one-seat majority in the Tennessee Senate. However, Republicans who had supported Wilder in the past, particularly Williams, found themselves under severe pressure to adhere to party discipline, with even the threat of officially-endorsed primary opponents, unprecedented for Tennessee Republicans, for those who failed to comply with the party line, according to a series of columns by &quot;Tennessean&quot; columnist Larry Daughtrey. Wilder was challenged within the Democratic caucus for nomination as speaker by State Senator Joe Haynes of Nashville. Later articles in &quot;The Tennessean&quot; and the &quot;Nashville City Paper&quot; cited the possibility that all 16 Republicans might vote for Senator Ron Ramsey of Blountville and that 16 Democrats, including Wilder himself, would vote for Wilder, with Democratic State Senator Jerry Cooper, accused of wrongful business dealings with a bank controlled by Wilder, abstaining to prevent any appearance of conflict of interest. Under Senate rules, a 16–16 tie would result in Wilder&#x27;s retention of the speakership.

However, in the vote held on January 9, 2007, all 17 Republicans voted for Ramsey and were joined by Democratic Senator Rosalind Kurita of Clarksville, ending Wilder&#x27;s tenure as Speaker of the Senate and Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee.

On March 8, 2007, the Tennessee news media reported that Wilder had been seriously injured in a fall and was in intensive care in a hospital in Memphis. He was released from the hospital on March 11, 2007, and returned home to finish his recuperation.

In February 2008, the 2007-08 edition of the &quot;Tennessee Blue Book&quot; was dedicated to him.

On March 20, 2008, Wilder announced his decision not to run for re-election later that year.

==Death==
Wilder died early on the morning of January 1, 2010 at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis following a stroke on December 28, 2009. He was survived by his younger brother Wiggins Wilder; his two sons: Shelton (John Jr.) and David; his four grandchildren: John III, Joseph, Jarod, and Whitney; and his five great-grandchildren: Jess (John IV), Suzie, Russell, Ansel and Marcel.

<text>OTP Bank Group is the largest commercial bank of Hungary and one of the largest independent financial service providers in Central and Eastern Europe, with banking services for private individuals and corporate clients. The OTP Group comprises subsidiaries in the field of insurance, real estate, factoring, leasing and asset management, investment and pension funds. Besides Hungary, OTP Group operates in 11 countries of the region via its subsidiaries: in Albania (Banka OTP Albania SHA), in Bulgaria (DSK Bank), in Croatia (OTP banka d.d.), in Romania (OTP Bank Romania), in Serbia (OTP Banka Srbija), in Slovenia (Nova KBM d.d. and SKB d.d., OTP banka d.d. after merger in 2024), in Ukraine (OTP Bank JSC), in Moldova (OTP Bank S.A.), in Montenegro (Crnogorska komercijalna banka), in Russia (OAO OTP Bank), and in Uzbekistan (JSCMB Ipoteka Bank).

 OTP Group had more than 36,000 employees, 13 million clients, and over 1,500 branches. OTP is the largest commercial bank in Hungary with over 25% market share.

OTP stands for Országos Takarék Pénztár (), which indicates the original purpose of establishment of the bank. OTP went public in 1995 and has a high free float shareholder structure, with a free float ratio of 68.61%. The rest are held by Megdet Rahimkulov at 8.88%, Hungarian MOL Group at 8.57%, French Groupama at 8.3% and American Lazard at 5.64%.

==History==

The oldest antecedent of OTP Bank was the First National Savings Bank of Pest, established in 1839–1840 and nationalized in 1948. In 1949, the latter&#x27;s operations were transferred to the newly established Hungarian National Savings Bank Company (), one of the country&#x27;s four main financial institutions alongside the Hungarian National Bank, the Hungarian Investment Bank (renamed the State Bank for Development in 1972 and liquidated in 1987), and the Hungarian Foreign Trade Bank. Until 1987 the National Savings Bank was the only retail bank in Hungary. Since 1989 the bank operated as a multi-functional commercial bank with the authorization to provide commercial loans and banking services for banks and import- export transactions.

In 1990, the National Savings Bank became a state-owned joint-stock company with a share capital of HUF 23 billion. Its name was changed to the National Savings and Commercial Bank. Subsequently, non-banking activities were separated from the bank, along with their supporting organisational units. The state lottery was reorganized into a separate state-owned company and OTP Real Estate was established as a subsidiary of the bank.
OTP Bank&#x27;s privatization began in the year 1995. As a result of 3 public offers along with the introduction of the bank&#x27;s shares into the Budapest Stock Exchange the state&#x27;s ownership in the bank decreased to 25 percent by 1995, then to a single voting preference (golden) share by 1999 (maintained until 2007).

In 1995, OTP purchased Merkantil Bank, created in 1988 mostly as a vehicle finance provider, from its parent K&amp;H Bank. OTP then started an international expansion targeting countries in Central and Eastern Europe, namely in Slovakia (2002), Bulgaria (2003), Romania (2004), Croatia (2005), Ukraine, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro (2006). 

In 2008, Paris-based Groupama acquired OTP&#x27;s insurance business. As part of the transaction, they resolved to collaborate in strategic points and cross sell their financial and insurance products. Groupama S.A. thus acquired 8% of shares of OTP Group. This transaction allowed OTP to avoid the need of state recapitalization during the financial crisis of 2008-2009; OTP only took liquidity support from the state, entailing temporary government interference in its governance, and was able to repay it fully by 2010.

In April 2014, it was announced that OTP Bank was close to a deal to acquire the Hungarian MKB Bank from German firm BayernLB, which however was not executed. French Axa Bank Europe announced in February 2016 it has entered into an agreement with OTP Bank to sell its Hungarian banking operations, which is considered as medium-sized bank in Hungary.

In 2019, OTP Bank entered into an agreement to purchase MobiasBanca of Moldova. The agreement was finalized on 25 July 2019.

In March 2022, due to international sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War, OTP Bank stopped financing its Russian branch.

On December 12, 2022, in Tashkent, OTP Bank signed an agreement on the privatization of 75% of the Joint-Stock Commercial Mortgage Bank &quot;Mortgage bank&quot;. It is planned to close the deal in the first half of 2023, although the amount has not yet been disclosed. 73.41% of the shares in Ipoteka Bank JSCM were acquired from the Uzbekistan government in June 2023.

=== Controversy ===
On 5 May 2023, Ukrainian authorities added OTP bank onto its list of &quot;international sponsors&quot; of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which the bank refutes. The Government of Hungary backed the bank stating that it would block any further EU aid to Ukraine until the bank is withdrawn from the list. The bank was removed from the list in September 2023.

== OTP Group ==
The Bank hosts an international organisation called the OTP group. The several parts of the group work in different areas of business.

<text>Begriffsschrift (German for, roughly, &quot;concept-writing&quot;) is a book on logic by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879, and the formal system set out in that book.

&quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; is usually translated as &quot;concept writing&quot; or &quot;concept notation&quot;; the full title of the book identifies it as &quot;a formula language, modeled on that of arithmetic, for pure thought.&quot; Frege&#x27;s motivation for developing his formal approach to logic resembled Leibniz&#x27;s motivation for his &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot; (despite that, in the foreword Frege clearly denies that he achieved this aim, and also that his main aim would be constructing an ideal language like Leibniz&#x27;s, which Frege declares to be a quite hard and idealistic—though not impossible—task). Frege went on to employ his logical calculus in his research on the foundations of mathematics, carried out over the next quarter-century. This is the first work in Analytical Philosophy, a field that later British and Anglo philosophers such as Bertrand Russell further developed.

== Notation and the system ==
The calculus contains the first appearance of quantified variables, and is essentially classical bivalent second-order logic with identity. It is bivalent in that sentences or formulas denote either True or False; second order because it includes relation variables in addition to object variables and allows quantification over both. The modifier &quot;with identity&quot; specifies that the language includes the identity relation, =. Frege stated that his book was his version of a characteristica universalis, a Leibnizian concept that would be applied in mathematics.

Frege presents his calculus using idiosyncratic two-dimensional notation: connectives and quantifiers are written using lines connecting formulas, rather than the symbols ¬, ∧, and ∀ in use today. For example, that judgement &quot;B&quot; materially implies judgement &quot;A&quot;, i.e. formula_1 is written as .

In the first chapter, Frege defines basic ideas and notation, like proposition (&quot;judgement&quot;), the universal quantifier (&quot;the generality&quot;), the conditional, negation and the &quot;sign for identity of content&quot; formula_2 (which he used to indicate both material equivalence and identity proper); in the second chapter he declares nine formalized propositions as axioms.

In chapter 1, §5, Frege defines the conditional as follows:

:&quot;Let A and B refer to judgeable contents, then the four possibilities are:
# A is asserted, B is asserted;
# A is asserted, B is negated;
# A is negated, B is asserted;
#A is negated, B is negated.

Let
signify that the third of those possibilities does not obtain, but one of the three others does. So if we negate , 
that means the third possibility is valid, i.e. we negate A and assert B.&quot;

== The calculus in Frege&#x27;s work ==
Frege declared nine of his propositions to be axioms, and justified them by arguing informally that, given their intended meanings, they express self-evident truths. Re-expressed in contemporary notation, these axioms are:

# formula_3
# formula_4
# formula_5
# formula_6
# formula_7
# formula_8
# formula_9
# formula_10
# formula_11

These are propositions 1, 2, 8, 28, 31, 41, 52, 54, and 58 in the &quot;Begriffschrifft&quot;. (1)–(3) govern material implication, (4)–(6) negation, (7) and (8) identity, and (9) the universal quantifier. (7) expresses Leibniz&#x27;s indiscernibility of identicals, and (8) asserts that identity is a reflexive relation.

All other propositions are deduced from (1)–(9) by invoking any of the following inference rules:
*Modus ponens allows us to infer formula_12 from formula_13 and formula_14;
*The rule of generalization allows us to infer formula_15 from formula_16 if &quot;x&quot; does not occur in &quot;P&quot;;
*The rule of substitution, which Frege does not state explicitly. This rule is much harder to articulate precisely than the two preceding rules, and Frege invokes it in ways that are not obviously legitimate.

The main results of the third chapter, titled &quot;Parts from a general series theory,&quot; concern what is now called the ancestral of a relation &quot;R&quot;. &quot;&quot;a&quot; is an &quot;R&quot;-ancestor of &quot;b&quot; is written &quot;aR&quot;*&quot;b&quot;.

Frege applied the results from the &quot;Begriffsschrifft&quot;, including those on the ancestral of a relation, in his later work &quot;The Foundations of Arithmetic&quot;. Thus, if we take &quot;xRy&quot; to be the relation &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + 1, then 0&quot;R&quot;*&quot;y&quot; is the predicate &quot;y&quot; is a natural number.&quot; (133) says that if &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; are natural numbers, then one of the following must hold: &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;, or &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;x&quot;. This is the so-called &quot;law of trichotomy&quot;.

== Influence on other works ==
For a careful recent study of how the &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; was reviewed in the German mathematical literature, see Vilko (1998). Some reviewers, especially Ernst Schröder, were on the whole favorable. All work in formal logic subsequent to the &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; is indebted to it, because its second-order logic was the first formal logic capable of representing a fair bit of mathematics and natural language.

Some vestige of Frege&#x27;s notation survives in the &quot;turnstile&quot; symbol formula_17 derived from his &quot;Urteilsstrich&quot; (&quot;judging/inferring stroke&quot;) │ and &quot;Inhaltsstrich&quot; (i.e. &quot;content stroke&quot;) ──. Frege used these symbols in the &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; in the unified form ├─ for declaring that a proposition is true. In his later &quot;Grundgesetze&quot; he revises slightly his interpretation of the ├─ symbol.

In &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; the &quot;Definitionsdoppelstrich&quot; (i.e. &quot;definition double stroke&quot;) │├─ indicates that a proposition is a definition. Furthermore, the negation sign formula_18 can be read as a combination of the horizontal &quot;Inhaltsstrich&quot; with a vertical negation stroke. This negation symbol was reintroduced by Arend Heyting in 1930 to distinguish intuitionistic from classical negation. It also appears in Gerhard Gentzen&#x27;s doctoral dissertation.

In the &quot;Tractatus Logico Philosophicus&quot;, Ludwig Wittgenstein pays homage to Frege by employing the term &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; as a synonym for logical formalism.

Frege&#x27;s 1892 essay, &quot;On Sense and Reference,&quot; recants some of the conclusions of the &quot;Begriffsschrifft&quot; about identity (denoted in mathematics by the &quot;=&quot; sign). In particular, he rejects the &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; view that the identity predicate expresses a relationship between names, in favor of the conclusion that it expresses a relationship between the objects that are denoted by those names.

<doc id="900130" wikidata="Q4764765" url="?curid=900130" title="Animal Bag">
<text>Animal Bag was an alternative metal grunge band from Charlotte, North Carolina, United States, which was active from 1987 through 1998.

==Career==
After some personnel changes, the band formed around members Luke Edwards (vocals and guitar), Rich Parris (guitars, mandolin, and vocals), Otis Hughes (bass guitar), and Boo Duckworth (drums and percussion) in 1987. After building a following in their native North Carolina, the group relocated to Los Angeles in 1989.

Favorable press in newspapers, including the &quot;L.A. Music Scene&quot;, which compared them to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More, helped raise the band&#x27;s profile. Coupled with the exploding alternative music scene, the exposure attracted the attention of several A&amp;R execs. Eventually, Animal Bag signed with Mercury Records in 1992.

Their 1992 self-titled initial release blended acoustic and electric rock. That same year, Animal Bag was prominently featured in the pilot episode of &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; as the party band. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Everybody&quot;, peaked briefly at No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; &quot;Mainstream Rock&quot; chart in 1993. Additionally, it was a minor success in Japan, hitting No. 32 for 8 weeks in March 1993. Their follow-up 1994 album, &quot;Offering,&quot; was all-acoustic and did not chart well in the U.S. Mercury was willing to give the band one more chance, bringing in producer Terry Date to oversee a return to harder-edged music for the 1996 album &quot;Image Damage&quot;. The album was never released because of inner shakeups at the record label; most of the people who had worked the first two Animal Bag releases left the label.

<doc id="900131" wikidata="Q15924432" url="?curid=900131" title="Crout matrix decomposition">
<text>In linear algebra, the Crout matrix decomposition is an LU decomposition which decomposes a matrix into a lower triangular matrix (L), an upper triangular matrix (U) and, although not always needed, a permutation matrix (P). It was developed by Prescott Durand Crout. 

The Crout matrix decomposition algorithm differs slightly from the Doolittle method. Doolittle&#x27;s method returns a unit lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix, while the Crout method returns a lower triangular matrix and a unit upper triangular matrix.

So, if a matrix decomposition of a matrix A is such that:

:A = LDU

being L a unit lower triangular matrix, D a diagonal matrix and U a unit upper triangular matrix, then Doolittle&#x27;s method produces

:A = L(DU)

and Crout&#x27;s method produces

:A = (LD)U.

== Implementations ==
C implementation:
void crout(double const **A, double **L, double **U, int n) {
 int i, j, k;
 double sum = 0;

 for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
 U[i][i] = 1;

 for (j = 0; j &lt; n; j++) {

<text>Corrosion of Conformity (also known as C.O.C.) is an American heavy metal band from Raleigh, North Carolina, formed in 1982. The band has undergone multiple lineup changes throughout its existence, with lead guitarist Woody Weatherman as the sole constant member. Weatherman, founding bassist Mike Dean, founding drummer Reed Mullin and vocalist/rhythm guitarist Pepper Keenan (who joined the band in 1989) are widely regarded as its &quot;classic&quot; lineup. After a hiatus in 2006, Corrosion of Conformity returned in 2010 without Keenan, who had been busy touring and recording with Down, but announced their reunion with him in December 2014. More lineup changes have happened since then, with John Green replacing Mullin after his death in 2020 and Dean (who first left Corrosion of Conformity in 1987 and rejoined in 1993) departing from the band once again in 2024.

They started as a hardcore punk band but later moved towards a slower and blues-tinged heavy metal sound. To date, the band has released ten studio albums, four EPs, one compilation, and one live album. Their first three studio albums―&quot;Eye for an Eye&quot; (1984), &quot;Animosity&quot; (1985) and &quot;Blind&quot; (1991)―attracted the attention of Columbia Records, who signed the band in 1993. Corrosion of Conformity found success with the release of their 1994 fourth studio album, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, which peaked at number 155 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned the hits &quot;Albatross&quot; and &quot;Clean My Wounds&quot;. Their 1996 follow-up &quot;Wiseblood&quot; was also successful, and at the time, it was the band&#x27;s highest-charting album in the United States, peaking at number 104 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Their latest album, &quot;No Cross No Crown&quot;, was released in 2018 and became the band&#x27;s first album to enter the top 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it peaked at number 67.

==History==
===Early years, &quot;Eye for an Eye&quot; and &quot;Animosity&quot; (1982–1988)===

Corrosion of Conformity was formed in Raleigh, North Carolina, by bassist and vocalist Mike Dean, guitarist Woody Weatherman, drummer Reed Mullin, and singer Benji Shelton in 1982. They were influenced by heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Scorpions, and Judas Priest, as well as by hardcore groups like Black Flag, Bad Brains, the Circle Jerks, Minor Threat, Discharge, the Germs, and &quot;a lot of older D.C. bands.&quot;

They released tracks on the &quot;No Core&quot; cassette tape compilation on the label of the same name along with other North Carolina punk bands in 1982 as well as on the &quot;Why are we here?&quot; 7&quot; compilation in 1983, also on the No Core label. Shelton quit the band in 1983 and COC first recruited Robert Stewart to sing but he stayed only for about a month, so they recruited Eric Eycke from fellow Raleigh band Colcor to be the new singer. They recorded their first album, &quot;Eye for an Eye&quot;, with Eycke.

Their hardcore punk-oriented 20-track debut &quot;Eye for an Eye&quot;—the only album featuring Eycke—was initially released in 1984 and later re-released by Caroline Records in 1989. Soon after, Eycke left the band and COC continued as a three-piece with Dean and Mullin sharing vocal duties on 1985&#x27;s follow-up &quot;Animosity&quot;, released through the Metal Blade Records imprint Death Records. Although it was well-received upon release and is now seen as an important album in the crossover thrash genre, Metal Blade did little to promote the album, prompting Dean to quit the band in 1987.

COC recruited Simon Bob Sinister to replace Dean, after the breakup of their fellow Carolina band and Death Records labelmates Ugly Americans. The band&#x27;s 1987 release, the &quot;Technocracy&quot; EP&quot;,&quot; featured the hectic crossover thrash musicianship of COC with a cleaner vocal style than they had in the past. The band issued the EP in order to fulfil their contractual obligations with Metal Blade. Bob soon left Corrosion of Conformity to return to Ugly Americans, after which the band broke up without notice for two years. Mullin said that because Metal Blade had charged the band for &quot;Technocracy&quot; as if it were a full-length album, &quot;[the band] lost a lot of control, we lost sight [and] we lost our track. We were finished.&quot;

=== &quot;Blind,&quot; &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Wiseblood&quot; (1989–1998) ===
In 1989, Weatherman and Reed decided to reform Corrosion of Conformity and began searching for a new vocalist, even posting a classified in Flipside Fanzine for a singer similar in sound to &quot;James Hetfield or Ozzy Osbourne&quot; to go with their new metal sound. Karl Agell was recruited on vocals, Phil Swisher on bass and Pepper Keenan as a second guitarist. Around this time, Caroline Records released some old tracks with Mike Dean singing during this time with the aptly named &quot;Six Songs with Mike Singing&quot; EP. Dean also participated in Snake Nation.

The new lineup released 1991&#x27;s &quot;Blind&quot;. &quot;Blind&quot; was the first COC album to receive mainstream attention. The video for &quot;Vote with a Bullet&quot; (the only song with Keenan on vocals on the album) received airplay on MTV and the album cracked the Billboard Heatseekers chart in early 1992. By 2011, the album had sold over 250,000 copies in the United States.

In 1993, Agell and Swisher left the band and formed the band Leadfoot, Dean returned and Keenan took over lead vocals.

The band began working on their next album for Relativity, &quot;Deliverance&quot;. During this time however, session demos for the album found their way into the hands of Columbia Records. The label then offered to buy the band&#x27;s contract from Relativity; when the label refused, Sony/Columbia bought Relativity, turned it into a distribution label, and transferred the band&#x27;s contract over to Columbia.

&quot;Deliverance&quot; saw the band also incorporating stoner and southern rock influences, which they also carried onto the following albums. In 1994, their song Big Problems was featured on the . The song &quot;Clean My Wounds&quot; was featured in the anime movie &quot;&quot;.

&quot;Deliverance&quot; was the band&#x27;s biggest selling album. This was mainly due to the singles &quot;Albatross&quot; and &quot;Clean My Wounds&quot; becoming Top 20 hits on rock radio and the album managed to spend almost four months on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 155. On the Heatseekers chart, it peaked at No. 5 and lasted almost a year on that particular chart.

&quot;Wiseblood&quot; was released in October 1996. Despite producing a Top 30 radio hit with &quot;Drowning in a Daydream&quot; and a worldwide tour with Metallica, the album failed to match the sales set by the previous album, selling over 140,000 copies by 2002. &quot;Drowning in a Daydream&quot; was nominated at the Grammy Awards in 1998 for &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot;.

===&quot;America&#x27;s Volume Dealer&quot; and &quot;In the Arms of God&quot; (1999–2006)===

Soon after the release of &quot;Wiseblood&quot;, Columbia dropped COC, who then moved to Sanctuary Records. The band released its first album for its new label, &quot;America&#x27;s Volume Dealer&quot;, in September 2000. The album was even more of a commercial failure than Wiseblood not even managing to make the Billboard 200. However, the single, &quot;Congratulations Song&quot;, did give the band another Top 30 hit. No videos were made from the album. Mullin left the band in 2001. Over the next few years, the band worked with a series of drummers: Jimmy Bower of Eyehategod, local Raleigh percussion professor Merritt Partridge, Stanton Moore of Galactic and Reed&#x27;s former drum technician Jason Patterson, who previously played drums in the Raleigh-based rock band Cry of Love.

In April 2005, COC released &quot;In the Arms of God&quot; to much critical acclaim. The album performed much better than their previous effort, debuting at No. 108 on the Billboard 200 and even topping the Heatseekers chart. This was achieved without even one radio hit from the album. A video was made for the song &quot;Stonebreaker&quot; which saw airplay on MTV2&#x27;s recently revived &quot;Headbanger&#x27;s Ball&quot;. The band spent the rest of the year touring the US and Canada. They were the opening acts for Motörhead and Disturbed and also went on headlining tours with Crowbar, Fu Manchu, Alabama Thunderpussy, and Danko Jones all providing support. A European tour was scheduled for September/October 2005 but was later canceled, after Hurricane Katrina ravaged Keenan&#x27;s hometown of New Orleans. A co-headlining UK tour with Clutch commenced in January 2006.

===Second hiatus (2006–2010)===
Corrosion of Conformity was on hiatus from 2006 to June 2010, while Pepper recorded and toured with Down. From March 2009 to June 2010, Karl Agell and Reed Mullin occasionally performed with Jerry Barrett, Scott Little, and Jason Browning (Browning eventually replaced by TR Gwynne) as &quot;COC-Blind&quot;, playing the Blind album. Reed Mullin and Mike Dean along with Jason Browning also toured in a new band called &quot;Righteous Fool&quot;, and have released a self-titled EP through Southern Lord Records.

===&quot;Animosity&quot; lineup reunion, &quot;Corrosion of Conformity&quot; and &quot;IX&quot; (2010–2014)===

On May 12, 2010, Blabbermouth.net reported that the &quot;Animosity&quot; lineup of Corrosion of Conformity was reuniting and working on a new album. They are planning some early-August shows lined up for the West Coast, although they have not yet been officially announced.
The band is still open to recording again as a four-piece with Pepper when the time is right, according to a message on the official COC website on May 15, 2010. Pepper currently, has not officially left the band.

Pepper joined his bandmates on stage on June 17, 2011, at the Hellfest (Clisson, France) to play &quot;Vote with a Bullet&quot; as well as on June 19, 2011, in Bilbao, Spain, where they additionally performed together on &quot;Señor Limpio&quot;. Pepper stated that he looks forward to working on some &quot;Deliverance&quot; type material in the near future with the band. The band released their eighth studio album, titled &quot;Corrosion of Conformity&quot;, on February 28, 2012, via Candlelight Records.

In September 2012, Corrosion of Conformity posted three pictures from the studio on Facebook, stating that they were working on a five-song EP called &quot;Megalodon&quot; with Mike Schaefer and John Custer. The entire EP was released for digital download via Scion A/V on November 14, 2012.

By January 2013, Corrosion of Conformity had begun writing new material for their ninth studio album, &quot;IX&quot;, which was released on July 1, 2014.

===Reunion with Pepper Keenan and &quot;No Cross No Crown&quot; (2014–2019)===

In a September 2014 interview with Heavy Blog Is Heavy, drummer Reed Mullin confirmed that Corrosion of Conformity would reunite with guitarist/vocalist Pepper Keenan in 2015 to record a new album, followed by a tour. They planned to begin work on their new album in January 2015.

On January 14, 2015, Corrosion of Conformity announced a six-date UK tour, which took place in March and was their first tour with the &quot;Deliverance&quot; lineup in 14 years as well their first one with Keenan in nine years. Corrosion of Conformity performed their first show with the re-united Deliverance era lineup of Pepper Keenan, Woody Weatherman, Mike Dean, and Reed Mullin on March 7, 2015, in Manchester, England. Their first US tour with the reunited lineup, supporting Clutch, was announced on July 28, 2015.

On June 6, 2016, Corrosion of Conformity announced the letting go of drummer Reed Mullin after a prolonged battle with alcohol addiction, resulting in a seizure before their concert in Edmonton, Canada on the Lamb of God and Clutch tour. Mullin returned to the drum stool on the tour on June 8.

On November 10, 2017, the band announced that their tenth studio album, &quot;No Cross No Crown&quot;, would be released on January 12, 2018. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Cast the First Stone&quot; was premiered on the same day.

===Death of Reed Mullin and Mike Dean&#x27;s second departure (2020–present)===
Mullin died on January 27, 2020. His replacement was immediately announced to be John Green from Manchester, England, who had previously worked as the band&#x27;s roadie and stepped in as a stand-in in 2019 for numerous shows.

Longtime bassist Mike Dean announced his second departure from Corrosion of Conformity on September 20, 2024, citing difficulties coping after Mullin&#x27;s death and living &quot;hundreds of miles away&quot; from the remaining members of the band as factors. The band announced that they will continue on with a new bassist and are planning to release a new album in 2025.

==Collaborations and side projects==
They have also collaborated with a number of other artists: James Hetfield of Metallica contributed vocals to the song &quot;Man or Ash&quot; on &quot;Wiseblood&quot;; Warren Haynes of the Allman Brothers&#x27; Band and Gov&#x27;t Mule played slide guitar on &quot;Stare Too Long&quot; on &quot;America&#x27;s Volume Dealer&quot;; and Stanton Moore of Galactic played drums on &quot;In the Arms of God&quot;.

Members of COC have also participated in collaborations: Keenan plays guitar with the metal supergroup Down, and Dean contributed vocals to a track titled &quot;Access Babylon&quot; on Dave Grohl&#x27;s Probot project. Pepper also appears on Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; cover record, playing guitar and singing the second verse of the Lynyrd Skynyrd song &quot;Tuesday&#x27;s Gone&quot;. He appears in the documentary &quot;Some Kind of Monster&quot;, auditioning to be Metallica&#x27;s replacement for Jason Newsted.

<doc id="900138" wikidata="Q15646788" url="?curid=900138" title="Chlorhexidine">
<text>Chlorhexidine is a disinfectant and antiseptic with the molecular formula C22H30Cl2N10, which is used for skin disinfection before surgery and to disinfect surgical instruments. It is also used for cleaning wounds, preventing dental plaque, treating yeast infections of the mouth, and to keep urinary catheters from blocking. It is used as a liquid or a powder. It is commonly used in salt form, either the gluconate or the acetate.
Side effects may include skin irritation, tooth discoloration, and allergic reactions, although, apart from discoloration, the risk appears to be the same as that for povidone-iodine. Chlorhexidine rinse is also known to have a bitter metallic aftertaste. Rinsing with water is not recommended as it is known to increase the bitterness. It may cause eye problems if direct contact occurs. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. Chlorhexidine may come mixed in alcohol, water, or surfactant solution. It is effective against a range of microorganisms, but does not inactivate spores.
Chlorhexidine came into medical use in the 1950s and is available over the counter in the United States. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 230th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

== Uses ==
Chlorhexidine is used in disinfectants (disinfection of the skin and hands), cosmetics (additive to creams, toothpaste, deodorants, and antiperspirants), and pharmaceutical products (preservative in eye drops, active substance in wound dressings and antiseptic mouthwashes).

In endodontics, chlorhexidine has been used for root canal irrigation and as an intracanal dressing.

=== Antiseptic ===
Chlorhexidine is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, and yeasts. It is particularly effective against Gram-positive bacteria (in concentrations ≥ 1 μg/L). Significantly higher concentrations (10 to more than 73 μg/mL) are required for Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Chlorhexidine is ineffective against polioviruses and adenoviruses. The effectiveness against herpes viruses has not yet been established unequivocally.

There is strong evidence that chlorhexidine is more effective than povidone-iodine for clean surgery. Evidence shows that it is an effective antiseptic for upper limb surgery.

Meta-data spanning several decades shows that the efficacy of chlorhexidine (against organisms that cause surgical site infection) has not changed, dispelling concerns over emerging resistance.

=== Dental use ===
Use of a chlorhexidine-based mouthwash in combination with normal tooth care can help reduce the build-up of plaque and improve mild gingivitis. There is not enough evidence to determine the effect in moderate to severe gingivitis. Its use as a mouthwash has a number of adverse effects including damage to the mouth lining, tooth discoloration, tartar build-up, and impaired taste. Extrinsic tooth staining occurs when chlorhexidine rinse has been used for four weeks or longer.

Mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine which stain teeth less than the classic solution have been developed, many of which contain chelated zinc.

Chlorhexidine is a cation which interacts with anionic components of toothpaste, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium monofluorophosphate, and forms salts of low solubility and reduced antibacterial activity. Hence, to enhance the antiplaque effect of chlorhexidine, &quot;it seems best that the interval between toothbrushing and rinsing with CHX [chlorhexidine] be more than 30 minutes, cautiously close to two hours after brushing&quot;.

=== Topical ===
Chlorhexidine gluconate is used as a skin cleanser for surgical scrubs, as a cleanser for skin wounds, for preoperative skin preparation, and for germicidal hand rinses. Chlorhexidine eye drops have been used as a treatment for eyes affected by &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; keratitis.

Chlorhexidine is a very effective antiseptic and its use is growing in the world for treating the umbilical cord. A 2015 Cochrane review has yielded high-quality evidence that within the community setting, chlorhexidine skin or cord care can reduce the incidence of omphalitis (inflammation of the umbilical cord) by 50% and neonatal mortality by 12%.

== Side effects ==
Side effects may include skin irritation, tooth discoloration, and allergic reactions, although apart from discoloration the risk appears to be the same as povidone-iodine.

Chlorhexidine is ototoxic (toxic to the inner ear). If put into a ruptured ear canal it may lead to deafness.

Chlorhexidine does not meet European specifications for a hand disinfectant. Under the test conditions of the European Standard EN 1499, no significant difference in the efficacy was found between a 4% solution of chlorhexidine digluconate and soap. In the US, between 2007 and 2009, Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center conducted a cluster-randomized trial and concluded that daily bathing of patients in intensive care units with washcloths saturated with chlorhexidine gluconate reduced the risk of hospital-acquired infections.

Whether prolonged exposure over many years may have carcinogenic potential is still not clear. The US Food and Drug Administration recommendation is to limit the use of a chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash to a maximum of six months.

When ingested, chlorhexidine is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and can cause stomach irritation or nausea. If aspirated into the lungs at high enough concentration, as reported in one case, it can be fatal due to the high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

==Mechanism of action==
At physiologic pH, chlorhexidine salts dissociate and release the positively charged chlorhexidine cation. The bactericidal effect is a result of the binding of this cationic molecule to negatively charged bacterial cell walls. At low concentrations of chlorhexidine, this results in a bacteriostatic effect; at high concentrations, membrane disruption results in cell death.

==Chemistry==
It is a cationic (bisbiguanide).

== Deactivation ==
Chlorhexidine is deactivated by forming insoluble salts with anionic compounds, including the anionic surfactants commonly used as detergents in toothpastes and mouthwashes, anionic thickeners such as carbomer, and anionic emulsifiers such as acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate , among many others. For this reason, chlorhexidine mouth rinses should be used at least 30 minutes after other dental products.

== Synthesis ==
The structure is based on two molecules of proguanil, linked with a hexamethylenediamine spacer.
== Society and culture ==
=== Brands ===
Chlorhexidine topical is sold as Betasept, Biopatch, Calgon Vesta, ChloraPrep One-Step, Dyna-Hex, Hibiclens, Hibistat Towelette, Scrub Care Exidine, and Spectrum-4, among others.

Chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash is sold as Dentohexin, Paroex, Peridex, PerioChip, Corsodyl and Periogard, among others.

==Veterinary medicine==
In animals, chlorhexidine is used for topical disinfection of wounds, and to manage skin infections. Chlorhexidine-based disinfectant products are used in the dairy farming industry.

Post-surgical respiratory problems have been associated with the use of chlorhexidine products in cats.

<text>Graveland are a Polish neo-Nazi pagan black metal band which was formed in 1991 by Rob Darken (born Robert Fudali). They began as a black metal band before adopting a pagan and Viking metal style. The lyrics and imagery of Graveland are strongly inspired by European mythology, nature, winter and war. Their early work focused on Celtic and Slavic mythology, while their later work focuses on Norse mythology and Wotanism.

== History ==
=== Beginning ===
Darken, who started Graveland as a solo project in 1991, was influenced by bands such as Bathory and Emperor. He recorded the first demos, &quot;Necromanteion&quot; and &quot;Drunemeton&quot;, working alone. In 1993, drummer Maciej &quot;Capricornus&quot; Dąbrowski joined the band, which then recorded &quot;In the Glare of Burning Churches&quot;. In 1994 the two were joined by Grzegorz &quot;Karcharoth&quot; Jurgielewicz (previously of Infernum) and recorded &quot;The Celtic Winter&quot;, which was released as an EP by the German label No Colours Records. No Colours currently releases the band&#x27;s new albums.

=== First albums ===
A few months later, the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Carpathian Wolves&quot; (recorded at the Radio PRO-FM Studio, Opole, 26 Apr – 2 May 1994), was released by Eternal Devils Records. With &quot;Carpathian Wolves&quot;, the band drew the attention of several bigger metal labels and was eventually signed by the Austrian Lethal Records label, which released &quot;Thousand Swords&quot;. This album was recorded in December 1994 at Tuba Studio, Wrocław, &quot;in the days of eternal winter &amp; frozen night of full moon, at the gates of a new era&quot;. The Lethal Records release showed a progression in Graveland&#x27;s sound from raw black metal to black metal with folk and Viking metal influence to it. The album is considered to be the band&#x27;s best release by many fans and a classic in the black metal scene. After reportedly making several racist statements, the band was dropped by Lethal. Darken then founded his own label, Isengard (later Eastclan), and re-released an extended &quot;Thousand Swords&quot; on cassette. The album&#x27;s booklet contains statements against Lethal Records and two other bigger metal labels, Osmose and Nuclear Blast. In 1999, the album was re-released, again, by No Colours with another different album cover. In 2001, it was re-released for a second time by No Colours on CD and vinyl. The CD version had the logo in red and the vinyl version had a red logo. The CD and vinyl versions had different covers from each other.

=== Move towards folk ===
The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Following the Voice of Blood&quot;, was recorded 25 September 1996 – 18 December 1996 and released in 1997 via No Colours. With the 1998 album, &quot;Immortal Pride&quot; (strongly influenced by the movie soundtrack of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;), the band took on a folk style, while moving more into Viking metal. Its sound became more epic, symphonic and added more keyboards and chorales. The songs also became much longer. (For instance, &quot;Immortal Pride&quot; consists of four songs: two of them being the intro and outro; and the other ones being 24 and 17 minutes long.)

In 2000, &quot;Raiders of Revenge&quot; (a split release with the RAC band Honor) and &quot;Creed of Iron / Prawo Stali&quot; were released. Since Creed, Darken has worked without Capricornus on drums.

In November 2015, it was announced that Rob Darken had assembled a live lineup and Graveland would play its very first live shows in April 2016.

On 22 February 2018, the band released a re-recorded version of &quot;Dawn of Iron Blades&quot; with new keyboards, drums, bass and female vocals. The band released the single &quot;Possessed by Steel&quot; on 14 April 2020. &quot;Hour of Ragnarok&quot; the band&#x27;s 13th studio album of original material was released on 23 August 2021 through Inferna Profundus Records.

== Ideology ==
Darken sees himself as a Heathen and Christianity as the worst enemy of white Europeans. He exalts the latter&#x27;s return to their ancestors&#x27; heritage, and has spoken out against &quot;race mixing&quot;. On the Graveland EP &quot;Raise Your Sword!&quot;, he declares Heathendom to be the religion of white Europeans.

Darken has been accused of being a neo-Nazi. In response to these accusations he has stated: &quot;I do not see any point in referring to NS because I do not see any point in referring to any ideologies that lost. It is against logic and eternal law of evolution. I think that white men should search for new ideas that would be well adapted for the current reality and the problems of [the] contemporary world.&quot; and &quot;If you are White proud of being White and proud of your forefathers faith, if you politically incorrect, if you dare to criticize the politicians and it you point at the existence of a strong powerful Jewish lobby supporting Israel – you are called Nazi and anti-Semite. And the special institution start to persecute you. I am called &#x27;Nazi&quot; but no one has any proof of my nazi background. They just repeat once heard someone else words having no proof of it.&quot; And &quot;In Poland many people refer to Slavonic heritage as many refer to German. And I think that those who refer to Slavonic culture are the majority but they do not make big show of it. For me there is no difference between pagan beliefs of Vikings and Slavs. The names are different but the core is the same. Different stories but the same Gods with the same attributes. The ideologist of the Third Reich were responsible for the division between German Aryan world and Slavonic world. They distorted the historical facts in order to separate from Eastern world. Communist did the same but they of course favouritized [sic] Slavs.&quot;&quot;&quot; Yet, in a 2006 interview with &quot;Decibel&quot;, he stated that &quot;Graveland is regarded as a NSBM band because of my political convictions, [which] most people would call extreme right-wing National Socialist convictions,&quot; and &quot;people I played with were Satanists and they were not interested in paganism. Due to these differences, we finally started to walk separate ways and Graveland became [a] one-man band again. I understood that I could not support Satanism [because it] was a part of Judeo-Christian religion. In the Third Reich, Satanists would end [up] in gas chambers.&quot;

<text>The Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) is a technologically advanced processing, display, and telecommunications system that is the cornerstone of the United States National Weather Service&#x27;s (NWS) operations.

AWIPS is a complex network of systems that ingests and integrates meteorological, hydrological, satellite, and radar data, and also processes and distributes the data to 135 Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and River Forecast Centers (RFCs) nationwide. Weather forecasters utilize the capabilities of AWIPS to make increasingly accurate weather, water, and climate predictions, and to dispense rapid, highly reliable warnings and advisories.

The AWIPS system architectural design is driven by expandability, flexibility, availability, and portability. The system is easily expandable to allow for the introduction of new functionality and the augmentation of network and processing capabilities. AWIPS is designed so that software and data can be migrated to new platforms as technology evolves.

== History ==
AWIPS replaced the Automation of Field Operations and Services (AFOS) system which had become obsolete and was very difficult to maintain. AWIPS was originally developed and maintained by PRC, Inc (later acquired by Northrop Grumman Information Technology) with installation completed in 1998.

Since 2005, Raytheon has been NWS’ partner for the operations, maintenance and evolution of AWIPS, providing the integrated mission services required to sustain and enhance system performance. It is a five-year contract with five one-year award terms for a potential maximum 10-year contract.

Teaming with Raytheon are Keane Federal Systems, Globecomm Systems Inc., GTSI Corp., ENSCO, Reston Consulting Group, Fairfield Technologies, Centuria Corporation, and Earth Resources Technology. Together they provide software operations and maintenance, software development, hardware maintenance and logistics, commercial off-the-shelf software maintenance, satellite communications, and network monitoring and control.

== Evolution ==

As the architect of the AWIPS evolution, Raytheon designed, developed, and released the system&#x27;s next-generation software known as AWIPS II. AWIPS II, which features a new service oriented architecture (SOA) began roll-out in late 2011. This new system simplified code and consequently strengthened system performance while reducing the maintenance burden. All of this is achieved while retaining a system look and feel that makes the AWIPS evolution appear similar to the user.

The AWIPS program office is working in conjunction with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to incorporate the NAWIPS baseline software used by the NCEP centers, National Hurricane Center (NHC) / Aviation Weather Center (AWC) / Storm Prediction Center (SPC) as well as the Weather Prediction Center (formerly Hydrometeorological Prediction Center) and Ocean Prediction Center (WPC and OPC) into the AWIPS II baseline. The commissioning of a new AWIPS site, the first since the Huntsville Weather Forecast Office in 2002, will also be part of this effort at the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in Boulder, CO.

<doc id="900146" wikidata="Q4934608" url="?curid=900146" title="Bobbi Harlow">
<text>Bobbi Harlow is a fictional character in Berke Breathed&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Bloom County&quot;.

A schoolteacher, Bobbi is popular among her students, particularly Milo Bloom and Michael Binkley, who both harbored crushes on her. However, the conservative adults in the town are suspicious of her liberal, feminist views. Their suspicions turn to outrage when she brings her left-wing, radical feminist politics into the classroom, such as having the students wear gas masks in case &quot;the fascists&quot; (or, as the children called them, &quot;fishes&quot;) tear gassed them, throwing fake blood at &quot;the war mongers&quot; (&quot;war monkeys&quot; in kid-speak) and teaching them about women&#x27;s liberation. Bobbi originally starts dating Steve Dallas, but is swept off her feet (figuratively and literally) by Cutter John.

Bobbi started out as a major recurring character in the strip, but as time went on her role became more and more limited. As the strip began to focus more on children and animal characters (with the notable exception of Steve), there was less room for Bobbi. By 1983, she was gone completely, without explanation.

Bobbi Harlow&#x27;s last appearance in the original &quot;Bloom County&quot; was in a 1988 Sunday strip, where it was revealed that she had joined the staff of &quot;Donahue&quot; in 1983, and then shaved her head in despair over the failure of the Equal Rights Amendment, and cut off her right ear after Geraldine Ferraro&#x27;s unsuccessful vice-presidential campaign.

<doc id="900160" wikidata="Q382774" url="?curid=900160" title="Internal wave">
<text>Internal waves are gravity waves that oscillate within a fluid medium, rather than on its surface. To exist, the fluid must be stratified: the density must change (continuously or discontinuously) with depth/height due to changes, for example, in temperature and/or salinity. If the density changes over a small vertical distance (as in the case of the thermocline in lakes and oceans or an atmospheric inversion), the waves propagate horizontally like surface waves, but do so at slower speeds as determined by the density difference of the fluid below and above the interface. If the density changes continuously, the waves can propagate vertically as well as horizontally through the fluid.

Internal waves, also called internal gravity waves, go by many other names depending upon the fluid stratification, generation mechanism, amplitude, and influence of external forces. If propagating horizontally along an interface where the density rapidly decreases with height, they are specifically called interfacial (internal) waves. If the interfacial waves are large amplitude they are called internal solitary waves or internal solitons. If moving vertically through the atmosphere where substantial changes in air density influences their dynamics, they are called anelastic (internal) waves. If generated by flow over topography, they are called Lee waves or mountain waves. If the mountain waves break aloft, they can result in strong warm winds at the ground known as Chinook winds (in North America) or Foehn winds (in Europe). If generated in the ocean by tidal flow over submarine ridges or the continental shelf, they are called internal tides. If they evolve slowly compared to the Earth&#x27;s rotational frequency so that their dynamics are influenced by the Coriolis effect, they are called inertia gravity waves or, simply, inertial waves. Internal waves are usually distinguished from Rossby waves, which are influenced by the change of Coriolis frequency with latitude.

==Visualization of internal waves==
An internal wave can readily be observed in the kitchen by slowly tilting back and forth a bottle of salad dressing - the waves exist at the interface between oil and vinegar.

Atmospheric internal waves can be visualized by wave clouds: at the wave crests air rises and cools in the relatively lower pressure, which can result in water vapor condensation if the relative humidity is close to 100%. Clouds that reveal internal waves launched by flow over hills are called lenticular clouds because of their lens-like appearance. Less dramatically, a train of internal waves can be visualized by rippled cloud patterns described as herringbone sky or mackerel sky. The outflow of cold air from a thunderstorm can launch large amplitude internal solitary waves at an atmospheric inversion. In northern Australia, these result in Morning Glory clouds, used by some daredevils to glide along like a surfer riding an ocean wave. Satellites over Australia and elsewhere reveal these waves can span many hundreds of kilometers.
Undulations of the oceanic thermocline can be visualized by satellite because the waves increase the surface roughness where the horizontal flow converges, and this increases the scattering of sunlight (as in the image at the top of this page showing of waves generated by tidal flow through the Strait of Gibraltar).

==Buoyancy, reduced gravity and buoyancy frequency==
According to Archimedes principle, the weight of an immersed object is reduced by the weight of fluid it displaces. This holds for a fluid parcel of density formula_1 surrounded by an ambient fluid of density formula_2. Its weight per unit volume is formula_3, in which formula_4 is the acceleration of gravity. Dividing by a characteristic density, formula_5, gives the definition of the reduced gravity:

:formula_6

If formula_7, formula_8 is positive though generally much smaller than formula_4. Because water is much more dense than air, the displacement of water by air from a surface gravity wave feels nearly the full force of gravity (formula_10). The displacement of the thermocline of a lake, which separates warmer surface from cooler deep water, feels the buoyancy force expressed through the reduced gravity. For example, the density difference between ice water and room temperature water is 0.002 the characteristic density of water. So the reduced gravity is 0.2% that of gravity. It is for this reason that internal waves move in slow-motion relative to surface waves.

Whereas the reduced gravity is the key variable describing buoyancy for interfacial internal waves, a different quantity is used to describe buoyancy in continuously stratified fluid whose density varies with height as formula_11. Suppose a water column is in hydrostatic equilibrium and a small parcel of fluid with density formula_12 is displaced vertically by a small distance formula_13. The buoyant restoring force results in a vertical acceleration, given by

:formula_14

This is the spring equation whose solution predicts oscillatory vertical displacement about formula_15 in time about with frequency given by the buoyancy frequency:

:formula_16

The above argument can be generalized to predict the frequency, formula_17, of a fluid parcel that oscillates along a line at an angle formula_18 to the vertical:

:formula_19.

This is one way to write the dispersion relation for internal waves whose lines of constant phase lie at an angle formula_18 to the vertical. In particular, this shows that the buoyancy frequency is an upper limit of allowed internal wave frequencies.

==Mathematical modeling of internal waves==

The theory for internal waves differs in the description of interfacial waves and vertically propagating internal waves. These are treated separately below.

===Interfacial waves===

In the simplest case, one considers a two-layer fluid in which a slab of fluid with uniform density formula_21 overlies a slab of fluid with uniform density formula_22. Arbitrarily the interface between the two layers is taken to be situated at formula_23 The fluid in the upper and lower layers are assumed to be irrotational. So the velocity in each layer is given by the gradient of a velocity potential, formula_24 and the potential itself satisfies Laplace&#x27;s equation:

:formula_25

Assuming the domain is unbounded and two-dimensional (in the formula_26 plane), and assuming the wave is periodic in formula_27 with wavenumber formula_28 the equations in each layer reduces to a second-order ordinary differential equation in formula_29. Insisting on bounded solutions the velocity potential in each layer is

:formula_30
and
:formula_31

with formula_32 the amplitude of the wave and formula_17 its angular frequency. In deriving this structure, matching conditions have been used at the interface requiring continuity of mass and pressure. These conditions also give the dispersion relation:

:formula_34

in which the reduced gravity formula_8 is based on the density difference between the upper and lower layers:

:formula_36

with formula_4 the Earth&#x27;s gravity. Note that the dispersion relation is the same as that for deep water surface waves by setting formula_38

===Internal waves in uniformly stratified fluid===

The structure and dispersion relation of internal waves in a uniformly stratified fluid is found through the solution of the linearized conservation of mass, momentum, and internal energy equations assuming the fluid is incompressible and the background density varies by a small amount (the Boussinesq approximation). Assuming the waves are two dimensional in the x-z plane, the respective equations are

:formula_39
:formula_40
:formula_41
:formula_42

in which formula_1 is the perturbation density, formula_44 is the pressure, and formula_45 is the velocity. The ambient density changes linearly with height as given by formula_11 and formula_5, a constant, is the characteristic ambient density.

Solving the four equations in four unknowns for a wave of the form formula_48 gives the dispersion relation

:formula_49

in which formula_50 is the buoyancy frequency and formula_51 is the angle of the wavenumber vector to the horizontal, which is also the angle formed by lines of constant phase to the vertical.

The phase velocity and group velocity found from the dispersion relation predict the unusual property that they are perpendicular and that the vertical components of the phase and group velocities have opposite sign: if a wavepacket moves upward to the right, the crests move downward to the right.

==Internal waves in the ocean==

Most people think of waves as a surface phenomenon, which acts between water (as in lakes or oceans) and the air. Where low density water overlies high density water in the ocean, internal waves propagate along the boundary. They are especially common over the continental shelf regions of the world oceans and where brackish water overlies salt water at the outlet of large rivers. There is typically little surface expression of the waves, aside from slick bands that can form over the trough of the waves.

Internal waves are the source of a curious phenomenon called dead water, first reported in 1893 by the Norwegian oceanographer Fridtjof Nansen, in which a boat may experience strong resistance to forward motion in apparently calm conditions. This occurs when the ship is sailing on a layer of relatively fresh water whose depth is comparable to the ship&#x27;s draft. This causes a wake of internal waves that dissipates a huge amount of energy.

==Properties of internal waves==

Internal waves typically have much lower frequencies and higher amplitudes than surface gravity waves because the density differences (and therefore the restoring forces) within a fluid are usually much smaller. Wavelengths vary from centimetres to kilometres with periods of seconds to hours respectively.

The atmosphere and ocean are continuously stratified: potential density generally increases steadily downward. Internal waves in a continuously stratified medium may propagate vertically as well as horizontally. The dispersion relation for such waves is curious: For a freely-propagating internal wave packet, the direction of propagation of energy (group velocity) is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave crests and troughs (phase velocity). An internal wave may also become confined to a finite region of altitude or depth, as a result of varying stratification or wind. Here, the wave is said to be &quot;ducted&quot; or &quot;trapped&quot;, and a vertically standing wave may form, where the vertical component of group velocity approaches zero. A ducted internal wave &quot;mode&quot; may propagate horizontally, with parallel group and phase velocity vectors, analogous to propagation within a waveguide.

At large scales, internal waves are influenced both by the rotation of the Earth as well as by the stratification of the medium. The frequencies of these geophysical wave motions vary from a lower limit of the Coriolis frequency (inertial motions) up to the Brunt–Väisälä frequency, or buoyancy frequency (buoyancy oscillations). Above the Brunt–Väisälä frequency, there may be evanescent internal wave motions, for example those resulting from partial reflection. Internal waves at tidal frequencies are produced by tidal flow over topography/bathymetry, and are known as internal tides. Similarly, atmospheric tides arise from, for example, non-uniform solar heating associated with diurnal motion.

==Onshore transport of planktonic larvae==
Cross-shelf transport, the exchange of water between coastal and offshore environments, is of particular interest for its role in delivering meroplanktonic larvae to often disparate adult populations from shared offshore larval pools. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the cross-shelf of planktonic larvae by internal waves. The prevalence of each type of event depends on a variety of factors including bottom topography, stratification of the water body, and tidal influences.

===Internal tidal bores===
Similarly to surface waves, internal waves change as they approach the shore. As the ratio of wave amplitude to water depth becomes such that the wave “feels the bottom,” water at the base of the wave slows down due to friction with the sea floor. This causes the wave to become asymmetrical and the face of the wave to steepen, and finally the wave will break, propagating forward as an internal bore. Internal waves are often formed as tides pass over a shelf break. The largest of these waves are generated during springtides and those of sufficient magnitude break and progress across the shelf as bores. These bores are evidenced by rapid, step-like changes in temperature and salinity with depth, the abrupt onset of upslope flows near the bottom and packets of high frequency internal waves following the fronts of the bores.

The arrival of cool, formerly deep water associated with internal bores into warm, shallower waters corresponds with drastic increases in phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations and changes in plankter species abundances. Additionally, while both surface waters and those at depth tend to have relatively low primary productivity, thermoclines are often associated with a chlorophyll maximum layer. These layers in turn attract large aggregations of mobile zooplankton that internal bores subsequently push inshore. Many taxa can be almost absent in warm surface waters, yet plentiful in these internal bores.

===Surface slicks===
While internal waves of higher magnitudes will often break after crossing over the shelf break, smaller trains will proceed across the shelf unbroken. At low wind speeds these internal waves are evidenced by the formation of wide surface slicks, oriented parallel to the bottom topography, which progress shoreward with the internal waves. Waters above an internal wave converge and sink in its trough and upwell and diverge over its crest. The convergence zones associated with internal wave troughs often accumulate oils and flotsam that occasionally progress shoreward with the slicks. These rafts of flotsam can also harbor high concentrations of larvae of invertebrates and fish an order of magnitude higher than the surrounding waters.

===Predictable downwellings===
Thermoclines are often associated with chlorophyll maximum layers. Internal waves represent oscillations of these thermoclines and therefore have the potential to transfer these phytoplankton rich waters downward, coupling benthic and pelagic systems. Areas affected by these events show higher growth rates of suspension feeding ascidians and bryozoans, likely due to the periodic influx of high phytoplankton concentrations. Periodic depression of the thermocline and associated downwelling may also play an important role in the vertical transport of planktonic larvae.

===Trapped cores===
Large steep internal waves containing trapped, reverse-oscillating cores can also transport parcels of water shoreward. These non-linear waves with trapped cores had previously been observed in the laboratory and predicted theoretically. These waves propagate in environments characterized by high shear and turbulence and likely derive their energy from waves of depression interacting with a shoaling bottom further upstream. The conditions favorable to the generation of these waves are also likely to suspend sediment along the bottom as well as plankton and nutrients found along the benthos in deeper water.

<text>Munchkin is a dedicated deck card game by Steve Jackson Games, written by Steve Jackson and illustrated by John Kovalic. It is a humorous take on role-playing games, based on the concept of munchkins (immature role-players, playing only to &quot;win&quot; by having the most powerful character possible).

&quot;Munchkin&quot; won the 2001 Origins Award for &quot;Best Traditional Card Game&quot;, and is itself a spin-off of &quot;The Munchkin&#x27;s Guide to Powergaming&quot;, a gaming humor book which also won an Origins Award in 2000.

After the success of the original &quot;Munchkin&quot; game several expansion packs and sequels were published. Now available in 15 different languages, &quot;Munchkin&quot; accounted for more than 70% of the 2007 sales for Steve Jackson Games and remains their top-selling title through 2020.

== Gameplay ==

In &quot;Munchkin&quot;, all players start at level 1, with the goal of reaching level 10 (or level 20 in Epic Level games). Players primarily progress by killing monsters, and level up every time they kill a monster. However, players can freely use cards against monsters and other players during play, allowing them to either assist or to sabotage others during their turn. Each person&#x27;s turn begins when they &quot;kick down the door&quot; by drawing a Door Card face-up. A Door Card can be one of the following types: a Monster Card, which the player must engage by fighting or fleeing; a Curse Card, which applies an effect; or an Item Card, Race Card, or Class Card, which the player adds to their hand. If the card drawn is not a Monster Card, the player can either &quot;loot the room&quot; by drawing a face-down door card and adding it to their hand, or &quot;look for trouble&quot; by playing a Monster Card from their hand to fight it.

When fighting a monster, the total level of the player, combined with the power from the items they possess (and any supporting players&#x27; total level and item power), is weighed against the total level of the monster(s) to determine the victor. A successful player draws the listed amount of treasure cards and levels up according to however many levels the monster is worth. An unsuccessful character must roll the dice to try and flee; players who fail to roll a five or six suffer the monster&#x27;s negative effects (&quot;Bad Stuff&quot;), which can include losing levels, losing a piece of equipment, losing cards from hand, or even dying. If a player dies, their turn immediately ends, and other players will get their chance to Loot the Body.

Starting with the player with the highest level, everyone else chooses one card and in case of ties in Level, rolls a die. Once everyone gets one card, the rest is discarded. When the next player&#x27;s turn begins, the new character appears and can help others in combat with its Level and Class or Race abilities. The next turn starts with four face-down cards being drawn from each deck and any desired legal cards being played, like at game start. The turn then proceeds normally.

Due to the highly competitive nature of the game and the presence of rule-breaking cards, players are encouraged to use unfair tactics against others, to act as a mercenary to further themselves at the expense of others, or to use cheat cards to affect outcomes (such as fixing the roll of the die). Throughout a player&#x27;s turn, others are free to intervene: they can passively buff or debuff the player or monsters to alter the outcome; play monster cards of matching types to make the battle more difficult; or offer to assist the player, typically in exchange for treasure cards.

Other cards that can enter play include Items, which can be used in combat, Treasure Cards, which act as sellable loot and equipment, and Curse Cards, which apply effects. Additionally, players can equip certain cards (such as armor and weapons) to raise their combat power and kill stronger monsters, and can use Class Cards and Race Cards to grant extra abilities or advantages at the cost of a balanced weakness; for example, the elf race can level when helping others kill monsters, but will take additional damage from disgusting enemies.

Standard games typically last around an hour, with the game ending once a player reaches the target level and wins the match. Aside from defeating monsters, players can progress through indirect means such as selling cards (with every 1000 Gold on the sum total granting a level) or by playing special leveling cards. Most games disallow victory through indirect methods, meaning only fighting a monster can win the game. There are a few exceptions, however, such as when a player uses cards that specifically state they override rules.

== Reception ==
An early review on RPGnet regards &quot;Munchkin&quot; as not a very serious game; the rules make this clear with phrases like &quot;Decide who goes first by rolling the dice and arguing about the results and the meaning of this sentence and whether the fact that a word seems to be missing any effect,&quot; and &quot;Any disputes in the rules should be settled by loud arguments with the owner of the game having the last word.&quot; There are many cards which interact with or are affected by a single other card, despite the rarity of the two cards entering play together (such as the interaction between &quot;Fowl Fiend&quot; and &quot;Chicken on Your Head&quot; or &quot;Sword of Slaying Everything Except Squid&quot; and &quot;Squidzilla&quot;).

On &quot;BoardGameGeek&quot; the average user rating is 6/10. Tom Vasel of The Dice Tower was critical of the game Munchkin feeling it was overpriced, had limited re-playability, and a poor and occasionally tedious gaming experience.

In a review of &quot;Munchkin&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Bob Byrne said &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine anyone playing &quot;Munchkin&quot; with two friends and not enjoying it. [...] The shifting alliances, the humor on the cards, the ebb and flow of winning and losing: it is simply a fun, fun game. We often don&#x27;t finish in an hour and declare the leader the winner (though it is possible to get to level ten in an hour). But unlike many games, the experience of just playing is the real reward.&quot; Mark Rigney for &quot;Black Gate&quot; said &quot;Here there be dragons, yes, but also a lot of snide references aimed at society in general. For my money (thank goodness, our box of &quot;Munchkin&quot; was a gift, so it cost me nothing), it&#x27;s all in good fun.&quot;

<text>Walter Slezak (; 3 May 1902 – 21 April 1983) was an Austrian-born film and stage actor active between 1922 and 1976. He mainly appeared in German films before migrating to the United States in 1930 and performing in numerous Hollywood productions.

Slezak typically portrayed wily and loquacious characters, often philosophical, and often with a taste for food, drink, and fine living. He played a crafty villain as a U-boat captain in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Lifeboat&quot; (1944), a charming, two-timing major domo to a tycoon in &quot;Come September&quot; (1961), and a wandering gypsy in &quot;The Inspector General&quot; (1949). He stood out as shrewd, unscrupulous private investigators in film noir, as in &quot;Cornered&quot; (1945) and &quot;Born to Kill&quot; (1947).

==Early life==
Slezak was born in Vienna, the son of opera tenor Leo Slezak and Elisabeth &quot;Elsa&quot; Wertheim. He studied medicine for a time and later worked as a bank teller. His older sister Margarete Slezak was also an actress. 

==Career==
Slezak was talked into taking his first role, in the 1922 Austrian film &quot;Sodom und Gomorrah&quot;, by his friend and the film&#x27;s director, Michael Curtiz.In his youth (while still slim) Slezak was cast as a leading man in silent films. He also acted on the stage for many years, debuting on Broadway in 1931.

His first American film was &quot;Once Upon a Honeymoon&quot; (1942), with Ginger Rogers and Cary Grant. He worked steadily and appeared in over 100 films including &quot;The Princess and the Pirate&quot; (1944), &quot;The Spanish Main&quot; (1945), &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot; (1947), &quot;Born to Kill&quot; (1947), &quot;Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion&quot; (1950), &quot;People Will Talk&quot; (1951), and &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; (1953).

Slezak played the lead in Broadway musicals, including &quot;Fanny&quot;, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical.
Slezak acted in radio in such shows as &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;, &quot;Columbia Workshop&quot;, &quot;The Pepsodent Show&quot;, and &quot;The Charlie McCarthy Show&quot;. He made numerous television appearances, including in the programs &quot;The Loretta Young Show&quot;, &quot;This Is Show Business&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, and &quot;Studio One&quot;. He starred in an unsold television pilot, &quot;Slezak and Son&quot;, that aired in 1960 as an episode of the anthology series &quot;New Comedy Showcase&quot;, and appeared as The Clock King in episodes 45 and 46 of TV series &quot;Batman&quot; in 1966.

In 1959/60, Slezak appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in Johann Strauss&#x27;s operetta &quot;Der Zigeunerbaron&quot;. In the 1970s, Slezak played the non-singing role of Frosch, the jailer, in the San Francisco Opera production of Johann Strauss&#x27;s operetta &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;. Later film roles in Britain included the Cliff Richard vehicle &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; (1964) and &quot;Black Beauty&quot; (1971).

==Personal life==
Slezak married Johanna &quot;Kaasi&quot; Van Rijn on 10 October 1943. The couple had three children: Ingrid, Erika, and Leo. Erika went on to become an Emmy-winning actress, and starred as Victoria Lord on the long-running soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 1971 to its cancellation in 2012. In 1974, Slezak appeared on the series as her character&#x27;s godfather, Lazlo Braedecker.
Slezak was close friends in Vienna in the 1930s with heiress Maria Altmann and her family.

==Death==
On 21 April 1983, Slezak died from a self-inflicted gunshot. He was reportedly despondent over the state of his health, most notably heart trouble, a recent prostate operation, and a shoulder injury requiring several treatments a week. He was buried in the grave of his parents in the cemetery of St. Laurentius Church, a Catholic parish in Egern, Bavaria.

==Autobiography==
Slezak&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;What Time&#x27;s the Next Swan?&quot; was published in 1962. The book&#x27;s title refers to an alleged incident in the career of his father, &quot;heldentenor&quot; Leo Slezak. During a performance in the title role of &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, the elder Slezak was supposed to finish his aria by stepping into a swan boat and then being pulled offstage. When a stagehand removed the boat prematurely, Slezak supposedly reacted to the error by asking the audience &quot;What time&#x27;s the next swan?&quot;

==Awards==
In 1955, Slezak won a Tony Award for his role in the Broadway production of &quot;Fanny&quot;.

<doc id="900186" wikidata="Q6972898" url="?curid=900186" title="National Geophysical Data Center">
<text>The United States National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) provided scientific stewardship, products and services for geophysical data describing the solid earth, marine, and solar-terrestrial environment, as well as earth observations from space. It was established in 1965 as part of the new Environmental Science Services Administration until that organization became the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 1970. In 2015, NGDC was merged with the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) into the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).

==Location and controlling bodies==
Since 1972 the NGDC was located in Boulder, Colorado as a part of the US Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS).

==Data holdings==
NGDC&#x27;s data holdings contained more than 300 digital and analog databases, with over 37 terabytes of unique digital records plus paper, film, slides and microfilm in 2003. As technology advanced, so did the search for more efficient ways of preserving these data. This data is now maintained by the NCEI.

==Data contributors==
NGDC worked closely with contributors of scientific data to prepare documented, reliable data sets. They welcomed cooperative projects with other government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and universities, and encourage data exchange.

==Data users==
NGDC&#x27;s data users included:

* private industry
* universities and other educational facilities
* research organizations
* federal, state, and local governments
* foreign governments, industry, and academia
* publishers and other mass media
* the general public

==Data management==
The Data Center developed data management programs that reflect the changing world of geophysics. These programs are now part of the National Centers for Environmental Information.

<text>Eddie Harris (October 20, 1934 – November 5, 1996) was an American jazz musician, best known for playing tenor saxophone and for introducing the electrically amplified saxophone. He was also fluent on the electric piano and organ. His best-known compositions are &quot;Freedom Jazz Dance&quot;, popularized by Miles Davis in 1966, and &quot;Listen Here&quot;.

==Biography==
Harris was born and grew up in Chicago. His father was from Cuba and his mother from Mississippi. He studied music under Walter Dyett at DuSable High School, as had many other successful Chicago musicians (including Nat King Cole, Clifford Jordan, Johnny Griffin, Gene Ammons, Julian Priester, and others). He later studied music at Roosevelt University; by that time he was proficient on piano, vibraphone, and tenor saxophone. While in college he performed professionally with Gene Ammons.

After college, Harris was drafted into the United States Army and while serving in Europe, he was accepted into the 7th Army Band which also included Don Ellis, Leo Wright, and Cedar Walton.

Leaving military service, Harris worked in New York City before returning to Chicago where he signed a contract with Vee Jay Records. His first album for Vee Jay, &quot;Exodus to Jazz&quot;, included his own jazz arrangement of Ernest Gold&#x27;s theme from the movie &quot;Exodus&quot;. A shortened version of the track, which featured his playing in the upper register of the tenor saxophone, was heavily played on radio and became the first jazz record ever to be certified gold.

The single, &quot;Exodus&quot;, climbed into the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached No. 16 in the U.S. R&amp;B chart. He moved to Columbia Records in 1964 and then to Atlantic Records the following year where he re-established himself. In 1965, Atlantic released &quot;The In Sound&quot;, a bop album which won back many of his detractors.

During the next few years, he began to perform on electric piano and the electric Varitone saxophone, and to perform a mixture of jazz and funk that sold well in both the jazz and rhythm and blues markets. In 1967, his album &quot;The Electrifying Eddie Harris&quot; reached second place on the R&amp;B chart. The album&#x27;s second track, &quot;Listen Here&quot;, was issued as a single climbing to No. 11 R&amp;B and No. 45 on the Hot 100. Harris released several different versions of his composition over the years, including both studio and live concert recordings. The first appeared on an early Atlantic album, &quot;Mean Greens&quot;, featuring him on electric piano. He was to re-work the track two years later, stretching it out to over seven minutes in length, for his hit version on which he played saxophone. The entire track appeared on both sides of the Atlantic hit single and edited into two parts. For the 11th Annual Grammy Awards in 1968, Harris was nominated for the Best Instrumental Jazz Performance for Small Group or Soloist with Small Group for the Album – &quot;The Electrifying Eddie Harris&quot;.

In 1969, he performed with pianist and vocalist Les McCann at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Although the musicians had been unable to rehearse, their session was so successful that a recording of it was released by Atlantic as &quot;Swiss Movement&quot;. This became one of the best-selling jazz albums ever and was nominated during the 13th Annual Grammy Awards (1970) for the Best Jazz Performance – Small Group or Soloist with Small Group.

Harris also came up with the idea of the reed trumpet, playing one for the first time at the 1970 Newport Jazz Festival. He moved from Chicago to Los Angeles in the 1970s. From 1970 to 1975, he experimented with new instruments of his own invention (the reed trumpet was a trumpet with a saxophone mouthpiece, the was a saxophone with a trombone mouthpiece, and the guitorgan was a combination of guitar and organ), with singing the blues, with jazz-rock (he recorded an album with Steve Winwood, Jeff Beck, Albert Lee, Ric Grech, Zoot Money, Ian Paice and other rockers). He also started singing comic R&amp;B/blues songs, such as &quot;That is Why You&#x27;re Overweight&quot; and &quot;Eddie Who?&quot;.

In 1975, however, he alienated some of his audience with his album &quot;The Reason Why I&#x27;m Talking S--t&quot;, which consisted mainly of comedy. After recording for Atlantic for over 12 years, Harris left the record company after completing his final album for the label in 1977. He then signed with RCA Records and recorded two albums.

Harris died of congestive heart failure in Los Angeles on November 5, 1996, at the age of 62.

<text>Czesław Słania (22 October 1921 Czeladź; 17 March 2005 Kraków) was a Polish postage stamp and banknote engraver, living in Sweden from 1956. According to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, Słania was the most skilled and prolific of all stamp engravers, with over 1000 stamps to his credit. His 1000th engraved stamp, based on the 17th-century painting &quot;Great Deeds by Swedish Kings&quot; by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl (2000), is in the Guinness Book as the largest engraved stamp ever issued.

== Life ==
Słania was born in Czeladź, Poland, and was the son of a miner. During the German invasion of Poland and outbreak of World War II in 1939, he was a student of a gymnasium in Lublin. During the subsequent German occupation he forged German money and documents for the Polish resistance, and in the later part of the war he became a soldier of the Second Polish Army. After the war, as a demobilized lieutenant, he settled in 1945 in Pisarzowice. Unwilling to become a farmer, he entered the Kraków School of Fine Arts, a renowned graphics arts centre, that same year. While still a student, Słania was employed by the Polish Stamp Printing Works in Łódź and Warsaw, where he learned to engrave in steel. His first stamp was issued in Poland on 24 March 1951.

In 1956, Słania moved to Sweden, where he began employment with the Swedish postal authorities in 1959. He produced stamps for Sweden and 30 other countries. His work was of such recognized quality and detail that he is one of the very few &quot;household names&quot; among philatelists, and some specialize in collecting his work.

He was the Royal Court Engraver of Sweden since 1972.

In 2000, his 1000th stamp was issued in Sweden, and his 1001st stamp was issued in Poland. His last work was a stamp in 2005 to commemorate the 60th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

He was also very productive in designing and engraving banknotes for numerous countries in six out of seven continents. 

== Awards ==
Czesław Słania received many awards during his life, including:

* Commander of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland 1999
* Order of Saint Charles
* Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog (Denmark)
* Order Mérite Culturel (Monaco)
* Robert Stolz Music Prize (Sweden 1983)
* Rowland Hill Award 2002

<doc id="900205" wikidata="Q7335565" url="?curid=900205" title="Riparian water rights">
<text>Riparian water rights (or simply riparian rights) is a system for allocating water among those who possess land along its path. It has its origins in English common law. Riparian water rights exist in many jurisdictions with a common law heritage, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and states in the eastern United States.

Common land ownership can be organized into a partition unit, a corporation consisting of the landowners on the shore that formally owns the water area and determines its use.

== General principle ==
Under the riparian principle, all landowners whose properties adjoin a body of water have the right to make reasonable use of it as it flows through or over their properties. If there is not enough water to satisfy all users, allotments are generally fixed in proportion to frontage on the water source. These rights cannot be sold or transferred other than with the adjoining land and only in reasonable quantities associated with that land. The water cannot be transferred out of the watershed without due consideration as to the rights of the downstream riparian landowners.

Riparian rights include such things as the right to access for swimming, boating and fishing; the right to wharf out to a point of navigability; the right to erect structures such as docks, piers, and boat lifts; the right to use the water for domestic purposes; the right to accretions caused by water level fluctuations; the right to exclusive use if the waterbody is non-navigable. Riparian rights also depend upon &quot;reasonable use&quot; as it relates to other riparian owners to ensure that the rights of one riparian owner are weighed fairly and equitably with the rights of adjacent riparian owners.

==England and Wales==
The Environment Agency lists the riparian rights and duties in England and Wales.

The rights include ownership of the land up to the centre of the watercourse unless it is known to be owned by someone else, the right for water to flow onto land in its natural quantity and quality, the right to protect property from flooding and land from erosion subject to approval by the agency, the right to fish in the watercourse unless the right is sold or leased if an angler has a valid Environment Agency rod licence. They also include the right to acquire accretion and the right to boomage (a fee charge for securing a boom, generally for the retention of logs).

Duties arising from the model include the following:
* Pass on the flow of water without obstruction, pollution or diversion affecting the rights of others.
* Maintain the bed and banks of the watercourse and to clear any debris, whether natural or artificial, to keep any culverts, rubbish screens, weirs and mill gates clear of debris.
* Be responsible for protection of land from flooding and cause no obstructions, temporary or permanent, preventing the free passage of fish.
* Accept flood flows even if caused by inadequate capacity downstream, but there is no duty to improve the drainage capacity of a watercourse.

== United States ==

The United States recognizes two types of water rights. Although use and overlap varies over time and by state, the western arid states that were once under Mexico and Spain generally follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, also known as &quot;first-come, first-served&quot;, but water rights for the eastern states follow riparian law.

===Riparian rights===
Under riparian law, water is a public good like the air, sunlight, or wildlife. It is not &quot;owned&quot; by the government, state or private individual but is rather included as part of the land over which it falls from the sky or then travels along the surface.

In determining the contours of riparian rights, there is a clear distinction between navigable (public) waters and non-navigable waters. The land below navigable waters is the property of state, and subject to all the public land laws and in most states public trust rights. Navigable waters are treated as public highways with any exclusive riparian right ending at the ordinary high water mark. Like a road, any riparian right is subordinate to the public&#x27;s right to travel on the river, but any public right is subject to nuisance laws and the police power of the state. It is not an individual right or liberty interest. Because a finding of navigability establishes state versus federal property, navigability for purposes of riverbed title is a federal question determined under federal law. The states retain the power of defining the scope of the public trust over navigable waters. A non-navigable stream is synonymous with private property, or jointly-owned property if it serves as a boundary.

The state could choose to divest itself of title to the streambed, but the waters and use of the waters remains subject to the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution which holds an easement or servitude, benefiting the federal government for the purpose of regulating commerce on navigable bodies of water.

The reasonable use of the water by a riparian owner is subject to the downstream riparian owner&#x27;s &quot;riparian right&quot; to receive waters undiminished in flow and quality. Federal environmental regulation of non-navigable waters under the Clean Water Act of 1972 was possible, because all surface waters eventually flowed to the public ocean. This has been the subject of political controversy, for example over implementation of the Clean Water Rule.

In 2023 the United States Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Sackett v. EPA&quot; by a 5–4 decision that the EPA could only regulate waters in the United States which have not been isolated from larger bodies of water.

===States&#x27; involvement===
Federal courts have long recognized that state laws establish the extent of the riparian and public right. In the case of navigable waters, title goes to the average low water mark. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court defined it as the &quot;ordinary low water mark, unaffected by drought; that is, the height of the water at ordinary stages.&quot; Land below the low water mark on navigable rivers belongs to the state government in the case of the 13 original states.

Lands between the high and low water marks on navigable rivers are subject to the police powers of the states. In the case of the original 13 states, upon ratification of the US Constitution, title to these submerged lands remained vested in the several states similar to the public or common roads.

As new lands were acquired by the United States, either by purchase or treaty, title to the highways and the beds of all navigable, or tidal, water bodies became vested in the United States unless they had been validly conveyed into private ownership by the former sovereign. During the territorial period, the United States held these title &quot;in trust&quot; for the benefit of the future states that would be carved out of the territory. Each of the states were to come into the Union on an &quot;equal footing&quot; with the original 13 states. Under the equal footing doctrine, territorial states are vested with the same sovereign title rights to navigable submerged lands as the original 13 states. However, during the territorial period, the United States could convey certain of these lands under the limited circumstances of promoting commerce.

Ownership of lands submerged by navigable waters was resolved by Congress passing the Submerged Lands Act, which confirmed state title to the beds of all tidal and navigable bodies of water. While the act conveyed land title to the states, non-navigable stream beds remained treated like dry lands and contiguous to the adjoining estates. Waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tides, even if non-navigable, also passed to the states, but the continued ownership and public use of these tidal/marsh lands are based on state laws.

<text>This is a list of regions in Manitoba, Canada, including Manitoba&#x27;s geographic regions, economic regions, and health regions. These regions do not reflect the organization of local government in Manitoba.

These areas are solely based on economic relationships that exist between neighbouring towns and municipalities.

Manitoba&#x27;s 8 economic regions include the following.

<text>The National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) was one of the national environmental data centers operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The main NODC facility was located in Silver Spring, Maryland, and consisted of five divisions. The NODC also had field offices collocated with major government or academic oceanographic laboratories in Stennis Space Center, MS; Miami, FL; La Jolla, San Diego, California; Seattle, WA; Austin, Texas; Charleston, South Carolina; Norfolk, Virginia; and Honolulu, Hawaii. In 2015, NODC was merged with the National Climatic Data Center and the National Geophysical Data Center into the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).

NOAA also operated two other data centers: National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), Asheville, North Carolina and National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), Boulder, Colorado. In 2015, the three merged to form the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado, is also operated for NGDC by the University of Colorado through the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES).

These discipline-oriented centers served as national repositories and dissemination facilities for global environmental data. The data archives amassed by the NODC and the other centers provide a record of Earth&#x27;s changing environment, support numerous research and operational applications, and are still available through the NCEI. Working cooperatively, the centers provided data products and services to scientists, engineers, resource managers, policy makers, and other users—both in the United States and around the world.

==History==
Established in 1961, the NODC was originally an interagency facility administered by the U.S. Naval Hydrographic (later Oceanographic) Office. The NODC was transferred to NOAA in 1970 when NOAA was created by Executive Order by then-President, Richard Nixon. In the words of its charter, the NODC serves to &quot;acquire, process, preserve, and disseminate oceanographic data.&quot; Its primary mission is to ensure that global oceanographic data sets collected at great cost are maintained in a permanent archive that is easily accessible to the world science community, and to other users.

==Mission==
The NODC&#x27;s mission statement was &quot;To provide scientific stewardship of marine data and information&quot;.

==Core description==
The National Oceanographic Data Center, National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC) and NOAA Central Library, with its regional branch assets, were integrated to provide access to the world&#x27;s most comprehensive sources of marine environmental data and information. NODC maintains and updates a national ocean archive with environmental data acquired from domestic and foreign activities, and produces products and research from these data, to help monitor global environmental changes. The data included physical, biological and chemical measurements derived from in situ oceanographic observations, satellite remote sensing of the oceans, and ocean model simulations. NODC personnel directly interacted with federal, state, academic, and industrial oceanographic activities, represent NESDIS on various interagency domestic panels, committees and councils, and represent the United States in various international organizations, such as the International Oceanographic Data Exchange. The Data Center represents NESDIS and NOAA to the general public, government agencies, private institutions, foreign governments, and the private sector on matters involving oceanographic data.

==Data holdings==
The NODC managed the world&#x27;s largest collection of publicly available oceanographic data. NODC holdings included in situ and remotely sensed physical, chemical, and biological oceanographic data from coastal and deep ocean areas. These were originally collected for a variety of operational and research missions by U.S. Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (primarily the U.S. Navy); by State and local government agencies; by universities and research institutions; and private industry. NODC data holdings extended back over a hundred years, and the volume is expected to grow exponentially as new ocean observing systems are deployed.

Through NODC archive and access services, these ocean data were reused to answer questions about climate change, ocean phenomena, and management of coastal and marine resources, marine transportation, recreation, national security, and natural disasters. Another significant user community is Education, where these data and information products help teach each new generation of students about the oceans. Requests for oceanographic data and information have increased each year since the Center was established in 1961. Access to these archives is still available through the NCEI.

===International cooperation and data exchange===
A significant percentage of the oceanographic data held by NODC was foreign. NODC acquired foreign data through direct bilateral exchanges with other countries, and through the facilities of the World Data Center for Oceanography, Silver Spring, which is collocated with, and operated by, NODC.

There are three World Data Centers for Oceanography:
World Data Center, Silver Spring, Maryland, United States, 
World Data Center, Moscow, Russia, and 
World Data Center, Tianjin, People&#x27;s Republic of China. 
They are part of the World Data Center System initiated in 1957 to provide a mechanism for data exchange, and they operate under guidelines issued by the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).

Under NODC leadership, the Global Data Archeology and Rescue (GODAR) project grew into a major international program sponsored by the Inter-governmental Oceanographic Commission. GODAR is a comprehensive effort to locate, rescue, quality control, and disseminate historical global ocean profile data for use by the climate and global change research community.

===Data management for global change studies===
The NODC provided data management support for major ocean science projects and promotes improved working relations with the academic ocean research community.

==NOAA library and information network==
The NODC also managed the NOAA Library and Information Network, which included the NOAA Central Library in Silver Spring, MD; regional libraries in Miami, FL and Seattle, WA; and field libraries or information centers at about 30 NOAA sites throughout the United States. The combined libraries contained millions of volumes including books, journals, CD-ROMs, DVDs, audio, and video tapes. These holdings are now managed by the NCEI.

===User services===
Each year, the NODC responded to thousands of requests for oceanographic data and information. Copies of specified data sets or data selected from the NODC&#x27;s archive databases were provided to users on various media types, or online. NODC data products were provided at prices that cover the cost of data selection and retrieval. However, data provided on the NODC public website is free of charge.

<text>Betchadupa was a New Zealand pop/rock group, formed in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1997. The band featured Liam Finn, Chris Garland, Joe Bramley, and Matt Eccles.

Betchadupa (originally called Lazy Boy – the name change followed threatened legal action from the chair company of the same name) had its origins when Liam and Matt met whilst their families were on holidays in New Zealand. Their first song, written when both boys were 11, was called &#x27;Gee This Sounds Good, I Can&#x27;t Believe We Wrote It&#x27;. Their unique name was lifted from the text of a Polish-American&#x27;s T-shirt that declared &quot;You Betchadupa I&#x27;m Polish&quot;, &quot;dupa&quot; being the casual Polish word for &quot;arse&quot;.

The band based themselves in London, UK, after spending much of 2004 in Melbourne, Australia. The band have been on hiatus while Liam has undertaken a solo career. It is uncertain if the band will ever reform.

Betchadupa has had extensive experience playing with such bands as Queens of the Stone Age, Foo Fighters, Jane&#x27;s Addiction and ended the year 2001 on a high playing alongside Pearl Jam&#x27;s Eddie Vedder at the Neil Finn and Friends concert 7 Worlds Collide in Auckland, and being named Top New Act at the prestigious NZ Music Awards as well as becoming the toast of the South by Southwest Music Convention in Austin, Texas, in January 2003.

<doc id="900220" wikidata="Q7089806" url="?curid=900220" title="Omar Rezaq">
<text>Omar Mohammed Ali Rezaq ( Omar Marzouki; born 1957/1958) is a Lebanese-born Palestinian militant who is the lone surviving hijacker of EgyptAir Flight 648 in 1985. He was a member of Abu Nidal Organization. The plane was hijacked by a group of three people. The remaining two hijackers were killed, either during in-flight shooting with the plane&#x27;s sky marshal, Methad Mustafa Kamal, or after Egyptian commandos stormed the hijacked plane.

== Early life and activities ==
Rezaq gave his name as Omar Marzouki and used a Tunisian passport when boarding the plane at Athens airport, but later admitted that he is of Palestinian origin. The FBI determined that Omar Marzouki was his real name, while &quot;Omar Mohammed Ali Rezaq&quot; was an alias, as its initials (O.M.A.R.) made the name easy to remember.

During hours of negotiations while the plane was on the ground at Luqa airport in Malta, five passengers were shot, three of whom survived. On 24 November 1985, Egyptian commandos set explosives that ignited a fire, suffocating many of the passengers. Rezaq was wounded in a subsequent shootout (his left lung was pierced by a bullet and attacked with a hatchet by the pilot), but recovered and was arraigned in a Maltese court on 12 December 1986. The preliminary inquiry lasted until 3 April 1987, and on 2 November 1988, Rezaq pleaded guilty to seven of the nine charges against him. These were the illegal arrest of crew and passengers, the deaths of Nitzan Mendelson and Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp, the attempted killings of Methad Mustafa Kamal, Patrick Scott Baker, Jacqueline Nink Pflug and Tamar Artzi, and the illegal possession of arms and explosives. The first two charges were later withdrawn. Rezaq was sentenced to the maximum 25 years&#x27; imprisonment, less the years and months he had already spent in prison. On appeal, the sentence was confirmed on 20 April 1989.

Rezaq served only seven years in Malta and was released. As a free man under an assumed name, he went to Accra, Ghana where, at the request of the American Embassy Regional Security Officer Jerald H. Barnes, he was detained by the Ghana government and remained there until July 1993.

== Travel to Nigeria ==
Ghanaian authorities did not give Rezaq to the United States but told them that he planned to go to Nigeria. Rezaq flew to Lagos in July 1993; U.S. intelligence officials were on board his flight to monitor him. He was arrested and underwent extraordinary rendition by members of the DSS, who flew him to the U.S. Rezaq&#x27;s arrest was the result of an agreement between the governments of the United States and Nigeria. When Rezaq arrived at the airport, Nigerian officials denied him entry since he did not have a passport, something they knew beforehand, and placed him on the first aircraft departing Nigeria, a Gulfstream IV leased by the U.S. government. FBI agents arrested him, fingerprinted him, and flew back to the U.S.

On 19 July 1996, after a month-long trial in Washington, D.C., Rezaq was sentenced to life in prison on a single count of air piracy. Although air piracy resulting in death is a capital offense under federal law, Attorney General Janet Reno had declined to seek the death penalty.

== Later life ==
U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth recommended that any request for parole made after the 10-year period should be rejected. An appeal was rejected on 6 February 1998.

Omar Mohmamed Rezaq, register number 20267-016, is imprisoned at the United States Penitentiary, Marion, located in Southern Precinct, Williamson County, Illinois.

<doc id="900222" wikidata="Q204854" url="?curid=900222" title="Premiere">
<text>A premiere, also spelled première, (from , ) is the (first public presentation) of a work, i.e. play, film, dance, musical composition, or even a performer in that work.

==History==
Raymond F. Betts attributes the introduction of the film premiere to showman Sid Grauman, who founded Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. The first ever Hollywood premiere was for the 1922 film &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, starring Douglas Fairbanks, in front of the Egyptian Theatre. By the late 1920s the red carpet had become synonymous with film premieres.

==Classification==
There are a number of different types:

A single work will often have many premieres. For example, in film, the 2019 United States movie &quot;Aladdin&quot; held its world premiere at the Grand Rex in Paris, France, on 8 May 2019, its first regional premiere in Jordan on 13 May 2019, and its United States premiere on 24 May 2019. Likewise, in music, Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 received its world premiere in the Theater am Kärntnertor in Vienna on 7 May 1824, and subsequently received a premiere in England at the Argyll Rooms in London on 21 March 1825.

When a work originates in a country that speaks a different language from that in which it is receiving its premiere, it is possible to have two premieres for the same work, e.g., the French-language version of the play &quot;The Maids&quot; by Jean Genet received its British premiere (which was also its world premiere) in 1952, and subsequently its English-language premiere in Britain in 1956.

==Festivals==
===Significance of a premiere===
The type of premiers that a work receives will impact on how the work is treated by festivals, including the categorization of the work in screening sessions, e.g. Fantastic Fest, and even as the basis of its submission requirements, e.g. Sundance Film Festival eligibility rules require that United States feature films, both narrative and documentary, have retained their world premier status, whilst international feature films, both narrative and documentary, have retained the international premiere status.

Premiering at a film festival has been used to gain publicity for a film, even without a distributor already in place, and can even allow last minuting editing. Director Alex Winter said, of film festival premiers, &quot;It helps me get a sense of what my work is or isn&#x27;t communicating. We&#x27;ve often made little tweaks and changes after we&#x27;ve premiered it at a few film festivals.&quot;

===Online premieres===
Concerns existed about online premieres, when in 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, festivals had to become either partially online, e.g. SXSW and Tribeca, or fully online, e.g. , Visions du Reel. Director Alex Winter even went so far as to pull his documentary &quot;Zappa&quot; out of both SXSW and CPH:DOX rather than let the film premiere there, saying &quot;Our main concern was sales. Being online with these festivals would be the equivalent of a streaming distribution deal.&quot;

On 29 May 2020, upon the cancellation of a number festivals, including the Tribeca Film Festival, an International film festival called We Are One was organised where films were globally streamed, via YouTube, in an event containing 13 world premieres, 31 online premieres, and 5 international online premiers. Director &#x27;, who reluctantly kept her film &#x27; in for an online premier at We Are One said &quot;At first, your automatic feeling is, &#x27;No, I don&#x27;t want to do that, ... I felt distressed because this would be the first time I would show an audience my film, so I was upset that it (would have to) be online.&quot; but said she relented as &quot;I was observing (the Doha Film Institute&#x27;s Qumra event) online, and it was a good experience. I spoke to many programmers and professionals, and little by little, I understood we are all in the same situation and times are so uncertain that if I decided to say &#x27;no,&#x27; I wouldn&#x27;t know what would happen next with the film.&quot;

Fionnuala Halligan of &quot;Screen Daily&quot; questioned the legitimacy of the festivals without physically screened premiers, saying &quot;Is premiere status demanded by A-list festivals still valid, and if not world, then national or international, or online – how much do they matter in the time of Covid?&quot; On the complications of incorporating online premiers during the new online reformatting of festivals, Halligan said that another burning question was &quot;Would a geo-locked online premiere at a smaller festival jeopardise a filmmaker&#x27;s chances for showing their &quot;international premiere&quot; at another, perhaps larger, more covetable event (for which the selection hasn&#x27;t yet been announced)?&quot;

<text>Epimedium, also known as barrenwort, bishop&#x27;s hat, fairy wings, horny goat weed, or yin yang huo (), is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. The majority of the species are endemic to China, with smaller numbers elsewhere in Asia, and a few in the Mediterranean region.

&quot;Epimedium&quot; species are deciduous or evergreen hardy perennials. The majority have four-parted &quot;spider-like&quot; flowers in spring.

The species used as a dietary supplement is &quot;Epimedium grandiflorum&quot;. It contains icariin, which is a weak PDE5 inhibitor, &quot;in vitro&quot;. Its clinical effects are unknown. While there is little clinical evidence to date, as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil – sold under the brand names Viagra, Levitra and Cialis – are all based on (stronger) PDE5 inhibitory action, it is thought to have erectogenic properties and is found in some men&#x27;s sexual health supplements.

==Description==

Species of &quot;Epimedium&quot; are herbaceous perennials, growing from an underground rhizome. Their growth habits are somewhat variable. Some have solitary stems, others have a &quot;tufted&quot; habit, with multiple stems growing close together. There may be several leaves to a stem or the leaves may be solitary, produced from the base of the plant. Individual leaves are generally compound, often with three leaflets, but also with more. Leaflets usually have spiny margins. The leaves may be annual, making the plant deciduous, or longer lasting, so that the plant is evergreen. The inflorescence is an open raceme or panicle, the number of flowers varying by species.

Individual flowers have parts in fours. There are four smaller outer sepals, usually greenish and shed when the flower opens. Moving inwards, these are followed by four larger petal-like inner sepals, often brightly coloured. Inside the sepals are four true petals. These may be small and flat, but often have a complex shape including a nectar-producing &quot;spur&quot; that may be longer than the sepals. There are four stamens.

One of the common names for the genus, bishop&#x27;s hat, arises from the shape of the flowers, particularly where the spurs are longer than the sepals.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was given its name by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, in describing the European species &quot;E. alpinum&quot;. The name is a Latinized version of a Greek name for an unidentifiable plant, &quot;epimedion&quot;, that is mentioned in Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; (xxvii.57). The meaning of the original name is unclear.

; Accepted species (65)

===Hybrids===
Some artificial hybrids are cultivated in gardens. These include:

*&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;cantabrigiense&quot; , hybrid between &quot;E. alpinum&quot; and &quot;E. pubigerum&quot;
*&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;perralchicum&quot; , hybrid between &quot;E. perralderianum&quot; and &quot;E. pinnatum&quot; subsp. &quot;colchicum&quot;
*&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;rubrum&quot; , hybrid between &quot;E. alpinum&quot; and &quot;E. grandiflorum&quot;
*&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;versicolor&quot; , hybrid between &quot;E. grandiflorum&quot; and &quot;E. pinnatum&quot; subsp. &quot;colchicum&quot;
*&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;warleyense&quot; , hybrid between &quot;E. alpinum&quot; and &quot;E. pinnatum&quot; subsp. &quot;colchicum&quot;
*&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;youngianum&quot; , hybrid between &quot;E. diphyllum&quot; and &quot;E. grandiflorum&quot;

==Cultivation==
Some varieties and hybrids have been in Western cultivation for the last 100 to 150 years. There is now a wide array of new Chinese species being cultivated in the West, many of which have only recently been discovered, and some of which have yet to be named. There are also many older Japanese hybrids and forms, extending the boundaries of the genus in cultivation. The majority of the Chinese species have not been fully tested for hardiness nor indeed for any other aspect of their culture. The initial assumption that the plants would only thrive where their native conditions could be closely replicated have proven to be overly cautious, as most varieties are proving extraordinarily amenable to general garden and container cultivation.

The cultivar &#x27;Amber Queen&#x27; is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Propagation===
While they can be successfully propagated in early spring, epimediums are best divided in late summer, with the aim of promoting rapid re-growth of roots and shoots before the onset of winter. Several breeders (in particular Darrell Diano Probst, Tim Branney &amp; Robin White) have also undertaken their own hybridization programmes with the genus. Various new nursery selections are gradually appearing in the horticulture trade, the best of which extend the colour and shape range of the flowers available to the gardener.

== Chemistry ==
&quot;Epimedium wushanense&quot; contains a number of flavonoids. 37 compounds were characterized from the underground and aerial parts of the plant. Among them, 28 compounds were prenylflavonoids. The predominant flavonoid, epimedin C, ranged from 1.4 to 5.1% in aerial parts and 1.0 to 2.8% in underground parts.

<text>Geoffrey Noel Crombie (born 17 April 1953) is a New Zealand percussionist and former member of the band Split Enz. He fulfilled multiple roles including costume and hair designer, singer, album cover designer, and music video director. Prior to Split Enz, Crombie worked as a postal assistant and was also an artist. He attended Mana College and then moved to Auckland to study art at Elam School of Fine Arts.

For the album &quot;Time and Tide&quot;, Crombie took over the role of drummer, though a year later returned to percussion, with Paul Hester becoming Split Enz&#x27;s drummer. He is particularly remembered for playing spoon solos during Split Enz live shows.

After Split Enz disbanded, Noel formed the band Schnell Fenster with Phil Judd, Eddie Rayner and Nigel Griggs (all Split Enz alumni), and Michael den Elzen. Rayner left before the first album was released.

In 1988 the members of Schnell Fenster collaborated with Wendy Matthews, Michael Harris, Louis McManus, Vika Bull and Lisa Edwards under the name &#x27;Noel&#x27;s Cowards&#x27; for the movie &quot;Rikky and Pete&quot;.

Crombie has released one solo single, &quot;My Voice Keeps Changing on Me&quot;, in 1983 while Split Enz took a break. Tim Finn was the only other band member to have a solo release during this break. According to Crombie he had to either release the single or pay for the studio time.

In 1996, Crombie assisted Crowded House by designing the stage set design for their final concert, &quot;Farewell to the World&quot; at the Sydney Opera House.

Crombie lives with his wife Sally whom he works with as a freelance designer. They designed the set for ABC-TV&#x27;s musical quiz program &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;.

<text>Book TV is the name given to weekend programming on the American cable network C-SPAN2, which airs from 8 a.m. Eastern Time Sunday morning to 8 a.m. Eastern Time Monday morning each week. The 24-hour block of programming is focused on non-fiction books and authors, featuring programs in the format of interviews with authors as well as live coverage of book events from around the country. &quot;Book TV&quot; debuted on C-SPAN2 on September 12, 1998.

While the primary mission of C-SPAN2 is live coverage of the United States Senate, &quot;Book TV&quot; programs are sometimes also scheduled to air during the week when the Senate is not in session.

==Background and production==
&quot;Book TV&quot; covers established and upcoming nonfiction authors, mainly in the subject areas of history, biography and public affairs. Approximately 2,000 authors are featured annually, and in one year &quot;Book TV&quot; may cover as many as 60,000 titles. The network&#x27;s production budget for &quot;Book TV&quot; is approximately $600,000 per year.

Like C-SPAN&#x27;s weekly coverage of government affairs, the &quot;Book TV&quot; the production style is &quot;no frills&quot;, focusing on panel discussions, book signings and visits to bookstores. &quot;Book TV&quot;&#x27;s coverage is weighted toward government, politics and history, in line with C-SPAN&#x27;s weekly programming. However, the topics represented vary, ranging from the genealogy of Greek mythology to the “use and abuse” of the English language. While C-SPAN does not usually cover narrative fiction due to its nonfiction mission, it may occasionally be featured, as when Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer appeared in 1999 to talk about their novels.

&quot;Book TV&quot; interviews are characterized by a focus on the author, rather than the host, and an unstructured format allowing the author to guide the discussion. As with other C-SPAN programming, viewer call-ins are featured, allowing writers to hear directly from their readers.

==Programming==
The majority of the &quot;Book TV&quot; weekly lineup is coverage of author lectures, book signings, and seminars. Several weekends each year, &quot;Book TV&quot; features live coverage of major regional book fairs and festivals. There are also several regularly scheduled series: &quot;After Words&quot;, an interview show conducted by guest hosts familiar with the author&#x27;s subject; and &quot;Booknotes&quot; programs from 1989 to 2004, under the title &quot;Encore Booknotes&quot;.

A monthly series on &quot;Book TV&quot; is &quot;In Depth&quot;, a two-hour one-on-one interview covering an author&#x27;s entire body of work. &quot;In Depth&quot; is televised live with viewer calls on the first Sunday of each month at 12 p.m. &quot;In Depth&quot; occasionally also includes video of the featured writer at their home or office, where they talk about how they do their research and writing.

In addition to C-SPAN2, &quot;Book TV&quot; can also be viewed via live streaming on the C-SPAN website, while an iPhone app streams the audio portion only. All past &quot;Book TV&quot; coverage of nonfiction authors is archived at the C-SPAN Video Library.

==History==
The &quot;Book TV&quot; weekend-long programming schedule grew out of the success of C-SPAN&#x27;s long-running &quot;Booknotes&quot; series, which since 1989 was the only avenue for coverage of nonfiction books and authors on the C-SPAN networks. C-SPAN believes that coverage of nonfiction books complements its primary public affairs mission and since &quot;Booknotes&quot; could only feature 52 books per year, when the network wished to increase its coverage of nonfiction books, &quot;Book TV&quot; on C-SPAN2 was the solution.

The inspiration for coverage of nonfiction books on the C-SPAN networks originated with C-SPAN founder Brian Lamb&#x27;s frustration with the lack of attention that authors receive on television, which led initially to the creation of the author interview program &quot;Booknotes&quot;. As Lamb related in a 2003 interview, &quot;It used to drive me absolutely crazy when an author would appear on a talk show and come and go before I even had a chance to determine if I wanted to read the book.&quot;

In 2010, &quot;Book TV&quot; received the Phillis Wheatley Award from the organizers of New York&#x27;s Harlem Book Fair. The award, named for the first published African-American female writer, is given for literary work and advocacy that &quot;transcends boundaries, race and perception&quot;. According to book fair founder Max Rodriguez, &quot;Book TV&quot; was honored for giving a voice to African-American literature in a manner unlike other television media outlets.

<text>Pound for pound is a ranking used in combat sports, such as boxing, wrestling, or mixed martial arts, adjusted to compensate for weight class. As fighters in different weight classes do not compete directly, determining the best fighter pound for pound requires subjective judgment, and ratings hence vary.

==Boxing==
In boxing, the term was historically associated with fighters such as Benny Leonard and Sugar Ray Robinson who were widely considered to be the most skilled fighters of their day, to distinguish them from the generally more popular (and better compensated) heavyweight champions. Since 1990, &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine has maintained a pound for pound ranking of fighters.

==Mixed martial arts==

Some mixed martial arts promotions have pound-for-pound rankings, including Ultimate Fighting Championship since 2013, ONE Championship since 2020, and Bellator MMA since 2021. There are also multiple unofficial MMA pound-for-pound rankings, including by ESPN.com, Sherdog, Fight Matrix, MMA Fighting and Tapology.

==Kickboxing / Muay Thai==

ONE Championship publishes pound-for-pound rankings for kickboxing and Muay Thai since 2020. Combat Press and Beyond Kickboxing also publish pound-for-pound rankings for kickboxing.

<text>The National Front for the Liberation of Angola (; abbreviated FNLA) is a political party and former militant organisation that fought for Angolan independence from Portugal in the war of independence, under the leadership of Holden Roberto.

Founded in 1954 as the União dos Povos do Norte de Angola guerrilla movement, it was known after 1959 as the União dos Povos de Angola (UPA) guerrilla movement, and from 1961 as the FNLA guerrilla movement.

Ahead of the first multiparty elections in 1992, the FNLA was reorganized as a political party. The FNLA received 2.4% of the votes and had five Members of Parliament elected. In the 2008 parliamentary election, the FNLA received 1.11% of the vote, winning three out of 220 seats.

== History ==
===Origin===
In 1954, the United People of Northern Angola (UPNA) was formed as a separatist movement for the Bakongo tribe who wished to re-establish its 16th-century feudal kingdom but was also a protest movement against forced labour. Holden Roberto was to be the king of that land. 

By 1958, the organisation&#x27;s name had been changed to the &quot;União das Populações de Angola&quot; (UPA) under Holden Roberto who came from São Salvador, Bakongo, Northern Angola with the newly named organisation described as an ethnic political movement. In March 1961, the UPA began an uprising in the north massacring thousands of white settlers and their servants, most of the Bailundo southern ethnicity, &quot;assimilados&quot;, African Catholics and tribal members other than the Bakongo tribe, men, women and children. The Portuguese government responded by sending soldiers to Angola and more than 50,000 people died in the violence by the end of 1961. It was said more than a million refugees fled the north of Angola for Zaire. 

In an attempt to become a national political movement, it merged with the &quot;Partido Democratico de Angola&quot; (PDA) to form the &quot;Frente Nacional de Libertação de Angola&quot; (FNLA). By February 1962, the FNLA had merged into an organisation called the Angolan Revolutionary Government in Exile (GRAE) with Roberto as its President and Jonas Savimbi as its foreign minister, based in Kinshasa, Zaire. It was recognised by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) as Angola&#x27;s only freedom movement until 1971. Its core membership were Angolan refugees and expatriates in Zaire.

===Foreign aid===
The United States government began aiding the FNLA in 1961 during the Kennedy administration and rerouted one-third of its official aid to Zaire to the FNLA and UNITA organisations. Over the course of many years, the governments of Algeria, Tunisia, West Germany, Ghana, Israel, France, Romania, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, South Africa, the United States, Zaire, and Liberia actively supported and aided the FNLA. The French government supplied men and loaned one million pounds sterling without interest. The Israeli government gave aid to the FNLA between 1963 and 1969. Holden Roberto visited Israel during the 1960s, and FNLA members were sent to Israel for training. During the 1970s, the Israeli government shipped arms to the FNLA through Zaire. The People&#x27;s Republic of China supplied the FNLA with military equipment and at least 112 military advisers in 1974.

===Break up of GRAE===
By July 1964, GRAE&#x27;s right as the only liberation movement was challenged with the resignation of the Congolese Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula, their backer, and the departure of Jonas Savimbi, who went on to form his own liberation movement UNITA because of Roberto&#x27;s dictatorial leadership, unwillingness to accept non-western support and a lack of a political program. Roberto saw off a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in June 1965 by his defence minister and in November of the same year, his brother-in-law, Mobutu Sese Seko, took control of the Congo (later Zaire) in a coup. But by 1968, GRAE&#x27;s unity had begun to disintegrate.

===Nixon&#x27;s policy to Angola===
On President Richard Nixon, assuming office in 1969, he ordered a review of the United States policy towards Angola as well as South Africa and Rhodesia. In January 1970, National Security Council Study Memorandum 39 was adopted, which acknowledged that the white regimes in those countries should not be politically and economically isolated and that engaging them was the best means of achieving changes in their systems. This meant a reduction in aid to the FNLA.

===Coup in Portugal===
In late 1972, the FNLA concluded a ceasefire with the MPLA, which was being attacked by the former in northwest Angola and by the Portuguese in the northeast. A condition of the ceasefire was it needed more arms as it had no US aid apart from Roberto&#x27;s CIA retainer, and Neto spoke to the Tanzanians who interceded with the Chinese government. After all groups met the Chinese, the FNLA received military aid and training from early 1973 until the fall of 1974, and then only diplomatic aid thereafter. In April 1974, a military coup occurred in Portugal with a later announcement of future independence for its colonies which began the process by the FNLA, MPLA and UNITA in attempting to strengthen their reach throughout Angola and resulted in conflict amongst each other. The Romanian government delivered arms to the FNLA in August 1974. In August 1974, the Portuguese Angolan government had proposed a two-year plan for independence with the three groups and white settlers forming a coalition government but this was rejected outright. In order to end the conflict amongst the groups, individual ceasefires were arranged between the groups and the Portuguese Angolan Military Council, with the FNLA signing on 15 October 1974 that allowed it and the other three liberation parties to set up political offices in Luanda. By 25 November 1974, a ceasefire was concluded between the FNLA and UNITA and with the MPLA on 18 December.

===Ford&#x27;s policy to Angola===
When Gerald Ford assumed the presidency in August 1974, the new US foreign policy moved away from the National Security Council Study Memorandum 39 to one of support for black rule in Angola as well as passive support for the white rule and so minimal aid was returned to the FNLA. But by November 1974, the US decided they did not want a future government dominated by the pro-Soviet MPLA so the CIA funded the FNLA with $300,000 to help it achieve that objective.

===Africa&#x27;s attempt to mediate===
The increasing violence resulted in the gathering of the FNLA and the other two parties in Mombasa, Kenya, from 3–5 January 1975 by the invitation of President Jomo Kenyatta. The object of the meeting was to unite the parties and find common ground prior to the independence talks in Portugal later that month. Roberto speaking on behalf of all, declared an accord had been reached and that all parties had overcome their differences and had agreed firstly to a just and democratic society without ethnic discrimination; agreeing to a transitional government, armed forces and civil service and lastly to co-operate in the country&#x27;s decolonisation and defence. The FNLA and the other parties met in Portimao, Portugal on 10 January 1975 and resulted in the formation of the Alvor Agreement, signed on 15 January 1975, which would grant Angola independence from Portugal on 11 November, ending the war of independence. The plan also called for a coalition government and a united army.

===Transitional government&#x27;s failure===
Within 24 hours of the Alvor Agreement, fighting broke out in Luanda amongst the FNLA and MPLA with further violence on 23 March when the MPLAs Lopo do Nascimento was subject to an assassination attempt by the FNLA. The transitional government&#x27;s failure to work was also said to be the result of a lack of interest by the Portuguese government in Angola as it tackled a failed counter-coup in Lisbon by General Spinola and the lack of will of the Portuguese troops to serve in Angola and end the violence between the MPLA and FNLA. The final straw was the dismissal in August of the Portuguese High Commissioner Antonio da Silva Cardoso whose attempt to reign in the MPLA had the support of the FNLA. The FNLA saw its only alternative as a military one after having been expelled from Luanda. On 29 August 1975, the Alvor Agreement was suspended by Portugal except for independence in November, and withdrawal of its troops that signal an escalation of violence for the control of Angola prior to that date.

===US covert aid to the FNLA increases===
The US government did not believe the Portuguese plan would work and that the MPLA would seize power and install a Soviet-backed regime in power. In late January 1975, the 40 Committee, part of the executive branch of the US government, met and reviewed a proposal from the CIA to fund the FNLA with $300,000 and UNITA, $100,000. The committee approved the funding for the FNLA but not for UNITA. The money was to be used by the FNLA to purchase newspapers and radio stations. In addition to the money, the US supplied weapons to Zaire which, in turn, passed them on to the FNLA, and also supplied several thousand troops. With this funding, Roberto believed any future coalition could be abandoned and in doing so the Soviet Union would begin to increase its aid to the MPLA. By June 1975, the CIA requested a meeting with the 40 Committee in which it proposed increased aid for the FNLA. A decision was not made for a month as the U.S. National Security Council (NSC) and U.S. State Department wished to consider the proposal. Assistant Secretary of State Nathaniel Davies objected to further aid, as he believed it would not help the FNLA to become as militarily strong as the MPLA except with massive amounts of money; escalate Soviet and Cuban involvement and feared South Africa would intervene and this would have negative diplomatic connotations for the United States in Africa, so the only option was a diplomatic solution. Henry Kissinger ensured that the NSC viewpoint prevailed and that aid, not diplomacy could prevent an MPLA win so aid of $14 million was approved for the FNLA and UNITA in July and that increased to $25 million in August and reached $32 million by September. The assistance became known as Operation IA Feature. The CIAs covert plan begun sending supplies to the FNLA through Zaire and Zambia and was able to supply by November 1975, 12 APC, 50 SAMs, 1000 mortars, 50,000 rifles and machine guns, 100,000 grenades, 25 million rounds of ammunition, 60 trucks, trailers, boats, radios, spare parts, medicine and food with training by retired US military advisors and five spotter planes as well as mercenaries. The CIA appointed John Stockwell to manage the Angolan Task Force but found that many members of the CIA doubted the FNLAs ability to beat the MPLA and this was confirmed when he visited Angola and discovered the lack of political support for the organisation and also feared any entry of South African forces in Angola would undermine the United States diplomatically in Africa.

===South Africans enter the civil war===
On the pretext of attacks around the Calueque hydroelectric facility, the South Africans army entered Angola to defend its interests in the facility and this action developed into Operation Savannah to assist the FNLA and UNITA to gain as much control of southern and central Angola prior to independence day in November. The US appeared to give the green light for the South Africans covert invasion but this soon changed as their involvement became public knowledge, the US distanced themselves. The South Africans advanced close to Luanda from the south while a small force of South African artillery and advisors supported the FNLA in the north.

===FNLA attacks Luanda===
Without the control of Luanda on independence day, Roberto saw that the FNLA&#x27;s international legitimacy would be in doubt. The only &#x27;suitable&#x27; attack on Luanda was from the north through Quifangondo. Attacks were carried out by the FNLA on 5 and 8 November 1975 but were repulsed each time by the MPLA. With independence day looming on 11 November 1975, Roberto gave the final order to attack Quifangondo on 10 November unaware that the Cubans had reinforced the positions with troops and new Soviet equipment. Roberto claimed the South African were sending men to help him while the South Africans claimed they warned against a frontal assault but whatever the real story was, the FNLA&#x27;s final assault on what became known as the Battle of Quifangondo failed disastrously. The MPLA retained Luanda, and Angola gained independence from the Portuguese High Commissioner with Neto declaring the People&#x27;s Republic of Angola. The FNLA continued its fight inside Angola for another four months.

===US aid ceases===
On 6 November 1975, CIA Director William Colby appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and briefed them that his organisation had not informed the committee fully on its activities in Angola and the following day, the &quot;New York Times&quot; released the testimony to the world. By 26 November, Nigeria, against U.S. wishes, had recognised the MPLA government and soon convinced twenty-two other African nations to recognise them too. By December, President Ford and Kissinger decided that the aid to the opposition parties should not be abandoned and the CIA was ordered to draw up further aid plans which would need Senate approval but meanwhile, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee drew up the Clark Amendment, named after Senator Dick Clark, after his visit to Angola. He concluded that the White House and CIA had lied about their involvement and that the US effort was responsible for dragging the Cubans and South Africans into the country&#x27;s conflict. The State Department and CIA, unable to stay on message, were unable to convince the House or Senate and on 19 December 1975, the Clark Amendment passed the Senate and covert US aid in Angola ended with the House following suit on 27 January 1976.

===FNLA retreats from Angola===
The MPLA and Cubans maintained the initiative in Northern Angola after the defeat of the FNLA at Quifangondo with the advances on Caxito and the latter&#x27;s airbases at Camabatela and Negage. Caxito fell on 27 December 1975 and the FNLAs main airbase at Camabatela was captured on 1 January and Negage on 3 January while their capital at Carmona fell on 4 January and so the FNLA rout began in earnest. By early 1976, defeated by the MPLA, the FNLA began retreating, looting villages in northern Angola, as they headed for the Zairian border. On 11 January 1976, FAPLA and the Cubans captured Ambriz and Ambrizete from the FNLA and then advanced on their headquarters at São Salvador its route defended by foreign mercenaries under Colonel Callan and elements of the FNLA. With Colonel Callan committing atrocities in the fighting including against his own men he was stripped of his command in the FNLA and so mercenary support which had begun the previous December ended and São Salvador was captured on 15 February 1976. The South Africans withdrew from Angola on 27 March 1976 after receiving guarantees from Angola and United Nations on the safety of the installations at the Calueque hydroelectric facility so ending Operation Savannah. Elements of the FNLA that had taken part as South African army&#x27;s Task Force Zulu, was reformed into 32 Battalion.

===Military demise of the FNLA===
On 29 February 1976, the Angolan President Agostinho Neto and Zairian President Mobuto Sese Seko met in Brazzaville to sign a non-aggression pact which was meant to see the end of Angola&#x27;s support for Katangese rebels in their country while the Zairians promised to expel both the FNLA and UNITA from bases in Zaire but the deal did not hold and the Shaba I invasion occurred in March 1977. The Shaba II invasion of the Zairian Shaba Province in May 1978, by separatists based in eastern Angola, was the beginning of the end for the FNLA based in Zaire. The Angolan President Neto and Zairian President Mobuto Sese Seko met again in Brazzaville during June 1978 where a reconciliation pact was signed between the two countries. The result of this pact saw Holden Roberto exiled to Gabon by the Zairian President in November 1979 while he was in France for medical treatment. Elements of the FNLA continued the fight after Roberto left, now called the FNLA-COMIRA (Angolan Military Resistance Committee) but ceased to exist by 1983.

<text>Nigel Griggs (born 18 August 1949) is an English musician. He is perhaps best known for having played bass guitar in the band Split Enz. He is the brother of Paul Griggs from the 1970s vocal group Guys &#x27;n&#x27; Dolls.

==Biography==
A professional musician since 1963, Griggs has played in a number of bands, notably The Cortinas and Octopus, 1963–1971, with his brother Paul Griggs.

Nigel Griggs joined Split Enz in 1977 at the same time Neil Finn did, at the recommendation of the drummer at that time and close friend of Griggs, Malcolm Green. Griggs stayed with the Enz until their 1984 split. His songwriting credits with the band include &quot;Dirty Creature&quot;, co-written with Neil Finn and Tim Finn.

After the Enz split, Griggs joined Enz drummer Noel Crombie, Enz keyboardist Eddie Rayner, Split Enz founder Phil Judd and the guitarist Michael den Elzen in the band Schnell Fenster.

In 1996, when Crowded House split up and released their greatest hits album &quot;Recurring Dream&quot;, frontman Neil Finn approached Griggs to put together a collection of the band&#x27;s greatest live performances, to append selected copies of &quot;Recurring Dream&quot;.

In 2002, Griggs released a solo album, &quot;Sleeper&quot;, through the Split Enz fanclub, Frenz of the Enz.

Griggs has participated in most of Split Enz&#x27;s reunions.

<doc id="900252" wikidata="Q5268920" url="?curid=900252" title="Dhananjoy Chatterjee">
<text>Dhananjoy Chatterjee (14 August 1965 – 14 August 2004) was the first person who was judicially executed in India in the 21st century for murder. The execution by hanging took place in Alipore Jail, Kolkata, on 14 August 2004. He was charged in 1990 for the crimes of rape and murder of Hetal Parekh, an 18-year-old school-girl.

This was the first hanging in West Bengal since 21 August 1991 at Alipore Jail.

== Personal life ==
Dhananjoy was born in Kuludihi, West Bengal, India, and worked as a security guard in Kolkata. He had married Purnima just eight months before he was arrested in the Hetal Parekh case by falsely claiming he was working in the Border Security Force when he was only a security guard. Purnima works as an anganwadi worker with a salary of Rs 1,200 per month and after his execution lives with her parents. Even after the execution of her husband she has refused to remarry.

== Case details ==

Hetal Parekh was a student of Welland Gouldsmith School at Bowbazar, Kolkata. She used to live with her parents and elder brother in a third floor flat of Anand Apartments in Bhawanipore. The Parekhs moved into this flat in 1987. Dhananjoy was a security guard of this agency. He had worked in that building for about three years.

On 5 March 1990, Dhananjoy performed security duty during the morning shift (6 am to 2 pm). Hetal left for her ICSE examination at about 7:30 am. After the examination, she returned home. In the afternoon, only Hetal and her mother were there in the flat.

Hetal&#x27;s mother went to visit a temple in the vicinities in the afternoon. After returning from the temple, she being unable to enter her home, despite repeated knocking, asked some servants of other flats to break the door open. Hetal was found lying dead near the door connecting the living room with the Parekh couple&#x27;s bedroom with blood stains on her face and on the floor. Two local doctors examined Hetal and declared her dead.

Dhananjoy was not seen in the area after the murder had been discovered. He became the focal point of police investigations. He was eventually arrested by the police from his village home at Kuludihi near Chhatna, Bankura, in the early hours of 12 May 1990.

The case was investigated by the Detective Department of Kolkata Police. The chargesheet prepared by the police included the charges of rape, murder and the theft of a wrist watch. The trial took place in the second court of the Additional Sessions Judge at Alipore. Since there was no direct witness to the murder, the case hinged on circumstantial evidence only. After the sessions court convicted Dhananjoy of all the offenses and sentenced him to death, the High Court at Calcutta and the Supreme Court of India upheld the conviction and the death sentence. The Supreme Court convicted Dhananjoy and regarded the crime as a heinous combination of offenses, aggravated by the fact that as a security guard Dhananjoy had been in charge of the victim&#x27;s safety—enough to make it belong to the &quot;rarest of rare&quot; category of crimes&quot;-&quot;warranting a death sentence.

=== Claims of innocence ===
Dhananjoy had claimed repeatedly during his trial that he was completely innocent and that he had nothing to do with the murder, rape or theft. He maintained his stance till the day of his execution.

== Controversies ==
Some academics and lawyers have questioned the validity of the death sentence and the proceedings of the trial. Professors from ISI Kolkata—Debasish Sengupta, Probal Chaudhuri and Paramesh Goswami have conducted investigative journalism on the issue; publishing the findings in a book titled &quot;Adalat-Media-Samaj Ebaṃ Dhananjayer Fansi&quot; (Court-Media-Society and The Hanging of Dhananjoy). It criticized the handling of the case, the media-trial and faulted the delivered judgement.

== Execution ==
Dhananjoy&#x27;s execution was scheduled on 25 June 2004. It was stayed after his family petitioned the Supreme Court of India, and filed a mercy plea with the then President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. On 26 June 2004, a campaign to ensure Dhananjoy&#x27;s hanging was initiated. Meera Bhattacharjee, wife of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee the then Chief Minister of West Bengal, led the campaign. Several individuals and human rights groups came forward to oppose the execution. The mercy plea was finally rejected by the president on 4 August 2004.

The date of Dhananjoy&#x27;s execution was fixed at a high-level meeting at the office of Jail Minister Biswanath Chowdhury. He was executed on 14th August 2004.

The family refused to claim his body and it was later cremated.

== Media ==
Dhananjay, a film based on the events of the case was released on 11 August 2017 regionally and on Amazon Prime. The film was directed by Arindam Sil, and cast Anirban Bhattacharya and Mimi Chakraborty in the lead roles. The film is based on the book &quot;&quot;Adalat-Media-Samaj Ebong Dhananjayer Fashi&quot;. The film also received objection from Dhananjay&#x27;s family after initially agreeing with the development of the project

<text>Hans Conrad Schumann, also known as Konrad Schumann (28 March 1942 – 20 June 1998), was an East German Bereitschaftspolizist who escaped to West Germany during the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.

==Early life==
Born in Zschochau (now part of Jahnatal) during World War II, Schumann enlisted in the East German Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften (Paramilitary Unit of the Volkspolizei) following his 18th birthday. After three months of training in Dresden, he was posted to a non-commissioned officers&#x27; college in Potsdam, after which he volunteered for service in Berlin.

==Escape to West Germany==

On 15 August 1961, 19-year-old Schumann was sent to the corner of Ruppiner Straße and Bernauer Straße to guard what would become the Berlin Wall on its third day of construction. Schumann and his unit arrived at 4:30 a.m., where an officer ordered them to &quot;take control and protect the border from the enemies of socialism.&quot; Schumann later recalled: &quot;We stood around looking pretty stupid at first. Nobody had told us how that&#x27;s done: taking control of a border.&quot; At the time, the barrier was a single coil of concertina wire. 

Throughout the morning, Schumann became distressed by West Berlin residents shouting at him: &quot;You pigs!&quot; &quot;You traitors!&quot; &quot;You concentration camp guards!&quot; as he stood at his post. Schumann became further upset when a young woman in East Berlin passed a bouquet of flowers over the top of the wire to her mother in West Berlin. The young woman apologized to her mother for not being able to visit, then motioned to Schumann: &quot;Those [people] over there, they won&#x27;t let me cross anymore.&quot; Schumann suddenly realized he would be spending the rest of his life keeping his fellow citizens imprisoned, and he would be a prisoner himself.

By noon, a large crowd of West Berlin demonstrators approached the wire at Schumann&#x27;s post, shouting various slogans, including &quot;&quot;Freiheit&quot; (Freedom).&quot; Schumann recalled: &quot;Suddenly the mass of people moved toward us like a living wall. I thought: they&#x27;re going to run over us right away. I was nervous and didn&#x27;t know what to do. I didn&#x27;t want to shoot and I wasn&#x27;t supposed to.&quot; Before Schumann was forced to act, more soldiers arrived in armored cars and pushed the crowd back with bayonets.

Over the next four hours, construction equipment and trucks loaded with concrete posts and steel plates began to arrive and unload materials to build the wall. Realizing his window of opportunity was closing, Schumann stamped on a section of wire to flatten it. West Berliners noticed, and a young man approached Schumann. &quot;Get back at once!&quot; yelled Schumann, then whispered, &quot;I&#x27;m going to jump.&quot; The young man alerted the West Berlin police, who arrived with a van. 

Schumann waited until the East German police were facing away, and at roughly 4:00 pm, quickly jumped over the barrier, dropped his PPSh-41 submachine gun, ran north on Ruppiner Straße, across Bernauer Straße, and jumped into the West Berlin police van. West German photographer Peter Leibing photographed Schumann&#x27;s escape. The photograph, entitled &quot;Leap into Freedom&quot;, quickly became an iconic image of the Cold War and was featured at the beginning of the 1982 Disney film &quot;Night Crossing&quot;. The scene, including Schumann&#x27;s preparations, was also filmed on 16 mm film from the same perspective by camera operator Dieter Hoffmann. 

Schumann moved from West Berlin to West Germany, and settled in Bavaria. In 1962, he met and married Kunigunde Gunda in Günzburg, had a son, and began a new job at a winery. Schumann subsequently worked at the Ingolstadt Audi factory until his death in 1998.

==Later life and death==

Until the fall of the Berlin Wall, Schumann feared that the Stasi would try to assassinate him. After the fall of the Wall Schumann said, &quot;Only since 9 November 1989 [the date of the fall] have I felt truly free.&quot; Even so, he continued to feel more at home in Bavaria than in his birthplace, citing old frictions with his former colleagues, and was even hesitant to visit his parents and siblings in Saxony. When he returned to East Germany after the reunification to visit his relatives, he was rejected by them. They saw him as a traitor who had abandoned his family.

On 20 June 1998, suffering from depression, he died by suicide, hanging himself in his orchard near the town of Kipfenberg in Upper Bavaria. His body was found by his wife a few hours later.

In May 2011, the photograph of Schumann&#x27;s &quot;leap into freedom&quot; was inducted into the UNESCO Memory of the World programme as part of a collection of documents on the fall of the Berlin Wall.

==Monument==

A sculpture called &quot;Mauerspringer&quot; (&quot;Walljumper&quot;) by Florian and Michael Brauer and Edward Anders can be seen close to the site of the defection, but has since been moved to the side of a building on Brunnenstraße, several meters south of Bernauer Straße.

<doc id="900259" wikidata="Q6072314" url="?curid=900259" title="Iron Arrow Honor Society">
<text>The Iron Arrow Honor Society is an honor society at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida for students, faculty, staff, and alumni. It is the highest honor that the university can bestow upon someone. 

Founded at the University of Miami in 1926, the society admits about thirty members annually, including undergraduate, School of Law and Miller School of Medicine students, alumni, and University of Miami faculty, staff, and administrators. Membership requires unanimous votes of the membership. Criteria include scholarship, leadership, character, humility, and love of alma mater.

==History==
The society was founded in 1926 as the &quot;Highest Honor Attained by Men.&quot; In 1937, Nu Kappa Tau, a separate sister organization at the university, was founded as &quot;The Highest Honor Attained by Women.&quot; In 1966, Nu Kappa Tau became affiliated with the national honor society Mortar Board, &quot;leaving Iron Arrow to carry the tradition alone.&quot;

In 1976, the federal government notified the University of Miami that it was providing significant assistance to Iron Arrow in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The university responded by having Iron Arrow move its tapping ceremony off campus and negotiated with it to accept women members. Iron Arrow, in turn, sued the federal government seeking the right to continue on campus as a male-only organization. 

In 1982, university president Edward T. Foote II wrote Iron Arrow stating that regardless of the court case&#x27;s outcome, Iron Arrow would not be allowed back on campus as a male-only organization. This rendered the court case moot before it was scheduled to be heard in 1983 by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Iron Arrow Honor Soc. v. Heckler&quot; (). 

In 1985, breaking with over fifty years of tradition, the society&#x27;s all-male membership voted to admit women and Iron Arrow was allowed back on campus.

Iron Arrow Honor Society has been the subject of two books, &quot;Iron Arrow: A History&quot; (published in 1976) and &quot;Iron Arrow: A History, Seventy-Five Years&quot; (published in 2001).

In 2022, the University of Miami&#x27;s student senate passed a resolution calling for the disaffiliation of the society from the university.

==Symbols==
The Iron Arrow Honor Society adopted Seminole Indian motifs for its symbolism, including the regalia of a Seminole-themed jacket worn as its emblem. A version of this jacket serves as the identifying logo on its website.

==Controversies==
In July 2020, Iron Arrow faced criticism from some in the University of Miami community and some Native Americans for &quot;cultural appropriation,&quot; though the Iron Arrow Honor Society is an officially sanctioned clan of the Miccosukee tribe of Florida.

<doc id="900261" wikidata="Q4358477" url="?curid=900261" title="USS Ringgold (DD-89)">
<text>USS &quot;Ringgold&quot; (DD-89) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and the interwar period. During World War II, the vessel was transferred to the Royal Navy as a named HMS &quot;Newark&quot;, being scrapped after the end of the war in 1947.

==Construction and career==

===United States Navy===
The first ship named in honor of Rear Admiral Cadwalader Ringgold, she was launched 14 April 1918 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, sponsored by Mrs. David W. Farquhar; and commissioned 14 November 1918 at Mare Island Navy Yard.

&quot;Ringgold&quot; departed Mare Island Navy Yard 18 November 1918 to join the Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. After transiting the Panama Canal, &quot;Ringgold&quot; called at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before arriving Hampton Roads, Virginia on 5 December 1918. She cruised along the U.S. east coast into 1922, operating generally out of Newport, Rhode Island, &quot;Ringgold&quot; put into Philadelphia Navy Yard 5 April 1922 where she was decommissioned 17 June 1922 and placed in reserve.

===Royal Navy===

After remaining inactive for almost two decades, &quot;Ringgold&quot; recommissioned 23 August 1940 preparatory to transfer to Britain along with 49 other old flush-deckers as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. &quot;Ringgold&quot; was formally transferred to Britain 26 November 1940 at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and renamed HMS &quot;Newark&quot; in honor of towns in both Britain and the United States. She was struck from the U.S. Navy list 8 January 1941.

Although manned initially by a Royal Canadian Navy care and maintenance party, &quot;Newark&quot; was commissioned for Royal Navy service 5 December 1940.

&quot;Newark&quot; was damaged in collision with 9 December 1940, necessitating repairs that delayed her departure for British waters. Standing out of Halifax 4 February 1941, in company with , she encountered a heavy gale and subsequently developed engine trouble. Towed back to Halifax, &quot;Newark&quot; again departed 26 February 1941 and arrived at Belfast 5 March and Plymouth, England 9 March 1941.

Assigned to the 17th Destroyer Division, &quot;Newark&quot; participated in escort duty for the 1st Minelaying Division operating in the Irish Sea and for the Iceland ferry service. She suffered minor bomb damage in an air attack at Belfast on the night of 4–5 May 1941 but resumed active duty that August. While in company with 25 August 1941, &quot;Newark&quot; was hit by a torpedo forward and had to be escorted into Belfast. &quot;Newark&quot; was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4&quot;/50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of hedgehog. Following completion of repairs in May 1942, &quot;Newark&quot; rejoined the 17th Destroyer Division. She probably damaged a German submarine 31 May 1942 while cruising south of Iceland and assisted in rescuing survivors of on 20 August 1942.

&quot;Newark&quot; was transferred to the Rosyth Escort Force during 1944, operating in the North Sea and in waters north of the British Isles on antisubmarine duty. In January 1945, she became an aircraft target ship under orders of the Rear Admiral, Northern Air Stations. &quot;Newark&quot; was scrapped at Bo&#x27;ness on 18 February 1947.

<doc id="900263" wikidata="Q5393308" url="?curid=900263" title="Buddhist temple">
<text>A Buddhist temple or Buddhist monastery is the place of worship for Buddhists, the followers of Buddhism. They include the structures called vihara, chaitya, stupa, wat and pagoda in different regions and languages. Temples in Buddhism represent the pure land or pure environment of a Buddha. Traditional Buddhist temples are designed to inspire inner and outer peace.

==Architecture==

Its architecture and structure varies from region to region. Usually, the temple consists not only of its buildings, but also the surrounding environment. The Buddhist temples are designed to symbolize five elements: fire, air, water, earth and void (space).

==India==

The design of temples in India was influenced by the idea of a place of worship as a representation of the universe. For Buddhist temple complexes one tall temple is often centrally located and surrounded by smaller temples and walls. This center surrounded by oceans, lesser mountains and a huge wall.

A Chaitya, Chaitya hall or Chaitya-griha refers to a shrine, sanctuary, temple or prayer hall in Indian religions. The term is most common in Buddhism, where it refers to a space with a stupa and a rounded apse at the end opposite the entrance, and a high roof with a rounded profile. Strictly speaking, the chaitya is the stupa itself, and the Indian buildings are chaitya halls, but this distinction is often not observed. Many of the early Chaitya were rock-cut, as in Karla caves or Ajanta.
Some of the earliest free-standing temples may have been of a circular type. Ashoka also built the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya circa 250 BCE, a circular structure, in order to protect the Bodhi tree under which the Buddha had found enlightenment. The Bairat Temple is also a round structure, which can be seen through archaeological remains. Representations of this early temple structure are found on a 100 BCE relief sculpted on the railing of the stupa at Bhārhut, as well as in Sanchi. From that period the Diamond throne remains, an almost intact slab of sandstone decorated with reliefs, which Ashoka had established at the foot of the Bodhi tree. These circular-type temples were also found in later rock-hewn caves such as Tulja Caves or Guntupalli.

==Indonesia==

Buddhism is the second oldest religion in Indonesia after Hinduism, which arrived from India around the second century. The history of Buddhism in Indonesia is closely related to the history of Hinduism, as a number of empires influenced by Indian culture were established around the same period. The oldest Buddhist archaeological site in Indonesia is arguably the Batujaya stupas complex in Karawang, West Java. The oldest relic in Batujaya was estimated to originate from the 2nd century, while the latest dated from the 12th century. Subsequently, significant numbers of Buddhist sites were found in Jambi, Palembang and Riau provinces in Sumatra, as well as in Central and East Java. The Indonesian archipelago has, over the centuries, witnessed the rise and fall of powerful Buddhist empires, such as the Sailendra dynasty, the Mataram and Srivijaya empires.

According to some Chinese source, a Chinese Buddhist monk I-tsing on his pilgrim journey to India, witnessed the powerful maritime empire of Srivijaya based on Sumatra in the 7th century. A number of Buddhist historical heritages can be found in Indonesia, including the 8th century Borobudur mandala monument and Sewu temple in Central Java, Batujaya in West Java, Muaro Jambi, Muara Takus and Bahal temple in Sumatra, and numerous of statues or inscriptions from the earlier history of Indonesian Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms.
During the era of Kediri, Singhasari and Majapahit empire, Buddhism—identified as &quot;Dharma ri Kasogatan&quot;—was acknowledged as one of kingdom&#x27;s official religions along with Hinduism. Although some of kings might favour Hinduism over another, nevertheless the harmony, toleration and even syncretism were promoted as manifested in Bhinneka Tunggal Ika national motto, coined from Kakawin Sutasoma, written by Mpu Tantular to promotes tolerance between Hindus (Shivaites) and Buddhists. The classical era of ancient Java also had produces some of the exquisite examples of Buddhist arts, such as the statue of Prajnaparamita and the statue of Buddha Vairochana and Boddhisttva Padmapani and Vajrapani in Mendut temple.

In contemporary Indonesian Buddhist perspective, &quot;Candi&quot; refers to a shrine, either ancient or new. Several contemporary &quot;viharas&quot; in Indonesia for example, contain the actual-size replica or reconstruction of famous Buddhist temples, such as the replica of Pawon and Plaosan&#x27;s &quot;perwara&quot; (small) temples. In Buddhism, the role of a &quot;candi&quot; as a shrine is sometimes interchangeable with a stupa, a domed structure to store Buddhist relics or the ashes of cremated Buddhist priests, patrons or benefactors.

==Japan==

Japanese Buddhist temples typically include a Main Hall.

A distinctive feature is the chinjusha, a Shinto shrine devoted to the temple&#x27;s kami. Buddhism co-existed with Shinto, but in the 8th century Buddhism became the state religion and Buddhist temples were built. High concentration of important Japanese Buddhist temples can be found in Japanese culture heartland of Kansai region, especially in Nara and Kyoto.

==Thailand==


Buddhist temples in Thailand are known as wat, from the Pāḷi vāṭa, meaning &quot;enclosure&quot;. Wat architecture adheres to consistent principles. A wat, with few exceptions, consists of two parts: the &quot;Phutthawat&quot; and the &quot;Sangkhawat&quot;. The &quot;Phutthawat&quot; () is the area which is dedicated to Buddha. While the &quot;Sangkhawat&quot; is the area which is dedicated to Sangha Buddhist monastic community.

==Sri Lanka==

Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka are known as &#x27;Pansala&#x27; or &#x27;Viharaya&#x27; in Sinhalese. Common features in Sri Lankan temples include Stupa, Bo Tree and Temple Buildings. Sri Lanka has the oldest living human-planted Bodhi Tree in the world, Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, and some of the largest Stupa in the world including Ruwanwelisaya, Jetavanaramaya and Abhayagiri vihāra located in Sri Lankan temples.

<text>John Ostrander (born April 20, 1949) is an American writer of comic books, including &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, &quot;Grimjack&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot;.

He co-created the Oracle persona for Barbara Gordon and created the second and modern version of the antihero/supervillain team the Suicide Squad, of which the films &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot; (2021) are based on.

==Career==
Ostrander studied theology with the intent of becoming a Catholic priest, but now describes himself as an agnostic.

Originally an actor in the Organic Theater Company in Chicago, Ostrander moved into writing comics in 1983. His first published works were stories about the character &quot;Sargon, Mistress of War&quot;, and appeared in the First Comics series &quot;Warp!&quot;, based on a series of plays by that same Chicago theater company. He and Timothy Truman co-created the character Grimjack, who originally appeared in a backup story in the First Comics title, &quot;Starslayer&quot;, before receiving his own title. Just prior to entering the comics industry, Ostrander had a supporting character named for him in &quot;The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl&quot; series. His friend, writer Paul Kupperberg, incorporated him into the Supergirl storyline in 1982.

Ostrander made his DC Comics debut by plotting the miniseries &quot;Legends&quot;, which was scripted by Len Wein and penciled by John Byrne. A new version of the Suicide Squad was introduced in &quot;Legends&quot;, including the team&#x27;s leader, Amanda Waller. The character has been substantially adapted into animated and live-action media and is portrayed by Viola Davis in the 2016 film &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; and the 2021 &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot;. Following &quot;Legends&quot;, Ostrander and artist Luke McDonnell launched the Suicide Squad into their own title in 1987 and developed several characters for the series. Later that same year, he and actor/writer Del Close created the &quot;Wasteland&quot; series with a rotating roster of artists. He and Close had previously worked together on Munden&#x27;s Bar backup stories in &quot;Grimjack&quot;.

From 1987 until her death from breast cancer in 1997, Ostrander frequently co-wrote with his wife Kim Yale including on the &quot;Manhunter&quot; series. It was while working together on &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; that they recast Barbara Gordon, the former Batgirl, into the information and computer specialist Oracle.

Ostrander has been a frequent collaborator with artist Tom Mandrake. They have worked together on &quot;Grimjack&quot;, &quot;Firestorm the Nuclear Man&quot;, &quot;The Spectre&quot;, and &quot;Martian Manhunter&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;John/Tom&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ostrander&#x27;s in-depth explorations of morality were used in his work writing &quot;The Spectre&quot;, a DC Comics series about the manifestation of the wrath of God. His focus on the character&#x27;s human aspect, a dead police detective from the 1930s named Jim Corrigan, and his exploration of moral and theological themes. In issue #54 (June 1997), the creative team introduced the character Michael Holt as a new version of Mister Terrific. Following the end of &quot;The Spectre&quot; series, they moved onto a &quot;Martian Manhunter&quot; series. In December 2006, a story-arc titled &quot;Grotesk&quot; by Ostrander and Mandrake appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; issues 659–662.

In 1990, Ostrander launched an ongoing &quot;Hawkworld&quot; series which followed Timothy Truman&#x27;s limited series of the same name. In 1993, the title was cancelled and relaunched as &quot;Hawkman&quot; with art by Jan Duursema.

At Marvel Comics, Ostrander has worked on &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;Bishop&quot;, &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, &quot;Heroes for Hire&quot; and the &quot;Punisher&quot;, as well as the Western mini-series &quot;Blaze of Glory: The Last Ride of the Western Heroes&quot;.

He has written the &quot;Elfquest&quot; character Jink for WaRP Graphics, &quot;Hotspur&quot; for Eclipse Comics; &quot;Lady Death&quot; for Chaos! Comics; &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot;, &quot;Rai and the Future Force&quot; and &quot;Eternal Warrior&quot; for Valiant Comics. He was one of the main writers on &quot;Star Wars: Republic&quot; for Dark Horse Comics, and his story arcs include &quot;Twilight&quot;, &quot;Darkness&quot;, and &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; stories. He is the writer of &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot;. An unreleased &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama titled &quot;Deadman&#x27;s Hand&quot; was written by Ostrander for Big Finish Productions. As announced, the story was to feature the Seventh Doctor, Ace and Hex in the American wild west.

Ostrander contributed to the &quot;Silver Age Sentinels&quot; short story anthologies from Guardians of Order. He was nominated for the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; Award for Favorite Writer in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. In 2010, he co-wrote &quot;Secret Six&quot; issues 14–18 with writer Gail Simone. Ostrander maintains an online presence on the World Famous Comics Network and writes a weekly column on the ComicMix site. Ostrander has a cameo as Dr. Fitzgibbon in the 2021 film &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ostrander suffers from glaucoma. To help cover the costs incurred by his treatment for it, a benefit auction was organized for the 2009 Chicago Comic Con.

<text>The 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade was a formation of the Canadian Army in both World War I and World War II. The brigade fought on the Western Front during World War I, and in Normandy and north-west Europe during World War II. It formed part of the 4th Canadian Division.

== History ==

=== World War I ===
The 10th Brigade was part of the Canadian Expeditionary Force raised during the First World War. It was formed in England in April 1916. It participated in every major Canadian engagement from the Somme (from August 1916) to the last 100 days (1918). The 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade consisted of four battalions, and formed part of the 4th Division. The battalions were the 44th Battalion, the 46th Battalion, the 47th Battalion and the 50th Battalion.

=== World War II ===
The 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade was first assembled at Nanaimo, British Columbia in October 1940, although Nanaimo was not established as its headquarters until February 1941. In April 1941 it was moved east to the Niagara area, exchanging places with the 13th Canadian Infantry Brigade. During World War II, it was part of the Canadian 4th Armoured Division, alongside the 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade.

The brigade consisted of the following units:
*1st Battalion, The Lincoln and Welland Regiment
*1st Battalion, The Algonquin Regiment
*1st Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise&#x27;s)
*10th Infantry Brigade Ground Defence Platoon (Lorne Scots)
* 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade Support Group (The New Brunswick Rangers) (November 1943–February 1944)
* 10th Independent Machine Gun Company (The New Brunswick Rangers) (February 1944–February 1946)

==== Normandy ====

As part of the 4th Armoured Division, the 10th Brigade arrived in Normandy at the end of July 1944. It was present for Operation Totalize, Operation Tractable, and the Battle of Falaise. After reaching the River Seine, they advanced along the French coast to Belgium.

==== Northwest Europe ====

After France and Belgium the brigade, still part of 4th Armoured, was involved in the critical Battle of the Scheldt, to open the port of Antwerp, to Allied shipping. Next came Operation Veritable clearing the land between the Rhine and Roer rivers and their last major operation of the war the Battle of the Reichswald.

==== Battle of Moerbrugge ====

The 10th Infantry Brigade was tasked to cross the Ghent Canal about five kilometres south of Bruges at a small village called Oostkamp in early September 1944. Directly across the canal from Oostkamp was another small village named Moerbrugge. The canal is about 20 metres wide and very deep. Opposition was not expected so only one battalion was chosen for the crossing: The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada.

Two batteries of the 15th Field Regiment, RCA, were placed in support and The South Alberta Regiment placed its tanks on the friendly side of the canal at either side of the crossing point and hold the flanks of the crossing with their fire along with the Vickers machine guns of The New Brunswick Rangers. The mortars of the Argylls and the mortars of the Rangers were in support.

<text>Namhae (?–24, r. 4–24 CE) was the second King of Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He is commonly called Namhae Chachaung, &quot;chachaung&quot; being an early Silla title.

Namhae is the only king who is called Chachaung. According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Kim Dae-Mun explained that the title &quot;Chachaung&quot; meant a shaman in Old Korean.

==Background==
He was the eldest son of Park Hyeokgeose, Silla&#x27;s founder, and Lady Aryeong. His surname was Park, and his wife was Lady Unje (). Alternatively, the Suseo (隋書), a Chinese history book compiled during the reign of Taizong of Tang, suggests that Namhae actually originated from Baekje. Historians theorize that Namhae was a Baekje priest who either was expelled from Baekje and settled in Silla. the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; records that Namhae violently usurped King Hyeokgeose by killing him, thus becoming the second king of Silla.

==Reign==
His reign was characterized by a series of foreign invasions. In 4, the Lelang army surrounded Geumseong, the Sillan capital, but was repelled.

In 8, when the Namhae of Silla heard that Talhae was benevolent, he married his eldest daughter to him.

The Wa of Japan invaded Silla in 14, and while Silla stopped them, Lelang invaded again. A comet shower was said to have scared the Lelang soldiers, however, and they retreated.
The Bukmyeong(北溟) people plowed the fields and got &quot;Royal Seal of Ye&quot; (), previously used by Buyeo&#x27;s kings, and dedicated it to Silla in 19. It is not clear where Bukmyeong means.

He was buried in Sareung-won.

<doc id="900279" wikidata="Q1397690" url="?curid=900279" title="Patrol Craft Fast">
<text>The Patrol Craft Fast (PCF), also known as Swift Boat, were all-aluminum, long, shallow-draft vessels operated by the United States Navy, initially to patrol the coastal areas and later for work in the interior waterways as part of the brown-water navy to interdict Vietcong movement of arms and munitions, transport South Vietnamese forces and insert SEAL teams for counterinsurgency (COIN) operations during the Vietnam War.

== Development ==
=== Conception ===

The Swift Boat was conceived in a &quot;Naval Advisory Group&quot;, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (NAVADGRP MACV) staff study titled &quot;Naval Craft Requirements in a Counter Insurgency Environment,&quot; published 1 February 1965. The study was positively received, and the Navy began to search for sources. Sewart Seacraft of Berwick, Louisiana (Swiftships&#x27; predecessor), built water taxis for companies operating oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, which appeared nearly ideal. The Navy bought their plans, and asked Sewart Seacraft to prepare modified drawings that included a gun tub, ammo lockers, bunks, and a small galley. The Navy used those enhanced plans to request bids from other boat builders. Sewart Seacraft was chosen to build the boats.

=== Mark I ===

The Swift Boats had welded aluminum hulls about long with beam, and draft of about five feet (1.5 m). They were powered by a pair of General Motors 12V71&quot;N&quot; Detroit marine diesel engines rated at each, with a design range from at to about at . The normal complement for a Swift Boat was six: an officer in charge (skipper), a boatswains mate, a radar/radioman (radarman), an engineer (engineman), and two gunners (quartermaster and gunner&#x27;s mate). In 1969, the crew was supplemented with a Vietnamese trainee.

The first two PCFs were delivered to the Navy in late August 1965. The original water taxi design had been enhanced with two .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns in a turret above the pilot house, an over-and-under .50-caliber machine gun – 81 mm mortar combination mounted on the rear deck, a mortar ammunition box on the stern, improved habitability equipment such as bunks, a refrigerator and freezer, and a sink. The 81 mm combination mortar mounted on the rear deck was not a gravity firing mortar as used by the Army and Marine Corps, in which the falling projectile&#x27;s primer struck the fixed firing pin at the base of the mortar tube, but a unique lanyard firing weapon in which the projectile was still loaded into the muzzle. The gunner could &quot;fire at will&quot; by the use of the lanyard. The weapon had been tested in the 1950s and discarded as the U.S. Navy lost interest in the system. The United States Coast Guard maintained the gun/mortar system before the Navy incorporated it into the PCF program. Many boats also mounted a single M60 machine gun in the forward peak tank, just in front of the forward superstructure.

The original order for 50 boats was followed shortly by an additional order for 54 more Mark Is.

=== Mark II and Mark III ===
In the latter half of 1967, 46 Mark II boats, with a modified deck house set further back from the bow. The newer boats also had round port holes (replacing larger sliding windows) in the aft superstructure. From 1969 through 1972, 33 Mark IIIs, which were a larger version of the Mark IIs, arrived in Vietnam.

==Service==
Most of the 193 PCFs built were used by the U.S. Navy in Vietnam and the two training bases in California. About 80 of the boats constructed were sold or given away to nations friendly to the United States. The original training base for Swift Boats was at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado.

In 1969, training was moved to Mare Island near San Pablo Bay, California, where it remained for the duration of the war. Though not a deep water boat, PCF training boats frequently transited from Mare Island, through the Golden Gate Bridge to cruise either north or south along the Pacific Ocean coastline. &quot;PCF-8&quot; sank in a storm off Bodega Bay, California in December 1969. This was the only Swift Boat lost during training operations. No crewmen were lost in the event.

The most frequent training area for the Mare Island units was the marshland that forms the northern shoreline of San Francisco Bay. This area, now known as the Napa Sonoma Marshes State Wildlife Area, was also used by United States Navy Reserve unit PBRs) up until 1995, when Mare Island was scheduled for base closure.

===Vietnam War service===
The first Swift Boats arrived in South Vietnam in October 1965. The boats were initially used as coastal patrol craft in Operation Market Time, interdicting seaborne supplies on their way to the Viet Cong (VC) and People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces in South Vietnam. However, the design&#x27;s shallow draft and low freeboard limited their seaworthiness in open waters. These limitations, plus the difficulties being encountered in the interior waterways by the smaller, more lightly armed PBRs, led to the incorporation of Swifts to patrol the of rivers and canals of Vietnam&#x27;s interior waterways. Swift Boats continued to operate along the Vietnamese coastal areas, but with the start of Admiral Elmo Zumwalt&#x27;s &quot;SEALORDS&quot; riverway interdiction strategy, their primary area of operations soon centered upon the Cà Mau Peninsula and the Mekong Delta area in the southern tip of Vietnam. Here they patrolled the waterways and performed special operations, including gunfire support, troop insertion and evacuation, and raids into enemy territory.

The Mekong Delta is composed of ten thousand square miles of marshland, swamps and forested areas. The region is interlaced by rivers and canal ways. Controlled by the VC, the interior waterways of the Mekong Delta were used to transport supplies and weapons.

Swift Boats generally operated in teams of three to five. Each boat had an officer in charge, one of whom would also be placed in overall charge of the mission. Their missions included patrolling the waterways, searching water traffic for weapons and munitions, transporting South Vietnamese marine units and inserting Navy SEAL teams.

When the Swift Boats began making forays up the waterways into the interior of the delta, they initially took the carriers by surprise, causing them to drop their materials and run off into the overgrowth. Occasionally a short firefight would break out. As it became clear that control of the waterways was being contested, the VC developed a number of tactics to challenge the U.S. Navy. They set up ambushes, built obstructions in the canals to create choke points and began to place mines in the waterways.

For the Swifts, coming back down river was always more dangerous than going up river. The passage of a patrol assured their eventual return, providing an opportunity for the VC. Ambushes were typically short lived affairs, set up at a river bend or in a narrow canal that restricted the maneuverability of the boats. A wide variety of portable weapons were used in attacks, including recoilless rifles, B-40 rockets, .50 caliber machine guns and AK-47s, often fired from behind earthen bunkered positions. Engagements were brief and violent, with the ambushers often slipping away into the undergrowth when the boats located the source of attack and began to concentrate their return fire. When attacked the boats would accelerate out of the hot zone, turn and then return as a group, firing as many of their guns as they could bring to bear. They would power past the ambush point, turn and return to attack again until the ambushers were either killed or slipped away. Though most cruising and patrolling was done at 8 to 10 knots, the boats could reach a top speed of 32 knots. Thick brush and vegetation in the delta provided excellent cover for the escaping ambushers. Casualties taken among the river crews were high. Casualties suffered among the VC were difficult to assess, as they would take their dead and wounded away from a firefight. Discovering newly dug graveyards was one of the few ways to confirm VC losses.

The first Swift Boat to be lost during the war was &quot;PCF-4&quot;, which was lost to a mine in 1966. Two boats, &quot;PCF-14&quot; and &quot;PCF-76&quot;, were lost in rough seas at the mouth of the Cua Viet River near the DMZ, and a third, &quot;PCF-77&quot;, was lost in a rescue effort during a monsoon at the mouth of the Perfume River on the approach to Huế. All three of these boats were lost in 1966. &quot;PCF-41&quot; was lost that same year in an ambush when it was hit by fire from a 57 mm recoilless rifle. Its controls destroyed and coxswain killed, it ran aground at speed. When the crew ran out of ammunition it had to be abandoned. It was recovered the next day but was too badly damaged to be repaired, so was salvaged instead.

&quot;PCF-43&quot; was lost to a rocket attack in 1969. Several other Swift Boats had been lost to river mines, but had been salvaged and either repaired or used for spare parts.

When Vietnamization was implemented, several Swift Boats were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy.

==== Controversy over loss of &quot;PCF-19&quot; ====

On the night of 15/16 June 1968, U.S. marine aircraft spotters on the ground began reporting unidentified helicopters near the DMZ. The first report stated that four helicopters had been detected and were proceeding toward Tiger Island, just off the North Vietnamese coast at an altitude of . These spotters observed the aircraft visually, using Starlight Scopes and by radar. Over the course of the night, Air Force pilots reported 19 additional helicopter sightings. On this same evening the guided missile heavy cruiser , operating near the
DMZ, also began reporting helicopter activity in the vicinity of Bến Hải, Cap Lay and Tiger Island. At 00:10 on the 16th, an unidentified aircraft fired three rockets or missiles at &quot;Boston&quot;, but none hit the vessel.

At 01:00 on 16 June 1968 in the same area, &quot;PCF-19&quot; was struck by two missiles, one struck the cabin just below the pilothouse on the port side, the other hit the engine room. The boat sank in four minutes. Four of its crewmen were killed, and two others badly injured. The remaining crew managed to swim free from the sinking craft and cling to a life raft until arrived on scene at 01:30. As soon as the survivors were on board, &quot;Point Dume&quot; departed the scene to drop them off at the Cua Viet Base for a medevac to Danang. In the meantime, the crew of &quot;PCF-12&quot;, which had arrived on the scene at 01:50 to continue the search for survivors, noticed illumination rounds being fired that were not their own. Opting to investigate, the officer in charge ordered the boat to speed to the Cua Viet River. When &quot;PCF-12&quot; was from the river mouth, crewmembers observed two sets of aircraft lights off the port and starboard beam, about away and above the water. The boat commander immediately got on the radio and requested permission to engage the aircraft. At 02:25, &quot;PCF-12&quot; received a single rocket from seaward at a low trajectory. The rocket passed a couple of feet over the main cabin and exploded in the water ten feet from the boat. &quot;PCF-12&quot; came about, increased speed and moved away from the kill zone while bringing its .50-caliber guns to bear against an aerial target hovering at with lights blinking. The aircraft decreased altitude and turned off its lights. After a short time, &quot;PCF-12&quot; stopped to observe the scene and saw two aircraft appeared off its beams again with lights on. The boat commander contacted the marine observer and inquired about their status. The marines told him that they could not identify the aircraft because they did not have their identification, friend or foe (IFF) transponders turned on. At 02:35, the aircraft near the beach fired 40–50 rounds of .50-caliber tracer fire at the PCF. All rounds landed astern. &quot;PCF-12&quot; responded with machine-gun and mortar fire.

At 02:40, &quot;Point Dume&quot;, now back on the scene was attacked by a fixed-wing aircraft, which made two attack runs against the vessel. Both the commanding officer of &quot;Point Dume&quot; and the commander of &quot;PCF-12&quot; positively identified the aircraft as a &quot;jet.&quot; The crews of &quot;Point Dume&quot; and &quot;PCF-12&quot; then observed numerous lighted aircraft that appeared to be helicopters in the northern part of the area. These aircraft approached the U.S. vessels and made firing runs with their lights off. &quot;Point Dume&quot; received heavy caliber automatic weapons fire from these aircraft and returned fire. &quot;PCF-12&quot; also returned fire intermittently for approximately 75 minutes. Neither vessel was damaged in the engagement; there were no personnel injured.

On the afternoon of 16 June, Task Unit 77.1.0 ordered , and the Royal Australian Navy guided-missile destroyer Hobart to conduct a surveillance mission in the vicinity of Tiger Island in attempt to flush out any enemy helicopters or waterborne craft operating from there. At 01:18 on the 17th, &quot;Boston&quot;, which was engaged in a naval gunfire support mission in the same general area, came under attack from an unidentified jet aircraft. The jet fired two missiles at the ship: one exploded off the port beam; and the other close aboard to port, showering the ship with fragments. No sailors were injured, and the missiles caused only minor structural damage to the ship. At 03:09, while &quot;Hobart&quot; was searching a 5-mile radius area between the coast and Tiger Island with its radar, it detected a single aircraft tracking east. The aircraft was not squawking IFF. An attempt was made to identify the aircraft by visual gun direction personnel on the bridge. Five minutes later a missile slammed into the chief petty officers&#x27; mess and nearby spaces, killing one sailor and wounding two others. The ship took evasive action but temporarily lost radar contact with the aircraft. At 03:16, two more missiles hit the ship, destroying the gunners&#x27; store and damaging other spaces, including the engineers&#x27; workshop, the seamen&#x27;s mess, the missile director room, the RIM-24 Tartar checkout room, and the chiefs&#x27; mess (again). This second attack killed an officer and wounded other sailors. As the aircraft turned to make a third pass, one of the ship&#x27;s gun turrets fired five rounds and the aircraft turned and retreated. Fourteen minutes later &quot;Edson&quot;, now at general quarters due to reports from &quot;Hobart&quot; about hostile aircraft in the area, came under attack by an unidentified aircraft. Lookouts and sonar confirmed a near miss astern by a missile.

The next day Vice Admiral William F. Bringle, Commander Seventh Fleet, appointed Rear Admiral S. H. Moore, Commander Task Group 77.1/70.8, to conduct an informal investigation into the various firing incidents occurring between 15 and 17 June. The board determined that Air Force F-4s launched two AIM-7E Sparrow missiles on 17 June at 01:15 and one at 03:15 that same day. Fragments of Sparrow missiles complete with serial numbers found on &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Hobart&quot; confirmed these findings. The case was therefore quite clear with regard to these two attacks on 17 June — &quot;Hobart&quot; and &quot;Boston&quot; had been the victims of friendly fire. The board also investigated the 16 June attacks on &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;PCF-19&quot; and the attack on &quot;Edson&quot; on the 17th. From the positions of American vessels and attacking aircraft, the board concluded that Air Force aircraft attacked &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;PCF-19&quot; on the 16th and that American aircraft also attacked &quot;Edson&quot; on the 17th. Unlike the &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Hobart&quot; attacks on the 17th, however, no physical evidence supported these findings. Later research of the incident with surviving veterans and a review of salvage reports from , the ship that recovered the bodies and codebooks from &quot;PCF-19&quot; shortly after the attack, found that the rocket entry holes in the hull of &quot;PCF-19&quot; were 76.2mm in size—the size of a standard helicopter rocket carried by a Soviet-manufactured Mi-4 Hound helicopter and not Sparrow or Sidewinder holes, which would have been larger.

===Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy service===
The Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy managed to capture 107 of Republic of Vietnam Navy PCFs after the Fall of Saigon in 1975. The PCFs were quickly used in VPN operations at Thổ Chu and other islands to repel the invasion of the Khmer Rouge. The Swift Boats are still active in the Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy.

The M2 machine gun was replaced by a domestically produced 12.7 mm NSV gun, which had fewer jamming problems and was easier for the crews to maintain. The electronic and communication systems were also overhauled. Some PCFs captured have a DsHK HMG and an AGS-17 AGL mounted on top.

== Operators ==
===Current===
*: Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy, taken from the former South Vietnam Navy. M2 HMG and other American-installed components replaced with NSV HMG or a DsHK and AGS-17.

===Former===
*: Khmer National Navy.
*: Maritime Squadron of the Armed Forces of Malta.
*: The MN GC-201 Comandante Torrijos and MN GC-202 Presidente Porras acquired from the US in the 1980s for the Panamanian Navy.
*: Philippine Navy &amp; Philippine Coast Guard.
*: Republic of Vietnam Navy.
*: U.S. Navy
*: Royal Thai Navy.

===Non-State Actors===
*: Khmer Rouge, captured from the US and Khmer Navy.

==Preservation==

===Malta===
Former U.S. Navy Vietnam veterans, from the Swift Boat Sailors&#x27; Association, visited Malta in 2010 and said the Malta Swifts were the last two still in service, out of hundreds that were built. One of the two patrol boats headed back to the United States to become a memorial in summer 2012 at the Maritime Museum of San Diego in California.

The museum has a display paying tribute to the Maltese servicemen who died on board the &quot;P23&quot; (the sister vessel of &quot;P24&quot;) during an accident that occurred on September 7, 1984. The incident – known as the C23 tragedy and the worst peace-time accident suffered by Maltese services personnel – killed five AFM soldiers and two policemen when illegal fireworks about to be dumped into the sea exploded on the bow of the small patrol boat.

The AFM retained &quot;P23&quot; as a memorial to those killed in the explosion. &quot;P23&quot; was also depicted on a Maltese postage stamp commemorating the island&#x27;s maritime heritage on 10 August 2011.

===Philippines===
A Swift Mk.3-class PB-353 physically restored and converted to museum display at the re-launched Philippine Navy Museum, Fort San Felipe, Cavite.

===United States===
There are two operational PCFs in the United States today. R/V &quot;Matthew F. Maury&quot; is operated by Tidewater Community College in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Formerly &quot;PCF-2&quot;, the vessel was awarded to the college in 1995 and has been used in oceanographic research and education since then. It is berthed at JEB Little Creek and operates in and around Chesapeake Bay. The second operational PCF, &quot;PCF-816&quot; (formerly &quot;P-24&quot; in the service of Malta) is operational in San Diego, California at the Maritime Museum of San Diego. The boat makes regular runs on weekends and is staffed with former Swift Boat sailors as narrators.

There are two Swift Boats preserved in static displays in the United States. Both are former U.S. Navy Swift Boats that were originally stationed in California to train PCF crews. One is located at the Navy Museum at Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.; the second Swift Boat is on the Naval Special Weapons Base at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, California, the original home of PCF training.

== Notable personnel ==
Those who served on the boats in Vietnam and later became politicians include Nebraska Governor and U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey, a recipient of the Medal of Honor, and Arizona Congressman Jim Kolbe, who served in the United States Navy.

U.S. Senator and Secretary of State John Kerry commanded a Swift Boat when he served in Vietnam. LTJG Kerry was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts during riverine combat in a PCF.

==Controversy==
As the Democratic nominee for president in 2004, then-Senator Kerry&#x27;s military record was attacked by a political 527 group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. Ever since, the term &quot;swiftboating&quot; has entered American political jargon associating swift boat service with political smear tactics.

In an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on June 30, 2008, Swift Boat veterans objected to the prevalent use of the verb &quot;swiftboating&quot; as this type of &quot;ad hominem&quot; attack, stating that it is disrespectful to the men who served and died on the PCFs during Vietnam.

<doc id="900286" wikidata="Q244255" url="?curid=900286" title="Arceuthobium">
<text>The genus Arceuthobium, commonly called dwarf [[mistletoe]]s, is a genus of 26 species of parasitic plants that parasitize members of Pinaceae and Cupressaceae in North America, Central America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. Of the 42 species that have been recognized, 39 and 21 of these are endemic to North America and the United States, respectively. They all have very reduced shoots and leaves (mostly reduced to scales) with the bulk of the plant living under the host&#x27;s bark. Recently the number of species within the genus has been reduced to 26 as a result of more detailed genetic analysis.

==Description==

They are dioecious, individual plants being either male or female. The fruit is unusual in that it builds up hydrostatic pressure internally when ripe and shoots the single sticky seed up to speeds nearly , an example of rapid plant movement. The lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe,&quot; Arceuthobium americanum, has been found to explosively-disperse its seeds through thermogenesis. Dwarf mistletoe seeds are enveloped in a hygroscopic, glue-like substance called viscin. Many fail to land on a suitable host&#x27;s shoot, but some succeed, and in this way they are spread through the forests as a pest front. The spread of dwarf mistletoes in forest stands is greatest from the overstory to the understory, owing to gravity. Advantageous stand conditions for the spread of the parasite include an uneven-aged stand structure with severely infected hosts in dominant and codominant crown classes, species composition dominated by the primary host, and tree densities between 175 and 500 trees/ha.

There are also several species from Europe and Asia including one of the smallest in the genus, &quot;A. minutissimum&quot; that lives on its host, &quot;Pinus wallichiana&quot; in the Himalayas.

==Effects of parasitism==
In western forest ecosystems of North America, numerous dwarf mistletoe species are considered to be serious forest-borne disease agents. Severe dwarf mistletoe infection can result in a reduction in tree growth, premature tree mortality, reduced seed and cone development, and reduced wood quality, and increases the susceptibility of the host tree to pathogen and/or insect attack. Most of the commercially important conifers in western North America are parasitized by one or more dwarf mistletoes.

The interaction between dwarf mistletoes and their host can be generalized as a source-to-sink relationship. Dwarf mistletoes derive the majority of their nutrition from the host’s vascular tissues. Dwarf mistletoes have a root-like endophytic system, composed of primary and secondary haustoria, which invade, but do not injure, both the xylem and phloem of the host. Because this root-like endophytic system is not soilborne, dwarf mistletoes are dependent solely on their host for water. Along a xylem-to-xylem link, dwarf mistletoes draw water from their host using the difference in water potential between parasite and host. The greater transpiration rate of the dwarf mistletoe produces a lower water potential, allowing water to flow from host to parasite. The water gradient or transpiration stream is consistently maintained, even when the host is under moderate water deficit.

In addition to host-water dependence, dwarf mistletoes must acquire carbohydrate and mineral nutrition from their hosts. Dwarf mistletoes have both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b and the necessary mechanisms for photosynthesis, but chlorophyll concentrations in dwarf mistletoes are approximately 1/5 to 1/10 of those found in their host’s foliage, and dwarf mistletoes have low photosynthetic rates as measured by the rate of carbon fixation. The principal carbohydrate transported from the host to dwarf mistletoe is sucrose. Because dwarf mistletoes are phloem-deficient, they draw carbohydrates from their hosts by connections to the host phloem and ray parenchyma. The rate of carbohydrate transport varies by season, but dwarf mistletoes continuously draw carbohydrates from their hosts throughout the year.

==Dwarf mistletoe rating system==

A standardized system called the Hawksworth 6-class dwarf mistletoe rating (DMR) system has been devised to determine how much dwarf mistletoe has infected a tree. To use this system, the living part of the tree crown needs to be broken up into 3 sections, (top, middle, bottom). Each section is then rated either 0, 1, or 2 with a score of 0 being assigned for a uninfected section, 1 for light infection with fewer than half of the branches infected, or 2 for heavy infection with over half of the branches infected. The 3 numbers are then added together to give the total rating for the tree.

<text>Malcolm Guthrie (10 February 1903 – 22 November 1972) was an English linguist who specialized in Bantu languages.

Guthrie was a foremost professor of Bantu languages at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London. He is known primarily for his classification of Bantu languages, Guthrie 1971. The classification, though based more on geography than linguistic relatedness, is nonetheless the most widely used. Together with the Belgian linguist Achille Émile Meeussen (1912–1978), he is regarded as one of the two leading Bantu specialists of the second half of the 20th century.

==Early life and career==
Malcolm Guthrie was born in Hove, Sussex, England, the son of a Scottish father and a mother of Dutch extraction. After schooling at Ipswich, he took a degree in metallurgy at Imperial College, London.

Shortly afterwards, however, he felt called to the Baptist ministry. He served for two years as minister of a Baptist church in Rochester, during which time he married Margaret Near, the daughter of a Baptist minister at a neighbouring church. In 1932 he went as a missionary to Kinshasa in the then Belgian Congo, where he worked for the next eight years. It was here that he studied the Lingala language and several other local languages.

==Works==
Guthrie&#x27;s first major work was &quot;The Classification of the Bantu Languages&quot; (1948), in which he tried to define the set of Bantu languages. It was in this work that the first version of the famous coding of these languages into geographical &quot;zones&quot; first appeared.

The magnum opus of Guthrie is &quot;Comparative Bantu&quot;, which appeared in 4 volumes published in 1967 (volume 1), 1970 (volumes 3 and 4), and 1971 (volume 2). The 4 volumes provide not only a genetic classification but also a reconstruction of Proto-Bantu as the Proto-language of the Bantu language family. For his reconstruction, Guthrie drew data from 28 so-called &quot;test languages&quot; that were picked more or less randomly. It has been argued, for example by Wilhelm Möhlig, that this renders his reconstruction unreliable, since the reconstructed forms, and hence the genetic tree, would be different if one changed the selection of languages.

Guthrie also published extensively on a wide range of Bantu languages, including Lingala, Bemba, Mfinu, and Teke.

<doc id="900291" wikidata="Q1623044" url="?curid=900291" title="Elizabeth Swann">
<text>Elizabeth Swann is a fictional character in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film series. She appears in &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (2003), &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006), &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007) and &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; (2017). She is portrayed by Keira Knightley in all four films. Elizabeth is the daughter of Weatherby Swann, the wife of Will Turner and the mother of Henry Turner.

==Appearances==

=== Film series ===

==== &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; ====
Elizabeth Swann was introduced at the beginning of the original 2003 film, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.&quot; She appears as a young girl at sea with her father, Governor Weatherby Swann. She notices a boy floating in the water, and the crew hauls him aboard the ship. He is identified as Will Turner. Eight years later, Elizabeth is of a marriageable age. Her father, the governor of Port Royal, wants her to marry Commodore James Norrington, a Royal Navy officer. During Norrington&#x27;s marriage proposal, Elizabeth is suffocated by her tightly-laced corset and faints, falling into the bay.

She is rescued by the notorious pirate Jack Sparrow, newly arrived in Port Royal to commandeer a ship. Despite Sparrow&#x27;s gallant act and against Elizabeth&#x27;s protests, he is promptly jailed and sentenced to hang. That night, Port Royal is raided by the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, a pirate ship. When Elizabeth is taken hostage by the pirates, they discover that she possesses a gold medallion that she took from Will after his rescue years ago. Elizabeth strikes a deal with the captain of the ship, Hector Barbossa: He will leave Port Royal in exchange for the medallion. At first Barbossa agrees, but then keeps Elizabeth captive after she identifies herself as &quot;Elizabeth Turner&quot;. He believes that, as a Turner, her blood can break a curse that has transformed his crew into immortal zombies.

Will frees Sparrow from prison, and together they pursue Barbossa. After a series of adventures, Barbossa takes Will captive and maroons Elizabeth and Sparrow on a deserted island. Elizabeth creates a towering smoke column, which is spotted by Norrington. Hoping to rescue Will, Elizabeth convinces Norrington to attack Barbossa&#x27;s crew on Isla de Muerta by impulsively accepting his marriage proposal. Once on the island, Elizabeth frees Sparrow&#x27;s crew, believing they will rescue Will and Sparrow. Instead, they commandeer the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; and set sail, leaving Elizabeth to rescue Will and Sparrow by herself. Elizabeth, Will and Sparrow fight Barbossa and his crew, and Sparrow shoots Barbossa as the curse is lifted. He falls dead, and his now-mortal crewmates surrender to Norrington. Back in Port Royal, Will frees Sparrow from execution. Elizabeth and Will proclaim their love for each other, and Norrington concedes Elizabeth&#x27;s hand to Will.

==== &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; ====
&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006) takes place one year after &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;. At the beginning of the film, Lord Cutler Beckett notifies Elizabeth and Will that they have been sentenced to death for helping Sparrow escape execution. Beckett, who is an agent of the East India Trading Company, offers clemency if Will agrees to search for Sparrow and obtain his magical compass. Will finds Sparrow and the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; crew on Isla de Pelegostos. They are hiding from the Kraken, a leviathan controlled by the mythical captain Davy Jones.

Elizabeth escapes from prison and discovers that Beckett is not pardoning her or Will. She confronts Beckett and forces him to free Will. She then travels to Tortuga, where she encounters Sparrow attempting to pay off a debt to Jones. Also present is Norrington, who tries to shoot Sparrow. In the ensuing brawl, Elizabeth knocks out Norrington to save him. Sparrow claims Will was forced into joining Jones&#x27;s crew, but says Elizabeth can save him by finding the Dead Man&#x27;s Chest, which contains Jones&#x27;s beating heart.

Elizabeth, Sparrow, Norrington and Will arrive on Isla Cruces and locate the Chest. A conflict erupts, and Norrington flees with Jones&#x27;s heart. Jones pursues the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, and Elizabeth realizes that Sparrow is the Kraken&#x27;s sole target. She distracts him with a kiss while handcuffing him to the mast, and tells the others that he willingly stayed behind to aid their escape. After witnessing the kiss, Will believes that Elizabeth loves Sparrow. The Kraken then drags Sparrow into Davy Jones&#x27;s Locker as the others watch from the longboat. Elizabeth is wracked by guilt for sacrificing Sparrow, which prompts the voodoo priestess Tia Dalma to suggest they rescue Sparrow with the help of Captain Barbossa, who is alive once again.

==== &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; ====
Elizabeth returns in the third film in the series, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007). She joins Will, Barbossa, Tia Dalma, and Sparrow&#x27;s crew on a mission to rescue Sparrow from Davy Jones&#x27;s Locker. Elizabeth&#x27;s anguish over sacrificing Sparrow torments her, and during the voyage she distances herself from Will. She eventually reveals to him that she caused Sparrow&#x27;s demise, and he is hurt that she kept a secret from him. Elizabeth claims that Will cannot trust her, and abruptly leaves. In the Locker, Elizabeth discovers that her father was murdered by Beckett, and she vows to avenge his death.

The dying pirate captain Sao Feng names Elizabeth the Pirate Lord of the South China Sea, mistakenly believing she is the sea goddess Calypso. Elizabeth and her new crew are taken prisoner aboard the &quot;Flying Dutchman,&quot; where she is reunited with Norrington. Elizabeth accuses him of complicity in her father&#x27;s murder, but Norrington denies knowing anything about his death. That night, Norrington frees Elizabeth and her crew.

Elizabeth attends a meeting of pirate lords, who discuss how to oppose Beckett and the East India Trading Company. Elizabeth favors fighting, while others suggest hiding in Shipwreck Cove. Elizabeth is elected Pirate King and declares war. As Beckett&#x27;s fleet approaches, Elizabeth refuses to retreat and delivers a rousing speech. During the ensuing battle, Will proposes to Elizabeth, who orders Barbossa to marry them amidst the fighting. Davy Jones fatally wounds Will, and Sparrow forces the grief-stricken Elizabeth to escape with him as Will and the &quot;Dutchman&quot; are sucked into a whirlpool. The ship quickly resurfaces, however, with a resurrected Will at the helm. With the help of Will and his crew, the pirates kill Beckett and destroy his ship. Later, Elizabeth and Will travel to a nearby island and conceive their son, Henry Turner.

==== &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; ====
In &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; (2017), Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann&#x27;s son Henry searches for the Trident of Poseidon with Captain Jack Sparrow, and upon the Trident&#x27;s destruction frees Will from the curse that binds him to the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;. Elizabeth reunites with Will and they share a kiss, much to Jack&#x27;s disgust. In the post-credits sequence, Elizabeth Swann stays asleep as Will Turner dreams that their bedroom is entered by the shadow of an apparently resurrected Davy Jones.

=== Video games ===
Elizabeth is voiced by Eliza Schneider in the video games &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Jack Sparrow, Disney Speedstorm&quot;, and the video game adaptations of &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; and &quot;At World&#x27;s End.&quot; Elizabeth also appears in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean Online&quot;, &quot;Lego Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game&quot;, &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;. and &quot;Disney Speedstorm&quot;.

==Portrayal==
Keira Knightley portrays Elizabeth in all four films in which the character appears. According to a presskit from &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, the producers cast her because she had an &quot;indescribable quality...reminiscent of motion picture stars from Hollywood&#x27;s heyday.&quot; Knightley&#x27;s co-star Johnny Depp described her approach to playing Elizabeth: &quot;Keira steps into the ring and attacks...Her work is right on the money, totally professional ... I was very impressed.&quot;

Knightley has described Elizabeth as &quot;a 21st century girl trapped in an 18th century world&quot; who &quot;starts out as a damsel in distress and then kicks butt&quot;. Knightley was disappointed that Elizabeth does not carry a sword in &quot;Curse of the Black Pearl.&quot; When filming &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, Knightley was glad to shed the elaborate dresses—which were uncomfortably hot—and wear only pirate clothing. During production of &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; and &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, Knightley wore wigs when playing Elizabeth.

By the end of filming the &quot;Pirates&quot; trilogy in 2006 and the release of &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; in 2007, it was reported that Keira Knightley didn&#x27;t want to participate in any further sequels. Both Knightley and Orlando Bloom repeatedly stated that they were done with &quot;Pirates&quot; series, noting that there was closure for Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann in &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, and was quoted in saying they wanted to move on from the franchise, and so did not return for the fourth film &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot;. Despite having previously stated that she wouldn&#x27;t return, there were reports suggesting that Keira Knightley would reprise her role as Elizabeth Swann in the fifth film, &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;, due to the return of Will and the focus on their grown-up son Henry in the film. Once the film was shown to test audiences, the filmmakers felt they were &quot;demanded&quot; to reunite both Will and Elizabeth&#x27;s character and approached Knightley about appearing. To ensure that Knightley could reprise this role, the production moved for a one-day shoot in London, where she was working, and planned around her schedule. Knightley said she is not planning to appear in any additional &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; films because they &quot;take too long to shoot.&quot;

In a 2023 interview, Knightley reflected that she felt &quot;constrained&quot; and &quot;caged&quot; after her breakout performance as Elizabeth in &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl.&quot; She felt that Elizabeth was perceived as an &quot;object of desire&quot; and she felt confined to that type of role in the film industry. She said that she subsequently sought out different types of roles.

<doc id="900303" wikidata="Q1324206" url="?curid=900303" title="El Grande">
<text>El Grande is a German-style board game for 2-5 players, designed by Wolfgang Kramer and Richard Ulrich, and published in 1995 by Hans im Glück in German, by Rio Grande Games in English, and by 999 Games in Dutch. The game board represents renaissance-era Spain where the nobility (the Grandes) fight for control of the nine regions. &quot;El Grande&quot; was praised for its area-control mechanism, and was awarded the &quot;Spiel des Jahres&quot; prize and the &quot;Deutscher Spiele Preis&quot; in 1996. Following its release, several expansions and an alternative version were published. 

== Gameplay ==
The game is played in nine rounds. There are no dice in the game, and players have many chances to influence the turn order. The original game has a number of action cards that are turned up each turn, which is the only source of randomness in the game. However, the effect of this luck is very small, since these cards are potentially available to be used by any player in the game.

Each player starts the game with a hand of identical cards (numbered 1-13) at the beginning of the game. These cards are used to bid for turn order. The person who plays the highest card chooses their action card first, etc., but each player may use each card only once in a given game. During each turn, players take Caballeros and execute an action card, which includes two actions, a special action and placing Caballeros. During three of the nine rounds, scoring occurs, which involves players choosing secret regions, scoring the Castillo, which is a tower where Caballeros are placed inside, moving Caballeros from the Castillo to secret regions, and scoring other individual regions. The main challenge of the game is keeping track of the many factors that determine the balance of power in the regions and the score track.

==Reception==
Upon its release, the area control mechanism of the game was praised, with Geoffrey Engelstein, writing in &quot;Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design&quot;, describing the game&#x27;s area control mechanism as an &quot;elegant example of European design sensibilities applied to the American-style conflict games&quot;. Christian T. Petersen comments: &quot;&quot;El Grande&quot; showed me the surprising depth that could be achieved by interlocking simple mechanisms — the principle that lies at the heart of the German school of design.&quot; Mikko Saari from &quot;Lautapeliopas&quot; also praised the game&#x27;s replayability and components, but critiqued its scalability under four players. &quot;Dicebreaker&quot; also commented that the game as a &quot;time-proven, award-winning classic&quot;. Similar sentiments were expressed by reviewers for Polish portals &quot;Polter&quot; and &quot;GamesFanatic&quot;.

The game was awarded the &quot;Spiel des Jahres&quot; prize in 1996. The jury praised strategy, &quot;clearly structured&quot; gameplay, the game board landscape designed by the artist Doris Matthäus, and the &quot;well-explained&quot; rules despite the complexity, concluding that the &quot;two authors have impressively succeeded in bringing all this together into a harmonious whole&quot;. The jury commented that despite some elements of luck, player control is more emphasised. Stewart Woods, writing in &quot;Eurogames: The Design, Culture and Play of Modern European Board Games&quot;, described it as &quot;relatively complex&quot; compared to other winners. &quot;El Grande&quot; also won the 1996 &quot;Deutscher Spiele Preis&quot;.

==Reviews==
*&quot;Casus Belli&quot; #97
*&quot;Backstab&quot; #21

== Expansions ==
Following &quot;El Grande&quot;&#x27;s release, several expansions were released, including &quot;Konig &amp; Intrigant&quot; in 1997, which replaced several action and power cards. &quot;Grand Inquisitor &amp; Colonies,&quot; which added regions, was also released in the same year; subsequently, the &quot;Grandissimo&quot; expansion was published, adding action cards. In 1998, &quot;El Caballero&quot;, which was based upon &quot;El Grande&quot;, was released, with the &quot;Spiel des Jahres&quot; jury describing the game as an &quot;independent, attractive placement game&quot;.

<doc id="900305" wikidata="Q4396596" url="?curid=900305" title="Klemperer rosette">
<text>A Klemperer rosette is a gravitational system of (optionally) alternating heavier and lighter bodies orbiting in a symmetrical pattern around a common barycenter. It was first described by W.B. Klemperer in 1962, and is a special case of a central configuration.

Klemperer described rosette systems as follows:

The simplest rosette would be a series of four alternating heavier and lighter bodies, 90 degrees from one another, in a rhombic configuration [Heavy, Light, Heavy, Light], where the two larger bodies have the same mass, and likewise the two smaller bodies have the same mass, all orbiting their (empty) geometric center. The more general trojan system has unequal masses for the two heavier bodies, which Klemperer also calls a &quot;rhombic&quot; system, and is the only version that is not symmetric around the gravitational center.

The number of &quot;mass types&quot; can be increased, so long as the arrangement is symmetrical and cyclic pattern: e.g. [ 1,2,3 ... 1,2,3 ], [ 1,2,3,4,5 ... 1,2,3,4,5 ], [ 1,2,3,3,2,1 ... 1,2,3,3,2,1 ], etc.

Klemperer&#x27;s article specifically analyzes regular polygons with 2–9 corners – dumbbell-shaped through nonagon – and non-centrally symmetric &quot;rhombic rosettes&quot; with three orbiting bodies, the outer two stationed at the middle orbiting body&#x27;s triangular points (L4 and L5), which had already been described and studied by Lagrange in 1772.
Systems with an even number of 4 or more corners can have alternating heavy and light masses at the corners, though the possible range of mass ratios is constrained by para-stability requirements; systems with odd numbers of corners must have equal masses at every corner.
While Klemperer notes that all the rosettes and the rhombus are vulnerable to destabilization, the hexagonal rosette is the most nearly stable because the &quot;planets&quot; sit in each other&#x27;s semi-stable triangular Lagrangian points, L4 and L5.

The regular polygonal configurations (&quot;rosettes&quot;) do not require a central mass (a &quot;sun&quot; at the center is optional, and if present it may bobble above and below the orbital plane), although a Lagrange-type rhombus does. If a central body is present, its mass constrains the ranges for the mass-ratio between the orbiting bodies.

== Misuse and misspelling ==

The term &quot;Klemperer rosette&quot; (often misspelled &quot;&quot;Kemplerer&quot; rosette&quot;) is used to mean a configuration of three or more equal masses, set at the points of an equilateral polygon and given an equal angular velocity about their center of mass. Klemperer does indeed mention this configuration at the start of his article, but only as an already known set of equilibrium systems before introducing the actual rosettes.

In Larry Niven&#x27;s novel &quot;Fleet of Worlds&quot; in the &quot;Ringworld&quot; series, the Puppeteers&#x27; eponymous &quot;Fleet of Worlds&quot; is arranged in such a configuration
that Niven calls a &quot;Kemplerer rosette&quot;; this (possibly intentional) misspelling is one viable source of the wider confusion. These fictional planets were maintained in position by large engines, in addition to gravitational force.

==Instability==
Both simple linear perturbation analysis and simulations of rosettes demonstrate that such systems are unstable: Klemperer explains in his original article, any displacement away from the perfectly symmetrical geometry causes a growing oscillation, eventually leading to the disruption of the system. The system is unstable regardless of whether the center of the rosette is in free space, or is in orbit around a central star.

The short-form reason for the instability is that any perturbation corrupts the geometric symmetry, which increases the perturbation, and further undermines the geometry, and so on. The longer explanation is that any tangential perturbation brings a body closer to one neighbor and further from another; the gravitational imbalance becomes greater towards the closer neighbor and less for the further neighbor, pulling the perturbed object more towards its closer neighbor, amplifying the perturbation rather than damping it. An inward radial perturbation causes the perturbed body to get closer to &quot;all&quot; other objects, increasing the force on the object and increasing its orbital velocity, which leads indirectly to a tangential perturbation and the argument above.

<text>Robert Silliman Hillyer (June 3, 1895 – December 24, 1961) was an American poet and professor of English literature. He won a Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1934.

== Early life ==
Hillyer was born in East Orange, New Jersey to an old Connecticut family. He attended Kent School in Kent, Connecticut. After high school, he attended Harvard University, graduating cum laude in 1917. While there, he was the editor of the literary magazine &quot;The Harvard Advocate, and was&quot; affiliated with the group known as the Harvard Aesthetes.

When World War I began, he went to France and volunteered for the Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps, along with Harvard classmate John Dos Passos. Once the United States entered the war, he joined the American forces. After serving as an ambulance driver, Hillyer later returned to France to work in the US Ordnance Department. After the Armistice, Hillyer worked as a military courier for the 1919 peace conference in Paris. For a while Hillyer and John Dos Passos shared a flat in Paris and even collaborated on an unpublished novel which they called &quot;Great Novel&quot; (or &quot;G.N.&quot;, or &quot;Seven Times round the Walls of Jericho&quot;). Eventually the novel was abandoned in 1921 even though Dos Passos said that Hillyer&#x27;s contributions had &quot;genuineness&quot; and &quot;more &quot;tone&quot; than mine.&quot;

== Career ==

=== Academic ===
Hillyer became a professor of English at Harvard University in 1919. In the late 1920s, he taught at Trinity College and was made a member of the Epsilon chapter of the literary fraternity St. Anthony Hall in 1927.

From 1937 to 1944, he was named to the Boylston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard. From 1948 to 1951 Hillyer was a visiting professor at Kenyon College. He also taught at the University of Delaware from 1952 until his death. While at Delaware Hillyer did various regular poetry readings between 1953-1960 which were recorded and are now available for listening through the university&#x27;s archives.

Over his academic life, Hillyer taught a number of writers (and poets) who later became well-known such as Theodore Roethke, James Gould Cozzens, Howard Nemerov, James Agee, Norman Mailer, Robert Fitzgerald and John Simon.

=== Poet ===
In 1919, Hillyer described himself as “a conservative and religious poet in a radical and blasphemous age.&quot; In 1934, he received a Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his book &quot;The Collected Verse of Robert Hillyer&quot;. His work is in meter and often rhyme and he tended to write about death, love and nature. He is known for his sonnets and for poems such as &quot;Theme and Variations&quot; (on his war experiences) and the light &quot;Letter to Robert Frost.&quot;

He became president of the Conservative Poetry Society of America. In this capacity, he attacked modernist poets such as T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound.

<text>Douglas Anthony Mirabelli (born October 18, 1970) is an American former Major League Baseball catcher. He played for the San Francisco Giants (1996–2000), Texas Rangers (2001), Boston Red Sox (2001–2005), and San Diego Padres (2006) before returning to the Red Sox (2006–2007) to end his 11-year career. He batted and threw right-handed.

Mirabelli was a career .231 hitter with 58 home runs and 206 runs batted in in 566 games. While with the Red Sox, he was well-known as the personal catcher for knuckleballer Tim Wakefield. He was part of the Red Sox&#x27; World Series championship teams in 2004 and 2007.

==High school and college==
After leading Valley High School in his hometown of Las Vegas to two state baseball titles, Mirabelli was originally selected by the Detroit Tigers in the sixth Round (159th overall) of the 1989 Major League Baseball amateur draft, but did not sign. Instead, Mirabelli chose to attend Wichita State University. In 1990, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Hyannis Mets and was named a league all-star.

In 1992, Mirabelli was selected by the San Francisco Giants in the 5th round (131st overall) of the Major League Baseball amateur draft. He signed a contract with the club on June 24, 1992.

==Minor leagues==
Mirabelli began his minor league career in 1992 with the San Jose Giants in the California League. Over the next four seasons, he also spent time with the Giants&#x27; Double-A club, the Shreveport Captains, and their Triple-A team, the Fresno Grizzlies .

In 1996, Mirabelli impressed starting in Double-A, hitting .295 with 21 home runs and 70 runs batted in, which earned a late season promotion to Triple-A. He bounced back to the Double-A level before earning a promotion to the major leagues in August of that year. Mirabelli made his major league debut on August 23, 1996, against the Philadelphia Phillies.

==Major Leagues==
===San Francisco Giants: 1996–2000===
In the late 1990s, the Giants teams often utilized a platoon at the catcher position, relying on different veterans to split time for most of the season. When Mirabelli reached the majors, he saw limited time and spent most of his season in Triple-A with Phoenix. In 1999, he finally made the promotion to the majors permanent when he split time with veterans Brent Mayne and Scott Servais.

The following season, Mirabelli platooned with Bobby Estalella, but neither catcher hit above .230 or played well enough to earn the starting job.

===Texas Rangers: 2001===
During spring training of 2001, the Giants signed veteran catcher Benito Santiago, who took over the starting role. Mirabelli&#x27;s contract was sold to the Texas Rangers, who made him the backup to All-Star catcher Iván Rodríguez. Mirabelli struggled, barely hitting above .100.

===Boston Red Sox: 2001–2005===
After Boston Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek&#x27;s season was ended by a broken left elbow on June 7, 2001, the Red Sox acquired Mirabelli on June 12 in a trade with the Texas Rangers. He split time with Scott Hatteberg for the rest of the season. Mirabelli hit .270 with 9 home runs for the Red Sox in 2001.

After the season, Hatteberg signed as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics and, in 2002, Mirabelli found himself as the designated catcher for veteran pitchers Darren Oliver and Frank Castillo. However, neither one lasted in the rotation. Mirabelli soon found himself partnered with knuckleballer Tim Wakefield. On July 23, 2002, Wakefield returned to the starting rotation, after serving as a reliever for most of the season; Mirabelli made the start at catcher. The partnership seemed to work as Wakefield went 8–2 down the stretch, with Mirabelli catching for him each time.

Over the next three seasons, Wakefield and Mirabelli became an effective battery. As Wakefield solidified himself in the starting rotation, Mirabelli made almost every start for him, as well as spot starts in relief of Varitek. Offensively, Mirabelli provided an occasional spark; he would become the only player in Major League Baseball history to hit six or more home runs in six consecutive seasons of fewer than 200 at-bats (from 2001 to 2006).

Mirabelli was the starting catcher in Game 1 of the 2004 World Series, as Wakefield was named the starting pitcher. He batted 1-for-3 with a run scored as the Red Sox went on to win 11–9, and eventually sweep the St. Louis Cardinals.

In 2005, Mirabelli hit .228 and struck out in more than a third of his at-bats. He also missed nearly a month due to a left wrist injury. Following the season, the Red Sox traded Mirabelli to the San Diego Padres for second baseman Mark Loretta.

===San Diego Padres: 2006===
For the first time in his major league career, Mirabelli was going to be given a chance to be a starting catcher. However, in early February, General Manager Kevin Towers decided to sign veteran catcher Mike Piazza and installed him as the starter instead. Mirabelli made just a handful of starts, hitting .182 with no runs batted in through April. Upset over Piazza&#x27;s arrival and his subsequent lack of playing time, Mirabelli asked Towers to work out a deal that would send him back to Boston.

===Return to Boston: 2006–2007===

Mirabelli was reacquired by the Red Sox on May 1, 2006, in exchange for catcher Josh Bard, setup man Cla Meredith, and $100,000 cash. This reacquisition occurred because Bard had trouble catching Tim Wakefield&#x27;s knuckleball, committing 10 passed balls in 7 games. The day the trade occurred, the Red Sox were to play their first game of the year against their rivals, the New York Yankees, at Fenway Park, and Wakefield was scheduled to start. It took a private jet and a Massachusetts State Police escort to get Mirabelli to the field in time. His plane from San Diego touched down at Logan Airport at 6:48 pm, he arrived at Fenway Park at 7:00 pm, and took his place behind the plate just in time for Wakefield&#x27;s opening pitch at 7:13 pm. In an effort to conserve every second possible, the Red Sox sent a uniform along with the police escort for Mirabelli to change into while en route to Fenway Park from the airport. A special glove (which is actually a woman&#x27;s softball catcher&#x27;s mitt) which Mirabelli had used in previous years to catch Wakefield had been left in Boston by Josh Bard for Mirabelli. Soon after, the Yankees admitted they had tried to acquire Mirabelli from the Padres in an attempt to keep him from the Red Sox .

On April 25, 2007, while Boston was visiting the Baltimore Orioles in the teams&#x27; first match up of the season, a controversy arose when Orioles&#x27; play-by-play announcer Gary Thorne alleged during the fifth inning of his telecast that Mirabelli had told him years ago that Curt Schilling&#x27;s bloody sock from the Red Sox&#x27;s 2004 championship run was only a publicity stunt. &quot;... That famous red stocking that he wore when they finally won, the blood on his stocking, nah. It was painted. Doug Mirabelli confessed up to it after. It was all for PR,&quot; said Thorne. Thorne&#x27;s comments were first reported on The Joy of Sox, a Red Sox blog. Mirabelli initially vehemently denied talking about the incident to Thorne, and the comments by both individuals rekindled a controversy on a national level which had been dormant for years. Although Red Sox management refused to comment on the situation, Mirabelli faced the media the following day to try to quell a situation that had clearly gotten out of hand. While also making a point to affirm that the substance on Schilling&#x27;s sock was undoubtedly his own blood, Mirabelli did acknowledge that there was likely a misunderstanding in a past dialogue with Thorne after the commentator had also admitted as much. Schilling&#x27;s bloody sock now resides in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Mirabelli hit under .200 for the rest of the season and battled an ankle injury late in the year; Wakefield pitched just over .500 before suffering an injury in July and missing almost two months. Mirabelli re-signed with the Red Sox for the 2007 season, but his offense did not improve as he hit .202 and once again battled various leg injuries late in the year.

In January 2008, Mirabelli agreed in principle to a one-year contract to return to the Red Sox for the 2008 season. The deal was reported to have a base salary of $550,000 with incentives. However, on March 13, 2008, Mirabelli was released by the Red Sox when the team elected to use Kevin Cash as its backup catcher.

==Coaching career==
On January 5, 2009, Mirabelli was named the new head baseball coach at St. Francis High School in Traverse City, Michigan.

On September 9, 2015, Mirabelli was named Florida Gators softball volunteer assistant coach.

==Personal life==
Mirabelli became an evangelical Christian in 1993.

Mirabelli and his wife Kristin have two daughters, Molly and Emma, and one son, Joseph. He graduated from Valley High School in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1989. As of March 2009, Mirabelli works as a realtor for Coldwell Banker Schmidt Realtors in Traverse City, Michigan.

<doc id="900325" wikidata="Q7435788" url="?curid=900325" title="Scots Musical Museum">
<text>The Scots Musical Museum was an influential collection of traditional folk music of Scotland published from 1787 to 1803. While it was not the first collection of Scottish folk songs and music, the six volumes with 100 songs in each collected many pieces, introduced new songs, and brought many of them into the classical music repertoire.

The project started with James Johnson, a struggling music engraver / music seller, with a love of old Scots songs and a determination to preserve them. In the winter of 1786 he met Robert Burns who was visiting Edinburgh for the first time, and found that Burns shared this interest and would become an enthusiastic contributor. The first volume was published in 1787 and included three songs by Burns. He contributed 40 songs to volume 2, and would end up responsible for about a third of the 600 songs in the whole collection as well as making a considerable editorial contribution. The final volume was published in 1803 and contained the first printing of Handsome Nell, Burns&#x27; first song.

As well as collecting old songs, Burns wrote new words to old tunes, and many of the songs now attributed to Burns have older roots. Songs in the collection include &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;, &quot;Lord Ronald, my Son&quot; (better known as &quot;Lord Randal&quot;) and &quot;My love is like a Red, Red Rose&quot;. Burns&#x27; songs include &quot;The Battle of Sherramuir&quot;, &quot;Scots Wha Hae&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Flow Gently Sweet Afton&quot;, &quot;Ye Banks and Braes of Bonnie Doon&quot;, &quot;Ae Fond Kiss&quot;, &quot;The Winter it is Past&quot;, &quot;Comin&#x27; Thro the Rye&quot;, &quot;There Grows a Bonnie Brier Bush&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

The earliest issues of the ‘Museum’ did not identify the songs that were by Burns as in 1787 his fame had yet to imbed itself, however in later issues his name was appended to his contributions in the index and the text often had the declaration &quot;Written for this Work by Robert Burns.&quot; Therefore the fewer songs ascribed to Burns in an issue, the earlier the issue. 

The &#x27;Museum&#x27; was issued totally uncut, in plain boards and without any lettering. The earliest version of the title-page does not have a border around the vignette. Later versions have a border and a thistle design is present at the top and bottom. 

The collection became popular internationally, and songs and tunes were arranged by composers such as Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven. Burns collaborated with George Thomson in &quot;A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs&quot;, published from 1793 to 1818, which adapted Scottish folk-songs with &quot;classical&quot; arrangements. While this brought songs to new audiences, many of the songs and tunes continued in the folk tradition, both in Scotland and America.

The American collector John Gribbel was at one time in possession of Robert Burns&#x27;s Interleaved Scots Musical Museum, the first four volumes of Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Scots Musical Museum&quot; interleaved with some 140 pages of Robert Burns&#x27;s explanatory notes on the 184 songs that he contributed. These volumes had long been in the possession of the Riddell family of Friars Carse in Nithsdale. These notes have provided many insights into the authorship and editing of the songs he contributed.

<text>Krste Petkov Misirkov (, ; ; ; 18 November 1874 – 26 July 1926) was a philologist, journalist, historian and ethnographer from the region of Macedonia.

In the period between 1903 and 1905, he published a book and a scientific magazine in which he affirmed the existence of a Macedonian national identity separate from other Balkan nations, and attempted to codify a standard Macedonian language based on the central Western Macedonian dialects. A survey conducted in the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia) found Misirkov to be &quot;the most significant Macedonian of the 20th century&quot;. For his efforts to codify a standard Macedonian language, he is often considered &quot;the founder of the modern Macedonian literary language&quot;. 

On the other hand, he was one of the founders of the pro-Bulgarian Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Circle established in 1900 in St. Petersburg. In 1905 he began publishing predominantly articles, written from a Bulgarian nationalist perspective in the IMARO-affiliated press. In his diary written during the Balkan Wars, he espoused pro-Bulgarian views. During the First World War, he became a member of the local parliament in Bessarabia as a representative of the Bulgarian minority there. During the 1920s he encouraged the Macedonian Slavs to adopt a Bulgarian national identity. Misirkov returned to Macedonian nationalism for a period in 1914 and again in 1924 and 1925. Misirkov died in 1926 and was buried in the Sofia Central Cemetery with the financial support from the Ministry of Education, as an honoured Bulgarian educator.

Because Misirkov expressed conflicting views about the national identity of the Macedonian Slavs at different points in his life, his national affiliation and legacy remain a matter of dispute between Bulgaria and North Macedonia. While Misirkov&#x27;s work and personality remain highly controversial and disputed, there have been attempts among international scholars to reconcile the conflicting and self-contradictory statements made by Misirkov. According to historian Ivo Banac, Misirkov viewed both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia as Bulgarians, and espoused pan-Bulgarian patriotism in a larger Balkan context. However, in the context of the larger Bulgarian unit/nation, Misirkov sought both cultural and national differentiation from the other Bulgarians and called both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia, Macedonians.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Krste Petkov Misirkov was born on 18 November 1874 in the village of Postol in the Salonica vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (present-day Pella, Greece). He started his elementary education in the local Greek school, where he studied until the sixth grade, but the bad financial situation of his family could not support his further education at that point and he left the school. At that period, the Serbian government began to promote efforts to espouse a pro-Serbian Macedonian nationalism and to recruit young people in order to &quot;Serbianize&quot; them. After some period, Misirkov applied and was granted a scholarship by a Serbian association, &quot;The Society of St. Sava&quot;.

=== Misirkov in Serbia and Bulgaria ===
For a period, Misirkov studied in Serbia. Soon after he realized that the promotion of pro-Serbian ideas and propaganda was the main goal of the education provided by the Society of St. Sava. The politics practiced by the association forced Misirkov and the other Macedonian students to participate in a students protest and revolt against the Society of St. Sava. As a result, Misirkov and other companions moved from Belgrade to Sofia. He then faced a similar situation in Bulgaria, this time being confronted with pro-Bulgarian propaganda. Misirkov again went to Serbia to continue his education, but without any success as he was rejected by the Society of St. Sava, most likely for his part in the protests conducted against it. Since he was willing to get higher education, he was forced, by a chain of events, to enroll in a theological school for teachers. Similar to the Society of St. Sava, this school as well had its own propagandistic goals which resulted in another revolt of the students. As a result of it, the school ended its programs and the students were sent throughout Serbia. Misirkov was sent to Šabac, where he finished his fourth secondary education course, but this time in the local gymnasium, which happened to be his last course. In both Serbia and Bulgaria, Misirkov and his friend were treated as Serbs or Bulgarians in order to be accepted in the educational system. After the gymnasium, even though he graduated, Misirkov enrolled in another secondary school for teachers in Belgrade, where he graduated in 1895. During this time, particularly in 1893, Misirkov became a member of an association of Macedonian students called &quot;Vardar&quot;.

=== Misirkov in the Russian Empire ===
His qualifications obtained in Belgrade were not recognized in Russia. Misirkov had to study from the very beginning in the Seminary at Poltava. In 1897, he was able to enter the Saint Petersburg Imperial University. Here he entered at first in the Bulgarian Students Association and the Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Circle. Misirkov wrote about that part of his life in the article &quot;School and socialism&quot; &quot;– In 1897 I went to Petrograd University and for five years was among the Bulgarian studentship as Bulgarian and member of the Bulgarian Student Society.&quot; Misirkov carried out here his first scholarly lecture on the ethnography and history of the Balkan Peninsula before the members of the Russian Imperial Geographical Society.

On November 15, 1900, Misirkov, a third-year student in the Faculty of History and Philosophy at the time, and other students in Russia created a students&#x27; circle in Saint Petersburg. The main objective of the circle was the political autonomy of the Macedonia and Thrace, declared by IMRO, and implemented and guaranteed by the Great Powers. In a letter sent to the President of the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee on 28 November of the same year, the founders of the circle stated that, &quot;&quot;there&#x27;s no Bulgarian who is not interested in the situation and fate of that part of our homeland, which continue to groan under the yoke of the tyrant&quot;.&quot; At that time, Misirkov considered the Slavic peoples of Macedonia and Thrace as Bulgarian. He graduated in 1902.


Later Misirkov abandoned the university and left for Ottoman Macedonia.

=== Return to Ottoman Macedonia ===
Facing financial obstacles to continue his postgraduate education, he accepted the proposal of the Bulgarian Exarchate to be appointed teacher in one of the high schools in Bitola. There he befriended the Russian consul in Bitola. He began to plan the opening of local schools and publishing textbooks in Macedonian, but the Ilinden Uprising in 1903 and the assassination of the Russian Consul changed his plans and he soon returned to Russia. In Russia, Misirkov published different articles about the Ilinden Uprising and the justifications and causes as to why the Consul was assassinated. Soon afterwards, he wrote the book &quot;On Macedonian Matters&quot; and published it in Sofia. Misirkov attacked the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), among others, as a Bulgarian creation. As a result, he was persecuted by IMRO, and it is believed that its members destroyed a sizable amount of copies of his book.

=== Return to Russian Empire ===
In 1905, he left Saint Petersburg for Berdiansk. There, he resumed publication of the journal &quot;Vardar&quot; and was given a post as assistant master in a grammar school. In this period, Misirkov halted his advocation of Macedonian separatism and opposed the Serbian position on the Macedonian Question. After 1905, he published pro-Bulgarian articles and even categorically renounced the point of his book &quot;On Macedonian Matters&quot;, although this behavior might have been caused by the many threats made towards him warning him to stop fighting for Macedonian separatism from Bulgaria. On 18 April 1907, Misirkov began to cooperate with the Sofia magazine &quot;Macedonian-Adrianople Review&quot;, edited by Nikola Naumov, which was &quot;de facto&quot; organ of the IMRO. On 24 April 1909, in Odessa, Misirkov printed his work about the South Slavic epic legends on Krali Marko. On 1 October 1909, he printed the article, &quot;The foundations of a Serbian-Bulgarian rapprochement&quot; in the magazine, &quot;&quot;Bulgarian Collection&quot;,&quot; edited by Bulgarian diplomats and officials in St. Petersburg. During this period, a Slavic Festival was held in Sofia in 1910 with Misirkov invited to attend as its guest of honor. In 1910–1911, he translated the book of the Bulgarian geographer Prof. Atanas Ishirkov, &quot;Bulgaria&quot; from Bulgarian to Russian.

When the First Balkan War had begun, Misirkov went to Macedonia as a Russian war correspondent. In Macedonia, he could follow the military operations of the Bulgarian Army. Misirkov published some articles in the Russian press demanding that the Ottomans be driven out of Macedonia. In 1913 after the outbreak of the Second Balkan War, Misirkov went back to Russia, where he worked as a teacher in the Bulgarian language schools in Odessa. Later, he was appointed as a teacher of the Bulgarian language school in Chișinău. While working as a teacher in Chișinău, Misirkov sent а letter to the Bulgarian academic Aleksandar Teodorov-Balan with a request to be assigned as a professor at Sofia University. That request clearly indicates his self-identification at that time: &quot;As a Bulgarian, I would willingly return to Bulgaria, if there is a need of a scientific research of the fate of the Bulgarian lands, especially Macedonia.&quot;..&quot; A shorter letter with similar content was sent to another professor at Sofia University – Vasil Zlatarski with the request to be assigned as a chosen &quot;at the newly established department for history of Macedonia and the other western Bulgarian lands&quot;.

At that point, Misirkov made contacts with the Macedonian Scientific and Literary Society, which started publishing the journal, &quot;Makedonski glas&quot; (Macedonian Voice) in Russian. Misirkov published in this magazine for some period under the pseudonym &quot;K. Pelski&quot;. Misirkov defended and wrote about Macedonian ideals which, according to him, were in contrast with Bulgarian ideals and the general Bulgarian populace.

After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Bessarabia became a democratic republic, and he was elected a member of the local parliament Sfatul Țării as a representative of the Bulgarian minority. At the same time, Misirkov worked as a secretary in the Bulgarian educational commission in Bessarabia. In March 1918, unification between Bessarabia and Romania was declared. On 21 May 1918, Misirkov openеd a Bulgarian language course in Bolhrad. Misirkov proceeded to take a clandestine trip to Bulgaria in order to procure textbooks for the students, but after his return in November, he was arrested by the Kingdom of Romania authorities, still at war with Bulgaria and was extradited to Bulgaria.

=== Last years in Bulgaria ===

After being expelled by the Romanian authorities, Misirkov returned to Sofia at the end of 1918, where he spent one year as a head of the Historical Department of the National Museum of Ethnography. He proceeded to work as a teacher and director of the high schools in Karlovo and Koprivshtitsa. During this period (but before 1923), IMRO marked Misirkov as harmful to its cause and supposedly considering his assassination, but reconsidered after he met with a representative of the organization. In this period, Misirkov also advocated a Bulgarian identity for the Macedonians. He also resumed his journalistic activity and published many articles on the Macedonian Question in the Bulgarian press and in some of them expressed Macedonian national ideas. Misirkov died in 1926 and was buried in the graveyards in Sofia with the financial support of 5000 levs from the Ministry of Education, as an honored educator.

==Works==
In his life, Misirkov wrote one book, one diary, published one issue of a magazine and wrote more than thirty articles. His book &quot;On the Macedonian Matters&quot; was published in Sofia in 1903. The magazine was called &quot;Vardar&quot; and was published in 1905 in Odessa, Russian Empire. The articles that Misirkov wrote were published in different newspapers and focused on different topics. The book, magazine and a number of his article were written in the Central Macedonian dialects, which are the basis of Modern Macedonian.

=== &quot;On the Macedonian Matters&quot; ===

One of the most important works of Misirkov is the Macedonian book &quot;On the Macedonian Matters&quot; (Original: ) published in 1903 in Sofia, in which he laid down the principles of modern Macedonian. This book was written in the Macedonian dialects from the area between Prilep and Bitola. It argued in favor of national separation, the establishment of autonomous national institutions within the Ottoman Empire, and the standardization of a distinct Macedonian language. Misirkov attacked both the Bulgarian Exarchate and the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) as agents of the Bulgarian interests in Macedonia. According to this book and Misirkov himself, the Macedonian literary language should be based on dialects from the central part of Macedonia, which were used in the book itself. Furthermore, Misirkov appealed to the Ottoman authorities for eventual recognition of a separate Macedonian nation. Misirkov admitted that there was no Macedonian nation, but argued that it should be created, when the necessary historical circumstances would arise.

=== &quot;Vardar&quot; magazine ===
Misirkov was the author and editor of the first scientific magazine in Macedonian. The magazine &quot;Vardar&quot; was published in 1905 in Odessa, Russian Empire. The magazine was published only once, because of the financial problems that Misirkov had been facing with at that time. He expressed views about the national distinctiveness of the Macedonians. According to Blaže Ristovski, its orthography was almost the same as the orthography of standard Macedonian. The magazine was meant to include several different scientific disciplines, mostly concerned with Macedonia.

=== Articles ===

During his life, Misirkov published many articles for different newspapers and magazines. The articles deal with Macedonia, Macedonian culture, ethnology, politics and nation on one hand and with the Bulgarian nation, politics and ethnography on the other. Misirkov published his articles in Macedonian, Russian and Bulgarian and he published them either in Russia or in Bulgaria. Most of the articles were signed by his birth name, but there are articles that are signed with his pseudonym &quot;K. Pelski&quot;.

=== Diary ===
In 2006, a handwritten diary by Misirkov written during his stay in Russia in 1913 was discovered. It was declared authentic by Bulgarian and Macedonian experts and was published in 2008. The content of the diary clearly shows that at the time, Misirkov identified himself as a Macedonian Bulgarian and had a clear pro-Bulgarian stance. It has given rise to new public discussion over Misirkov&#x27;s stances on Bulgarian and Macedonian ethnicity. Per academic Alexis Heraclides, Misirkov&#x27;s stance was not clear-cut and he sounded Macedonian at times too. The manuscript includes 381 pages written in the Russian language. Misirkov wrote it in Kotovsk&#x27;s nearby village of Klimentove, where he lived and worked at the time. It also contains articles and excerpts from the Russian press from that time.

=== Dialectology and ethnography ===
In several publications, Misirkov made an attempt to determine the border between the Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian language, including in the Bulgarian dialect area, nearly all of Torlakian and Macedonian dialects. Misirkov pointed there, that the population in Pomoravlje is autochthonous and Bulgarian by origin, excluding any later migrations during the Ottoman rule from Bulgaria.
According to Krste Misirkov, Krali Marko epic songs in Serbia, the so-called &quot;Bugarstici&quot; are a result from Bulgarian musical influence over the Serbian folk music.

==Legacy==
During the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the idea of a separate Macedonian ethnicity was as of yet promoted by small circles of intellectuals. Then, most of the Slavic people in Macedonia considered themselves Bulgarian, as part of the Bulgarian Millet, and Macedonian separatist ideas failed to gain wide popular support. At different points in his life, Misirkov expressed conflicting statements about the ethnicity of the Slavs living in Macedonia, including his own ethnicity. According to Ivo Banac, Misirkov viewed himself and the Slavs of Macedonia as Bulgarians, and espoused pan-Bulgarian patriotism, but in the context of the larger Bulgarian nation, Misirkov sought cultural and national differentiation, separating the Macedonians. Misirkov&#x27;s ideas had a small impact in his own time and he was re-discovered in the post-WW2 era.

===View of Misirkov in Bulgaria===
In Bulgaria, Misirkov is regarded as a controversial educator with scientific contribution to Bulgarian dialectology and ethnography. He graduated from the Belgrade University as a student of Prof. Stojan Novaković and was influenced by his ideas. At that time, Novaković was a prominent proponent of the Macedonism, thereby promoting Serbian interests in the region of Macedonia. Afterwards Misirkov met several times with him and Novaković&#x27;s diplomatic activity in St. Petersburg played significant role for the foundation of the Macedonian Scientific and Literary Society. However, Misirkov later developed a kind of &quot;Serbophobia&quot;. He also argued that the Slavic population of Macedonia was not &quot;a formless paste&quot; but a &quot;well baked Bulgarian bread&quot;. Bulgarian historians believe that the post-WWII Yugoslavian Communist regime significantly altered his writings to support the notion of a &quot;Macedonian nation&quot;, distinct from the Bulgarian one. According to Bulgarian observers, after the breakup of Yugoslavia, polemics have also arisen in the Republic of Macedonia about the identity of Misirkov.

===View of Misirkov in North Macedonia===
In North Macedonia, Misirkov is regarded as the most prominent Macedonian publicist, philologist and linguist who set the principles of the standard Macedonian in the early 20th century. Misirkov is also the author of the first scientific magazine in Macedonian and because of his contributions to the Macedonian national cause, he has been widely regarded as the greatest Macedonian of the 20th century by the Macedonian public. After World War II, the new Macedonian historiography started to regard Misirkov&#x27;s persona highly. His work and ideas became a major field of exploration for scholars from the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, who used them to support the claim that there was a Macedonian national consciousness in the 19th century. In his honor, many books and scientific works have been published and the Institute for Macedonian language &quot;Krste Misirkov&quot; is named after him.

There is a debate about Misirkov&#x27;s ethnicity in North Macedonia issued by Dr. Rastislav Terzioski, who brought to light memos from Russian archives which clearly stated his pro-Bulgarian positions. The publication of his 1913 diary, which revealed his pro-Bulgarian views, sparked a major controversy in Skopje. The Social Democratic Union of Macedonia even called for the dismissal of Zoran Todorovski, who was then director of the State Archives of Macedonia. Regarding Misirkov&#x27;s signature as a &quot;Macedonian Bulgarian&quot;, the Macedonian historians and linguists argue that it means a Macedonian person with a Bulgarian citizenship. On the other hand, according to Vlado Popovski, Misirkov&#x27;s usage of the term &quot;Macedonian Bulgarian&quot; was only a tactic as a consequence of the Balkan wars and the Bucharest Agreement. In 1914 and many times after that, he repeated his views about the Macedonian national existence.
