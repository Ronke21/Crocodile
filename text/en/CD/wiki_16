<text>Adamastor is a mythological character created by the Portuguese poet Luís de Camões in his epic poem &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; (first printed in 1572), as a personification of the Cape of Good Hope, symbolizing the dangers of the sea and the formidable forces of nature challenged and ultimately overcome by the Portuguese during the Age of Discovery. Adamastor manifests itself out of a storm. 

==Background==
Camões gave his creation a backstory as one of the Giants of Greek mythology, banished to the Cape of Good Hope by sea goddess Doris for falling in love with her daughter Tethis, now appearing out of a storm cloud and threatening to ruin anyone hardy enough to attempt passing the Cape and penetrate the Indian Ocean, which was Adamastor&#x27;s domain. Adamastor became the spirit of the Cape of Good Hope, a hideous phantom of unearthly pallor:
Vasco da Gama, ahead of the Portuguese expedition, confronts the creature by asking &quot;Who are you?&quot;, prompting Adamastor to tell his story. 

Deeply moved, the giant eventually vanishes, dispersing the clouds and calming the sea, leaving the path towards India open.

Adamastor represented the dangers Portuguese sailors faced when trying to round the Cape of Storms – &quot;Cabo das Tormentas&quot; – henceforth called the Cape of Good Hope.

==Legacy==
A popular gathering place in Lisbon is known by the name &#x27;Adamastor&#x27; because of the large stone statue of the mythical figure which presides over the space, which is officially called the Miradouro de Santa Catarina. The location offers visitors some of the most scenic views of the Tagus river, the 25 de Abril Bridge and the Cristo-Rei monument.

The Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa included in his 1934 book &quot;Mensagem&quot; a number of verses dedicated to Adamastor, entitled &quot;O Mostrengo&quot; (&quot;The Hideous Monster&quot;)

Adamastor, both the mythological character and the sculpture, are mentioned several times in José Saramago&#x27;s Nobel Prize-winning novel, &quot;The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis&quot;, and also in his historical novel &quot;Memorial do Convento&quot; (English language version: &quot;Baltasar and Blimunda&quot;).

Adamastor has figured in much poetry of the Cape. In &quot;The First Life of Adamastor&quot;, a novella by André Brink, the writer refashioned the Adamastor story from a 20th-century perspective.

Adamastor is also mentioned in the opera &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot; (1865) about Vasco da Gama by the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer. The slave Nelusko sings a song about Adamastor while he deliberately steers the ship into a storm and it sinks.

It is mentioned by Voltaire in his &quot;Essai sur la poésie épique&quot;. It also appears in the works of Victor Hugo: &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (III, Marius, chap III) and in a poem dedicated to Lamartine (&quot;Les Feuilles d&#x27;automne&quot;, chap IX). Alexandre Dumas, père refers the giant six times: &quot;Le Comte de Monte Cristo&quot; (chap. XXXI), &quot;Vingt ans après&quot; (chap. LXXVII), &quot;Georges&quot; (chap. I), &quot;Bontekoe, Les drames de la mer&quot;, (chap. I), &quot;Causeries&quot; (chap. IX) and &quot;Mes Mémoires&quot; (chap. CCXVIII). Gaston Leroux also mentions it in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (chap. VI). Herman Melville mentions Adamastor and Camões in his &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, at the end of Chapter VII.

Adamastor is also the name of a sauropod dinosaur, &quot;Angolatitan adamastor&quot;, found in Angola, named by the paleontologist Octávio Mateus.

==Etymology==
The name Adamastor is an adaptation for the Portuguese language from the Greek word for &quot;Untamed&quot; or &quot;Untameable&quot; (&quot;Adamastos&quot;) (which the Portuguese did tame).

<text>Lancaster Cathedral, also known as The Cathedral Church of St Peter and Saint Peter&#x27;s Cathedral, is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Lancaster, Lancashire, England. It was a Roman Catholic parish church until 1924, when it was elevated to the status of a cathedral. It started as a mission church in 1798, and the present church was built on a different site in 1857–59. It was designed by E. G. Paley in the Gothic Revival style and is a grade II* listed building. In 1901 a baptistry was added by Austin and Paley, and the east end was reordered in 1995 by Francis Roberts. The cathedral is in active use, arranging services, concerts and other events, and is open to visitors.

==History==

Until the passing of the Roman Catholic Relief Act in 1791 Lancaster&#x27;s Roman Catholics met in a makeshift chapel in St Leonardsgate. Building the first Catholic church in the town began with the laying of the foundation stone for the Lancaster Catholic Mission in Dalton Square on 13 March 1798. The chapel was consecrated during the following year. By the middle of the 19th century, there was a need for a larger church. Land for this was purchased on a different site near to the mission church, and the parish church dedicated to Saint Peter was built. It was designed by the local architect E. G. Paley. Before the church was built, Paley had already designed schools, a convent, and a presbytery which were built on this land. Tenders for the church were invited in March 1857, the foundation stone was laid on 29 April, and the new church was consecrated on 4 October 1859 by Dr Alexander Goss, the bishop of Liverpool. The church and its associated buildings cost a total of £15,000 (£ in 2015), of which £2,000 was bequeathed by Thomas Coulston. During future years, additions and alterations were made to the church by Paley and his future partner in the practice, Hubert Austin, and by his own son Henry Paley. These included the addition of a font in 1860, an organ gallery in 1888, chancel stalls in 1899, and a new baptistry in 1901; the baptistry cost £4,000 (£ in 2015).

The golden jubilee of the church was celebrated in 1909, and a number of alterations were made under the direction of Giles Gilbert Scott. These included a new altar, replacement of the tiles on the floor by black and white marble, re-flooring of the nave, painting the walls, and replacing the pine benches by oak pews. In 1924 the Diocese of Lancaster was created and the church was elevated to the status of a cathedral. The cathedra (bishop&#x27;s throne) was placed in the chancel. When the centenary was celebrated in 1959, the pipe organ was refurbished, and the painted Stations of the Cross were replaced by a set of carvings. Since then, there have been further minor changes to the interior of the cathedral, and in 1995 the east end was reordered by Francis Roberts.

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The cathedral is constructed in sandstone ashlar, with roofs of slate, other than the baptistry which is roofed in copper. The architectural style is Gothic Revival. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, aisles and transepts, a two-bay chancel with aisles, side chapels, and a semi-octagonal apse. The steeple stands at the northeast corner, and the octagonal baptistry is attached to the north transept. The steeple consists of a tower with a spire rising to a height of . The tower is in four stages that are separated by string courses, and it has a stair turret at the northwest corner. On the west side of the bottom stage of the tower is a gabled north porch, above which is a canopied niche containing a statue of St Peter, and a three-light window. On each side of the second stage is a row of six arches, the central two arches containing windows, and on each side of the third stage is a small window. The top stage contains paired bell openings, and at the corner of the parapet are pinnacles. The spire is recessed, and has three tiers of lucarnes. At the west end of the church is a doorway, above which is a five-light window containing Geometric tracery. Along the sides of the aisles are three-light windows with Decorated tracery. In the north transept is a four-light window with Geometric tracery, and the south transept contains a ten-light wheel window surrounded by ten circular windows. In the apse are three-light windows containing decorated tracery.

===Interior===
Inside the cathedral are six-bay north and south arcades, and a west gallery carried on marble piers. Along the sides are chapels and confessionals. The Lady Chapel is at the northeast of the cathedral. The former sanctuary has been converted into the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, which has paintings on its walls. To the west of the chapel, behind the high altar, is a large reredos designed by Scott; this consists of a triptych containing paintings and carvings. The baptistry contains a central marble font, an altar with a reredos, and stained glass windows by Shrigley and Hunt. There is more stained glass by the same firm elsewhere in the cathedral, and other windows are by Hardman. Also in the church are monuments, one dating from about 1860 by Richard Westmacott, junior. The original organ in St Peter&#x27;s was moved from the mission church in Dalton Square. This was replaced in 1889 by a new, three-manual organ by Henry Ainscough of Preston. Alterations were made to it in 1976 by Pendlebury of Cleveleys. As of 2012 it is being restored by Henry Willis and Sons of Liverpool. There is a ring of ten bells. Eight of these were cast in 1879 by John Warner and Sons, the other two in 1948 by Mears and Stainbank at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.
==Assessment==
St Peter&#x27;s was designated as a Grade II* listed building on 10 November 1994. Grade II* buildings are defined as being &quot;particularly important buildings of more than special interest&quot;; only 5.5% of the listed buildings are included in this grade. In the &quot;Buildings of England&quot; series, Hartwell and Pevsner express the opinion that the church is the &quot;chef d&#x27;oeuvre&quot; of Paley&#x27;s works. They also describe the baptistry as being a &quot;tour de force&quot;. In his book about the architectural practice of Sharpe, Paley and Austin, Brandwood expresses the opinion that the building is &quot;Paley&#x27;s masterwork as an independent church architect&quot;.

==Today==

The building is in active use as a Roman Catholic cathedral, which arranges Masses and other regular services, and organises concerts and other events. The cathedral is open daily to visitors, and arranges group and educational visits.

==Early career==
Murray was born in Limerick on 27 June 1943. He was educated at Crescent College, Limerick, Rockwell College, County Tipperary, University College Dublin, and the Honorable Society of King&#x27;s Inns. He was twice elected President of the Union of Students in Ireland in 1966/67. He qualified as a barrister in 1967 and had a successful law practice dealing with commercial, civil, and constitutional law.

==Attorney General==
Murray was Attorney General of Ireland under the Fianna Fáil government from 17 August to 14 December 1982. The Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, appointed him as Attorney General after his predecessor, Patrick Connolly, resigned abruptly over the GUBU scandal, when a murderer Malcolm McArthur was arrested in Connolly&#x27;s Dalkey flat.

His next term in office as Attorney General extended from 11 March 1987 to 25 September 1991. In 1988, he refused to allow the extradition of Fr. Patrick Ryan to Britain on explosives charges dealing with the Provisional IRA, on the basis that the trial he would be given would not be fair due to excessive media coverage and remarks made in Parliament by the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher which were considered prejudicial.

==Judicial career==
In 1991, he was appointed a Judge of the European Court of Justice serving until 1999, when he was appointed to the Irish Supreme Court.

Murray served on the Supreme Court from 1999. He was appointed Chief Justice of Ireland in 2004.

In 2011, Chief Justice Murray became involved in controversy with the Government over a proposal to amend the Constitution to allow the remuneration of judges to be reduced in parallel to the remuneration of public servants in State employment.

The criticisms of the Government&#x27;s plans were contained in a 12-page critique by Chief Justice Murray, and the President of the High Court, Nicholas Kearns, and published in the Court Services website, but subsequently redacted at the request of the Government.

He retired as Chief Justice in 2011, though he remained a member of the Supreme Court until 2015.

==Chancellor of the University of Limerick==
Murray was appointed Chancellor of the University of Limerick (and so also Chairman of UL&#x27;s Governing Authority) in 2013.

==Telephone tapping inquiry==
In January 2016, it was announced that the Minister for Justice and Equality had appointed Murray to conduct a review of the legislation allowing access to the phone records of journalists. Murray was asked to propose any legislative changes required and examine the legislation in other countries and examine best international practice in this area.

==Personal life and death==
Murray was married to Gabrielle Walsh, daughter of Brian Walsh, a former Supreme Court judge, described as &quot;one of Ireland&#x27;s greatest judges&quot; and the &quot;outstanding legal reforming mind of his generation&quot; by Prof. J. J. Lee.

His brother, Michael D. Murray, is the State Solicitor for Limerick City.

Murray died on 18 January 2023, at the age of 79.

<text>The Via Francigena () is an ancient road and pilgrimage route running from the cathedral city of Canterbury in England, through France and Switzerland, to Rome and then to Apulia, Italy, where there were ports of embarkation for the Holy Land. It was known in Italy as the &quot;Via Francigena&quot; (&quot;the road that comes from France&quot;) or the &quot;Via Romea Francigena&quot; (&quot;the road to Rome that comes from France&quot;). In medieval times it was an important road and pilgrimage route for those wishing to visit the Holy See and the tombs of the apostles Peter and Paul.

== History of the pilgrimage to Rome ==

In the Middle Ages, Via Francigena was the major pilgrimage route to Rome from the north. The route was first documented as the &quot;Lombard Way&quot;, and was first called the &quot;Iter Francorum&quot; (the &quot;Frankish Route&quot;) in the &quot;Itinerarium sancti Willibaldi&quot; of 725, a record of the travels of Willibald, bishop of Eichstätt in Bavaria. It was &quot;Via Francigena-Francisca&quot; in Italy and Burgundy, the &quot;Chemin des Anglois&quot; in the Frankish Kingdom (after the evangelisation of England in 607) and also the &quot;Chemin Romieu&quot;, the road to Rome. The name &quot;Via Francigena&quot; is first mentioned in the &quot;Actum Clusio&quot;, a parchment of 876 in the Abbey of San Salvatore at Monte Amiata (Tuscany).

At the end of the 10th century Sigeric, the Archbishop of Canterbury, used the Via Francigena to and from Rome in order to receive his pallium; he recorded his route and his stops on the return journey, but nothing in the document suggests that the route was then new, nor if he made the journey by foot or on horseback.

Later itineraries to Rome include the Leiðarvísir og borgarskipan of the Icelandic traveller Nikolás Bergsson (in 1154) and the one from Philip Augustus of France (in 1191). Two somewhat differing maps of the route appear in manuscripts of Matthew Paris, &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;, from the 13th century.

The Welsh king Rhodri Mawr in 880 and his grandson Hywel Dda in 945 are both known to have visited Rome towards the end of their lives, but it is not known whether they went by land or by sea via the Straits of Gibraltar. The Benedictine William of St-Thierry used the roads towards Rome on several occasions at the end of the 11th century. The return journey by sea was likely to be easier, thanks to the prevailing south-westerly winds, but tacking down to the Mediterranean would have made a very long journey indeed.

The Via Francigena was not a single road, like a Roman road, paved with stone blocks and provided at intervals with a change of horses for official travellers. Rather, it comprised several possible routes that changed over the centuries as trade and pilgrimage waxed and waned. Depending on the time of year, the political situation, and the relative popularity of the shrines of the saints situated along the route, travellers may have used any of three or four crossings of the Alps and the Apennine Mountains. The Lombards financed the maintenance and security of the section of road through their territories as a trading route to the north from Rome, avoiding enemy-held cities such as Florence. Unlike Roman roads, the Via Francigena did not connect cities but relied more on abbeys.

=== Sigeric&#x27;s itinerary ===
In around 990, Archbishop Sigeric journeyed from Canterbury to Rome and back, but only documented his itinerary on the return journey, taken in 80 stages averaging about a day, for a total of some .

Modern pilgrims from England would follow Sigeric&#x27;s route in the reverse order, and so would set off from the zero milestone in the South Porch of Canterbury Cathedral. Pilgrim passports are available from The Beaney Museum in Canterbury or from the information office of the Cathedral. Canons based at Canterbury Cathedral can also be arranged to offer blessings to pilgrims setting off on the journey. Modern pilgrims would then follow the route, walking out of Canterbury via St Martin&#x27;s Church, Canterbury, which is the oldest church in England still in use as a Church. Heading onwards, pilgrims pick up the first stamp in their pilgrim passport at the village church of St. Mary&#x27;s in Patrixbourne. It is possible to &quot;Champ&quot; and stay by arrangement at St. Mary&#x27;s. Heading on towards the English coast, pilgrims would travel through the Kentish villages of Womenswold and Woolage Green before arriving in Shepherdswell which is the end of the first stage (of 79 stages). The second stage continues to Dover via the Waldershare Park Estate and then joins the old Roman Road at Studdal outside Dover, to walk into the town. Pilgrims then cross the Channel to &quot;Sumeran&quot; (now called Sombres), landing at the village of Wissant. The route continues through Guînes (Sigeric&#x27;s Gisne), Thérouanne (Teranburh), Bruay (Bruaei), and Arras (Atherats), before continuing on to Reims, Châlons-sur-Marne, Bar-sur-Aube, Langres, Champlitte, Besançon, Pontarlier, Lausanne and Saint-Maurice. From Saint-Maurice, the route traverses the Great St. Bernard Pass to Aosta and then to Ivrea, Vercelli, Pavia, Fidenza, Pontremoli, Filattiera, Aulla, Luni, Lucca, San Gimignano, Poggibonsi, Siena, San Quirico d&#x27;Orcia, Bolsena, Viterbo, Sutri, and finally Rome.

== The final stretch towards the Apulian ports ==
From Rome, the path followed for a long stretch the Via Appia or the parallel Via Latina up to Benevento. From that town Via Traiana was taken up the Campanian Apennines and Daunian Mountains, where stood, a fortress held by the Knights of Jerusalem in order to guarantee the safety of pilgrims along the mountain stretch. The road, therefore, reached Troia, in the high plain of Tavoliere delle Puglie (where Via Francigena is attested since 1024), and then continued towards Bari, Brindisi and Otranto, the main ports of embarkation for the Holy Land.

== Today ==
Today some pilgrims still follow in Sigeric&#x27;s ancient footsteps and travel on foot, on horseback or by bicycle on the &quot;Via Francigena&quot;, although there are far fewer pilgrims on this route than on the Way of St. James pilgrims&#x27; route to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Roughly 50,000 pilgrims were estimated to have walked the Via Francigena in 2022. In 2011, James Saward-Anderson and Maxwell Hannah ran the entire route for Water Aid. They completed the route unassisted in 58 days.

=== Accommodation ===

Due to the scarcity of dedicated pilgrims&#x27; accommodation along the Via Francigena, pilgrims often camp out rather than stay in hotels or pensions. However, increasingly in Italy, some monasteries and religious houses offer dedicated pilgrim accommodation. These are called &quot;spedali&quot; and — like the &quot;refugios&quot; found on the Way of St. James in France and Spain — they offer cheap and simple dormitory-style accommodation. &quot;Spedali&quot; accept pilgrims who bear a valid &quot;credenziale&quot; (pilgrim&#x27;s passport), usually for one night only. Some places offer meals as well. In Kent, local churches often encourage pilgrims to &quot;Champ&quot; (camp in a church) and some of the churches along the Via Francigena have contacts on their website to allow pilgrims to arrange this. There is an accommodation list online which regularly updated and published by the Confraternity of Pilgrims to Rome 

As of 2016, the old guest houses dedicated to pilgrims were not reconditioned by tourist operators, due to the lack of economic return.

=== The state and path of the route ===
Only a few decades ago, interest in the Via Francigena was limited to scholars. This began to change in recent years when many who, after travelling the Way of St. James in Spain, wanted to make the pilgrimage to Rome on foot as well. In Italy, this gave birth to a network of lovers of the Via Francigena, who with paint and brush, began to mark its trails and paths. These people were joined by religious and local government agencies who also tried to recover the original route. Where possible today&#x27;s route follows the ancient one but sometimes it deviates from the historical path in favour of paths and roads with low traffic. The potential for the tourist trade in Italy has been recognised but this has also led some to gain unfair economic advantage by diverting the path so that it passes next to their business, thus increasing footfall.

In England, the Via Francigena starts at the southern portico of Canterbury’s cathedral where the milestone zero of the route is located. The route passes through part of the county of Kent, from Canterbury to the ferries at Dover.

In France, the Via Francigena (given the Grande Randonnée designation &#x27;GR145&#x27;) goes through the &quot;régions&quot; Hauts-de-France, Grand-Est and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté before reaching the Swiss border.

In Switzerland, the Via Francigena (with the route designation &#x27;70&#x27;) goes through the cantons of Vaud and Valais.

In Italy the Via Francigena goes through the &quot;Regione&quot; of Valle d&#x27;Aosta, Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, and finally about halfway through Lazio to Rome.

Walkers could choose to walk along the EuroVelo EV5 cycling route which bears the name &#x27;Via Francigena&#x27;. However, this EuroVelo route varies substantially from Sigeric&#x27;s route and the one given by the Via Francigena Association.

In 1994 the Via Francigena was designated a Cultural Route, and in 2004 a Major Cultural Route.

In November 2009, the Italian government launched a project to recover the Italian leg of it. The object of the plan is to recover the entire route (disjointed parts of which are already signposted) &quot;not only in spiritual and religious terms but also in terms of the environment, architecture, culture, history, wine and cuisine and sport&quot;. The initiative was promoted by the Region of Tuscany, which hosts of the Via, and which presented a plan detailing the low environmental impact infrastructures to be created. The plan will be shared with other local authorities located along the route as an encouragement to carry out similar recovery work. Tuscany has also announced cooperation with the &quot;Opera Romana Pellegrinaggi&quot; (ORP), the Vatican’s organisation for encouraging pilgrimages.

The final stretch, from Rome to the Apulian ports of embarkation for Jerusalem, has been renamed &quot;Via Francigena nel Sud&quot; (in Italian &quot;Via Francigena in the South (Italy)&quot;) or else &quot;Vie Francigene del Sud&quot; (&quot;The Francigena Ways to the South&quot;).

<doc id="877912" wikidata="Q3364870" url="?curid=877912" title="Rangeland">
<text>Rangelands are grasslands, shrublands, woodlands, wetlands, and deserts that are grazed by domestic livestock or wild animals. Types of rangelands include tallgrass and shortgrass prairies, desert grasslands and shrublands, woodlands, savannas, chaparrals, steppes, and tundras. Rangelands do not include forests lacking grazable understory vegetation, barren desert, farmland, or land covered by solid rock, concrete, or glaciers.

Rangelands are distinguished from pasture lands because they grow primarily native vegetation rather than plants established by humans. Rangelands are also managed principally with practices such as managed livestock grazing and prescribed fire rather than more intensive agricultural practices of seeding, irrigation, and the use of fertilizers.

Grazing is an important use of rangelands but the term &quot;rangeland&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;grazingland&quot;. Livestock grazing can be used to manage rangelands by harvesting forage to produce livestock, changing plant composition, or reducing fuel loads.

Fire is also an essential regulator of range vegetation, whether set by humans or resulting from lightning. Fires tend to reduce the abundance of woody plants and promote herbaceous plants, including grasses, forbs, and grass-like plants. The suppression or reduction of periodic wildfires from desert shrublands, savannas, or woodlands frequently invites the dominance of trees and shrubs to the near exclusion of grasses and forbs.

Rangelands cover approximately 80 million square kilometers globally, with 9.5 million square kilometers protected and 67 million square kilometers used for livestock production. These areas sustain about 1 billion animals, managed by pastoralists across over 100 countries, illustrating their crucial role in both ecological conservation and agricultural productivity.

The United Nations (UN) has declared 2026 the International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists, with the Food and Agriculture Organization leading the initiative.

== Etymology and definition ==

The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines rangeland as &quot;lands on which the native vegetation (climax or natural potential plant community) is predominantly grasses, grass-like plants, forbs, or shrubs suitable for grazing or browsing use.&quot; The EPA classifies natural grassland and savannas as rangeland, and in some cases includes wetlands, deserts, tundra, and &quot;certain forb and shrub communities.&quot; The primary difference between rangeland and pasture is management; rangelands tend to have natural vegetation along with a few introduced plant species, but all managed by grazing, while pastures have forage that is adapted for livestock and managed, by seeding, mowing, fertilization and irrigation.

==Types of rangeland==
According to the UNCCD, 35% of rangelands are deserts and xeric shrublands, 26% tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas and shrublands, 15% tundra, 13% temperate grasslands, savannahs and shrublands, 6% montane grasslands and shrublands, 4% mediterranean forests, woodlands and scrub, as well as 1% flooded grasslands and savannahs.

===Prairie===
Prairies are considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type. Temperate grassland regions include the Pampas of Argentina, and the steppes of Eurasia.

===Grasslands===
Grasslands are areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses (Poaceae) and other herbaceous (non-woody) plants. However, sedge (Cyperaceae) and rush (Juncaceae) families can also be found. Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica. In temperate latitudes, such as northwest Europe and the Great Plains and California in North America, native grasslands are dominated by perennial bunch grass species, whereas in warmer climates annual species form a greater component of the vegetation.

===Steppe===
Steppe, in physical geography, refers to a biome region characterized by grassland plain without trees apart from those near rivers and lakes. The prairie (especially the shortgrass and mixed prairie) is an example of a steppe, though it is not usually called such. It may be semi-desert, or covered with grass or shrubs or both, depending on the season and latitude. The term is also used to denote the climate encountered in regions too dry to support a forest, but not dry enough to be a desert.

===Pampas===
Pampas are the fertile South American lowlands that include the Argentine provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Santa Fe, Entre Ríos and Córdoba, most of Uruguay, and the State of Rio Grande do Sul, in the southernmost end of Brazil covering more than . These vast plains are only interrupted by the low Ventana and Tandil hills near Bahía Blanca and Tandil (Argentina), with a height of and respectively. The climate is mild, with precipitation of to , more or less evenly distributed through the year, making the soils appropriate for agriculture. This area is also one of the distinct physiography provinces of the larger Paraná-Paraguay Plain division. These plains contain unique wildlife because of the different terrains around it. Some of this wildlife includes the rhea, the badger, and the prairie chicken.

===Shrubland===
Shrubland is a plant community characterized by vegetation dominated by shrubs, often also including grasses, herbs, and geophytes. Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity. It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire. A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or browsing. Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire. The term &quot;shrubland&quot; was first coined in 1903.

===Woodland===
Woodland is a low-density forest forming open habitats with plenty of sunlight and limited shade. Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses. Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession. Higher densities and areas of trees, with largely closed canopy, provide extensive and nearly continuous shade are referred to as forest.

===Savanna===
Savanna is a grassland ecosystem characterized by the trees being sufficiently small or widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of C4 grasses.

===Desert===
Desert is a landscape or region that receives an extremely low amount of precipitation, defined as areas with an average annual precipitation of less than per year, or as areas where more water is lost by evapotranspiration than falls as precipitation. In the Köppen climate classification system, deserts are classed as &quot;BWh&quot; (hot desert) or &quot;BWk&quot; (temperate desert). In the Thornthwaite climate classification system, deserts would be classified as arid megathermal climates.

===Tundra===
Tundra is a biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term &quot;tundra&quot; comes through Russian тундра from the Kildin Sami word &quot;tūndâr&quot; &quot;uplands,&quot; &quot;treeless mountain tract.&quot; There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.

==Uses of rangeland==
Rangelands produce a wide variety of goods and services desired by society, including livestock forage (Grazing), wildlife habitat, water, mineral resources, wood products, wildland recreation, open space and natural beauty. The geographic extent and many important resources of rangelands make their proper use and management vitally important to people everywhere.

=== Economic benefits ===
Rangelands are vital economic assets, contributing substantially to national economies, particularly through livestock production. For instance, in Ethiopia, rangelands account for 19% of the national GDP, while in Brazil, they contribute one-third of the agribusiness GDP through cattle farming. These vast areas not only support direct agricultural outputs but also bolster related industries, enhancing employment and promoting economic growth. Their management and sustainability are crucial for continuing these economic contributions and supporting the livelihoods dependent on them.

== Rangeland degradation challenges ==
The degradation of Earth&#x27;s extensive rangelands due to overuse, inappropriate cultivation, misuse, climate change, and biodiversity loss represents a significant threat to humanity&#x27;s food supply and the well-being or survival of billions of people. 

In 2024, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) reported that up to 50% of rangelands are degraded. These areas suffer from reduced soil fertility, woody encroachment, erosion, salinization, alkalinization, and soil compaction, which all inhibit plant growth and contribute to drought and fluctuations in precipitation. This degradation is primarily driven by the conversion of pastures to cropland, urban expansion, increasing demands for food, fiber, and fuel, excessive grazing, abandonment by pastoralists, and policies that incentivize overexploitation. The UNCCD observes that the loss of rangeland attracts little public attention and rarely features in international policy discussions.

==Global extent==

Rangelands cover up to 8 billion hectares of land globally and therewith 54% of the terrestrial surface. 78% of rangelands occur in drylands.

===Canada===
Rangeland is a prominent feature of rural Canada. A provincial jurisdiction, administration and policy regarding range use varies across the country. As in many other Commonwealth countries, public tenures on crown land for the purpose of range activities are common in geographically compatible areas. Reconciling the economic needs of ranchers and the need for environmental conservation is one of the primary themes in modern range discourse.

In western Canada, both grassland and forested range are significant. In British Columbia, 70 percent of grassland range is privately owned and 60 percent of the total annual livestock forage requirement is provided by grazing on Crown rangeland (34 million hectares), 80 percent of which is forested range. Grassland range predominates in much of the prairie provinces’ ranching area; however, forested range is particularly important in the boreal region.

Certain rangelands are preserved as provincially-protected areas similar to parks, others are managed as community resources. For example, in Alberta since 2003 there has been legislation allowing the creation of &quot;Heritage Rangelands&quot; within the parks system. As of 2012 there were 2 heritage rangelands and 6 proposed future heritage rangelands run by Alberta Parks. There are also 32 provincial grazing reserves located throughout Alberta administered as public lands by Alberta Sustainable Resource Development. The federal government has administered several &quot;Community Pastures&quot; in Western Canada that were reclaimed lands suffering erosion during the 1930s. In 2012, it was announced that this federal involvement would be phased out over a six-year period.

===United States===

Of the land within the United States borders, 36% is considered rangeland. The western side of the United States is 53% rangeland. Around 399 million acres (1,610,000 km2) of rangeland are privately owned. The Bureau of Land Management manages about 167 million acres (676,000 km2) of publicly owned rangeland, with the United States Forest Service managing approximately 95 million acres (380,000 km2) more. Ranchers may lease portions of this public rangeland and pay a fee based on the number and type of livestock and the period for which they are on the land.

Historically much of the land in the western United States was used for grazing and much of some states still is. In many of those states, such as Arizona, an open-range law applies which requires a land owner to fence cattle out rather than in; thus cattle are theoretically allowed to roam free. In modern times open-range laws can conflict with urban development as occasional stray cows, bulls, or even herds wander into subdivisions or onto highways.

=== Australia ===
Australia’s rangelands extend from tropical savannas in the north dominated by summer rainfall, though large areas of desert in central Australia to the southern rangelands dominated by winter rainfall. They cover approximately 80 per cent of the Australian continent and equate broadly with the ‘Outback’. However, rangelands also occur in higher rainfall areas where limitations other than rainfall restrict use to management of the natural landscape. The rangelands are where values and societal benefits are based primarily on natural resources. They are areas which have not been intensively developed for agriculture but extensive livestock production is a major land use, accounting for 55 per cent of the rangelands. Conservation reserves utilise around 11 per cent of the rangelands and the rangelands have areas of significant biodiversity and natural attractions on a world scale.  Although mining and petroleum extraction uses a very small percentage of the rangelands, it economically contributes most to Australia’s Gross Domestic Product compared with other rangeland industries (cattle, sheep and goat production, tourism, harvesting of native products). Indigenous land tenures of various types cover around 59 per cent of the rangelands and overlap with grazing and conservation uses.  Although rangelands cover 80 per cent of Australia’s land mass, at the 2016 Census, they were home to just over two per cent of the population (394,000 people), with 28 per cent of rangeland residents identifying as being Indigenous.

=== South America ===
Rangelands in South America are located in regions with climate ranging from arid to sub-humid. Annual precipitation in these areas ranges from approximately 150 to 1500 mm (6–60 inches). Within South America, rangelands cover about 33% of the total land area. South American rangelands include; grasslands, shrublands, savannas, and hot and cold deserts. Rangelands in South America exclude hyperarid deserts. Examples of the South American rangelands include the Patagonian Steppe, the Monte, the Pampas, the &quot;Llanos&quot; or &quot;Cerrado,&quot; the &quot;Chaco&quot; and the &quot;Caatinga.&quot;
The change in the intensity and location of tropical thunderstorms and other weather patterns is the driving force in the climates of southern South America.

=== Africa ===

In Kenya, rangelands make up for 85% of the land surface area, and are largely inhabited by nomadic pastoralists who are largely dependent on livestock. This movement often brings along an incursion of different diseases with the common one being the rinderpest virus in the Kenyan wildlife population from the Somali ecosystem.

=== Asia ===
In the past, rangelands in western China supported a pastoral economy and large wildlife populations. Now the rangelands have shrunk due to population growth, economic, government, and social factors. Rangeland types in China include; Semi-desert, Dry Alpine Grasslands, Alpine Dwarf Shrub, Wetland types.

<doc id="877914" wikidata="Q38824" url="?curid=877914" title="Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever">
<text>The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is a medium-sized gundog bred primarily for hunting. It is often referred to as a &quot;toller&quot;. It is the smallest of the retrievers, and is often mistaken for a small Golden Retriever. Tollers are intelligent, eager to please, alert, and energetic. The name &quot;toller&quot; is derived from their ability to lure waterfowl within gunshot range. The breed originated in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, Canada. The American Kennel Club ranks the toller as the 87th most popular dog breed.

== History ==
The breed was developed in the Acadian community of Little River Harbour in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia around the beginning of the 19th century. The toller was originally referred to as the Little River Duck Dog before being officially recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club in 1945 as a purebred dog. The toller is a mixture of retriever, spaniel, setter, and possibly a farm collie mongrel, although the latter has yet to be confirmed. The breed was perfected in the second half of the 19th century.

The breed gained national recognition in 1980 and was declared the provincial dog of Nova Scotia in 1995, when two Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers were awarded Best in Show at championship events that included many breeds.

Tollers are named for their ability to entice or lure waterfowl within gunshot range, which is called &quot;tolling&quot;. The hunter stays hidden in a blind and sends the dog out to romp and play near the water, usually by tossing a ball or stick to be retrieved. The dog&#x27;s appearance is similar to that of a fox. Its unusual activity and white markings pique the curiosity of ducks and geese, which swim over to investigate.

When the birds are close, the hunter calls the dog back to the blind, then rises, putting the birds to flight and allowing themselves a shot. The toller then retrieves any downed birds. They are particularly suited for retrieving in cold water climates because of their water-repellent double coat.

== Description ==

=== Appearance ===
Tollers are often mistaken for small Golden Retrievers, but the toller is more active, both physically and mentally. According to the breed standards, the toller is athletic, muscular, compact, medium to heavy boned, balanced and powerful. The toller&#x27;s chest is deep. Conformation judges require tollers to be capable of tolling and physical faults that inhibit working ability are heavily penalized. They should be of moderate build, with a lack of substance or a heavy build being penalized by judges for detracting from the breed standard and athleticism. A toller&#x27;s legs are sturdy and solid and they have webbed feet.

Tollers can be any shade of red ranging from a golden red through dark coppery red with lighter featherings on the underside of the tail, pantaloons, and body. The lighter shades of golden red are deeply pigmented and rich in colour. The Toller should not be buff, brown, or beige, though some buff and sable tollers do appear in breeding lines.

It is common for a toller to have at least one of the following white markings: tip of tail, feet (not extending above the pasterns), and chest. Lack of white is not a fault as tollers can be born without white markings. Dogs with white on the shoulders, around ears, back of neck, across back or flanks, or with silvery, grey or black areas in coat are disqualified from conformation shows.

The toller was bred to retrieve from icy waters and must have a water-repellent double coat of medium length and softness and a soft dense undercoat. The coat may have a slight wave on the back but is otherwise straight. Some winter coats may form a long loose curl at the throat. Featherings are soft and moderate in length. The tail is well feathered and held jauntily when the dog is excited or moving. The hair on the muzzle is short and fine. Seasonal shedding is to be expected.

Those who breed Tollers for conformation shows consider the head (clean cut, slightly wedge-shaped) to be an important feature and believe it should resemble that of a fox and must never be blocky like that of a golden retriever. The ears are triangular and set high and well back from the skull. The pigment on a toller&#x27;s nose, lips, and eye rims should match, appearing either black (which normally fades with age) or liver, blending into the coat. Lips fit fairly tightly around the mouth. The correct bite is a scissor bite with full dentition required. A toller&#x27;s jaws are strong enough to carry a large bird but they must have a soft mouth, too. Eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, and medium-sized and amber to dark brown in colour. Expression is friendly, alert, and intelligent.

=== Size and proportions ===
Tollers are the smallest of all the retriever breeds. They range in height from at the withers, and weigh , with females being slightly shorter and lighter. Tollers are a medium-sized breed.

=== Temperament ===
Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are known to be very intelligent, curious, alert, outgoing, and high-energy dogs. They are affectionate, eager to please, busy, and get along well with children. They are good family dogs. However, potential owners should be wary of the physical and mental commitment that is required in order to keep a toller busy. Physical stimulation should be provided for these dogs each day since they may become destructive when they are not exercised enough or are left alone for long periods of time.
Duck Tollers are working animals and are happiest when they have a job to do. Tollers are excellent hunting companions. They excel at many types of sporting competitions such as agility, dock diving, and obedience. Their keen sense of smell, intelligence, drive for work, and small size make them perfect search and rescue dogs. The breed standard states that the dog should have a strong retrieving drive, intense birdiness, endurance, and a love for water.

Tollers do not have an aggressive bark. Some have a unique sounding bark known as the &quot;toller scream&quot;, which is a high-pitched howl-like sound which is often referred to as &quot;singing&quot;. They do not use this bark in violent situations, rather; the &quot;toller scream&quot; is expressed when they are excited.

=== Socialization ===

Tollers have the capacity to be very social dogs as long as they are sufficiently socialized early on in life. While tollers are energetic and outgoing around their owners and family, their cautious nature makes them reserved around strangers. Exposure to new people, locations, smells, and sights are crucial to the healthy development of the toller breed. They tend to get along well with other dogs. However, they have a strong prey drive and may chase after cats or other small animals. Their prey drive can be avoided if cats, for example, are introduced early on in a toller&#x27;s life. Failure to properly socialize tollers at a young age may result in aggressive, destructive, or timid behaviour in maturity.

== Health ==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.2 years from a sample of 47 deaths for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Tollers are generally hardy. However, like almost all dog breeds, certain genetic disorders are known to occur in the breed. This is sometimes blamed on a relatively small gene pool. The Finnish breed club states the largest health problems in the breed tend to be immunity related. They can be affected by eye problems and hip dysplasia and are predisposed to immune-mediated rheumatic disease and steroid-responsive meningitis–arthritis.

Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) affects about 7% of Tollers with an estimated 40% being carriers. The type of PRA associated with the breed is known as progressive rod-cone degeneration. The disease causes cells in the retina to degenerate and die. This causes night blindness at first and eventually complete blindness. Collie eye anomaly is estimated to have a carrier rate of 5% and an affected rate of 0.5%. It generally only causes mildly impaired vision, although in more severe cases it can lead to retinal hemorrhaging and detachments resulting in blindness.

Thyroid problems have been identified by American breeders as a priority issue, together with epilepsy and hip dysplasia. As many as 1 in 6 Tollers may have autoimmune thyroiditis. Symptoms of thyroid problems includes weight gain, skin and hair problems including hair loss, weakness, cold intolerance or infertility.

Addison&#x27;s disease affected 1% of Tollers in a health survey, an incidence rate 10 times more than the general dog population. Carrier rate is estimated at 18%. This disease is also considered an important issue in the breed. Signs include lethargy, decreased appetite, vomiting, weakness, diarrhea, increased drinking and urination, and shivering.

Aseptic meningitis (sometimes called steroid-responsive meningitis) has been diagnosed in increasing numbers in the Norwegian Toller population in recent years. Symptoms include intensive neck pain, fever, and lethargy. Prevalence is estimated at 2.5% in the Norwegian population.

Health tests are available for both eye diseases and autoimmune thyroiditis. A test for Addison&#x27;s disease is available but it is only for one form of the disease and there are other forms which also affect the breed. A test is also available for one form of cleft palate that is exclusive to Tollers. Early testing shows a carrier rate of about 15%.

A survey conducted in 2002 by the Canadian Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever breed club to discover which diseases and conditions occur in the Toller population, involving owners of 1180 dogs worldwide, showed 73% reported in excellent health and a total of 7.5% reporting poor or bad health. 141 dogs (12%) were reported as deceased with the average age at death being 6.4 years. The most common cause of death was cancer, reported in 25% of deaths, with old age being the next most common at 9%.

A worldwide study of the Tollers&#x27; registration history in 17 countries shows that about 90% of the genetic diversity present in the founding population has been lost. Tollers born between 1999 and 2008 have an effective founder size of 9.8, realized effective population size of 18 and an average inbreeding coefficient of 0.26. Breeders are working to prevent losing heterozygosity and to maintain sufficient genetic variations. High kinship value means the breed is not able to maintain a steady level of inbreeding in the long term.

== Activities ==

The Toller is known to excel in various sporting and obedience activities, and health and safety related jobs. The breeds&#x27; high energy and intelligence makes them perfect candidates for difficult jobs that require tremendous dedication and skill. Tollers enjoy working and being outside, therefore, it is no surprise that they excel at various sport and job related activities.

The breed is categorized as a &quot;sporting&quot; dog under the CKC and AKA organizations making tollers ideal dogs for various physical activities. Other kennel clubs such as the AKNC and UKC categorize tollers as a &quot;gundog&quot; which depicts their drive, mental intelligence, and intuitive hunting sense. Kennel clubs throughout the world recognize Tollers as an athletic, intelligent, and a driven breed that has the innate ability to excel in any of the following activities: dog agility, dock jumping, disc catching, flyball, lure coursing, obedience, search and rescue, therapy dog, and hunting.

<text>The action at Barfleur was part of the battle of Barfleur-La Hougue during the War of the Grand Alliance. A French fleet under Anne Hilarion de Tourville was seeking to cover an invasion of England by a French army to restore James II to the throne, but was intercepted by an Anglo-Dutch fleet under Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford on 19 May Old Style (29 May New Style) 1692.

== Background ==
The fleets sighted each other at first light on the morning of 19 May 1692 off &quot;Cap Barfleur&quot; on the Cotentin peninsula.

On sighting the allied fleet, at about 6am, Tourville held a council of war with his captains; the advice, and his own opinion, was against action; however, Tourville felt compelled by strict orders from the king to engage. He also may have expected defections from the English fleet by captains with Jacobite sympathies, though in this he was to be disappointed.

In the light south-westerly breeze the fleets slowly closed, Russell from the north east, Tourville, with the weather gage, from the south west, on a starboard tack to bring his line of battle into contact with Russell&#x27;s. Because of the calm conditions it was not until 11am, 5 hours after first sighting each other, that the two fleets were within range of each other.

== Dispositions ==
The French line was led by the Blue-and-White squadron, 14 ships of the line in three divisions under the flag officers Nesmond, d&#x27;Amfreville and Relingue. They were matched by the Dutch White squadron of 26 ships under Almonde, again in three divisions under van der Putte, Gilles Schey and Gerard Callenburgh.

In the centre, the French White squadron (16 ships under Villette Mursay, Tourville and Langeron) opposed the English Red squadron (27 ships under Delaval, Russell and Shovell).

Bringing up the rear, the French Blue squadron (14 ships under Coetlogon, Gabaret and Pannetier) would face the English Blue squadron (29 ships under Carter, Ashby and Rooke).

Tourville re-inforced his centre, the White squadron under his own command, by bringing Coetlogon&#x27;s division forward in order to engage Russell&#x27;s Red squadron with something approaching equal numbers, while he refused and extended the line of his White squadron to avoid them being turned and overwhelmed by superior numbers; the rest of his Blue squadron he held back also to keep the advantage of the weather gage.

Russell countered by holding fire as long as possible, to allow the French fleet to close; Almonde tried to extend his line to overlap the French van, while Ashby was still some way off and trying to close. The two fleets were within range at 11am, but both with-held firing for a further 15 minutes, until the &quot;Saint Louis&quot; (number 4 in the French Blue-and-White squadron) fired on her opposite number; at that the firing became general up and down the line.

==Battle==
=== Morning ===
11 am to 1 pm

For the next few hours Tourville&#x27;s White and Russell&#x27;s Red squadrons were closely engaged, and causing each other considerable damage. &quot;Centurion&quot; 50 (Red 7) was engaged by &quot;Ambiteux&quot; 96 (White 7, Villettes flagship) and severely damaged; &quot;Chester&quot; 50 (Red 12) was outgunned by &quot;Glorieux&quot; 64 (White 8) and had to withdraw; &quot;Eagle&quot; 70 (Red 11) was forced to pull out of the line, with 70 dead, to repair damage, but was able to re-join after emergency repairs; while &quot;Grafton&quot; 70 (Red 18) suffered 80 casualties, but was able to continue.

On the French side, &quot;Soleil Royal&quot; 104 (White 10, Tourville&#x27;s flagship) was engaged by three English ships, &quot;Britannia&quot; 100, (White 14, Russell&#x27;s flagship) supported by &quot;London&quot; 96 (Red 15) and &quot;St Andrew&quot; 56 (White 13); she was severely damaged, and forced at one point out of the line; &quot;Perle&quot; 52 (White 7) was shot through and through, and suffered one-third of her crew as casualties. &quot;Henri&quot; 64 (White 2) and Fort 60 (White 1) were both severely damaged trying to hold the line between the White and the Blue-and-White squadrons, to prevent a gap opening; &quot;Henri&quot; was battered until she could no longer fight, and only escaped capture when Villette sent boats to tow her to safety; &quot;Fort&quot;&#x27;s crew were forced to use sweeps to pull her out of the line for respite.

=== Afternoon ===
1pm

At about 1pm the wind, which up to then had been south-westerly, if it blew at all, strengthened and shifted to the east. This gave the benefit of the weather gage to the allies, who immediately took advantage of it. Shovell saw a gap in the French line ahead of him, and steered towards it; his &quot;Royal William&quot; 100 (23rd in the Red) broke through to engage the French White from both sides. He was followed by the rest of his division, while &quot;Kent&quot; 70 (Red 22), and &quot;St Albans&quot; 50 (Red 21), who were ahead of him in the line, pulled round to follow the &quot;William&quot; through the breach.

&quot;Hampton Court&quot; 70 and &quot;Swiftsure&quot; 70 (the Red 19 and 20), which were ahead of them again, remained to the windward of the French, and joined themselves to Russells division. Carter, with the leading Blue division, saw Shovell&#x27;s action and followed also, giving about a dozen ships doubling the French line.

In the van, the wind enabled Almonde to extend and cross the head of the French line; Nesmond responded by turning his division into the wind also, so that over the next few hours the French Blue-and-White became at right angles to the centre (White).

Shovell&#x27;s action brought Tourville&#x27;s ships under fire from both sides; &quot;Soleil Royal&quot; particularly was hard pressed until Coetlogon, with &quot;Magnifique&quot; 86 (Blue 3) and &quot;Prince&quot; 56 (blue 2) interposed.

3pm

By 3 o’clock the French line was curved leeward like a fish-hook; the Blue-and-White was turned back to the centre, with the Dutch extended around them. When &quot;Prince&quot; 56 (the French Blue 2, in Coetlogon&#x27;s division) was hotly engaged on both sides, with a third across her stern, she was saved by &quot;Monarque&quot; 90, Nesmondes flagship.

In the centre, Coetlogon and Tourville were engaged on either side by Shovell and Russell, while Carter was matched by the French rear divisions. To the east, Ashby and Rooke were endeavouring to get into action.

4pm

By 4 o’clock the wind had died, the sea becoming flat calm, and visibility dropping due to battle smoke. The continuous firing also tended to push the embattled ships apart, offering some respite, as both sides were becoming exhausted.

In the van, Nesmonde continued to turn as Almonde continued to extend and turn the line, both sides using boats to tow the ships into position, while in the rear Ashby was also using boats to bring his Blue squadron into the fray. In the poor visibility however he was unable to see Carter, his vice-admiral, who was in the position of advantage with Shovell beyond the French line, and sorely pressed: He continued to head towards the French Blue squadron, which was north of the main action.

5pm

By 5pm the centres were re-engaged; Russell had used his boats to tow his ships back into action. The fog had lifted, cleared by a light breeze. As the wind strengthened, Tourville headed north west towards Carter, in order to fight his way out of the encirclement. Russell pursued, until the wind, unpredictable all day, died away and the mist closed in once more.

=== Evening ===
6pm

At around 6pm the tide began to turn; seeking to take advantage of this, and remembering how the English had escaped after the battle of Beachy Head two years before, Tourville had his ships anchor at the end of slack water, with their sails still set. Deceived by this, Russell&#x27;s squadron was carried away by the flood tide, until they could themselves anchor, now out of range giving the French a respite. Shovell&#x27;s ships, uptide of the French, had also anchored, either foreseeing the French manoeuvre, or seeking respite themselves; only &quot;Sandwich&quot; 90 (Red 24) was unprepared, and was swept by the flood into and through the French line, being severely damaged, and suffering many casualties, including her captain.

7pm

At around 7pm the wind arose again, from the southeast, allowing the English Blue squadron to join the action. Because of Ashby&#x27;s previous manoeuvres, Rooke&#x27;s division was now closer to the embattled Red squadron, and joined the fray.

&quot;Neptune&quot; 96 (Blue 24, Rooke&#x27;s flagship), &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; 90 (Blue 25) and &quot;Expedition&quot; 70 (Blue 26), were able to engage the French ships, particularly &quot;Soleil Royal&quot; and &quot;Ambiteux&quot;, increasing the damage they had already sustained. Ashby, in &quot;Victory&quot; 100 (Blue 14) and the rest of his division joined the fray shortly after, engaging the main body for the next two hours.

8pm

Shovell&#x27;s ships were still in range of the French, but found themselves sternwards to the French bows, so only a few guns on either side could be engaged. From his position uptide, Shovell attempted to break up the French formation by sending fireships onto them with the tide; his intent was to oblige Tourville to cut his anchor cables to escape them, leaving him to drift with the tide onto Russell&#x27;s guns. Four fireships were released, but the French were able to fend them off . One fireship became entangled with &quot;Perle&quot;, but her crew were able to cut it loose; another, released by &quot;Cambridge&quot;, 70, and aimed at &quot;Soleil Royal&quot;, came so close as to persuade the French flagship to cut, but she was able to re-anchor before coming within range of Russell&#x27;s ships.

9pm

At around 9pm Shovell and Rooke decided their position was too exposed to be tenable. As the only ships between the French fleet and the open sea, and being out of contact with the rest of the allied fleet, they decided to use the last of the flood tide to sail through the French fleet and re-join the English line. French contemporary accounts present this as a mistake, as their position placed Tourville in some difficulty, but it is conceivable that if the whole French fleet swept down on them on the ebb, they would be overwhelmed. As it was, the manoeuvre was fraught with difficulty; all their ships were exposed to close raking fire, and were cut up severely.

=== Aftermath ===
10pm

By 10pm the battle was almost over. Both sides were exhausted, and the majority of the ships on both sides were damaged, many severely. Amazingly, none of the ships from either line were lost; none were sunk or captured. Shovell had expended four of his fireships without result, and another had burned earlier after being hit by gunfire; these could be seen burning in the night, and were noted by the captain of the &quot;Monmouth&quot; in his log. Both sides reported a large explosion around this time, but both thought it was a ship from the opposing fleet. Whichever ship it involved, it was not fatal, as all the ships from both lines were accounted for after the action. On the turn of the tide, and in the moonlight, Tourville ordered the French fleet to cut their anchor cables and slip away; the allies followed on as they could.

<text>Happy Tree Friends (commonly abbreviated as HTF) is an adult animated web series created by Aubrey Ankrum, Rhode Montijo, and Kenn Navarro, and developed by Montijo, Navarro, and Warren Graff for Mondo Media. Disguised as a children&#x27;s cartoon, the series follows the misadventures of cute anthropomorphic forest animals, who live initially peaceful lives until they are killed or injured in sudden, usually accidental, graphically violent incidents. Debuting sometime in 2000, &quot;Happy Tree Friends&quot; has achieved a cult following on Mondo&#x27;s website and YouTube channel and expanded into a multimedia franchise, which includes the television series of the same name.

== Background ==
=== History ===
While working with Mondo Media, Rhode Montijo drew a character on a piece of scrap paper who would later become Shifty. He then drew a yellow rabbit that bore some resemblance to Cuddles, writing &quot;Resistance is futile&quot; underneath it on a spreadsheet poster. Rhode hung the drawing up in his workstation so other people could see his idea, and eventually, the idea was pitched to and accepted by the Mondo Media executives. In 1999, Mondo gave Aubrey Ankrum, Rhode Montijo, and Kenn Navarro a chance to do a short for them. They came up with a short named &quot;Banjo Frenzy&quot;, which featured a dinosaur (an earlier version of Lumpy) killing three woodland animals, a squirrel, a rabbit, and a beaver (earlier versions of Giggles, Cuddles, and Toothy) with a banjo. From there, Mondo gave them their own Internet series, which they named &quot;Happy Tree Friends&quot;.

Although the first episodes of &quot;Happy Tree Friends&quot; were produced in 1999, it debuted online sometime in 2000 and became an unexpected success, getting over 15 million hits each month along with screenings at film festivals.

Mondo Media CEO John Evershed attributes the success of the series to animator Kenn Navarro:

In 2014, after the episode &quot;Dream Job&quot; was released, Mondo Media announced plans to produce a feature film based on the series, but in 2016, Kenn Navarro tweeted that he was unaware of work being done on a film, but that his team was &quot;in talk to do more shorts&quot;. Later, when a fan asked Kenn Navarro about the film, he replied: &quot;a treatment that [I] and the writers did was all the work (that [I] know of) for the movie.&quot;

Throughout December 2016, Mondo Media released five all-new episodes for purchase online. Bundled as a set named &quot;Happy Tree Friends: Still Alive&quot;, the episodes came with some additional bonus material such as background designs, animated storyboards, the animation process, and a writer&#x27;s session video. Upon purchase, the buyer was allowed to download the DRM-free video files to their computer. In January 2017, Kenn Navarro tweeted &quot;As I understand, sales were OK but fell below what was expected.&quot; 

It was announced on August 17, 2023, that a new &quot;Happy Tree Friends&quot; episode would be released on September 27 to tie into the downloadable content for the shoot &#x27;em up video game &quot;The Crackpet Show&quot; (titled &quot;The Crackpet Show: Happy Tree Friends Edition&quot;), which was released on the same day. On October 18, 2024, a new episode titled &quot;Happy Train Friends&quot; was released as a crossover with &quot;Dumb Ways to Die.&quot;

===Premise===
&quot;Happy Tree Friends&quot; centers on the lives of anthropomorphic, multicolored woodland animals. It intentionally misleads first-time viewers into thinking it is a children&#x27;s animated edutainment series, with the show&#x27;s regular opening and closing sequences being in the form of the Little Golden Books, and all main characters (except Lumpy and Sniffles) sharing a &quot;Care Bears&quot;-esque design (pie-eyes, heart-shaped noses, mitten hands, and boot-shaped feet). Each episode starts peacefully with the characters living their lives normally, with activities ranging from childish to grown-up, but a sudden event unintentionally (sometimes intentionally) caused by another animal leads to many of the characters being subjected to very extreme and cruel graphic violence. Each character has suffered brutal pain, murder, or mutilation by the end of each episode, but always returns alive and well by the next.

== Episodes ==
A total of 132 segments have been released across ninety-three web episodes and the thirteen episodes (39 segments) of the television series.

=== Television series ===

The television series was first shown at Comic-Con 2006, while some of the episodes were shown on the website a few weeks prior to the show&#x27;s television premiere. The television series would premiere on September 25, 2006, at midnight on G4&#x27;s late-night block, &quot;Barbed Wire Biscuit&quot; (later renamed &quot;Midnight Spank&quot;). The web series also aired on the network&#x27;s animation anthology series; &quot;Happy Tree Friends and Friends&quot; and &quot;G4&#x27;s Late Night Peepshow&quot;.

The Canadian channel Razer (now MTV2) aired the show in syndication with then-sibling television network Citytv, and then OLN. Internationally, the series was broadcast on MTV in Europe and Latin America, and Animax in South Africa.

== Characters and cast ==
=== Main characters ===
* Cuddles – A yellow rabbit who has big ears, pink cheeks, and a tiny fluff of fur on his head that looks like his tail, along with a pair of pink bunny slippers. He is sometimes shown to be rebellious and often does extremely dangerous things, while he is cute and cuddly at other times. He is considered the series&#x27; unofficial mascot and has the highest death count in the series. His deaths usually involve his body being sliced apart, vehicles, and his intestines. He is voiced by Kenn Navarro.
* Giggles – A pink chipmunk with a small red bow on her head. She was the first female Tree Friend introduced. Her early design depicted her as a blue squirrel. Her deaths usually involve being crushed, her chest, and her head. She is generally considered a girly girl along with her best friend, Petunia. She is known for being featured as a romantically interested date of many of the show&#x27;s male characters (except for Disco Bear, who she loathes) and has a moderate survival rate compared to many of the other main characters. If the pilot &quot;Banjo Frenzy&quot; is counted, she holds the distinction of being the first character in the series to die. She has been voiced by 3 actresses since her debut: Dana Belben (Season 1–2), Ellen Connell (TV Series–Season 4), and Lori Jee (for a few episodes of Season 3).
* Toothy – A purple beaver with freckles and huge buckteeth unlike the others (hence the name &quot;Toothy&quot;). He is friends with Cuddles. His deaths mostly pertain to his eyes and sharp objects. Many people consider him the most undeveloped character in the show or a &quot;redshirt&quot;. Toothy also holds the distinction of being the first character to die in the series (if not counting the pilot, &quot;Banjo Frenzy&quot;). He is voiced by Warren Graff.
* Lumpy – A blue moose with mismatched antlers. He is extremely dim-witted, which often leads to the deaths of many other characters and sometimes his own, but ironically, he has had more jobs than any of the other Tree Friends. His early design in &quot;Banjo Frenzy&quot; portrayed him as a dinosaur instead of a moose, and also presented him as quick to anger and having murderous tendencies, both of which were removed with his first appearance in the series proper. He is the tallest of the main characters and is one of two main characters to not use the basic body shape. He is usually portrayed as an adult, or at least older than the other characters. He is usually considered as the show&#x27;s main character, as he has appeared in most episodes, had the most starring roles, has the most occupations of any character, survived more often than most of the other main characters, and has killed the most characters of the main characters. Most of his kills are unintentional and a result of his stupidity. When he dies, his deaths often involve machinery, animals, and his own mistakes. He was first voiced by Rhode Montijo (Seasons 1–2) and was later voiced by David Winn (Seasons 2–4).
* Petunia – A blue skunk with a pink flower head accessory and a tree air freshener necklace. She is generally considered a girly girl along with her best friend, Giggles. In later seasons, she has a severe case of obsessive–compulsive disorder and has an unhealthy need to keep everything clean. Her deaths usually involve her head and household appliances. She has been voiced by 3 actresses since her debut: Dana Belben (Seasons 1–2), Ellen Connell (Season 3–4, TV Series), and Lori Jee (for a few episodes of Season 3).
* Handy – An orange beaver with amputated hands that are wrapped in bandages (which he is ironically named after), a tool belt, and a yellow hard hat. His amputated hands cause him trouble that often frustrates him, and his disabilities result in the death of either him or other Tree Friends. He is the Tree Friend who most often does construction work, which he somehow manages to do without trouble as long as it is off-screen. He also briefly had boots. His deaths usually involve glass, his organs, impalement, being cut in half, and his head. He is voiced by Warren Graff.
* Nutty – A jittery green squirrel with a crazy candy addiction, a constant act of giggling, and a candy outfit consisting of three lollipops on his head and a candy cane on his chest. He is shown to be quite obsessive about anything made of artificial sugar, especially candy, and goes to great heights to try to get them, often at the expense of himself or others. He also occasionally mistakes certain objects, such as Christmas lights, to be candy. Eating sugar makes him experience an exaggerated sugar rush. He has one small black pupil on his left eye, while his right, which is afflicted by a case of lazy eye, has a green iris (much like the eyes of Flippy&#x27;s bad side). His deaths usually involve his mouth, getting impaled, crushed, split apart, or shredded, and breathing problems. Michael &quot;Lippy&quot; Lipman voices him.
* Sniffles – A brainy blue anteater with big glasses and a mouth on his snout. He is easily the most intelligent character in the series but sometimes lacks common sense. For example, when he spilled a cup of milk, he made a time traveling machine instead of just cleaning up and fill a new one (from the episode &quot;Blast from the Past&quot;). He makes many inventions, but these tend to backfire at inopportune times, sometimes resulting in his death or the death of other characters. He often attempts to eat a family of ants, who manage to save themselves while killing their natural predator in some of the most graphic and sadistic ways possible. His deaths usually involve his tongue, head, limbs, organs and his inventions. He is voiced by Liz Stuart.
* Pop and Cub – Two tan father-and-son bears. Pop wears a robe and is almost always seen smoking a tobacco pipe, while Cub wears a diaper and a beanie with a propeller. Cub has appeared without Pop in some episodes and vice versa. Although well-meaning to his son, Pop usually causes unintentional misfortune to his son casually or negligently, ending with Cub and others injured or dead – sometimes this negligence gets him killed as well. When he witnesses his son&#x27;s death and isn&#x27;t being negligent, however, he does break down due to these events. Other times it is Cub that gets himself into danger. Pop has a high survival rate compared to many of the show&#x27;s other characters. Pop is voiced by Aubrey Ankrum; Cub has been voiced by 3 actresses since his debut: Dana Belben (Seasons 1–2), Ellen Connell (Seasons 2–4), and Lori Jee (for 1 episode of Season 3), which are the same voice actresses for Giggles and Petunia.
* Flaky – A red, nervous porcupine with spiny dandruff on her quills (hence the name &quot;Flaky&quot;). She is paranoid with an extreme fear of dying and a frequent tendency to laugh nervously, although it has not often stopped her from willingly participating in activities with her friends. She is one of the most popular characters in the series given her often understandably cowardly personality due to how easily the characters can die in the series. For a long time, Flaky&#x27;s gender was never made clear, but hints have leaned towards her being female. Eventually, Kenn Navarro confirmed that Flaky is female. Her deaths usually involve getting skinned, burned, or even eaten, and can also involve animals. She is voiced by Nica Lorber.
* The Mole – A mute, blind purple mole with black glasses, a purple turtleneck sweater that covers his mouth, a cane, and a mole near his nose. Due to his blindness, some of his actions get him and the other Tree Friends killed. He often does things blind people should not be doing, such as reading and driving and also holds various occupations that require sight that he often screws up. In his spinoff episode, his archenemy was a noir-type rat villain simply known as The Rat. The Mole does not die very often, but when he does, his deaths usually involve his head, getting impaled or crushed, explosions, and losses of body parts.
* Disco Bear – A golden bear with an afro and &#x27;70s-style clothing. In most episodes, he is seen flirting with mainly Giggles and Petunia, who he fails at flirting with given their dislikes and even ridicules of him. He is also shown to have extreme health issues despite his high frequency to dance. His deaths usually involve his head, his eyes, and explosions. He is voiced by Peter Hermann.
* Russell – A teal sea otter. While he has the appearance of a stereotypical pirate and the pirate catchphrase &quot;Yar!&quot;, he is not actually a pirate and is more often seen doing innocent water-related activities such as fishing or sailing. His deaths are usually by vehicles, sharp objects, or nautical-themed incidents, such as being eaten by an orca, impaled through his eye socket on his own ship&#x27;s mast, or speared through the mouth by a swordfish. He was first voiced by Jeff Biancalana (Seasons 1–2) and later voiced by Francis Carr (TV Series–Season 4).
* Lifty and Shifty – Two green raccoons who steal whatever they can when possible and cackle together when they find valuable objects to take in the expense of others. Shifty wears a dark green fedora, while Lifty does not. Shifty was the first Tree Friend to be created, way before Cuddles. Even though they are brothers, they often argue, and one brother is prone to turning his back on the other in favor of the loot, but it always ends up backfiring, as the double-crossing brother suffers a karmic death as a result. They have the lowest survival rates of all the characters as they almost always seem to get their comeuppance. Their deaths usually involve machines, vehicles, being mashed together or sliced apart, impalement, and heat. Both were initially voiced by Mark Giambruno (Season 1–2) and were later portrayed by Kenn Navarro (TV Series–Season 4).
* Mime – A purple deer with a white-colored painted face and striped shirt. He means to be entertaining, but this results in others around him getting killed or getting self-killed. He is often seen riding a unicycle while juggling. Being a mime, he does not talk, which normally results in the Tree Friend he is communicating with not understanding him, which in some cases causes many deaths. For example, in the television episode &quot;Who&#x27;s to Flame?&quot;, he tries to tell the fire department that the house is burning down, but since they are talking over the phone, Lumpy the firefighter is unable to understand him before hanging up. Later, seeing more firefighters, Mime tries to communicate with them using body motions, but they still do not understand. His deaths usually involve his head, metallic objects, machinery, and vehicles. His rare instances of audible noises (such as choking or gagging) are provided by Sarah Castelblanco.
* Cro-Marmot – A yellow-green marmot who wears a leopard-skin loincloth and holds a brown club. He is frozen in a giant block of ice (rendering him mute). and lives in an igloo in a giant snow globe in the forest. Despite being frozen, he can perform many tasks when off-screen, and a few (such as surfing) onscreen. He often drives around in an ice cream truck. He rarely dies in the series, but when he does, his deaths usually involve heat or disasters. While he almost always dies offscreen, his only onscreen death comes in is &quot;Dino-Sore Days&quot;, which is animated in the style of an old black-and-white cartoon in the vein of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit or Mickey Mouse; it is also the only episode where Cro-Marmot is not frozen in a block of ice, as the episode takes place in prehistoric times.
* Flippy – A green bear with a soldier uniform bearing an army sergeant insignia. He is a war veteran with a severe case of post-traumatic stress disorder. He is normally a friendly and outgoing character, but whenever he sees or hears anything that reminds the slightest hint of warfare, he flips out (hence the name &quot;Flippy&quot;), thinking he is still in the middle of warfare with nobody but enemy combatants, which generally results in him murdering most or all characters around him. This alter ego is known as &quot;Fliqpy&quot; (as the first &quot;p&quot; in his name is flipped horizontally into a &quot;q&quot;) or &quot;Evil Flippy&quot;. He is one of the most popular characters in the series and has the highest intentional kill count. He rarely dies in the series, but when he does, his deaths usually involve vehicles, machinery, and explosions, and these deaths mostly happen either when he is in his good side or in self-defense by Lumpy. Kenn Navarro voiced Flippy, while his evil self Fliqpy is voiced by Aubrey Ankrum, who also provided the voice of his good side up until 2006.
* Splendid – A blue flying squirrel with a red superhero mask. As a superhero, he ironically causes only harm and destruction given his poor management of his extraordinary powers and his constant refusal to take responsibility for the deaths he caused. He bears some similarities to Superman, such as his weakness being a green crystalline acorn known as Kryptonut (a parody of Kryptonite) in the television episode &quot;Gems the Breaks&quot;, which is also his only onscreen death. His archenemy is an evil doppelgänger of himself known as Splendont. He was first voiced by Rhode Montijo (Seasons 1–2) and later voiced by David Winn (TV Series–Season 4).
* Lammy – A purple sheep with a purple bow and a white sweater representing her wool. Introduced in Q2 2010, she has a supposedly imaginary friend named Mr. Pickels, a sentient pickle who apparently enjoys brutally murdering those around her, ruining her chances to develop full friendships with other people (however, Mr. Pickels&#x27; actual sentience is still ambiguous). She is voiced by Renée T. MacDonald.
* Mr. Pickels – A mute anthropomorphic pickle with a top hat and mustache. He acts similar to Evil Flippy, due to his tendency to violently kill anyone nearby simply for his own enjoyment. He is also Lammy&#x27;s &quot;imaginary friend&quot; that only she can see in animated form. However, in the web episode &quot;Royal Flush&quot;, Giggles is able to see him, in which he also manages to single-handedly kill Flaky. At first, Lammy thinks of him as nice, but he then starts causing chaos, such as from ripping the head off of Petunia&#x27;s teddy bear to running over Handy with his own truck in their debut appearances in the web episode &quot;A Bit of a Pickle&quot;.

=== Minor characters ===
*Buddhist Monkey – A yellow Buddhist monk monkey who has appeared in three episodes, &quot;Enter the Garden&quot;, &quot;Books of Fury&quot;, and &quot;Three Courses of Death&quot;. His enemies, the Generic Tree Ninjas, are bears that try to destroy what he cherishes. He is voiced by Jeff Biancalana.
*Generic Tree Friends - The Generic Tree Friends are incidental characters who are often used in masses. Typically, only their silhouettes and facial features are seen.
*Truffles - A bluish-gray boar. Truffles was one of two characters, the other being Lammy, who were candidates for the series&#x27; &quot;Vote or Die&quot; event, where fans could vote on which of the two would become a main character in the series; Lammy won the contest, although Truffles did appear since in cameo roles. He makes his debut in the episode &quot;A Bit of a Pickle&quot;, but most prominently appears in &quot;Clause for Concern&quot;. While he is not a main character, he has been killed in three episodes, by Lumpy in &quot;All in Vein&quot; and (with the assist of Toothy) in &quot;An inconvenient tooth&quot; and Flippy in &quot;By the Seat of your Pants&quot;. It was officially stated that he is a bully, indicating that he could be an anti-hero.
*Unicornius - A crudely-drawn white unicorn with a rainbow horn and tail. He was one of two winners in the first of two &quot;Truffles&#x27; Video Bomb&quot; competitions where fans could submit their own characters for a chance for them to be featured as a cameo in an official episode. He appeared as a cameo in &quot;Pet Peeve&quot;. This character is based on the song by Oliver Age 24.
*Tricksy - A white and brown ferret with a knack for pranks. He was one of two winners in the first of two &quot;Truffles&#x27; Video Bomb&quot; competitions where fans could submit their own characters for a chance for them to be featured as a cameo in an official episode. He appeared as a cameo in &quot;Pet Peeve&quot;.
*Rudy - A purple ram dressed as the character Ryu from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; video game series. He was the winner of the second of two &quot;Truffles&#x27; Video Bomb&quot; competitions where fans could submit their own characters for a chance for them to be featured as a cameo in an official episode. He appeared as a cameo in &quot;A Vicious Cycle&quot;. This character was created by Grubby21.
*FatKat - Only appearing as a cameo in the Happy Tree Friends Break short &quot;Take Your Seat&quot;, FatKat is a blue cat who is based on the mascot of FatKat Animation, the now-defunct animation studio that worked on the Happy Tree Friends TV series.
*Fall Out Boy - The real-life alternative rock band Fall Out Boy made a cameo appearance as Tree Friend versions of themselves in the music video for their song &quot;The Carpal Tunnel of Love&quot;, which was animated by the crew of Happy Tree Friends. All four members die in the video when they are decapitated by a tow cable.

==Reception==
===Controversy===
The series has drawn criticism due to concern that children would be influenced by its violent content due to the series appearing as if it were made for children. An example of this happened in 2005, when American author and journalist Katherine Ellison expressed her feelings about it to The Washington Post after witnessing her six-year-old son watch it. She believed that the series should be regulated since she felt it would have an impact on young children&#x27;s minds.

The series has also been controversial with several local and federal government agencies in Russia. In 2008, the Russian Media Culture Protection Department (Rossvyazokhrankultura), a regulatory body for TV in Russia, issued a warning to Russian TV channel 2×2 about them airing the series along with &quot;The Adventures of Big Jeff&quot;, claiming that they both promote &quot;violence and brutality.&quot; This &quot;violence and brutality&quot; was claimed to harm the psychic health, moral development, and social morality of children, all of this being a violation of the license agreement. The department warned 2×2 to remove them in order to avoid legal issues. The owners of 2×2 voiced their disagreement but reluctantly fulfilled the request. Later on, in 2021, the Oktyabrsky District Court in Saint Petersburg banned the series along with some films based on anime, claiming that the series &quot;contains elements of cruelty&quot; and that it &quot;is designed in a style common for American animation&quot; and that &quot;watching the animated series undoubtedly harms young children&#x27;s spiritual and moral education and development and contradicts the humanistic nature of upbringing inherent in Russia.&quot;

===Accolades===
== In other media ==
Fall Out Boy&#x27;s 2007 music video for their song &quot;The Carpal Tunnel of Love&quot; was directed by Kenn Navarro and stars characters from the series. The band members also make a cameo as animated characters.

A video game titled &quot;Happy Tree Friends: False Alarm&quot; was released on June 25, 2008. It was developed by Stainless Games and Sega for Xbox Live Arcade on the Xbox 360 and the PC. There was also an iOS game titled &quot;Happy Tree Friends: Deadeye Derby&quot;, released in 2014.

On August 17, 2023, Mondo Media and Ravenage Ltd. announced a crossover between Mondo&#x27;s &quot;Happy Tree Friends&quot; franchise and Ravenage&#x27;s shoot em&#x27; up video game &quot;The Crackpet Show&quot; as a downloadable expansion on the latter. Such expansion is titled &quot;The Crackpet Show: Happy Tree Friends Edition&quot; and was released on September 27 for the Steam, GOG.com, and Epic Games Store digital distribution services, as well as the Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5 and Nintendo Switch gaming consoles.

=== Spin-offs ===
A spin-off series called &quot;Ka-Pow!&quot; aired in September 2008 and is an anthology of action-oriented stories starring The Mole, Flippy, Splendid, and Buddhist Monkey. A total of six episodes have been produced.

In 2014, Kenn Navarro created &quot;D_Void&quot;, a show similar to &quot;Happy Tree Friends&quot;; only 2 episodes had been produced for the series. The 2 episodes of &quot;D_Void&quot; were later uploaded to the Mondo Media YouTube channel in the summer of 2020.

<doc id="877939" wikidata="Q646049" url="?curid=877939" title="Hyades (mythology)">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Hyades (; , popularly &quot;rain-makers&quot; or &quot;the rainy ones&quot;; from , but probably from ) are a sisterhood of nymphs that bring rain.

== Family ==
The Hyades were daughters of Atlas (by either Pleione or Aethra, one of the Oceanids) and sisters of Hyas in most tellings, although one version gives their parents as Hyas and Boeotia. The Hyades are sisters to the Pleiades and the Hesperides.

== Names ==
Their number varies from three in the earliest sources to fifteen in the late ones. The names are also variable, according to the mythographer, and include:
Additionally, Thyone and Prodice were supposed to be daughters of Hyas by Aethra, and have been added to the group of stars.

== Mythology ==
The main myth concerning them is envisioned to account for their collective name and to provide an etiology for their weepy raininess: Hyas was killed in a hunting accident and the Hyades wept from their grief. They were changed into a cluster of stars, the Hyades, set in the head of Taurus.

The Greeks believed that the heliacal rising and setting of the Hyades star cluster were always attended with rain, hence the association of the Hyades (sisters of Hyas) and the Hyades (daughters of ocean) with the constellation of the Hyades (rainy ones).

The Hyades are also thought to have been the tutors of Dionysus, in some tellings of the latter&#x27;s infancy, and as such are equated with the Nysiads, the nymphs who are also believed to have cared for Dionysus, as well as with other reputed nurses of the god—the Lamides, the Dodonides and the nymphs of Naxos. Some sources relate that they were subject to aging, but Dionysus, to express his gratitude for having raised him, asked Medea to restore their youth.

In Tennyson&#x27;s poem, Ulysses recalls his travels of old:

&quot;I cannot rest from travel: I will drink -
Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy&#x27;d -
Greatly, have suffer&#x27;d greatly, both with those - 
That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when -
Thro&#x27; scudding drifts the rainy Hyades -
Vext the dim sea ...&quot;

== In astronomy ==
A well-studied star cluster in Taurus and the open cluster nearest Earth is named after the Hyades of Greek mythology.

<text>Estepona () is a town and municipality in the comarca of the Costa del Sol, southern Spain. It is located in the province of Málaga, part of the autonomous community of Andalusia. Its district covers an area of 137 square kilometers in a fertile valley crossed by small streams and a mountainous areas dominated by the Sierra Bermeja, which reaches an elevation of 1,449 m at the peak of Los Reales.

Estepona is renowned for its beaches, which stretch along some 21 km of coastline. It is a popular resort and holiday destination.

Due to its natural environment, surrounded by the sea and the mountains, Estepona has a micro-climate with over 325 days of sunshine per year.

Estepona is a popular year-round holiday destination; it has two EC Blue Flag beaches, a modern sports marina with many tapas bars and restaurants. The white-walled town centre has many shops and picturesque squares. In the early 1990s, the Walt Disney Company chose Estepona as the original site for its Eurodisney project, but Paris, France, was later awarded the installation.

==History==
The area has been occupied since prehistoric times; stone-age tools and dolmens have been discovered. Romans occupied the area, but a seaquake destroyed their town or villa in the 4th century. Archeologists have unearthed some foundations and ceramics, although the disaster&#x27;s effects (together with massive redevelopment in the 1960s) make further finds unlikely. References to &#x27;Salduba&#x27; or &#x27;Silniana&#x27; as an important natural port in old documents may refer to this town, or possibly Marbella&#x27;s San Pedro Alcantara district.

The name &#x27;Estepona&#x27; probably comes from the Moorish &quot;Astabbuna&quot; or &quot;Al-extebunna.&quot; In 1342, the Battle of Estepona took place in the Bay of Estepona between the fleet of the Crown of Aragon and that of the Marinid Dynasty, with the victorious Aragonese fleet subsequently destroyed near Gibraltar, but Christian forces ultimately winning the Siege of Algeciras. Aben al Jhatib, writing in the late 14th century, mentioned the town as being in a state of decay, living on its reputation for culinary delicacies, with its monuments deteriorated. Henry IV of Castile captured the town from the Moors in 1457. A church was built over what had been the town mosque, and a town grew around it, although it too was subsequently destroyed and all that remains is the old clock tower (and the nearby Simon Fernandez school). San Luis castle was built for coastal defense against Berber pirates.

In 1502, the town (or the 25 Christian families resettled from northern Spain) received its first charter. However, it was governed as an administrative district of Marbella until 1729. Philip V of Spain then granted Estepona its own town charter. As the 20th century began, Estepona had 9000 residents, mostly farmers and fishermen.

In 1973, a culvert was built to allow the Monterroso river on Estepona&#x27;s western edge to run underground.

Gibraltar Airport is the nearest international airport serving Estepona. It is 45 km away and has direct flights to Manchester, London Heathrow Airport, London Gatwick and London Luton. Málaga Airport is the next nearest international airport serving Estepona and is located approximately 80 km away. Estepona is served by the Autovía A-7 which runs along the Costa del Sol. There is also a toll road, referred to as the Autopista AP-7, which provides faster travel along the route between Málaga and Estepona by-passing many of the urban areas along the route, such as Marbella. There are two toll stations en route and toll charges vary throughout the year. Normally you can travel from Málaga to Estepona for less than 10 euros in toll charges for a normal size car.

The Costa del Sol railway is planned to link Málaga to Estepona via Marbella.

==Estepona Port==
Estepona Port and Marina is a working fishing port offering restaurants and bars. The port features daily auctions for a wide variety of seafood. The port is also the location of the Estepona street market - a collection of stalls selling numerous textile and leather goods mostly. The market is usually in Estepona on Sundays but it travels around the Málaga province to areas like Puerto Banús, Marbella, Casares, Torremolinos, Fuengirola and more.

==Climate==
Estepona has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with very mild, humid winters and hot, very dry summers. The summers are hot and very dry, with normally stable temperatures but temperatures above are not rare. Winter temperatures are very mild, with average daytime highs around and lows around . The annual average temperature is over . The city gets more than 300 sunny days per year, and it gets between 2,800-3,000 sunshine hours on average.

==Places of interest==

Puerto Banús is an upscale community about 30 minutes’ drive away from Estepona Port, with a large number of designer stores.

Selwo Safari Park is styled after African safari parks and houses 2000 animals in semi-wild conditions. It is a 20-minute drive from Estepona Port on the public transport route.

&quot;Palacio de Exposiciones y Congresos de Estepona&quot; is the exhibition and congress centre of Estepona, located opposite the supermarket on the eastern edge of Estepona - closest to Marbella. This centre is home to nearly all of Estepona&#x27;s organised events including product presentations, fairs, commercial exhibitions, concerts and more.

&quot;Ruta de Murales Artísticos&quot; is an enjoyable walk around town that allows you to discover the Route of Artistic Murals which entails the facades of large buildings being used as canvases for more than 40 artistic paintings.

===Beaches===
Estepona has over 20 km of coastline, and 17 different beaches. Most of these are immediately next to the various hotels and residential complexes outside the town itself. The nearest beaches to the town are the &quot;Playa del Cristo&quot;, and the &quot;Playa de la Rada&quot;. The &quot;Playa del Cristo&quot; is five minutes west of Estepona Marina. It is a small, sheltered, cove with lifeguards in season and also two &quot;chiringuitos&quot; or beach front bar/restaurants, a rough car park, and children&#x27;s play area. As it is both sheltered from the east wind (locally known as &quot;Levante&quot;) and very shallow, it is very popular with families with primary-age children; this means that you need to come here early to get a seafront spot on the beach in July and August. &quot;La Rada Beach&quot; is much larger and more open; it is over 2.5 km in length, and runs from the marina past the Estepona Old Town to the beginning of the boardwalk near the big Carrefour supermarket in the east. It is the town&#x27;s main beach, is backed by a very attractive Paseo Maritimo seafront promenade, and has every facility: bars, restaurants, play areas for children, showers, lavatories, access points for those in wheelchairs, and of course lifeguards in season. Parking is in the underground car parks along the seafront. There is also a popular naturist/nudist beach of Costa Natura to the west of Estepona, which was the first official naturist site in Spain.

===Estepona Old Town - Centro Historico===

The San Luis castle (&quot;Castillo de San Luis&quot;) dates to the 15th century when Queen Isabella I ordered it built to protect the town against the Moorish invaders. Most of the narrow streets and small, one-storey, houses were built in the 18th and 19th centuries, and until the mid 1950s many had no running water or sanitation. Since then, many have had a second storey built (sometimes with a roof terrace on top), all have electricity and all mod-cons, and most are in the more than 100 streets and plazas that have been improved and embellished by having the street repaved, sewers re-installed, and flowerpots provided - and filled - by the Ayuntamiento, the Town Council. Each street has its own colour scheme. The local residents take pride in their attractive streets, mainly traffic free nowadays. Unlike many other Old Towns in Andalucia, these streets are not lined with row after row of shops and bars.

=== Restaurants ===
Estepona is not known for the &quot;night club&quot; culture found in some areas on the Costa del Sol, but does have a wide variety of bar and restaurants. Dining choices emphasise locally caught seafood, and range from local Spanish cuisine to other Mediterranean cuisines, including Italian and French. Many restaurants have terraces allowing diners to eat &quot;al fresco&quot; (outside) during the late evening.

Most restaurants are located near the seafront, either along the main promenade fronting the sea or along Calle Real. There are a number of small plazas or squares next to Calle Real, on which numerous restaurants can be found.

===Shopping===
Estepona&#x27;s small and medium-size local shops, particularly in the old town, offer locally made produce and goods. The recently renovated indoor market in the town centre has stalls offering fresh meat, fish and vegetables. Boutiques in the main town centre offer contemporary international clothing brands and other goods. Typical of Spanish towns of this size, a market is held in the main square (on Wednesdays), featuring clothing as well as food and vegetables. Estepona port also hosts a Sunday market for &quot;touristy&quot; goods.

There are no large shopping complexes in Estepona. The main food stores are the hipermercado complex at the edge of the town, a smaller express store in the middle of the town and several supermarkets. Two supermarkets in the port area feature fresh produce, meat and seafood as well as convenience style foods. The nearest large department stores are the complex just off the north ringroad of Marbella, and the department stores in Puerto Banús, just before Marbella. Both can be accessed by traveling east from Estepona towards Málaga on the A7.

==Sport==
Cycling and tennis are popular in Estepona, with many road races held in the area, and three major tennis clubs. The many golf courses around Estepona include:

*Estepona Golf
*Valle Romano Golf Club
*La Duquesa Golf &amp; Country Club

<text>Hurricane Isidore was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused widespread flooding and heavy damage across Mexico, Cuba, and the United States in September 2002. The ninth named storm and the second hurricane in the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, and the fifth of eight named storms to occur in September of that year, Isidore peaked as a Category 3 hurricane, causing damage, as well as four fatalities in Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico, and the United States. Isidore is also noted for threatening to strike the northern Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane, however, the storm struck the region as a moderately strong tropical storm, due to a track change that brought the storm over the Yucatán Peninsula for over a day, which significantly weakened the cyclone in the process. The primary impact from the storm was the heavy rainfall, which fell across southeast Mexico, and also from the central United States Gulf coast into the Ohio Valley.

==Meteorological history==

On September 9, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa. Despite moving through a dry environment, its convection became organized as an anticyclone developed over the wave. On September 14, convection was well-organized enough around a small closed wind circulation to classify the system as Tropical Depression Ten near Trinidad and Tobago. Land interaction from Venezuela later weakened the depression back to a tropical wave. The wave continued west-northwestward through the Caribbean, and redeveloped into a tropical depression on September 17 while south of Jamaica.

Embedded within a weak steering current, it drifted to the northwest, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Isidore on September 18 near Jamaica. After grazing the island, it quickly intensified to a hurricane late on September 19 while south of Cuba. Isidore&#x27;s maximum sustained winds reached near the Isle of Youth, and weakened slightly to an hurricane as it made landfall on Cabo Frances late on September 20. The hurricane crossed the island, then slowed as it moved westward across the Gulf of Mexico. Favorable conditions aloft with warm water temperatures allowed Isidore to quickly intensify to a peak of winds on September 21.

Despite Dvorak satellite estimates of , reconnaissance aircraft indicated Isidore remained a Category 3 hurricane, with pressures dropping to , typical of a Category 4 hurricane. It is the lowest minimum pressure ever observed for an Atlantic hurricane which did not exceed Category 3 intensity. With nearly ideal conditions for development, Isidore was forecast to reach winds of over the northern Gulf of Mexico. High pressures to its north forced it southward, and Isidore made landfall at Telchac Puerto in Yucatán as a major hurricane on September 22. It weakened rapidly as it nearly stalled over Yucatán, and was only a minimal tropical storm after being inland for 30 hours.
The inner core of convection collapsed while over southeast Mexico, and upon moving northward and reaching the Gulf of Mexico again, it was a large but weak tropical storm. Conditions favored significant strengthening, but Isidore did not redevelop central convection until reaching the northern Gulf of Mexico. The strengthening system hit Grand Isle, Louisiana on September 26 with maximum sustained winds of , but weakened quickly into a tropical depression after moving inland. The system raced to the northeast, and became an extratropical cyclone on September 27 before becoming absorbed in a frontal zone over Pennsylvania that night.

==Preparations==

Before Isidore became a hurricane, there were fears that the storm would end up being a significant threat. The upper-level environment ahead of the storm was very favorable, and the oceanic heat content was very high. Just ten months after the destructive Hurricane Michelle, Hurricane Isidore threatened to cause similar effects in Cuba. In preparation for the storm, about 292,000 people and thousands of farm animals were evacuated in the Pinar del Río province. Hurricane Warnings were posted about 48 hours before landfall, leaving ample time to prepare for the storm.

Once in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Isidore became a major Category 3 storm with winds of . The forecasts then predicted Isidore to move westward in the Gulf of Mexico for a few days, before turning northward towards the Gulf Coast as what was predicted by then to be a strong Category 4 hurricane. Initially expected to remain north of the peninsula, hurricane warnings were issued just over a day prior to landfall, with no watch preceding Isidore&#x27;s passage. More than 70,000 people were evacuated, and ports on the Gulf coast of Yucatán were closed. Mexican authorities declared a state of emergency prior to the arrival of the storm. Due to Isidore&#x27;s unexpected southward turn into the Yucatán Peninsula, Isidore weakened significantly to a tropical storm which limited potential damage along the United States Gulf Coast. In preparation for the hurricane, the Red Cross mobilized its members across Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida days before Isidore&#x27;s expected landfall. Volunteers were sent in the days prior to ensure families had a family disaster plan and a disaster supplies kit in their household. Hurricane watches raised for the United States Gulf coast between Cameron, Louisiana and Pascagoula, Mississippi late on the morning of September 24 were discontinued early on the morning of September 25, when the storm was no longer expected to restrengthen into a hurricane.

==Impact==

===Caribbean islands===
In the Windward Islands, Isidore was a weak tropical depression that caused no reported damage or casualties. The Cayman Islands reported tropical storm force winds, and likely experienced flooding to some degree, but Isidore caused no reported damage or casualties. Isidore brought heavy rains to Jamaica, totalling at Cotton Tree Gully.

===Cuba===

Hurricane Isidore brought torrential rainfall, with many areas reporting over of rain. The maximum reported was at Isabel Rubio in western Cuba. The rainfall, combined with a storm surge, destroyed 77 houses, caused power outages, uprooted trees and blew off roofs. Over 130 tobacco drying houses were affected to some degree, damaging valuable tobacco stock. A total of 24,000 metric tons of citrus and 132 metric tons of coffee were lost from the storm. Thousands of livestock perished. No deaths were reported.

===Southeast Mexico===

Hurricane Isidore was one of only four storms to hit the north side of the Yucatán since records have been kept. It was the first tropical cyclone to hit the area since Tropical Depression Greta in 1970, the first tropical storm since 1935, the first hurricane since 1888, and only major hurricane to ever hit the area.

The storm shut down the oil production of PEMEX, the Mexican state oil company. Drilling operations, as well as exports from Mexico, stopped for one week which cost the oil company US$108.7 million. The Gulf Coast island of Isla Arena was nearly covered by Isidore&#x27;s storm surge. Its residents evacuated prior to the storm&#x27;s passage.

Hurricane Isidore hit near Mérida, Yucatán, as a hurricane, and remained over the area for around 36 hours. Over of rainfall fell, with the maximum recorded near Campeche. The storm surge reached as high as over southern portions of Yucatán state. Nearly one-third of all fishing vessels were damaged by Isidore. Nearly 36,500 houses were destroyed in Yucatán from the intense winds, 83,000 homes damaged, and 500,000 were left homeless. Downed trees and power lines were common over much of the northern Yucatán Peninsula, and 75% of barns and warehouses were either severely damaged or destroyed. Damage to crops and livestock was extreme; 2,000 square kilometres of maize and 400 square kilometres of fruit trees were damaged across the country. A total of 70% of the poultry production and livestock were lost during the storm in Yucatán. Damage to Mexico&#x27;s power grid reached US$19.76 million. Over one-fourth of the roads across the peninsula were moderately or severely damaged, which resulted in losses of US$9.88 million to rural areas. Farming in Campeche experienced significant damage, with 30,000 cattle and 100,000 acres (400 km2) of agricultural land lost.

Throughout the Yucatán Peninsula, there were 17 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Isidore, two of which were indirectly related to the storm. Damage in the country totaled $950 million (2002 USD).

===Central America===
Isidore caused heavy rains in Guatemala due to upslope flow from the Pacific Ocean, which led to landslides and flooding across southern and western portions of the country. The rains led to the drowning of two people when they tried to cross a rain-swollen river. Three hundred and fifty households reported losses.

===Eastern United States===
In the open Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Isidore and later Hurricane Lili contributed to the shutdown of offshore oil and gas platforms. The effects of back-to-back storms resulted in the loss of production of of oil and of natural gas. A storm surge of was measured at Rigoletes, Louisiana and at Gulfport Harbor, Mississippi. Hurricane Isidore brought widespread heavy rainfall from the central Gulf coast into the Ohio Valley, with a maximum of at Metairie, Louisiana. The flooding was responsible for moderate crop damage, with a total of $330 million in damage (2002 USD). Isidore claimed five lives in the U.S.: four direct and one indirect. The indirect death was from a man that went into cardiac arrest in Mississippi, whereas the other four were drowning deaths.

===Retirement===

On account of the widespread flooding and heavy damage caused by the hurricane, the World Meteorological Organization retired name &quot;Isidore&quot; in the spring of 2003, and it will never again be used for a North Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with &quot;Ike&quot; for the 2008 season.

<text>George Rosenberg Roberts (born 1943) is an American financier. He is one of the three original partners of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), which he co-founded alongside Jerome Kohlberg and first cousin Henry Kravis in 1976.

==Early life==
George Roberts was born into a Jewish family in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Culver Military Academy in 1962 and received the institution&#x27;s &quot;Man of the Year&quot; Award in 1998. He attended Claremont McKenna College, graduating in 1966, and the University of California&#x27;s Hastings College of the Law, graduating in 1969.

==Career==
Roberts worked for Bear Stearns in the late 1960s and early 1970s becoming a partner at the age of 29. While at Bear Stearns, Roberts, alongside Kohlberg and Kravis, began a series of what they described as &quot;bootstrap&quot; investments. Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973) as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Although they had a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.

By 1976, tensions had built up between Bear Stearns and the trio of Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts leading to their departure and the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities. Early investors in KKR included Henry Hillman By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising the first institutional fund with investor commitments.

He has an estimated net worth of $5.9 billion .

==Personal life==
In 1968, he married Leanne Bovet, daughter of Eric B. Bovet and Dorothy Champion of San Mateo, California. Eric Bovet was the son of Swiss immigrant Louis Bovet and Grace Borel; Grace Borel was the daughter of Swiss immigrant Antoine Borel, a prominent banker in San Francisco and San Mateo. Leanne Bovet died in 2003.

On May 22, 2010, he married Goldman Sachs partner Linnea Conrad.

==Philanthropic and public positions==
Roberts is the founder and chairman of the boards of directors of non-profit organizations such as the Roberts Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), which focuses on job creation for people facing significant barriers to work. He also serves as a trustee of Claremont McKenna College and Culver Military Academy, and is a board member of the San Francisco Symphony, the San Francisco Ballet and the Fine Arts Museum.

In 2012, he donated $50 million to Claremont McKenna College. He again donated $140 million to CMC in 2022.

<doc id="877959" wikidata="Q765372" url="?curid=877959" title="KQED-FM">
<text>KQED-FM (88.5 MHz) is a listener-supported, non-commercial public radio station in San Francisco, California. It is simulcast on KQEI-FM (89.3 MHz) in the Sacramento metropolitan area. The parent organization is KQED Inc., which also owns two PBS member television stations: KQED (channel 9) and KQEH (channel 54). Studios are on Mariposa Street in the Mission District of San Francisco.

KQED-FM is grandfathered at an unusually high effective radiated power (ERP) of 110,000 watts. The transmitter is along Radio Road, atop San Bruno Mountain, in Brisbane. KQEI-FM has an ERP of 3,300 watts, with its tower on Sorento Road in Elverta.

==Programming==
KQED-FM is one of the most-listened-to public radio stations in the United States. It often ranks first in the San Francisco radio market in the Nielsen ratings. In addition to local programming, KQED-FM carries content from major public radio distributors such as National Public Radio, the Public Radio Exchange and American Public Media, with the BBC World Service heard late nights. Popular NPR shows carried by KQED-FM and KQEI-FM include &quot;Morning Edition, All Things Considered, Fresh Air, Here and Now&quot; and &quot;Marketplace&quot;. Weekend shows include &quot;Wait, Wait...Don&#x27;t Tell Me, Radiolab, On The Media, Code Switch, Latino USA, Hidden Brain, Freakonomics Radio, This American Life, The Moth Radio Hour, The New Yorker Radio Hour&quot; and &quot;The Splendid Table&quot;.

Among the locally produced shows are &quot;Forum with Mina Kim and Alexis Madrigal&quot;, &quot;The California Report&quot; and &quot;Tech Nation&quot;. The KQED-FM newsroom prepares frequent local and California news updates which air between programs, in addition to hourly newscasts from NPR.

In addition to over-the-air broadcasts, KQED-FM audio is carried on Comcast digital cable channel 960 with live streaming audio from its website and from the iHeartRadio platform. &quot;Forum&quot; is carried live, nationwide, on Sirius Satellite Radio. KQED also offers an extensive audio archive and podcasts of previous shows for download.

One of the most famous programs to have been broadcast on KQED was &quot;An Hour with Pink Floyd&quot;, a 60-minute performance by Pink Floyd recorded in 1970 without an audience at the station&#x27;s studio. The program was broadcast only twice—once in 1970, and once again in 1981. The setlist included &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, &quot;Cymbaline&quot;, &quot;Grantchester Meadows&quot;, &quot;Green Is the Colour&quot;, &quot;Careful with That Axe, Eugene&quot;, and &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot;.

==History==
===KXKX===
The San Francisco Theological Seminary, a Presbyterian group, began broadcasting with station KXKX in April 1963. The new 110,000-watt station signed on two years after the seminary received a construction permit from the FCC in August 1961. In addition to Christian radio programming, the station&#x27;s subcarrier broadcast theology courses to receivers at 44 Bay Area churches.

When agencies of the Presbyterian Church (USA) could no longer support the station, KXKX signed off at midnight on the evening of June 29, 1967.

===KQED-FM===
In July 1968, the San Francisco Theological Seminary filed to sell KXKX to the Bay Area Educational Television Association, owner of public television station KQED (channel 9). The station returned to the air as KQED-FM in mid-1969, originally using the studios at 286 Divisadero Street inherited from the seminary. The founding manager was Bernard Mayes, who later went on to be executive vice president of KQED television and also co-founder and chairman of NPR.

The first programming of KQED-FM included news, &#x27;street radio&#x27; broadcast live from local street corners, drama and music. In its third year on the air, KQED-FM became one of the first 80 network affiliates of National Public Radio, one of five in California. It aired the first edition of &quot;All Things Considered.&quot; Later, due to reduced funding, Mayes opened the air to &#x27;Tribal Radio&#x27; - productions by local non-profit groups, some in their own languages.

===Expansion into Sacramento===
In 2003, KQED Radio expanded to the Sacramento metropolitan area by purchasing KEBR-FM on 89.3 MHz. The station is licensed to the suburban community of North Highlands. It signed on the air on .

KEBR-FM 89.3 was originally owned by Family Radio, a Christian broadcaster based in Oakland at the time. The KEBR-FM call letters and format moved to a more powerful FM station on 88.1 MHz in Sacramento. KQED Radio changed the call sign on 89.3 FM to KQEI-FM. It became a full-time simulcast of KQED-FM in San Francisco.

==Locally-produced shows==
In 2023, KQED acquired &quot;Snap Judgment&quot; and &quot;Spooked&quot; podcasts.

==Additional frequencies==
In addition to the main station, KQED-FM is relayed by these stations and translators to widen its broadcast area.

KQED and KQEI also broadcast using HD Radio technology.

<text>Mark Edward Langston (born August 20, 1960) is an American former Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher. He pitched for the Seattle Mariners (1984–1989), Montreal Expos (1989), California / Anaheim Angels (1990–1997), San Diego Padres (1998), and Cleveland Indians (1999). During a 16-year baseball career, Langston compiled 179 wins, 2,464 strikeouts, and a 3.97 earned run average (ERA).

==Baseball career==
Langston attended Buchser High School in Santa Clara, California. After graduating in 1978, he was selected in the 15th round (377th overall) of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft by the Chicago Cubs, who offered him $10,000 to sign with the team. However, he chose not to sign with the Cubs and attend college. In a 2018 interview, Langston told MLB.com, &quot;I was 17 when I graduated from high school. It would have been interesting – I didn&#x27;t turn 18 until August, so I don&#x27;t know how I would have handled that, as a kid that&#x27;s really never been anywhere. It&#x27;s completely different than what these kids were exposed to in the Draft now, where they play on all these different select teams and all that. We didn&#x27;t have any of that, so it would have been really my first big time away from home, and I don&#x27;t know how it would have panned out.&quot;

Langston pitched collegiately at San Jose State and was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the second round (35th overall) of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft. He was chosen as a compensation pick from the Texas Rangers for the signing of Bill Stein, and signed with the Mariners for $40,000. Langston debuted for the Mariners in 1984 with fellow rookie Alvin Davis. He made his major league debut on April 7, 1984, allowing two earned runs in seven innings while striking out five to earn the win against the Milwaukee Brewers. Davis&#x27; performance won him the American League Rookie of the Year award, but Langston&#x27;s performance was voted worthy of the Rookie Pitcher of the Year award, as he finished the year with a 17–10 record, a 3.40 ERA, and a league-leading 204 strikeouts in 35 games (33 starts). He also led the majors in walks, with 118. He went on to lead the league in strikeouts two more times while playing for the Mariners, recording 245 strikeouts in 1986, and 262 in 1987. In 1989, Langston began the season 4–5 with a 3.56 ERA in 10 starts before being traded.

After rejecting a three-year, $7.1 million contract extension, the Mariners traded Langston, who was their top pitcher at the time, to the Montreal Expos with pitcher Mike Campbell for pitchers Randy Johnson, Gene Harris and Brian Holman on May 25, 1989. He made 24 starts with the Expos, going 12–9 with a 2.39 ERA and 175 strikeouts in innings. Combined between Seattle and Montreal, Langston went 16–14 with a career-low 2.74 ERA in 34 total starts.

On December 1, 1989, Langston signed a five-year, $16 million contract with the California Angels as a free agent, making him the highest-paid player in baseball at the time. In his first start with the Angels on April 11, 1990, he pitched the first seven innings for a 2–0 combined no-hitter with Mike Witt. Witt, who had pitched a perfect game back in 1984, tossed the final two frames. This combined no-hitter remained the last one in Angels history until Ervin Santana pitched a no-hitter on July 27, 2011.

Langston was the Angels&#x27; starting pitcher for the 1995 American League West tie-breaker game against the Seattle Mariners. He earned the loss, allowing five runs (four earned) on eight hits in innings as the Mariners advanced to the first American League Division Series.

On January 7, 1998, Langston signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres. He appeared in 22 games (16 starts) for the Padres in 1998, going 4–6 with a 5.86 ERA. In the 1998 World Series, Langston&#x27;s 2–2 pitch to Tino Martinez appeared to be over the plate, but was called ball three by home plate umpire Rich Garcia; Langston&#x27;s next pitch was hit for a grand slam in the seventh inning of Game 1 to give the New York Yankees a 9–5 lead. The Yankees went on to sweep the Padres in four games.

After the 1998 season, Langston re-signed with the Padres for the 1999 season, but initially announced his retirement from baseball near the end of Spring Training. However, he changed his mind shortly after, and signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians on April 4, 1999. He went 1–2 with a 5.25 ERA in 25 games (five starts) with Cleveland. On March 20, 2000, Langston officially retired from baseball.

Noted for his pickoff move to first base, his 91 career pickoffs were, at the time of his retirement, the most in baseball history. Langston is one of only eight pitchers in MLB history to pick off three runners in a single game which he accomplished against the Cubs in 1989. Today, he has the fourth-most pickoffs in baseball history, behind only Kenny Rogers, Terry Mulholland and Andy Pettitte, all of them also left-handed pitchers.

==Broadcasting==
Langston serves as a radio color commentator for the Los Angeles Angels during all games and is also a co-host of the Angels post-game call-in show &quot;Angel Talk&quot; on radio station KLAA.

On September 20, 2019, after announcing the starting lineups for an away game against the Houston Astros, Langston suffered from ventricular fibrillation and collapsed in the broadcast booth. He was revived and taken to a hospital, where he later had a defibrillator installed; Jose Mota took over Langston&#x27;s place in the radio broadcasts. Langston returned to California on September 28 and resumed his Angels radio duties the next day.

==Personal life==
Right after retirement Langston was the head coach for Lutheran High School of Orange County for two years.

Langston appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;Sabrina, The Teenage Witch&quot;, entitled &quot;To Tell a Mortal&quot;, where he plays catch with Harvey.

<doc id="877961" wikidata="Q7120817" url="?curid=877961" title="PS Comet">
<text>The PS (paddle steamer ) Comet was built in 1812 for Henry Bell, a Scottish engineer who with his wife had become proprietor of the Baths Hotel offering sea bathing in Helensburgh. On 15 August 1812, Bell&#x27;s ship began a passenger service on the River Clyde, connecting Helensburgh to Greenock and Glasgow. This was the first commercially successful steamboat service in Europe. Bell obtained the engine from John Robertson of Glasgow, and the ship was built for him by John and Charles Wood of Port Glasgow.&lt;ref name=&quot;1 in Euro/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Henry Bell had become interested in steam-propelled boats, and to learn from the &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot; venture corresponded with Robert Fulton, who got the &quot;North River Steamboat&quot; (also known as the &quot;Clermont&quot;) into operation in 1807 as the first commercially successful steamboat.

In the winter of 1811/1812 Bell got John and Charles Wood of John Wood and Company, shipbuilders of Port Glasgow, to build a paddle steamer which was named &quot;Comet&quot;, named after the &quot;Great Comet&quot; of 1811. The 28 ton burthen craft had a deck long with a beam of . It had two paddle wheels on each side, driven by a single-cylinder engine rated at . The engine was made by John Robertson of Glasgow, and the boiler by David Napier, Camlachie, Glasgow (a story has it that they were evolved from an experimental little steam engine which Bell installed to pump sea water into the Helensburgh Baths). The funnel was tall and thin, serving as a mast, with a yard, allowing it to support a square sail when there was a following wind. A small cabin aft had wooden seats in front of concealed beds and a table. &quot;Comet&quot; was reported as &quot;brightly painted, having for her figurehead a lady garbed in all the colours of the rainbow&quot;.

&quot;Comet&quot; was launched on 24 July 1812 with her trial run on 6 August from Port Glasgow to the Broomielaw in Glasgow, taking three and a half hours for the . The double paddlewheels were found to be unsatisfactory and a pair of single wheels were substituted which increased her speed to almost 7 knots.

On 15 August 1812, Bell advertised in a local newspaper &quot;The Greenock Advertiser&quot;, that the Comet would begin a regular passenger service from that day, a distance of each way:

On 15 August &quot;Comet&quot; made the first commercial sailing from Glasgow for Bowling, Helensburgh and Greenock, opening the era of the steamboat on the Clyde, and more widely in Britain and Europe. The fare was &quot;four shillings for the best cabin, and three shillings for the second.&quot; As the vessel clearly had no cabins in the modern sense it is unclear what this meant.
The success of this service quickly inspired competition, with services down the Firth of Clyde and the sea lochs to Largs, Rothesay, Campbeltown and Inveraray within four years, and the &quot;Comet&quot; was outclassed by newer steamers. Bell briefly tried a service on the Firth of Forth.

==Famous passengers==

*Sir Walter Scott
*James Watt (in 1816, visiting his home town of Greenock in old age) – by this date Bell offered a return trip from Glasgow to Rothesay on the same day which Watt undertook.

==Wreck==

Bell had the &quot;Comet&quot; lengthened and re-engined, and from September 1819 ran a service to Oban and Fort William (via the Crinan Canal), a trip which took four days. On 15 December 1820 the &quot;Comet&quot; was wrecked in strong currents at Craignish Point near Oban, with Bell on board. There were no deaths. One of the engines ended its working days in a Greenock brewery, and is now in The Science Museum in London.

==Fate==
In 1875, the schooner &quot;Ann&quot; was driven against a steamship at Greenock, Renfrewshire and sank. The &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; reported a piece from the &quot;Greenock Telegraph&quot; which stated &quot;part of the hull of the Ann was all that was left of Henry Bell&#x27;s old Comet, the first steam-vessel ever to sail in European waters. Some years ago she was bought up by Smillie, of Glasgow, and Bell&#x27;s old engine taken out. She was lengthened, made a schooner, and was run on the Larne trade, where she was at great favourite, and was familiarly called the &#x27;Long Ann&#x27;. Some time since she was burnt down to the waters edge, but her hull was so good, and she was such a favourite with her owners, that they hauled her into dock and fitted her. The curious thing is, that having been built at Port-Glasgow 63 years ago, and undergoing many vicissitudes, she should, like an old weather-beaten sailor, end her days almost at the threshold of her own home.&quot;

==&quot;Comet II&quot;==
Bell built another vessel, &quot;Comet II&quot;, but on 21 October 1825 she collided with the steamer &quot;Ayr&quot; off Kempock Point, Gourock, Scotland.

&quot;Comet II&quot; sank very quickly, killing 62 of the estimated 80 passengers on board, including the son-in-law of John Anderson, a friend of Robert Burns. Also drowned were recently married Captain Wemyss Erskine Sutherland of the 33rd Regiment and Sarah née Duff of Muirtown. After the loss of his second ship, Bell abandoned his work on steam navigation.

==Replica==

A replica of the &quot;Comet&quot;, situated in Port Glasgow, was built by Lithgows shipyard apprentices in 1962 for the 150th anniversary of the original. As part of the anniversary celebrations the replica sailed from Port Glasgow to Helensburgh and back, accompanied by a flotilla of small ships.

In 2011, just before the original&#x27;s 200th anniversary, the replica was restored by a partnership of Inverclyde Council, Ferguson Shipbuilders and an organisation called The Trust. The restoration cost £180,000.

A survey and condition report was commissioned by Inverclyde Council and reported back in 2019. The survey found that the wooden hull of the replica is in such bad condition that it is beyond economic repair, and recommended that the machinery be removed and placed in a new hull.

In April 2023, the replica ship was dismantled and the woodwork scrapped by Inverclyde Council. No trace of the replica ship remains at the site.

<text>Clifford Thomas Ward (10 February 1944 – 18 December 2001) was an English singer-songwriter, best known for his career as a solo artist. Ward&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Home Thoughts&quot; remains his best known recording and he had hit singles with &quot;Gaye&quot; and &quot;Scullery&quot;. His reluctance to tour in support of recorded work may have affected his chances of more substantial mainstream success.

==Early life==
Born in Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire, Ward was the fifth child of Kathleen and Frank Ward, a carpet factory worker whose grandparents had been Irish music-hall artistes. Ward had one older sister and three older brothers, and as children, he and his siblings picked fruit on a local farm to supplement the family income. He was educated at Stourport secondary modern school and King Charles grammar school at Kidderminster. At school he spent some time as a choir boy. He met his future wife, Pat, at school when they were teenagers. They later married after Pat became pregnant with the first of their four children.

They initially lived in Castle Road, then Stourbridge Road in Kidderminster, for several years and both were active in raising funds for cerebral palsy, a condition their daughter Debbie had from birth. He was also an English teacher for about a year and a half at North Bromsgrove High School.

==Early career==
In 1962, shortly after leaving school and supporting himself with a series of clerical jobs, Ward formed a beat band Cliff Ward and the Cruisers, which won the 1963 Midland Band of the Year contest in Birmingham. The band was popular in Birmingham and also in demand at American Army bases in France. It was during this time abroad that Ward wrote &quot;Home Thoughts from Abroad&quot; (a song that would later appear on his second solo album and also as the B-side of &quot;Gaye&quot;). In the mid-1960s and after several member changes, the group was renamed Martin Raynor and The Secrets, with Ward in the role of the elusive Raynor. The fictitious name was soon dropped and the band continued on as Raynor&#x27;s Secrets and as Simon&#x27;s Secrets, and went on to tour around Britain and France, achieving moderate success. Along the way, six singles were recorded by the group (ten of the songs penned by Ward himself), though these made little impact.

==Solo career==
In 1967, following the demise of The Secrets, Ward decided he needed to get &quot;a real job&quot;. He enrolled at Worcester Teacher Training College and subsequently taught at North Bromsgrove High School teaching English and Drama. One of his pupils was the future wife of Sting, Trudie Styler, and another was Underworld singer Karl Hyde. The children heard singing on Ward&#x27;s early albums were from North Bromsgrove High School.

In his spare time, he continued songwriting and recorded his first solo album &quot;Singer Songwriter&quot;, released in 1972 on Dandelion Records (a label formed by the disc jockey John Peel) just before it went into liquidation. As a result, the album received little media coverage and went largely unnoticed. Signing a new recording contract with Charisma Records, Ward went on to have a hit with the single &quot;Gaye&quot;. It sold over a million copies worldwide and reached number 8 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1973.

In July 1973, following the success of &quot;Gaye&quot;, Ward&#x27;s second album &quot;Home Thoughts&quot; achieved healthy sales and reached number 40 in the UK Albums Chart. At this point, he gave up the teaching profession to concentrate on music full-time. He made a rare public appearance in July, performing &quot;Gaye&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. According to Allmusic, the song &quot;Wherewithal&quot; from the &quot;Home Thoughts&quot; album is &quot;infectious and lyrically excellent&quot; and it was surprising that it failed to chart. In January 1974, Ward entered the UK singles chart again at number 37 with &quot;Scullery&quot;, a track from his third album &quot;Mantle Pieces&quot;.

Subsequent singles including &quot;No More Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, &quot;Jigsaw Girl&quot;, &quot;Ocean of Love&quot; and &quot;I Got Lost Tonight&quot; (written by the US singer-songwriter Tim Moore, one of the very rare occasions when he recorded outside material) were given airtime by BBC Radio presenters, but Ward never made it into the UK singles chart again. In the late 1970s, Justin de Villeneuve became his manager. It was said that he would have had more commercial success were it not for his dislike of touring, public appearances, interviews and photo shoots. Ward&#x27;s manager in the early 1970s, Clive Selwood, said that Ward&#x27;s lack of touring contributed to his limited commercial success, stating: &quot;Clifford should have been a major, major star – he had hits, but he simply wouldn&#x27;t perform publicly.&quot;

&quot;The Best is Yet to Come&quot;, from the album &quot;Both of Us&quot;, enjoyed success when covered by Justin Hayward, and his songs have been recorded by Cliff Richard, Jack Jones, Art Garfunkel, Judy Collins and more recently by Brian Kennedy and Rumer.

== Illness ==
In 1987, Ward was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). He continued to record and write songs while living at home, cared for by his wife, Pat. In 1994, Ward was interviewed by a local newspaper, the Wolverhampton &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot;. He told reporter Aidan Goldstraw: &quot;I have not and will not come to terms with this illness. There are times — usually quite late at night — when I&#x27;m almost normal again. But unless they find a cure for this dreadful MS, then I don&#x27;t see a future&quot;.

Ward recorded his eleventh and what would be his final album, &quot;Julia and Other New Stories&quot;, crawling on all fours into his home-based recording studio to finish it. At around the same time, a stage musical, &quot;Shattered World&quot;, was produced as a tribute to him, based on his life and his battle against MS. Half of the songs were Ward&#x27;s own, and half were numbers written by others about him.

==Death==
In November 2001, Ward contracted pneumonia and died in Tenbury Community Hospital a few weeks later on 18 December 2001.

<doc id="877969" wikidata="Q1768425" url="?curid=877969" title="List of colonial governors of the Gambia">
<text>This is a list of colonial governors and administrators in the Gambia from the establishment of a British settlement on St Mary&#x27;s Island, now known as Banjul Island, in 1816, through to the Gambia Colony and Protectorate&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom in 1965.

The official title of the Commandant of St Mary&#x27;s Island was given as the Commandant of the British Settlement at St Mary&#x27;s in 1823. In 1821, the Gambia became a British colony that formed part of Sierra Leone. In 1829, a Lieutenant Governor was appointed that was subordinate to the Governor of Sierra Leone. Between 1843 and 1866, the Gambia had its own Governor independent of Sierra Leone. It once again became subordinate in 1866, with an Administrator being appointed to govern the territory. An independent Governor was again appointed in 1901 that also acted as the Commander-in-Chief of the colony.

The Gambia achieved independence in 1965. Thereafter, the viceroy of the British Crown in the Gambia became the Governor-General of the Gambia, until it renounced the Queen as head of state in 1970.

==Before 1816==
Before 1816, the colonial presence in the Gambia was restricted to James Island (known as St Andrew&#x27;s Island from 1456 to 1660, and as Kunta Kinteh Island since 2011).

<doc id="877975" wikidata="Q1536514" url="?curid=877975" title="U engine">
<text>A U engine is a piston engine made up of two separate straight engines (complete with separate crankshafts) placed side-by-side and coupled to a shared output shaft. When viewed from the front, the engine block resembles the letter &quot;U&quot;.

Although much less common than the similar V engine design, several U engines were produced from 1915 to 1987 for use in airplanes, racing cars, racing and road motorcycles, locomotives, and tanks.

== Design ==

The main benefit of a U engine layout is the ability to share common parts with a straight engine upon which is it based. Additionally, if the two crankshafts rotate in opposite directions, the gyroscopic effect of the rotating components in each cylinder bank cancel each other out.

A V engine is typically more compact and lighter than a U engine, in part due to the lack of a second crankshaft, making V engines far more common than U engines. However, the V engine does not cancel the gyroscopic effect.

The H engine layout uses a similar concept to U engines, whereby two flat engines are stacked vertically.

== History ==
=== Petrol engines ===
The first U engine known to have been built was the 1915–1916 Bugatti U-16 aircraft engine, which had 16 cylinders and a displacement of . Approximately 40 engines were built at the Duesenberg factory in the United States during World War I. A small number of engines based on the Bugatti U engine were also produced after the war by Breguet Aviation in France.

The &quot;Fiat 806&quot; was a 1927 Grand Prix racing car that was powered by a twelve-cylinder U engine. This engine, designated the &#x27;Type 406&#x27;, used a supercharger and had a single centrally-mounted intake camshaft which operated the intake valves located on the inside of each cylinder bank. Two separate camshafts operated the exhaust valves (one per bank). On test the unit delivered 187 bhp at 8,500 rpm at maximum boost. The Fiat 806 car competed in only one race, the Milan Grand Prix on 4 September 1927 (not to be confused with the 500 km 1927 Italian Grand Prix held on the same day). The race was won by the Fiat 806; however, Fiat then retired from Grand Prix racing and the Type 806 did not race again.

The 1931–1959 Ariel Square Four motorcycle used a four-cylinder engine (also called a &#x27;square four&#x27; engine). The engine was compact and had as narrow a frontal area as a 500 cc, parallel twin. The rear pair of cylinders on this air-cooled engine were prone to overheating.

The 1985–1987 Suzuki RG500 motorcycle, and several related racing motorcycles, used a water-cooled four-cylinder U engine. Although some racing success was achieved, the road bikes did not sell well and the design was phased out in favour of a conventional inline-four engine.

===Diesel===
In the 1930s Sulzer Brothers Ltd. began production of an &#x27;LD series&#x27; twelve-cylinder U engine for use in rail locomotives. The LD series was replaced by the LDA series, for a combined production period of over 50 years. The Sulzer 12LDA twin-bank engine formed the mainstay of British locomotives built in the 1960s, with over 700 used in the &quot;Peak&quot; and Class 47 locomotives. The Sulzer LDA engine used a smaller gear for the central output shaft than the two gears attached to the crankshaft. This resulted in the output shaft rotating at approximately 1000 rpm while the crankshafts rotated at approximately 750 rpm. The purpose of this gearing was to allow the use of a smaller, and lighter, electrical generator when the engine was used in a diesel-electric locomotive.

The General Motors 6046 is a twin-engine setup that was used by Sherman tanks during World War II. The 6046 was built using two straight-six engines that were separately clutched to a single output shaft, which was itself clutched to the transmission unit. A total of 10,968 6046D-powered M4A2 Shermans were produced. After World War II, the Soviet Union produced several tanks powered by 16-cylinder and 18-cylinder engines that were reverse-engineered from the General Motors 6046 engine. These Soviet engines were designated Russkiy Dizel (Diesel Energo) DPN23/2H30 and the DRPN23/2H30.

==Variations==
===Tandem twin engine===
A tandem twin engine, occasionally used in motorcycles and go-karts, is a two-cylinder engine which uses a similar design to U engines.
The motor has two crankshafts, one for each cylinder which are joined and kept in co-ordination by load carrying, crank-phasing gears connecting the two cylinders.

The tandem twin layout is used only with two-stroke engines since these must have a discrete crankcase chamber per cylinder. The prime advantage of a tandem-twin two-stroke is that the engine can be very narrow while allowing chain final drive without a power-wasting 90° turn.

Between 1975 and 1982, Kawasaki used the design to win four 250 cc and four 350 cc world championships before they retired from Grand Prix racing. The engine design was also used for a road legal production motorcycle inspired by the racer. The Kawasaki KR models were instrumental in establishing the company as a manufacturer of high-performance motorcycles.

Rotax developed a similar tandem twin design, the model 256, which it sold to independent constructors. The CCM Armstrong 250 cc, Waddon, EMC, Hejira, Decorite, and Cotton racers used this engine. CCM Armstrong developed a 350 cc version of the engine. Aprilia&#x27;s 1985 GP racing bikes also used the Rotax model 256.
===Single crankshaft===
An unusual variation on the U engine is the use of a single crankshaft which is linked to the pistons in both cylinder banks by rocking beams. This system was used in an eight-cylinder petrol engine produced by the All-British Car Company between 1906 and 1908.

<text>The Old Gaol Building is a historic wood and iron building dating from the 1900s in Ingwavuma, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. The building is located near the welfare buildings. In 2004, the building was restored as part of a project run by Nansindlela School. H.C. Lugg, Chief Native Commissioner of Natal in the 1930s, described the Old Gaol as it was in 1920 in his book &quot;A Natal Family Looks Back&quot; as follows:

&quot;The gaol, like the court house, was also constructed of wood and iron. One day its walls were blown down, but soon re-erected by the convicts. Any attempt by a prisoner to escape, was followed by a hue and cry in which the convicts took part, never failing to get their man.&quot;

<text>Maritime identification digits are used by radio communication facilities to identify their home country or base area in digital selective calling (DSC), Automatic Transmitter Identification System (ATIS), and Automatic identification system (AIS) messages as part of their Maritime Mobile Service Identities. The International Telecommunication Union facilitates the assignment of MIDs to countries. Note that not all countries have MIDs; those without are typically landlocked, with no access to international waters. Sorting MID assignments in numerical order reveals a regional structure, with the first digit:

<doc id="877985" wikidata="Q1953449" url="?curid=877985" title="Mukataa">
<text>Mukataa () is an Arabic word for headquarters or administrative center, particularly in Palestine. Mukataas were mostly built during the British Mandate as Tegart forts and were used both as British government centers and as dwellings for the British administrative staff. Some Mukataas also included police stations and prisons. After the British left, the buildings often functioned similarly under the Jordanians, and then the Israelis.

After the Oslo Accords, the Mukataas were used as governmental offices and headquarters for the Palestinian National Authority. The Mukaatas in Ramallah and Gaza, the two major Palestinian cities, were also used as headquarters to the high Palestinian Authority leadership, including as office for Yasser Arafat, long-time Palestinian Authority president.

During Operation Defensive Shield in April 2002, the Israeli Defence Forces raided the Mukataas in the West Bank. Some Mukataas, including the Mukataa in Hebron, were entirely demolished.

== Arafat&#x27;s compound ==
The Mukataa in Ramallah, built in the 1930s during the British Mandate by the British engineer Sir Charles Tegart, was a military headquarters, a court of law and a prison. In May 1948, Jordan took over, and used the compound again as a prison and as a residence for Jordanian army officers and their families. From the occupation in 1967 it was the Israeli military headquarters, until the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1994. In 1996, Arafat moved in and the Mukataa became the official West Bank headquarters, known as Arafat&#x27;s compound.

=== Israeli siege of March 2002 ===

On 29 March 2002, the Israel Defense Forces raided the compound and placed it under siege during Operation Defensive Shield. The Israeli army destroyed the offices of three security services, along with a VIP guesthouse, a prison, sleeping quarters for guards, a large kitchen, a car repair shop and a large meeting hall.

The siege was lifted on 2 May after six men wanted by Israel – four of them convicted of involvement in the October 2001 assassination of the Israeli tourism minister Rehavam Ze&#x27;evi – were moved to a prison in Jericho to be guarded by U.S. and British wardens. The US-brokered plan was to enable Israel to avoid angering the United States over the Israeli Cabinet decision to bar a UN fact-finding mission from investigating allegations surrounding Israeli army actions in Jenin refugee camp during Operation Rampart. Although the military had withdrawn from the compound, the cities and refugee camps in the West Bank remained surrounded by Israeli troops.

=== Siege of 6 June 2002 ===

On 6 June 2002, the IDF executed a new siege after having attacked the headquarters with tanks, bulldozers and armored vehicles. Arafat&#x27;s office building was partly destroyed, besides other parts of the compound. The attack was a retaliation for a suicide bombing carried out by Islamic Jihad.

While Arafat was building a new Cabinet, the Israeli army five days later strengthened the siege on his headquarters with the support of US President George W. Bush. The White House rejected Egypt&#x27;s call for a quick timetable for Palestinian statehood and Bush hinted that an international conference was a long way off, &quot;because no one has confidence in the emerging Palestinian government.&quot;

=== Siege of September 2002 ===
After a suicide bombing struck Tel Aviv on 19 September 2002, the Mukataa was again placed under siege. During the next ten days, the IDF destroyed all of the buildings that had survived the former sieges with bulldozers and explosives, including the main interior ministry building. Only part of the building where Arafat and his people remained was left.

The siege re-ignited Palestinian support for Yasser Arafat. On 24 September 2002, the UN Security Council demanded an end of the siege, but Israel ignored the Resolution.

UN Under-Secretary-General Terje Rød-Larsen, one of the architects of the Oslo Accords, said on 27 September that &quot;the Israeli army&#x27;s siege of Yasser Arafat amid the ruins of his bulldozed presidential compound could mean &#x27;the death&#x27; of hopes for a Palestinian state and a peace agreement.&quot; He alluded to the possible death of the two-state solution and said that &quot;we&#x27;re moving in the direction of state destruction and not state-building&quot;.

On 11 September 2003, the Israeli security Cabinet decided to &quot;remove&quot; Arafat, who still remained in the besieged compound. In a statement it said: &quot;Recent days&#x27; events have proven again that Yasser Arafat is a complete obstacle to any process of reconciliation... Israel will act to remove this obstacle in the manner, at the time, and in the ways that will be decided on separately...&quot; The compound remained under siege until Arafat&#x27;s transfer in October 2004, for medical care in a French hospital.

=== Temporary burial-place of Arafat ===

In the early days of November, when it was clear his death was near, several locations were mentioned as possible burial sites. Jerusalem was the first choice, but Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he would not allow this.

Following Arafat&#x27;s death on 11 November 2004, the Palestinian leadership decided that he was to be &quot;temporarily&quot; interred in the Mukataa compound, pending the establishment of a Palestinian state and the transfer of his body to the Dome of the Rock compound on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Plans for Arafat to lie in state at the Mukataa prior to burial were canceled, because thousands of emotional mourners overwhelmed Palestinian security forces. Arafat was buried within the compound on 12 November, in a temporary manner. On 11 November 2007, a larger tomb clad in Jerusalem stone, and designed by Palestinian architects opened to the public. The message on the tomb indicated that the final resting place of Arafat shall be in Jerusalem, if it comes under Palestinian control.

<text>Abraham van Riebeeck (; 18 October 1653 – 17 November 1713) was a merchant with the Dutch East India Company and the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from 1709 to 1713.

== Biography ==
Abraham van Riebeeck was born on 18 October 1653 in the Dutch Cape Colony (present-day South Africa). His father was Jan van Riebeeck, commander of the Cape, and his mother was Maria van Riebeeck. When his father moved to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) in 1662, he sent Van Riebeeck and his brother to Holland. He studied law at Leiden University from 1673 to 1676.

After his studies, he became a merchant with the Dutch East India Company and travelled on the ship &quot;De Vrijheyt&quot; to Batavia, where he arrived 1677.

He married Elisabeth van Oosten in 1678. They had six children, Johanna Maria (1679–1759), Johannes (1691–1735), Elisabeth (1693–1723), and three others who died in their childhood.

He was Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from 1709 until his death in 1713. He was a keen explorer, who undertook several smaller and a few larger voyages in the Indies. In 1712, he managed to land in Palabuhanratu and grow coffee plants with success.

==Death==
After he became the first person to reach the summit of Tangkuban Perahu, Van Riebeeck contracted dysentery on his way home. He was unable to recover from the disease and died on 17 November 1713 in Batavia in the Dutch East Indies.

<doc id="877995" wikidata="Q7495101" url="?curid=877995" title="Sherm Lollar">
<text>John Sherman Lollar Jr. (August 23, 1924 – September 24, 1977) was an American professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from 1946 to 1963, most prominently as a member of the Chicago White Sox where he was a perennial All-Star player and was an integral member of the American League pennant-winning team.

Although he was often overshadowed by his contemporary, New York Yankee catcher Yogi Berra, Lollar was considered to be one of the best catchers in the major leagues during the 1950s. Lollar began his career playing for the Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees, and the St. Louis Browns where he earned his first All-Star berth however, he blossomed as a player while with the White Sox. He was an American League All-Star for seven seasons. In 1957, Lollar received the first Rawlings Gold Glove Award for the catcher position in Major League Baseball.

Lollar became a coach in the major leagues and managed at the minor league level after his MLB playing career ended. He was chosen for the Chicago White Sox All-Century Team on September 30, 2000.

==Biography==
Lollar was born in Durham, Arkansas in the rural Ozark mountains. He was a batboy for the Fayetteville, Arkansas Class D minor league team in the Arkansas–Missouri League in the 1930s. In 1943 Lollar was signed as an 18-year-old by the Baltimore Orioles, which then was a minor league franchise in the International League. In 1945 he hit 34 home runs and led the International League with a .364 batting average, winning the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award. Baltimore had a working agreement with the Cleveland Indians, and sold Lollar to the Indians after the 1945 season.

===MLB career===

====Cleveland Indians (1946)====
Lollar made his major league debut on April 20, 1946. He was a backup catcher for the Cleveland Indians behind catchers Frankie Hayes and then Jim Hegan. His playing time as a third string catcher was minimal so, he requested to be sent back to the minor leagues.

====New York Yankees (1947–1948)====
Lollar was traded to the New York Yankees along with Ray Mack after the 1946 season, and competed with Yogi Berra in 1947 for the Yankee catching job. Both Lollar and Berra were considered excellent hitting prospects but defensive liabilities, although both eventually would become outstanding receivers. Lollar started two games in the 1947 World Series for the Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers and went 3 for 4 with two doubles. Yankee coach and Hall of Fame catching great, Bill Dickey, advised the Yankees that Berra&#x27;s left-hand bat was more suited to the dimensions of Yankee Stadium (301&#x27;-457&#x27;-461&#x27;-407&#x27;-296&#x27; LF-LCF-CF-RCF-RF) than Lollar&#x27;s right-hand bat. During the 1948 season, Lollar suffered a hand injury due to a foul tip, resulting in limited action for the rest of the year.

====St. Louis Browns (1949–1951)====
Lollar was traded to the St. Louis Browns and replaced Les Moss as their starting catcher for the 1949 season. In 1950, Lollar was hitting .314 in mid-July and earned his first of seven All-Star selections (nine total games). He ended the season hitting .280 with a career-high .391 on-base percentage. In 1951, Lollar hit .252 for the season and was traded to the White Sox that November.

====Chicago White Sox (1952–1963)====

In 1952, Lollar took over the season&#x27;s regular catching job for the White Sox from catcher Phil Masi. His defensive skills improved under the tutelage of manager and former major league catcher Paul Richards. Lollar, whom Richards called &quot;a manager on the field&quot;, was a quiet workhorse who led by example and was an excellent handler of pitchers. In 1954, after allowing a stolen base to Al Smith on May 25, he threw out all 18 would-be base stealers during the remainder of the year. He became a mainstay behind the plate for the Go-Go White Sox teams of the 1950s and early 1960s, which included future Hall of Fame members Luis Aparicio, Nellie Fox, George Kell, Hoyt Wilhelm, and Early Wynn.

Described as a dangerous hitter with power in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Baseball History&quot;, Lollar played most of his career in cavernous Comiskey Park, whose dimensions were 352&#x27;-415&#x27;-352&#x27; LF-CF-RF. He tied a major League record on April 23, 1955 when he got hits twice in two different innings of the same game. Lollar never struck out more than 50 times in a season and walked more than he struck out in each of the 15 seasons he played after becoming an every day player. His career on-base percentage was higher than Berra&#x27;s (.357 &quot;versus&quot; .348). He hit a career-high .293 with 28 doubles in 1956.

The White Sox finished in third place for five consecutive seasons until 1957, when the Sox held first place until late June, before finishing the season in second place behind the Yankees. Lollar won the first Gold Glove Award for catcher in , which initially had one recipient per position for both leagues. That year he caught Bob Keegan&#x27;s no-hitter on August 20. In 1958, the White Sox would battle back from being in last place on June 14 to once again finish the season in second place behind the Yankees. Lollar led the team with 20 home runs and 84 runs batted in.

In 1959, the White Sox won their first American League pennant since the Black Sox scandal in , finishing the regular season five games ahead of the Cleveland Indians. Lollar helped guide the White Sox pitching staff to the lowest earned run average in the American League. He also led the team once again with a career-high 22 home runs and 84 runs batted in and winning his third consecutive Gold Glove Award. He had 5 hits and 5 runs batted in, including a home run, in the 1959 World Series, as the White Sox were defeated by the Los Angeles Dodgers in a six-game series.

Lollar remained the White Sox starting catcher through the 1962 season. In 1962, he fractured his thumb on June 20 when he was hit by a pitch by Ted Sadowski of the Minnesota Twins. He did not return until July 25, and appeared in only 84 total games during the season. Lollar retired from playing at the end of the 1963 season at the age of 38.

Ned Garver enjoyed working with Lollar, recalling that he would often pitch entire games throwing the first pitch Lollar flashed a sign for.

==Hall of Fame eligibility==
In &quot;The Case for Those Overlooked by the Baseball Hall of Fame&quot;, published in 1992, Lollar was named as one of 32 former major league players considered worthy of Hall of Fame consideration. Seven of the book&#x27;s players have since been enshrined in the Hall of Fame: Richie Ashburn, Orlando Cepeda, Larry Doby, Nellie Fox, Bill Mazeroski, Hal Newhouser, and Ron Santo. Lollar is one of 36 catchers who are portrayed in Thomas Owens’ &quot;Great Catchers&quot;.

Lollar is currently eligible to be identified as a Golden Era ballot candidate in November 2017 by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America&#x27;s-appointed Historical Overview Committee (screening committee of 10-12 BBWAA members). If he is selected for the Golden Era ballot list of 10 candidates, he is eligible for consideration for election to the Hall of Fame in December 2017 by the 16-member Golden Era Committee, under the Hall of Fame&#x27;s, Golden Era rules for election for players.

==MLB stats and highlights==

In an eighteen-year major league career, Lollar played in 1,752 games, accumulating 1,415 hits in 5,351 at bats for a .264 career batting average along with 155 home runs, 808 runs batted in and a .357 on-base percentage. A seven-time All-Star, Lollar led American League catchers in fielding percentage four times over his career. In 1961, he committed only one error over the entire season. At the time of his retirement in 1963, Lollar&#x27;s .992 career fielding percentage was the highest for a catcher in major league history. During his career, Lollar threw out 46.18% of the base runners who tried steal a base on him, ranking him 5th on the all-time list. He caught 110 shutouts during his career, ranking him 21st all-time among major league catchers. At the time of his retirement in 1963, he ranked 9th all-time in career home runs by catchers.

He remained in that capacity through the 1966 World Series championship season until the announcement on September 28, 1967, that he would not be retained for the 1968 season. He subsequently was a coach for the Oakland Athletics in 1968, and managed the Athletics&#x27; minor league affiliates the Iowa Oaks and the Tucson Toros in the 1970s. Lollar eventually owned a bowling alley in Springfield, Missouri, where he died of cancer at age 53 on September 24, 1977.

<doc id="878014" wikidata="Q113703593" url="?curid=878014" title="Jesus in Ahmadiyya">
<text>Ahmadiyya Muslims consider Jesus (&quot;ʿĪsā&quot;) as a mortal man, entirely human, and a prophet of God born to the Virgin Mary (&quot;Maryam&quot;). Jesus is understood to have survived the crucifixion based on the account of the canonical Gospels, the Qurʾān, hadith literature, and revelations (&quot;waḥy&quot; and &quot;kašf&quot;) to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Having delivered his message to the Israelites in Judea, Jesus is understood to have emigrated eastward to escape persecution from Judea and to have further spread his message to the Lost Tribes of Israel. Ahmadi Muslims accept that Jesus died a natural death in India. Jesus lived to old age and later died in Srinagar, Kashmir, and his tomb is presently located at the Roza Bal shrine.

Although sharing many similarities with the other Islamic views of Jesus, the Ahmadiyya teachings are distinct from the beliefs held by most mainstream Muslims, who deny the crucifixion of Jesus and believe that he ascended bodily to heaven, and will, according to Islamic literary sources, return before the end of time.

Ahmadis believe the prophecies surrounding the second advent of the messiah Jesus were fulfilled in the &quot;likeness&quot; and personality of Mīrzā G̲h̲ulām Aḥmad, who initiated the foundation of the Ahmadiyya movement.

==Overview==
According to Ahmadiyya beliefs, a literal interpretation of the miracles performed by ʿĪsā (Jesus) in the Qurʾān (such as creating birds and bringing back the dead to life) is inconsistent with the Quran and attributes a semi-divine status to Jesus. This understanding is replaced with a hermeneutic interpretation of the Qurʾānic verses on account of these miracles. For example, Jesus bringing the dead back to life is understood in the context of bringing back a &#x27;spiritual life&#x27; to people who were spiritually dead.

Ahmadi scholars regard the contemporary Islamic interpretations relating to the Second Coming of Jesus (see Ahmadi prophetology) are inaccurate. Ahmadis believe that the expected return of an Israelite prophet after the Islamic prophet Muhammad contravenes the finality of Muhammad&#x27;s prophethood. Traditional Muslims, however, hold the view that in his second coming - Jesus son of Mary will come as &quot;just ruler&quot; rather than in a prophetic capacity.

The &quot;ḥadīth&quot; prophecies of Jesus are understood in the Ahmadiyya view to be interchangeably linked with the prophecies of the coming of the Mahdi. Ahmadiyya believes that both the terms, &quot;Jesus Son of Mary&quot; and &quot;Mahdi&quot; (as used in Islamic hadith and eschatological literature), designate two titles for the same person.

==History==
Ahmad, in his treatise Jesus in India (Urdu: &quot;Masih Hindustan Mein&quot;), proposed that Jesus survived crucifixion and travelled to India &quot;after&quot; his apparent death in Jerusalem.

The views of Jesus having travelled to India had been put forth prior to Mirza Ghulam Ahmed&#x27;s publication, most notably by Nicolas Notovitch in 1894. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad expressly rejected the theory of a pre-crucifixion visit that Notovitch had proposed, arguing instead that Jesus&#x27;s travels to India took place after surviving crucifixion.

The first response in English to Ahmad&#x27;s writings came in a book by Howard Walter, an Urdu-speaking American pastor in Lahore, &quot;The Ahmadiyya Movement&quot; (1918). Walter, like later scholars, identified the Islamic version of the Barlaam and Josaphat story as the primary of Ahmad&#x27;s evidence despite the fact that the four chapters of his book are arranged around evidence from the Gospels, the Quran and hadith, medical literature and historical records–respectively.

In his writings Mirza Ghulam Ahmad elaborated that the Roza Bal tomb in Srinagar, that is said by locals in the Srinagar region to contain the grave of a holy Jewish saint known as Yuz Asaf, is the tomb of Jesus of Nazareth.

The teaching was further researched by Ahmadi missionaries. Kamal ud-Din and Khwaja Nazir Ahmad (1952), who added to Notovitch&#x27;s theory of his first earlier visit.

Although the material of Notovitch and Ahmad has been refuted by notable historians, such as the Indologist Günter Grönbold (1985) and Norbert Klatt (1988), it has been supported by others such as the archaeologist Fida Hassnain and the writer Holger Kersten.

=== Other publications ===
Ahmadi Muslims have published extensively on the topic of Jesus&#x27; natural death expanding upon Mirza Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s work in light of newer archeological discoveries and historical research. In 1978, Mirza Nasir, the third Khalifa of the Ahmadiyya movement, travelled to London where the international conference of Jesus&#x27; &quot;Deliverance from the cross&quot; was held at the Commonwealth Institute in Kensington. This was attended by a number of scholars and academics who had presented papers discussing the circumstances surrounding the crucifixion of Jesus, in which the Ahmadiyya viewpoint regarding the death of Jesus was presented. Nasir Ahmad&#x27;s lecture discussed the subject of Jesus&#x27; survival from death upon the cross, his travel to the east, the Unity of God and the status of Muhammad.

In 2003, the viewpoint of Roza Bal being Jesus&#x27; tomb was covered in a BBC documentary by Richard Denton, &quot;Did Jesus Die?&quot;. Jesus&#x27; possible travels to India are also discussed in a 2008 documentary &quot;Jesus in India&quot; by Paul Davids.

==Death of Jesus==

The Ahmadiyya movement advocates the notion of the survival of the crucifixion by Jesus through a mixture of biblical and quranic analyses.

=== Biblical sources ===
# Jesus had prophesied that his fate would be like that of Jonah (the story of Jonah is one of survival).
# Jesus was placed on the cross for only a few hours. Death by crucifixion usually takes several days. While he was on the cross his legs were left intact, and not broken as was the normal procedure. This would have prevented death by respiratory distress. As blood and water were reported to have &#x27;gushed&#x27; from the spear wound, this was sign of a beating heart.
# Jesus prayed to be rescued from death on the cross. 
# Pilate, having sympathy for Jesus, secretly devised to save him by setting his Crucifixion shortly before Sabbath day.
# The Gospel of John records that Nicodemus brought myrrh and aloes. These healing plants, particularly aloe plants, are considered medicinal and applied to wounds. It would make little sense applying them to a dead body. 
# According to the Bible &quot;He that is hanged is accursed of God.&quot;; something Paul imputed to Jesus. However, since the word &quot;curse&quot; would signify a satanic connection, divine antipathy and displeasure, spiritual impurity, faithlessness and disobedience to God; Jesus&#x27; being from God and the beloved of God, does not allow for him to have become accursed at any moment and therefore for him to have died on a cross.
# After he had awoken from his swoon (&quot;resurrection&quot;), Jesus bared his wounds to Thomas, showing he did not have a supernatural, resurrected body, but a wounded human body. He was also seen in the flesh by a large number of his followers, baring the same wounds that he had suffered from his ordeal on the Cross. 
# After his wounds had sufficiently healed Jesus left the tomb and met some of his disciples and had his food with them and walked from Jerusalem to Galilee. 
# In his post-crucifixion appearances, Jesus left the tomb in the darkness of night; he appears to have been moving away from the source of danger; he showed himself only to his disciples, people whom he trusted and not the general public; and met them under the cover of darkness at night. This behaviour is uncharacteristic of one who had just miraculously succeeded in defying death at the hands of his enemies, having been given a new eternal life with an immortal physical body, and is more consistent with one who had just survived it and was avoiding their (that is both the government agencies and the public) notice lest he be recaptured. 
# Jesus stated that he was sent only for the &quot;lost sheep of the house of Israel&quot; and prophesied that he would go to seek out the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel (residing beyond the Palestine region). The Jews of Jesus&#x27;s time believed that the Lost Tribes of Israel had become dispersed in different lands. 
# When Joseph requested Jesus&#x27; body from the cross, Pilate asked a centurion if Jesus was already dead. The centurion confirmed that Jesus was already dead. This centurion was a believer that Jesus was the son of God.
# There are no accounts in the gospel of Jesus ascending into the heavens, aside from accounts that were absent from the earliest written gospels.

=== Quranic sources ===

Ahmadiyyas state that there are at least 30 verses of the Quran that suggest that Jesus did not ascend to Heaven but instead died a natural death on Earth. The verses in Chapter Al-Nisa (4:157-158) indicate that Jesus did not die on the Cross - but rather that God had &quot;raised&quot; Jesus unto God Himself (not into heaven).

As the Quran speaks of God being Omnipresent in the Earth and in the hearts of mankind, God&#x27;s existence is not to be misconstrued as being confined to the Heavens alone, making any bodily movement &quot;towards&quot; God impossible. Ahmadis interpret the Arabic word raised in these verses to mean &quot;exalted&quot;. In other words, Jesus&#x27; spiritual rank and status was raised to come closer to God as opposed to him dying the accursed death which his adversaries had wished for.

To further support the view of Jesus having died a mortal death, Ahmadis use the following verse in the Quran 5:76:
In the preceding verse, Jesus is compared to the previous Messengers – all of whom had died a natural death and none of whom had ascended bodily to Heaven.

From the following verse in Al-Imran and Al-Anbiya, the Quran clarifies that all messengers before Muhammad, including Jesus, had died:
===Hadith accounts===
To illustrate the death of Jesus, Ahmadiyya scholars use references to various Islamic hadith. For example, 


As Muhammad had lived and died after some 60 years, Jesus must also have died. In other words, as Muhammad had died, this states that there likewise was a death of Jesus.

During the Mi&#x27;raj, Muhammad had also seen Jesus in the second heaven along with John the Baptist. Thus, because Islam believes the dead cannot dwell amongst the living, it can only indicate that Jesus must also be dead.

==Second Coming of Jesus==

The Ahmadiyya movement interprets the prophecised Second Coming of Jesus as being of a person &quot;similar to Jesus&quot; (&quot;mathīl-i ʿIsā&quot;), rather than that of Jesus of Nazareth himself. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad professed that the prophecy in traditional religious texts were greatly misunderstood to interpret that Jesus of Nazareth himself would return.

Ahmadis consider that the founder of the movement, in both his teachings and character as well as his situation and struggles, was likewise a circumstantial representation of the situation and struggles of Jesus.

==Universal prophethood==
Adherents of the Ahmadiyya movement assert that the expected arrival of a latter day Messiah is represented across all major faiths. The prophecy of the messiah historically diverged into several theories and distinct interpretations which filtered across through the world&#x27;s religious movements. The original Messianic prophecy nonetheless, only referred to a single Messiah. As such, Ahmadis declare that the Messiah for all major world faiths and mankind has been unified by the advent of a single Promised Messiah (Mirza Ghulam Ahmad).

Ahmadi&#x27;s believe that God will cause all world faiths to gradually fade away and gravitate towards the Ahmadiyya faith; that such a process will follow a correlative pattern of circumstances and take a similar amount of time as what it took for Christianity to rise to dominance (e.g. roughly 300 years – Seven Sleepers).

== Contention with mainstream Islamic beliefs ==
The &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot; states that the post-crucifixion journey of Jesus towards the East and his natural death as an aspect of Ahmadi belief is one of three primary tenets that distinguish Ahmadi teachings from general Islamic ones, and that it has provoked a &quot;fatwa&quot; against the movement.

=== Last of the Prophets / Seal of the Prophets ===

Contemporary Muslim scholars argue that no prophet can come after Muhammed based upon abstractions from the hadith and this is the principal reason for rejecting and advocating persecution against the movement.

Ahmadi scholars use hadith and the quranic sources that indicate these strictly rigid ideologies are a fallacy of misplaced concreteness. The following hadith for instance illustrates the context of when Muhammad had declared himself to be the &quot;last of the prophets&quot;, with the same breath he had also declared his mosque as the &quot;last&quot; of the mosques.

This hadith implicates the rhetoric of Muhammad being the &quot;last&quot; in the absolute sense. If for instance Muhammad declared his mosque as being &quot;last&quot; of the mosques by the same interpretation this would have invalidated all subsequent mosques that have ever been built after his advent.

The Ahmadiyya understanding of the term &quot;Khatam an-Nabiyyin&quot; (Seal of Prophets) with reference to Muhammad, establishes that a prophet cannot come after Muhammad from outside the Islamic dispensation. In other words, one whose prophethood which is independent of Muhammad cannot develop a new faith.

Contemporary Muslims interpret from the hadith the notion of Jesus&#x27;s actual physical return in person after the advent of Muhammad. According to the Quran, Jesus&#x27; revelation was addressed for the Israelites. Since Jesus had received his revelation independently of Muhammad, this would conversely violate the Seal of Prophethood of Muhammed altogether.

Thus Ahmadis regard that, as Ghulam Ahmad was only a follower and reviver of the original Islamic faith, his claim of being a subordinate prophet (in the likeness of Jesus being a subordinate prophet) does not in any way violate the Seal of Prophets (Muhammad).

=== Finality of prophethood ===
The claim that Mirza Ghulam was a prophet forms a point of contention with mainstream Islam, as it is considered a violation of the quranic and hadith teachings of Muhammad. In particular, contemporary Islamic scholars view the Ahmadiyya belief as a contradiction with the verse in the Quran, Chapter 33 (The Combined Forces), verse 40:
=== Farewell sermon ===
In his Farewell Sermon, delivered just prior to his death, Muhammad warned his followers and all mankind with the following message:
The Ahmadiyya movement interpret the hadith context of &quot;Last of the Prophets&quot; to signify the &quot;Very Best&quot; and &quot;Most Exalted Law Giver Prophet&quot; among all the Prophets. The farewell sermon had indicated only that no prophet would come immediately after Muhammad had died.

The movement consider the literal interpretation of the term &quot;finality&quot; that is zealously constrained by the mainstream Islamic view, completely paradoxes their own views of the hadith concerning the second advent of Jesus. In the manner that the Islamic mainstream views that Jesus himself is expected to physically return in the latter days from Heaven, it becomes implausible to also presume that it is absolutely impossible for any prophet to come after Muhammad.

==Consensus of companions of Muhammad on Jesus&#x27; death==
Ahmadi scholars state that when Muhammad died, the Sahaba were grieved. Umar, angered and upset, took out a sword, and said that he would kill anyone who said Muhammad is dead. At this instance Abu Bakar quoted:
The Ahmadiyya movement believe that no companion ever stated Jesus is alive in heaven. Nor that he would come physically in the Second Coming. As such according to the quranic verses, Jesus could only have died a natural death (and not have died on the Cross).

==Fulfilment of messianic prophecies==
Mirza Ghulam Ahmad regarded the prophecies and concepts in hadith and Bible concerning his advent in an entirely metaphorical light. As an example, in his publication, Izala-e-Auham Mirza Ghulam Ahmad stated:
=== Battle against Dajjal (Anti-Christ) ===
Mirza Ghulam Ahmad elaborated on the depictions of Antichrist as prophecised in the Bible and the hadith concerning the emergence of the Dajjal. These are interpreted in Ahmadiyya teachings, in metaphorical terms - to denote a group of nations centred upon falsehood. The reference to the Dajjal is personified as a unified system - a chain of deceptive ideas indicating it&#x27;s chains of unity as a class (instead of any single person).

The defeat of the Dajjal, was by force of reason and argument and by the warding off of its mischief through the ideologies and teachings of the Messiah, rather than by way of any physical warfare; with the Dajjal&#x27;s power and influence gradually disintegrating and ultimately allowing for the recognition and worship of God along Islamic ideals to prevail throughout the world.

===Breaking of the cross===
The Islamic hadith describe that Jesus would, upon his second coming, &quot;Break the Cross&quot;. Ahmadis interpret this to mean that he will &quot;make plain the error of the creed of the cross&quot;. Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s teachings of Jesus, being a mortal man who survived crucifixion and died a natural death upon earth, is considered as a testimony of the prophecy being fulfilled.

Ahmadis believe the followers of Christianity will gradually come to accept the same teaching and this will repeal the central doctrines of the divinity of Jesus, Atonement and Resurrection. In turn, the traditional Christian reverence for the cross and doctrine of the immortality of Jesus will become untenable.

===Ending of wars===

In 1894, Ghulam Ahmad had declared that the contemporary Islamists views of Jihad of the sword and Holy War was a fundamental misrepresentation of Islam, that was invented during the Dark Ages. He advocated for these false beliefs to be ended in their entirety.

The Ahmadiyya Movement believe that any military jihad in Islam is permitted only and exclusively for the defence of &quot;religious&quot; freedom and in very strictly defined circumstances (not exclusive only to Islam). Those circumstances did not exist at the present time of British rule in India. As a result, early Ahmadis had faced virulent opposition from extremist groups, some of whom protested a conspiracy that Ghulam Ahmad had been put in place as a pacifist by the British Government to appease Muslims. Ahmadis believe that in the modern era, the &quot;Jihad of the pen&quot; (peaceful intellectual reasoning) is the only potent way of espousing and spreading the Islamic teaching.

Accordingly, as per scriptural prophecies in the hadith relating to the Messiah ending of wars, the movement regard this declaration has deprecated &quot;Jihad of the sword&quot; and consider the prophecies in the hadith relating to ending of religious wars had been fulfilled by Ghulam Ahmad teachings.

==Journey from Judea to India==

According to Ghulam Ahmad, (and further developed by the next generation of Ahmadi writers such as Khwaja Nazir Ahmad in 1952), Jesus taught the message of Jewish messianism to his disciples and to the people living in Judea. 
After surviving his ordeal on the cross, Jesus remained in Judea for a short time before leaving from there. Jesus was declared a criminal and therefore, decided to leave Judea with his mother Mary, his wife Mary Magdalene and his apostle Thomas the Apostle. Thereafter, Jesus traveled toward Asia.

===From Judea to Iraq===

With these three companions, he went first to Iraq. Here he met his disciple, Ananias. He met his rival Paul who later became a Christian. In Nusaybin, he got another tension at the hands of a cruel king. He was arrested again. Prophet Jesus along with his mother performed some miracles and impressed the king. The king gave him permission to go to the kingdom of Parthia. There was a strong Jewish community living there.

===Iraq to Iran and Afghanistan===

From Iraq, he went to Iran where he was honourably received by the Persian Jews. Five centuries before Cyrus the Great had conquered Babylon and the Jews were freed. Many of the Jews went to live in Iran and were known as Persian Jews. Jesus preached here and went on to Bactria (Afghanistan). At that time, Persia was a great center of Judaism. He professed the advent of the coming of a great prophet named Muhammad to his fellowmen in these areas specially in the area of Afghanistan. He met with the first king of Parthia who honored him. The Pashtun people have a tradition in their royal and non-royal functions and consider themselves to be the sons of Children of Israel. Many of these Persian Jews who had been receiving the teachings from Jesus proselytized to Muslims at the time of Muhammad and accepted his call. Qais Abdur Rashid, his name is this and the original was Kish.

===Kashmir, Tibet and India===
====Reasons for coming to India====

According to Ahmadiyya sources (Islam International Publications Ltd.) the Tribes of Israel who had migrated to eastern countries seeing the attraction in Hinduism and Buddhism had themselves become Hindus and Buddhists. They subsequently became unaware of their religion. Jesus and Thomas the Apostle later arrived in India to restore the Abrahamic teachings to these tribes.

==== Jesus meets Shalivahana ====
According to a late section of the Hindu &quot;Bhavishya Purana&quot; (written after 1739), Jesus met a Hindu king, Shalivahana.

The king along with his companions went to the peak of the Himalayas to meet a man who was a dignified person of fair complexion in white clothes sitting in the mountain. When the king asked who he was, the man replied &quot;I am the Messiah, born of a virgin.&quot;

He told the king he had come from a far off place where he has suffered at the hands of his people. When the king asked what religion he adhered to, he said that his religion was of peace, love and purity of heart. The king was impressed, so he paid homage to him.

==Tomb of Jesus==
During his initial research into Jesus&#x27; death, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad postulated that Jesus may have been buried in either Galilee or Syria. After investigating further he eventuality uncovered evidence to conclude that the tomb of Jesus was located at the Roza Bal shrine in Srinagar, Kashmir. Based upon this evidence, Ahmadis today believe the tomb of Jesus is located in the Srinagar region of Kashmir.

Ghulam Ahmad, and later Ahmadi writers have cited various evidences for identifying the grave as that of Jesus: The Bhavishya Purana Official Decree, The Glass Mirror, Tarikh-i-Kashmir, Qisa-shazada, The Garden of Solomon (Bagh-i-Sulaiman) by Mir Saadullah Shahabadi (1780 A.D.), Wajeez-ut-Tawarikh, Ikmal-ud-Din (962 AD), Ain-ul-Hayat, The Acts of Thomas, Takhat Sulaiman (Throne of Solomon, a hill in Kashmir), Tarikh-i-Kabir, and Rauzat-us-Safa. Ahmadis believe that these sources testify to the view that Yuz Asaf and Jesus are the same person.

Haji Mohi-ud-din Miskin, writing in 1902, three years after Mirza Ghulam Ahmad in 1899, is the first historian to mention that &quot;some&quot; connect the shrine of Yuz Asaf as the grave of Hazrat Isa Rooh-Allah (Jesus the Spirit of God).

The importance of the shrine has been preserved in the memory of the descendants of the ancient Israelites to this day. They call the shrine &quot;The tomb of Hazrat Issa Sahib&quot;, &quot;The Tomb of Prophet Jesus &quot;(Isa)&quot;&quot;.

The building constructed is named &quot;Roza Bal&quot; or &quot;Rauza Bal&quot;. &quot;Rauza&quot; is generally a term used to denote the tomb of a celebrated personality, i.e. noble, wealthy, or saintly. A local scholar and supporter of the theory, Fida Hassnain, has claimed that the tomb is arranged with the feet pointing in the direction of Jerusalem, and claimed that this is in accordance with Jewish tradition.

Ahmadis give the Yuz Asaf enshrined in the tomb the epithet &quot;Shahzada Nabi&quot;, &quot;Prophet Prince&quot;. The majority Srinagar Sunni Muslim community reject the Ahmadiyya claims that the tomb is that of Jesus and consider this viewpoint as blasphemous.

===Tomb of Mary===
Muslim and Persian documents — the Tafir-Ibn-I-Jarir, the Kanz-al-Ummal, and the Rauzat-us-Safa — have references that contribute to the theory of Jesus&#x27; escape. Some of these also mention that Jesus was accompanied by Mary, and there is another burial place in Pakistan, along his theoretical route to Kashmir, known as Mai Mari da Ashtan, or &quot;resting place of Mother Mary.&quot;

<text>The Progressive Reform Party () was a South African party that was formed on 26 July 1975 by the fusion of the Reform Party led by Harry Schwarz and the Progressive Party led by Colin Eglin. Harry Schwarz predicted that the merger would lead to a &quot;new political dimension in South Africa.&quot;

Colin Eglin was elected leader of the party while Harry Schwarz was made Chairman of the Federal Executive.

In 1977, the United Party merged with another small party to form the New Republic Party. A number of United Party members left to form the Committee for a United Opposition, which then joined the Progressive Reform Party to form the Progressive Federal Party with Colin Eglin as its leader.

<doc id="878020" wikidata="Q816318" url="?curid=878020" title="Disorderly conduct">
<text>Disorderly conduct is a crime in most jurisdictions, such as the United States and China. Typically, &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; is a term used to refer to any behavior that is considered unacceptable in a formal, civilized or controlled environment. Many types of unruly conduct may fit the definition of disorderly conduct, as such statutes are often used as &quot;catch-all&quot; crimes. Police may use a disorderly conduct charge to keep the peace when people are behaving in a disruptive manner, but otherwise present no danger.

Disorderly conduct is typically classified as an infraction or misdemeanor in the United States. However, in certain circumstances (e.g., when committed in an airport, a park, a government office building, or near a funeral) it may be a felony in some US states.

==United States==
===Definitions===
A basic definition of disorderly conduct defines the offense as:

:A person who recklessly, knowingly, or intentionally:
::(1) engages in fighting or in tumultuous conduct;
::(2) makes unreasonable noise and continues to do so after being asked to stop; or
::(3) disrupts a lawful assembly of persons;
:commits disorderly conduct. . .

Indiana&#x27;s definition of &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; is modeled after the Model Penal Code&#x27;s definition, and is typical, but not identical, to similar laws on the statute books of other U.S. states. It covers a large variety of potential acts in its prohibition. &quot;Fighting&quot; is perhaps the clearest act within the scope of its prohibition, and &quot;tumultuous conduct&quot; is &quot;conduct [...] likely to result in serious bodily injury to a person or substantial damage to property.&quot; But exactly what constitutes &quot;tumultuous conduct&quot;, &quot;unreasonable noise&quot;, or &quot;disrupt[ing] a lawful assembly&quot; are matters that are far harder to decide, and as such disorderly conduct statutes give police officers and other authorities fairly broad discretion to arrest people whose activities they find undesirable for a wide variety of reasons. Potential punishments include a jail term, fine, probation, restraining orders, or community service.

In some jurisdictions, wearing a mask in public may constitute disorderly conduct.

====Federal====
The federal regulations about disorderly conduct:

*(a) A person commits disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause public alarm, nuisance, jeopardy or violence, or knowingly or recklessly creating a risk thereof, such person commits any of the following prohibited acts: 
**(1) Engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent behavior. 
**(2) Uses language, an utterance, or gesture, or engages in a display or act that is obscene, physically threatening or menacing, or done in a manner that is likely to inflict injury or incite an immediate breach of the peace. 
**(3) Makes noise that is unreasonable, considering the nature and purpose of the actor&#x27;s conduct, location, time of day or night, and other factors that would govern the conduct of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances. 
**(4) Creates or maintains a hazardous or physically offensive condition. 
*(b) The regulations contained in this section apply, regardless of land ownership, on all lands and waters within a park area that are under the legislative jurisdiction of the United States.

===Interpretation===
U.S. courts confronted with cases stemming from disorderly conduct arrests have from time to time had occasion to restrict the broad and vague definitions of the statute to make certain that freedom of speech and assembly and other forms of protected expression under the First Amendment were not affected. Common law jurisdictions have accumulated precedents that refine interpretation of vague statutes. Courts have had occasion to curb its scope to make certain that people were (or could have been) aware that their conduct was, in fact, within the prohibition of the statute, as required by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, no court has struck down a disorderly conduct statute as being &quot;per se&quot; unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Courts have been willing to strike down vagrancy ordinances which are nearly as vague and do not give adequate warning.

California Penal Code § 415 which is similar to the Model Penal Code reiteration above actually concerns disturbing the peace. However, in California disorderly conduct (California Penal Code § 647) lists what acts constitute disorderly conduct.

:Section 647: Every person who commits any of the following acts is guilty of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor
::(a) Who solicits anyone to engage in or who engages in lewd or dissolute conduct in any public place or in any place open to the public or exposed to public view.

::(b) Who solicits or who agrees to engage in or who engages in any act of prostitution. A person agrees to engage in an act of prostitution when, with specific intent to so engage, they manifest an acceptance of an offer or solicitation to so engage, regardless of whether the offer or solicitation was made by a person who also possessed the specific intent to engage in prostitution. No agreement to engage in an act of prostitution shall constitute a violation of this subdivision unless some act, in addition to the agreement, is done within this state in furtherance of the commission of an act of prostitution by the person agreeing to engage in that act. As used in this subdivision, &quot;prostitution&quot; includes any lewd act between persons for money or other consideration.

::(c) Who accosts other persons in any public place or in any place open to the public for the purpose of begging or soliciting alms.

::(d) Who loiters in or about any toilet open to the public for the purpose of engaging in or soliciting any lewd or lascivious or any unlawful act.

::(e) Who lodges in any building, structure, vehicle, or place, whether public or private, without the permission of the owner or person entitled to the possession or in control of it.

::(f) Who is found in any public place under the influence of intoxicating liquor, any drug, controlled substance, toluene, or any combination of any intoxicating liquor, drug, controlled substance, or toluene, in a condition that they are unable to exercise care for their own safety or the safety of others, or by reason of their being under the influence of intoxicating liquor, any drug, controlled substance, toluene, or any combination of any intoxicating liquor, drug, or toluene, interferes with or obstructs or prevents the free use of any street, sidewalk, or other public way.

::(h) Who loiters, prowls, or wanders upon the private property of another, at any time, without visible or lawful business with the owner or occupant. As used in this subdivision, &quot;loiter&quot; means to delay or linger without a lawful purpose for being on the property and for the purpose of committing a crime as opportunity may be discovered.

::(i) Who, while loitering, prowling, or wandering upon the private property of another, at any time, peeks in the door or window of any inhabited building or structure, without visible or lawful business with the owner or occupant.

::(j) (1) Any person who looks through a hole or opening, into, or otherwise views, by means of any instrumentality, including, but not limited to, a periscope, telescope, binoculars, camera, motion picture camera, or camcorder, the interior of a bedroom, bathroom, changing room, fitting room, dressing room, or tanning booth, or the interior of any other area in which the occupant has a reasonable expectation of privacy, with the intent to invade the privacy of a person or persons inside. This subdivision shall not apply to those areas of a private business used to count currency or other negotiable instruments.

==China==
===Criminal law===
Articles 277 to 304 of the Criminal Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, revised and promulgated on 14 March 1997 and effective as of 1 October 1997, criminalize many kinds of disorderly conducts in the jurisdiction of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

===Administrative law===

==Taiwan==
===Criminal law===

Effective on 1 July 1935, Articles 149 to 160 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of China criminalize many kinds of disorderly conducts in the jurisdiction of the Republic of China, which has shifted to Taiwan since 1949.
====Administrative law====
Promulgated on 29 June 1991, Articles 63 to 79 of the Social Order Maintenance Act administratively penalize non-criminal disorderly conducts in Taiwan.

<text>Ado (died 16 December 874) was a Frankish churchman and writer. He served as the archbishop of Vienne from 850 until his death and is venerated as a saint. His writings include hagiography and historiography.

==Life==
Ado belonged to a prominent noble family. He was sent while still a child for his education, first to Sigulf, abbot of Ferrières, and then to Marcward, abbot of Prüm. After the death of Marcward in 853, Ado went to Rome where he stayed for nearly five years, and then to Ravenna, after which Remy, archbishop of Lyon, gave him the parish of Saint-Romain near Vienne. The following year he was elected archbishop of Vienne and dedicated in August or September 860, despite opposition from Girard, Count of Paris, and his wife Bertha.

Ado participated in the Council of Tousy, near Toul in Lorraine, on 22 October 860, and held a in 870. After his death on 16 December 876, his body was buried in the Church of the Apostles in Vienne, now called St. Peter&#x27;s Church, the usual place of burial of the archbishops of Vienne. His feast day is celebrated on 16 December.

The Royal Library of Copenhagen preserves an unedited martyrology which dates back to the 11th century and comes from the Abbey of Santa Maria, Serrateix, with information on Ado of Vienne, the Rule of Saint Benedict and other abbots and monks of that time.

==Works==
Several of his letters are extant and reveal their writer as an energetic man of wide sympathies and considerable influence. Ado&#x27;s principal works are a martyrology, and a chronicle, &quot;Chronicon sive Breviarium chronicorum de sex mundi aetatibus de Adamo usque ad annum 869&quot;.

Ado&#x27;s chronicle is based on that of Bede, with which he combines extracts from the ordinary sources, forming the whole into a consecutive narrative founded on the conception of the unity of the Roman Empire, which he traces in the succession of the emperors, Charlemagne and his heirs following immediately after Constantine VI and Irene. &quot;It is,&quot; says Wilhelm Wattenbach, &quot;history from the point of view of authority and preconceived opinion, which exclude any independent judgment of events.&quot;

Ado wrote also a book on the miracles of Saint Bernard, archbishop of Vienne (9th century), published in the Bollandist &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;; a life or &quot;martyrium&quot; of Saint Desiderius, bishop of Vienne (d. 608); and a life of Saint Theuderius of Vienne, otherwise known as Theudericus of the Dauphinê, abbot of Saint-Chef near Vienne (563).

<doc id="878027" wikidata="Q2902370" url="?curid=878027" title="Chevrolet big-block engine">
<text>The Chevrolet big-block engine is a series of large-displacement, naturally-aspirated, 90°, overhead valve, gasoline-powered, V8 engines that was developed and have been produced by the Chevrolet Division of General Motors from the late 1950s until present. They have powered countless General Motors products, not just Chevrolets, and have been used in a variety of cars from other manufacturers as well - from boats to motorhomes to armored vehicles.

Chevrolet had introduced its popular small-block V8 in 1955, but needed something larger to power its medium duty trucks and the heavier cars that were on the drawing board. The big-block, which debuted in 1958 at , was built in standard displacements up to , with aftermarket crate engines sold by Chevrolet exceeding .

==Mark I (W-series)==
The first version of the &quot;big-block&quot; V8 Chevrolet engine, known as the W-series, was introduced in 1958. Chevrolet designed this engine for use in passenger cars and light trucks. This engine had an overhead valve design with offset valves and uniquely scalloped valve covers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The W-series was produced from 1958 to 1965, in three displacements:
* , available from 1958 to 1961 in cars, and in light trucks through 1964;
* , available from 1961 to 1965; and
* , available in 1962 and 1963.

The W-series engine was made of cast iron. The engine block had bore centers, two-bolt main bearing caps, a &quot;side oiling&quot; lubrication system (the main oil gallery located low on the driver&#x27;s side of the crankcase), with full-flow oil filter, and interchangeable cylinder heads. Heads used on the high performance 409 and 427 engines had larger ports and valves than those used on the 348 and the base 409 passenger car and truck engines, but externally were identical to the standard units – but for the location of the engine oil dipstick, on the driver&#x27;s side on the 348 and the passenger&#x27;s on the 409/427. No satisfactory explanation was ever offered for why this change was made, but it did provide a reliable means of distinguishing a 348 from the larger engines.

As with the &quot;small-block&quot; engines, the W-series valve gear consisted of tubular steel pushrods operating stud-mounted, stamped-steel rocker arms. The push rods also acted as conduits for oil flow to the valve gear. Due to the relatively low mass of the valve train, mechanical lifter versions of the W-series engine were capable of operating at speeds well beyond 6000 rpm.

The combustion chamber of the W-series engine was in the upper part of the cylinder, not the head, the head having only tiny recesses for the valves. This arrangement was achieved by combining a cylinder head deck that was not perpendicular to the bore with a crowned piston, which was a novel concept in American production engines of the day. As the piston approached top dead center, the angle of the crown combined with that of the head deck to form a wedge-shaped combustion chamber with a pronounced quench area. The spark plugs were inserted vertically into the quench area, which helped to produce a rapidly moving flame front for more complete combustion.

The theory behind this sort of arrangement is that maximum brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) is developed at relatively low engine speeds, resulting in an engine with a broad torque curve. With its relatively flat torque characteristics, the &quot;W&quot; engine was well-suited to propelling both the trucks and heavier cars that were in vogue in the US at the time. The W-series was a physically massive engine when compared to the &quot;small-block&quot; Chevrolet engine. It had a dry weight of approximately , depending on the type of intake manifold and carburetion systems present. It was 1.5 inches longer, 2.6 inches wider, and 0.84 inches shorter than the 283 &quot;small-block&quot;.

General Motors engineers explained, in 1959, reasons behind the combustion-in-block setup. Anticipating varied future compression ratios in future auto and truck use: &quot;It was obvious that with the combustion chamber placed within the cylinder head, the foundry must retool every time a compression change is in order. The necessity of making special heads to provide a range of compression ratios and to permit attachment of accessory mountings for the various model applications is of serious concern to the manufacturing and service departments ... Inclining the top of the block to 16° and shaping the top of the piston like a gabled roof with a 16° angle resulted in a 32° wedge-shaped combustion space ... The addition of two milled cutouts [in the head] to extend the volume of the combustion wedge can create a compression ratio of 7.5:1; one milled cutout produces a 9.5:1 compression ratio. The difference between the volume of these cutouts provides a wide compression range without making any changes in the piston or cylinder head. The number or size of cutouts is varied simply by adding or removing cutters.&quot;

===348===
The first iteration of the W-series engine was the 1958 &quot;Turbo-Thrust&quot; , originally intended for use in Chevrolet trucks but also introduced in the larger, heavier 1958 passenger car line. Bore and stroke was , resulting in a substantially oversquare design. This engine was superseded by the as Chevrolet&#x27;s top performing engine in 1961 and went out of production for cars at the end of that year. It was produced through 1964 for use in large Chevrolet trucks.

With a four-barrel carburetor, the base Turbo-Thrust produced . A special &quot;Tri power&quot; triple-two-barrel version, called the &quot;Super Turbo-Thrust&quot;, produced . A &quot;Special Turbo-Thrust&quot; upped the power output to with a single large four-barrel carburetor. Mechanical lifters and Tri power brought the &quot;Special Super Turbo-Thrust&quot; up to . For 1959 and 1960, high-output versions of the top two engines were produced with and respectively. In 1961, power was again increased to for the single four-barrel model, and when equipped with Tri power.

===409===

A version was Chevrolet&#x27;s top regular production engine from 1961 to 1965, with a choice of single or 2X4-barrel Rochester carburetors. Bore x stroke were both up from the to . On December 17, 1960, the 409 engine was announced along with the Impala SS (Super Sport) model. The initial version of the engine produced with a single 4-barrel Carter AFB carburetor. The same engine was upped to in 1962. A version of this engine was also available, developing 1 hp per cubic inch with a dual four-barrel aluminum intake manifold and two Carter AFB carburetors. It had a forged steel crankshaft. This dual-quad version was immortalized in the Beach Boys song titled &quot;409&quot;.

In the 1963 model year, output reached at 6000 rpm and at 4200 rpm of torque with the Rochester 2X4-barrel carburetor setup, a compression ratio of 11:1 and solid lifters. The engine was available through mid-1965, when it was replaced by the Mark IV big-block engine. In addition, a version of the 409 engine was available from 1963 to 1965, with a single 4-barrel cast iron intake mounting a Rochester 4GC square-bore carburetor, and hydraulic lifters.

===427 (Z11)===
A special version of the 409 engine was used in the 1963 Impala &quot;Sport Coupé&quot;, ordered under Chevrolet Regular Production Option (RPO) Z11. This was a special package created for drag racers, as well as NASCAR, and it consisted of a cowl-induction engine and body with selected aluminum stampings. The aluminum body parts were fabricated in Flint, Michigan at the facility now known as GM Flint Metal Center. Unlike the later, second-generation 427, it was based on the W-series 409 engine, but with a longer stroke. A high-rise, two-piece aluminum intake manifold and dual Carter AFB carburetors fed a 13.5:1 compression ratio to produce an under-rated SAE gross and . Fifty RPO Z11 cars were produced at the Flint GM plant.

Extant GM Documents show 50 Z11 engines were built at the GM Tonawanda Engine plant for auto production, and 20 partial engines were made for replacement/over-the-counter use. There is no evidence from GM that shows 57 cars were built.

==Mark II==
The so-called Mystery Motor, known internally as the Mark II or Mark IIS, is a race-only engine produced for the 1963 season. Development began with a version (Mark II) and ended with a variant; however only the engine (Mark IIS) was ever raced. It gained its nickname due to the incredible speeds cars equipped with it attained during its debut, being considerably faster than the well known W-series powered cars. The engine was first used in Mickey Thompson&#x27;s Z-06 Corvettes at Daytona in the 1963 Daytona 250 Miles – American Challenge Cup, and then in 1963 Daytona 500 where the number 13 car, driven by Johnny Rutherford, finished four laps down (in ninth place), with the top five cars being the heavier 1963 Ford Galaxie 500&#x27;s. This &quot;secret&quot; engine was a unique design incorporating aspects of both the W-series and the mid-1965 introduced Mark IV, referred to in sales literature as the &quot;Turbo-Jet V8&quot;.

==Mark III==
Richard Keinath, the original Mark II and IV design engineer stated that the MK III was a regular MK II design with a larger bore, but the Tonawanda plant didn&#x27;t want to cast a block with a bore that large. The rumor that Packard&#x27;s V8-engine tooling and production rights were considered for purchase by Chevrolet, was evidently true but never came to fruition.

The Mark III was supposed to be a Mark II with bigger bore centers, but it never left the drawing board due to high tooling costs.

==Mark IV==
The Mark IV differed from the W-series engine in the placement of the valves and the shape of the combustion chambers. The chamber-in-block design of the W-series engine (which caused the power curve to drastically dip above 6500 rpm), was replaced by a more conventional wedge chamber in the cylinder head, which was now attached to a conventional 90 degree deck. The valves continued to use the displaced arrangement of the W-series engine, but were also inclined so that they would open away from the combustion chamber and cylinder walls, a design feature made possible by Chevrolet&#x27;s stud mounted rocker arms. This alteration in valve placement resulted in a significant improvement in volumetric efficiency at high RPM and a substantial increase in power output at racing speeds. Owing to the appearance of the compound angularity of the valves, the automotive press dubbed the engine the &quot;porcupine&quot; design.

As part of the head redesign, the spark plugs were relocated so that they entered the combustion chamber at an angle relative to the cylinder centerline, rather than the straight-in relationship of the W-series engine. This too helped high RPM performance. Due to the new spark plug angle, the clearance provided by the distinctive scalloped valve covers of the W-series was no longer needed, and wide, rectangular covers were used.

In all forms (except the aluminum ZL-1), the Mark IV was slightly heavier than the W-series model, with a dry weight of about . Aside from the new cylinder head design and the reversion to a conventional 90 degree cylinder head deck angle, the Mark IV shared many dimensional and mechanical design features with the W-series engine. The cylinder block, although more substantial in all respects, used the same cylinder bore spacing of with a larger main bearing dimension, increased from the of the older engine. Like its predecessor, the Mark IV used crowned pistons, which were castings for conventional models and impact extruded (forged), solid skirt types in high performance applications.

Also retained from the W-series design were the race-proven Moraine M400 aluminum bearings first used in the 409, and the highly efficient &quot;side oiling&quot; lubrication system, which assured maximum oil flow to the main and connecting rod bearings at all times. Later blocks intended for performance use had the main oil gallery moved up to the cam bearing bore area and provided &quot;priority main&quot; oiling, improving the oil system even further.

===366===
The big-block V-8 gasoline engine was used in Chevrolet medium duty trucks and school buses. It had a bore and a stroke of . This engine was made from the 1960s until 2004. The 366 used 4 rings on the pistons, as it was designed from the very beginning as a truck engine. The 366 was produced only as a tall-deck engine, with a deck taller than the 396, 402, and 454 short-deck big-blocks.

===396 and 402===
The V8 was introduced in the 1965 Corvette as the L78 option and in the Z-16 Chevelle as the L37 option. It had a bore × stroke of , and produced at 5600 rpm and of torque at 3600 rpm. The solid lifter version was capable of being operated in the upper 6000 rpm range, and when installed in the 1965 Corvette, was factory-rated at .

Introduced in 1970, the was a bored out by . Despite being larger, Chevrolet continued marketing it under the popular &quot;396&quot; label in the smaller cars while at the same time labeling it &quot;Turbo-Jet 400&quot; in the full-size cars.

===427===

The highly successful and versatile version of the Mark IV engine was introduced in 1966 as a production engine option for full-sized Chevrolets and Corvettes. The bore was increased to , with power ratings varying widely depending on the application. There were smooth running versions with hydraulic lifters suitable for powering the family station wagon, as well as rough-idling, high-revving solid lifter models usually applied to a minimally equipped, plain-looking, two-door Biscayne sedan fitted with the version of the 427 (RPO L72).

Perhaps the ultimate 427 for street applications was the at 5800 rpm and at 4000 rpm of torque L71 version available in 1967 to 1969 Corvettes, and in the Italian Iso Grifo. This engine was identical to the L72 427 (first introduced in 1966), but was fitted with 3×2-barrel Holley carburetors, known as &quot;Tri-Power,&quot; in lieu of the L72&#x27;s single 4-barrel carburetor. Both engines used the same high-lift, long-duration, high-overlap camshaft and large-port, cast-iron heads to maximize cylinder head airflow (and, hence, engine power) at elevated engine-operating speeds. Consequently, the engines offered very similar performance and resulted in a car whose performance was described by one automotive journalist as &quot;the ultimate in sheer neck-snapping overkill&quot;. Typical 2000s-era magazine road tests of Corvettes with the engine yielded 0- in 5.6 seconds and  in 13.8 second at range for both the L72 and L71.

In 2011, &quot;Super Chevy Magazine&quot; conducted a chassis dynamometer test of a well documented, production-line, stock but well-tuned L-72 &quot;COPO&quot; Camaro, and recorded a peak at the rear wheels, demonstrating the substantial difference between 1960s-era SAE &quot;gross&quot; horsepower ratings and horsepower at the wheels on a chassis dynamometer. Wheel horsepower (which is obtained at the drive wheels and thus takes into account drivetrain power loss of the transmission, driveshaft, and differential, as well as all accessories) does not equate to SAE net HP (which is horsepower at the flywheel, but with all essential peripherals included (such as the water pump, alternator, and air cleaner), accessories (such as a power steering pump, if fitted), a stock exhaust system, and all required emission controls, none of which are accounted for in SAE gross, which only measures gross flywheel horsepower).

The RPO L89 was an L71 fitted with aluminum heads. While this option produced no power advantage, it did reduce engine (and hence, vehicle) weight by roughly . Although the difference in straight line performance was negligible, the weight savings resulted in superior vehicle weight distribution and improved handling and braking.

====ZL1====
The all-aluminum 1969 ZL1 version of the 427 engine was developed primarily for Can-Am racing, which did not require homologation to compete,; it was very successful in cars like the McLaren M8B. The ZL1 specifications were nearly identical to the production L88 version of the 427, but featured an aluminum block in addition to aluminum cylinder heads. The first Corvette with the RPO ZL1 engine package was built in early December 1968 and featured aluminum closed chamber heads shared with the L88. Both L88 and ZL1 optioned cars continued to be built with closed chamber heads until approximately March 1969, when the open combustion chamber aluminum heads finally were in production and began being fitted to the L88 and ZL1 engines. The ZL1 engine also featured a lightweight aluminum water pump, a camshaft that was slightly &quot;hotter&quot; than the L88&#x27;s, and a specially tuned aluminum intake manifold. Like the L88, the ZL1 required 103 octane (RON) (minimum) fuel (102 octane RON [Sunoco 260] represented the highest octane gasoline sold at common retail stations), used an unshrouded radiator, and had poor low-speed idle qualities – all of which made the two engines largely unsuitable for street use. 

As impressive as the ZL1 was in its day, actual engine dyno tests of a certified production line stock ZL1 revealed SAE net with rated output swelling to SAE gross with the help of optimal carb and ignition tuning, open long tube racing headers, and with no power-sapping engine accessories or air cleaner in place. A second engine dyno test conducted on a second production line stock (but recently rebuilt and partially blueprinted) ZL1 revealed nearly identical figures for the various &quot;gross&quot; conditions.

Period magazine tests of the ZL1 were quite rare due to the rarity of the engine itself. &quot;High-Performance Cars&quot; tested a production line stock, but well tuned, example and recorded a 13.1 second/ , which correlates quite well with the previously referenced SAE Net figure. &quot;Super Stock and Drag Racing Magazine&quot; recorded an 11.62 second/ in a professionally tuned ZL1 Camaro with open long-tube S&amp;S equal-length headers, drag slicks, and minor suspension modifications, driven by drag racing legend Dick Harrell. Using Patrick Hale&#x27;s Power/Speed formula, the trap speed indicated low 11-second ET (elapsed time) potential (e.g. with larger drag slicks) and suggested something on the order of , &quot;as installed&quot;, in that modified configuration. This large difference in power suggests that the OEM exhaust manifolds and exhaust system were highly restrictive in the ZL1 application, as was also the case with the similar L88.

The then-staggering $4,718 cost of the ZL1 option doubled the price of the 1969 Corvette, resulting in just two production Corvettes (factory option at dealer) and 69 of the 1969 Camaros (non-dealer option from factory – COPO 9560) being built with the ZL1.

Chevrolet capitalized on the versatility of the 427 design by producing a wide variety of high-performance, &quot;over-the-counter&quot; engine components as well as ready-to-race &quot;replacement&quot; engines in shipping crates. Some of the components were developed to enhance the engine&#x27;s reliability during high RPM operation, possibly justifying the use of the description &quot;heavy duty.&quot; However, most of these items were racing parts originally designed for Can-Am competition that found their way onto dealers&#x27; shelves, and were meant to boost the engine&#x27;s power output.

Beginning in 1969, the highest performance 427 models were fitted with the new open (vs. closed) chamber cylinder heads, along with design improvements in crankshafts, connecting rods, and pistons, adopted from the Can-Am development program.

Chevrolet gave all 427 engines except the ZL1 a torque rating of .

===454===
For 1970, the big-block was expanded again, to , with a bore × stroke of . The 1970 Chevrolet Corvette LS-5 version of this engine was factory-rated at and , and the LS-6 engine equipped with a single 4-barrel Holley carburetor was upgraded to at 5600 rpm and at 3600 rpm of torque.

The AHRA ASA (Showroom Stock Automatic) Class record-holding Chevelle LS-6 for the 1970 racing season posted a best-of-season trap speed of , which suggests something on the order of 350 &quot;as installed&quot; (SAE Net) HP for a car-and-driver combination. Indeed, &quot;Super Chevy Magazine&quot; conducted a chassis dyno test of a well-documented, well tuned, but stock 1970 LS-6 Chevelle and recorded 283 peak HP at the wheels – a figure that lines up quite well with the previously referenced 350 SAE Net HP figure.

An even more powerful version, producing and , of the 454, then dubbed LS-7 (not to be confused with the modern, mid 2000s, 7-litre Chevrolet Corvette engine that powered the C6 Z06, which is an LS7). Several LS-7 intake manifolds were individually produced and sold to the general public by a few Chevrolet dealers as optional performance parts. The LS-7 was later offered as a crate engine from Chevrolet Performance with an officially rated power minimum of gross.

In 1971, the LS-5 produced and , and the LS-6 option came in at and . In 1972, only the LS-5 remained, when SAE net power ratings and the move towards emission compliance resulted in a temporary output decline, due to lowered compression, to about and . The 1973 LS-4 produced and , with and gone the following year. Hardened valve seats further increased reliability and helped allow these engines to last much longer than the earlier versions, even without the protection previously provided by leaded fuel. 1974 was the last year of the 454 in the Corvette, although the Chevelle offered it in the first half of the 1975 model year. It was also available in the full size Impala/Caprice through model year 1976.

===L19===
General Motors introduced EFI in 1987, which was found on GM C1500 SS, C/K2500, and C/K3500 trucks. The 454 EFI version was rated from to and from to of torque. The 1991–1993 454SS made 255 horsepower at 4000 rpm and 405 lb-ft of torque at 2400 rpm thanks to dual 2.5&quot; catalytic converters. All other versions, including the 1990 SS, made 230 horsepower at 3600 rpm and 385 lb-ft of torque at 1600 rpm through a single 3&quot; catalytic converter.

===Commercial applications===
Mark IV engines saw extensive application in Chevrolet and GMC medium duty trucks, as well as in Blue Bird Corporation&#x27;s All American and TC/2000 transit buses (the latter up until 1995, using a 427 with purpose-built carburetor). In addition to the 427, a version was produced for the commercial market. Both the 366 and 427 commercial versions were built with a raised-deck, four-bolt main bearing cap cylinder to accommodate an extra oil control ring on the pistons. Unfortunately, the raised deck design complicated the use of the block in racing applications, as standard intake manifolds required spacers for proper fit. Distributors with adjustable collars that allowed adjustments to the length of the distributor shaft also had to be used with 366 and 427 truck blocks.

Mark IV engines also found themselves widely used in power boats. Many of these engines were ordinary Chevrolet production models that were fitted with the necessary accessories and drive system to adapt them to marine propulsion. Mercury Marine, in particular, was a major user of the Mark IV in marine drives, and relabeled the engines with their corporate logo.

==Generation V==
For 1991, General Motors made significant changes to the big-block resulting in the Generation V. The block received a one-piece rear seal and all blocks received 4-bolt mains. Additionally the main oil galley was moved from near the oil pan to near the camshaft. Also the valvetrain became non-adjustable and the provisions for a mechanical fuel pump were eliminated. Cast aluminum valve covers were fitted in place of stamped steel covers, featuring a screw-in filler cap. Structural changes were carried out to the cylinder block to improve the integrity of the bores and the inlet manifold was changed to a single-piece design.

===6.0 (L50)===
The truck engine also received the Mark V updates for 1991.

===L19===
From 1991, the 454 was updated to the new Gen V block, crankshaft and heads. This engine was rated at 230 net hp, 380 lb-ft net torque, and was discontinued after 1995, with GM coming out with the Vortec 7400 in 1996.

===502===
The 502—with a total displacement—had a bore and stroke of and a cast iron 4-bolt main block. GM offered it in their Performance Parts catalog, available as multiple crate motors with horsepower ratings from and torque of in &quot;Base&quot; and &quot;Deluxe&quot; packages. The &quot;Ram Jet 502,&quot; the / crate motor, was offered with fuel injection, and came as a turn key setup which included all the wiring and electronics needed to operate in any vehicle. It was also used in marine applications.

===ZZ572===
General Motors began offering a newly developed in 1998 to the aftermarket via its GM Performance Parts division. This engine has a bore and a stroke of . This is a and version, designated ZZ572/620 Deluxe, capable of running on 92 octane pump gasoline for street applications. Another version of the same engine is available as a high compression variant, codenamed ZZ572/720R Deluxe, generating a minimum of on high-octane racing fuel. The 572 is officially offered by Chevrolet for the 2022 model year COPO Camaro.

===ZZ632===
In 2021, Chevrolet Performance presented the largest and most powerful crate engine in the brand&#x27;s history—the ZZ632/1000 crate engine. It is a naturally-aspirated, V8, producing and of torque. The motor itself weighs .

According to Russ O&#x27;Blenes, the GM director of the Performance and Racing Propulsion Team, the ZZ632 is the &quot;biggest, baddest crate engine we&#x27;ve ever built. [It] sits at the top of our unparalleled crate engine lineup as the king of performance. It delivers incredible power, and it does it on pump gas.&quot;

The big-block V8 reaches peak power at 6,600 rpm, and revs to a recommended maximum of 7,000 rpm. Fuel is delivered through eight-port injectors, with the engine breathing through CNC-machined high-flow aluminum cylinder heads featuring symmetrical ports. While big-blocks have usually been designed with variations in port shape from cylinder to cylinder, all eight intake ports of the ZZ632 have the same volume, length, and layout. Furthermore, all of the ZZ632&#x27;s exhaust ports are identical. This arrangement guarantees all individual cylinders produce similar power.

These RS-X symmetrical port cylinder heads are named for powertrain engineer Ron Sperry, who designed them as one of his final accomplishments in more than 50 years working on General Motors performance and racing engines. Sperry also introduced symmetrical ports to Chevy&#x27;s iconic small-block V-8, with the Gen III LS1 engine that debuted in the 1997 Chevrolet Corvette.

The ZZ632&#x27;s iron block shares a mold with Chevrolet Performance&#x27;s ZZ572 crate engines, but the castings are machined to accommodate the huge 632 cubic-inch displacement. The bore grows by , compared to the 572-cubic-inch V8s, with most of the displacement gain coming from a stroke that is longer. To provide clearance for that long-stroke, engineers modified both the block and the connecting rods. Four-bolt main caps and a forged rotating assembly assure strength and durability. During development, a single engine endured more than 200 simulated drag strip passes on a dynamometer.

The ZZ632/1000 crate engine was slated to be on display at the November 2021 SEMA Show in Las Vegas. Chevrolet Performance dealers were to begin deliveries in early 2022.

==Generation VI==
===Vortec 7400 (L29)===
The Vortec 7400 L29 V8 was a truck version of the Chevrolet big-block engine. Introduced in 1996, it was produced for five years, until replaced by the Vortec 8100. Although introduced as the Vortec 7400 in 1996, it was basically a 454 big-block with a hydraulic roller cam, parts more suitable for use in light trucks, and more advanced technology. The engine had MPFI (multi-port fuel injection), which gave slightly more power and better fuel economy, and two valves per cylinder. The engine had a bore and stroke of , producing at 4000 rpm and at 3200 rpm.
It was used by Mercury Marine, named the Mercruiser 7.4 MPI and later Mercruiser 7.4 Mag. Mercury also adopted the 8.1L engine

L29 applications:
* 1996–2000 Chevrolet C/K / GMC Sierra 2500, 3500, and C3500HD (above 8,500 pounds GVWR)
* 1996–1999 Chevrolet/GMC Suburban 2500
* 1996–2000 Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana 3500
* Mercury Marine Inboard

===Vortec 7400 (L21)===
The Vortec 7400 L21 was a commercial version of the Chevrolet big-block engine used in the medium duty truck platform. Its design shared much with the L29 454, but with the addition of forged pistons and crankshaft, and coil near plug ignition. It had slightly reduced power compared to the L29 454 and used a different PCM. The L21 was paired with the early 4-speed Allison automatic transmission or manual transmission, depending on the application.

L21 applications:
* 1998–2001 Chevrolet Kodiak/GMC TopKick/Isuzu H-Series 4500 and 5500
* 1998–2001 P12 HD Motorhome Chassis. The Workhorse W-20 is a clone of the P12 Chassis.

==Generation VII==
=== Vortec 8100 (L18)===
The Vortec 8100 L18 is a big-block V8 engine primarily used as a truck engine. It was a redesigned Chevrolet big-block engine and was introduced with the 2001 full-size pickup trucks. It is an all-iron engine (block and heads) with two valves per cylinder. It retained the bore diameter of the old and big-blocks, but the stroke was increased to for a total displacement of . Power output ranged from , and torque from .

Other important differences between the Vortec 8100 and older big-blocks include a changed firing order. The firing order of older big-block engines is 1-8-4-3-6-5-7-2 while Vortec 8100&#x27;s firing order is 1-8-7-2-6-5-4-3. Other upgrades of Vortec 8100 include a new 18-bolt head bolt pattern, longer connecting rods, different symmetrical intake ports, different oil pan rails, and the use of metric threads throughout the engine. The fuel-injection system for the Vortec 8100 is nearly identical to that used on Gen III small-block engines, right down to the fuel and spark tables in the ECU.

GM sold the Vortec 8100 to Workhorse (now a division of Navistar), making it one of the most popular engine choices in gasoline-powered Class A motorhomes during the early 2000s. GM stopped installing big-block V8s in the Silverado HD trucks when the GMT800 series was discontinued in 2007.

Vortec 8100s were built at GM&#x27;s Tonawanda Engine plant while the engine block and cylinder head were cast at Saginaw Metal Casting Operations. The last L18 was manufactured in December 2009.

L18 applications:

* 2001–2002 Chevrolet/GMC C3500HD
* 2001–2007 Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra 2500HD and 3500 (option)
* 2001–2006 Chevrolet Suburban/GMC Yukon XL 2500 (option)
* 2001–2002 Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana 3500
* 2002–2006 Chevrolet Avalanche 2500 (standard)
* 2001–2010 Chevrolet Kodiak/GMC TopKick (including U-Haul&#x27;s truck)
* Workhorse Class A motorhomes
* T-98 Kombat armored vehicles
* Malibu Boats, including the Wakesetter
* MasterCraft Boats

==Aftermarket==
Many custom engine builders across the United States, as well as a large variety of aftermarket components manufactured for the big-block family, make it possible to build a complete big-block engine that contains no Chevrolet components. Blocks made of both iron and aluminum alloys, for many different purposese.g. street-use, racing, etc.are available in stock or modified configurations, as well as with increased deck height to allow for a longer stroke or more favorable rod length ratios, depending on intent, providing the ability to make engines with capacities of , , and as large as .

<text>Pieter Both (1568 – 6 March 1615) was the first Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies.

Not much is known of his early years. In 1599, Both was already an admiral in the New, or Brabant Company. In that year, he traveled to the East Indies with four ships. When the newly founded Dutch East India Company set up a government for the Dutch East Indies, Pieter Both was invited to become the Governor-General. He held that position from 19 December 1610 to 6 November 1614. During that period he concluded contracts with the Moluccans, conquered Timor, and drove the Spaniards out of Tidore.

After he relinquished his position as Governor-General to Gerard Reynst, he left for the Netherlands with four ships. Two of the ships were shipwrecked in Mauritius at Flic-en-Flac, and Pieter Both drowned.

The second highest mountain of Mauritius is named Pieter Both after him.

<text>Hilary Duff is the third studio album by American singer Hilary Duff. It was released on September 15, 2004, by Hollywood Records. The recording sessions for the seventeen-track album took place in between Duff&#x27;s filming of &quot;Raise Your Voice&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Perfect Man&quot; (2005).

The album was a modest commercial success, and it received generally negative reviews from music critics, many of whom compared the album to the music of Avril Lavigne and Ashlee Simpson. The album debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 192,000 copies in its first week. To date, &quot;Hilary Duff&quot; has sold 1,800,000 copies in the US, less than her debut album which sold 3.9 million copies in the country. It became her second consecutive number one debut in Canada and produced two singles that were not major hits. It was eventually certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;Hilary Duff&quot; was number 65 on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s year-end top albums chart in November 2005.

The lead single from &quot;Hilary Duff&quot;, &quot;Fly&quot; premiered on August 26, 2004, on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. The song was officially released as a single on October 19, 2004; it peaked outside the top twenty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 Mainstream chart but failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Fly&quot; was the only single released in the United States. The second Australia-only single, &quot;Someone&#x27;s Watching Over Me&quot;, was released on February 21, 2005, to promote the film &quot;Raise Your Voice&quot;, charted at number 22 on the ARIA Singles Chart.

== Background and development ==
According to Duff, the album chronicles her experiences over the year before its release: &quot;some of it&#x27;s good, and some of it&#x27;s bad, and a lot of it&#x27;s, like, a big learning experience,&quot; she explained. She expressed an interest in recording lyrically more aggressive material than the songs on &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; (2003) and wanted the album to reflect that, according to her, she is a normal sixteen-year-old. &quot;Well, I&#x27;m not going to be singing about lollipops because I no longer relate to lollipops,&quot; she said. &quot;Basically, I&#x27;m not Lizzie McGuire anymore.&quot; She said the album deals with issues she would not discuss publicly and provides &quot;some answers,&quot; but she disagreed with people who believed the album presented a different side of her, saying &quot;I think it&#x27;s just &quot;more&quot; me this time because I got to really do it how I wanted to.&quot; Duff called the album &quot;different [from]&quot; &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; and &quot;much more mature,&quot; particularly in its sound, but not to the point where it would be inappropriate for children: &quot;I just think that other people will relate better.&quot; According to her, she was more &quot;involved&quot; compared to the production of her first album and &quot;confident enough to make suggestions&quot; about the style of the album: &quot;If I thought it needed to be more heavy, more rock, I said so.&quot;

Four songs — &quot;Fly&quot;, &quot;Someone&#x27;s Watching over Me&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot; and &quot;Jericho&quot; — were used in &quot;Raise Your Voice&quot;, a film released shortly after the album in which Duff starred as an aspiring singer who attends a prestigious performing arts summer school. Duff has described &quot;Fly&quot; as &quot;an uplifting song&quot; about &quot;how people are scared to open up and show who they are inside because they&#x27;re afraid of what others are going to say.&quot; Her character performs &quot;Someone&#x27;s Watching over Me&quot; at the film&#x27;s climax and &quot;Jericho&quot; during the end credits, with the other characters performing the instruments. The album&#x27;s release in Japan includes three bonus tracks: an acoustic version of &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl?&quot;, a cover of The Go-Go&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; recorded with Haylie for the soundtrack to Duff&#x27;s film &quot;A Cinderella Story&quot;, and a cover of The Who&#x27;s &quot;My Generation&quot; in which the lyric &quot;I hope I die before I get old&quot; was changed to &quot;I hope I don&#x27;t die before I get old&quot;. Duff began performing it in concert after a suggestion from her manager, who was a fan of the song.
Duff herself co-wrote three tracks on the album: &quot;Mr. James Dean&quot;, &quot;Haters&quot; and &quot;Rock This World&quot;, the first two of which, along with &quot;The Last Song&quot;, Haylie co-wrote. Hilary said she refrained from co-writing the entire album because &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m secure enough with myself to do that.&quot; She characterised &quot;Haters&quot; as &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; and said people would know what it is about when they heard it, and it attracted substantial publicity when rumors circulated that it was about actress Lindsay Lohan, with whom Duff was alleged to have been feuding. Duff denied that the rumors were true, saying she did not know Lohan and would not write a song about her. She said that at the time she wrote it she was feeling she had to openly discuss her personal life because &quot;people make accusations and there are lies and rumors constantly ... people are so negative. They love to read what&#x27;s coming out next on Page Six [of the &quot;New York Post&quot;] and I just felt like it was appropriate.&quot; She said she felt &quot;normal girls&quot; could relate to the song because of the &quot;petty stuff&quot; that occurs in schools.

Duff told the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; in 2005 that because she was under the control of her record label during the making of &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; and &quot;Hilary Duff&quot;, she wasn&#x27;t able to incorporate the sound she wanted into her recordings. She said the production &quot;[had] been mastered and sounds really pretty ... If I could change it, I would, and it would sound [less pop]. My name is Hilary Duff, and I don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t get to make Hilary Duff music.&quot;

== Recording and production ==
Duff recorded the first three songs for the album between the shooting dates of &quot;Raise Your Voice&quot; and &quot;The Perfect Man&quot;, two films in which she was involved. Subsequent songs were recorded on the weekends during filming of &quot;The Perfect Man&quot; and on the nights after concerts on her summer 2004 tour. The album&#x27;s outro track, &quot;The Last Song&quot;, was recorded in her dressing room.

When discussion regarding her second album began, Duff said she wanted to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;. &quot;[They] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them [all the time] ... They knew what was going on in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside,&quot; Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; who returned for &quot;Hilary Duff&quot; include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff&#x27;s sister Haylie. Hilary said, &quot;I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I&#x27;m working so hard, and I don&#x27;t have time to think about it. But if we sit down and we talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it&#x27;ll be good.&quot;

Several producers and songwriters who did not contribute to &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; worked on the album, including Andreas Carlsson and Desmond Child (&quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl?&quot;), British songwriter Guy Chambers (&quot;Shine&quot;), Julian Bunetta and James Michael (&quot;The Getaway&quot;) and Ty Stevens (&quot;Rock This World&quot;). Ron Entwistle is co-writer and co-producer of &quot;Weird&quot;, which Duff said is &quot;about someone that she&#x27;s still obsessed with. And everything he does is like he says this, but he does this ... She&#x27;s not really sure who he is or what he does, but she likes it.&quot; Kevin De Clue contributed to &quot;The Last Song&quot; and &quot;Mr. James Dean&quot; (both co-produced by Haylie), which Duff has named her favorite track on the album and described as &quot;very funny&quot;; in the song, she tells an ex-boyfriend that he&#x27;ll &quot;never be James Dean.&quot; Duff neither confirmed nor denied whether the song was about fellow singer Aaron Carter, and she said &quot;it was definitely an experience that I went through that was interesting and I learned a lot from that time in my life.&quot; In &quot;Hide Away&quot;, co-produced and co-written by Shaun Shankel, Duff discusses a relationship that isn&#x27;t working because she is in a position where her life is &quot;figuratively under the microscope.&quot; Diane Warren wrote &quot;I Am&quot;, an empowerment song in which Duff lists positive and negative aspects about herself; she has said it is about being comfortable &quot;with all those feelings ... being who you are.&quot; David Campbell arranged and conducted strings for the tracks &quot;Someone&#x27;s Watching Over Me&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl?&quot;.

Duff&#x27;s management team considered recording a song titled &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; for the album, which Lukasz &quot;Dr. Luke&quot; Gottwald and Max Martin had originally written for Pink. According to Gottwald, Duff&#x27;s team passed on the song because some of the notes were too high for Duff&#x27;s voice. &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; was later recorded by Kelly Clarkson, for whom it became a major hit.

== Singles ==
&quot;Fly&quot; was the lead and only single with a music video from the album. It is also the only single released in the US. The music video directed by Chris Applebaum, combines black-and-white backstage footage with color shots of Duff performing the song. The video premiered on MTV&#x27;s Total Request Live on August 26, 2004.

&quot;Someone&#x27;s Watching over Me&quot; was released in Australia as a second and final single from the album. The music video was the shot from the 2004 movie &quot;Raise Your Voice&quot; where Duff plays the lead role.

=== Other notable songs ===
Duff said during the time the album was released that she was considering &quot;Haters&quot; as the second single, but she later changed her mind and decided she wanted &quot;Weird&quot; to become the next single.

Towards the end of 2004, several radio singles were released to promote the album. &quot;The Getaway&quot; was issued in the US in November 2004 and in Canada in January 2005, and &quot;I Am&quot; was released to Radio Disney in December 2004; shortly after, promotion for &quot;Weird&quot; began in Spain.

== Promotion ==
Duff embarked on a concert tour of North America, and several of her shows in Canada sold out in minutes.

== Critical reception ==
The album received mixed to negative reviews. Ken Barnes of &quot;USA Today&quot;, which gave &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; a negative review, commented positively on the album and said it exemplified &quot;a more wholesome brand of rock-flavored pop aimed at teens&quot;. Barnes praised the &quot;unstoppably rousing choruses&quot; in some of the songs and said &quot;Duff avoids overextending her thin but pleasant voice, except for a bit of Avrilesque syllable stretching&quot;, while he criticised the high number of tracks and the preponderance of &quot;hackneyed self-affirmation messages&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine categorised &quot;Hilary Duff&quot; as &quot;a virtual companion to Ashlee Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot;, from its rock/dance-pop fusion to its earnest demeanor&quot; and &quot;a varied, ambitious album ... it feels like the soundtrack to the life of a smart, ambitious, popular teenager trying to sort things out&quot;.

A review of &quot;Hilary Duff&quot; in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was far less praising; it said &quot;Duff&#x27;s role in the tween-rock firmament is playing pious Lisa Loeb opposite Simpson&#x27;s post-diluvian Courtney Love ... despite liberal amounts of gold-dust guitar glitter, blow-dried backing vocals, and even the post-crash-Skynyrd &#x27;Rock This World&#x27;, Hilary Duff is too often the vanilla-bean fantasia AOR chauvinists take all girl-pop for.&quot; &quot;Stylus&quot; magazine wrote that Duff&#x27;s attempt to follow &quot;the [Avril Lavigne] template that she previously softened&quot; yielded &quot;mixed results ... to a certain extent, [she] is a prisoner of her image and her attempts at Chrissie Hynde-intensity fall far short of even Ashlee Simpson&#x27;s gravelly vocal cords.&quot; Its critic described the album&#x27;s length as its &quot;simple problem&quot;, saying that with &quot;a little quality control ... this could easily be as strong as any other teen-pop album released this year.&quot;

In response to Duff&#x27;s &quot;announcement&quot; that &quot;she&#x27;s a complicated rock &amp; roll adolescent on the order of Avril and Ashlee&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;Uh-huh. And Betty from the &quot;Archie&quot; comics is Patti Smith&quot;, noting Duff&#x27;s &quot;tiny&quot; voice is &quot;buried under layers of generic cheese arrangements.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; called the album &quot;a seemingly endless string of three-and-a-half-minute pieces of pop crap – and I like pop music&quot;, and wrote that although Duff &quot;can&#x27;t be held responsible for most of the album&#x27;s insipid lyrical content&quot;, &quot;when [she] gets in on the action things feel contrived&quot;. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; named it the worst teen pop album of 2004, saying it was &quot;[n]eck-and-neck for junkiest CD of the year with her arch nemesis, Lindsay Lohan [&quot;Speak&quot;]&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==
The album debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 192,000 copies sold in its first week of release, which was 11,000 copies less than the first week sales of &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;. IGN Music said that partly because of the album&#x27;s high debut, &quot;at this very moment Hilary Duff is perhaps the reigning queen of bubblegum pop theatrics&quot;; it also said that Duff&#x27;s image was &quot;undergoing an overhaul&quot; through photo shoots in magazines such as &quot;Blender&quot;, possibly making her less &quot;squeaky clean&quot; like her predecessors Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears. In its second week, the album slipped to number six with 95,500 copies sold, down 51% over the first week of release; the following week the album stayed at six, selling 84,000 copies and falling 12% over the past week. Unlike &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, &quot;Hilary Duff&quot; went no higher on the Billboard 200, and the RIAA certified it platinum a month after its release. &quot;Hilary Duff&quot; was number 112 on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s year-end top albums chart in December 2004 and number sixty-five on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s year-end top albums chart in November 2005. As of July 27, 2014, the album had sold 1,799,000 copies in the United States.

The album debuted at number one on the Nielsen SoundScan chart in Canada, as &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; had done, and it was released in Australia in October. It debuted in the top ten on the ARIA album chart, surpassing the top twenty peak of &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; and rising to its number six peak position in November. &quot;Fly&quot; was released as a single in the same month and did not perform as well, reaching just outside the top twenty. Duff embarked on a two-date tour of Australia in late October, supported by &quot;Popstars&quot; winner Scott Cain. In Canada, the CRIA certified the album three times platinum for 300,000 copies.

<doc id="878031" wikidata="Q369758" url="?curid=878031" title="Jacques Copeau">
<text>Jacques Copeau (; 4 February 1879 – 20 October 1949) was a French theatre director, producer, actor, and dramatist. Before he founded the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier in Paris, he wrote theatre reviews for several Parisian journals, worked at the Georges Petit Gallery where he organized exhibits of artists&#x27; works and helped found the &quot;Nouvelle Revue Française&quot; in 1909, along with writer friends, such as André Gide and Jean Schlumberger.

Twentieth century French theatre is marked by Copeau&#x27;s outlook. According to Albert Camus, &quot;in the history of the French theatre, there are two periods: before Copeau and after Copeau.&quot;

==Early life and formative years==

The child of a well-off middle-class family, the Paris-born Copeau was raised in Paris and attended the best schools. At the Lycée Condorcet, he was a talented but nonchalant student whose interest in theatre already consumed him. His first staged play, &quot;Brouillard du matin&quot; (&quot;Morning Fog&quot;), was presented on 27 March 1897 at the Nouveau-Théâtre as part of the festivities of the alumni association of the Lycée Condorcet. The former president of the French Republic, Casimir-Perier, and the playwright Georges de Porto-Riche both congratulated him on his work.

During the same period when Copeau was preparing his baccalauréat exams, he met Agnès Thomsen, a young Danish woman seven years his elder who was in Paris to perfect her French. They first met on 13 March 1896, and Copeau, then a seventeen-year-old high school student, quickly fell in love.

Eventually, Copeau passed his exams and began his studies in philosophy at the Sorbonne, but the theatre, extensive reading, and his courtship of Agnès left him little time to study and kept him from passing his exams for the &quot;licence&quot;, despite several attempts. Against his mother&#x27;s wishes he married Agnès in June 1902 in Copenhagen. Their first child, Marie-Hélène (called Maiène), was born on 2 December 1902. In mid-April 1905 their second daughter, Hedwig, was born.

In April 1903, the young family made its way back to France where Copeau took up his duties as director of the family&#x27;s factory in Raucourt in the Ardennes. He reinserted himself into a small literary &quot;coterie&quot; of friends, among them now, André Gide. While living in Angecourt in the Ardennes, Copeau frequently travelled to Paris where he made a name for himself as theatre critic-at-large for several publications. Back in Paris in 1905, Copeau continued his work as theatre critic, writing reviews of such plays as Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; and Gabriele D’Annunzio&#x27;s &quot;La Gioconda&quot; as well an overview of the structure of contemporary theatre published in &quot;L&#x27;Ermitage&quot; in February.

In July 1905, he took on a job at the Georges Petit Gallery where he assembled exhibits and wrote the catalogues. He stayed at the Petit Gallery until May 1909. During this period he continued to write theatre reviews and garnered a reputation as an astute and principled judge of the theatre arts. The sale of the factory in Raucourt gave him the financial independence that allowed him to pursue his literary activities. Copeau was one of the founders of the &quot;Nouvelle Revue Française&quot; (NRF),:61 a publication that was to become one of the leading arbiters of literary taste in France.

Copeau and his young family visited the island of Jersey on two occasions. In 1907, he stayed at Prospect Lodge, then in 1909 at Madeira Villa, both in St Brelade, where he pursued his work on theatrical adaptations, the most well-known being that of Dostoevsky’s &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, a project co-written with schoolfriend Jean Croué. André Gide, a visitor to Jersey in 1907, played a pivotal role in Copeau&#x27;s career at this stage.

He finished work on &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; by the end of 1910. He was now ready to work in the theatre as a practitioner not only as critic.

The play was staged in April 1911 under the direction of Jacques Rouché at the Théâtre des Arts, receiving favorable reviews. Charles Dullin, who played the role of Smerdiakov, was particularly singled out for a fine performance. A second staging of the adaptation the following October, with Louis Jouvet in the role of Father Zossima, confirmed the earlier critical claim.

In 1910, he bought &quot;Le Limon&quot;, a piece of property in the Seine-et-Marne &quot;département&quot;, away from the distractions of Paris.

==The Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier==

Copeau wanted to rid the Paris stage of the rank commercialism and tawdriness represented by the boulevard theatre. He wanted to move the theatre to a simpler style, freed from the ornamentation that obscured even the finest texts.
On the Left Bank, on the rue du Vieux-Colombier, he rented the old and dilapidated Athénée-Saint-Germain, an unlikely venue for the utopian ideals of Copeau, but its location at distance from the commercial theatre district gave a signal that he intended to pursue a new path. He named the theatre after the street so that it could be found more easily. In the spring of 1913, with the help of Charles Dullin in whose Montmartre apartment the auditions took place, Copeau started to assemble a company. Besides Dullin and Louis Jouvet, whom he took on principally as stage manager, he hired, among others, Roger Karl and Suzanne Bing.

During the summer of 1913, Copeau took his troupe to &quot;Le Limon&quot;, his country house in the Marne valley. The return of the troupe to Paris at the beginning of September, coincided with the publication in the NRF of Copeau&#x27;s &quot;Un essai de rénovation Dramatique: le théâtre du Vieux-Colombier&quot; (&quot;Essay on Dramatic Renewal: The Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier&quot;), in which he set forth the principles of this project: first, the choice of place far from the despised Right Bank boulevard in a district closer to schools and the center of artistic life where the new theatre might attract an audience of students, intellectuals and artists with a subscription system that would assure reasonable prices; second, a variety of productions—as many as three different productions a week, which would not only appeal to a wider public, but would offer the actors the opportunity to play several different sorts of roles in quick succession, maintaining the suppleness of their interpretive skills; third, a repertoire both classic and modern would mark the offerings of the company: the classic plays of Jean Racine and Molière—never put in modern dress to keep them à la mode—and the best plays of the previous thirty years. Copeau wanted to entice new playwrights, perhaps those who had despaired that the theatre would ever present works of quality. And, fourth, he held in disdain ham acting or &quot;cabotinage&quot;, so common in the commercial theatre.

He proposed eventually a school for young actors in order to create a new cohort of actors whose taste and instincts would remain above compromise. Lastly, he proposed a simple stage freed from the overworked scenic machinery that had become commonplace: &quot;Pour l&#x27;œuvre nouvelle, qu&#x27;on nous laisse un plateau nu&quot; (&quot;For our new undertaking, just give us a bare platform&quot;), he wrote (&quot;Registres I&quot;, p. 32).

At the beginning of October, there appeared on the kiosks of Paris a poster announcing Copeau&#x27;s appeal to the youth to reject the commercial theatre, to a literate public who wanted to see preserved the classic master pieces of both the French and foreign theatre and to all those who wanted to support a theatre that would excel through its fair prices, variety, and quality of its interpretations and staging. Many years of hard work preceded his &quot;Appel&quot;, but the &quot;Old Dove-cote&quot; theatre was now ready to open.

During the first season, Copeau kept his promises. He staged plays from the classics, fairly recent works of quality, and the offerings of new playwrights from outside the theatre such as Jean Schlumberger and Roger Martin du Gard. The Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier was inaugurated with a little ceremony on 22 October 1913 and opened with its first public performance on the next evening with Heywood&#x27;s &quot;A Woman Killed By Kindness&quot; &quot;(&quot;Une femme tuée par la douceur&quot;)&quot;, but the Elizabethan melodrama did not impress the critics and the public remained indifferent. Molière&#x27;s &quot;Amour médecin&quot;, however, received a more promising reception. The Schlumberger offering, &quot;Les Fils Louverné&quot; (&quot;The Louverné Sons&quot;), a rather austere drama about sibling conflict, was followed by Alfred de Musset&#x27;s &quot;Barberine&quot;, a delightfully poetic piece that charmed the public and showed off the talents of the young company on a bare stage. Dullin triumphed in his signature interpretation of Harpagon in Molière&#x27;s &quot;L’Avare&quot; (&quot;The Miser&quot;) and the troupe showed its physical dexterity in Molière&#x27;s farce, &quot;La Jalousie du Barbouillé&quot; (&quot;The Jealousy of Barbouillé&quot;).

They performed Paul Claudel&#x27;s &quot;L’Échange&quot; (&quot;The Exchange&quot;); dating from 1894 when he was in &quot;exile&quot; as a diplomat in Boston, the play deals with the relationship between spouses. A popular revival of the Copeau-Croué adaptation of &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; saw Dullin once again as Smerdiakov, Jouvet as Feodor, and Copeau as Ivan. In May, the troupe, exhausted but buoyed by its artistic and sometimes critical successes, staged an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; or &quot;Nuit des rois&quot; to close the season.

Both in its preparation and &quot;mise-en-scène&quot;, &quot;Nuit des rois&quot; has entered into legend. Stories abound of Copeau and Jouvet working forty-eight hours non-stop to set the lighting and of Duncan Grant, the English artist who created the costumes, chasing after actors to apply one last dab of color just before the curtain was to come up. The play garnered both critical and public acclaim. With Jouvet as Sir Andrew Aguecheek, Suzanne Bing as Viola, Blanche Albane as Olivia, and Romain Bouquet as Sir Toby Belch, in a startlingly simple stage setting, the play called upon the audience&#x27;s imagination in a way that had not been seen on a Paris stage since Paul Fort, an earlier reformer who had worked in the theatre in the 1890s. Enthusiastic crowds finally queued up to see this rendition of &quot;real Shakespeare&quot; (Kurtz, pg. 31), but the run closed as scheduled for the troupe was off to Alsace on tour.

==During World War I==

Planning for the next season began in earnest, but August 1914 brought the outbreak of the First World War. With the men of the troupe called up for duty, including Copeau, there remained no choice but to close the theatre. Remanded to Paris, he kept a thriving correspondence with Jouvet and Dullin about the theatre. With Jouvet, he pondered the various possibilities of stagecraft and how the stage at the Vieux-Colombier could be shaped to fit their ideas about a &quot;nouvelle comédie&quot;—a new comedy reminiscent of the Italian commedia dell&#x27;arte. From their discussion came the concept of the &quot;loggia&quot; or a unit set that would be developed and used during the New York years and at the Vieux-Colombier in Paris after the war.

At first, Copeau busied himself with an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; along with Suzanne Bing while news from the front worsened. A telegram in August 1915 from Edward Gordon Craig inviting him to Florence to discuss a possible staging of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Passion According to Saint Matthew&quot; was greeted with enthusiasm. A month in Florence discussing with Craig, himself an important reformer of the theatre, helped put many of his own ideas in perspective for Copeau and Craig did not always agree on the means to reach their goal of a theatre renewed.

Before the war Craig had founded a school at the Arena Goldoni where his students studied acting and stagecraft. For Craig any reform of the theatre had to begin with the training of the actor but he did not believe, as did Copeau, that it was possible. His idea of the &quot;übermarionnette&quot;, the super-marionnette, to replace the human actor completely was a product of the lack of faith in the possibility of educating the actor.

On his return trip to Paris, Copeau stopped in Geneva for further discussions on the theatre with the scene designer Adolphe Appia and with Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, the musician and founder of the &quot;Institut de gymnastique rhythmique&quot; (&quot;The Institute of Eurhythmics&quot;). After having observed several of Jaques-Dalcroze&#x27;s classes, he saw in Dalcroze&#x27;s methods useful means for training young actors in movement. Upon his return to Paris he and Bing immediately went about setting up training sessions for youngsters using Dalcroze&#x27;s methods. They soon realized from these initial efforts that the method indeed had a lot to offer, but that they also had much to learn.

In the summer of 1916, Copeau received an invitation to organize a tour with the Vieux-Colombier in America, supposedly to counteract the influence of the German theatre in New York City, but also as a propaganda move to continue American support of the French cause. He immediately saw this as an opportunity to bring back his actors from the front and to reconstitute his theatre, but also as a means of shoring up the weak finances of the Vieux-Colombier. But his efforts to free his actors from military duty proved futile and so he left alone in January 1917 for a lecture tour in the United States.

==In New York==

Several laudatory articles in the New York press preceded his arrival. In the &quot;New York Times&quot; for example, an article by Henri-Pierre Roche carried the title: &quot;Arch-Rebel of the French Theatre Coming Here.&quot; Copeau&#x27;s presence in New York City attracted the attention of many, but none more influential in regard to his goals than Otto H. Kahn, the philanthropist and patron of the arts. Kahn invited Copeau to dinner at his mansion on East 68th Street and then from the table to the theatre to see George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Getting Married&quot;.

The next day Copeau accompanied Mrs. Kahn to the Metropolitan Museum. Sufficiently impressed by what he learned from Copeau and from others, on 19 February Kahn offered to Copeau the directorship of what was known as the Théâtre Français, the French-language theatre that had been languishing under the directorship of Etienne Bonheur. He offered to Copeau the Bijou Theatre, a new house that opened in April 1917.

Copeau chose rather an older theatre, the Garrick Theatre on West 35th Street which housed the Théâtre Français, because he felt that with the proper renovations, among other considerations, it would better suit the unit set he had conceived with Jouvet. For the renovations, he hired a young Czech architect, Antonin Raymond, whose modernist concepts coincided well with his ideas of stagecraft. From March through April he delivered some dozen lectures on topics such as &quot;Dramatic Art and the theatre Industry&quot;, &quot;The Renewal of Stagecraft&quot;, and &quot;The Spirit in the Little Theatres&quot;.

When the inauguration of the Théâtre Français de New York took place at the Metropolitan Opera on 17 May 1917, Copeau had negotiated a generous contract with Otto Kahn and the board of directors and was ready to return to Paris with a letter of credit for $18,000 to cover the costs of preparation for the season in New York City.

The summer in Paris proved to be a busy one: the repertoire for the coming season needed to be chosen; costumes, assembled; and his troupe, reconstituted. The latter proved a daunting task. Jouvet was finally given leave from his duties at the Front, but the authorities refused to release Dullin. Jouvet constructed a model set, given the dimensions of the stage area at the Garrick while in New York the young Antonin Raymond battled with the Shubert brothers and their architect over the renovations to the theatre.

With the intervention of Kahn, who footed the bill, and Mrs. Philip Lydig, who was overlooking many of the decorative details of the hall itself, the old Garrick finally started to take shape. Jouvet, who knew that the design of the stage was essential to the success of the repertory that Copeau projected, left France in early October to oversee the final preparations of the stage. When the troupe arrived in New York on 11 November 1917, all was not ready for the season. Renovations on the stage remained unfinished, the subscriptions for the season were not quite as substantial as initially reported, and housing for the actors was not available as projected and they were put up in hotels.

On 26 November 1917, the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier de New York opened its season on the stage of the renovated Garrick Theatre with an &quot;Impromptu du Vieux-Colombier&quot;, a piece written especially for the occasion by Copeau, and Molière&#x27;s &quot;Les Fourberies de Scapin&quot; (&quot;Scapin&#x27;s Pranks&quot;). In the center of the stage stood the bare platform Copeau had asked for in his &quot;Appel&quot;, which allowed the actors to wander about the stage until they were needed in a particular scene. The freedom of movement did not go unnoticed by the critics, as John Corbin of the New York Times remarked: &quot;it renders possible many combinations and groupings, all sorts of telling encounters.&quot;

During the first season, Vieux-Colombier in New York staged twenty-one different plays. Among them were ten plays from the first season in Paris but with a different casts since not all the original members of the troupe came to New York: Molière&#x27;s &quot;La Jalousie du Barbouillé&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Avare&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Amour médecin&quot;, Musset&#x27;s &quot;Barberine&quot;, the Copeau/Croué adaptation of Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, and &quot;Nuit des rois&quot;, the adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; shared the stage with &quot;Le Carrosse du Saint-Sacrement&quot; (&quot;The Carriage of the Holy Sacrament&quot;) of Prosper Mérimée, &quot;La Surprise de l&#x27;Amour&quot; (&quot;Love&#x27;s Surprise&quot;) of Musset, and &quot;Poil de Carotte&quot; (&quot;Carrot Head&quot;) of Jules Renard.

As during the first season, a mixture of both classic and modern plays, some by living authors, served as the basis of the repertoire. At the close of the New York season, Copeau took his troupe to Washington, D.C. and to the Little Theatre in Philadelphia where they presented ten different plays. In early May, they performed &quot;L&#x27;Avare&quot; at Vassar College to close their season.

Certain offerings of the Vieux-Colombier received critical and popular acclaim. To no one&#x27;s surprise &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, with Dullin, who finally arrived in New York in March 1918, in the role of Smerdiakov and later in his well-received role as Harpagon, the miser, counted among the successes. &quot;Nuit des rois&quot; also burnished the company&#x27;s reputation. Some plays, such as Octave Mirbeau&#x27;s &quot;Les Mauvais Bergers&quot; (&quot;The Evil Shepherds&quot;), ended with an almost empty house as the audience stalked to the exits during the play before the final curtain.

On 20 May, the entire troupe wended its way to the palatial estate of Otto Kahn in Morristown, New Jersey where they were to prepare the 1918–19 season of twenty-nine plays of which twenty-six would be new plays. Copeau, the taskmaster, established a rigorous regimen of rehearsals and exercises starting early in the morning and ending late in the day before dinner. The fatigue from the exertions of the first season, the hot summer, the rationed food, now that the United States was part of the war effort, took their toll on the spirits of these French actors and actresses. A bout of typhoid fever among the Copeau and Jouvet children and fear of the Spanish influenza added to the consternation.

The second season opened with a piece by Henri Bernstein, &quot;Le Secret&quot;, which had already played on Broadway. But Copeau was made aware that he needed to bow somewhat to popular taste if the Vieux-Colombier was to succeed financially. The second offering of the season—Pierre Beaumarchais&#x27;s &quot;Le Mariage de Figaro&quot;—proved to be both a critical and popular success and maintained Copeau&#x27;s standards. Among the other successes was Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Rosmersholm&quot; in a translation by Agnès Thomsen Copeau with Dullin as Rosmer and Copeau in the role of Kroll.

Copeau considered the aesthetic highlight of the season Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, principally because of the way the unit set with subtle lighting and the judicious use of banners on its several levels allowed an uninterrupted flow of action in this major work of the Symbolist movement. The dispute between Copeau and several members of the company, including Dullin, led to their dismissal by the end of January. The season ended with an &quot;Impromptu&quot;, during which all the members of the troupe who remained played short scenes representing their major portrayals. At the end of the presentation, all the costumes were placed in the wicker baskets marked with the two doves representing the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier.

Before Copeau returned to Europe, he must have been buoyed by the positive reaction of the critics, some of whom did not always look kindly upon the Vieux-Colombier&#x27;s offerings. The critic of &quot;The Nation&quot; who had consistently praised Copeau&#x27;s efforts wrote: &quot;The Vieux-Colombier has not only afforded New York a continually varied feast of inspiration and refreshment but it has set for us a new and practicable standard by which American dramatic art may be tested&quot;.

==The Paris years: 1920–1924==

:&quot;The theatre and the School are one and the same thing.&quot;—Notebook of Suzanne Bing
Upon his return to Paris, Copeau needed a period of rest and reflection, but certain pressing tasks demanded his time. He finished the adaptation of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, which would be the first offering when the theatre reopened in January 1920, and with Jouvet he oversaw the renovations to the stage and the lighting at the Vieux-Colombier. A unit set compatible with the dimensions of the stage area and the installation of an innovative lighting system controlled from backstage—baptized jouvets—were installed. More important in the eyes of Copeau, a school of dramatic arts remained essential if he was to realize the renewal of the theatre that had been his dream for over a decade.

The theatre opened its doors on 9 February 1920 with &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; on the renovated stage. The almost bare stage and the gray walls in the background puzzled critics and the public alike. The next offerings, Charles Vildrac&#x27;s &quot;Le Paquebot Tenacity&quot; (&quot;The Steamboat Tenacity&quot;) and Prosper Mérimée&#x27;s &quot;Le Carrosse du Saint-Sacrement&quot; elicited both critical and popular favor. The story of two young men, Ségard and Bastien, waiting for the S.S. Tenacity with its love interest—Ségard runs off with a barmaid, Thérèse, to live out his life in France and its sense of both adventure and loss: Bastien leaves for Canada—was more readily acceptable.

By the end of the season, which ended with La Fontaine&#x27;s &quot;La Coupe Enchantée&quot; (&quot;The Enchanted Goblet&quot;), a holdover from New York, the company had also performed Georges Duhamel&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Oeuvre des athlètes&quot; (&quot;The Athlete&#x27;s Work&quot;&quot;), Jules Romains&#x27;s &quot;Cromedeyre-le-Vieil&quot;, and Emile Mazoud&#x27;s &quot;La Folle Journée&quot; (&quot;What a Crazy Day&quot;), works by contemporary writers newly initiated into the theatre. After two years in New York, this was a company of proven theatrical skills in plays from various eras and of diverse styles.

By the end of February auditions were being held for the &quot;Classes at the Vieux-Colombier&quot;, an undertaking Copeau asked Suzanne Bing to organize. Some of the students worked already for the Vieux-Colombier, others were students of actors at the Comédie-Française, but in all a rather mixed group with widely different backgrounds. The classes, which took place in a room in the courtyard behind the theatre, were devoted to close readings of texts with emphasis not only on the meaning but the rhythms as well as physical exercises and improvisations. The sessions ended in June with a &quot;charade&quot; presented before Copeau and a few friends of the Vieux-Colombier which &quot;le patron&quot; found quite satisfying (Registres VI, p. 225).

At the end of the shortened spring 1920 theatre season, the Vieux-Colombier, although an aesthetic success, found itself in debt. The theatre, now smaller because of the apron that extended from the stage, was barely economically viable. Copeau called upon the generosity of the Friends of the Vieux-Colombier who helped fill its coffers. The school, meanwhile, lacked sufficient space to expand its enrollment or its curriculum.

Despite efforts on the part of Jouvet during the summer, no suitable space was found. The school started up in December, using space on the second floor of the building that housed the theatre. Suzanne Bing was again in charge of the young people between the ages of fourteen and eighteen years old, and Copeau also offered a course of the &quot;History of the theatre.&quot; But this experiment was far from the elaborate program that Copeau had in mind.

The 1920/1921 season at the Vieux-Colombier began with popular re-runs from previous season, opening with Vildrac&#x27;s &quot;Le Paquebot Tenacity&quot; followed by &quot;Nuit des rois&quot;, which Parisians had not seen since the end of the first season in 1914. The highly demanding Vieux-Colombier audiences were happy to see fine performances of classics under the deft direction of Copeau. Critics, though, wondered when new plays would be on the bill. In January, Copeau staged Henri Ghéon&#x27;s &quot;Le Pauvre sous l&#x27;escalier&quot; (&quot;The Beggar under the Staircase&quot;), the story based on the medieval tale of the life of Saint Alexis. &quot;La Mort de Sparte&quot; (&quot;The Death of Sparta&quot;), a play by Copeau&#x27;s friend Jean Schlumberger dating from before the war, garnered neither critical nor popular praise.

The highlight of the 1921/1922 season was the opening the School of the Vieux-Colombier in a building on Rue du Cherche-Midi, around the corner from the theatre. Courses began in November under the directorship of Jules Romains, author and graduate of the École Normale Supérieure. Among the teaching staff were Copeau himself who would teach a course on the theory of the theatre and Greek tragedy, and Jouvet who taught a complementary course on the Greek theatre from the point of view of its architecture. Bing taught the beginning course on reading and diction and along with Copeau a course on the formation of the dramatic instinct. Copeau&#x27;s daughter Marie-Hélène was in charge of a workshop on the use of different materials, on geometric design, on costume design and production.

The fame of the Vieux-Colombier seemed to reach its apogee in the 1922–23 season. The house was filled for every performance and visitors to Paris complained of the impossibility of getting tickets to any of its offerings. Copeau organized a touring company to the provinces. Invitations to play in other countries in the off-season abounded. When Konstantin Stanislavski, the director of the Moscow Art Theatre, came to Paris in December 1922, he and his troupe were warmly received on the stage of the Vieux-Colombier. The influence of Copeau&#x27;s principles to which he held without flinching was felt throughout Europe and the United States. Despite the fame, conflict arose.

Jouvet, who understood the economics of the theatre better than Copeau, knew that a larger theatre and a more profitable pricing system were needed. His proposal fell on deaf ears. When he was asked to direct at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, he chose his freedom. Even Romains decided that the Right Bank theatres were more hospitable to his work after Copeau rejected one of his plays. Despite the problems at the theatre, the school continued to thrive. Copeau allowed his young charges to appear in a production of Gide&#x27;s &quot;Saül&quot; as the masked demons that taunt the king played by Copeau himself. The critical reaction was quite positive. The season ended, as the previous ones had, with the Vieux-Colombier in debt.

When the 1923/24 season opened, the Vieux-Colombier found itself in competition with former members of the company since Jouvet&#x27;s and Dullin&#x27;s theatre drew from the same public as Copeau. Its subscriber base reduced, the Vieux-Colombier no longer held the cherished spot in the heart of those theatregoers who sought quality in the theatre. For Copeau, two events marked the highpoints of the season: the staging of his long-awaited &quot;La Maison natale&quot;, a work that had its inception in various forms more than twenty years earlier, and the Noh play &quot;Kantan&quot; with the students of the school under the direction of Suzanne Bing.

Copeau&#x27;s piece dealt with the theme of an autocratic father whose two sons, Maxime and Pierre, have already left the nest to find happiness elsewhere. André, the youngest son, remains at home, but is encouraged by his grandfather to search for his happiness. When the father dies, André is confronted with the choice of running the family&#x27;s factory or self-fulfillment. Maxime returns, seeks forgiveness, and André, with his grandfather&#x27;s blessing, leaves the family home. The play, found to be lacking in dramatic action, was not greeted with great critical acclaim, much to Copeau&#x27;s chagrin. &quot;Kantan&quot;, on the other hand, represented for Copeau the culmination of two and a half years hard work with his apprentice actors and the fulfillment of a dream of over a decade.

The play never made it onto the boards of the Vieux-Colombier because Aman Maistre, one of the actors, sprained his knee, but Harley Granville-Barker and Adolphe Appia saw it in rehearsals. Barker, after having seen the play, was effusive in his praise for the effects of the training the students received at the Vieux-Colombier: &quot;If you were able to do that in three years, in ten years you could do anything at all.&quot; (Registres VI, p. 401) The play, performed with masked characters, allowed the young actors to show off to good effect their grace, athleticism and voice training.

At the end of the season, the troupe undertook a tour through eastern France, Belgium, and Switzerland. Then, Copeau made the momentous decision to abandon entirely the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier. Unable to make any concessions to the commercial aspects of the theatre, tired of looking to his friends for support, he felt he had no alternatives. Despite the offer of help from Jouvet to make the Vieux-Colombier both an artistic and financial success, Copeau chose his independence. By mid-summer, the Vieux-Colombier was liquidated. With some of his actors and young apprentices in tow, Copeau moved to the Burgundy countryside to begin a new project.

==The Burgundy adventure: the &quot;Copiaus&quot;==

:&quot;The word &quot;school&quot; is no longer valid from that time on.&quot;—Suzanne Bing (Registres VI, p. 416)
In October, 1924, Copeau and his company of young enthusiasts set up shop in what they called ironically the &quot;Château de Morteuil&quot; in a village some seven miles from Beaune. In effect Copeau at first tried to re-establish the school of the Vieux-Colombier in this new context. But, lacking funds, he needed to lecture frequently to pay expenses. He decided to mount two plays before a group of industrialists in Lille in January 1925 in order to secure financial backing for the troupe with a greatly reduced number of plays and a new plan of attack: &quot;four plays a year, eight months of preparation, four months of stagings, one month in Paris and three months in the provinces and abroad&quot; (Journal II, 219).

Copeau&#x27;s request for funds and the plays failed to garner the needed financial support and he continued his lectures both in France and Belgium. At this point both actors and apprentices were given their freedom to leave and, given his reduced financial status, he devised a new approach.

After the departure of some of the student actors and teachers, Copeau began work with his reduced troupe on the &quot;New Comedy&quot;, an attempt to reproduce the Italian commedia dell&#x27;arte with masks and an acting style based on improvisation. He composed a text, &quot;Le Veuf&quot; (&quot;The Widower&quot;), that the actors began to rehearse on a simple platform in the main hall at Morteuil. The residents of the surrounding villages, now accustomed to the fanciful lives of the actors, their costumes and their parading through their towns, baptized them &quot;les Copiaus&quot;.

Starting in May 1925, the Copiaus performed plays by Molière as well as those written expressly for them by Copeau, using masks of their own invention. Their presentations were preceded by a parade of the entire troupe, accompanied by drums, horns and colorful banners. They performed on a bare platform in village squares or whatever indoor space they could find. Copeau continued his work with this troupe as best he could, despite his heavy schedule of readings and lectures. But given their inventiveness and creativity, his control over the troupe lessened.

At the end of the year, the troupe moved to Pernand-Vergelesses, a village in the heart of the wine-producing region of Burgundy, where Copeau had purchased a house and property better suited to his family and the needs of the Copiaus. From this headquarters the Copiaus would take their increasingly sophisticated offerings to many of the little towns of Burgundy and abroad to Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and eventually to Italy. Copeau, too, continued his heavy schedule of dramatic readings to help support himself and the troupe. In November 1926, he left on a lecture tour in the United States where he was also to direct &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; in English for the Theatre Guild in January 1927.

In June 1929, the Copiaus formed a new troupe, &quot;La Compagnie des Quinze&quot;, led by Michel Saint-Denis. They returned to Paris where they performed &quot;Noé&quot; (&quot;Noah&quot;), a play by André Obey, under the direction of Michel St-Denis. From this point on, Copeau&#x27;s direct influence over what had once been the École du Vieux-Colombier ended, although his influence on a personal level would remain strong.

==Later life==

In 1933 Copeau mounted a production of &quot;The Mystery of Saint Uliva&quot;, in the cloister of the Santa Croce in Florence and in 1935 &quot;Savonarola&quot;, on the central square of Florence. In Paris, he directed an adaptation of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and Molière&#x27;s &quot;Le Misanthrope&quot; at the Comédie-Française in 1936. In 1937, again at the Comédie-Française, he directed Jean Racine&#x27;s &quot;Bajazet&quot;, followed in 1938 by &quot;Le Testement du Père Leleu&quot;, a reprise of Roger Martin du Gard&#x27;s play from the days of the Vieux-Colombier.

In 1940, Copeau was named Provisionary Administrator of the Comédie-Française, where he staged Pierre Corneilles &quot;Le Cid&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and Mérimée&#x27;s &quot;Le Carrosse du Saint-Sacrement&quot;. Unable to follow the orders of the German occupiers, he resigned his position in March 1941 and withdrew to his home in Pernand-Vergelesses. &quot;Le Miracle du pain doré&quot; (&quot;The Miracle of the Golden Bread&quot;), his own work, was staged at the Hospices de Beaune in 1943 and the following year, his play about Saint Francis of Assisi, &quot;Le Petit Pauvre&quot; (&quot;The Poor Little One&quot;) was published.

==Death==
Copeau died at the Hospices de Beaune on 20 October 1949. He and his wife are buried at the church graveyard in Pernand-Vergelesses.

<doc id="878033" wikidata="Q5139428" url="?curid=878033" title="Cochrane (surname)">
<text>Cochrane is a surname with multiple independent origins, two Scottish and one Irish. One of the Scottish names derives from a place in Scotland; the Irish surname and the other Scottish surname are both anglicisations of surnames from the Irish language and Scottish Gaelic respectively.

==History==
The name &quot;Cochrane&quot; originates from a habitational name derived from the &quot;Lowlands of Cochrane&quot;, near Paisley in Renfrewshire. The derivation of the place name is uncertain. One possibility is that it is derived from the Welsh &quot;coch&quot; meaning &quot;red&quot;; however this theory is not supported by the early spelling of the name &quot;Coueran&quot;. 
It is also possible the name is derived from the Welsh word &quot;cywrain&quot;, which means &quot;skilled&quot;. Early recorded bearers of the surname are Waldeve &quot;de Coueran&quot; in 1262; William &quot;de Coughran&quot; in 1296; and Robert &quot;de Cochrane&quot; in about 1360.

In Scotland during the 18th century, the surname was used as a Lowland adaptation of the Scottish Gaelic &quot;MacEachrain&quot;.

In Ireland the surname was adopted as an Anglicisation of the surnames &quot;Ó Cogaráin&quot; and &quot;Mac Cogaráin&quot;, meaning respectively the descendant or the son of Cogarán (probably a diminutive of &quot;cogar&quot; &quot;confidant&quot;).

==Demographics==

The surname is especially concentrated in England in the counties of Durham in the North of England and Kent in the south. In Scotland, Cochrane is found in high frequency in the counties of South Lanarkshire, West Lothian and in Renfrewshire. The surname is the 224th most common surname in Scotland, 957th most common in England and ranked in the top 100 surnames of a number of former British colonies. There are a number of spelling variations including Cochran, Cockren, and Coughran.

Together Scotland and England have the highest percentage of the Cochrane surname anywhere in the world. In Ireland, the surname Cochrane is especially concentrated in the northern province of Ulster where it was introduced by Protestant Scots settlers during the Plantation period of the 17th century. It was also adopted as an anglicisation by some Corcoran families.

In Northern Ireland, the surname Cochrane is concentrated in the counties of Antrim, Londonderry, Down and Tyrone. James Cochrane, an Ulsterman, was a 19th-century entrepreneur who helped the Irish whiskey Bushmills and the Old Bushmills Distillery gain worldwide popularity.

In the United States, Cochranes arrived amongst the Ulster-Scots immigrants to the British North American colonies of New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Many Cochranes lived in Winedham New Hampshire. They eventually moved to Boston, and now some of them live in Reston, Virginia. Some of the earliest Cochranes in the United States came from County Antrim, Northern Ireland, in the early 18th century after obtaining a land grant from the Governor of Massachusetts. Later Cochranes would arrive from Scotland and England.

<text>De&#x27;voreaux White (born Devorea W. Sefas; August 6, 1965) is an American actor. He started his career as a child actor in the late 1970s, and may be best known for his role in &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988) as the young limousine driver, Argyle.

==Career==
===Film and television===
De&#x27;voreaux White was born in Los Angeles County, California. He began acting professionally at the age of ten.

His first bookings were &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, and 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (as a would-be-shoplifter who is thwarted by a gun-toting Ray Charles). White also played one of the boys who attempt to keep a baseball in the Neil Simon movie &quot;Max Dugan Returns&quot;. In 1984, he played Wylie - who was lynched for accidentally shooting a white sheriff - in &quot;Places in the Heart&quot;. The movie received notice at the Academy Awards; White credits this role for providing an opportunity to read with producer Joel Silver and star Bruce Willis for &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988). White filmed his scenes with Willis over a period of three months; some of their dialogue was improvised on the set.

White also starred in the television series &quot;Head of the Class&quot; as Aristotle McKenzie, and co-starred as a suicidal misfit who befriends Rick Schroder in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Out on the Edge&quot;. In 1992, White played the role of Ice-T&#x27;s drug-addicted younger brother in Walter Hill&#x27;s &quot;Trespass&quot;. White appeared in the 2000 drama &quot;Shadow Hours&quot;.

White reprised his role as Argyle from &quot;Die Hard&quot;, with Willis, in a commercial for Advance Auto Parts&#x27; DieHard brand of car batteries in October 2020.

===Other work===
In 2019, White set up his own company in California. By then, he worked in the clinical staff of a substance-abuse rehabilitation facility.

==Personal life==
In 2019, White resided in Newport Beach, California. His original last name, Sefas, is Ethiopian; after his mother died, his maternal grandparents with the surname White adopted him.

The couple opposed the establishment of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant in Tamil Nadu. For his efforts to demilitarise and denuclearize South Asia, and his efforts to prevent the building of the Kudankulam reactor, Ramdas was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for peace in 2004.

Ramdas died on 15 March 2024, at the age of 90.

<text>Algorta is a locality within the municipality of Getxo, in the province of Biscay, Basque Country, Spain. In 1996, the population of Algorta was 35,600.

The Metro Plaza situated in Telletxe street is considered to be the center of town and commerce. The two most historically important plazas in town are St. Nicholas Plaza and St. Ignacius Plaza.

==Neighborhoods==

Sarrikobaso- This neighborhood has the highest population density in Algorta and takes its name from one of the streets where it is predominantly located. It has a metro station called &quot;Bidezabal&quot; as well as a health center.

La Humedad- The farthest neighborhood from the coast of Getxo, La Humedad is a quiet area. In it, one can find the Fadura Municipal Sport City. &#x27;Fadura&#x27; comes from the basque voice &#x27;padura&#x27; which means swamp. That swamp is located behind the Fadura Sport city and a few years ago it started being cared by cleaning programs.

Villamonte- It is a residential and quiet neighborhood and has a lot of parks and trees. Its name comes from the Spanish words villa=village and monte=mountain.

<text>Extensive stage, or by its full name, the &quot;predominantly extensive stage of accumulation&quot;, pertains to one of the periodizations of capitalism, as proposed by Aglietta (1976). It is the first stage of capitalism. It is also known as the early stage.

During the extensive stage, room exists for the growth of production and capitalist means of production, including wages and modes of labor. It is characterized by high rates of economic growth. When the extensive stage ends, it is followed by the intensive stage (intensive accumulation).

Karl Marx described this stage as exhibited in England as &quot;The so-called primitive accumulation&quot;.

<text>David John Munrow (12 August 194215 May 1976) was a British musician and early music historian.

== Early life and education ==

Munrow was born in Birmingham where both his parents taught at the University of Birmingham. His mother, Hilda Ivy (née Norman) Munrow (1905–1985), was a dance teacher and his father, Albert Davis &quot;Dave&quot; Munrow (1908–1975), was a lecturer and physical education instructor who wrote a book on the subject.

Munrow attended King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham until 1960. He excelled academically and was noted for his treble voice. He was lent a bassoon and returned it in about a fortnight, able to play it remarkably well.
In 1960, Munrow took a gap year and went to Peru to teach English at Markham College in Lima under the British Council student teacher scheme. He reached Lima by train from São Paulo and later spent some time touring Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and Chile, immersing himself in the traditional music of Latin America and collecting folk instruments. He returned to Britain with a number of Bolivian flutes and other obscure instruments.

While reading English for a master&#x27;s degree at Pembroke College, Cambridge, he became involved in musical performance, playing South American instruments in a students&#x27; autumn-term concert organised by Christopher Hogwood. A professor of music, Thurston Dart, was intrigued by Munrow&#x27;s performance and encouraged him to explore links between Latin American folk instruments and early European instruments. While visiting Dart&#x27;s study, Munrow noticed a crumhorn hanging on the wall; Dart suggested he borrow it and this inspired Munrow to commence an independent study of early musical instruments.

==Career==
Starting from his ability as a pianist, singer and bassoonist, Munrow began to acquire copies of medieval and renaissance instruments, together with folk instruments such as the Chinese shawm &#x27;suona&#x27; and Spanish bagpipes &#x27;gaita&#x27;. Whilst still an undergraduate he began to give lecture recitals, initially assisted by Mary Remnant. Later, he formed a trio with Christopher Hogwood and his future wife, Gillian Reid, and toured music clubs and music societies giving recitals featuring predominantly medieval and renaissance music, some of which was featured in the Oryx LP &#x27;The Mediaeval Sound&#x27;. He joined the Royal Shakespeare Company Windband as a bassoonist but soon played instruments of Shakespeare&#x27;s time under the encouragement of music director Guy Wolfenden. Although he displayed talent on a wide variety of instruments, he had a particular lasting influence as a recorder player. His English style of discreet and controlled expression contrasts with the greater tonal flexibility of the Continental style espoused by the Dutch recorder player Frans Brüggen and others.

By 1967 he was appointed a part-time lecturer in early music history at the University of Leicester, having married Gillian Veronica Reid the previous year. He also taught early woodwind instruments at King’s College London, where his mentor, Thurston Dart, had recently been appointed head of the new music department. With Christopher Hogwood he formed the Early Music Consort of London, whose core members were experts on their particular instruments. Sometimes other professional musicians were employed when necessary, such as Nigel North and Robert Spencer, both highly regarded lutenists. From 1968, he toured the world, unearthing obscure instruments in every country he visited. He commissioned reconstructions of instruments related to the cornett and rackett from, amongst others, Christopher Monk and Otto Steinkopf. Two television programmes made him a household name: &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; (1970) and &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; (1971). He also scored the feature film adaptation of the former, &quot;Henry VIII and His Six Wives&quot;, in 1972.

The early music revival was born following Munrow&#x27;s success with his soundtrack for &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot;, which contained authentic music played on original instruments, and generated worldwide enthusiasm for music and instruments from the renaissance period. Subsequently, demand for such historical instruments increased dramatically, resulting in Munrow&#x27;s encouragement for the formation of a business specialising in this area, which is still trading as The Early Music Shop, established in 1968 and now based in Saltaire, West Yorkshire. Munrow was a loyal and enthusiastic customer of the Early Music Shop, having helped the founder, Richard Wood, create the business&#x27;s name, and travelling immediately to the music store to be re-equipped with a variety of historical instruments after losing his entire collection in a theft.

Munrow&#x27;s two contributions to film music were for British directors: 
* Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Devils&quot; (1971). The film is set in the 17th century, and Munrow&#x27;s contribution included numbers from &quot;Terpsichore&quot;, Michael Praetorius&#x27;s collection of French dance music. It complemented an original score by Peter Maxwell Davies performed by the Fires of London.
*&quot;Zardoz&quot; (1974), written and directed by John Boorman. This included arrangements of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 7 for early music instruments.

During his relatively short life, Munrow released over 50 records, some of which are now available on CD. In addition to his recordings with The Early Music Consort of London, he recorded with Michael Morrow&#x27;s Musica Reservata, Alfred Deller and the King&#x27;s Singers. He recorded Bach and Monteverdi many times, but his widest influence was in the Medieval and Renaissance periods. His three-record set with The Early Music Consort of London, &quot;The Art of the Netherlands&quot;, issued in 1976 (EMI SLS5049), was particularly influential in popularising the genre.

On BBC Radio 3 he presented 655 editions of &quot;Pied Piper&quot;, a multi-ethnic and centuries-spanning spread of music from Monteverdi to the Electric Light Orchestra rock group. Munrow also had dealings notably with Pentangle, the Young Tradition and Shirley and Dolly Collins.

Apart from his regular radio slot and other programmes, he appeared on television, most notably on BBC 2 in a series entitled &quot;Ancestral Voices&quot; in a London studio, and on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Early Musical Instruments&quot;, filmed on location at Ordsall Hall in Salford. He also wrote one book entitled &quot;Instruments of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance&quot;. This originally accompanied a record set of the same name.

== Personal life ==
Munrow&#x27;s personal interests were travel, sailing, jazz and antiques, as revealed in his appearance on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. He was also a linguist. In addition, he wrote some articles on music, especially for his own recordings, most often for the OUP journal Early Music.

== Death ==
In 1976, Munrow hanged himself while in a state of depression; the recent deaths of his father and father-in-law, to whom he dedicated his sole book, are thought to have contributed to his decision to take his own life. He had, however, attempted suicide by drug overdose the previous year.

His death was widely seen as a tragic loss to the early music movement.

== Legacy ==
Munrow perhaps did more than anyone else in the second half of the 20th century to popularise early music in Britain, despite a career lasting barely 10 years. This was underscored when NASA&#x27;s Voyager space probe committee selected one of his Early Music Consort recordings for the Voyager Golden Record, a gold-plated copper record that was to be sent into space. &quot;The Fairie Round&quot; from &quot;Paueans, Galliards, Almains and Other Short Aeirs&quot; by Anthony Holborne was included among a compilation of sounds and images which had been chosen as examples of the diversity of life and culture on Earth. Two discs were launched into space in 1977, the year after Munrow&#x27;s death.

Munrow left behind him not only his recordings but a large collection of musical instruments. The Munrow Archive at the Royal Academy of Music holds a collection of his letters, papers, TV scripts, scores, musical compositions and books. The collection is accessible to the public. The online catalogue of the British Library Sound Archive reveals his many recording entries, and those of many other notable people.

Information about the life and work of David Munrow can be found in obituaries about him in 1976 (particularly the OUP journal &quot;Early Music&quot;), and in the following sources: a detailed piece in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; by Christopher Hogwood; The &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;; &quot;The Art of David Munrow&quot;, a record set with a biography by Arthur Johnson, the producer of &quot;Pied Piper&quot;; and on the old vinyl sleeve of the &quot;Renaissance Suite&quot;.

In 1957, the Gold Coast Colony, the Ashanti Colony, the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast Protectorate and the British Togoland Trust Territory, became an independent dominion within the British Commonwealth of Nations called Ghana. The Governor-General of Ghana served as the representative of the Queen of Ghana, whose formal title in Ghana was ‘Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Ghana and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth’. The entire dominion formed part of Her Majesty&#x27;s dominions until the country became a republic in 1960.

<text>Robert Alwin Schlumberger, Edler von Goldeck (12 September 1814 - 13 July 1879) was an entrepreneur and the first producer of sparkling wine () in Austria.

== Life ==
Schlumberger was born in Stuttgart in the German Kingdom of Württemberg. Upon the early death of his father, he began a commercial apprenticeship. As director of Ruinart, one of the leading champagne houses in Reims, France, he was experienced with the &quot;méthode champenoise&quot;. In 1841, on a boat trip he met his future wife Sophie Kirchner from Vienna, the daughter of a wealthy factory owner. He had the idea to produce champagne-like wine (&quot;Schaumwein&quot;) in Austria using the French method but Austrian grapes.

In 1842, Schlumberger founded his company renting several vineyards in Vöslau, a small Lower Austrian town south of Vienna situated in the present-day &quot;Thermenregion&quot; wine-growing area of the eastern Vienna Woods. His alliance which Sophie Kirchner, whom he married in the following year, helped him finance his business venture. Schlumberger presented his first sparkling wine in 1846 under the name &quot;Vöslauer weißer Schaumwein&quot; (White sparkling wine of Vöslau), from 1859 under &quot;Vöslauer Goldeck&quot;, the first protected wine trademark in Austria. It was produced from red Blauer Portugieser grapes growing in the Goldeck vineyards in Vöslau, which Schlumberger bought in 1843, and the sparkling wine was an immediate success.

Schlumberger wines were on board of the SMS Novara on its around-the-world mission 1857-1859. The company opened branch stores in Berlin and after the 1862 International Exhibition also in London, where the wine was sold under the brand name &quot;Vöslauer Sparkling&quot;. Robert Schlumberger also served as Vöslau mayor from 1864 to 1870. In 1878, one year before his death, he was ennobled by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria as &quot;Edler von Goldeck&quot;. He died in Vöslau, aged 64.
== Schlumberger Sekt company ==
Schlumberger&#x27;s son and heir Otto received the title of a &quot;K.u.k. Hoflieferant&quot; in 1895. The company survived the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in 1918 and up to today, Schlumberger Wein- und Sektkellerei GmbH with its seat at Vienna-Döbling is one of the leading producers of sparkling wine in Austria. In 1973, it was taken over by the German Underberg company.

Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson (1832–1910) in a letter to his daughter Bergliot from Schwaz in Tyrol, 29 May 1894: Vöslauer wine is also mentioned by John Galsworthy (1867–1933) in his 1926 play &quot;Escape&quot; as well as in the 1957 volume of novellas &quot;Fin de siècle&quot; by Paul Morand (1888–1976).

<doc id="878105" wikidata="Q2893596" url="?curid=878105" title="October 2000 protests in Israel">
<text>The October 2000 protests, also known as October 2000 events, were a series of protests in Arab villages in northern Israel in October 2000 that turned violent, escalating into rioting by Israeli Arabs, which led to counter-rioting by Israeli Jews and clashes with the Israel Police and ending in the deaths of 13 Arab demonstrators and 1 Israeli Jew.

The Or Commission was established to investigate the police response to the rioting. Israeli media outlets refer to the episode as &quot;אירועי אוקטובר 2000&quot; - the &quot;October 2000 events&quot; while the Arab community refers to it as the &quot;October ignition&quot; ().

==Background==
In September 2000, tensions between the police and Israel&#x27;s Arab citizens rose. On 12 September, Israel Police Northern District Commander Alik Ron requested an investigation of Hadash MK Mohammad Barakeh for inciting violence against police. At a meeting of the High Follow-up Committee for Arab citizens in Israel the next day in Kafar Manda, United Arab List&#x27;s MK Abdulmalik Dehamshe declared: &quot;We will beat or forcefully attack any policeman and we will break his hands if he comes to demolish an Arab house … we are on the verge of an Intifada among Israel&#x27;s Arabs following Alik Ron&#x27;s incitement.&quot;

On 14 September, Nazareth declared a general strike protesting &quot;police incompetence in handling violence and crime&quot; after the murder of a local resident, Nabieh Nussier, 52. On 30 September, the High Follow-up Committee called on the Arab community to mount a general strike to protest the killings of five Palestinians by Israeli police in the Jerusalem clashes of the previous day, which many consider the first day of the Second Intifada.

Demonstrations in Arab towns in northern Israel began to spread after repeated airings of news footage showing the alleged shooting death of 12-year-old Muhammad al-Durrah, who was said to have been caught in the crossfire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militia.

==Timeline==

=== 1 October ===
Arab demonstrations and acts of civil-disobedience in solidarity with the Palestinians turned violent following the proclamation of a general strike by the Arab Higher Monitoring Committee to protest the deaths of Arab rioters in Jerusalem the previous day. Arab rioting took place throughout northern Israel. Violence occurred in Umm al-Fahm, Nazareth, Acre, Fureidis, and villages throughout the Galilee. In a number of areas police came under gunfire, and demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails. An Egged bus was torched in Umm al-Fahm.

Israel Police officers and Border Police gendarmes responded with live ammunition, tear gas, and rubber bullets. At the entrance to Umm al-Fahm, police used sniper rifles to prevent the Wadi Ara road from being blocked. Israeli-Arabs Muhammad Ahmad &#x27;Eiq Al-Jabarin and Ibrahim Sayyam Al-Jabarin and Gaza resident Misleh Abu Jarad were killed. About 75 people, including Umm al-Fahm mayor Raed Salah, were wounded.

=== 2 October ===
Police dispersed an Arab demonstration in Arraba with tear gas and live ammunition. Alaa Nassar, 18, and Asel Asleh, 17, were killed.

Demonstrators in Nazareth threw stones, burned tires, looted and burned shops. 100 demonstrators were hurt, including one woman who was seriously injured. Dozens of residents of Mashhad approaching a Jewish neighbourhood of Nazareth Illit and smashed house and car windows.

Traffic was blocked with burning tires on Route 65, a main artery connecting northern and central Israel. A Jewish man was attacked and pulled from his car by local youth, which they then torched. Three banks in Baqa al-Gharbiyye were set on fire.

=== 3 October ===
Ramez Bushnak, 24, from Kafr Manda, was shot in the head and died the same day during a confrontation with police, who explicitly denied claims that he was shot from close range. Dozens of residents clashed with police blocking the way to Jewish neighbourhoods in Misgav. The funerals of those killed in previous days became focal points of renewed clashes.

Extensive forest fires which Israel Police believed were the result of Arab arsonists caused the evacuations of some residents.

=== 4–6 October ===
Following the meeting between Barak and the Arab Higher Monitoring Committee, a general calm reigned with only minimal violence, including on 6 October, on which a &quot;Palestinian day of rage&quot; had been announced by Hamas. On 4 October, hundreds of Arab residents of Jaffa burned tires, threw rocks, and beat some reporters.

On 6 October mourners in Kafr Kanna at a funeral of one of those killed in clashes stoned and moderately injured a Jewish motorist from Tiberias. The next day, hundreds of Jewish youth in Tiberias burned tires, attacked a mosque, and attempted to assault Arabs. Dozens of haredi youth stoned Arab traffic in Jerusalem and attacked Palestinian labourers, who were subsequently rescued by police.

=== 7 October ===
Jewish and Arab youth threw rocks at each other near a shopping mall on the border between Jewish and Arab neighbourhoods in Nazareth. Arab traffic in Nazareth Illit was stoned. In Tiberias, mosques, Arab passersby businesses all suffered damages, and the attacks were repeated two days later. A gas station at the Golani Junction was torched, and police attempting to stop the attacks there on Arabs were themselves attacked.

A Jewish citizen, Bachor Jann, from Rishon LeZion, was killed after being hit by a stone thought to have been thrown by those taking part in the protests in Jisr az-Zarqa while driving on the Haifa-Tel Aviv freeway. A scuffle at an Or Akiva shopping mall between Jewish and Arab citizens resulted in an attack on the responding police and the throwing of a Molotov cocktail.

=== 8 October ===
Jews from Nazareth Illit, including apparently many Russian-speakers, attacked Arabs and their homes and businesses in Nazareth on the eve of Yom Kippur. Police, informed of the intention to attack Arabs, beefed up their forces and deployed them on the seam line between the two communities. When hundreds of Jewish youths from Nazareth Illit came down to throw stones and vandalize Arab properties, however, the police did not impede them. The Arab residents emerged from their homes to defend them, and reciprocal stone throwing clashes ensued. Police dispersed the riots with tear gas and live ammunition. Two Arabs, Omar Akawi and Wissam Yazbek, were shot dead, the latter by a gunshot wound to the head, fired by a policeman from behind him. The shooters were never identified.

Three Arab-owned apartments were torched in Tel Aviv, and hundreds clashed with police. Demonstrators chased two Arab employees out of a restaurant and set fire to it which damaged two Arab-owned cars parked in front.

=== 9 October ===
Hundreds of Jews rioted in Nazareth, breaking windows in a shopping mall and torching two cars. The mayor of Karmiel was attacked when he tried to calm Jewish citizens there. Arab property in Bat Yam and Petah Tikva was vandalized.

A large police force was required to thwart hundreds of demonstrators in Tel Aviv&#x27;s Hatikva Quarter and in Bat Yam from attacking Jaffa.
In Afula, roughly 700 Jewish demonstrators blocked Route 65 with boulders, and assaulted a policeman. 100 of the protestors broke off and tried to enter the Arab village of Nein, until police thwarted them.

In Acre, hundreds of Jewish rioters vandalized Arab shops and cars owned by Arabs.

The newspaper Al-Ittihad reported that four men stabbed an Arab worker on his way to work at a supermarket in Rosh HaAyin. In Jaffa, a mosque was torched as police looked on. Attempts were made to burn Jewish apartments and two synagogues. In Ramla, a synagogue was torched and traffic was stoned and firebombed. In Lod, a Jewish citizen was shot, a school was burned down, and attempts were made to torch a police station.

In Nazareth, a crowd of mourners from the funerals of the two demonstrators killed a day earlier approached the police station and threw rocks and firebombs at it, despite the police&#x27;s decision to keep all officers inside and out of sight until quiet set in. The police responded with tear-gas; when the stone-throwing continued, the assistant-mayor and two Arab Knesset members on the scene guaranteed a cessation in exchange for a police retreat, which they did. Arab youths also vandalized traffic signals at the Canyon Junction.

In Migdal HaEmek, Jewish residents blocked the main road and stoned cars believed to be owned by Arabs. A number of stoners were detained, and teenagers marched on the police station insisting on their release, with rocks being thrown at police, resulting in one being wounded.

Several hundred youth from Umm al-Fahm stoned dozens of passing vehicles on Highway 65 and vandalized utility poles. The assistant mayor unsuccessfully attempted to stop the youths per agreements with police to avoid their involvement. The police still decided to keep distance, and the Umm-al-Fahm municipality finally cleared debris from the road allowing it to be reopened.

=== 10 October ===
11 Arab businesses inside Acre&#x27;s historic old quarter were vandalized.

According to the Arab media organization &quot;I&#x27;lam&quot; the media coverage of the events of October 2000 created an atmosphere of war inside Israel, painting Arab citizens as violent rioters displaying their disloyalty to the State through riots; I&#x27;lam and other Arab organizations say that overall Arab citizens engaged in peaceful protest during October 2000, and that the entire population was treated in blanket fashion as a rioting &#x27;fifth column.&#x27;

The &quot;Arab Association for Human Rights,&quot; &quot;Adalah,&quot; &quot;Mossawa&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;lam,&quot; and other Arab NGOs in Israel cited &quot;deep rooted frustration [of Arabs] at their own status as second class Israeli citizens&quot;, as an underlying factor. The Arab youth organization &quot;Baladna&quot; was formed partially in response to the events of October 2000. According to Marwan Dwairy, the events of October 2000 are &quot;an important landmark in the narrative of the Arab Palestinian citizens of Israel.&quot;

The Or commission report, which was established to investigate the events of October 2000, found a pattern of government &quot;prejudice and neglect&quot; towards the Arab-Israeli minority. The commission stated that Israeli establishment insensitivity had allowed widespread discrimination against Arab Israelis leading to the &quot;combustible atmosphere&quot; that led to the riots. The commission was critical of the police&#x27;s use of excessive force to quell the riots including the use of sniper fire to disperse crowds. In conclusion the commission said that Israel &quot;must educate its police that the Arab public is not the enemy, and should not be treated as such.&quot;

In 2005, the Israel Police Internal Investigations Department decided not to indict any officers involved in the events. The decision was supported by the Israeli State Prosecutor&#x27;s Office. In 2008, following a review of the case by Israeli Attorney General Menachem Mazuz and Police Internal Investigations Department Chief Herzl Shviro, Mazuz accepted the State Prosecutor&#x27;s Office recommendation and decided not to press charges against any police officers and close the case, declaring that a re-examination of the gathered in the Or Commission and Police Internal Investigations Department&#x27;s report found no evidence of criminal conduct by police.

<text>The Cedar Rapids RoughRiders are a Tier I junior ice hockey team playing in the United States Hockey League (USHL). Before moving to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1999, the team was based in Mason City, where they were known as the North Iowa Huskies.

The RoughRiders&#x27; home ice is the ImOn Ice Arena also known as The Stable.

==History==

The North Iowa Huskies relocated to Cedar Rapids in 1999. The RoughRiders&#x27; new name was chosen in a name-the-team contest won by a local teacher at Roosevelt Middle School in Cedar Rapids as it was the school&#x27;s mascot.

In the 2002–03 season, the Roughriders finished in second place in the East Division with a 27–26–7 record. In the quarterfinals of the playoffs, the Roughriders beat the Topeka ScareCrows 3-games-to-1 before being swept 3–0 by the Lincoln Stars. After another second place division finish in 2003–04, the Roughriders lost in the quarterfinals to the Danville Wings.

In the 2004–05 season, the Roughriders finished first in the East Division with a record of 42 wins, 13 losses, and 5 overtime losses, for 89 points in the standings. They tied the West Division champions Omaha Lancers for the regular season overall title, the Anderson Cup. After three-game sweeps against the Indiana Ice and Chicago Steel, the Roughriders faced the Sioux City Musketeers winning game one of the Clark Cup finals 5–0, but lost game two, 1–2. After splitting games in Sioux City, the Roughriders finally defeated the Musketeers at home 4–1, to win their first Clark Cup championship. Goaltender Alex Stalock took most valuable player honors for the series. Future NHL players who played on this championship team included: Teddy Purcell, Justin Abdelkader, Alec Martinez, and Alex Stalock. In postseason awards, Roughriders&#x27; coach Mark Carlson was named Coach of the Year, and two Roughriders were named to the All-USHL second team.

The following season, the Roughriders won the Eastern Division regular season top playoff position based on goal differential against the Des Moines Buccaneers when both compiled 33 wins, 21 losses, and 6 overtime losses. The Roughriders also won the Corridor Cup against the Waterloo Black Hawks. In the playoffs, the Roughriders won the division semifinals against the Indiana Ice, 3-games-to-2, before bowing to eventual Clark Cup champion Des Moines in a three-game sweep. Roughriders&#x27; player Chad Costello finished on top of the league scoring race with 76 points, and teammate Teddy Purcell finished on top of the assists list with 52.

The 2006–07 season had the Roughriders finish in second place in the East Division with a 37–18–5 record. They defeated the Ohio Junior Blue Jackets in a four-game sweep bin the first round but lost both their round-robin games and were eliminated from the playoffs. In 2007–08, the Roughriders finished in third place in the East Division with a 33–22–5 record and were led in net with Brady Hjelle. The Roughriders were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Waterloo Black Hawks three-games-to-none. The Roughriders would continue to lose in the first round of the playoffs over the next two seasons.

The Roughriders would again finish in first place in the Eastern Conference and capturing their second Anderson Cup during the 2010–11 season. In the playoffs, the Roughriders beat Muskegon in the quarterfinals 3-games-to-1, but lost in the conference semifinals to Green Bay in four games.

After the 2012–13 season, the Roughriders failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since their inaugural 1999–2000 season in Cedar Rapids. They finished in sixth place in the East Division with a 25–30–9 record for a total of 59 points. The Roughriders would bounce back, finishing in second place in the Eastern Conference in both the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons. However, they lost in the first round in the playoffs against the Dubuque Fighting Saints both seasons.

In the 2015–16 season, the Roughriders finished in first place in the league with a 40–15–5 record for a total of 85 points and capturing the franchise&#x27;s third Anderson Cup. The Roughriders continued to struggle in the playoffs and lost to the Bloomington Thunder three-games-to-two in the first round. The Roughriders failed to qualify in the following 2016–17 season after a last place finish in the Eastern Conference.

In 2020 and the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic that curtailed the 2019–20 USHL season, the RoughRiders&#x27; home arena was damaged during the August 10 derecho, forcing the team to suspend operations for at least the 2020–21 season.

<text>Northumberland Ferries Limited (NFL) is a ferry company operating in eastern Canada and headquartered in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. NFL is also the owner of subsidiary Bay Ferries Limited (which used to include the Bay Ferries Great Lakes brand) through its holding company.

==Wood Islands–Caribou Ferry==
NFL has operated the ferry service that carries the Trans-Canada Highway across the eastern part of the Northumberland Strait between Wood Islands, Prince Edward Island and Caribou, Nova Scotia since it was established in 1941 by the Government of Canada. This service is seasonal and only operates between the months of May and December on account of heavy sea ice and the lack of icebreaking ferries. NFL also operates the ferry terminals in Wood Islands and Caribou, both of which are owned by the Government of Canada.

Until 2022, NFL operated two vessels owned by the Government of Canada: &quot;MV Confederation&quot;, built in 1993, and &quot;MV Holiday Island&quot;, built in 1971. On July 22, 2022, &quot;Holiday Island&quot; suffered a fire, causing ferry crossings to be cancelled. The &quot;MV Saaremaa 1&quot; was loaned by the Société des traversiers du Québec as a temporary replacement, and began operations on August 20, 2022. While &quot;Confederation&quot; has been operated exclusively by NFL since she was built, &quot;Holiday Island&quot; joined NFL in 1997 after being declared surplus by previous operator Marine Atlantic (who operated the vessel between Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick and Borden-Carleton, Prince Edward Island) upon completion of the Confederation Bridge. Following the 2022 fire, &quot;Holiday Island&quot; was declared by Transport Canada to be beyond repair and would be scrapped. The Federal Government purchased the Norwegian ferry &quot;MV Fanafjord&quot; (built 2008) in 2023, and in 2028 a brand new ferry is expected to be delivered. The replacement ferry arrived in Pictou, Nova Scotia on January 26, 2025 and now bears the name MV Northumberland.

Fares are paid only when exiting Prince Edward Island. The other major crossing of the Northumberland Strait, the Confederation Bridge from Prince Edward Island to New Brunswick, does likewise. Therefore, travellers entering the island on the ferry and exiting on the bridge or &quot;vice versa&quot; only need pay for one of the links.

The route has long been subsidized by Transport Canada; under the Ferry Services Contribution Program, the subsidy was most recently extended to 2027.
== Terminals ==

=== Caribou ===
This terminal serves Nova Scotia, and is located at the North end of Highway 106, a spur route of the Trans-Canada Highway. The terminal was constructed following the formation of Northumberland Ferries in 1941, and has received numerous upgrades since its construction. At the time of opening, the ferry was only accessible via Three Brooks Road. During the Canada-wide construction of the Trans-Canada Highway in the 1960s, Highway 106 was built providing the service with direct access to the national highway network. At this time, the terminal was expanded to handle more vehicle traffic due to the opening of the highway. A new terminal building was constructed in the early 1970s, and is still used today. The terminal also received a major upgrade including new docking infrastructure, terminal renovations, vehicle lanes and parking prior to the 1993 introduction of the high capacity &quot;MV Confederation&quot;, which is significantly larger than the other ferries running at the time.
=== Wood Islands ===
This terminal serves Prince Edward Island, and is located at the east end of Route 1, the Trans Canada Highway, and is adjacent to Wood Islands Provincial Park. Like the Caribou terminal, it was constructed following the formation of Northumberland ferries in 1941. During the early 1990s, the terminal received a major upgrade, including a completely new terminal building and docking infrastructure to accommodate &quot;MV Confederation&quot;. The terminal building received renovations in 2017 which saw the interior modernized, and includes televisions and new seating areas. The previous terminal still stands today, located on the opposite side of the vehicle lanes from the current terminal, and is used for storage.

<doc id="878123" wikidata="Q3130291" url="?curid=878123" title="Henman Hill">
<text>Aorangi Terrace, commonly known as &quot;Henman Hill&quot;, alongside a series of other nicknames, is a mostly grassed banked area in the grounds of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club where, during the annual Wimbledon tennis championships, crowds of people without show court tickets can watch the tennis matches live on a giant television screen at the side of No. 1 Court.

During television broadcasts of matches, cameras often sweep over the area, and sports journalists frequently conduct vox pops and interviews with members of the crowd. The terrace is also the main site for spectators to eat picnics.

Aorangi Terrace&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Henman Hill&quot; emerged in the late 1990s when British supporters would congregate to watch the matches of Tim Henman at the site. The hill is frequently given other alliterative nicknames relating to British players competing at Wimbledon (&quot;Rusedski Ridge&quot;, &quot;Murray Mound&quot;,&#x27; &quot;Heather Hill&quot;, &quot;Robson Green&quot;, &quot;Konta Contour&quot;, &quot;Raducanu Rise&quot;, &quot;Raducanu Ridge&quot;, &quot;Norrie Knoll&quot; etc.) but Henman Hill has remained the most commonly used phrase.

==History==
The terrace is named after Aorangi Park, the London New Zealand Rugby Club&#x27;s grounds, which were on the site until 1981. Aorangi refers to the &#x27;canonical&#x27; Māori description of Aoraki, the highest mountain in New Zealand, also known as Mount Cook. A new big screen was installed on the site following the construction of the new No. 1 Court in 1997. This coincided with the popularity of British player Tim Henman, and the site soon gained the nickname &quot;Henman Hill&quot;, becoming a focal point for so-called Henmania. There is a &quot;Henmans Hill&quot; in Clifton, Bristol, England and anecdotally a supporter attending Wimbledon at the time was from that area and gave the hill that name, it being very similar to &quot;Henman&quot;. British tennis followers would fanatically support four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist Henman as he played often dramatic matches in his many attempts to win the title.

Since Henman&#x27;s retirement in 2007, the area has been colloquially named after other British tennis players. Most frequently, the site has been associated with Andy Murray, with names such as &quot;Murray Mound&quot;, &quot;Mount Murray&quot;, &quot;Murray Mountain&quot; and &quot;Murrayfield&quot; (in reference to the stadium in Edinburgh of the same name) all used.

, the name &quot;Henman Hill&quot; is still used by the BBC and other media in reference to the area. In 2009, Tim Henman stated on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; that he had agreed with Andy Murray it is still &quot;Henman Hill&quot;. Henman joked that &quot;[Murray] can have all those grand slams he&#x27;s going to win but I&#x27;m keeping my hill.&quot;

Tennis pundits and tabloids have occasionally referred to the hill according to the names of a series of other British players who have participated at Wimbledon. During Greg Rusedski&#x27;s matches, the area was sometimes called &quot;Rusedski Ridge&quot;; &quot;Robson Ridge&quot; or &quot;Robson Green&quot; have been used in reference to Laura Robson; plus &quot;Heather Hill&quot; and &quot;Konta Kop&quot; in reference to Heather Watson and Johanna Konta.

Most recently, the success of Emma Raducanu in the 2021 US Open led to speculation over the name &quot;Raducanu Ridge&quot; being used at Wimbledon 2022, in line with &quot;Rusedski Ridge&quot; and &quot;Robson Ridge&quot;. Other potential names for the site were suggested by the BBC, with &quot;Raducanu Rise&quot; coming out as the public&#x27;s favourite.

For the 2022 Wimbledon tournament, Henman Hill was re-created by the AELTC in New York City, from 8 to 10 July. Dubbed the &quot;Hill in New York&quot;, it was set up in Brooklyn Bridge Park at Pier 6, which also offered panoramic views of Lower Manhattan. Tickets were available on a walk-in basis up to a limit of 1,000 people per day.

<doc id="878128" wikidata="Q6483509" url="?curid=878128" title="Lance Parrish">
<text>Lance Michael Parrish (born June 15, 1956), nicknamed &quot;Big Wheel&quot;, is an American former baseball catcher who played Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1977 through 1995. Born in Pennsylvania, Parrish grew up in Southern California and excelled in both baseball and football. He was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in 1974, and after four years in the minor leagues, he played for the Tigers for a decade from 1977 to 1986. He later played for the Philadelphia Phillies (1987–1988), California Angels (1989–1992), Seattle Mariners (1992), Cleveland Indians (1993), Pittsburgh Pirates (1994), and Toronto Blue Jays (1995).

Parrish helped lead the Tigers to the 1984 World Series championship, was selected as an All-Star eight times (1980, 1982–1986, 1988, 1990), and won six Silver Slugger Awards (1980, 1982–1984, 1986, 1990) and three Gold Glove Awards (1983–1985). Over his 19 MLB seasons, he compiled a .252 batting average with 324 home runs, and 1,070 runs batted in (RBIs). At the time of his retirement, he ranked fourth in major-league history in home runs by a catcher and seventh in games played at the position.

After his playing career, Parrish worked as a catching instructor, coach, manager, and broadcaster. He was a member of the Tigers&#x27; coaching staff from 1999 to 2001 and 2003 to 2005. He was the color commentator on Detroit Tigers television broadcasts in 2002. He was also a minor-league manager of the San Antonio Missions (1998), Ogden Raptors (2006), Great Lakes Loons (2007), Erie SeaWolves (2014–2017), and West Michigan Whitecaps (2018–2019).

==Early years==
Parrish was born in 1956 in Clairton, Pennsylvania, a Pittsburgh suburb. At age six, Parrish moved with his family to Southern California. He grew up in Walnut in eastern Los Angeles County. His father was a deputy sheriff with the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. Parrish attended Walnut High School where he was the regular catcher for the baseball team as a freshman and sophomore, and then played several positions (including games as a pitcher) as a junior and senior. Parrish also played for Walnut&#x27;s football and basketball teams. In football, he received all-conference honors at three different positions (quarterback, defensive back, and kicker) and was offered a scholarship to play college football for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

==Professional baseball==
===Minor leagues (1974–1976)===
Parrish was drafted at age 17 by the Detroit Tigers in the first round (16th overall pick) of the 1974 Major League Baseball Draft. The Tigers paid him a $67,000 bonus that persuaded him to abandon a letter of intent to play college football for UCLA.

Parrish began his professional career in 1974 as a third baseman for the Bristol Tigers, Detroit&#x27;s rookie team in the Appalachian League. Parrish compiled a .213 batting average.

In 1975, Parrish played for the Lakeland Tigers, Detroit&#x27;s Single-A affiliate in the Florida State League. Detroit&#x27;s player development director, Hoot Evers, decided to take advantage of Parrish&#x27;s strong throwing arm and moved him to catcher. During the 1975 season, Parrish struggled with blocking balls in the dirt. Evers also persuaded Parrish, a right-handed batter, to try switch-hitting, an experiment that did not take, as his batting average continued to suffer at .220. Parrish became frustrated and questioned his decision to reject the football scholarship from UCLA.

In 1976, Parrish joined the Montgomery Rebels, Detroit&#x27;s Double-A team in the Southern League. He was encouraged by Montgomery manager Les Moss to abandon the switch-hitting experiment. He continued to struggle at the plate with a .221 batting average, but he hit for power with 14 home runs and 55 RBIs in 107 games. He also began to develop confidence calling pitches under Moss&#x27;s guidance and helped the Rebels win the Southern League championship.

In addition to Parrish, the 1976 Montgomery team included future Detroit teammates Alan Trammell, Steve Kemp, Tom Brookens, Jack Morris, and Dave Rozema. Parrish later recalled of his days with Montgomery: &quot;We became a band of brothers in a baseball sense. We pushed one another. We kidded one another. We teased one another. We held each other accountable. I think that transformed us into a championship team in &#x27;84.&quot;

In 1977, Moss and Parrish were both promoted to the Evansville Triplets, Detroit&#x27;s Triple-A club in the American Association. In July 1977, Moss noted: &quot;The guy has worked and worked, worked his tail off every morning the last two years and has never complained.&quot; Parrish earned a reputation in 1977 as the best defensive catcher in the American Association. Working with Moss and making adjustments to his batting stance, Parrish also blossomed at the plate, raising his batting average by 58 points and compiling a .366 on-base percentage in 115 games. He also hit for power, totaling 25 home runs, 90 RBIs, and 216 total bases, and compiling a .519 slugging percentage.

Before making his major-league debut, Parrish worked briefly in 1977 as a bodyguard to singer Tina Turner, accompanying her to a taping of the &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; television show in Burbank, California. Parrish recalled: &quot;It was fun for the time it lasted, but it didn&#x27;t quite compare to trying to become a big league catcher.&quot;

===Detroit Tigers (1977–1986)===
====1977 and 1978 seasons====
Parrish played his last minor-league game for Evansville in August 1977 and was called up by the Tigers, making his major-league debut on September 5. Tiger stars Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker also made their Detroit debuts in September 1977.

In Parrish&#x27;s second game with the Tigers, he scored four runs, hit a home run and a bases-loaded, three-run double, and collected four RBIs, leading Associated Press writer Larry Palladino to write that Parrish &quot;stood out like King Kong atop a phone booth.&quot;

In March 1978, Detroit manager Ralph Houk said: &quot;I never saw a catcher with an arm like that. He&#x27;s a natural – and when you see him with the bat, well, he just looks like a ballplayer. It&#x27;s only a matter of time before he&#x27;s gonna be a great one.&quot; Parrish was expected to spend 1978 as a backup to regular catcher Milt May, but Houk instead employed a platoon system that alternated between Parrish (73 starts at catcher) and May (89 starts at catcher). Parrish hit .219 with 14 home runs.

====Breakout season in 1979====
In 1979, Les Moss began the season as the Tigers&#x27; manager and predicted that Parrish would be a &quot;superstar&quot;, pointing to his &quot;tremendous power&quot;, his line drives that &quot;can take the gloves off fielders&#x27; hands&quot;, and noting that he &quot;throws as good as anybody.&quot; Parrish became the Tigers&#x27; regular catcher, and Milt May was sold to the Chicago White Sox at the end of May. In the middle of June, Sparky Anderson took over from Moss as the Tigers&#x27; manager.

Parrish appeared in 143 games in 1979, and with a regular spot in the lineup, his batting average jumped by nearly 60 points from .219 to .276. He also led the team with 26 doubles and hit 19 home runs. Defensively, his plate-blocking skills were tested as he led the American League with 21 passed balls (21), though he also ranked second among the league&#x27;s catchers in putouts (707), assists (79), and runners caught stealing (57).

====All-Star in 1980====
Parrish continued to improve in 1980 and was hitting over .300 early in the first half of the season. Although Carlton Fisk finished first in the fan voting, Earl Weaver, manager of the American League All-Star team, selected Parrish as a backup catcher for the American League. It was the first of eight All-Star appearances for Parrish.

Parrish finished the 1980 season with a career-high .286 batting average. He also ranked among the league leaders with 34 doubles (seventh), 64 extra-base hits (eighth), a .499 slugging percentage (ninth), and 24 home runs (ninth). Despite otherwise impressive batting statistics, Parrish ranked second in the league by grounding into 24 double plays and ranked fourth with 109 strikeouts. At the end of the 1980 season, he won the first of his six Silver Slugger Awards as the best hitter at the catcher position.

Defensively, Parrish led the American League catchers in passed balls (17) for the second consecutive season. After the 1980 season, Sparky Anderson opined that Parrish was &quot;starting to come around,&quot; but he&#x27;s &quot;not a superstar.&quot; Anderson said that, while Parrish had a great arm and an opportunity to become a superstar, &quot;it&#x27;s going to take an awful, awful awful lot of hard work – especially in receiving.&quot;

====Contract extension====
In January 1981, Parrish complained publicly about his annual salary. He noted that, despite his All-Star performance in 1980, his $90,000 salary was far lower than other major-league catchers such as Darrell Porter ($700,000 a year) and Jim Essian ($1.2 million for four years) and a fraction of the $2.8-million contract the Tigers gave to Alan Trammell for seven years. General manager Jim Campbell responded angrily to Parrish&#x27;s public comments, asserting that the Tigers had offered Parrish a multi-year contract that would have paid him in excess of $375,000 per year. In April 1981, Parrish signed the richest contract in the team&#x27;s history – $3.7 million for six years.

In 1981, after signing the record-setting contract, Parrish&#x27;s batting average dropped by more than 40 points to .244, and his slugging percentage dropped by more than 100 points to .394.

====Offensive rebound in 1982====
After missing most of April with stained ligaments or tendons in his catching hand, Parrish came back strong, carrying a .309 batting average by late May. He was selected to the American League All-Star team and threw out three National League baserunners (Steve Sax, Dave Concepción, and Al Oliver) to set an All-Star Game record. He also had a double in two at-bats.

Parrish&#x27;s batting average jumped 40 points from .244 in 1981 to .284 in 1982. He also ranked among the league leaders with 32 home runs (fifth) and a .529 slugging percentage (eight). His 32 home runs established a new American League record for home runs by a catcher, surpassing the previous mark shared by Yogi Berra and Gus Triandos. Defensively, he gave up 11 passed balls (second most in the league) but his throwing arm continued to place him among the league leaders at catcher with 76 assists (second) and eight double plays turned (third).

At the end of the year, he won his second Silver Slugger Award. He also easily won the Tiger of the Year award, receiving 32 of the 42 first-place votes cast by members of the Detroit chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America.

====Weightlifting====
Parrish was an avid weightlifter during his playing years, giving him one of the most muscular bodies in baseball. His weightlifting created conflict with manager Sparky Anderson who believed that bulking up too much would ruin a player&#x27;s flexibility and hamper his effectiveness. Parrish continued to lift weights despite Anderson&#x27;s concerns. After the 1982 season, Parrish credited his power production to his off-season weightlifting regimen. He noted: &quot;It&#x27;s obvious that me and Sparky have two different opinions on weightlifting.&quot;

====Slugger and Glove Awards, 1983====

Parrish combined excellent offense and defense in 1983. At the plate, he tallied a career-high 114 runs batted in, ranking fourth in the American League. He also ranked among the league leaders with 13 sacrifice flies (first), 42 doubles (third), 72 extra-base hits (third), 292 total bases (eighth), and 27 home runs (ninth).

Defensively, he led the league&#x27;s catchers with 54 runners caught stealing and a 48.6% rate of runners caught stealing. He also ranked among the league&#x27;s leaders at catcher with 695 putouts (second), 73 assists (second) and eight double plays turned (second). He also ranked fourth in the league among players at all positions with a defensive Wins Above Replacement rating of 2.0.

Despite batting .304 at the All-Star break, Parrish trailed Milwaukee&#x27;s Ted Simmons by 100,000 in the fan voting, despite the fact that Simmons was used largely as a designated hitter. Asked about the controversial fan selection, Parrish replied, &quot;I&#x27;m not disappointed at all. Ted Simmons is the player the people want to see. . . . Hopefully, I&#x27;ll get a chance to play.&quot; Parrish was selected to the All-Star team as a reserve All-Star for the second consecutive year.

At the end of the season, Parrish won both the Silver Slugger and Gold Glove Awards, establishing him as both the best offensive and defensive catcher in the American League. He also ranked ninth in the voting for the American League Most Valuable Player award.

====World Series champions in 1984====
Parrish appeared in 147 regular-season games and all eight post-season games for the 1984 Detroit Tigers team that led the American League from the first game to the last and won the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres. On April 7, in the fourth game of the season, he caught Jack Morris&#x27;s no-hitter, giving his longtime teammate a &quot;ferocious hug&quot; after the final out. The Tigers began the season with 35 wins and 5 losses, and for the first time in his career, Parrish led the fan voting to be the starting catcher in the All-Star Game. He received 1,524,616 votes, over 700,000 votes more than second-place finisher Carlton Fisk.

Batting as the clean-up hitter, Parrish hit a team-leading 33 home runs, breaking his own American League record for most home runs in a season by a catcher. His 33 home runs ranked third in the league. He also led the Tigers offense with 98 RBI. Defensively, he again led the league&#x27;s catchers with 11 double plays turned and ranked second with 67 assists and third with a range factor of 6.20 per game.

In the decisive fifth game of the 1984 World Series, Parrish scored two runs, stole a base, and hit a seventh-inning home run off Goose Gossage. In all five games of the series, he compiled a .364 on-base percentage and .500 slugging percentage and scored three runs. In the post-game celebration, Parrish said, &quot;I can&#x27;t even describe what this town has meant to us this year. Everybody&#x27;s been excited. Everybody&#x27;s been looking forward for a chance to get crazy here.&quot;

At the end of the season, Parrish again won the Silver Slugger Award as well as a second Gold Glove Award. It was the second consecutive year in which Parrish was recognized as both the best offensive and defensive catcher in the American League.

====1985 and 1986 seasons====
In 1985, Parrish had another strong season, though he was unable to play at catcher for three weeks in July due to a lower back strain. In order to rest his back, he appeared in 22 games at designated hitter. He ended the season with a .273 batting average with 28 home runs, 27 doubles, and 98 RBIs. On defense, her ranked second in the league with a range factor of 6.23 per game at catcher. At the end of the 1985 season, Parrish received his third consecutive Gold Glove Award.

In 1986, Parrish began the season strong, totaling 21 home runs and 59 RBIs at the All-Star break. He again was chosen for the All-Star team, but back problems sidelined him for much of the second half. He appeared in only 91 games, 82 as the team&#x27;s starting catcher. He finished the season with a .257 batting average, 22 home runs and 62 RBIs.

Parrish&#x27;s six-year contract expired at the end of the 1986 season. The Tigers offered him a two-year, $2.4 million contract (without guarantee in the second year). Parrish rejected the offer and became a free agent.

===Philadelphia Phillies (1987–1988)===
On March 13, 1987, Parrish signed with the Philadelphia Phillies as a free agent. During the 1987 season, Parrish appeared in 130 games for the Phillies, 124 of them as the starting catcher. He compiled a .257 batting average and hit 17 home runs, his lowest total since the strike-shortened 1981 season. He also grounded into 23 double plays, the second highest total in the National League. His defensive performance also suffered, as he led the league with 142 stolen bases allowed. He had never ranked among the American League leaders in that category.

In 1988, Parrish&#x27;s offensive output declined further. His batting average dropped to .215, and his slugging percentage of .370 was his lowest to date. He did, however, regain form defensively, leading the National League catchers with 11 double plays turned and ranking second in the league with 73 assists and 50 runners caught stealing. He was selected to the National League All-Star team in 1988, but his back problems continued, and he became &quot;a lightning rod for fan discontent&quot; as the Phillies finished in last place (65–96) in 1988.

===California Angels (1989–1992)===
On October 3, 1988, the Phillies traded Parrish to the California Angels for minor-league pitcher David Holdridge. Parrish, who lived in Yorba Linda, California, reportedly signed a one-year contract providing a $1 million base salary and a potential for up to $400,000 in bonuses. At the time, Parrish said: &quot;I&#x27;m very happy; things couldn&#x27;t have worked out better. Getting back home was our top priority as a family. This is where our lives are . . . where we&#x27;ve rooted ourselves.&quot;

Parrish was the Angels starting catcher from 1989 to 1991, starting over 100 games at the position each year. In 1990, he regained his offensive power, hitting 24 home runs and winning his sixth and final Silver Slugger Award.

Parrish played two-and-a-half months for the Angels in 1992, compiling a .229 batting average with four home runs and 11 runs batted in. He was released by the Angels on June 23, 1992. At the time, columnist Mike Downey praised Parrish as &quot;one damn fine guy&quot;, &quot;a presence of dignity and civility in a sometimes crass and unpleasant setting&quot;, and a player who &quot;belongs on any list of baseball&#x27;s best 10 catchers ever.&quot;

===Seattle Mariners (1992)===
On June 28, 1992, Parrish signed with the Seattle Mariners as a free agent to become a backup to catcher Dave Valle. Parrish, age 36 at the time, noted: &quot;It&#x27;s not like everybody was beating down my door, but I still feel I have a lot to offer a team. I have a lot of catching experience and by no means do I feel I&#x27;m over the hill offensively.&quot; He appeared in 69 games for the Mariners, 34 as a catcher, 16 as a first baseman, and 14 as a designated hitter. Hit tallied 11 doubles and eight home runs in 192 at bats.

===Final years (1993–1996)===
In January 1993, Parrish signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and accepted an invitation to spring training. With rookie catcher (and future Hall of Fame inductee) Mike Piazza batting .571 during spring training, the Dodgers released Parrish in late March. He spent part of the 1993 season playing in the Dodges farm system for the Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes.

On May 7, 1993, he signed as a free agent with the Cleveland Indians. He appeared in only 10 games, tallying four hits (including a home run) in 20 at bats. He was released by the Indians on May 30, 1993.

In February 1994, Parrish signed a free-agent contract with the Detroit Tigers. He spent part of the 1994 season playing for the Tigers&#x27; Triple-A team, the Toledo Mud Hens. He was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates, appeared in 40 games for the Pirates in 1994, 34 as the club&#x27;s starting catcher, and compiled a .270 batting average with three home runs and 15 runs batted in.

In February 1995, Parrish signed as a free agent with the Kansas City Royals. He was then acquired by the Toronto Blue Jays on April 22, 1995. On May 29, Parrish hit two home runs against the Detroit Tigers. He appeared in 70 games for the Blue Jays, including 49 games as the team&#x27;s starting catcher. He compiled a .202 batting average with Toronto and hit four home runs with 22 runs batted in. He appeared in his final major-league game on September 23, 1995, at age 39.

Parrish signed as a free agent with the Pittsburgh Pirates in January 1996. He was released by the Pirates in late March. Though one of the coaches typically handled player cuts, manager Jim Leyland personally delivered the news to Parrish. Leyland noted that Parrish had &quot;earned the right to be in a different category.&quot;

===Career statistics and honors===
In a 19-year major-league career, Parrish played in 1,988 games, accumulating 1,782 hits in 7,067 at bats for a .252 career batting average along with 324 home runs and 1,070 runs batted in. Parrish was an eight-time All-Star (1980, 1982–86, 1988, and 1990), and he won three Gold Glove Awards (1983–85). Parrish was a six-time winner of the Silver Slugger Award, which is awarded annually to the best offensive player at each position.

Parrish ranks as one of the greatest power-hitting catchers in baseball history. By 1994, he ranked fourth in major-league history in home runs as a catcher, trailing only Hall of Famers Carlton Fisk, Johnny Bench, and Yogi Berra. He now ranks sixth, having been passed by Hall of Famers Mike Piazza and Ivan Rodriguez.

Parrish also ranks as one of the most durable catchers in baseball history. At the time of his retirement, his 1,818 games at the position ranked seventh in baseball history. As of 2022, he ranks 13th.

He led American League catchers twice in baserunners caught stealing, once in assists, and once in caught stealing percentage. Parrish finished second in fielding percentage four times and ended his career with a .991 fielding percentage.

In 2001, Parrish received 9 votes (1.7% of the ballots) for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Because he did not receive 5% of the vote, he was not eligible to remain on the following year&#x27;s ballot. Parrish was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.

==Coach, manager, and broadcaster==
===Kansas City and San Antonio (1996–1997)===
In June 1996, Parrish was hired by the Kansas City Royals as a special catching instructor to work with catcher Mike Sweeney. In 1997, he was the hitting coach of the Los Angeles Dodgers Double-A team, the San Antonio Missions. He became manager of the San Antonio team in June 1998. San Antonio compiled a 67–73 record with Parrish as its manager.

===Detroit (1999–2005)===
In October 1998, Parrish was hired as the Detroit Tigers&#x27; third base and catching coach. Trammell was hired at the same time as the Tigers&#x27; batting coach. He also spent two games as interim manager in July 1999 when regular manager Larry Parrish (no relation) was suspended for bumping an umpire. When Phil Garner took over as manager, Parrish was reassigned as bullpen coach for the 2000 season. Parrish returned to his role as third base coach in 2001, but he was fired by Garner at the end off the 2001 season.

In December 2001, Parrish was hired to serve as the color commentator on Detroit Tigers game broadcasts on Detroit&#x27;s WKBD television station during the 2002 season. He replaced Al Kaline, who had been a Tigers television announcer for 26 years.

In October 2002, Alan Trammell was hired as the Tigers&#x27; manager, and Parrish joined Trammell&#x27;s staff as bullpen coach. The Tigers lost 300 games in three years under Trammell, and he was fired at the end of the 2005 season. Parrish was also dismissed at that time.

===Ogden (2006)===
In January 2006, Parrish was hired by the Los Angeles Dodgers as manager of their rookie-level team, the Ogden Raptors. The team finished with a 37–39 record. He next served as manager of the Great Lakes Loons in Single-A ball during the 2007 season. The team compiled a 57–82 record.

===Return to Tigers organization (2014–present)===

On February 5, 2014, Parrish was named manager of the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers, the Erie SeaWolves. He was manager of the SeaWolves for four years from 2014 to 2017, compiling a record there of 329–376.

He later served during the 2018 and 2019 seasons as the manager of Single-A West Michigan Whitecaps of the Midwest League. The Whitecaps compiled a 118–160 record in two seasons under Parrish. In nine seasons as a minor-league manager, Parrish compiled an overall record of 541–657 (.452).

On November 12, 2019, Parrish was named special assistant to the general manager for the Tigers.

==Personal life==
After the 1978 season, Parrish married Arlyne Nolan, a first runner-up in the Miss California competition. They have three children. David played baseball at the University of Michigan, was selected by the New York Yankees in the first round of the 2000 amateur draft, and played in the minor leagues from 2000 to 2008.

Parrish co-wrote (with Tom Gage) &quot;The Enchanted Season&quot;, a book about the 1984 World Series champion team, which published in June 2024.

<text>The Battle of Vigo Bay, also known as the Battle of Rande (; ), was a naval engagement fought on 23 October 1702 during the opening years of the War of the Spanish Succession. The engagement followed an Anglo-Dutch attempt to capture the Spanish port of Cádiz in September in an effort to secure a naval base in the Iberian Peninsula. From this station the Allies had hoped to conduct operations in the western Mediterranean Sea, particularly against the French at Toulon.

The amphibious assault, however, had proved a disaster, but as Admiral George Rooke retreated home in early October, he received news that the Spanish treasure fleet from America, laden with silver and merchandise, had entered Vigo Bay in northern Spain. Philips van Almonde convinced Rooke to attack the treasure ships, despite the lateness of the year and the fact that the vessels were protected by French ships-of-the-line.

The French and Spanish fleet sought safety behind a boom with twin batteries. However, Allied marines captured the harbour batteries while an Allied ship broke the boom. The main Anglo-Dutch fleet then attacked the outnumbered and immobilized French fleet. The French surrendered six ships-of-the-line, and others were destroyed.

The engagement was an overwhelming naval success for the Allies: the entire French escort fleet, under the command of Châteaurenault, together with the Spanish galleons and transports under Manuel de Velasco, had either been captured or destroyed. Yet because most of the treasure had been off-loaded before the attack, capturing the bulk of the silver cargo had eluded Rooke. Nevertheless, the victory was a welcome boost to Allied morale and helped persuade Peter II of Portugal to abandon his earlier treaty with France and join the Grand Alliance.

==Background==

The accession of the Bourbon Philip V to the Spanish throne in 1700 had aroused little opposition in Spain. In the Spanish American empire, however, officials and colonists resisted French attempts to take over their trade. Dutch and English traders, though officially illegal, were accepted by the Spanish, but in the Caribbean, French admirals who had come to &quot;protect&quot; Spanish silver home to Europe were regarded with intense suspicion. The first French squadron sailed in April 1701 under the Marquis de Coëtlogon, but the Spanish governors would not even permit him to buy victuals, and he returned empty handed. Nevertheless, the weakness of the Spanish navy left the government in Madrid little choice but to rely on French warships for escort duty. Every effort was made to ensure that the bullion was landed in Spain rather than France, from where it might never return.

The naval campaign of 1702 was therefore played out in two distant theatres of America and Spain, linked together by the trail of the Spanish treasure ships across the Atlantic. The American theatre became a scene long remembered in popular English tradition following Admiral Benbow&#x27;s running battle in August off Santa Marta. However, the Royal Navy&#x27;s main effort was not off the Spanish Main, but off the Spanish coasts in Europe. Under the leadership of King William III, the Maritime Powers, England and the Dutch Republic, had resolved upon a Mediterranean strategy for the Allied fleets, a policy continued under William&#x27;s successors following his death in March 1702. It was hoped that this strategy would encourage Portugal to join the Allies, open the Strait of Gibraltar, and secure English naval power in the Mediterranean. Their allies, the Austrians, were also clamouring for a naval presence in the Mediterranean to assist them in achieving their own primary ambitions, the capture of Spain&#x27;s provinces in Italy. To meet these ends, the Anglo-Dutch fleets would first need to seize a port in the Iberian Peninsula from which their ships could operate. The Allies, therefore, resolved upon an expedition, led by Admiral George Rooke, to capture the southern Spanish port of Cádiz, and at a stroke cut off Spain&#x27;s transatlantic trade.

==Prelude==
===Silver fleet from America===
On 11 June 1702, the Spanish silver fleet from New Spain left Veracruz under escort of a French squadron commanded by Admiral Châteaurenault. The Spanish vessels were commanded by Manuel de Velasco in his armed galleon, the &quot;Jesús María y José&quot;, one of three ships forming the &quot;Armada de Barlovento&quot; whose task it was to protect the fleet. The whole convoy arrived at Havana on 7 July, before striking out across the Atlantic on the 24th. The fleet comprised 56 vessels: 22 were Spanish, the rest French, including a large number of merchantmen which, by the end of the voyage, had sailed for France as soon as their safety across the Atlantic had been assured.

When Châteaurenault had set out for the Caribbean in 1701, war between France and the Maritime Powers had not yet been declared, but the convoy had since received news of the outbreak of hostilities and of Rooke&#x27;s blockade of Cádiz, the usual destination of the silver fleet from America. It was clear, therefore, a new harbour would be needed. Velasco considered the small port of Los Pasajes, but Châteaurenault favoured Brest, La Rochelle or even Lisbon. A compromise was put forward, and on 23 September the Franco-Spanish fleet entered Vigo Bay in Galicia. There was, however, considerable delay in unloading the cargo. The whole administrative apparatus normally present at unloading (inspectors, valuers, royal officials, etc.), was in Seville and Cádiz, and had to be awaited before anything could be put ashore. When the unloading eventually began, it was found that means of transporting the goods were lacking. As a result, priority was given to the silver, which was unloaded first and despatched inland to Lugo.

===Allied pursuit===
By mid-October the English government had learnt of the Spanish presence in Vigo Bay, and immediately sent off messengers to scour the seas for Rooke and Admiral Cloudesley Shovell, the latter of whom had been cruising with his squadron off Ushant. By now Rooke was returning home from the disastrous campaign against Cádiz, which, due to ill-discipline and poor co-operation, had forced the admiral to abandon the enterprise at the end of September. Fortuitously, however, Rooke had already learnt the news of the Spanish convoy from one of his own ships – Captain Thomas Hardy in the &quot;Pembroke&quot; who had stayed behind to water in the Portuguese port of Lagos. &quot;Pembroke&#x27;s&quot; chaplain, a Jersey man named Beauvoir, had learned from the boastful French consul of the treasure ships in the harbour, news of which had been confirmed to Beauvoir by a messenger from the Imperial Embassy in Lisbon. At once, Hardy gave chase, and caught Rooke on 17 October in time to prevent him crossing the Bay of Biscay. Admiral Rooke recorded in his journal:

Under consideration of the intelligence brought to Captain Hardy of the &quot;Pembroke&quot; ... It is resolved that we make best our way to the port of Vigo, and insult them immediately with our whole line, if not by such detachments as shall render the attempt most effectual.

Rooke sent ships to explore the mouth of Vigo Bay. A landing party had gleaned information from a captured friar that King Philip&#x27;s part of the treasure had already been landed, but that much wealth was still left on board the Spanish vessels.

==Battle==
On the evening of 22 October the Anglo-Dutch fleet entered the Ria de Vigo, and sailed past the two forts of the city of Vigo that fired at them as they passed by. At the end of the bay the French fleet and Spanish treasure ships lay in the harbour of Redondela, surrounded by the Galician mountains. Châteaurenault had taken charge of the defensive measures, and had blocked the narrow entrance, across the Rande Strait, with a boom made largely of timber and chain tightly bound together. At the north end of the boom was positioned a gun battery which, according to Rooke&#x27;s journal, comprised &quot;fifteen or sixteen&quot; guns; at the south end sat Fort Rande sitting a little way up from the sea, consisting of a strong stone tower with platforms constructed for cannon. The space between the tower and the water&#x27;s edge consisted of a fortified enclosure, at the bottom of which stood a battery commanding the straits. In total, the Rande fortifications had been armed with more than 30 guns. To supplement the French troops from the fleet, a number of levies were raised by the Prince of Barbançon, governor and captain-general of Galicia.

Aboard the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; an Allied council of war discussed the options for the attack. The plan was to destroy the boom with English and Dutch ships, whilst the troops from the fleet would silence the shore defences. But the naval encounter would not be a conventional line-of-battle engagement: Vigo Bay allowed no room for the deployment of a battle line, so Rooke had to adapt his tactics to the exigencies of the situation. Rooke recorded in his journal:

Upon consideration of the present position of Monsieur Châteaurenault&#x27;s squadron ... and in regard the whole fleet cannot, without great hazard of being in a huddle, attempt them where they are: it is resolved to send in a detachment of fifteen English and ten Dutch ships of the line of battle with all the fireships, to use their best endeavours to take or destroy the aforesaid ships of the enemy ...

===Breaking the boom===
Early in the morning on 23 October, Vice Admiral Thomas Hopsonn in the led the attack on the boom, closely followed by a strong squadron of his English ships, and of Dutch vessels under Vice Admiral Philips van der Goes. Near each end of the boom Châteaurenault had moored two of his largest men-of-war: the &quot;Bourbon&quot;, and the &quot;Esperance&quot;. Within the boom he had moored five other large men-of-war with their broadsides bearing upon the entrance.

Meanwhile, Ormonde with some 2,000 men, had landed on the shore near Teis and marched on Fort Rande. Ormonde sent Lord Shannon with the vanguard of grenadiers to assault the position, defended by several hundred troops. The wall enclosing the outer ward was stormed, and the seaward battery silenced in time to assist the breaking of the boom by the ships. The tower, defended by approximately 300 Franco-Spanish troops, held out a little longer, but this also fell to the Allied grenadiers. As the southern shore guns were being assailed by Ormonde&#x27;s men, the 90 gun &quot;Association&quot; attacked and silenced the smaller northern battery on the other side of the bay.

The &quot;Torbay&quot;, favoured by a breath of wind, crashed at the boom. It cracked, and the ship floated through in amongst the French squadron beyond. However, a sudden drop in the breeze prevented any other Allied vessel following, and Hopsonn found himself temporarily outnumbered. A fireship was laid alongside the &quot;Torbay&quot;, setting it alight. Fortunately for Hopsonn the fireship, laden with snuff from the Spanish Indies, suddenly blew up, and a great cloud enveloped the English vessel, partly extinguishing the flames thus enabling the crew to control the blaze. According to Rooke&#x27;s journal 53 men were drowned in the incident, but as the breeze picked up the other Allied ships managed to traverse the boom and engage with the enemy.

With the boom broken, and the forts silenced, the Franco-Spanish fleet was lost. Offering little resistance, Châteaurenault&#x27;s men set fire to their own ships in the harbour, and sought safety on shore. The Allied seamen worked throughout the night to save their prizes, and by morning there was not a single French or Spanish vessel that had not been either captured or destroyed.

==Aftermath==
===Losses and gains===
Vigo Bay was a major naval disaster for the French: of the 15 ships of the line, 2 frigates and one fireship, not a single vessel escaped. Five ships were captured by the English, and one by the Dutch. The rest were burnt, either by the Allies or the French themselves. (&quot;See table below&quot;). The Spanish suffered as badly: of the three galleons and 13 trading vessels in their fleet, all were destroyed, save five which were taken by the Allies (at least three of these were captured by the English). By 24 October most of the damage was complete. What remained of the ships and the fortifications were destroyed by Admiral Shovell&#x27;s squadron on 27 October.

Spanish naval losses meant a total dependence on the French navy to keep up communications with the Americas. However, the Spanish government felt no financial blow: it owned only two of the three large galleons, and none of the trading vessels. Those who suffered most, not just from the losses of the ships but also from the immense merchandise on board (pepper, cochineal, cocoa, snuff, indigo, hides, etc.) were the private traders. The news that the treasure fleet had got safely to Vigo was initially the cause of celebration for the merchants of Holland but the subsequent reports of the battle were received with mixed feelings in Amsterdam as the wealth captured or destroyed belonged as much to the English and Dutch traders as it did to the Spanish. What the Spanish government did own was the silver, most of which had already been unloaded from the ships before the Allied attack, and was ultimately deposited in the castle of Segovia.

The Allies, therefore, did not capture as much silver for themselves as was often supposed. The Master of the Mint, Isaac Newton, stated in June 1703 that the total metal handed in to him by that date was 4504 lb 2 oz of silver (~2,043 kg), and 7 lb 8 oz and 13 dwt of gold (~3.4 kg), estimated at a value of just £14,000. Coins subsequently struck from these metals bore the word &quot;VIGO&quot; below Anne&#x27;s bust, and are rare and valuable.

In February 1703, Philip V issued a decree, by way of reprisal, to confiscate all the silver that had come with the treasure fleet belonging to the English and Dutch, totalling four million pesos. In addition, the King decided to borrow two million pesos from what had come for the Spanish traders and the Consulate of Seville. In total, Philip managed to keep nearly seven million pesos, representing over half the silver from the fleet, amounting to the biggest sum in history obtained from the American trade by any Spanish king. The result was an immense financial windfall for Philip V.

===Methuen Treaties===
The naval success at Vigo had considerable implications for the Grand Alliance. On the accession of the Bourbon Philip V to the Spanish throne, King Peter II of Portugal, anxious to remain friends with his more powerful neighbour, had signed an alliance with France in June 1701. But it was the security of Portugal&#x27;s overseas empire that was more important than its inland frontier. To protect Portugal&#x27;s trade routes from South America, the ministers in Lisbon knew the importance of aligning themselves with the dominant naval power in the Atlantic. After Rooke&#x27;s success at Vigo, it was clear that that naval strength reposed in the Maritime Powers.

In May 1703, the Portuguese signed the Methuen Treaties with England. &quot;The preservation of our overseas colonies makes it indispensable for us to have a good intelligence with the powers which now possess the command of the sea,&quot; commented José da Cunha Brochado, the Portuguese minister in London, &quot;the cost is heavy, but for us such an understanding is essential.&quot; It was an Allied triumph to detach Portugal from her French alliance: with Lisbon as a base the Allied fleet could dominate the Strait of Gibraltar and cripple French action in the Mediterranean. But the alliance with Portugal forced a major change in Allied strategy: the Maritime Powers now found themselves committed to extensive campaigning in Spain, with one army based in Lisbon, another based to the east in Catalonia. The policy was ultimately to prove a heavy burden and the cause of a disastrous campaign in the peninsula, but in the long term, the commercial provisions of the treaties were to prove an essential component of Britain&#x27;s wealth. The naval victory at Vigo, therefore, made an indirect but powerful contribution to Britain&#x27;s 18th century prosperity.

===Sunken treasure===
Efforts to recover the sunken treasure began almost immediately and continued for centuries. After their initial attempts failed, the Spanish government hired private contractors to recover the treasure, but these also proved unsuccessful. In 1728, a Frenchman named Alexandre Goubert managed to bring a ship almost completely to shore, but abandoned his efforts when it became apparent that it was a French battleship without treasure. An English expedition in 1825 led by William Evans utilized a diving bell, and over the course of a year managed to recover small amounts of silver, cannonballs, and other items. Around the same period, a group calling itself The American Vigo Bay Treasure Company made an ill-fated attempt to raise a ship, tearing it apart. Decades later, Cavalier Pino, using his invention the hydroscope, scanned the location and mapped out several ships, and with a series of careful experiments managed to recover several cannons and preserved wood.

On 10 August 1990 after being surveyed by sonar side scan on behalf of &quot;5º Centenario&quot; (Spanish Government 500th anniversary of America&#x27;s discovery) remains of the wreckage &quot;Santo Cristo de Maracaibo&quot; were found off the Cíes Islands by R.O.V submarine at 79 metres depth. The Contractor was Hidrografic S.A., Tarragona, Surveyor and R.O.V. Pilot: Olaf Hingst, Vessel: &#x27;Potela Seis&#x27;, Vigo.

==In popular culture==
In the Netherlands, the battle, and more specific the capture of the Spanish treasure, was referred to in a popular broadside ballad &quot;Een Nieuw Lied van den Spaensche Zilvervloot&quot; (&quot;A New Song on the Spanish Silver Fleet&quot;), published in subsequent publications during the 18th century.

The battle is referred to in Jules Verne&#x27;s 1870 novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;. The book&#x27;s protagonist, Captain Nemo, draws his wealth and the funding for his submarine &quot;Nautilus&quot; from the cargoes of the ships sunk by the Grand Alliance fleet during the battle, which are depicted as never having offloaded their treasure and as being easily accessible to divers.

<text>Gaggia is an Italian manufacturer of coffee machines, especially espresso machines, in addition to small kitchen appliances. The company is owned by the Evoca Group.

==History==
The founder, Giovanni Achille Gaggia (1895–1961), applied for a patent (patent number 365726) for the first modern steamless coffee machine on 5 September 1938, to be used commercially in his coffee bar. The machine forced water to flow over the coffee grounds at a high pressure, producing the &#x27;crema&#x27; that is unique to espresso.

The Gaggia company was founded in 1947 and formally incorporated in 1948. It first produced machines for commercial use, but shortly thereafter released the Gilda, its first home machine.

Success came when the Motta &amp; Biffi bar in Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, in Milan, installed a Gaggia machine. Initially the coffee machines produced by Gaggia were exclusively for professional use, but in 1977 production expanded to coffee machines for domestic use. Giovanni&#x27;s son, Camillo, with his partner Armando Migliorini, expanded the business on the Navigli but encountered economic difficulties. In 1989 the company, which had a turnover of over 56 billion lire, changed ownership and was sold to the Austro-American businessman Gerhard Andlingler.

Gaggia has four product lines. They market automatic espresso machines, manual espresso machines, accessories, and coffee beans under the Gaggia brand name. The company continues to produce espresso machines (as well as accessories) from classic manual machines to the innovative semi-automatic and super-automatic models recently added to the line.

In 2007 the Milanese company went into crisis due to a drop in sales, with the risk of closing the Robecco plant and moving production to Romania and Gaggio Montano. Two years later, Gaggia follows the fate of its parent company Saeco, which is taken over by the Dutch multinational Philips.

As of 2010, all Gaggia espresso and coffee machines are still manufactured in Milan at the Robecco Sul Naviglio factory. The 2015 Gaggia Classic was built in Romania instead. The New Gaggia Classic is made in Italy again and uses an aluminum boiler.

The Gaggia S.p. A company was purchased in 1999 by fellow Italian competitor Saeco International Group, which in turn was purchased by Dutch manufacturer Philips in 2009. Gaggia still operates a separate line but now is using Saeco designs in some of its domestic espresso machines. Before the takeover by Philips most domestic espresso machines from Gaggia had aluminium boilers. Now they have stainless steel boilers.

In 2017 Philips sold the Saeco Professional division, along with the Gaggia brand, to N&amp;W Global Vending SpA, an Italian Bergamo based company known as a leader in vending machines for drinks and snacks. In November, 2017 N&amp;W changed its name to Evoca Group, which revitalized the Gaggio Montano plant in Bologna. The company specialized in the production of machines for bars and restaurants and relaunched the Gaggia brand.

<doc id="878133" wikidata="Q1352652" url="?curid=878133" title="Syd Field">
<text>Sydney Alvin Field (December 19, 1935November 17, 2013) was an American author who wrote several books on screenwriting, the first being &quot;Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting&quot; (Dell Publishing, 1979). He led workshops and seminars about producing salable screenplays. Hollywood film producers use Field&#x27;s ideas on structure to measure the potential of screenplays.

In 2001, he was inducted into American Screenwriters Association&#x27;s Screenwriting Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Syd Field was born on December 19, 1935, in Hollywood, California. His uncle, Sol Halprin, was the head of the camera department at 20th Century Fox, and his neighbor was a talent agent who got him minor screen time in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) which was cut from the final film. He also played the trumpet in &quot;State of the Union&quot; (1948).

He attended Hollywood High School where he met Frank Mazzola, the &quot;gang consultant&quot; on &quot;Rebel Without a Cause (1955)&quot;, who encouraged him to pursue acting. His mother passed away during his senior year, which caused him to drift across the US for two years.

He considered medical school at the behest of his mother to consider a &quot;professional life&quot;, but he eventually earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from University of California, Berkeley, where he studied under Jean Renoir and was cast in his play, &quot;Carola&quot;. Renoir recommended that Field attend UCLA Film School where Field collaborated on a short film with Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek of The Doors.

== Career ==
Field worked as a script reader in the 1970s. Field got his start in the shipping department of David L. Wolper Productions, where he later worked his way up to writer/researcher for the company&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot; series, hosted by reporter Mike Wallace, in the early 60&#x27;s. By the release of the expanded edition for &quot;Screenplay&quot; 1994, he was credited as writer/producer at Wolper Productions.

Field was also a freelance screenwriter and script consultant. He wrote nine screenplays, one of which was produced as the Argentinian film, &quot;Los Banditos.&quot; Field wrote and produced the television series &quot;Men in Crisis&quot; in 1964 and the Vegas nightlife documentary, &quot;Spree,&quot; in 1967; the latter of which he also narrated.

He wrote &quot;Hollywood and the Stars&quot;, &quot;National Geographic&quot;, and &quot;Jacques Cousteau Specials&quot; from 1963 −1965 for David L. Wolper Productions.

He was the head of story at Cinemobile System when founder Fouad Said decided to diversify the location services company into an entertainment studio.

== Teaching ==
Field taught screenwriting for the Master of Professional Writing Program at University of Southern California until 2001. In the mid-1970s, Field began teaching screenwriting at the Sherwood Oaks Experimental College (now Sherwood Oaks College) in Hollywood. He also led screenwriting workshops across the world. Previous students include Judd Apatow, John Singleton, Anna Hamilton Phelan, and Alfonso Cuarón.

===The paradigm===

Field&#x27;s most notable contribution is his paradigm &quot;three-act structure&quot;. In this structure, a writer sets a film&#x27;s plot within the first twenty to thirty minutes. Then the protagonist experiences a plot point, providing the protagonist with a goal. About half of a movie&#x27;s running time focuses on the protagonist&#x27;s struggle to achieve this goal. The second act is called the confrontation. Field also refers to the midpoint, a turning point around the middle of the screenplay (such as on or around page 60 of a 120-page screenplay). This turning point is often a devastating reversal of the protagonist&#x27;s fortune. The third act depicts the protagonist&#x27;s struggle to achieve (or not achieve) his or her goal, as well as the aftermath.

== Personal life ==
He met his second wife, Aviva, while leading a workshop in Vienna in the early 1990s. He had one daughter from a previous marriage. His brother is a doctor.

Field died on November 17, 2013, aged 77, at his home in Beverly Hills, California.

<doc id="878134" wikidata="Q282463" url="?curid=878134" title="Jean-Alain Boumsong">
<text>Jean-Alain Boumsong Somkong (born 14 December 1979) is a French former professional footballer who played as a defender. 

Boumsong began his senior career with French club Le Havre in 1997 before joining AJ Auxerre in 2000. His performances at Auxerre earned him a move to Rangers in 2004. One season later, he signed with Newcastle United. where he spent two seasons. In 2006, he joined Juventus, freshly relegated to Serie B and helped the club return to Serie A. He returned to France with Lyon in 2008. His last spell was at Greek Super League side Panathinaikos before ending his career in 2013. Between 2003 and 2009, he made 27 appearances scoring 1 goal for the France national team.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Boumsong was born in Douala, Cameroon, and started his career with French team Le Havre before joining AJ Auxerre. He notably scored the 89th-minute winning goal in Auxerre&#x27;s 2–1 win in the 2003 French Cup Final against Paris Saint-Germain.

A long-time target for then Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier, the press speculated that it was only a matter of time before Boumsong signed for Liverpool. However, as Boumsong was a free agent, his agent, the Monaco based Scot Willie McKay negotiated the best sign-on fee to the player for Boumsong from Scottish Premier League club Rangers.

===Rangers===
As a result, Boumsong joined Alex McLeish at Rangers in 2004 and signed a five-year contract. Boumsong quickly adapted to the Scottish game and showed his skill as a centre-back, leading to rumours that his stay in Glasgow may be shorter than expected. Halfway through the 2004–05 season, Newcastle under new manager Graeme Souness, made an £8 million bid for him, which Rangers accepted in a deal that was finalized once the January 2005 transfer window opened. However, as Boumsong had played the requisite number of games for Rangers that season, he still received a Scottish Premiership Winners Medal, despite having been a Newcastle player for around five months by the time Rangers won the title.

===Newcastle United===
Boumsong signed a -year contract with the Magpies.

The £8 million transfer fee raised eyebrows, as the player, being out of contract, had joined Rangers for free just months before, at which point Newcastle showed no interest in signing him. This transfer is one of those about which the Stevens inquiry report in June 2007 expressed concerns:

&quot;There remains inconsistencies in evidence provided by Graeme Souness – a former manager of the club – and Freddy Shepherd – apparently acting in an undefined role but not as a club official – as to their respective roles in transfer negotiations.&quot;

&quot;The inquiry is still awaiting clarification from agent Willie McKay&quot;.

However the Stevens enquiry later issued two clarifications. It said of Souness, &quot;We wish to make it clear that inconsistencies did not exist within the evidence given by Graeme Souness to Quest concerning his role in transfers covered by the Inquiry during his time as manager of Newcastle United F.C. and neither the Premier League nor do Quest have any concerns in this regard&quot;. As regards McKay it stated: &quot;Further to the key findings from the final Quest report published on 15 June 2007 by the Premier League, Quest would like to emphasise that, in that report, it was clear that no evidence of irregular payments was found in the transfers in the inquiry period which involved the agent Willie McKay. Quest would also like to thank Mr McKay for his cooperation with the inquiry.&quot;

He had a mixed time during his stay on Tyneside in regards to his form. During his first season at Newcastle he was praised for his defensive abilities and partnership with Titus Bramble. His popularity led to fans shouting the first syllable of his name, elongating the sound in a similar way to Arsenal fans chanting Nwankwo Kanu&#x27;s name.

===Juventus===
On 22 August 2006, Boumsong joined the recently Serie B relegated Juventus for a fee of £3.3m, with future incentives promised to Newcastle relating to Juventus&#x27; future performance. In September 2006, Boumsong scored his first Juventus goal in a game against Crotone where Juventus won 3–0. Valeri Bojinov scored the other two goals. In Boumsong&#x27;s final match with Juventus, he scored a key equaliser in their Coppa Italia match against rivals Inter Milan on 23 January 2008.

===Lyon===
On 24 January 2008, Boumsong moved to French club Olympique Lyonnais on a three-and-a-half-year contract. He stated he made this move in order to increase his chances to make Raymond Domenech&#x27;s EURO 2008 squad.

He made his debut for the club in 4–1 win over Sochaux at Stade de Gerland on 8 February 2008. In the 2008–09 season, he scored his first Lyon&#x27;s goal against Le Mans on 4 April 2009.

===Panathinaikos===
On 30 July 2010, Boumsong transferred from Olympique Lyonnais to Superleague Greece champions Panathinaikos F.C. for a fee that could rise up to €750,000. He signed a three-year contract with the Greek club, earning €1.9 million annually. Although he started the season roughly, he gradually improved his performance and gained the fans&#x27; trust. He scored his first goal in a 2–0 win against Panserraikos.

In 2012, Boumsong signed a two-year contract with the club, extending his stay at Panathinaikos until 2014. During the summer, Boumsong was declared vice-captain of the club for the 2012–13 season. He scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win against Motherwell in the first leg of the third qualifying round of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League.

==International career==
Boumsong made his France debut against Japan on 20 June 2003 and went with the squad for Euro 2004, although he only made a brief appearance coming on as a substitute in one game.

He established himself as a regular starter in the national team in the 2006 World Cup qualifiers, and was called up to the squad for the 2006 World Cup, but did not see any game action during the competition because of Lillian Thuram&#x27;s return to the team. Boumsong was also named in the France squad for Euro 2008.

Boumsong appeared in only one game during Euro 2008, when during the group match between France and Italy he substituted Samir Nasri. Nasri himself entered the field only 16 minutes earlier, when he replaced the injured Franck Ribéry, however when central defender Eric Abidal was sent off, French coach Raymond Domenech decided to pull off the midfielder Nasri from the field for the defender Boumsong. Four years earlier during the Euro 2004, Boumsong had been already sent to the field once as a substitute&#x27;s substitute, when he replaced William Gallas during a match against Switzerland, thus he is the first player in European Championship history to achieve this feat twice.

==Coaching career==
After retiring, Boumsong started working as a consultant for the global TV station beIN Sports. On 5 September 2018 it was confirmed, that Boumsong had been appointed assistant manager of newly hired manager Clarence Seedorf for the Cameroon national football team alongside Patrick Kluivert and Joël Epalle. He was dismissed in September 2019.

==Style of play==
Boumsong was known for his physical strength, pace and reading of the game.

==Personal life==
Boumsong acquired French nationality by naturalization on 16 January 2002.

His younger brother, Yannick Boumsong, is also a professional footballer. He is the older cousin of David Ngog.

<text>Lynn Cartwright (born Doralyn E. Cartwright; February 27, 1927 – January 2, 2004) was an American character actress known for her performance as the older version of Geena Davis&#x27; character, Dottie Hinson, in the 1992 film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;.

==Early years==

Cartwright was born in McAlester, Oklahoma, the daughter of U.S. Congressman Wilburn Cartwright and his wife Carrie (née Staggs). She studied drama at Stephens College and at American Academy in New York.

== Career ==
Her acting career spanned from 1957 to 1992 and included smaller roles in films such as &quot;Black Patch&quot; (1957), &quot;The Cry Baby Killer&quot; (1958), &quot;The Wasp Woman&quot; (1959), &quot;All the Loving Couples&quot; (1969), &quot;Son of Hitler&quot; (1978) and &quot;Lovelines&quot; (1984). For 15 years, she was involved with the Group Repertory Theater in Los Angeles.

Cartwright was chosen for the role in &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; not just because she closely resembled Geena Davis, but also because many of her mannerisms were similar.

==Personal life==
Cartwright was married to actor and screenwriter Leo Gordon from February 14, 1950, until his death on December 24, 2000. She had a daughter, Tara, and a stepdaughter.

==Death==
She died in her home from complications of dementia on January 2, 2004, aged 76, after she fractured her hip. Her ashes and those of her husband are together in a memorial display in a columbarium at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles.

<text>[[Liberalism]] and [[Classical radicalism|radicalism]] have played a role in the political history of France. The main line of conflict in France in the long nineteenth century was between monarchists (mainly Legitimists and Orléanists but also Bonapartists) and republicans (Radical-Socialists, Opportunist Republicans, and later socialists). The Orléanists, who favoured constitutional monarchy and economic liberalism, were opposed to the Republican Radicals.

The Radical Party and especially the &quot;republican&quot; parties (Democratic Republican Alliance, Republican Federation, National Centre of Independents and Peasants, Independent Republicans, Republican Party, and Liberal Democracy) have since embraced liberalism, including its economic version, and have mostly joined either the Union for a Popular Movement in 2002, later renamed The Republicans in 2015, while a minority are affiliated with the Union of Democrats and Independents, launched in 2012. Emmanuel Macron, a former member of the Socialist Party, launched En Marche! (later re-named Renaissance) in 2016 and has served as President of France since 2017.

==Background and history==
The early high points of liberalism in France were: 
*1790–1792: when Girondins and Feuillants dominated the early French Revolution;
*1848: the French Revolution of 1848, which ended the Orléans monarchy (since 1830) and led to the creation of the French Second Republic. 
In France, as in much of Southern Europe, the term &quot;liberal&quot; was used during the 19th century either to refer to the traditional liberal anti-clericalism or economic liberalism. Economic liberalism in France was long associated more with the Orléanists and with Opportunist Republicans (whose heir was the Democratic Republican Alliance), rather than the Radical Party, leading to the use of the term &quot;radical&quot; to refer to political liberalism. The Radicals tended to be more statist than most European liberals, but shared liberal values on other issues, especially support for individual liberty and secularism, while the Republicans were keener on economic liberalism than secularism.

Intellectuals played a powerful role in all the movements, for example a major spokesman for radicalism was Émile Chartier (1868–1951), who wrote under the pseudonym of &quot;Alain&quot;. He was a leading theorist of radicalism, and his influence extended through the Third and Fourth Republics. He stressed individualism, seeking to defend the citizen against the state. He warned against all forms of power – military, clerical, and economic. To oppose them, he exalted the small farmer, the small shopkeeper, the small town, and the little man. He idealized country life and saw Paris as a dangerous font of power.

After World War II, the Republicans gathered in the liberal-conservative National Centre of Independents and Peasants, from which the conservative-liberal Independent Republicans was formed in 1962. The originally centre-left Radical Party was a declining force and joined the centre-right in 1972, causing the split of the left-wing faction and the foundation of the Radical Party of the Left, closely associated to the Socialist Party. The former was later associated with the Union for a Popular Movement.
In 1978 both the Republican Party (successor of the Independent Republicans) and the Radical Party were founding components, along with the Christian-democratic Centre of Social Democrats, of the Union for French Democracy, an alliance of non-Gaullist centre-right forces. The Republican Party, re-founded as Liberal Democracy and re-shaped as an economic liberal party, left the federation in 1998 and was later merged, along with the Radical Party, into the liberal-conservative Union for a Popular Movement (later The Republicans) in 2002. The Radicals and several former Republicans launched the Union of Democrats and Independents in 2012.

In 2016 Emmanuel Macron, a former member of the Socialist Party, launched La République En Marche!, a liberal party, and was elected President of France in the 2017 presidential election. The party formed an alliance with the Democratic Movement, established in 2017 as a successor of the Union for French Democracy, stripped of most former Republicans, who joined the Union for a Popular Movement (later The Republicans) or the Union of Democrats and Independents.

<text>A periodization of capitalism seeks to distinguish stages of development that help understanding of features of capitalism through time. The best-known periodizations that have been proposed distinguish these stages as:

#Early / monopoly / state monopoly capitalism (Sweezy)
#Free trade / monopoly / finance capitalism (Hilferding)
#Early capitalism (primitive accumulation) / colonialism / imperialism (Hobson, Lenin, Bukharin) 
#Extensive stage / intensive stage / late capitalism (Aglietta)

The Marxist periodization of capitalism into the stages: agricultural capitalism, merchant capitalism, industrial capitalism and state capitalism.

Another periodization includes merchant capitalism, industrial and finance capitalism, and global capitalism.

<text>Edwin Arnold Hansford (December 1, 1895 – March 12, 1959) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada, and served as leader of that province&#x27;s Co-operative Commonwealth Federation between 1948 and 1952.

Hansford was born in the Annapolis Valley region of Nova Scotia. He served overseas in World War I for four-and-a-half years, and subsequently worked for Canadian National Railways.

Hansford ran as a candidate of the Independent Labour Party in the federal riding of St. Boniface, in the 1930 federal election, but was defeated. Five years later, he was again defeated as a candidate of the CCF (successor party to the ILP in Manitoba). Hansford was more successful in municipal politics — he became a St. Boniface alderman in 1931, and served until 1945.

Hansford was also a member of the provincial CCF executive, although his first attempt to enter provincial politics was unsuccessful. The CCF had joined Premier John Bracken&#x27;s coalition ministry in 1940, but was subsequently marginalized by the Liberal-Conservative alliance that dominated the government. Demoralized, the party won only three seats members in the 1941 election. Running in provincial St. Boniface riding, Hansford was defeated by almost 1000 votes.

In 1943, the CCF left the coalition and was enjoying a higher level of popular support. The party posed a credible threat to the Liberal-Conservative coalition in the 1945 election, and while the overall results were disappointing (only ten Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) elected out of 57 seats), Hansford was able to carry St. Boniface by more than 2000 votes over his nearest opponent.

Seymour Farmer resigned as party leader in 1947. The CCF caucus chose Hansford to lead the CCF in the legislature and, the following year, Hansford was confirmed leader at the party&#x27;s convention without opposition. Five others were nominated from the floor for the position but all declined to stand. He was the first leader of Manitoba&#x27;s &quot;parliamentary left&quot; from outside of the City of Winnipeg proper.

The late 1940s were a period of decline for most left-wing groups within Canada, and the Manitoba CCF did not escape this pattern. The party was particularly plagued by divisions over cooperation with the province&#x27;s Communists. The party leadership was universally against such cooperation, but many rank-and-file members (and some MLAs) supported it. The result was that the party was viewed with suspicion by both &quot;centre-left&quot; voters and more committed leftists. Hansford himself was not regarded as a strong leader, often being upstaged by MLAs Donovan Swailes and Lloyd Stinson.

Prior to the 1949 election, Hansford publicly rebuked two members of his caucus (Wilbert Doneleyko and Beresford Richards) who had condemned international negotiations for what became the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This resulted in a backlash from the left wing of the CCF, which generally opposed the foreign policies of American President Harry Truman.

The CCF ran only 26 candidates in the election of 1949, and won seven seats. Hansford was re-elected in St. Boniface, but finished a discouraging second in what was now a two-member riding (members elected by preferential balloting). He resigned as party leader in 1952, and did not seek re-election in 1953. He subsequently returned to municipal politics, serving as mayor of St. Boniface.

Hansford died in Winnipeg in 1959.

<text>HMS &quot;La Hogue&quot; was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 3 October 1811 at Deptford. She was named after the 1692 Battle of La Hogue. &quot;The &quot;La Hogue&quot; of 1811 [...] sported a green and chocolate lion, its grinning mouth displaying rows of white teeth and a huge red tongue.&quot;

==History==
During the War of 1812, while under the command of Thomas Bladen Capel, on 16 May 1813 &quot;Hogue&quot; recaptured and sent to Halifax, Nova Scotia, the packet . &quot;Ann&quot; had been on her way from Jamaica to Halifax when the American privateer &quot;Yorktown&quot; had captured her. However, the American privateer &quot;Young Teazer&quot; again captured &quot;Ann&quot; and sent her into Portland, Maine.

Later, &quot;La Hogue&quot; successfully trapped &quot;Young Teazer&quot; off the coast of Nova Scotia, British North America.

On 16 August 1813 &quot;La Hogue&quot; captured the Portuguese ship &quot;Flor de Mar&quot;. At the time was in sight.

&quot;La Hogue&quot; was driven ashore at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 12 November 1813 during a storm. She was refloated, repaired, and returned to service.

From 7–8 April 1814, ships&#x27; boats of the &quot;La Hogue&quot;, , &quot;Maidstone&quot; and attacked Pettipague point. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;8 Apr Boat Service 1814&quot; to all surviving claimants from the action. The raid was commanded by Coote, who was promoted as a result of the successful outcome, as was Lieutenant Pyne of the &quot;La Hogue&quot; who assisted him.

In September 1814, &quot;La Hogue&quot; anchored near the Scituate Light station on the coast of Massachusetts with the intent of sending a raiding party into the town. Rebecca and Abigail Bates, the lighthouse keeper&#x27;s daughters, repulsed the attack by playing a drum and a fife that had been left at the station, simulating the approach of the town militia.

&quot;La Hogue&quot; was converted into a screw-propelled steamship frigate in 1850. From 1852, she acted as a guard-ship at Devonport under the command of Captain William Ramsay and saw her final service, still under Ramsay, on duties in the Baltic Sea during the Crimean War. On 18 September 1855, she ran aground off Renskär, Sweden and was severely damaged. She was refloated with the assistance of three gunboats after her lower deck guns were taken out.

She was eventually broken up in 1865.

<text>Man and Superman is a four-act drama written by George Bernard Shaw in 1903, in response to a call for Shaw to write a play based on the Don Juan theme. &quot;Man and Superman&quot; opened at the Royal Court Theatre in London on 21 May 1905 as a four-act play produced by the Stage Society, and then by John Eugene Vedrenne and Harley Granville-Barker on 23 May, without Act III (&quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot;). A part of the third act (Scene 2), was performed when the drama was staged on 4 June 1907 at the Royal Court. The play was not performed in its entirety until 1915, when the Travelling Repertory Company played it at the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh.

== Summary ==
Mr. Whitefield has recently died, and his will indicates that his daughter Ann should be left in the care of two men, Roebuck Ramsden and John Tanner. Ramsden, a venerable old man, distrusts John Tanner, an eloquent youth with revolutionary ideas, whom Shaw&#x27;s stage directions describe as &quot;prodigiously fluent of speech, restless, excitable (mark the snorting nostril and the restless blue eye, just the thirty-secondth of an inch too wide open), possibly a little mad&quot;. In spite of what Ramsden says, Ann accepts Tanner as her guardian, though Tanner does not want the position at all. She also challenges Tanner&#x27;s revolutionary beliefs with her own ideas. Despite Tanner&#x27;s professed dedication to anarchy, he is unable to disarm Ann&#x27;s charm, and she ultimately persuades him to marry her, choosing him over her more persistent suitor, a young man, Tanner&#x27;s friend, named Octavius Robinson.

== List of characters ==
* Hector Malone, Sr., an elderly gentleman who has worked hard throughout his life to attain a high social status in which he now takes pride.
* Ann Whitefield, a young woman, graceful, somewhat enigmatic. She corresponds to the character Doña Ana in the Don Juan myth (in Act III, Shaw&#x27;s stage direction refers to Doña Ana de Ulloa as &quot;so handsome that in the radiance into which her dull yellow halo has suddenly lightened one might almost mistake her for Ann Whitefield&quot;).
* Henry Straker, chauffeur with a cockney accent (representing Leporello from the Mozart opera).
* John Tanner, also called &quot;Jack Tanner&quot;, a well-educated, well-spoken man who takes everything seriously, including himself; a &quot;political firebrand and confirmed bachelor.&quot; Allegedly the descendant of Don Juan, as well as the modern representation of the Don Juan character (in Act III, Shaw notes Don Juan&#x27;s resemblance to Tanner: &quot;Besides, in the brief lifting of his face, now hidden by his hat brim, there was a curious suggestion of Tanner. A more critical, fastidious, handsome face, paler and colder, without Tanner&#x27;s impetuous credulity and enthusiasm, and without a touch of his modern plutocratic vulgarity, but still a resemblance, even an identity&quot;). The very name &quot;John Tanner&quot; is an anglicisation of the Spanish name &quot;Juan Tenorio&quot;, which is the full name of Don Juan. 
* Violet Robinson, sister of Octavius Robinson. She has been secretly married to Hector Malone, Jr.
* Mrs. Whitefield, mother of Ann, and widow of the late Mr. Whitefield.
* Susan Ramsden, the spinster sister of Roebuck Ramsden.
* Hector Malone, Jr., an American gentleman who is secretly married to Violet Robinson.
* Octavius Robinson, an amiable young man who is in love with Ann Whitefield. Brother to Violet Robinson. He represents &quot;Don Ottavio&quot; from the Don Juan myth.
* Roebuck Ramsden, an aging civil reformer who was friend to the late Mr. Whitefield. He corresponds to the statue in the Don Juan myth, who is in turn the representation of the spirit of Don Gonzalo, the father of Doña Ana (in Act III, Shaw writes of The Statue, &quot;His voice, save for a much more distinguished intonation, is so like the voice of Roebuck Ramsden&quot;).
* Mendoza, an anarchist who collaborates with Tanner. Mendoza is the &quot;President of the League of the Sierra,&quot; a self-described brigand and a Jew. He corresponds to Shaw&#x27;s conception of the Devil as he would be portrayed in the Don Juan myth (Shaw writes of &quot;The Devil&quot; in Act III: &quot;A scarlet halo begins to glow; and into it the Devil rises, very Mephistophelean, and not at all unlike Mendoza, though not so interesting&quot;).

== Interpretation and performances ==

=== Don Juan Play ===
The long third act of the play, which shows Don Juan himself having a conversation with several characters in Hell, is often cut. Charles A. Berst observes of Act III:

Paradoxically, the act is both extraneous and central to the drama which surrounds it. It can be dispensed with, and usually is, on grounds that it is just too long to include in an already full-length play. More significantly, it is in some aspects a digression, operates in a different mode from the rest of the material, delays the immediate well-made story line, and much of its subject matter is already implicit in the rest of the play. The play performs well without it.

&quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot; consists of a philosophical debate between Don Juan (played by the same actor who plays Jack Tanner), and the Devil, with Doña Ana (Ann) and the Statue of Don Gonzalo, Ana&#x27;s father (Roebuck Ramsden) looking on. This third act is often performed separately as a play in its own right, most famously during the 1950s in a stage production featuring Charles Boyer as Don Juan, Charles Laughton as the Devil, Cedric Hardwicke as the Commander and Agnes Moorehead as Doña Ana. This version was also released as a spoken word album on LP, but is yet to appear on CD. In 1974–1975, Kurt Kasznar, Myrna Loy, Edward Mulhare and Ricardo Montalbán toured nationwide in John Houseman&#x27;s reprise of the production, playing 158 cities in six months.

=== Ideas ===
Although &quot;Man and Superman&quot; can be performed as a light comedy of manners, Shaw intended the drama to be something much deeper, as suggested by the title, which comes from Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophical ideas about the &quot;Übermensch&quot; (although Shaw distances himself from Nietzsche by placing the philosopher at the very end of a long list of influences). As Shaw notes in his &quot;Epistle Dedicatory&quot; (dedication to theatre critic Arthur Bingham Walkley) he wrote the play as &quot;a pretext for a propaganda of our own views of life&quot;. The plot centres on John Tanner, author of &quot;The Revolutionist&#x27;s Handbook and Pocket Companion&quot;, which is published with the play as a 58-page appendix. Both in the play and in the &quot;Handbook&quot; Shaw takes Nietzsche&#x27;s theme that mankind is evolving, through natural selection, towards &quot;superman&quot; and develops the argument to suggest that the prime mover in selection is the woman: Ann Whitefield makes persistent efforts to entice Tanner to marry her yet he remains a bachelor. As Shaw himself puts it: &quot;Don Juan had changed his sex and become Dona Juana, breaking out of the Doll&#x27;s House and asserting herself as an individual&quot;. This is an explicit, intended reversal of Tirso de Molina&#x27;s play &quot;The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest&quot;, more widely known as the source of Da Ponte&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;; here Ann, representing Doña Ana, is the predator – &quot;Don Juan is the quarry instead of the huntsman,&quot; as Shaw notes.

Ann is referred to as &quot;the Life Force&quot; and represents Shaw&#x27;s view that in every culture, it is the women who force the men to marry them rather than the men who take the initiative. Sally Peters Vogt proposes: &quot;Thematically, the fluid Don Juan myth becomes a favorable milieu for Creative Evolution&quot;, and that &quot;the legend ... becomes in &quot;Man and Superman&quot; the vehicle through which Shaw communicates his cosmic philosophy&quot;.

<doc id="878168" wikidata="Q1496982" url="?curid=878168" title="List of areas disputed by Canada and the United States">
<text>Canada and the United States have one land dispute over Machias Seal Island (off the coast of Maine), and four other maritime disputes in the Arctic and Pacific. The two countries share the longest international border in the world and have a long history of disputes about the border&#x27;s demarcation (see Canada–United States border).

==Current disputes==
* Machias Seal Island—about —and North Rock (Maine and New Brunswick), located in what is known as the &quot;Grey Zone&quot; (about in size), is occupied by a Canadian lighthouse but claimed by the United States and visited by U.S. tour boats. The area is patrolled by the Canadian and US Coast Guard, but only the Canadian Coast Guard occupies the lighthouse. The unresolved maritime boundary breaks into two elements: the sovereignty of the island and the location of the maritime boundary taking into account who is the rightful owner of the island.
* Strait of Juan de Fuca (Washington state and British Columbia): At the mouth of the strait, both countries declared fishing zones in 1977. Each country used a mildly differing method to define an equidistant water boundary. The two separate water areas in dispute amount to about .
* Yukon–Alaska dispute, Beaufort Sea (Alaska and Yukon) Canada supports an extension into the sea of the land boundary between Yukon and Alaska. The U.S. does not but instead supports a line equidistant concerning the coastline. Such a demarcation means that a minor portion claimed by Canada as Northwest Territories Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is also claimed by the US because the EEZ boundary between Northwest Territories and Yukon follows a straight north-south line into the sea. The U.S. claims would create a triangular-shaped EEZ for Yukon/Canada. The disputed area is about in size. The precise translation of a phrase in the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825, which was written in French, is part of the issue. The convention makes reference to the 141st Meridian &quot;in its prolongation as far as the Frozen ocean.&quot; The authentic text is in French: &quot;&quot;dans son &quot;[sic]&quot; prolongation jusqu’à la Mer Glaciale.&quot;&quot; The precise question is the interpretation that should be given to the preposition &quot;jusqu’à.&quot; Specifically, is it inclusive or exclusive of the object to which the preposition relates?
* Northwest Passage: Canada claims the passage as part of Canadian Internal Waters, while the United States regards it as an international strait (a strait accommodating open international traffic). The Canadian Coast Guard and Royal Canadian Navy have commissioned a new ice breaker along with multiple offshore patrol ships to guard and patrol the waters.
* Dixon Entrance (Alaska and British Columbia) contains two water areas that are mutually claimed by Canada and the U.S. A line known as the &quot;A-B&quot; Line was defined in a 1903 arbitration decision on the Alaska/British Columbia boundary. The court specified the initial boundary point (Point &quot;A&quot;) at the northern end of Dixon Entrance and designated Point &quot;B&quot; 72 NM to the east. Canada relies on the &quot;A-B&quot; line as rendering nearly all of Dixon Entrance as its internal waters. The U.S. does not recognize the &quot;A-B&quot; line as an official boundary, instead regarding it as allocating sovereignty over the land masses within the Dixon Entrance, with Canada&#x27;s land south of the line. The U.S. regards the waters as subject to international marine law, and in 1977 it defined an equidistant territorial line throughout Dixon Entrance, mainly to the south of the &quot;A-B&quot; line. The intersecting lines create four separate water areas with differing claim status. The two areas south of the &quot;A-B&quot; line (about and in size) are claimed by both countries. The other two water areas are north of the &quot;A-B&quot; line and are not claimed by either country. The two unclaimed areas are about and in size. In addition, Nunez Rocks is a low-tide elevation (LTE) (&quot;bare at half-tide&quot;) that lies south of the &quot;A-B&quot; Line, surrounded by the sea territory claimed by the U.S. The United States has not ratified the Law of the Sea Treaty, although it adheres to most of its principles as customary international law. Under the treaty, LTEs may be used as basepoints for a territorial sea, and the U.S. uses Nunez Rocks as a basepoint. As a non-signatory, however, nothing is preventing the U.S. from claiming areas beyond the scope of the Law of the Sea Treaty. The fact remains that, for about half of each day, above-water territory that Canada regards as Canadian is surrounded by sea territory that the U.S. has declared to be American.


==Historical disputes==
* Alaska boundary dispute (Alaska/British Columbia and Yukon) lasted 1821 to 1903
** Atlin District
** Bering Sea Arbitration lasted 1881 to 1893.
* Aroostook War (Maine/New Brunswick), a bloodless dispute that lasted from 1838 to 1839, leading to the Webster–Ashburton negotiations.
** Republic of Madawaska (Maine/New Brunswick), putative state in 1827, within the territory that became part of New Brunswick in 1842.
* Oregon boundary dispute (Columbia District and New Caledonia/Oregon Country)
** Pig War (Colony of Vancouver Island/Washington Territory) took place in 1859
* Republic of Indian Stream (New Hampshire/Lower Canada) unrecognized state from 1832 to 1835. Now part of New Hampshire.

<text>Bathurst Island is one of the Queen Elizabeth Islands in Nunavut, Canada. It is a member of the Arctic Archipelago. An uninhabited island, the area is estimated at , long and from to to wide, making it Canada&#x27;s 13th largest island. It is located between Devon Island and Cornwallis Island in the east, and Melville Island in the west. Four small islands of Cameron, Vanier, Massey and Alexander lie in its northwest.

The island is low-lying with few parts higher than in elevation. The highest point is at Stokes Mountain in the Stokes Range. This in turn forms part of the Arctic Cordillera mountain system. Good soil conditions produce abundant vegetation and support a more prolific wildlife population than other Arctic islands.

The island contains both the International Biological Program site Polar Bear Pass and Qausuittuq National Park.

==History==
The island was first inhabited by Independence I culture peoples around 2000 BC. They were followed by Independence II, Pre-Dorset, and Dorset cultures. On the eastern coast lies Brooman Point Village. The site has been occupied by the Dorset, Paleo-Eskimo and the Thule people around AD 1000, conceivably during a warmer climate episode. At the time of European arrival in the 1800s, nobody was living there, but Inuit in the region likely knew of its abundant wildlife, and possibly travelled there on hunting trips. William Edward Parry was the first European to discover the island in 1819, charting its southern coast. It was named for Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst, British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1812–1827. Robert Dawes Aldrich charted much of its west coast in 1851, while George Henry Richards and Sherard Osborn charted its north coast in 1853.

The Earth&#x27;s North magnetic pole tracked northwards across Bathurst and Seymour Islands during the 1960s and 1970s. The Canadian National Museum of Natural Sciences, led by renowned Arctic biologist Stewart D. Macdonald, curator of Vertebrate Ethology, established a permanent High Arctic Research Station there in 1973. Located on the Goodsir River in Polar Bear Pass, the station was staffed seasonally until the 1980s.

<text>Stephen J. Dobyns (born February 19, 1941) is an American poet and novelist born in Orange, New Jersey.

==Life==

Dobyns was born on February 19, 1941, in Orange, New Jersey, to Lester L., an Episcopal minister, and Barbara Johnston Dobyns. Dobyns was raised in New Jersey, Michigan, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. He was educated at Shimer College, transferred to and graduated from Wayne State University in 1964, and received an MFA from the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1967. He has worked as a reporter for the &quot;Detroit News&quot;.

He has taught at various academic institutions, including Sarah Lawrence College, the Warren Wilson College MFA Program for Writers, the University of Iowa, Syracuse University, and Boston University.

In 1995, as a professor of English at Syracuse University, he was accused of sexual harassment after an incident in which he also threw a drink at his accuser and made a rude remark about her in front of numerous witnesses. Syracuse University suspended him for two years, after which he resigned. Francine Prose defended him—as did university professor/writers Tobias Wolff, Hayden Carruth, and Agha Shahid Ali.

==Works==

Dobyns has written 24 novels in a variety of genres, as well as 14 poetry collections and two non-fiction works about the craft of poetry.

In much of his work, Dobyns uses the ridiculous and the absurd as vehicles to introduce more profound meditations on life, love, and art. His journalistic training has strongly informed this voice.

His poetry has won numerous accolades, including a Lamont Poetry Selection (&quot;Concurring Beasts&quot;), a National Poetry Series selection (&quot;Black Dog, Red Dog&quot;), and a Melville Cane Award (&quot;Cemetery Nights&quot;).

His novel &quot;Cold Dog Soup&quot; (1985) has been made into two films, the American &quot;Cold Dog Soup&quot; and the French &quot;Doggy Bag&quot;. &quot;The Two Deaths of Señora Puccini&quot; (1988) was made into the 1995 film &quot;Two Deaths&quot;. The movie &quot;Wild Turkey&quot; is based on a short story by Dobyns.

He has written many detective stories about a private detective named Charlie Bradshaw who works out of Saratoga Springs in upstate New York. Bradshaw is unusual as a private eye protagonist, an ordinary man who was once a police officer. All the books have the word &quot;Saratoga&quot; in the title.

In the comic novel &quot;The Wrestler&#x27;s Cruel Study&quot; (1993), the protagonist roams through a modern cityscape governed by fairy-tale rituals, searching for his missing fiancée. He is alternately aided or hindered by a Friedrich Nietzsche-quoting manager and his Hegelian nemesis, to find that his wrestling matches are choreographed by a shadowy organization that enacts their various Gnostic theological debates through the pageantry and panoply of the ring. He eventually learns to resolve his own dualistic nature and determine who he is despite the role he plays.

&quot;The Church of Dead Girls&quot; (1997) is a novel about a small town&#x27;s hysterical response to the mysterious disappearance of three of its teenaged girls.

&quot;Boy in the Water&quot; (1999) is a novel about events in a secluded private school in the United States.

Jenny Hilborne wrote in &quot;New York Journal of Books&quot; that &quot;The Burn Palace&quot; (2013) &quot;is an intriguing fictional mystery set in the town of Brewster, Rhode Island, and includes elements of the supernatural, satanism, and other alternate religions, including neo-pagans, Wicca, and witchcraft...mysterious and engaging . . .”

&quot;Is Fat Bob Dead Yet?&quot; was named one of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;″s Best Mysteries of 2015.

<text>Eando Binder () is a pen name used by two mid-20th-century science fiction authors, Earl Andrew Binder (1904–1966) and his brother [[Otto Binder]] (1911–1974). The name is derived from their first initials &quot;(E and O Binder).&quot; Under the Eando name, the Binders wrote some published science fiction, including stories featuring a heroic robot named Adam Link. The first Adam Link story, published in 1939, is titled &quot;I, Robot&quot;.

==Overview==
By 1939, Otto had taken over all of the writing, leaving Earl to act as his literary agent. Under his own name, Otto wrote for the Captain Marvel line of comic books published by Fawcett Comics (1941–1953) and the Superman line for Detective Comics (1948–1969), as well as numerous other publishers, with credited stories numbering over 4400. The pen-name Eando Binder is also credited with over 160 comic book stories.

Otto Binder was born in Chicago and moved to New York in 1936. He worked as a literary agent for Otis Adelbert Kline for a year, then became a free-lance writer. He sold his first story in 1930 and 129 more during the next decade. He lived in Englewood, New Jersey, from 1944 until he moved to Chestertown in 1968. Otto Binder attended Crane College in Chicago and told &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; he was once &quot;an amateur chemist with a home laboratory.&quot;

He wrote comic-book scripts, novels, and magazine articles. His books included &quot;Riddles of Astronomy, Careers in Space,&quot; and &quot;Mankind, Child of the Stars.&quot;

He was a member of the Journal of American Literature, the American Rocket Society, the American Interplanetary Society, the National Space Flight Association, and the Aerospace Writers Association.

He died October 14, 1974, and was survived by his wife, Ione; a brother, Jack, and two sisters, Marie Hackstock of Chicago and Teresa Samuelson of Estes Park, Colorado.

Earl Binder worked as a mechanical parts inspector for a &quot;large industrial concern&quot; during the 1930s.

<text>Bay Ferries Limited, or simply, Bay Ferries, is a ferry company operating in eastern Canada and is headquartered in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada. It is a subsidiary of Northumberland Ferries Limited and a sister company to the defunct Bay Ferries Great Lakes Limited.

Bay Ferries began operations in 1997 upon being awarded the operating licenses for ferry routes in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine which were being discontinued by federal Crown corporation Marine Atlantic as part of cost-cutting measures.

==Bay of Fundy==
Bay Ferries operates the ferry service across the Bay of Fundy between Saint John, New Brunswick, and Digby, Nova Scotia, using the vessel MV &quot;Fundy Rose&quot;.

This ferry service is a continuation of steamship service dating to the 19th century, expanded upon by the Dominion Atlantic Railway in the early 20th century and subsequently the Canadian Pacific (CP). The service originally operated from dockside rail facilities at Long Wharf in Saint John and the current public wharf in Digby.

The current terminals in Saint John and Digby were constructed in 1969 by the federal government under an agreement with Canadian Pacific (CP) and the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. CP was to build a new ferry, the MV &quot;Princess of Acadia&quot; (built in 1971), the federal government would construct and own the new ferry terminals, and the provincial governments would construct new roads to link the terminals with the respective highway networks. If CP ever encountered an operating loss, it was agreed that the federal government would take over responsibility for the service.

The service became unprofitable for CP in 1974 and the Federal Government stepped in, providing an operating subsidy to maintain the service. In 1976, the service (and the vessel &quot;Princess of Acadia&quot;) were transferred to Canadian National and in 1977 was grouped under a separate subsidiary CN Marine. In 1986 this subsidiary was made a separate Crown corporation, Marine Atlantic.

Bay Ferries has continued to operate the year-round service since 1997, using &quot;Princess of Acadia&quot; until 2015 and then &quot;Fundy Rose&quot;. The vessels, along with the ferry terminals, are owned by the Government of Canada. The crossing time is approximately 3 hours.

===Operating Subsidies===
Although the federal government owns the ferry terminals and vessels, the operation of this inter-provincial ferry service had been one of the few in Canada which was unsubsidized. On June 30, 2006, Bay Ferries announced plans to discontinue the &quot;Princess of Acadia&quot; service effective October 31, 2006 citing a 25% decrease in passenger totals since 1998. The announcement met with widespread opposition, with a group of local business owners, concerned citizens and ferry company employees organizing a &quot;Save The Ferry&quot; committee to help save the service. Over 130 jobs would be directly terminated as well as hundreds (possibly thousands) indirectly.

The federal government, which still owns the vessel and terminals, as well as the provincial government of Nova Scotia and municipalities on both sides, looked at possible solutions. The Nova Scotia government and Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency offered a combined $6 million to subsidize the service, with additional funding expected from New Brunswick. A number of subsequent government agreements since 2006 have provided operating subsidies to help keep the ferry in service. The most recent subsidy agreement in 2014 came shortly after an announcement that the federal government would purchase a replacement vessel for &quot;Princess of Acadia&quot;. This new vessel, &quot;Fundy Rose&quot; was acquired in late 2014 and entered service between Saint John and Digby in July 2015.

==Gulf of Maine==


Bay Ferries operated ferry service across the Gulf of Maine from Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, to Bar Harbor, Maine, and from Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, to Portland, Maine, using a high speed catamaran ferry service using the marketing name The Cat.

This ferry route was initiated in 1955 by the Government of Canada at the insistence of tourism operators and fish exporters in southwestern Nova Scotia. Throughout the 19th century and early 20th century, steamship service from Yarmouth to New York City, Boston and Portland, Maine, had been provided by various operators, lastly the Dominion Atlantic Railway, subsequently Canadian Pacific. The resurrected service in 1955 saw new ferry terminals constructed in Yarmouth and Bar Harbor and used the newly commissioned ferry MV &quot;Bluenose&quot;, named after Nova Scotia&#x27;s famous racing schooner &quot;Bluenose&quot;.

The service was operated by Canadian National and in 1977 was included in the CN reorganization which created CN Marine. In 1982 a newer vessel MV &quot;Stena Jutlandica&quot; was purchased and renamed MV &quot;Bluenose&quot; (replacing the previous vessel). In 1986 CN Marine became Marine Atlantic which continued to operate the service, although it was scaled back to a seasonal May–October operation by the mid-1990s. Since the Gulf of Maine service operated to the United States, the vessel was not owned by the Government of Canada and was solely the responsibility of CN and later Marine Atlantic.

Following government-mandated service cutbacks to Marine Atlantic in the mid-1990s, Bay Ferries was formed as a subsidiary of Northumberland Ferries Limited and successfully bid for the right to operate the Yarmouth-Bar Harbor route. Upon taking control of the operation in 1997, Bay Ferries continued to operate the MV &quot;Bluenose&quot; that year, after which it was sold.

Bay Ferries entered into a purchase agreement in late 1997 with Incat in Hobart, Australia, for the &quot;Incat 046&quot;, a wave-piercing catamaran ferry operating on the Melbourne-Devonport service by Spirit of Tasmania) under the brand name &quot;Devil Cat.&quot; Upon acquisition of the vessel in 1998, Bay Ferries began using the term &quot;The Cat&quot; for its Yarmouth-Bar Harbor service in logos on the vessel and in Bay Ferries marketing material. &quot;The Cat&quot; is merely the marketing name for the ferry service operated by Bay Ferries, and not the name of the vessel, which remains HSC &quot;Incat 046&quot;. The introduction of HSC &quot;Incat 046&quot; to the Gulf of Maine met with great publicity and interest among Canadian and American media as this was the first, and currently the fastest (41 knots), large-capacity high-speed ferry in North America, cutting the trip time between the two ports from six hours on a conventional vessel to less than three hours. In 2002, &quot;Incat 046&quot; was sold and &quot;The Cat&quot; replaced it.

The high speed ferry operated between the ports in 2 hours and 30 minutes, compared with a crossing time of over 6 hours using a conventional ferry vessel. The service was seasonal and did not operate during the late fall, winter and early spring when severe ocean storms could inhibit crossings, although the conventional vessels were year-round services for many years.

The Government of Canada maintains ownership of the ferry terminals in Yarmouth (through Transport Canada) and Bar Harbor (through Marine Atlantic) but has leased the management and operating rights to Bay Ferries.

In spring 2005 rival Gulf of Maine ferry operator Scotia Prince Cruises announced that it was cancelling its Portland, Maine-Yarmouth service offered by a conventional vessel, &quot;Scotia Prince&quot;, as a result of toxic mould problems at its ferry terminal in Portland, the old Portland Marine Terminal. The city of Portland was in the process of constructing a replacement ferry terminal, but it assumed that financial difficulties would prevent Scotia Prince Cruises from returning to the Yarmouth service and entered into discussions with Bay Ferries about expanding its Gulf of Maine service to include Portland, in addition to Bar Harbor. An announcement was made in late summer that Bay Ferries would include &quot;The Cat&quot; service to both ports from Yarmouth beginning in 2006 using HSC &quot;Incat 059&quot;.

Beginning with the 2006 and continuing into the 2007 operating seasons, the Government of Nova Scotia provided an annual $1.5 million subsidy to Bay Ferries due to declining passenger revenue and increased fuel expenditures. The subsidy was increased by the provincial government for the 2008 operating season to $6.0 million to account for rising costs and further declines in revenue. It is unknown how much of a subsidy was provided for the 2009 operating season but it is believed to surpass the 2008 amount. The company has received subsidies totaling $18.9 million since the fall of 2007.

On December 18, 2009 Bay Ferries announced that it was ending its Gulf of Maine service from Yarmouth to Bar Harbor and Portland after the Government of Nova Scotia ended the subsidies, resulting in approximately 120 jobs being lost. Bay Ferries had been seeking approximately $6.0 million for the 2010 operating season but the provincial government declined, citing financial difficulty. The disposition of HSC &quot;Incat 059&quot; is unknown.

As of June, 2010, HSC &quot;Incat 059&quot; could often be seen docked at its former terminal in Bar Harbor. It has since been purchased by Taiwan and is now called Hai Xia Hao and is a passenger / vehicle ferry operated by Fujian Cross Strait Ferry between Taichung and Pingtan Island.

Ferry service between Maine and Nova Scotia was nonexistent during the following years. During the 2014 and 2015 seasons, a separate company, Nova Star Cruises, operated a cruiseferry between Portland and Yarmouth, though the company closed at the end of the 2015 season and the vessel was sold.

In March 2016, only a few months after the closure of Nova Star Cruises, Bay Ferries Limited announced that it had reached an agreement with the U.S. Maritime Administration and the U.S. Navy for a multi-year charter of a new high-speed catamaran, HST-2. The vessel will be operated for a passenger/vehicle ferry service between Portland, Maine and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. The vessel will continue to be named HST-2, but the service and vessel will be branded as &quot;The CAT&quot; to align with the previous branding. The vessel underwent a refit at a shipyard in South Carolina and the service started on June 15, 2016.

In late 2018, Bay Ferries announced plans to change the ferry’s port in Maine from Portland to Bar Harbor. Service along this new route was originally expected to begin in summer 2019, but was delayed due to construction work at the Bar Harbor marina. Service was then cancelled during both the 2020 and 2021 seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;The CAT&quot; resumed Bar Harbor service for the 2022 season.

==Trinidad and Tobago==
Beginning on January 10, 2005, Bay Ferries started operating HSC &quot;Incat 059&quot; under a wet charter to provide a ferry service in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago chartered the vessel and a Bay Ferries crew for six months to service the country&#x27;s ferry route considered a &#x27;sea bridge&#x27; between the islands of Trinidad and Tobago.

Under the terms of the charter, the government agreed to pay Bay Ferries US$23,800 per day to ferry persons, goods, and vehicles between the two islands. The HSC &quot;Incat 059&quot; (still using its service trademark &quot;The Cat&quot;) was taken from its seasonal layup to the Caribbean before returning to the Gulf of Maine for its regular six-month summer schedule. During the winter of 2003–2004 HSC &quot;Incat 059&quot; briefly tested a route between Florida and the Bahamas.

The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has been in the process of trying to purchase a fast ferry to serve the inter-island route all year long. The other vessel used by Bay Ferries in Trinidad and Tobago service during May–October is the HSC &quot;Incat 046&quot;, now known as the &quot;Lynx&quot; from New Zealand and formerly used by Bay Ferries on the Gulf of Maine before the &quot;Imcat 059&quot; (See above).

On April 21, 2005 HSC &quot;Incat 059&quot; became an indispensable link between the two islands after a Tobago Express aircraft had problems with its landing gear over the &#x27;air bridge&#x27; route. The entire Tobago Express fleet was grounded for several days pending inspections to the fleet and citizens were left depending fully on the high speed ferry service.

During the 2004–2005 winter season HSC &quot;Incat 059&quot; ferried almost 175,000 passengers and a total of about 25,000 vehicles between the islands.

The Government of Trinidad and Tobago announced that HSC &quot;Incat 059&quot; would return to offer inter-island service in November 2005 until the following May.
The government has since purchased two new Incat fast ferries, the 91m Incat 046 and the 98m T&amp;T Spirit (Incat 060) which are currently managed by Bay Ferries Management Limited

<text>Chartwell is a country house near Westerham, Kent, in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Sir Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was out of political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government&#x27;s response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes — both with his own hands — and painted. During the Second World War, Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again prime minister, the house became Churchill&#x27;s refuge when he suffered a debilitating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28 Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965.

The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382, the property then called Well-street was owned by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill&#x27;s purchase described it as an imposing mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, &quot;the most beautiful and charming&quot; Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house.

In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill&#x27;s friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retained a life-tenancy. After Churchill&#x27;s death, Lady Churchill surrendered her rights to the house and it was opened to the public by the Trust in 1966. A Grade I listed building, for its historical significance rather than its architectural merit, Chartwell has become among the Trust&#x27;s most popular properties; 232,000 people visited the house in 2016, the fiftieth anniversary of its opening.

The earliest recorded mention of the land dates to 1362 when it was sold by a William At-Well. The origin of the name is the Chart Well, a spring to the north of the current house, Chart being an Old English word for rough ground. The site had been built upon at least as early as the 16th century, when the estate was called Well Street. Henry VIII was reputed to have stayed in the house during his courtship of Anne Boleyn at nearby Hever Castle. Elements of the Tudor house are still visible; the Historic England listing for Chartwell notes that 16th- (or possibly 17th-) century brickwork can be seen in some of the external walls. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the house was used as a farmhouse and its ownership was subject to frequent change. On 22 September 1836, the property was auctioned at Cheapside, advertised as &quot;a suitable abode for a genteel family&quot;. In 1848 it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, a former MP; the Campbell Colquhouns were a family of Scottish landowners, lawyers and politicians. The original farmhouse was enlarged and modified during their ownership, including the addition of the stepped gables, a Scottish baronial genuflection to the land of their fathers. By the time of the sale to Churchill, it was, in the words of Oliver Garnett, author of the 2008 guidebook to the house, an example of &quot;Victorian architecture at its least attractive, a ponderous red-brick country mansion of tile-hung gables and poky oriel windows&quot;. Tilden, in his &quot;highly unreliable&quot; memoirs, &quot;True Remembrances&quot;, wrote of &quot;creating Chartwell out of the drabness of Victorian umbrageousness&quot;.

=== Churchill at Chartwell ===

==== 1922 to 1939 ====

Churchill first saw Chartwell in July 1921, shortly before the house and estate were to be auctioned. He returned the same month with his wife Clementine, who was initially attracted to the property, although her enthusiasm cooled during subsequent visits. In September 1922, when the house had failed to sell at auction, he was offered it for £5,500. He paid £5,000, after his first offer of £4,800, made because &quot;the house will have to be very largely rebuilt, and the presence of dry rot is a very serious adverse factor&quot;, was rejected. The seller was Captain Archibald John Campbell Colquhoun, who had inherited the house in June 1922 on the death of his brother. Campbell Colquhoun had been a contemporary of Churchill&#x27;s at Harrow School in the 1880s. On completion of the sale in September 1922, Churchill wrote to him; &quot;I am very glad indeed to have become the possessor of &quot;Chartwell&quot;. I have been searching for two years for a home in the country and the site is the most beautiful and charming I have ever seen&quot;. The sale was concluded on 11 November 1922.

The previous 15 months had been personally and professionally calamitous. In June 1921, Churchill&#x27;s mother had died, followed three months later by his youngest child, Marigold. In late 1922, he fell ill with appendicitis and at the end of the year lost his Scottish parliamentary seat at Dundee.

Philip Tilden, Churchill&#x27;s architect, began work on the house in 1922 and the Churchills rented a farmhouse near Westerham, Churchill frequently visiting the site to observe progress. The two-year building programme, the ever-rising costs, which escalated from the initial estimate of £7,000 to over £18,000, and a series of construction difficulties, particularly relating to damp, soured relations between architect and client, and by 1924 Churchill and Tilden were barely on speaking terms. Legal arguments, conducted through their respective lawyers, continued until 1927. Clementine&#x27;s anxieties about the costs, both of building and subsequently living at Chartwell also continued. In September 1923 Churchill wrote to her, &quot;My beloved, I beg you not to worry about money, or to feel insecure. Chartwell is to be our &quot;home&quot; (and) we must endeavour to live there for many years.&quot; Churchill finally moved into the house in April 1924; a letter dated 17 April to Clementine begins, &quot;This is the first letter I have ever written from this place, and it is right that it should be to you&quot;.

In February 1926, Churchill&#x27;s political colleague Sir Samuel Hoare described a visit in a letter to the press baron Lord Beaverbrook; &quot;I have never seen Winston before in the role of landed proprietor, ... the engineering works on which he is engaged consist of making a series of ponds in a valley and Winston appeared to be a great deal more interested in them than in anything else in the world&quot;. As Hoare&#x27;s presence indicated, Churchill&#x27;s holidays were very rarely pure vacations. Roy Jenkins, in his study, &quot;The Chancellors&quot;, contrasted Churchill&#x27;s approach to holidaying with that of his then boss, Stanley Baldwin. &quot;Churchill went to Chartwell or elsewhere to lengthen the stride of his political work, but not greatly to reduce its quantity; far from shutting himself off, he persuaded as many as possible of his colleagues and henchmen to visit him, to receive his ever-generous hospitality.&quot; In January 1928, James Lees-Milne stayed as a guest of Churchill&#x27;s son Randolph. He described an evening after dinner; &quot;We remained at that round table till after midnight. Mr Churchill spent a blissful two hours demonstrating with decanters and wine glasses how the Battle of Jutland was fought. He got worked up like a schoolboy, making barking noises in imitation of gunfire, and blowing cigar smoke across the battle scene in imitation of gun smoke&quot;. On 26 September 1927, Churchill composed the first of his &quot;Chartwell Bulletins&quot;, which were lengthy letters to Clementine, written to her while she was abroad. In the bulletins, Churchill described in great detail the ongoing works on the house and the gardens, and aspects of his life there. The 26 September letter opens with a report of Churchill&#x27;s deepening interest in painting; &quot;Sickert arrived on Friday night and we worked very hard at various paintings ... I am really thrilled ... I see my way to paint far better pictures than I ever thought possible before&quot;.

Churchill described his life at Chartwell in the later 1930s in the first volume of his history of the Second World War, &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;. &quot;I had much to amuse me. I built ... two cottages, ... and walls and made ... a large swimming pool which ... could be heated to supplement our fickle sunshine. Thus I ... dwelt at peace within my habitation&quot;. Bill Deakin, one of Churchill&#x27;s research assistants, recalled his working routine. &quot;He would start the day at eight o&#x27;clock in bed, reading. Then he started with his mail. His lunchtime conversation was quite magnificent, ...absolutely free for all. After lunch, if he had guests he would take them round the garden. At seven he would bathe and change for dinner. At midnight, when the guests left, &quot;then&quot; he would start work ... to three or four in the morning. The secret was his phenomenal power to concentrate.&quot; In his study of Churchill as author, the historian Peter Clarke described Chartwell as &quot;Winston&#x27;s word factory&quot;.
In the opinion of Robin Fedden, a diplomat, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust and author of the Trust&#x27;s first guidebook for Chartwell, the house became &quot;the most important country house in Europe&quot;. The historian Graham Stewart, in his study of Tory Party politics, &quot;Burying Caesar&quot;, described it as &quot;a sort of Jacobite court of St Germain&quot;. A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants, concerned military officers and foreign envoys came to the house to provide information to support Churchill&#x27;s struggle against appeasement. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own &quot;little Foreign Office ... the hub of resistance&quot;. The Chartwell visitors&#x27; book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill&#x27;s mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill&#x27;s guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, &quot;I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament&quot;. A week later, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and confidant of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the League of Nations to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, &quot;there is no time to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late&quot;.

Churchill also recorded visits to Chartwell by two more of his most important suppliers of confidential governmental information, Desmond Morton and Ralph Wigram, information which he used to &quot;form and fortify my opinion about the Hitler Movement&quot;. Their sharing of data on German rearmament was at some risk to their careers; the military historian Richard Holmes is clear that Morton&#x27;s actions breached the Official Secrets Act. Chartwell was also the scene of more direct attempts to prepare Britain for the coming conflict; in October 1939, when reappointed First Lord of the Admiralty on the outbreak of war, Churchill suggested an improvement for anti-aircraft shells; &quot;Such shells could be filled with zinc ethyl which catches fire spontaneously ... A fraction of an ounce was demonstrated at Chartwell last summer&quot;.

In 1938, Churchill, beset by financial concerns, again considered selling Chartwell, at which time the house was advertised as containing five reception rooms, nineteen bed and dressing rooms, eight bathrooms, set in eighty acres with three cottages on the estate and a heated and floodlit swimming pool. He withdrew the sale after the industrialist Henry Strakosch agreed to take over his share portfolio, which had been hit heavily by losses on Wall Street, for three years and pay off significant associated debts. In September 1938, the Russian Ambassador, Ivan Maisky, made his first visit and recorded his impressions of Chartwell: &quot;A wonderful place! A two-storey house, large and tastefully presented; the terrace affords a breathtaking view of Kent&#x27;s hilly landscape; ponds with goldfish of varying size; a pavilion-cum-studio with dozens of paintings - his own creations - hanging on the walls; his pride and joy, a small brick cottage which he was building with his own hands&quot;. His impression of his host was somewhat less favourable; asked what special occasion would lead Churchill to drink a bottle of wine dating from 1793 from his cellar, Churchill had replied - &quot;We&#x27;ll drink this together when Great Britain and Russia beat Hitler&#x27;s Germany&quot;. Maisky&#x27;s unspoken reaction was recorded in his diary, &quot;Churchill&#x27;s hatred of Berlin really has gone beyond all limits!&quot;

==== 1939 to 1965 ====

Chartwell was mostly unused during the Second World War. Its exposed position in a county so near to German-occupied France meant it was vulnerable to a German airstrike or commando raid. As a precaution the lakes were covered with brushwood to make the house less identifiable from the air. A rare visit to Chartwell occurred in July 1940, when Churchill inspected aircraft batteries in Kent. His Principal Private Secretary at the time, Eric Seal, recorded the visit; &quot;In the evening the PM, Mrs C and I went off to Chartwell. One of the features of the place is a whole series of ponds, which are stocked with immense goldfish. The PM loves feeding them&quot;. The Churchills instead spent their weekends at Ditchley House, in Oxfordshire, until security improvements were completed at the Prime Minister&#x27;s official country residence, Chequers, in Buckinghamshire. At dinner at Chequers, in December 1940, John Colville, Churchill&#x27;s assistant private secretary recorded his master&#x27;s post-war plans, &quot;He would retire to Chartwell and write a book on the war, which he had already mapped out in his mind chapter by chapter&quot;.
Chartwell remained a haven in times of acute stress—Churchill spent the night there before the fall of France in 1940. Summoned to London by an urgent plea from Lord Gort for permission to retreat to Dunkirk, Churchill broadcast the first of his wartime speeches to the nation; &quot;Arm yourselves, and be ye men of valour...for it is better for us to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation...&quot; He returned again on 20 June 1941, after the failure of Operation Battleaxe to relieve Tobruk, and determined to sack the Middle East commander, General Wavell. John Colville recorded Churchill&#x27;s deliberations in his diary; &quot;spent the afternoon at Chartwell. After a long sleep the P.M. in a purple dressing gown and grey felt hat took me to see his goldfish. He was ruminating deeply about the fate of Tobruk and contemplating means of resuming the offensive&quot;. Churchill continued to pay occasional, short, visits to the house; on one such, on 24 June 1944, just after the Normandy landings, his secretary recorded that the house was &quot;shut up and rather desolate&quot;.

Following VE Day, the Churchills first returned to Chartwell on 18 May 1945, to be greeted by what the horticulturalist and garden historian Stefan Buczacki describes as, &quot;the biggest crowd Westerham had ever seen&quot;. But military victory was rapidly followed by political defeat as Churchill lost the June 1945 general election. He almost immediately went abroad, while Clementine went back to Chartwell to begin the long process of opening up the house for his return—&quot;it will be lovely when the lake camouflage is gone&quot;. Later that year, Churchill again gave thought to selling Chartwell, concerned by the expense of running the estate. A group of friends, organised by Lord Camrose, raised the sum of £55,000 which was passed to the National Trust allowing it to buy the house from Churchill for £43,800. The excess provided an endowment. The sale was completed on 29 November. For payment of a rent of £350 per annum, plus rates, the Churchills committed to a 50-year lease, allowing them to live at Chartwell until their deaths, at which point the property would revert to the National Trust. Churchill recorded his gratitude in a letter to Camrose in December 1945, &quot;I feel how inadequate my thanks have been, my dear Bill, who (...) never wavered in your friendship during all these long and tumultuous years&quot;. 
In 1953, Chartwell became Churchill&#x27;s refuge once more when, again in office as prime minister, he suffered a debilitating stroke. At the end of a dinner held on 23 June at 10 Downing Street, for the Italian Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi, Churchill collapsed and was barely able either to stand or to speak. On the 25th, he was driven to Chartwell, where his condition deteriorated further. Churchill&#x27;s doctor Lord Moran stated that &quot;he did not think the Prime Minister could possibly live over the weekend&quot;. That evening Colville summoned Churchill&#x27;s closest friends in the press, Lord Beaverbrook, Lord Camrose and Brendan Bracken who, walking the lawns at Chartwell, agreed to try to ensure a press blackout to prevent any reporting of Churchill&#x27;s condition. Colville described the outcome, &quot;They achieved the all but incredible success of gagging Fleet Street, something they would have done for nobody but Churchill. Not a word of the Prime Minister&#x27;s stroke was published until he casually mentioned it in the House of Commons a year later&quot;. Secluded and protected at Chartwell, Churchill made a remarkable recovery and thoughts of his retirement quickly receded. During his recuperation, Churchill took the opportunity to complete work on &quot;Triumph and Tragedy&quot;, the sixth and final volume of his war memoirs, which he had been forced to set aside when he returned to Downing Street in 1951.

On 5 April 1955, Churchill chaired his last cabinet, almost fifty years since he had first sat in the Cabinet Room as President of the Board of Trade in 1908. The following day he held a tea party for staff at Downing Street before driving to Chartwell. On being asked by a journalist on arrival how it felt no longer to be prime minister, Churchill replied, &quot;It&#x27;s always nice to be home&quot;. For the next ten years, Churchill spent much time at Chartwell, although both he and Lady Churchill also travelled extensively. His days there were spent writing, painting, playing bezique or sitting &quot;by the fish pond, feeding the golden orfe and meditating&quot;. Of his last years at the house, Churchill&#x27;s daughter, Mary Soames, recalled, &quot;in the two summers that were left to him he would lie in his &#x27;wheelbarrow&#x27; chair contemplating the view of the valley he had loved for so long&quot;.

Catherine Snelling served Churchill as one his last secretaries. In the oral histories of a number of such secretaries compiled by the Churchill Archive, she recalled the dwindling number of visitors Churchill received at the house in his later years. They included Clementine&#x27;s cousin, Sylvia Henley, Violet Bonham Carter, daughter of H. H. Asquith and a lifelong friend, Harold Macmillan and Bernard Montgomery. On 13 October 1964, Churchill&#x27;s last dinner guests at Chartwell were his former principal private secretary Sir Leslie Rowan and his wife. Lady Rowan later recalled, &quot;It was sad to see such a great man become so frail&quot;. The following week, increasingly incapacitated, Churchill left the house for the last time. His official biographer Martin Gilbert records Churchill was, &quot;never to see his beloved Chartwell again&quot;. After his death in January 1965, Lady Churchill relinquished her rights to the house and presented Chartwell to the National Trust. It was opened to the public in 1966, one year after Churchill&#x27;s death.

=== National Trust: 1966 to the present ===

The house has been restored and preserved as it looked in the 1920–30s; at the time of the Trust&#x27;s purchase, Churchill committed to leaving it, &quot;garnished and furnished so as to be of interest to the public&quot;. Rooms are decorated with memorabilia and gifts, the original furniture and books, as well as honours and medals that Churchill received. Lady Churchill&#x27;s long-time secretary, Grace Hamblin, was appointed the first administrator of the house. Earlier in her career, Miss Hamblin had undertaken the destruction of the portrait of Churchill painted by Graham Sutherland. The picture, a gift from both Houses of Parliament on Churchill&#x27;s 80th birthday in 1954, was loathed by both Churchill and Lady Churchill and had been stored in the cellars at Chartwell before being burnt in secret.

The opening of the house required the construction of facilities for visitors and a restaurant was designed by Philip Jebb, and built to the north of the house, along with a shop and ticket office. Alterations have also been made to the gardens, for ease of access and of maintenance. The Great Storm of 1987 caused considerable damage, with twenty-three trees being blown down in the gardens. Greater destruction occurred in the woodland surrounding the house, which lost over seventy per cent of its trees.

Chartwell has become among the National Trust&#x27;s most popular properties; in 2016, the fiftieth anniversary of its opening, 232,000 people visited the house. In that year the Trust launched the &quot;Churchill&#x27;s Chartwell&quot; Appeal, to raise £7.1M for the purchase of hundreds of personal items held at Chartwell on loan from the Churchill family. The items available to the Trust include Churchill&#x27;s Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to him in 1953. The citation for the award reads, &quot;for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values&quot;. The medal is displayed in the museum room on the first floor of Chartwell, at the opposite end of the house to the study, the room where, in the words used by John F. Kennedy when awarding him honorary citizenship of the United States, Churchill &quot;mobilized the English language and sent it into battle&quot;.

== Architecture and description ==

The highest point of the estate is approximately 650 feet above sea level, and the house commands views across the Weald of Kent. The view from the house was of crucial importance to Churchill; years later, he remarked, &quot;I bought Chartwell for that view.&quot;

=== Exterior ===
Churchill employed the architect Philip Tilden, who worked from 1922 to 1924 to modernise and extend the house. Tilden was a &quot;Society&quot; architect who had previously worked for Churchill&#x27;s friend Philip Sassoon at his Kent home, Port Lympne, and had designed Lloyd George&#x27;s house, Bron-y-de, at Churt. The architectural style is vernacular. The house is constructed of red brick, of two storeys, with a basement and extensive attics. The 18th-century doorcase in the centre of the entrance front was purchased from a London antiques dealer. The architectural historian John Newman considered it, &quot;large and splendid and out of place&quot;. The garden wall on Mapleton Road is modelled on that at Quebec House, the home of General Wolfe in nearby Westerham.

On the garden front, Tilden threw up a large, three-storey extension with stepped gables, called by Churchill &quot;my promontory&quot;, which contains three of the house&#x27;s most important rooms, the dining room, in the lower-storey basement, and the drawing room and Lady Churchill&#x27;s bedroom above.
=== Interior ===
The interior has been remodelled since the National Trust took over the property in 1966, to accommodate visitors and to enable the display of a large number of Churchillian artefacts. In particular, some guest bedrooms have been amalgamated, to allow the construction of the Museum room and the Uniform room. Nevertheless, the majority of the principal rooms have been reconstructed and furnished as they were in the 1920s–1930s and are open to the public, with the current exception of Churchill&#x27;s own bedroom.

==== Entrance hall and inner hall, library and drawing room ====
Designed by Tilden, replacing a wood-panelled earlier hall, the halls lead onto the library, the drawing room and Lady Churchill&#x27;s sitting room.
The library contains some major pieces of Churchilliana, including the 1942 siren suit portrait by Frank O. Salisbury and a wall-mounted model of Port Arromanches, depicting the Normandy landing site with its Mulberry harbour on D-Day + 109, the 23rd of September 1944. The drawing room was used mainly for receiving guests, and for playing bezique. It contains one of the house&#x27;s most important paintings, a view of Charing Cross Bridge by Claude Monet. This unfinished work, undertaken by Monet from his balcony at the Savoy Hotel, subsequently formed a significant element in the negotiations between the executors of Churchill&#x27;s estate and the National Land Fund over the gifting of many of Chartwell&#x27;s contents to the National Trust in lieu of death duties.

==== Dining room ====

The bottom section of Tilden&#x27;s &quot;promontory&quot; extension, the dining room contains the original suite of the table and dining chairs designed by Heal&#x27;s to Churchill&#x27;s exacting requirements – (see box). An early study for a planned picture by William Nicholson entitled &quot;Breakfast at Chartwell&quot; hangs in the room. Nicholson, a frequent visitor to Chartwell who gave Churchill painting lessons, drew the study for a finished picture which was intended as a present for Churchill&#x27;s silver wedding anniversary in 1933 but, disliking the final version, Nicholson destroyed it. The picture depicts the Churchills breakfasting together, which in fact they rarely did, and Churchill&#x27;s marmalade cat, Tango. The tradition of keeping a marmalade cat at Chartwell, which Churchill began and followed throughout his ownership, is maintained by the National Trust in accordance with Churchill&#x27;s wishes. In a letter to Randolph written in May 1942, Churchill wrote of a brief visit to Chartwell the previous week, &quot;the goose and the black swan have both fallen victim to the fox. The Yellow Cat however made me sensible of his continuing friendship, although I had not been there for eight months&quot;.

Churchill depicted the dining room in one of his own pictures, &quot;Tea at Chartwell: 29 August 1927&quot;. The scene shows Churchill in one of his dining chairs with his family and guests: Thérèse Sickert, and her husband, Walter Richard Sickert, Churchill&#x27;s friend and artistic tutor; Edward Marsh, Churchill&#x27;s secretary; his friends Diana Mitford and Frederick Lindemann; and Clementine, Randolph and Diana Churchill. Above the dining room is the drawing room and, above that, Lady Churchill&#x27;s bedroom, described by Churchill as &quot;a magnificent aerial bower&quot;.

==== Study ====
Churchill&#x27;s study, on the first floor, was his &quot;workshop for over 40 years&quot; and &quot;the heart of Chartwell&quot;. In the 1920s, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, he planned his budgets in the room; in the 1930s, in isolation, he composed his speeches that warned against the rise of Hitler and dictated the books and articles that paid the bills; in 1945, defeated, he retreated here to write his histories; and here, in final retirement, he passed much of his old age. Throughout the 1930s, the study was his base for the writing of many of his most successful books. His biography of his ancestor Marlborough and his &quot;The World Crisis&quot; were written there, and &quot;A History of the English-Speaking Peoples&quot; was begun and concluded there, although interrupted by the Second World War. He also wrote many of his pre-war speeches in the study, although the house was less used during the war itself. Tilden exposed the early roof beams by removing the late-Victorian ceiling and inserting a Tudor doorcase. From the beams hang three banners, Churchill&#x27;s standards as Knight of the Garter and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and the Union Flag raised over Rome on the night of 5 June 1944, the first British flag to fly over a liberated capital. The latter was a gift from Lord Alexander of Tunis. The study also contains portraits of Churchill&#x27;s parents, Lord Randolph Churchill and Lady Randolph Churchill, the latter by John Singer Sargent. The floor is covered with a Khorassan carpet, a 69th birthday gift to Churchill from the Shah of Iran at the Teheran Conference in 1943.

Beyond the study are Churchill&#x27;s bedroom and his en suite bathroom, with sunken bath. At the time of the house&#x27;s opening to the public in 1966, these rooms were not made accessible, at the request of Churchill&#x27;s family but, shortly before her death in 2014, Churchill&#x27;s daughter Mary gave permission for their opening, and the Trust plans to make them accessible by 2020.

=== Architectural appreciation ===
Neither the original Victorian house with its extensions, nor Tilden&#x27;s reconstruction, created a building that has been highly regarded by critics. John Newman noted that the massing of the house on the garden terraces, taking advantage of the Wealden views, was &quot;the grouping that mattered&quot;. He dismissed the other side of the house as a, &quot;long, indecisive entrance front close to the road&quot; and the overall composition as of &quot;dull red brick and an odd undecided style&quot;. The architectural writer and Chairman of the National Trust Simon Jenkins considered the house, &quot;undistinguished&quot;. The National Trust&#x27;s guidebook describes the original building as &quot;Victorian architecture at its least attractive&quot;. The house is Grade I listed but its brief, Historic England listing makes clear that this is &quot;for historical reasons&quot; rather than for its architectural merit. The gardens are Grade II* listed.

== Gardens and estate ==

The gardens surrounding the house comprise , with a further of parkland. They are predominantly the creation of the Churchills, with significant later input from Lanning Roper, Gardens Adviser to the National Trust. The Victorian garden had been planted with conifers and rhododendrons which were typical of the period. The Churchills removed much of this planting while retaining the woodlands beyond. Within the garden proper, they created almost all of the landscape, architectural and water features are seen today. The garden front of the house opens onto a terraced lawn, originally separated from the garden beyond by a ha-ha and subsequently by a Kentish ragstone wall constructed in the 1950s. To the north lies the rose garden, laid out by Lady Churchill and her cousin Venetia Stanley. The nearby Marlborough Pavilion was built by Tilden and decorated with frescos by Churchill&#x27;s nephew John Spencer Churchill in 1949. Beyond the rose garden is the water garden, constructed by the Churchills and including the golden orfe pond where Churchill fed his fish, and the swimming pool constructed in the 1930s. Churchill sought advice from his friend and scientific guru Professor Lindemann on the optimal methods for heating and cleaning the pool.

To the south is the croquet lawn, previously a tennis court—Lady Churchill was an accomplished and competitive player of both, although Churchill was not. Beyond the lawn are several structures grouped around the Victorian kitchen garden, many of which Churchill was involved in building. He had developed an interest in bricklaying when he bought Chartwell and throughout the 1920s and 1930s constructed walls, a summerhouse and some houses on the estate. In 1928, he joined the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, a move which caused controversy. Near the kitchen garden is the golden rose walk, containing thirty-two varieties of golden roses, a golden wedding anniversary present to the Churchills from their children in 1958, and Churchill&#x27;s painting studio, constructed in the 1930s, which now houses a large collection of his artistic works.

South of the terrace lawn are the upper and lower lakes, a scene of Churchill&#x27;s most ambitious landscaping schemes. The lower lake had existed during the Colquhouns&#x27; ownership, but the island within it, and the upper lake, were Churchill&#x27;s own creations. On 1 January 1935, while Lady Churchill was on a cruise off Sumatra, Churchill described the beginnings of his endeavours in one of his Chartwell Bulletins; &quot;I have arranged to have one of those great mechanical diggers. In one week he can do more than 40 men can do. There is no difficulty about bringing him in as he is a caterpillar and can walk over the most sloppy fields&quot;. Excavation work proved more challenging than Churchill had anticipated; two weeks later he wrote again, &quot;The mechanical digger has arrived. He moves about on his caterpillars only with the greatest difficulty on this wet ground&quot;.

On the lakes lived Churchill&#x27;s large collection of wildfowl, including the black swans, a gift from the Australian Government, which restocked the lakes with them in 1975. Churchill had a sentimental attachment to the fauna that lived at Chartwell: his close friend Violet Bonham Carter recalled their conversation in the garden in the early 1950s; &quot;He was bemoaning the fact that the summer had been a bad one for butterflies when suddenly to his delight he saw two Red Admirals alighting on a clump of Buddleia bushes he had planted to attract them. I shall never forget his pleasure&quot;.

=== Farms and stables ===
In 1946–47, Churchill extended his land-holdings around Chartwell, purchasing Chartwell Farm and Parkside Farm, and subsequently Bardogs Farm and a market garden. By 1948, he was farming approximately 500 acres. The farms were managed by Mary Soames&#x27;s husband, Christopher, and Churchill kept cattle and pigs and also grew crops and market vegetables. The farms did not prove profitable, and by 1952 Churchill&#x27;s operating losses on them exceeded £10,000 a year. By the end of the decade, both the farms and the livestock had been sold.

A more lucrative venture was the owning, and later breeding, of racehorses. In 1949, Churchill had purchased Colonist II, who won his first race, the Upavon Stakes, at Salisbury that year, and subsequently netted Churchill £13,000 in winnings. In 1955, Churchill bought the Newchapel Stud and by 1961 his total prize money from racing exceeded £70,000. In the 1950s, he reflected on his racing career; &quot;Perhaps Providence had given him Colonist as a comfort in his old age and to console him for disappointments&quot;.

<doc id="878194" wikidata="Q7457261" url="?curid=878194" title="Seven Foot Knoll Light">
<text>The Seven Foot Knoll Light was built in 1855 and is the oldest screw-pile lighthouse in Maryland. It was located atop Seven Foot Knoll in the Chesapeake Bay until it was replaced by a modern navigational aid and relocated to Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor as a museum exhibit.

== Location ==
It was initially installed on a rocky shoal called Seven Foot Knoll (at ), in the mouth of the Patapsco River. The northern tidal reach of this river is the Baltimore Harbor, where the now-decommissioned lighthouse has been placed as a museum exhibit. In 1997 the lighthouse was transferred to the Baltimore Maritime Museum (now the Historic Ships in Baltimore museum) and is permanently installed at the south end of Pier 5.

== Construction ==
Constructed of rolled iron, the lighthouse consists of three main sections. The gallery deck was located above the average high tide waters. The house was the second section, sitting directly atop the gallery deck. This is where the keeper and his family would live. Atop the housing area was the third section of the lighthouse, the light beacon. A 4th order Fresnel lens was housed in the small light compartment. It was visible for .

== History ==
The first requests for a light came in 1848, with initial appropriations in 1851. Delays in planning and bidding pushed the start of construction to 1854. The house consisted of a cylindrical structure of wrought iron plates, with the ninth pile in the center. Total construction costs came to $43,000 by its completion the following year. Most parts were fabricated in Baltimore at the Murray and Hazelhurst iron foundry. The parts were then shipped to Seven Foot Knoll by boat where they were assembled atop of the screw piles. Ice, the perennial threat to screw-pile structures, caused damage in 1884 and 1894, leading to the piling of of riprap around the piles.

The light was automated in 1949, and fell into disrepair, eventually being supplanted by a skeleton tower. In 1988, the lighthouse was removed from Seven Foot Knoll, carried by a 1000 Ton Capacity Shearleg derrick, and placed ashore in Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor where it was donated to the city. On August 22, 1989 the lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Aided by the Lady Maryland Foundation (now the Living Classrooms Foundation), many members of the Steinhice family descendants worked to restore the structure prior to its re-opening.

The lighthouse is a contributing element in the Baltimore National Heritage Area and part of the Historic American Engineering Record.

== Rescues ==
Thomas Jefferson Steinhise (Keeper 1930–1941) assisted in the rescue of a tugboat crew in 1933. The tugboat &quot;Point Breeze&quot; was then owned by the Curtis Towing Company of Baltimore. She was towing a barge of dredge spoils from Baltimore to Gibson Island on August 20, 1933. The winds and seas had overcome the tug and the crew abandoned ship. Steinhice took the lighthouse&#x27;s small motorboat and made his way out in the direction of the tug&#x27;s distress whistle where he pulled six crew members from the water. Five crew members survived but the engineer perished. Steinhise was awarded the Silver Lifesaving Medal for his actions in saving the lives of the stranded crew. He is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery, Glen Burnie, MD. and his memorial includes a U.S. Lighthouse Service grave-marker.

<text>William &quot;Scottie&quot; Bryce (September 7, 1888 – June 17, 1963) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He briefly served as leader of the Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), although he never served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba.

==Biography==
Bryce, born in Lanark, Scotland, was educated at Glasgow, and apprenticed as a machinist. He arrived in Canada in 1919 and farmed in Dugald, Manitoba. From 1941 to 1943, he served as president of the Manitoba Farmers Association. He was also a member of the National War Services Board (1942–43) and the Advisory Board of Dominion Beef Committee.

Bryce was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a 1943 by-election, during a period of increased popularity for the federal CCF. Running in the riding of Selkirk, Bryce defeated his Liberal opponent Charles Fillmore by about 5500 votes. He was re-elected by narrower margins in the general elections of 1945 and 1949. He was a leading advocate for farmer&#x27;s concerns during his time in parliament, and generally avoided ideological debates.

Bryce&#x27;s tenure as provincial CCF leader was an anomaly in the party&#x27;s history. He was chosen leader in 1952 due to concerns that his federal riding would be eliminated by redistribution. As it happened, Bryce decided to stay in federal politics and Lloyd Stinson was chosen provincial leader in 1953. Bryce does not appear to have played a significant role in the operations of the provincial party.

Bryce was defeated by Liberal Robert Wood in the federal election of 1953, but won a by-election after Wood&#x27;s death the following year. He was re-elected in the 1957 election, but fell to Progressive Conservative Eric Stefanson in John Diefenbaker&#x27;s landslide victory of 1958.

In the 1959 provincial election, Bryce ran for the CCF in the riding of Selkirk but placed third, receiving only 872 votes out of about 4400 cast. He retired from politics after this.

Bryce died at his Selkirk, Manitoba home in 1963.

<doc id="878210" wikidata="Q44283" url="?curid=878210" title="Spotlight (Apple)">
<text>Spotlight is a system-wide desktop search feature of Apple&#x27;s macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS operating systems. Spotlight is a selection-based search system, which creates an index of all items and files on the system. It is designed to allow the user to quickly locate a wide variety of items on the computer, including documents, pictures, music, applications, and System Settings. In addition, specific words in documents and in web pages in a web browser&#x27;s history or bookmarks can be searched. It also allows the user to narrow down searches with creation dates, modification dates, sizes, types and other attributes. Spotlight also offers quick access to definitions from the built-in &quot;New Oxford American Dictionary&quot; and to calculator functionality. There are also command-line tools to perform functions such as Spotlight searches.

Spotlight was first announced at the June 2004 Worldwide Developers Conference, and then released with Mac OS X Tiger in April 2005.

A similar feature for iPhone OS 3 with the same name was announced on March 17, 2009.

==macOS==
Indices of filesystem metadata are maintained by the Metadata Server (which appears in the system as the mds daemon, or mdworker). The Metadata Server is started by launchd when macOS (formerly Mac OS X, then OS X) boots and is activated by client requests or changes to the filesystems that it monitors. It is fed information about the files on a computer&#x27;s hard disks by the mdimport daemon; it does not index removable read-only media such as CDs or DVDs, but it will index removable, writable external media connected via USB, FireWire, or Thunderbolt, and Secure Digital cards. Aside from basic information about each file like its name, size and timestamps, the mdimport daemon can also index the content of some files, when it has an Importer plug-in that tells it how the file content is formatted. Spotlight comes with importers for certain types of files, such as Microsoft Word, MP3, and PDF documents. Apple publishes APIs that allow developers to write Spotlight Importer plug-ins for their own file formats.

The first time that a user logs onto the operating system, Spotlight builds indexes of metadata about the files on the computer&#x27;s hard disks. It also builds indexes of files on devices such as external hard drives that are connected to the system. This initial indexing may take some time, but after this the indexes are updated continuously in the background as files are created or modified. If the system discovers that files on an external drive have been modified on a system running a version of macOS older than Mac OS X Tiger, it will re-index the volume from scratch.

Within Tiger, Spotlight can be accessed from a number of places. Clicking on an icon in the top-right of the menu bar opens up a text field where a search query can be entered. Finder windows also have a text field in the top-right corner where a query can be entered, as do the standard load and save dialogue boxes. Both of these text fields immediately start listing results of the search as soon as the user starts typing in a search term, returning items that either match the term, or items that start with the term. The search results can be further refined by adding criteria in a Finder window such as &quot;Created Today&quot; or &quot;Size Greater than 1 KB&quot;.

Mac OS X Tiger and later also include command line utilities for querying or manipulating Spotlight. The mdimport command, as well as being used by the system itself to index information, can also be used by the user to import certain files that would otherwise be ignored or force files to be reimported. It is also designed to be used as a debugging tool for developers writing Importer plug-ins. mdfind allows the user to perform Spotlight queries from the command line, also allowing Spotlight queries to be included in things like shell scripts. mdls lists the indexed attributes for specific files, allowing the user to specify which files and/or which attributes. The indexes that Spotlight creates can be managed with mdutil, which can erase existing indexes causing them to be rebuilt if necessary or turn indexing off. These utilities are also available on Darwin.

Although not widely advertised, Boolean expressions can be used in Spotlight searches. By default if one includes more than one word, Spotlight performs the search as if an &quot;AND&quot; was included in between words. If one places a &#x27;|&#x27; between words, Spotlight performs an OR query. Placing a &#x27;-&#x27; before a word tells Spotlight to search for results that do not include that word (a NOT query).

Currently Spotlight is unable to index and search NTFS volumes shared via SMB.

===Leopard===
With Mac OS X Leopard, Apple introduced some additional features. With Spotlight in Tiger, users can only search devices that are attached to their computers. With Leopard, Spotlight is able to search networked Macs running Leopard (both client and server versions) that have file sharing enabled. A feature called Quick Look has been added to the GUI that will display live previews of files within the search results, so applications do not have to be opened just to confirm that the user has found the right file. The syntax has also been extended to include support for worded Boolean operators (&quot;AND&quot;, &quot;OR&quot; and &quot;NOT&quot;). These variants of the operators are localized; while users that have their System language set to English may use an &quot;AND&quot;, German users, for example, would have to use &quot;UND&quot;. The character variants work with any system language.

Also while Spotlight is not enabled on the server version of Tiger, it is on the server release of Leopard.

In addition, where Spotlight in Tiger had a unique and separate window design, Spotlight in Leopard now shares windows with the Finder, allowing for a more unified GUI.

The unique Spotlight window in Tiger allowed sorting and viewing of search results by any metadata handled by the Finder; whereas Spotlight Finder windows in Leopard are fixed to view and sort items by last opened date, filename and kind only. Under Leopard there is currently no way to save window preferences for the Finder window that is opened via Spotlight.

Since Leopard the Spotlight menu has doubled as a calculator, with functionality very similar to the Google search feature (but without the need to be online), as well as a dictionary that allows one to look up the definition of an English word using the Oxford Dictionary included in macOS.

===Yosemite===
In OS X Yosemite, the Spotlight search UI was completely redesigned. Instead of it acting as a drop-down menu, it is now located in the center of the screen by default, though the search bar (and/or the window itself) can be dragged to wherever the user prefers it to pop up. In addition to doing everything that the previous versions of Spotlight could do, the Yosemite revamp of Spotlight adds a preview or info pane on the right side (with results on the left side), and also adds support for searching through Wikipedia, Maps, and other sources.
==iOS and iPadOS==
A search tool also named Spotlight has been included on iOS (formerly iPhone OS) products since iPhone OS 3 and in iPadOS. The feature helps users search contacts, mail metadata, calendars, media and other content. Compared to Spotlight on macOS, the iOS search ability is limited. The Spotlight screen is opened with a finger-flick to the right from the primary home screen, or, as of iOS 7, by pulling down on any of the home screens.

The feature was announced in March 2009 and released with iOS 3.0 in June 2009. The release of iOS 4.0 included the ability to search text messages. In iOS 6, the folder that an application is inside of is now shown (if applicable). Since the Introduction of iOS 7, Spotlight no longer has its own dedicated page, but is accessible by pulling down on the middle of any Homescreen.

On September 17, 2014, Spotlight Search was updated with iOS 8 to include more intuitive web results via Bing and Wikipedia, as well as quicker access to other content.

With iOS 9, Spotlight Search has been updated to include results of content in apps.

In 2021, Apple introduced Image Search in Spotlight on iOS, Spotlight now uses intelligence to search photos by location, people, scenes, or objects, and using Live Text, Spotlight can find text and handwriting in photos.

==Privacy concerns==
Since the release of Yosemite, Spotlight sends all entered queries and location information to Apple by default. The data is accompanied by a unique identifying code, which Apple claims to rotate every 15 minutes to a new identifier. In response to privacy concerns, Apple has stated that they do not use the data to create profiles of their users, and that query and location information is only shared with their partner, Bing, under a strict contract which prohibits the information from being used for advertising purposes. In 2017, Bing was replaced by Google as the search engine for Spotlight. Additionally, Apple has stated that while Spotlight seeks to obscure exact locations, the information is typically more precise in densely populated areas and less so in sparse ones. Spotlight data sharing may be disabled from Spotlight System Preferences by deselecting the Spotlight Suggestions checkbox. When this is done, data is not shared with Apple.

<doc id="878212" wikidata="Q1584458" url="?curid=878212" title="Bisayan languages">
<text>The Bisayan languages or Visayan languages are a subgroup of the Austronesian languages spoken in the Philippines. They are most closely related to Tagalog and the Bikol languages, all of which are part of the Central Philippine languages. Most Bisayan languages are spoken in the whole Visayas section of the country, but they are also spoken in the southern part of the Bicol Region (particularly in Masbate and Sorsogon where several dialects of Waray are spoken), islands south of Luzon, such as those that make up Romblon, most of the areas of Mindanao and the province of Sulu located southwest of Mindanao. Some residents of Metro Manila also speak one of the Bisayan languages.

Over 30 languages constitute the Bisayan language family. The Bisayan language with the most speakers is Cebuano, spoken by 20 million people as a native language in Central Visayas, parts of Eastern Visayas, and most of Mindanao. Two other well-known and widespread Bisayan languages are Hiligaynon (Ilonggo), spoken by 9 million in most of Western Visayas and Soccsksargen; and Waray-Waray, spoken by 6 million in Eastern Visayas region. Prior to colonization, the script and calligraphy of most of the Visayan peoples was the badlit, closely related to the Tagalog baybayin.

==Nomenclature==
Native speakers of most Bisayan languages, especially Cebuano, Hiligaynon and Waray, not only refer to their language by their local name, but also by &quot;Bisaya&quot; or &quot;Binisaya&quot;, meaning &quot;Bisayan language&quot;. This is misleading or may lead to confusion as different languages may be called &quot;Bisaya&quot; by their respective speakers despite their languages being mutually unintelligible.

However, languages that are classified within the Bisayan language family but spoken natively in places outside of the Visayas do not use the self-reference &quot;Bisaya&quot; or &quot;Binisaya&quot;. To speakers of Cuyonon, Surigaonon, Butuanon and Tausug, the term &quot;Visayan&quot; usually refers to either Cebuano or Hiligaynon.

There have been no proven accounts to verify the origins of &quot;Bisaya&quot;. However, there is an ethnic group in Malaysia and Brunei who call themselves with the same name. However, these ethnic groups in the Philippines must not be confused with those in Borneo.

== Evidence ==
David Zorc lists the following innovations as features defining the Bisayan languages as a group (Zorc 1977:241). Tausug is noted to have diverged early from the group and may have avoided some sound changes that affected the others.

# *lC, *Cl &gt; *Cl (where C is any consonant not *h, *q, or *l)
# *qC, *Cq &gt; *Cq (MOST) *qC, *Cq &gt; *qC (Tausug, and most Bikol languages)

== Internal classification ==
David Zorc gives the following internal classification for the Bisayan languages (Zorc 1977:32). The five primary branches are South, Cebuan, Central, Banton, and West. However, Zorc notes that the Bisayan language family is more like a dialect continuum rather than a set of readily distinguishable languages.

The South Bisayan languages are considered to have diverged first, followed by Cebuan and then the rest of the three branches. Also, in the Visayas section, the province of Romblon has the most linguistic diversity, as languages from three primary Bisayan branches are spoken there: Romblomanon from Central Bisayan, Inunhan from Western Bisayan and Banton (which has an independent Bisayan branch).

Notably, Baybayanon and Porohanon have Warayan substrata, indicating a more widespread distribution of Waray before Cebuano speakers started to expand considerably starting from the mid-1800s.

A total of 36 varieties are listed below. Individual languages are marked by &quot;italics&quot;.

The auxiliary language of Eskayan is grammatically Bisayan, but has essentially no Bisayan (or Philippine) vocabulary.

Magahat and Karolanos, both spoken in Negros, are unclassified within Bisayan.

==Names and locations==
Zorc (1977: 14–15) lists the following names and locations of Bisayan languages. The recently documented languages Karolanos, Magahat, and Kabalian are not listed in Zorc (1977).

== Comparisons ==
The following comparisons are from data gathered by Zorc (1997).

=== Personal-noun case markers ===
=== Common-name case markers ===
==Reconstruction==

David Zorc&#x27;s reconstruction of Proto-Bisayan had 15 consonants and 4 vowels (Zorc 1977:201). Vowel length, primary stress (penultimate and ultimate), and secondary stress (pre-penultimate) are also reconstructed by Zorc.

<text>The Toiyabe Range is a mountain range in Lander and Nye counties, Nevada, United States. Most of the range is included within the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. The highest point in the range, near its southern end, is Arc Dome (11,788 feet, 3592 m), an area protected as the Arc Dome Wilderness. The highest point in Lander County, Bunker Hill, is also located within the Toiyabe Range. The range starts in northwestern Nye County north of Tonopah, Nevada and runs approximately 120 miles (190 km) north-northeast into southern Lander County, making it the second longest range in the state.

==Geography==
Although the Toiyabe Range is in the rain shadow of the higher Sierra Nevada (U.S.) range to the west and is too arid to support forests except for scattered pines, the climate was cold and snowy enough during the Pleistocene to develop alpine glaciers in several places, with cirques, moraines, and other glacial features still apparent. There are numerous hiking routes in the Toiyabes, including one along the crest.

The Toiyabe Range is separated from the Shoshone Mountains to the west by the Reese River Valley, although they intermingle at their southern extremes. On the east the Toiyabe Range is separated from the Toquima Range by the Big Smoky Valley.

The historic mining community of Austin is located on the western slope of the Toiyabe Range, about midway along its length. U.S. Route 50, the &quot;Loneliest Highway in America&quot;, runs through Austin and then crosses the range at Austin Summit at an elevation of 7,484 feet (2,281 m). U.S. Route 6 passes to the south of the range between Tonopah and Ely.

==Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest==
The Toiyabe Range is in the Austin Ranger District of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest

===Toiyabe Crest Trail===
The National Recreation Toiyabe Crest Trail runs through the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest in the Toiyabe Range, consisting of over of trail atop the ridge, of which travel through the Arc Dome Wilderness. The Army Corps of Engineers constructed the trail and its many &quot;feeder&quot; trails in the 1930s. It travels through one of the longest roadless areas in the state, and sits atop the longest mountain range in Nevada at over long. It is the longest continuous maintained trail in Nevada.

====Trailheads====
Its northern terminus, with an elevation of approximately , is the trailhead on Kingston Creek Road and its southern terminus, with an elevation of approximately is the trailhead on Twin River Road (Forest route 080); both of which are roads off SR 376.

<doc id="878221" wikidata="Q1645647" url="?curid=878221" title="Court of piepowders">
<text>A court of piepowders was a special tribunal in England organised by a borough on the occasion of a fair or market. Such a court had unlimited jurisdiction over personal actions or events taking place at the market, including disputes between merchants, theft, and acts of violence. Many hundreds of such courts operated in the Middle Ages, and a small number continued to exist even into modern times. Sir William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; in 1768 described this court as &quot;the lowest, and at the same time the most expeditious, court of justice known to the law of England&quot;.

Courts of piepowders had declined in use by the 17th century.

==Trial and procedure==
A piepowder court was held in front of the mayor and bailiffs of the borough, or the steward, if the market or fair was held by a lord. The number of justiciars often varied but was usually limited to three or four men. Punishments typically included fines and the possibility of being held in a pillory or being drawn in a tumbrel, a two-wheeled cart, in order to humiliate the offender. More serious crimes would often be reserved for the royal justices, but sometimes the jurisdiction was still held by a piepowder court.

When the time came for the trial, both parties would be summoned; typically, the defendants would be summoned an hour earlier. Here, the burden of proof was on the plaintiff with documents and witnesses often being provided as evidence. After the plaintiff made his case, the defendant then had the right to respond to the accusation and counter with evidence of his own. This method of proof was actually rather advanced for its time. When it came to evidence in other European courts, things such as compurgation, which is the defendant taking an oath over his stance and getting around twelve others to swear that they believe him, were still used in many cases.

Trials at courts of piepowders were short, quick and informal. In 12th century England and Scotland, a decision had to be made within a day and a half (before the third tide) of the accusation. If the court ruled against the defendant and the defendant could not pay the decided amount, his property could be seized, appraised, and sold to cover the costs.

==Decline==
Courts of piepowders existed because of the necessity for speedy justice over people who were not permanent residents of the place where the market was held. By the seventeenth century, most of their powers had effectively been transferred to the regular court system, for practical reasons rather than as a result of legislation, the standard district courts being well established. The most recent sitting of a piepowder court was in 1898, in Hemel Hempstead.

The last &quot;active&quot; court of piepowders, at the Stag and Hounds Public House in Bristol, was abolished by the Courts Act 1971. It had not actually sat since 1870, but a proclamation was still read in the marketplace each year. All other courts had their jurisdiction removed by the Administration of Justice Act 1977, though they may technically continue to exist even in the absence of officers, cases, or premises.

== Origin of the name ==
There is no one standard spelling of &quot;piepowder&quot;: the most common variant is perhaps &quot;pie poudre&quot; (as in Bristol). In the past, variations included &quot;pipoulder&quot; in the sixteenth century, &quot;pepowder&quot; in the fifteenth, and &quot;pipoudre&quot; in the fourteenth. &quot;Piepowder&quot; is a modern respelling of the term based on more familiar English words. Originally, it referred to the dusty feet (in French, &quot;pieds poudrés&quot;) of travellers and vagabonds, and was only later applied to the courts who might have dealings with such people. 

Also, since the members of courts of &quot;piepowder&quot;, were not sitting on a bench, but walking around in fairs, they would often get their feet dusty. This can be another explanation of the name that is given by some common law history teachers. In modern French, the word &quot;pieds-poudreux&quot; is still occasionally used for travelling beggars; it occurs, for example, in the works of Victor Hugo. Another literary reference is Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot;, in which Justice Adam Overdo patrols the fair in disguise, saying (Act 2, Scene 1):

<text>The Reversing Falls are a series of rapids on the Saint John River, located in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, where the river runs through a narrow gorge before emptying into the Bay of Fundy.

The semidiurnal tides of the bay force the flow of water to reverse against the prevailing current when the tide is high. However, during the spring freshet, this reversal is often surpassed by the downstream volume of water. The rapids, or &quot;falls,” are created by a series of underwater ledges which roil the water in either direction, causing a significant navigation hazard, despite the water&#x27;s depth. As a result, vessels wishing to enter or exit from the river must wait for slack tide.

The Reversing Falls have also been an important industrial site for over a century. The Canadian Pacific Railway constructed the Reversing Falls Railway Bridge in 1885 and this structure was replaced in 1922; it is currently used by the New Brunswick Southern Railway. The railway bridge crosses the gorge immediately downstream from the falls, parallel to the Reversing Falls Road Bridge.

The location of the falls was once home to a foundry and other light industrial operations on the east side of the gorge, while a large pulp mill lies on the west side. J.D. Irving, the company which has operated the pulp mill since purchasing it in the late 1940s, has faced criticism in recent decades for maintaining the facility at what is viewed as one of Saint John&#x27;s prime tourism locations. This criticism became most pronounced during the 1980s and 1990s when the city government developed Fallsview Park on the former industrial foundry lands on the east side of the gorge. The Falls were even given the dubious distinction by one publication of being among the worst tourist attractions in the world.

During the late 1990s, a tourist business was established, offering jet boat rides on the river in the vicinity of the falls; however, the boats did not operate in the roughest areas, which experience a significant drop in water level over a very short distance. The business closed at the end of the 2013 season after 19 years. The operators typically stayed in the choppy waters immediately downstream and attempted to soak passengers by driving through small whirlpools at the base of the railway bridge. Another more recent development at the Reversing Falls has been its growing use as a whitewater kayaking location, made unique by the changes in the formation of the rapids during incoming or outgoing tides.

<text>XOOPS is a free open-source content management system (CMS), written in PHP. It uses a modular architecture allowing users to customize, update and theme their websites. XOOPS is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) and is free to use, modify and redistribute.

==Overview==
XOOPS is an acronym of &quot;eXtensible Object Oriented Portal System&quot;. Though started as a portal system, it later developed into a web application framework. It aims to serve as a web framework for use by small, medium and large sites, through the installation of modules. For example, a small XOOPS installation can be used as a personal weblog or journal, but this can be expanded upon and customized, i.e. users might add the appropriate modules (freeware and commercial) to store content in news, forums, downloads, and others.

==Key features==

; Community : Because XOOPS is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) the growth and development of XOOPS is dependent on the contributions of a worldwide community effort.

; Database : XOOPS uses a relational database (currently MySQL) to store data required for running a web-based content management system.

; Advanced access control layer : Administrators have the ability to grant specific groups of users specific access rights to content and features such as edit, delete, upload, add attachments, publish content, and so on.

; Modularized : Modules can be installed, uninstalled, activated, and deactivated using the module administration system.

; Core features usable by modules : XOOPS possess a number of core features that can be used by modules like permissions, comments, notifications and blocks features.

; Personalization: Administrators have the ability to set specific permissions for user access and control of individual elements of their websites.

; User Management : The ability to search for users by various criteria, send email and private messages to users through a template-based messaging system.

; International language support : The XOOPS community has official support sites for non-English-speaking users. Additionally XOOPS itself supports multi-byte character sets for languages that use characters not in the Latin alphabet, for example Japanese, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Korean, etc. The multi-language support is also available on the PDF generation feature provided by the TCPDF library.

; Theme-based skinnable interface : XOOPS uses themes for page presentation. Both administrators and users can change the look of the entire web site by selecting from available themes.

; Templates : XOOPS uses the Smarty templating engine which allows many benefits such as easier separation between business logic and presentation logic as well as content caching.

; Built-in LDAP authentication

; Some SEO add-ons : A number of XOOPS modules contain features to facilitate the indexing of a website in search engines, like metatags, title tags and occasionally some URL rewriting. However, XOOPS does not give its users full control over their URLs. Where URL rewriting is possible, XOOPS often uses redirects that may confuse search engines. In addition, some XOOPS modules create duplicate content by making the same information available on more than one URL while in other cases (especially in case of multilingual sites), several sets of content may be made available through the same URL.

<text>Health Management Associates is a defunct Arkansas-based company involved in a blood-management scandal during the 1980s.

==History==

HMA was founded by Francis M. Henderson, a pediatrician from Pine Bluff, Arkansas.

HMA was contracted by the state of Arkansas to provide prison healthcare in the early to mid-1980s. This arrangement allowed HMA to collect blood from the prisoners at the Cummins Unit in Grady, Arkansas. HMA paid the prisoners seven dollars and sold it at 50 $ at a profit, though some of it was proven to be infected with HIV and hepatitis C. 
In 1982, Henderson contracted with a Canadian company named Continental Pharma Cryosan, Limited, which turned the blood into clotting factor and sold it to the Red Cross. In 1983, Canadian officials discovered the source of the blood, and canceled the contracts.
In 1985 an investigation of HMA was called by then Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. HMA was cleared of criminal wrongdoing. A later CEO of HMA was Leonard Dunn. Dunn was a Pine Bluff banker close friend of Bill Clinton and managed to keep HMA in business. Dunn later chaired Clinton&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign. He was appointed by Clinton to the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission.
In 1985, the Arkansas Board of Corrections hired an independent California firm, which concluded that HMA had violated its contract in forty areas, and put much of the responsibility on Art Lockhart, Arkansas state prisons chief, director of the Arkansas Department of Corrections. Clinton did not ask for Lockharts resignation. Lockhart also was protected by Arkansas state Senator Knox Nelson. However HMA lost its contract and it closed in 1986.

==Legacy==
HMA is at the heart of the Arkansas Prison Plasma Scandal. Though HMA closed the Arkansas prisoner blood business continued -until 1994. Arkansas was the last US state to prohibit selling plasma extracted from prisoners.

===The Krever Report===

The Health Management Associates Scandal refers to the sale of tainted blood from HMA to Canadian blood banks.
In 1993, Justice Horace Krever led a Royal Commission (public inquiry) which uncovered the Arkansas prison blood scheme, as he reported in 1997. The primary purpose of the report was to work on ways of improving the Canadian blood system to avoid similar problems in the future. Also, the report made mention of similar problems with prisoner blood collection practices in Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi, as well as concerns about blood in general from San Francisco.

<doc id="878234" wikidata="Q209528" url="?curid=878234" title="Mulhacén">
<text>Mulhacén (), with an elevation of , is the highest mountain in peninsular Spain and in all of the Iberian Peninsula. It is part of the Sierra Nevada range in the Penibaetic System. It is named after Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Ali, known as &quot;Muley Hacén&quot; in Spanish, the penultimate Muslim ruler of Granada in the 15th century who, according to legend, was buried on the summit of the mountain. It is still known in present-day Arabic as &quot;Jabal Mawla el-Hassan&quot; (Mountain of Mawla el-Hassan).

Mulhacén is the highest peak in Southern Europe outside of the Alps. It is also the third-most prominent peak in Western Europe, after Mont Blanc and Mount Etna, and is ranked 64th in the world by prominence. The peak is not exceptionally dramatic in terms of steepness or local relief. The south flank of the mountain is gentle and presents no technical challenge, as is the case for the long west ridge. The shorter, somewhat steeper northeast ridge is slightly more technical. The north face of the mountain is much steeper and offers several routes involving moderately steep climbing on snow and ice (up to French grade AD) in the winter.

Mulhacén can be climbed in a single day from the villages of either Capileira or Trevélez, but it is more common to spend a night at the mountain refuge at Poqueira, or in the bare shelter at Caldera to the west. Those making the ascent from Trevélez can also bivouac at the tarns to the northeast of the peak.

==Accidents==
On 5 March 2006, three British climbers from Teesside died on the mountain from suspected hypothermia. Initial reports quoting the Spanish Civil Guard stated that the three were ill-equipped for the extreme conditions. This claim was subsequently disputed both by the family and a colleague of one of the climbers, and by one of the rescuers. A plaque dedicated to them has been placed at the summit.
