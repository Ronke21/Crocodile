<text>František Palacký (; 14 June 1798 – 26 May 1876) was a Czech historian and politician, the most influential person of the Czech National Revival, called &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;.

==Life==
František Palacký was born on 14 June 1798, at Hodslavice house 108, a northeastern Moravian village now part of the Moravian-Silesian Region of the Czech Republic. His ancestors had been members of the community of the Bohemian Brethren, and had clandestinely maintained their Protestant belief throughout the period of religious persecution, eventually giving their adherence to the Augsburg confession as approximate to their original faith. Palacký&#x27;s father was a schoolmaster and a man of some learning. The son was sent in 1812 to the Evangelic Lutheran Lyceum at the then-Hungarian city of Bratislava, where he came in contact with the philologist Pavel J. Šafařík and became a zealous student of Slavic languages (he mastered 11 languages and became familiar with a few others).
After some years spent in private teaching, Palacký settled in 1823 at Prague. Here he found a warm friend in Josef Dobrovský, whose good relations with the Austrian authorities shielded him from the hostility shown by the government to students of Slav subjects. Dobrovský introduced him to Count Sternberg and his brother Francis, both of whom took an enthusiastic interest in Bohemian history. Count Francis was the principal founder of the Society of the Bohemian Museum, devoted to the collection of documents bearing on Bohemian history, with the object of reawakening national sentiment by the study of the national records.

===Joining of Czech national movement===
Public interest in the movement was stimulated in 1825 by the new &quot;Časopis Českého musea&quot; (Journal of the Bohemian Museum), of which Palacký was the first editor. The journal was at first published in Czech and German, and the Czech edition survived to become the most important literary organ of Bohemia. Palacký had received a modest appointment as archivist to Count Sternberg and in 1829 the Bohemian estates sought to confer on him the title of historiographer of Bohemia, with a small salary, but it was ten years before the consent of the Viennese authorities was obtained.
Meanwhile, the estates, with the tardy assent of Vienna, had undertaken to pay the expenses of publishing Palacký&#x27;s capital work, &quot;Dějiny národu českého v Čechách a v Moravě&quot; (History of the Czech Nation in Bohemia and Moravia). This book, which covers the period up to 1526 and the extinction of Czech independence (Palacký admitted that in writing about the national history since 1526, he &quot;would have to lie&quot;), was founded on laborious research in the local archives of Bohemia and in the libraries of the chief cities of Europe, and remains the standard authority. The first volume was printed in German in 1836, and subsequently translated into Czech. The publication of the work was hindered by the police censorship, which was especially active in criticizing his account of the Hussite movement.

Palacký, though entirely national and Protestant in his sympathies, was careful to avoid an uncritical approbation of the Reformers&#x27; methods, but his statements were held by the authorities to be dangerous to the Catholic faith. He was compelled to cut out parts of his narrative and to accept as integral parts of his work passages interpolated by the censors. After the abolition of the police censorship in 1848 he published a new edition, completed in 1876, restoring the original form of the work. The fairest and most considerable of Palacký&#x27;s antagonists in the controversy aroused by his narrative of the early reformation in Bohemia was Baron Helfert, who received a brief from Vienna to write his &quot;Huss und Hieronymus&quot; (1853) to counteract the impression made by Palacký&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;. Konstantin von Höfler, a German professor of history at Prague, edited the historical authorities for the period in a similar sense in his &quot;Geschichte der hussitischen Bewegung&quot; in Bohmen. Palacký replied in his &quot;Geschichte des Hussitenthumes und Professor Löffler&quot; (Prague, 1868) and &quot;Zur böhmischen Geschichtschreibung&quot; (Prague, 1871).

===Political activism===

The Revolution of 1848 forced the historian into practical politics. In his famous &quot;Psaní do Frankfurtu&quot; (A Letter to Frankfurt) he refused to take part in the preliminary parliament consisting of 500 former deputies to the all-German Diet, which met at Frankfurt, on the grounds that as a Czech he had no interest in German affairs.
In early June he oversaw the Slavic Congress at Prague as its president. Later that year he was deputed to the Reichstag which sat at the town of Kroměříž (Kremsier) between October 1848 and March 1849. He was at this time in favour of a strong Austrian empire, which should consist of a federation of the southern German and the Slavonic states, allowing the retention of their individual rights. This movement was called Austroslavism. Its views met with some degree of consideration at Vienna, and Palacký was even offered a portfolio in the Pillersdorf cabinet. The collapse of the federal idea and the definite triumph of the party of reaction in 1852 led to his retirement from politics.

After the liberal concessions of 1860 and 1861, however, he became a life member of the Austrian senate. His views met with small support from the assembly, and with the exception of a short period after the decree of September 1871, by which the emperor raised hopes for Bohemian self-government, he ceased to appear in the senate from 1861 onwards. In the Bohemian Diet (&quot;zemský sněm&quot;) he became the acknowledged leader of the nationalist-federal party (&quot;staročeši&quot;). He sought the establishment of a Czech kingdom that should include Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, and in his zeal for Czech autonomy he even entered into an alliance with the Conservative nobility and with the extreme Catholics. He attended the Panslavist congress in Moscow in 1867. He died in Prague on 26 May 1876.

==Legacy==

Palacký is considered as one of the three Fathers of the nation – the first being the King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, the second is František Palacký and the third is President of Czechoslovakia Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. Various individuals like to emphasize one over the other. As to historians, none have surpassed his history of Bohemia except when they have focused on a narrower time period. Even these have been directly or indirectly influenced by his work. He has also been the subject of Czechoslovak philosophical analysis by the likes of Milan Machovec (in his 1961 monograph).

<text>Sir Trevor Herbert Harry Skeet (28 January 1918 – 14 August 2004) was a New Zealand-born lawyer and a British Conservative Party politician.

==Early life==

Skeet was born in Auckland, New Zealand and was educated at King&#x27;s College, Auckland and the University of Auckland. He served with the New Zealand Army and Navy during World War II. He was a barrister and solicitor at the Supreme Court of New Zealand and was called to the English Bar in 1947 by Inner Temple. He was a member of the Council of the Royal Empire Society.

==Political career==

Skeet first stood for Parliament in Stoke Newington and Hackney North in 1951 and Llanelli in 1955. He was elected Member of Parliament for Willesden East in 1959, losing the seat in 1964. He was then MP for Bedford 1970-83 and North Bedfordshire 1983–97. Ahead of the 1992 election, he survived a deselection attempt by his constituency party. In the 1992-1997 Parliament, Skeet rebelled frequently against John Major&#x27;s ailing government, on issues such as the Maastricht Treaty; Skeet was a staunch Eurosceptic. Indeed, Skeet was one of only eight Conservative MPs who voted against Major&#x27;s government more than 50 times.

==Personal life==
Skeet was first married to Elizabeth Gilling from 1958 to her death in 1973, and had two sons with her. He then married Valerie Benson in 1985 (later Lady Valerie Skeet), with whom he resided in Milton Ernest, Bedfordshire until his death. He was knighted in 1986.

<text>The Magician is a 1926 American silent fantasy horror film directed by Rex Ingram about a magician&#x27;s efforts to acquire the blood of a maiden for his experiments to create life. It was adapted by Ingram from the 1908 novel &quot;The Magician&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham. It stars Alice Terry (the director&#x27;s wife), Paul Wegener and Iván Petrovich. Critic Carlos Clarens wrote that it was &quot;perhaps the most elusive of lost films.&quot; However, since the time Clarens wrote this, various prints of the film have surfaced. Some have screened at independent movie festivals from 1993 onwards, and the film has also been shown on Turner Classic Movies. It remained commercially unavailable until being released on DVD in the Warner Brothers Archive Collection in 2011 (with a running time of 88 minutes).

==Plot==

In the Latin Quarter of Paris, sculptor Margaret Dauncey is injured when the top of the huge statue of a faun she is working on breaks off and falls on her; her friend, painter Susie Boyd, gets help to lift the statue. After a successful surgery by Dr. Arthur Burdon saves Margaret from paralysis, she and Burdon fall in love.

The surgery is watched by various doctors and others including Oliver Haddo, a hypnotist, magician and student of medicine (a character in Maugham&#x27;s original novel based on real-life occultist Aleister Crowley). Later, in the Library of the Arsenal, Haddo finds what he has been searching for - a magic formula for the creation of human life. One of the ingredients is the &quot;heart blood of a Maiden&quot;. He rips out the page and presents the old book to Dr. Porhoët, Margaret&#x27;s uncle and guardian, who has also been looking for it.

When Margaret, Burdon and Dr. Porhoët go to the Fair at Leon de Belfort, they encounter Haddo, whom Margaret dislikes immediately. When Dr. Porhoët claims that the snake charmers use harmless snakes, Haddo refutes him and demonstrates his powers by letting a deadly horned viper bite him. He then magically makes the wound disappear. Porhoët remains unconvinced until the discarded viper strikes a young woman performer. Burdon has to rush her to a hospital.

Later, Haddo visits Margaret uninvited. He hypnotizes her and tells her to concentrate on her statue. It seems to come to life to preside over a large orgy, including a pipe-playing faun and other fauns or satyrs, one of whom grabs at her before she wakes from the vision and finds Haddo leering at her.

Two days before her wedding to Burdon, Margaret receives a note from Haddo, asking her to see him the next morning. She tries to resist the summons, but fails. On the day of the wedding, Burdon learns that Margaret has married Haddo instead but Porhoët is convinced it was against his niece&#x27;s will and Burdon tries to track them down.

Burdon eventually encounters the couple at a casino in Monte Carlo. He and Porhoët free Margaret while Haddo is away. Porhoët places her in a sanatorium to recover.

However, Haddo and his assistant, a little person, finds her and takes her to his hilltop laboratory in a tower. Just as Haddo is about to stab a bound Margaret, Burdon bursts in. After a violent struggle, Haddo falls into a huge fire and is killed. Margaret emerges from her trance and is reunited with her true love. Porhoët finds the page with the formula and burns it and sets the laboratory on fire, with the little person left hanging on a tree branch on the cliff.

==Cast==
* Alice Terry as Margaret Dauncey
* Paul Wegener as Oliver Haddo
* Iván Petrovich as Dr. Arthur Burdon
* Firmin Gémier as Dr. Porhoët
* Gladys Hamer as Susie Boyd, Margaret&#x27;s painter friend
* Henry Wilson as Haddo&#x27;s Servant
* Hubert I. Stowitts as Dancing Faun (as Stowitts)

A young Michael Powell made a brief appearance in a comedic role and also acted as assistant director.

==Production==

According to Carlos Clarens, &quot;made for Metro in France, away from all interference, &quot;The Magician&quot; was saluted upon release by a barrage of negative criticism, mostly on grounds of tastelessness, that sealed the picture&#x27;s doom. The still photographs, all that are available to the present day, show Ingram at the height of his pictorial talent.&quot;

Although the film is fundamentally a mad-scientist melodrama, it has been pointed out that &quot;along with the Tod Browning-Lon Chaney collaborations, &quot;The Magician&quot; was one of the few serious American horror movies in a time of spoofs.&quot;

Paul Wegener&#x27;s &quot;Magician&quot; co-workers found him difficult to work with. He had his own make-up artist &quot;whom he screamed at on the slightest provocation.” Michael Powell was not impressed with Wegener&#x27;s acting, saying his &quot;one expression to indicate magical powers was to open his huge eyes even wider, until he looked about as frightened as a bullfrog.&quot;

Some film historians suspect Rex Ingram began losing interest in &quot;The Magician&quot; while filming the project and left sequences he did not find interesting to others to direct. This may account for why his credit on &quot;The Magician&quot; reads &quot;Supervised by Rex Ingram.&quot; Henry Lachman claimed to have directed the Sabbat sequence and Powell supports this account in his memoirs. 

According to critic Carlos Clarens, the orgy scene recalls artistic depictions of the Greek god Pan, whom he listed as being portrayed by Stowitts, the American dancer at the Folies Bergere.&quot;

For theatre historians, &quot;The Magician&quot; provides a rare film record of the actor Firmin Gémier (1869-1933) in the supporting role of Dr. Porhoët. As a young man, Gémier had been a company member of two of the most important and influential avant-garde theatre companies in Paris in the 1880s and 1890s, working for André Antoine&#x27;s Théâtre Libre and Aurélien Lugné-Poe&#x27;s Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre. For the latter, he created the role of Père Ubu in the original production of Alfred Jarry&#x27;s notorious &quot;Ubu roi&quot; (1896). When Antoine became artistic director of the national Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon in 1906, he tapped Gémier to take over the artistic direction of his former operation, the Théâtre Antoine. Gémier appeared in only eight films, and his brief appearance in &quot;The Magician&quot; gives modern audiences a glimpse at what this prominent modernist theater star was like.

== Reception ==
Lawrence Reid of &quot;Motion Picture News&quot; praised the film as &quot;weird, fantastic, adequately suspensive, and shivery . . . no matter how it is accepted (there isn&#x27;t so much of the box-office ring about it, after all) no one is going to dismiss it as something that doesn&#x27;t belong . . . The film is splendidly atmospheric, contains some unique settings and is very well acted by a cast of international flavor.&quot; Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was impressed with the cast, writing that Alice Terry was &quot;beautiful and phlegmatic,&quot; Ivan Petrovich &quot;emphatically sympathetic and capable,&quot; and Paul Wegener &quot;with good make-up&quot; giving a &quot;restrained performance.&quot;

Conversely, &quot;Variety&#x27;s&quot; Fred was impressed with Wegener&#x27;s performance yet more critical of the film, calling it &quot;a very slow moving, draggy picture that has but a single thrill.&quot; Similarly, the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; described the film as &quot;A wild, improbable tale, not without its suspense and interest,&quot; adding that &quot;Ingram can never be stupid, but he is of late sometime careless.&quot;

==Soundtracks==
Silent film composer Robert Israel created a score for the Turner Classic Movies reissue of the movie. The Ragged Ragtime Band created and performed a score for &quot;The Magician&quot; at the Brighton Fringe Festival in 2012. The Nenagh Silent Film Festival commissioned Eoin Mac Ionmhain to compose and premiere a live score for &quot;The Magician&quot; in 2013. In 2022 Redwood Creek Films released a 4K restoration of the movie with a new score by Laurent Pigeolet.

<text>The Turicum was a Swiss automobile manufactured from 1904 to 1906 in Zürich and from 1907 to 1912 in Uster. The car&#x27;s name &quot;Turicum&quot; is the Latin name of Zürich. The first car made by Martin Fischer was a small single-seater go-kart like vehicle. The car was long, with pedal-operated steering and powered by a motorcycle engine. The car had a chain drive, while a second prototype had a friction drive. The friction drive consisted of a flat steel disc coupled to the engine that drove a small, leather-covered wheel running at right angles to its surface. The small wheel could be moved across the surface of the large disc, giving a variable gear ratio. The cars attracted little public interest. Swiss industrialist Jakob Heusser was involved in the venture.

==Production cars==
Conventional production cars were manufactured in Uster, with a steering wheel and two-seater body were shown at the Paris Salon in 1906. The cars had a single-cylinder air-cooled engine of capacity. A false radiator was fitted that acted as a fuel tank. The friction drive was retained and would be used on future cars.

In 1907, a 10/12 hp model with four-cylinder engine of was introduced, and the single-cylinder model had its engine enlarged to . Two and four-seat, open and closed bodies were offered. Fisher left the company in September of 1907. In 1912, a 16/26 model with engine was announced and could be ordered with a conventional gearbox. In 1918 a total of 90 Turicum were produced.

==Exports==
Sales in the home country were good, and cars were exported to Egypt, Italy, France, Germany, England, Denmark, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Turkey, Argentina, and South Africa. The company hit financial problems, and Production ended in 1912.

==Preservation==
Eleven cars still survive.

<doc id="901922" wikidata="Q739951" url="?curid=901922" title="Centre Region (Cameroon)">
<text>The Centre Region () occupies 69,000 km2 of the central plains of the Republic of Cameroon. It is bordered to the north by the Adamawa Region, to the south by the South Region, to the east by the East Region, and to the West by the Littoral and West Regions. It is the second largest (after East Region) of Cameroon&#x27;s regions in land area. Major ethnic groups include the Bassa, Ewondo, and Vute.

Yaoundé, capital of Cameroon, is at the heart of the Centre, drawing people from the rest of the country to live and work there. The Centre&#x27;s towns are also important industrial centres, especially for timber. Agriculture is another important economic factor, especially with regard to the province&#x27;s most important cash crop, cocoa. Outside of the capital and the plantation zones, most inhabitants are sustenance farmers.

==2008 presidential decree abolishes provinces==

In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, President Paul Biya signed decrees abolishing &quot;Provinces&quot; and replacing them with &quot;Regions&quot;. Hence, all of the country&#x27;s ten provinces are now known as Regions.

==Geography==
===Land===
The Centre&#x27;s soil is primarily composed of Precambrian deposits of metamorphic rocks, such as gneiss, mica, migmatites, and schists. Granite dominates from about 4˚ N and to the Adamawa border. Faults along the border with the South Province have deposited metamorphic schists and quartzites, with some granite. Laterites are also common, caused by the decomposition of the crystalline rock.

Red ferrallitic soil dominates most of the province, including the forested zone and much of the savanna area. Though as deep as ten metres, this soil is leached by silica and percolating water, making it only marginally productive for agriculture. However, it is usable as a building material, and traditional houses in the province are made from red, sun-dried bricks of mud. Toward the northern border, this soil becomes lightly evolved with large deposits of raw minerals, and at the confluence of the Sanaga and Mbam rivers, it is a mixture of several soil types.

===Drainage===
The Sanaga is the most important river in the province, as its many falls and rapids make it an important source of hydroelectric power. It also supports varied agriculture, as it is prone to flooding during the rainy season. It is navigable from Nachtigal Falls to Edéa in the Littoral Province.

Several smaller tributaries that drain the Centre&#x27;s Mbam division form the Sanaga. The Djérem flows in from the Adamawa and then through the far northeast of the area before entering the East Province to join the Lom (the upper Sanaga). The Djérem, like the Sanaga, is also subject to seasonal flooding. The Kim flows in from the Adamawa and through the northwestern portion of the Mbam division before merging with the Mbam River at the border with the West Province. The Mbam then empties into the Noun. The Noun, which flows in from the West Province, passes through the town of Bafia, and receives the flow of the Ndjim River north of Goura. The Noun then joins the Sanaga northeast of Monatélé. The Nyong is the only major river in the province that does not flow into the Sanaga. It rises in the East Province, passes through Mbalmayo, continues west, then forms the border between the Littoral and South provinces.

Because the Nyong flows completely through an equatorial climate, it has one period of high water during the rainy season (March to October), during which it is navigable from Mbalmayo to Abong-Mbang in the East Province. Other Centre Province rivers flow through both equatorial and tropical climate zones where rainy seasons occur at different times, and so they never experience great fluctuations in water level. All Centre Province rivers empty into the Atlantic Ocean via the Littoral and South.

Most of the Centre&#x27;s great demand for electricity is supplied from hydroelectric centres in neighbouring provinces. However, plans are in place for a dam on the Nyong at Njock-Mpoume and on the Sanaga at Nachtigal to better supply the region&#x27;s power needs.

Most lakes in the Centre are manmade and located in the Yaoundé area. The majority of these were created during the colonial period for the pursuit of water sports.

===Relief===
The Centre Province is entirely situated on the South Cameroon Plateau. The land varies from 500 to 1000 metres above sea level except for the valleys of the Sanaga and its tributaries, which dip as low as 200 metres. The land rises gently in escarpments from the southwestern coastal plain before joining the Adamawa Plateau via depressions and granite massifs. The terrain is characterised by rolling, forested hills, the tallest of which have bare, rocky tops. Deep valleys separate these. The province&#x27;s highest point is Mbam Minkom, northwest of Yaoundé, at 1,295 metres.

===Climate===
The Centre falls completely within a Type A or Guinea-type climate. This gives the region high humidity and precipitation, with rainfall averaging 1,000–2,000 mm each year. Precipitation is highest in the southernmost portions and diminishes toward the north. Temperatures are fairly steady, averaging 24˚ for the entire region except for the northwestern portions of Mbam division, where they fall to 23˚.

The Centre also experiences equatorial seasons, alternating between rainy and dry periods. The long dry season begins the year, running from December to May. After this comes the short rainy season, which lasts from May to June. The short dry season comes next, from July to October. The year ends in the long rainy season from October to November. North of 5˚, the dry periods last up to four months.

===Plant and animal life===
The Centre is forested except for the valleys of the Djérem, Mbam, and Noun rivers (most of the Mbam division) and the northern border region. These areas are woodland savanna and Sudano-Guinea savanna, respectively. The woodland savanna is characterised by large expanses of grass punctuated by small copses of trees from the forested zones farther south. The Sudano-Guinea portion is similar, only the grass grows more thinly, and trees are both evergreen and deciduous.

The region was once much more heavily forested, but exploitation of species such as ebony and iroko has thinned out the woodlands and allowed dense undergrowth to appear. This has also pushed the savanna farther south over time. Today there remains very little virgin land in the province. The Mfou Reserve (&quot;Réserve du Mfou&quot;) is one such area, recently created by the WWF and the GTZ to protect various bird, monkey, and snake species. Cameroonian wildlife also lives in the Mvog Betsi Zoo in Yaoundé.

In April 2019, 2 lions were discovered in Mpem and Djim National Park.

==Demographics==
===Settlement patterns===
With a population of more than 4 million, the Centre is one of the more densely populated of Cameroon&#x27;s provinces. The area has been an important population center for the Beti-Pahuin people for over a century, but it has since experienced a great amount of immigration due to the placement of Cameroon&#x27;s seat of government there in colonial times. Yaoundé&#x27;s presence has prompted the construction of a large and well-maintained road system, and this has contributed to the area&#x27;s boom. Another factor in the area&#x27;s growth is its multiple plantations, particularly in the cocoa-growing centre between the Sanaga and Nyong rivers and the sugar-cane area of Mbandjock, which draw thousands of migrant workers, mostly from the highly populated West and Littoral Provinces. As an important educational and government centre, Yaoundé also draws many more highly educated migrants.

The majority of the Centre&#x27;s residents live in the city of Yaoundé (population 1.1 million) or along the roads and in the major towns. The population density thins out away from the major thoroughfares, especially in the Mbam and Upper Sanaga divisions. A few isolated settlements, such as Nanga Eboko, also support a larger population.

Settlements in the Centre are traditionally placed along roads, resulting in large numbers of houses near the road with forest beginning directly behind them. The traditional house is a rectangular structure made of mud bricks and thin posts. Roofs are sometimes made of thatched raffia palm, but they are more often of corrugated aluminium, iron, or tin today.

===People===
The Centre is one of the most important centres for the Bantu group known as the Beti-Pahuin (&quot;Béti-Pahouin&quot;), the &quot;Fang-Beti,&quot; or simply the &quot;Fang&quot;. These peoples share a common language and have similar customs. The Beti-Pahuin are further broken down into the Beti, most of whom live in the Centre Province, and the Bulu and Fang, who primarily inhabit the South.

====Beti====
The Beti consist of several smaller groups. The Ewondo (or Yaoundé) occupy the Centre&#x27;s most populated region, including Yaoundé, Mbalmayo, and the Nyong and So division. The Yezum and Yebekolo are Ewondo sub-groups. The Bane are more numerous in the South Province, but they have some members in the Nyong and So division. The Mbida-Mbane and Mvog-Nyenge live east of Yaoundé. The Eton-Beti, Eton-Beloua, and Beloua-Eton are headquartered in the Lekie division northeast of Yaoundé, including the towns of Saa and Obala. The territory of the Mvelle stretches east from Yaoundé along the Nyong valley to the northern portions of the Nyong and Mfoumou division, including the border town of Ayos and the plantation centre of Mbandjock. The Eki live throughout the Upper Sanaga division with settlements at Nanga Eboko and Minta.

In addition, some peoples in the Centre are not truly Beti-Pahuin but are currently in the process of being assimilated by that group. Among these are the Manguissa, who live in a small territory in the Lekie division between the Sanaga River and the town of Sa&#x27;a, the Bamvele, Batchanga (Tsinga), Evuzok, Omvang, Yekaba, and Yetudi.

====Other tribes====
The area around the town of Bafia and the west-jutting finger of land on the border of the Littoral Province is the home of several related peoples, collectively referred to as the Banen or Bafia. Tribes in this group include the Ndiki, Ntundu, Lemande, and Yambetta. The Bape and Bekke are also a part, though they were assimilated only fairly recently.

Though more numerous in the West and Northwest Provinces, several Tikar groups live in the Centre at northwestern border with the West Province and stretching north and east to the Njim River. Their main settlement in the province is Ngambe Tikar on the Kim River. The Centre&#x27;s Tikar speak a language known as Tumu and its dialects. The Centre Province Tikar are further divided into the Bang-Heng, Bankim, Ditan, Ina, Ngambe, Ngume, Ue, and Yakong.

Large numbers of Bassa live in the Nyong and Kelle division near the border with the Littoral Province. They are primarily situated in small villages of isolated huts.

The Vute (Babuti) are a Bantu people who inhabit large swathes of the Mbam division to the east of Tikar and Bafia. Their domains are almost equal of those of the Beti in area.

Tribes present in smaller numbers in the province include the Bajem, Baki, Bamun, Bulu, Fa&#x27; (Balong), Gbete (Kepere), Gunu, Lafa, Maka, Njauti, Nyokon, and Pori. Several heterogeneous groups collectively known as the Yambassa live in and around Bafia-Banen territory.

Though most of these tribal groups have their own distinct languages, most people in the Centre also speak French.

===Religion===
European missionaries penetrated the territory under German and French colonial rule. Since, most of the region&#x27;s inhabitants have converted to Christianity. The most prevalent denominations are Presbyterianism and Roman Catholicism, though traditional animist beliefs are commonly practiced alongside Christianity, especially in more rural areas.

==Economy==
The Centre is one of Cameroon&#x27;s strongest economic zones due in great part to the presence of the capital city. In fact, the area is second only to the coastal regions of the Littoral, South, and Southwest Provinces. Many international organisations are headquartered at Yaoundé, among them the Bank of Central African States and the African Organisation of Industrial Property.

===Agriculture===

====Sustenance farming====

Most farmers in the Centre are largely concerned with the raising of crops such as plantains (common south of Yaoundé) and cocoyams and yams (common west and northwest of the capital). Rice and yam cultivation are practiced along the banks of the Sanaga in the Upper Sanaga division. Groundnuts, maize and other cereals are common in the province&#x27;s less humid north, and manioc grows throughout.

Sustenance farmers first clear small patches of forest. They remove trees with traditional tools such as axes or machetes during the dry season and burn the resulting brush. Farmers take care to protect trees bearing edible fruit, such as mangoes, plums, and pears, though fires sometimes grow out of control and prevent this. Farmers then plant seeds after the first rains: spices and vegetables closer to the house, plantains and tubers in larger plots farther into the bush. Villagers traditionally group their farms together as protection against animals and harvest their crops at the beginning of the dry season.

Such slash-and-burn agriculture is adequate for the needs of small villages away from larger urban centres. Soil is exhausted quickly, necessitating the change of fields every two or three years. The soil can remain infertile for as much as ten years. However, when settlements are sparse, this presents little problem. As one of Cameroon&#x27;s most populous areas, however, soil exhaustion has become an increasingly troublesome problem for the Centre in recent years. To combat this, MIDEVIV, the Food Development Authority, sets up growing zones around major towns, especially Yaoundé, for the growing of bananas, cocoyams, plantains, and other necessities.

====Plantation agriculture====
This region is one of Cameroon&#x27;s most important cash-crop zones due to its hot, humid climate and well-developed infrastructure. Cocoa is king, and it grows in all areas but the Mbam division. The largest plantations are those outside of Yaoundé and to a greater extent to the northwest between the Nyong and Sanaga Rivers. Other major cocoa centres include the Sanaga River valley near Nanga Eboko and the regions around the towns of Akonolinga, Obala, and Saa. Some of these plantations are owned by peasant populations of Bassa and Ewondo, and SODECAO (Cocoa Development Company) is a major owner.

The Centre is also home to Cameroon&#x27;s only sugar-cane plantations, located at Mbandjock. SOSUCAM (&quot;Société Sucrerie du Cameroun&quot;) is the largest company in the region with 40 km2. Peasant sugar plantations also operate in the area.

A variety of other crops make up the rest of the plantation economy. Rice cultivation occurs along the Sanaga River valley in fields owned by SARIOECOO. Coffee is another important crop, grown in the eastern forests. Tobacco plantations owned by the Cameroon Tobacco Company (CTC) lie north of the Sanaga River at Batchenga. Palm plantations for palm oil and kernels, are located in the lower Sanaga and Nyong valleys, in the Nyong and Kelle division. Most of these are owned by SOCAPALM, headquartered in Eséka. Pineapples are grown commercially at Mbandjock by the Cameroon Pineapple Company.

====Livestock====
Livestock raising is another important economic sector, and Yaoundé is a major market for cattle from other regions of the country. Cattle are raised on ranches owned by the Livestock Development Authority at Mbandjock, and poultry are raised in farms at Makak, Obala, and Yaoundé to supply the province&#x27;s vast demand for eggs and chicken. Sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry are also raised more informally throughout the area.

Hunting is practiced to some extent in more rural areas, but this has become increasingly rare as forest exploitation and firearms have depleted game species and their habitats. Bushmeat from the East and South Provinces is today a lucrative trade in Yaoundé and the large towns.

===Industry===

Because of its immense territory devoted to cultivation, the Centre also has a substantial food processing industry. For example, CAMSUCO (Cameroon Sugar Company) has a large processing plant in Nkoetang that supplies eighty percent of Cameroon&#x27;s sugar. SOCACAO (the Cameroon Cocoa Company) makes cocoa butter in Yaoundé. The Brasséries du Cameroun also operates in Yaoundé producing beers and soft drinks. Other food-processing plants are located in Nanga Eboko (rice hulling) and Eséka.

As it is the crossroads for logging vehicles travelling from the South and East Provinces, the Centre also has a sizeable timber processing industry. Major sawmills are located in Eséka, Mbalmayo, and Yaoundé. Other specialised plants do joinery work, veneer, furniture and construction.

The booming immigration to Yaoundé city has nourished a strong building industry there. Brick making and construction of homes and offices have ballooned in recent years. Rocks from around the capital are quarried for building material.

Artisans also form a significant slice of the economy. Those of Yaoundé have a co-op to help meet the needs of the tourist trade, while those of Nanga Eboko are renowned for their highly decorated pottery.

Diverse industries round out the Centre&#x27;s repertoire. One example is the Bastos Company, which produces cigarettes in Yaoundé. Textiles are another major industry, and cotton gins operate in Yaoundé. The capital is also a major fabric production centre. Rutile is mined at Akonolinga.

===Transportation===
The Centre is the crossroads of Cameroon, and as such, it is well equipped to handle the large amount of traffic that passes through. Most roads between towns and to neighbouring provinces are paved, and most of these lead to Yaoundé. The capital also serves as the transportation and shipping heart of the area, and to a smaller extent, Cameroon as a whole.

National Road 1 heads from Yaoundé all the way to Kousséri and Fotoko in the Far North Province. National Road 2 heads south from the capital to Ambam before continuing into Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. National Road 3, Cameroon&#x27;s most heavily trafficked and thus most dangerous, covers the stretch between Yaoundé and Douala. National Road 4 travels northwest to Bafoussam in the West Province. National Road 9, one of the few that do not travel through the capital, begins at Mbalmayo and leads to the South Province towns of Sangmélima, Djoum, and Mintom. Finally, National Road 10 travels east from Yaoundé to Ayos and ultimately Bonis in the East Province.

The Centre also forms an important hub of transportation by rail, air, and river. Train lines travel from Yaoundé to Douala and to Ngaoundéré in the north. An international airport is located just outside Yaoundé at Nsimalen, and airstrips are at Akonolinga, Bafia, Eséka, Mbandjock, and Nanga Eboko. The Nyong River is navigable from Mbalmayo northeast to Abong-Mbang in the East during the wet season.

===Tourism===
Many international visitors to Cameroon see at least the city of Yaoundé, if nowhere else. The majority of these travellers visit on company or government business, so the Centre sees little tourism &quot;per se&quot;. Yaoundé does offer many hotels, however, to handle the business and diplomatic traffic through the city. It is also the location of several manmade lakes used for sport and bathing. Most of Cameroon&#x27;s monuments and museums are located in the capital.

Several of the province&#x27;s traditional chief&#x27;s compounds are accessible to visitors. Among these is the compound of Matip Ma Ndombol of the Ndjogjel district of Eséka.

==Administration and social conditions==
Cameroon&#x27;s president, Paul Biya, has his official residence in Yaoundé, though he spends much of his time abroad. Biya enjoys a great deal of political support from the Centre&#x27;s Beti majority, thanks in part to his policy of staffing the government and government-owned businesses with plenty of representatives of this ethnic group.

===Government===
The province is divided into ten departments (&quot;):
# Lekié, with its capital at Monatélé, is northwest of Yaoundé
# Haute-Sanaga (Upper Sanaga), with its capital Nanga Eboko, in the west and centre of the province
# Mbam-et-Inoubou (Mbam and Inoubou), with its capital at Bafia,
# Mbam-et-Kim (Mbam and Kim), with its capital at Ntui, is the largest, occupying almost the entire northern half of the province
# Méfou-et-Afamba (Méfou and Afamba), with its capital at Mfou, is the area east and south of Yaoundé.
# Méfou-et-Akono (Méfou and Akono), with its capital at Ngoumou.
# Mfoundi consists entirely of the Yaoundé capital and greater area.
# Nyong-et-Kéllé (Nyong and Kéllé), with its capital at Eséka, occupies the southwest corner of the province.
# Nyong-et-Mfoumou (Nyong and Mfoumou) is opposite this at the southeast, governed from Akonolinga.
# Nyong-et-So&#x27;o (Nyong and So&#x27;o), with Mbalmayo as its capital, is on the central border with the South Province.

Each of these departments is headed by a presidentially appointed prefect (&quot;), also called a senior divisional officer. The governor, also a presidential appointee, has his offices in Yaoundé.

====Traditional political organisation====
Several of the Centre&#x27;s native peoples have at least some form of political organisation predating the colonial period. However, the province&#x27;s majority, the various Beti peoples, has no strong traditions in this sector. Instead, a patriarch traditionally heads a clan of related families. These individuals can still be found today, though their positions are largely honorary.

The Tikar, on the other hand, have strong political traditions. Each Tikar group is headed by a fon (foyn), who serves as the head of administration, religion, and ritualistic affairs. Below him are various nobles and lords who handle administrative tasks in smaller divisions of territory.

Among the Banen, some sub-tribal groups are headed by a chief. Such individuals are rare, but they rule with absolute authority where they occur. Most Banen are merely loose connections of family groups, however. The Bafia and Yambassa have a similar structure with clans of family groups. The heads of the joint-families are the most important individuals in this traditional hierarchy.

===Education===
The Centre is the intellectual capital of Cameroon. The University of Yaoundé is the biggest and most important institution in the country, though smaller universities exist in the capital city and other towns. Yaoundé also tends to draw more educated migrants, as the jobs available there are often in government or for the various international organisations that have their headquarters there.

Primary and secondary schools are also fairly widespread and easily accessible to most of the Centre&#x27;s population. Primary schools are more widely distributed, even in many smaller villages. Secondary schools are less common, but due to the region&#x27;s well-developed transportation network, students are able to travel to the larger towns where such schools are located relatively easily. This still requires them to stay with relatives or to lease rooms, however, high rent and school fees keep many students from pursuing higher levels of education. Due to the region&#x27;s high population, many of these schools are critically understaffed and overcrowded.

===Health===
The Centre is serviced by a large number of hospitals and clinics, particularly in Yaoundé and in the larger towns. Traditional medicine is still common throughout, especially in the more rural areas.

As with the rest of Cameroon, sanitation is the greatest health problem faced in the province. In rural areas, running water is not available, necessitating the drinking of water from contaminated rivers, streams, and swamps. The urban areas, particularly Yaoundé, present their own problems, as rates of population growth far outpace improvements in sanitation. As a result, outbreaks of illnesses such as amoebic dysentery, bacterial dysentery, and hepatitis A occur frequently. Large rainfall and inadequate drainage improvements also provide an ideal breeding ground for malaria-carrying mosquitoes in the capital.

===Cultural life===
The majority of Cameroon&#x27;s museums are located in Yaoundé. The largest of these is the Cameroonian Art Museum (&quot;Musée d&#x27;Art Camerounais&quot;), with its large collection of bas reliefs, bronze statuary, and traditional masks. This is also the only museum set up to handle both English- and French-speaking patrons. The Afhemi Museum is located in a private residence and showcases the owners own collection of Cameroonian art. The National Museum, located in the mansion once occupied by the French governor, offers cultural as well as artistic exhibits.

The Centre is also the birthplace of bikutsi, a popular form of dance and music. The Ewondo people created the style, which today rivals makossa as Cameroon&#x27;s most famous.

==History==

===Early population movements===
Ancient tools found at Bafia, Efok, Okola, and Yaoundé attest to human presence in today&#x27;s Centre Province since before recorded history. Of Cameroon&#x27;s current inhabitants, the Baka pygmies probably roamed the area when it was more heavily wooded. In comparison, the modern inhabitants of the area are relative newcomers.

According to one theory, much of the current Centre Province was once Bassa territory. The Bassa moved into the region from northeast of the Sanaga River before the 17th or 18th century. Another explanation of the Bassa&#x27;s presence in the Centre says that they once lived further west, but they moved into the territory in the 18th century after ceding their coastal possessions to the Duala people. The Banen, Bafia, and Yambassa in the Babimbi region also moved to their present territories at this time, stopping their expansion upon reaching Bassaland to the southwest.

The next wave of migration was in the 19th century and consisted of those peoples fleeing Fulbe (Fula) raids to the north, or else fleeing other tribes who were themselves being raided. It is possible that the Tikar of the province&#x27;s northwest moved in at this time. The Vute entered the area from the southern Adamawa Plateau, having once inhabited the present territories of Banyo and Tibati. Vute tradition states that they moved south in three major groups, each under a different prince. The Vute were still in the process of migrating when the Germans finally stopped their progress.

The Beti-Pahuin moved into the region at this time as well, travelling through in three separate waves from northeast, south of the Sanaga River. They were being pressured by the Gbaya, Mbum, and Vute farther north. As these people moved south, the Beti-Pahuin were forced to move further south, as well. The Beti-Pahuin conquered the peoples they encountered on this southward march, &quot;Pahuinising&quot; them in the process or pushing them away in their turn. A reputation for cannibalism may have aided them in their conquests. If the Bassa did indeed once inhabit territories further to the east, it was at this time that they were pressed toward the coast. These Beti-Pahuin groups moved southward to their present territories in small groups of families of clans. These first few waves, consisting of the Bulu and the Fang, continued into the present South Province and beyond, but the Beti, who moved south in the final wave, settled north of these relatives.

The Bati-Tsinga were the original inhabitants of the current Banen-Bafia-Yambassa areas, but they were pushed away or assimilated when the Yambassa entered the region. The Yambassa came in search of farmland, moving in three major groups: the Behele, then the Elip, and finally the Kouono-Yambassa. They were pushed south in turn when the Banen-Bafia entered from the confluence of the Mbam and Noun rivers. They were then troubled by the Bamun to the northwest, and the Banen fought two wars with them beginning around 1840; they eventually pushed the Bamun across the Noun, though some Banen groups paid tribute to the Bamun until 1901. One tradition says that the Bafia also fought off the Fulbe. The other small tribes of the Bafia region came at later times.

===European contacts===
The movement of the Beti-Pahuin through the region coincided with the height of the European slave trade on Cameroon&#x27;s coast. The Ewondo took the opportunity to establish themselves as middlemen in this trade, forming a link between the tribes further on the interior and those toward the sea. Their slaves were sent out via the Sanaga River in exchange for European goods. After Great Britain outlawed the slave trade in 1827, trade continued in other goods, though slaves still left the area clandestinely. The Bassa also enjoyed similar go-between status.

This period also saw the introduction of Christianity to the region when the Basel Mission set up a station at Eséka.

===German administration===
Three years after the German annexation of the Cameroons in 1884, the first white men moved in, under orders of governor Julius Baron Von Soden, to explore the territories of the Beti. A later governor, Jesko Von Puttkamer, began extensive plantation farming in the south of Cameroon, particularly of cocoa, which he introduced in 1905. Native peoples were used as forced labour. In response to this and to their loss of lucrative trade to the Germans, the Ewondo revolted in 1895 but were suppressed the next year. Other rebellions occurred under the Bane and Mbidambani. A second Ewondo resistance occurred in 1907 when the Germans tried to prop up their collaborator, Charles Atangana, as the over-chief of all Ewondo.

Germany made various improvements to the territory, including the building of roads from Cameroon&#x27;s coast to the inland areas, beginning in 1900. The first long-distance automobile journey took place in 1913, from Kribi to Yaoundé, a distance of 280 km, in eleven hours. The Germans also brought the railroad to the area, beginning a line from Douala to Yaoundé in 1909. Work was stopped at the outbreak of World War I, however. Germany moved the capital of the colony from Buea to Yaoundé at this time. Some of the Centre&#x27;s largest towns and cities were originally German outposts, including Yaoundé (founded in 1889) and Mbalmayo.

A Catholic mission and school were established in Yaoundé in 1901 by the German Pallotin Fathers. This was followed by similar setups in other settlements until 1907. The Presbyterians were quick to follow, establishing a presence in 1909.

===French administration===
The French gained control of the Centre Province territory in 1916 after World War I. They divided Cameroon into several zones, and the current Centre Province&#x27;s area fell into the Yaoundé, Edéa-Eséka, and Ebolowa-Akoafim zones.

Much of France&#x27;s administration of the territory was simply a continuation of policies set up by the Germans. The French continued Germany&#x27;s plantations, for example, and expanded them aggressively. The French Company for the Development of Tobacco (SFDT) set up in Batchenga near Yaoundé in 1947, and the sugar plantation at Mbandjock was planted in 1964. In fact, the town of Mbandjock did not exist then but grew up around the French sugar cane. The French also maintained the German policy of propping up puppet chiefs when existing traditional rulers were uncooperative or where such native rulers were absent. They also opened a school in Yaoundé on 27 December 1933 to educate and indoctrinate the sons of chiefs.

France made many more improvements to the territory, as well. To begin with, though Germany had moved the Cameroonian capital to Yaoundé, the French made it look the part. They built large, opulent government buildings there, including a governor&#x27;s mansion. The railroad between Douala and Yaoundé was finished in 1927, and this was modernised in 1933. The main road from Douala and on to Bertoua was widened and improved in 1939. Yaoundé also became the location of an international airport. In the realm of education, an Advanced Primary School was placed in Yaoundé in 1939, and Ayos became the site of a nursing school in 1925.

The French expansion into the region also allowed better access for missionary groups. The Seventh-day Adventists set up centres in Nanga Eboko and Yaoundé, and this religion continues to claim large numbers of followers in the province. A major Catholic seminary opened in Yaoundé in 1927.

====Political developments====
By making Yaoundé the centre of government, France also made it the centre of the colony&#x27;s politics. After France made all its West African colonies self-governing in 1956, many of Cameroon&#x27;s earliest political parties were located there. The biggest of these were the Union Camerounaise, with large constituencies in the Centre and North (led by Ahmido Ahidjo), and the Democrats Camerounais (DC), with support from the Yaoundé region and headed by André-Marie Mbida. Most of these parties offered a pro-independence platform.

The capital was also the natural site of early political protests. When the colony&#x27;s most vocal political party, Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), rioted there over raised prices at Yaoundé market stalls, for example, the government outlawed the group. This led to multiple clashes between pro- and anti-UPC factions in Yaoundé, which continued even after independence in 1960.

===Post-independence===
Under Cameroon&#x27;s first president, Amadou Ahidjo, Cameroon was split into seven provinces. The present-day Centre and South Provinces were at this time combined into one Centre-South Province. It would remain this way until Cameroon&#x27;s second president, Paul Biya, split the Centre-South into the present Centre and South Provinces on 22 August 1983. Under Ahidjo, the railway was pushed northeast, reaching Bélabo in the East Province in 1974. In an effort to better unify the north and south portions of the country, Ahidjo also ordered a road built north from Yaoundé to Ngaoundéré (National Road 1). Ahidjo also paved major roads, including the stretches between Douala and Yaoundé and Bafoussam and Yaoundé, beginning in 1966.

Education also experienced improvement. The University of Yaoundé was founded in 1962 for a student body of 7,500. After large student protests in 1973 and 1980 against overcrowding of the facilities, that institution was decentralised, and other universities were opened in other regions of the country.

<text>Konstantin Josef Jireček (24 July 1854 10 January 1918) was an Austro-Hungarian Czech historian, politician, diplomat, and Slavist. He was the founder of Bohemian Balkanology (or Balkan Studies) and Byzantine studies, and wrote extensively on Bulgarian and Serbian history. Jireček was also a minister in the government of the Principality of Bulgaria for a couple of years.

==Life==
Jireček was the son of Czech historian Josef Jireček (1825–1888) and Božena, a daughter of Slovak philologist Pavel Jozef Šafárik (1795–1861). His family was deeply involved in Slavistics.

Jireček was raised in Vienna and enrolled in the 1864–1872 period at Theresianum, a prestigious preparatory school in Vienna. During his education, he became very interested in and studied several foreign languages (French, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian, Italian, Russian, English, Hungarian, Turkish and Greek). In 1872 he became a student at the Philological Faculty at the University of Prague, where he studied history and modern philology. At this time, his nearest friends included French historian Ernest Denis (1849–1921) and the sons of Bulgarian theatre director and actor Krastyo Pishurka. In 1874 he took a study trip to Croatia-Slavonia and Serbia, after which he published several essays on the history and traditions of the South Slavic countries.

In 1876 he had his first book published, the &quot;History of the Bulgarians&quot;, a historiographical work spanning the medieval Bulgarian state foundation to the Ottoman conquest, which attracted great attention to the 22-year-old historian. This was due to the European public&#x27;s interest in the April Uprising of the Bulgarian people, a people little known in Europe at the time. For his dissertation on the history of the Bulgarians, Jireček was awarded the title of doctor in philosophy in 1876. In 1877, his habilitation work was divided between Constantinople and Belgrade (Serbia).

After the end of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), which saw the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state, he helped construct the administration, school system and economy in the newly founded Principality of Bulgaria. In 1879 he was employed by the Bulgarian government, and from May to July 1881 he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, then until 1882 as Minister of Science. In 1884, he was appointed director of the National Library in Sofia. During his stay, he devoted himself to research in Balkanology and Byzantine Studies. He published his results in numerous studies and monographs. Overall Konstantin Jireček made significant contributions to the establishment of a modern educational system and overall social change in Bulgaria in the first years after the creation of the modern state in 1878.

From 1884 to 1893 he taught universal history as a full professor at the Charles University in Prague. After that, he was a professor of Slavic philology at the University of Vienna until his death in 1918. Carl Patsch succeeded the office at Vienna.

==Work==
The bulk of Jireček&#x27;s writings deal with the history of the South Slavs and their literature. They notably include a &quot;History of the Bulgarians&quot; (Czech and German, 1876), &quot;History of Serbs&quot;, &quot;The Principality of Bulgaria&quot; (1891), &quot;Travels in Bulgaria&quot; (Czech, 1888), etc. He mostly wrote in German.

<doc id="901940" wikidata="Q126604" url="?curid=901940" title="First Vienna Award">
<text>The First Vienna Award was a treaty signed on 2 November 1938 pursuant to the Vienna Arbitration, which took place at Vienna&#x27;s Belvedere Palace. The arbitration and award were direct consequences of the previous month&#x27;s Munich Agreement, which resulted in the partitioning of Czechoslovakia.

Though some from the government called for military action, Hungarian revisionism primarily aimed to restore the historical boundaries peacefully. In the interwar period, Hungary was weaker economically and militarily than the neighbours against which it had territorial claims. Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy had supported the territorial claims of the Kingdom of Hungary, and revision of the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. Nazi Germany had already violated the Versailles Treaty by the remilitarization of the Rhineland (7 March 1936) and the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria (12 March 1938).

The First Vienna Award separated, from Czechoslovakia, territories in southern Slovakia and southern Carpathian Rus&#x27; which were mostly Hungarian-populated and returned them to Hungary. Hungary thus regained some of the territories (now parts of Slovakia and Ukraine) which Hungary had lost after World War I under the Treaty of Trianon. Czechoslovakia also ceded to Poland small patches of land in Spiš and Orava regions.

In mid-March 1939 Adolf Hitler gave Hungary permission to occupy the remainder of Carpathian Rus&#x27; (officially known as Carpatho-Ukraine since December 1938). This advanced Hungary&#x27;s territory northward, up to the Polish border, thereby restoring a common Hungarian–Polish border, which had existed before the 1772 First Partition of Poland-Lithuania. Before the end of World War I and the Treaties of Trianon and Saint Germain, the Carpathian region of the former Kingdom of Hungary (Transleithania) in Austria-Hungary had, to the north, bordered the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, a constituent part of Austria&#x27;s Cisleithania.

Six months after Hungary occupied the remainder of Carpathian Rus&#x27;, in September 1939, after the German invasion of Poland, the Polish government and tens of thousands of Polish soldiers (including airmen and ground crews) including Stanisław Maczek&#x27;s 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade 
as well as volunteers (collectively known as &quot;Sikorski&#x27;s tourists&quot; by reference to an official statement by Joseph Goebbels) evacuated to internment Hungary and Romania, from where (thanks partly to the tacit acceptance local governments) were able to go on to on to France and to French-mandated Syria to fight in the Polish Armed Forces in the West. 

After World War II, the 1947 Treaty of Paris declared the Vienna Award null and void.

== Background ==
=== International situation ===

From 1933 Hungary closely coordinated its foreign policies with those of Nazi Germany, in the hope of revising Hungary&#x27;s borders as established in the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. In March 1933 Hungary&#x27;s prime minister declared that Hungary &quot;wanted justice on the historical principle&quot; and desired the restoration to Hungary of Hungarian-inhabited territories that Hungary had lost after World War I. In June 1933 Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös visited Germany, meeting with Adolf Hitler, and they concluded that Czechoslovakia was a principal obstacle to a &quot;rearrangement&quot; of Central Europe and therefore should be subverted internally, isolated internationally, and finally eliminated by military force. During a meeting with Hitler in August 1936, Miklós Horthy advocated a common attack against Czechoslovakia to excise a &quot;cancerous tumor from the heart of Europe&quot;.

In late 1937 Hitler decided to open a campaign against Czechoslovakia. In 1938 Germany and Hungary focused on creating a common platform to that end, and in November 1938 Hitler negotiated with the Hungarian government concerning the fate of Czechoslovakia.

Hungarian representatives considered an overt attack on Czechoslovakia too dangerous and wanted to preserve that country&#x27;s relations with France and Britain, whose support in the question of Hungarian minorities was conditional on Hungary&#x27;s not joining with Germany in military actions. This outraged Hitler and led to a change in Germany&#x27;s view of Hungarian territorial demands in eastern Czechoslovakia.

Before the Munich Agreement, a Hungarian government emissary had officially asked the German and Italian delegations to resolve Hungarian demands together with the questions of Sudeten Germans. However, Hitler did not agree because he was not satisfied with the previous passivity of Hungary and because he had his own plans for Central Europe. The French and British delegates, Prime Minister Édouard Daladier and Neville Chamberlain, saw potential danger in such a complex solution, but the Italian delegate, Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, allowed Hungarian demands to be reflected in an appendix to the agreement. It requested Czechoslovakia to resolve questions with Hungary and Poland within three months by bilateral negotiations, or matters would be resolved by the four signatories of the agreement.

After the acceptance of the ultimatum concerning Trans-Olza, which had been annexed by Czechoslovakia in 1920 after the Czechoslovak invasion that triggered the Polish-Czechoslovak War, up to the armistice line, and smaller disputed border areas by Poland, the Hungarian question had remained open. Poland later annexed further small border territories in northern Slovakia (on 1 December 1938, villages in Kysuce, Orava and Spiš) comprising 226 km2, with 4,280 inhabitants (see separate article, Polish–Czechoslovak border conflicts). The Hungarian government understood the appendix of the Munich Agreement as an agreement of the Great Powers for the revision of peace treaties and emphasised that it did not mean only the revision of borders based on ethnicity but also the eventual restoration of Hungarian territory before 1918 and the creation of a common border with Poland. Official Hungarian circles were aware that Hungary alone was too weak to enforce its territorial demands towards Czechoslovakia because they knew that any attack would encounter the resistance of the more modern Czechoslovak Army.

Therefore, Hungary decided to fight Czechoslovakia in the diplomatic field instead and to push for territorial revision in the spirit of Munich Agreement.

=== Border conflicts and sabotage ===
The Munich Agreement had defined a three-month period to resolve Hungarian demands, but the Hungarian government pushed to start negotiations immediately. The pressure was increased by the Hungarians with border conflicts and diversion actions in Czechoslovakia. The first conflict occurred in the early morning of October 5, 1938, when troops of the Royal Hungarian Army crossed the border and attacked Czechoslovak positions near Jesenské with the goal of capturing Rimavská Sobota. Hungarian troops withdrew after the arrival of Czechoslovak reinforcements, which killed nine Hungarians and captured prisoners. Two days later, Hungarian troops again attempted to cross the Danube near Parkan (Párkány). The Czechoslovak situation was worse in Carpathian Ruthenia, with its lower density of fortifications; there paramilitary units of the Rongyos Gárda infiltrated Czechoslovakia. The first two units of the Rongyos Gárda crossed the border on October 6, 1938, and two days later, they blew up the bridge over the Borozhava River.

Such actions continued during the negotiations and after the First Vienna Award. During the second day of bilateral negotiations (October 10, 1938), Hungarian troops murdered a railway officer in Borozhava and damaged railway facilities.

=== Internal situation in Czechoslovakia ===
Czechoslovakia had an interest in stabilising the situation because its foreign ministry had to resolve problems with Poland and Germany and did not want to start negotiations before October 15. The Czechoslovak minister of foreign affairs was focused on building new relationships with Germany and Italy to negotiate guarantees for new borders. After the Munich Agreement, all political subjects in Slovakia concluded that it is necessary to change the Slovak position and declared its autonomy on October 6, 1938. The new autonomous government understood the definition of borders as a priority, and the Slovak People&#x27;s Party requested to participate in the negotiations. The central government in Prague was aware that the delegation should be led by a Slovak and considered Milan Hodža or Imrich Karvaš. However, after the creation of an autonomous government, Foreign Minister František Chvalkovský proposed its representatives: Jozef Tiso or Ferdinand Ďurčanský. Both politicians at first refused on the justification that the role was in competition with the central government. After it had been emphasised that it is mainly the interest of Slovakia, they decided to accept. Moreover, Tiso hoped that his Hungarian partners would more likely accept concessions if they did not negotiate with representatives of the central government.

Under the pressure of the threat of internal destabilisation of Czechoslovakia because of diverting actions and the further radicalisation of the situation in Hungary, Czechoslovakia agreed to begin negotiations on October 9.

== Pre-arbitration negotiations ==
=== In Komárno ===
Negotiations were held between October 9 and October 13, 1938, in Komárno, on the Slovak northern bank of the Danube River, just on the border with Hungary. The Czechoslovak delegation was led by Jozef Tiso, the prime minister of the autonomous government, without any experience with similar negotiations, and it included Ferdinand Ďurčanský, Minister of Justice in the Slovak cabinet, and General Rudolf Viest. The central government of Czechoslovakia was represented by Ivan Krno, Political Director of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who held rank of Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. Autonomous Carpathian Ruthenia was represented by Ivan Párkányi, who was a minister without portfolio. The Czechoslovak (Slovak and Ruthenian) delegation was not completely prepared for lack of time. By contrast, the Hungarian delegation comprised experienced individuals and was led by Foreign Minister Kálmán Kánya and Education Minister Pál Teleki. The Hungarian government welcomed the composition of Czechoslovak delegation and believed that it would be easier to influence the inexperienced Slovak politicians by promises. That expectation was not fulfilled since other Slovak delegates rejected any possibility of returning to Hungary.

The Hungarian government&#x27;s strategy for the negotiations was to demand areas in which at least 50% of Hungarians lived according to the 1910 census. That formulation was chosen with respect to the signers of the Munich Agreement, but Hungary also requested areas that did not match those criteria. On the first day, Hungary supplied memorandum with the requested territorial changes. The Hungarians further demanded a plebiscite in the remaining territory in which Slovaks and Ruthenians would declare whether they wanted to be incorporated into Hungary.

Hungary demanded territories up to and including a line defined by Devín (Hungarian: &quot;Dévény&quot;), Bratislava (&quot;Pozsony&quot;), Nitra (&quot;Nyitra&quot;), Tlmače (&quot;Garamtolmács&quot;), Levice (&quot;Léva&quot;), Lučenec (&quot;Losonc&quot;), Rimavská Sobota (&quot;Rimaszombat&quot;), Jelšava (&quot;Jolsva&quot;), Rožňava (&quot;Rozsnyó&quot;), Košice (&quot;Kassa&quot;), Trebišov (&quot;Tőketerebes&quot;), Pavlovce nad Uhom (&quot;Pálóc&quot;), Uzhhorod (, Hungarian: &quot;Ungvár&quot;), Mukacheve (&quot;Mukačevo&quot;, &quot;Munkács&quot;), and Vinogradiv (&quot;Nagyszőlős&quot;). The territory was 14,106 km2 (with 12,124 km2 in Slovakia and 1,982 km2 in Carpathian Ruthenia). It included 1,346,000 citizens (1,136,000 in Slovakia, 210,000 in Carpathian Ruthenia). According to the last census, 678,000 of them had declared a non-Hungarian nationality (553,000 in Slovakia, 125,000 in Carpathian Ruthenia) in 1930.

Hungary also requested the immediate takeover of two border towns from Czechoslovakia as a &quot;goodwill gesture&quot;. The Czechoslovak delegation agreed on the railway town of Slovenské Nové Mesto (until 1918, it had been a suburb of the Hungarian town of Sátoraljaújhely) and the town of Šahy (). Both were occupied by Hungary on October 12.

The main difference between both parties&#x27; arguments was that the Hungarians presented the 1910 census figures, as had Germany during the Munich Conference, but Czechoslovakia presented the latest 1930 figures and contested the validity of the 1910 census. Later, Czechoslovakia also presented figures from Hungarian censuses before 1900. It considered the 1910 census as unacceptable because it represented the peak of Magyarization and differed from previous Hungarian and later Czechoslovak censuses as well as postwar censuses from other countries in which the Hungarian minority lived (Austria, Romania and Yugoslavia). Tiso noted that he, for example, had been counted as a Hungarian during that census.

Meanwhile, the Hungarian delegation did not accept the results of the Czechoslovak census and proposed to use the 1880 Hungarian census, before the peak of Magyarization, as a compromise. The Hungarians also did not agree on the definition of purely-Hungarian towns like Košice.

The request for a plebiscite on Slovaks and Ruthenians for rejoining Hungary was rejected by Czechoslovakia as irrelevant because the Munich Agreement did not address question of either nation, the idea violated the sovereignty of Czechoslovakia and the Ruthenian delegate declared that the Ruthenian nation (except communists) had already expressed its will to live in Czechoslovakia.

The Hungarian delegation rejected several Czechoslovak proposals, such as an offer to create an autonomous Hungarian territory within Slovakia. Kánya characterised the proposal as a &quot;bad joke&quot; and declared that it was &quot;absolutely impossible to discuss this question&quot;. Czechoslovakia then offered to cede Great Rye Island (Slovak: &quot;Žitný ostrov&quot;, Hungarian: &quot;Csallóköz&quot;, 1838 km2, with 105,418 inhabitants, almost all of whom were Hungarians), the creation of a free port in the town of Komárno and a population exchange in the remaining frontier regions.

Hungary turned down that offer as well, and on October 13, the Czechoslovak delegation proposed another solution. The goal of the Czechoslovak proposal was to the create borders with balanced minorities in both states (including Slovaks in Békés County). As well as the principle of balanced minorities, the proposal included the Czechoslovak strategic interest of preserving the railway to Carpathian Ruthenia. Pál Teleki rejected the proposal without a deeper study as a &quot;humorous border&quot;, and the Hungarian delegation &quot;analysed the map only to be polite&quot;.

Although the Czechoslovak delegation declared that it was open for further discussion about its proposal and offered consultation with its experts, the Hungarian delegation rejected further discussion. On the evening of October 13, after consultations in Budapest, Kánya declared that the negotiations had failed and asked the four signatories of the Munich Agreement to be the adjudicators. As the United Kingdom and France had decided not to make any decision, the adjudicators became German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano.

=== German mediation ===
On October 13, the day that the negotiations deadlocked, Hungary conducted a partial mobilisation. Czechoslovakia performed actions to strengthen its security and declared martial law in the frontier region. After the failure of bilateral negotiations, the border dispute escalated to a wider international level. The Axis powers took the initiative in favour of Hungary to realise their own plans for the region.

Hungary sent delegations to both Italy and Germany. Count Csáky went to Rome. Kálmán Darányi went to Germany and told Hitler that Hungary was ready to fight and &quot;[would] not accept the behavior of the Slovaks&quot;. However, the situation in Central Europe changed after the Munich Agreement, and the German-Hungarian-Polish bloc was over. Germany refused to take steps to strengthen Hungary. Hitler declared that if Hungary started a conflict, nobody would help it. He rejected the idea of a common conference of the four signers of the Munich Agreement, the demands for plebiscites in Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia and the Hungarian claims for Bratislava. Instead, he advised Hungary to continue the negotiations and to preserve the ethnic principle. He proposed for Germany to act as a mediator. Ribbentrop and Darányi agreed on a map which would be offered to Czechoslovakia (&quot;Ribbentrop line&quot;). The line later became source of misunderstanding between Hungary and Germany. According to Darányi, Ribbentrop did not accept his requests because several important towns remained on the Czechoslovak side (Bratislava, Nitra, Uzhorod and Mukachevo; the question of Košice was open). Germany rejected the accusations and declared that Ribbentrop line was created after it had consulted Darányi and that he had agreed to it. When the Hungarian government insisted, Ribbentrop announced that German mediation had ended.

At the same time as Darányi, Czechoslovak Foreign Minister František Chvalkovský also visited Germany to negotiate with its representatives. Hitler blamed Czechoslovakia for the failure of negotiations with Hungary and requested their renewal. He gave Chvalkovský a map with the Ribbentrop line and promised to guarantee new borders, which were based on that proposal. Back in Prague, Chvalkovský recommended to accept the Ribbentrop line. However, the Slovak autonomous government was against such a solution and hoped to achieve further corrections. On October 19, Tiso and Ďurčanský met with Ribbentrop in Munich and managed to persuade him to assign Košice to Czechoslovakia and to accept the prior proposal of keeping balanced minorities both in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Czechoslovak experts prepared material that argued that the Hungarian statistics were unreliable and that the Hungarian demands did not comply with the ethnic principle but were driven by foreign policy and strategic factors. They argued that Hungarian claims for Košice were not motivated by ethnic or historical reasons but focused on the elimination of the largest communication, economic and cultural centre it the east and on the interruption of the railway to Carpathian Ruthenia and allied Romania. That would totally isolate the eastern part of the republic, which could be later annexed by Hungary. Both Tiso and Ďurčanský believed that they had persuaded Hitler. Tiso sent a letter to Prague to notify on the positive results.

A few days later, Ribbentrop revealed himself to be quite hostile to the Hungarians. As Ciano saw it, &quot;The truth is that he intends to protect Czechoslovakia as far as he can and sacrifice the ambitions, even the legitimate ambitions, of Hungary&quot;.

After October 17, activities around Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; intensified. Poland proposed a partition of Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; among Hungary, Poland and Romania. Romania, a staunch ally of Czechoslovakia against Hungary, rejected the proposal and even offered military support for Czechoslovakia in Subcarpathia. Hungary, in turn, attempted to persuade the Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; representatives to become part of Hungary. A common Polish-Hungarian border, which would arise by a Hungarian annexation of Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;, had been a longtime dream of both Poland and Hungary,

Poland was moving troops toward that border for support. However, since a common Polish-Hungarian frontier would mean a flanking of Germany, Germany was willing to face such a frontier only if Poland compensated by giving the Danzig Corridor to Germany. Poland refused the German proposal.

On October 20, the Rusyns produced a resolution more or less in favour of a plebiscite on all of Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; becoming part of Hungary. Five days later, Subcarpathian Prime Minister Andriy Borody was arrested in Prague, and Subcarpathian Foreign Minister Avhustyn Voloshyn was appointed prime minister. He was willing to consider the cession of only ethnically-Hungarian territories to Hungary and rejected the idea of a plebiscite.

=== Final failure of bilateral negotiations ===
Negotiations between Czechoslovakia and Hungary resumed by diplomatic channels. Czechoslovakia adopted the &quot;Ribbentrop line&quot; in the hope that it would receive a guarantee of new borders from the side of Axis powers and proposed it officially on October 22. Czechoslovakia offered to cede Hungary territory that had 494,646 Hungarians and 168,632 Slovaks and to retain Bratislava, Nitra and Košice. Hungary turned down the proposal, which caused Germany to withdraw its position as mediator. Hungary demanded for the territories offered by Czechoslovakia to be immediately occupied by Hungary, for there be a plebiscite in the disputed territory and for Subcarpathia to &quot;decide its own future&quot;. Czechoslovakia found it unacceptable to cede territories immediately that had not been the subject of discussion and to resolve the question of the remaining parts later. By accepting the proposal, Czechoslovak border fortifications would become Hungarian, and the Hungarian Army could invade more Czechoslovak territory.

Hungary also warned that if Czechoslovakia refused that proposal, Hungary would demand arbitration (Italo-German in Western Slovakia, Italo-German-Polish in Eastern Slovakia and Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;). Then, Czechoslovakia would have no choice but to accept Hungarian demands or to agree with arbitration. That decision was forced also by fact that both France and Britain had lost interest on Czechoslovakia and considered the region to be in the German sphere of influence.

Both parties hoped that Germany would support their demands. The Slovak autonomous government also accepted the idea of arbitration with unrealistic expectations, based on Ribbentrop&#x27;s assurances.

Although the Hungarian government demanded arbitration, it had not had have the prior approval of Germany, which insisted on its negative opinion, Hitler&#x27;s disagreement, Ribbentrop&#x27;s disappointment with previous negotiations with Darányi and the danger of military conflict if one country did not accept the results.

Hungary managed to persuade Italy that the powerful German influence that was exercised through Czechoslovakia could be eliminated by a strong Hungary. Ciano accepted the proposal and promised to advocate Hungarian interests. During Ribbentrop&#x27;s visit to Rome (October 27–30, 1938), Ciano persuaded Ribbentrop on the importance of arbitration for the Axis powers&#x27;s future position in the region, and Ribbentrop promised to persuade Hitler.

Italy took the initiative and proposed to achieve common agreement in Rome as a basis for arbitration. Ciano, who had been briefed by Hungarian experts, was in a better position than the less-informed Ribbentrop and so achieved several important concessions. On October 31, the Hungarian envoy in Rome confidentially informed Hungarian government, &quot;Ribbentrop definitely agreed with the return of Košice, Uzhorod and Mukachevo&quot;.

On October 29, 1938, Czechoslovakia and Hungary officially asked Germany and Italy to arbitrate and declared in advance that they would abide by the results.

== Arbitration ==

The award was made in Vienna by the foreign ministers of Germany, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and of Italy, Galeazzo Ciano. The Hungarian delegation was led by Foreign Minister Kálmán Kánya, accompanied by Education Minister Pál Teleki. The Czechoslovak delegation was led by Foreign Minister František Chvalkovský, accompanied by Ivan Krno. Important members of the Czechoslovak delegation included representatives of Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; (Prime Minister Avgustyn Voloshyn) and of Slovakia (Prime Minister Jozef Tiso and Justice Minister Ferdinand Ďurčanský). Also present was Hermann Göring. A few days before the arbitration, Budapest had received messages from some borderline villages that rejected becoming part of Hungary (&quot;Stay there, do not liberate us. We are having a good time, better than you, liberate yourself&quot;).

The arbitration began in the Belvedere Palace, in Vienna, at noon on November 2, 1938. The Czechoslovak and the Hungarian delegations were allowed to present their arguments. Chvalkovský was brief and left the task of presenting the Czechoslovak case to Krno. Despite explicit demands by the Czechoslovak representatives, both arbiters refused to let Tiso and Voloshyn participate. Ribbentrop and Ciano reasoned that only the representatives of central governments could participate (Czechoslovakia, rather than the partially-autonomous Slovakia or Carpatho-Ruthenia). They assumed that Chvalkovský would be more submissive and that Tiso would complicate the negotiations. The negotiations were a formality, and a new border was drawn after half a day. When the award was announced by Ribbentrop around 7 p.m., the Czechoslovak delegation was so shocked that Tiso actually had to be talked by Ribbentrop and Chvalkovský into signing the document.

== Results ==
Czechoslovakia had to surrender the territories in southern Slovakia and southern Carpathian Ruthenia south of the line to the border with Romania. That included the towns of Senec (Szenc), Galanta (Galánta), Vráble (Verebély), Levice (Léva), Lučenec (Losonc), Rimavská Sobota (Rimaszombat), Jelšava (Jolsva), Rožnava (Rozsnyó), Košice (Kassa), Michaľany (Szentmihályfalva), Veľké Kapušany (Nagykapos), Uzhhorod (Ungvár), and Mukachevo (Munkács). Slovakia lost 10,390 km2 with 854,277 inhabitants – 503,980 Hungarians (58,99%), 272,145 Slovaks or Czechs (32,43%), 26,151 Jews (3,06%), 8,947 Germans (1,05%), 1,825 Ruthenians, 14,617 other and 26,005 foreign citizens according to the Czechoslovak census of 1930. By considering the average population growth since the last census, it is possible to estimate the total size of population at the time of the arbitration at 935,000 people, 300,000 of whom were Slovaks or Czechs. Czechoslovakia lost also additional territory in Carpathian Ruthenia. Czechoslovakia lost the direct railway connection to Carpathian Ruthenia and to its ally Romania.

Between October 28 and 29, 1938, Béla Imrédy and the leader of the United Hungarian Party Andor Jaross made an agreement that representatives of the party who stayed in the redeemed territories would be part of a civic group of general staff, which would hold supreme authority. One of its parts (the Upper Country Unification Group) later became the basis for the Ministry for Upper Country, led by Jaross. All other political parties were banned, and obstacles were made for the introduction of other parties from Hungary. The United Hungarian Party then used its power for the persecution of Slovaks and of Hungarians who had disagreed with the activities against Czechoslovakia before the award.

After the Vienna Award, the Hungarian government and United Hungarian Party organised celebrations and a triumphant entry of the Hungarian Army into the redeemed territories. Organizers consciously imitated the entry of Hitler&#x27;s army into the Sudetenland. The result of arbitration was met by most of the Hungarian population by local statements of disagreement. Hungarian Honvéds were not welcomed also in some &quot;pure Hungarian&quot; villages, and in one village, their accommodation had to be arranged by force. The ceded territories were occupied by the Royal Hungarian Army (&quot;Magyar Királyi Honvédség&quot;) between November 5 and 10, 1938. Hungary imposed a military administration on the redeemed territories. On November 11, Horthy solemnly entered the main town, Košice (Kassa). The military administration was changed to a civilian administration on December 21, 1938. The recovered Upper Hungary territories were incorporated into Hungary on November 12, 1938, by an act of the Hungarian Parliament. By following the former counties of the Kingdom of Hungary, the occupied territory was divided into two new counties with seats in Nové Zámky and Levice, and some lands became part of other Hungarian counties.

On 30 November 1938 Czechoslovakia ceded to Poland small patches of land in Spiš and Orava regions.

== Impacts ==
=== Slovak–Hungarian relations ===
Tiso took the result personally, especially because he had failed to arrange the evacuation of Košice. He announced the results of the award on the radio late in the evening and blamed the central government for its long-term policy but accepted the result.

The First Vienna Award finally refuted interwar Hungarian propaganda that &quot;Slovak brothers&quot; dreamed about returning to the 1000-year Hungarian Empire and could not openly declare their opinion under Czech domination. It also led to worsening anti-Hungarian sentiment in Slovakia. Shortly after the award had been announced, János Esterházy, a leader of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, proposed for Hungary to return to Slovakia 1000 km2 of the territory that Hungary had received, predominantly Slovak lands between Šurany (Nagysurány) and Palárikovo (Tótmegyer), to ensure the long-term peaceful co-existence between both nations. His proposal was not accepted by the Hungarian government. The obvious violation of the ethnic balance between the two countries&#x27; minorities, which had repeatedly been endorsed years earlier by Hungary, and the short period between the award and a Hungarian attack against Slovakia in March 1939, caused anti-Hungarian sentiment and social movements to become a significant unifying element for Slovaks during the Second World War. Anti-Hungarian demonstrations were held on each anniversary of the award in which anti-Hungarian slogans were shouted and Hungarian houses or cultural institutions were damaged. On the third anniversary, a mob furious at the shooting of Slovaks by Hungarian police in Komjatice destroyed the Hungarian Cultural House.

=== Radicalisation of Central Europe ===
Hungary annulled Point 4 of Article 27 of the Treaty of Trianon, which committed it to respect the new borders that were defined by the treaty. According to Deák, Hungary also violated Articles 48 and 49 of the treaty, which guaranteed independence and rights of new Czechoslovak state. In addition to territorial gains based on the First Vienna Award, Hungary ignored the results of the arbitration and tried to annex Carpathian Ruthenia few weeks later.

From the Middle Ages to well into the 18th century, Hungary and Poland had shared a historic common border and had always enjoyed good relations. After the Munich Agreement on September 30, 1938, both countries had worked together to restore their historic common border. A step toward their goal was realised with the First Vienna Award (November 2, 1938).

Under pressure from Hitler, Slovakia declared total independence on March 14, 1939, and Czechoslovakia ceased to exist. Two days earlier, Hitler had given Hungary permission to occupy the rest of Carpatho-Ruthenia within 24 hours but to abstain from attempting to annex the remainder of Slovakia, which Hitler wanted to turn into a strategically located German ally, especially for his planned invasion of Poland. On March 14–15, what remained of Carpatho-Ruthenia declared its independence as Carpatho-Ukraine, and shortly afterward, between March 15 and 18, it was occupied by Hungary. After occupying Carpatho-Ukraine, Hungary occupied a small amount of Slovakia on March 15. Seeing no substantial reaction, Hungary on March 23 launched a larger attack on eastern Slovakia. The plan was to &quot;advance as far west as possible&quot;. After a short Slovak-Hungarian War, with several Hungarian air raids, such as March 24 on Spišská Nová Ves, Hungary was forced by Germany to stop and negotiate. The negotiations (March 27 -April 4) gave Hungary further territories in Eastern Slovakia (1,897 km2) with 69,630 inhabitants, almost all of whom were Slovaks or Rusyns. Unlike the earlier Vienna Award, the annexed territories were not justified on ethnic grounds. (The Hungarians justified it under the grounds that the Vienna Award had been an arbitration between Hungary and Czechoslovakia and that the latter had ceased to exist a few days earlier.)

Until mid-March 1939, Germany had considered that &quot;for military reasons a common Hungarian-Polish frontier was undesirable&quot;. Indeed, Hitler had warned Hungary not to touch the remainder of Slovakia when he authorized Hungary to occupy the rest of Carpathian Ruthenia in March 1939. He meant to use Slovakia as a staging ground for his planned invasion of Poland. In March 1939, Hitler changed his mind on the common Hungarian-Polish frontier and decided to betray Germany&#x27;s ally, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which had already in 1938 begun organising Ukrainian military units in a &quot;sich&quot; outside Uzhhorod under German tutelage. Polish political and military authorities saw the &quot;sich&quot; as a danger to the neighbouring southeastern Poland, with its largely Ukrainian population. Hitler, however, was concerned that if a Ukrainian army that was organised in Carpathian Rus&#x27; accompanied German forces invading the Soviet Union, Ukrainian nationalists would insist on the establishment of an independent Ukraine. Hitler, who had his own plans for the natural and farming resources of Ukraine, did not want to have to deal with an independent Ukrainian government.

Hitler soon had cause to regret his decision regarding the fate of Carpatho-Ukraine. In six months, during his 1939 invasion of Poland, the common Hungarian-Polish border would become of major importance when Horthy&#x27;s government, because of the long friendship between Poles and Hungarians and as a matter of Hungarian honour, declined Hitler&#x27;s request to transit German forces across Carpathian Rus&#x27; into southeastern Poland to speed Poland&#x27;s conquest. That, in turn, allowed the Polish government and tens of thousands of Polish military personnel to escape into neighbouring Hungary and Romania and then to France and French-mandated Syria to carry on operations as the third-strongest Allied belligerent, after Britain and France. Also, for a time, Polish and British intelligence agents and couriers, including the notable Krystyna Skarbek, used Hungary&#x27;s Carpathian Rus&#x27; as a route across the Carpathian Mountains to and from Poland.

=== Life in redeemed territory ===
==== Demographics ====
Slovaks in the redeemed territory joined the existing Slovak minority in Hungary, but only about 60,000 Hungarians remained in the Slovakia. The new border did not respect the principle of ethnic borders requested by Hungary as a &quot;correction of injustices of Treaty of Trianon&quot; or the Hungarian census of 1910. The most obvious violations of the ethnic principle occurred in areas around Nové Zámky–Vráble–Hurbanovo, the area around Jelšava and the area around Košice. Only 8 of 79 villages around Košice had a Hungarian-majority population, besides the 42,245 Slovaks in Košice.

Hungary performed a new census in the redeemed territory in December 1938. The census took place in an atmosphere of expulsions, persecutions, restrictions of civil rights and psychological coercion by the Hungarian authorities. In addition, it was performed under direct control of military bodies and violated several principles for taking a census of nationalities. According to the official results, the population consisted of 86.5% Hungarians and 9.8% Slovaks. The total size of Slovak population was reduced to 121,603, with 67 villages losing their Slovak majority, the Slovak population decreasing by 74,100 and the Hungarian population increased by 77,715. Contrary to the Czechoslovak census of 1930, the Hungarian census again counted not the nationality declared by citizens but the &quot;mother tongue&quot; registered by census commissars, as had the Hungarian census from 1910. The two censuses significantly differed in the view on Jewish population. In Czechoslovakia, Jews were allowed to declare separate Jewish nationality, but in the Hungarian census, they could not put their own mother tongue, and their real numbers can be estimated only by their declared religion.

For a full comparison of the censuses, it is necessary to take into account the population transfer after the border change (voluntary or forced), the demographic changes during the previous 20 years of Czechoslovakia (such as the arrival of Czechoslovak state employees and colonists and natural domestic migration) and the bilingualism of the population and the reliability of previous statistics, particularly of the 1910 census from the peak of Magyarization.

==== First deportations of Jews ====

The Vienna Award escalated in Slovakia into the first deportations of Jews. Tiso and his collaborators looked for a scapegoat, which was found in Jews because of their demonstration in favour of Bratislava to be part of Hungary on the evening before the arbitration. Between November 4 and 5, 1938, Slovakia&#x27;s autonomous government deported 7,500 Jews into the new Hungarian-Slovak border. Tiso justified the step as &quot;letting them go where they wanted&quot;. Hungary refused to accept them, who included some who were elderly or children, and the deported Jews found themselves imprisoned in no man&#x27;s land during the cold autumn weather. Hundreds of Jews stayed in a camp in Veľký Kýr and Miloslavov, where they were unable to move to residences in either Slovakia or Hungary.

==== Persecutions against other non-Hungarians ====
The non-Hungarians in the territory ceded by the First Vienna Award can be divided into three groups: those who left already before the Award came into force, those who remained in their place during the war until it was reintegrated to Czechoslovakia and those who were expelled from the region. The Czechoslovak press reported after the Munich Agreement that border adjustments with Hungary were imminent and so the Czechoslovaks had five weeks to decide whether they stayed or left. According to Janics, the officials and farmers who opted to move out (81,000 people) were given administrative, military and public safety support and were provided road vehicles and railway wagons to transport their property. Deák estimates the number of state employees and Czech colonists who left the territory before the arrival of the Hungarian Army as half, and the total number of Slovaks who left the territory before December 1938 (voluntarily or forcibly) is unknown and can be estimated only by comparison of the censuses of 1930 and 1938 and the assumed population growth. His estimate has about 50,000 Slovaks.

From the start, Hungary breached several points of the agreement on the evacuation and the transfer of territory, particularly its commitment to preventing violence on territory under its administration. Hungarian nationalism considered the Czech and Slovak colonists, who had obtained their lands in the ethnic Hungarian territories by the nationalist Czechoslovak land reform, as aliens. Some of the colonists left before the award, and others stayed where they were, but a number of them were expelled by force and intimidation. Tilkovszky puts the number of expelled families at 647.

Deák documents that the expulsion of &quot;colonists&quot; was not realised as an arbitrary act of nationalists but that the Hungarian General Staff gave an order to expel all Slovak and Czech colonists on November 5, 1938, which also included their family members and descendants. On November 11, 1938, the Hungarian General Staff issued a new edict, which imposed measures against colonists, ordered their immediate expulsion and defined them as enemies of the state. The organised persecution of non-Hungarian population was based on those orders. Soldiers and police could freely perform home inspections without needing official authorisation and could confiscate stocks of food, livestock and grain. The term &quot;colonists&quot; covered agricultural colonists but was interpreted by the Hungarian government as any non-Hungarians that had settled in the concerning territories since 1918 for any reason, even for those who declared to have Hungarian nationality. Beside Slovaks, Moravians and Czechs, the forced expulsions affected Germans. Forced expulsions were frequently preceded by arrest and imprisonment related to physical torture. In others, it involved transportation to border with Czechoslovakia with military assistance.

The colonists were followed by state employees, Slovak farmers (including those who inherited land or bought it in a standard legal way with their own money) and then anybody denoted as an unreliable. Lists of unreliable persons had been prepared by members of the Hungarian United Party before the First Vienna Award. The measures took place violently, with shooting, casualties and the looting of Slovak and Czech stores and property. Military bodies usually did not react to complaints, or they openly declared that they would not do anything against offenders and violence.

Under such conditions, many Slovaks and Czechs decided to leave the territory. In addition, they signed official statement that they had moved voluntarily and all of their property, even for items that were allowed to be exported, was passed into the ownership of Hungary. In Gbelce (Köbölkút), three Czech colonists were shot dead and one hanged. Civil servants had to leave the territory within 48 hours and were replaced by those from Hungary.

As a reaction to the expulsion of colonists, Czechoslovakia started to take countermeasures and declared that further expelled civilians would be settled on land belonging to members of the Hungarian minority and Hungarian citizens (the Hungarian aristocracy owned 50,000 ha of agricultural land and 14,000 ha of woods in Slovakia). Hungary promised that it would stop mass expulsions and that it was open to negotiations on property issues.

Changes in the Hungarian policy were driven by several factors. The new Hungarian foreign minister, István Csáky, stated that the Hungarian steps had not had the expected effects but had increased anti-Hungarian sentiment, caused disillusionment of the last supporters of Hungary and pushed the Slovak government into co-operation with the central Czechoslovak government. The Hungarian government continued the expulsions but claimed that they were not mass expulsions, that Slovaks and Czechs had left the territory voluntarily and that Hungary had not forced them to do so.

Although Miklós Horthy had promised to guarantee the freedom of the Slovak language and culture in the redeemed territories, Hungary failed to protect its new minorities. The promise of the Slovak government of &quot;adequate help and protection&quot; of its non-Hungarian citizens and its recommendation to stay in the territory the live were also naive and counterproductive and led to unnecessary losses of lives and property.

All non-Hungarian organizations were dissolved, and their property was confiscated or given to Hungarian organisations. In Nové Zámky (Érsekújvár), Jewish citizens were interned in a colony abandoned by Slovaks and Czechs shortly after the event, Jewish lease agreements were cancelled and office spaces were given to Christians.

About 150 schools had been built by the Slovak League, and they were declared to be the property of the Hungarian state. According to Jablonický, Deák and other authors, 862 of 1,119 teachers lost their jobs by the end of 1938, and others followed in the next years. Janics put the total number of teachers at 1,088 and added that most of them had left voluntarily when the award came into effect. In early 1939, the Slovak government protested the expulsion of Slovak teachers and the liquidation of Slovak schools and threatened reciprocal measures against Hungarian-minority schools if Hungary&#x27;s policy continued.

The expulsion of teachers was often related to violence and public degradation. In Lučenec (Losonc), Hungary deported 54 Slovak teachers on the demarcation line (Deák documents further examples of steps that eliminated Slovak schools). Slovaks lost 386 primary schools, attended by 45,709 Slovak children, and 29 council schools (&quot;burgher schools&quot;), attended by 10,750 children. Four grammar school were closed in Košice (Kassa) and six in other towns. The remaining Slovak government employees, such as railway workers, were forced to enroll their children into Hungarian schools. In several Slovak villages, police dispersed parents&#x27; associations, and parents who demanded Slovak schools were beaten. Parents from Ruskov (Regeteruszka) and Blažice (Balogd) who demanded Slovak schools were imprisoned for two weeks. In several places, Hungarian police burned Slovak school supplies, requested for them to be burned by the school director or simply confiscated them.

However, that pressure was generally not sufficient. For instance, in Šurany (Nagysurány), Slovaks excluded from their community anybody who had enrolled children to Hungarian schools. The overcrowding of Hungarian classes with Slovaks had a negative impact on the quality of education of local Hungarian population.

The slow adoption of Hungarian confirmed that the idea of the Hungarian state had remained fictitious for Slovaks.
In the fall of 1943, the Hungarian government came to the conclusion that direct Magyarization trends would be replaced by educational activities in the mother tongue of minorities. The plan did not take place because of Hungary was later occupied by Germany.

==== Social rights and economy ====
The Hungarian government ordered the revision of trade licences for Jews in the redeemed territory but not for the rest of Hungary. That made 80% of Jews lose their license with significant impact on economic life. In towns like Košice (Kassa), Nové Zámky (Érsekújvár) and Lučenec (Losonc), every second shop was closed.

Slovakia lost 41% of its agricultural soil, which produced approximately 80% of products required for food supply. That was a notable loss for Slovakia but was not a clear benefit for Hungary. The existing problems with overproduction caused problems for local farmers and for Hungary&#x27;s economic policy. Only half of Southern Slovakia&#x27;s 400,000 tons of wheat production was used locally, and the other half had no consumers. The border between the redeemed territories and Hungary proper was closed during the military administration and so distribution in that direction was impossible. The situation improved only partially during the civilian administration, when grain and livestock prices remained low. The Hungarian government tried to improve the situation by state intervention purchases, but that failed to resolve the long-term implications of the overproduction. The prices of agricultural goods decreased by 20–30%. Existing cartels in Hungary had limited possibilities to grow the most profitable crops. That resulted in The Economic Association of Nitra County demanding the right &quot;to grow sugar beet under the same conditions as during Czech rule&quot;. That request was refused. On February 24, 1939, the government cabinet restricted growing of red pepper only to limited areas around Nové Zámky (Érsekújvár).

Czechoslovakia had provided more job opportunities by constructing roads, regulating rivers and building projects. Those were stopped after the arbitration. Unemployment rates increased, and unlike Czechoslovakia, Hungary did not provide any unemployment benefits or state health insurance for workers in agriculture. Retirement and disability pensions were also lower. Unemployed workers who had received support under Czechoslovak rule requested the same from Hungary. Salaries and working conditions had worsened, but taxes had increased. The exchange rate was disadvantageous for local citizens (7-1) and automatically decreased salaries by 20%. Hungarian soldiers profited from the exchange rate and bought up the remaining cheap Czechoslovak goods at the expense of their sellers. New goods from Hungary had become 20–30% more expensive. Electricity, the radio and railway tickets had also become also more expensive.

Local Hungarians had difficulties understanding the problems because interwar propaganda had portrayed the reunification of the ethnic Hungarian territories as beneficial for both parties. However, in many aspects, Czechoslovakia had given Hungarians more civic and social rights than Hungary would just a year later. The Hungarian government answered by appealing to Hungarian patriotism. In April 1939, Hungarian professors wrote demands to the Hungarian government and protested price increases and their bad social situation.

Social problems on the concerning territories were discussed in the cabinet meeting on December 22, 1939. Interior Minister Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer who was responsible for issues of common goods, the health service and social policy, proposed a solution based on unification. Upper Country Minister Andor Jaross disagreed with that solution and proposed providing the Czechoslovak welfare system for those in the redeemed areas for a transitional period but had no objections to decreasing it to the Hungarian level.

The cabinet finally agreed on a compromise. The elimination of Czechoslovak laws from the acquired territories was understood as a duty but had to be done gradually. The first step was to decrease the value of a retirement pension from its Czechoslovak value (150 pengő) to its Hungarian value (60 pengő) through a transition value of 120 pengő. Health insurance for workers in agriculture was preserved in the form of Czechoslovak regulation for the moment, but it was changed from compulsory to voluntary. In Slovakia, the Czechoslovak system of welfare was preserved after the breakup of Czechoslovakia.

== Nullification ==
In terms of international law, the Vienna Award was later ruled to be null and void. Although it was presented as a voluntary act of two sovereign states in arbitration, the Czechoslovak government had accepted arbitration under a presumed threat from both arbiters (Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy) and under heavy influence of the Hungarian demands. According to Deák, under international law, the act is considered to have been illegal, and its result could not be accepted as valid. Just as for the Munich Agreement, which was later nullified, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s interests were largely ignored, and the arbiters had used their military prowess to pressure those in the agreement. The Vienna Award was also found to be illegal at the end of World War II. From that legal standpoint, the Vienna Award never existed as a valid legal act.

On December 11, 1940, the British Foreign Office confirmed to the Czechoslovak government that Britain was not bound to Munich Agreement regarding Czechoslovak borders. It interpreted the Munich Agreement to have been signed properly but to have become invalid on March 15, 1939. Negotiations on the British standpoint continued until halfway into 1942. On June 9, 1942, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov confirmed the restoration of Czechoslovakia to its borders before the Munich Agreement. On September 26, 1944, Italian Foreign Minister Carlo Sforza informed a Czechoslovak representative that Italy had considered the Munich Agreement and the First Vienna Award to have been invalid from the start. That was confirmed in the peace treaty with Hungary (Treaty of Paris), which was signed February 10, 1947. Article 1 (4a) stated, &quot;The decisions of the Vienna Award of November 2, 1938, are declared null and void&quot;. The treaty went on to declare that the border between Hungary and Czechoslovakia was to be fixed along the former frontier between Hungary and Czechoslovakia as it existed on January 1, 1938, except for three villages south of Bratislava, which were given as a bridgehead to Czechoslovakia.

== Postwar persecutions ==

The Munich Agreement, the First Vienna Award and the participation of minority parties in the breakup of Czechoslovakia resulted in the redefinition of postwar Czechoslovak minority policy. Prewar Czechoslovakia had guaranteed a relatively large number of minority rights, with Hungarians having more civic and social rights than in Hungary, but Hungarians became the target of serious discrimination after the war. The Hungarian question had to be resolved by a population exchange between Czechoslovakia and Hungary, Slovakization, and deportations of Hungarians in Czechoslovakia (particularly to the Sudetenland).

The Government Program of Košice (April 5, 1945) accepted the principle of collective guilt for the German and Hungarian minorities. Articles X and XI ordered the seizure of their property, and Article XV the closure of minority schools. Measures against the minorities were reasoned by the &quot;terrible experience of Czechs and Slovaks with German and Hungarian minorities, which largely become a willing tool in the services of aggressive policy from outside; and especially Czechoslovak Germans cooperated directly in the extermination campaign against the Czech and Slovak nation&quot;. The government program was followed by series of regulations in the same spirit. Except for antifascist fighters, the Hungarians lost their Czechoslovak citizenship by a presidential decree on August 2, 1945. &quot;About amnesty for acts performed during anti-fascistic fight&quot; prevented punishment of the cruelest crimes against the Hungarian minority. The two countries had a population exchange (68,407 Hungarians and 59,774 Slovaks). A further 31,780 Hungarians were expelled because they had settled in the territories only after the Vienna Award.

The communist coup in Czechoslovakia in February 1948 did not immediately improve the status of Hungarians, but relationships began to normalise in the second half of 1948. During his visit to Budapest on March 15, 1948, the chairman of the Czechoslovak Constitutional National Assembly declared that the Hungarian people were not responsible for the past oppression of Slovaks, the crimes of Hungarian noblemen or the regime of Miklós Horthy. In October 1948, the Czechoslovak parliament restored Czechoslovak citizenship to Hungarians who were residents in Slovakia on November 1, 1938, and had not been convicted of crimes. The issue of the return of property disappeared in the context of communist collectivisation and so became irrelevant.

On April 16, 1949, the two countries signed an agreement on friendship and co-operation. On July 25, 1949, the Hungarian government committed to return artistic and historical relics that had been seized after the First Vienna Award. The final agreement was signed on November 11, 1951, with a validity of ten years but was not fully respected.

<text>Olof Trätälja (Old Norse: &quot;Óláfr trételgja&quot;, Swedish: &quot;Olof Trätälja&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;Olav Tretelgja&quot;, all meaning &quot;Olaf Woodwhittler&quot;) was the son of the Swedish king Ingjald illråde, ruler of the House of Yngling in the 7th century according to &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, a Skaldic poem detailing the kings of that house.

==Heimskringla==
His mother was Gauthild, a princess of West Götaland, whose maternal grandfather was Olof the Sharp-sighted, the king of Nerike.

His mother sent him to his foster-father Bove in West Götaland, where he grew up with his foster-brother Saxe who was surnamed Flette.

When Olof heard of his father&#x27;s death, he assembled the men who were willing to follow him and went to his kinsmen in Nerike, because after his father&#x27;s atrocities, the Swedes had grown hostile towards the Ynglings.

When the Swedes learnt that Olof and his kin had sought refuge in Nerike, they were attacked and had to head west through deep and mountainous forests (Kilsbergen) to Lake Vänern and the estuary of Klarälven (where Karlstad is now situated). Here, they settled and cleared land. Soon they had created a whole province called Värmland, where they could make a good living.

When the Swedes learnt that Olof was clearing land, they were amused and called him the Tree-feller. Olof married a woman named Solveig who was a daughter of Halfdan Guldtand of Soleyar. Olof and Solveig had two sons, Ingjald Olofsson and Halfdan Hvitbeinn, who were brought up in Soleyar in the house of his mother&#x27;s uncle Sölve.

Because of king Ivar Vidfamne and his harsh rule many Swedes emigrated to Värmland, and they became so numerous that the province could not sustain them. The land was afflicted by famine of which the Swedes accused the king. It was an old tradition in Sweden of holding the king responsible for the wealth of the land (see Domalde). The Swedes accused Olof of neglecting his sacrifices to the gods and believed that this was the cause of the famine.

The Swedish settlers thus rebelled against Olof, surrounded his house on the shores of lake Vänern and burnt him inside it. Thus he was sacrificed to Odin, like his ancestor Domalde.

==Ynglingatal and Historia Norwegiae==
However, &quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot; says that Olof succeeded his father and ruled as the king of Sweden in peace until his death.
The lines of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; appear to say that he was a Swedish prince (&quot;svía jöfri&quot;), and that he was burnt inside his hall and disappeared from Gamla Uppsala.

==Archaeology==
:&quot;Source&quot;
Along the lower parts of the river Byälven in Värmland, there are three large barrows, which legend attribute to Olof Trätälja. Moreover, there are many hillforts near this river and the northern shore of Lake Vänern testifying to a violent period. Archaeological excavations from one of the hillforts, Villkorsberget, show that it was burnt in a period corresponding to Olof (510–680).

==Notes==

King Olof Tratalja is of House Ynglinga which are descendants to House Munso from the 10th and 11th centuries. The previous editor from Gustav Storm of 1880 had shown King Olof Tratalja being from 1820s-1880s before vanishing when his house caught fire from attackers and fled for safety with his family. And a new ruler took over immediately after political corruption being a French General commissioned by Napoleon.</text><links>

<text>Josef Jireček (9 October 1825, in Vysoké Mýto – 25 November 1888, in Prague) was a Czech scholar. He was born in Vysoké Mýto (then part of the Austrian Empire).
He entered the Prague Bureau of Education in 1850 and became department minister in the Hohenwart cabinet in 1871. His efforts to secure equal educational privileges for the Slav nationalities in the Austrian dominions brought him into disfavour with the German element. He became a member of the Bohemian Landtag in 1878 and of the Austrian Reichsrat in 1879. His merits as a scholar were recognized in 1875 by his election as president of the Royal Czech Society of Sciences. He died in Prague on 25 November 1888.

In 1862, he and his brother Hermenegild Jireček strove to defend the genuineness of the Königinhof Manuscript discovered by Václav Hanka. He published in Czech an anthology of Czech literature (3 volumes, 1858–1861), a biographical dictionary of Czech writers (2 volumes, 1875–1876), a Czech hymnology, editions of Jan Blahoslav&#x27;s &quot;Czech grammar&quot; and some Czech classics, and of the works of his father-in-law Pavel Josef Safarik (1795–1861).

His son was the Slavic specialist Konstantin Josef Jireček, and his brother was the historian Hermenegild Jireček.

<doc id="901971" wikidata="Q7349365" url="?curid=901971" title="Robert Rollock">
<text>Robert Rollock (c. 15558 or 9 February 1599) was a Scottish theologian and minister in the Church of Scotland, and the first regent and first principal of the University of Edinburgh. Born into a noble family, he distinguished himself during his education at the University of St Andrews, which led to him being appointed regent of the newly created college in Edinburgh in 1583, and its first principal in 1586. 

After the college had grown and other regents had been appointed, Rollock no longer had to perform everyday teaching, and he became the university&#x27;s first Professor of Theology. In parallel to his academic duties, he acted as a minister and served in various church functions until his death in 1599. Rollock was acknowledged by his contemporaries as a prolific academic and Biblical scholar, and effective principal.

==Life==

=== Early life and education ===
Rollock was born in 1555, the son of David Rollock, laird of Powis, near Stirling, and his wife Mariota Livingston. He was one of at least six children, Hercules Rollock being his older brother. He received his early education at the school of Stirling from Thomas Buchanan, a nephew of George Buchanan. Rollock then entered St Salvator&#x27;s College at the University of St Andrews in 1574, obtaining his BA in 1576 and his MA likely in 1577. After graduating, he combined teaching at St Salvator&#x27;s College with further studies in theology, Hebrew, and Biblical philology at St Mary&#x27;s College (also in St Andrews) under the tutelage of James Melville. Over the next years, Rollock acquired a national reputation both as a teacher and due to the piety he reportedly instilled in his students. In 1580, he was first made examiner of arts, then director of the faculty of arts, and finally a regent of the University of St Andrews.

=== University of Edinburgh ===

In April 1582, King James VI had granted a royal charter to Edinburgh Town Council for the establishment of a college. First known as &quot;Tounis College&quot; (Town&#x27;s College)&quot;,&quot; instruction was to begin in October 1583, but the Town Council was still searching for a regent in September of the same year. James Lawson, John Knox&#x27; successor as minister at St Giles&#x27; Kirk in Edinburgh, recommended Rollock for the position, and the town sent a delegation to St Andrews to offer the position to him. Rollock agreed and was named the sole regent on 14 September, only one month before the first charge of 80 to 90 students began their education. His appointment was guaranteed for one year; should the college be successful, it was agreed that he should be advanced to the highest post or title that might be created. Rollock&#x27;s salary was fixed at 40 pound Scots, and the council also agreed to &quot;sustain him and one servant in their ordinary expenses&quot;. The tuition fees for the sons of burgesses were set at 40 Shillings, and other students paid three pounds or more; Rollock would be given an augmentation not exceeding 40 merks should the fees not afford him a sufficient salary.

When the university opened, Rollock was the sole instructor for the first-year students; as regent, he was expected to tutor the 1583 intake for the entirety of the four years of their MA degree, and teach all subjects himself. Rollock had drawn up the curriculum and was joined in November by a second master, Duncan Nairn of Glasgow, to do some preparatory teaching. The first year focused on Latin and Greek grammar; the second year featured authors from classical antiquity and arithmetic; year three added Hebrew, ethics, logic, and physics; and the fourth year exposed students to more logic, physics, geography and theology. Rollock&#x27;s curriculum was deeply influenced by humanist ideals which had also taken root at the universities of Glasgow and St Andrews, but a pioneering course on human anatomy was an innovation. 

From May 1585 to February 1586, Rollock was forced to close the college due to an outbreak of plague. In 1586, the Town Council agreed to make Rollock the university&#x27;s first principal, which meant that after his first class graduated in 1587, he no longer had to perform everyday teaching. The young university grew quickly, which necessitated the appointment of additional regents for subsequent student intakes. In November 1587, the Town Council and local presbytery agreed that Rollock could focus on teaching theology and preach on Sundays, and he was consequently appointed as Professor of Theology with a salary of 400 merks. Rollock instructed students in divinity if they wanted to become ministers after graduating, and saw himself both as an educator and as a spiritual guide to his students. Following his example, the posts of Principal and Professor of Theology remained linked until 1620.

=== Later years and church roles ===
Rollock had begun to preach informally at St Giles every Sunday morning as early as September 1587, although he was not ordained as a minister. Another minister took over these duties in December 1589. Rollock played a prominent role in the Church of Scotland and its somewhat troubled church politics, and was appointed on several occasions to committees of presbytery and assemblies on pressing ecclesiastical business. 

In 1590, Rollock was appointed assessor to the moderator of the general assembly, and in 1591 was named to a committee of the presbytery of Edinburgh with negotiated with the king on the affairs of the kirk. In connection with the prosecution of the Earls of Angus, Huntly, and Errol for their attempts &#x27;against the true religion&#x27;, he was chosen to confer with a committee of the estates. In 1595, he was nominated to a commission for the visitation of Scotland&#x27;s colleges. In the following year, he was appointed with three other ministers to remonstrate with King James VI for his &#x27;hard dealing with the kirk&#x27;, and especially for his prosecution of David Black. 

According to his contemporary David Calderwood, Rollock was &quot;a godly man, but simple in the matters of the church government, credulous, easily led by counsel&quot;. This supposed disposition led to him being won over to support the policy of the king in church matters, although Calderwood adds that Rollock understood &quot;his own weakness in following the humours of the king and his commissioners&quot;. Rollock supported a proposal made in 1595 that certain ministers should be allowed to sit and vote in parliament as bishops, affirming that &quot;lordship could not be denied them that were to sit in parliament, and allowance of rent to maintain their dignities&quot;. Church historian John Row points out that Rollock had previously condemned the office of bishops in his 1590 commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians. Rollock declared shortly before his death that his principal goal had been that church and state &quot;should mutually assist each other, [...] and that no unnecessary war should be kindled&quot;. 

In 1596, Rollock accepted one of the eight ministerial charges of the city of Edinburgh, and took charge of his congregation. His sympathy for the king&#x27;s policies led to the royal party successfully lobbying for Rollock being chosen as moderator of the General Assembly held at Dundee in May 1597. In 1598 he became minister of the Upper Tolbooth—probably the west portion of St. Giles&#x27;s Kirk—and on 18 April of the same year he was admitted to Magdalen Church, afterwards known as Greyfriars Kirk. 

=== Death and legacy ===
Rollock had repeatedly been in poor health throughout his life, and he was perhaps overworked; he died in Edinburgh on 8 February 1599, aged only 44. On his deathbed, Rollock stated that he wanted the university to remain chiefly a place of spiritual instruction, and that he was strongly opposed to the introduction of professors of law and medicine. He also requested that his former student Henry Charteris would be made his successor, a wish which was granted by the Town Council. 

David Calderwood, in his 1646 &quot;Historie of the Kirk of Scotland&quot;, criticises Rollock&#x27;s perceived weakness towards the king, but admits that he was &quot;a man of good conversation and a powerful preacher&quot;. Rollock was considered a scholar of &#x27;great learning&#x27;, who also effectively discharged the duties of professor and principal of the university in its early days. 

Rollock was the author of numerous theological works, the majority of them being commentaries or expositions of scripture. He was internationally recognised for his Bible commentaries, and over 40 of his works were printed in Edinburgh, Geneva, Heidelberg and Herborn. His writings on the Epistle to the Ephesians and the Epistle to the Romans won particular praise, with Geneva theologian Theodore Beza stating he had &quot;never read in this kind of interpretation any thing exceeding them in elegance and sound judgement united with brevity&quot;. In two works published in 1596/97, Rollock may be one of the first exponents of covenant theology in Britain.

Rollock married Helen Barroun, daughter of James Barroun of Kinnaird, around 1587. The couple had a posthumous daughter, Jean, who married Robert Balcanquhal, minister of Tranent.

The university commemorates Rollock with a plaque on the south side of Old College, at the entrance to the main university reception.

<text>James Louis Chapman (born March 8, 1945) is an American business and political leader. From 1985 to 1997, he served as Democratic Congressman representing the Texas&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. His home town was Sulphur Springs.

==Early life==
Chapman was born in Washington, D.C. He attended public schools in Sulphur Springs; he received an undergraduate degree in business administration from the University of Texas at Austin (1968) and a J.D. degree from the Southern Methodist University School of Law in Dallas, Texas (1970).

After a stint in private practice, Chapman became the District Attorney for the Eighth Judicial District of Texas from 1976 to 1985, during which he achieved a 99 percent conviction record and a national reputation as a tough, law and order prosecutor. Chapman served in leadership roles with the Texas District and County Attorneys Association and the National District Attorneys Association. Later, he set up his own practice and was senior partner of the law firm of Chapman, Price, Hughes &amp; Bauer. He also became chairman of a local community bank.

==Congressional career==
Chapman was elected in 1985 as a Democrat in the 99th Congress during a highly visible special election to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of U.S. Representative Sam B. Hall. He defeated the Republican choice, Edd Hargett, a former professional football player, by just over 1,900 votes. However, he would never face another contest anywhere near that close, and was reelected to the five succeeding Congresses (August 3, 1985 – January 3, 1997). He was not a candidate for reelection to the One Hundred Fifth Congress in 1996, but was an unsuccessful candidate for nomination to the United States Senate in 1996.

While in Congress, Chapman served four years on the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, which sets committee assignments and the legislative agenda for the caucus. He also served as chairman of the Texas Democratic congressional delegation and as a member of the Democratic Whip organization.

Chapman served on the House Appropriations Committee, working on numerous projects including restoration and development of an Army Corps of Engineers-maintained East Texas lake called Cooper Lake, located between Cooper and Sulphur Springs. In honor of his work, Congress later enacted legislation formally renaming the lake as &quot;Jim Chapman Lake.&quot; Prior to his service on the Appropriations Committee, he served on the Public Works and Transportation Committee; Small Business Committee; and the Science, Space and Technology Committee. Chapman gained notoriety during the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal when it was revealed in the Starr Report that President Clinton was receiving fellatio from Monica Lewinsky while on the phone with Chapman on November 15, 1995 between 9:25pm and 9:30pm.

<text>Halfdan Whiteshanks (Old Norse: &quot;Hálfdan hvítbeinn&quot;) was a semi-historical petty king in Norway, described in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;. The following description is based on the account in Ynglinga saga, written in the 1220s by Snorri Sturluson.

He was the son of Olof Trätälja of the House of Yngling. His father was sacrificed to Odin by the Swedish settlers in Värmland because of a famine. Some Swedes, however, realised that the famine was brought by overpopulation and not by the fact that the king had been neglecting his religious duties.

Consequently, they resolved to cross the Ed Forest and settle in Norway and happened to end up in Soleyar, where they killed king Sölve and took Halfdan prisoner. The Swedish expatriates elected Halfdan king as he was the son of their old king, Olof. Halfdan subjugated all of Soleyar and took his army into Romerike and subjugated that province as well.

Halfdan was to become a great king, who married Åsa, the daughter of king Eystein, the ruler of Oppland and Hedmark. They had two sons, Eystein Halfdansson and Gudröd.

Halfdan conquered a large part of Hedemark, Toten, Hadeland and a part of Vestfold. When his brother Ingjald Olofsson died, he inherited Värmland. Halfdan died of old age in Toten and was transported to Vestfold, where he was buried under a mound in Skiringssal.

<text>The British Heavyweight Championship is a professional wrestling championship contested for in the XWA. The championship was originally created and contested for in the Frontier Wrestling Alliance (FWA) but moved to XWA when the former company became defunct. It has also been contested for in Ring of Honor (ROH) due to a working relationship between them and FWA.

==History==

The first Champion was Mark Sloan, who defeated Paul Glory in a tournament final on 11 July 1999. Jody Fleisch was the first person to win the belt twice after being stripped of it, while American wrestler Christopher Daniels was the first non-British person to win the belt and go on to defend it on foreign soil.

Originally the belt was mostly defended under two out of three falls match rules, as was the tradition in British wrestling. This changed on 12 April 2005, when champion Alex Shane signed a cast-iron contract to make new FWA British Title rules official and permanent making all future championship matches simply one fall.

On 13 May 2006 the FWA British Heavyweight Title belt was stolen from the Morecambe Dome immediately following the FWA event at the venue during an FWA versus All-Star Wrestling show. Due to being stolen a new belt had to be created. When the FWA was forced to retire in its interpromotional war with International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom, the XWA carried the lineage of the championship simply renaming it the British Heavyweight Championship and using the same physical belt. However, in April 2009, XWA founder Greg Lambert announced the creation of a new British Heavyweight Championship that did not bear the FWA initials and gave the original belt back to Alex Shane in time for the resurrection of the FWA.

On 17 February 2018 Rhia O’Reilly became the first woman to hold the title, defeating Cara Noir in an inter-promotional show with Pro Wrestling: EVE.

<text>Francis Vielé-Griffin (pseudonym of Egbert Ludovicus Viélé, 26 May 186412 November 1937), was a French symbolist poet. He was born at Norfolk, Virginia, USA, the son of General Egbert Ludovicus Viele, and moved to France with his mother (the former Teresa Griffin) in 1872.

Vielé-Griffin was educated in France and divided his time between Paris and Touraine. He was a writer of &quot;vers libre&quot; and founded the highly influential journal &quot;Entretiens politiques et littéraires&quot; (1890–92).
He wrote symbolist and vers-libre poetry. His first collection, &quot;Cueille d&#x27;avril&quot;, appeared in 1885. He practiced a relaxed prosody, which did not take into account the obligatory alternation of masculine and feminine rhymes, the prohibition to rhyme a plural with a singular, replaces the rhyme with an assonance, if not neglected here and there the rhyme or assonancer:

<text>By the Shores of Gitchee Gumee (1996) is a satirical novel by Tama Janowitz about the Slivenowiczes, a trailer park trash family who are forced to leave their home in a polluted swamp area in upstate New York (as Maud claims on p. 194 of the hardcover version) and who beg, steal and borrow their way across the United States until they end up in Hollywood. The characters&#x27; hyper-intelligent witty repartee, reminiscent of New Yorkers in a Tama Janowitz novel, highlights the tragedy of the family&#x27;s social and economic descent.

The first person narrator of the novel is 19-year-old Maud Slivenowicz, whose major source of knowledge is &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Her mother, Evangeline, has five children by five different deadbeat fathers. Without a regular income, the Slivenowicz family dream of becoming movie stars, and at the end of the book it seems one of Maud&#x27;s brothers might actually be given a role in a television commercial.

The title of the book relates to a famous line in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;.

&quot;By the Shores of Gitchee Gumee&quot; received reviews from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;.

<text>António Vieira (; 6 February 160818 July 1697) was a Portuguese Jesuit priest, diplomat, orator, preacher, philosopher, writer, and member of the Royal Council to the King of Portugal.

== Biography ==
Vieira was born in Lisbon to Cristóvão Vieira Ravasco, the son of a mulatto woman, Maria de Azevedo. In 1614 he accompanied his parents to the colony of Brazil, where his father had been posted as a registrar. He received his education at the Jesuit college at Bahia. He entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1625, under Father Fernão Cardim, and two years later pronounced his first vows. At the age of eighteen he was teaching rhetoric, and a little later dogmatic theology, at the college of Olinda, besides writing the &quot;annual letters&quot; of the province.

In 1635 he was ordained to the priesthood. He soon began to distinguish himself as an orator, and the three patriotic sermons he delivered at Bahia (1638–40) are remarkable for their imaginative power and dignity of language. The &quot;Sermon for the Good Success of the Arms of Portugal Against Those of Holland&quot; was considered by the Abbé Raynal to be &quot;perhaps the most extraordinary discourse ever heard from a Christian pulpit.

When the revolution of 1640 placed John IV on the throne of Portugal, Brazil gave him her allegiance, and Vieira was chosen to accompany the viceroy&#x27;s son to Lisbon to congratulate the new king. His talents and aptitude for affairs impressed John IV so favorably that he appointed him tutor to the Infante Dom Pedro, royal preacher, and a member of the Royal Council.

Vieira did efficient work in the War and Navy Departments, revived commerce, urged the foundation of a national bank and the organization of the Brazilian Trade Company.

Vieira used the pulpit to propound measures for improving the general and particularly the economic condition of Portugal. His pen was as busy as his voice, and in four notable pamphlets he advocated the creation of companies of commerce, denounced as unchristian a society which discriminated against New Christians (Muslim and Jewish converts), called for the reform of the procedure of the Inquisition and the admission of Jewish and foreign traders, with guarantees for their security from religious persecution. He argued to the king that Jewish merchants would benefit the kingdom, remedying its current &quot;miserable state.&quot;

He did not spare his own estate, for in his Sexagesimalsermon he boldly attacked the current style of preaching, its subtleties, affectation, obscurity and abuse of metaphor, and declared the ideal of a sermon to be one which sent men away &quot; not contented with the preacher, but discontented with themselves.&quot;

In 1647 Vieira began his career as a diplomat, in the course of which he visited England, France, the Netherlands and Italy. In his &quot;Papel Forte&quot; he urged the cession of Pernambuco to the Dutch as the price of peace, while his mission to Rome in 1650 was undertaken in the hope of arranging a marriage between the heir to the throne of Portugal and the only daughter of King Philip IV of Spain. His success, freedom of speech and reforming zeal had made him enemies on all sides, and only the intervention of the king prevented his expulsion from the Society of Jesus, so that prudence counselled his return to Brazil.

In his youth he had vowed to consecrate his life to the conversion of the African slaves and native Indians of his adopted country, and arriving in Maranhão early in 1653 he recommenced his apostolic labors, which had been interrupted during his stay of fourteen years in the Old World. Starting from Pará, he penetrated to the banks of the Tocantins, making numerous converts to Christianity and European civilization among the most violent tribes; but after two years of unceasing labour, during which every difficulty was placed in his way by the colonial authorities, he saw that the Indians must be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the governors, to prevent their exploitation, and placed under the control of the members of a single religious society.

Accordingly, in June 1654 he set sail for Lisbon to plead the cause of the Indians, and in April 1655 he obtained from the king a series of decrees which placed the missions under the Society of Jesus, with himself as their superior, and prohibited the enslavement of the natives, except in certain specified cases. Returning with this charter of freedom, he organized the missions over a territory having a coast-line of 400 leagues, and a population of 200,000 souls, and in the next six years (1655–61) the indefatigable missionary set the crown on his work. After a time, however, the colonists, attributing the shortage of slaves and the consequent diminution in their profits to the Jesuits, began actively to oppose Vieira, and they were joined by members of the secular clergy and the other Orders who were jealous of the monopoly enjoyed by the company in the government of the Indians.

Vieira was accused of want of patriotism and usurpation of jurisdiction, and in 1661, after a popular revolt, the authorities sent him with thirty-one other Jesuit missionaries back to Portugal. He found his friend King John IV dead and the court a prey to faction, but, dauntless as ever in the pursuit of his ambition, he resorted to his favorite arm of preaching, and on Epiphany Day, 1662, in the royal chapel, he replied to his persecutors in a famous rhetorical effort, and called for the execution of the royal decrees in favor of the Indians.

Circumstances were against him, however, and the Count of Castelo Melhor, fearing his influence at court, had him exiled first to Porto and then to Coimbra; but in both these places he continued his work of preaching, and the reform of the Inquisition also occupied his attention. To silence him his enemies then denounced him to that tribunal, and he was cited to appear before the Holy Office at Coimbra to answer points smacking of heresy in his sermons, conversations and writings. He had believed in the prophecies of a 16th-century shoemaker poet, Bandarra, dealing with the coming of a ruler who would inaugurate an epoch of unparalleled prosperity for the church and for Portugal, these new prosperous times were to be called the Quinto Império or &quot;Fifth Empire&quot; (also called &quot;Sebastianism&quot;). In Vieira&#x27;s famous opus, Clavis Prophetarum, he had endeavoured to prove the truth of his dreams from passages of Scripture. As he refused to submit, the Inquisitors kept him in prison in Coimbra from October 1665 to December 1667, and finally imposed a sentence which prohibited him from teaching, writing or preaching. 

It was a heavy blow for the Jesuits, and though Vieira recovered his freedom and much of his prestige shortly afterwards on the accession of King Pedro II, for example it is known that, in 1669, in Lisbon, Cosimo III de Médici had the opportunity to talk several times with Antònio Vieira and to attend his famous masses. However, it was soon determined that he should go to Rome to procure revision of the sentence, which still hung over him though the penalties had been removed. During a six years&#x27; residence in the Eternal City, Vieira won his greatest triumphs. Pope Clement X invited him to preach before the College of Cardinals, and he became confessor to Queen Christina of Sweden and a member of her literary academy.

At the request of the pope he drew up a report of two hundred pages on the Inquisition in Portugal, with the result that after a judicial inquiry Pope Innocent XI suspended it in Portugal for seven years (1674–81). Ultimately, Vieira returned to Portugal with a papal bull exempting him from the jurisdiction of the grand inquisitor, and in January 1681 he embarked for Brazil. He resided in Bahia and occupied himself in revising his sermons for publication, and in 1687 he became superior of the province. A false accusation of complicity in an assassination, and the intrigues of members of his own Company, clouded his last months, and on 18 July 1697 he died in Salvador, Bahia.

==Legacy==
António Vieira is considered one of the literary greats of the Portuguese-speaking world. The Padre António Vieira Chair in Portuguese Studies, at the Pontifícia Universidade Católica-Rio de Janeiro was created on 7 October 1994, to train teachers and researchers in the social sciences. Promoting academic exchanges between Brazil and Portugal, the Chair&#x27;s main aim has been to deepen the cultural dialog that already exists between the two countries within the university context. The Chair is involved in the training of teachers in the areas of Portuguese Literature and Culture, Portuguese Language, and Lusophone Literatures.

In 1997 Portugal issued a commemorative coin to mark the 300th anniversary of the death of Father Vieira.

Portugal issued a stamp in 2008, celebrating the 400th anniversary of Vieira&#x27;s birth (1608). Brasil has issued already two Vieira stamps, in 1941 and 1997.

A statue of Father António Vieira by the sculptor Marco Fidalgo, was unveiled on the Largo Trindade Coelho near the church of São Roque in 2017, on the initiative of the Holy House of Mercy of Lisbon, Portugal.

== Works ==
His works form perhaps the greatest monument of Portuguese prose. Two hundred discourses exist to prove his fecundity, while his versatility is shown by the fact that he could treat the same subject differently on half a dozen occasions. His letters, simple and conversational in style, have a deep historical and political interest, and form documents of the first value for the history of the period.

His principal works are:
*&quot;Sermões&quot; (Sermons) (15 vols., Lisbon, 1679–1748); there are many subsequent editions, but none complete; translations exist in Spanish, Italian, German and French, which have gone through several editions Archive
*&quot;História do Futuro&quot; (History of the Future) (Lisbon, 1718; 2nd ed., ibid., 1755); this and the Quinto Império and this Clavis Prophetarum seem to be in essence one and the same book in different redactions
*&quot;Cartas&quot; (Letters) (3 vols., Lisbon, 1735–46)
*&quot;Notícias recônditas do modo de proceder a Inquisição de Portugal com os seus presos&quot; (News on how the Portuguese Inquisition proceeds with its prisoners) (Lisbon, 1821)
*&quot;Arte de Furtar&quot; (The Art of Stealing) published under Vieira&#x27;s name in many editions; is now known not to be a work by him

A badly edited edition of the works of Vieira in 27 volumes appeared in Lisbon, 1854–58. There are unpublished manuscripts of his in the British Museum in London, and in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. A bibliography of Vieira will be found in Sommervogel, Bibliothèque de la compagnie de Jesus, viii. 653–85.

&quot;The Complete Works of Father António Vieira&quot;, annotated and updated, began publication in 2013, nearly four centuries after his birth. The 30 volumes of this publication comprise his complete letters, sermons, prophetic works, political writings, writings on Jews and Indians, as well as his poetry and theatrical works; it is the first complete and carefully edited publication of all of Vieira&#x27;s many writings. One of the largest editorial projects of its kind, it was the result of international cooperation among various Luso-Brazilian research institutions and scientific, cultural and literary academies, under the aegis of the Rectory of the University of Lisbon. More than 20 thousand folios of manuscripts and printed pages attributed to Vieira were analyzed and compared, in dozens of libraries and archives in Portugal, Brazil, Spain, France, Italy, England, Holland, Mexico and in the United States of America. About one quarter of &quot;The Complete Works&quot; are made of previously undiscovered and unreleased texts. The project, directed by José Eduardo Franco and Pedro Calafate, was developed by CLEPUL in partnership with Santa Casa da Misericórdia, and published by Círculo de Leitores, with the final volume to be released in 2014. Although this is a Portuguese edition, a selection of his works will be made available in 12 languages as part of the project.

==Quotations==
&quot;We are what we do. What we don&#x27;t do, doesn&#x27;t exist. Therefore, we only exist on days when we do. On the days when we don&#x27;t do, we simply endure&quot;.

&quot;The end for which men invented books was to preserve the memory of past things against the tyranny of time and against the forgetfulness of man, which is an even greater tyranny.&quot;

&quot;Holland, is the land which flows with milk, and Brazil is the land which flows with honey; and when the one is joined to the other, they become wholly and properly the Land of Promise, a land flowing with milk and honey.&quot;

<doc id="902002" wikidata="Q3089290" url="?curid=902002" title="Jean-Marie Pelt">
<text>Jean-Marie Pelt (24 October 1933 – 23 December 2015) was a French biologist, botanist and pharmacist with degrees in both biology and pharmacy.

He was professor at the University of Lorraine, specializing in medicinal plants and traditional pharmacopeia, and is the author of several scientific articles and books on pharmaceutical plants, plant biology and urban ecology. Pelt was known to the French public as the producer of several television series and radio broadcasts on plant biology and ecology. He has been nicknamed the &quot;Konrad Lorenz of the vegetable world&quot;.

==Scientific works==
Through his academic career, Pelt studied the science of medicinal plants, phytopharmacology, phytotherapy, and phytotoxicology. He specifically focused on the repertories of drugs and medicinal plants of Afghanistan, Chile, Europe, and Yemen.

==Institutional roles==
In addition to his research work at the university of Nancy and more recently the University of Lorraine, Pelt founded the European Institute of Ecology in 1972 and co-founded the French Society of Ethnopharmacology in 1987 and the Committee of Independent Research and Information on the Genetic Engineering in 1999. Along with Simone Veil, Jacques Delors or Corinne Lepage, Pelt was a fellow member of the Committee 21, the French deliberative assembly for the environment and sustainable development which is in charge of implementing the Agenda 21 action plan.

==Urban ecology concepts and applications==

As municipal councilor of Metz between 1971 and 1983, Pelt pioneered a policy of urban ecology. Because of the failure in post-war urban planning and housing estates occurring in Europe during the 1960s, and gathering inspiration from the concepts of CIAM, Professor Pelt initiated a new approach towards the urban environment. He developed his ideas on this topic in &quot;The Re-Naturalized Human&quot;, a pioneering book from 1977 which was awarded the European Prize of Ecology.

Based on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt&#x27;s theories advocated for a better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept concerning the relation between &quot;stones and waters&quot;. His ideas were materialized in Metz with the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large areas for walking. He died on 23 December 2015.

<text>Eystein Halfdansson (Old Norse: &quot;Eysteinn Hálfdansson&quot;) was the son of Halfdan Hvitbeinn of the House of Yngling according to Norse tradition. 

He inherited the throne of Romerike. Ari Thorgilsson in his Íslendingabók calls him Eystein Fart (Old Norse: &quot;Eystein fret/fjert&quot;) without comment, in his king list, just naming his father and his son. Snorri does not call him by this nickname, but does give us a colorful story of his life.

His wife was Hild, the daughter of the king of Vestfold, Erik Ragnarsson. Erik had no son, so Eystein obtained Vestfold as his wife&#x27;s inheritance.

According to &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Eystein died returning from a viking raid to Varna, on the eastern side of the Oslofjord. Eystein&#x27;s men had finished looting and pillaging the area and were already almost across the fjord, when King Skjöld of Varna, a great warlock, arrived at the beach and saw the sails of Eystein&#x27;s ships. He waved his cloak and blew into it which caused a sailbearing spar (boom) of one close sailing ship in heavy sea to swing and hit Eystein so that he fell overboard and drowned. His body was salvaged and buried in a mound at Borre. Eystein was succeeded by his son Halfdan the Mild.

<text>Halfdan the Mild (Old Norse: &quot;Hálfdan hinn mildi ok hinn matarilli&quot;, (meaning the generous and stingy on food)) was the son of king Eystein Halfdansson, of the House of Yngling and he succeeded his father as king, according to Heimskringla. He was king of Romerike and Vestfold.

He was said to be generous in gold but would starve his men of food. He was a great warrior who often pillaged and gathered great amounts of loot.

His wife was Liv, the daughter of king Dag of Vestmar. Halfdan the Mild died of illness in his bed.

He was succeeded by his son, Gudrød the Hunter.

According to the historian Halvdan Koht, Halfdan may have been the one to win independence for Vestfold during the turbulent years of 813–14. The Frankish annals state that the kings of Hedeby had to solve an uprising in Vestfold at this time. According to &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, Halfdan&#x27;s people &quot;gained victory&quot; in the uprising against King Hemming of the Danes, quite possibly because of the King of the Scyldingas in Hedeby, Southern Jutland were succumbing to Emperor Charlemagne, accepting the Peace of Heiligen and thereby the novel Christendom of the Frankish Romans, which split the Danes, whereupon King Halfdan appears to become the first King of the Scyldingas (the Danish royal clan), seated in Vestfold, north of Skagerrak.

<text>The Covini C6W is an Italian 2-seat 2-door sports coupé with a removable roof section. Inspiration for the car was taken from the 1976 Tyrrell P34, which had two pairs of smaller front wheels, a principle applied to the C6W. The project was started in 1974, but abandoned shortly after, and left dormant into the 1980s due to the lack of availability of low-profile tires at the time. In 2003, the project was revived and in 2004, the C6W was shown in prototype form. In 2005, a slightly revised version debuted at the Salon International de l&#x27;Auto, featuring new wheels, new roof structure and a refreshed interior, and went into limited production of 6-8 cars per year, as a result of a tie-up between PMI and Covini Engineering. The car features a mid-mounted 4.2L V8 engine and has a top speed of .

<text>William David Ford (August 6, 1927 – August 14, 2004) was a U.S. Representative from Michigan and namesake of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program. Ford was known for his support of workers and educational opportunity. Among his significant legislative accomplishments were authoring the Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the &quot;WARN Act&quot; or &quot;Plant Closing Act&quot;) and the Middle Income Student Assistance Act, and his key role in passing the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. In 1994, the Federal Direct Student Loan Program was named in his honor.

==Biography==
Ford was born in Detroit and attended Henry Ford Trade School, Melvindale High School, Nebraska State Teachers College, and Wayne State University. His father, a Scottish immigrant, was an autoworker who was killed on the job, an incident that influenced Ford&#x27;s political views.

He interrupted his studies to serve in the United States Navy during World War II, 1944–1946. He also served in the United States Air Force Reserve from 1950 to 1958.

After the war, he received a B.A. from the University of Denver in 1949, and a J.D. from that university&#x27;s College of Law in 1951. He was admitted to the bar in 1951 and practiced law in Taylor, Michigan. He was justice of the peace for Taylor Township, 1955–1957; city attorney for Melvindale, 1957–1959; and attorney for Taylor Township, 1957–1964.

He was a delegate to the Michigan constitutional convention, 1961–1962, which drafted the state constitution adopted in 1963. He was a member of the Michigan State Senate, 1962–1964; member and officer of Michigan&#x27;s Sixteenth District Democratic Organization, 1952–1964; delegate to Michigan Democratic conventions, 1952–1970, and to the Democratic National Convention in 1968. He was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives for the 89th and the fourteen succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1965 to January 3, 1995.

He was chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service in the 97th through 101st Congresses, and of the Committee on Education and Labor in the 102nd and 103rd Congresses. He did not seek re-election in the 1994 election.

Ford died in 2004 at his home in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan of complications from a stroke and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

Despite their shared surname and home state, William D. Ford was not related to either the Henry Ford family or U.S. president Gerald Ford.

<text>Electrocompaniet is a Norwegian manufacturer of audio products basing their ideal sound not on technical measurements and theory but on getting a sound most true to the live listening experience. Their amplifiers have been used in several Recording Studios, including Abbey Road Studios.

== History ==
Electrocompaniet was established in 1973 by Per Abrahamsen and Svein Erik Børja. Their idea was to create a transistor amplifier that is better sounding than transistor amplifiers did at the time. Abrahamsen and Børja based their circuits on research done by Matti Otala of Tampere University of Technology. Their first finished product was a 25 Watt power amplifier named 
&quot;The 2 Channel Audio Power Amplifier&quot;, also called &quot;The Otala Amplifier&quot;. They continued development on the product. In 1976 a respected high end audio magazine at the time &quot;The Audio Critic&quot; reviewed the amplifier and wrote: &quot;Audio freaks – eat your hearts out. This is the world’s best-sounding amplifier.&quot; In 1991
Michael Jackson&#x27;s producer Bruce Swedien was contacted by Nils Bjarne Kvam, one of the biggest producers in Norway at the time, was told about the amplifiers of Electrocompaniet, which interested Swedien. The amplifier was packed and shipped to the US in September 1991. Bruce was working with the last mix to Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous&quot;. He loved the amplifiers and wanted to use it on the album, but the album was almost done, and he would then have to remaster it all over again since the difference was so big. Swedien therefore used the amplifiers on the next albums. He used it for the first time with Sergio Mendez, and with Jackson in January 1995. His next two albums, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Invincible,&quot; were both mastered with the amplifiers, and both albums thanked Electrocompaniet with logo on its covers.

In 2004, the company went bankrupt, but in 2007 the company was bought up by Norwegian company &quot;Westcontrol&quot;. All production was moved to Tau, near Stavanger. Today they are represented in over 50 countries worldwide. In June 2018, Electrocompaniet filed for bankruptcy for the second time. The company was then acquired by a group of investors who resumed operations of the company.

== Notable products ==

=== The 2 channel audio power amplifier ===
The 2 channel audio power amplifier was the first amplifier Electrocompaniet produced. It was a 2x25 Watt Stereo power amplifier based on the works of Dr. Matti Otala on TIM-free transistor design. It has been updated and re-produced several times. Since it was only 2x25 Watt Electrocompaniet designed bigger amplifiers with more wattage but with the same sound characteristics.

=== NEMO AW 600 monaural class A reference amplifier===
The AW600 NEMO monaural class A reference amplifier by Electrocompaniet is used in listening and reference studios across the world. It is often coupled with the Bowers &amp; Wilkins Nautilus reference, and the 800 Diamond series loudspeakers.

Electrocompaniet maded this amplifier to be matched with the Nautilus loudspeakers. At the time of realization for Nautilus, there were few power amplifiers capable of delivering the power that they required. Electrocompaniet named their new mono amplifier after Nemo, the fictional captain of the Nautilus submarine from the 1870 novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;.

NEMO was at some point used in Abbey Road Studios. 

=== EMC 1 CD player===
In 1998, Electrocompaniet produced a CD player called the EMC 1. Since then, Electrocompaniet has produced several updates of the EMC. The MKV features 24-bit upsampling, SACD, an electromechanical cancellation system, fully balanced D/A converter, separate transformers and PCB&#x27;s.

=== ECG 1 turntable===
Electrocompaniet developed their first turntable in late 2014. The turntable uses a Jelco tonearm, and a custom-made cartridge by pick-up manufacturer Soundsmith. The plinth is made of three layers, consisting of two layers acrylic, and one aluminum layer in the middle. This so-called &quot;sandwich&quot; construction isolates the plinth from vibrations and resonance. It has a motor control that can play 33 1/3, 45 and 78 RPM records.

<doc id="902020" wikidata="Q2363492" url="?curid=902020" title="Battle of El Guettar">
<text>The Battle of El Guettar took place during the Tunisia Campaign of World War II, fought between elements of the Army Group Africa under General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim, along with Italian First Army under General Giovanni Messe, and U.S. II Corps under Lieutenant General George Patton in south-central Tunisia. It was the first battle in which U.S. forces were able to defeat the experienced German tank units, but the followup to the battle was inconclusive.

==Background==
The U.S. II Corps had been badly mauled in its first encounter with Axis forces in Tunisia during a series of battles that culminated in the disastrous Battle of Kasserine Pass in late February 1943. Erwin Rommel—poised on the threshold of a complete tactical victory—turned from the battle to return to his eastward-facing defenses at the Mareth Line when he heard of the approach of Bernard Montgomery′s British 8th Army. Thus the battle concluded with the U.S. forces still in the field, but having lost ground and men, and with little confidence in some key commanders.

In the last week of January 1943, despite a massive artillery bombardment, the Italian 14th Bersaglieri Battalion of the 131st Armoured Division Centauro dug in near Djebel Rihana. Harold V. Boyle, an Irish war correspondent, wrote that a second attack was required using grenades and bayonets in order to evict the Italians:

Artillery and aircraft may harass but cannot dislodge him. Only bullets and bayonets of rival riflemen can do that. This was well illustrated in the Ousseltia Valley campaign in January when tanks and artillery laid down one of the finest barrages of the campaign but couldn&#x27;t rout Italians dug in like moles in the hills bordering the road to Kairouan. The artillery was beautiful to see but they couldn&#x27;t do the job alone. Finally American infantry swarmed up the hills at night and flushed the Italians out in droves with hand grenades and the pointed persuasion of their bayonets.

The American command reacted to its reverses against German and Italian forces with a prompt and sweeping series of changes in command, discipline, and tactics. Also, large units were kept massed rather than being broken up into smaller, unsupported elements as had been done under U.S. II Corps Commander Lloyd Fredendall. Close air support was also improved.

On 6 March 1943, George Patton took command of the U.S. II Corps from Lloyd Fredendall, who had been in command before and during the Kasserine engagement. His first move was to organize his U.S. II Corps for an offensive back toward the Eastern Dorsal chain of the Atlas Mountains. If successful, this would threaten the right rear of the Axis forces defending the Mareth Line facing Montgomery&#x27;s 8th Army and ultimately make their position untenable. Patton&#x27;s style of leadership was very different from his predecessor: he is reported to have issued an order in connection with an attack on a hill position ending &quot;I expect to see such casualties among officers, particularly staff officers, as will convince me that a serious effort has been made to capture this objective&quot;.

On 17 March, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division moved forward into the almost abandoned plains, taking the town of Gafsa and preparing it as a forward supply base for further operations. On the 18th, the 1st Ranger Battalion—led by Colonel William O. Darby—pushed ahead, and occupied the oasis of El Guettar, again meeting with little opposition. The Italian defenders instead retreated and took up positions in the hills overlooking the town, thereby blocking the mountain pass (of the same name) leading south out of the interior plains to the coastal plain. Another operation by the Rangers raided an Italian position and took 200 prisoners on the night of 20 March, scaling a sheer cliff and passing ammunition and equipment up hand-over-hand.

==Battle==
===Axis attacks===

The Axis army commanders had become aware of the U.S. movements and decided that the 10th Panzer Division should stop them. Rommel had departed Tunisia for Germany on 9 March before the battle, leaving von Arnim in control of the newly named Africa Korps. Von Arnim also held Rommel&#x27;s opinion on the low quality of the American forces and felt that a spoiling attack would be enough to clear them from the Eastern Dorsals again.

At 06:00 on 23 March, 50 tanks of Broich&#x27;s 10th Panzer emerged from the pass into the El Guettar valley at . German motorised units in halftracks and motorcycle sidecars broke off from formation and charged the infantry on the top of the hill. The halftracks would move up the hill as far as they could and then the infantry they carried would dismount while covered by fire from 88mms. The Germans were maneuvering to hit American artillery anchored on the hill. They quickly overran front-line infantry and artillery positions. Major General Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr.—commanding the U.S. 1st Infantry Division—was threatened when two tanks came near his headquarters, but he shrugged off suggestions of moving, &quot;I will like hell pull out, and I&#x27;ll shoot the first bastard who does.&quot;

The German attack lost momentum when it ran into a minefield. When the Germans slowed to reorganize, U.S. artillery and anti-tank guns engaged, including 31 M10 tank destroyers which had recently arrived. Over the next hour, 30 of the 10th Panzer&#x27;s tanks were destroyed, and by 09:00 they retreated from the valley.

A second attempt was made at 16:45, after waiting for the infantry to form up. Once again the U.S. artillery was able to disrupt the attack, eventually breaking the charge and inflicting heavy losses. Realizing that further attacks were hopeless, the rest of the 10th Panzer Division dug in on hills to the east or retreated back to the German headquarters at Gabès.

===Allied attacks===
On 19 March, the British 8th Army launched their attack on the Mareth Line, at first with little success.

Over the next week, the U.S. forces slowly moved forward to take the rest of the interior plains and set up lines across the entire Eastern Dorsals. The German and Italian defenses and reserves were heavy, and the progress was both slow and costly. On 23 March, the 10th Panzer Division attacked Lieutenant-Colonel Robert H. York&#x27;s 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, and the German tanks broke through the valley between the 3rd and 1st Battalions of the 1st Division, reaching a position about six miles to the rear of the 1st Battalion. In the action, the German tanks and self-propelled guns along with German troops riding in carriers and trucks overran the 32nd Field Artillery Battalion and part of the 5th Field Artillery Battalion, and the Italian High Command reported that 40 tanks had been destroyed and 170 Allied troops had been captured in &quot;central and southern Tunisia&quot;.

On 26 March, in &quot;Operation Supercharge II&quot;, a British force sent via an outflanking inland route attacked the Tebaga Gap to the north of the Mareth line, and their breakthrough left the Mareth defenses untenable. The Axis forces retreated about 40 miles to a new line set up at Wadi Akarit, north of Gabès at . This made the U.S. position even more valuable, since the road through El Guettar led directly into Gabès.

By 30 March the U.S. forces were in position for an offensive south from El Guettar. In order to start a breakout, the two original Italian strongpoints on Hill 369 and Hill 772 had to be taken, one after the other.

The U.S. plan involved the U.S. 1st and 9th Infantry Divisions, and Combat Command 1/3 of the U.S. 1st Armored Division, collectively known as &quot;Benson Force&quot;. This force attacked Hill 369 on the afternoon of 30 March but ran into mines and anti-tank fire, losing five tanks and a rifle company from the 2nd Battalion of Colonel Edwin H. Randle&#x27;s 47th Infantry Regiment that was forced to surrender. The tanks were withdrawn, and the 1st and 9th attacked again the next day at 06:00, gaining some ground and taking several hundred prisoners. However, an Italian counter-attack drove them back from their newly gained positions, and by 12:45 they were back where they started with the loss of nine tanks and two tank destroyers. A further attempt the next day on 1 April also failed, after barely getting started. Private Emil J. Dedonato remembers that Patton drove up to the 47th Regiment&#x27;s command post, unhappy that the initial attacks had failed:

Patton was in a huffy mood and stormed over to see Colonel Randle in his Jeep. It was obvious he wasn&#x27;t pleased with the initial results of the night attack. I&#x27;ll never forget Colonel Randle&#x27;s instructions as they moved into El Guettar: &quot;Where we&#x27;re going you won&#x27;t need a physic!&quot;

At this point Patton received orders to start the attempt on Hill 772, even though Hill 369 was still under Italian control. The 9th was moved to Hill 772, leaving the 1st on Hill 369. By 3 April, the 1st had finally cleared Hill 369, but the battle on Hill 772 continued. The Italian commander—General Messe—then called in support from the German 21st Panzer Division, further slowing progress. The tempo of the operations slowed, and the lines remained largely static.

==Aftermath==

On 6 April, the British 8th Army once again overran the Axis lines at the Battle of Wadi Akarit, and a full retreat started. On the morning of 7 April, Benson Force moved through the positions held by the 1st and 9th divisions, and raced down the abandoned El Guettar-Gabès road, where it met the lead elements of the 8th Army at 17:00. With the last Axis line of defense in the south of Tunisia broken, the remaining forces made a run to join the other Axis forces in the north. Tunis fell to the Allies in early May.

<text>Nathaniel Brassey Halhed (25 May 1751 – 18 February 1830) () was an English Orientalist and philologist.

Halhed was born at Westminster, and was educated at Harrow School, where he began a close friendship with Richard Brinsley Sheridan. While at Oxford he undertook oriental studies under the influence of William Jones. Accepting a writership in the service of the East India Company, he went out to India, and there, at the suggestion of Warren Hastings, translated the Hindu legal code from a Persian version of the original Sanskrit. This translation was published in 1776 as &quot;A Code of Gentoo Laws&quot;. In 1778 he published &quot;A Grammar of the Bengal Language&quot;, a Bengali grammar, to print which he set up the first Bengali press in India.

In 1785 Halhed returned to England, and from 1790 to 1795 was member of parliament for Lymington, Hants. For some time he was a disciple of Richard Brothers, and a speech in parliament in defence of Brothers made it impossible for him to remain in the House of Commons, from which he resigned in 1795. He subsequently obtained a home appointment under the East India Company. He died in London on 18 February 1830.

==Early life==

Nathaniel Brassey Halhed was born in a merchant family to William Halhed, a bank director, on 25 May 1751 and christened in St Peter le Poer, Old Broad Street; his mother was Frances Caswall, daughter of John Caswall, Member of Parliament for Leominster. He went to Harrow School from the age of seven to seventeen.

Halhed entered Christ Church, Oxford on 13 July 1768, at the age of 17. He remained there for three years but did not take a degree. William Jones had preceded him from Harrow to Oxford and they shared an intellectual relationship. At Oxford he learnt some Persian.

Halhed&#x27;s father was disappointed in him and decided to send him to India under the employment of the East India Company through his connections. His petition for a writership was granted by Harry Verelst. Appointed on 4 December 1771, Halhed was forewarned and had learned accounting.

==In India==
Halhed was first placed in the accountant general&#x27;s office under Lionel Darrell. He was next used as a Persian translator, and was sent to Kasimbazar for practical experience, and also to learn about the silk trade, by William Aldersey. It was in Kasimbazar that Halhed acquired Bengali, for dealing with the &quot;aurungs&quot; (weaving districts). In Bengal he had several romantic interests: Elizabeth Pleydell, a certain Nancy, Diana Rochfort, and Henrietta Yorke.

Halhed became one of Warren Hastings&#x27;s favorites, and a believer in his approach to Indian affairs. On 5 July 1774 the Governor asked for an assistant for Persian documents, in addition to the &quot;munshis&quot;, and Halhed was appointed.

==Marriage==
After wooing several accomplished women, Halhed married (Helena) Louisa Ribaut, stepdaughter of Johannes Matthias Ross, the head of the Dutch factory at Kasimbazar when Halhed was stationed there. The betrothal probably took place in 1775.

==Association with Warren Hastings==
When Hastings then nominated him for the post of Commissary General in October 1776, however, there was serious resistance, and Halhed found his position untenable.

Leaving Bengal, Halhed went to Holland, and on to London. Financial reasons forced him to consider a return to India, but he tried to do so without overt support from Hastings. On 18 November 1783 he asked the company&#x27;s directors to appoint him to the committee of Revenue in Calcutta. He was successful, but not in dissociating himself from Hastings. He returned to India as a reputed Englishman with a wife and black servant, but when he reached Calcutta, Hastings was in Lucknow.

Halhed presented his credentials to Edward Wheler, the acting governor-general, but there was no vacancy in the committee and no other appointments could be made without Hastings. Then summoned by Hastings to Lucknow, he made a futile journey there, since Hastings had by then decided to leave for England and was bound for Calcutta.

Hastings was planning to bring supporters to England, and wanted to have Halhed there as an agent of the Nawab Wazir of Oudh. At this point Halhed threw in his lot with Hastings.

==Support for Hastings and Brothers==
Halhed therefore returned to England, on 18 June 1785, identified as a close supporter of Hastings. The political context was the rise in 1780–4 of the &quot;Bengal Squad&quot;, so-called.

The &quot;Bengal Squad&quot; was, in the first place, a group of Members of Parliament. They looked out for the interests of East India Company officials who had returned to Great Britain. From that position, they became defenders of the Company itself. The group that followed Hastings to England consisted of: Halhed, David Anderson, Major William Sands, Colonel Sweeney Toone, Dr. Clement Francis, Captain Jonathan Scott, John Shore, Lieutenant Col. William Popham, and Sir John D&#x27;Oyly. This group is called by Rosane Rocher the &quot;Hastings squad&quot; or &quot;Bengal squad&quot;. That follows the contemporary practice of identifying the &quot;Squad&quot; or &quot;the East Indians&quot; with the backers of Hastings.

Edmund Burke brought 22 charges against Hastings in April 1786, and Halhed was in the middle of the defence. For the Benares charge, Halhed had drafted a reply for Scott, but it was not in accord with Hastings&#x27;s chosen line. He also cast doubt on some of Hastings&#x27;s account when he was called on to testify. As a result, Halhed became unpopular with the defence team.

Halhed began to look for a parliamentary career: his choice of enemies made him a Tory. His first candidature, at Leicester in 1790, failed and cost him a great deal. He succeeded in acquiring a seat in May 1791 at the borough of Lymington, in Hampshire. His life was changed in 1795 by Richard Brothers and his prophecies. &quot;A revealed knowledge of the Prophecies and Times&quot; appealed to Halhed and resonated with the style of antique Hindu texts. He petitioned for Brothers in parliament when he was arrested for criminal lunacy. Unsuccessful, he damaged his own reputation.

==Life of seclusion and after==
The turn of the century saw Halhed a recluse, as he was for 12 years in all. He wrote on orientalist topics, but published nothing. From 1804 he was a follower of Joanna Southcott. In poverty, he applied for one of the newly opened civil secretary posts at the East India company, and was appointed in 1809.

With access to the Company Library, Halhed spent time in 1810 translating a collection of Tipu Sultan&#x27;s dreams written in the prince&#x27;s own hand. He also made translations of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; as a personal study, fragmentary in nature, and made to &quot;understand the grand scheme of the universe&quot;.

The old &quot;Hastings squad&quot; had become marginal after the trial, but Hastings was called to testify as an expert on Indian affairs in 1813. He died on 22 August 1818. Halhed wrote two poems, and was also given the responsibility of composing the epitaph.

In spring 1819, Halhed declared his intention of resigning from the company&#x27;s services after ten years of service. He was allowed a £500 salary, and recovered some of his early investments.

==Death==

Halhed lived on for another decade, without publishing anything further. His quiet life came to an end on 18 February 1830. He was buried in the family tomb of Petersham Parish Church. At his death his assets were estimated to be around £18,000. Louisa Halhed lived for a year longer and died on 24 July 1831.

==Legacy==
Halhed&#x27;s collection of Oriental manuscripts was purchased by the British Museum, and his unfinished translation of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; went to the library of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.
==Works==
Halhed&#x27;s major works are those he produced in Bengal, in the period 1772 to 1778.

===&quot;A Code of Gentoo Laws&quot;===
Just before Halhed was appointed as writer, the East India Company&#x27;s court of directors notified the President and council at Fort William College of their decision to take over the local administration of civil justice: the implementation was left with the newly appointed Governor, Warren Hastings. Hastings assumed the governorship in April 1772 and by August submitted what was to become the Judicial Plan. It provided among other things that &quot;all suits regarding the inheritance, marriage, caste and other religious usages, or institutions, the laws of the Koran with respect to Mohametans and those of the Shaster with respect to Gentoos shall be invariably adhered to.&quot; No British personnel could read Sanskrit, however.

Translation was undertaken and 11 pundits were hired. Hastings envisaged making a text in English that contained the local laws. He intended to show the prudence of applying the Indian laws.

The pundits worked to compile a text from multiple sources, the &quot;Vivadarnavasetu&quot; (sea of litigations). It was translated to Persian, via a Bengali oral version by Zaid ud-Din &#x27;Ali Rasa&#x27;i. Halhed then translated the Persian text into English, working with Hastings himself. The completed translation was available on 27 March 1775. The East India Company had it printed in London in 1776 as &quot;A Code of Gentoo Laws, or, Ordinations of the Pundits&quot;. This was an internal edition, distributed by the East India Company. A pirate
edition was printed by Donaldson the following year, followed by a second edition in 1781; translations in French and German appeared by 1778.

The book made Halhed&#x27;s reputation, but was controversial, given that the English translation was remote from its original. It failed to become the authoritative text of the Anglo-Indian judicial system. Its impact had more to do with Halhed&#x27;s preface and the introduction to Sanskrit than the laws themselves. &quot;The Critical Review&quot; wrote in London, September 1777, that:
Halhed in the preface stated that he had been &quot;astonished to find the similitude of Shanscrit words with those of Persian and Arabic, and even of Latin and Greek: and these not in technical and metaphorical terms, which the mutation of refined arts and improved manner might have occasionally introduced; but in the main ground-work of language, in monosyllables, in the names of numbers, and the appellations of such things as would be first discriminated as the immediate dawn of civilisation.&quot; This observation was shortly to be heralded as a major step towards the discovery of the Indo-European language family.

===&quot;A Grammar of the Bengal Language&quot;===
The East India Company lacked employees with good Bengali. Halhed proposed a Bengali translatorship to the Board of Trade, and set out a grammar of Bengali, the salaries of the &quot;pundits&quot; and the scribe who assisted him being paid by Hastings. Difficulty arose with a Bengali font. Charles Wilkins undertook it, the first Bengali press was set up at Hugli, and the work of creating the typeface was done by Panchanan Karmakar, under the supervision of Wilkins.

The grammar was the property of the company, Wilkins informed the council on 13 November 1778 that the printing was completed, by which time Halhed had left Bengal. Halhed&#x27;s &quot;Grammar&quot; was widely believed at the time to be the first grammar of Bengali, because the Portuguese work of Manuel da Assumpção, published in Lisbon in 1743, was largely forgotten.

===Other works===
Halhed&#x27;s early collaboration with Richard Brinsley Sheridan was not an overall success, though they laboured on works including &quot;Crazy Tales&quot; and the farce &quot;Ixiom&quot;, later referred to as &quot;Jupiter&quot;, which was not performed. Halhed left for India. One work, &quot;The Love Epistles of Aristaenetus. Translated from the Greek into English Metre&quot;, written by Halhed, revised by Sheridan and published anonymously, did make a brief stir. The friendship came to an end, Elizabeth Linley chose Sheridan over Halhed, and later they were political enemies.

The opening of the Calcutta Theatre in November 1773 gave Halhed occasion to write prologues. A production of &quot;King Lear&quot; also spurred him to write more pieces. He produced humorous verse: &quot;A Lady&#x27;s Farewell to Calcutta&quot;, was a lament for those who regretted staying in the &quot;&quot;.

Halhed wrote an anonymous tract in 1779 in defense of Hastings&#x27;s policies with respect to the Maratha War. He began to write poetry, also, expressing his admiration for the governor, such as a Horatian ode of 1782. Under the pseudonym of &quot;Detector&quot; he wrote a series of open letters that appeared in newspapers, as separate pamphlets and in collections. These letters span over a year, from October 1782 to November 1783.

In the decade of Hastings&#x27;s impeachment, Halhed remained involved in the war of pamphlets. The &quot;Upanisad&quot; (1787) was based on Dara Shikoh&#x27;s Persian translation. He wrote and distributed a &quot;Testimony of the Authenticity of the Prophecies of Richard Brothers, and of his Mission to recall the Jews&quot;. Scandalously, he identified London with Babylon and Sodom: and was judged eccentric or mad.

<doc id="902027" wikidata="Q33187" url="?curid=902027" title="Orion Arm">
<text>The Orion Arm, also known as the Orion–Cygnus Arm, is a minor spiral arm within the Milky Way Galaxy spanning in width and extending roughly in length. This galactic structure encompasses the Solar System, including Earth. It is sometimes referred to by alternate names such as the Local Arm or Orion Bridge, and it was previously identified as the Local Spur or the Orion Spur. It should not be confused with the outer terminus of the Norma Arm, known as the Cygnus Arm.

==Naming and brightness==
The arm is named after the Orion Constellation, one of the most prominent constellations of the Northern Hemisphere in winter (or the Southern Hemisphere in summer). Some of the brightest stars in the sky as well as other well-known celestial objects of the constellation (e.g. Betelgeuse, Rigel, the three stars of Orion&#x27;s Belt, and the Orion Nebula) are found within it, as shown on Orion Arm&#x27;s interactive map.

==Location==
The Orion arm is located between the Carina–Sagittarius Arm, the local portion of which projects toward the Galactic Center, and the Perseus Arm&#x27;s local portion, which forms the main outer-most arm.

Scientists once believed the Orion arm to be a minor structure, namely a &quot;spur&quot; between Carina-Sagittarius and Perseus, but evidence presented in 2013 suggests the Orion Arm to be a branch of the Perseus Arm or possibly an independent arm segment.

The Solar System is close to its inner rim, about halfway along the arm&#x27;s length, in a relative cavity in the arm&#x27;s interstellar medium, known as the Local Bubble. It is approximately from the Galactic Center.

==Composition==
Recently, the BeSSeL Survey (Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy Survey) analyzed the parallax and proper motion of more than 30 methanol (6.7-GHz) and water (22-GHz) masers in high-mass, star-forming regions within a few kiloparsecs of the Sun. Their measurement has accuracy above ±10% and even 3%. The accurate locations of interstellar masers in HMSFRs (high-mass star-forming regions) suggests the Local Arm appears to be an orphan segment of an arm between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms that wraps around less than a quarter of the Milky Way. The segment has a length of ~20,000 ly in length and ~3,000 ly in width, with a pitch angle of 10.1° ± 2.7° to 11.6° ± 1.8°. These results suggest the Local Arm is larger than previously thought, and both its pitch angle and star formation rate are comparable to those of the Galaxy’s major spiral arms. The Local Arm is reasonably referred to as the fifth feature in the Milky Way.

==Form==
To understand the form of the Local Arm between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms, the stellar density of a specific population of stars with about 1 Gyr of age between 90° ≤ l ≤ 270° have been mapped using the Gaia DR2. The 1 Gyr population have been employed because they are significantly more-evolved objects than the gas in HMSFRs tracing the Local Arm. Investigations have been carried out to compare both the stellar density and gas distribution along the Local Arm. Researchers have found a marginally significant arm-like stellar overdensity close to the Local Arm, identified with the HMSFRs, especially in the region of 90° ≤ l ≤ 190°. 

The researchers have concluded that the Local Arm segment is associated only with gas and star-forming clouds, showing a significant overdensity of stars. They have also found that the pitch angle of the stellar arm is slightly larger than the gas-defined arm, and there is an offset between the gas-defined and stellar arm. These differences in pitch angles and offsets between the stellar and HMSFR-defined spiral arms are consistent with the expectation that star formation lags behind gas compression in a spiral density wave that lasts longer than the typical star formation timescale of 107 − 108 years.

==Messier objects==
The Orion Arm contains a number of Messier objects:

*The Butterfly Cluster (M6)
*The Ptolemy Cluster (M7)
*Open Cluster M23
*Open Cluster M25
*The Dumbbell Nebula (M27)
*Open Cluster M29

<doc id="902030" wikidata="Q6107221" url="?curid=902030" title="J. T. Snow">
<text>Jack Thomas Snow Jr. (born February 26, 1968) is an American former professional baseball player and television sports color commentator, and current bench coach for the Oakland Ballers. He played as a first baseman in Major League Baseball from to , most notably as a member of the San Francisco Giants. Snow excelled as a defensive player, winning six consecutive Gold Glove Awards as a first baseman between 1995 and 2000. After his playing career, Snow worked in radio and television broadcasting. He has also worked as a special assistant to the General Manager for the Giants.

==Early life==
Snow was born in Long Beach, California, to former NFL player Jack Snow and Merry Carole Shane, who died in 1998 from thyroid cancer. He has two sisters, Michelle and Stephanie.

His father worked with him at first base, throwing balls from shortstop purposely in the dirt to improve his fielding skills. He played recreational baseball in Seal Beach, for what is now known as, Seal Beach PONY. Snow attended Los Alamitos High School in Los Alamitos, California and was awarded All-Orange County honors in baseball, football, and basketball. He played safety his junior year (1984) and quarterback his senior year (1985) on the varsity football team. Receiver Rob Katzaroff set an Orange County record with 93 single-season receptions (a record which still stands after the 2022 season) while Snow played quarterback. On the basketball team, Snow played point guard. On the baseball team, Snow played with future Giants reliever Robb Nen and future UCLA Bruins outfielder Katzaroff. All three Griffin baseball players from the 1985 season were eventually drafted to play minor league baseball.

==College career==
After high school, Snow attended the University of Arizona and played three seasons for the Arizona Wildcats baseball team, where his teammates included Kenny Lofton, Alan Zinter, Scott Erickson, Trevor Hoffman, and Kevin Long. In 1988, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
The New York Yankees selected Snow in the fifth round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft.

===New York Yankees (1992)===
He made his major league debut with the Yankees at the end of the 1992 season.

===California Angels (1993–1996)===
After the 1992 season, the Yankees traded Snow, Jerry Nielsen, and Russ Springer to the California Angels for Jim Abbott. Snow played for the Angels from 1993 to 1996, where he won two Gold Glove Awards.

===San Francisco Giants (1997–2005)===
Snow was traded to the Giants after the 1996 season for left-handed pitcher Allen Watson and minor league pitcher Fausto Macey.

While a switch-hitter earlier in his career, Snow batted exclusively left-handed after 1998. In 2000, he led the league in sacrifice flies with 14. After a two-year injury-riddled stretch from 2002 to 2003 when his batting average was .246, Snow rebounded in 2004 with a .327 average, hitting .387 after the All-Star break (which ranked second only to Ichiro Suzuki in the Major Leagues).

On June 26, 1999, Snow tagged out Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Carlos Pérez using the &quot;hidden ball trick&quot;, the last successful execution of the play in the 20th century.

In the 2000 National League Division Series against the New York Mets, with the Giants trailing 4–1 in the bottom of the ninth, Snow hit a three-run pinch-hit homer against Mets reliever Armando Benítez. However, the Giants failed to capitalize on their momentum, eventually falling in the 10th inning and going on to lose the series.

In the 2002 World Series, Snow was scoring a run in Game 5 off a Kenny Lofton triple and lifted 3-year-old Darren Baker, the Giants&#x27; batboy and son of then Giants’ manager Dusty Baker, by the jacket as he was crossing home plate. Darren had run out to collect Lofton&#x27;s bat before the play was completed. This turned into a touching and memorable incident, but easily could have resulted in disaster with a small child wandering into the path of Snow and David Bell as they both barreled home to score. Following the incident with Darren Baker, Major League Baseball required batboys and girls to be at least 14 years of age. A photograph of this incident now hangs in the Baseball Hall of Fame, in Cooperstown, New York.

In the 2003 National League Division Series against the Florida Marlins, with the Giants trailing 7–6 in Game 4 in the ninth inning, he attempted to score from second base on a single to left field, but Jeff Conine&#x27;s throw to the plate came in time as catcher Iván Rodríguez tagged Snow at the plate as Snow barreled into him, ending the game and the series. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was the first postseason series to end with the potential tying run thrown out at the plate.

===Boston Red Sox (2006)===
Snow&#x27;s tenure with the Giants effectively ended when the team declined to offer him salary arbitration before the 2006 season. He signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the Boston Red Sox on January 6, 2006. After his father&#x27;s death in 2006, Snow wore his father&#x27;s number 84 in his honor. He served primarily in a platoon with Kevin Youkilis at first base until he requested to be designated for assignment due to a lack of playing time. He was granted his designation June 19, and was officially released eight days later.

===San Francisco Giants (2008) and retirement===
At the end of the 2006 season, Snow retired from baseball and began working as a color commentator on Giants radio broadcasts alongside play-by-play announcer Dave Flemming. He has also served as an advisor to the Giants&#x27; general manager, Brian Sabean, and as a roving minor league instructor for the Giants. Since 2013, he has worked as a college baseball broadcaster for the Pac-12 Network.

On September 24, 2008, the Giants signed Snow to a one-day contract to allow him to retire as a Giant. However, rather than immediately retiring after signing the symbolic contract and receiving no actual pay as is usually done, Snow was penciled into the starting lineup and took the field on September 27 against the Dodgers, but was replaced before the first pitch. It was a move that allowed Snow to officially take the field as a Giants player one last time. Eugenio Vélez, Omar Vizquel, and Rich Aurilia threw balls in the dirt to mess with Snow during fielding practice prior to the first pitch, but Snow still made the plays. For his brief official appearance, he received the prorated league minimum salary of $2,100.
In 28 postseason games, Snow batted .327 (32-for-98) with 11 runs, 3 home runs and 15 RBI.

==Coaching career==
On January 18, 2024, Snow was announced as the first base coach and bench coach for the Oakland Ballers of the Pioneer League during their inaugural season.

==Personal life==
Snow lives in Northern California with his wife Gina.

<doc id="902035" wikidata="Q2448909" url="?curid=902035" title="Gudrød the Hunter">
<text>Gudrød the Hunter (Old Norse: &quot;Guðrøðr veiðikonungr&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;Gudrød Veidekonge&quot;, literally &quot;Gudrod Hunter-king&quot;; died 820 AD), also known as Gudrød the Magnificent (Old Norse: &quot;enn gǫfugláti&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;den gjeve&quot;), is a legendary character portrayed in the Norse sagas as a Norwegian petty king in the early 9th century. According to the sagas, he was the father of Halfdan the Black, and thus the grandfather of Harald Fairhair, the first king of unified Norway. He is considered by modern historians to be of a more mythical nature than other ancestors of Harald and Halfdan, and he can not be identified historically. Historians have in turn made a number of proposals seeking to identify him with various would-be contemporary historical figures.

==Background==

Gudrød was a member of the House of Yngling. He was the son of Halfdan the Mild, king of Romerike and Vestfold, and Liv, daughter of King Dag of Vestmar.

Gudrød is mentioned in the skaldic poem &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, and Snorri Sturluson elaborates on Gudrød&#x27;s story in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. According to Snorri, Gudrød was called both &quot;the Magnificent&quot; and &quot;the Hunter&quot;, while &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; only refers to him as &quot;the Magnificent&quot;.

==Legend==
While Gudrød is portrayed as a king in Uppland in some older texts, Snorri writes that his royal estates are in Vestfold. The term Kings of Uppland possibly refers to the great Thing of Kings in Uppsala in Uppland, comprising the Commonwealth of Sweden, encompassing both Danes, Finns, Norse, Vends and more. High King Gudrød first married Alfhild, a daughter of Alfarin, king of Alfheim (now Bohuslän). Gudrød inherited half the province of Vingulmark. They had a son, Olaf Geirstad-Alf. When Alfhild died, Gudrød sent his men to the king of Agder, Harald Granraude, to propose a marriage with his daughter Åsa. When Harald declined, Gudrød decided to take Åsa by force. They arrived at night. When Harald realised that he was being attacked, he assembled his men and fought well, but died together with his son Gyrd. Gudrød thereafter captured Åsa and married her. They had the son Halfdan the Black.

In the fall, when Halfdan was a year old, Gudrød was having at a feast in an otherwise unknown location called &quot;Stivlesund&quot;. He was very drunk and in the evening, as he was walking on the gangway to leave the ship, an assassin thrust a spear through Gudrød, killing him. Gudrød&#x27;s men instantly killed the assassin, who turned out to be Åsa&#x27;s page-boy. Åsa admitted that the page-boy had acted on her behalf. After Gudrød was killed, Åsa took the 1 year-old Halfdan and returned to Agder, where Halfdan was raised.

<doc id="902039" wikidata="Q1480778" url="?curid=902039" title="Comilla District">
<text>Comilla District, officially known as Cumilla District, () is a district located in southeastern Bangladesh. It lies about 100 kilometres south east of Dhaka. Comilla is bordered by Brahmanbaria and Narayanganj districts to the north, Noakhali and Feni districts to the south, Tripura state of India to the east and Munshiganj and Chandpur districts to the west.

==History==
The name Comilla is derived from the Bengali word &quot;Komolangko&quot; (), the previous ancient name of the region, which means &#x27;lotus pond&#x27;. The present Comilla is a district under the Chittagong Division. It was once under the reign of Gangaridai and Samatata in ancient period. As far as is known from the ancient archeology found in the region, Gupta emperors ruled Comilla since the fifth century AD. It was under the control of Gauda Kingdom in 6th century AD after the fall of Gupta rule in Bengal. According to historians, the Buddhist Deva dynasty ruled the region from the seventh to the middle of the eighth century. In the ninth century, Comilla came under the control of the kings of Harikela and Chandra dynasty during the tenth and mid-eleventh century AD. These rulers built the Shalban Vihara in the Mainamati hills, which was a major centre of Buddhist learning. The region became a part of Hindu Sena and Deva dynasty in the 12th and 13th centuries, and was one of the last strongholds of these dynasties after the invasion of the Delhi Sultanate.

Due to its position on the edge of the Bengal Delta, the Comilla region was often contested between the Delhi Sultanate and later Bengal Sultanate and the kings of Tripura whose heartland was in the hills to the east. The arrival of numerous Muslim &quot;pirs&quot; in the district caused the local Hindu and Buddhist population to largely adopt an Islamic identity In the 15th century the Tripura king Dharma Manikya I built the Dharmasagar tank in Comilla town. After the Mughal conquest of Bengal, the Mughals attacked the Tripura kingdom and conquered most of the present Comilla district, restricting the Tripura kings to the hills. The region became known as Chakla Roshanabad and was part of the Sarkar of Sonargaon of the Bengal Subah, although the Tripura kings still had &quot;Zamindari&quot; rights over much of the land. In the 18th century, the Comilla region saw the uprising of Shamsher Gazi from the current Feni district, who briefly ruled over the kingdom of Tripura and nearby lands until his execution in 1760 by the Nawabs of Bengal.

In 1765 as part of their obtaining the &quot;Diwani&quot; of Bengal, the East India Company took Comilla. In order to facilitate revenue collection, the company hired a district collector in the province in 1769. Comilla then belonged to the province of Dhaka. Comilla was made under the office of the district collector in 1776. The Tripura Collector&#x27;s journey began with the formation of Tippera or Tipperah district of Bengal by the British in 1790. According to the Third Regulation in 1793, a civil judge was appointed for the Tripura district and in that year he was given magisterial powers. In 1837, the posts of magistrates and collectors were separated. In 1859, these two posts were merged again.

In the 19th century the reforming influence of Maulana Keramat Ali largely caused the Muslims of the district to abandon all folk religious practices including the worship of minor deities and &quot;pirs&quot;. In the early 20th century the Tippera Krishak Samiti helped organise the peasants of the district and won most of the seats in the district in the 1937 elections. In the 1940s the mostly Muslim populace supported the Pakistan movement, and southern parts of the district were heavily affected by the Noakhali riots which led to a steady exodus of Hindus to India, especially neighbouring Tripura state. The district was made part of East Pakistan in 1947.

After the partition in 1947, the district was renamed Comilla in 1960 and the post of district magistrate and collector was named deputy commissioner. In 1971, 900 Bengali Muslim officers and men of the Pakistan Army were massacred in Comilla Cantonment. After a long guerilla struggle, Bangladeshi forces took Comilla from Pakistan on December 8, 1971, and Comilla became part of Bangladesh. Chandpur and Brahmanbaria sub-divisions of this district became districts in 1984.

==Geography and climate==
Comilla has a total area of 3146.30.17 square kilometres. It is bounded by Brahmanbaria district and Narayanganj district of Dhaka division to the north, Munshiganj district of Dhaka division and Chandpur district to the west, Noakhali and Feni districts to the south and the Indian state of Tripura to the east. The district headquarters of Comilla is located close to the Indian border, with the town of Sonamura on the other side. Major rivers passing through Comilla include the Gumti and the Little Feni, and the Meghna on the far northwest. It is hot in summer and cold in winter.

The district is primarily composed of plain land. Most of the district is situated on a bed of old elevated alluvial deposits called Chandina alluvium, while the northwestern part of the district is more recent alluvium deposited by the Meghna, while the far east consists of harder valley alluvium. The Lalmai Hills running parallel to the Tripura hills lie in the east of the district.

==Administration==
The administrative headquarters of Comilla are located in the city of Comilla which has a total area of 11.47 square kilometres. It consists of 18 mouzas and 3 wards. Comilla thana was officially converted into an upazila in 1983 which contains one municipality, 18 wards, 19 union parishads, 452 mouzas, and 458 villages.

<doc id="902040" wikidata="Q524272" url="?curid=902040" title="South-East Asian theatre of World War II">
<text>The South-East Asian Theatre of World War II consisted of the campaigns of the Pacific War in the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Indochina, Burma, India, Malaya, and Singapore between 1941 and 1945.

Japan attacked British and American territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific on 7/8 December 1941. Action in this theatre ended when Japan announced an intent to surrender on 15 August 1945. The formal surrender of Japan ceremony took place on 2 September 1945.

== Outbreak of hostilities ==
Conflict in this theatre began when the Empire of Japan invaded French Indochina in September 1940 and rose to a new level following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and simultaneous attacks on the Philippines, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore and Malaya on 7 and 8 December 1941. The main landing at Singora (now Songkhla) on the east side of the Isthmus of Kra preceded the bombing of Pearl Harbor by several hours.

Although Japan declared war on the United States and the British Empire, the declaration was not delivered until after the attacks began. On 8 December, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands declared war on Japan, followed by China and Australia the next day.

==Initial Japanese successes==
The Allies suffered many defeats in the first half of the war. Two major British warships, and were sunk by a Japanese air attack off Malaya on 10 December 1941. Following the invasion, the government of Thailand formally allied itself with Japan on 21 December. Japan invaded Hong Kong in the Battle of Hong Kong on 8 December, culminating in surrender on 25 December. January saw the invasions of Burma and the Dutch East Indies and the capture of Manila and Kuala Lumpur.

===Malaya and Singapore===
Japanese forces met stiff resistance from III Corps of the Indian Army, the Australian 8th Division, and British units during the Battle of Malaya, but Japan&#x27;s superiority in air power, tanks and infantry tactics drove the Allied units back. After being driven out of Malaya by the end of January 1942, Allied forces in Singapore, under the command of Lieutenant General Arthur Percival, surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942; about 130,000 Allied troops became prisoners of war. The fall of Singapore was the largest surrender in British military history.

===The Japanese Indian Ocean raid===
The Japanese Indian Ocean raid was a naval sortie by the Fast Carrier Strike Force of the Imperial Japanese Navy from 31 March to 10 April 1942 against Allied shipping and bases in the Indian Ocean. Following the destruction of the ABDACOM forces in the battles around Java in February and March, the Japanese sortied into the Indian Ocean to destroy British seapower there and support the invasion of Burma. The raid was only partially successful. It did not succeed in destroying Allied naval power in the Indian Ocean but it did force the British fleet to relocate from British Ceylon to Kilindini at Mombasa in Kenya, as their more forward fleet anchorages could not be adequately protected from Japanese attack. The fleet in the Indian Ocean was then gradually reduced to little more than a convoy escort force as other commitments called for the more powerful ships. From May 1942, it was also used in the invasion of Madagascar — an operation aimed at thwarting any attempt by Japan to use bases on the Vichy French controlled territory.

In 1942, Madras City was attacked by a Mitsubishi Rufe, (the Zero&#x27;s seaplane version) operating from the carrier which dropped a single bomb near the St. George Fort. The physical damage was negligible, though the public response was major and the city was evacuated because of fears of subsequent Japanese bombing and invasion. Many rich families from Madras moved permanently to the hill stations in fear.

Also in 1942 in preparation for a possible Japanese invasion of India, the British began improvements to the Kodaikanal-Munnar Road to facilitate its use as an evacuation route from Kodaikanal along the southern crest of the Palani Hills to Top Station. Existing roads then continued to Munnar and down to Cochin where British ships would be available for evacuation out of India.

===Japanese occupation of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands===

The Andaman and Nicobar Islands (8,293 km2 on 139 islands) are a group of islands situated in the Bay of Bengal at about 780 miles from Kolkata (known at the time as Calcutta), 740 miles from Chennai (known at the time as Madras) and 120 miles from Cape Nargis in Burma. On 23 March 1942 a Japanese invasion force seized the islands and occupied them until the end of the war.

On 29 December 1943, political control of the islands was theoretically passed to the Azad Hind government of Subhas Chandra Bose. Bose visited Port Blair to raise the tricolour flag of the Indian National Army. After Bose&#x27;s departure the Japanese remained in effective control of the Andamans, and the sovereignty of the &quot;Arzi Hukumat-e Hind&quot; was largely fictional. The islands themselves were renamed &quot;Shaheed&quot; and &quot;Swaraj&quot;, meaning &quot;martyr&quot; and &quot;self-rule&quot; respectively. Bose placed the islands under the governorship of Lt Col. A. D. Loganathan, and had limited involvement with the administration of the territory.

Qualification: For operations during the 14th Army&#x27;s advance from Imphal to Rangoon, the coastal amphibious assaults, and the Battle of Pegu Yomas, August 1944 to August 1945.

==Indian Ocean naval campaigns 1942–1945==

The earliest successes were gained by mine laying and submarine warfare. The Japanese minesweeping capability was never great, and when confronted with new types of mines they did not adapt quickly. Japanese shipping was driven from the Burmese coast using this type of warfare. British submarines based in British Ceylon operated against Japanese shipping.

It was only after the war in Europe was clearly coming to an end that large British forces were dispatched to the Indian Ocean again. Following the neutralisation of the German fleet in late 1943 and early 1944, forces from the Home Fleet were released, and the success of Operation Overlord in June meant even more craft could be sent, including precious amphibious assault shipping.

During late 1944, as more British aircraft carriers came into the area a series of strikes were flown against oil targets in Sumatra, such as Operation Meridian. was lent for the first attack by the United States. The oil installations were heavily damaged by the attacks, aggravating the Japanese fuel shortages due to the American blockade. The final attack was flown as the carriers were heading for Sydney to become the British Pacific Fleet.

After the departure of the main battle forces the Indian Ocean was left with escort carriers and older battleships as the mainstay of its naval forces. Nevertheless, during those months important operations were launched in the recapture of Burma, including landings on Ramree and Akyab and near Rangoon.

==Command structures==

===Allied command structure===
At the start of the war the British forces in the area fell under at least three separate commands. General Sir Archibald Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief, India, directed the British and Indian Armies in India and Burma. Vice Admiral Sir Ralph Leatham, the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, directed the Royal Navy&#x27;s East Indies Station and the Royal Indian Navy. In November 1940 the Far East Command was established under Air Chief Marshal Robert Brooke-Popham based in Singapore. From 23 December 1941, Far East Command was commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Royds Pownall. Far East Command was responsible for Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore and other British Far East possessions, and took over responsibility for Burma. It was responsible for military and air, but not naval, forces.

A month after the outbreak of war with Japan on 7 December 1941, the Allied governments jointly appointed General Wavell as Supreme Allied Commander of all &quot;American-British-Dutch-Australian&quot; (ABDA) forces in South East Asia and the Pacific, from Burma to the Dutch East Indies.

However, advances made by the Japanese over the next month split the ABDA forces in two. On 23 February 1942, with Malaya lost and the Allied position in Java and Sumatra precarious, ABDACOM was closed down and its headquarters in Java evacuated. Wavell returned to India to resume his position as C-in-C India where his responsibilities now included the defence of Burma. Burma (Burma Command and RAF forces there) had been included in Far East Command; reverted to direction by India; transferred to ABDA, but with India remaining responsible for administration; and then finally reverted back to command from India. 

Dutch resistance to the Japanese in Java ceased on 8-9 March 1942. On 30 March 1942, the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington divided the Pacific theatre into three areas: the Pacific Ocean Areas (POA), under Admiral Chester Nimitz; the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA), under MacArthur as Supreme Allied Commander South West Pacific; and the Southeast Pacific Area. McArthur took up his Supreme Commander&#x27;s post on 18 April. SWPA was given responsibility for the Philippines, Java, Borneo, and all the water areas of the South China Sea. 

Malaya, French Indochina, and Thailand remained a British responsibility and operations were to be directed from India. General Wavell was made Viceroy of India and General Claude Auchinleck became Commander-in-Chief, India, on 20 June 1943. 

In August 1943 the Allies formed a new South East Asian Command to take over strategic responsibilities for the theatre. The reorganisation of the theatre command took about two months. On 4 October Winston Churchill appointed Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten supreme Allied commander of the South East Asia Command (SEAC). The American General Joseph Stilwell was the first deputy supreme Allied commander. On 15 November, Auchinleck handed over responsibility for the conduct of operations against the Japanese in the theatre to Mountbatten.

The initial land forces operational area for SEAC included India, Burma, British Ceylon and Malaya. Operations were also mounted in Japanese-occupied Sumatra, Thailand and French Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos).

Initially SEAC commanded:
* British Eastern Fleet (based in Ceylon)
* British 11th Army Group (Commonwealth land forces; HQ in New Delhi). Directed British Fourteenth Army; British Army in Ceylon (Ceylon Army); and theoretically, Northern Combat Area Command under the command of Joseph Stilwell.
* Air HQ India (New Delhi)
* China Burma India Theater (CBI), (all US forces in theatre; HQ in New Delhi).

In October 1944, CBI was split into US Forces China Theater (USFCT) and India-Burma Theater (USFIBT).

On 12 November 1944 Eleventh Army Group was redesignated by Allied Land Forces South East Asia (ALFSEA) still under SEAC, as it was felt that an inter-Allied command was better than the purely British headquarters. Command problems with General Stilwell and his interactions with the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff had precipitated the change. It combined Commonwealth and US forces, with its headquarters at Kandy. On 1 December ALFSEA HQ moved to Barrackpore, India.

On 15 August 1945 responsibility for the rest of the Dutch East Indies was transferred from the South West Pacific Area to SEAC.

SEAC was disbanded on 30 November 1946.

===Japanese command structure===
The Imperial Japanese Army Unit controlling all army land and air units in South East Asia and the South West Pacific was the Southern Expeditionary Army headquartered in Saigon, Indochina. It was commanded by General Count Hisaichi Terauchi, who commanded it from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese also deployed the South Seas Force, a combined force of Army and Special Naval Landing Force personnel. The Southern Army&#x27;s major field commands were the 14th Army, the 15th Army, the 16th Army and the 25th Army. These consisted of 11 infantry divisions, six independent infantry brigades, and six tank regiments, plus artillery and support troops. The Japanese extensively used bicycle infantry, which allowed them quick movement over vast distances.

<text>Richard Brothers (25 December 1757 – 25 January 1824) was an early believer and teacher of British Israelism, a theory concerning the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel.

==Biography==

===Life===
Brothers was born in Port Kirwan, Newfoundland (earlier known as Admiral&#x27;s Cove).
He was educated in Woolwich, England. He entered the Royal Navy and served under Keppel and Rodney. In 1783, he became lieutenant, and was honourably discharged on 28 July 1783, receiving a pension which amounted to half-pay (54 pounds per year). He then travelled on the continent of Europe and later married Elizabeth Hassall in 1786. His marriage was reported as being &quot;unhappy&quot; and so he returned to service in the Royal Navy.

Because he came to believe that military service was not compatible with deeply held beliefs rooted in Christianity, in 1789 he once again left the Navy. Built upon the principle of individual revelation, Brothers believed that he could not serve the King as head of the Church of England.

In 1791, he began to question the oath he had been required to take for receipt of his military half-pay, and he found himself with little income as a result of his subsequent actions. Brothers then divided his time between the open air and the workhouse, where he developed the idea that he had a special divine commission. Brothers claimed to hear the voice of an attending angel which proclaimed to him the fall of Babylon the Great, which was in fact London. Apparently upon Brothers&#x27;s plea for mercy, God decided to spare London for a time and the destruction was halted. Around this time, Brothers was also expectant of a heavenly lady who would descend from the clouds showering him with money, love and happiness. In February 1792 Brothers declared himself a healer and claimed he could restore sight to the blind. He drew large crowds, but not due to his healing ability as much as his small gifts of money to those he prayed for.

===Works===
In 1793 Brothers declared himself to be the apostle of a new religion. He began to see himself as possessing a special role in the gathering of the Jews back into Palestine, in particular, the &quot;Jews&quot; who were hidden amongst the population of Great Britain. In similarity to modern British Israelists, Brothers asserted that the &quot;hidden Israel&quot; had no notion of its biological lineage and that part of his role would be to teach them of their true identity and lead them to the land of Canaan. Brothers proclaimed himself to be &quot;Prince of the Hebrews&quot;, literal descendant of the Biblical House of David, and the &quot;Nephew of the Almighty&quot;, who would rule over Israel until the return of Jesus Christ. Brothers declared he would achieve all this using a rod he had fashioned from a wild rosebush, with which he would perform miracles, as Moses had done.

All this was declared in the first British Israelist publication in 1794:

&quot;A REVEALED KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROPHECIES AND TIMES, Book the First, wrote [sic] under the direction of the LORD GOD and published by His Sacred Command, it being the first sign of Warning for the benefit of All Nations; Containing with other great and remarkable things not revealed to any other Person on Earth, the Restoration of the Hebrews to Jerusalem by the year of 1798 under their revealed Prince and Prophet (i.e., Richard Brothers). London, Printed in the year of Christ 1794.&quot;

Brothers began to attract quite a following, but due to his rejection of organisational work, and eccentric nature, he did not develop any sort of social movement. In consequence of prophesying the death of the King and the end of the monarchy, he was arrested for treason in 1795, and imprisoned on the grounds of being criminally insane. His case was, however, brought before Parliament by his ardent disciple, Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, an orientalist and a member of the House of Commons. As a result Brothers was removed to a private asylum in Islington.

While he was in the private asylum Brothers wrote a variety of prophetic pamphlets which gained him many believers. Amongst his supporters was William Sharp, the engraver. Some of his political predictions (such as the violent death of Louis XVI) seemed to be proof that he was inspired. But when Brothers predicted that, on 19 November 1795 he would be revealed as &quot;Prince of the Hebrews&quot; and &quot;Ruler of the world&quot;, and the date passed without any such manifestation, Sharp deserted him to become a religious follower of Joanna Southcott. His followers tended to drift away either disillusioned or embarrassed.

===Death===
Brothers spent the last 30 years of his life designing the flags, uniforms, and palaces of the New Jerusalem. John Finlayson finally secured his release from the private asylum in 1806, and Brothers moved into his London home, where he died a lonely figure on 25 January 1824. Finlayson then began a financial campaign against the Government, seeking payment of an enormous claim for his maintenance of Richard Brothers prior to his death.

<text>Norby is a fictional robot created by Janet Asimov and Isaac Asimov who stars in his own series of children&#x27;s science fiction books, &quot;The Norby Chronicles&quot;. His first appearance was in the 1983 book &quot;Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot&quot;, in total he appeared in 11 novels in the &#x27;Norby&#x27; series. According to Isaac Asimov, although Janet Asimov did 90% of the work, his &quot;name was wanted on the book for the betterment of sales [and he] went over the manuscript and polished it a bit.&quot;

===Collections===
The &#x27;Norby&#x27; novels were combined into collections (each with a new cover image and title) by Ace Books:
*&quot;The Norby Chronicles&quot; (featuring &#x27;Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot&#x27;, and &#x27;Norby&#x27;s Other Secret&#x27;.)
*&quot;Norby: Robot for Hire&quot; (featuring &#x27;Norby and the Lost Princess&#x27;, and &#x27;Norby and the Invaders&#x27;.)
*&quot;Norby Through Time and Space&quot; (featuring &#x27;Norby and the Queen&#x27;s Necklace&#x27;, and &#x27;Norby Finds a Villain&#x27;.)

== Origin, appearance, and abilities ==
Norby was originally a robot named the Searcher, created by the robot Mentor First on the planet Jamya. When the Mentor&#x27;s robots were in danger of deactivation due to exhausting their fuel, the Searcher was deployed in order to find a promised refueling ship sent by the Others, the creators of the Mentors. The small robot succeeded in locating the ship, but before he could warp it back to Jamya, it crashed in Earth&#x27;s asteroid belt. The impact of the crash also rendered the Searcher immobile, until the ship was discovered many years later by a salvager and inventor named McGillicuddy. McGillicuddy was a robot maker himself, albeit his were of cruder design than the Mentor&#x27;s. One of his damaged robots was created from a tubby barrel that originally contained Norb&#x27;s Nails, later becoming the basis for Norby&#x27;s name. McGillicuddy used the Searcher&#x27;s parts to repair his damaged robot. Norby eventually fell into the possession of a used-robot shop where he was sold to Jefferson Wells, a space cadet looking for a teaching robot.

Norby&#x27;s body reflects his outer origins as a barrel, while his arms are retractable and have double-sided palms (and two thumbs). His head is round with four eyes, two on each side, and the top is a dome which he can retract into his barrel. His feet are also extendable/retractable. Norby has a tenor voice but can communicate through telepathy by touch.

Norby is equipped with a miniature anti-gravity device allowing him to float. He also possesses the ability to travel through hyperspace, although his navigating abilities are sometimes unreliable. He also has the capability to travel through time via hyperspace. Norby&#x27;s many features make him a target for scientists, the army, and the rogue Inventor&#x27;s Guild who wish to disassemble and study him.

== Heroic feats ==
In the first Norby book, &quot;Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot&quot;, Norby and his owner Jefferson Wells stop the villain Ing the Ingrate from taking over the Solar System.

In the second book, &quot;Norby&#x27;s Other Secret&quot;, Norby and Jeff travel to the planet Jamya to restore the mental health of Norby&#x27;s creator, Mentor First. Along the way they learn about the Others, a race that bio-engineered the intelligent Jamyn dragons.

The third book, &quot;Norby and the Lost Princess,&quot; introduces the planet Izz and its displaced human settlers. While Norby and company prepare for a singing contest, they go to Izz where they find out that Princess Rinda has taken the only Izzian hyperspace ship to Melodia. Norby, Jeff, Fargo, Yobo, and Albany go to the planet on a rescue mission only to be imprisoned by the native insect life.

The fourth book, &quot;Norby and the Invaders&quot;, pits Norby and Jeff against a race of balloon-shaped aliens nicknamed the Invaders. The Invaders kidnap the Grand Dragon at the novel&#x27;s outset and place her in an underwater zoo on their homeworld. An intelligent vine named the Dookoza attempts to thwart a rescue mission by Jeff and Norby, but they end up freeing the Grand Dragon and leaving the Dookoza on the planet Melodia.

The fifth book, &quot;Norby and the Queen&#x27;s Necklace&quot; sends Norby and Jeff to the French Revolution using the Queen&#x27;s Necklace, a time travel device that also involved Marie Antoinette in a scandal. After escaping the Bastille, Norby and Jeff take a Frenchman named Marcel on a wild romp through time as they attempt try to find the origin of the device. Jeff meets a council of the Others in this book.

The sixth book, &quot;Norby Finds a Villain&quot; introduces the character of Threezey the Clown, the alter ego of Ing. In this book, Ing/Threezey kidnaps Pera at a magic show and tries to use her to create a superbomb that will leave him as the only thing left in the universe. He instead opens a portal to another reality where the tree-like Master Cult (MC) rule, and accidentally bring them to the Solar System where they proceed to conquer Earth.

In the seventh book, &quot;Norby Down to Earth&quot;, Norby learns about his origins as well as the fate of the spacer McGillicuddy, who converted him to his current form.

The eighth book, &quot;Norby and Yobo&#x27;s Great Adventure&quot;, finds Norby and Jeff stranded in ancient Africa with Admiral Yobo.

The ninth book, &quot;Norby and the Oldest Dragon&quot;, takes place almost entirely on the planet Jamya, which is being menaced by an attack from an intelligent cloud. The dragon in the title refers to the Dowager Dragon, mother of the Grand Dragon (the current ruler of Jamya).

The tenth book, &quot;Norby and the Court Jester&quot;, is set once more on the planet Izz and brings back the villain Ing for a third appearance.

The final book in the series, &quot;Norby and the Terrified Taxi&quot;, centers around Lizzie, an intelligent taxi first introduced in &quot;Norby Down to Earth&quot;. They must find and stop &quot;Garc the Great&quot; who wants to change history.

== Recurring characters ==
*Jefferson &quot;Jeff&quot; Wells: A 14-year-old cadet in the Space Academy, Jeff is Norby&#x27;s &quot;owner&quot; and partner. Jeff originally purchases Norby, with the help of a loan from Admiral Yobo, to learn Martian Swahili for a class (Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot). His brother Fargo serves as his guardian, as their parents died when Jeff was only 10.
*Farley Gordon &quot;Fargo&quot; Wells: a secret agent for Admiral Boris Yobo of Space Command. Handsome, charming, musical, and a bit arrogant, he dates Albany Jones in the first book, and married her in later novels. Fargo is ten years older than Jeff and serves as his guardian.
*Admiral Boris Yobo: Jeff&#x27;s commanding officer and Fargo&#x27;s boss, Yobo has a big appetite for adventure and a larger one for food. Yobo originally gave Jeff the money to buy Norby from a used robot shop. Due to his high rank in Space Command, Yobo tends to become a quasi-liaison to whatever world Norby takes him.
*Albany Jones: A police officer and daughter of the Mayor of Manhattan. She fought Ing with the help of other police officers in the first novel and eventually marries Fargo.
*Zargl: A dragon from Jamya, Zargl is the great-niece of the Grand Dragon. Zargl, along with her mother Zi, are the very first dragons Jeff and Norby meet on their first trip to Jamya (Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot). Zargl has joined Jeff and Norby and some of their adventures outside of Jamya as well (particularly in Norby and the Lost Princess).
*Mentor First: An ancient Jamyn robot with three eyes and four arms, Mentor First constructed Norby as a way to contact his creators, the &quot;Others,&quot; for supplies (Norby&#x27;s Other Secret). Mentor First went insane for a long time, out of loneliness, worry, and lack of the ability to refuel, but eventually returned to full health thanks to Norby and Jeff. Norby refers to Mentor First as &quot;Father.&quot;
*Rembrandt: A four armed, three eyed &quot;Other&quot; living in present time (Norby and Jeff have also met Others in the past and future), Rembrandt studies and creates visual art. He lives on a museum ship run by the computer Y.I.B., which stands for Your Immense Brain, a nickname Norby gave her. Jeff calls him Rembrandt, after the famed Renaissance artist, as his real name is unpronounceable to humans (Norby Finds a Villain).
*Rinda: The 11-year-old Crown Princess of Izz (a planet colonized by humans taken from Earth by the Others). Rinda used her royal influence to board Izz&#x27;s first hyperspace ship and accidentally hit a button which took it to a planet she termed Melodia. The music-loving alien inhabitants of this planet fed Rinda to a sacred tree; she became part of the tree for a while but was later restored to her human self (Norby and the Lost Princess). She has a crush on Jeff.
*Pera: A robot similar to Norby, Pera was initially created by the Others to monitor the formation of the planet Melodia (Norby and the Lost Princess). Though Pera was intended to be crushed as Melodia formed, Norby and Jeff attempted to rescue her by taking her into hyperspace (due to an electronic field around the planet, Pera instead held onto her recording device as it went into hyperspace, saving Norby and Jeff instead). Pera stayed with Rinda on Izz as a companion. When she was kidnapped by Threezy/Ing, she opened an inter-dimensional portal allowing the Master Cult to take over the universe (Norby Finds a Villain). Pera is extremely observant and must always tell the truth.
*The Grand Dragon: The ruler of Jamya, the Grand Dragon is large, regal and loves nothing more to be praised.
*Lizzie: A floating, talking, and thinking taxicab who takes Norby and friends around Manhattan (Norby Down to Earth; Norby and the Terrified Taxi). Her circuits were adjusted by McGillicuddy, so she shares some origins with Norby.
*Oola: Jeff&#x27;s all-purpose pet (Norby&#x27;s Other Secret). She is green and normally looks like a cat but has the ability to shape-shift to fit the desires of those near her. Her species was bio-engineered by Mentor First. Oola is vegetarian.
*Ing/Threezy: The first villain of the series, Ing tries to take control of the Solar System with his band of Ingrates in Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot. After Norby stops his initial attempt, he later resurfaces as Threezy the Clown, intent on setting off a bomb in hyperspace and destroying the universe (Norby Finds a Villain). He ends up as Court Jester on the planet Izz (Norby and the Court Jester).

==Miscellany==
It has been speculated that Norby was named by his authors after Norbert Wiener, the &quot;Father of Cybernetics&quot;.

Note that in &quot;Norby and the Lost Princess&quot;, King Fizzwell talks about a Spacecraft Challenger Disaster, more than one year before the real disaster occurred.

==Comics==
The Norby Chronicles were made into serialization comics for the Scouting magazine Boys&#x27; Life in the 1990s. The comics were adapted from the first and second books in the series. The first was &quot;Norby the Mixed-Up Robot&quot; running for 18 chapters, from January 1990, to July 1991. The second series &quot;Norby&#x27;s Other Secret&quot; ran from January 1993, to December 1995 and was presented in 32 chapters.

<text>William Sharp (29 January 174925 July 1824), was a British engraver and artist.

==Life and work==
Sharp was the son of a reputable gunsmith who lived at Haydon&#x27;s Yard, Minories in central London. He was apprenticed to the &#x27;bright-cut&#x27; engraver and genealogist, Barak Longmate (1738–93), and after marriage to a Frenchwoman, set himself up as a writing engraver in Bartholomew Lane (off Threadneedle Street).

His first notable work was an engraving of &quot;Hector&quot;, an old lion at the Tower of London. Around 1782, he sold the shop and moved to Vauxhall, intending to specialise in the higher branches (i.e. engraving for printing) of the engraver&#x27;s art. Among his earlier plates are some illustrations, after Stothard, for the &quot;Novelists&#x27; Magazine&quot;. He also completed the plate of Benjamin West&#x27;s &quot;Landing of Charles II&quot; which William Woollett had left unfinished at the time of his death, engraved some of the illustrations by artists who travelled with Captain Cook on his famous voyages, and J. H. Benwell&#x27;s &quot;Children in the Wood&quot;. He finally settled at Chiswick where he remained for the rest of his life.

He engraved the &quot;Doctors Disputing on the Immaculateness of the Virgin&quot; and &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; (after Guido Reni); &quot;King Lear in the Storm&quot; and &quot;The Witch of Endor&quot; (after Benjamin West); &quot;The sortie from Gibraltar&quot; (after John Trumbull); the portrait of John Hunter and &quot;The Holy Family&quot; (after Joshua Reynolds); &quot;St Cecilia&quot; (after Domenichino) and &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; (after Dolci).

Sharp&#x27;s style of engraving was original, the half-tints rich and full. He became an honorary member of the Imperial Academy in Vienna and the Royal Academy in Munich.

Sharp&#x27;s portrait was painted by George Francis Joseph (1764–1846) and engraved by Sharp himself, and a 3/4-length portrait was painted by James Lonsdale (illustrated). James Thomson (1788–1850) engraved another portrait.

Sharp died in Chiswick on 25 July 1824, and was buried in the parish churchyard there.

==Politics and religion==
Sharpe was a republican and a friend of Thomas Paine and Horne Tooke, and became a member of the Society for Constitutional Information. As a result of a legal dispute involving Horne Tooke, Sharp was questioned by the Privy Council on charges relating to treason, but was eventually dismissed without punishment as merely an &quot;enthusiast&quot;.

He became a convert to the teachings of Mesmer and Swedenborg and came under the religious influence of would-be visionary Jacob Bryan (who worked for Sharp as a printer for a time), and millennialist prophet Richard Brothers, engraving the latter as &quot;Prince of the Hebrews&quot;. After Brothers&#x27; incarceration in an insane asylum in Islington, Sharp became an adherent of prophetess Joanna Southcott, whom he brought from Exeter to London and kept at his own expense for a considerable time; he made a portrait drawing of her which he engraved. Despite her apparently premature death, he never lost faith in her divine mission or the possibility that she would reappear, and wrote a book in her defence: &quot;An answer to the world etc.&quot; (London, 1806).

<doc id="902077" wikidata="Q1478338" url="?curid=902077" title="Association football culture">
<text>Association football culture, or football culture, refers to the cultural aspects surrounding the game of association football. As the sport is global, the culture of the game is diverse, with varying degrees of overlap and distinctiveness in each country. In many countries, football has ingrained itself into the national culture, and parts of life may revolve around it. Many countries have daily football newspapers, as well as football magazines. Football players, especially in the top levels of the game, have become role models.

Football has 160 years of history. The rules were first written in England in 1863, and since then a vast and diverse culture has emerged. The culture of football can be easily divided into how the players, fans and clubs see the sport. Held every four years, the FIFA World Cup is a &quot;month long festival of football&quot;, with &quot;The Independent&quot; adding &quot;its extreme popularity across the expanse of the globe giving it a uniquely universal audience&quot;.

==Fans==
=== Accessories ===

The wearing of football kits has been a significant part of football fan culture since the 1973–74 season, when Leeds United&#x27;s replica kit, made by Admiral, was sold to football fans for the first time. By the late 1990s, this had become a common part of global fan culture. A similar series of events saw scarves become a prominent accessory; having been first introduced in the 1930s, they became much more prominent in England in the 1960s and 70s. These accessories replaced more traditional fan accessories, such as rosettes and rattles.

===Fair Play===
Fair Play is the name of a FIFA programme which aims to increase sportsmanship as well as prevent discrimination in the game of football. This also involves programmes to reduce racism in the game. The programme extends to outside of football, in trying to support charities and other organisations which improve conditions around the world. The principles of the Fair Play programme can be summarised as follows:

# Play fair (no diving)
# Play to win but accept defeat with dignity
# Observe the laws of the game
# Respect opponents, teammates, referees, officials and spectators
# Promote the interests of football
# Honour those who defend football&#x27;s good reputation
# Reject corruption, drugs, racism, sexism, violence, gambling and other dangers to our sport
# Help others to resist corrupting pressures
# Denounce those who attempt to discredit the sport
# Use football to make a better world

Both FIFA and UEFA have awards which they hand out to individuals or groups of people who have promoted what they see as the spirit of &quot;Fair Play&quot;, both within and outside of football. An example of this was the Italian player Paolo Di Canio who, while not given an award, was congratulated by many sections of the football world for a generous display of &quot;Fair Play&quot;. Despite having a goal-scoring opportunity while playing for West Ham United against Everton, when Di Canio saw the Everton goalkeeper had incurred an injury, instead of scoring what would have been the easiest goal of his career, he caught the crossed ball with his hands, causing the referee to call a foul for handball. The referee stopped play and allowed the goalkeeper to receive treatment for the cuts and bruises to his face. The referee smiled and did not issue a red card, which he should have done according to the laws of the game. When the referee noticed he was being shown close-up on the scoreboard screen, he pointed at his smile and began blowing loudly on his whistle.

===Food and beverages===
In the United Kingdom, attendance at football matches is associated with the consumption of traditional football foods such as meat pies and Bovril. Food and beverage sales in stadiums can raise high incomes for clubs, and some clubs make attempts to improve their service and diversify out of traditional foods. In Brazil, &quot;sanduíche de calabresa&quot; (pepperoni sandwich) is a popular meal in the surrounding areas of stadiums. In Mineirão stadium, &quot;feijão tropeiro&quot;, a typical dish from Minas Gerais, is very common. In Germany, many football fans eat bratwurst and drink beers. In Argentina, &quot;choripán&quot; (a sandwich with grilled chorizo with crusty bread) and grilled hamburgers are commonly served in stadiums. In the past, a variety of pizza without cheese was served, which is now known as &quot;pizza de cancha&quot; (&quot;pitch pizza&quot;). In Spain and Bulgaria, it is very common to eat sunflower seeds during the match. Although not in the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but especially in Sarajevo, &quot;ćevapi&quot; are commonly seen to be sold around the stadiums before and after the matches, and people can often be seen selling &quot;pepita&quot; and juices in front of the entrance of the stadium and on the stands during the match.

In many countries with drinking culture, football has been associated with alcohol consumption. This can be before, during and after the match, with drinking occurring inside the stadium, sometimes illicitly, as well as in pubs and bars outside. However, unwanted behaviour caused by drinking has led to the banning of the sale of alcohol to general supporters in stadiums across the UK, although most English and Welsh sides continue to sell alcohol within general stadium areas, with only clubs in Scotland being subject to a blanket ban following rioting after the 1980 Scottish Cup Final. Sales of alcohol still occur in executive lounges. Some teams and countries have Supporters Clubs which have friendly drinking reputations. However, some countries are more associated with drunken hooliganism as mentioned in the violence section below. More recently research has cast doubt on the effectiveness of alcohol restrictions on reducing the likelihood of disorder and violence, particularly involving English football fans such as the Heysel Stadium disaster.

===Hooliganism===

The level of passion with which football teams are supported has from time to time caused problems, and clashes between fans can result in violence. Some violence occurs by people aiming to cause trouble, a phenomenon known as hooliganism. Other fans group together in hooligan firms, which are organised gangs that seek fights with other firms supporting rival clubs. Both are sometimes known as the &quot;English Disease,&quot; after the disorder caused by English fans travelling abroad to support either their club or national team in the 1970s and 1980s. However, violent organised supporters&#x27; groups surrounding football have been prevalent in other countries, most notably &quot;barras bravas&quot; that emerged in Argentina in the 1950s, some years before the appearance of significant hooligan firms in England. In addition, &quot;ultras&quot;, originally emerging in Italy in the 1960s, and in parts of Europe, Asia, Australia and North Africa, and &quot;torcidas organizadas&quot; in Brazil (emerged as non-violent groups during the 1930s but became violent ones in the 1970s) have become significant.

Violence by fans has ranged from small fights between fans to tragedies such as the Heysel Stadium disaster and also the Football War. There have been incidents of fans being murdered, such as the killings of Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight, two Leeds United supporters, in Istanbul in 2000 on the eve of the UEFA Cup Semi-Final first leg. In recent years this aspect of the game seems to have passed its peak in England though it has by no means disappeared completely. Specialist police units and information-sharing between regional and international police forces has made it much harder for the hooligans to organise and participate in disorder. CCTV inside and outside stadiums and also at other anticipated &quot;flash points&quot; such as city centres and railway stations now makes it more likely that people involved in disorder can be identified later even if they are not arrested at the scene. However, there are still disruptions surrounding football matches. One example being the UEFA Champions League matches which were played on 12 and 13 April 2005.

Violence by fans has also affected players, including professional athletes, but this is rare. One example includes a message to Christian Vieri, apparently by an Inter Milan fan, which threatened to burn down his restaurant, criticising his attitude towards the team. There is also the notorious incident where the Colombian international player Andrés Escobar was murdered shortly after returning home from the 1994 World Cup. This was reputedly for scoring the own goal which eliminated Colombia from the competition.

Before the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 26 Seaburn Casuals (a Sunderland A.F.C. supporters firm) hooligans were arrested in a police raid after a military-issue smoke bomb was let out at a local pub after a fight with bouncers. By the end of the operation, over 60 were facing charges. Some of the Seaburn Casuals hooligans picked up in the raid were also involved with neo-Nazi groups like Combat 18. The operation failed when judge ruled CCTV footage from the pub inadmissible.

In March 2000, the Seaburn Casuals fought with hooligans from the Newcastle Gremlins in a pre-arranged clash near the North Shields Ferry terminal, in what was described as &quot;some of the worst football related fighting ever witnessed in the United Kingdom&quot;. The leaders of the Gremlins and Casuals were both jailed for four years for conspiracy, with 28 others jailed for various terms, based on evidence gained after police examined the messages sent by mobile phone between the gang members on the day.

There have been a number of accidents and disasters in the history of football. Some of these, such as the Hillsborough and Ibrox disasters, were due to problems with crowd control. The Heysel Stadium disaster was a combination of hooliganism and poor crowd control. The Bradford City stadium fire was due to poor fire safety in the stadium. Lessons learned from these disasters have led to safer football stadiums and gradual bans on smoking.

===Matchday programme===
Matchday programme are sold inside and outside stadiums before, and sometimes during, matches. In their most simple form, they provide basic information on the teams, players, and match officials. Larger clubs usually produce multiple-page programmes with features such as comments from the manager and club captain, interviews with players, ex-players and backroom staff, information about ticketing arrangements for forthcoming matches, a detailed fixture list and review of the team&#x27;s season so far, competitions, pages for junior fans, and a detailed feature on the opposition. Programmes from some matches are collectible items, and can fetch money at an auction.
===Pitch invasions===

Pitch invasions happen when supporters move from the stands onto the football pitch, some times to deliberately disrupt a match. This is distinguished from times when, due to safety reasons, fans are let onto the pitch.

Examples of pitch invasions include the 1923 &quot;White Horse&quot; FA Cup final between Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United at Wembley Stadium. Due to the overwhelming numbers in the stadium, the police had to bring order back to the stadium. Another example is the 1977 British Home Championship match between England and Scotland, again at Wembley. After Scotland won 2–1, the &quot;Tartan Army&quot; invaded the pitch and managed to break down the goalposts, as well as cutting up the turf to take.

In addition, there are better natured pitch invasions, typically at the end of games that involve success for one of the teams. This commonly occurs after a team wins a championship, survives relegation or achieves an upset, typically in a cup competition.

Solo invasions are more common although few in number. In some cases, these are streakers who try to invade the pitch while nude. Supporters tend to view this as harmless fun. One such pitch invasion was at UEFA Euro 2004, in the final between Portugal and Greece, when &quot;Jimmy Jump&quot; ran onto the pitch to disrupt the match. Another well known invasion was carried out by Karl Power, who sneaked into Manchester United&#x27;s team photograph before their UEFA Champions League match with Bayern Munich. His other stunts have involved the England national rugby union team and the British Grand Prix.
===Rivalries===
Derby matches, which are matches between two neighbouring rival clubs, are often fiercely competitive. Sometimes there are underlying political or sectarian tensions. The term often applies to matches between two teams from the same city or region, but it is sometimes used to refer to matches between big clubs from the same country. Derbies are usually treated as the most important matches by the fans, players and clubs, regardless of position in the league table, et cetera.

The film &quot;Green Street&quot; embodies the spirit of derbies when one of the characters refers to the West Ham United–Millwall rivalry as that of Israel against Palestine. Of course this film does focus on the mostly past era of hooliganism, however its depiction of matchday passion shows just how important derby day is to fans. When it comes to derbies, the culture of football thrives and shines in all its colours. &quot;How Soccer Explains the World&quot; is a perfect source into how derbies emerged and what they mean to the community.

===Supporter groups===

There are many types of sub-cultures and types of groups centred around football. Casuals are interlinked with hooligan firms. Ultras are a primarily continental European phenomenon (emerging later in Asia, Australia and North Africa), while in South America, the &quot;barra bravas&quot; (oldest violent organised supporters&#x27; groups, emerged in the 1950s in Argentina) are common, with the exception of Brazil, where &quot;torcidas organizadas&quot; are more prevalent.

==Players==

===Celebrities===

Such is the popularity of football that some players become better known for their &#x27;off-the-pitch&#x27; activities. The celebrity status is such that advertisers and sports goods manufacturers hire them to sponsor their products. The Brazilian footballer Pelé is such a player. He was so admired as a player during his time that he went on to become a UNICEF ambassador, as well as being a spokesman in advertisements for many different companies. He also spent some time in politics in Brazil. Brazilian striker Ronaldo was chosen as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme in 2000 as he had the highest global appeal among sportspeople.

Former FIFA World Player of the Year and African Footballer of the Year George Weah secured most votes in the first round of the 2005 Liberian presidential election, but was defeated in the run-off ballot. He was elected President 12 years later.
Another football celebrity is the English footballer David Beckham. He has been perceived as a trend-setter in England due to a history of frequent hairstyle changes. He is also married to the former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, and his relationship difficulties were widely reported in the UK press in 2004 and 2005. Statues have been made of him, notably at a Buddhist temple as well as made out of chocolate. Beckham was for a long time an Armani model, famous for his underwear advertisements.

In late 2009, Beckham was replaced by Cristiano Ronaldo as Armani&#x27;s primary footballer/model. Nine of the top ten most followed sportspeople on Facebook are footballers, including the top six, Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, Beckham, Neymar, Ronaldinho and Kaká, with Cristiano also the most followed person. Cristiano, Messi and Neymar are the three most followed sportspeople on Instagram, and all 3 in the top 12 most followed people.

Many other players have also become celebrities and are treated as heroes by the fans. Retired players, such as Gary Lineker, have become celebrities in their own right by working on television or radio. Even non-footballers who are connected to football have become famous through their association alone. For instance, after the 2002 World Cup, the head of the Korea Football Association decided to run for president of South Korea.

===Goal celebration===
In football, a goal celebration is the practice of celebrating the scoring of a goal. The celebration is normally performed by the goalscorer, and may involve his or her teammates, the manager or coaching staff and/or the supporters of the team. Whilst referring to the celebration of a goal in general, the term can also be applied to specific actions, such as a player removing his shirt or performing a somersault. Many unique goal celebrations have been immortalized, such as in a statue (Thierry Henry), advertisements (Ronaldo), postage stamps (Pelé), magazine covers, or in video games: Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Lionel Messi among many others are featured in the &quot;FIFA&quot; series.

===Deaths===
There have been deaths of players on the pitch and dugouts. On 5 September 1931, Celtic goalkeeper John Thomson suffered a skull fracture when he collided with Rangers player Sam English during an Old Firm match. He was fatally injured and died later that day. On 10 September 1985, Scotland manager Jock Stein died of a heart attack as his team scored the equaliser against Wales which virtually secured qualification for the 1986 World Cup finals. He was aged 62.

In 2003, Cameroon international player Marc-Vivien Foé collapsed during a FIFA Confederations Cup match against Colombia and was pronounced dead later that day. His death was attributed to previously undiagnosed heart problems. On 8 September 1990, York City&#x27;s David Longhurst collapsed and died on the pitch during his team&#x27;s match with Lincoln City. The match was abandoned and York City paid tribute to the player later by naming a stand in his honour at their Bootham Crescent ground. In 2004, the Hungarian international Miklós Fehér died from a heart attack while playing for Benfica against Vitória de Guimarães. On 9 September 2006, Hinckley United player Matt Gadsby collapsed on the pitch and died during a Conference North match against Harrogate Town. Medical tests revealed he died from a heart condition known as Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy. On 25 August 2007, Sevilla player Antonio Puerta suffered a heart attack during Sevilla&#x27;s first match of the season – against Getafe – while running back towards his own goal. Sevilla teammate Ivica Dragutinović and Sevilla medical staff subsequently rushed to his aid. He was admitted to hospital but died on 28 August, aged 22. Several players have also been struck by lightning while playing during sudden storms.
On 29 December 2007, Motherwell captain Phil O&#x27;Donnell suffered from a suspected heart failure on the pitch in a match against Dundee United, as a result of which he died several hours later in hospital. At the end of that season, a tribute match was played in his honour between stars of the Motherwell team which won the Scottish FA Cup in 1991 and the Celtic team which won the League Championship in 1998, both of which O&#x27;Donnell starred for. Motherwell also named the main stand of their stadium in his honour.

Other disasters have occurred away from stadia. Most notably, the Superga air disaster of 1949 in which the entire Torino squad perished. Other examples include the Munich air disaster which involved the 1958 Manchester United squad; the loss of the entire Zambia national team squad in an air crash in 1993; and a plane crash in 2016 that killed 71 passengers, including almost the entire Chapecoense first team squad.

===Ethnicity===
People of different races have sometimes not been accepted as players in European football. This is changing at the start of the 21st century due to society change as well as campaigning on the part of the football authorities in different countries. UEFA and the European Union support the Football Against Racism in Europe (&quot;FARE&quot;) project, which aims to stop racism. Many black players were not accepted initially into European football, even though the earliest black player was in 1881. However, in the 1970s onwards, players were increasingly accepted leading to a situation where many club and national teams have players of varying ethnicities. However, full acceptance in the bigger footballing nations did not occur until the 1990s, and racism still exists at some levels. Samuel Eto&#x27;o, for example, was once racially insulted by some Real Zaragoza fans at a match against Barcelona, and threatened to quit the game if they kept insulting him. The same occurred to then-Messina defender Marc Zoro in a match against Inter Milan.

In some countries, such as England and Germany, there have been strong campaigns to remove racism and intolerance from football on the pitch and on the terraces. In other countries, such as Spain and Italy, little action has been taken despite visible problems.

===Globalization===
For the best players, it means their services can be offered to clubs in a number of different countries and for compensation they have significant bargaining power in setting – the top players can make salaries of millions in a year, in addition to whatever endorsements they receive.

Teams have also benefited from this by being able to find a wider support base outside their traditional local areas. They can also scout for talent from a wider area. However, some European clubs have been accused of exploitation for doing this, as some African youngsters they have recruited for football teams have eventually been left with nothing after the team no longer requires their services. In the modern game, most clubs have multiple foreign players. This is especially evident in the English Premier League, where English players are outnumbered by their foreign counterparts. Some of football&#x27;s leading authorities, including former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, have argued this is detrimental to the game and an issue for supporters. Published academic research on this question (by David Ranc) seems to demonstrate the opposite.
Many teams attempt to build a complete team with players with ball control, others with strength, others with speed and others with vision. Traditionally, these skillsets are associated with different regions: ball control is regarded as a South American trait, speed is typically associated with African players and strength is typically seen as the European way. Therefore, prominent clubs scout these regions heavily for rising talent and advise them to have a trial with the club. Football has become a global sport where spectators from around the world can enjoy many different leagues. It has created international rivalries as well as community rivalries, but at the same time, it has the power to bring communities together. The FIFA World Cup brings the world of football together for an entire month. Through triumph and defeat it is a modern example of nationalism fused with globalisation. In Franklin Foer&#x27;s &quot;How Soccer Explains the World&quot;, he explains that national teams create a tribal sense of nationalism amongst fans. This nationalism is shown in wearing football shirts, scarves and flying flags to express pride. When tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup, the African Cup of Nations and the UEFA European Championship bring in supporters from nations around the world, this national pride is a part of globalism. This complex system is all a part of the global community of football. Football brings players, fans, coaches and clubs together from every part of the world. A prime example of the unifying power of football is the African nation of Ghana. It gained independence from British imperial rule in 1957 and used football to unite the nation. &quot;The Black Stars&quot;, as the national team became known as, hosted the first African Cup of Nations. Ghana has become one of the most passionate footballing nations in both Africa and the world, thanks to the unifying power of the sport.

Coaches are also becoming sought after internationally. This extends to national team coaches, once being native to their country, being brought in from other countries. Examples include Brazilian legend Zico coaching Japan; Sven-Göran Eriksson, a Swede who coached England; as well as Berti Vogts, a German who coached Scotland and Nigeria. Another German, Otto Rehhagel, is practically a national icon in Greece after leading its national team to a shock victory in UEFA Euro 2004, and shortly afterwards turning down an offer to coach Germany and remain coaching Greece. Dutch coach Guus Hiddink has a similar iconic status in South Korea after coaching its national team to the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup, so much so that one of South Korea&#x27;s World Cup stadiums was renamed in his honour shortly after the competition. The two most recent managers of the US women were born outside the country, although both had lived in the US for many years before becoming USWNT head coaches. Jill Ellis, who managed the USWNT to World Cup wins in 2015 and 2019, is a native of England who moved to the US with her family in her early teens, and current manager Vlatko Andonovski moved from North Macedonia to the US as a player in 2000 and has remained in the US ever since as a player and coach.

===Role models===
While many football players can be argued to be good role models, there have been headlines in the news regarding bad behaviour by footballers. Such is the influence of footballers, their activities tend to be reported widely in the media and also bring condemnation from the government of the countries in which they play.

Shortly prior to UEFA Euro 1996, the England national team gained notoriety for the &quot;Dentist&#x27;s Chair&quot; incident. Several English players, including Paul Gascoigne and Teddy Sheringham, were photographed in Hong Kong after being seen in a bar pouring beer down each other&#x27;s throats while the person sat on a dentist&#x27;s chair. Later in his life, Gascoigne struggled with alcohol and drug addiction and had to be hospitalised for overdose on several occasions.

There have been incidents in England of players being accused of violence and misconduct off the pitch. Although on many occasions, players have been found not guilty, such cases are highly controversial. In 2001, two Leeds United players, Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer, appeared in court over the assault of a student outside a nightclub. Woodgate was found guilty of affray. In 2002, three players (two from Chelsea, John Terry and Jody Morris; and one from Wimbledon, Des Byrne) appeared in court on charges of affray. All were acquitted. On 20 May 2008, Joey Barton was sentenced to six months in jail after pleading guilty for his part in an assault in December 2007. Barton was captured on CCTV punching a man 20 times.

In 2004, the Leicester City trio of Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie spent a week in prison after being accused of sexual assault while on a training break at the La Manga resort in Spain with their team. However, the case was dropped after forensic evidence showed the accusations to be baseless. Although the players accused were ultimately innocent, the scandal led to a media outcry about footballers and their behaviour, especially with regard to children who look up to them.

Wayne Rooney was also attacked in the media for alleged visits to prostitutes in 2004, a claim he later admitted was true. Adrian Mutu admitted cocaine use after failing a drugs test, and Graham Stack was charged with rape but cleared in 2005. Lee Bowyer again made headlines in 2005 when he and Newcastle United teammate Kieron Dyer fought each other near the end of a Premier League match.

==Clubs==

Clubs have moved from amateur status to, in some cases, big commercial concerns. Players have also managed to increase their earnings massively during this change.
===Seating===
After the Hillsborough Disaster, the British government commissioned the Taylor Report which resulted in standing being banned from many stadiums, including every top league stadium. Groups such as Stand Up Sit Down are campaigning for its return. This is very different from the situation in British non-league football and other leagues around the world where it is common to see terracing (standing areas) making up some, or even all of the room for fans.

===Corruption===
Allegations of corruption in football have always been present. This level of corruption can vary from country to country, and can involve players, agents and clubs. In 1980, Italian sides Milan and Lazio were relegated to Serie B for match-fixing. The 2005–06 football season saw many corruption scandals. This included the 2005 Bundesliga scandal in Germany, with the refereeing scandals of Robert Hoyzer; and the Brazilian football match-fixing scandal involving Edilson Pereira de Carvalho. This was followed by the 2006 Serie A scandal (&quot;Calciopoli&quot;) in Italy where five clubs were found guilty for interference in the referees work by their leaders and resulted in several top clubs being penalised (most notably, Juventus was relegated to Serie B for the 2006–07 season and lost many top players) and getting their own title stripped off from them and being rewarded to Inter Milan, who were runners-up; and Apito Dourado in Portugal, with Porto and Boavista involved.

===Finance===

In a 1997 address to the Oxford Union, then Tottenham Hotspur chairman Alan Sugar described clubs&#x27; inability to manage the ever-increasing amounts of money in football as the &quot;prune juice effect&quot;; clubs expenditure continually outnumbering the profits coming from sponsorships and prize money.

While most grassroot clubs and lower division league teams struggle to make ends meet, large clubs can make significant revenue. For example, sides such as Manchester United and Real Madrid are considered amongst the richest in the world, with a global support base. Chelsea has also undergone a transformation, purchasing a number of expensive football players after itself being purchased by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.

In 2008, Manchester City became the richest club in the world after being bought-out by Emirati billionaire Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyanan.

The catalyst for this change was the arrival of satellite television. Satellite TV companies paid massive sums for the rights to cover football matches, and in turn have recouped this investment from the many fans who are unable to catch the match in person. This benefits the &quot;hardcore&quot; and &quot;casual&quot; fan as they have more choice of which game they want to watch.

While some clubs do well out of the increased money in football, other clubs can get into trouble trying to keep up. Leeds United attempted to do this by spending a lot of money and were successful for a few seasons. However, the debts became unmanageable, the successful players were sold off and the team were eventually relegated twice, first from the Premier League to the Championship, and then to League One.

Not all clubs do well out of television money. Clubs in lower leagues receive less money for matches and, if promoted to higher leagues, can have trouble matching the spending power of bigger clubs. This leaves them more likely to be relegated again.

Clubs from smaller countries also have problems with this issue. Due to their smaller population base they receive less money from television rights. This means they are comparative paupers compared to clubs from the bigger countries, and can lead to debt problems if they try to match spending in trans-national competitions. Some clubs have managed to buck the trend by training players through their youth academies, as well as making wise investments. Examples of these clubs include Porto and Ajax, although when these teams become successful, as in Porto&#x27;s case winning the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League, the players tend to get sold-off due to financial pressures.

In 2021, Newcastle United became the richest football club in the world after being bought-out by the Saudi Arabian government&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund.

==Women&#x27;s football==
Women have been playing football as long as the game has existed. Early women&#x27;s matches in England during the 1920s drew large crowds until The Football Association banned women from its pitches, and bans elsewhere followed. Their numbers, as both football players and fans, increased with the lifting of bans on women playing football and attending matches. The first official FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup was held in 1991 and drew worldwide television interest. Professionalism and interest surged after the 1999 World Cup in the United States, the 2019 World Cup in France, and the 2021–22 UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League, UEFA Euro 2022, and 2023 Women&#x27;s FA Cup final all set global records in attendance or viewership to women&#x27;s matches.

In North America, the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL), which has played since 2013, features multiple teams that have averaged more than 20,000 attendance per league match over the course of a season and set a record of 32,000 attendance in 2022, and Mexico&#x27;s Liga MX Femenil has drawn more than 50,000 in attendance and 2.8 million television viewers to finals matches. In Europe, leagues such as England&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Super League, Spain&#x27;s Liga F, and France&#x27;s Division 1 Féminine have all broken all-time attendance or television viewership records annually over the last five years, with attendances over 91,000 for Women&#x27;s Champions League matches in 2022 breaking the all-time record for a women&#x27;s match set in 1999. Greater professionalism in the women&#x27;s game has followed this growth, with new or newly professionalized leagues forming in Spain, China, Mexico, Argentina, and Japan — among others — since 2017.

The culture around the women&#x27;s game is as varied globally as the men&#x27;s game, but in different ways. A relative lack of investment in women&#x27;s football has also insulated it from the influence and complications of extreme wealth in the men&#x27;s game. Hooliganism is frowned upon more broadly and addressed with more urgency. In Europe and North America, media coverage of the women&#x27;s game is measurably lacking compared to men&#x27;s football, though shifting toward increased and more positive coverage since the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, and in some markets the women&#x27;s game must combat a perception that it is a lesser product. Some leagues, such as the Scottish Women&#x27;s Football League, rejected sponsorships from alcohol and gambling industries allowed in the men&#x27;s game. Unlike leagues in other nations, most teams in the United States&#x27; NWSL are owned independently of men&#x27;s teams, and all are branded separately from men&#x27;s teams, resulting in less crossover fandom and more distinct fan cultures even within organizations where the club&#x27;s ownership is shared. Fewer women&#x27;s teams in general control or are the primary tenants of their own venues.

The women&#x27;s sport is also considered a more inclusive space for supporters of broader ranges of age, gender, and sexuality than the men&#x27;s game. Players, even at the elite levels of club and national team play, maintain closer and more direct relationships with supporters, often interacting with fans after matches, including taking selfies with and giving autographs to fans.

==Society==

In many countries, football has ingrained itself into the national culture, and many parts of life revolve around it. While incarcerated in Robben Island prison, Nelson Mandela reflected on how playing football &quot;made us feel alive and triumphant despite the situation we found ourselves in&quot;. Many countries have daily football newspapers, as well as football magazines. The mood of regions and countries has been seen to be connected to football, especially during major tournaments where victory can bring happiness to the local community or country. Conversely defeat can lower spirits, and has been seen to be connected to mortality in the population. Withdrawal symptoms when the football season finished have also been reported. The economy can also be seen to be connected to major football tournaments, although the precise association is disputed.

The terms &quot;soccer mom&quot; and &quot;soccer dad&quot;, popularised in the United States, refer broadly to a demographic group of parents with school-age children playing football.

===Visual arts===

Football has not been widely represented in fine art. Sunderland and Aston Villa were the subject of one of the earliest football paintings in the world – possibly the earliest – when in 1895 the artist Thomas M. M. Hemy painted &quot;Sunderland v. Aston Villa 1895&quot; (also titled &quot;A Corner Kick&quot;). This canvas depicts a game between the two most successful English teams of the decade at Sunderland&#x27;s then ground Newcastle Road.

A 1908 oil painting by Henri Rousseau bears the title &quot;The Football Players&quot;, but it is possible that the moustachioed players depicted in this picture are, in fact, playing an early form of rugby football. Kazimir Malevich&#x27;s created an abstract painting in 1909 entitled &quot;Painterly Realism of a Football Player — Color Masses in the 4th Dimension&quot;. Another abstract football work, &quot;Dynamism of a Soccer Player&quot; by Umberto Boccioni dates from 1913. In the post-war era, Nicolas de Staël produced a series of paintings depicting a floodlit football match played between France and Sweden in 1952, entitled &quot;&quot;.

Possibly the most well-known football painting is L. S. Lowry&#x27;s 1953 canvas, &quot;Going to the Match&quot;. Lowry had produced paintings of football crowds as early as 1928, but his 1953 piece is widely recognised. It depicts crowds of fans on match day walking towards Burnden Park, the then home of Bolton Wanderers Football Club. When it was purchased at auction by the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (PFA), it chief executive Gordon Taylor (a former Bolton Wanderers player) stated, &quot;We were determined to buy it for football because it is quite simply the finest football painting ever.&quot; The painting was later sold to The Lowry arts centre in Salford where it is now on public display.

Numerous football-related sculptures have been created representing noted personalities of football, such as the Statue of Bobby Moore at Wembley Stadium in London (Philip Jackson, 2007), the statue of Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford in Manchester (Philip Jackson, 2012), the sculpture of Pelé at the Itaipava Arena Fonte Nova in Brazil (Lucy Viana, 1971), or the bronze statue of Zinedine Zidane headbutting Marco Materazzi (Adel Abdesseme, 2012). Sculptor Emanuel Santos&#x27;s bust of Cristiano Ronaldo attracted media criticism in 2017 for his stylised representation of the Portuguese player, and a revised version was unveiled at Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport the following year.

===Literature===
The popularity of football has been reflected in books and films. Books have been written dealing with the culture, such as violence, surrounding football, as well as detailed histories of events or rivalries. Many clubs have one or more fanzines, one example being TOOFIF.

Some consider that British football&#x27;s image of a nasty working-class pursuit was changed into something far more respectable after &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;, a memoir by Nick Hornby about his life as an Arsenal fan, was published. The book also provided Hornby&#x27;s big break. It was later adapted very loosely into a film. 

===Film===
Numerous films have been made including &quot;Cup-tie Honeymoon&quot; (1947), &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;, and &quot;The Football Factory&quot;, based on the book by John King, dealing with hooliganism and its relationship to socio-economic realities in England. In Germany, &quot;The Miracle of Bern&quot; (2003) revived the euphoria of the national team&#x27;s victory in the 1954 World Cup and was a huge hit.

In Venezuela, &quot;Hermano&quot; tells the story of two brothers who have the goal of becoming professional football players.

One film that has a historical basis is &quot;Escape to Victory&quot;. The film was based on the true World War II story where a Dynamo Kyiv team, which defeated a German Luftwaffe team, was subsequently persecuted and some team members executed. The story has also been recounted in the book &quot;Dynamo&quot; by Andy Dougan.

===Sticker albums and cards===

Usually collected by children, a sticker album is a book where a collector sticks in pictures of players from different teams in a certain league. There may also be stickers of the clubs&#x27; stadia, badges or team photos. The most widespread are those that have been produced by Panini worldwide. In 1970, Panini published its first FIFA World Cup sticker album for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. Initiating a craze for collecting and trading stickers, UK newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; states, &quot;the tradition of swapping duplicate [World Cup] stickers was a playground fixture during the 1970s and 1980s&quot;. Under its &quot;Merlin&quot; brand, Topps has held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League since 1994, including stickers (for their sticker album) and trading cards. Launched in the 2007–08 season, Topps&#x27; Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK, and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world.

===Religion===

Religious beliefs are also in common use throughout football. Some players are religious and can be seen to cross themselves before a game. In Africa, traditional belief rituals are used to help teams win important games. In Argentina, an official religion around the footballer Diego Maradona has been formed called &quot;Iglesia Maradoniana&quot;.

German club Schalke 04 has brought out their own Bible titled &quot;Mit Gott auf Schalke&quot; (&quot;With God in Schalke&quot;). This is an edition of the common Christian Bible along with spiritual texts by Christian Schalke players and officials.

===Health===
In July 2014, the Seychelles Health department blocked the football team from Sierra Leone from coming in to play qualification match for the Africa Cup of Nations. This came at the cost of Seychelles forfeiting that match and Sierra Leone advancing. The Africa Cup of Nations is known as the biggest football tournament in Africa.

Morocco asked to delay the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations due to Ebola, and then pulled out from hosting it entirely. Despite the scare, it held the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup. The Africa Cup of Nations is biennial 16-team football match for Africa. After this, the Confederation of African Football (&quot;CAF&quot;) searched for a new host nation for the event. Equatorial Guinea took over as the new host for the event. Equatorial Guinea was previously barred from the competition, but was allowed back in after it became host, while Morocco, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea were banned from the competition.

<text>Road Runner is a racing video game based on the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner shorts. It was released in arcades by Atari Games in 1985.

==Gameplay==
The player controls Road Runner, who is chased by Wile E. Coyote. In order to escape, Road Runner runs endlessly to the left. While avoiding Wile E. Coyote, the player must pick up bird seeds on the street, avoid obstacles like cars, and get through mazes. Most of the time Wile E. Coyote will just run after the Road Runner, but he occasionally uses tools like rockets, roller skates, and pogo sticks.
==Development==
Originally, the game was set to be released as a LaserDisc game, with the game&#x27;s graphics being overlaid over video footage showing the road and background scenery. Whenever the player managed to outwit the Coyote - such as tricking him into running off a cliff - a sequence from one of the original &quot;Road Runner&quot; shorts showing that exact situation would be played. 

The game was going to be released in 1984, but Atari decided to cancel the game. In 1985, the game was released by Atari Games as a traditional video game. In the released game, all of the original LaserDisc-based elements were either removed or replaced with computer-generated graphics.

One prototype cabinet of this original LaserDisc version is known to still exist, and occasionally appears at arcade collector&#x27;s conventions such as California Extreme.

==Music==
The background music during attract mode and 4th level is &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; from &quot;Gayane&quot; by Aram Khachaturian, the 1st level music is &quot;William Tell Overture&quot; by Gioachino Rossini, 2nd level music is &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and 3rd level is &quot;Trepak&quot; from &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

==Ports==
&quot;Road Runner&quot; was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Atari 2600, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, ZX Spectrum, and Nintendo Entertainment System. The Atari 2600 port was one of Atari Corporation&#x27;s last games for the system, being released in 1989.

Like other NES games released by Tengen, &quot;Road Runner&quot; was unlicensed by Nintendo itself, released as an unlicensed cartridge avoiding Nintendo&#x27;s protections.

==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1988 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #140 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.
The game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind &quot;Exolon&quot;.

<text>XPL, for expert&#x27;s programming language is a programming language based on PL/I, a portable one-pass compiler written in its own language, and a parser generator tool for easily implementing similar compilers for other languages. XPL was designed in 1967 as a way to teach compiler design principles and as starting point for students to build compilers for their own languages.

XPL was designed and implemented by William M. McKeeman, David B. Wortman, James J. Horning and others at Stanford University. XPL was first announced at the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference. The methods and compiler are described in detail in the 1971 textbook &quot;A Compiler Generator&quot;.

They called the combined work a &#x27;compiler generator&#x27;. But that implies little or no language- or target-specific programming is required to build a compiler for a new language or new target. A better label for XPL is a translator writing system. It helps to write a compiler with less new or changed programming code.

==Language==
The XPL language is a simple, small, efficient dialect of PL/I intended mainly for the task of writing compilers. The XPL language was also used for other purposes once it was available. XPL can be compiled easily to most modern machines by a simple compiler. Compiler internals can be written easily in XPL, and the code is easy to read. The PL/I language was designed by an IBM committee in 1964 as a comprehensive language replacing Fortran, COBOL, and ALGOL, and meeting all customer and internal needs. These ambitious goals made PL/I complex, hard to implement efficiently, and sometimes surprising when used. XPL is a small dialect of the full language. XPL has one added feature not found in PL/I: a STRING datatype with dynamic lengths. String values live in a separate text-only heap memory space with automatic garbage collection of stale values. Much of what a simple compiler does is manipulating input text and output byte streams, so this feature helps simplify XPL-based compilers.

==Components==
===XCOM===
The XPL compiler, called XCOM, is a one-pass compiler using a table-driven parser and simple code generation techniques. Versions of XCOM exist for different machine architectures, using different hand-written code generation modules for those targets. The original target was IBM System/360, which is a proper subset of IBM System/370, IBM System/390 and IBM System z.

XCOM compiles from XPL source code, but since XCOM itself is written in XPL it can compile itself – it is a &quot;self-compiling compiler&quot;, not reliant on other compilers. Several famous languages have self-compiling compilers, including Burroughs B5000 Algol, PL/I, C, LISP, and Java. Creating such compilers is a chicken-and-egg conundrum. The language is first implemented by a temporary compiler written in some other language, or even by an interpreter (often an interpreter for an intermediate code, as BCPL can do with intcode or O-code).

XCOM began as an Algol program running on Burroughs machines, translating XPL source code into System/360 machine code. The XPL team manually turned its Algol source code into XPL source code. That XPL version of XCOM was then compiled on Burroughs, creating a self-compiling XCOM for System/360 machines. The Algol version was then thrown away, and all further improvements happened in the XPL version only. This is called bootstrapping the compiler. The authors of XPL invented the tombstone diagram or T-diagram to document the bootstrapping process.

Retargeting the compiler for a new machine architecture is a similar exercise, except only the code generation modules need to be changed.

XCOM is a one-pass compiler (but with an emitted code fix-up process for forward branches, loops and other defined situations). It emits machine code for each statement as each grammar rule within a statement is recognized, rather than waiting until it has parsed the entire procedure or entire program. There are no parse trees or other required intermediate program forms, and no loop-wide or procedure-wide optimizations. XCOM does, however, perform peephole optimization. The code generation response to each grammar rule is attached to that rule. This immediate approach can result in inefficient code and inefficient use of machine registers. Such are offset by the efficiency of implementation, namely, the use of dynamic strings mentioned earlier: in processing text during compilation, substring operations are frequently performed. These are as fast as an assignment to an integer; the actual substring is not moved. In short, it is quick, easy to teach in a short course, fits into modest-sized memories, and is easy to change for different languages or different target machines.

===ANALYZER===
The XCOM compiler has a hand-written lexical scanner and a mechanically-generated parser. The syntax of the compiler&#x27;s input language (in this case, XPL) is described by a simplified BNF grammar. XPL&#x27;s grammar analyzer tool ANALYZER or XA turns this into a set of large data tables describing all legal combinations of the syntax rules and how to discern them. This table generation step is re-done only when the language is changed. When the compiler runs, those data tables are used by a small, language-independent parsing algorithm to parse and respond to the input language. This style of table-driven parser is generally easier to write than an entirely hand-written recursive descent parser. XCOM uses a bottom-up parsing method, in which the compiler can delay its decision about which syntax rule it has encountered until it has seen the rightmost end of that phrase. This handles a wider range of programming languages than top-down methods, in which the compiler must guess or commit to a specific syntax rule early, when it has only seen the left end of a phrase.

===Runtime===
XPL includes a minimal runtime support library for allocating and garbage-collecting XPL string values. The source code for this library must be included into almost every program written in XPL.

===SKELETON===
The last piece of the XPL compiler writing system is an example compiler named SKELETON. This is just XCOM with parse tables for an example toy grammar instead of XPL&#x27;s full grammar. It is a starting point for building a compiler for some new language, if that language differs much from XPL.

===XMON===
XPL is run under the control of a monitor, XMON, which is the only operating system-specific part of this system, and which acts as a &quot;loader&quot; for XCOM itself or any programs which were developed using XCOM, and also provides three auxiliary storage devices for XCOM&#x27;s use, and which are directly accessed by block number. The originally published XMON was optimized for IBM 2311s. An XMON parameter FILE= enabled the monitor to efficiently use other disks with larger block sizes. The working disk block size was also a compile-time constant in
XCOM.

XMON used a very simple strategy for disk direct access. NOTE provided the address of a disk track. POINT set the location of the next disk track to be the address previously returned by NOTE. This strategy was adopted to allow easy porting of XMON to other OSes, and to avoid the much more complicated disk direct access options available at that time.

Converting XMON from its primitive use of NOTE, POINT and READ/WRITE disk operations—with precisely 1 block per track—to EXCP (i.e., write/create new records) and XDAP (i.e., read/update old records)—with n blocks per track, where n was computed at run-time from the target device&#x27;s physical characteristics and could be significantly greater than 1—achieved significantly improved application performance and decreased operating system overhead.

Although originally developed for OS/360, XMON (either the original NOTE, POINT and READ/WRITE implementation; or the EXCP and XDAP enhancement) will run on subsequently released IBM OSes, including OS/370, XA, OS/390 and z/OS, generally without any changes.

==Parsing==
XCOM originally used a now-obsolete bottom-up parse table method called &quot;Mixed Strategy Precedence&quot;, invented by the XPL team (although the &quot;officially&quot; released version retains the MSP parser and &quot;does not&quot; include later-released &quot;peephole optimizations&quot; and additional data types which were developed outside of the &quot;original&quot; implementation team.) MSP is a generalization of the simple precedence parser method invented by Niklaus Wirth for PL360. Simple precedence is itself a generalization of the trivially simple operator precedence methods that work nicely for expressions like A+B*(C+D)-E. MSP tables include a list of expected triplets of language symbols. This list grows larger as the cube of the grammar size, and becomes quite large for typical full programming languages. XPL-derived compilers were difficult to fit onto minicomputers of the 1970s with limited memories. MSP is also not powerful enough to handle all likely grammars. It is applicable only when the language designer can tweak the language definition to fit MSP&#x27;s restrictions, before the language is widely used.

The University of Toronto subsequently changed XCOM and XA to instead use a variant of Donald Knuth&#x27;s LR parser bottom-up method. XCOM&#x27;s variant is called Simple LR or SLR. It handles more grammars than MSP but not quite as many grammars as LALR or full LR(1). The differences from LR(1) are mostly in the table generator&#x27;s algorithms, not in the compile-time parser method. XCOM and XA predate the widespread availability of Unix and its yacc parser generator tool. XA and yacc have similar purposes.

XPL is open source. The System/360 version of XPL was distributed through the IBM SHARE users organization. Other groups ported XPL onto many of the larger machines of the 1970s. Various groups extended XPL, or used XPL to implement other moderate-sized languages.

==Applications==
XPL has been used to develop a number of compilers for various languages and systems.
* Stony Brook Pascal
* HAL/S, the language used for the Space Shuttle program
* MALUS, a system programming language used by General Motors to develop their Multiple Console Time Sharing System
* New England Digital used a variant of XPL, called &quot;Scientific XPL&quot; for their ABLE series computers, used for laboratory automation, computer networking, and control of music synthesis hardware, starting in the mid-1970s

==Current status==
XPL continues to be ported to current computers. An x86/FreeBSD port was done in 2000, an x86/Linux port in 2015, and an XPL to C translator in 2017.

<text>Domenico Zampieri (, ; October 21, 1581 – April 6, 1641), known by the diminutive Domenichino (, ) after his shortness, was an Italian Baroque painter of the Bolognese School of painters.

==Life==

Domenichino was born in Bologna, son of a shoemaker, and there initially studied under Denis Calvaert. After quarreling with Calvaert, he left to work in the Accademia degli Incamminati of the Carracci where, because of his small stature, he was nicknamed Domenichino, meaning &quot;little Domenico&quot; in Italian. He left Bologna for Rome in 1602 and became one of the most talented apprentices to emerge from Annibale Carracci&#x27;s supervision. As a young artist in Rome he lived with his slightly older Bolognese colleagues Albani and Guido Reni, and worked alongside Lanfranco, who later would become a chief rival.

In addition to assisting Annibale with completion of his frescoes in the Galleria Farnese, including &quot;A Virgin with a Unicorn&quot; (–05), he painted three of his own frescoes in the Loggia del Giardino of the Palazzo Farnese –04. With the support of Monsignor Giovanni Battista Agucchi, the &quot;maggiordomo&quot; to Cardinal Aldobrandini and later Gregory XV, and Giovanni&#x27;s brother Cardinal Girolamo Agucchi, Domenichino obtained further commissions in Rome. His most important project of the first decade was decoration of the Cappella dei Santissimi Fondatori in the medieval basilica of the Abbey of Grottaferrata (1608–1610), some 20 kilometers outside Rome, where Odoardo Farnese was the titular abbot. Meanwhile, he had completed frescoes –05 in the church of Sant&#x27;Onofrio, feigned stucco decoration of 1606–07 in the Palazzo Mattei, a large scene of &quot;The Flagellation of St. Andrew&quot; at San Gregorio Magno, painted in competition with a fresco by Reni that faces it, and a ceiling with &quot;Scenes from the Life of Diana,&quot; 1609, in the Villa Odescalchi at Bassano di Sutri (today Bassano Romano).

Following Annibale Carracci&#x27;s death in 1609, the pupils who had followed Annibale&#x27;s Roman style, including Domenichino and Francesco Albani, were not as successful at gaining the most prestigious commissions as Guido Reni. As Donald Posner stated in his influential thesis, &quot;The Roman Style of Annibale Carracci and His School&quot;, &#x27;...it should be stressed that the severe classicism of Annibale&#x27;s late style had an immediate life in Rome of only about a lustrum [five years].&#x27; In turn, the Bolognese biographer Malvasia states that &#x27;only Guido [Reni] was put ahead of everyone else, Guido alone proclaimed and well treated, while [Domenichino], on the contrary, was either not recognized or constantly mistreated in the fees he got, so that he was left without commissions and rejected. Therefore, he was forced to go begging for work, with much effort, through intermediaries, and at any price... the same had been true of the &quot;Flagellation of Saint Andrew&quot;, which had been painted for a hundred and fifty scudi, whereas in the case of the &quot;Adoration of the Cross&quot; on the opposite wall four hundred scudi had gone to Guido.&#x27;

One of Domenichino&#x27;s masterpieces, his frescoes of &quot;Scenes of the Life of Saint Cecilia&quot; in the Polet Chapel of San Luigi dei Francesi, was commissioned in 1612 and completed in 1615. Concurrently he painted his first, and most celebrated, altarpiece, &quot;The Last Communion of St. Jerome&quot; for the church of San Girolamo della Carità (signed and dated, 1614). It subsequently would be judged as being comparable to Raphael&#x27;s great &quot;Transfiguration&quot; and even as &quot;the best picture in the world.&quot;
By late 1616, Domenichino had designed the coffered ceiling with &quot;The Assumption of the Virgin&quot; in Santa Maria in Trastevere; and he had begun a cycle of ten frescoes depicting the &quot;Life of Apollo&quot; in a garden pavilion of the Villa Aldobrandini (Belvedere) in Frascati, where he was assisted by Giovanni Battista Viola, a Bolognese artist who, like Domenichino himself, was a pioneer in the development of classicistic landscape painting. From 1617 until 1621, Domenichino was absent from Rome, working in Bologna and at Fano, where during 1618–19 he frescoed the Nolfi chapel of the Fano Cathedral with &quot;Scenes from the Life of the Virgin.&quot;

With the election of a Bolognese pope (Gregory XV) in 1621, Domenichino returned to Rome. Appointed Papal Architect (he built little but left drawings for various projects, most notably for the façade of Sant&#x27;Andrea della Valle and for the plan of Sant&#x27;Ignazio, both in Rome), he nonetheless continued to be most active as a painter, obtaining many commissions for altarpieces in Roman churches (San Lorenzo in Miranda, 1626–27, SS. Giovanni Evangelista e Petronio dei Bolognesi, 1626–1629, Santa Maria della Vittoria, 1629–30, and St. Peter&#x27;s, 1625–1630). He also executed numerous frescoes in Rome during the 1620s: a ceiling in the Palazzo Costaguti (); the choir and pendentives in Sant&#x27;Andrea della Valle, where he worked in fierce competition with Lanfranco, who painted the dome above Domenichino&#x27;s pendentives; and the pendentives of San Silvestro al Quirinale () and San Carlo ai Catinari (1628–30).

In spite of his activity in Rome, Domenichino decided to leave the city in 1631 to take up the most prestigious, and very lucrative, commission in Naples, the decoration of the Cappella del Tesoro di San Gennaro of the Naples Cathedral. His &quot;Scenes from the Life of San Gennaro&quot; occupied him for the rest of his life. He painted four large lunettes, four pendentives, and twelve scenes in the soffits of the arches, all in fresco, plus three large altarpieces in oil on copper. He died, perhaps by poison at the hands of the jealous Cabal of Naples, before completing the fourth altarpiece or the cupola, which was subsequently frescoed by Lanfranco.
At the time of his death, Domenichino&#x27;s chief assistant was an obscure painter from Assisi, Francesco Raspantino, who inherited his master&#x27;s studio. Earlier, Domenichino&#x27;s principal pupils were Alessandro Fortuna, Giovanni Battista Ruggieri, Antonio Alberti called Barbalonga, Francesco Cozza, Andrea Camassei, and Giovanni Angelo Canini. Others who studied in his studio include Poussin, Pietro Testa, and his future biographer, Giovanni Pietro Bellori.

==Ideas on art==
Domenichino&#x27;s work, developed principally from Raphael&#x27;s and the Carracci&#x27;s examples, mirrors the theoretical ideas of his friend Giovanni Battista Agucchi, with whom the painter collaborated on a &quot;Treatise on Painting&quot;. The portrait of Agucchi in York used to be attributed to Domenichino, but is now thought to be by Annibale Carracci, another friend.

It represents what would become known as classic-idealist art, which aims to surpass the imperfections of nature by developing an &quot;Idea of Beauty&quot; (&quot;idea del bello&quot;) through the study and imitation of the best examples of ancient and Renaissance art. Imitation in this sense is not copying but a creative process inspired by rhetorical theory whereby revered models are not only emulated but surpassed. One of the most famous incidents in the history of art that centered on concepts of Imitation arose when Lanfranco accused Domenichino of plagiarism, specifically of having stolen the design of his great &quot;Last Communion of St. Jerome&quot; from an altarpiece of the same subject in Bologna by his former teacher, Agostino Carracci. To prove his point, Lanfranco circulated a print after Agostino&#x27;s painting, prompting painters and critics to take sides, most of whom—including Poussin and the antiquarian-critic-biographer Bellori—strongly defended Domenichino&#x27;s work as being praiseworthy imitation.

In addition to his interest in the theory of painting (he was well educated and bookish), Domenichino was devoted to music, not as a performer but to the invention of instruments suited to the &quot;stile moderno&quot; or to what Monteverdi dubbed the &quot;seconda pratica.&quot; Like Domenichino&#x27;s paintings, its sources were in ancient models and aimed at clarity of expression capable of moving its audience. As the Florentine composer Giulio Caccini held and Domenichino surely believed, the aim of the composer/artist was to &quot;move the passion of the mind.&quot; To achieve that goal, Domenichino paid particular attention to expressive gestures. Some 1750 drawings in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle attest to the assiduous study underlying Domenichino&#x27;s work—figural, architectural, decorative, landscape, even caricature—and to the painter&#x27;s brilliance as a draftsman. In Roger de Piles&#x27; &quot;Balance&quot; of 1708, an effort to quantify and compare the greatness of painters in four categories (no artist ever achieved a score above 18 in any category), the French critic awarded Domenichino 17 points for drawing (&quot;dessein&quot;), 17 for &quot;expression&quot;, 15 for &quot;composition&quot;, yet only 9 as a colorist. Domenichino&#x27;s composite score of 58 nonetheless was surpassed only by Raphael and Rubens, and it equalled that of the Carracci.

===Criticism from Ruskin===

The &quot;Balance&quot; reflects Domenichino&#x27;s high standing in the history of European taste— until John Ruskin in the 1840s wrote his devastating attacks on Bolognese Baroque painting in his &quot;Modern Painters&quot;. The Carracci and their followers were condemned by Ruskin as being &quot;insincere&quot;. For Ruskin, there was no entirely sincere nor any great art from the seventeenth century and all was doubly damned as being &quot;eclectic.&quot; Modern scholarship, led by Luigi Serra, John Pope-Hennessy, Evelina Borea and Richard Spear, who in 1982 published the first catalogue raisonné of all of Domenichino&#x27;s paintings and preparatory drawings, has resurrected the artist from the Victorian graveyard and reestablished his place among the most important and influential painters of seventeenth-century Italy. In 1996 the first major exhibition of his work was held at the Palazzo Venezia in Rome.

<text>Gytha Thorkelsdóttir ( 997 – c. 1069), also called Githa, was a Danish noblewoman. She was the wife of Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and the mother of King Harold Godwinson and Edith of Wessex, the latter of whom was the queen consort of King Edward the Confessor.

==Biography==

Gytha Thorkelsdóttir was the daughter of Danish chieftain Thorgil Sprakling (also called Thorkel). Gytha was also the sister of the Danish Earl Ulf Thorgilsson who was married to Estrid Svendsdatter, the sister of King Cnut the Great. She married the Anglo-Saxon nobleman Godwin of Wessex. They had a large family, and one of their sons, Harold, became king of England.

Two of their sons, Harold and Tostig, faced each other at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, where Tostig was killed. Less than a month later, three of her sons: Harold, Gyrth, and Leofwine, were killed by William the Conqueror&#x27;s invading Norman army at the Battle of Hastings. She pleaded with William for the return of the body of her slain son, King Harold, but was unsuccessful. Shortly after the Battle of Hastings, Gytha was living in Exeter and may have been the cause of that city&#x27;s rebellion against William the Conqueror in 1067, which resulted in his laying siege to the city. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,&quot; Gytha left England after the Norman conquest, together with the wives or widows and families of other prominent Anglo-Saxons, all the Godwin family estates having been confiscated by William. Little else is known of Gytha&#x27;s life after that time, although it is probable that she went to Scandinavia where she had relatives.

Her youngest and only surviving son, Wulfnoth, lived nearly all his life in captivity in Normandy until the death of William the Conqueror in 1087. Only her eldest daughter, Queen Edith (d. 1075), still held some power (however nominal) as the widow of King Edward the Confessor.

*Edith of Wessex, (c. 1025 – December 19, 1075), queen consort of Edward the Confessor

<doc id="902090" wikidata="Q361687" url="?curid=902090" title="Thorgils Sprakelegg">
<text>Thorgils Sprakalegg (also called Thorgil, Torkel, Torgils, Thrugils or Sprakalägg) was a Danish nobleman whose children were active in the politics of Denmark and England in the early 11th century and who was grandfather of kings of both nations. Little is recorded about Thorgils in historical texts outside of his place in the genealogy of his children or grandchildren. Thorgils&#x27; cognomen &quot;Sprakalägg&quot; can be translated into English as &quot;Break-leg&quot; or &quot;Strut-leg&quot;.

The 11th-century English chronicler John of Worcester reports in an entry dated 1049 that Earl Beorn Estrithson was brother of King Svein of Denmark, and son of Danish Earl Ulf, son of Spracling[us], son of Urs[us]. Here Spraclingus is a garbled representation of the byname of Thorgils appearing in later Scandinavian sources, while Ursus is the Latin &quot;urso&quot;, or bear (&quot;Bjørn&quot; in Danish, &quot;Björn&quot; in Swedish).

He appears in several 13th-century sources. He is Torgils or Þorgils Sprakaleggs in &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot; and in two works of Snorri Sturluson – &quot;Óláfs saga helga&quot; in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, and the &quot;Separate Saga of St. Olaf&quot; – each time simply as father of Earl Ulf. Two other 13th-century sources relate folklore that derives Thorgils from the mating of a bear with a noblewoman. Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus recorded that the son born to such a union was &#x27;named after his father&#x27; (i.e. called &#x27;bear&#x27; – Ursus/Björn; in the 14th-century summary of Saxo&#x27;s work, &quot;Compendium Saxonis&quot;, he is explicitly named &#x27;Byorn&#x27;) and was himself father of &#x27;Thrugillus, called Sprageleg&#x27;, father of Earl Ulf. Saxo further says of &#x27;Thrugillis&#x27; that he &quot;lacked not one ounce of his father&#x27;s valour&quot; (&quot;nullo probitatis vestigio a paternae virtutis imitatione defecit&quot;). The other source, &quot;Gesta Antecessorum Comitis Waldevi&quot;, copies the early generations of John of Worcester&#x27;s pedigree but, confusing two like-named men, replaces Earl Beorn Estrithson as Earl Ulf&#x27;s son with Björn Boreson, the father of Siward, Earl of Northumbria. This pedigree commences with an episode not found in the Worcester chronicler&#x27;s pedigree but similar to that of Saxo, that a &#x27;certain nobleman&#x27;, contrary to the natural order of human procreation, had a white bear as his father and a noblewoman as a mother, before continuing the pedigree with &#x27;Ursus begat Spratlingus&#x27;. The chronicle sometimes attributed to the 15th-century John Brompton tells a very similar tale of bear-paternity relating to the birth of Björn Boresune (&#x27;bear&#x27;s son&#x27;) himself. Historian Timothy Bolton has suggested that the role of a bear in the immediate ancestry of both Ulf&#x27;s children and Siward&#x27;s line may represent a tradition shared by relatives rather than that two independent families at about the same time both co-opting the same ancient Norwegian legend for their immediate ancestry – that Björn Boresune and Thorgils may have been brothers.

In the 18th century, Danish historian Jakob Langebek suggested this bear story was allegorical, and that the brutish &#x27;Wild&#x27; Björn, father of Thorgils, was a reference to Jomsviking brigand leader Styrbjörn the Strong (&quot;Styrbjörn Starke&quot;), depicted by sagas as the son of Olaf Björnsson, king of Sweden. The sagas relate that Styrbjörn was the first husband of Tyra, the daughter of Harold Bluetooth, king of Denmark and Norway. Otto Brenner&#x27;s detailed study of the descendants of Gorm the Old gives his granddaughter Tyra and Styrbjörn no children.

==Children==
*Ulf (died 1027) – Earl in Denmark and brother-in law of King Cnut the Great. His son became King Sweyn II of Denmark.
*Eileifr (Eglaf), named in a Supplement to &quot;Jómsvíkinga saga&quot; as &quot;Eilífr Þorgilsson, bróðir Úlfs&quot;, he was one of the leaders of Thorkell the Tall&#x27;s 1009 invasion of England, and appears between 1019 and 1024 as an earl under King Cnut with jurisdiction centered on Gloucester. He ravaged the South Wales coastal region in 1022/3, but apparently left England for Scandinavia in 1024.
*Gytha Thorkelsdóttir – married Godwin, Earl of Wessex; mother of King Harold Godwinson of England and Edith of Wessex, Queen of King Edward the Confessor.

<text>Up at the Lake is the eighth album by the British alternative rock band The Charlatans, released on 17 May 2004 through Universal and Island Records Group. As promotion wrapped up for their seventh album, &quot;Wonderland&quot; (2001), Universal wanted them to follow it up with another one quickly. However, frontman Tim Burgess began working on his debut solo album in late 2002. At the end of the year, the band reconvened to write songs; by March 2003, they relocated to their own studio, Big Mushroom, in Cheshire, Greater Manchester, with them and James Spencer serving as producers. Recording halted in May 2003 to allow for Burgess to finish his album, &quot;I Believe&quot; (2003); sessions would resume by the end of the year and finish in February 2004. &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; is a pop rock album that pursues the country rock direction that they had first explored on their sixth album, &quot;Tellin&#x27; Stories&quot; (1997).

&quot;Up at the Lake&quot; received generally favourable reviews from music critics, many of whom praised the songwriting. It peaked at number 6 in Scotland, number 13 in the United Kingdom, and number 32 in Ireland, being certified silver in the UK 11 days after its release. Both &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; and &quot;Try Again Today&quot; reached the top 30 on the Scottish and UK Singles Charts. &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single in May 2004, which was promoted with a tour of the UK and appearances at the Isle of Wight and T in the Park festivals until the following month. &quot;Try Again Today&quot; was released as the second single from the album in July 2004; afterwards, the Charlatans performed at the V Festival. In December 2004, the band embarked on another tour of the UK, and &quot;Loving You Is Easy&quot; was released as a radio-only promotional single. A video album from that tour was released in early 2005 under the title &quot;Live at Last Brixton Academy&quot;.

==Background and development==
The Charlatans released their seventh studio album, &quot;Wonderland&quot;, in September 2001 through Universal Records. As it was released in the United States on 11 September, it would perform poorly commercially in that territory. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number two in the UK Albums Chart, while its two singles, &quot;Love Is the Key&quot; and &quot;A Man Needs to Be Told&quot;, charted within the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. They promoted it with two tours in the UK and one in the US, along with appearances at the 
Coachella, Isle of Wight, and Glastonbury Festivals. After supporting Stereophonics at Slane Castle in Dublin, Ireland, in August 2002, the Charlatans played three club shows to end the month. Universal wanted a follow-up quickly, threatening the band with dropping them from the roster if they did not work on one; frontman Tim Burgess was not happy with the situation. He wanted to continue writing, but the rest of the band members wanted a break.

In October 2002, &quot;Dotmusic&quot; reported that Burgess was recording a solo album with Linus of Hollywood. A few days later, the band denied rumours that they would be splitting up but mentioned that the other members worked with different artists: drummer Jon Brookes with Preacher Man and keyboardist Tony Rogers with Moco. In the same announcement, they mentioned that they would start demoing material for their next album in early 2003, which they were aiming to release later that year. In December 2002, the band started writing new songs; guitarist Mark Collins subsequently visited Burgess in February 2003 at his home in Los Angeles, California, where the pair worked for three weeks, finishing four tracks in the process. The two of them would then spend some time in a cottage in Bodmin Moor, Cornwall. As the pair left behind a CD of the material they were working on, the material made it out to the public as a bootleg.

==Recording==
In March 2003, the band relocated to their own studio, Big Mushroom, in Cheshire, Greater Manchester, with them and engineer James Spencer serving as producers. Burgess said that unlike &quot;Wonderland&quot;, they had no firm idea of what musical direction they wanted to take for &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; when they got into the studio. By May 2003, they had finished seven songs but had to pause recording as Burgess shifted focus to his solo debut, &quot;I Believe&quot; (2003). Bassist Martin Blunt said the plan was for Burgess to finish promoting his album before they would return to work on their album. While this was occurring, the band held a warm-up show in London prior to their appearances at the Move and T in the Park festivals in July 2003. At the former festival, the band premiered a new track, &quot;Feel the Pressure&quot;.

Collins, meanwhile, worked with Adam Masterson, marking his first producer role outside of the band; Rogers performed on one of his tracks. The band regrouped at Big Mushroom in December 2003, after the conclusion of Burgess&#x27; solo tour of the UK. They expected to have an album&#x27;s worth of tracks finished by early 2004, eventually ending in February 2004. Linus of Hollywood recorded Burgess&#x27; vocals for &quot;Try Again Today&quot;; Mike Cave did additional engineering on it, as Blunt thought the song sounded a bit overproduced. The songs were mixed by Spencer, Ken Nelson, and the Chemical Brothers at Parr Street Studios in Liverpool and Mayfair and Miloco Studios in London, before the album was mastered by Frank Arkwright at Townhouse Studios, also in London. Johnny Marr helped compile the final track listing.

==Composition and lyrics==
Musically, &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; is a pop rock album that continues the country rock direction that the band initially explored on their sixth album, &quot;Tellin&#x27; Stories&quot; (1997). &quot;Cokemachineglow&quot; writer David M. Goldstein explained that &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; had the &quot;same hazy, guitar-centered production, and an emphasis on la-di-da country-rockers evoking the [Rolling] Stones at their late &#x27;60s/early &#x27;70s peak&quot; as &quot;Tellin&#x27; Stories&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Jason Damas wrote that the &quot;classic-rock coloring that dominated discs&quot; such as the band&#x27;s self-titled (1995) and &quot;Tellin&#x27; Stories&quot; albums return, in addition to &quot;brief flirtations with classic folk&quot;. The band&#x27;s trademark Hammond organ sound also returned, though in a reduced presence, as Collins&#x27; guitarwork was placed higher in the mix. Burgess largely dropped the falsetto vocal styling that he used on the majority of &quot;Wonderland&quot;, though it was used on &quot;Up at the Lake&quot;. According to Burgess, the album&#x27;s title is taken from a never-made David Lynch film, and &quot;I thought we could at least provide the soundtrack to this unmade film&quot;.

The opening track, &quot;Up at the Lake&quot;, is a British traditional rock song; its first line is adapted from &quot;Loose Fit&quot; (1990) by former contemporaries Happy Mondays. The indie disco song &quot;Feel the Pressure&quot; evokes the &quot;Tellin&#x27; Stories&quot; track &quot;One to Another&quot;. Burgess said its &quot;full horror movie&quot; intro section was made by the collaborators, the Chemical Brothers. For the rest of the track, Collins came up with music that was more akin to the rest of the album until Blunt said the Chemical Brothers &quot;did their thing to it.&quot; Burgess had Brookes play a drum pattern akin to the sound of Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow. The opening portion of the following track, &quot;As I Watch You in Disbelief&quot;, is taken from &quot;Heroes&quot; (1977) by David Bowie. Burgess said it detailed &quot;being broken&quot; and was influenced by &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot; (1971) by Bob Dylan. &quot;Cry Yourself to Sleep&quot; retreads the American country and folk direction that Burgess tackled on &quot;I Believe&quot;. It was written by Rogers, though Burgess said he potentially contributed a few lyrics to it. Rogers described it as a melancholic song about his daughters moving to Australia. Ged Lynch, formerly of Black Grape, contributed percussion to the track.

&quot;Bona Fide Treasure&quot; is done in the style of Electric Light Orchestra, while &quot;High Up Your Tree&quot; was compared to Ween, specifically on their album &quot;White Pepper&quot; (2000). Discussing the latter, Burgess found it difficult to &quot;keep the band and my marriage together&quot;. &quot;Blue for You&quot; is a psychedelic blues track that was written about their former, deceased keyboardist, Rob Collins. &quot;I&#x27;ll Sing a Hymn (You Came to Me)&quot;, another one in the vein of Burgess&#x27; solo album, apes the sound of Bob Dylan circa &quot;New Morning&quot; (1970). Burgess said he tried emulating &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Leave Me Lonely&quot; (1971) by King Floyd, though he admitted it was unsuccessful. &quot;Loving You Is Easy&quot; is a soul ballad that recalled the work of Minnie Riperton, who had a song with the same name. Rogers sings lead vocals on the track, though he did not wish to; he wished for the song to be dropped entirely, but the rest of the band wanted it on the album. &quot;Try Again Today&quot; is a Beatlesque ballad, co-written by Linus of Hollywood, who helped Burgess on &quot;I Believe&quot;. Burgess wanted to talk about &quot;when things are not going that well [...] having another go&quot; and not having high expectations. He said he was unhappy when he composed the lyrics to &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot;. The album concludes with &quot;Dead Love&quot;, which talks about communication with the band breaking down and Burgess feeling alone while promoting &quot;I Believe&quot;. It features cello and viola from Ian Bracken and Heather Wallington, respectively, of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic.

==Release==
American label MCA Records was absorbed by Universal Music Group (UMG) subsidiary Geffen Records in mid-2003, which resulted in its staff and roster being moved to Geffen. As a result, the band was dropped from the roster. On 22 March 2004, &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; was announced for release in two months&#x27; time; alongside this, the track listing was posted online. The band debuted material from the album at two one-off shows in London in early May 2004. Initially planned for 3 May 2004, &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on 10 May 2004. The CD version included &quot;For Where There Is Love, There Will Always Be Miracles&quot;, while the seven-inch vinyl edition featured &quot;I&#x27;ll Sing A Hymn (You Came to Me)&quot; as the B-side. After being available to stream on the band&#x27;s website two and a half weeks ahead of schedule, &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; was released on 17 May 2004. Its artwork was taken at Pickmere Lake in Cheshire, outside of Burgess&#x27; home town of Northwich.

In May and June 2004, the band embarked on a tour of the UK, leading up to appearances at the Isle of Wight, T in the Park, and Fleadh festivals. Additional shows were added, with two shows apiece in Glasgow and Manchester. &quot;Try Again Today&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on 26 July 2004. The CD edition featured &quot;M.I.A.&quot;, &quot;Give Me a Reason&quot;, and the music video for &quot;Try Again Today&quot;, while the DVD version included videos of &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; and footage from Keele University, along with audio of &quot;Try Again Today&quot;. while the seven-inch vinyl edition featured &quot;I&#x27;ll Sing A Hymn (You Came to Me)&quot; as the B-side. In August 2004, the band performed at the V Festival. They ended the year with a short tour of the UK in December 2004; extra shows were added twice, increasing it to an eight-date tour. &quot;Loving You Is Easy&quot; was released as a radio-only promotional single on 20 December 2004. In April 2005, the band&#x27;s second video album, &quot;Live at Last Brixton Academy&quot;, was released, consisting of footage from the December 2004 tour.

&quot;Up at the Lake&quot; was re-pressed on vinyl in 2018 through UMC, Universal&#x27;s catalogue label. &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; and &quot;Try Again Today&quot; were featured on the band&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;&quot; (2006), while four demos from the sessions were included on the special edition version of it. &quot;High Up Your Tree&quot; and &quot;Blue for You&quot; appeared on their fourth compilation album, &quot;Collection&quot; (2007). &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; was included on their fifth compilation album, &quot;A Head Full of Ideas&quot; (2021).

==Reception==

&quot;Up at the Lake&quot; was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 72, based on 10 reviews.

Reviewers praised the songwriting. Damas felt that there was a &quot;defined sense that this is the beginning of a new chapter for the band, and that Up at the Lake is their first work as &#x27;mature&#x27; artists.&quot; He added that it was a &quot;relaxed and assured record, the work of craftsmen who know how to produce something solid and consistent.&quot; Goldstein said it was &quot;surprisingly their strongest effort&quot; since &quot;Tellin&#x27; Stories&quot;, agreeing with Damas that they &quot;actually sound[ed] relaxed,&quot; making it the type of album that the band could compose in their sleep. &quot;The Independent&quot; critic Andy Gill was also impressed, saying that the &quot;relatively simple and direct &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; is a surprise&quot;, adding that it was the &quot;most focused, coherent and unmediated that the band have sounded in years.&quot; Steve McQueen of &quot;Gigwise&quot; called it &quot;soothingly British, with authentic flavourings throughout. Like an English summer&#x27;s day – you cannot take this for granted.&quot; Chris Nye Browne of Yahoo! Launch said that &quot;although, essentially, there&#x27;s nothing exceptional here, as an album &#x27;Up At The Lake&#x27; flows seamlessly.&quot;

Other critics felt that it was uninspiring. &quot;Entertainment.ie&quot; Andrew Lynch wrote that &quot;while it doesn&#x27;t break any new ground, it&#x27;s just as enjoyable&quot; as their past releases. The staff at &quot;Uncut&quot; said it was &quot;hardly the album-length E-rush of career peak &quot;Tellin&#x27; Stories&quot; (1997),&quot; while Stephen Ackroyd of &quot;This Is Fake DIY&quot; said the band &quot;[c]ould do worse, [or] could do a lot better.&quot; RTÉ.ie writer Seamus Leonard said &quot;unfortunately the songs are pretty inconsistent&quot;, with &quot;Cry Yourself to Sleep&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Sing a Hymn (You Came to Me)&quot; being &quot;well worth listening to, but [...] [t]he rest are reasonable but unremarkable.&quot; &quot;God Is in the TV&quot; Alex Worsnip, meanwhile, thought they had &quot;run their course at this stage, although they themselves seem positive about their direction. However, for the rest of us, &#x27;Up At The Lake&#x27; will be both familiar and uninspiring&quot;. Playlouder writer Richard Smirke said the album &quot;plays more like Burgess &amp; Co hijacking &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot;, rather than a band trying to sound fresh or relevant in their fifteenth year. Unfortunately, as artistically redundant as that concept sounds, this 45-minute pop-rock opus doesn&#x27;t fare much better.&quot;

&quot;Up at the Lake&quot; peaked at number 13 in the UK; it reached number 6 in Scotland and number 32 in Ireland. It was certified silver in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry 11 days after its release. &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; charted at number 20 in Scotland and number 23 in the UK. &quot;Try Again Today&quot; charted at number 24 in Scotland and the UK.

<doc id="902093" wikidata="Q423516" url="?curid=902093" title="Belisario Corenzio">
<text>Belisario Corenzio ( 1558–1646) was a Greek-Italian painter, active in Venice and Naples. He is one of few Greek painters that did not belong to the Cretan Renaissance like his contemporaries of the time. He escaped the maniera greca completely. He adopted the Venetian style. Other similar Greek painters were Marco Basaiti, Ioannis Permeniates, Antonio Vassilacchi and El Greco. He was sometimes referred to as Il Greco. His teacher was prominent Venetian painter Tintoretto. In 1590, at age 32 Corenzio settled in Naples. Corenzio was influenced by Cavalier d&#x27;Arpino. He continued to flourish in the region. His apprentices included: Luigi Rodriguez, Andrea di Leone, Onofrio De Lione and Massimo Stanzione. Corenzio painted many frescos that survived today. Some of his works are in the Church of San Severino and Certosa di San Martino. His style resembles Caravaggio. An Italian legend in Naples exists involving Corenzio, Spanish painter Jusepe de Ribera, and Battistello Caracciolo. They were referred to as the Cabal of Naples. The three painters were rumored to have poisoned their competition for painting contracts. The rumors lack documented evidence. The three painters were very popular in Naples. Corenzio frescoed the Crypt that holds the remains of Matthew the Apostle at Salerno Cathedral and it depicts scenes from the Gospel of Matthew. Corenzio was one of the most celebrated fresco painters in Naples during his time. His drawings can be found all over the world namely at the Metropolitan Museum, Museo di Capodimonte and Louvre. More recently, his life and work was studied by the Greek art historian Panayotis K. Ioannou in a comprehensive monograph (&quot;Belisario Corenzio: La Vita e le Opere&quot;).

==Biography==
Corenzio was born in the city of Arcadia (today Kyparissia) in South West Peloponnese. He was in the Kingdom of Naples by age 12. The region was part of the Spanish Empire. His family was part of the Greek community in Naples. His father&#x27;s name was Ioannis. His father and Uncle Nikolaos were prominent members of the Spanish community. The family had a close relationship with Don Juan de Austria. Nikolaos served in the Royal Navy. He was a professional seaman. The family was very wealthy. According to the testimony of collector Padre Resta, Corenzio was sent to learn painting by the Don himself. A contract exists from 1574 regarding Corenzio&#x27;s painting education but it was only for six months.

He migrated to Venice during the 1580s. He spent five years in Venice studying under Tintoretto. There was a prominent Greek community in Venice around that period. San Giorgio dei Greci employed many of the Greek painters. Some of the Greek painters living in Venice were Antonio Vassilacchi, Thomas Bathas and Emmanuel Tzanfournaris. By 1590, Corenzio returned to Naples and settled there for the rest of his life. He had an active workshop. Art historian Bernardo de&#x27; Dominici extensively wrote about the painters of Napoli in his famous &quot;Vite dei Pittori, Scultori, ed Architetti Napolitani&quot; in the later part of the 18th century. It is one of the first extensive biographies written about Corenzio. It was published in 1742. Bernardo de&#x27; Dominici was considered the Neapolitan Vasari.

Dominici described Corenzio as a brilliant painter who was exceptionally talented. He could paint faster than five painters combined. According to Dominici, Corenzio painted for money rather than art. He complained that Corenzio&#x27;s artwork suffered when he was paid less. Dominici had a similar opinion regarding other prominent Italian painters. Paolo de Matteis began collecting notes on Neopolitan artists. He died before he could publish his work. Dominici used these notes in his writings about Corenzio.

According to Dominici, Corenzio was also very jealous and despotic towards other painters. Because of his ill-temper and bad reputation his artistic reputation was overshadowed by negative rumors. Corenzio formed an alliance with Jusepe de Ribera and Battistello Caracciolo. The group was called the Cabal of Naples. For four hundred years historians have added their own versions of the story but none of the claims are grounded on solid evidence. According to legend, the three painters did not allow the employment of foreign painters in Naples. Luigi Rodriguez was a student of Corenzio. It is rumored that his student was so good that he began to obtain his own contracts. Corenzio became very jealous and he slowly poisoned him. Some historians disagree on the date of Luigi Rodriguez‘s death.

Guido Reni was afraid to paint in Naples around 1621 because of rumors that the Cabal of Naples poisoned artists that tried to compete with them. Another rumor surfaced that Guido Reni&#x27;s assistant was murdered by the Cabal of Naples and Guido Reni was driven out of the city. Another claim that involved Corenzio and the Cabal of Naples was the poisoning of famous painter Domenichino, but Dominici specifies that his relatives played a major part in his death because they wanted his money.
Corenzio continued to paint all over Naples. He mainly completed many frescos in different churches in Naples. Three notable churches include Salerno Cathedral, Santi Severino e Sossio, and Santissima Annunziata Maggiore, Naples. He taught fresco painting in Naples some of his students also included painters Onofrio De Lione, Massimo Stanzione and Andrea di Leone. Many of Corenzio&#x27;s drawings survived until today. More rumors surfaced about his death. One such story states that he fell from a scaffolding while repairing one of his frescos in the church of San Severino another rumor states he poisoned himself. He is one of the most gossiped and celebrated artists of his time. His tomb can be found at Santi Severino e Sossio.

==Artistic career==
His earliest work was during the 1590s he painted the Medici Chapel of Gragnano which is part of the Santi Severino e Sossio and Certosa di San Martino. Around 1603, the painter painted the basilica of Santa Maria a Parete in Liveri Naples. He painted two frescos. The larger one is on the right side depicting scenes of the Dance of Death, Judgment, Hell, and Heaven. Other paintings are in Nola at the Church of the Annunciation. There is evidence that Corenzio painted parts of the Castel Capuano from dated payments of the Banco di Napoli in 1608. Corenzio also painted frescoes in the church of Santa Patrizia.

In 1609, he decorated the vaults of the nave, transept, and choir of church of Santi Severino e Sossio. By 1615, he frescoed the lunette vault of the apse of the church of Santa Maria di Costantinopoli. Around 1629, he frescoed the dome of Monte Cassino (lost in the bombing of 1944 ). He also painted frescoes in the gallery of Capuano Palace (Portici). They were also destroyed. He worked for many years in the church of Santa Maria la Nova (he frescoed the ceiling). He created four canvases for the Santa Maria Del Popolo (Christmas, Epiphany, Presentation and the Rest in Egypt). The painter retired in the village of Esperia, he died in 1646 at 88 years old. He completed countless works throughout his lifetime. Many artists were extremely jealous of his successful workshop.

He was a prominent member of the Greek community in Naples. A similar church existed resembling San Giorgio dei Greci in Venice. The church served the local Greek Orthodox population and it was called the Santi Pietro e Paolo dei Greci (Naples, Italy). Corenzio completed frescos in the church. He was also a member of the Confraternity of Saints Peter and Paul of the Greeks. A road in Vomero is named after him, it is called Via Belisario Corenzio.

<doc id="902095" wikidata="Q611089" url="?curid=902095" title="Siege of Tobruk">
<text>The siege of Tobruk () took place between 10 April and 27 November 1941, during the Western Desert campaign (1940–1943) of the Second World War. An Allied force, consisting mostly of the 9th Australian Division, commanded by Lieutenant-General Leslie Morshead, was besieged in the North African port of Tobruk by German and Italian forces. The tenacious defenders quickly became known as the Rats of Tobruk. After 231 days, they were finally relieved by the British Eighth Army.

In late 1940, the Allies had defeated the Italian 10th Army during Operation Compass and trapped the remnants at Beda Fomm. On 22 January 1941, Tobruk&#x27;s Italian garrison surrendered. But in early 1941, much of the British Western Desert Force was sent to the Greek and Syria–Lebanon campaigns, leaving only a skeleton force short of equipment and supplies. 

Adolf Hitler felt compelled to send reinforcements, commanded by &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Erwin Rommel, to rescue his beleaguered Italian ally. Rommel launched Operation Sonnenblume , driving the Allies back across Libya to the Egyptian border. However, Tobruk held out, depriving Rommel of a supply port closer to the Egyptian–Libyan border than Benghazi, west of the Egyptian frontier. The Axis siege of Tobruk began on 10 April and continued despite two failed Allied relief attempts: Operation Brevity and Operation Battleaxe . The garrison repulsed several Axis attacks. The port was frequently bombarded by artillery, dive-bombers and medium bombers, while the Royal Air Force flew defensive sorties from airfields far away in Egypt. Allied naval forces, such as the British Mediterranean Fleet (including the Inshore Squadron) ran the blockade, carrying reinforcements and supplies in and the wounded and prisoners out. Finally, Operation Crusader succeeded in raising the siege.

==Background==

The Western Desert Campaign was fought from Mersa Matruh in Egypt to Gazala in Cyrenaica on the Libyan coast, an area about wide along the Libyan Coastal Highway (), the only paved road. A sand sea inland marked the southern limit of the desert, which was at its widest at Giarabub and Siwa; in British parlance, the Western Desert came to include eastern Cyrenaica in Libya. Extending inland from the coast lies a raised, flat plain of stony desert, about above sea level, for to the sand sea. Scorpions, vipers and flies populated the region, which was inhabited by a small number of nomads. Bedouin tracks linked wells and the more easily traversed ground; navigation was by sun, star, compass and &quot;desert sense&quot;, good perception of the environment gained by experience. When Italian troops advanced into Egypt in September 1940, the Maletti Group got lost leaving Sidi Omar and had to be found by aircraft.

In spring and summer, days are hot and nights cold; the sirocco, a hot desert wind blows clouds of fine sand, which reduces visibility to a few meters and coats eyes, lungs, machinery, food and equipment; motor vehicles and aircraft need special oil filters and the barren ground means that supplies for military operations have to be transported from outside. German engines tended to overheat and tank engine life fell from to , which was made worse by the lack of standard parts for German and Italian types. The ground is a hard surface which drops to sea level in steps, with the coast cut by ravines.

The Italian fortifications at Tobruk included an outer perimeter, comprising a double semi-circle of dug-in strongpoints with concrete walls, positioned well for forward observation, an inner anti-tank ditch, some parts of which were behind barbed wire and/or included booby traps, as well as several more fortified positions closer to the port, at the Bardia–El Adem road junction and towards Fort Pilastrino.

=== Capture of Tobruk ===

In January 1941, the British XIII Corps, under the command of Lieutenant-General Richard O&#x27;Connor, as part of Operation Compass, surrounded Tobruk, which was defended by the Italian XXII Corps, commanded by General Pitassi Mannella.

After blockading the fort for a fortnight, on the night of 20 January, the British Navy, led by the HMS Terror, under the command of Captain Hector Waller, bombarded Tobruk. Further out naval destroyers laid a trap for the &quot;San Giorgio&quot; in case it tried to break out. On the morning of 21 January between 5 and 7 am, the British artillery bombed the town. At 7 am the 2/3rd Australian Battalion attacked the town and quickly created a massive breach and by the evening half of Tobruk. The next day, the naval command surrendered and by 4 pm General dalla Mura also surrendered, Mannella having been captured earlier on in the day.

==Prelude==

===Operation &quot;Sonnenblume&quot;===


In February of 1941, the Allies defeated the 10th Army and the &quot;5°&quot; of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;, after which Allied leaders decided to hold the area with minimal forces and send the remainder of the WDF to Greece. The Australian 9th Division and the British 2nd Armoured Division (Major-General Michael Gambier-Parry), minus a brigade group sent to Greece, were left to garrison Cyrenaica under Cyrenaica Command (Cyrcom: Lieutenant-General Henry Maitland Wilson), despite the inadequacy of the force if the Germans sent reinforcements to Libya. Command in Egypt was taken over by Lieutenant-General Richard O&#x27;Connor and the XIII Corps HQ was replaced by the HQ of the 1st Australian Corps (Lieutenant-General Thomas Blamey). It was believed by General Wavell and the GHQ in Egypt that the Germans could not attack until May, when the 9th Australian Division, two more divisions and support troops, particularly artillery would be ready and the tanks of the 2nd Armoured Division would have been overhauled.

The 2nd Armoured Division had a reconnaissance regiment and the 3rd Armoured Brigade (Brigadier Reginald Rimington), which had an under-strength light tank regiment and one equipped with captured Fiat M13/40 tanks. The cruiser regiment arrived in late March with worn-out tracks, after many breakdowns en route and brought the division up to an under-strength armoured brigade. Most of the British tanks were worn out and the Italian tanks were slow and unreliable. The British 2nd Support Group (similar to a small infantry brigade) had only a motor battalion, a 25-pounder field gun regiment, an anti-tank battery and a machine-gun company. The division was short of transport and its workshops were understaffed and lacked spare parts. Two brigades of the 9th Australian Division (Major-General Leslie Morshead) were swapped with two from the 7th Australian Division (Major-General John Lavarack), which had insufficient training, equipment and transport.

Lack of transport made it impossible to supply a garrison west of El Agheila, the most favourable position for a defensive line and restricted the 2nd Armoured Division to movement between supply dumps, reducing its limited mobility further. In February, Lieutenant-General Philip Neame took over Cyrcom and predicted that the armoured division would lose many tanks through breakdowns if it had to move far. Neame asked for a proper armoured division, two infantry divisions and adequate air support to hold the area; he was told that there was little to send and none of that before April. In early March, the 9th Australian Division began to relieve the 6th Australian Division (Major-General Iven Mackay) at Mersa Brega for shipment to Greece, which demonstrated the difficulty of tactical moves with insufficient transport and it was withdrawn to the area east of Benghazi.

Neame was ordered to conserve the tank units, retire as far as Benghazi if pressed, abandon it if necessary, and hold the high ground nearby for as long as possible, with no prospect of reinforcement before May. Neame was to fight a delaying action up the &quot;Via Balbia&quot; towards Benghazi and then the defiles near Er Regima and Barce; the tanks would move to Antelat to operate against the flank and rear of an attacker moving up the road or across the desert to Tobruk, falling back on a flank if necessary. On 20 March, the 2nd Armoured Division took over from the Australians, who moved back to Tocra, near Er Regima. The force was to use depots at Msus, Tecnis, Martuba, Mechili and Tmimi, El Magrun and Benghazi as a substitute for lorry-borne supply. The 3rd Indian Motor Brigade (Brigadier E. W. D. Vaughan) arrived in late March, with lorries but no tanks, artillery, anti-tank guns and only half its wireless sets; the brigade was based at Martuba, ready to use its vehicles to move towards Derna, Barce or Mechili.

On 24 March, Rommel advanced with the new &quot;Deutsches Afrikakorps&quot; (&quot;DAK&quot;). The 3rd Armoured Brigade was south-east of Mersa Brega, where the 2nd Support Group held an front; the Australians were to the north, minus a brigade left at Tobruk, deficient in much equipment and out of contact with the 2nd Armoured Division. Allied air reconnaissance had observed German troops west of El Agheila on 25 February and by 5 March, it was expected that the German commander would consolidate the defence of Tripolitania before trying to recapture Cyrenaica and then invade Egypt, using bases at Sirte and Nofilia but not before April. Rommel was identified on 8 March but local intelligence was hard to find under the restrictions to preserve the few troops and vehicles near the front and avoid the danger of the faster German eight-wheeler armoured cars, which inhibited Allied tactical reconnaissance.

On 3 April, Gambier-Parry had received a report that a large enemy armoured force was advancing on Msus, site of the main divisional supply dump. The 3rd Armoured Brigade moved there and found that the petrol had been destroyed to prevent capture. The tank brigade was reduced by losses and breakdowns to and Neame received conflicting reports about the positions of the Allied and Axis forces and news on 5 April that a large Axis force was advancing on El Abiar led him to order the 9th Australian Division back to Wadi Cuff and the elements of the 2nd Armoured Division to guard the desert flank and retire to Mechili. Other reports led Neame to countermand these orders, which caused the Australians much confusion. On 6 April, Allied air reconnaissance reported that there were Axis columns in the desert and the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade repulsed an attack at Mechili, which led to O&#x27;Connor at the Cyrcom headquarters (Neame had left to visit Gambier-Parry) to order a general withdrawal.

====Loss of Mechili====
Rommel had intended to attack Mechili on 7 April but the Axis forces were scattered, short of fuel and tired. Group Fabris moved forward during the morning but the 132nd Armoured Division &quot;Ariete&quot; (&quot;Ariete&quot; Division) and Group Streich took all day to arrive, having been attacked all day by the RAF. A Squadron of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) had appeared from the south, to harass Axis movements. By nightfall on 7 April, the 9th Australian Division (less the 24th Infantry Brigade) and British 2nd Support Group had blocked the &quot;Via Balbia&quot; at Acroma, about west of Tobruk, where the 18th and 24th Infantry Brigades were preparing the defences. (The 18th Australian Infantry Brigade had arrived from Egypt by sea after the dispatch of the 7th Australian Division to Greece had been cancelled.) A small force held El Adem, south of Tobruk to observe the approaches from the south and south-west and at Mechili, Gambier-Parry had the 2nd Armoured Division headquarters soft-skinned vehicles and a cruiser tank, most of the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade, M Battery 1st Royal Horse Artillery, part of the 2/3rd Australian Anti-tank Regiment and elements of other units.

The Germans tried twice to bluff Gambier-Parry into surrender but he received orders from Cyrcom to break out and retreat to El Adem and decided to attack at dawn, to gain a measure of surprise. On 8 April, A Squadron of the 18th Cavalry broke through and then turned to attack Italian artillery, as some Indian troops of the 11th Prince Albert Victor&#x27;s Own Cavalry (Frontier Force) got away. Most of the garrison was pinned down and after a second attempt at when small parties of the 2nd Royal Lancers escaped. The garrison had fired most of its small arms ammunition at the vision slits of the German tanks, which had hung back in fear of mines and when Italian infantry attacked, had little left. Gambier-Parry and Indian and Australian troops surrendered to the 17th Infantry Division &quot;Pavia&quot; (General Pietro Zaglio).

===Supply===

Axis supplies came from Europe and deliveries were moved by road; after Operation Compass only Tripoli remained, which had a maximum capacity of four troopships or five cargo ships at once, about per month. Tripoli to Benghazi was along the &quot;Via Balbia&quot;, which was only half-way to Alexandria. The road could flood, was vulnerable to the DAF and alternative desert tracks increased vehicle wear. The Axis advance of to the Egyptian frontier in early 1941, increased the road transport distance for supplies to . Benghazi was captured in April but coastal shipping could only carry and the port was within range of the DAF. Tobruk could take about per day but lack of shipping made its capture irrelevant.

A German motorised division needed per day and moving the supplies two-ton lorries. With seven Axis divisions, air and naval units, of supplies per month were needed. Vichy France agreed to Bizerta being used for supplies but none passed through until late 1942. From February to May 1941, a surplus of was delivered; attacks from Malta had some effect but in May, the worst month for ship losses, of the supplies arrived. Lack of transports in Libya left German supplies in Tripoli and the Italians had only for deliveries to A record amount of supplies arrived in June but at the front, the shortages worsened.

There were fewer Axis attacks on Malta from June and ships sunk increased from in July, to in September, when Benghazi was bombed and ships diverted to Tripoli; air supply in October made little difference. Deliveries averaged per month from July–October but the consumption of of fuel deliveries by road transport and truck unserviceability of reduced deliveries to the front. In November, a five-ship convoy was sunk during Operation Crusader and ground attacks on road convoys stopped journeys in daylight. Lack of deliveries and the Eighth Army offensive, forced a retreat to El Agheila from 4 December, crowding the &quot;Via Balbia&quot; where Allied ambushes destroyed about half of the remaining Axis transport.

===Tobruk===
Work on the fortifications at Tobruk had begun in March, using the Italian defences, two lines of concrete bunkers away from the port, making a perimeter about long, far enough out to keep artillery out of range of the port. Few intermediate defences had been built by the Italians except at the Bardia–El Adem road junction, the barbed wire was in disrepair and an anti-tank ditch was unfinished. The Allies selected another line about back from the perimeter and worked on this while the original line was refurbished. Two battalions of the Australian 24th Infantry Brigade and the newly arrived Australian 18th Brigade (which had been detached from the 7th Division) took over the perimeter and the Australian 20th and 26th brigades took up a covering position on the outside until 9 April, while more work was done on the defences. Once inside, the three 9th Australian Division brigades took over the defences and the 18th Brigade went into reserve.

A cadre of the British 3rd Armoured Brigade was refitting at Tobruk, with personnel and equipment sent from Egypt by sea and had a regiment of armoured cars, two composite regiments with 15 light, 26 cruiser and a troop of four infantry tanks. There were 4 25-pounder regiments, two anti-tank regiments and an anti-tank company in each infantry brigade, the British 4th Anti-Aircraft Brigade had sixteen heavy and fifty-nine light guns, all but two Bofors guns being sited around the harbour. Rear area units had accumulated at Tobruk and of the were in base units or local refugees and prisoners of war. Morshead planned an active defence and stressed that, with battalions holding frontages, a break-in should be expected anywhere that the attackers made a serious effort and that it should be eliminated, since there would be no withdrawal.

==Siege==

===Investment of Tobruk===
By 8 April, the most advanced German units had arrived at Derna; but some units which had cut across the chord of the Jebel Akhdar ran out of water and fuel at Tengeder. Heinrich von Prittwitz und Gaffron, the commander of the 15th Panzer Division, was sent ahead with a column of reconnaissance, anti-tank, machine-gun, and artillery units to block the eastern exit from Tobruk as the 5th Light Division moved from the southwest and the 27th Infantry Division &quot;Brescia&quot; advanced from the west. On 10 April, Rommel made the Suez Canal the objective of the and ordered that a breakout from Tobruk be prevented. The next day, the port was invested; but the rush ended with the 5th Light Division on the east side, the Prittwitz group to the south (Prittwitz having been killed), and the 27th Infantry Division &quot;Brescia&quot; to the west. Reconnaissance Unit 3 went on to Bardia, and a composite force was sent on to Sollum to try to reach Mersa Matruh. The British Mobile Force (Brigadier William Gott), on the frontier from Halfaya Pass to Sidi Barrani, conducted a delaying-action around Sollum and Capuzzo.

====El Adem road====

From the 5th Panzer Regiment probed the defences of the 20th Australian Brigade near the El Adem road. The tanks were held off by artillery-fire; German infantry who reached the anti-tank ditch were forced back by Australian infantry. The Germans were surprised, having assumed that the shipping at Tobruk was to evacuate the garrison and planned a night attack by the 5th Light Division for Groups of Axis vehicles were attacked by 45 and 55 Squadrons RAF, which rearmed at the airfields inside the perimeter. The attack began after dark, with an attempt to get over the anti-tank ditch west of the El Adem road in the 2/17th Australian Battalion sector, which the Australians repulsed. Another attempt was made later and by dawn a small bridgehead had been established, where the 5th Panzer Regiment drove through and turned northwards, ready to divide into one column for the harbour and one to move west to stop the escape of the garrison.

The German tanks were engaged head on by the 1st RHA and veered away, only to drive into the path of the British cruiser tanks, waiting hull-down and received anti-tank fire from three sides, losing sixteen of and retreated. The Australian infantry had stood their ground and pinned down the German infantry. As the retreat continued, every gun and aircraft at Tobruk fired into the area and the German 8th Machine-Gun Battalion lost about of its men including its commander Gustav Ponath, for a garrison loss of two tanks and a field gun knocked out. Attacks from the south were abandoned and the 5th Light Division dug in, with the Schwerin Group (renamed after Prittwitz had been killed) to the east. In support, the Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica flew 959 sorties over Tobruk; on 14 April 40 Ju 87s bombed the defences and on day 27 they succeeded in destroying a heavy anti-aircraft battery at Tobruk by swamping the defences with 50 aircraft allowing for an entire &quot;staffel&quot; (12) to concentrate on each gun.

====Ras el Medauar====
On 16 April, Rommel led an attack from the west, with the 132nd Armoured Division &quot;Ariete&quot; reinforced by the 62nd Infantry Regiment of the 102nd Motorised Division &quot;Trento&quot;. The 2/48th Australian Battalion counter-attacked and took In the morning, the 132nd Armoured Division &quot;Ariete&quot; attacked again and some tanks reached the most advanced Australian posts, found that their infantry had not followed and retired after five tanks were knocked out. Morshead ordered the garrison to exploit Axis disorganisation and their inability to quickly dig in on stony ground, through conducting patrols and small sorties. On 22 April, a company of the 2/48th Australian Battalion, three infantry tanks and a troop of 25-pounders, raided a hillock held by the Fabris Detachment south-west of Ras el Medauar; the raiders destroyed two guns and took At the same time a company of the 2/23rd Battalion advanced across the Derna road and in a costly attack, took about from the 27th Infantry Division &quot;Brescia&quot;, which led the Germans to hurry on the 15th Panzer Division from Tripoli.

===Air and sea war===
The defeat of the Axis attacks in April greatly improved the situation in Tobruk but &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; X had sent to Libya from Sicily in February, which flew frequent dive-bomber sorties by day and medium-bomber raids by day and night on the docks, buildings, anti-aircraft sites, artillery positions and the airfields. Westland Lysander aircraft and all but the most essential ground crew of 6 and 73 Squadron were withdrawn to Egypt. At least ten Hawker Hurricane fighters were based at the port during the day and on 19 April, Hurricanes of 73 and 274 Squadrons, intercepted a Ju 87 raid escorted by fighters. After another two days, 73 Squadron was down to five operational aircraft with very tired pilots. By 23 April, three more Hurricanes had been shot down, a further two were damaged and on 25 April the squadron was withdrawn. The fighters of 274 Squadron stayed at Gerawla and 6 Squadron remained at Tobruk to fly tactical reconnaissance sorties. Fighter cover could only be maintained at intervals by the last in the desert; Axis airfields at Gazala, Derna and Benina, were bombed at dusk and night to limit Axis air attacks on Tobruk. The Desert Air Force [so-named from October 1941] flew long-range missions to attack German armour massing near Tobruk in the early stages of the siege. On 12 April, for example, 45 and 55 Squadron Bristol Blenheim bombers, operating from airfields in Egypt, attacked German tank formations near the port. The attack succeeded in breaking up the German advance.

Air Commodore Raymond Collishaw, commanding 204 Group RAF (renamed the Desert Air Force), wrote to Air Marshal Arthur Tedder on 24 April. In his view the situation in the air had rapidly deteriorated. The arrival of two German fighter wings (Jagdgeschwader 27 and Zerstörergeschwader 26) near Tobruk allowed the enemy formations to arrive at great height within ten minutes of an air raid warning, leaving British fighters at lower altitude and a great disadvantage. He remarked attrition had caused &quot;a serious reduction in our fighter force.&quot; The bombardment and close air support operations in the initial phases were carried out by Lehrgeschwader 1, III./Sturzkampfgeschwader 1 and II./Sturzkampfgeschwader 2. Collishaw noted the aggression shown by Axis aviation and reported to Tedder that 274 Squadron, which had only 13 fighters available as of 23 April, formed the major part of the fighter defence for Egypt and he was &quot;loathe to send them to Tobruk.&quot; As Collishaw wrote his letter, the RAF lost a further six aircraft over Tobruk, equating to very heavy losses given the small contingent defending the port. He requested Tedder&#x27;s advice. Air Marshal Arthur Longmore cabled the Air Ministry in London. He wished to operate in greater strength, and complained reinforcements and fresh pilots were needed to replace the exhausted 73 Squadron. He told London that to maintain patrols, the fighters were forced to refuel at Sidi Barrani granting Axis air units a free hand over Tobruk but arguing that without patrols to defend fighter squadrons refuelling at Tobruk on the ground, they were &quot;hostage to a fortune we cannot afford.&quot; On 1 May, for example, 274 Squadron lost all six Hurricanes it sent on a single mission when a flight of Bf 109s from JG 27 led by Gerhard Homuth, and containing the most successful fighter pilot in Africa, Hans-Joachim Marseille, engaged them from a superior altitude over Tobruk.

From 1–14 May each side paused to stockpile supplies for the next battle. Of stated losses from 10 April—14 May [excluding claims made by either side], 73 Squadron lost 15 fighters and five damaged. Five pilots were killed, one captured and one wounded. 274 Squadron lost six fighters, three pilots killed and two captured. 45 Squadron suffered the loss of three aircraft and five killed, while 55 and 6 Squadron lost one and two respectively. 39 Squadron lost three bombers and 14 Squadron one for a total of 31 aircraft. Reported German losses, excluding RAF claims, were lower. III/StG 1 and II/StG 2 lost eight between them while III/ZG 26 reported three destroyed and one damaged, two killed, one wounded and three captured. III./LG 1 reported the loss of one aircraft. JG 27 suffered the loss of four fighters, three damaged and three pilots killed. The Regia Aeronautica&#x27;s 151 &quot;Gruppo&quot; reported two aircraft destroyed and one damaged.

The intensity of the battle for air superiority was mirrored by the air war over the sea as the Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica attempted to cut off sea traffic supplying the defenders. The air-sea battle, after the failure of Operation Battleaxe, was the main sector of operations for Allied and Axis aviation throughout the summer. Sturzkampfgeschwader 3, another Ju 87 wing arrived in Africa in the summer. The eight-month long siege was costly for the &quot;Stuka gruppen&quot;. At the end of April, virtually all Tobruk-based fighters had been removed from the encircled port. The Ju 87s were facing defenders with anti-aircraft artillery numbering 88 guns—28 heavy (90 mm or above). Ships lent their weapons to the defenders. In an example, the gunboat &quot;Ladybird&quot;, sunk in shallow waters to her deck by II./StG 2, was able to use her 3-inch deck guns. In April, &quot;Draco&quot;, &quot;Bankura&quot;, &quot;Urania&quot;, and were sunk by Axis aircraft. On 4 May the hospital ship &quot;Kapara&quot; (846t) was damaged evoking fury on the Allied side.

The arrival of Italian Ju 87s from 97 &quot;Gruppo&quot; resulted in the sinking of the 3,741-ton tanker &quot;Helka&quot; on 25 May before it could reach Tobruk. The squadron involved, the 239 &quot;Squadriglia&quot; was the successful unit, which became among the most successful over Tobruk. The escorting sloop, &quot;Grimsby&quot; was damaged, and sunk by 3./StG 1. Commensurate with the sinking of &quot;Fiona&quot; and &quot;Chakla&quot; in April, the burden fell to the Mediterranean Fleet&#x27;s destroyers to carry out supply operations in daylight. Moonlit nights also proved hazardous. On 24 June the sloop &quot;Auckland&quot; was sunk by 239 &quot;Squadriglia&quot;. This unit also sank the destroyer &quot;Waterhen&quot;. The vessel had just survived an attack by Junkers Ju 88s of III/LG 1 and II/StG 2. The lack of fighters made for a straight battle between the gunners and German pilots. The gunners changed their tactics from a sustained barrage at a fixed altitude, to a staggered, and thickened belt, at various altitudes covering 1000 meters or more, thereby forcing the Ju 87s to fly through fire for much longer. The gunners spread their fire from side to side, to prevent German pilots from travelling down the side of the barrage and sliding in underneath it. The &quot;Stukas&quot; were active in night operations. On 26/27 October 1941, I/StG 1 attacked a convoy transporting 7,000 British and Polish soldiers with munitions sailed toward Tobruk. An attack by the Ju 87s sank the &quot;Latona&quot; (2,650 t) with a direct hit—though the vessel could reach 40 knots. The destroyer &quot;Hero&quot; was badly damaged in the same attack.
In March, destroyers were withdrawn from the Inshore Squadron to escort convoys to Greece and in April, four more ships joined the squadron. As the army retreated to Tobruk and the frontier, coastal operations were conducted on the nights of by gunboats, which bombarded transport on the Via Balbia around Bomba and Gambut airfield and on the night of 12 April, six destroyers and two cruisers made a coastal sweep from Ras Tayones to Ras et Tin. Next day, three ships bombarded Sollum and on 15 April, transport was bombarded at Bardia and Capuzzo, as Gazala airfield was shelled again. For the rest of April, naval bombardments continued along the Libyan coast on the Via Balbia, airfields and ports. A Commando raid was carried out on Bardia and supply runs began to Tobruk. From were taken from Tobruk, brought in and of stores delivered; were sunk and 

====Bardia raid====

The Bardia raid was planned for the night of by &#x27;A&#x27; Battalion, Layforce to disrupt Axis lines of communication and damage installations and equipment. The landing force sailed to the area in , escorted by the anti-aircraft cruiser and the destroyers , and &quot;Waterhen&quot;. The Commandos of &#x27;A&#x27; Battalion and a troop of tanks from the Royal Tank Regiment were to land on four beaches from Landing Craft Assault (LCA). On arrival, one LCA could not be lowered and there were difficulties releasing the others. On the run-in, there were no lights to guide them in, because the advance Folbot section had been delayed, when their submarine had to dive and take evasive action when it was mistakenly attacked by Allied aircraft. As a result of these issues the main force was late and landed on the wrong beaches, albeit unopposed. Once ashore the Commandos found that the port was empty of Axis forces and faulty intelligence led to some objectives being missed and others turning out not to exist. The Commandos destroyed an Italian supply dump and a coastal artillery battery before re-embarking. Seventy men got lost, ended up on the wrong evacuation beach and were captured.

===Battle of the Salient===

After the failure to capture Tobruk off the march, &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; and the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW) agreed that Tobruk should be captured and supplies accumulated, before the advance into Egypt was resumed. Rommel thought that Tobruk could only be taken by a deliberate attack, which could not begin until support units had arrived in the area and the Luftwaffe had been reinforced, particularly with transport aircraft to carry ammunition, fuel and water. On 27 April, Major-General Friedrich Paulus, a Deputy Chief of the General Staff, arrived from &quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot; (OKH) in Berlin, to question Rommel on his intentions, impress on him that there was little more help available and to forecast the defensive possibilities of the area, if Sollum was lost. Paulus refused to allow an attack planned for 30 April, until he had studied the situation and on 29 April, allowed the attack to go ahead, as did General Italo Gariboldi who had arrived on 28 April. Nothing more ambitious than securing the Axis hold on the Egyptian frontier, from Siwa Oasis north to Sollum was envisaged.

The Tobruk garrison continued work on the defences and sowed minefields, the first being planted in the south-west, between the outer and inner perimeters. Twelve infantry tanks had been delivered among of supplies landed during the month, despite Axis bombing of the harbour and the sinking of two supply ships. The Axis attack was to be made in the south-west, either side of the hillock of Ras el Medauar, about two weeks after the previous attempt, using the 5th Light Division on the right and the 15th Panzer Division on the left, even though it had only recently arrived in Africa. At on 30 April, the divisions were to break into the Tobruk defences, followed by assault groups from the &quot;Ariete&quot; Division and 27th Infantry Division &quot;Brescia&quot; to roll up the flanks. German infantry would press forward to reconnoitre the vicinity of Fort Pilastrino, to see if the attack could continue to the harbour. If not, the Italian infantry would dig in on the flanks and artillery would be moved forward for an attack the next day.
The attack came in the area held by the 26th Australian Brigade, which had the 2/23rd and 2/24th battalions in the line and the 2/48th Battalion in reserve at Wadi Giaida. The Australians expected an attack, after withstanding bombing and artillery-fire on the perimeter defences on 29 April; Axis troops seen massing in the evening of 30 April had been dispersed by artillery-fire. The posts either side of Ras el Medauar were shelled and bombed and German troops began to dribble forward, under cover of dust and the gathering darkness. By the Germans made a small bridgehead as planned but several Australian posts held out, the reconnaissance party vanished and the Italian troops were not able to reach their objectives. The night passed in confused fighting as the Germans tried to reorganise and mop up at Ras el Medauar and attack south-westwards along the perimeter. The new attack failed and by morning, some of the Australian posts were still holding out.

A thick mist rose and German tanks moved eastwards instead of south-east and then ran into the new minefield, where they were engaged by anti-tank guns and repulsed. Tanks of the 15th Panzer Division, tried to drive north but were prevented by anti-tank fire. No German reserves were left and the most advanced troops were south of Wadi Giaida, tired and isolated in a sandstorm. Paulus judged that the attack had failed and Rommel decided to attack on the right to widen the breach. In the afternoon, German tanks attacked south-east towards Bir el Medauar and Morshead sent and five infantry tanks to counter-attack. The German attack was stopped for a loss of five British tanks and in the evening, the Australian 2/48th Battalion counter-attacked Ras el Medauar but met determined resistance and was repulsed. During the day, 73 and 274 Squadrons had maintained standing patrols over the area and on the morning of 2 May, the fighting around Wadi Giaida continued in a dust storm, as German troops tried to trickle forward. On the night of 3 May, the 18th Australian Brigade made a converging counter-attack with two battalions, which lost co-ordination, failed and was ended, to avoid being caught in the open at daybreak.

The Axis attack had overrun the perimeter defences on a front, to a maximum depth of and captured higher ground useful as a jumping-off position and from which observation points could be established, for a loss of and casualties. The 8th Bersaglieri Regiment of the 132nd Armoured Division &quot;Ariete&quot; had captured most of the Australian positions. Paulus ordered that no more attacks be made, unless the Allies were evacuating the port. The &quot;DAK&quot; was to hold Cyrenaica regardless of who held Sollum, Bardia or Tobruk and a new line was to be built further back at Gazala. In a report on 12 May, Paulus wrote that sea communications between Italy and Libya should be reinforced, that any air and anti-aircraft units sent to Libya should be German and that the army in Libya needed ammunition, fuel and food first, then more vehicles before the dispatch of more men, of whom medium artillery and anti-tank gun crews should have priority. The Tobruk garrison settled into a routine of patrols, air raids and minor attacks, some to regain positions in the Medauar salient and some in connexion with WDF operations.

====Twin Pimples raid====
The Twin Pimples was a defensive strong point outside Tobruk, on two hills close together which overlooked the Tobruk perimeter. It was held by the Italian Army, and the 18th King Edward&#x27;s Own Cavalry (normally part of the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade) held the perimeter opposite. No. 8 Commando was selected to carry out an attack on the Twin Pimples, which conducted patrols for several days with the Indians, to reconnoitre the ground. The 18th Cavalry Regiment was to mount a diversion, while of No. 8 Commando and some Australian Engineers crossed the Italian forward positions and a supply road, to attack the Twin Pimples from behind.

The Commandos advanced at on the night of and crossed the Italian lines undetected. At the supply road they took cover, waited until and edged forward just before the diversion by the 18th Cavalry. The diversion attracted Italian machine-gun fire and Very lights, as the Commandos got within of the Twin Pimples before challenge, at which the commandos attacked. The password &quot;Jock&quot; was used when a position had been taken and the Italians were swiftly overcome. The Australian engineers planted explosives on several mortars and an ammunition dump. The plan assumed that it would take for Italian artillery to open fire on the captured trenches, and the raiders were only about away when shelling began to come down onto the position they had just departed.

==Relief operations==
===Operation Brevity===

Operation Brevity was a limited offensive to inflict attrition on the Axis forces and to secure positions for a general offensive towards Tobruk. The Allies attacked with a small tank-infantry force in three columns and seized the top of the Halfaya Pass, Bir Wair and Musaid, then pressed on and took Fort Capuzzo. The coast group failed to capture the bottom of the Halfaya Pass. The garrison on the east side of the Tobruk defences was strengthened in case of a sortie and a German counter-attack recovered Musaid. The coast group eventually overran the foot of the pass; but, the next day, Allied retirements against German counter-attacks to a line from Sidi Omar to Sidi Suleiman and Sollum, left all but Halfaya Pass in German hands. On 26 May, Operation Skorpion, a German attack on the pass, succeeded and the Allies were ejected. Brevity failed to achieve most of its objectives, only briefly holding the Halfaya Pass. The Allies lost five tanks destroyed and German casualties were three tanks destroyed and several damaged. The Italians had of whom captured. On 12 May, the Tiger convoy lost one ship and arrived in Alexandria with to re-equip the 7th Armoured Division and on 28 May, planning began for Operation Battleaxe.

===Operation Battleaxe===

Operation Battleaxe, was intended to lift the siege of Tobruk and capture eastern Cyrenaica. The attack was to be conducted by the 7th Armoured Division and a composite infantry force based on the 4th Indian Division headquarters, with two brigades. The infantry were to attack in the area of Bardia, Sollum, Halfaya and Capuzzo, with the tanks guarding the southern flank. The Tobruk garrison was to stand by but not to sortie until XIII Corps drew close. The Halfaya Pass attack failed, Point 206 was captured and only one of three attacks on Hafid Ridge succeeded.

At the end of 15 June only tanks remained operational and next day, a German counter-attack forced back the Allies on the western flank but was repulsed in the centre; the Allies were reduced to and On 17 June, the Allies evaded encirclement by two Panzer regiments and ended the operation. The Allies had and were knocked out or broke down and lost; the RAF lost German losses were (Italian losses are unknown), twelve tanks and ten aircraft. General Wavell, the XIII Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Noel Beresford-Peirse and Major-General Michael O&#x27;Moore Creagh the 7th Armoured Division commander were sacked and Claude Auchinleck took over as Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East.

====Australian relief in place====

In mid-1941, Blamey, as commander of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), with the support of the Australian government, requested the withdrawal of the 9th Division from Tobruk. Blamey wrote that the health of the Australian division had deteriorated &quot;to the point where it was not longer capable of resisting attack&quot;; he also wanted to unite Australian forces in the Middle East. Auchinleck agreed but noted that a troop movement this big could only be made by fast warships during moonless periods, to evade air attacks. The Mediterranean Fleet was busy elsewhere, the Inshore Squadron was carrying supplies into Tobruk and Operation Crusader was being prepared. The Australian withdrawal began in the August non-moon period and from of the Polish Carpathian Independent Rifle Brigade and Czechoslovak 11th Infantry Battalion and of stores were landed.

The navy took out of the 18th Australian Infantry Brigade and the Indian 18th King Edward&#x27;s Own Cavalry, on three destroyers, a minelayer and one destroyer carrying supplies, with cruiser escorts as anti-aircraft ships, a cruiser and a destroyer being damaged. From the British 16th Infantry Brigade, 70th Infantry Division (Major-General Ronald Scobie), the HQ of the 32nd Army Tank Brigade and the 4th Royal Tank Regiment with and more of supplies arrived, while of the 24th Australian Infantry Brigade left, with no loss of ships. From the rest of the 70th Infantry Division was delivered and most of the Australians removed. Ship losses on normal delivery runs, led to the 2/13th Australian Battalion and two companies of the 2/15th Battalion remaining in Tobruk. Command of the garrison passed from Morshead to Scobie.

===Operation Crusader===
Operation Crusader began on 18 November 1941, with an outflanking movement that brought the Eighth Army to within of the Tobruk perimeter. It was planned that the 70th Infantry Division would break out from Tobruk on 21 December, to cut the German line of communication to the troops on the border to the south-east. The 7th Armoured Division would advance from Sidi Rezegh, to rendezvous and roll up the Axis positions around Tobruk. The 2nd New Zealand Division, attached to XIII Corps, would take advantage of the distraction of the 21st Panzer Division and 15th Panzer Division and advance to the Sidi Azeiz area, overlooking the Axis defences at Bardia. The 70th Infantry Division attack surprised Rommel, who had underestimated the size of the garrison and number of tanks in Tobruk. A three-pronged attack by the 2nd King&#x27;s Own on the right flank, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch in the centre and the 2nd Queen&#x27;s Own on the left flank, advanced to capture a series of strong points leading to Ed Duda.

By mid-afternoon, the Allies had advanced about towards Ed Duda on the main supply road, where they paused as it became clear that 7th Armoured Division would not arrive. The central attack by the Black Watch, involved a charge under massed machine-gun fire to strongpoint &quot;Tiger&quot;, which incurred 201 casualties. On 22 November, Scobie ordered the position to be consolidated and the corridor widened, ready for the Eighth Army. The 2nd York and Lancaster Regiment with tank support, took strong point &quot;Lion&quot; leaving a gap between the corridor and Ed Duda. On 26 November, Scobie ordered an attack on the Ed Duda ridge and in the early hours of 27 November, the Tobruk garrison captured the ridge and later met a small force of New Zealanders advancing from the south. The 7th Armoured Division had planned its attack northwards to Tobruk for on 21 November. At patrols reported the arrival from the south-east of about The 7th Armoured Brigade and a battery of field artillery turned to meet this threat and without the tanks, the northward attack by the Support Group failed; by the end of the day, the 7th Armoured Brigade had only operational.
On 22 November, the 25th Infantry Division &quot;Bologna&quot; repulsed an attack from Tobruk towards Sidi Rezegh and next day, Rommel sent the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; towards the Egyptian border (the Dash to the Wire) to exploit the victory and destroy XXX Corps. The blow mostly fell on empty desert and gave the Eighth Army time to regroup and re-arm. The &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; was ordered back to Tobruk, where the 70th Infantry Division and the New Zealand Division had gained the initiative. At noon on 27 November, the 15th Panzer Division reached Bir el Chleta and met the 22nd Armoured Brigade (reduced to a composite regiment of fewer than fifty tanks), which was joined later by the 4th Armoured Brigade. As night fell the British tanks disengaged and the New Zealand Division, fighting at the south-east end of the corridor into Tobruk, was endangered by the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot;. On 4 December, Rommel attacked Ed Duda and was repulsed by the 14th Infantry Brigade of the 70th Infantry Division. Rommel ordered a retirement from the eastern perimeter of Tobruk, to concentrate against XXX Corps to the south. On 7 December, the 4th Armoured Brigade engaged 15th Panzer Division and knocked out eleven tanks. Rommel was told on 5 December, by &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; that supply could not improve until the end of the month, when airborne deliveries from Sicily began. Rommel decided to abandon Tobruk and withdraw to Gazala, which led to the relief of Tobruk and the occupation of Cyrenaica.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
For much of the siege, Tobruk was defended by the 9th Australian Division and other troops. Wavell ordered Morshead to defend the port for eight weeks; the Australians held on for over five months, before being gradually withdrawn during September and replaced by the 70th Infantry Division, the Polish Carpathian Brigade and Czechoslovak 11th Infantry Battalion (East). The fresh defenders held Tobruk until they broke out on 21 November and held open an corridor, unsupported for several days, then captured Ed Duda on 27 November, to link with the advancing Eighth Army, during Operation Crusader.
The Tobruk Ferry Service, made up of Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy warships, played an important role in the defence of Tobruk providing gunfire support, supplies, fresh troops and by ferrying out the wounded. Control of Tobruk was useful to the Allies because it was the only significant port east of Benghazi and west of Alexandria. The supply of Axis troops on the Egyptian frontier could have been eased by sea transport to Tobruk. The siege of Tobruk was the first occasion in the war that German Panzer units had been stopped. The siege of Tobruk was lifted in December 1941 in the course of Operation Crusader. Axis forces re-captured the port on 21 June 1942, after defeating the Eighth Army in the Battle of Gazala. During the course of the siege, two destroyers, three sloops, seven anti-submarine vessels and minesweepers, seven store carriers and schooners, six A lighters and one fast minelayer were sunk, a total of 26 ships. Seven destroyers, a sloop, eleven anti-submarine and minesweeping vessels, three gunboats and a schooner were damaged, a total of 23 vessels. Six Merchant Navy ships and a schooner were sunk and six merchant ships were damaged; a total of 62 ships were sunk or damaged.

===Casualties===

The Rats of Tobruk suffered at least there being a small difference in Australian casualty figures quoted in the Australian and British official histories. Most of the Australian garrison withdrew from Tobruk between August and October but others remained in Tobruk for the duration. In Australia in the War of 1939–1945 (1967) the Australian Official History, Maughan recorded 9th Australian Division casualties from including two days before the siege started, as that were captured between 28 March 1941 and the investment of Tobruk and were taken during the siege.

In the British Official History (1956), Playfair calculated the losses in the table created by Harrison in 1999. When Harrison calculated other losses, there was no RAF casualty list but he recorded ten aircrew and six ground crew burials at the cemetery and six aircrew shot down in the harbour. Italian casualties from 15 February to 18 November were and Libyan losses were and German casualties for the same period were about about and from aircraft shot down.

<doc id="902103" wikidata="Q2462463" url="?curid=902103" title="Twombly (cyclecar)">
<text>The Twombly was an American cyclecar manufactured by Driggs-Seabury between 1913 and 1915. The cars had water-cooled, four-cylinder engines, two seats in tandem, and an underslung body. Few of them are still in existence.

The car was designed by Willard Irving Twombly (1873-1953). His largest investor, Reverend David Stuart Dodge petitioned for bankruptcy in 1915 claiming he was owed $428,238 by the Twombly group of companies for loans and interest. Shortly after this, Twombly became involved in an expensive divorce case and was eventually jailed following accusations of bigamy and misconduct.

<doc id="902104" wikidata="Q6637762" url="?curid=902104" title="List of schools in Singapore">
<text>Singapore&#x27;s public schools come under the purview of the Ministry of Education. Singapore has many primary schools and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges, centralised institutes, polytechnics and universities providing tertiary education.

Under the Compulsory Education Act which came into effect on 1 January 2003, all children have to start attending primary school at the age of 7. It is a criminal offence to fail to do so; however, parents may apply for an exemption from the Ministry of Education for their child to be homeschooled or to attend full-time religious institutions.

==Primary schools==
==Secondary schools==
==Junior Colleges and Millennia Institute==

Below is a list of schools offering a two or three-year pre-university education in Singapore, along with the special programmes offered by the schools. The year of establishment in this article reflects the year in which the pre-university programme is implemented, particularly for the Integrated Programme High Schools. All pre-university programmes in Singapore are mixed-sex in tandem with the Ministry of Education&#x27;s (MOE) requirements. These schools can be divided into two groups: junior colleges and centralised institutes.

===Junior colleges (JC)===
These offer two-year courses leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE &#x27;A&#x27; Level or International Baccalaureate examinations.

===Millennia Institute (MI)===
The only centralized institute in Singapore is Millennia Institute (MI), which offers a three-year course leading to the GCE A-level examination in arts, science, and commerce.

===Abbreviations===
&quot;MOE-based programmes:&quot;
*AEP = Art Elective Programme
*MEP = Music Elective Programme
*RSP = Regional Studies Programme
*HSP = Humanities Scholarship and Programme
*CLEP = Language Elective Programme (Chinese)
*MLEP = Language Elective Programme (Malay)
*TLEP = Language Elective Programme (Tamil)
*ELEP = Language Elective Programme (English)
*BSP = Bicultural Studies Programme

==Polytechnics==
==Institute of Technical Education (ITE)==
The Institute of Technical Education campuses were reorganized under the &quot;collegiate system&quot; into three major colleges around the island, a regrouping and renaming exercise which took effect on 1 January 2005. ITE College East was the first to open in Simei in January 2005, and the existing &quot;ITE East Network&quot; campuses were renamed as &quot;ITE College Central&quot; campuses, to be replaced by a new campus in Ang Mo Kio. &quot;ITE West Network&quot; campuses were renamed &quot;ITE College West&quot; campuses, and their new campus will be at Choa Chu Kang.

*ITE College Central (Regional Campus at Ang Mo Kio)
*ITE College West (Regional Campus at Choa Chu Kang)
*ITE College East (Regional Campus at Simei)

==University of the Arts Singapore==

In March 2021, Minister for Education Lawrence Wong announced that Singapore’s first arts university will be established in an alliance between the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and LASALLE College of the Arts, in a system akin to the University of the Arts, London. The formation of the University of the Arts Singapore (UAS) will see both colleges under the umbrella university be given degree-awarding powers independent of their current foreign partners, where the current long-distance degrees are issued through foreign universities. Singaporeans and permanent residents (PRs) enrolled in the approved degree programmes at the university of the arts will pay subsidised fees, comparable to those at autonomous universities here.

The seventh local university of Singapore will be the only publicly-funded private university other than the now defunct and restructured UniSIM in Singapore, and also the only university of the arts with its own degree-conferring power in Singapore slated to open in 2024.

Constituent colleges:
* Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts
* LASALLE College of the Arts

==Universities==
==Specialised tertiary schools==
Government-Affiliated
*BCA Academy
*Singapore Aviation Academy
*IP Academy

<doc id="902105" wikidata="Q297838" url="?curid=902105" title="Jusepe de Ribera">
<text>Jusepe de Ribera (; baptised 17 February 1591 – 3 November 1652) was a Spanish painter and printmaker. Ribera, Francisco de Zurbarán, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, and the singular Diego Velázquez, are regarded as the major artists of Spanish Baroque painting. Referring to a series of Ribera exhibitions held in the late 20th century, Philippe de Montebello wrote &quot;If Ribera&#x27;s status as the undisputed protagonist of Neapolitan painting had ever been in doubt, it was no longer. Indeed, to many it seemed that Ribera emerged from these exhibitions as not simply the greatest Neapolitan artist of his age but one of the outstanding European masters of the seventeenth century.&quot; Jusepe de Ribera has also been referred to as José de Ribera (usual in Spanish and French), Josep de Ribera (in Catalan), and was called Lo Spagnoletto (&quot;the Little Spaniard&quot;) by his contemporaries and early historians.

Ribera created history paintings, including traditional Biblical subjects and episodes from Greek mythology, but he is perhaps best known for his numerous views of martyrdom, which at times are brutal scenes depicting bound saints and satyrs as they are flayed or crucified in agony. Less familiar are his occasional, but accomplished portraits, still lifes, and landscapes. Nearly half of his surviving work consist of half length portraits of workers and beggars, often older individuals in ragged clothes, posing as various philosophers, saints, apostles, and allegorical figures. Ribera&#x27;s paintings, particularly his early work, are characterized by stark realism using a chiaroscuro or tenebrous style. His later work embraced a greater use of color, softer light, and more complex compositions, although he never entirely abandoned his Caravaggisti leanings.

Very little is known about the first 20 years of his life and there are many gaps concerning his later life and career. He was baptized on February 17, 1591, in Játiva, Spain, his father identified as a shoemaker. He is not recorded again until 1611, when records show he was paid for a painting (now lost) for a church in Parma, Italy. Documents show he was a member of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome by October 1613 and living in a house in the Via Margutta in 1615–16, at that time known as &quot;the foreigner&#x27;s quarter&quot;, apparently living a bohemian life with his brothers and other artists. Anecdotal accounts written at the time indicate he quickly earned a reputation as an outstanding painter after arriving in Rome and was earning great profits, but also noted his laziness and extravagant spending.

Ribera moved to Naples in late 1616, under Spanish rule at that time, and in November married Caterina Azzolino, the daughter of Sicilian painter Giovanni Bernardino Azzolini. There he remained for the rest of his life, setting up a workshop with many pupils, securing commissions, and establishing an international reputation. In 1626 he received the Cross of the Order of Christ from Pope Urban VIII. His health began to deteriorate in 1643 and his productivity declined from that time on, and by 1649 he was experiencing financial hardships as well. However, when his health permitted, he continued to produce several acclaimed paintings into the last year of his life.

===Early biographies===

His Italian biographers have many tales to tell of Ribera&#x27;s stormy, picaresque career, and picture &quot;Lo Spagnoletto&#x27;s&quot; life as an endless series of professional intrigues and rivalries, attempted poisonings due to &quot;gelosia di mestiere&quot;, conspiracies and brawls, triumphs and adversities, dramatic love affairs. Alterations of dark patches and dazzling light, glooms and raptures – just as in his paintings. Perhaps we would do better to keep to the records and established dates of Ribera&#x27;s life.&quot; Jacques Lassaigne (1952)

Biographers of Ribera in the 17th and 18th century, including Bernardo de&#x27; Dominici, Carlo Celano, and Palomino de Castro y Velasco produced a substantial amount of information on the artist&#x27;s life that is now known to be erroneous. Much of this misinformation was pervasive well into the 20th century and is occasionally still repeated today. It was long believed he was born in 1587, De Dominici saying he was from Gallipoli, Apulia while Celano stated he was from Lecce. One said he descended from nobility, and another identified his father as a Spanish army officer. Research and documents emerged in the 20th century have proven these false. Other episodes and events in Ribera&#x27;s life remain unverified. Early accounts (still repeated today) state that Ribera began his art education in Valencia, where he was a pupil of Francesc Ribalta. Although this is entirely plausible, there is no real evidence to confirm it.

De Dominici&#x27;s biography described Ribera as an egotistical and condescending individual of reprehensible behavior. He was reputed to have been chief of the so-called Cabal of Naples, his abettors being a Greek painter, Belisario Corenzio and the Neapolitan Battistello Caracciolo. However, there are no real documents or records to substantiate (or discredit) this other than these early biographies. De Dominici&#x27;s biography has been called &quot;barefaced lies&quot; by one modern historian, and &quot;a caricature&quot; by another, although the latter noted a critical examination of it can still provide some insights.

===Early life (1591–1616)===

Little information is available on Ribera&#x27;s youth. It was as recent as 1923 that the year of his birth was positively established. He was baptized on February 17, 1591, in Játiva, Spain, about 60 km. (37 mi.) south of Valencia. His parents were identified as Simón and Margarita (née Cucó) Ribera, married in 1588, and his father&#x27;s occupation a shoemaker. Other baptismal records show the couple had two other sons, Jerónimo (b.1588) and Juan (b.1593). A gap of 20 years follows his baptism record, including information regarding his childhood, education, teachers, and when he left Spain.

Ribera&#x27;s move to the Italian peninsula and his training as an artist have been subjects of interest to art historians in recent decades. His 18th century biographer Palomino wrote that he apprenticed with the Spanish painter Francesc Ribalta in Valencia, and this was generally accepted by historians into the mid to late 20th century, although no proof of this connection exists. Recently, historians have begun to question this scenario. There is some evidence to suggest Ribera might have been in Italy as early as 1608-1609 (age 17 or 18), or even as early as 1605-1606 (age 14 or 15). Marriage records show that his father, Simón, married a second time in 1597 when Jusepe was six years old, and a third time in 1607 when he was 16, suggesting some disruption and lack of continuity in Ribera youth. Recent decades have also shed light on Ribera&#x27;s presumed teacher Francesc Ribalta, whose early works exhibit a mannerist style, and is now known to have only reached his final and mature period, reflecting a realist and Caravaggesque current about 1614, at which point Ribera is already documented working in Italy. Some historians also believe Ribera&#x27;s drawing technique shows a thoroughly Italian education and influences.
Records show Ribera was in Parma, Italy in June 1611, where he received payment for a painting of &quot;Saint Martin Sharing His Cloak with a Beggar&quot;, for the Church of San Prospero. It is notable and some indication of Ribera&#x27;s reputation that a foreigner, at the age 20, was given a commission for a public altarpiece. Ludovico Carracci wrote in 1618, that Ribera was under the protection of the ducal family (House of Farnese) while in Parma which aroused some resentment from local artist. The painting, now lost, is known from copies and prints and was often praised in the local literature until it was taken by Napoleon&#x27;s troops.

The artist is next confirmed in Rome in October 1613, where records show he was a member of the Accademia di San Luca. Parish registries (&quot;Status animarum&quot;) verify he observed Easter in 1615 and 1616 and was living in a house on the Via Margutta, then known as the foreigners quarter, with others including his brothers Jerónimo, and Juan who is also known to have been a painter. At that time Rome was the most important center of painting, &quot;the fountainhead of the Baroque&quot;, where artist from throughout Europe gravitated, including painters such as Gerrit van Honthorst from the Netherlands, Simon Vouet from France, Adam Elsheimer from Germany, and many others, all exploring various aspects of chiaroscuro and tenebrism in the wake of Caravaggio. The last records of the artist in Rome are a payment of promised alms to the Accademia de San Luca in May 1616, and a bank transaction in July 1616.
In his &quot;Considerazioni sulla pittura&quot; (1614–1621) Giulio Mancini wrote a brief account of Ribera&#x27;s time in Rome. He stated that Guido Reni was an admirer of Ribera&#x27;s work and that a painter of Ribera&#x27;s disposition had not been seen in the city for many years, exceptionally high praise in reference to an art center like Rome. He characterized Ribera as a follower of Caravaggio, but more experimental and bolder. According to Mancini, Ribera began working for daily wages in other artists workshops and in time developed a strong reputation and was making great profits. He wrote that Ribera had some problems with Roman authorities when he neglected his Easter confession one year (likely 1614 or earlier). Mancini stated that Ribera could also be lazy at times, indulged in extravagant spending, and that he left Rome in order to avoid his creditors.

===Neapolitan period (1616–1643)===
The Kingdom of Naples was part of the Spanish Empire during Ribera&#x27;s lifetime, and was ruled by a succession of Spanish Viceroys. In 1616, Ribera moved to Naples permanently, in order to avoid his creditors (according to Giulio Mancini, who described him as living beyond his means despite a high income). In November, 1616, Ribera married Caterina Azzolino, the daughter of a Sicilian-born Neapolitan painter, Giovanni Bernardino Azzolino, whose connections in the Neapolitan art world helped to establish Ribera early on as a major figure whose presence was to have a lasting impact on the art of the city. His Spanish nationality aligned him with the small Spanish governing class in the city, as well as with important collectors and art dealers from the Spanish Netherlands. At this point Ribera began to sign his work as &quot;Jusepe de Ribera, español&quot; (&quot;Jusepe de Ribera, Spaniard&quot;). He was able to quickly attract the attention of the Viceroy, Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Duke of Osuna, another recent arrival, who gave him a number of major commissions, which showed the influence of Guido Reni.

Few paintings survive from 1620 to 1626, but this was the period in which most of his best prints were produced. These were at least partly an attempt to attract attention outside of Ribera&#x27;s Neapolitan circles. His career picked up in the late 1620s, and he was accepted as the leading painter in Naples thereafter. He received the Order of Christ of Portugal from Pope Urban VIII in 1626.

Although Ribera never returned to Spain, many of his paintings were taken back by returning members of the Spanish governing class, such as the Duke of Osuna, and his etchings were brought to Spain by dealers. His influence can be seen in the works of Velázquez, Murillo, and most other Spanish painters of the period.

He has been characterized as selfishly protecting his prosperity, and is reputed to have been chief of the so-called Cabal of Naples, his abettors being a Greek painter, Belisario Corenzio and the Neapolitan Giambattista Caracciolo.

It is said this group aimed to monopolize Neapolitan art commissions, using intrigue, sabotage of work in progress, and even personal threats of violence to frighten away outside competitors such as Annibale Carracci, the Cavalier d&#x27;Arpino, Guido Reni, and Domenichino. All of them were invited to work in Naples, but found the place inhospitable. The cabal disbanded at the time of Domenichino&#x27;s death in 1641.

Ribera&#x27;s pupils included Hendrick de Somer, Francesco Fracanzano, Luca Giordano, and Bartolomeo Passante. He was followed by Giuseppe Marullo and influenced the painters Agostino Beltrano, Paolo Domenico Finoglio, Giovanni Ricca, and Pietro Novelli.

===Later life (1644–1652)===
Around 1644, his daughter married a Spanish nobleman in the administration, who died soon after. From 1644, Ribera&#x27;s ill health greatly reduced his ability to work, although his workshop continued to produce works under his direction. In 1647–1648, during the uprising against Spanish rule, he and his family took refuge in the palace of the Viceroy. In 1651 he sold his home, and was in dire financial straits by the time of his death in September 1652.

==Work==

His early style was influenced by the study of the Spanish and Venetian masters as well as Caravaggio and Correggio. His subject matter was notoriously gruesome, portraying human cruelty and violence with startling naturalism. In the early 1630s his style shifted from stark tenebrism to a more diffused lighting, as seen in &quot;The Clubfoot&quot; of 1642.

Nearly half of Ribera&#x27;s entire oeuvre consist of half-length representations of saints, apostles, philosophers, scientists, and allegorical figures. The models for these paintings were the natives from the streets of Rome and Naples, typically humble people such as fishermen, dockworkers, elderly people, and beggars, often characterized by wrinkled skin and ragged clothes, painted with a raw visual intensity.

Ribera’s landscapes were recorded in 18th and 19th century inventories and have been praised in historical literature. However, it was not until the late 20th century when a pair of large canvases (127 x 269 cm.) executed in 1639, were identified in the collection of the Palacio de Monterrey, Salamanca, that surviving examples of his pure landscape paintings were known modern scholars. Landscapes are rare subjects in Spanish painting before the 19th century. Among the very few examples are two small oils executed by Velázquez on a visit to Italy. Contemporary historians have remarked on the originality of Ribera’s approach to the subject and noted a contrast with Roman landscape painting of the period, exemplified in the work of Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain. 
Art historian Alfonso Emilio Pérez Sánchez, former director of the Prado Museum, wrote that these landscapes “assure Ribera a principal place in the history of Neapolitan landscape painting” and that “Ribera has given the landscapes his own stamp: even without the signature they would be recognizable as his.” 

He executed several fine male portraits and a self-portrait. The only equestrian portrait painted by Ribera, depicting Philip IV&#x27;s son and viceroy of Naples John Joseph of Austria, is exhibited in the Royal Collections Gallery. 

He was an important etcher—indeed, the most significant Spanish printmaker before Goya—producing about forty prints, nearly all in the 1620s. 

Some major works include &quot;Saint Januarius Emerging from the Furnace&quot; in Naples Cathedral; the &quot;Descent from the Cross&quot; in the Certosa di San Martino, Naples; the &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; (1650) in the Louvre; the &quot;Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew&quot; in the Museu Nacional d&#x27;Art de Catalunya, Barcelona; and the &quot;Pieta&quot; in the sacristy of San Martino, Naples. His mythologic subjects are often as violent as his martyrdoms, the most famous being his renditions of &quot;Apollo and Marsyas,&quot; now in Brussels and Naples, and his &quot;Tityos&quot;, now in the Museo del Prado. Alongside eleven drawings, the Prado owns fifty-six paintings and another six attributed to Ribera such as &quot;Jacob’s Dream&quot; (1639), &quot;The Martyrdom of Saint Philip&quot; (1639; often described as Saint Bartholomew due to overlapping iconography) or &quot;Saint Jerome Writing&quot; (1644), credited to him by Gianni Papi, a Caravaggio expert; the Louvre contain four of his paintings and seven drawings; the National Gallery, London owns three; and the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando owns an ensemble of five paintings including &quot;The Assumption of Mary Magdalene&quot; from El Escorial, and an early &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; or &quot;The head of St John the Baptist&quot;.

==Legacy==

Salvator Rosa and Luca Giordano were his most distinguished followers, who may have been his pupils; others were also Giovanni Do, the Flemish painter Hendrick de Somer (known in Italy as &#x27;Enrico Fiammingo&#x27;), Michelangelo Fracanzani, and Aniello Falcone, who was the first considerable painter of battle-pieces.

Ribera&#x27;s work remained in fashion after his death, largely through the adoption of his hyper-naturalistic depictions of violence in the paintings of pupils like Luca Giordano. The gradual rehabilitation of his international reputation was aided by exhibitions in Princeton in 1973, of his prints and drawings, and of works in all media in London at the Royal Academy in 1982 and in New York at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1992. Since then his &quot;oeuvre&quot; has gained more attention from critics and scholars. In 2006, a catalogue raisonné of Ribera&#x27;s work was published, written by the former director of the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, Nicola Spinosa.

<doc id="902122" wikidata="Q5470336" url="?curid=902122" title="Formula Woman">
<text>Formula Woman, which was known as the Privilege Insurance Formula Woman Championship for sponsorship reasons, is a female-only one make racing series started in the UK. It was inspired by the lack of female drivers in other series and was created, amongst other reasons, to boost the female audience of the sport. Despite the use of the world formula in its name, the series has not used single-seaters.

It began in 2004 and ran until 2006. Formula Woman returned in 2021.

==2004–2006==
In 2004, all 16 drivers raced Mazda RX-8s over seven rounds around four British racing circuits. For 2005, support was dropped by Mazda and instead drivers competed in Caterham 7s.

===2004===
The inaugural season of Formula Woman was based around a television series on ITV. Thousands of women applied to join, with ultimately 17 drivers being chosen to compete. Experienced motoring journalist Vicki Butler-Henderson hosted the ITV show, while racing drivers Katherine Legge and Tim Harvey were both part of the judging panel. Legge left for unknown reasons early into the selection process.
==== Race calendar ====
====Championship standings====
The 2004 championship was won by Natasha Firman.

===2005===
Formula Woman returned in 2005 using Caterham 7&#x27;s after Mazda withdrew support. The series was run as a Nations Cup. Natalie Butler from England won the 2005 Championship.

====Entry list====
Following the end of the season in November, a novices race weekend was held at Pembrey, South Wales, using exclusive Caterham 7 race cars, with a record 62 women competing. The four race winners were automatically given entry to the 2006 Formula Woman championship.

====Novice Race winners====
===2006===
The series continued in 2006, again using the Caterham 7 car but without any television coverage. Ultimately, Nikki Welsby won the championship.

The series was not renewed for 2007.

==2021–present==
In November 2020, it was announced that Formula Woman would be making a come-back. The series opened for applicants in March 2021 with a view to the series starting in the autumn of the same year with an accompanying television package. The new competition prize offered winners the opportunity to race a McLaren 570S GT4 in the British GT Cup Championship that 16 drivers will compete for.

The series secured major sponsorship including McLaren, Trade Centre, and Vauxhall.

Test days took place at circuits including Knockhill and Anglesey Circuit. The assessments for the final driver decisions took place in December 2021, following a test day at Bedford Autodrome using Vauxhall Corsa-e cars.

In March 2022, the competition progressed to select 15 finalists from 70, with more selections involving a track kart test at Croft to achieve 10, followed by a future final race for four contestants.

<text>Giuseppe Cesari (14 February 1568 – 3 July 1640) was an Italian Mannerist painter, also named Il Giuseppino and called Cavaliere d&#x27;Arpino, because he was created &quot;Cavaliere di Cristo&quot; by his patron Pope Clement VIII. He was much patronized in Rome by both Clement and Sixtus V. He was the chief of the studio in which Caravaggio trained upon the younger painter&#x27;s arrival in Rome.

==Biography==

Cesari&#x27;s father, Muzio Cesari, had been a native of Arpino, but Giuseppe himself was born in Rome. Here, he was apprenticed to Niccolò Pomarancio. Cesari is stigmatized by Luigi Lanzi, as not less the corrupter of taste in painting than Marino was in poetry (Lanzi disdained the style of post-Michelangelo Mannerism as a time of decline.).

Cesari&#x27;s first major work, done in his twenties, was the painting of the right counterfacade of San Lorenzo in Damaso, completed from 1588 to 1589. On 28 June 1589, he received the commission for the murals of the choir vault in the Certosa di San Martino in Naples. From 1591 he was again in Rome, where he painted the vault in the Contarelli Chapel within the church of San Luigi dei Francesi. He also completed murals in the Cappella Olgiati in Santa Prassede, and the vault of the Sacristy in the Certosa di San Martino.

He was a man of touchy and irascible character, and rose from penury to the height of opulence. His brother Bernardino Cesari assisted in many of his works. Cesari became a member of the Accademia di San Luca in 1585. In 1607, he was briefly jailed by the new papal administration. He died in 1640, at the age of seventy-two, or perhaps of eighty, at Rome.

His only direct followers were his sons Muzio (1619–1676) and Bernardino (d. 1703). Pier Francesco Mola (1612–1666) apprenticed in his studio. Other pupils include Francesco Allegrini da Gubbio, Guido Ubaldo Abatini, Vincenzo Manenti, and Bernardino Parasole.

His most notable and perhaps surprising pupil was Caravaggio. In c. 1593–94, Caravaggio held a job at Cesari&#x27;s studio as a painter of flowers and fruit.

<doc id="902125" wikidata="Q2626647" url="?curid=902125" title="Common Management Information Protocol">
<text>The Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) is the OSI specified network management protocol.

Defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.711, ISO/IEC International Standard 9596-1. It provides an implementation for the services defined by the Common Management Information Service (CMIS) specified in ITU-T Recommendation X.710, ISO/IEC International Standard 9595, allowing communication between network management applications and management agents. CMIS/CMIP is the network management protocol specified by the ISO/OSI Network management model and is further defined by the ITU-T in the X.700 series of recommendations.

CMIP models management information in terms of managed objects and allows both modification and performing actions on managed objects. Managed objects are described using GDMO (Guidelines for the Definition of Managed Objects), and can be identified by a distinguished name (DN), from the X.500 directory.

CMIP also provides good security (support authorization, access control, and security logs) and flexible reporting of unusual network conditions.

== Services implemented ==
The management functionality implemented by CMIP is described under CMIS services.

In a typical Telecommunications Management Network, a management system will make use of the management operation services to monitor network elements. Management agents found on network elements will make use of the management notification services to send notifications or alarms to the network management system.

== Deployment ==
CMIP is implemented in association with the ACSE and ROSE protocols. Both are Layer 7 OSI protocols (Application Layer). ACSE is used to manage associations between management applications (i.e. manage connections between CMIP agents). ROSE is employed for all data exchange interactions. Besides the presence of these Layer 7 protocols, CMIP assumes the presence of all OSI layers at lower levels but does not explicitly specify what these should be.

There have been some attempts to adapt CMIP to the TCP/IP protocol stack. Most notable is CMOT contained in RFC 1189 (detailing CMIP over TCP). Other possibilities include RFC 1006 (which provides an ISO transport service on top of TCP), and CMIP over LPP (a presentation layer protocol that can run on top of TCP or UDP).

There is also a form of CMIS that is developed to operate directly on top of the LLC sublayer. It is called the LAN/MAN Management Protocol (LMMP), formerly it was the &quot;Common Management Information Services and Protocol over IEEE 802 Logical Link Control (CMOL)&quot;. This protocol does away with the need for the OSI stack as is the case with CMIP.

== History ==
CMIP was designed in competition with SNMP, and has far more features than SNMP. For example, SNMP defines only &quot;set&quot; actions to alter the state of the managed device, while CMIP allows the definition of any type of action. CMIP was a key part of the Telecommunications Management Network, and enabled cross-organizational as well as cross-vendor network management. On the Internet, however, most TCP/IP devices support SNMP and not CMIP. This is because of the complexity and resource requirements of CMIP agents and management systems. CMIP is supported mainly by telecommunication devices.

<doc id="902131" wikidata="Q358147" url="?curid=902131" title="Francesco Albani">
<text>Francesco Albani or Albano (17 March or 17 August 1578 – 4 October 1660) was an Italian Baroque painter of Albanian origin who was active in Bologna (1591–1600; 1609; 1610; 1618–1622), Rome (1600–1609; 1610–1617; 1623–1625), Viterbo (1609–1610), Mantua (1621–1622) and Florence (1633).

==Early years in Bologna==
Albani was born in Bologna, Papal States, in 1578. His father was a silk merchant who intended his son to go into his own trade. By the age of twelve, however, he had become an apprentice to the competent mannerist painter Denis Calvaert, in whose studio he met Guido Reni. He soon followed Reni to the so-called &quot;Academy&quot; run by Annibale, Agostino, and Ludovico Carracci. This studio fostered the careers of many painters of the Bolognese school, including Domenichino, Massari, Viola, Lanfranco, Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi, Pietro Faccini, Remigio Cantagallina, and Guido Reni.

==Mature work in Rome==
In 1600, Albani moved to Rome to work on the fresco decoration of the gallery of the Palazzo Farnese, which was being completed by the studio of Annibale Carracci. At this time, Rome, under Clement VIII &quot;Aldobrandini&quot; (1592–1605) was exhibiting some degree of administrative stability and renewed artistic patronage. While Pope Clement had been born into a Florentine family resident in Urbino, his family was allied by marriage to the Emilia-Romagna and the Farnese, since Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma had married Margherita Aldobrandini. Parma, like Bologna, being part of the Region of Emilia-Romagna, it was not surprising that Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, Ranuccio&#x27;s brother, chose to patronise the Carraccis from Bologna, thereby establishing Bolognese dominance of Roman fresco painting for nearly two decades.

Albani became one of Annibale&#x27;s most prominent apprentices. Using Annibale&#x27;s designs and assisted by Lanfranco and Sisto Badalocchio, Albani completed frescoes for the San Diego Chapel in San Giacomo degli Spagnoli between 1602 and 1607. In 1606–7, Albani completed the frescoes in the Palazzo Mattei di Giove in Rome. He later completed two other frescoes in the same palace, also on the theme of &quot;Life of Joseph&quot;.

In 1609, he completed the ceiling of a large hall with &quot;Fall of Phaeton and Council of the Gods&quot; for the Palazzo Giustiniani (now Palazzo Odescalchi) at Bassano (di Sutri) Romano. This work was commissioned by Vincenzo Giustiniani, also famous as a patron of Caravaggio.

During 1612–14, Albani completed the Choir frescoes at the church of Santa Maria della Pace which had just been remodelled by Pietro da Cortona. In 1616 he painted ceiling frescoes of &quot;Apollo and the Seasons&quot; at Palazzo Verospi in Via del Corso for the cardinal Fabrizio Verospi.

In his later years, Albani developed a mutual, though respectful, rivalry with the more successful Guido Reni, who was also heavily patronized by the Aldobrandini, and under whom Albani had worked at the chapel of the Palazzo del Quirinale.

Albani&#x27;s best frescoes are those on mythological subjects. Among the best of his sacred subjects are a &quot;St Sebastian&quot; and an &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot;, both in the church of San Sebastiano fuori le Mura in Rome. He was among the Italian painters to devote himself to painting cabinet pictures. His mythological subjects include &quot;The Sleeping Venus&quot;, &quot;Diana in the Bath&quot;, &quot;Danaë Reclining&quot;, &quot;Galatea on the Sea&quot;, and &quot;Europa on the Bull&quot;. A rare etching, the &quot;Death of Dido&quot;, is attributed to him. Carlo Cignani, Andrea Sacchi, Francesco Mola, and Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi were among his students. Following the death of his wife he returned to Bologna, where he married a second time and lived until his death.

==Legacy==
Albani never acquired the monumentality or tenebrism that was quaking the contemporary world of painters, and is often derided for his lyric, cherubim-filled sweetness, which often has not yet shaken the mannerist elegance. While Albani&#x27;s thematic would have appealed to Poussin, he lacked the Frenchman&#x27;s muscular drama. His style sometimes seems to have more in common with the decorative Rococo than with the painting of his own time.

Among his pupils were his brother Giovanni Battista Albani, and others including Giacinto Bellini, Girolamo Bonini, Giacinto Campagna, Antonio Catalani, Carlo Cignani, Giovanni Maria Galli, Filippo Menzani, Bartolommeo Morelli, Andrea Sacchi, Andrea Sghizzi, Giovanni Battista Speranza, Antonio Maria del Sole, Emilio Taruffi, and Francesco Vaccaro.

<doc id="902133" wikidata="Q7707367" url="?curid=902133" title="Texas's 1st congressional district">
<text>Texas&#x27; 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives serves the northeastern portion of the state of Texas. As of 2022, the 1st district contained 775,992 people. It consists largely of four small East Texas metropolitan areas—Kilgore, Texarkana, Texas, Longview–Marshall, and Tyler. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index rating of R+26, it is the most Republican district in Texas. It has been represented by Republican Nathaniel Moran since 2023.

The 1st district once encompassed large parts of North Texas and Central Texas, but as the population of Texas grew, the district got smaller until it only encompassed about half of Northeast Texas.

For most of its history, the district was based in Texarkana, but in a controversial 2003 redistricting orchestrated by then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Texarkana was drawn out of the district and moved to the neighboring . Lufkin, Tyler and Longview were added in its place. In the 2021 redistricting, Lufkin was dropped from the district and Texarkana was added back into it.

The district was predominantly rural for much of its history, and thus was far friendlier to electing Democrats to Congress even as most of Texas swung toward the Republicans. The district&#x27;s four-term Democratic incumbent, Max Sandlin, was a particularly severe critic of the DeLay-led redistricting effort, claiming that lumping rural areas with urban ones stifled the voice of rural voters. The 2003 redistricting made the district more urban and Republican, especially with the addition of the Republican strongholds of Tyler and Longview. Sandlin was easily defeated in November 2004 by Republican Louie Gohmert, a longtime judge in the Tyler area. Gohmert was the first Republican to represent the district since Reconstruction. Proving just how Republican the reconfigured district is, Gohmert was reelected seven times with no less than 68 percent of the vote. The Democrats chose to not put up a candidate in 2008 and 2012. In 2022, Moran was elected to succeed Gohmert, with nearly 80% of the vote, becoming only the second Republican to represent the district since Reconstruction.

The district&#x27;s best-known congressman, Wright Patman, represented the district for 47 years—the second-longest tenure of any Texan in Congress. He was an early supporter of the New Deal, and later chaired the House Banking Committee for 12 years.

==2012 redistricting==
The 2012 redistricting process changed the district&#x27;s northern section. All of Marion County, Cass County, and most of Upshur County were removed from the district. To compensate, the eastern half of Wood County was added. Prior to this, the district included a population of 651,619 in the 2000 census. Additionally, the population broke down accordingly: 
* Under 18: 26.2%
* Over 65: 14.1%
* Married 58.7%
* Non-Hispanic White: 71%
* Black: 18%
* Hispanic: 9%
* Asian: 1%
* Foreign born: 5.3%
* Language other than English: 9.8%
* Median household income: $33,461
* Owner-occupied housing: 71.9%
* Income above $200K: 1.4%

<text>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Freytag (19 September 1788 – 16 November 1861) was a German philologist.

== Background ==
Freytag was born in Lüneburg. He studied philology and theology at the University of Göttingen, where from 1811 to 1813 he worked as a theological tutor. In the latter year he accepted an appointment as a sub-librarian at Königsberg. In 1815 he became a chaplain in the Prussian army, and in that capacity visited Paris.

On the proclamation of peace (Treaty of Paris (1815)), Freytag resigned his chaplaincy, and returned to his investigations of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish languages, studying at Paris under Silvestre de Sacy. In 1819 he was appointed to the professorship of oriental languages at the recently founded University of Bonn, a post he maintained up until his death in 1861.

== Published works ==
Freytag&#x27;s principal work was the acclaimed &quot;Lexicon Arabico-Latinum&quot; (Halle, 1830–1837), an abridgment of which was published in 1837. The lexicon was an improved and enlarged edition of an earlier work by Jacobus Golius. Other significant writings by Freytag include:
* &quot;Selecta ex Historia Halebi&quot;, 1819; selections of Ibn al-Adim&#x27;s history of Aleppo.
* &quot;Hamasae Carmina cum Tebrisii scholiis integris&quot; by Abu Tammam, 1828–1852 – edition of Arabic songs (2 volumes).
* &quot;Darstellung der arabischen Verskunst&quot;, 1830 – a treatise on Arabic versification.
* &quot;Kurzgefasste Grammatik der hebräischen Sprache&quot;, 1835 – a compendium of Hebrew grammar.
* &quot;Arabum proverbia; vocalibus instruxit, latine vertit&quot;, 1838–1843 – Arabic proverbs (3 volumes). (Translation, original by Meidani, who died 1124) 
* &quot;Einleitung in das Studium der arabischen Sprache&quot;, 1861 – Introduction to the study of Arabic language.

<text>George Perkins Marsh (March 15, 1801July 23, 1882), an American diplomat and philologist, is considered by some to be America&#x27;s first environmentalist and by recognizing the irreversible impact of man&#x27;s actions on the earth, a precursor to the sustainability concept, although &quot;conservationist&quot; would be more accurate. The Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park in Vermont takes its name, in part, from Marsh. His 1864 book &quot;Man and Nature&quot; had a great impact in many parts of the world.

== Biography ==

George Perkins Marsh was born in Woodstock, Vermont, to a prominent family. His father, Charles Marsh, had been a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. George Marsh graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts, in 1816 and from Dartmouth College with highest honors in 1820 and taught at Norwich University the following year. He studied law in Burlington, Vermont, was admitted to the bar in 1825, and practiced law in Burlington. He also devoted himself to philological studies. In 1835 he was appointed to the Executive Council of Vermont, and from 1843 to 1849 was a Whig representative in Congress. He served as an editor of &quot;Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley&quot; which was published in 1848.

In 1849 President Zachary Taylor appointed Marsh United States minister resident in the Ottoman Empire. He rendered valuable service to the cause of civil and religious toleration in that empire. In 1852–1853, he discharged a mission to Greece in connection with the imprisonment of American missionary Jonas King. He accomplished this task with a vigor that surprised the diplomats of Athens and showed a masterly knowledge of the Greek constitution and legislation, as well as of international law.

In 1849, Marsh was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

Marsh was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1851.

He returned to Vermont in 1854. In 1857 he was appointed by the governor of Vermont to make a report to the legislature in regard to the artificial propagation of fish. He had previously been appointed one of the commissioners to rebuild the state house at Montpelier and in 1857 was appointed as the state railroad commissioner, succeeding Charles Linsley.

In 1861, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Marsh the first United States minister to the Kingdom of Italy. Marsh would go on to be the longest-serving chief of mission in U.S. history, serving as envoy for 21 years until his death at Vallombrosa in 1882. He is buried at the Protestant Cemetery in Rome.

==Work==
Marsh was an able linguist, able to both speak and write fluently in Swedish and over 20 other languages. He was a remarkable philologist for his day, and a scholar of great breadth, knowing much of military science, engraving and physics, as well as Icelandic, which was his specialty. He wrote many articles for Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Universal Cyclopaedia&quot;, and contributed many reviews and letters to &quot;The Nation&quot;.

He was an admirer of the Goths, whose presence he traced in whatever is great and peculiar in the character of the founders of New England. He owned the finest collection of Scandinavian literature outside of Scandinavia. Part of it ultimately became the property of the University of Vermont, through the liberality of Frederick Billings. During the winter of 1858/9 he began a course of thirty lectures on the English language at Columbia University, and a year later he delivered a second course, on the grammatical history of English literature, before the Lowell Institute, in Boston. Marsh played a role in the creation of the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary by acting as Coordinator of the American readers.

In 1847 Marsh gave a speech to the Agricultural Society of Rutland County, Vermont, adhering to the idea that man&#x27;s activities influence local and regional climate by cutting and clearing forests, and draining swamps. This was a common debate among philosophers, naturalists, and local elites on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean during the Enlightenment era, including David Hume, Comte de Buffon, Thomas Jefferson, Hugh Williamson, Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Lyell, and many others in the turn of the eighteenth to the nineteenth centuries:

&quot;Man cannot at his pleasure command the rain and the sunshine, the wind and frost and snow, yet it is certain that climate itself has in many instances been gradually changed and ameliorated or deteriorated by human action. The draining of swamps and the clearing of forests perceptibly affect the evaporation from the earth, and of course the mean quantity of moisture suspended in the air. The same causes modify the electrical condition of the atmosphere and the power of the surface to reflect, absorb and radiate the rays of the sun, and consequently influence the distribution of light and heat, and the force and direction of the winds. Within narrow limits too, domestic fires and artificial structures create and diffuse increased warmth, to an extent that may affect vegetation. The mean temperature of London is a degree or two higher than that of the surrounding country, and Pallas believed, that the climate of even so thinly a peopled country as Russia was sensibly modified by similar causes.&quot;

His book &quot;Man and Nature&quot; (1864) constituted an early work of ecology, and played a role in the creation of the Adirondack Park. Marsh argued that deforestation could lead to desertification. Referring to the clearing of once-lush lands surrounding the Mediterranean, he asserted &quot;the operation of causes set in action by man has brought the face of the earth to a desolation almost as complete as that of the moon.&quot; He argued that welfare is secured as long as man manages resources and keep them in good condition. Welfare of future generations should be one of resource management determinants. Resource scarcity is a result of misbalancing an environmental equilibrium. In other words: it comes from unreasonable human action rather than is determined by some absolute resource scarcity. He also studied the work of the Italian foresters, particularly Adolf von Berenger and was influenced by the approaches to forest restoration. Marsh was visiting Berenger at the forestry institute in Vallombrosa at the time of his death.

==Works==

*&quot;A Compendious Grammar of the Old Northern or Icelandic Language&quot; (1838), compiled and translated from the grammars of Rask
*&quot;The Camel, his Organization, Habits, and Uses, with Reference to his Introduction into the United States&quot; (1856)
*&quot;Lectures on the English Language&quot; (1860)
*&quot;The Origin and History of the English Language&quot; (1862; revised ed., 1885)
*&quot;Man and Nature&quot; (1864; Italian tr. 1872)
*&quot;The Earth as Modified by Human Action&quot; (1874; rev. ed., 1885), a largely rewritten version of &quot;Man and Nature&quot;
* &quot;Mediaeval and Modern Saints and Miracles&quot; (1876)

He prepared an American edition of Hensleigh Wedgwood&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of English Etymology&quot; (New York, 1862), to which he made large additions and annotations. He translated Rask&#x27;s &quot;Icelandic Grammar&quot;.

==Family==
His second wife, Caroline (Crane) Marsh (1816–1901), whom he married in 1839, published &quot;Wolfe of the Knoll and other Poems&quot; (1860), and the &quot;Life and Letters of George Perkins Marsh&quot; (New York, 1888). This last work was left incomplete, the second volume never having been published. She also translated from the German of Johann C. Biernatzki (1795–1840), &quot;The Hallig; or the Sheepfold in the Waters&quot; (1856). (See &quot;Hallig&quot;).

==Art collection==
Marsh actively studied and collected engravings, including European Old Master prints. His collection included more than a thousand prints by various artists, dating from the 15th to the 19th centuries, representing works by Rembrandt, Albrecht Dürer, William Hogarth and others. In 1849, the Smithsonian Institution purchased a large group of Marsh&#x27;s European prints and art books, which was transferred on deposit to the Library of Congress in 1865. During the 1880s and 1890s, the Smithsonian got some of the Marsh Collection returned, but part of it still remains at the Library of Congress.

<doc id="902142" wikidata="Q642932" url="?curid=902142" title="British Indian Army">
<text>The Indian Army during British rule, also referred to as the British Indian Army, was the main military force of India until national independence in 1947. Formed in 1895 by uniting the three Presidency armies, it was responsible for the defence of both British India and the princely states, which could also have their own armies. As stated in the &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of India&quot;, the &quot;British Government has undertaken to protect the dominions of the Native princes from invasion and even from rebellion within: its army is organized for the defence not merely of British India, but of all possessions under the suzerainty of the King-Emperor.&quot; The Indian Army was a vital part of the British Empire&#x27;s military forces, especially in World War I and World War II.

The Indian Presidency armies were originally under East India Company command, and comprised the Bengal Army, Madras Army, and Bombay Army. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, all company troops were transferred to the British Crown. In 1879, the Presidency armies were integrated into a system of four Commands with a central Commander-in-Chief. On 1 April 1895, the Presidency armies were dissolved and unified into a single Indian Army, also divided into four Commands, and the term &quot;Indian Army&quot; was officially used by 1903. The Commands were later replaced by two &quot;Armies&quot; in 1908—the Northern and Southern Army—but the Command system was restored in 1920.

About 1.5 million Indian soldiers served during the First World War. The Indian Expeditionary Forces deployed to France, Belgium, east Africa, Iraq, Egypt, and the Gallipoli peninsula, among other regions. Eleven Indian soldiers won the Victoria Cross in the war. During the Second World War some 2.5 million soldiers served, and the Indian Army became the largest volunteer army in history to that point. India itself also served as a key logistical base for Allied operations in World War II.

The force is also sometimes referred to as the Army of the Indian Empire, or Imperial Indian Army. The Indian Army should not be confused with the &quot;Army of India&quot;, which was the &quot;Indian Army&quot; plus the &quot;British Army in India&quot; (British units sent to India). With the partition of India and Pakistan on 15 August 1947, the army was reconstituted and divided between the two new Dominions, with the process overseen by Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck. Independent India would, however, retain &quot;much of the organizing framework&quot; of the army.

==History==

The Indian Army has its origins in the years after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, often called the Indian Mutiny in British histories, when in 1858 the Crown took over direct rule of British India from the East India Company. Before 1858, the precursor units of the Indian Army were units controlled by the Company and were paid for by their profits. These operated alongside units of the British Army, funded by the British government in London.

The three Presidency armies remained separate forces, each with its own Commander-in-Chief. Overall operational control was exercised by the Commander-in-Chief of the Bengal Army, who was formally the Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies. From 1861, most of the officer manpower was pooled in the three Presidential Staff Corps. After the Second Afghan War a Commission of Enquiry recommended the abolition of the presidency armies. The Ordnance, Supply and Transport, and Pay branches were by then unified.

The Punjab Frontier Force was under the direct control of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab during peacetime until 1886, when it came under the Commander-in-Chief, India. The Hyderabad Contingent and other local corps remained under direct governmental control. Standing higher formations—divisions and brigades—were abandoned in 1889. No divisional staffs were maintained in peacetime, and troops were dispersed throughout the sub-continent, with internal security as their main function. In 1891 the three staff corps were merged into one Indian Staff Corps.Two years later the Madras and Bombay armies lost their posts of Commander-in-Chief. In 1895, the Presidency Armies were abolished and the Indian Army created thereby was grouped into four commands: Bengal, Madras (including Burma), Bombay (including Sind, Quetta, and Aden), and the Punjab (including the North-West Frontier and the Punjab Frontier Force). Each was under the command of a lieutenant general, who answered directly to the C-in-C, India.

The Presidency armies were abolished with effect from 1 April 1895 by a notification of the Government of India through Army Department Order Number 981 dated 26 October 1894, unifying the three Presidency armies into a single Indian Army. The armies were amalgamated into four commands, Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western. The Indian Army, like the Presidency armies, continued to provide armed support to the civil authorities, both in combating banditry and in case of riots and rebellion. One of the first external operations the new unified army faced was the 1899 to 1901 Boxer Rebellion in China. The 1st, 4th, and 14th Sikhs; 3rd Madras Native Infantry, 4th Goorkas, 22nd and 30th Bombay Native Infantry, 24th Punjab Infantry, 1st Madras Pioneers, No. 2 Company Bombay Sappers, No. 3 Company Madras Sappers, No. 4 Company Bengal Sappers, and the 1st Bengal Lancers, among other Indian units, all served during the Rebellion. Numerous Indian soldiers earned the China War Medal 1900 with the &quot;Relief of Pekin&quot; clasp for contributing to the relief of Peking and the International Legations from 10 June to 14 August 1900.

===Kitchener reforms===

The Kitchener reforms began in 1903 when Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, newly appointed Commander-in-Chief, India, completed the unification of the three former Presidency armies, and also the Punjab Frontier Force, the Hyderabad Contingent and other local forces, into one Indian Army.

The principles underlying the reforms were that the defence of the North-West Frontier against foreign aggression was the army&#x27;s primary role and that all units were to have training and experience in that role on that frontier. Furthermore, the army&#x27;s organisation should be the same in peace as in war, and maintaining internal security was for the army a secondary role, in support of the police.

Lord Kitchener found the army scattered across the country in stations at brigade or regimental strength, and in effect, providing garrisons for most of the major cities.
The reformed Indian Army was to be stationed in operational formations and concentrated in the north of the subcontinent. The Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s plan called for nine fighting divisions grouped in two corps commands on the main axes through the North-West Frontier. Five divisions were to be grouped on the Lucknow–Peshawar–Khyber axis, and four divisions on the Bombay–Mhow–Quetta axis. However, the cost of abandoning some thirty-four stations and building new ones in the proposed corps areas was considered prohibitive, and that aspect of the plan had to be modified.

Under the compromise adopted in 1905, the four existing commands were reduced to three, and together with Army Headquarters, arranged in ten standing divisions and four independent brigades. The commands comprised: Northern Command, which consisted of the 1st (Peshawar) Division, the 2nd (Rawalpindi) Division, the 3rd (Lahore) Division, the Kohat Brigade, the Bannu Brigade, and the Derajat Brigade; Western Command, which consisted of the 4th (Quetta) Division, the 5th (Mhow) Division, the 6th (Poona) Division, and the Aden Brigade, located in Aden in the Arabian Peninsula; and Eastern Command, which consisted of the 7th (Meerut) Division and the 8th (Lucknow) Division.

Army Headquarters retained the 9th (Secunderabad) Division and the Burma Division under its direct control. The numbered divisions were organised so that on mobilisation they could deploy a complete infantry division, a cavalry brigade, and a number of troops for internal security or local frontier defence. Permanent divisional commands were formed with an establishment of staff officers under a major general.

After the reforms ended in 1909, the Indian Army was organised along British lines, although it was always behind in terms of equipment. An Indian Army division consisted of three brigades each of four battalions. Three of these battalions were of the Indian Army, and one British. The Indian battalions were often segregated, with companies of different tribes, castes or religions. One and a half million volunteers came forward from the estimated population of 315 million in the Indian subcontinent.

Regimental battalions were not permanently allocated to particular divisions or brigades, but instead spent some years in one formation, and were then posted to another elsewhere. This rotating arrangement was intended both to provide all units with experience of active service on the Frontier, and to prevent them becoming &#x27;localised&#x27; in static regimental stations. In contrast, the divisional locations remained constant.
====Redesignating the regiments====

To emphasise that there was now only one Indian Army, and that all units were to be trained and deployed without regard for their regional origins, the regiments were renumbered into single sequences of cavalry, artillery, infantry of the line, and Gurkha Rifles. Regimental designations were altered to remove all references to the former Presidential Armies. Where appropriate subsidiary titles recalling other identifying details were adopted. Thus the 2nd Bengal Lancers became the 2nd Lancers (Gardner&#x27;s Horse).

The new order began with the Bengal regiments, followed by the Punjab Frontier Force, then the regiments of Madras, the Hyderabad Contingent, and Bombay. Wherever possible a significant digit was retained in the new number. Thus the 1st Sikh Infantry became the 51st Sikhs, the 1st Madras Pioneers became the 61st Pioneers, and the 1st Bombay Grenadiers became the 101st Grenadiers.

The Gurkha Regiments had developed into their own Line of rifle regiments since 1861. They were five of these until they were joined by the former 42nd, 43rd, &amp; 44th Gurkha Regiments of the Bengal Army, who became the 6th, 7th, &amp; 8th Gurkha Rifles. The numbers 42, 43, &amp; 44 were allocated respectively to the Deoli and Erinpura Irregular Forces and the Mhairwara Battalion from Rajputana.
The mountain batteries had already lost their numbers two years earlier. Under the 1903 reforms they were renumbered with twenty added to their original numbers. The army had very little artillery (only 12 batteries of mountain artillery), and Royal Indian Artillery batteries were attached to the divisions. The Indian Army Corps of Engineers was formed by the Group of Madras, Bengal and Bombay Sappers in their respective presidencies.

The Queen&#x27;s Own Corps of Guides, Punjab Frontier Force, composed of cavalry squadrons and infantry companies, was renamed the Queen&#x27;s Own Corps of Guides (Lumsden&#x27;s) but stayed numberless. The new regimental numbering and namings were notified in &quot;India Army Order 181&quot;, dated 2 October 1903.

In 1903 the title of the Indian Staff Corps was abolished, and thereafter officers were simply appointed to &#x27;the Indian Army.&#x27; A General Staff was then created to deal with overall military policy, supervision of training in peacetime, conduct of operations in war, distribution of forces for internal security or external deployment, plans for future operations and collecting intelligence. Functions were divided along British lines into two branches; the Adjutant-General, dealing with training, discipline, and personnel, and the Quartermaster-General, dealing with supplies, accommodation, and communications. In 1906 a General Branch was established to deal with military policy, organisation and deployment, mobilisation and war plans, and intelligence and the conduct of operations. The Chiefs of the staff branches answered to the Chief of the General Staff, whose post was held by a Lieutenant-General. To provide training for staff officers, the Indian Staff College was established in 1905, and permanently based at Quetta from 1907.

With no intermediate chain of command, army headquarters was weighed down with minor administrative details. Divisional commanders were responsible not only for their active formations, but also for internal security and volunteer troops within their respective areas. On mobilisation, divisional staffs took the field, leaving no-one to maintain the local administration. Supporting services were insufficient, and many troops intended for the field force were not moved from their old stations into the areas of their new divisional command. These defects became clear during the First World War, and lead to further reorganisation.

The Indian Army Act 1911 legislated the replacement of the Indian Articles of War 1869. It was passed by the Governor General. It was under aspects of this law that the Army charged defendants during the Indian National Army Trials in 1945. It was replaced by the &quot;Indian Army Act, 1950&quot; after partition and independence.

===First World War===


Prior to the outbreak of the First World War, the strength of the British Indian Army was 215,000. Either in 1914 or before, a ninth division had been formed, the 9th (Secunderabad) Division. By November 1918, the Indian Army rose in size to 573,000 men.

Before the war, the Indian government had decided that India could afford to provide two infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade in the event of a European war. Some 140,000 soldiers saw active service on the Western Front in France and Belgium – 90,000 in the front-line Indian Corps, and some 50,000 in auxiliary battalions. They felt that any more would jeopardise national security. More than four divisions were eventually sent as Indian Expeditionary Force A formed the Indian Corps and the Indian Cavalry Corps that arrived on the Western Front in 1914. The high number of officer casualties the corps suffered early on had an effect on its later performance. British officers that understood the language, customs, and psychology of their men could not be quickly replaced, and the alien environment of the Western Front had some effect on the soldiers. However, the feared unrest in India never happened, and while the Indian Corps was transferred to the Middle East in 1915 India provided many more divisions for active service during the course of the war. Indians&#x27; first engagement was on the Western Front within a month of the start of the war, at the First Battle of Ypres. In October/November 1914, the Baluchis of the 129th Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own, the first Indian contingent to be in contact with Germans at Hollebeke (and the only to inscribe &#x27;Ypres 1914&#x27;), the sepoy Khudadad Khan maintaining the position until gravely wounded became the first Indian to win a Victoria Cross (Indians were eligible from 1911). In November, after a retreat, a scout section of the 1st Battalion 39th Garhwal Rifles under the leadership of Naik Darwan Singh Negi, then badly injured, reinvested lost trenches. For his gallantry he received the second VC.

Nearly 700,000 troops then served in the Middle East, fighting against the Turks in the Mesopotamian campaign. There they were short of transportation for resupply and operated in extremely hot and dusty conditions. Led by Major General Sir Charles Townshend, they pushed on to capture Baghdad but they were repulsed by Ottoman forces.

In the First World War the Indian Army saw extensive active service, including on the Western Front, notably in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, participated in the Battle of Gallipoli and Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Furthermore, it fought in the Siege of Kut of the Mesopotamian Campaign, and campaigned in East Africa, including the Battle of Tanga.

Participants from the Indian subcontinent won 13,000 medals, including 12 Victoria Crosses. By the end of the war a total of 47,746 Indians had been reported dead or missing; 65,126 were wounded.

Also serving in the First World War were so-called &quot;Imperial Service Troops&quot;, provided by the semi-autonomous Princely States. About 21,000 were raised in the First World War, mainly consisting of Sikhs of Punjab and Rajputs from Rajputana (such as the Bikaner Camel Corps and the Hyderabad, Mysore and Jodhpur Lancers of the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade). These forces played a prominent role in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign.

===Interbellum (1918–1939)===
Elements of the Army operated around Mary, Turkmenistan in 1918–19. See Malleson mission and Entente intervention in the Russian Civil War. The army then took part in the Third Anglo-Afghan War of 1919. In the aftermath of the First World War, the Indian Territorial Force and Auxiliary Force (India) were created in the 1920s. The Indian Territorial Force was a part-time, paid, all-volunteer organisation within the army. Its units were primarily made up of European officers and Indian other ranks. The ITF was created by the Indian Territorial Force Act 1920 to replace the Indian section of the Indian Defence Force. It was an all-volunteer force modelled after the British Territorial Army. The European parallel to the ITF was the Auxiliary Force (India).

After the First World War the British started the process of Indianisation, by which Indians were promoted into higher officer ranks. In a 1923 census, the British Indian Army consisted of 64,669 British-born soldiers and officers, with 187,432 Indian-born soldiers in comparison. Indian cadets were sent to study in Great Britain at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and were given full commissions as King&#x27;s Commissioned Indian Officers. The KCIOs were equivalent in every way to British commissioned officers and had full authority over British troops (unlike VCOs). Some KCIOs were attached to British Army units for a part of their careers.

In 1922, after wartime experience had shown that the maintenance of 130 separate single-battalion infantry regiments was unwieldy, a number of large (four to five battalion) regiments were created, and numerous cavalry regiments amalgamated. The List of regiments of the Indian Army (1922) shows the reduced number of larger regiments. Until 1932 most Indian Army officers, both British and Indian, were trained at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, after that date the Indian officers increasingly received their training at the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun which was established that year.

===Second World War===
At the outbreak of the Second World War, the Indian Army numbered 205,000 men and, as the war continued, this would rise to 2.5 million men to become the largest all–volunteer force in history. During this process, six corps would be raised; which consisted of the Indian III Corps, Indian IV Corps, Indian XV Corps, Indian XXI Corps (served with Tenth Army in the Middle East in 1942), Indian XXXIII Corps and Indian XXXIV Corps. Furthermore, the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 14th, 17th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 23rd, 25th, 26th, 34th, 36th (later converted to an all-British formation), and 39th Indian Divisions were formed, as well as other forces. Additionally there were at one time or another four armoured divisions formed (the 31st, 32nd, 43rd, and 44th), and one airborne division, also designated the 44th. In matters of administration, weapons, training, and equipment, the Indian Army had considerable independence; for example, prior to the war the Indian Army adopted the Vickers–Berthier (VB) light machine gun instead of the Bren gun of the British Army, while continuing to manufacture and issue the older SMLE No. 1 Mk III rifle during the Second World War, instead of the Lee–Enfield No.4 Mk I issued to the British Army from the middle of the war.

Particularly notable contributions of the Indian Army during that conflict were the:
* Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II
** East African campaign
** North African campaign
*** Operation Compass
*** Operation Battleaxe
*** Operation Crusader
*** First Battle of El Alamein
*** Second Battle of El Alamein
** Anglo-Iraqi War
** Syria-Lebanon campaign
** Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran
** Italian campaign
*** Battle of Monte Cassino
* Battle of Hong Kong
* Battle of Malaya
* Battle of Singapore
* Burma Campaign
** Battle of Kohima
** Battle of Imphal

Over the course of the Second World War, about 87,000 Indian soldiers were killed. In this period, 31 Indians were awarded the Victoria Cross (See: Indians in &#x27;List of Victoria Cross Recipients by Nationality&#x27;). Out of the 252 Distinguished Service Orders awarded to the British Indian Army, at least 13 were awarded to native officers (See: South Asian Companions of the Distinguished Service Order).
The Germans and Japanese were relatively successful in recruiting combat forces from Indian prisoners of war. These forces were known as the Tiger Legion and the Indian National Army (INA). Indian nationalist leader Subhas Chandra Bose led the 40,000-strong INA. From a total of about 55,000 Indians taken prisoner in Malaya and Singapore in February 1942, about 30,000 joined the INA, which fought Allied forces in the Burma Campaign. Others became guards at Japanese POW camps. The recruitment was the brainchild of Major Fujiwara Iwaichi who mentions in his memoirs that Captain Mohan Singh Deb, who surrendered after the Battle of Jitra became the founder of the INA.Some Indian Army personnel resisted recruitment and remained POWs. An unknown number captured in Malaya and Singapore were taken to Japanese-occupied areas of New Guinea as forced labour. Many of these men suffered severe hardships and brutality, similar to that experienced by other prisoners of Japan during the Second World War. About 6,000 of them survived until they were liberated by Australian or US forces, in 1943–45.

During the later stages of the Second World War, from the fall of Singapore and the ending of ABDACOM in early 1942 until the formation of the South East Asia Command (SEAC) in August 1943, some American and Chinese units were placed under British military command.

===Post Second World War===
12 September 1946 the minister for external affairs in India, Jawaharlal Nehru demanded in a letter to the Commander in Chief and Defence Secretary, that a large-scale reform should be implemented to improve the Indian Army. Calcutta had been ravaged by large communal riots, but the British Indian Army was able to restore order. Nehru demanded with urgency, that the Indian Army should safeguard India&#x27;s new democracy. Nehru was a nationalist and opposed India&#x27;s &quot;divide and rule&quot; policy.

As a result of the Partition of India in 1947, the formations, units, assets, and indigenous personnel of the Indian Army were divided between the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. As Brian Lapping wrote, &quot;By comparison with the two great provinces [Bengal &amp; Punjab], partition of the army and the civil service was easy, though by any other standard, it was difficult, wasteful, and destructive. ... The men were transferred in their units. Regiments of Sikh and Hindu soldiers from the north-west frontier had to make their way through Muslim territory to get out of what was to be Pakistan.&quot; Also in 1947 a final agreement was signed regarding the Gurkha regiments in the British Indian Army. Four Gurkha regiments, recruited from both eastern and western Nepal, would join the British Army. The remaining six Gurkha regiments of the British Indian Army joined the Dominion of India. During the transition period after partition, those Gurkha regiments that were in Pakistan, did their service, but were eventually moved back to India.

The partition reduced the ethnic imbalance of the British Indian Army, which became the present-day Indian Army. But, the partition resulted in more ethnic imbalance in the Pakistani military, mainly because the new nation state of Pakistan was formed by joining West Punjab, NWFP, East Bengal, Baluchistan, and Sind. The new
Pakistan Army was mainly made up of soldiers from two of these provinces. The Bangladesh Army, which was created from the Pakistan Army on the independence of Bangladesh, retain many British Indian Army traditions.

==Organisation==

The armies of the East India Company were recruited primarily from forward caste Hindus and Muslims in the Bengal Presidency, which consisted of Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and Oudh. This later expanded into the armies of the three Presidencies and provinces of British India.

Writing in &quot;The Indian Army&quot; (1834), Sir John Malcolm, who had a lifetime&#x27;s experience of Indian soldiering, wrote about the Bengal Presidency: &quot;They consist largely of Rajpoots (Rajput), who are a distinguished race among the Khiteree (Kshatriya), or Brhamins (Brahmin) We may judge of the size of these men when we are told that the height below which no recruit is taken is five feet six inches. The great proportion of the Grenadiers are six feet and upwards.&quot;

The meaning of the term Indian Army changed over time, initially as an informal collective term for the armies of the three presidencies–the Bengal Army, Madras Army and Bombay Army–between 1858 and 1894. In 1895, the Indian Army began its formal existence and was the &quot;army of the government of India&quot;, including British and Indian (sepoy) units; this arrangement lasted until 1902.

Many of these troops took part in the Indian Mutiny, with the aim of reinstating the Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah II at Delhi, partly as a result of insensitive treatment by their British officers. During this period, the Company Raj relied heavily upon the armies of Princely states to quell the rebellion.
The officer commanding the Army of India was the Commander-in-Chief, India who reported to the civilian Governor-General of India. The title was used before the creation of a unified British Indian Army; the first reported holder was then-Major Stringer Lawrence in 1748. Lawrence went to India with no larger command than a &quot;small undisciplined garrison of two or three hundred men&quot; facing a significant French presence. In 1903, Lord Kitchener became the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army. He instituted large-scale reforms, the greatest of which was the merger of the three armies of the Presidencies into a unified force. He formed higher level formations, eight army divisions, and brigaded Indian and British units. He left his command in 1909. Following Kitchener&#x27;s reforms, the terminology used for the forces in India was altered. The &quot;Indian Army&quot; referred from that time to &quot;the force recruited locally and permanently based in India, together with its expatriate British officers;&quot; the &quot;British Army in India&quot; referred to the British Army units posted to India for a tour of duty, and which would then be posted to other parts of the Empire or back to the UK. The &quot;Army of India&quot; was used to describe the combined forces of both the Indian Army and the British Army in India.

By the early 1900s the three previous separate army staffs had been amalgamated into Headquarters, India (&quot;see&quot; 1906 Birthday Honours) which by 1922 had become GHQ India (&quot;see&quot; 1922 New Year Honours).

===Command===
Indian Army postings were less prestigious than British Army positions, but the pay was significantly greater so that officers could live on their salaries instead of having to have a private income. Accordingly, vacancies in the Indian Army were much sought after and generally reserved for the higher placed officer-cadets graduating from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. British officers in the Indian Army were expected to learn to speak the Indian languages of their men, who tended to be recruited from primarily Hindi speaking areas. Prominent British Indian Army officers included Lord Roberts, Sir O&#x27;Moore Creagh, Lord Birdwood, Sir Claude Auchinleck (&quot;The Auk&quot;) and Lord Slim.

===Personnel===

Commissioned officers, British and Indian, held identical ranks to commissioned officers of the British Army. King&#x27;s Commissioned Indian Officers (KCIOs), created from the 1920s, held equal powers to British officers. Viceroy&#x27;s Commissioned Officers were Indians holding officer ranks. They were treated in almost all respects as commissioned officers, but had authority over Indian troops only, and were subordinate to all British King&#x27;s (and Queen&#x27;s) Commissioned Officers and KCIOs. They included Subedar Major or Risaldar-Major (Cavalry), equivalents to a British Major; Subedar or Risaldar (Cavalry) equivalents to Captain; and Jemadars equivalent to Lieutenant.

Recruitment was entirely voluntary; about 1.75 million men served in the First World War, many on the Western Front and 2.5 million in the Second. Non-Commissioned Officers included Company Havildar Majors equivalents to a Company Sergeant Major; Company Quartermaster Havildars, equivalents to a Company Quartermaster Sergeant; Havildars or Daffadars (Cavalry) equivalents to a Sergeant; Naik or Lance-Daffadar (Cavalry) equivalents to a British Corporal; and Lance-Naik or Acting Lance-Daffadar (Cavalry) equivalents to a Lance-Corporal.

Soldier ranks included Sepoys or Sowars (Cavalry), equivalent to a British private. British Army ranks such as gunner and sapper were used by other corps.

In the aftermath of the Indian Mutiny of 1857, also called the Sepoy Mutiny by the British, the three armies of the former Presidencies of the East India Company passed to the British Crown. After the Mutiny, recruitment switched to what the British called the &quot;martial races&quot;, particularly Sikhs, Awans, Gakhars, and other Punjabi &quot;Musulmans&quot;, Baloch, Pashtuns, Marathas, Bunts, Nairs, Rajputs, Yadavs, Kumaonis, Gurkhas, Garhwalis, Janjuas, Maravars, Kallars, Vellalar, Dogras, Jats, Gurjar, Mahars and Sainis. Gurkhas had gone into the British army and were known to have rarely rebelled. The Sikhs, after the First and Second Anglo-Sikh Wars, treated the British Army as a replacement for the Sikh Khalsa Army.

<text>Carl Darling Buck (October 2, 1866 – February 8, 1955) was an American philologist.

==Biography==
Buck was born on October 2, 1866, in Maine (either in Bucksport or in Orland).

He graduated from Yale in 1886, was a graduate student there for three years, and studied at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens from 1887 to 1889, and in Leipzig from 1889–1892.

In 1892 he became professor of Sanskrit and Indo-European comparative philology at the University of Chicago, and was later named Martin A. Ryerson Distinguished Service Professor of Comparative Philology.

In his early career, he concentrated on the Italic dialects, including among his published work, &quot;Der Vocalismus der oskischen Sprache&quot; (1892), &quot;The Oscan-Umbrian Verb-System&quot; (1895), and &quot;Grammar of Oscan and Umbrian, with a collection of inscriptions and a glossary&quot; (1904), and a &quot;précis&quot; of the Italic languages in Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Universal Cyclopaedia&quot;. He collaborated with W.G. Hale in the preparation of &quot;A Latin Grammar&quot; (1903).

Later, he worked extensively on the Greek dialects, publishing: &quot;The Greek dialects; grammar, selected inscriptions, glossary&quot; (1910), &quot;Comparative grammar of Greek and Latin&quot; (1933); and on more general Indo-European issues.

His &quot;Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European Languages&quot; was called by Calvert Watkins &quot;a treasure house of words, word origins, expressions, and ideas..., a monument to a great American scholar&quot;.

Buck was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1921 and the American Philosophical Society in 1923.

Upon his death, the New York Times reported that Buck spoke 30 languages. Many of Buck&#x27;s books went through multiple editions, and several are still in print.

<text>Arthur Levitt Jr. (born February 3, 1931) is the former chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He served from 1993 to 2001 as the twenty-fifth and longest-serving chairman of the commission. Widely hailed as a champion of the individual investor, he has been criticized for not pushing for tougher accounting rules. Since May 2001 he has been employed as a senior adviser at the Carlyle Group. Levitt previously served as a policy advisor to Goldman Sachs and is a Director of Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News.

==Early life and career==
Levitt grew up in a Jewish family in Brooklyn. Levitt&#x27;s father, Arthur Levitt Sr., served as New York State Comptroller for 24 years and was sole trustee of the largest pension fund in America at the time. Levitt attended Brant Lake Camp, a summer camp for boys in the Adirondacks. He attended and graduated from Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn in 1948.

He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Williams College in 1952, before serving for two years in the Air Force. He first worked as a drama critic for &quot;The Berkshire Eagle&quot;, and after the Air Force, he was with Time-Life for five years before selling cattle and ranches as tax shelters.

In 1963, Levitt joined the brokerage firm Carter, Berlind &amp; Weill, founded three years earlier by Sanford I. Weill. Levitt&#x27;s name was eventually added to the firm&#x27;s when it was renamed Cogan, Berlind, Weill &amp; Levitt in the mid-1960s; through a series of mergers the firm eventually evolved into Shearson Loeb Rhoades. This experience with retail customers was a source of his interest in the small investor. After sixteen years on Wall Street, Levitt became the chairman of the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) in 1978. In 1989, he left the AMEX to serve as Chairman of the New York City Economic Development Corporation until 1993.

Before joining the SEC, Levitt owned &quot;Roll Call&quot;, a newspaper that covers Capitol Hill, which he purchased from the paper&#x27;s founder, Sid Yudain, in 1986. The newspaper was eventually sold to The Economist for $15 million in 1993.

==Chairman of the SEC==
Levitt was appointed to his first five-year term as Chairman of the SEC by President Clinton in July 1993 and reappointed in May 1998. He left the Commission on February 9, 2001, and was succeeded by Harvey Pitt. Levitt has said that he first learned of his being considered for the job from The Wall Street Journal.

At the time Levitt came to the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) had proposed requiring companies to record stock options on their income statements, which split the accounting industry and was opposed by many in the American business community. According to a Merrill Lynch study, expensing stock options would have reduced profits among leading high-tech companies by 60% on average. Congress began to exert pressure on the FASB, and on May 3, 1994, the Senate, led by Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman, offered a non-binding resolution urging FASB not to adopt the proposed rule; the vote in favor was 88–9. Concerned that insensitivity to this sentiment in Congress might threaten FASB as an independent standard setter, Levitt urged the FASB to not go ahead with the rule proposal. He later said this &quot;was probably the single biggest mistake I made in my years at the SEC.&quot;

In September 1998 at New York University, he gave a speech entitled &quot;The Numbers Game&quot;. It addressed five ways in which corporations were managing earnings (big bath charges, creative acquisition accounting, cookie-jar reserves, materiality, revenue recognition). In his speech, Levitt advocated improving the transparency and comparability of financial statements.

In 1997, the SEC under Levitt&#x27;s leadership approved the exemption of some Enron partnerships from the tight accounting controls of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Without this exemption, critics maintain, the company would have been constrained by strict rules found in 1996 legislation that would have prohibited certain foreign investments and the shifting of debt to its foreign subsidiary shell companies.

During Levitt&#x27;s tenure at the SEC, he was widely viewed as a pro-investor advocate and received favorable press coverage.

==After the SEC==
Levitt serves on the Board of Directors for RiskMetrics Group.

In 2005, Levitt was named a special advisor to the American International Group&#x27;s board of directors and the board&#x27;s nominating and corporate governance committee following the resignation of CEO and Chairman Maurice &quot;Hank&quot; Greenberg, who left after an investigation into the firm&#x27;s accounting practices by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.

Levitt oversaw an audit published in August 2006, by Kroll Inc. – where he is a consultant – describing how the City of San Diego had allowed a pension deficit of $1.43 billion. The report blamed around 30 city officials, including five incumbent council members. Kroll charged the City of San Diego $21 million for the report, with Levitt&#x27;s time billed at $900 per hour.

==Awards and honors==
In January 2001, Levitt received the &quot;Award for Distinguished Leadership in Global Capital Markets&quot; from the Yale School of Management.

The Arthur Levitt State Office Building in downtown Manhattan was named for him until it was sold to private developers in 2000.

He graduated at Harvard University in 1870, and took a post-graduate course in philosophy there in 1874–1876; studied classical philology at Leipzig and Göttingen in 1876–1877; was tutor in Latin at Harvard from 1877 to 1880, and succeeding Tracy Peck as professor of Latin in Cornell University from 1880 to 1892, when he became professor of Latin and head of the Latin department of the University of Chicago. From 1894 to 1899 he was chairman and in 1895-1896 first director of the American School of Classical Studies at Rome. Hale held honorary degrees from Princeton, St. Andrew&#x27;s and Aberdeen Universities.

He is best known as an original teacher on questions of syntax. In &quot;The cum-constructions: their history and functions&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Cornell University studies in classical philology&quot; (1888–1889; and in German version by Neizert in 1891), he attacked Hoffmann&#x27;s distinction between absolute and relative temporal clauses as published in &quot;Lateinische Zeitpartikeln&quot; (1874); Hoffmann replied in 1891, and the best summary of the controversy is in Wetzel&#x27;s &quot;Der Streit zwischen Hoffmann und Hale&quot; (1892). Hale wrote also &quot;The sequence of tenses in Latin&quot; (1887–1888), &quot;The anticipatory subjunctive in Greek and Latin&quot; (1894), and a &quot;Latin grammar&quot; (1903), to which the parts on sounds, inflection and word-formation were contributed by Carl Darling Buck.

After founding the American School of Classical Studies, Rome, 1905–06, Professor Hale served as its director and later, chairman of the board. Returning to Chicago, Hale was Editor, The Classical Quarterly in 1914. He continued his teaching and retired from the university in 1920, spending the next eight years conducting research on a manuscript of Catullus he discovered in Rome in 1896.

He died at his home in Stamford, Connecticut on June 23, 1928.

== Family ==
William Gardner Hale was son to William Hale and Elizabeth Jewett Scott of Peterboro, N.H. Professor Hale married Harriet K Swinburne (1853–1928) of Newport, Rhode Island, an 1873 graduate of Vassar College, on June 13, 1883. The couple had four children, including fresco painter and interior decorator Gardner Hale (1900–1932) of New York City, and Swinburne Hale (1884–1937), a prominent civil rights attorney and political activist of the 1920s. One daughter, Mrs. Vancil Foster, resided at Taos, New Mexico and another daughter, Miss Virginia Hall, resided in New York City.

== Multilateralist ==
When the German Empire invaded Belgium in 1914, Professor Hale was abroad in Europe. He cabled the &quot;New York Times&quot; from Le Havre, France, and permitted his name to be published with his cable recommending the United States declare war on Germany. Six months into the First World War, the Wilson Administration had succeeded in keeping the United States neutral. Professor Hale called for war in September 1914; in January 1915 he was in partial agreement with former President Theodore Roosevelt on the need to act against the German Empire. But like fellow progressive Alfred Hayes, Jr., William Gardner Hale viewed the American role as supporting the internationalist and multilateral position represented by the Hague Conventions. Roosevelt was defining the unilateralist tenet that would become a hallmark of 20th century Republican Party foreign policy doctrine.

In May 1916, Hale agreed to serve as an honorary vice president of the American Rights Committee during its Carnegie Hall memorial protest of the Lusitania sinking by a German Navy U-Boat. The purpose of the mass meeting was to organize a petition to President Woodrow Wilson demanding an end of diplomatic relations with the Imperial Court at Berlin. New York City Mayor John Purroy Mitchel succeeded in postponing the protest, in part to ameliorate worsening relations in the city between the pro-Allied and pro-German factions.

In the 1916 Presidential election, William Gardner Hale endorsed Woodrow Wilson over Charles Evans Hughes. Hale&#x27;s position was based on his concern that Hughes would draw the United States into another war with the Republic of Mexico and that Wilson, while not supportive enough of the Allies in Europe, &quot;had the high aim of building up a national life in which, while honest business shall have every opportunity, privilege shall not rule the poor and the weak. He has made of his party a truly progressive party.&quot; Hale was a member of the New England Anti-Imperialist League, as well as the Phi Beta Kappa Society, the German Archaeological Institute of Berlin, Athens and Rome, and the American Philological Association (APA). He was President of the APA from 1892 to 1893.

<text>Johann Joseph Hoffmann (February 16, 1805 – January 19, 1878) was a German scholar who studied the Japanese and Chinese languages.

==Biography==
Hoffmann was born at Würzburg in the Electorate of Bavaria. After studying at Würzburg, he went on the stage in 1825; but owing to an accidental meeting with the German traveller Philipp Franz von Siebold (1796–1866) in July 1830, his interest was diverted to Oriental philology. From Siebold he acquired the rudiments of Japanese, and in order to take advantage of the instructions of Ko-ching-chang, a Chinese teacher whom Siebold had brought home with him, he made himself acquainted with Malay, the only language except Chinese which Ko-ching-chang could understand.

In a few years he was able to supply the translations for Siebold&#x27;s &quot;Nippon&quot;, and the high character of his work soon attracted the attention of older scholars. Stanislas Julien invited him to Paris, and he would probably have accepted the invitation, as a disagreement had broken out between him and Siebold, had not M. Baud, the Dutch colonial minister, appointed him Japanese translator with a salary of 1800 florins (£150).

==Works==

The Dutch authorities were slow in giving him further recognition; and he was too modest a man successfully to urge his claims. It was not until after he had received the offer of the professorship of Chinese in King&#x27;s College London, that the authorities made him professor at Leiden and the king allowed him a yearly pension. In 1875, he was decorated with the order of the Netherlands Lion, and in 1877 he was elected corresponding member of the Berlin Academy. He died at the Hague on 23 January 1878.

Hoffmann&#x27;s chief work was his unfinished &quot;Japanese Dictionary&quot; begun in 1839 and afterwards continued by L. Serrurier. Unable at first to procure the necessary type, he set himself to the cutting of punches, and even when the proper founts were obtained he had to act as his own compositor as far as Chinese and Japanese were concerned. His Japanese grammar (&quot;Japanische Sprachlehre&quot;) was published in Dutch and English in 1867, and in English and German in 1876.

Of his miscellaneous productions it is enough to mention: “Japans Bezüge mit der koraischen Halbinsel und mit Schina,” in &quot;Nippon&quot;, vii.; &quot;Yo-San-fi-Rok, L&#x27;Art d&#x27;élever les vers à soie au Japon par Ouckaki Mourikouni&quot; (Paris, 1848); “Die Heilkunde in Japan” in &quot;Mittheil. d. deutsch. Gesellsch. für Natur- und Völkerk. Ost-Asiens&quot; (1873–1874); and &quot;Japanische Studien&quot; (1878).

<text>The Centaurus Cluster (A3526) is a cluster of hundreds of galaxies, located approximately 170 million light-years away in the Centaurus constellation. The brightest member galaxy is the elliptical galaxy NGC 4696 (~11m). The Centaurus cluster shares its supercluster, the Hydra–Centaurus Supercluster, with IC4329 Cluster and Hydra Cluster.

The cluster consists of two different sub-groups of galaxies with different velocities. Cen 30 is the main subgroup containing NGC 4696. Cen 45 which is centered on NGC 4709, is moving at 1500 km/s relative to Cen 30, and is believed to be merging with the main cluster.

<text>Stanislas Aignan Julien (13 April 179714 February 1873) was a French sinologist who served as the Chair of Chinese at the Collège de France for over 40 years and was one of the most academically respected sinologists in French scholarship.

Julien was a student of Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat, and succeeded him as the chair of Chinese at the Collège de France upon Rémusat&#x27;s death in 1832. The quantity and quality of Julien&#x27;s scholarship earned him wide renown, and caused him to become the leading European scholar of China during the 19th century. Along with Sebastien Couvreur and among 19th-century scholars of China, Julien&#x27;s academic reputation was rivaled only by the Scottish sinologist James Legge, and no sinologist equaled his academic reputation until Édouard Chavannes at the turn of the 20th century.

Notwithstanding his academic rigor and gifted intellect, Julien had a notoriously thorny personality and publicly feuded with most of his contemporaries, earning broad academic respect but equally broad personal dislike from those who knew him.

==Biography==

Born at Orléans on 13 April 1797, Julien initially struggled to obtain higher education due to his family&#x27;s relative poverty. He studied at the college in Orléans before transferring to the Collège de France, where he initially focused on Greek language and literature before branching out into Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Sanskrit. In 1821 he was appointed assistant professor of Greek. In the same year he published an edition of &quot;The Rape of Helen&quot; of Coluthus, with versions in French, Latin, English, German, Italian and Spanish. He attended the lectures of Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat on Chinese.

In late 1823 Julien met Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat, the first-ever professor of Chinese at the Collège de France, and began studying Chinese with him. In 1824, only six months after meeting Rémusat, Julien began a Latin translation of the &quot;Mencius&quot;, working from eight different Chinese editions and two Manchu editions, Julien having simultaneously begun studying Manchu. The work was published in Paris with the lengthy title &quot;Meng Tseu vel Mencium inter Sinenses philosophos, ingenio, doctrina, nominisque claritate Confucio proximum, edidit, Latina interpretatione, ad interpretationem Tartaricam utramque recensita, instruixit, et perpetuo commentario, e Sinicis deprompto, illustravit Stanislaus Julien&quot;. Julien&#x27;s attention to textual variants among different editions was remarkable for his era, and was lauded by his teacher Rémusat, whose review gave such praises as: &quot;M. Julien s&#x27;est livré à une lecture assidue du texte de &quot;Mencius;&quot; il a étudié le style de cet auteur, et s&#x27;est pénétré de tout ce que son langage offre de particulier.&quot; (&quot;Mr. Julien has delivered an assiduous reading of the text of the &quot;Mencius&quot;; he has studied the style of this author, and has penetrated all that his language particularly has to offer.&quot;)

Soon afterwards he translated the modern Greek odes of Kalvos under the title of &quot;La Lyre patriotique de la Grèce&quot;. In 1827 he was appointed sublibrarian to the Institut de France. In 1832 he succeeded Abel-Rémusat as professor of Chinese at the Collège de France. In 1833 he was elected a member of the Académie des Inscriptions.
For some years his studies had been directed towards the vernacular literature of the Chinese, bringing out translations of &quot;Hoei-lan-ki&quot; 灰闌記 (&quot;L&#x27;Histoire du cercle de craie&quot;), a drama in which occurs a scene curiously analogous to the Judgement of Solomon; and the 趙氏孤兒 &quot;Zhao shi guer&quot; [Tchao-chi kou eul], &quot;The Orphan of Zhao&quot;, or Orphan of the House Tcho.

He next turned to the Taoist writings, and translated in 1835 &quot;Le Livre des récompenses et des peines&quot; 太上感應篇 &quot;Taishang Ganying Pian&quot;. About this time the cultivation of silkworms was beginning to attract attention in France, and by order of the minister of agriculture Julien compiled, in 1837, a &quot;Résumé des principaux traits chinois sur la culture des mûriers, et l&#x27;éducation des vers-de-soie&quot; 桑蠶輯要, which was speedily translated into English, German, Italian and Russian.

He published in 1841 &quot;Discussions grammaticales sur certaines régles de position qui, en chinois, jouent le même rôle que les inflexions dans les autres langues&quot;, which he followed in 1842 by &quot;Exercices pratiques d&#x27;analyse, de syntaxe, et de lexigraphie chinoise&quot;. Meanwhile, in 1839, he had been appointed joint keeper of the Bibliothèque Royale, with the special superintendence of the Chinese books, and shortly afterwards he was made administrator of the Collège de France.

In 1842 saw the publication of his translation of the 道德經 &quot;Dao De Jing&quot;. Then he turned his attention to the Buddhist literature of China, and more especially to the travels of Buddhist pilgrims to India. In order that he might better understand the references to Indian institutions and the transcriptions in Chinese of Sanskrit words and proper names, he began the study of Sanskrit, and in 1853 brought out his &quot;Voyages du pélerin Hiouen-tsang&quot; 大唐西域記 &quot;Da Tang Xi You Ji&quot;.

In 1843, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

Julien became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1857. In 1859 he published &quot;Les Avadanas, contes et apologues indiens inconnus jusqu&#x27;à ce jour, suivis de poésies et de nouvelles chinoises&quot;. For the benefit of future students he disclosed his system of deciphering Sanskrit words occurring in Chinese books in his &quot;Méthode pour déchiffrer et transcrire les noms sanscrits qui se rencontrent dans les livres chinois&quot; (1861). The work had escaped the author&#x27;s observation that, since the translations of Sanskrit works into Chinese were undertaken in different parts of the empire, the same Sanskrit words were of necessity differently represented in Chinese characters in accordance with the dialectical variations. No hard and fast rule can therefore possibly be laid down for the decipherment of Chinese transcriptions of Sanskrit words.

Known for his impatience and bad temper, he had bitter controversies with his fellow Sinologists. His Indian studies led to a controversy with Joseph Toussaint Reinaud. Among the many subjects to which he turned his attention were the native industries of China, producing the &quot;Histoire et fabrication de la porcelaine chinoise&quot; 景德鎮陶錄 &quot;Jingdezhen Taolu&quot;. In another volume he also published an account of the &quot;Industries anciennes et modernes de l&#x27;Empire chinois&quot; (1869), translated from native authorities.

His last work of importance was &quot;Syntaxe nouvelle de la langue Chinoise fondée sur la position des mots, suivie de deux traités sur les particules et les principaux termes de grammaire, d&#x27;une table des idiotismes, de fables, de légendes et d&#x27;apologues&quot; (1869), for many years the standard grammar for the Chinese language.

In politics Julien was imperialist, and in 1863 he was made a commander of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in recognition of the services he had rendered to literature during the Second French Empire.

In 1872 the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres established the Prix Stanislas Julien, an annual prize for a sinological work which was first awarded in 1875.

<doc id="902180" wikidata="Q3279945" url="?curid=902180" title="Unicon (programming language)">
<text>Unicon is a programming language designed by American computer scientist Clint Jeffery with collaborators including Shamim Mohamed, Jafar Al Gharaibeh, Robert Parlett and others. Unicon descended from Icon and a preprocessor for Icon called IDOL. Compared with Icon, Unicon offers better access to the operating system as well as support for object-oriented programming. Unicon began life as a merger of three popular Icon extensions: an OO preprocessor named Idol, a POSIX filesystem and networking interface, and an ODBC facility. The name is shorthand for &quot;Unified Extended Dialect of Icon.&quot;

== Features ==
Compared with Icon, many of the new features of Unicon are extensions to the I/O and system interface, to complement Icon&#x27;s core control and data structures. Rather than providing lower-level APIs as-is from C, Unicon implements higher level and easier to use facilities, enabling rapid development of graphic- and network-intensive applications in addition to Icon&#x27;s core strengths in text and file processing.

== Feature list ==
* Classes and packages
*Exceptions as a contributed class library - see mailing list
* Loadable child programs
* Monitoring of child programs
* Dynamic loading of C modules (some platforms)
* Multiple inheritance, with novel semantics
* ODBC database access
* dbm files can be used as associative arrays
* Posix system interface
* 3D graphics
* True concurrency (on platforms supporting Posix threads)

When run as a graphical IDE, the Unicon program ui.exe continues to offer links to Icon help.

The official Unicon programming book in PDF format is a popular way to learn Unicon. The book includes an introduction to object-oriented development as well as UML. It includes useful chapters on topics such as the use of Unicon for CGI. Recent additions to Unicon include true concurrency.

== Unicode ==
Unicon is not yet Unicode-compliant. There are opportunities posted at a help-wanted page.

==Example code==

procedure main()
 w := open(&quot;test UNICON window&quot;, &quot;g&quot;)
 write(w, &quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
 read(w)
 close(w)
end

<text>Joseph Toussaint Reinaud (4 December 1795 – 14 May 1867) was a French orientalist.

== Life ==
Joseph Toussaint Reinaud was born at Lambesc, Bouches-du-Rhône. He came to Paris in 1815, and became a pupil of Silvestre de Sacy. In 1818-19 he was at Rome as an attaché to the French minister, during which time, he conducted investigations of manuscripts and gave special attention to Muslim coins.

In 1824 he entered the department of oriental manuscripts in the Royal Library at Paris, and in 1838, on the death of De Sacy, he succeeded to his chair in the School of Living Oriental Languages.
In 1847 he became president of the Asiatic Society, and in 1858 conservator of oriental manuscripts in the Imperial Library.

His first important work was his classic description of the collections of the Duc de Blacas (1828). To history he contributed an essay on the Arab invasions of France, Savoy, Piedmont and Switzerland (&quot;Invasions des Sarrazins en France, et de France en Savoie, en Piémont et dans la Suisse&quot;, 1836), and various collections for the period of the crusades; he edited (1840), and in part translated (1848), the geography of Abulfeda.

To him too is due a useful edition of the very curious records of early Arab intercourse with China of which Eusèbe Renaudot had given but an imperfect translation (&quot;Relation des voyages&quot;, etc., 1845), and various other essays illustrating the ancient and medieval geography of the East.
