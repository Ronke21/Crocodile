<text>Grigory Vasilyevich Romanov (; 7 February 1923 – 3 June 2008) was a Soviet politician and member of the Politburo and Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1985, he was considered Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s main rival in the succession struggle after the death of Konstantin Chernenko in March 1985, the third Soviet leader to die in just a few short years.

== Early life and career ==

Romanov was born in 1923 in Novgorod Governorate into a peasant family.

He was a soldier in the Red Army during the Great Patriotic War, Romanov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1944. Romanov graduated from the Leningrad Shipbuilding Institute in 1953, and became a designer in a shipyard. He fulfilled several important posts in the party committee of the enterprise he was working at and later in the Leningrad city and regional party committees. In September 1970 he was elected as First Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the Leningrad Region. In this position he gained a reputation of being a good organizer and well versed in economic matters, winning defense investment for Leningrad. He was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the XXIVth congress of the CPSU in 1971. He became a candidate member of the Central Committee&#x27;s Politburo in 1973 and a full member in 1976. 

In 1977 he initiated a successful vote to remove Nikolai Podgorny, the then Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, from the Politburo.

== Secretary of the Central Committee ==

In 1983, Romanov attracted the attention of the new General Secretary Yuri Andropov, who subsequently brought him to Moscow and helped promote him in June 1983 to the very prestigious and influential post of a secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU responsible for industry and the military–industrial complex. During the few remaining months of Andropov&#x27;s life Romanov was widely seen as one of Andropov&#x27;s closest collaborators and was an ardent supporter of Andropov&#x27;s comprehensive program for the reform, renewal and further development of socialism in the Soviet Union and beyond, a fact which stands in sharp contrast to the picture Gorbachev and his associates were later to paint of Romanov as a means of gaining advantage in the power struggles following Andropov&#x27;s death in February 1984.

Romanov attracted international attention on November 5, 1983, during the height of Operation Able Archer. He addressed the Kremlin Palace of Congresses in order to commemorate the October Revolution, where he remarked:

Western analysts, unaware of the Exercise that was taking place and therefore uncertain as to why Romanov would describe the situation as &quot;white hot&quot;, dismissed the remarks as Soviet propaganda.

During Konstantin Chernenko&#x27;s short time in office as General Secretary in 19841985, Romanov already occupied a position clearly inferior to Gorbachev, who had been styled Second Secretary of the Central Committee since February 1984 and acted as chairman of the Politburo, Secretariat and Central Committee in the course of Chernenko&#x27;s long periods of absence due to his illness.

== Gorbachev vs. Romanov ==
Romanov was the second youngest member of the Politburo after Gorbachev. In the months preceding the death of Konstantin Chernenko in March 1985, Romanov and Gorbachev were commonly regarded to be chief rivals in the succession struggle for the post of General Secretary. Viktor Grishin was also considered a viable candidate.

However, after Chernenko&#x27;s death, Gorbachev emerged with the strongest position to succeed Chernenko. Andrei Gromyko, one of the oldest and widely respected Politburo members, nominated Gorbachev for the position of General Secretary of CPSU, both at the 11 March meeting of Politburo and subsequently at the March 1985 Plenum (meeting) of the Central Committee of the CPSU. Neither Romanov nor Grishin mounted a formal challenge to Gorbachev&#x27;s bid, and the votes in favor of Gorbachev, both in the 11 March meeting of Politburo and at the March Plenum, were unanimous.

== End of career ==

Gorbachev quickly moved to oust Romanov following his ascent to become General Secretary. He informed Romanov that he had no future under him, and sacked him three months later. Romanov was forced to retire from the Politburo on 1 July 1985. 

Romanov subsequently lived as a pensioner in Moscow. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he joined the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and became a member of the Central Advisory Council under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. For several years, he headed the &quot;Association of Leningradians in Moscow&quot;.

He was buried at the Kuntsevo Cemetery in Moscow.

<text>Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest is a Canadian crime drama television series which originally aired on CBC Television from 1998 to 2005. While never a ratings blockbuster, the critically acclaimed show did attract a loyal following, and ultimately seven seasons of thirteen episodes each were filmed for a total of ninety-one episodes.

The show, set and filmed in Vancouver, starred Nicholas Campbell as Dominic Da Vinci, once an undercover officer for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but now a crusading coroner who seeks justice in the cases he investigates.

The cast also included Gwynyth Walsh as Da Vinci&#x27;s ex-wife and chief pathologist Patricia Da Vinci, Donnelly Rhodes as detective Leo Shannon, and Ian Tracey as detective Mick Leary.

==Production==
&quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot; was loosely based on the real life experiences of Larry Campbell, the former chief coroner of Vancouver, British Columbia, who was elected mayor of that city in 2002. The part of Da Vinci, however, was written specifically for actor Nicholas Campbell. Elements of the series storylines were also taken from sociopolitical issues faced by Vancouver itself, such as the plight of the homeless, the controversy over a designated injection site for drug users, the idea of establishing a red light district, and the disappearance of homeless women and sex workers — similar to the case of Robert Pickton. Each episode of the series cost $1 million.

===Format===
&quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot; is notable for its unconventional story formats. Unlike most crime dramas, many cases on &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot; aren&#x27;t fully explained, and some aren&#x27;t even solved; often the episodes end with the resolution implied or withheld entirely. Some of the longer arcs of the show arcs span the length of one or more seasons, but aren&#x27;t touched on at all for several episodes at a time. An exception to this is Season 7, which features at least three main plots that are addressed in every episode. Two episodes, Season 3&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Backwards Day&quot; and Season 4&#x27;s &quot;Pretend You Didn&#x27;t See Me,&quot; are notable for their extended opening takes, which follow Da Vinci as he walks around a location and speaks with multiple characters in one continuous, ten-minute shot; the former episode is also noted for playing out largely in real time.

Major story arcs include: Da Vinci&#x27;s attempts to balance his work life with his ex-wife and daughter, as well as his battles with alcoholism; Leo Shannon struggling to care for his mentally ill wife and facing pressure to retire from the force; the relocation of an old mental hospital&#x27;s cemetery and the intrigue that follows; Sunny overseeing an archaeological dig at a construction site; Angela Kosmo&#x27;s battle with a corrupt Vice cop and the teenage prostitute who tries to manipulate both of them; and Da Vinci&#x27;s quest to establish a red light district and safe injection site to protect the sex workers and drug addicts of Vancouver, which leads him to run first for police chief and then mayor. The sex trade is a recurring theme throughout the entire series, and early season premieres and finales center around high numbers of homicides where prostitutes are the victims, which often turn out to be the work of a serial killer. Relationships between characters (such as Da Vinci&#x27;s many romantic flings and that between Mick Leary and Sunny Ramen) are left in the background of or take place between episodes.

==Availability outside Canada==

===United States===
The original run of &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot; was always available in certain U.S. markets (e.g., Seattle) where the CBC could be viewed either over the air or on cable. It made its formal U.S. debut, however, the week of September 17, 2005, when it was already in syndication after the original run. The show has continued to air in syndication, along with multiple networks (including Retro TV, Cloo, WGN America, and Court TV Mystery) due to its low-cost syndication arrangement. The series is distributed in the United States by PPI Releasing, a large distributor of Canadian programming to the American market.

===Other countries===
In Australia, the series aired late Monday nights on the Nine Network, and its affiliates WIN (although on a different night) and NBN, and later on 13th Street. It has also been aired in late night slots on RTÉ One in Ireland. In Iceland, Skjár einn has aired the show in various slots, including Saturday evening.

==Home media==

===DVD===
Acorn Media UK has released the first three seasons on DVD in Region 1 (US only).

In Canada, Alliance Atlantis released the first season on DVD on 14 October 2003. Season 2 was released on 3 February 2009 by Alliance Films, more than five years after the release of the first season.

===Streaming===

As of 2017, season one has been released online for free on Canada Media Fund&#x27;s Encore+ YouTube Channel.

==Awards and nominations==
Nicholas Campbell received the Gemini Award for Best Performance in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role for his work on the series and has guest-starred in American shows such as &quot;Monk&quot;. Donnelly Rhodes also received a Gemini Award for Best Actor in 2002 and the Earle Grey Award in 2006. The series was critically acclaimed as the best television series in Canada after winning the Gemini Award for Best Dramatic Series for five of its first six seasons. In 2002, actress Keegan Connor Tracy won a Leo Award for her guest appearance in Season 4&#x27;s &quot;Pretend You Didn&#x27;t See Me&quot; and was brought back for a second appearance in 2005.

==&quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s City Hall&quot; and TV movies==
In Canada, a spin-off series, &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s City Hall&quot;, premiered on 25 October 2005.

In the U.S., &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s City Hall&quot; airs as part of the &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot; rerun package, regarded as the eighth season of the series (even using the titles from the last three seasons of &quot;Inquest&quot; instead of the titles for &quot;City Hall&quot;). &quot;City Hall&quot; debuted in the U.S. on Superstation WGN on April 27, 2007, and released into national syndication to local stations, also as part of &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot;, on November 4, 2007.

A TV movie following up on the two series, &quot;The Quality of Life&quot;, aired on CBC on 14 June 2008.

<doc id="899604" wikidata="Q715304" url="?curid=899604" title="Rail transport in Taiwan">
<text>Rail transport in Taiwan consists of (as of 2015) of railway networks. Though no longer as dominant as it once was, rail transport is an extremely important form of transportation in Taiwan due to high population density, especially along the densely populated western corridor. In 2016, over 1.09 billion passengers traveled by rail in Taiwan, averaging 2.99 million passengers per day.

The railways of Taiwan include conventional rail, rapid transit systems, and high-speed rail, as well as specialized railways for tourists and industry. Taiwan Railways Administration is an associate member and Taiwan High Speed Rail is an active member of the International Union of Railways (UIC), even though Taiwan does not have state membership.

Rail transport was introduced to Taiwan in 1891 during its late Qing era. Push car railways were brought to Taiwan during Japanese rule and were in general service from 1895 to the late 1940s.

All railway services are located in the main island of Taiwan. Outer islands including Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu Islands do not have railways.

==Intercity railways==
There are two railway systems that provide intercity transportation service in Taiwan:
The Taiwan Railways, formerly administered by the governmental agency Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA), has been operated by Taiwan Railway since 1 January 2024. TR operates both passenger service and the only freight service in the country. The main lines form a loop around the island that connects most of the country&#x27;s major cities, with small branch lines at various points to the interior. TR operates both intercity trains throughout Taiwan, and commuter services into the major cities. The Taiwan High Speed Rail is operated by a franchised private company called Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation, it contains passenger services between Nangang, Taipei and Zuoying, Kaohsiung with a route that runs through Western Taiwan.

==Urban transit==
Urban rail transit systems are managed by local governments. There are currently five operators in Taiwan&#x27;s major urban centers.

Most of the urban rail transit systems use standard gauge , except Taipei Metro Wenhu line, which uses VAL system with track gauge. The main line of Taoyuan Metro is called the Taoyuan Airport MRT, which connects Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan&#x27;s largest airport, with Taipei and Zhongli, Taoyuan. In addition to the five systems above, there were also plans to build rapid transit systems in municipalities of Tainan and Hsinchu. However, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications declined the proposals in January 2010 for budget issues and deeming it premature. Recently, most plans of new urban rail transit system plans have adopted light rail for budget efficiency.

==Industrial and tourist railways==
Industrial railways were built mainly in the Japanese era for transporting industrial raw materials and products, especially sugarcanes for sugar industry, and lumber for wood industry in Taiwan. After World War II, these industries declined significantly and these railroads were remodeled as tourist attractions in the beginning of 21st century.

The Taiwan Sugar Railways is an extensive series of narrow gauge lines mostly in central and southern Taiwan, originally built to haul sugarcane by the sugar companies in Japanese era, but also capable of providing limited passenger service. Regular passenger services discontinued in 1982. In 2003, some short-distance train services resumed. Currently there are six lines in operation.
Only Magongcuo line in Huwei Sugar Refinery is still in industrial use, the other five lines have been transformed to heritage railways.

The Forest Railways were built for logging and timber industry, now recommissioned as tourist railway services in high mountains.
The Alishan Forest Railway is currently the largest tourist railway network in Taiwan, operated by the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency. The Luodong Forest Railway and Taiping Mountain Forest Railway were interconnected to transport the harvested lumber from Taiping Mountain to Luodong, Yilan and transferred to major railway system of Taiwan. Now only a short section near Tiansongpi Station is operating. Wulai Scenic Train was originally tracks for rail push trolleys, now runs a light automotive for tourists.

==Track gauge==
The earliest railway in Taiwan was completed in 1893 under the auspices of Governor Liu Mingchuan during the Qing Era and rebuilt by the Governors-General during the Japanese Era (see Taiwan Railway#History). Since then, major railways in Taiwan have followed the gauge standard. The Taitung Line was built during the Japanese Era with gauge, but since 1982 it has been converted to , while the Alishan Forest Railway and the majority of Taiwan Sugar Railways are still railways. The Taiwan High Speed Rail and all rapid transit systems use standard gauge track.

==Cultural==
Because of Taiwan&#x27;s extensive rail network (including many now defunct industrial narrow gauge lines which provided passenger service to rural areas), railways in Taiwan often have a romantic connotation, especially amongst the older generation who remember growing up when rail travel was the primary means of transportation between cities in simpler (and less prosperous) times. Many remember leaving their hometowns to attend school in far away cities by train or leaving via train to perform their compulsory military service. This nostalgia has been capitalized upon in recent years through the introduction of various items such as “old-fashioned railway bento” (), claimed to be authentic copies of the box lunches that were once served aboard trains. The most famous version of railway bentos is the classic porkchop bento by Taiwan Railway Bento.

===Railfan culture===

Taiwan also has a rail enthusiast culture that dates back to 9 June 1988, when the National Chiao Tung University&#x27;s , the first college student club in Taiwan, was established, with its first leader being Jen Heng-yi. Jen and his fellow club members would work to publish what became the first issue of the popular long-running railfan publication Rail News in 1989. The success the club had with other local railfans was followed by the establishment of similar clubs in other Taiwanese universities such as in the National Taiwan University and Tamkang University in Taipei, as well as one at National Cheng Kung University in Tainan. The first private rail association, Railway Culture Society was subsequently established in 1995 after Jen and other founders of the Rail Institute transitioned away from student life.

Some prominent railway enthusiasts in Taiwan include assistant professor of the National Taiwan Normal University and technical assistant professor of the National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality and Tourism.

<doc id="899605" wikidata="Q5036058" url="?curid=899605" title="Robert Bourke, 1st Baron Connemara">
<text>Robert Bourke, 1st Baron Connemara, (; ; ; ; 11 June 1827 – 3 September 1902) was a British Conservative politician and colonial administrator who served as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (1874–80, 1885–86) and Governor of Madras (1886–90).

==Background and education==
Bourke was born into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family at Hayes, County Meath, Ireland, the third son of Robert Bourke, 5th Earl of Mayo (the son of Hon. Richard Burke, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore), and Anne Charlotte, daughter of The Hon. John Jocelyn. His older brother was The 6th Earl of Mayo, a Viceroy of India. He was educated at Hall Place School, Bexley, Kent, and Trinity College, Dublin, and was called to the Bar, Inner Temple, in 1852.

==Political career==
Bourke practised as a barrister for a number of years before being elected Conservative Member of Parliament for King&#x27;s Lynn in 1868. In 1874 he became Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s second administration, a post he held until 1880, when he was also sworn of the Privy Council. He held the same post from 1885 to 1886 in Lord Salisbury&#x27;s first administration.

== Governor of Madras ==

In 1886, Bourke was appointed Governor of Madras. The following year he was appointed a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire and raised to the peerage as Baron Connemara, of Connemara in the County of Galway. In 1890 he laid the foundations stone of the Connemara Public Library in Madras, which was named after him and opened six years later. The building was originally planned to house the proposed Victoria Technical Institute which was constructed in 1887, the Golden Jubilee year of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign. The third session of the Indian National Congress was held at Madras in 1887 when Lord Connemara was the governor. He hosted a garden party at Government House for the delegates. The construction of the Madras High Court was commenced in 1889.

Lord Connemara is credited with introducing a number of reforms while serving as governor. He personally supervised the famine-relief measures at Ganjam and reorganised the sanitary administration of Madras city. He also improved and extended the east coast railway line connecting Madras with Calcutta. The &quot;Madras Mail&quot;, in its 4 December 1890 issue, comments that his administration was &quot;a bright epoch in the annals of Madras&quot;. He resigned as governor on 8 November 1890 and returned to Great Britain when his wife sued him for infecting her with syphilis and his adultery with her lady&#x27;s maid. He did not defend himself and accepted the verdict and paid costs.

== Later life ==
Lord Connemara contributed occasionally in the House of Lords, mostly on matters dealing with foreign affairs, making his last speech in June 1898. He also published the work &quot;Parliamentary Precedents&quot;.

==Family==
Lord Connemara was twice married. He married firstly Lady Susan Georgiana, daughter of The 1st Marquess of Dalhousie, a former Governor-General of India, in 1863. They divorced in 1890. In 1894, he married Gertrude, former wife of Edward Coleman. Both marriages were childless. His second wife died in November 1898. Lord Connemara died in London in September 1902, aged 75, and was buried in the city&#x27;s Kensal Green Cemetery. His barony became extinct at his death.

<text>The enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP, alkaline phenyl phosphatase, also abbreviated PhoA) is a phosphatase with the physiological role of dephosphorylating compounds. The enzyme is found across a multitude of organisms, prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike, with the same general function, but in different structural forms suitable to the environment they function in. Alkaline phosphatase is found in the periplasmic space of &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria. This enzyme is heat stable and has its maximum activity at high pH. In humans, it is found in many forms depending on its origin within the body – it plays an integral role in metabolism within the liver and development within the skeleton. Due to its widespread prevalence in these areas, its concentration in the bloodstream is used by diagnosticians as a biomarker in helping determine diagnoses such as hepatitis or osteomalacia.

The level of alkaline phosphatase in the blood is checked through the ALP test, which is often part of routine blood tests. The levels of this enzyme in the blood depend on factors such as age, sex, or blood type. Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase also increase by two to four times during pregnancy. This is a result of additional alkaline phosphatase produced by the placenta and the liver. Additionally, abnormal levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood could indicate issues relating to the liver, gall bladder or bones. Kidney tumors and infections as well as malnutrition have also shown abnormal level of alkaline phosphatase in blood. Alkaline phosphatase levels in a cell can be measured through a process called the &quot;scoring method&quot;. A blood smear is usually taken and stained to categorize each leukocyte into specific leukocyte alkaline phosphatase indices. This marker is designed to distinguish leukocytes and determine different enzyme activity from each sample&#x27;s extent of staining.

==Bacterial==
In gram-negative bacteria, such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, alkaline phosphatase is located in the periplasmic space, external to the inner cell membrane and within the peptidoglycan portion of the cell wall. Since the periplasmic gap is more prone to environmental variation than the inner cell, alkaline phosphatase is suitably resistant to inactivation, denaturation, or degradation. This characteristic of the enzyme is uncommon to many other proteins.

The precise structure and function of the isozyme in &quot;E. coli&quot; is solely geared to supply a source of inorganic phosphate when the environment lacks this metabolite. The inorganic phosphates are then bound to carrier proteins which deliver the inorganic phosphates to a specific high-affinity transport system, known as the phosphate-specific transport system, which transports phosphate across the cytoplasmic membrane.

While the outer membrane of &quot;E. coli&quot; contains porins that are permeable to phosphorylated compounds, the inner membrane does not. An issue arises in how to transport such compounds across the inner membrane and into the cytosol. The strong anionic charge of phosphate groups along with the remainder of the compound make phosphorylated compounds very much immiscible in the nonpolar region of the bilayer. The solution arises in cleaving the phosphate group away from the compound via ALP. for translocation into the cytosol, The main purpose of dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase is to increase the rate of diffusion of phosphorylated molecules into the cells while inhibiting them from diffusing out.

Alkaline phosphatase is a zinc-containing dimeric enzyme with the MW: 86,000 Da, each subunit containing 429 amino acids with four cysteine residues linking the two subunits. Alkaline phosphatase contains four Zn ions and two Mg ions, with Zn occupying active sites A and B, and Mg occupying site C, so the fully active native alkaline phosphatase is referred to as (ZnAZnBMgC)2 enzyme. The mechanism of action of alkaline phosphatase involves the geometric coordination of the substrate between the Zn ions in the active sites. 

Alkaline phosphatase in &quot;E. coli&quot; is uncommonly soluble and active within elevated temperature conditions such as 80 °C. Due to the kinetic energy induced by this temperature the weak hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions of common proteins become degraded and therefore coalesce and precipitate. However, upon dimerization of alkaline phosphatase, the bonds maintaining its secondary and tertiary structures are effectively buried such that they are not affected as much at this temperature. Furthermore, even at more elevated temperatures such as 90 °C alkaline phosphatase has the unusual characteristic of reverse denaturation. Due to this, although it ultimately denatures at about 90 °C it has the added ability to accurately reform its bonds and return to its original structure and function once cooled back down.

Alkaline phosphatase in &quot;E. coli&quot; is located in the periplasmic space and can thus be released using techniques that weaken the cell wall and release the protein. Due to the location of the enzyme, and the protein layout of the enzyme, the enzyme is in solution with a smaller amount of proteins than there are in another portion of the cell.
 The proteins&#x27; heat stability can also be taken advantage of when isolating this enzyme (through heat denaturation). In addition, alkaline phosphatase can be assayed using p-nitrophenyl phosphate. A reaction where alkaline phosphatase dephosphorylates the non-specific substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate in order to produce p-nitrophenol (PNP) and inorganic phosphate. PNP&#x27;s yellow color, and its λmax at 410 allows spectrophotometry to determine enzymatic activity. Some complexities of bacterial regulation and metabolism suggest that other, more subtle, purposes for the enzyme may also play a role for the cell. In the laboratory, however, mutant &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; lacking alkaline phosphatase survive quite well, as do mutants unable to shut off alkaline phosphatase production.

The optimal pH for the activity of the &quot;E. coli&quot; enzyme is 8.0 while the bovine enzyme optimum pH is slightly higher at 8.5. Alkaline phosphatase accounts for 6% of all proteins in derepressed cells.

=== Heterodimeric alkaline phosphatase ===

When multiple copies of a polypeptide encoded by a gene form an aggregate, this protein structure is referred to as a multimer. When a multimer is formed from polypeptides produced by two different mutant alleles of a particular gene, the mixed multimer may exhibit greater functional activity than the unmixed multimers formed by each of the mutants alone. In such a case, the phenomenon is referred to as intragenic complementation. &quot;E. coli&quot; alkaline phosphatase, a dimer enzyme, exhibits intragenic complementation.

==Use in research==
By changing the amino acids of the wild-type alkaline phosphatase enzyme produced by &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, a mutant alkaline phosphatase is created which not only has a 36-fold increase in enzyme activity, but also retains thermal stability. Typical uses in the lab for alkaline phosphatases include removing phosphate monoesters to prevent self-ligation, which is undesirable during plasmid DNA cloning.

Common alkaline phosphatases used in research include:
* Shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP), from a species of Arctic shrimp (&quot;Pandalus borealis&quot;). This phosphatase is easily inactivated by spiking up the temperature, a useful feature in some applications.
* Calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) typically useful in molecular cloning, where DNA undergoes recombination and no new DNA is made. In addition, it is useful in detoxifying mediated lipopolysaccharide inflammatory responses thus a drug for lipopolysaccharide mediated disease.
* Placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and its C terminally truncated version that lacks the last 24 amino acids (constituting the domain that targets for GPI membrane anchoring) – the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). It presents certain characteristics like heat stability, substrate specificity, and resistance to chemical inactivation.
* Human-intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The human body has multiple types of alkaline phosphatase present, which are determined by a minimum of three gene loci. Each one of these three loci controls a different kind of alkaline phosphatase isozyme. However, the development of this enzyme can be strictly regulated by other factors such as thermostability, electrophoresis, inhibition, or immunology.

Human-intestinal alkaline phosphatase shows around 80% homology with the bovine intestinal enzyme which holds true their shared evolutionary origins. That same bovine enzyme has more than 70% homology with human placental enzyme. However, the human liver enzyme and the placental enzyme only share 20% homology despite their structural similarities.

Alkaline phosphatase has become a useful tool in molecular biology laboratories, since DNA normally possesses phosphate groups on the 5&#x27; end. Removing these phosphates prevents the DNA from ligating (the 5&#x27; end attaching to the 3&#x27; end), thereby keeping DNA molecules linear until the next step of the process for which they are being prepared; also, removal of the phosphate groups allows radiolabeling (replacement by radioactive phosphate groups) in order to measure the presence of the labeled DNA through further steps in the process or experiment. For these purposes, the alkaline phosphatase from shrimp is the most useful, as it is the easiest to inactivate once it has done its job.

Another important use of alkaline phosphatase is as a label for enzyme immunoassays due to the elevated catalytic activity of ALP enzyme.

Undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells have elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase on their cell membrane, therefore alkaline phosphatase staining is used to detect these cells and to test pluripotency (i.e., embryonic stem cells or embryonal carcinoma cells).

There is a positive correlation between serum bone alkaline phosphatase levels (= BAP) and bone formation in humans, although its use as a biomarker in clinical practice is not recommended.

===Dairy industry===
Alkaline phosphatase is commonly used in the dairy industry as an indicator of successful pasteurization. This is because the most heat stable bacterium found in milk, &quot;Mycobacterium paratuberculosis&quot;, is destroyed by temperatures lower than those required to denature the enzyme. Therefore, its presence is ideal for indicating failed pasteurization.

Pasteurization verification is typically performed by measuring the fluorescence of a solution which becomes fluorescent when exposed to active alkaline phosphatase. Fluorimetry assays are required by milk producers in the UK to prove alkaline phosphatase has been denatured, as p-Nitrophenylphosphate tests are not considered accurate enough to meet health standards.

Alternatively the color change of &quot;p&quot;-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate in a buffered solution (Aschaffenburg Mullen Test) can be used. Raw milk would typically produce a yellow coloration within a couple of minutes, whereas properly pasteurised milk should show no change. There are exceptions to this, as in the case of heat-stable alkaline phosphatases produced by some bacteria, but these bacteria should not be present in milk.

In addition, the Scharer Rapid Phosphatase test investigates the presence and the absence of ALP enzymes in raw milk. This test is advantageous since a full and complete pasteurization inactivates the ALP enzymes, resulting in no color change. However, positive test results in changing the raw milk color into blue, thus indicating the presence of ALP enzymes. The test works by cleaving off a phosphate group from the substrate disodium phenyl phosphate, causing a release of phenol group and indicating positive test results observed visually and by spectrophotometer. 

===Inhibitors===
All mammalian alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes except placental (PALP and SEAP) are inhibited by homoarginine, and, in similar manner, all except the intestinal and placental ones are blocked by levamisole. Phosphate is another inhibitor which competitively inhibits alkaline phosphatase.

Another known example of an alkaline phosphatase inhibitor is [(4-Nitrophenyl)methyl]phosphonic acid.

In metal contaminated soil, alkaline phosphatase are inhibited by Cd (Cadmium). In addition, temperature enhances the inhibition of Cd on the enzyme activity, which is shown in the increasing values of &quot;K&quot;m.

==Human==

===Physiology===
In humans, alkaline phosphatase is present in all tissues throughout the body, but is particularly concentrated in the liver, bile duct, kidney, bone, intestinal mucosa and placenta. In the serum, two types of alkaline phosphatase isozymes predominate: skeletal and liver. During childhood the majority of alkaline phosphatase are of skeletal origin. Humans and most other mammals contain the following alkaline phosphatase isozymes:
* ALPI – intestinal (molecular mass of 150 kDa) 
* ALPL – tissue-nonspecific (expressed mainly in liver, bone, and kidney)
* ALPP – placental (Regan isozyme)
* ALPG – germinal tissues
Four genes encode the four isozymes. The gene for tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase is located on chromosome 1, and the genes for the other three isoforms are located on chromosome 2.

==== Intestinal alkaline phosphatase ====
Intestinal alkaline phosphatase is secreted by enterocytes, and seems to play a pivotal role in intestinal homeostasis and protection as well as in suppressing inflammation via repression of the downstream Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4-dependent and MyD88-dependent inflammatory cascade. It dephosphorylates toxic/inflammatory microbial ligands like lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), unmethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotides, flagellin, and extracellular nucleotides such as uridine diphosphate or ATP. Dephosphorylation of LPS by IAP can reduce the severity of &quot;Salmonella tryphimurium&quot; and &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection restoring normal gut microbiota. Thus, altered IAP expression has been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It also seems to regulate lipid absorption and bicarbonate secretion in the duodenal mucosa, which regulates the surface pH. Since the 1960s intestinal alkaline phosphatase has been utilized in drug delivery. As it cleaves phosphate substructures from drugs, auxiliary agents, and even from the surface of nanocarriers, this enzyme enables the design of drug delivery systems that can alter their properties in the body on demand. The solubility of many drugs can be substantially improved by the design of phosphate prodrugs. On the intestinal mucosa the phosphate substructures are cleaved off by alkaline phosphatase and the drug is absorbed. Furthermore, anionic nanocarriers exhibiting bioinert properties can alter their surface to interactive once having reached the intestinal epithelium as due to an alkaline phosphatase triggered cleavage of anionic phosphate groups from their surface charge converts to cationic improving for instance cellular uptake.

===In cancer cells===

Studies show that the alkaline phosphatase protein found in cancer cells is similar to that found in nonmalignant body tissues and that the protein originates from the same gene in both. One study compared the enzymes of liver metastases of giant-cell lung carcinoma and nonmalignant placental cells. The two were similar in NH2-terminal sequence, peptide map, subunit molecular weight, and isoelectronic point.

In a different study in which scientists examined alkaline phosphatase protein presence in a human colon cancer cell line, also known as HT-29, results showed that the enzyme activity was similar to that of the non-malignant intestinal type. However, this study revealed that without the influence of sodium butyrate, alkaline phosphatase activity is fairly low in cancer cells. A study based on sodium butyrate effects on cancer cells conveys that it has an effect on androgen receptor co-regulator expression, transcription activity, and also on histone acetylation in cancer cells. This explains why the addition of sodium butyrate show increased activity of alkaline phosphatase in the cancer cells of the human colon. In addition, this further supports the theory that alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity is actually present in cancer cells.

In another study, choriocarcinoma cells were grown in the presence of 5-bromo-2&#x27;-deoxyuridine and results conveyed a 30- to 40-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity. This procedure of enhancing the activity of the enzyme is known as enzyme induction. The evidence shows that there is in fact activity of alkaline phosphatase in tumor cells, but it is minimal and needs to be enhanced. Results from this study further indicate that activities of this enzyme vary among the different choriocarcinoma cell lines and that the activity of the alkaline phosphatase protein in these cells is lower than in the non-malignant placenta cells. but levels are significantly higher in children and pregnant women. Blood tests should always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that performed the test. High alkaline phosphatase levels can occur if the bile ducts are obstructed.

Also, the level of alkaline phosphatase increases if there is active bone formation occurring, as the enzyme is a byproduct of osteoblast activity (such as the case in Paget&#x27;s disease of bone).

The level of alkaline phosphatase is much more elevated in metastatic prostate cancer cells than non-metastatic prostate cancer cells. High levels of ALP in prostate cancer patients is associated with a significant decrease in survival.

Levels are also elevated in people with untreated coeliac disease. Lowered levels of the level of alkaline phosphatase are less common than elevated levels. The source of elevated levels can be deduced by obtaining serum levels of γ-glutamyltransferase. Concomitant increases of alkaline phosphatase with γ-glutamyltransferase should raise the suspicion of hepatobiliary disease.

Some diseases do not affect the levels of alkaline phosphatase, for example, hepatitis C. A high level of this enzyme does not reflect any damage in the liver, even though high alkaline phosphatase levels may result from a blockage of flow in the biliary tract or an increase in the pressure of the liver.

=== Elevated levels ===

As of 2020, normal ALP levels were &quot;not well defined&quot;, and there tend to be variations by sex and racial background, and by age, with children and adolescents having markedly higher levels. 

There are many possible explanations for elevated ALP. When the cause is unclear, isoenzyme studies using electrophoresis can confirm the source of the increase. Skelphosphatase (which is localized in osteoblasts and extracellular layers of newly synthesized matrix) is released into circulation by a yet unclear mechanism. Placental alkaline phosphatase is elevated in seminomas and active forms of rickets, as well as in the following diseases and conditions:
* Biliary obstruction
* Bone conditions
* Osteoblastic bone tumors
* Osteomalacia
* Osteoporosis
* Hepatitis
* Mononucleosis
* Cirrhosis
* Acute cholecystitis
* Myelofibrosis
* Leukemoid reaction
* Congestive heart failure
* Lymphoma
* Paget&#x27;s disease
* Sarcoidosis
* Hyperthyroidism
* Hyperparathyroidism
* Myocardial infarction
* Cholangitis
* Ischemic cholangiopathy
* Pregnancy
* High doses of estrogens

=== Lowered levels ===

The following conditions or diseases may lead to reduced levels of alkaline phosphatase:
* Hypophosphatasia, a genetic disorder
* Women receiving estrogen therapy for menopausal symptoms
* Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives
* Men with recent heart surgery, malnutrition, magnesium deficiency, or severe anemia
* Children with achondroplasia and congenital iodine deficiency
* Children after a severe episode of enteritis
* Pernicious anemia
* Aplastic anemia
* Wilson&#x27;s disease
* Hypothyroidism
* Zinc deficiency
* Malnutrition
* Steroid treatment
* Colitis
* Thyroid disease

=== Prognostic uses ===
Measuring alkaline phosphatase (along with prostate specific antigen) during, and after six months of hormone treated metastatic prostate cancer was shown to predict the survival of patients.

==== Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase ====
Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is found within mature white blood cells. White blood cell levels of LAP can help in the diagnosis of certain conditions.
* Higher than typical levels are seen in the physiological response, the leukemoid reaction, and in pathologies that include mature white blood cells, such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, and in primary myelofibrosis.
* Lower than typical levels are found in pathologies that involve undeveloped leukocytes, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and acute myelogenous leukaemia.

=== Structure and properties ===
Alkaline phosphatase is homodimeric enzyme, meaning it is formed with two molecules. Three metal ions, two Zn and one Mg, are contained in the catalytic sites, and both types are crucial for enzymatic activity to occur. The enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of monoesters in phosphoric acid which can additionally catalyze a transphosphorylation reaction with large concentrations of phosphate acceptors. While the main features of the catalytic mechanism and activity are conserved between mammalian and bacterial alkaline phosphate, mammalian alkaline phosphatase has a higher specific activity and &quot;K&quot;m values thus a lower affinity, more alkaline pH optimum, lower heat stability, and are typically membrane bound and are inhibited by l-amino acids and peptides via a means of uncompetitive mechanism. These properties noticeably differ between different mammalian alkaline phosphatase isozymes and therefore showcase a difference in &quot;in vivo&quot; functions.

Alkaline phosphatase has homology in a large number of other enzymes and composes part of a superfamily of enzymes with several overlapping catalytic aspects and substrate traits. This explains why most salient structural features of mammalian alkaline are the way they are and reference their substrate specificity and homology to other members of the nucleoside pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family of isozyme. Research has shown a relationship between members of the alkaline phosphatase family with aryl sulfatases. The similarities in structure indicate that these two enzyme families came from a common ancestor. Further analysis has linked alkaline phosphates and aryl sulfatases to a larger superfamily. Some of the common genes found in this superfamily, are ones that encode phosphodiesterases as well as autotoxin.

<doc id="899617" wikidata="Q717564" url="?curid=899617" title="Henri-Joseph Paixhans">
<text>Henri-Joseph Paixhans (; January 22, 1783, Metz – August 22, 1854, Jouy-aux-Arches) was a French artillery officer of the beginning of the 19th century.

Henri-Joseph Paixhans graduated from the École Polytechnique. He fought in the Napoleonic Wars, was the representative (Député) for the Moselle department between 1830 and 1848, and became &quot;General de Division&quot; in 1848.

In 1823, he invented the first shell guns, which came to be called Paixhans guns (or &quot;canon-obusiers&quot; in the French Navy). Paixhans guns became the first naval guns to combine explosive shells and a flat trajectory, thereby triggering the demise of wooden ships, and the iron hull revolution in shipbuilding. Paixhans also invented a &quot;Mortier monstre&quot; (&quot;Monster Mortar&quot;), using 500 kg bombs, which was used to terrible effect in the Siege of Antwerp in 1832. He was also a naval theorist claiming that a few aggressively armed small units could destroy the largest naval units of the time, making him a precursor of the French &quot;Jeune École&quot; school of thought.

The poet Victor Hugo wrote:
:&quot;Terre! l&#x27;obus est Dieu, Paixhans est son prophète.&quot;
: (&quot;Earth! the shell is God, Paixhans is his Prophet.&quot;)

== Paixhans naval guns ==
Paixhans developed a delaying mechanism which, for the first time, allowed shells to be fired safely in high-powered flat-trajectory guns. The effect of explosive shells hitting wooden hulls and setting them aflame was devastating, and was demonstrated in trials against the two-decker &quot;Pacificateur&quot; in 1824.

The first Paixhans guns were founded in 1841. The barrel of the guns weighed about 10,000 pounds, and proved accurate to about two miles. In the 1840s, France, England, Russia and the United States had adopted the new naval guns.

The effect of the guns in an operational context was first demonstrated during the actions at Eckernförde in 1849 during the First Schleswig war, and especially at the Battle of Sinop in 1853 during the Crimean War.

== Legacy ==

=== Ironclad warships ===
Wooden boats became so vulnerable that the only possible response could come with the introduction of the iron-hulled warship. The first of them was the French &quot;La Gloire&quot;, which was a wooden ship with iron sheathing. She was soon followed by HMS &quot;Warrior&quot;, which was iron-hulled with wooden backing.

=== Further developments ===

Paixhans&#x27;s design was later improved by the American John A. Dahlgren, who wrote:

=== Floating batteries ===

A class of floating batteries named after Paixhans was developed by Henri Dupuy de Lôme. Four of these ships were launched between 1861 and 1862. Originally designed for use in Cochinchina, they were built in wood and equipped with 4 ft batteries.

== Writings ==
Paixhans wrote, among others:
*&quot;Considérations sur l&#x27;état actuel de l&#x27;artillerie des places&quot; (1815)
*&quot;Nouvelle force maritime&quot; (Paris 1822), in which he envisioned a fleet protected by armour and equipped with explosive shells.
*&quot;Force et faiblesse militaires de la France&quot; (1830)
*&quot;Constitution militaire de la France&quot; (Paris 1849) 
*&quot;Retraite de Moscou&quot; (Metz 1868)

<text>Odetta Holmes (December 31, 1930 – December 2, 2008), known as Odetta, was an American singer, often referred to as &quot;The Voice of the Civil Rights Movement&quot;. Her musical repertoire consisted largely of American folk music, blues, jazz, and spirituals. An important figure in the American folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s, she influenced many of the key figures of the folk-revival of that time, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Mavis Staples, and Janis Joplin. In 2011 &quot;Time&quot; magazine included her recording of &quot;Take This Hammer&quot; on its list of the 100 Greatest Popular Songs, stating that &quot;Rosa Parks was her No. 1 fan, and Martin Luther King Jr. called her the queen of American folk music.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Odetta was born Odetta Holmes in Birmingham, Alabama. Her father, Reuben Holmes, had died when she was young, and in 1937 she and her mother, Flora Sanders, moved to Los Angeles. When Flora remarried a man called Zadock Felious, Odetta took her stepfather&#x27;s last name. In 1940 Odetta&#x27;s teacher noticed her vocal talents, &quot;A teacher told my mother that I had a voice, that maybe I should study,&quot; she recalled. &quot;But I myself didn&#x27;t have anything to measure it by.&quot; She began operatic training at the age of thirteen. After attending Belmont High School, she studied music at Los Angeles City College supporting herself as a domestic worker. Flora had hoped to see her daughter follow in the footsteps of Marian Anderson, but Odetta doubted a large black girl like herself would ever perform at the Metropolitan Opera. In 1944 she made her professional debut in musical theater as an ensemble member for four years with the Hollywood Turnabout Puppet Theatre, working alongside Elsa Lanchester. In 1949, she joined the national touring company of the musical &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;.

While on tour with &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, Odetta &quot;fell in with an enthusiastic group of young balladeers in San Francisco&quot;, and after 1950 she concentrated on folk singing.

She made her name playing at the Blue Angel nightclub in New York City, and the hungry i in San Francisco. At Tin Angel also in San Francisco in 1953 and 1954, Odetta recorded the album &quot;Odetta and Larry&quot; with Larry Mohr for Fantasy Records.

A solo career followed, with &quot;Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues&quot; (1956) and &quot;At the Gate of Horn&quot; (1957). &quot;Odetta Sings Folk Songs&quot; was one of the best-selling folk albums of 1963.

In 1959 she appeared on &quot;Tonight with Belafonte&quot;, a nationally televised special. She sang &quot;Water Boy&quot; and a duet with Belafonte, &quot;There&#x27;s a Hole in My Bucket&quot;.

In 1961, Martin Luther King Jr. called her &quot;The Queen of American Folk Music&quot;. Also in 1961, the duo Harry Belafonte and Odetta made number 32 in the UK Singles Chart with the song &quot;There&#x27;s a Hole in the Bucket&quot;. She is remembered for her performance at March on Washington, the 1963 civil rights demonstration, at which she sang &quot;O Freedom&quot;. She described her role in the civil rights movement as &quot;one of the privates in a very big army&quot;.
Broadening her musical scope, Odetta used band arrangements on several albums rather than playing alone. She released music of a more &quot;jazz&quot; style on albums like &quot;Odetta and the Blues&quot; (1962) and &quot;Odetta&quot; (1967). She gave a remarkable performance in 1968 at the Woody Guthrie memorial concert.

Odetta acted in several films during this period, including &quot;Cinerama Holiday&quot; (1955); a cinematic production of William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (1961); and &quot;The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman&quot; (1974). In 1961 she appeared in an episode of the TV series &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot;, playing the wife of a man sentenced to hang (&quot;The Hanging of Aaron Gibbs&quot;).

She was married twice, first to Dan Gordon and then, after their divorce, to blues singer-guitarist Iverson Minter, known as Louisiana Red. Her second marriage also ended in divorce. She was also engaged (but not married) to Garry Shead.

===Later career===
In May 1975 she appeared on public television&#x27;s &quot;Say Brother&quot; program, performing &quot;Give Me Your Hand&quot; in the studio. She spoke about her spirituality, the music tradition from which she drew, and her involvement in civil rights struggles.

In 1976, Odetta performed in the U.S. Bicentennial opera &quot;Be Glad Then, America&quot; by John La Montaine, as the Muse for America; with Donald Gramm, Richard Lewis and the Penn State University Choir and the Pittsburgh Symphony. The production was directed by Sarah Caldwell who was the director of the Opera Company of Boston at the time.

In 1982, Odetta was an artist-in-residence at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.
Odetta released two albums in the 20-year period from 1977 to 1997: &quot;Movin&#x27; It On&quot;, in 1987 and a new version of &quot;Christmas Spirituals&quot;, produced by Rachel Faro, in 1988.

Beginning in 1998, she returned to recording and touring. The new CD &quot;To Ella&quot; (recorded live and dedicated to her friend Ella Fitzgerald upon hearing of her death before walking on stage), was released in 1998 on Silverwolf Records, followed by three releases on M.C. Records in partnership with pianist/arranger/producer Seth Farber and record producer Mark Carpentieri. These included &quot;Blues Everywhere I Go&quot;, a 2000 Grammy-nominated blues/jazz band tribute album to the great lady blues singers of the 1920s and 1930s; &quot;Looking for a Home&quot;, a 2002 W.C. Handy Award-nominated band tribute to Lead Belly; and the 2007 Grammy-nominated &quot;Gonna Let It Shine&quot;, a live album of gospel and spiritual songs supported by Seth Farber and The Holmes Brothers. These recordings and active touring led to guest appearance on fourteen new albums by other artists between 1999 and 2006 and the re-release of 45 old Odetta albums and compilation appearances.

On September 29, 1999, President Bill Clinton presented Odetta with the National Endowment for the Arts&#x27; National Medal of Arts. In 2004, Odetta was honored at the Kennedy Center with the &quot;Visionary Award&quot; along with a tribute performance by Tracy Chapman. In 2005, the Library of Congress honored her with its &quot;Living Legend Award&quot;.

In mid-September 2001, Odetta performed with the Boys&#x27; Choir of Harlem on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman,&quot; appearing on the first show after Letterman resumed broadcasting, having been off the air for several nights following the events of September 11; they performed &quot;This Little Light of Mine&quot;.

The 2005 documentary film &quot;No Direction Home&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese, highlights her musical influence on Bob Dylan, the subject of the documentary. The film contains an archive clip of Odetta performing &quot;Waterboy&quot; on TV in 1959, as well as her &quot;Mule Skinner Blues&quot; and &quot;No More Auction Block for Me&quot;.

In 2006, Odetta opened shows for jazz vocalist Madeleine Peyroux, and in 2006 she toured the U.S., Canada, and Europe accompanied by her pianist, which included being presented by the U.S. Embassy in Latvia as the keynote speaker at a human rights conference, and also in a concert in Riga&#x27;s historic 1,000-year-old Maza Guild Hall. In December 2006, the Winnipeg Folk Festival honored Odetta with their &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot;. In February 2007, the International Folk Alliance awarded Odetta as &quot;Traditional Folk Artist of the Year&quot;.

On March 24, 2007, a tribute concert to Odetta was presented at the Rachel Schlesinger Theatre by the World Folk Music Association with live performance and video tributes by Pete Seeger, Madeleine Peyroux, Harry Belafonte, Janis Ian, Sweet Honey in the Rock, Josh White Jr., Peter, Paul and Mary, Oscar Brand, Tom Rush, Jesse Winchester, Eric Andersen, Wavy Gravy, David Amram, Roger McGuinn, Robert Sims, Carolyn Hester, Donal Leace, Marie Knight, Side by Side, and Laura McGhee.

In 2007, Odetta&#x27;s album &quot;Gonna Let It Shine&quot; was nominated for a Grammy, and she completed a major Fall Concert Tour in the &quot;Songs of Spirit&quot; show, which included artists from all over the world. She toured around North America in late 2006 and early 2007 to support this CD.

===Final tour===

On January 21, 2008, Odetta was the keynote speaker at San Diego&#x27;s Martin Luther King Jr. commemoration, followed by concert performances in San Diego, Santa Barbara, Santa Monica, and Mill Valley, in addition to being the sole guest for the evening on PBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;The Tavis Smiley Show&quot;.

Odetta was honored on May 8, 2008, at a historic tribute night, hosted by Wavy Gravy, held at Banjo Jim&#x27;s in the East Village. Included in the billing that night were David Amram, Vincent Cross, Guy Davis, Timothy Hill, Jack Landron, Christine Lavin, Madeleine Peyroux and Chaney Sims.

In summer 2008, at the age of 77, she launched a North American tour, where she sang from a wheelchair. Her set in later years included &quot;This Little Light of Mine (I&#x27;m Gonna Let It Shine)&quot;, Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;The Bourgeois Blues&quot;, &quot;(Something Inside) So Strong&quot;, &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child&quot; and &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot;.

She made an appearance on June 30, 2008, at The Bitter End on Bleecker Street, in New York City for a concert in tribute to Liam Clancy. Her last big concert, before thousands of people, was in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park on October 4, 2008, for the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival. Her last performance was at Hugh&#x27;s Room in Toronto on October 25.

===Death===
In November 2008, Odetta&#x27;s health began to decline and she began receiving treatment at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. She had hoped to perform at Barack Obama&#x27;s inauguration on January 20, 2009, but she died of heart disease in New York City on December 2, 2008, at the age of 77.

At a memorial service for her in February 2009 at Riverside Church in New York City, participants included Maya Angelou, Pete Seeger, Harry Belafonte, Geoffrey Holder, Steve Earle, Sweet Honey in the Rock, Peter Yarrow, Maria Muldaur, Tom Chapin, Josh White Jr. (son of Josh White), Emory Joseph, Rattlesnake Annie, the Brooklyn Technical High School Chamber Chorus, and videotaped tributes from Tavis Smiley and Joan Baez.

==Legacy==
Odetta influenced Harry Belafonte, who &quot;cited her as a key influence&quot; on his musical career; Bob Dylan, who said, &quot;The first thing that turned me on to folk singing was Odetta. I heard a record of hers &quot;Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues&quot; in a record store, back when you could listen to records right there in the store. Right then and there, I went out and traded my electric guitar and amplifier for an acoustical guitar, a flat-top Gibson... [That album was] just something vital and personal. I learned all the songs on that record&quot;; Joan Baez, who said, &quot;Odetta was a goddess. Her passion moved me. I learned everything she sang&quot;; Janis Joplin, who &quot;spent much of her adolescence listening to Odetta, who was also the first person Janis imitated when she started singing&quot;; the poet Maya Angelou, who once said, &quot;If only one could be sure that every 50 years a voice and a soul like Odetta&#x27;s would come along, the centuries would pass so quickly and painlessly we would hardly recognize time&quot;; John Waters, whose original screenplay for &quot;Hairspray&quot; mentions her as an influence on beatniks; and Carly Simon, who cited Odetta as a major influence and told of &quot;going weak in the knees&quot; when she had the opportunity to meet her in Greenwich Village. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Odetta at number 171 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

She became a 2024 inductee to the Blues Hall of Fame.

<doc id="899624" wikidata="Q2610891" url="?curid=899624" title="Vers la flamme">
<text>Vers la flamme (&quot;Toward the flame&quot;), Op. 72, is one of Alexander Scriabin&#x27;s last pieces for piano, written in 1914.

The main motif of the piece consists of descending half steps or whole steps interspersed with impressionistic representations of fire. The piece was originally intended to be Scriabin&#x27;s eleventh sonata; however, he had to publish it early because of financial concerns, and hence he labelled it a poem rather than a sonata. Like many of Scriabin&#x27;s late works, the piece does not conform to classical harmony and is instead built on the mystic chord and modal transpositions of its tone center. A typical performance last 5 to 6 minutes. The piece is notorious for its difficulty, in particular the enormous leaps and long, unusual double-note trills in the final pages.

According to pianist Vladimir Horowitz, the piece was inspired by Scriabin&#x27;s eccentric conviction that a constant accumulation of heat would ultimately cause the destruction of the world. The piece&#x27;s title reflects the earth&#x27;s fiery destruction, and the constant emotional buildup and crescendo throughout the piece lead, ultimately, &quot;toward the flame&quot;. The piece has also been compared to Louis Brassin&#x27;s piano transcription of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Magic Fire Music&quot; from &quot;Die Walkure&quot;.

The piece was premiered on 14 March 1915 in Kharkiv, with Scriabin himself at the piano. Notable pianists who have performed the work include Horowitz, Sviatoslav Richter, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Arcadi Volodos and Grigory Sokolov. However, many of the most celebrated recordings are by specialists of Scriabin, such as Vladimir Sofronitsky, Ruth Laredo, Heinrich Neuhaus, Stanislav Neuhaus and Igor Zhukov.

The piece has been orchestrated by composer-conductor Arkady Leytush. In 2018 Andrey Kasparov produced a treatment for piano duo.

<text>Allan Fotheringham (August 31, 1932August 19, 2020) was a Canadian newspaper and magazine journalist. He styled himself Dr. Foth and &quot;the Great Gatheringfroth&quot;. He was described as &quot;never at a loss for words&quot;.

==Early life==
Fotheringham was born in Hearne, Saskatchewan on August 31, 1932. His father died from an appendectomy gone wrong when Fotheringham was two, and his mother remarried, with Allan taking his stepfather&#x27;s surname. He attended Chilliwack Secondary School, where he was active in student leadership and wrote for the school&#x27;s paper, as well as the &quot;Chilliwack Progress&quot;. Upon graduation he studied English and political science at the University of British Columbia and worked at a variety of media outlets during his career. He was best known as a columnist, originally at the &quot;Ubyssey&quot;, a student newspaper. He was hired straight out of university by the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; during the heady times of the late 1960s, the final days of the old Bennett Socreds provincially and the advent of Pierre Trudeau federally. Fotheringham&#x27;s columns and commentaries brought him national attention as well as wider syndication and a broader subject base. He was one of the leading specialists in explaining the world of British Columbia politics during his time at the &quot;Sun&quot;.

==Career==
Fotheringham wrote for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; starting in October 1975. His column appeared on the back page of the magazine for 27 years, and was so widely read and so influential that he is said to have made &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; the magazine people read &quot;from back to front&quot;. Consequently, he dubbed a collection of them as &quot;Last Page First&quot;. Some of his more memorable political nicknames include &quot;the brogue that walks and talks like a man&quot; (for Jack Webster) and its offspring, &quot;the jaw that walks and talks like a man&quot; (for Brian Mulroney). He is credited with coining the terms &quot;Natural Governing Party&quot; for the federal Liberals, and the &quot;Holy Mother Corporation&quot; for the CBC in the course of writing his column. His columns occasionally opened with the exclamation &quot;Zowie, Dr. Foth!&quot;

Fotheringham was a regular panelist for a decade in the latter years of the CBC Television program &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot;, having replaced the deceased Gordon Sinclair in 1984. He also wrote columns for the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; for fourteen years until 2000. In 2001, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; underwent an editorial revamp, and Fotheringham&#x27;s column was moved to an inside page to make room for a guest column. Soon afterward, Fotheringham left &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, and became a columnist for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. He had a national syndicated column that was in 20 newspapers, but he retired from regular contributions in 2007, after life-threatening complications from a colonoscopy led to his hospitalization for five months. Fotheringham continued to write occasionally for the &quot;Globe&quot; and for the &quot;National Post&quot;, as well as a Calgary magazine called &quot;The Roughneck&quot;.

==Later years==
Fotheringham had honorary degrees from the University of New Brunswick (2003) and the University of Saskatchewan (2005). He died on August 19, 2020, at his home in Toronto. He was 12 days short of his 88th birthday. Although the cause of death had not yet been determined, his wife noted that he was in &quot;generally poor health&quot; in the time leading up to his death. He was buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.

==Controversies==
In a 1984 column, he wrote that two Vancouver lawyers were &quot;cementing their connections through the tennis club circuits and the wife-swapping brigades&quot;. A judge awarded the lawyers $10,000 each in damages for libel.

In a 1988 article about the British explorer Ranulph Fiennes, he wrote that &quot;Prince Charles always supports him, claiming great results for British exports, but no one has ever been able to demonstrate that any scientific or historical benefits have resulted.&quot; A London jury awarded £75,000 in damages against Fotheringham and his publishers.

In 1987, Fotheringham quipped that the United States were not serious about free trade negotiations with Canada because its chief negotiator Peter Murphy had an inoperable brain tumor, which is alleged to have led to his dismissal from his Washington post with Southam News.

Fotheringham was repeatedly accused of plagiarism throughout his career. He told an interviewer that &quot;I don’t think it’s all that serious&quot; since &quot;all journalism is based on basically what someone else has written or reported.&quot;

==Invented terms==

Affectionately known as &quot;Foth&quot; as well as &quot;Dr. Foth&quot;, he dubbed himself &quot;the Great Gatheringfroth&quot;, and coined some well-known terms in British Columbian political history:
* Lotusland – British Columbia, particularly Victoria
* the Granite Curtain – the Rocky Mountains
* the Tweed Curtain – the Oak Bay, British Columbia–Victoria border, referring to the former&#x27;s conservative British character
* &quot;the Brogue that walks and talks like a man&quot; – journalist and broadcaster Jack Webster (who had many nicknames, not all of them Foth&#x27;s). Foth later adapted this phrase to &quot;the Jaw that walks and talks like a man&quot; for Brian Mulroney.
* the Natural Governing Party – the federal Liberals
* the Holy Mother Corporation – the CBC
* Jurassic Clark – Joe Clark
* &quot;The only man in Canada who can&#x27;t speak either of the two official languages&quot; – Jean Chrétien
* Coma City – Ottawa
* Vancouver, the Narcissus of the West Coast

==Quotes==

* &quot;In the Maritimes, politics is a disease; in Quebec a religion; in Ontario a business; on the Prairies a protest; and in British Columbia an entertainment.&quot; &quot;Malice in Blunderland&quot; (1982)
* &quot;The Tories are like cream: rich, thick and full of clots.&quot; Fotheringham quoting a Liberal Convention Delegate in &quot;LOOK MA...NO HANDS&quot; (1983)

==Awards==

* Southam Fellowship in Journalism, 1964
* National Magazine Award for Humor, 1980
* National Newspaper Award for Column Writing, 1980 (first recipient)
* Inducted into the Canadian News Hall of Fame, 1999
* Bruce Hutchinson Lifetime Achievement Award, 2002

<text>Thermal infrared spectroscopy (TIR spectroscopy) is the subset of infrared spectroscopy that deals with radiation emitted in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The emitted infrared radiation, though similar to blackbody radiation, is different in that the radiation is banded at characteristic vibrations in the material. The method measures the thermal infrared radiation emitted (as opposed to being transmitted or reflected) from a volume or surface. This method is commonly used to identify the composition of surface by analyzing its spectrum and comparing it to previously measured materials. It is particularly suited to airborne and spaceborne applications.

==Thermal infrared spectrometers==

===Airborne===
*HyTES: the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer operated by JPL and flown on a Twin Otter or ER2 aircraft
*TIMS: the Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner, a multispectral radiometer flown on C-130, ER-2, and the Stennis Learjet aircraft.
*SEBASS: a hyperspectral sensor developed and operated by The Aerospace Corporation.
*Hyper-Cam: a hyperspectral thermal infrared camera developed by Telops.
*OWL: a hyperspectral thermal infrared camera developed by Specim.

===Spaceborne===
*ISM: An imaging spectrometer on board the Soviet Phobos 2 spacecraft.
*ASTER: a multispectral radiometer on board the Earth-observing Terra satellite.
*TIS: A spectrometer is on board the Mangalyan spacecraft.

<text>Kings Quest is a comic book limited series written by Ben Acker and Heath Corson and drawn by Dan McDaid. It is the sequel of the comic book series &quot;Kings Watch&quot; which featured a superhero team composed of characters from King Features Syndicate. Like its predecessor, the series was published by Dynamite Entertainment and its trade paperback collection released on January 10, 2017.

== Premise ==
Mandrake the Magician, Flash Gordon, and The Phantom once again teams up on a mission after the events of the first comic. This time, they are accompanied by new members Prince Valiant and Jungle Jim. The story begins during the aftermath of Ming the Merciless&#x27;s invasion of Earth, with the heroes traveling the universe to rid it of Ming&#x27;s influence. Lothar, Mandrake&#x27;s ally, had become the new Phantom after the death of the recent incarnation, swearing to train the next rightful heir to the mantle.

==Reception==
Ian Keogh of &quot;Slings and Arrows&quot; gave the series two stars, criticizing its lackluster storyline and poor imitation of 1940s sequential art. Joe Douglas from the &quot;Phantom Fan&quot; had a more positive review, stating, &quot;While it may not do anything hugely original, &quot;Kings Quest&quot; is worth tracking down if you’re a fan of any of the classic characters involved or just enjoy a fun, lighthearted adventure.&quot;

==Sequel==
The comic book series was followed by &quot;Flash Gordon: Kings Cross&quot;, which continues the story of the same team.

<doc id="899662" wikidata="Q1269048" url="?curid=899662" title="Donna Brazile">
<text>Donna Lease Brazile ( ; born December 15, 1959) is an American political strategist, campaign manager, and political analyst who served twice as acting Chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). She is currently an ABC News contributor, and was previously a Fox News contributor until her resignation in May 2021. Brazile was also previously a CNN contributor, but resigned in October 2016, after WikiLeaks revealed that she shared two debate questions with Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign during the 2016 United States presidential election.

A member of the Democratic Party, Brazile was the first African-American woman to direct a major presidential campaign, acting as campaign manager for Al Gore in 2000. She has also worked on several presidential campaigns for Democratic candidates, including Jesse Jackson and Walter Mondale–Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, and for Dick Gephardt in the 1988 Democratic primary. She served as the acting chair of the Democratic National Committee in spring 2011, and again from July 2016 to February 2017.

==Early life==
Brazile was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the daughter of Jean Marie (Brown) and Lionel Joseph Brazile, the third of nine children. Her family&#x27;s surname was &quot;Braswell&quot; several generations prior. Brazile became interested in politics at the age of nine when a local candidate for office promised to build a neighborhood playground. She participated in a TRIO Upward Bound program while in high school. Brazile earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in industrial psychology from Louisiana State University (LSU) in 1981, and was a fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government. After graduating from LSU, Brazile worked for several advocacy groups in Washington, D.C., and was reportedly instrumental in the successful campaign to make Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s birthday a federal holiday.

Brazile volunteered for the Jimmy Carter–Walter Mondale presidential campaign of 1976 as a teenager and for their 1980 presidential campaign while a student at LSU.

==Political strategist==
Brazile has worked on several presidential campaigns for Democratic candidates, including Jesse Jackson in 1984, Walter Mondale–Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, and Dick Gephardt in the 1988 Democratic primary.

After Gephardt lost the primary in 1988, Brazile served as deputy field director of the Michael Dukakis general election campaign. On October 20, 1988, she made headlines by telling a group of reporters that George H. W. Bush needed to &quot;fess up&quot; about unsubstantiated rumors of an extramarital affair. Said Brazile, &quot;The American people have every right to know if Barbara Bush will share that bed with him in the White House.&quot; The Dukakis campaign immediately disavowed her remarks and Dukakis fired her from his campaign staff shortly after the story broke. Four years later, the same issue, the relationship of George H. W. Bush and Jennifer Fitzgerald, would be briefly rehashed during the 1992 campaign against Bill Clinton, who had his own extramarital affair rumors.

In the 1990s, Brazile served as chief of staff and press secretary to Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia, where she helped guide the District&#x27;s budget and local legislation on Capitol Hill. She also served as an advisor for Bill Clinton&#x27;s campaign for the presidency in 1992 and for re-election in 1996.

In 1999, Brazile was appointed deputy campaign manager and was later promoted to campaign manager of the 2000 presidential campaign of Vice-President Al Gore, becoming the first African-American woman to manage a major party presidential campaign.

After the Hurricane Katrina disaster, Brazile was appointed as a member of the board of directors of the Louisiana Recovery Authority by Kathleen Blanco from 2005 to 2009. Brazile donated her papers to the Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections in the Louisiana State University Libraries Special Collections, located in Hill Memorial Library.

==Democratic National Committee service==
After the post-election fight over votes in the 2000 United States presidential election in Florida, Brazile was appointed chair of the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s Voting Rights Institute.

===2008 presidential election===

In the 2008 election, she served as a superdelegate for her work for Bill Clinton and Al Gore.

As a delegate for the Democratic National Convention, Brazile consistently refrained from declaring her preferred Democratic presidential candidate. In an interview with political satirist Stephen Colbert, Brazile stated, &quot;Look, I&#x27;m a woman, so I like Hillary. I&#x27;m black; I like Obama. But I&#x27;m also grumpy, so I like John McCain.&quot;

The 2008 Democratic presidential primaries in Florida and Michigan initially caused the delegates from these two states to be disqualified from being seated at the Democratic Convention due to the states moving their primaries against DNC Party rules. Brazile stated, &quot;We need to send a message that you can&#x27;t defy the rules,&quot; adding, &quot;I have pissed off just about every state in my career.&quot;

At the Rules Committee meeting to decide on the final allocations for these states she was quoted: &quot;My momma taught me to play by the rules and respect those rules. My mother taught me, and I&#x27;m sure your mother taught you, that when you decide to change the rules, middle of the game, end of the game, that is referred to as cheating.&quot;

She was strongly critical of the Stupak–Pitts Amendment, which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act.

===2012 presidential election===
For several weeks in the spring of 2011, she served as interim chair of the Democratic National Committee. As vice-chair of the DNC, she led the organization during the transition between outgoing chair Tim Kaine, who resigned to run for the U.S. Senate, and his successor, Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was not permitted to ascend to the post until at least fifteen days after being nominated on April 5, 2011. Following Wasserman Schultz&#x27;s installation as DNC chair, Brazile returned to her post as vice-chair.

===2016 presidential election===
After Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned her position as chair of the Democratic National Committee on July 24, 2016, at the start of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Brazile became interim chairperson of the DNC.[73]

Brazile was responsible for a plan to spend money to drive up inner-city turnout in places like Chicago and New Orleans — even though neither Illinois nor Louisiana was competitive — because of fear that Clinton would win the Electoral College vote but lose the popular vote.

====Sharing debate questions with Clinton campaign====
A WikiLeaks e-mail dump revealed that Brazile sent an e-mail message on March 5, 2016, to John Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri with the title: &quot;One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.&quot; The message continued, &quot;her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.&quot; At the next event in Flint, Clinton was delivered a similar question from audience member Mikki Wade, whose family was affected by the poisoned water.

On October 11, 2016, a WikiLeaks e-mail dump included an e-mail Brazile sent on March 12, 2016 to Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri with the subject header: &quot;From time to time I get questions in advance.&quot; In the e-mail, Brazile discussed her concern about Clinton&#x27;s ability to field a question regarding the death penalty, and in a CNN town hall debate the following day, Clinton received a similar question about the death penalty. According to tech blog Errata Security, the e-mail in question was verified using an everyday verification program and the DKIM system.

Brazile at first vehemently denied receiving or furnishing the Clinton campaign with any town hall questions and dismissed the WikiLeaks organization as &quot;these sad ass whipper leakers try to slow my groove&quot;. She accused TYT Politics reporter Jordan Chariton of &quot;badgering a woman.&quot; Questioned by Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, Brazile said, &quot;As a Christian woman, I understand persecution. I will not sit here and be persecuted because your information is totally false.&quot;

Jake Tapper, a former colleague of Brazile&#x27;s at CNN, provided his perspective on the leak of a question to a Presidential candidate, calling it &quot;very, very upsetting&quot; and added that &quot;journalistically, it&#x27;s horrifying&quot;. Brazile, however, said that her conscience was &quot;very clear&quot;. She later commented: &quot;If I had to do it all over again, I would know a hell of a lot more about cybersecurity.&quot;

In a talk at the College of Journalism and Mass Communications on the University of Nebraska–Lincoln campus on October 12, 2016, Brazile condemned the leaks, which intelligence officials said came from Russia, and said they were intended to &quot;manipulate an election, disrupt or discredit or destroy our democracy&quot; and ultimately try to &quot;produce an outcome more favorable to them and their interests.&quot;

On October 31, 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported: &quot;CNN has severed ties with the Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, after hacked e-mails from WikiLeaks showed that she shared questions for CNN-sponsored candidate events in advance with friends on Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign.&quot; CNN said it had accepted her formal resignation on October 14, adding: &quot;We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.&quot;

On November 1, 2016, an internal call about the collusion was initiated by CNN President Jeff Zucker. Zucker informed his staff that, while the instances have been fully investigated and the perpetrators dealt with, the perception that campaigns received questions in advance &quot;hurts all of us,&quot; adding that, &quot;I have no tolerance for her behavior or that kind of behavior,&quot; going on to describe former network commentator Brazile&#x27;s interactions with the Clinton campaign as &quot;unethical&quot; and &quot;disgusting.&quot;

On March 17, 2017, Brazile admitted to forwarding debate questions to Clinton&#x27;s campaign during the 2016 Democratic primary, while she was Vice Chair of the DNC and working as a CNN commentator. In an essay she wrote for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, she said, &quot;Then in October, a subsequent release of e-mails revealed that among the many things I did in my role as a Democratic operative and D.N.C. Vice Chair prior to assuming the interim D.N.C. Chair position was to share potential town hall topics with the Clinton campaign.&quot; Brazile went on to explain: &quot;My job was to make all our Democratic candidates look good, and I worked closely with both campaigns to make that happen. But sending those e-mails was a mistake I will forever regret.&quot;

In her 2017 memoir &quot;Hacks&quot;, Brazile wrote about her &quot;alleged leaking of the questions.&quot;

==Other work==
===University teaching and affiliations===
Despite the scandal, Brazile went on to serve on various boards, including the National Democratic Institute (NDI), whose mission is to ensure free and fair elections. She was an election monitor in Kenya for the 2022 presidential elections. Brazile served as a lecturer at the University of Maryland, College Park, a fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s Institute of Politics, and is an adjunct professor of Women and Gender Studies at Georgetown University. She is member of the advisory board of the Washington and Lee University Mock Convention.

===Commentator===
Brazile was a weekly contributor and political commentator on CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Situation Room&quot; and appeared on &quot;American Morning&quot; and its successor, &quot;New Day&quot;. She regularly appeared on &quot;CNN Tonight with Don Lemon&quot;, and was a frequent member of Anderson Cooper&#x27;s guest panel of political experts on CNN&#x27;s Election Night Coverage. Brazile is also founder and managing director of Brazile and Associates and a contributor to NPR&#x27;s Political Corner and ABC News. Brazile had agreed mutually with both CNN and ABC to suspend her contracts with the networks in order to serve as interim chair of the DNC. On October 31, 2016, CNN announced that Brazile offered a formal resignation and that they were permanently severing their ties to Brazile as a CNN contributor, due to inappropriate leaks with the Clinton campaign while she worked for the network.

On March 18, 2019, Brazile became a contributor for Fox News. She stated that she was &quot;delighted to be joining FOX News&quot; while acknowledging her decision may be criticized by other Democrats.

===Author===
Brazile was a contributing writer for &quot;Ms. Magazine&quot; and a columnist for &quot;Roll Call&quot;. In 2004, Simon &amp; Schuster published &quot;Cooking with Grease – Stirring the Pots in American Politics&quot;, Brazile&#x27;s memoir of her life and work in politics. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal of &quot;The New York Times,&quot; &quot;While the book is primarily a charming autobiography about how a poor black girl came to run a presidential campaign, its publication is giving the refreshingly impolitic Ms. Brazile the opportunity to pour forth in writing and in interviews on larger issues, like what went wrong in 2000 and what the Democrats need to do to win in 2004.&quot;

Brazile is also the coauthor—with Yolanda Caraway, Leah Daughtry, and Minyon Moore—of &quot;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics&quot; (2018), a joint history and biography.

====&quot;Hacks: The Inside Story&quot;====

In July 2017, Hachette Books announced that it had acquired the rights to Brazile&#x27;s forthcoming book, &quot;&quot;, published on November 7, 2017. Hachette said the book would be &quot;equal parts campaign thriller, memoir, and roadmap for the future.&quot; Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn, partners at the literary and creative agency Javelin, represented Brazile in negotiations with Hachette. The work is &quot;a savage memoir of her experiences with Clinton&#x27;s campaign, which she describes as mismanaged and lacking in passion.&quot;

In an excerpt of the book published in &quot;Politico&quot; magazine, Brazile wrote that she had found an &quot;unethical agreement&quot; between the Clinton campaign and the DNC which had allowed Clinton to exert control of the party long before she became its nominee. Later, in an interview on ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot; on November 5, 2017, Brazile said that she had found no evidence of the Democratic primaries having been rigged in favor of Clinton.

Brazile writes that after Clinton fainted at a 9/11 memorial service on September 11, 2016, she gave serious consideration to replacing Clinton as the Democratic nominee, selecting Vice President Joe Biden in her place. Under the DNC charter, the party chair can declare a presidential nominee &quot;disabled,&quot; triggering a complex replacement process that involves a meeting of the full DNC. In the interview on ABC, she explained that she &quot;had a lot of other combinations. This is something you play out in your mind.&quot; On November 4, 2017, more than 100 former Clinton campaign staffers published an open letter saying they &quot;do not recognize the campaign she portrays in the book.&quot; They said they were shocked to learn that Brazile had considered replacing Clinton on the ticket and dismayed that Brazile had seemingly bought into &quot;false Russian-fueled propaganda&quot; about Clinton&#x27;s health.

The credibility of Brazile&#x27;s allegations also came under scrutiny by &quot;The Washington Post.&quot; In September 2015, the newspaper had already reported about the fundraising agreement between Hillary and the DNC which Brazile disclosed and noted that Sanders supporters knew about it. It was also reported that Brazile knew about the agreement before she publicly disclosed its details.

===Acting===
Brazile is a member of Screen Actors Guild‐American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and has guest-starred as herself in three episodes of the CBS drama &quot;The Good Wife&quot; and one episode of the Netflix drama &quot;House of Cards&quot;. She also cameoed as a fictionalized version of herself in &quot;Army of the Dead&quot; along with Sean Spicer.

==Personal life==
In 1999, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; described Brazile as a gay rights activist who served on the board of the Millennium March on Washington. The magazine said she is &quot;highly protective of her privacy&quot; and called her &quot;openly ambiguous&quot; about her sexual orientation.

Brazile is a Catholic and said she wanted to be a priest as a child but did not pursue this after her mother told her girls could not be priests.

<doc id="899664" wikidata="Q7015366" url="?curid=899664" title="New Zealand Film Commission">
<text>The New Zealand Film Commission (NZFC; ) is a New Zealand government agency formed to assist with creating and promoting New Zealand films. It was established under the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978 (as amended in 1981, 1985, 1988, 1994 and 1999).

==Functions and responsibilities==
The New Zealand Film Commission is a Crown entity working to grow the New Zealand film industry. Its statutory responsibility is to encourage, participate and assist in the making, promotion, distribution and exhibition of films made in New Zealand.

Through the financing and administration of incentive schemes it has been involved in more than 300 feature films including &quot;Boy&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie&quot;, &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;Avatar&quot;, &quot;Whale Rider&quot; and &quot;Mr. Pip&quot;.

It is also involved in some television series.

===Film financing and marketing===
The NZFC assists New Zealand filmmakers by providing grants, loans and equity financing in the development and production of feature films and short films. It administers the Government&#x27;s Large Budget Screen Production Grant (LBSPG) and Screen Production Incentive Fund (SPIF) and certifies New Zealand films for tax purposes and co-productions. It also actively markets New Zealand films and filmmakers, and organises high-profile New Zealand participation at major international film festivals and markets. It helps with training and career development within the industry by partnering with other industry organisations.

For example, in 2010 the NZFC unveiled a new program for funding films by filmmakers at the beginning of their careers who have creative ideas for their first feature film specifically designed for low-budget films. (&quot;Directors who have previously received feature film finance from the NZFC&quot; are ineligible.&quot;) Called Escalator, the scheme encourages teams, preferably including &quot;their director, writer, producer and possibly a key crew member&quot; to &quot;submit three different proposals for a low budget ([NZ]$250,000) feature film.&quot; From those applications, 12 teams are selected to participate in a multi-day &quot;bootcamp&quot; after which they are expected to &quot;prepare a script, production budget, schedule and statement of approach for one of their ideas.&quot; Peter Jackson praised the proposal for its &quot;speed or process,&quot; reminding his readers that &quot;much frustration has resulted from the slow pace at which a project limps through development at the NZFC.&quot;

In fact, the first film to be released with Escalator support was &quot;Existence&quot; (2012; directed by Juliet Bergh; co-written by Bergh and cinematographer Jessica Charlton), which was part of the scheme&#x27;s second cohort of applicants. The Commission played a role in bringing Mhairead Connor in as a producer as well as providing Berg and Charlton access to script development assistance from Graeme Tetley as part of their bootcamp experience.

The New Zealand Film Commission often works in conjunction with other government agencies, such as the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Ministry for Tourism and the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment.

===Film On Demand===
In 2014 the New Zealand Film Commission launched a transactional video on demand service, NZ Film On Demand. The site features NZ films for rent and purchase, with a library of films that will grow over time. The underlying technology of the platform was developed by Hamilton, New Zealand based company Indiereign.

===Records===
The main classes of records held include:
* Applications for financial assistance for development, production, distribution and promotion of New Zealand films;
* Contracts in respect of investments made by the commission; and
* Contracts in respect of sales of a New Zealand film represented by the commission.

==Structure==

The New Zealand Film Commission is governed by a seven-member board appointed by the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage. Members represent the film industry and the wider business and arts community. The Board meets every two months to set policy and budgets, monitor progress against targets and budgets and consider applications for feature film production financing.

Day-to-day activities are carried out by a staff of 46 from their Wellington office. The internal structure is based on four business units (Development and Production, Talent Development and Relationships, Marketing and Screen Incentives Administration) and three support groups (Business Affairs, Finance and Strategy and Research) all linked by strong connections across the organisation. Notable staff have included Mladen Ivančiċ, who was appointed as finance director in 1989 and retired in 2023 after serving as acting CEO on six different occasions.

==Controversies==
In 2019, the New Zealand Film Commission received public attention and criticism for its taxpayer-funded support of &quot;Wolf Warrior 2&quot;, a film described as Chinese propaganda.

In July 2024, the Film Commission attracted criticism after spending $16,431 on two parties for its outgoing chief executive David Strong and its incoming chief executive Anna Murray.

In October 2024, the Film Commission attracted criticism from Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Paul Goldsmith and the New Zealand Taxpayers&#x27; Union after spending over NZ$145,354.81 to send four staff members to attend the Cannes Film Market in May 2024. The money was reportedly spent on accommodation, food and drink and travel. In response, the Film Commission defended the trip, arguing that operating costs were lower than in 2023.

<text>Allan Gordon Sinclair, OC, FRGS (June 3, 1900 – May 17, 1984) was a Canadian journalist, writer, and commentator.

==Early life==
Sinclair was born in the Cabbagetown neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, the son of George Alexander and Bessie Goldie (née Eesley) Sinclair. In 1916, before finishing his first year of high school, he dropped out to take a job with the Bank of Nova Scotia. After a few months, he was fired and started working in the administrative office of Eaton&#x27;s. During World War I, he served as a part-time soldier in a militia unit of the 48th Highlanders of Canada. After being fired from Eaton&#x27;s, he took a junior bookkeeping job with Gutta Percha and Rubber Manufacturing Company, starting in April 1920. It was there that he met co-worker Gladys Prewett. After an off-and-on relationship, they married on May 8, 1926.

==International reporter for the &quot;Star&quot;==
Early in 1922, Sinclair applied for a reporting job at all four Toronto newspapers. The only offer he received was from the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, where he started working in February 1922, hired on the same day as Foster Hewitt, who was the son of the &quot;Star&quot; sports editor.

Sinclair was given routine assignments at the &quot;Star&quot; for seven years before he received his first byline. His breakthrough was a series of articles written after living among a group of homeless people, whom Sinclair called &quot;Toronto&#x27;s hobo club&quot; From that point, he rose to become one of the paper&#x27;s star reporters, spending most of the next decade travelling the world, filing reports from exotic locations. During an Asian tour in 1932, he spent four months in India and, after returning home, wrote his first book, &quot;Foot-loose in India&quot;. It was published in October 1932 and became a best-seller in Canada, with the first edition selling out on the first day.

Before the end of the year, Sinclair announced that his next trip would be to Southeast Asia. A public farewell was held on January 13, 1933, filling Massey Hall, with the &quot;Star&quot; estimating that an additional 6,500 people were turned away. His experiences on that trip were collected in a second book, &quot;Cannibal Quest&quot;, which was a best-seller in Canada and also reached No. 9 in the U.S. Then came a series from Devil&#x27;s Island, which was also turned into a book, &quot;Loose Among the Devils&quot;, published in 1935.

Later that year, Sinclair was fired by the &quot;Star&quot; after failing to get the story on the outbreak of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in Ethiopia. The &quot;Star&quot; reported that he was leaving journalism to take a job in advertising. The &quot;Star&quot; wrote that he had travelled 340,000 miles in 73 countries for the newspaper. At the time, he was working on his fourth book, &quot;Khyber Caravan&quot;, based on his travels in Afghanistan.

Doubts were frequently raised by readers that Sinclair had actually experienced the incidents he reported. His Khyber series was so widely questioned that the &quot;Star&quot; assigned another reporter to investigate his claims.

Sinclair&#x27;s time away from journalism was short-lived. Three months after joining the staff of MacLaren Advertising, he returned to the &quot;Star&quot;, this time as a sports columnist, hired shortly after the sudden death of sports editor Lou Marsh, who had been one of Canada&#x27;s best-known sports journalists. According to sportswriter Scott Young, Sinclair&#x27;s transition to sports was &quot;monumentally unsuccessful.&quot;

After a year in sports, Sinclair returned to general reporting and late in 1938 he again went on an Asian tour. He remained at home during the Second World War and was not accredited as a war correspondent.

==CFRB and &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot;==

Following the unsuccessful Dieppe Raid in 1942, Sinclair was asked by Red Foster, a news broadcaster at Toronto radio station CFRB, to provide some narration for a broadcast on Canadians at Dieppe. Sinclair ended up writing the story as well as reading it on the air, and continued to contribute brief reports to the station. Several months after he started, his radio work came to the attention of his bosses at the &quot;Star&quot;, which had a policy prohibiting its reporters from regularly writing reports for other outlets. Once again, Sinclair was fired.

In February 1943, he formally joined the CFRB team, becoming part-owner of the station the following year. He would continue to be associated with CFRB for over 40 years until his death.

He returned to the &quot;Star&quot; in 1949, this time as a freelancer, for one final international tour, which included his coverage of the end of the Berlin Blockade. He remained a contributor to the paper, writing a radio and TV column, until December 1962.

In 1957, Sinclair also began a career in television, as a panelist on the CBC Television series &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot;. He would hold that position for 27 years until his death. While Sinclair was often controversial, he caused an uproar in 1969 when he asked Canadian Olympic swimmer Elaine Tanner if menstruation interfered with her training.

Sinclair was a vocal opponent of water fluoridation (calling it &quot;rat poison&quot; in 1958), the singing of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, medicare and taxes. Although he was raised as a Methodist and taught Bible class as a youth, Sinclair became a forceful critic of religion and the church. &quot;I had 31 years of being a Christian, and it was enough,&quot; he said in 1969.

Sinclair had invested his earnings in the Depression-era stock market and was independently wealthy by the end of the Second World War. In 1960, he boasted that he earned more than $50,000 a year. By the end of his life, Sinclair reportedly had liquid assets of more than $2 million. He bought a Rolls-Royce in 1961 and drove it for 11 years.

Sinclair&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Will the Real Gordon Sinclair Please Stand Up&quot; was published in 1966, followed in 1975 by a sequel, &quot;Will Gordon Sinclair Please Sit Down&quot;.

==The Americans==
On June 5, 1973, following news that the American Red Cross had run out of money as a result of aid efforts for recent natural disasters, Sinclair recorded what would become his most famous radio editorial, &quot;The Americans&quot;. While paying tribute to American success, ingenuity, and generosity to people in need abroad, Sinclair decried that when America faced crisis itself, it often seemed to face that crisis alone.

At the time, Sinclair considered the piece to be nothing more than one of his usual items. But when &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; published a full transcript, the magazine was flooded with requests for copies. Radio station WWDC-AM in Washington, D.C., started playing a recording of Sinclair&#x27;s commentary with &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; playing in the background. Sinclair told the &quot;Star&quot; in November 1973 that he had received 8,000 letters about his commentary.

With the strong response generated by the editorial, a recording of Sinclair&#x27;s commentary was sold as a single with all profits going to the American Red Cross. &quot;The Americans (A Canadian&#x27;s Opinion)&quot; went to No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making the 73-year-old Sinclair the second-oldest living person ever to have a &quot;Billboard&quot; U.S. Top 40 hit (75-year-old Moms Mabley had a Top 40 hit in 1969 with &quot;Abraham, Martin &amp; John&quot;).

A transcript of the commentary was also recorded by Byron MacGregor, news director of Windsor, Ontario, radio station CKLW (AM), and it became an even bigger hit in the U.S., climbing to No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Sinclair was said to be annoyed by MacGregor&#x27;s recording, which was released as a single before Sinclair&#x27;s authorized version. At the time, CKLW was owned by Toronto media baron John W. H. Bassett. In Canada, Sinclair&#x27;s version peaked at No. 30, topping McGregor&#x27;s, which missed the top 40, stalling at No. 42.

In May 1974, Sinclair told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that he was &quot;sick of hearing&quot; the recording and embarrassed by some of the inaccuracies it contained, but that he would still write the same editorial over again.

In 1981, when Ronald Reagan made his first state visit to Canada, he praised Sinclair as a figure who had given the United States a wonderful and inspiring tribute in one of its darkest hours.

&quot;The Americans&quot; was widely revived on the Internet, radio and newspapers in 2001, following the September 11, 2001, attacks, and again in 2005 in the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Some revivals of the message incorrectly state that it was newly written as a direct response to recent crises; in this question of its authorship alone, the address has become a part of urban legend.

==Final years and death==
Sinclair was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1979, and added to the Etobicoke Hall of Fame in 1984. Up to the time of his death, he was doing 14 broadcasts a week for CFRB and also appearing on &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot;.

In his final commentary, broadcast on May 15, 1984, he discussed passing his annual driver&#x27;s test, which was compulsory for drivers over the age of 80. That day, Sinclair—who had had a series of heart attacks dating back to 1970—had a massive attack, going into a coma and suffering irreversible brain damage. He died two days later at age 83 after life support systems were discontinued. He was buried at Park Lawn Cemetery in Toronto.

Sinclair&#x27;s eldest son, Gord Sinclair (1928–2002), was also a successful and respected radio journalist in Montreal, as well as the majority owner of CFOX (AM).

<doc id="899668" wikidata="Q3604226" url="?curid=899668" title="Ace Lightning">
<text>Ace Lightning is a children&#x27;s television series co-produced by the BBC and Alliance Atlantis. The series was originally broadcast in the United Kingdom, but also aired in other countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The show was filmed in Canada, but the program was set in the United States. It ran for two seasons and spawned a number of merchandising products. The series premiered on 4 September 2002 and ended on 18 May 2005.

The programme featured live actors interacting with computer-animated characters from a fictional video game. The series is significant in that until its creation, live action and CGI had not been attempted to such a huge and constant degree within a weekly television series.

== Series overview ==
The series follows the life of British teenager Mark Hollander, who moved to the American town Conestoga Hills with his parents. One stormy night, Mark plays his favourite video game, the fictional &quot;Ace Lightning and the Carnival of Doom&quot;–a superhero-based adventure game where hero Ace Lightning traverses the Carnival of Doom to find the pieces of the magical Amulet of Zoar, whilst battling his nemesis Lord Fear. Mark stumbles across a mysterious seventh level, which is not meant to exist. A lightning bolt strikes the antenna on his roof, and through an electrical surge, the characters of the game come to life. Ace hires Mark as his sidekick to fulfil the game&#x27;s objectives in the real world. Mark&#x27;s life is turned upside down, and his duty as a Lightning Knight affects his school grades and social life, often forcing him to make excuses for his family and friends. Meanwhile, Lord Fear&#x27;s group of villains occupy the town&#x27;s rundown Kent Bros. Carnival.

Most episodes balanced Mark&#x27;s social issues and dealing with the game characters, and the animated characters fighting over the collected amulet pieces. The world and rules of the game played out in Conestoga Hill; for example, when two pieces of the Amulet were connected, a new character or weapon would be summoned. Four human characters learned of Mark&#x27;s double life, including his best friend Chuck Mugel, girlfriend Kat Adams, school teacher Mr. Cheseborough who comes to the belief that the characters are aliens, and Mark&#x27;s cousin Ashley. Another character who is aware of the goings on is Duff Kent, the owner of the carnival who is shanghaied into being a minion for Lord Fear. An ongoing story was the love triangle between Ace and villain Lady Illusion, who was Lord Fear&#x27;s mistress throughout the first season but betrays him in the finale.

The first season ended with Mark winning the game, with all the antagonists save Lady Illusion returning to the game world. In the second season, Chuck becomes Ace&#x27;s secondary sidekick, and all the villains return under the leadership of a new antagonist named Kilobyte. Kilobyte was created by Rick Hummel, a computer repairman and former games developer who took on the alias of the &quot;Master Programmer&quot;. Rick developed the program that brought the game to life, but was ridiculed and fired as a result. He desired to prove his worth by bringing the characters to life and ultimately conquering the world. A blackout in his shop allows Kilobyte to become independent, determined to rule the world. In the series finale, Ace and Lord Fear join forces and banish Kilobyte to the game world. However, Lord Fear turns on Ace and mortally wounds him, only to reveal that Lady Illusion took his place, and she dies in Ace&#x27;s arms.

== Episodes ==

=== Season 1 (2002–2003) ===
The season aired between September 2002 and March 2003. When broadcast in America, the episodes were shown out of order, which sometimes resulted in severe continuity errors. For instance, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; was shown before &quot;Once Upon a Hero.&quot; Random Virus would show up as an established character of the day before he would be established. The runtime of each episode was 24:59.

=== Season 2 (2004 (Canada) 2005 (UK)) ===

The second series was broadcast in most countries in 2004, but it aired in the United Kingdom during the summer of 2005 for unknown reasons. This season was not aired in the United States due to the poor reception of the first season. The graphics were greatly improved, and several of the characters, including Staff Head and Pigface, were changed to look more like the animals they resembled. Kilobyte, Rotgut, Kat Adams and Rick the Master Programmer made their debut in this season. Chuck also met the Lightning Knights, and Mark got his own weapon, allowing him to battle the villains. There were only 13 episodes with one overall storyline. The runtime of each episode was also 24:59.

== Production ==
The show was developed by BBC and Alliance Atlantis, with Rick Siggelkow as executive producer and creator of the show, and Jim Corston as head writer. Originally, the program&#x27;s plot was to feature a superhero from a comic book coming to life, but it was changed due to children playing videos games more than a pastime than reading comics. Mark was inspired by Spider-Man&#x27;s alter ego, Peter Parker. The series was in pre-production for two years and took a year and a half to complete the first season. The computer-generated characters and special effects were created by Calibre Digital Pictures, using the Maya system from Alias Systems Corporation.

Matt Ficner designed the computer-generated characters for the series and also provided the voices of Zip and Snip in the first season. The series was shot in Toronto in 2001 between 23 June and 22 November of that year.

==Reception==
According to the 2003–2004 annual review of BBC Worldwide&#x27;s children&#x27;s products, the series was a success and translated into different languages and forty countries, gaining high ratings in the United States on DIC Kids Network. The series received 1.2 million viewers on average during the first season&#x27;s airing in the United Kingdom.

However, a social argument occurred in 2004 regarding the series&#x27; content in relation to the Children&#x27;s Television Act. Children&#x27;s television analyst Dale Kunkel, a communication professor at the University of Arizona, described the series and &quot;Stargate Infinity&quot; as &quot;anti-social&quot;. The opinions were shared by the activist groups of the United Church of Christ and Center of Digital Democracy, viewing both programmes as violent. Former CEO of DIC Entertainment, Andy Heyward, defended &quot;Ace Lightning&quot;, taking the educational requirement very seriously for each episode. Heyward also had the support of Donald F. Roberts, who believed the descriptions given by the activists &quot;mischaracterizes&quot; the series they were attacking.

== Video game adaptation ==
A video game adaptation titled Ace Lightning was released on PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows, and Game Boy Advance on 25 October 2002. The game was developed by Absolute Studios and Tiertex Design Studios, and published by BBC Worldwide&#x27;s core game division, Gamezlab. It was only released in Europe.

The storyline follow the same storyline of the TV series, as Ace Lightning the player must collected the pieces of Amulet of Zoar, before Ace faces Lord Fear to defeat him.

<text>The Complete Psionics Handbook is a supplemental rulebook for the 2nd edition of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game, published in 1991 by TSR, Inc.

==Contents==
With &quot;The Complete Psionics Handbook&quot;, psionics in the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game became the domain of an entirely new class, the psionicist. The psionicist&#x27;s skills are based on the Wisdom and Constitution ability scores, and while humans can attain higher levels of expertise, all races are eligible for the class. Characters of chaotic alignment are not allowed to become psionicists, with the rationale being that volatile chaotic characters lack the discipline required to focus their mental energies. Psionic powers are assigned to six disciplines, which include clairsentience (divination), psychokinesis (animating and controlling existing objects and forces), psychometabolism (body-changing powers), psychoportation (teleportation variants), telepathy (mental communication and psychic attacks), and metapsionics (enhancement of other psychic abilities). Powers are designated as either sciences (major powers) or devotions (minor powers). As a psionicist gains experience and advances in level, he acquires more powers, and as a psionicist rises through the ranks, he also gains access to defense modes - special telepathic powers, which are received free of charge and don&#x27;t count against a psionicist&#x27;s normal power limits.

The use of psionic powers involves a variant of the proficiencies system developed in the 2nd Edition rules. Each power has a score rated in terms of a particular attribute. When attempting to use a power, the player makes a Power Check by rolling 1d20 and comparing the result to the Power Score. A roll less than or equal to the Power Score means success. Additionally, each power description includes a specific penalty suffered by the psionicist if a 20 is rolled. A psionicist has a fixed number of Psionic Strength Points, derived from his wisdom score, to expend on psionic powers. A psionicist expends the number of PSPs required by a particular power, then attempts a Power Check. If the check fails and the power doesn&#x27;t work, he forfeits half the PSP cost but is free to try again later. If he passes the check and the power is successful, the psionicist has the option of expending additional PSPs to maintain the power in subsequent rounds. Psionicists recover lost PSPs every hour in which no additional PSPs are expended. The less physical exertion, the more PSPs recovered; a walking PC recovers 3 PSPs per hour, and a resting PC recovers twice as many.

The book contains over 150 psionic powers, and includes an entire chapter on psychic combat. The book also includes psionic monsters, such as the thought eater and cerebral parasite. The book has a discussion of society&#x27;s reaction to psionicists, and a section describing the role of psionics in various TSR campaign settings.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Complete Psionics Handbook&quot; was published as a 128-page softcover book by TSR, Inc., with design by Steve Winter, and monster updates by Blake Mobley. Editing was by Andria Hayday, with illustrations by Terry Dykstra and Dee Barnett, and graphic design by Stephanie Tabat.

Tsr code 2117, ad&amp;d 2nd edition code PHBR5.

==Reception==
Rick Swan reviewed &quot;The Complete Psionics Handbook&quot; for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine #180 (April 1992). Swan gave the book a positive review, stating that while the large increase in the complexity of psionics from the 1st edition was intimidating, the system itself was straightforward and highly playable. Swan felt that the new book offered a number of elegant improvements over the previous system. He noted that the system&#x27;s use of &quot;power points&quot; was similar to the magic systems used in a number of other role-playing games, and that for the most part it offered a distinct alternative to &quot;D&amp;D&quot;&#x27;s magic options. Swan felt that although the book was comprehensive for players, it lacked adequate advice for game masters to integrate the system into a game, and that some of the details of the system were a hassle for game masters to keep track of.

Michael Lampman reviewed &quot;The Complete Psionics Handbook&quot; in &quot;Shadis&quot; #8 and said that &quot;Overall, the Handbook is good. While it could have been stronger in some spots, and the combat system could have used some more work, the Psionics Handbook is overall a fine addition to the gaming shelf of any AD&amp;Der wanting to use psychic abilities in his/her campaign, and as a source material for gamers of other systems interested in adding a wide variety of different psychic powers to their campaigns.&quot;

<doc id="899677" wikidata="Q7560849" url="?curid=899677" title="Sonatine bureaucratique">
<text>The Sonatine bureaucratique (&quot;Bureaucratic sonatina&quot;) is a 1917 piano composition by Erik Satie. The final entry in his humoristic piano music of the 1910s, it is Satie&#x27;s only full-scale parody of a single musical work: the Sonatina Op. 36 N° 1 (1797) by Muzio Clementi. In performance it lasts around 4 minutes.

Satie&#x27;s modern, irreverent reinterpretations of 18th Century music in this little pastiche have been hailed as a notable forerunner of Neoclassicism, a trend that would dominate Western concert hall music in the years between the World Wars.

==Music and texts==
Satie&#x27;s sonatina, even shorter than Clementi&#x27;s example, was composed in July 1917 and published the same year. The composition is in three tiny movements, of which the last one exposes some pseudo-development: the motifs of the first half of that movement are rearranged in another sequence by way of &quot;development section&quot;, or rather as the &quot;imitation&quot; of development.

From a formal point of view the sonatina is Satie&#x27;s most outspoken neoclassical composition. It is one of the exceptional piano compositions he wrote down with bar lines, which he probably would not have done if not for making an explicit reference to classicism.
Satie would write a &quot;neo-classical&quot; composition a few months after the succès de scandale of &quot;Parade&quot;. Satie was on friendly terms with Stravinsky from 1911, and after the latter had had his own &quot;succès de scandale&quot; with &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; in 1913 (premiered with the same Ballets Russes), he also moved towards neoclassicism – although for Stravinsky there was no distinct neoclassical composition published before Satie&#x27;s sonatina.

The partition is full of funny remarks: for example, the final movement is called &quot;Vivache&quot; instead of the original Vivace (&quot;vache&quot; being French for &quot;cow&quot;). Satie directs at least part of the fun at himself: the &quot;sourd muet&quot; (&quot;deaf-mute&quot;) from Lower Brittany, allegedly having provided the &quot;Peruvian air&quot; that forms the first theme of the last movement, is Satie himself. The sonatina can also be seen as the composition with which Satie concluded his series of &quot;funny&quot; three-part solo piano compositions, which he had begun in 1911.

==Premiere and reception==

Satie dedicated the &quot;Sonatine bureaucratique&quot; &quot;with friendship&quot; to the gifted young pianist Juliette Méerovitch (1896-1920), who gave its first public performance at the Salle Huyghens in Paris on December 1, 1917. A student of Alfred Cortot, Méerovitch won first prize in piano at the Paris Conservatoire in 1911 and was a vigorous champion of modern French music. She had previously teamed with Satie for the concert premiere of his ballet &quot;Parade&quot; in its piano 4-hands version in July 1917, the same month he wrote his sonatina. Author Jean Cocteau nicknamed her &quot;The Piano Tamer&quot; and future Les Six members Germaine Tailleferre, Francis Poulenc and Louis Durey dedicated works to her. Méerovitch&#x27;s sudden death at 24 (from an intestinal ailment) was widely lamented in the French music scene. Pianist Marcelle Meyer would take Méerovitch&#x27;s place as Satie&#x27;s favorite interpreter of his keyboard music during his last years.

The sonatina represents what biographer Steven Moore Whiting called &quot;the culmination and also the end of Satie&#x27;s humoristic piano music.&quot; His final compositions for that instrument, the &quot;Nocturnes&quot; (1919) and &quot;Premier Menuet&quot; (1920), were much more serious in tone.

Satie&#x27;s early biographers acknowledged the &quot;Sonatine bureaucratique&quot; as a precursor of Neoclassical music, but were otherwise unimpressed with the piece. Pierre-Daniel Templier (1932) relegated it to a footnote in his book, while Rollo H. Myers (1948) thought it was &quot;not remarkable musically except as a fairly successful but unexciting pastiche&quot;. Since then, however, it has become one of Satie&#x27;s more frequently performed and recorded works.

<doc id="899680" wikidata="Q1955725" url="?curid=899680" title="The Raven (The Stranglers album)">
<text>The Raven is the fourth studio album by English new wave band the Stranglers, released on 21 September 1979, through record label United Artists.

== Background ==

The first two songs, much of the artwork (the band is shown standing on the prow of a Viking longship on the back cover) and the album title refer to Norse mythology. The album deals with a variety of issues, including Japanese ritual suicide (&quot;Ice&quot;), heroin use (&quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Harry&quot;), the Iranian Revolution (&quot;Shah Shah a Go Go&quot;) and genetic engineering (&quot;Genetix&quot;).

&quot;Dead Loss Angeles&quot; features guitarist Hugh Cornwell playing bass guitar in conjunction with bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel, who wrote the song&#x27;s heavy bass line. No lead or rhythm guitars feature on the track, whose lyrics were written by Cornwell about his experiences in the United States.

&quot;The Raven&quot; is the first Stranglers album not produced by Martin Rushent, instead being produced by the band with engineer Alan Winstanley.

== Release ==
&quot;The Raven&quot; was released in September 1979. It reached No. 4 in the UK albums chart, remaining in the chart for eight weeks.

The album was originally released with a limited-edition 3D cover. Another limited edition had to be created when the band was forced to remove an image of Joh Bjelke-Petersen from the inner sleeve artwork. Bjelke-Petersen was the subject of the album&#x27;s sixth track, &quot;Nuclear Device (The Wizard of Aus)&quot;.

&quot;Duchess&quot; was the first and most successful single from the album, released on 10 August 1979 and reaching No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Nuclear Device (The Wizard of Aus)&quot; was the second single released; this reached No. 36 on the same chart. A four-track EP, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Harry&quot;, was released in November. In addition to the title track and a live version of &quot;In the Shadows&quot;, it also included &quot;Wired&quot; (taken from Cornwell and Robert Williams&#x27; forthcoming album &quot;Nosferatu&quot;) and a live version of &quot;Crabs&quot; (a track from Burnel&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Euroman Cometh&quot;). It reached No. 41.

<text>Going After Cacciato is an anti-war novel written by Tim O&#x27;Brien and first published by Delacorte Press in 1978. The novel is set during the Vietnam War. It is told from the third person limited point of view of an American soldier, Paul Berlin. Cacciato, one of Berlin&#x27;s squadmates, goes absent without leave (AWOL) to walk from Vietnam to Paris. The nonlinear narrative follows Berlin&#x27;s imagined chase of Cacciato across Eurasia; it is interspersed with Berlin&#x27;s memories of the Vietnam War prior to Cacciato&#x27;s departure.

&quot;Going After Cacciato&quot; won the 1979 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction.

==Plot and themes ==

The main conceit of &quot;Going After Cacciato&quot; is that American soldiers in Vietnam were required to walk nearly constantly; by Tim O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s estimation, the total distance walked in a standard tour of duty was as far as walking in a straight line from Vietnam to Paris.

Cacciato, an American soldier who is unintelligent but self-sufficient, happy, and untroubled by the larger questions of the war, goes AWOL. He intends to walk from Vietnam to Paris. Cacciato is pursued by Paul Berlin and the rest of the squad.

The protagonist, Paul Berlin, is a frustrated American soldier. While on watch duty one night, Berlin thinks about the past and daydreams about going to Paris. He remembers Cacciato&#x27;s desertion and imagines a journey in which Cacciato made it successfully to Paris, pursued by Berlin and the squad the entire way. The courage it takes to chase one&#x27;s dreams is a recurring theme which is often expressed through Paul Berlin&#x27;s reveries.

Typical of many stories that deal with themes of psychological trauma, &quot;Going After Cacciato&quot; is ambiguous about the nature, order, and reality of events that occur. The chronology is nonlinear for most of the book. Surreal events occur, such as Cacciato flying off a mountain, or the squad falling into an endless tunnel complex and, finding no exit, simply deciding to fall out of the tunnels to escape.

==Characters==
*Paul Berlin - Narrator and protagonist, Paul Berlin imagines the prolonged chase after Cacciato. In his mind, Cacciato and Berlin&#x27;s squad eventually reach Paris.
*Cacciato - The soldier from Berlin&#x27;s squad who goes AWOL with the intention of reaching Paris. Cacciato is frequently described by his squadmates as unintelligent and he is shown to be dangerously unconcerned in combat. His first name is not known; Cacciato is his last name, meaning &quot;hunted&quot; or &quot;caught&quot; in Italian.
*Sarkin Aung Wan - A Burmese refugee, and later Berlin&#x27;s romantic interest, who saves the squad many times as she accompanies them on the journey to Paris.
*Doc Peret - The medic in Berlin&#x27;s squad. He sometimes uses M&amp;M&#x27;s as medicine for those under his care, usually as a way to calm down the over-reactive and the dying. He enjoys philosophical debates.
*Oscar Johnson - A Black soldier in Berlin&#x27;s squad. He says that the cold weather in Vietnam reminds him of Detroit in the month of May, which he calls &quot;lootin&#x27; weather.&quot; It is implied that despite his posturing and claims, Johnson is not from Detroit: his mail comes from and goes to Maine, he cannot name recent players from any Detroit sports teams, and one of his nicknames is &quot;the nigga from Ba Haba.&quot; Johnson is responsible for convincing the squad that Lieutenant Martin must be killed.
*Lieutenant Sidney Martin - The West Point-educated previous lieutenant of the platoon containing Berlin&#x27;s squad. Martin insists on following military standard operating procedures (SOPs). One of the official SOPs he follows is the process of searching tunnels prior to collapsing them with explosives; the unofficial but widely accepted procedure is to simply collapse the tunnels without searching them. Martin firmly enforces the official SOP, leading to the deaths of Frenchie Tucker and Bernie Lynn. The squad&#x27;s refusal to search tunnels solidifies after the deaths and they attempt to plead with Martin, but he sternly restates that they must search tunnels before collapsing them. In the end, all the men in the squad agree to kill Martin. The circumstances of Martin&#x27;s death are not specified except that it occurs while he is in the tunnels. It is repeatedly implied that Oscar Johnson fragged Martin.
*Frenchie Tucker - A soldier who dies in a tunnel after being shot through the nose.
*Bernie Lynn - A soldier who is fatally shot below the throat when he tries to retrieve Frenchie Tucker from the tunnel.
*Lieutenant Corson - Frequently referred to simply as &quot;the lieutenant&quot;, Corson takes command of the platoon containing Berlin&#x27;s squad after Lieutenant Martin dies. Corson is a career soldier who has been demoted from captain to lieutenant twice. He is nominally the commanding officer of Berlin&#x27;s squad as they follow Cacciato, though he is often ill with dysentery. As the soldiers move west from Vietnam through Asia and Europe, Corson feels he is too old for the war and wants to return to his home. Doc diagnoses Corson as suffering from nostalgia and homesickness. When the squad stops in the Indian city of Delhi, Corson is temporarily cured when he meets a woman, a married hotelier who had studied in Baltimore, Maryland. He becomes sick again when the squad moves on.
*Stink Harris - A violent soldier who leads Berlin&#x27;s squad and suffers from ringworm.
*Harold Murphy - A soldier in Berlin&#x27;s squad who carries an M60 machine gun. Early on, Murphy leaves the mission to retrieve Cacciato since he feels it is pointless.
*Eddie Lazzutti - A soldier in Berlin&#x27;s squad who is proud of his voice and so typically carries the squad&#x27;s radio.
*Captain Fahyi Rhallon - An officer of the Iranian SAVAK who arrests the squad in Tehran.
*Billy Boy Watkins - A soldier from Berlin&#x27;s squad who dies on the first day Berlin sees combat. Watkins dies after he stepped on a defective land mine which severs his foot. Although not mortally wounded, Watkins enters a state of shock and dies. Doc Peret claims Watkins died of fright. The death of Watkins is frequently referred to and jokes about by the soldiers, sometimes accompanied by a short song that the squad sung about his death. The jokes and songs the squad make about Watkins demonstrate how the soldiers cope with the death around them by morphing tragedy into comedy to lessen their fear.
*Buff - A soldier whose nickname is short for &quot;Water Buffalo&quot;. Buff is known for his big size. He dies while the platoon is trying to cross a field. Berlin commonly refers to his death as &quot;life after death&quot; because Buff&#x27;s face remains in his helmet after he is killed.
*Jim Pederson - A religious soldier who distributes pictures of Jesus Christ to villagers. He is afraid of flying, and after a hard descent in a Chinook helicopter, a disoriented Pederson wades through a rice paddy with his eyes closed. He steps into the line of fire of the Chinook&#x27;s door gunners and is shot multiple times. As Pederson dies, he attempts to shoot down the departing Chinook with his M16 rifle.
*Ready Mix - A soldier who had died during the assault of a hill in the Highlands. No one knew his real name; a common superstition among soldiers in Vietnam was that it was best not to get to know people who might die at any time.
*Rudy Chassler - A soldier who dies after stepping on a land mine.
*Ben Nystrom - A soldier who shot himself in the foot to ensure he would be discharged from active duty.
*Vaught - A soldier who is discharged from service after losing an arm to infection from a self-inflicted bayonet wound.

== Style ==

The Famous Authors website writes, &quot;His incorporation of metaphysical approach attributed a rich quality to his writing style. ... According to him, sometimes the fictional truth is more realistic than [the] factual one. It is because of the fact that fictional truth appeals to the emotion and feelings which makes the literature more meaningful.&quot;

As a Study Guide notes, the story is told in the third person from Paul Berlin&#x27;s point of view. Paul Berlin&#x27;s narrative jumps from his current situation to a (possibly) imaginary observation post where he is on guard duty, to another imaginary trip from Vietnam to Paris, chasing a deserter named Cacciato. Berlin&#x27;s last name suggests the divisions in his thinking, moods, and desires; Berlin, Germany was divided by the victorious powers following World War II, and remained so at the time of the novel&#x27;s writing.

Readers have found many passages puzzling; the LitCharts editors explain, &quot;There are scenes in the novel that seem extremely realistic, scenes that require the suspension of disbelief, and some scenes that are nothing short of impossible — indeed, the plot of the book itself (a group of US soldiers travels all the way from Vietnam to Paris in search of a soldier from their platoon who has wandered off) sounds like a fairy tale. ... The issue, then, is understanding O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s blend of the believable and the unbelievable, and incorporating it into our comprehension of the book... One of the most common phrases critics used to describe &quot;Going After Cacciato&quot;, at least at the time, was &#x27;magical realism.&#x27;&quot;

An example occurs in Chapter 36 (entitled, fittingly, &quot;Flights of Imagination&quot;)

A miracle, Paul Berlin kept thinking. It was all he wanted -- a genuine miracle to confound natural law, a baffling reversal of the inevitable consequences. ... A miracle, he thought, and closed his eyes and made it happen. And then a getaway car -- why not? It was a night of miracles, and he was a miracle man. So why not? Yes, a &quot;car&quot;. Cacciato pointed at it, shouted something, then disappeared.

The reality of Cacciato himself has been put in doubt by some critics. Interior evidence suggests that Paul Berlin might be conflating Cacciato with himself. Paul thinks that

There was something curiously unfinished about Cacciato. Open-faced and naive and plump, Cacciato lacked the fine detail, the refinements and final touches, that maturity ordinarily marks on a boy of seventeen years. The result was blurred and uncolored and bland. You could look at him then look away and not remember what you&#x27;d seen.

He also sees Cacciato&#x27;s face in the moon floating above the squad and as &quot;fuzzy, bobbing in and out of mist&quot; (p. 10) -- pretty much in any environment in which Paul Berlin finds himself.

Paul Berlin occasionally finds himself explaining or translating for Cacciato. When the men first leave their post and first spot Cacciato in the mountains, they see through binoculars that he opens his mouth to speak; then thunder roars. The other soldiers speculate that Cacciato is trying to emulate a chicken, trying to squawk and fly. It is Paul who tells the lieutenant that what Cacciato said was &quot;Good-bye.&quot; (p. 11)

Florman and Kestler argue that &quot;At many points, it&#x27;s suggested that the story of Berlin&#x27;s journey from Vietnam to Paris — in other words, the plot of the novel we&#x27;re reading — is a story Berlin is telling himself as a way of coping with his fear and anxiety. It&#x27;s as if the more fantastic parts of the book are playing out in one man&#x27;s head — not because he believes they could really happen, but because he needs to believe in something.&quot;

== Critical reception ==

Richard Freedman, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and suggesting that Cacciato is a Christ figure, said, &quot;By turns lurid and lyrical, &quot;Going After Cacciato&quot; combines a surface of realistic war reportage as fine as any in Michael Herr&#x27;s recent &quot;Dispatches&quot; with a deeper feel -- perhaps possible only in fiction -- of the surrealistic effect war has on the daydreams and nightmares of the combatants. To call &quot;Going After Cacciato&quot; a novel about war is like calling &quot;Moby Dick&quot; a novel about whales.&quot; Freedman sees influences by Ernest Hemingway and says, &quot;...far from being a high-minded, low-voltage debate on the rights and wrongs of Vietnam, &quot;Going After Cacciato&quot; is fully dramatized account of men both in action and escaping from it.&quot;

<text>Wolf Dog, also known as A Boy and His Dog, is a 1958 Western film directed and produced by Sam Newfield and produced by Regal Films. The film stars Jim Davis and Allison Hayes.

==Plot==
==Cast==
*Jim Davis

==Production==
In August 1957, Newfield and a camera crew filmed the movie in and around Markdale, Ontario, near Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada.

The movie co-starred Hollywood actors Jim Davis, Allison Hayes and John Hart along with Canadian actors Austin Willis and Tony Brown. Several locals were offered a chance to be unpaid &quot;extras&quot;. Among those were Paul Hutton, Jerry Bartley, Constable Clarence Bowins, David Jackson, Officer Jack Johnston, Ron Wyvill, Don Wyvill.

==Reception==
While not an artistic or commercial success, the film is noteworthy in that it was created almost 40 years before Telefilm Canada and federal government subsidies enabled big-name movies to be filmed in Canadian locales. Markdale residents were delighted to have Hollywood make a film in their town.

It was hoped a film set in &quot;The Great North Country&quot; would be a crossover hit in the U.S. and the Commonwealth, both lucrative movie markets. For reasons unknown, the film disappeared from the public eye for almost 50 years. An unsubstantiated rumor suggested one of the main actors wanted all traces of the film destroyed. The only known copies of the film are an incomplete version stored at the National Archives of Canada and a complete version at the U.S. Library of Congress.

Copies of the movie can be found at the Markdale Public Library, Ontario, Canada, donated by the creator of the fan site, Jeff Wilson. He, along with actors from the film, Ron Wyvill and Paul Hutton, appeared in a short documentary made by Rogers Television, Owen Sound. Wilson and Wyvill also organized several screenings in the town of Markdale, Ontario, where the film was originally shot. There is also a link to a radio interview with Ron Wyvill on YouTube which can be found under the channel Toonguy85, belonging to Wilson.

<doc id="899702" wikidata="Q2915519" url="?curid=899702" title="Marshmallow creme">
<text>Marshmallow creme (also called marshmallow fluff, marshmallow stuff, marshmallow spread, marshmallow paste, or simply fluff) is a marshmallow confectionery spread similar in flavor, but not texture, to regular solid marshmallow. One brand of marshmallow creme is Marshmallow Fluff, which is used to make the fluffernutter sandwich, a New England classic comfort food which debuted in 1918 in Massachusetts, just a year after marshmallow creme was invented.

==History==
Many late-19th-century &quot;marshmallow paste&quot; recipes produced solid foods. The earliest mention of marshmallow creme in an American cookbook is from &quot;Fannie Farmer&#x27;s Boston School Cook Book&quot;, printed in 1896. However, the author does not give a recipe for marshmallow cream in this book, instead giving a recipe for marshmallow paste in the cake filling section. In 1902, &quot;Mrs. Rorer&#x27;s New Cook Book&quot; by Sarah Tyson Rorer describes her recipe for &quot;marshmallow filling&quot;.

In 1910, ice cream company Limpert Brothers in Vineland, New Jersey created a product of the same name, intended as a dessert topping. The company is sometimes credited as the inventor of Marshmallow Fluff.

Around the beginning of the 20th century, Somerville, Massachusetts, resident and inventor of the product Archibald Query started selling his version door-to-door. He soon afterward sold the recipe to two candy makers in Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred Mower, for $500. The product first hit market shelves in cans as Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff in 1917. The first two words were dropped soon after the packaging changed to a glass jar in the 1940s. Today, the Durkee-Mower company is one of only three companies in North America to produce marshmallow creme, the other products being Kraft Jet-Puffed Marshmallow Creme and Solo Marshmallow Creme. Fluff&#x27;s ingredients include corn syrup, sugar syrup, vanilla flavor, and egg whites.

Fluff continues to be a regional tradition in the Northeastern United States. Since at least 2006, the city of Somerville has celebrated Query&#x27;s original creation of Fluff with an annual festival in Union Square titled What the Fluff?. Typical activities at the festival have included Fluff-themed science fairs, a marshmallow launching robot from Somerville High School&#x27;s FIRST Robotics team with their s&#x27;morebot, gallery shows, cooking contests, and carnival games. In 2011, actress Susan Olsen, most famous for portraying Cindy Brady on the &quot;Brady Bunch&quot;, attended the festival, where she sold her Fluff-inspired art.

==Uses==

One popular use for marshmallow creme is in the &quot;fluffernutter&quot;, a Fluff and peanut butter sandwich. In 2006, State Representative Kathi-Anne Reinstein planned to file a bill that would make the fluffernutter the official sandwich of Massachusetts.

Marshmallow creme is also a traditional confection in Arabic cuisine, where it is commonly referred to as soapwort meringue (). The original recipe is based on soapwort (roots of &quot;Saponaria officinalis&quot;) or roots of the marshmallow plant, but modern commercial varieties are nearly identical to marshmallow creme manufactured in North America. It was mentioned in a tenth-century Arabic cookbook, &quot;Kitab al-Ṭabīḫ&quot; (&quot;The Book of Dishes&quot;) by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq.

According to a 2006 &quot;Boston Globe&quot; article, Massachusetts State Senator Jarrett Barrios proposed a restriction on the number of weekly servings of fluffernutter sandwiches in the form of an amendment to a bill that would limit junk food in schools. Attention on this issue was widespread, with news outlets as far as California reporting on the controversy. The proposal was later dropped.

<text>Veryan (Cornish: &quot;Elerghi&quot;) is a coastal civil parish and village on the Roseland Peninsula in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The village has been described as one of Cornwall&#x27;s loveliest inland villages and as ′a mild tropic garden′ by John Betjeman. It is probably best known for the round-houses, built by the vicar Jeremiah Trist in the early 19th century.

==Geography==
The southern boundary of the parish is along the English Channel from the Pendower stream in the west to Portholland in the east. To the west is the parish of Gerrans and on the east is St Michael Caerhays. Veryan is bounded by the parishes of Philleigh, Ruan Lanihorne and Tregony in the north. The parish comprises of land and of water.

The A3078 is the main form of communication and runs along the north of the parish from St Mawes joining the A390 at Probus. The nearest railway stations are at Truro and St Austell. The main settlements are Veryan Churchtown, Veryan Green, Portloe and the smaller hamlets of Trewartha, Treviskey, Carne and Camels.
Veryan is served by a post office (Veryan and Portloe Stores) and a public house (the New Inn).

==History==

Veryan was originally mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as the manor of Elerchi (now Elerkey in street names etc.), which was derived from &#x27;elerch&#x27;, the Cornish for &#x27;swan&#x27;. The origin of the name is by corruption of &quot;Symphorian&quot; to &quot;Severian&quot; and then &quot;Saint Veryan&quot;. The church is one of the few in west Cornwall for which there is no evidence of its existence before the Norman Conquest. The church was given by the lord of the manor of Elerky to the monks of Montacute in Somerset, 1110, but a later lord, John de Montacute, gave it to the Dean and Chapter of Exeter, ca. 1220, and they held it until 1859. The parish church of St Symphorian has an unusual plan with a tower south of the south transept and a north aisle. Parts of the church are Norman and others Decorated in style.

Melinsey Mill is situated within Veryan. The mill itself was built in 1565 and now the site stands as a tourist attraction which serves food.

In the 19th century Veryan&#x27;s vicar and local land owner Jeremiah Trist expanded the village&#x27;s buildings. He convinced parishioners to attend church on a regular basis, and built two schools and a series of round houses. The school for boys was built in 1814, and on its site now stands the present infant and junior school. A &quot;school of industry&quot; for girls was also built, now a thatched house behind the New Inn. The round houses were built between 1815 and 1818 by Trist, inspired by one in St Winnow. There is a pair at the entrance to the village at Veryan Green and another two at village entrance on the Pendower road. All four are thatched, while a fifth behind the school has a slate roof. Trist installed crosses on each of the houses and they were said to deter the devil from entering the village. The large house, Parc Behan, overlooking the church was also built by Trist as his dwelling: the vicarage was too small and in a bad state of repair.

===Carne Beacon===
Carne Beacon, lying a mile from Veryan, is said to be the burial place of the Cornish saint, King Gerennius (Geraint). Local folklore suggests that the burial mound contains the golden boat with silver oars, on which his body was brought across Gerrans Bay. There is no archaeological evidence for the existence of this boat.
During World War II, Carne Beacon became the site of the very first Cornish above ground aircraft reporting post. It opened in January 1940 as part of No 20 Group Truro and was designated the name of T2 Veryan Post. The site was chosen because of its advantageous views over the sea. Local residents strongly objected to its placing on such a hallowed point but they were overruled by the Air Ministry. The view was excellent for this post which was a wooden structure some 3 metres by 4 metres square. The post consisted of an observation area with aircraft plotting instrument and a small space for making refreshments and gaining shelter. They communicated by a land line telephone to Truro where the main operations room was based. It was continuously patrolled and had to report every aircraft in a ten-mile radius. It was later equipped with high frequency radio which enabled it to communicate with aircraft that sent out distress signals. It was later refurbished with concrete and remained in use after the war mainly manned in villagers spare time. In 1962 the site closed and moved to Nare Head. The site was demolished and some remains are viewable at the Veryan Post Museum. In present-day all that remains of the post are its concrete foundations.

===Local government===
In 1894 Veryan became part of the Truro Rural District which was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and Veryan became part of 
Carrick District Council. The district was abolished in 2009 and Veryan now falls under the unitary Cornwall Council. Veryan also elects eleven councillors to the parish council. The vicarage cross consists of an ancient shaft with a modern base and cross head; it was erected early in the 20th century.

==Sport==
Veryan Sports and Social Club was opened in 1984 and provide facilities for cricket, bowling and tennis. Veryan Cricket Club was founded in 1860, although the game was played much earlier with a writer from &quot;The West Briton&quot; newspaper crediting Trist as inspiring the locals to play cricket since 1810. The team joined the Cornwall Cricket League in 1951 and played in Senior 1 East in 1983; the highest level in Cornwall at that time. They currently have two teams playing in Division 2 East and Division 6 Central. Their most famous player was David Halfyard.

Veryan Football Club play in the Duchy League and are the current champions of the second division; level 16 in the English pyramid system.

==Tourism==
Veryan attracts tourism due to its location on the Roseland Peninsula and has bed and breakfasts, hotels and guest houses. The round houses are also a factor in the parish&#x27;s tourism interest and are rented out for accommodation. Veryan is also popular because of its location near the South West Coast Path, a route for keen walkers in Cornwall. Locals also let visitors use the Indoor Bowling Green. The village also has a Sports Pavilion with provision for tennis, cricket, bowls and a children’s playground. Carne Beacon also attracts visitors as it is open to the public with prior contact.

==Film and television==
Various scenes for the 1992 television drama series &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot;, based on Mary Wesley&#x27;s book of the same name, were filmed in Veryan (Broom Parc House) and on the coast at nearby Portloe.

<text>Maurice de Broglie, 6th [[Duke of Broglie]] (27 April 1875 – 14 July 1960) was a French physicist. His younger brother was the theoretical physicist Louis de Broglie.

==Biography==

===Early years===
De Broglie was born in Paris, to Victor de Broglie and Pauline de La Forest d&#x27;Armaillé (1851–1928). Pauline&#x27;s parents were Louis de La Forest d&#x27;Armaillé, Comte d&#x27;Armaillé and Marie Célestine Amélie d&#x27;Armaillé, the writer.

In 1901, he was married to Camille Bernou de Rochetaillée (1888–1966) in Paris. They had one daughter, Laure, born on 17 November 1904, who died, aged six, on 12 June 1911. He acceded to the title of duc de Broglie on his father&#x27;s death in 1906. He died on 14 July 1960 in Neuilly-sur-Seine. His only child having died almost a half-century before, his brother Louis succeeded him as duke.

Having graduated from naval officer&#x27;s school, Maurice de Broglie spent nine years in the French Navy, serving on a gunboat at Bizerte and in the Mediterranean Squadron. While serving, he became interested in physics, and began doing research on electromagnetism. De Broglie defied his family&#x27;s wishes and left the navy in 1904 to pursue a scientific career. He studied under Paul Langevin at the Collège de France in Paris, receiving his doctorate in 1908.

===Career===
De Broglie made advances in the study of X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy. During the First World War, he worked on radio communications for the navy. After the war, he resumed his research at a large laboratory in his home. He occasionally collaborated with his younger brother Louis, who followed his professional lead and was training as a physicist, and they coauthored a paper in 1921. After Louis de Broglie&#x27;s rise to prominence in the 1920s, building on some of their shared research, the elder de Broglie physicist continued his own research. While Louis was primarily a theoretician, Maurice&#x27;s focus was mainly experimental.

De Broglie became a member of the Académie des sciences in 1924, and in 1934 was elected to the Académie française, replacing the historian Pierre de La Gorce. He had the unique honor of welcoming his own brother into the academy on the latter&#x27;s induction. In 1942 he succeeded his mentor, assuming Langevin&#x27;s chair in physics at the Collège de France. He was also elected to the Royal Society of London on 23 May 1940, having received the Royal Society&#x27;s Hughes Medal in 1928.

<text>The Avridge Farm is a comic strip created, written and drawn by Canadian cartoonist Jeff Wilson in 1987. The feature has appeared in dozens of community dailies, weeklies and farm specialty publications ever since.

The feature chronicles the trials and tribulations of hapless farmer Irv Avridge and his family as they adapt to farm life. This plot is further improved by the sarcastic and often inspiring asides by the family&#x27;s precocious livestock. In 1993, Wilson published the treasury book &quot;Sincerely Chores&quot;, which features a collection of published &quot;Avridge Farm&quot; comic strips.

<text>The Caledonians (; or &#x27;; , &quot;Kalēdōnes&quot;) or theCaledonian Confederacy were a Brittonic-speaking (Celtic) tribal confederacy in what is now Scotland during the Iron Age and Roman eras. 
The Greek form of the tribal name gave rise to the name &quot;Caledonia&quot; for their territory. The Caledonians were considered to be a group of Britons, but later, after the Roman conquest of the southern half of Britain, the northern inhabitants were distinguished as Picts, thought to be a related people who would have also spoken a Brittonic language. 
The Caledonian Britons were thus enemies of the Roman Empire, which was the state then administering most of Great Britain as the Roman province of Britannia.

The Caledonians, like many Celtic tribes in Britain, were hillfort builders and farmers who defeated and were defeated by the Romans on several occasions. The Romans never fully occupied Caledonia, though several attempts were made. Nearly all of the information available about the Caledonians is based on predominantly Roman sources, which may be biased.

Peter Salway assumes that the Caledonians would have been Pictish tribes speaking a language closely related to Common Brittonic, or a branch of it augmented by fugitive Brythonic resistance fighters fleeing from Roman-occupied Britannia. The Caledonian tribe, after which the historical Caledonian Confederacy is named, may have been joined in conflict with Rome by tribes in northern central Scotland by this time, such as the Vacomagi, Taexali and Venicones recorded by Ptolemy. The Romans reached an accommodation with Brythonic tribes such as the Votadini as effective buffer states.

==Etymology==
According to German linguist Stefan Zimmer, &quot;Caledonia&quot; is derived from the tribal name (a Latinization of a Brittonic nominative plural n-stem or , from earlier ), which he etymologises as perhaps &#x27;possessing hard feet&#x27; (&quot;alluding to standfastness or endurance&quot;), from the Proto-Celtic roots &#x27;hard&#x27; and &#x27;foot&#x27;, with contracting to . The singular form of the ethnic name is attested as (a Latinization of the Brittonic nominative singular n-stem *) on a Romano-British inscription from Colchester.

==History==

In AD 83 or 84, the Caledonians, led by Calgacus, were defeated at the hands of Gnaeus Julius Agricola at Mons Graupius, as recorded by Tacitus. Tacitus avoids using terms such as &quot;king&quot; to describe Calgacus and it is uncertain as to whether the Caledonians had single leaders or whether they were more disparate and that Calgacus was an elected war-leader only. Tacitus records the physical characteristics of the Caledonians as red hair and long limbs.

In 122 AD construction began on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, creating a physical boundary between Roman controlled territory, and the land the Romans deemed as Caledonia.

An effort by the Romans to invade and conquer Caledonia was likely made sometime during or shortly after 139 AD. In 142 AD, construction began on the Antonine Wall roughly 100 km North of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in order to aid in the Roman push into Caledonian territory and to consolidate their conquest of southern Caledonian territory. The Romans later abandoned this wall (around 158) to return to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall to the south.

According to Malcolm Todd, the tribes of what is now Northern Britain and Scotland (probably including the Caledones) proved themselves to be &quot;... too warlike to be easily contained...&quot;, leading to the extensive garrisons left by the Romans to contest the tribes. Fraser and Mason argue that the Caledones likely did not directly attack or harass the Romans during this time, but may have had minor conflicts with other tribes.

In AD 180 the Caledonians took part in an invasion of Britannia, breached Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and were not brought under control for several years, eventually signing peace treaties with the governor Ulpius Marcellus. This suggests that they were capable of making formal agreements in unison despite supposedly having many different chieftains. However, Roman historians used the word &quot;Caledonius&quot; not only to refer to the Caledones themselves, but also to any of the other tribes (both Pictish or Brythonic) living north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, and it is uncertain whether these later were limited to individual groups or wider unions of tribes. It is possible that this was the peoples of Brigantia rather than the Caledones. By the latter half of the 2nd Century AD, the actual Caledones would have likely had the Maeatae peoples between themselves and the Antonine Wall. During the reign of Commodus, a series of regular payments appear to have been made to the Caledonians by the Romans, continuing into the first few years of Severus&#x27; reign, according to John Casey.

In 197 AD Dio Cassius records that the Caledonians aided in a further attack on the Roman frontier being led by the Maeatae and the Brigantes and probably inspired by the removal of garrisons on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall by Clodius Albinus. He says the Caledonians broke the treaties they had made with Marcellus a few years earlier (Dio lxxvii, 12).

The governor who arrived to oversee the regaining of control over Britannia after Albinus&#x27; defeat, Virius Lupus, was obliged to buy peace from the Maeatae rather than fight them.

According to James Fraser and Roger Mason, by the end of the 2nd century, the majority of Northern tribes had been merged in the Roman consciousness into either the Caledones or the Maeatae, leaving just those two tribes as the representatives of the region. The region itself had long been called Caledonia, and Malcolm Todd states that all residents were called Caledonians, regardless of tribal affiliations.

The Caledonians are next mentioned in 209, when they are said to have surrendered to the emperor Septimius Severus after he personally led a military expedition north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, in search of a glorious military victory. Herodian and Dio wrote only in passing of the campaign but describe the Caledonians ceding territory to Rome as being the result. Cassius Dio records that the Caledonians inflicted 50,000 Roman casualties due to attrition and unconventional tactics such as guerrilla warfare. Dr. Colin Martin has suggested that the Severan campaigns did not seek a battle but instead sought to destroy the fertile agricultural land of eastern Scotland and thereby bring about genocide of the Caledonians through starvation.

By 210 however, the Caledonians had re-formed their alliance with the Maeatae and joined their fresh offensive. A punitive expedition led by Severus&#x27; son, Caracalla, was sent out with the purpose of slaughtering everyone it encountered from any of the northern tribes. David Shotter mentions Caracalla&#x27;s dislike for the Caledonians and his wish to see them eradicated. Severus meanwhile prepared for total conquest but was already ill; he died at Eboracum (modern day York) in &quot;Britannia&quot; in 211. Caracalla attempted to take over command but when his troops refused to recognise him as emperor, he made peace with the Caledonians and retreated south of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall to press his claim for the imperial title. Sheppard Frere suggests that Caracalla briefly continued the campaign after his father&#x27;s death rather than immediately leaving, citing an apparent delay in his arrival in Rome and indirect numismatic and epigraphic factors that suggest he may instead have fully concluded the war but that Dio&#x27;s hostility towards his subject led him to record the campaign as ending in a truce. Malcolm Todd however considers there to be no evidence to support this. Peter Salway considers that the pressures on Caracalla were too high, and security of the Romans&#x27; northern frontier were secure enough to allow their departure. Nonetheless the Caledonians did retake their territory and pushed the Romans back to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

In any event, there is no further historical mention of the Caledonians for a century save for a c. AD 230 inscription from Colchester which records a dedication by a man calling himself the nephew (or grandson) of &quot;Uepogenus, [a] Caledonian&quot;. This may be because Severus&#x27; campaigns were so successful that the Caledonians were wiped out; however this is highly unlikely.
In 305, Constantius Chlorus re-invaded the northern lands of Britain although the sources are vague over their claims of penetration into the far north and a great victory over the &quot;Caledones and others&quot; (Panegyrici Latini Vetares, VI (VII) vii 2). The event is notable in that it includes the first recorded use of the term &#x27;Pict&#x27; to describe the tribes of the area.

==Physical appearance==

Tacitus in his &quot;Agricola&quot;, chapter XI (c. 98 AD) described the Caledonians as red haired and large limbed, which he considered features of Germanic origin: &quot;The reddish (&quot;rutilae&quot;) hair and large limbs of the Caledonians proclaim a German origin&quot;. Jordanes in his &quot;Getica&quot; wrote something similar:

Eumenius, the panegyrist of Constantine Chlorus, wrote that both the Picts and Caledonians were red haired (&quot;rutilantia&quot;). Scholars such as William Forbes Skene noted that this description matches Tacitus&#x27; description of the Caledonians as red haired in his Agricola.

James E. Fraser argues that Tacitus and other Romans were aware of methods of Caledonians dyeing their hair in order to achieve the stereotypical red colour, and that it was likely misinterpreted as an ethnic identifier. Fraser also mentions that the pressure put on the Northern tribes, forcing them to move, may have led to the creation of identifiers specific to certain tribes, such as clothing or jewellery; some of the earliest examples of such identifiers include armlets, earrings, and button covers, as well as decorated weaponry.

==Archaeology==

There is little direct evidence of a Caledonian archaeological culture but it is possible to describe the settlements in their territory during their existence.

The majority of Caledonians north of the Firth of Forth would likely have lived in villages without fortifications in houses of timber or stone, while those living nearer to the Western coast would have more likely been using a form of dry stone. According to Malcolm Todd, &quot;...&#x27;substantial houses&#x27; of the North may be over-represented in the archaeological record, by reason of their ability to more successfully survive as recognisable structures.&quot;

The hillforts that stretched from the North York Moors to the Scottish Highlands are evidence of a distinctive character emerging in northern Great Britain from the Middle Iron Age onwards. They were much smaller than the hillforts further south, often less than 10,000 square metres in area (one hectare, about 2.47 acres), and there is no evidence that they were extensively occupied or defended by the Caledonians, who appear to generally have had a dispersed settlement pattern.

By the time of the Roman invasion there had been a move towards less heavily fortified but better sheltered farmsteads surrounded by earthwork enclosures. Individual family groups likely inhabited these new fortified farmsteads, linked together with their neighbours through intermarriage.

The reason for this change from hilltop fortresses to farms amongst the Caledonians and their neighbours is unknown. Barry Cunliffe considers that the importance of demonstrating an impressive residence became less significant by the second century because of falling competition for resources due to advances in food production or a population decline. Alternatively, finds of Roman material may mean that social display became more of a matter of personal adornment with imported exotica rather than building an impressive dwelling.

Anne Robertson suggests that the Roman objects and materials (including relative finery and currency) found within many Caledonian structures indicates a trade network between the two cultures from as early as the first century AD, continuing until at least the fourth century AD.

<text>Thermotaxis is a behavior in which an organism directs its locomotion up or down a gradient of temperature.

Lab research has determined that some slime molds and small nematodes (namely Meloidogyne incognita) can migrate along amazingly shallow temperature gradients of less than 0.1°C/cm and sometimes as low as 0.001°C/cm. Theoretical analysis indicates that even this impressive feat is far from pushing the limits set by thermal noise. The natural environment always contains temperature gradients that organisms could respond to, if it were useful. The response of the slime mold and nematode is complicated and thought to allow them to move toward an appropriate level in soil. Recent research suggests that mammalian sperm employ thermotaxis to move to an appropriate location in the female&#x27;s oviduct (see Sperm guidance).

<text>Promotional Copy is the second studio album by American rock band Reggie and the Full Effect.

==History==
Promotional Copy was recorded and released in 2000. Produced by Ed Rose, it was the follow-up to the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Greatest Hits 1984-1987&quot;. Due to the misleading nature of the title, several retailers including Best Buy and Sam Goody sent back entire shipments of the album, because they believed that they were actually sent promotional copies of the album rather than the album itself.

<text>Super Street Fighter II Turbo, released in Japan as is a 1994 fighting game developed and published by Capcom for arcades. It is the fifth installment in the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; sub-series of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; games, following &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; (1993). Like its predecessor, it ran on the CP System II hardware.

&quot;Super Turbo&quot; introduced several new gameplay mechanics not present in previous versions of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, including the addition of combination moves called super combos and air combos. It also introduced the secret character Akuma, who would go on to become a recurring character in later &quot;Street Fighter&quot; installments and other Capcom fighting games. While not as commercially successful as previous iterations of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Super Turbo&quot; was well-received by critics and had a major impact on the competitive fighting game community. &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; is still played competitively, and is the oldest fighting game with an active international tournament scene.

The game was ported to 3DO that same year followed by home computer ports for DOS and the Amiga. In 1997 it was ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn as part of the &quot;Street Fighter Collection&quot;, and in 2000 to the Dreamcast in Japan under the title of &quot;Super Street Fighter II X for Matching Service&quot;. A Game Boy Advance version was also made. A remake of &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; was released in 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 titled &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix&quot;.

==Characters==

&quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; allows players to play as versions of characters from the original &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; in addition to their regular counterparts in the game by inputting a code for each character. The character would play as they would in &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;, with subtle differences. For example, the alternate version of Sagat in &quot;Super Turbo&quot; can now cancel his light kick into any special move, whereas in &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; he couldn&#x27;t.

&quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; also saw the introduction of the series&#x27; first secret character, Akuma (Gouki in Japan). Akuma is playable only as a secret character. He can be used by inputting a code at the player select screen. Even in this weakened form, he is the most powerful character in the game, and has historically been banned in all competitive tournaments of the game, including updated versions of &quot;Super Turbo&quot;.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; featured several changes and additions to the play mechanics inherited from &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;. The HUD featured new graphics. &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;&#x27;s opening sequence and unused sequence featuring lead character Ryu launching a &quot;Hadouken&quot; projectile towards the screen (which had replaced two generic characters fighting in front of a crowd) was intercut with images of Chun-Li and Cammy, as well as flashes of the new hidden character Akuma. New animation frames were drawn for all the victory poses and the basic and special moves of the characters. For example, Chun-Li received a new animation for her &quot;Kikōken&quot; (fireball) projectile.
A large criticism of &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; was the slower game speed in comparison to the previous release, &quot;Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting.&quot; &quot;Super Turbo&quot; was the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game released in arcades to feature an adjustable speed setting. The game speed can be adjusted through the system configuration by the game″s operator or (if the speed setting is set to &quot;Free Select&quot;) can be chosen by the player at the start of the game. The player has a choice between four speed settings.

&quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; introduced &quot;Super Combos&quot;. After building up the &quot;Super&quot; meter, players can execute a multi-hit automatic combo which deals a large amount of damage.

==Home versions==
===Direct ports===

====3DO Interactive Multiplayer====

The 3DO port was released on November 13, 1994 in Japan, with subsequent releases in North America and Europe during the same year. While the graphics are more accurately reproduced compared to the previous console ports for 16-bit platforms, the game doesn&#x27;t support parallax scrolling and is missing animations on characters. Also, the Super versions of characters are not present.

While often claimed to suffer from poor, stuttery performance, due to CDs of the time often having such issues, modern testing disputes these claims, and verifiable reports from the time are rare, if any exist at all.

The soundtrack features the same remixed music from the FM Towns version of &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; (with a few additional remixes specific to &quot;Super Turbo&quot;). This port also features &quot;CPS1 Chains&quot;, a feature that only existed in the arcade versions up until &quot;Hyper Fighting&quot;.

====MS-DOS and Amiga====
The MS-DOS version, developed by Eurocom and published by GameTek, was released in May 1995 in North America and Europe. There are secret commands to use each character&#x27;s original color scheme or attacks that were removed from the 3DO version due to memory constraints. The option menus have custom settings (such as enabling and disabling parallax scrolling) that allows the game to be played with low hardware specifications. The biggest change is the game&#x27;s resolution; the game is played with a resolution of 320×200 on AT/PC-compatible machines and, since the graphic data is ported straight from the arcade version, all of the characters appear large due to the narrow screen size. Because of this, the distance between both fighters at the beginning of a match is slightly narrower than in the arcade version. There were many glitches in the initial shipments of the DOS port, such as characters landing and recovering normally after being knocked out with a basic attack in mid-air. A patch file was distributed that corrected these glitches, which were later fixed in version 1.5 of the retail release. A patch file for version 1.6 was released as well. The music was remixed, although the arrangements are different from the ones used in the 3DO soundtrack.

The Amiga port was also released by Gametek (and ported by Human Soft) in 1996, which is graphically very close to the original arcade version and features a remixed soundtrack, but suffers from jerky animation and other shortcomings when played on an unexpanded machine.

====PlayStation and Sega Saturn====
&quot;Super Turbo&quot; is included in the &quot;Street Fighter Collection&quot; compilation for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, which also includes &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; on the same disc, as well as &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold&quot; on a second disc. There is a small delay at the beginning of every match, and there are numerous small differences from the arcade version.

====Dreamcast====
Capcom released &quot;Super Street Fighter II X for Matching Service&quot; for the Dreamcast in Japan exclusively as a mail-order release via the online Dreamcast Direct store (later known as &quot;Sega Direct&quot;) on December 22, 2000. The Dreamcast version features an online versus mode on Sega&#x27;s &quot;Matching Service&quot; compatible only on analog modems. (The Matching Service closed on September 1, 2003.) The bonus mini-games from previous versions of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, which had been cut from the arcade, were restored in this version and can be enabled via a special options menu making it more arcade-accurate. Other secret options are available as well. The Dreamcast version is considerably more accurate than the PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions, as almost nothing was changed aside from the score display. It features additional speed settings including faster speeds (speeds 4–6) and a very slow speed (speed 0) that doesn&#x27;t remove any frames.

====Capcom Classics Collection====
&quot;Super Turbo&quot; is included in &quot;Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Although the first compilation included the first three &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; games, the second volume skipped the original &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; and only included &quot;Super Turbo&quot;. This version has many glitches.

====30th Anniversary Collection====
&quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; is included in &quot;Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection&quot;. The existing updates of this title are not included in the collection as &quot;Hyper Street Fighter II&quot; is exclusive to arcade, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, while &quot;Ultra Street Fighter II&quot; is exclusive to Switch. In this release, save states are featured in the source code, while other features can be toggled on and off. Regarding online functionality, this title (along with &quot;Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike&quot;) has availability for multiplayer matches.

The arcade version was also ported in the compilation &quot;Capcom Arcade Stadium&quot; as an individual purchase option in the software. This edition allows for selection of either US and Japan editions of the game.

===Rearranged Versions===

====&quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival&quot;====
Released on July 13, 2001 in Japan, with subsequent releases in North America and Europe by Capcom, &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival&quot; is a port of &quot;Super Turbo&quot; for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) with new character illustrations and title screen. It was re-released as a Virtual Console game for the Wii U in 2015. The GBA only has four buttons used for attacks, though the four action buttons can be easily customized. Although most of the basic character sprites and animations were transferred from the SNES version of the original &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;, the new techniques that were added from &quot;Super Turbo&quot; used the same sprites and animations as the arcade version. This results in a few characters suddenly growing in size for a moment when performing certain moves, such as Guile&#x27;s standing heavy kick, since the arcade version used bigger sprites than the SNES version. Likewise, the animation frames when a character advances towards an opponent are the same when he or she retreats. Only Akuma uses character sprites exclusively from the arcade version and his advancing and retreating animations are different as a result.

Several stages have been changed: Ken&#x27;s, Guile&#x27;s and M. Bison&#x27;s stages are completely new, Zangief&#x27;s and Balrog&#x27;s have been heavily modified, Ryu&#x27;s is taken from &quot;Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike&quot; and Chun-Li&#x27;s from &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;. Akuma now has his own stage, which is an altered version of Ryu&#x27;s. All the voice clips of the characters are taken from the arcade version with the exception of Ryu&#x27;s, which is based on the original &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, while Akuma&#x27;s voice clips are from the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; series. While the music quality is not of the same rate as the arcade version, the danger versions of the stage themes are included just like the arcade version&#x27;s and there are exclusive remixes as well.

Akuma can use the &quot;Shun Goku Satsu&quot; as a Super Combo, unlike in the arcade version (where he had none). The player can also unlock Shin Akuma, a variation of Akuma who boasts even greater fighting skills, in addition to the regular version. He can also use the &quot;Shun Goku Satsu&quot; Super Combo.

&quot;Turbo Revival&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Fighting Game&quot; award among console games, losing to &quot;&quot;.

====&quot;Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition&quot;====
In 2003, Capcom released this version of the game that allowed players to select every previous iteration of the main cast over the course of the five different main SF2 titles (World Warrior, Champion Edition, Hyper Fighting, Super, Super Turbo), provided that character was selectable in that game. This version was released on CPS-2 arcade, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

====&quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix&quot;====

In 2008, Capcom published &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix&quot;, an HD port of the game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 available as a downloadable title. It was developed by Backbone Entertainment. It features a 1080p resolution with graphics by artists from Udon (authors of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; comic book series), an arranged soundtrack provided by Overclocked Remix, and adjustments to the game&#x27;s balance by David Sirlin with input from the competitive community. This version was based on the source code from &quot;Super Street Fighter II X for Matching Service&quot; for Dreamcast. The game allows you to select between normal and &quot;classic&quot; mode, which uses classic sprites and doesn&#x27;t use the balance changes. It was played at EVO Championship Series in 2009 and 2010.

====&quot;Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers&quot;====
In 2017, Capcom announced they would be making &quot;Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers&quot; for the Nintendo Switch. This version adds Evil Ryu (previously introduced in the &quot;Alpha&quot; series) and Violent Ken (introduced in &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot;), and allows players to select Akuma on the character select screen. Also, Shin Akuma is now a playable character; he can be selected by performing a series of specific button inputs on the character select screen, and is only usable offline.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; on their April 15, 1994 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the month, just below &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; while outperforming titles like &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; and &quot;Karnov&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. It went on to become Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade game of 1994, and sixth highest of 1995. In the United States, &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; was the top-earning arcade printed circuit board (PCB) in May 1994. It was one of America&#x27;s top twelve best-selling arcade video games of 1994.

In the January 30, 1995 issue of Japanese magazine &quot;Gamest&quot;, &quot;Super Street Fighter II X&quot; (known as &quot;Super Turbo&quot; internationally) placed fourth place in the award for Best Game of 1994 and Best Fighting Game. Upon release on home consoles, &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; scored the 3DO version of the game a 29 out of 40.

The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the 3DO version a unanimous score of 8/10, commenting that the graphics and content accurately recreate the arcade version, and that the control is &quot;near perfect&quot; even when using the standard 3DO pad. In contrast, &quot;GamePro&quot; stated that the control is imperfect even with Panasonic&#x27;s six-button controller, and is terrible with the standard pad due to the &quot;mushy&quot; D-pad. They also criticized the absence of the older versions of the fighters and concluded that the port, though &quot;a reasonably close translation of the coin-op&quot;, falls second to the SNES version of &quot;Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting&quot; among &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; conversions. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; concurred with &quot;GamePro&quot; that the 3DO controllers are not optimal for the game, but still held it to be &quot;without a doubt, the best version [of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;] to hit home systems.&quot; He described the conversion as &quot;colorful, fast, and so impressive you hardly notice the disk access time between rounds.&quot; Arcade Sushi ranked &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; as the &quot;best fighting game&quot;, adding that it &quot;is easily the most loved, and the most played game in the franchise. If you haven&#x27;t played this fighter, then you haven&#x27;t played fighting games at all.&quot; Future Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Future Games&quot; gave the 3DO version a 95% score, hailing it as the &quot;game that&#x27;ll save the 3DO&quot;. They praised it as the &quot;ultimate beat &#x27;em up&quot; while their only criticism was the &quot;Slow CD access&quot; times. In 2019, &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked it as the 3rd best fighting game of all time.

==Competitive play==
&quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; has been a staple in the competitive fighting game scene for its entire existence in one form or another. It was a featured game at the Evolution Championship Series (EVO) from 2002 to 2008. Its remixed version, &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo: HD Remix&quot;, was played in 2009 and 2010. It has returned to EVO as a featured side event as the invite/qualifier limited &quot;Tournament of Legends&quot; in 2012 and 2014 and the &quot;ST Games&quot; in 2013. The game is also a staple at the Japanese X-MANIA series of tournaments and has featured in the Tougeki Super Battle Opera series of tournaments multiple times.

<text>Heinrich August Marschner (16 August 1795 – 14 December 1861) was a German composer best known for his operas. He is considered to be the most important composer of German opera between Weber and Wagner.

==Biography==
Marschner was born in Zittau, in southeastern Saxony, and was originally intended for a legal career. After a meeting with Beethoven around 1815–16, he decided to devote himself to music and became a private music teacher in Bratislava. From 1821 he worked as a stage composer and conductor at the municipal theatres in Dresden (from 1821), Leipzig (from 1827), and the Court Theatre at Hanover (from 1830), where the opera &quot;Hans Heiling&quot; (1833) established his name among the leading German opera composers of the time. He died in Hanover.

==Legacy==
Marschner was widely regarded as one of the most important composers in Europe from about 1830 until the end of the 19th century. He was a rival of Weber and friend of Beethoven and Mendelssohn. His operas often contain thematic material based on folksong, and this folk-influenced genre had begun with Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; (1821). The last of his operas, &quot;Austin&quot;, was first staged in 1852. It was not very well received, and later the increasingly renowned Wagner overshadowed him.

Robert Schumann praised Marschner&#x27;s piano trios lavishly. Marschner did not just toss off these works as an afterthought, but clearly devoted considerable time and effort to writing them. He gave the title &quot;Grand Trio&quot; to each of his works for piano, violin and cello, indicative of the importance he attached to them. In these pieces, one finds all of the emotions prevalent in the Romantic movement during the mid-19th century.

To the extent that Marschner is still remembered, it is largely for his operas &quot;Hans Heiling&quot; (1833), &quot;Der Vampyr&quot; (1828) and &quot;Der Templer und die Jüdin&quot; (1829), extremely popular in his lifetime. Marschner&#x27;s ability to depict supernatural horror by musical means is especially evident in the first two operas as well as in some of his ballads, such as &quot; (c. 1839).

Next to his operas, Marschner&#x27;s most significant musical contribution is to the Lied. The best of his works in this form are comparable with those by Carl Loewe. He also wrote a considerable amount of chamber music, including seven piano trios, as well as unaccompanied male choruses that were very popular in the nineteenth century. While Marschner&#x27;s operas strongly influenced Wagner, his chamber music, songs, and his cantata &quot; (1842) were admired by Schumann, whose cantata &quot;Paradise and the Peri&quot; (1843) shows the older composer&#x27;s influence. Marschner&#x27;s Bagatelles for guitar (1814) have been taken up lately by some guitarists, and some of his chamber music is still very occasionally played. Among his operas, &quot;Hans Heiling&quot; and especially &quot;Der Vampyr&quot; have been adapted and revived in recent years with considerable success.

<doc id="899747" wikidata="Q7883409" url="?curid=899747" title="Under the Tray">
<text>Under the Tray..., also known as Inside the Dust Sleeve... is the third studio album by American rock band Reggie and the Full Effect.

==Background==
&quot;Under the Tray&quot; was written and recorded in the years following the band&#x27;s previous release &quot;Promotional Copy&quot;, mostly while James Dewees was on tour with The Get Up Kids. The album was released on Vagrant Records in February 2003. The album sold rather well, reaching  15 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and No. 8 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. The song &quot;Congratulations Smack and Katy&quot; was featured in the video game &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot;.

==Packaging==
&quot;Under the Tray&quot; is named as such because the packaging contained an opaque black tray made to hold a CD. However, the discs were packed underneath the tray, giving the appearance upon opening that there was no disc in the package, prompting numerous complaints with retailers carrying the album. Later pressings included an illustration showing where the CD is.

The vinyl pressing of this album is titled &quot;Inside the Dust Sleeve...&quot;

==Track listing==
==Personnel==
*James Dewees – vocals, keyboard, drums
*Matt Pryor – guitar, backup vocals
*Rob Pope – bass guitar
*Ed Rose – production, mixing

==Additional Personnel==
* Andy Jackson – vocals on &quot;Happy V-Day&quot;

<doc id="899753" wikidata="Q7366633" url="?curid=899753" title="Roots Canada">
<text>Roots Corporation (doing business as Roots) is a publicly held Canadian brand that sells apparel, leather bags, small leather goods, footwear, athletic wear, and home furnishings. The company was founded in 1973 in Toronto, Ontario, by Michael Budman and Don Green. In 2015, Roots was sold to Searchlight Capital Partners LP, an American investment firm.

The company&#x27;s design centre and leather factory are in Toronto, Ontario. Roots reportedly has approximately 2,000 employees in Canada. Roots factories exist globally, however, details of these factories are not disclosed by the parent company.

Roots started using the beaver logo in 1985 with the launch of their athletic brand. The logo was designed in the 1970s by graphic artists Heather Cooper and Robert Burns. The logo features a beaver, the national animal of Canada, on top of tree branches. The typography of the company name below is set in the Cooper font created by Oswald Cooper in 1919.

==History==

In 1973, Michael Budman and Don Green founded Roots, initially a footwear company that sold negative-heel shoes, before expanding their products. The Kowalewski family and their family business, the Boa Shoe Company, were the first makers of Budman and Green&#x27;s negative-heel shoes, which became Roots&#x27; defining product. In August 1973, Roots opened its first store on Yonge St. near the Rosedale subway station in Toronto. A couple of months later, Roots bought the Upin and Ipin Company and opened their own leather factory. By the end of 1973, Roots had stores in Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, and several U.S. locations.

Roots&#x27; negative-heel shoes &quot;competed&quot; with similar shoes sold by Kalsø Earth Shoe, which had first entered the North American market in 1970. Experts express varying opinions on whether negative-heel shoes are good or bad for one&#x27;s feet.

==Expansion==
As the demand for Roots&#x27; negative-heel shoes continued, the Roots factory expanded. By the fall of 1975, the factory that had made only 30 pairs of shoes a day was making more than 2,000. Later that year, Roots decided to experiment with casual apparel.

By 1977, Roots had expanded to 65 retail outlets across North America and Europe and 250 employees. Roots then began the transition from making negative-heel shoes to making footwear with a wedge sole, and introduced classic handbags to their lineup. The company began wholesaling bags, footwear, belts, and leather jackets to Canadian retailers like Eaton’s and Holt Renfrew, and U.S. retailers such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, and Nordstrom. Roots continued to expand its product line by introducing Roots Design in 1979, their first line of men&#x27;s tailored clothing. This line started with leather jackets that were produced in a small building in Port Credit, Mississauga.

By the end of 1980, with the closing of many stores in the U.S. and Europe, Roots began to expand in Canada. The expansion launched the manufacturing of T-shirts and sweatshirts on a small scale, and the creation of the brand&#x27;s label Beaver Canoe, a joint venture canoe building operation with Camp Tamakwa&#x27;s co-founder Omer Stringer. Clothing and outdoor items were then created under the Beaver Canoe brand in 1983. Two years later, Roots launched Roots Beaver Athletics (RBA) with the beaver logo and by the early 1990s, the logo had appeared on more than a million garments.

Roots began to expand in Asia in 1993, starting with two stores in Japan, where negative heel shoes had a resurgent popularity and continued to expand throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Although Roots stores have closed in Asia, Roots began to expand in Taiwan and China in the 2000s. Over the years, these stores expanded their product offering to include apparel as well as leather goods, kids apparel, and home furnishings. Roots Taiwan launched a separate website in 2011. As of May 2013, Roots had 75 retail outlets in Taiwan and 16 in China, but with plans for full closure.

In 2001, the company was involved with the creation of a new Canadian discount airline, Roots Air, which operated Airbus A320 and Boeing 727-200 jetliners in scheduled passenger service. However, the airline shut down in the same year.

==Olympics==
Roots contributed to the Olympic games in 1976, providing 200 quilted “Puff” boots to the Canadian Team at the Winter Games in Innsbruck, Austria. In 1988, Roots provided Jamaica&#x27;s Olympic bobsled team with custom made jackets. The story was made famous by the 1993 hit movie Cool Runnings starring John Candy, who wore a Roots jacket. Roots created a special retail collection of clothes in honour of the 1994 Canadian Olympic team, under the banner &quot;Roots Salutes the Canadian Olympic Team.&quot; Roots designed a jacket for the Norwegian skier and Olympic Gold medalist Stein Eriksen for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.

In 1998, Roots began its formal Olympic involvement, outfitting the Canadian team at the Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. The outfit&#x27;s most popular item was the red “poorboy” cap (or poor boy cap) worn backwards, which were seen on celebrities such as Prince William and P. Diddy. Roots at one point sold 100,000 of these berets a day at US$19.95 apiece, eventually selling over half a million caps.

Roots went on to be the official outfitter for members of the Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Teams from 2000 to 2004, and was the official outfitter for the Canadian Speed Skating Team in 2006. Roots outfitted the United States Olympic and Paralympic Teams in 2002, 2004, and 2006. Other teams Roots outfitted include the British Olympic Team (2002, 2004), and the Barbados Olympic Team (2004).

In 2005, Roots was outbid on the Canadian Olympic contract by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (sold through The Bay and Zellers), and in 2008 the USOC replaced Roots with Polo Ralph Lauren. The USOC had a disagreement with Roots over the direction of the athletes&#x27; uniforms, but it is also suggested Roots did not want its brand to be involved with the 2008 Summer Olympics, which saw much political controversy over human rights.

==Today==

Roots has 120 stores in North America, including five flagship stores in Canada in Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal. Other notable locations include Rosedale in Toronto, and Chinook and West Edmonton Mall in Alberta. In 2013, Roots opened locations in Montreal and Niagara Falls. In 2014, the large two-story Bloor St. location, which was known for holding many events, downsized to a new location on the same street.

Also in 2014, after years of running the business, Michael Budman and Don Green hired a president and chief operating officer, Wendy Bennison, who was previously vice president of Mark&#x27;s Work Warehouse.

In 2015, Roots was sold to Searchlight Capital LP, which now holds a majority stake with the founders retaining a minority stake.

Jim Gabel joined in February 2016 as the president of Roots Canada. He left the company in January 2020. In May 2020, the board of directors appointed Meghan Roach as chief executive officer.

In September 2017, the company filed for an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

On April 29, 2020, Roots Corp. announced the shutdown of its stores in Boston, Washington, and Chicago, and a pop-up store in New York. Two stores in Michigan and Utah will remain open. Its subsidiary Roots USA Corp. will be liquidated through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. Sales to U.S. customers will continue through e-commerce.

<doc id="899767" wikidata="Q6962276" url="?curid=899767" title="Piano Sonata No. 10 (Scriabin)">
<text>The [[Piano sonata|Piano Sonata]] No. 10, Op. 70, was written by Alexander Scriabin in 1913. It was his final work in this form. The piece is highly chromatic and tonally ambiguous like Scriabin&#x27;s other late works, although arguably less dissonant than most of his late works. It is characterized by frequent trills and tremolos. It is sometimes called his &quot;Insect Sonata&quot;, in reference to the following statement he made that was recorded by Leonid Sabaneev:

&quot;Insects, butterflies, moths - they are all living flowers. They are the most subtle caresses, almost without touching...They are all born of the sun and the sun nourishes them...This sunlike caress is the closest to me - take my tenth sonata - it is an entire sonata from insects.&quot;

This statement originates in a conversation in which Scriabin, his common-law-wife Tatiana Scriabina, and Sabaneev discuss the ways that various animals &quot;correspond to the movements of our souls.&quot; They are particularly interested in the types of caresses that different animals resemble - &quot;birds correspond to elated caresses,&quot; while &quot;harrowing caresses - these are beasts&quot; - and the above quotation is prompted by Sabaneev somewhat jokingly asking Scriabin &quot;and what about other living creatures, like worms, insects?.&quot; While many have taken the insect quote to refer to a literalistic resemblance between the sonata&#x27;s trills and the buzzing of insect wings, the musicologist Ross Mitchell has argued that Scriabin intended a more nuanced and philosophical metaphor. 

&quot;The insects that Skryabin had in mind while writing this sonata are not simply buzzing busybodies, but sun-kissed and sparkling with a dazzling gleam and an erotic delicacy as they caress with their gentle wingbeats. These insects combine many of Skryabin’s favored philosophical, symbolic, and metaphorical strains – ceaseless activity, fluttering, illumination, seduction – into one potent symbol for enabling spiritual enlightenment.&quot;

The atmosphere of the introductory pages of the Tenth Sonata is veiled and distant, like an impressionist reflection, but much more intensely elevated and spiritual. Trills soon sweep into every corner of the music, and in the last pages they are transformed into a glorious reverberation, as if shimmering with pulses of glowing light and taking on lives of their own. Such life and light/sound corroborations are typical of the composer&#x27;s own imaginative world.

The tenth sonata is in closer dialogue with Sonata Form than some of his other sonatas. It opens with a few desolate notes, forming an augmented chord and then a diminished chord. Then, it moves on to a simple chromatic theme, and then back to the opening theme. Scriabin then introduces the luminous trills that pervade the rest of the piece, and then moves on to a third theme with a chromatically descending melody. Following the sonata format, these three themes take on a modified form in the development before settling down to the recapitulation.

During the middle portion, the feverish buzzing rises to a ferocious climax that thrusts both hands&#x27; trills into the upper register of the instrument. The very first, single-line gesture of the piece is not given again until after the richly-varied &quot;recapitulation&quot; has been made; it arrives quite unexpectedly, and is punctuated by a falling fourth in the bass that ends on C natural—a pitch that, in his last music, assumes great significance for Scriabin, who came to view it as a kind of cleansing tonal focus.

Like Scriabin&#x27;s other sonatas, it is both technically and musically highly demanding for the pianist. A typical performance is about 12 minutes. Notable recorded performances of this piece include that of Scriabin’s son-in-law and musical champion, Vladimir Sofronitzky, and that of the great pianist Vladimir Horowitz, who also championed many of Scriabin’s works throughout his long career. The Russian virtuoso Arcadi Volodos took the very unusual step of opening his Carnegie Hall debut concert with this Sonata, reflecting a daring approach to programming as well as a commitment to Scriabin’s legacy. In 2018, Yuja Wang performed the Sonata in a recital tour, including Carnegie Hall and Berliner Philharmonie. The Berlin recital was recorded and released by Deutsche Grammophon as &quot;The Berlin Recital&quot;; the album received a Grammy Award nomination for &quot;Best Classical Instrumental Solo&quot;.

<text>The Oregon Coast Aquarium is an aquarium in Newport in the U.S. state of Oregon. Opened in 1992, the facility sits on along Yaquina Bay near the Pacific Ocean. The aquarium was home to Keiko, the orca who starred in the movie &quot;Free Willy&quot;, from January 7, 1996, until September 9, 1998, when he was shipped to Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland. &quot;USA Today&quot; considers the Oregon Coast Aquarium world-class and &quot;Coastal Living&quot; magazine ranks it among the top ten aquariums in North America.

==History==
Newport business leaders proposed building an aquarium beginning in the early 1980s. They proposed a $7 million facility in 1982 as a way to boost the local economy. Two years later they incorporated as a non-profit, and increased fundraising efforts in 1987, collecting $11 million by 1991. Plans to turn along Yaquina Bay in Newport into a &quot;world class&quot; aquarium were finalized in 1990. The Aquarium was designed by SRG Architects, Portland: BIOS:Inc, of Seattle, and Walker/Macy Landscape Architects, Portland, Oregon.

After early bids were rejected by the aquarium&#x27;s board of directors, Mountain States Construction was selected to build the first phase for about $12 million in August 1990. Plans for the first phase included construction of a building and four acres of outdoor exhibits, with completion expected in spring 1992. Construction began in August 1990 on phase one, with two other phases expected to start three years and eight years later.

On May 23, 1992, the Oregon Coast Aquarium opened with about 5,500 visitors the first day. Those in attendance on the first day included Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Governor Barbara Roberts, and Congressmen Mike Kopetski and Les AuCoin. The opening theme of the aquarium was following the path of a raindrop from the Oregon Coast Range all the way to the Pacific Ocean.

On January 7, 1996, Keiko the orca whale arrived on a United Parcel Service C-130 cargo plane, with freight expenses donated by the company. This move from Reino Aventura, an amusement park in Mexico City, came after fund raising by environmentalists and school children to build a $7.8 million habitat for the movie star in Oregon. Keiko was moved to Iceland in 1998 in an attempt to return him to the wild. For 2012, the aquarium had 450,000 visitors and earned $850,000 on about $7.3 million in revenues.

==Exhibits==
The Oregon Coast Aquarium&#x27;s collection focuses on the flora and fauna native to the Oregon Coast. The aquarium is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

===Main building===

Exhibits in the main building include four permanent displays: Sandy Shores, Rocky Shores, Coastal Waters, and a changing exhibit area. The first features fish and invertebrates that live either close to shore or in bays such as Yaquina Bay. Progressing, the aquarium displays feature animals further offshore ending in a kelp forest and sea jelly exhibit. Flanking the permanent displays are the changing exhibits.

There are also exhibits focusing on small marine life in the area including jellyfish, and a tidepool exhibit in which visitors may touch sea stars and sea anemones.

Temporary exhibits have included &quot;Turtles,&quot; &quot;Swampland,&quot; &quot;Claws&quot; that featured crustaceans, and &quot;Oddwater&quot;, which featured unusual sea creatures such as the green-blooded cuttlefish and the jet-powered chambered nautilus.

===Passages of the Deep===

The largest exhibit is &quot;Passages of the Deep&quot;, in Keiko&#x27;s former tank, it features walk-through acrylic tubes surrounded by deep water marine animals such as sharks, rays, and rockfish.

The exhibit has three sections. Orford Reef contains mostly rockfish and other smaller Pacific-Northwest fish. Halibut Flats contains halibut, ling cod, a small ray, and other large fish, and includes a mock sunken ship. Open Sea is the last section in the tunnel, and holds many species of sharks including seven gill sharks, as well as rays, mackerel, anchovies and salmon.

===Seabird Aviary===
The aviary at Oregon Coast Aquarium exhibits sea and shore birds. Those on display include the seabirds tufted puffin, common murre, rhinoceros auklet, pigeon guillemot, and the shore bird black oystercatcher. The seabird aviary includes two large pools and rocky cliffs.

===Nature Play Area===

The aquarium&#x27;s nature play area offers an interactive exhibit for kids which features models of logs (in reference to the area&#x27;s history in timber), a replica eagle&#x27;s nest, and a slide designed to look like a river chute.

===Outdoor Amphitheater===

The outdoor amphitheater was built as part of the same renovation project that brought the nature play area and the headwaters feature. It is an outdoor presentation space that hosts educational presentations from experts and animal demonstrations from caretakers.

===Outdoor exhibits===

The Aquarium has the largest outdoor Seabird Aviary in North America, which is home to tufted and horned puffins, black oystercatchers, common murres, rhinoceros auklets and pigeon guillemots. The Aquarium also exhibits two turkey vultures in a separate outdoor area. Outdoor exhibits also showcase marine mammal species native to the Oregon Coast, including sea otters, harbor seals, and sea lions. There is even a coastal cave that houses a giant Pacific octopus. The rocks in the outdoor exhibit are artificial rocks constructed of gunite. The Aquarium is also home to a nature trail that overlooks the Yaquina Bay estuary and features native plants and free-roaming wildlife.

<text>Lakers versus Celtics and the NBA Playoffs is a basketball video game developed and released by Electronic Arts. It was first released in 1989 for MS-DOS-compatible PCs and for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991. The game was highly successful; it was the first game endorsed by the NBA and was the first to contain multiple NBA stars and teams in one game. The game&#x27;s title alludes to the 1980s rivalry between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers.
It is the first game in the NBA Playoffs series of games.

The game would be the first team basketball video game to acquire full players names and rights without actually relying on the NBA Players Association. Established stars in the game include Larry Bird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (DOS version only), Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and Patrick Ewing.

The game introduced innovations in presentation. It was the first NBA game to feature TV style starting line up prior to the opening tip. It also featured halftime shows and announcers to simulate an authentic feel. Later games would go further by replacing music during gameplay with audience cheers. The game was conceived by Producer Don Traeger, and principal work done by programmer Robert Weatherby and Art Director 
Michael Kosaka. It was the first game to feature the EASN logo, a stand-alone sports brand that Traeger had conceived with marketing partner Don Transeth and Artist Michael Kosaka. This brand later evolved into EA Sports.

==Gameplay==
The game can be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, &quot;Exhibition&quot; or &quot;Playoffs&quot;. There are also four difficulty levels: Pre-season, Regular season, Playoffs and Showtime. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters.

Signature moves for individual star players who have their own were introduced, such as Charles Barkley&#x27;s gorilla dunk.

===Teams===
Players can pick from one of eight teams who were among the 16 that had competed in the playoffs the year before the game was released. The MS-DOS version contained teams from the 1989 NBA Playoffs, while the Genesis version contained the playoff teams from the 1990 NBA Playoffs.

MS-DOS version:
Genesis version:
Both conferences&#x27; All-Star Teams were available as well. This was the only way to use players from teams that were not represented in the game - Hakeem Olajuwon, Dominique Wilkins, Chris Mullin and Reggie Miller being examples.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised &quot;Lakers versus Celtics&quot;″ graphics, but stated that it was too easy to play for action gamers and that scoring was too high for statistics-oriented players, and unfavorably noted the lack of league play or custom lineups. The game scored 88% in Computer and Video Games. &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at #24 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.

<doc id="899786" wikidata="Q189606" url="?curid=899786" title="Zenith Electronics">
<text>Zenith Electronics, LLC, is an American research and development company that develops ATSC and digital rights management technologies. It is owned by the South Korean company LG Electronics. Zenith was previously an American brand of consumer electronics, a manufacturer of radio and television receivers and other consumer electronics, and was headquartered in Glenview, Illinois. After a series of layoffs, the consolidated headquarters moved to Lincolnshire, Illinois. For many years, their famous slogan (borrowed from Crown Piano maker George Bent of Chicago, used through the 1890s) was &quot;The quality goes in before the name goes on&quot;. LG Electronics acquired a controlling share of Zenith in 1995; Zenith became a wholly owned subsidiary in 1999. Zenith was the inventor of subscription television and the modern remote control, and was the first to develop high-definition television (HDTV) in North America.

Zenith-branded products were sold in North America, Germany, Thailand (to 1983), Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, India, and Myanmar.

==History==


The company was co-founded by Ralph Matthews and Karl Hassel in Chicago, Illinois, as Chicago Radio Labs in 1918 as a small producer of amateur radio equipment. The name &quot;Zenith&quot; came from ZN&#x27;th, a contraction of its founders&#x27; ham radio call sign, 9ZN. They were joined in 1921 by Eugene F. McDonald, and Zenith Radio Company was incorporated in 1923. 

The fledgling company soon became known for its high-quality radios and electronic innovations. Zenith introduced the first portable radio in 1924, the first mass-produced AC radio in 1926, and push-button tuning in 1927. It added automobile radios in the 1930s with its &quot;Model 460&quot;, promoting the fact that it needed no separate generator or battery, selling at US$59.95. The first Zenith television set appeared in 1939, with its first commercial sets sold to the public in 1948. The company is credited with having invented such things as the wireless remote control and FM multiplex stereo. For many years Zenith used the slogan &quot;the quality goes in before the name goes on&quot;. This phrase was used by the Geo. P. Bent Piano Company of Chicago as early as 1906. 

Zenith established one of the first FM stations in the country in 1940 (Chicago&#x27;s WWZR, later called WEFM, named for Zenith executive Eugene F. McDonald), which was among the earliest FM multiplex stereo stations, first broadcasting in stereo in June 1961. The station was sold in the early 1970s and is now WUSN. 

Zenith pioneered the development of high-contrast and flat-face picture tubes, and the multichannel television sound (MTS) stereo system used on analog television broadcasts in the United States and Canada (as opposed to the BBC-developed NICAM digital stereo sound system for analog television broadcasts, used in many places around the world.) Zenith was one of the first companies to introduce a digital HDTV system implementation, parts of which were included in the ATSC standard, starting with the 1993 model Grand Alliance. They were one of the first American manufacturers to market a home VCR, selling a Sony-built Betamax video recorder starting in 1977.

By 1960 Zenith was with RCA among the two largest US television manufacturers, each with more than 20% of the market; 25 other companies had the rest of the market. The 1962 Illinois Manufacturers Directory (50th Anniversary edition) lists Zenith Radio Corporation as having 11,000 employees, of which at least 6,460 were employed in seven Chicago plants. The corporate office was in plant number 1, located at 6001 West Dickens Avenue (north of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific railroad tracks), where 2,500 workers made radio and television sets and Hi-Fi stereophonic phonographs. Plant number 2 was located at 1500 North Kostner Ave., where 2,100 employees made government electronics, radio and television components, transistors and hearing aids. Plant number 3 was located at 5801 West Dickens Ave. (also north of the Milwaukee Road tracks), where 300 employees made electronics and did servicing. Plant number 4 was located at 3501 West Potomac Ave., where 60 employees handled warehousing. Plant number 5, located at 6501 West Grand Ave., employed 500-600 workers and manufactured government Hi-Fi equipment.

A subsidiary of Zenith, the Rauland Corporation, located at 4245 North Knox Avenue, employed 850 workers who produced television picture tubes. In the mid &#x27;60&#x27;s, Rauland produced the RCA 21&quot; round color CRT; in 1965 it added a 21&quot; rectangular 21&quot; color CRT. In 1966, Rauland bought the Keebler cookie plant in Melrose Park, Illinois for production of color CRTs. Rauland&#x27;s Niles, Illinois, plant made flat-face radar picture tubes, night vision microchannel image tubes for the military, and many specialty tubes. The other Zenith subsidiary in Chicago was Central Electronics, Incorporated, located at 1247 West Belmont Ave., where 100 employees made amateur radio equipment and performed auditory training. Another Central Electronics plant was located at State Route 133 and Grandview in Paris, Illinois, where 500 employees made radio receivers, with the total Zenith work force in Illinois being thus at least 6,960.

In December 1970, National Union Electric (&quot;NUE&quot;) sued most of the Japanese television manufacturers for violation of the Anti-Dumping Act and a conspiracy they alleged violated American antitrust laws. During the pendency of that suit, Zenith Radio Corporation encountered increasing financial difficulty as their market share progressively went to Japanese companies. Zenith joined two other U.S. companies—Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Motorola, Inc.—as co-plaintiffs. The NUE suit was transferred to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the two suits were consolidated for pretrial proceedings and trial. The suit, styled &quot;In re Japanese Electric Products Antitrust Litigation&quot;, sought $900 million in damages. 

By the end of 1983, Zenith had spent millions of dollars in connection with the litigation. In 1981, the trial court entered summary judgment on the antitrust and antidumping claims and dismissed the lawsuits. Plaintiffs appealed, and the appellate court affirmed the summary judgment for Sears, Roebuck and Co., Motorola, Inc., and Sony. The case was appealed, and in March 1986 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of the defendants on Zenith&#x27;s antitrust claims. Zenith&#x27;s hopes to salvage a victory on the claims that the defendants violated the Antidumping Act of 1916 ended in April 1987, when the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Philadelphia that upheld the ruling of the trial court in favor of the Japanese.

In 1979, Zenith entered the computer market with the purchase of Heath Company from Schlumberger for $64.5 million, forming Zenith Data Systems (ZDS). The company changed its name to Zenith Electronics Corporation in 1984 to reflect its interests in computers and CATV, having left the radio business two years earlier.

By the late 1980s, ZDS&#x27;s profits were sustaining its parent, while from 1987 Zenith&#x27;s consumer business lost money. By 1988 the company was the last American television manufacturer, and reportedly decided to also exit the consumer market and sell its television business. To raise money for HDTV research efforts and reduce debt, Zenith instead sold ZDS to Groupe Bull in October 1989 for $635 million. By 1990, Zenith was in trouble and looking more attractive to a hostile takeover. To avoid this, Zenith sold a five-percent stake to the Korean company GoldStar (now LG Electronics) as part of a technology-sharing agreement. With their analog line aging (the last major update to the line had been the &quot;System³&quot; chassis in 1978)), and the adoption of HDTV in the United States decades away, Zenith&#x27;s prospects were poor.

In 1995 LG, increased its stake to 55 percent, enough to assume controlling interest. Zenith was too small to compete in the consumer electronics industry, which had become global in nature, and its high-quality products made it attractive for acquisition. Zenith filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1999, and in exchange for its debts, LG bought the remaining 45 percent of the company, converting about $200 million of debt owed to it by Zenith into common stock in the revamped company. The shares of existing stockholders were rendered worthless. 

During this period, some of Zenith&#x27;s products were being rebadged as OEM under the Admiral name. Certain products carried the Allegro brand, which had originated in the 1970s as a brand for Zenith speakers and other audio equipment. Their profitable Network Systems division, which produced set-top boxes for cable and satellite TV, was sold to Motorola in the summer of 2000 and became part of Motorola BCS (Broadband Communications Sector).

The Zenith headquarters building was occupied by Aon and subsequently demolished in 2018 to create room for nearby Abt Electronics to expand. 

LG produced the Zenith DTT-900 and Zenith DTT-901 ATSC digital television converter box. LG offered some Zenith-branded plasma, LCD, and direct-view televisions through selected retail outlets.

==Notable products==

===Shortwave radio===

Among Zenith&#x27;s early famous products were the &quot;Royal&quot; series of transistor radios and the &quot;Trans-Oceanic&quot; series of shortwave portable radios, which were produced from 1942 to 1981.

===Subscription television===
Zenith was the first company to experiment with subscription television, launching their Phonevision system with experimental Chicago station KS2XBS (originally broadcasting on Channel 2 before the Federal Communications Commission forced them to relinquish it to WBBM-TV). Their experiment involved a descrambler box mounted on the television set, and plugged into the telephone lead. When a preannounced broadcast was ready to begin, viewers would call an operator at Zenith who would send a signal with the telephone leads to unscramble the video.

While the Theatre Owners of America claimed the concept was unsuccessful, Zenith itself claimed the experiment was a success. As Phonevision broadcast films, it was seen as a potential competitor for traditional theatres. In spite of the fact that the three films initially available to the first 300 test households were more than two years old, about 18 percent of Phonevision viewers had seen them at the movies, and 92 percent of Phonevision households reported that they would prefer to see films at home.

===Remote controls===
Zenith is, perhaps, best known for the first practical wireless television remote control, the Space Command, developed in 1956.


The original television remote control was a wired version, released in 1950, that soon attracted complaints about an unsightly length of cable from the viewer&#x27;s chair to the television receiver. Eugene F. McDonald, Zenith President and founder, ordered his engineers to develop a wireless version, but the use of radio waves was soon discounted due to poor interference rejection inherent in 1950s radio receivers. The 1955 Flash-Matic remote system, invented by Eugene Polley, used a highly directional photo flash tube in the hand held unit that was aimed at sensitive photoreceivers in the four front corners of the television cabinet. However, bright sunlight falling on the television was found to activate the controls. These remote controls would activate a motor, causing the tuning dial on the television to switch by itself, and this could be used for mischief if someone else was attempting to tune the television.

Lead engineer Robert Adler then suggested that ultrasonic sound be used as a trigger mechanism. This was produced in the hand held unit by mechanically struck aluminum rods of carefully constructed dimensions—a receiver in the television responded to the different frequencies this action produced. Enough audible noise was produced by pressing the buttons that consumers began calling remote controls &quot;clickers&quot;. The miniaturization of electronics meant that, eventually, the sounds were produced in the remote unit electronically; however, the operating principle remained in use until the 1980s, when it was superseded by the infrared light system.

Zenith said that Space Command increased television sales by 40%. The company licensed the technology to RCA and others, and twice successfully sued Admiral for violating its patent. The photograph is of a Space Command 600, which was the remote control designed for use with their color television receivers. The Space Command 600 was introduced in 1965 and this particular design was in use until the end of the 1972 model year. The Space Command 600 remote control had an additional, distinctive feature—this remote control could also adjust color hues. By pressing the mute button on the remote, a relay would be activated at the television in which to transfer the VHF motor drive tuner circuit to the motorized hue control. This would allow the user to adjust the hue in increments by depressing the channel up or down buttons on the remote control, and restore the television to normal tuning operation when the mute button was pressed again (mute off).

===Space phone===
Some models of Zenith&#x27;s &quot;System 3&quot; line of televisions made from the late 1970s to the early 1990s had a feature called the Space Phone by Zenith. It was basically a hands-free speakerphone built into the television set. It used the set&#x27;s speaker and remote control, in addition to a built-in microphone. A Space Phone-enabled television would connect to a telephone jack (using a built-in phone cord), and making a call was performed by pressing a button on the remote to activate the Space Phone (which would mute and begin controlling the program audio going to the speaker). The telephone number is dialed using the numeric keys on the remote, which then displays the digits being dialed on-screen (using the on-screen display features of the System 3 line). The user could then converse with another caller hands-free, much like a regular speakerphone.

===The porthole television===
In the late 1940s, Zenith entered the television market. These sets were all-round tube sets. The main feature was that the entire round screen was exposed. They were available in 12-inch, 16-inch and 19-inch sizes. Later round-tube models had a switch that would show the picture in the 4:3 ratio, or have the entire round screen exposed. These sets are very desirable among television collectors. Many porthole sets used metal-cone CRTs, which are now scarce. It is not uncommon for collectors to replace a bad metal-cone tube with an all-glass tube. Zenith porthole sets came in tabletop models, stand-alone consoles and television/radio/phono combos.

===Hand-wired chassis===
In the late 1950s, many electronic manufacturers, such as RCA, General Electric and Admiral, were changing from hand-wired metal chassis in their radios and televisions to printed circuit boards. While circuit boards save time and errors in assembly, they are not well suited for use with vacuum tube equipment, in which high temperatures are generated that can break down boards, eventually causing the boards to crumble if one attempts to remove a tube. Zenith, and to a lesser extent Motorola, avoided this problem by continuing to use hand wired chassis in all their vacuum tube equipment. Zenith kept circuit boards out of their televisions until the Chromacolor line of the early 1970s, and even then used them only with solid state components, mounting the four tubes used in the Chromacolor &quot;4 tube hybrid&quot; on the steel chassis. Zenith began using circuit boards in radios when they converted to solid-state in the late 1960s, but even Zenith&#x27;s early transistor radios were completely hand wired with socketed transistors. Due to the use of this chassis construction (and the high quality components), Zenith televisions and radios of the 1950s to 1970s found today are often still working well, needing little work to restore them to like-new operating condition.

<text>The Maeatae were a confederation of tribes that probably lived beyond the Antonine Wall in Roman Britain.

The historical sources are vague as to the exact region they inhabited, but an association is thought to be indicated in the names of two hills with fortifications. Near the summit of Dumyat hill in the Ochils, overlooking Stirling, there are remains of a fort and the name of the hill (in Gaelic &quot;Dùn Mhèad&quot;) is believed to derive from name meaning the hill of the Maeatae. The prominent hill fort may have marked their northern boundary. The first excavations of Dumyat were led by Dr Murray Cook, who recovered a radiocarbon date from a newly discovered external ditch dating to the 5th to 7th centuries AD. Myot Hill, near Fankerton, plausibly marks their southern limits. A discussion of two views of the importance of Dumyat and Myot Hill is given in Wainwright. There are three other potential Maeatae placenames in Scotland, potentially giving them a territory from Balfron to West Lothian and potentially St Andrews. &quot;Dunmanyn&quot;, Dalmeny, West Lothian (James 2013, :‘P-Celtic in Southern Scotland and Cumrbria: a review of the place-name evidence for possible Pictish phonology’, &quot;Journal of Scottish Names Studies&quot; 7: 29-78.), &quot;Cremannan&quot;, Balfron, Stirlingshire (Taylor, S, Clancy, T O, McNiven, P &amp; Williamson, E 2020 &quot;The Place-Names of Clackmannanshire.&quot; Shaun Tyas: Donnington) and &quot;Rummond&quot; (&quot;Rodmanand&quot;), St Andrews, Fife (Taylor, S 2009 &quot;The Placenames of Fife, Vol. 3 St Andrews and the East Neuk&quot;. Donnington: Shaun Tyas).
Cassius Dio describes them in detail in his &quot;Roman History&quot; (Book LXXVII), and is later quoted by Joseph Ritson and others. John Rhys seems convinced that they occupied the land between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Tay or parts of what is now Clackmannanshire, Fife and Stirlingshire. He also suggests that the Isle of May might derive its name from the tribe. Dio mentions the Maeatae were between the wall and the Caledonians but there is some dispute over whether he is referring to Antonine&#x27;s Wall or Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Alexander del Mar says no-one really knows the identity of the Maeatae but he mentions that some authorities think they may have had a Norse origin.

They appear to have come together as a result of treaties struck between the Roman Empire and the various frontier tribes in the 180s AD under the governorship of Ulpius Marcellus. Virius Lupus is recorded as being obliged to buy peace from the Maeatae at the end of the second century.

In 210 AD, they began a serious revolt against the Roman Empire, which was reportedly a very bloody affair on both sides. Another revolt took place the following year. In 213 AD, Joseph Ritson records them receiving money from the Romans to keep the peace.

The Miathi, mentioned in Adomnán&#x27;s &quot;Life of Columba&quot;, probably to be identified with the Southern Picts, have been posited as the same group, their identity seemingly surviving in some form as late as the 6th or 7th centuries AD.

<text>Taiwan Beer (, or ) is a brand of mass market beer brewed by the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation (TTL). The brand is an icon of Taiwanese culture and is applied to the best-selling beer in the country.

==History==
===Japanese colonial period===
The company known today as TTL has its origins in a government agency established by Taiwan&#x27;s Japanese rulers in 1901. Initially, the Monopoly Bureau of the Taiwan Governor&#x27;s Office was responsible for all opium, salt, and camphor sold in Taiwan. In 1905, tobacco was added to the list of monopolised commodities and products.

In 1907, the Japanese colonial government began taxing liquor producers to create a new revenue stream. The government then remodelled the whole of Taiwan&#x27;s liquor industry, and set up much needed infrastructure and training.

Subsequently, in 1919, the Takasago Malted Beer Company, developer and owner of Taiwan&#x27;s first brewery, was established by Konosuke Abe and other investors, including figures from the Japanese wine industry, with a capital investment of two million Japanese yen. &quot;Takasago&quot; is the word that, since Japan&#x27;s Edo period, had served as the customary Japanese name for Taiwan.

 was erected in the then Kamihito District of Taipei. It was built using the same type of bricks as those of the nearby Governor-General&#x27;s office (now the Presidential Office Building); most of its equipment had been acquired second hand from an old brewery in Hawaii. Upon completion, it was more than in area (about the size of a football field), and was one of only three beer breweries in Asia, the others being the Sapporo Brewery in Japan and the Tsingtao Brewery in China.
In its early years, the brewery was operated by Japanese brew masters. Its product, an ale (as opposed to a lager) first brewed in June 1920, was marketed as Takasago Beer (), and was made in two styles, namely light malt and dark malt.

The investors&#x27; original plan was to export the company&#x27;s product, but its initial quality was inferior to that of Japanese beers, and early export results were unsatisfactory. The company therefore decided to enjoy tax exemptions by selling Takasago Beer locally; beer was not yet then covered by any monopoly in Taiwan.

In 1922, under the influence of a post-World War I depression, the government attempted to nationalise the liquor industry by placing it under the exclusive control of the Monopoly Bureau. At that time, however, Taiwan had a highly competitive market for imported Japanese beers, and importers successfully lobbied members of the Imperial Diet to spare beer from the monopoly program.

Takasago Beer soon became very popular amongst Japanese drinkers in Taiwan, who preferred it to saké because it was a better thirst quencher during Taiwan&#x27;s burdensome summers. With the support of a network of Takasago beer houses and advertising on billboards in Taiwan&#x27;s major cities, Takasago Beer developed a big following in the 1920s. By 1925, it was Taiwan&#x27;s leading brand of beer. Exports of the product to Tokyo began to rival Sapporo Beer, the leading Japanese brand.

Eventually, in 1933, the local market beer monopoly was reintroduced, with effect from July of that year. Over 200 liquor industry businesses were shut down, and private brewing was banned. The Monopoly Bureau began a practice of purchasing the local market products of Takasago Malted Beer Company in batches and then reselling them; the company also continued to export some of its products.

Although by then its competitiveness in terms of productivity and quality had improved from its early days, the company was still a long way short of profitability, and relied upon the monopoly to cover its losses.

Under the local market monopoly regime, beer was expensive. Most Taiwanese had trouble finding enough food, and could not afford to drink beer, bottles of which were so costly that the asking price is known to have exceeded the price of pork. The company&#x27;s business of selling costly beer boomed, and even the Bank of Taiwan chose to invest in it. The company also secured the support of the major Japanese breweries in obtaining raw materials. Merchants vied for local market distributors and vendors licences issued by the Monopoly Bureau, and corruption was reported to be rife. The Monopoly Bureau could rely upon a variety of excuses to revoke such a licence.

During World War II, Allied airstrikes badly damaged Taiwan&#x27;s liquor-producing facilities. Production was very substantially reduced. Meanwhile, in the early 1940s, matches, petroleum, and standard weights and measures also came under the Monopoly Bureau&#x27;s authority.

===Post-World War II period===
After the war, the incoming Chinese Nationalists set up the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, which preserved the monopoly system by establishing the &quot;Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau&quot;, and also took over the assets of the hitherto privately owned brewery. Takasago Beer was renamed Taiwan Beer in 1946. The following year, the Administrative Office&#x27;s successor, the Taiwan Provincial Government, reorganised the monopoly system, by forming the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau. Simultaneously, the number of monopolised items was reduced; from then onwards, only tobacco and alcohol remained, together with camphor until 1968.

The sudden departure of Taiwan&#x27;s Japanese brewers in 1945 led to a lack of brewing expertise on the island. The government therefore promptly sent some of its employees to Germany to study beer brewing. That decision may have led to the replacement of the island&#x27;s thick, malty pre-World War II ales with the light, bright, crisp and sweet German-style lagers that have been brewed as Taiwan Beer ever since the brand&#x27;s name change.

In the late 1940s, after the Chinese Nationalists had lost the civil war in China, more than 800,000 of them retreated to Taiwan, where they came to account for around 10% of the population. That influx, combined with the departure of Japanese nationals, led to changes in consumer preferences, but initially demand for beer was not much affected.

The Korean War (1950–1953) led to an intensification of the cooperation between the USA and the Chinese Nationalists. The USA funded several important aid programs in Taiwan between 1950 and 1965. Many American advisors and military personnel were stationed on the island during that period, especially after the signing of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty in 1954, and their presence caused a beer sales boom.

During the 1960s, domestically produced (&quot;Formosa rice&quot; ) was added to Taiwan Beer&#x27;s fermentation process, resulting in the distinctive local flavour for which the beer is known today. The recipe was altered not only to make the brew sweeter and less bitter, but also to absorb a surplus of locally produced rice that was suppressing prices and thus limiting the incomes of farmers. Adding rice to the brew also lowered production costs.

In 1964, the Monopoly Bureau responded to an increase in demand for beer by cooperating with Dominion Breweries of New Zealand in learning, practising and adopting the patented brewing technique of continuous fermentation.

In November 1965, Taiwan became part of the Rest and Recuperation (R&amp;R) program, under which US military personnel could take a short vacation in a number of places in Asia. From then until the program ended in April 1972, almost 250,000 Americans had a vacation in Taiwan. A new industry of American-style bars emerged on the island, and thousands of women were employed to serve beer and other alcoholic beverages, and otherwise entertain bar guests. Soon after the American forces pulled out of Vietnam, the Taiwanese American-style bar industry vanished.

Meanwhile, the Monopoly Bureau constructed new breweries, in Wuri District, Taichung City, in 1966, and then in Shanhua District, Tainan, in 1973. To meet public demand, it introduced canned beer in 1975. Also in 1975, Taiwan Beer&#x27;s brewery complex in Taipei was renamed as the Jianguo Brewery (). It has since been renamed again, and is now known as the Taipei Brewery.

During the 1980s, an important new type of drinking establishment, the beerhouse, appeared in Taiwan. The first one opened in Taipei in 1983, and there were soon many more, in that city and others. Typically constructed in a log cabin-style, beerhouses appealed to the Taiwanese fascination for western culture. Patrons would hang out in beerhouses after work and late at night, drinking beer and eating local dishes, such as fried clams, fried crab legs and snails. However, beerhouses were also controversial, and by the end of the decade enthusiasm for them had waned.

===Democratic era===
In 1987 Taiwan lifted martial law and, under pressure from the US government, opened its beer market to foreign imports from America and Europe. Up to that point Taiwan Beer held 99% of the market. Not long after that year, imports from Japan and Southeast Asia were also permitted. However, the local brews were initially protected by high tariffs.

In 1991–92, production of Taiwan Beer reached its absolute peak of 144 million bottles per annum, and in the latter year modern automated computer-controlled production and environmental protection equipment was installed at the Taipei Brewery. However, imported beers gradually increased their market share, and competition between them and Taiwan Beer became very intense.

Taiwan entered its modern period of pluralistic democracy in the 1990s. Free trade and open markets became priorities as Taiwan prepared for admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002, and the government found itself under outside pressure to liberalise markets. At the start of that year, laws fully opening Taiwan&#x27;s liquor market to competing products went into force, and the already reduced tariffs were eliminated.

In July 2002, the Monopoly Bureau was corporatised and renamed Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation (TTL). That year, Chinese beers were permitted to be imported into Taiwan, and foreign beers reached a peak of 26% of the market. However, TTL&#x27;s marketing strategies have since regained some of Taiwan Beer&#x27;s market share.

In the two decades leading up to the start of the 2010s, advertising for Taiwan Beer focused on its freshness; towards the end of that period, TTL also introduced several new beer styles, and a new logo, bottle design and commercial campaign for &quot;Gold Medal&quot;, the brand&#x27;s most popular style.

During the 2000s, TTL also took steps to introduce Taiwan Beer to the Chinese market. Initially, its efforts to register the Taiwan Beer brand as a trademark were thwarted several times in reliance upon China&#x27;s trademark law, which forbade the registration of a geographical name as part of a trademark. The necessary procedures for Taiwan Beer to be sold in China were finally completed in 2009, after several years of negotiations. Within two months, TTL started shipping Taiwan Beer to China; the following year, the corporation began brewing the product in Jiangsu Province.

Taiwan Beer remains the island&#x27;s best-selling beer brand and is one of the most recognised brands in Taiwan&#x27;s business world. However, according to figures released by Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Finance, its market share has dropped dramatically in recent years, from nearly 85% in 2009 to only 70% in 2015 and just 60% in 2019, in each case by volume.

==Beers==

The best selling of the many styles of Taiwan Beer are amber lager beers brewed along pilsner lines. They have a distinct character and flavour, generated by the addition of locally produced ponlai rice to the malt during the fermentation process.

The rice imparts both a smoothness and a sweetness, and has been said by one reviewer to add &quot;... a certain umami and sake-like note not found in most Asian lagers.&quot;

Like all mass market beers, the popular styles of Taiwan Beer are filtered and pasteurised. They are mass-produced at four locations, namely the original in Taipei, the in Shanhua District, Tainan, the in Wuri District, Taichung City, and the in Zhunan, Miaoli County. Some styles are also brewed on-site at the Taiwan Beer Bar, a brewpub in Taipei.

Taiwan Beer is served cold and best complements Taiwanese and Japanese cuisine, especially seafood dishes such as sushi and sashimi. It has won international awards, including the Monde Selection many times since 1997, and the Brewing Industry International Awards in 2002. It has also been exported successfully to China, the United States, Japan, Korea, France, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and Cambodia.

Several lager-style brews bear the label Taiwan Beer. The original brew, now known as &quot;Classic&quot;, is sold in brown bottles with a green and white label, and in white cans bearing a blue striped design with green lettering. A rough-and-ready concoction rated at 4.5% ABV, it is made to a recipe dating from the 1960s.
The &quot;Gold Medal&quot; brew, which was introduced in April 2003 and became Taiwan Beer&#x27;s top-selling style that year, has a higher maltose content than &quot;Classic&quot;, and therefore a smoother taste. It also uses a larger proportion of ponlai rice and aromatic hops, which give it &quot;a fresh and clean aroma&quot;.

&quot;Gold Medal&quot; is rated at 5% ABV. It is sold in green bottles, and in cans that reproduce the white, red, and green label seen on the bottle. Its more refined and rounded flavour was intended to appeal to younger drinkers. In May 2004, TTL hired 144 Taiwan Beer girls to promote it in restaurants and small pubs, and also in fashionable pubs and night clubs where the brand had not previously been able to make much headway.

Both of the first two lagers are mainstream styles also regularly seen in Taiwan&#x27;s convenience and grocery stores.

The brand has also introduced craft style lager brews. &quot;Premium&quot; is a 5% ABV European pale lager brewed at low temperature using 100% Munich malt. It is marketed in brown bottles with a gold and white label, and in gold and white cans. &quot;18 Day Draft&quot;, unusually, is unpasteurised, and therefore retains the nutritional value of its yeast while also tasting fresher. It was introduced to the range in 2003, after visitors to Taiwan Beer breweries had commented favourably on the flavour, mouthfeel and smoothness of freshly brewed unpasteurised beer they had been permitted to sample during brewery tours. Rated at 5% ABV, it is sold in signature solid green bottles with no paper label, and also in green cans. It is designed to be sold freshly brewed, and is not often seen in stores, as it expires just 18 days after production.

In 2008, Taiwan Beer began selling an amber malt brew bearing the &quot;Mine&quot; label. &quot;Mine&quot; bottles are green with white, gold and blue labels, and cans are white, gold and blue. The following year, the &quot;Mine&quot; brew was joined by &quot;Mine Dark&quot;. Both &quot;Mine&quot; malts are 5% ABV.
More recently, in 2013, a wheat beer, Taiwan Beer Weissbier, was added to the lineup; it is 5% ABV, and is sold in brown 600ml bottles with white and bronze labels, and white 330ml cans with similar artwork.

Further beverages marketed under the Taiwan Beer brand include stouts, &quot;fruit beers&quot; (mango, pineapple, grape and orange; 2.8% ABV), alcohol-free beers, and non-alcoholic flavoured beers. Amongst other new products, Taiwan Beer has launched the &quot;Brew Lab&quot; series &quot;for refined tastes&quot;, the &quot;Sweet Touch&quot; series of fresh local fruit juices blended with beer/wine, and &quot;Gold Medal Free&quot;, a non-alcoholic beer for drivers.

The fruit beers were introduced after foreign brewers started building factories in Taiwan, a move that negated Taiwan Beer&#x27;s hitherto competitive advantage of freshness in its local market. The initial idea was to create beer styles that included &#x27;Taiwan flavours&#x27;, being the flavours of agricultural products characteristic of the island, which is a leading fruit producer. TTL also hoped that fruit beers would be lighter, more refreshing, and would attract more female consumers. The fruits chosen included Irwin mangoes from Yujing District in Tainan, Golden Diamond pineapples from Guanmiao, also in Tainan, and Black Queen grapes from Erlin in Changhua County.

The manufacture of fruit beer is not a simple process. The pectin in the fruit juice must be removed, as it would increase the beer&#x27;s viscosity and accelerate the process of oxidisation; pineapple juice must also be heated to destroy enzymes that would break down protein in the beer. The R&amp;D team at the Wuri Brewery carried out many experiments with the temperature, humidity and pressure of subsequent processes to formulate the best methods of making the fruit beers, which have been much appreciated and generated positive reviews.

==Culture==
Taiwan Beer is a national icon strongly identified with Taiwanese culture, and a symbol of local resilience and pride. During a trade dispute with the People&#x27;s Republic of China in December 2022, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan, Joseph Wu, even described it as &quot;... the great taste of freedom&quot;. Another view of the brand, as expressed by a Taiwanese private sector website, is:

The brand&#x27;s iconic status in Taiwan is reinforced by TTL marketing strategies. Advertisements have featured Taiwanese celebrities such as rock guitarist Wu Bai, who was appointed as the public face of Taiwan Beer in 1998, and diva A-Mei, who became a spokesmodel for the brand in 2006.

Two basketball teams, one a Super Basketball League outfit named &quot;Taiwan Beer&quot; (popularly nicknamed &#x27;The Brew Crew&#x27;), and another one, which competes in the T1 League under the name &quot;TaiwanBeer HeroBears&quot;, are sponsored by the brand. So too is the &quot;Taiwan Beer&quot; baseball team, which TTL established and operates in cooperation with the National Taiwan Sport University.
The oldest industrial plant that produces the brand, the Jianguo Brewery complex in Taipei, is now more than a century old. It has been designated by the Taipei City Government as an historic site, for its historical and architectural value. The complex is made up of two large buildings, a red-brick one and a green-tiled one, flanked by a number of smaller wooden-framed and other structures. Inside the buildings, modern automated items of equipment, including stainless steel mash tuns, are in operation. The walls of the Taipei brewery are decorated with black-and-white photographs depicting earlier methods of production. The original copper mash tuns are no longer used, but remain in place as drawcards for tourists.

In the 21st century, the four TTL breweries have become tourist attractions as well as factories. , TTL had plans to transform the Taipei brewery into a beer culture district park; the Shanhua Brewery was offering taste tests of fruit beers; the Wuri Brewery was expected to become the site of a Taiwan Beer brand experience centre; and the Zhunan Brewery was already operating concurrently as a Hakka culture promotion centre.
Restaurants and nightspots proliferate at the &#x27;beer village&#x27; adjacent to the Wuri Brewery, which has become the centre of Taiwan&#x27;s beer culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;i tc/wd&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After the nearby Taichung station on the Taiwan High Speed Rail was opened in January 2007, the Taichung City government teamed up with the Taichung High Speed Rail Tourism Development Association to transform Guanghua Street, on which the brewery is located, into a beer tourist street. It was officially opened in August 2008. Inside the brewery is a shop/visitor centre that includes an exhibition hall detailing the beer brewing process, and describing both the history of Taiwan Beer, and the history of beer as far back as 5000 BCE.

Additionally, the Wuri beer village has been a site of the annual Taiwan Beer Festival (台灣啤酒節, &quot;Táiwān Píjiǔjié&quot;), which is held in summer.

There is also the Taiwan Beer Bar and Beer Garden brewpub in Taipei. It has received mixed reviews: one reviewer praised the bar as a &quot;light airy space&quot; and the beer garden as &quot;really worth a visit&quot;, while another writer dismissed the bar as having &quot;something of a crude beer hall ambience&quot;, albeit with &quot;the cheapest beer you can hope to find on the island&quot;.

==Competition==
Taiwan Beer leads its namesake market. Its main mass market competitor is Long Chuan, which is brewed in Neipu, a rural township near Kaohsiung City. Long Chuan launched a range of &quot;fruit beers&quot; in 2012, and Taiwan Beer&#x27;s introduction of a similar range was a response to that launch. In June 2022, Dutch brewing company Heineken N.V. announced that it had agreed to acquire Long Chuan from local company Taiwan Tsing Beer Corporation. , other significant foreign players in the Taiwanese beer market included Kirin and Budweiser.

Microbrews, handcrafted beers and other limited-distribution beers represent a separate category. Leading Taiwan artisan beers include Three Giants Brewing Company (巨人啤酒) with a range of Lagers, Pale Ales, IPAs, Wheat Beer and Dark Lager, Redpoint Brewing, which produced the island&#x27;s first IPA called 台PA, Formosa Bird Beer and Lychee Beer (both by North Taiwan Brewing) along with the house brews served in two locally owned restaurant chains, Jolly Brewery and Restaurant (operated by Great Reliance Food &amp; Beverage) and Le ble d&#x27;or.

<doc id="899798" wikidata="Q3332217" url="?curid=899798" title="Gorkha Kingdom">
<text>The Gorkha Kingdom, also known as the Gorkha Confederation or the Gorkha Empire, was a member of the Chaubisi rajya, a confederation of 24 states, located at the intersection of Himalayas and the Indian subcontinent. In 1743, the kingdom began a campaign of military expansion, annexing several neighbors and becoming present-day Nepal. 

The Gorkha Kingdom extended to the Marshyangdi River in the west, forming its border with the Kingdom of Lamjung. To the east, the kingdom extended to the Trishuli River, forming its border with the Nepal Mandala. The Gorkha Kingdom was established in 1559 CE by Prince Dravya Shah, the second son of King Yasho Brahma Shah of Lamjung. Dravya Shah replaced the Magar King Mansingh Khadka Magar who previously ruled the region. 

== Origin and history==
The founding of the gorkhas did not escape the influence of the Newars. One of the earliest Shah rulers was Rishi-raj Rana-Ji, of the Lunar dynasty (A Newars descendant). He was made the ruler of Chittorgarh and received the title of &quot;Bhattarak&quot;. The lunar dynasty remained in power for thirteen generations. Then, the Muslim Yavanas took power. The Bhattarak had to abdicate and could only retain his caste family name, &quot;Rana-ji&quot;. The rajas were titled &quot;Rana-Ji&quot; for four generations and &quot;Rana-ji Rava&quot; for a further seventeen generations.

Akbar, the Mughal emperor, (1542-1605) wished to marry the daughter of Fatte Sinha Rana-Ji Rava. Akbar was refused because he was not a Hindu but from a different religion (namely Islam). This decision led to the war. Many Rajputs, including Fatte Sinha Rana-ji Rava, were killed. The survivors of the war were led by Udaybam Rana-Ji Rava. They founded a settlement called Udaipur.

Manmath Rana-Ji Rava went to Ujjain. His son Bhupal Ranaji Rao went to Ridi in the northern hills in 1495 CE (Saka Era 1417), to Sargha, and then to Khium in Bhirkot. There, he cultivated the land. The new ruler of Khium had two sons, Kancha and Micha. Their &quot;bartabandha&quot; (the taking of the Bharmanical thread) was performed. Plans for the boys to marry the daughters of the Raghuvanshi Rajputs were made. Kancha, the elder son, went to Dhor. He conquered Magarat and reigned over Garhon, Sathum and Birkot. Micha, the younger son, went to Nuwakot in the far west and became ruler there.

From Micha, a dynasty of seven rajas commenced in Nuwakot. Kulamandan became ruler of Kaski, displacing the local Gurung king. He was favoured and became &quot;Shah&quot; and succeeded his father. Kalu, the second son was sent to Dura Danda in Lamjung at the people&#x27;s request to become their king. Kalu was killed by the Sekhant tribe, who were the ancestors of present-day Gurungs. In the 1500s, another son, Yasobramha, became the ruler of Lamjung after he compromised with the Gurungs. The second son of Yasobramha, Dravya Shah conquered the kingdom of Ligligkot from Magar king Dalshur Ghale Magar. Gangaram Rana Magar also helped Drabya Shah. At that time in Gorkha, Uppallokot (fort in the upper part) area and Tallokot (fort in the lower part) area of Gorkha were ruled by Magar King Mansingh Khadka Magar and king Dalshur Ghale Magar. Khadka Magar is a sub-clan of Rana Magar clan and (Ghale Magar) sub-clan of saru-Thapa-Magar clan. After Dravya Shah captured Liglig-kot from king Dalshur Ghale Magar, he captured Gorkha-kot, another Magarat area from the Magar King Mansingh Khadka Magar in 1559 CE and named the newly found kingdom Gorkha. 
The ancient name Gor-kha is derived from Gorakhnath.

==List of kings of Gorkha==
The following is a list of the ten kings of the Gorkha principality:
==Expansion campaign==

From 1736, the Gorkhalis engaged in a campaign of expansion begun by King Nara Bhupal Shah, which was continued by his son, King Prithvi Narayan Shah and grandson Prince Bahadur Shah. Over the years, they conquered huge tracts of land to the east and west of Gorkha.

Among their conquests, the most important and valuable acquisition was the wealthy Newar confederacy of Nepal Mandala centered in the Kathmandu Valley. Starting in 1745, the Gorkhalis mounted a blockade in a bid to starve the population into submission, but the inhabitants held out.

The Newars appealed to the British East India Company to help, and in 1767, it sent an expedition under Captain Kinloch which ended in failure. The three Newar capitals of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur fell to the Gorkhalis between 1768 and 1769. The Gorkhali king subsequently moved his capital to Kathmandu.

In 1788, the Gorkhalis turned their attention north and invaded Tibet. They seized the border towns of Kyirong and Kuti, and forced the Tibetans to pay an annual tribute. When the Tibetans stopped paying it, the Gorkhalis invaded Tibet again in 1791 and plundered the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse. This time the Chinese army came to Tibet&#x27;s defence and advanced close to Kathmandu but could not achieve success due to strong counterattack. The anxious Bahadur Shah asked for 10 howitzer mountain guns from the British East India Company. Captain William Kirkpatrick arrived in Kathmandu, however the deal was not made due to unfavorable circumstances for the Gorkhalis. Eventually, the Fu Kanggan was keen to protect his army and the war being resultless was concluded by signing a peace treaty at Betrawati.

A later Nepalese–Tibetan War was fought from 1855 to 1856 in Tibet between the forces of the Tibetan government (Ganden Phodrang, then under administrative rule of the Qing dynasty) and the invading Nepalese army, resulting in the victory of Nepal.

The Gorkha dominion reached its height at the beginning of the 19th century, extending all along the Himalayan foothills from Kumaon and Garhwal in the west to Sikkim in the east. They were made to return much of the occupied territories after their defeat in the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–1816).

==Gorkha to Nepal==

The Gorkha dominion continued to be known as &quot;Gorkha Rajya&quot; () until the beginning of the 20th century. Historically, the name &#x27;Nepal&#x27; referred mainly to Kathmandu valley, the homeland of the Newars. Since the 1930s, the state began using it to refer to the entire country and &#x27;Nepal Khaldo&#x27; (Nepal Valley) became &#x27;Kathmandu Valley&#x27;. The name Gorkha Sarkar (meaning Gorkha government) was also changed to Nepal government.

Similarly, the Gorkhali language was renamed as Nepali in 1933. The term Gorkhali in the former national anthem entitled &quot;Shreeman Gambhir&quot; was changed to Nepali in 1951. The government newspaper, launched in 1901, is still known as Gorkhapatra (meaning Gorkha gazette).

The Shah dynasty ruled Nepal until 2008 when it became a republic following a people&#x27;s movement. Today, Gorkha District, roughly corresponding to the old kingdom, is one of the 77 administrative districts of Nepal.

==Gurkhas==
Not to be confused with the inhabitants of the old Gorkha Kingdom only, the Gurkhas are also military units in the British or the Indian army (where they are known as Gorkhas) enlisted in Nepal and India. Their history goes back to the Anglo-Gorkha War and the Sugauli Treaty of 1816. It allowed the British East India Company to recruit men from the Gorkha kingdom hills to serve as mercenaries.

During World War II (1939–45), a total of 250,280 Gurkhas served in 40 battalions, plus eight Nepalese Army battalions, plus parachute, training, garrison, and porter units. They earned 2,734 bravery awards, and suffered around 32,000 casualties in all theatres.

<text>Scriabin&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 2 in G-sharp minor, (Op. 19, also titled &quot;Sonata-Fantasy&quot;) took five years for him to write. It was finally published in 1898, at the urging of his publisher. The piece is in two movements, with a style combining Chopin-like Romanticism with an impressionistic touch. The piece is widely appreciated and is one of Scriabin&#x27;s most popular pieces.

The first movement &quot;Andante&quot;, in sonata form, begins with echoing effects, followed by two lyrically themed sections. The first theme is in G-Sharp minor, but the following two come in B major (the relative major). After a short climax in the development, the piece modulates to E major (also C-sharp minor) for the recapitulation and lyrical sections are restated with a slightly more complicated accompaniment. The second movement &quot;Presto&quot;, in sharp contrast to the first movement, is very fast and intense. Alternating crescendos and decrescendos may give the listener the impression of waves.

The precedent of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight&quot; Sonata allowed Scriabin the luxury of an opening slow movement to his Second Sonata, whose programme reads thus: 
&quot;The first section represents the quiet of a southern night on the seashore; the development is the dark agitation of the deep, deep sea. The E major middle section shows caressing moonlight coming up after the first darkness of night. The second movement represents the vast expanse of ocean in stormy agitation.&quot;

Typical of Scriabin&#x27;s piano sonatas, it is technically and musically demanding for the pianist. A typical performance lasts about 11 minutes.

<doc id="899812" wikidata="Q263613" url="?curid=899812" title="Keri Hulme">
<text>Keri Ann Ruhi Hulme (9 March 194727 December 2021) was a New Zealand novelist, poet and short-story writer. She also wrote under the pen name Kai Tainui. Her novel &quot;The Bone People&quot; won the Booker Prize in 1985; she was the first New Zealander to win the award, and also the first writer to win the prize for a debut novel. Hulme&#x27;s writing explores themes of isolation, postcolonial and multicultural identity, and Māori, Celtic, and Norse mythology.

== Early life ==
Hulme was born on 9 March 1947 in Burwood Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand. The daughter of John William Hulme, a carpenter, and Mary Ann Miller, a credit manager, she was the eldest of six children. Her father was a first-generation New Zealander whose parents were from Lancashire, England, and her mother came from Oamaru, of Orkney Scots and Māori descent (Kāi Tahu and Kāti Māmoe). &quot;Our family comes from diverse people: Kāi Tahu, Kāti Māmoe (South Island Māori iwi); Orkney Islanders; Lancashire folk; Faroese and/or Norwegian migrants,&quot; Hulme stated.

Hulme grew up in Christchurch at 160 Leaver Terrace, New Brighton, where she attended North New Brighton Primary School and Aranui High School. She described herself as a &quot;very definite and determined child who inherently hate[d] assumed authority&quot;. In 1958, when she was 11, her father died. Hulme remembered herself as being interested in writing from a young age. She rewrote Enid Blyton stories the way she thought they should have been written, wrote poetry from the age of 12, and composed short stories; her mother organised the side front porch into a study for her after her father&#x27;s death. Some of her poems and short stories were published in Aranui High School&#x27;s magazine. The family spent their holidays with her mother&#x27;s family at Moeraki, on the Otago East Coast, and Hulme identified Moeraki as her , &quot;the standing-place of my heart&quot;. 

After high school, Hulme worked as a tobacco picker in Motueka. She began studying for an honours law degree at the University of Canterbury in 1967, but left after four terms—feeling &quot;estranged/out-of-place&quot;—and returned to tobacco picking, although she continued to write.

==Career==

By 1972, Hulme had accumulated a large quantity of notes and drawings and decided to begin writing full-time, but, despite financial support from her family, she returned to work nine months later. She worked in a range of jobs, including in retail, as a fish-and-chips cook, a winder at a woollen mill, and as a mail deliverer in Greymouth, on the West Coast of the South Island. She was also a pharmacist&#x27;s assistant at Grey Hospital, a proofreader and journalist at the &quot;Grey Evening Star&quot;, and an assistant television director on the shows &quot;Country Calendar&quot;, &quot;Dig This&quot; and &quot;Play School&quot;. She continued writing, and had her work published in journals and magazines; some appeared under the pseudonym Kai Tainui. 

Hulme received Literary Fund grants in 1973, 1977, and 1979, and in 1979 she was a guest at the East-West Center in Hawaii as a visiting poet. Hulme held the 1977 Robert Burns Fellowship and became writer-in-residence at the University of Otago in 1978. During this time, she continued working on her novel, &quot;the bone people.&quot; 

Hulme submitted the manuscript for &quot;the bone people&quot; to several publishers over a period of 12 years, until it was accepted for publication by the Spiral Collective, a feminist literary and arts collective in New Zealand. The book was published in February 1984 and won the 1984 New Zealand Book Award for Fiction and the Booker Prize in 1985. Hulme was the first New Zealander to win the Booker Prize and also the first writer to win the prize for their debut novel. The ceremony was broadcast on Channel 4 and as Hulme was unable to attend she asked three women from Spiral – Irihapeti Ramsden, Marian Evans and Miriama Evans – to accept the award on her behalf. Ramsden and Miriama Evans walked up to the podium wearing Māori korowai, arm in arm with Marian Evans in a tuxedo, and chanted a Māori karanga as they went.

In 1985, Hulme was writer-in-residence at the University of Canterbury and in 1990 she was awarded the 1990 Scholarship in Letters from the Queen Elizabeth Arts Council Literature Committee for two years. Also in 1990, she was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In 1996 she became the patron of New Zealand Republic. Hulme also served on the Literary Fund Advisory Committee (1985–1989) and New Zealand&#x27;s Indecent Publications Tribunal (1985–1990).

Around 1986 Hulme began working on a second novel, &quot;BAIT&quot;, about fishing and death. She also worked on a third novel, &quot;On the Shadow Side;&quot; these two works were referred to by Hulme as &quot;twinned novels&quot;.

Common themes in Hulme&#x27;s writing are identity and isolation. Inspiration for her characters and stories also often came to her in dreams; she first dreamt of a mute, long-haired boy when she was 18, and wrote a short story about him called &quot;Simon Peter’s Shell&quot;. The boy continued to appear in her dreams and eventually became the main character of &quot;the bone people.&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
In 1973, Hulme won a land ballot and became the owner of a plot in the remote coastal settlement of Ōkārito in south Westland, on the South Island of New Zealand. She built an octagonal house on the land and spent most of her adult life (almost 40 years) there. She vocally opposed plans to develop the settlement with additional housing or tourist facilities and believed it deserved special government protection. In late 2011, Hulme announced that she was leaving the area as local body rates (property taxes) meant she could no longer afford to live there. She identified as atheist, aromantic, and asexual.

Hulme&#x27;s given name was recorded at birth as &quot;Kerry&quot;, although her family used the spelling &quot;Keri&quot;. She legally changed her name to &quot;Keri&quot; in 2001. 

She died from dementia at a care home in Waimate on 27 December 2021, at the age of 74.

<text>Nymphalis antiopa, known as the mourning cloak in North America and the Camberwell beauty in Britain, is a large butterfly native to Eurasia and North America. The immature form of this species is sometimes known as the spiny elm caterpillar. Other older names for this species include grand surprise and white petticoat. A powerful flier, this species is sometimes found in areas far from its usual range during migration.

These butterflies have a lifespan of 11 to 12 months, one of the longest lifespans for any butterfly. It is the state insect of the U.S. state of Montana, adopted in 2001.

==Etymology==
The specific epithet &quot;antiopa&quot; is thought to be derived from Antiope, a common name in Greek mythology.

=== North American name &quot;mourning cloak&quot; ===
In several European countries with Germanic languages, other than Britain, the name for this butterfly literally translates to &quot;mourning cloak&quot;, such as German &quot;Trauermantel&quot;, Dutch &quot;rouwmantel&quot;, Swedish &quot;sorgmantel&quot;, Finnish &quot;suruvaippa&quot; and Norwegian &quot;sørgekåpe&quot;. This suggests it is a name which came with Scandinavian or German rather than with British settlers, for whom this species would be considerably less familiar. Other common names include: Czech &quot;Černopláštník&quot; . &quot;Babočka osiková&quot;. Polish &quot;Rusałka żałobnik&quot;. Russian &quot;Траурница&quot; . Japanese &quot;キベリタテハ&quot; . Chinese &quot;黄縁立羽&quot;. L. Hugh Newman likened the butterfly&#x27;s pattern to a girl who, disliking having to be in mourning, defiantly let a few inches of a bright dress show below her mourning dress.

===British name &quot;Camberwell beauty&quot;===
The name originated from the discovery of two individuals at Coldharbour Lane in Camberwell in August 1748. Camberwell is in South London, about three miles south of London Bridge—in reporting this, the author Moses Harris named the species grand surprise or Camberwell beauty (Bretherton &amp; Emmet, 1990).

==Distribution==
The mourning cloak butterflies are distributed broadly around the northern hemisphere. They are commonly found throughout all of North America and northern Eurasia. Three subspecies of mourning cloak butterflies are found throughout North America: northern &quot;Nymphalis antiopa hyperborea&quot; Seitz, 1913; eastern &quot;N. a. lintnerii&quot; Fitch, 1857; southwestern &quot;N. a. thomsoni&quot; Butler, 1887. They can usually be found in hardwood forests, though they have been found in virtually all habitats. They may also be found as far as the northern part of South America, though they are typically not seen as frequently in southern states such as Florida, Louisiana, or Texas. They are occasionally seen in the more temperate places in Asia, and a few have even been seen in Japan. However, the mourning cloaks tend to be found predominantly in cold, mountainous areas.

Migrants arrive in Great Britain most years during summer and autumn, but numbers are usually very low. There is no evidence that the species breeds in Britain; it is thought that mild, wet winters prevent them from surviving there for very long. The &#x27;Butterfly Farmer&#x27; L. Hugh Newman raised thousands for release at his &#x27;farm&#x27; in Bexley, but none were seen the following spring. Specimens stored in his refrigerator for the winter, however, survived. In a book he said that Camberwell Beauty catches in England were suspiciously concentrated around London, Hull and Harwich, all these being ports in the timber trade with Scandinavia, and theorized that they had hibernated in stacks of timber which was then shipped to England, and had not traveled naturally.

==Morphology ==
===Eggs===
Mourning cloak eggs are amber-yellow or pale olive-green when first laid. Upon further development, the coloration of the eggs will change, becoming lilac-pink, and darkening to almost black, as they mature prior to hatching. The eggs are generally 0.7 by 0.9 mm in size. Laid on terminal shoots of the larval food-plant, encircling the stem. Later in season, when the leaves appear, females also lay the eggs on the upper surface.

===Larvae===
The spiny caterpillars are striking in appearance, with black bodies and a line of eight reddish-orange dots running down the back (aposematic, warning coloration). The prolegs are dark red. The body is covered with short hairs and black spines and white dots. The fully grown mourning cloak caterpillars attain two inches in length.

===Pupae===
Mourning cloak pupae are on average 0.8 inches (2.0 cm) in length, though they can reach over 1.1 inches (2.8 cm) in length. They tend to be a tan or brown gray, with two rows of sharp, red-tipped spikes protruding from the ventro-lateral side of the pupae. The chrysalis has a &quot;beak&quot;, tubercles, and two head horns.

===Adult===
The mourning cloak butterfly is a large, unique butterfly, with special markings that do not match those of any other butterfly, making it easily distinguishable. It can have a wingspan up to four inches. The dorsal side of its wings are a dark maroon, or occasionally brown, with ragged pale-yellow edges. Bright, iridescent blue spots line the black demarcation between the maroon and the yellow. The ventral side of the wings has gray striations, with the same pale-yellow edges. They are a part of the family Nymphalidae, called the brush-footed butterflies due to their hairy front legs. The species does not display any obvious sexual dimorphism.

==Reproduction and development==
===Mating system===
Mourning cloak butterflies display polygynous mating behavior, where an individual male will mate with multiple females throughout one breeding season. He will either use a display site to attract females or fly around searching for females that are more widely dispersed in a process called scramble competition polygyny. This means that male mourning cloak butterflies primarily lek, or display territorial behavior, in which they settle and defend desirable areas, such as those that either offer increased probability of females or those that provide ample amounts of good resources. The more desirable territories will be able to increase the males&#x27; chances of reproductive success. Thus, lekking maximizes the males&#x27; ability to attract the most female butterflies, either by being in a prime location to view them or to have a location that females would want to visit. Locations of choice typically include sunny perches near ravines, wood margins, parks, gardens, lakes, ponds, around stream edges, or canyons in which males can perch and defend for multiple days. These locations can be more than an area of 300 square meters. Given the male-male competition for mating, this strategy offers males an ideal location in order to maximize success in territorial protection, and thus mating. Despite the fact that butterflies, particularly the mourning cloak butterflies, have an affinity for perches on high objects, they are not known to display any hilltopping behavior, where male butterflies fly up to perch on hill summits.

Spring marks the beginning of their mating season, when female mourning cloaks will find a host plant and begin to lay their eggs. Adult mourning cloak butterflies can first be seen in late spring through early summer. They then aestivate for the summer, where they will enter into a &quot;dormant&quot; state similar to that of hibernation. In concordance with this is the mourning cloak butterflies&#x27; exhibition of diapause, which is a suspension in development in response to certain conditions, such as environmental stimuli. They will break diapause once some, though not all, of the butterflies start to migrate through September and October. They then overwinter, and then restart their mating cycle throughout the spring, from April through June.

===Life cycle===
Mourning cloaks, like all other butterflies, undergo complete metamorphosis. Egg →Larva (L1 ... L5) → Pupa → Adult. Before the leaves bud-out, Mourning cloaks are known to lay their eggs as ring clusters around the terminal twigs on host plants. The host plant selection is vital because it provides the food source for the young caterpillars. Females are known to have multiple broods, typically up to two to three. The newly hatched caterpillars will group together until they shed their skin—termed an instar for each shedding. This shedding event occurs four times throughout development in a process called ecdysis. The larvae experience a fifth skin shed to produce a fully grown caterpillar. The next stage in the mourning cloak&#x27;s life cycle is to morph into a pupa and then cocoon in a process that encases the creature in a tan or gray chrysalis, which will hang from the stems of grass. This pupa stage allows for resting and further maturation. This metamorphosis takes approximately fifteen days. Following development as the chrysalis is the emergence of an adult mourning cloak butterfly.

Studies show that the mourning cloaks use endocrine mechanisms similar to other lepidopterans to regulate female specific protein synthesis, oogenesis, and male and female reproductive gland development. Juvenile hormone (JH) is involved in the regulation of oogenesis and development of the male and female reproductive glands in the mourning cloak butterfly.

==Behavior==
The adult butterflies hibernate during the winter months. Typical locations of overwintering include tree cavities and on the ground underneath loose tree bark (covered by snow). They often emerge from hibernation before the snow has completely melted, making it one of the first butterflies to take wing in the spring.

The mourning cloak is a non-migratory species but some sources suggest that a portion of the North American population migrates southward. Experiments carried out in Germany by Hubert Roer in 1962-68, documented a long-distance (one way) migration from Bonn to Greece (Chalkiditi).

==Ecology==
===Larval food-plants===
Upon hatching, the caterpillars will begin to eat the leaves of the larval food-plant. A large number of food-plant plants was recorded, such as willow (&quot;Salix nigra&quot;, &quot;Salix pentandra&quot;, &quot;Salix caprea&quot;, &quot;Salix aurita&quot;, &quot;Salix cinerea&quot;, &quot;Salix phylicifolia&quot;), American elm, hackberry, hawthorn, wild rose, &quot;Betula&quot; species (&quot;Betula verrucosa&quot;, &quot;Betula chinensis&quot;), &quot;Alnus incana&quot; and poplar. The caterpillars live gregariously in communal silken nest on the host-plant, until they disperse prior to pupation.

Adult mourning cloaks primarily feed on sap, ripe and fallen fruits and sugary exudate from aphids, very rarely seen nectaring on flowers.

===Predation===
The mourning cloak butterfly faces many predators throughout its development. The mourning cloak&#x27;s eggs can be eaten by predators such as beetles, true bugs, ants, beetle larvae, wasps, assassin bugs, and mites. Some of the butterflies&#x27; major predators include praying mantises, assassin bugs, dragon flies, and vertebrate predators such as birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals.

===Defense mechanisms===
An anti-predation mechanism the mourning cloaks have employed as adult butterflies is camouflage. To do this, the butterflies fold their wings back when attached to trees as their folded wings will provide camouflage against the dark backdrop of the trees.

An additional anti-predation tactic used by the mourning cloaks is to join together with other butterflies in a perch and fly menacingly towards their attackers—most often birds or other butterflies.

Mourning cloaks also play dead by closing their wings tightly together and tucking their legs up against their body for protection and holding completely still. They will maintain this for a few minutes before returning to their natural healthy and lively behavior. 

Further defense mechanisms include loud clicks when the mourning cloak flies away from a predator.

To protect themselves from the cold weather of their habitats, mourning cloaks will find areas under direct sunlight. This behavior, in conjunction with their darkly-colored wings, allow for maximum heat absorption.

Newly hatched mourning cloak caterpillars can display selfish behavior, such as siblicide, by eating non-hatched eggs. The larvae also group together for the duration of their development, preventing some predation by numbers. The larvae and pupae can also respond to disturbances by twitching simultaneously – this may be performed as a defense mechanism.

===Pollination===
Mourning cloak butterflies are not known to be significant pollinators, since their primary food source is sap of deciduous trees rather than flowering plants. However, they still can occasionally act as pollinators.

==Relationship to people==
===Pests===
On occasions, the gregarious mourning cloak larvae will completely defoliate ornamental trees, in nurseries, plantations, and parks. Some areas that this damage has been documented have been Oregon and Canada. The young willows and poplars could be completely defoliated due to the caterpillars, though mature trees tend not to be affected.

===Research===
Mourning cloak butterflies have been a part of some epigenetics experiments testing to determine if the environment affects certain butterfly phenotypic characteristics. Scientists hypothesized that traumatic heat or cold shocks &quot;during a critical period of its development can cause profound changes&quot;. The first experiments occurred in the 1890s. The mourning cloaks were temperature shocked at specific times in their development, which led to differences in pupae color. It was later learned that the color change was due to hormonal changes in response to varying temperatures.

===Conservation===
Mourning cloak butterflies are protected by law in Switzerland and Austria, though they generally have an increasing trend regarding population density in Finland. They also assume &quot;safe&quot; status in the Czech Republic. In general, the mourning cloak butterflies find areas that have experienced fire breaks to be more inviting, presumably because the fire breaks increase the amount of open space and clearings available to the butterflies, which is a more ideal habitat for these butterflies to live in.

==Subspecies==
Subspecies include:
* &quot;N. a. antiopa&quot; 
** The nominotypical subspecies. Type-locality: &quot;Sweden&quot;
* &quot;N. a. hyperborea&quot; (Canada, Alaska)
** This subspecies lays more amber-yellow eggs, instead of the olive-green. As the eggs develop, the coloration will change to lilac pinkish-purple. These larvae&#x27;s spines are shorter and stouter than those of European mourning cloak larvae. and the spots bordering the wing edges may be more of a violet color.
* &quot;N. a. lintnerii&quot; (slightly larger than preceding; se Canada, eastern US)
* &quot;N. a. asopos&quot; (Japan)

<doc id="899824" wikidata="Q1688915" url="?curid=899824" title="JibJab">
<text>JibJab is an American independent digital entertainment studio based in Los Angeles, California. Founded in 1999 by brothers Evan and Gregg Spiridellis, it first achieved widespread attention during the 2004 US presidential election when their video of George W. Bush and John Kerry singing &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot; became a viral hit. Initially known for political and social satire, JibJab produced commercials and shorts for clients such as Sony, Noggin, Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, PBS Kids, Sprout, NBC, Qubo, and Disney before focusing on its now-flagship personalized eCard and messaging services. In 2016, its animated sticker-making program – which has been available since 2004 – became the top App Store app by download growth.

In 2012, JibJab also expanded into the children&#x27;s educational market with its multi-platform learning program, StoryBots, which has since spawned two Netflix TV series, &quot;Ask the StoryBots&quot; and &quot;StoryBots Super Songs&quot;.

In 2019, JibJab was acquired by the private equity firm Catapult Capital.

==Political satire==

===&quot;Cooking With Clinton&quot;===
One of JibJab&#x27;s first animations &quot;Cooking With Clinton&quot; is about then-president Bill Clinton trying to show the viewers how to bake weed brownies while being high and repeatedly asking Hillary for a glass of water.

===&quot;Capitol Ill&quot;===
For the 2000 presidential election JibJab released a Flash movie entitled &quot;Capitol Ill&quot; in July 2000, which featured an animated rap battle between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush also make appearances. This cartoon aired on &quot;Mad TV&quot; on November 4, 2000.

===&quot;Ahnuld for Governor&quot;===
In 2003, JibJab produced a Flash movie poking fun at Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s campaign for Governor of California. It depicts Schwarzenegger giving a campaign speech.

===&quot;This Land&quot;===
For the 2004 United States presidential election, JibJab created a Flash movie entitled &quot;This Land&quot;, released on July 9, 2004, which featured animated versions of George W. Bush and John Kerry - voiced by comedian Jim Meskimen - singing a parody of Woody Guthrie&#x27;s song &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;.

The video was an instant success, eventually being viewed all over the world, as well as the International Space Station. The traffic surge forced JibJab&#x27;s server to be shut down after one day, and the clip was placed on AtomFilms, where it got more than 1 million hits in 24 hours.

After being linked to on thousands of websites, the video was featured several times in the printed media and on television, including &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, Fox News and &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;. On July 26, 2004, the creators appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. In December 2004, the Spiridellis brothers were named People of the Year by Peter Jennings.

The Richmond Organization, a music publisher that owns the copyright to Guthrie&#x27;s tune through its Ludlow Music Unit, threatened legal action. JibJab responded with a lawsuit in a California federal court, claiming the song was protected under a fair use exemption for parodies. JibJab and Ludlow Music reached a settlement after JibJab&#x27;s attorneys unearthed evidence that the song had passed into the public domain in 1973. The terms of the settlement allowed for the continued distribution of &quot;This Land&quot;.

===&quot;Good to Be in DC&quot;===
In October 2004, JibJab followed up with another original animation, &quot;Good to Be in DC,&quot; set to the tune of Dan Emmett&#x27;s &quot;Dixie&quot;. In this video, animated versions of George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, John Kerry, and John Edwards sing about their hopes for the upcoming election.

===&quot;Second Term&quot;===
Immediately after George W. Bush&#x27;s election victory, JibJab released a third video, &quot;Second Term.&quot; Set to the tune of &quot;She&#x27;ll Be Coming &#x27;Round the Mountain&quot;, an animated Bush gloats over his successful bid for a second term as president, and his plans for it, based on his campaign promises.

===&quot;Time for Some Campaignin&#x27;&quot;===
For the 2008 presidential election, JibJab released another election-themed animation, &quot;Time for Some Campaignin&#x27;&quot; in July of that year. Set to the tune of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&quot;, animated versions of Bill and Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Barack Obama sing of their presidential hopes, as George W. Bush and Dick Cheney Bid Farewell to the White House. This video was the first instance where viewers had the option of using Jibjab&#x27;s e-card website to insert their own face as that of a harassed voter.

===&quot;He&#x27;s Barack Obama&quot;===
Upon Barack Obama becoming president, JibJab released &quot;He&#x27;s Barack Obama&quot;, where they portrayed Obama as a superhero. The music becomes a heavy metal interpretation of &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot;, as Obama promises he will fix the Middle East, defeat the Taliban, fix the schools, fight a giant space robot, wrestle a bear, fix the deficit and more. This one is notable for having been viewed by 
Obama himself. Stated on the description of its YouTube video: &quot;A Over-the-Top Satire That Debuted In front of the President Himself this Friday At the Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner!&quot;

===2012 election===
For the 2012 United States presidential election, JibJab did not make an election video and instead began to focus their efforts on their e-card business. However, an election web app was released in late October of 2012.

==Year in Review==
Starting in 2005, and for the next nine consecutive years until 2014, JibJab annually released &quot;Year in Review&quot; videos, usually late in December between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day, sung to all various classical melodies. The videos were originally uploaded on YouTube and their website. but on December 11, 2015, JibJab made a Facebook announcement that they would not be releasing anymore &quot;Year in Review&quot; videos as the brothers had begun finding them creatively unfulfilling. By then, ten &quot;Year in Review&quot; videos had been made; by the winter of 2016, JibJab removed all &quot;Year in Review&quot; videos from their website (although they would remain on their YouTube channel) and started to focus on their eCard videos instead. However, on November 24, 2020, in response to popular demand, JibJab uploaded a special &quot;Year In Review&quot; series with a video about 2020, the first to use an original tune.

==Others==
===Big Box Mart===
In 2005, JibJab released the video &quot;Big Box Mart&quot;. Sung to the tune of &quot;Oh, Susannah&quot;, it tells the story of a 53-year-old frequent patron of the titular big-box store, who is enthralled by the store&#x27;s discounts and offers, but soon loses his job as a factory worker, which is outsourced to Beijing, China as a result of the company now selling cheap products to Big Box Mart stores. The man is left no choice but to be employed at his local Big Box Mart for the rest of his life.

===What We Call the News===
Sung to the tune of &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, &quot;What We Call the News&quot; laments the decline of journalism in the cable TV era, particularly sensationalistic stories.

===Founding Fathers Rap===
George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson rap about their accomplishments and end their verse with &quot;We Declare Our independence&quot;. They are accompanied by John Adams and James Madison. Adams is the DJ, and Madison says &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; after every verse.

===Shawshank in a Minute===
This sketch was part (and winner) of a 2006 online competition, The Great Sketch Experiment, held by JibJab and their first live action production. Participants included the comedy duo &quot;Famous Last Nerds&quot; (Jordan Allen-Dutton and Erik Weiner) and John Landis as director. It both summarizes and parodies &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, condensing the plot to a length of nearly three minutes and underlining it with rap music.

===Music videos===
JibJab produced a music video for the 2006 song &quot;Do I Creep You Out?&quot; by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, a parody of Taylor Hicks&#x27; &quot;Do I Make You Proud?&quot;. The video depicts the main character stalking a barista in increasingly disturbing ways, ending with him being arrested and jailed as he publicly professes his emotions in a song. In 2009 JibJab produced another music video for Yankovic for the song &quot;CNR&quot;, which is a style parody of The White Stripes. The video and song portrays Charles Nelson Reilly as a superhuman doing seemingly impossible or improbable things. It also features Yankovic and Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz as Jack White and Meg White respectively.

==E-cards and messaging==
Starting in October 2007, JibJab began its focus on personalized eCards and videos, letting users insert photographs of their faces into humorous birthday cards, holiday greetings and congratulatory notes and send them to other people as e-cards or &quot;sendables&quot;. Initially, this included branded personalized videos, including working with OfficeMax on the video site &quot;Elf Yourself&quot;, where an uploaded photo is put onto a singing and dancing elf, as well as partnerships with &quot;Star Wars&quot; (for the 30th anniversary of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;) and &quot;Mad Men&quot;. A series of eCards were created by Internet personality Dane Boedigheimer (best known for later creating &quot;Annoying Orange&quot;) known as &quot;From the Fridge&quot;, featuring anthropomorphized foods such as eggs, chocolates, avocados, pumpkins, cranberries, and cookies suffering a horrifying torture or death in accordance with their use or consumption for events and holidays such as birthdays, anniversaries, congratulation, Valentine&#x27;s Day, the Super Bowl, Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

Since then, in addition to greeting eCards, JibJab has also extended its personalization technology to popular music videos, including:
* ...Baby One More Time (Britney Spears)
* Friday (Rebecca Black)
* Gangnam Style (Psy)
* Sexy and I Know It (LMFAO)
* Shut Up and Dance (Walk the Moon)
* Addicted to Love (Robert Palmer)
* Roar (Katy Perry)
* Take On Me (A-ha)
* All About That Bass (Meghan Trainor)
* Cake by the Ocean (DNCE)
* Happy (Pharrell Williams)
* Sorry (Justin Bieber)
* Cheap Thrills (Sia)
Since launching its eCard service, more than 100 million people have visited JibJab&#x27;s website annually. In 2014, the company launched a messaging app for personalized animated GIFs, available on both iOS and Android platforms. In 2016, the JibJab app was one of the first mobile apps to be enabled for iMessage and was ranked first among them in download growth. The JibJab app was also featured prominently in Apple&#x27;s annual WWDC product presentation.

==StoryBots==

In 2012, JibJab expanded into the children&#x27;s educational market with its multi-platform learning program, StoryBots. The brand currently includes web-based educational content, as well as two Netflix television series, &quot;Ask the StoryBots&quot; and &quot;StoryBots Super Songs&quot;.

<text>Louis Fraser (1810 – 1866) was a British zoologist and collector. In his early years, Fraser was curator of the Museum of the Zoological Society of London.

Little is known about Fraser&#x27;s early life. He was born in 1810 and married Mary Ann Harrison on 17 February 1844. A son Oscar L. Fraser worked as an assistant in the Indian Museum at Calcutta around 1888. He worked for fourteen years at the museum of the Zoological Society of London. He worked with the anatomist Richard Owen on studies of the emu and rhea. He participated in the Niger expedition of 1841 as the African Civilization Society&#x27;s scientist, with Allen and Thomson. He stayed on in Fernando Po and collected. Upon his return he became in charge of Lord Derby&#x27;s collection at Knowsley Hall. In 1846 he was sent by Lord Derby to collect in north Africa. In 1848 he became conservator at Knowsley. He wrote &quot;Zoologica Typica, or figures of the new and rare animals and birds in the collection of the Zoological Society of London&quot;, a lavishly illustrated large-sized book, published in 1849. In this book he described many new species of birds. In 1850, Fraser was appointed Consul of Quidah, Dahomey (now Benin), West Africa. Around 1857–1859, he collected birds and mammals in Ecuador for Philip Lutley Sclater of the Zoological Society of London, and the year after in California. Upon his return to London, he opened a shop in Regent Street, London, selling exotic birds. The last years of his life he spent in America.

Fraser wrote a &quot;Catalogue of the Knowsley Collections&quot; (1850) and described several new species including the Derbyan parakeet &quot;Psittacula derbiana&quot; named after his employer. A number of species and subspecies have been named in his honour, including Fraser&#x27;s anole (&quot;Anolis fraseri)&quot;, Fraser&#x27;s ground snake (&quot;Liophis epinephelus fraseri)&quot;, a centipede snake (&quot;Tantilla fraseri&quot;, a synonym of &quot;Tantilla melanocephala)&quot;, Fraser&#x27;s eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo poensis&quot;), Fraser&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Myiothlypis fraseri)&quot;, and Fraser&#x27;s musk shrew (&quot;Crocidura poensis&quot;). Died at age 56.

<text>Rickenbacker was a Vintage Era automobile manufactured in Detroit, Michigan, from 1922 until 1927. The car is best known for pioneering production of four-wheel brakes.

==History==

The company was established by Barney Everitt and Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, with Rickenbacker serving as Vice President and Director of Sales. Everitt&#x27;s former partners Walter Flanders and William Metzger were also involved. Rickenbacker used his World War I, 94th Fighter Squadron emblem depicting a top hat inside a ring. The &#x27;Hat in a Ring&#x27; emblems were located both on the front and the back of the cars.

The Rickenbacker was designed by engineers Harry L. Cunningham and E.R. Evans. It had a 3,482cc side-valve six-cylinder engine developing 58-hp, which ran very smoothly due to two flywheels, one at each end of the crankshaft. The first Rickenbackers were displayed at the January 1922 New York Automobile Show. One of the display cars featured experimental four-wheel brakes.

The company made sporting coupés, touring cars, sedans, and roadsters. Four-wheel inside brakes were introduced in 1923. Prices in 1923 ranged from $1,485 for a phaeton to $1,985 () for a sedan. 

Several automobile companies began using four-wheel brakes but some companies not offering them began a promotion campaign suggesting they were unsafe, which probably hurt the new Rickenbacker company&#x27;s sales. The death of Walter Flanders in an automobile accident in 1923 slowed company momentum as well.

In 1924 a coach-brougham enclosed body style was introduced that would grow to represent 60% of Rickenbacker sales. The six-cylinder engines was up-rated to 60-hp and was joined in 1925 by an 4,401cc eight-cylinder engine developing 80-hp. The model was named &quot;Vertical Eight Super Fine&quot; which referred to the advanced proprietary engine and the high quality of the cars.

Eddie Rickenbacker resigned from the company in 1926 due to internal discord in the company&#x27;s leadership. Although 1927 saw new models, designated the &quot;6-70&quot;, &quot;8-80&quot;, and &quot;8-90&quot;, Rickenbacker cars had increased in price and sales were poor. Before the company closed down due to bankruptcy in 1927, more than 27,000 cars had been built.

The manufacturing equipment was sold to Audi and transported to Germany, somewhat ironic since Rickenbacker renounced his supposed German heritage (he was actually of Swiss ancestry) in light of World War I. This transaction was reflected in Audi Zwickau and Dresden models, using six- or eight-cylinder Rickenbacker engines.

<doc id="899850" wikidata="Q503978" url="?curid=899850" title="Silver-washed fritillary">
<text>The silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia) is a common and variable butterfly found over much of the Palearctic realm – Algeria, Europe and across the Palearctic to Japan.

==Description==
The silver-washed fritillary butterfly is deep orange with black spots on the upperside of its wings. It has a wingspan of 54–70 mm, with the male&#x27;s being smaller and paler than the female&#x27;s. The underside is green (verdigris) with a metallic gloss and broad silver bands which are partly curved, hence the name silver-washed. In the male the forewings are rather pointed whereas in the female they are more rounded. On females of the minority &quot;valesina&quot; form, recurrent in most European populations, the ground color is not fawn but grey with greenish reflections. The caterpillar is black brown with two yellow lines along its back and long reddish-brown spines.

The male possesses scent scales on the upperside of the forewing that run along veins one to four as three distinct scent-streaks. The scent produced from these scales attracts females and helps to distinguish it from other species.

==Food resources==
Adults feed on the nectar of bramble, thistles, and knapweeds, and also on aphid honeydew. The silver-washed is a strong flier, and more mobile than other fritillaries, and, as such, can be seen gliding above the tree canopy at high speed. Its preferred habitat is thin, sunny, deciduous woodland, especially oaks, but it has been known to live in coniferous woodland.

The main larval food plant of the species is the common dog violet (&quot;Viola riviniana&quot;).
==Life cycle==
Unusually for a butterfly, the female does not lay her eggs on the leaves or stem of the caterpillar&#x27;s food source (in this case violets), but instead one or two meters above the woodland floor in the crevices of tree bark close to clumps of violets.

When the egg hatches in August, the caterpillar immediately goes into hibernation until spring. Upon awakening, it will drop to the ground, and feeds on violets close to the base of the tree. The caterpillar usually feeds at night, and usually conceals itself during the day away from its food source, but during cool weather will bask in the sunny spots on the forest floor on dry, dead leaves. It will pupate amongst the ground vegetation, and the adults will emerge in June.

Seitz— The conical, ribbed, yellowish grey eggs are deposited on tree-trunks, particularly pines; the female commences about 4 or 5 ft. above the ground and with a few flappings of the wing flies higher up, depositing an egg at intervalls of 1/2 to 1 m, flying around the tree in a kind of spiral. When reaching a height of about 4 m it leaves the tree in order to begin again in the same way on another one. The larva lives from August until the end of May on Violaceae, hibernating very small (Gillmer) and beginning to feed already in March.It is blackish brown, with a broad yellow dorsal stripe divided by a thin black line, and with numerous yellow dots, spots and streaks on the sides; the spines long, yellow at the base, the two anterior ones curved and prolonged, resembling antennae. The pupa is usually fastened low down on a pine-trunk; it is greyish brown, with pointed processes on the head and sharp angles, and has conical pointed tubercles, which are at first silvery and become golden before the emergence of the butterfly. The species is on the wing in Europe from July till September, in Eastern Asia til October; it is very common everywhere and flies particularly on broad roads in the forest and at the edges of woods. The butterflies visit especially the flowers of brambles, scabious and thistles, on which they can easily be caught. When desirous to mate the male circles around the female, while the latter is flying with even flappings of the wings straight for a bush or a projecting branch. Here copulation takes place, the sexes being often so strongly united that they remain together for some time, frequently the one individual carrying the other about.

<text>Euclid of Megara (; ; c. 435 – c. 365 BC) was a Greek Socratic philosopher who founded the Megarian school of philosophy. He was a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC, and was present at his death. He held the supreme good to be one, eternal and unchangeable, and denied the existence of anything contrary to the good. Editors and translators in the Middle Ages often confused him with Euclid of Alexandria when discussing the latter&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;.

==Life==
Euclid was born in Megara. In Athens he became a follower of Socrates: so eager was he to hear the teaching and discourse of Socrates, that when, for a time, Athens had a ban on any citizen of Megara entering the city, Euclid would sneak into Athens after nightfall disguised as a woman, to hear him speak. He is represented in the preface of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Theaetetus&quot; as being responsible for writing down the conversation between Socrates and the young Theaetetus many years earlier. Socrates is also supposed to have reproved Euclid for his fondness for eristic disputes. He was present at Socrates&#x27; death (399 BCE), after which Euclid returned to Megara, where he offered refuge to Plato and other frightened pupils of Socrates.

In Megara, Euclid founded a school of philosophy which became known as the Megarian school, and which flourished for about a century. Euclid&#x27;s pupils were said to have been Ichthyas, the second leader of the Megarian school; Eubulides of Miletus; Clinomachus; and Thrasymachus of Corinth. Thrasymachus was a teacher of Stilpo, who was the teacher of Zeno of Citium, the founder of the Stoic school.

==Philosophy==

Euclid himself wrote six dialogues—the &quot;Lamprias&quot;, the &quot;Aeschines&quot;, the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, the &quot;Crito&quot;, the &quot;Alcibiades&quot;, and the &quot;Amatory&quot; dialogue—but none survive. According to its prologue, the ostensibly Platonic dialogue &quot;Theaetetus&quot; was originally a Euclidean work. The main extant source on his views is the brief summary by Diogenes Laërtius. Euclid&#x27;s philosophy was a synthesis of Eleatic and Socratic ideas. Socrates claimed that the greatest knowledge was understanding the good. The Eleatics claimed the greatest knowledge is the one universal being of the world. Mixing these two ideas, Euclid claimed that good is the knowledge of this being. Therefore, this good is the only thing that exists and has many names but is really just one thing. He identified the Eleatic idea of &quot;The One&quot; with the Socratic &quot;Form of the Good&quot;, which he called &quot;Reason&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;Mind&quot;, &quot;Wisdom&quot;, etc. This was the true essence of being, and was eternal and unchangeable. The idea of a universal good also allowed Euclid to dismiss all that is not good because he claimed that good covered all things on Earth with its many names. Euclid adopted the Socratic idea that knowledge is virtue and that the only way to understand the never-changing world is through the study of philosophy. Euclid taught that virtues themselves, however, were simply the knowledge of the one good, or being. As he said, &quot;The Good is One, but we can call it by several names, sometimes as wisdom, sometimes as God, sometimes as Reason&quot;, and he declared, &quot;the opposite of Good does not exist.&quot;

Euclid was also interested in concepts and dilemmas of logic. Euclid and his Megarian followers used dialogue and the eristic method to defend their ideas. The eristic method allowed them to prove their ideas by disproving those of the one they were arguing with and therefore indirectly proving one&#x27;s own point (&quot;see reductio ad absurdum&quot;). When attacking a demonstration, it was not the premises assumed but the conclusions that he attacked, which presumably means that he tried to refute his opponents by drawing absurd consequences from their conclusions. He also rejected argument from analogy. His doctrinal heirs, the Stoic logicians, inaugurated the most important school of logic in antiquity other than Aristotle&#x27;s peripatetics.

<doc id="899855" wikidata="Q2540394" url="?curid=899855" title="Fyrisvellir">
<text>Fyrisvellir, Fyris Wolds, or Fyrisvallarna, was the marshy plain (&quot;vellir&quot;) south of Gamla Uppsala where travellers had to leave the ships on the river Fyris (Fyrisån) and walk to the Temple at Uppsala and the hall of the Swedish king.

== Entomology ==
The name is related to, or derived from, Old Norse &quot;Fyrva&quot; which meant &quot;to ebb&quot; and it referred to the partially inundated soggy plains that today are dry farmland and the modern town of Uppsala. In mediaeval times, a royal estate called &quot;Førisæng&quot;, &quot;Fyris meadow&quot;, was located near this field. The small lakes &quot;Övre Föret&quot;, &quot;the Upper Fyri&quot;, and &quot;Nedre Föret&quot;, &quot;the Lower Fyri&quot;, are remains of this marsh and retain a modern form of &quot;Fyri&quot; (the -&quot;t&quot; suffix is the definite article, which lake names always take in Swedish). The field went alongside what was renamed the &quot;Fyris river&quot; (Fyrisån) in the 17th century to make the connection between the river and the Sagas more obvious.

== Mythology ==
In Scandinavian mythology, the battle between Haki and Hugleik took place on these wolds, as well as that between Haki and Jorund. It was also the location of the Battle of the Fýrisvellir between Eric the Victorious and his nephew Styrbjörn the Strong, in the 980s.

According to a story about Hrólf Kraki found in many texts, Hrólf spread gold on this plain as he and his men were fleeing the Swedish king Adils. The king&#x27;s men then dismounted to collect the gold. In Skaldic poetry, gold was often referred to with the kenning &quot;the seed of the Fyris Wolds&quot;.

<doc id="899859" wikidata="Q2765501" url="?curid=899859" title="Barbodhan">
<text>Barbodhan is a village in the Surat District of western India, on the north bank of the River Tapti. It comes within the jurisdiction of the Olpad Taluka.

==Etymology==
According to local folklore, the name Barbodhan comes from the Arabic &quot;Bāb&quot; &quot;Aden&quot; or &quot;Gateway to Aden&quot;. It is known that at one time Muslims travelling to Mecca on pilgrimage would pass through this village on their way to the seaport of Surat, hence the name. Some sources suggest that the village was named after the Portuguese factor and traveller Duarte Barbosa, though this seems unlikely as he never actually resided in the area. More recently though the village Barbodhan has become known as the &#x27;Golden Village&#x27;. The village has existed for many years, and tombstones in the graveyard indicate that Muslims were buried there some three to four hundred years ago. According to one source the first Indian Muslims to settle here were several brothers with the surname Rawat, who came from Nasirpoor Bhatti, a place near Navsari.

==The Diaspora of Barbodhanis==
Barbodhanis have always interested in trade and commerce and travelled to foreign lands, undertaking long sea voyages. People left Barbodhan in the early 19th century to settle in Burma, where they established many businesses and were great entrepreneurs; a number of them even became advisors to the Burmese rulers. Then from in the 1840s many other emigrants from Barbodhan went to the island of Mauritius, where they were later responsible for introducing hydroelectric power, as well as being involved in other trading and business concerns. The first Muslim mayor in Mauritius was originally from Barbodhan.

Then came the migration to England from the 1950s to the 1970s. Once immigration to the United Kingdom became more difficult, a number of Barbodhians then left for Canada particularly during the period from the 1970s to the 1990s. A considerable number of Barbodhians undertook further migrations from one of these countries to another; such as from Burma to England, England to Canada or Mauritius to England. Despite the fact that Barbodhan is only a small village, its people have made valuable contributions in societies around the world. Barbodhians have set up many Waqfs or Religious Foundations to help poor, needy, disadvantaged and unfortunate members of society, particularly in Burma and Mauritius.

The largest population of Barbodhians outside India is in Bolton, Greater Manchester, where the community settled in the 1950s and 1960s. The first ever Elected Member on Bolton Council of Indian origin was from Barbodhan. There is also a large number of settlers from Barbodhan in Preston, also in Lancashire, where the Barbodhan Muslim Welfare Society (UK) was set as early as 1960.

There are currently two mosques, two temples, one madressa, one school and one library in the village. There is a large pond in the village of Barbodhan which is the biggest pond in the Olpad Taluka. It covers an area of around 999 vigha (250 acres/101.17 hectares).

==Demographics==
All the Muslim population residing in the village are classed as Surti Sunni Vohra Muslims, or Surti Muslims following the Deobandi Tablighi Jamaat Movement.

Some common surnames attributed to the village are (Atcha/Atchia/ATTCHA), ADIYA/Adia, NALLA, MULLA, KALLA (KALA), NANA, Ghanchi, PATEL,/Esa/ISA, Rawat, RAJA, JEEWA//JIVA), JINA, Makda, ABU, and ... live other villagers LIMALIYA (KAWAS), Attan (KOSAD), AHEMEDJI), NANI NAROLI, sushiwala (surat) gangat, Shah, Shaikh, Gulzar, Rajjab etc..

A number of Hindu families have settled in the UK particularly in Preston from Kenya

<doc id="899864" wikidata="Q1355516" url="?curid=899864" title="People's Olympiad">
<text>The People&#x27;s Olympiad (Catalan: &quot;Olimpíada Popular&quot;, Spanish: &quot;Olimpiada Popular&quot;) was a planned international multi-sport event that was intended to take place in 1936 in Barcelona, Catalonia within the Spanish Republic. It was conceived as a protest event against the 1936 Summer Olympics being held in Berlin, which was then under control of the Nazi Party.

Despite gaining support from some athletes, and most significantly the Soviet Union and the Communist International organization, the People&#x27;s Olympiad was never held, as a result of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Fifty-six years later, Barcelona hosted the 1992 Summer Olympics.

The People&#x27;s Olympiad was the first ever global attempt to boycott a modern Olympics.

==Background==

In 1931, the International Olympic Committee had selected Berlin, then the capital of the Weimar Republic, to host the 1936 Summer Olympics at the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona. Berlin had defeated Barcelona, which was also vying to host the games, by 43 votes to 16. During the same year, Spain had adopted a republican constitution, with King Alfonso XIII going into exile, and Catalonia was recognized as an autonomous region within the Spanish Republic.

Following the 1936 general election in Spain, the Catalonia&#x27;s pro-People&#x27;s Sports Committee (Catalan: &quot;Comitè Català pro-Esport Popular&quot;, CCPEP), supported by the Government of Catalonia, as well as by the newly elected Spanish Popular Front government, advocated for the boycott of Spain to the Berlin Olympics in Nazi Germany and the organization of an alternative games in Barcelona. Invitations were made to many countries, and it was planned to use the hotels built for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition as an Olympic-style Village. The games were scheduled to be held from July 19 to 26 and would have therefore ended six days prior to the start of the Berlin games. In addition to the usual sporting events, the Barcelona games would also have featured chess, folkdancing, music and theatre.

==Participants==
A total of 6,000 athletes from 49 nations registered for the games. The largest contingents of athletes came from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and French Algeria. There were also teams from Germany and Italy made up of political exiles from those countries. Teams representing Jewish exiles, Alsace, Catalonia (the host), Galicia, and the Basque Country also registered. The Soviet Union, under the rule of Joseph Stalin, had been holding its own version of the Olympics, known as the Spartakiad, organised by Red Sport International. Despite this, the Soviets agreed to attend the Barcelona competition.

Many of the athletes were sent by trade unions, workers&#x27; clubs and associations, socialist and communist parties, and left-wing groups, rather than by state-sponsored committees.

== Opening ceremony, lodging and competition ==

The proposed opening ceremony of the Olympiad included the parades of exiled Jews from Europe, as well as of people from North Africa under colonization, representing state and stateless nations. A song composed by Hanns Eisler, an exiled left-wing German Jew whose lyrics would be written by Josep Maria de Sagarra, a Catalan poet, would play in the background of the ceremony. Women would be allowed to compete at more games than the International Olympic Committee did at the time, in Berlin.

There was no Olympic Village-like complex available due to the time shortness – of three months – to plan the Olympiad. As a result of that, athletes first had to stay in hotels and hostels and then in the reassigned &quot;Hotel Olympic&quot;. Unforeseen greater visiting audiences for the games forced the Catalan government to try and to find more lodging for athletes in a rush.

With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War just as the games were to begin, the alternate games were hastily cancelled. Some athletes never made it to Barcelona as the borders had been closed, while many who were in the city for the beginning of the games made a hasty exit. However, at least 200 of the athletes, such as Clara Thalmann, remained in Spain and joined workers&#x27; militias that were organized to defend the Second Spanish Republic against the nationalists.

<doc id="899870" wikidata="Q117783" url="?curid=899870" title="Hugo Claus">
<text>Hugo Maurice Julien Claus (; 5 April 1929 – 19 March 2008) was a leading Belgian author who published under his own name as well as various pseudonyms. Claus&#x27; literary contributions spanned the genres of drama, novels, and poetry; he also left a legacy as a painter and film director. He wrote primarily in Dutch, although he also wrote some poetry in English. He won the 2000 International Nonino Prize in Italy.

His death by euthanasia, which is legal in Belgium, led to considerable controversy.

==Life==
Hugo Claus was born on 5 April 1929 at Sint-Janshospitaal in Bruges, Belgium. He was the eldest of four sons born to Jozef Claus and Germaine Vanderlinden. Jozef worked as a printer but was also fond of theatre.

Hugo was educated at a boarding school led by nuns in Aalbeke and experienced the German occupation of Belgium during World War II. The experience was formative, and would later be adapted by Claus into his semi-autobiographical &quot;The Sorrow of Belgium&quot; (1983). Many of Claus&#x27; teachers were Flemish nationalists who were sympathetic to fascism, and Claus joined the pro-German youth wing of the Flemish National Union. His father was also briefly detained after the Liberation for collaborationism. A sympathizer of the political left at a more mature period in his life, Claus lauded the socialist model after a visit to Cuba in the 1960s.

Claus&#x27; prominence in literary circles and his debut as a novelist came in 1950, with the publication of his &quot;De Metsiers&quot; at age twenty-one. His first published poems had in fact been printed by his father as early as 1947. He lived in Paris from 1950 until 1952, where he met many of the members of the CoBrA art movement.

From February 1953 until the beginning of 1955, Hugo Claus lived in Italy where his girlfriend (born in 1928) acted in a few films. They were married on 26 May 1955, and had a son, Thomas, on 7 October 1963. 

In the early 1970s, he had an affair with actress Sylvia Kristel, who was 23 years younger, with whom he had a son, Arthur, in 1975. They lived in the Raamgracht 5–7 building in Amsterdam. The relationship ended in 1977, when she left him for actor Ian McShane.

He was a &quot;contrarian&quot;, of &quot;anarchist spirit&quot;. Journalist Guy Duplat recalls that Claus had organized in Knokke the election of a &quot;Miss Knokke Festival&quot;, which was a typical beauty contest, except for the Claus ruling that the members of the all-male jury would have to be naked.

===Literary career===

Hugo Claus was considered to be one of the most important contemporary Belgian authors. Claus published the novel &quot;Schola Nostra&quot; (1971) under the pseudonym Dorothea Van Male. He also used the pseudonyms Jan Hyoens and Thea Streiner. The 1962 &quot;De verwondering&quot; (&quot;The Astonishment&quot;) and the 1983 &quot;Het verdriet van België&quot; (&quot;The Sorrow of Belgium&quot;) rank among Claus&#x27; most significant works as a novelist. Lee views &quot;Het verdriet van België&quot; as a postmodern critique of national identity.

Most prolific in literary endeavours as a dramatist, Claus wrote 35 original pieces and 31 translations from English, Greek, Latin, French and Spanish plays and novels. His dramatic sketch &quot;Masscheroen&quot; was first staged at Knokke Casino and featured an all-nude cast: three naked men were given the task of portraying the Christian Holy Trinity of God the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit; the work also made light of the Holy Virgin, a Belgian saint, and the Three Wise Men. Attacked as blasphemous and deleterious to the public&#x27;s moral well-being, the light-hearted play&#x27;s performance triggered a notable legal case in which Claus was prosecuted: convicted on charges of public indecency, Claus was ordered to pay a ten-thousand-Belgian franc fine and serve a four-month prison sentence. The prison term was reduced to a suspended sentence after a public outcry.

Claus also wrote the script of a satirical comic strip, &quot;De Avonturen van Belgman&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of Belgian Man&quot;) in 1967, which spoofed the Belgian bi-lingual troubles. The strip itself was drawn by artist &quot;Hugoké&quot; (Hugo de Kempeneer). In 1985, Claus also wrote a series of satirical poems about Pope John Paul II&#x27;s upcoming visit to Belgium that year, titled &quot;Een Weerzinwekkend Bezoek&quot;. The poems were illustrated with cartoons by GAL. 

Hugo Claus&#x27; name had been put forward many times for the Nobel Prize in Literature, on which he would casually comment &quot;this prize money would suit me fine&quot;.

===Painting and film===
As a painter, Claus was a participant in the CoBrA art movement from 1950. He had developed friendships with some of its members and illustrated a book by Pierre Alechinsky in 1949. He collaborated with key figures in the movement including Karel Appel and Corneille and participated in some exhibitions. He later used his experiences of this time in his book &quot;Een zachte vernieling&quot; (&quot;Mild Destruction&quot;).

Claus directed seven films between 1964 and 2001. His film &quot;Het sacrament&quot; was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.

===Death===
Claus suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and requested his life to be terminated through euthanasia, a legal procedure in Belgium, at the Middelheim Hospital in Antwerp on 19 March 2008.

Bert Anciaux, then Flemish Minister of Culture, stated &quot;I knew him well enough to know that he wanted to depart with pride and dignity.&quot; Former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said that he imagined the onset of Alzheimer&#x27;s must have been &quot;inevitable and unbearable torture&quot;. &quot;I can live with the fact that he decided thus,&quot; he said, &quot;because he left us as a great glowing star, right on time, just before he would have collapsed into a Stellar black hole.&quot;

His death by euthanasia has received criticism from the Roman Catholic Church and the Belgian Alzheimer League. The Roman Catholic Church criticized the media coverage; Belgian Cardinal Godfried Danneels referred to Claus&#x27; euthanasia in his Easter Homily. The Belgian Alzheimer League respects Claus&#x27; decision, but believes the media coverage of his death neglects other options for Alzheimer&#x27;s patients.

<text>Sea surface temperature (or ocean surface temperature) is the temperature of ocean water close to the surface. The exact meaning of &quot;surface&quot; varies in the literature and in practice. It is usually between and below the sea surface. Sea surface temperatures greatly modify air masses in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere within a short distance of the shore. The thermohaline circulation has a major impact on average sea surface temperature throughout most of the world&#x27;s oceans. 

Warm sea surface temperatures can develop and strengthen cyclones over the ocean. Tropical cyclones can also cause a cool wake. This is due to turbulent mixing of the upper of the ocean. Sea surface temperature changes during the day. This is like the air above it, but to a lesser degree. There is less variation in sea surface temperature on breezy days than on calm days. 

Coastal sea surface temperatures can cause offshore winds to generate upwelling, which can significantly cool or warm nearby landmasses, but shallower waters over a continental shelf are often warmer. Onshore winds can cause a considerable warm-up even in areas where upwelling is fairly constant, such as the northwest coast of South America. Its values are important within numerical weather prediction as the sea surface temperature influences the atmosphere above, such as in the formation of sea breezes and sea fog. 

It is very likely that global mean sea surface temperature increased by 0.88 °C between 1850–1900 and 2011–2020 due to global warming, with most of that warming (0.60 °C) occurring between 1980 and 2020. The temperatures over land are rising faster than ocean temperatures. This is because the ocean absorbs about 90% of excess heat generated by climate change.

==Definitions==
Sea surface temperature (SST), or ocean surface temperature, is the water temperature close to the ocean&#x27;s surface. The exact meaning of &quot;surface&quot; varies according to the measurement method used, but it is between and below the sea surface. 

For comparison, the sea surface skin temperature relates to the top 20 or so micrometres of the ocean&#x27;s surface.

The definition proposed by IPCC for &quot;sea surface temperature&quot; does not specify the number of metres but focuses more on measurement techniques: Sea surface temperature is &quot;the subsurface bulk temperature in the top few metres of the ocean, measured by ships, buoys and drifters. [...] Satellite measurements of skin temperature (uppermost layer; a micrometre thick) in the infrared or the top centimetre or so in the microwave are also used, but must be adjusted to be compatible with the bulk temperature.&quot; 

The temperature further below that is called &quot;ocean temperature&quot; or &quot;deeper ocean temperature&quot;. Ocean temperatures (more than 20 metres below the surface) also vary by region and time, and they contribute to variations in ocean heat content and ocean stratification. The increase of both ocean surface temperature and deeper ocean temperature is an important effect of climate change on oceans.

=== Extent of &quot;surface&quot; ===

The extent of the &quot;ocean surface&quot; down into the ocean is influenced by the amount of mixing that takes place between the surface water and the deeper water. This depends on the temperature: in the tropics the warm surface layer of about 100 m is quite stable and does not mix much with deeper water, while near the poles winter cooling and storms makes the surface layer denser and it mixes to great depth and then stratifies again in summer. This is why there is no simple single depth for &quot;ocean surface&quot;. The photic depth of the ocean is typically about 100 m and is related to this heated surface layer. It can be up to around 200 m deep in the open ocean.

==Variations and changes==

===Local variations===

The sea surface temperature (SST) has a diurnal range, just like the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere above, though to a lesser degree due to its greater thermal inertia. On calm days, the temperature can vary by . The temperature of the ocean at depth lags the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere temperature by 15 days per , which means for locations like the Aral Sea, temperatures near its bottom reach a maximum in December and a minimum in May and June. Near the coastline, some offshore and longshore winds move the warm waters near the surface offshore, and replace them with cooler water from below in the process known as Ekman transport. This pattern generally increases nutrients for marine life in the region, and can have a profound effect in some regions where the bottom waters are particularly nutrient-rich. Offshore of river deltas, freshwater flows over the top of the denser seawater, which allows it to heat faster due to limited vertical mixing. Remotely sensed SST can be used to detect the surface temperature signature due to tropical cyclones. In general, an SST cooling is observed after the passing of a hurricane, primarily as the result of mixed layer deepening and surface heat losses. In the wake of several day long Saharan dust outbreaks across the adjacent northern Atlantic Ocean, sea surface temperatures are reduced 0.2 C to 0.4 C (0.3 to 0.7 F). Other sources of short-term SST fluctuation include extratropical cyclones, rapid influxes of glacial fresh water and concentrated phytoplankton blooms due to seasonal cycles or agricultural run-off.

The tropical ocean has been warming faster than other regions since 1950, with the greatest rates of warming in the tropical Indian Ocean, western Pacific Ocean, and western boundary currents of the subtropical gyres. However, the eastern Pacific Ocean, subtropical North Atlantic Ocean, and Southern Ocean have warmed more slowly than the global average or have experienced cooling since the 1950s.

====Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation====
Ocean currents, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, can affect sea surface temperatures over several decades. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is an important driver of North Atlantic SST and Northern Hemisphere climate, but the mechanisms controlling AMO variability remain poorly understood. Atmospheric internal variability, changes in ocean circulation, or anthropogenic drivers may control the multidecadal temperature variability associated with AMO. These changes in North Atlantic SST may influence winds in the subtropical North Pacific and produce warmer SSTs in the western Pacific Ocean.

===Regional variations===
El Niño is defined by prolonged differences in Pacific Ocean surface temperatures when compared with the average value. The accepted definition is a warming or cooling of at least 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) averaged over the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean. Typically, this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of 2–7 years and lasts nine months to two years. The average period length is 5 years. When this warming or cooling occurs for only seven to nine months, it is classified as El Niño/La Niña &quot;conditions&quot;; when it occurs for more than that period, it is classified as El Niño/La Niña &quot;episodes&quot;.

The sign of an El Niño in the sea surface temperature pattern is when warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the east Pacific. It takes the rain with it, causing extensive drought in the western Pacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern Pacific. El Niño&#x27;s warm rush of nutrient-poor tropical water, heated by its eastward passage in the Equatorial Current, replaces the cold, nutrient-rich surface water of the Humboldt Current. When El Niño conditions last for many months, extensive ocean warming and the reduction in Easterly Trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient-rich deep water and its economic impact to local fishing for an international market can be serious.

Among scientists, there is medium confidence that the tropical Pacific will transition to a mean pattern resembling that of El Niño on centennial time scale, but there is still high uncertainty in tropical Pacific SST projections because it is difficult to capture El Niño variability in climate models.

=== Recent increase due to climate change ===
Overall, scientists project that all regions of the oceans will warm by 2050, but models disagree for SST changes expected in the subpolar North Atlantic, the equatorial Pacific, and the Southern Ocean. The future global mean SST increase for the period 1995-2014 to 2081-2100 is 0.86 °C under the most modest greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, and up to 2.89 °C under the most severe emissions scenarios.

A study published in 2025 in &quot;Environmental Research Letters&quot; reported that global mean sea surface temperature increases had more than quadrupled, from 0.06K per decade during 1985–89 to 0.27K per decade for 2019–23. The researchers projected that the increase inferred over the past 40 years would likely be exceeded within the next 20 years.

==Measurement==

There are a variety of techniques for measuring this parameter that can potentially yield different results because different things are actually being measured. Away from the immediate sea surface, general temperature measurements are accompanied by a reference to the specific depth of measurement. This is because of significant differences encountered between measurements made at different depths, especially during the daytime when low wind speed and high sunshine conditions may lead to the formation of a warm layer at the ocean&#x27;s surface and strong vertical temperature gradients (a diurnal thermocline). Sea surface temperature measurements are confined to the top portion of the ocean, known as the near-surface layer.

===Thermometers===
The sea surface temperature was one of the first oceanographic variables to be measured. Benjamin Franklin suspended a mercury thermometer from a ship while travelling between the United States and Europe in his survey of the Gulf Stream in the late eighteenth century. SST was later measured by dipping a thermometer into a bucket of water that was manually drawn from the sea surface. The first automated technique for determining SST was accomplished by measuring the temperature of water in the intake port of large ships, which was underway by 1963. These observations have a warm bias of around due to the heat of the engine room. 

Fixed weather buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of . Measurements of SST have had inconsistencies over the last 130 years due to the way they were taken. In the nineteenth century, measurements were taken in a bucket off a ship. However, there was a slight variation in temperature because of the differences in buckets. Samples were collected in either a wood or an uninsulated canvas bucket, but the canvas bucket cooled quicker than the wood bucket. The sudden change in temperature between 1940 and 1941 was the result of an undocumented change in procedure. The samples were taken near the engine intake because it was too dangerous to use lights to take measurements over the side of the ship at night. 

Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design, and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies. These measurements are beamed to satellites for automated and immediate data distribution. A large network of coastal buoys in U.S. waters is maintained by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). Between 1985 and 1994, an extensive array of moored and drifting buoys was deployed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean designed to help monitor and predict the El Niño phenomenon.

===Weather satellites===
Weather satellites have been available to determine sea surface temperature information since 1967, with the first global composites created during 1970. Since 1982, satellites have been increasingly utilized to measure SST and have allowed its spatial and temporal variation to be viewed more fully. Satellite measurements of SST are in reasonable agreement with in situ temperature measurements. The satellite measurement is made by sensing the ocean radiation in two or more wavelengths within the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum or other parts of the spectrum which can then be empirically related to SST. These wavelengths are chosen because they are:

# within the peak of the blackbody radiation expected from the Earth, and
# able to transmit adequately well through the atmosphere

The satellite-measured SST provides both a synoptic view of the ocean and a high frequency of repeat views, allowing the examination of basin-wide upper ocean dynamics not possible with ships or buoys. NASA&#x27;s (National Aeronautic and Space Administration) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST satellites have been providing global SST data since 2000, available with a one-day lag. NOAA&#x27;s GOES (Geostationary Orbiting Earth Satellites) satellites are geo-stationary above the Western Hemisphere which enables them to deliver SST data on an hourly basis with only a few hours of lag time.

There are several difficulties with satellite-based absolute SST measurements. First, in infrared remote sensing methodology the radiation emanates from the top &quot;skin&quot; of the ocean, approximately the top 0.01 mm or less, which may not represent the bulk temperature of the upper meter of ocean due primarily to effects of solar surface heating during the daytime, reflected radiation, as well as sensible heat loss and surface evaporation. All these factors make it somewhat difficult to compare satellite data to measurements from buoys or shipboard methods, complicating ground truth efforts. Secondly, the satellite cannot look through clouds, creating a cool bias in satellite-derived SSTs within cloudy areas. However, passive microwave techniques can accurately measure SST and penetrate cloud cover. Within atmospheric sounder channels on weather satellites, which peak just above the ocean&#x27;s surface, knowledge of the sea surface temperature is important to their calibration.

==Importance to the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere==

Sea surface temperature affects the behavior of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere above, so their initialization into atmospheric models is important. While sea surface temperature is important for tropical cyclogenesis, it is also important in determining the formation of sea fog and sea breezes. Heat from underlying warmer waters can significantly modify an air mass over distances as short as to . For example, southwest of Northern Hemisphere extratropical cyclones, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow lake-effect snow (or sea effect) bands. Those bands bring strong localized precipitation, often in the form of snow, since large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences—larger than —between the water surface and the air above. Because of this temperature difference, warmth and moisture are transported upward, condensing into vertically oriented clouds which produce snow showers. The temperature decrease with height and cloud depth are directly affected by both the water temperature and the large-scale environment. The stronger the temperature decrease with height, the taller the clouds get, and the greater the precipitation rate becomes.

===Tropical cyclones===

Ocean temperature of at least 26.5°C (79.7°F) spanning through at minimum a 50-metre depth is one of the precursors needed to maintain a tropical cyclone (a type of mesocyclone). These warm waters are needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems. This value is well above 16.1 °C (60.9 °F), the long term global average surface temperature of the oceans. However, this requirement can be considered only a general baseline because it assumes that the ambient atmospheric environment surrounding an area of disturbed weather presents average conditions. Tropical cyclones have intensified when SSTs were slightly below this standard temperature.

Tropical cyclones are known to form even when normal conditions are not met. For example, cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude (e.g., at the 500 hPa level, or 5.9 km) can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures, as a certain lapse rate is required to force the atmosphere to be unstable enough for convection. In a moist atmosphere, this lapse rate is 6.5 °C/km, while in an atmosphere with less than 100% relative humidity, the required lapse rate is 9.8 °C/km.

At the 500 hPa level, the air temperature averages −7 °C (18 °F) within the tropics, but air in the tropics is normally dry at this height, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wet-bulb temperature at 500 hPa in a tropical atmosphere of is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is , and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1 °C in the sea surface temperature for each 1 °C change at 500 hpa.
Inside a cold cyclone, 500 hPa temperatures can fall as low as , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500 hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500 hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was −77 °C (−132 °F). One example of a tropical cyclone maintaining itself over cooler waters was Epsilon late in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.

<text>Implicate order and explicate order are ontological concepts for quantum theory coined by theoretical physicist David Bohm during the early 1980s. They are used to describe two different frameworks for understanding the same phenomenon or aspect of reality. In particular, the concepts were developed in order to explain the bizarre behaviors of subatomic particles which quantum physics describes and predicts with elegant precision but struggles to explain.

In Bohm&#x27;s &quot;Wholeness and the Implicate Order&quot;, he used these notions to describe how the appearance of such phenomena might appear differently, or might be characterized by, varying principal factors, depending on contexts such as scales. The implicate (also referred to as the &quot;enfolded&quot;) order is seen as a deeper and more fundamental order of reality. In contrast, the explicate or &quot;unfolded&quot; order includes the abstractions that humans normally perceive. As he wrote:

:In the enfolded [or implicate] order, space and time are no longer the dominant factors determining the relationships of dependence or independence of different elements. Rather, an entirely different sort of basic connection of elements is possible, from which our ordinary notions of space and time, along with those of separately existent material particles, are abstracted as forms derived from the deeper order. These ordinary notions in fact appear in what is called the &quot;explicate&quot; or &quot;unfolded&quot; order, which is a special and distinguished form contained within the general totality of all the implicate orders ().

== Overview ==
The notion of implicate and explicate orders emphasizes the primacy of structure and process over individual objects. The latter are seen as mere approximations of an underlying process. In this approach, quantum particles and other objects are understood to have only a limited degree of stability and autonomy.

Bohm believed that the weirdness of the behavior of quantum particles is caused by unobserved forces, maintaining that space and time might actually be derived from an even deeper level of objective reality. In the words of F. David Peat, Bohm considered that what we take for reality are &quot;surface phenomena, explicate forms that have temporarily unfolded out of an underlying implicate order.&quot; That is, the implicate order is the ground from which reality emerges.

=== The implicate order as an algebra ===
Bohm, his co-worker Basil Hiley, and other physicists of Birkbeck College worked toward a model of quantum physics in which the implicate order is represented in the form of an appropriate algebra or other pregeometry. They considered spacetime itself as part of an explicate order that is connected to an implicate order that they called &quot;pre-space.&quot; The spacetime manifold and the properties of locality and nonlocality all arise from an order in such pre-space. A. M. Frescura and Hiley suggested that an implicate order could be carried by an algebra, with the explicate order being contained in the various representations of this algebra.

In analogy to Alfred North Whitehead&#x27;s notion of &quot;actual occasion,&quot; Bohm considered the notion of &quot;moment&quot; – a moment being a not entirely localizable event, with events being allowed to overlap  and being connected in an overall implicate order:

Bohm emphasized the primary role of the implicate order&#x27;s structure:

=== The explicate order and quantum entanglement ===
Central to Bohm&#x27;s schema are correlations between observables of entities which seem separated by great distances in the explicate order (such as a particular electron here on Earth and an alpha particle in one of the stars in the Abell 1835 galaxy, then a possible candidate for farthest galaxy from Earth known to humans), manifestations of the implicate order. Within quantum theory, there is entanglement of such objects.

This view of order necessarily departs from any notion which entails signalling, and therefore causality. The correlation of observables does not imply a causal influence, and in Bohm&#x27;s schema, the latter represents &#x27;relatively&#x27; independent events in spacetime; and therefore explicate order.

=== A common grounding for consciousness and matter ===
The implicate order represents the proposal of a general metaphysical concept in terms of which it is claimed that matter and consciousness might both be understood, in the sense that it is proposed that both matter and consciousness: (i) enfold the structure of the whole within each region, and (ii) involve continuous processes of enfoldment and unfoldment. For example, in the case of matter, entities such as atoms may represent continuous enfoldment and unfoldment which manifests as a relatively stable and autonomous entity that can be observed to follow a relatively well-defined path in spacetime. In the case of consciousness, Bohm pointed toward evidence presented by Karl Pribram that memories may be enfolded within every region of the brain rather than being localized (for example, in particular regions of the brain, cells, or atoms).

Bohm went on to say: As in our discussion of matter in general, it is now necessary to go into the question of how in consciousness the explicate order is what is manifest ... the manifest content of consciousness is based essentially on memory, which is what allows such content to be held in a fairly constant form. Of course, to make possible such constancy it is also necessary that this content be organized, not only through relatively fixed association but also with the aid of the rules of logic, and of our basic categories of space, time, causality, universality, etc. ... there will be a strong background of recurrent, stable, and separable features, against which the transitory and changing aspects of the unbroken flow of experience will be seen as fleeting impressions that tend to be arranged and ordered mainly in terms of the vast totality of the relatively static and fragmented content of [memories].

Bohm also claimed that &quot;as with consciousness, each moment has a certain explicate order, and in addition it enfolds all the others, though in its own way. So the relationship of each moment in the whole to all the others is implied by its total content: the way in which it &#x27;holds&#x27; all the others enfolded within it.&quot; Bohm characterises consciousness as a process in which at each moment, content that was previously implicate is presently explicate, and content which was previously explicate has become implicate.

One may indeed say that our memory is a special case of the process described above, for all that is recorded is held enfolded within the brain cells and these are part of matter in general. The recurrence and stability of our own memory as a relatively independent sub-totality is thus brought about as part of the very same process that sustains the recurrence and stability in the manifest order of matter in general. It follows, then, that the explicate and manifest order of consciousness is not ultimately distinct from that of matter in general.

== Analogies ==

=== Ink droplet analogy ===
Bohm also used the term &quot;unfoldment&quot; to characterise processes in which the explicate order becomes relevant (or &quot;relevated&quot;). Bohm likens unfoldment also to the decoding of a television signal to produce a sensible image on a screen. The signal, screen, and television electronics in this analogy represent the implicate order, while the image produced represents the explicate order. He also uses an example in which an ink droplet can be introduced into a highly viscous substance (such as glycerine), and the substance rotated very slowly, such that there is negligible diffusion of the substance. In this example, the droplet becomes a thread, which in turn eventually becomes invisible. However, by rotating the substance in the reverse direction, the droplet can essentially reform. When it is invisible, according to Bohm, the order of the ink droplet as a pattern can be said to be &quot;implicate&quot; within the substance.

In another analogy, Bohm asks us to consider a pattern produced by making small cuts in a folded piece of paper and then, literally, unfolding it. Widely separated elements of the pattern are, in actuality, produced by the same original cut in the folded piece of paper. Here, the cuts in the folded paper represent the implicate order, and the unfolded pattern represents the explicate order.

=== Holograms and implicate order ===

Bohm employed the hologram as a means of characterising implicate order, noting that each region of a photographic plate in which a hologram is observable contains within it the whole three-dimensional image, which can be viewed from a range of perspectives. That is, each region contains a whole and undivided image. In Bohm&#x27;s words:

 There is the germ of a new notion of order here. This order is not to be understood solely in terms of a regular arrangement of objects (e.g., in rows) or as a regular arrangement of events (e.g., in a series). Rather, a total order is contained, in some implicit sense, in each region of space and time. Now, the word &#x27;implicit&#x27; is based on the verb &#x27;to implicate&#x27;. This means &#x27;to fold inward&#x27; ... so we may be led to explore the notion that in some sense each region contains a total structure &#x27;enfolded&#x27; within it&quot;. 

Bohm noted that, although the hologram conveys undivided wholeness, it is nevertheless static.

In this view of order, laws represent invariant relationships between explicate entities and structures, and thus Bohm maintained that, in physics, the explicate order generally reveals itself within well-constructed experimental contexts as, for example, in the sensibly observable results of instruments. With respect to implicate order, however, Bohm asked us to consider the possibility instead &quot;that physical law should refer primarily to an order of undivided wholeness of the content of description similar to that indicated by the hologram rather than to an order of analysis of such content into separate parts...&quot;.

=== Implicate order in art ===
In the work &quot;Science, Order, and Creativity&quot; (Bohm and Peat, 1987), examples of implicate orders in science are laid out, as well as implicate orders which relate to painting, poetry and music.

Bohm and Peat emphasize the role of orders of varying complexity, which influence the perception of a work of art as a whole. They note that implicate orders are accessible to human experience. They refer, for instance, to earlier notes which reverberate when listening to music, or various resonances of words and images which are perceived when reading or hearing poetry.

Christopher Alexander discussed his work in person with Bohm, and pointed out connections among his work and Bohm&#x27;s notion of an implicate order in &quot;The Nature of Order&quot;.

Bohm features as a fictional character in the novel &quot;The Wave&quot; by British author Lochlan Bloom. The novel includes multiple narratives and explores many of the concepts of Bohm&#x27;s work on implicate and explicate orders.

== Challenges to some generally prevailing views ==
In proposing this new notion of order, Bohm explicitly challenged a number of tenets that he believed are fundamental to much scientific work:

# that phenomena are reducible to fundamental particles and laws describing the behaviour of particles, or more generally to any static (i.e., unchanging) entities, whether separate events in spacetime, quantum states, or static entities of some other nature;
# related to (1), that human knowledge is &quot;most fundamentally&quot; concerned with mathematical prediction of statistical aggregates of particles;
# that an analysis or description of any aspect of reality (e.g., quantum theory, the speed of light) can be unlimited in its domain of relevance;
# that the Cartesian coordinate system, or its extension to a curvilinear system, is the deepest conception of underlying order as a basis for analysis and description of the world;
# that there is ultimately a sustainable &quot;distinction&quot; between reality and thought, and that there is a corresponding distinction between the observer and observed in an experiment or any other situation (other than a distinction between relatively separate entities valid in the sense of explicate order); and
# that it is, in principle, possible to formulate a final notion concerning the nature of reality, i.e., a Theory of Everything.

Bohm&#x27;s proposals have at times been dismissed largely on the basis of such tenets.
His paradigm is generally opposed to reductionism, and some view it as a form of ontological holism. On this, Bohm noted of prevailing views among physicists that &quot;the world is assumed to be constituted of a set of separately existent, indivisible, and unchangeable &#x27;elementary particles&#x27;, which are the fundamental &#x27;building blocks&#x27; of the entire universe ... there seems to be an unshakable faith among physicists that either such particles, or some other kind yet to be discovered, will eventually make possible a complete and coherent explanation of everything&quot; ().

In Bohm&#x27;s conception of order, primacy is given to the undivided whole, and the implicate order inherent within the whole, rather than to parts of the whole, such as particles, quantum states, and continua. This whole encompasses all things, structures, abstractions, and processes, including processes that result in (relatively) stable structures as well as those that involve a metamorphosis of structures or things. In this view, parts may be entities normally regarded as physical, such as atoms or subatomic particles, but they may also be abstract entities, such as quantum states. Whatever their nature and character, according to Bohm, these parts are considered in terms of the whole, and in such terms, they constitute relatively separate and independent &quot;sub-totalities.&quot; The implication of the view is, therefore, that nothing is &quot;fundamentally&quot; separate or independent.

, said: &quot;The new form of insight can perhaps best be called Undivided Wholeness in Flowing Movement. This view implies that flow is in some sense prior to that of the ‘things’ that can be seen to form and dissolve in this flow.&quot; According to Bohm, a vivid image of this sense of analysis of the whole is afforded by vortex structures in a flowing stream. Such vortices can be relatively stable patterns within a continuous flow, but such an analysis does not imply that the flow patterns have any sharp division, or that they are literally separate and independently existent entities; rather, they are most fundamentally undivided. Thus, according to Bohm’s view, the whole is in continuous flux, and hence is referred to as the holomovement (movement of the whole).

=== Quantum theory and relativity theory ===
A key motivation for Bohm in proposing a new notion of order was the well-known incompatibility of quantum theory with relativity theory. summarised the state of affairs he perceived to exist:

...in relativity, movement is continuous, causally determinate and well defined, while in quantum mechanics it is discontinuous, not causally determinate and not well-defined. Each theory is committed to its own notions of essentially static and fragmentary modes of existence (relativity to that of separate events connectible by , and quantum mechanics to a well-defined quantum state). One thus sees that a new kind of theory is needed which drops these basic commitments and at most recovers some essential features of the older theories as abstract forms derived from a deeper reality in which what prevails is unbroken wholeness.

Bohm maintained that relativity and quantum theories are in basic contradiction in these essential respects, and that a new concept of order should begin with that toward which both theories point: undivided wholeness. This should not be taken to mean that he advocated such powerful theories be discarded. He argued that each was relevant in a certain context—i.e., a set of interrelated conditions within the explicate order—rather than having unlimited scope, and that apparent contradictions stem from attempts to overgeneralize by superposing the theories on one another, implying greater generality or broader relevance than is ultimately warranted. Thus, argued: &quot;... in sufficiently broad contexts such analytic descriptions cease to be adequate ... &#x27;the law of the whole&#x27; will generally include the possibility of describing the &#x27;loosening&#x27; of aspects from each other, so that they will be relatively autonomous in limited contexts ... however, any form of relative (and ) is ultimately limited by holonomy, so that in a broad enough context such forms are seen to be merely aspects, relevated in the holomovement, rather than disjoint and separately existent things in interaction.&quot;

=== Hidden variable theory ===
Before developing his &quot;implicit order&quot; approach, Bohm had proposed a hidden variable theory of quantum physics (see Bohm interpretation). According to Bohm, a key motivation for doing so had been purely to show the possibility of such theories. On this, said, &quot;... it should be kept in mind that before this proposal was made there had existed the widespread impression that no conception of any hidden variable at all, not even if it were abstract and hypothetical, could possibly be consistent with the quantum theory.&quot; also claimed that &quot;the demonstration of the possibility of theories of hidden variables may serve in a more general philosophical sense to remind us of the unreliability of conclusions based on the assumption of the complete universality of certain features of a given theory, however general their domain of validity seems to be.&quot; Another aspect of Bohm&#x27;s motivation had been to point out a confusion he perceived to exist in quantum theory. On the dominant approaches in quantum theory, he said: &quot;...we wish merely to point out that this whole line of approach re-establishes at the abstract level of statistical potentialities the same kind of analysis into separate and autonomous components in interaction that is denied at the more concrete level of individual objects&quot; ().

<text>The Afrīdī ( &quot;Aprīdai&quot;, plur. &quot;Aprīdī&quot;; ) are a Pashtun tribe present mostly in tribal areas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

The Afridis are most dominant in the Spin Ghar range west of Peshawar in Tribal areas of modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, covering most of the Khyber Pass and Maidan in Tirah which is their Native Tribal Territory. They are the closest to Orakzai in their language, culture and geographic areas.

==Etymology and origins==
===Etymology===
Herodotus, in his Histories, mentions an Indian tribe named Aparytai (Ἀπαρύται) inhabiting the Achaemenid satrapy of Arachosia. Thomas Holdich and Olaf Caroe have linked them with the Afridi tribe:

===Origins===
The origin of the Afridis is uncertain. Among the Afridi six Ḵaybar clans are generally distinguished: the Kūkī Ḵēl, Kambar Ḵēl, Kamar Ḵēl, Malek-dīn Ḵēl, Sepāh, and Zakkā Ḵēl (or Zəḵā Ḵēl), in the Khyber pass region. In addition, there are two &quot;assimilated clans&quot; not recognized by the first six, the Akā Ḵēl, settled south of the Bārā river in contact with the Ōrakzī, and the Ādam Ḵēl, occupying a mountainous region between Peshawar and Kohat. This complex clan structure,  perhaps reflects the diversity of the origins of the different ethnic groups forming this great tribe.

==History==
===Resistance against the Mughals===
The Afridis and their allies Khalils were first mentioned in the memoirs of Mughal Emperor Babar as violent tribes in need of subduing. The Afridi tribes controlled the Khyber Pass, which has served as a corridor connecting the Indian subcontinent with Afghanistan and Central Asia. Its strategic value was not lost on the Mughals to whom the Afridis were implacably hostile.

Over the course of Mughal rule, Emperors Akbar and Jahangir both dispatched punitive expeditions to suppress the Afridis, with little success.

Under the leadership of Darya Khan Afridi, they engaged in protracted warfare against the Mughal army in the 1670s. The Afridis once destroyed two large Mughal armies of Emperor Aurangzeb: in 1672, in a surprise attack between Peshawar and Kabul, and in the winter of 1673, in an ambush in the mountain passes. The emperor sent his Rajput general Rai Tulsidas with reinforcements into the mountains to suffocate the revolt and liberate the mountain. Allegedly, only five Mughal soldiers made it out of the battle alive and the rest of the Mughals were brutally slaughtered.

=== British Raj ===
During the First, Second, and Third Anglo-Afghan Wars, Afridis fought against the British; these skirmishes comprised some of the fiercest fighting of the Anglo-Afghan Wars. Ajab Khan Afridi was a well-known independence activist against the British Raj.

The British colonial administration regarded the Pashtun Afridi tribesmen as &quot;martial tribe&quot; under the martial races theory. Different Afridi clans also cooperated with the British in exchange for subsidies, and some even served with the Khyber Rifles, an auxiliary force of the British Indian Army.

=== First Kashmir War ===
Shortly after the Partition of India and the creation of Pakistan, Afridi tribesmen were among the ranks of the Pashtun militias that invaded the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir in October 1947, sparking the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948 and the ongoing Kashmir conflict. Today, Afridis make use of their dominant positions along the Durand Line in areas of Pakistan&#x27;s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province by controlling transport and various businesses, including trade in armaments, munitions and goods. Beside commercial activities, the Afridis also occupy substantial representation among Pakistan Armed Forces and paramilitary forces such as Khyber Rifles.

==Clans==

The Afridi Tribe is subclassified into eight sub-tribes (Ḵels), which reflect the different ethnic groups which joined to make the Afrīdīs:

* Kūkī Ḵēl
* Kambar Ḵēl
* Zakkā/Zəḵā Ḵēl
* Kamar/Kamraʾī Ḵēl
* Malek-dīn Ḵēl
* Sepāh
* Akā Ḵēl
* Ādam Ḵēl

==Religion==
Afridis follow the Sunni sect of Islam. Their conversion to Islam is attributed to Sultan (Emperor) Mahmud of Ghazni by Denzil Ibbetson and Haroon Rashid.

<text>Baron Montagu of Boughton is a British title which has been created twice for members of the Noble House of Montagu. First created in 1621, in the Peerage of England, for Sir Edward Montagu, eldest son of Sir Edward Montagu of Boughton and grandson of another Sir Edward Montagu who had been Lord Chief Justice during the reign of Henry VIII. He was also the brother of Henry Montagu, later created Earl of Manchester, and of Sidney Montagu, ancestor of the Earls of Sandwich.

Their ancestor was one Richard Ladde, grandfather of the Lord Chief Justice Sir Edward, who changed his name to Montagu in about 1447. His descendants claimed a connection with the main house of Montagu or Montacute, Barons Montagu and Earls of Salisbury, but the exact descent is unclear. A case has been made out for the possibility that the Ladde alias came from a division among coheirs about 1420 of the remaining small inheritance of a line of Montagus at Spratton and Little Creton, also in Northamptonshire.

The third Baron Montagu of Boughton was created Earl of Montagu and Viscount Monthermer in 1689 and Duke of Montagu and Marquess of Monthermer in 1705. He had married in 1675 the Lady Elizabeth Wriothesley, daughter of the 4th Earl of Southampton and a descendant of the original houses of Montagu and Monthermer. The Dukedom, Earldom and Barony of Montagu all became extinct on the death of their son John, 2nd Duke of Montagu, in 1749. The next creation was in 1762, in the Peerage of Great Britain. John Montagu, styled Lord Brudenell, son of the 4th Earl of Cardigan and maternal grandson of the last Duke of Montagu, was created Baron Montagu of Boughton in 1762. This title became extinct on his death without issue in 1770.

The next creation was for the late Baron&#x27;s father, who had been created Duke of Montagu in 1766. He was created Baron Montagu of Boughton, again in the Peerage of Great Britain, in 1786. On his death in 1790, when the Dukedom became extinct, the Barony passed under a special remainder to his female-line grandson Lord Henry Scott, second son of the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch. Lord Henry Scott also inherited the Lordship of Bowland from his mother, the Duchess, having the title entailed upon him by his nephew, the 5th Duke, in 1827. He died in 1845 whereupon the title of Montagu of Boughton became extinct.

His great-nephew Lord Henry Douglas-Scott-Montagu, second son of the 5th Duke of Buccleuch, was created Baron Montagu of Beaulieu in 1885.

<text>Arthur Christie (14 March 1921-2003) was a British coal miner and intelligence agent. He was seconded into Special Operations Executive on 22 April 1940 at Aston House, Stevenage, where he was to become one of the founding members of SOE. He was originally trained as an explosives expert, laying charges at the coalface as a miner. It was this expertise that became the reason he was seconded from the regular army into MI6 (R) based at Aston House; this was the place christened &quot;Churchill’s Toy Box.&quot;

Christie was born in Cobridge, Staffordshire, one of seven siblings, and grew up in the nearby town of Burslem. He left school at 14 and worked as a lathe turner and machine driller at the Sneyd Brick Company. At 16, he became a coal miner and attended college to specialise in coal-blasting and explosive-handling. The factory where he worked closed in 1939 and he enlisted with a friend in the RAF in Eltham, lying about his age as he was 17 at the time.

Christie was part of the SOE group at Tanjong Balai, sending messaging back to Britain to warn of the build-up of Japanese troops. 

He was captured by the Japanese at the fall of Singapore. He was imprisoned in Nagaskai in 1945.

His file is now open at the Public Record Office HS 9/313/1.

== Legacy ==
Christie&#x27;s son, Maurice, published the wartime memoirs of his father in 2004, one year after Arthur Christie&#x27;s death.

<doc id="899890" wikidata="Q3021794" url="?curid=899890" title="Phelsuma kely">
<text>Phelsuma kely is a species of diurnal gecko. It is endemic to Madagascar and is known from the central east coast of Madagascar, south of Tamatave. It typically inhabits dragon trees. The gecko feeds on insects and probably nectar.

Little is known of this species, and it is known only from a single locality. It was first scientifically described in 2004. The IUCN declines to classify it as endangered or otherwise, citing &quot;no information on its distribution, population status or threats&quot;.

== Appearance ==
It is the smallest known day gecko, reaching a total length of about 7.1 cm. Its body colour is variable and dependent on the mood of the animal. During activity, the basic body colour is white-gray with a black pattern on the back. However, the body colour can turn dark also. A black lateral stripe extends from the eye to the tail. The ventral side is grayish-white.

== Distribution ==
This species inhabits the central east coast of Madagascar, south of Tamatave. It is only known from the area around Lac Ampitabe.

== Habitat ==
&quot;P. kely&quot; is found on dragon trees. It shares its habitat with &quot;Phelsuma seippi&quot;, &quot;Phelsuma guttata&quot;, &quot;Phelsuma lineata&quot;, &quot;Phelsuma madagascariensis madagascariensis&quot;, &quot;Phelsuma quadriocellata&quot;, &quot;Phelsuma abbotti chekei&quot;, &quot;Phelsuma dubia&quot;, &quot;Phelsuma laticauda laticauda&quot; and &quot;Phelsuma madagascariensis grandis&quot;. All these species live sympatrically and partly syntopically. In March, the daytime temperature is around 27 °C and drops to around 23 °C at nighttime. The relative humidity is between 80 and 90%.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. Like many members of the genus &quot;Phelsuma&quot;, this species might also feed on pollen and nectar.

== Behaviour ==
This &quot;Phelsuma&quot; species is very shy.

== Reproduction ==
In captivity, the females lay a pair of eggs which measure about 7 x 6 mm. At a temperature of 28 °C during the day and 22 °C at night, the young will hatch after approximately 60 days. The juveniles have a total length of about 25–28 mm.

== Captivity ==
These geckos have been commercially traded, sometimes misidentified as &quot;Lygodactylus&quot; spp.

These animals should be housed in pairs in a well planted terrarium. The temperature should be between about 28 °C during the day and around 20 °C at nighttime. The relative humidity should be maintained between 80 and 90%. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moths, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies.

<text>BBC Cymru Wales is a division of the BBC and the main public broadcaster in Wales.

It is one of the four BBC national regions, alongside the BBC English Regions, BBC Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. Established in 1964, BBC Cymru Wales is based in Cardiff and directly employs some 1,200 people to produce a range of programmes for television, radio and online services in both English and Welsh.

BBC Cymru Wales operates two TV channels (BBC One Wales, BBC Two Wales) and three radio stations (BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and BBC Radio Cymru 2). The total budget for BBC Cymru Wales (including S4C&#x27;s £76 million) is £151 million, £31 million of which is for BBC-produced television productions.

==Services==

===Television===

BBC Cymru Wales operates two television services, BBC One Wales and BBC Two Wales, which can opt out of the main network feed of BBC One and BBC Two in England to broadcast national programming. These two channels broadcast a variety of programmes in English, including the flagship news programme &quot;BBC Wales Today&quot; which broadcasts several bulletins throughout the day including the main evening programme.

In addition to these two channels, BBC Cymru Wales is required to provide programmes in Welsh, which it supplies to the Welsh language channel S4C free of charge using the BBC Cymru brand. These programmes include a Welsh news service &quot;Newyddion&quot;, covering Welsh, general UK and international news, and a soap opera &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot;, the longest running television soap opera made by the BBC. Under a partnership agreement with S4C, BBC Cymru Wales provides playout and technology services to the channel.

===Radio===
BBC Cymru Wales operates three radio stations covering the entire country. BBC Radio Wales is the English language network, broadcasting local programmes for approximately 20 hours a day and simulcasting BBC Radio 5 Live during the station&#x27;s down time. BBC Radio Cymru broadcasts Welsh language programming for over 18 hours a day, providing a mix of general entertainment and factual programming, while BBC Radio Cymru 2 provides separate music-led programming at certain hours. While off air, both Radio Cymru stations simulcast overnight programme from the BBC World Service. 

===Online and interactive===
BBC Cymru Wales operates its own mini-site on BBC Online as well as providing news and features for other areas of BBC Online. In addition, news stories are provided for the BBC Red Button interactive service.

===BBC National Orchestra of Wales===

BBC Cymru Wales employs a full-time orchestra, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales (BBC NOW), who give concerts in Cardiff, Swansea and across Wales. The majority of the orchestra&#x27;s concerts are recorded for broadcast on BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Cymru. Since January 2009 the administrative base of the NOW has been the BBC Hoddinott Hall, in the Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff.

==History==

The first broadcast in Wales was on 13 February 1923 from the radio station 5WA at 19 Castle Street, Cardiff.

In March 1924 they moved into larger premises at 39 Park Place, later taking over most of the properties on the street.

During this time, the region was served from bases around Wales. During World War II, the regional services all ceased and broadcast the Home Service from London, although some Welsh content was included. The BBC&#x27;s Bangor base played host to the BBC Variety Department during the war, although this fact was never officially announced.

Following the end of the Second World War, the BBC Home Service continued its regional opt-outs, including an opt-out service for Wales. This opt-out continued after the change from the Home Service to Radio 4 and paved the way for two full-time radio services - BBC Radio Cymru in 1977, followed a year later by BBC Radio Wales.

In 1952 they bought a 10-acre site at Baynton House in Llandaff, Cardiff to house all of its operations in the city.

The BBC has also occupied other locations in Cardiff such as; Celtic Road in Gabalfa, Newport Road in Roath, above a Spar shop in Llandaff village, and Charles Street in the city centre.

The first television signals in Wales came on 15 August 1952 from the newly constructed Wenvoe transmitter. The transmitter itself broadcast the national BBC Television service. Wales would gain some significance when, in 1957, the BBC West region from Bristol was established including a daily five-minute news bulletin for Wales, followed five years later by the launch of the daily magazine programme, &quot;Wales Today&quot;.

The launch of BBC Wales on 9 February 1964 provided a specific television service for the country. The new service was heavily promoted (proclaiming that &quot;Wales gets its very own TV service in 1964!&quot;) with animated promos using the sound of Welsh choirs to explain about interference from the mountains. Two years later in 1966, BBC Cymru Wales&#x27; new headquarters at Broadcasting House in Cardiff opened and the first colour broadcast for Wales followed in 1970.
Prior to 1982, BBC Cymru Wales on television provided programmes in both English and Welsh, with the news programme &quot;Heddiw&quot; and the long-running serial &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; figuring among the key output. However, this changed with the launch of S4C on 1 November 1982 as all Welsh-language programming on both the BBC and the ITV contractor HTV was transferred to the new channel. As part of a guaranteed ten hours a week of BBC-produced programming, &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; switched to the new channel while a newly expanded news service, &quot;Newyddion&quot;, was launched.

Into the late 1990s, BBC Cymru Wales continued to expand their services. The first web pages for Wales began to appear on BBC Online in 1997, including a variety of features surrounding programming, schedules, community events and other stories. The following year, BBC Wales gained additional air time through the use of a late prime-time to midnight opt-out from new digital channel BBC Choice. This lasted until opt-outs ended on the channel in 2001; subsequently BBC Wales opted out of the BBC Two prime-time schedule on digital platforms to broadcast BBC 2W. This latter service closed on 2 January 2009 – prior to the digital switchover which would have ceased separate broadcasting on analogue and digital.

Expansion in the number of drama productions handled by BBC Cymru Wales since 2011 has resulted in the construction and opening on a new studio centre in Cardiff.

In August 2013, it was announced that Broadcasting House and Ty Oldfield (Oldfield House), opposite, was for sale, with plans to move to a new a purpose-built headquarters in the city centre. The BBC attributed the decision to &quot;ageing infrastructure at Llandaff&quot; and considered sites including Central Square, land south of Cardiff Central railway station, and land between the Senedd and Atradius. In 2014, it was confirmed that Broadcasting House would be demolished and turned into 400 residential units. The BBC confirmed in 2015 that Central Square would be the location of their new headquarters building and began to move out of Llandaff studios in 2019.

The New Broadcasting House opened in 2020. In July 2020 BBC One Wales and BBC Two Wales Presentation and Playout move from Llandaff to become the first live services from the new building. This was followed by the first radio broadcasts, by BBC Radio Cymru 2 host Daniel Glyn on the 25 July and by Radio Wales host Owen Money on the 31 July. TV News moved into the building in September 2020 when viewers saw the building&#x27;s roof garden in a live report by reporter Alex Jennings as part of an afternoon broadcast of &quot;Wales Today&quot;.

==Studios==
=== Central Square, Cardiff ===

The current headquarters of BBC Cymru Wales is New Broadcasting House, based in Cardiff&#x27;s Central Square in the heart of the city. It opened in 2019, with broadcasting starting in 2020. The new building is the base for almost all BBC Cymru Wales staff, and is purpose built to house radio and TV production teams. It is the home of BBC Cymru Wales&#x27;s news services, in English and Welsh, &quot;Wales Today&quot;, BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Cymru, as well as production teams for UK-wide programming and programmes commissioned by S4C.

Its location was decided in June 2014, on the site of the former Cardiff Central bus station. It can house up to 1,000 staff, with around half the floor space of its former Llandaff base and with 70% less studio space. Fewer studios were needed in the new headquarters partly as a result of the new purpose build facilities for drama and BBC National Orchestra of Wales in Cardiff Bay. Staff started to move into the new headquarters in October 2019,

=== Studios in Cardiff Bay (Roath Lock and Hoddinott Hall) ===
The expansion of BBC Cymru Wales&#x27; drama productions in recent years has resulted in investment for new studios. Drama production for BBC Cymru Wales is currently based at Roath Lock studios in Cardiff Bay. The main year-round productions on site include &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Casualty&quot;, both made for BBC One, and Pobol y Cwm, which BBC Cymru Wales produces on behalf of S4C.

In the 2000s, as a temporary measure to generate extra capacity, BBC Wales invested into Upper Boat Studios in Pontypridd to house several productions, notable centred around the 2005 revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and its sister productions &quot;Torchwood&quot; and &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;. Despite the investment in Upper Boat, the studio complex soon became too small to house new productions being moved to the BBC Nations. As part of this decision, it was decided in March 2009 that BBC productions &quot;Casualty&quot; and &quot;Crimewatch&quot; were to relocate from their former homes at BBC Bristol network production unit to Cardiff.

To house these new programmes, a new studio complex was built, designed to house the productions of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;Upstairs Downstairs&quot;, and &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot;. Located in Porth Teigr, Cardiff Bay, Roath Lock Studios gained permission in January 2009 and construction began in June 2010 with the building topping out in February 2011. Production began at the site in autumn 2011 and the site was officially opened on 12 March 2012. As a result, &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; moved from the Llandaff studios and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; moved from Upper Boat studios to the new complex, with &quot;Casualty&quot; joining them at the site. Despite being designed to house them, the site never housed the &quot;Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, following the death of main actress Elisabeth Sladen in 2011, or &quot;Upstairs Downstairs&quot;, following the series&#x27; cancellation.

BBC National Orchestra of Wales operated from a purpose-built orchestra studio, Studio 1, in Broadcasting House from 1966 to 2008. They then moved to new purpose built facilities at BBC Hoddinott Hall in January 2009, as part of the Wales Millennium Centre campus.

=== Broadcasting House, Llandaff ===

Until 2020, BBC Cymru Wales&#x27;s headquarters were at Broadcasting House, Llandaff, Cardiff.

The studio centre was built in 1966 and opened the following year as a purpose-built location to house the expanding presence of the BBC in Cardiff. The centre contained studios for the news programmes, radio space including that used by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales until 2009, and another studio for drama productions constructed in the mid-1970s. It was the first time that all of BBC Cymru Wales&#x27;s departments within Cardiff were located on one site.

Broadcasting House was built next to Baynton House which housed all of the BBC Wales&#x27; operations from 1952 until construction was finished. Baynton House remained in use by the BBC until 1975 when it was demolished to make way for the E-Block extension.

Previously, the BBC in Wales had been located in the converted Broadway Methodist Chapel on Broadway in Roath, Cardiff from 1955, and in nearby premises on Stacey Road in Roath, Cardiff from 1959. A temporary broadcasting centre was set up on the banks of the River Taff, in 1958 to cover the Empire Games. While these studios played host to drama, entertainment and regional programmes, the site was still not ideal. The site only held two studios, both located in the church, and the ability to broadcast film was not installed on the site for several years; film played into programmes from a telecine machine in Bristol or London and film processing for news was carried out by a firm called Park Pictures in Cardiff until BBC processing was installed in Stacey Road.

=== Studios outside of Cardiff ===
BBC Cymru Wales&#x27;s main studios outside of Cardiff are based in Bangor, Gwynedd, and are home to around 50 staff. Much of BBC Radio Cymru&#x27;s daytime output is broadcast from here.

Across Wales, there are also a number of properties that the BBC owns are local radio studios. These are primarily used as contributor studios, where interviewees or reporters can join a radio programme from an ISDN line, with the presenter remaining in the main studio in Cardiff or Bangor. These studios are located in Aberystwyth, Carmarthen, Newtown, Penrhyndeudraeth, Swansea and Wrexham.

==Television productions==

BBC Cymru Wales produces local and networked programming for broadcast in Wales and the rest of the UK. In recent years, its drama output has been particularly successful, including the 2005 revival of the classic science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and its spin-offs &quot;Torchwood&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; (2007). In addition, BBC Wales commissions other drama output for the BBC network from independent producers, such as &quot;Life on Mars&quot; (2006–07).

<text>Gregor Kiczales is an American Canadian computer scientist. He is currently a professor of computer science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He is best known for developing the concept of aspect-oriented programming, and the AspectJ extension to the Java programming language, both of which he designed while working at Xerox PARC. He is also one of the co-authors of the specification for the Common Lisp Object System, and is the author of the book &quot;The Art of the Metaobject Protocol&quot;, along with Jim Des Rivières and Daniel G. Bobrow.

Most of Kiczales&#x27; work throughout the years has been focused on allowing software engineers to create programs that look as much as possible like their design, to reduce complexity and make code maintenance easier, ultimately improving software quality.
== Career ==
After pursuing undergraduate studies at MIT, Kiczales started his research career in 1980 at the MIT Lab for Computer Science, where he stayed until 1983. In 1984, he joined the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center software research lab as member of research staff, becoming principal scientist in 1996. Throughout his time at PARC, Kiczales developed some of his most important research works, including aspect-oriented programming and AspectJ. He left PARC in 1999 to focus on computer science education.

In 2000, he moved to Canada and joined the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia as a tenured professor. At UBC, Kiczales started the Software Practices Lab and designed a number of courses related to software engineering and programming languages. Most importantly, he designed CPSC 110, the introductory programming course in the UBC curriculum, which students take in their first year of undergraduate studies. The course focuses on systematic program design by means of &quot;design recipes&quot;.

In 2002, he co-founded Intentional Software with Charles Simonyi, but then left the company in 2003 in order to return to UBC.

In 2012, he won the Senior AITO Dahl-Nygaard Prize for his work on the Common Lisp Object System, and was named an ACM Fellow for his contributions to aspect-oriented programming.

In July 2017, he was appointed executive director of UBC Extended Learning.

<text>Shinhwa () is a South Korean six-member boy band based in Seoul, composed of Eric Mun, Lee Min-woo, Kim Dong-wan, Shin Hye-sung, Jun Jin, and Andy Lee. Launched by SM Entertainment on March 24, 1998, the group signed with Good Entertainment in 2004 before creating their Shinhwa Company to manage their career as a band. The band struggled initially with their first album before finding commercial success with their sophomore album &quot;T.O.P.&quot; (April 1999). When their contract with SM Entertainment expired in July 2003, all six members signed with Good Entertainment and assumed creative control with the release of &quot;Brand New&quot; (August 2004). That same year, members began to pursue individual careers.

After a four-year hiatus due to majority of the members completing their mandatory military service, the sextet established the Shinhwa Company to facilitate their group career. The release of their tenth album &quot;The Return&quot; (2012) made them the first Korean boy band to continue performing after the members&#x27; mandatory military services. Shinhwa is also the first K-pop idol group to lead a successful career after leaving its original agency, despite being embroiled in legal battles with SM Entertainment over the name &quot;Shinhwa&quot; for several years. Over the course of their twenty-year career, Shinhwa have released thirteen Korean studio albums, one Japanese album, and various compilation albums.

The group is the longest-running boy band in the history of K-pop and is often referred to as part of the &quot;First Generation of K-pop&quot;, alongside H.O.T., S.E.S., g.o.d, Fin.K.L, among others. Their work and longevity have served as influences to future generations of K-pop idol groups, leading many to describe the band itself as &quot;legendary&quot;.

==History==

===1998–2001: Formation, commercial struggles, and mainstream breakthrough===

With the already established acts of H.O.T. and S.E.S., SM Entertainment sought to release another group to capitalize on the two formers&#x27; successes. Composed of members Mun Eric, Lee Min-woo, Kim Dong-wan, Jun Jin, Shin Hye-Sung, and Lee Andy, the group was named Shinhwa, the Korean word for myth or legend, and made their debut with &quot;Resolver&quot; on May 9, 1998. The album was supported by three singles: the titled track, &quot;Eusha! Eusha!&quot; (Hangul: &quot;으쌰! 으쌰!&quot;), and &quot;Sharing Forever&quot; (Hangul: &quot;천일유혼&quot;). &quot;Resolver&quot;&#x27;s chart performance was lackluster, however, and Shinhwa was accused of lacking originality and duplicating label mate H.O.T.&#x27;s sound. The group also became embroiled in controversies when the 1998 Sokcho submarine incident occurred, and &quot;Eusha! Eusha!, which was about a fun trip at the beach, was used as a reminder of the event. Although Shinhwa won Best New Artist at the Mnet Asian Music Awards, &quot;Resolver&quot; underperformed commercially, and the sextet almost disbanded.

Shinhwa&#x27;s found mainstream success with their next few albums. Their sophomore album, &quot;T.O.P. (&quot;April 1999), was met with positive reviews for its title song and the group&#x27;s edgier concept. A second single, &quot;Yo&quot;, was promoted but did not fare as well. The album debuted at No. 4 and peaked at No. 3, selling 377,500 copies and charting for 24 weeks on the Korean monthly chart. The group received the Best Music Video from a New Male Pop Group award from the Mnet Asian Music Awards.

&quot;Only One&quot; (May 2000) became their first to debut at the top of the chart. Buoyed by three singles, &quot;Only One&quot;, &quot;All Your Dreams&quot;, and &quot;First Love&quot;, it sold over 423,000 copies, and Shinhwa won three awards that year: the SBS Gayo Popularity Award, the KMTV song Bonsang Award, and the Popular Singers Award. That January, Shinhwa held their first concert, First Mythology. Shinhwa&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Hey, Come On!&quot;, was released on June 8, 2001, debuting at No. 3 and was promoted with two singles: &quot;Hey, Come On!&quot; and &quot;Wild Eyes&quot;, the latter of which spawned various dance covers due to its choreography incorporating the use of chairs. The album was a commercial success, selling over 430,700 copies and ranked No. 11 on the 2001 year-end chart. Shinhwa was also associated with several controversies at the time, including scrutiny over the absence of member Andy and the alleged copying of Shinhwa&#x27;s popular single, &quot;Hey, Come On!&quot; by Taiwanese boy band, Energy.

===2002–2003: Making history, change in management, and solo activities===
Their first compilation album, &quot;My Choice&quot; (January 2002), featured some of the members&#x27; favorite songs and some of their most popular tracks. In contrast to &quot;Hey, Come On!&quot;&#x27;s strong sales, &quot;My Choice&quot; was met with moderate success, selling more than 171,300 copies while debuting and peaking at No. 4 before it dropped from the Korean monthly Chart. On the Year-End Chart, &quot;My Choice&quot; ranked No. 31, selling a total of 183,000 copies. A few months after the release of &quot;My Choice&quot;, Shinhwa released their fifth studio album, &quot;Perfect Man&quot;, on March 29, 2002. The album marked the return of member Andy. &quot;Perfect Man&quot; debuted atop the Korean monthly chart, becoming Shinhwa&#x27;s second chart-topping album. Along with the title track, the group promoted with the album with the second single &quot;I Pray 4 U&quot;. Final sales were over 355,000 copies and the album was ranked No. 14 on the year end Top 100 Albums in 2002 Chart, with over 362,00 copies sold.

Shinhwa made history in the Korean music industry by becoming the longest-running Korean boy band with the release of its sixth album, &quot;Wedding&quot; (December 2002). The album debuted and peaked at No. 3 and sold over 273,700 copies. &quot;Wedding&quot; also marked the expiration of their contract with SM Entertainment, who offered all the members except Dongwan a second contract. The group collectively chose to sign with Good Entertainment, resulting in a court battle to retain the use of their name, which they won. Because the contract with Good Entertainment would not begin until 2004, members pursued solo activities in 2003: Min-woo went solo under the name &quot;M,&quot; releasing his first album entitled &quot;Un-touch-able&quot;, while Hye-sung collaborated with Kangta and Lee Ji-hoon for a project group S. Jun Jin branched out into acting with the drama &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; alongside actress Kim Tae-hee. Andy and Jun Jin participated in a Korean sitcom &quot;Nonstop 4&quot; as well as Banjun Drama. Eric began acting in dramas soon after acting in several CFs. Shinhwa is the first to have its members promote as solo artists while still continuing group activities. The members too strived in the solo activities.

The members regrouped and released the compilation album &quot;Winter Story 2003–2004&quot; on December 30, 2003, which sold over 100,000 copies. They held their second concert The Everlasting Mythology from April 18 to 20, 2003, and also embarked on the Winter Story Tour, traveling to six cities: Seoul, Pusan, Daejeon, Incheon, Daegu, and Kwangju. They later traveled to Japan for the Shinhwa First Live in Tokyo, holding a Japanese fan meeting called Have Fun With Shinhwa On M.Net Tour&quot;.&quot;

===2004–2006: Creative control, commercial success, and first Asia Tour===
Shinhwa&#x27;s first album with Good Entertainment, &quot;Brand New&quot; (August 2004), debuted at No. 3 on the monthly Korean chart, peaking at No.1 in November and selling over 320,000 copies. The album saw increased creative control by the members, with Eric and Min-woo contributing to its production and Jun Jin with the choreography, leading to more dance songs being included in the final release instead of their usual pop music. The album was promoted with four singles: &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Oh!&quot;, &quot;Crazy&quot;, and title track, and ranked No. 4 on the 2004 year-end chart. It won several accolades for the group, including Best Artist of The Year for the first time at the Seoul Gayo Daesang Awards. Several weeks later, on December 29, Shinhwa was awarded their second &quot;daesang&quot; at the 2004 SBS Gayo Daejun Awards, winning two of the possible four d&quot;aesang&quot; in that year with Rain and Lee Soo Young receiving the other two. In 2004, of all musical artists and groups, Shinhwa received the most awards, totaling thirteen or more, from various places: the m.net KMTV Music Video Festival, Seoul Gayo Daesang, Golden Disc Awards and MBC, KBS, SBS Gayo Awards. The awards other than Best Artist of the Year included Best Male Artist, Best Dance Artist, and Overseas Choice Award.

After the success of &quot;Brand New,&quot; Shinhwa embarked on a tour, holding a Korea-China-Japan summer camp called Shinhwa Summer Story 2004. The camp was dedicated entirely for their non-Korean fans. Although, Shinhwa was mostly on hiatus throughout 2005, they released two popular singles, &quot;How Do I Say&quot; and &quot;Hey Dude!&quot; and held the Tropical Summer Story Festival concert. For a majority of 2005, Shinhwa hosted a reality show called &quot;Let&#x27;s Coke Play Battle Shinhwa!&quot;, a competition to find the next Shinhwa, with the winning group debuting as the short-lived boy band Battle under Good Entertainment. To end the year, Shinhwa released &quot;Winter Story 2004-2005,&quot; which sold over 102,300 copies.

After renewing their contract with Good Entertainment for another 3 years, the group&#x27;s &quot;State of the Art&quot; was released on May 11, 2006. The album debuted atop the chart and sold over 215,600 copies domestically. &quot;Brand New&quot; and &quot;State Of The Art&quot; became their first consecutive No. 1 albums, with the latter becoming the third best selling album in 2006, behind SG Wannabe&#x27;s &quot;The 3rd Masterpiece&quot; and TVXQ&#x27;s &quot;&quot;O&quot;-Jung.Ban.Hap.&quot;. Following a performance at Tokyo&#x27;s Budokan Hall to celebrate the founding of Mnet Japan, their Japanese language album &quot;Inspiration #1&quot; and the lead single, &quot;This is the Sun in Our Hearts&quot; released on June 14, 2006. The album released in Japan on August 16 peaked at No. 4 on Oricon Chart, selling in excess of 100,000 copies each. Shinhwa later embarked on their first Asia tour, Shinhwa 2006 Tour: State of the Art, kicking off with two concerts at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena, Seoul and visiting Japan, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and other countries. They also performed at Budokan Hall in Tokyo, and Osaka-jo Hall on September 24 and 26, as part of the 2006 Japan Tour Inspiration#1.

=== 2007–2012: Solo activities, 10th anniversary, and mandatory military service ===
In 2007, members expanded their solo activities even further while Shinhwa was on hiatus, with each members starting their own company – M Rising (Min-woo), New Dream Entertainment (Andy), JF Story Entertainment (Jun Jin), H2 Entertainment (Dong-wan), and Top Class Entertainment (Eric) – to manage their solo careers. Dong-wan also released his first album entitled &quot;Kim Dongwan is&quot; on July 5, 2007. Min-woo released his third album on July 10, 2007 and though he had intended to release his third album in the U.S., he released it in Korea instead. Hye-sung released his second album on August 8, 2007.

Although their ninth album was set to be released in October 2007, it was ultimately delayed and they released &quot;Winter Story 2007&quot; on December 6, 2007, which debuted at No. 3 and sold 24,500 copies. Shortly after the release of &quot;Winter Story 2007&quot;, Shinhwa staged their Asia Concert with a two-day performance on the December 8 and 9 in Saitama, Japan, followed by a concert in Shanghai. Celebrating their anniversary, Shinhwa staged a 10th anniversary concert and released their ninth studio album &quot;Volume 9&quot;. Because the concert was the last concert before the members left for the army, all 22,000 seats available for the concert were sold out.

After their 10th anniversary and the release of their 9th album, the members continued to work on their individual activities until their mandatory military service, with Eric enlisting in October 2008 and Dong-wan in November at Gongju, Chungcheongnam-do Both served non-active duty, e.g. they were public service workers, after undergoing four weeks of basic training. Jun Jin enlisted on October 22, 2009, at the Nonsan military camp in Chungcheongnam-do Province for four weeks of basic training and continued as a public service worker. On January 11, 2010, Andy enlisted for mandatory military service and was the only member to serve 21 months of active duty. Min-woo was the last of the members to enlist in February 2010. He also served non-active duty after undergoing four weeks of basic training. Hye-sung was exempt from military service due to serious and recurring injuries in his knee sustained during a concert in 2001.
On October 30, 2010, Eric was discharged from military service. Dong-wan was discharged on December 17 after serving 24 months as an administrative worker at the Seodaemun-gu District Office. Andy was discharged from active duty on October 31, 2011, from the Ministry of National Defense in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. Jun Jin was discharged on November 14, 2011, after working at the Gangnam Management Corporation, managing the culture center&#x27;s fitness club and parking lot. This was followed by Min-woo on March 2, 2012, after serving as a public service officer in Seoul Station.

===2012–2017: Shinhwa Company and touring===
After their contract with Good Entertainment expired, Shinhwa created their own company to manage their activities as a group, with Eric and Min-woo as co-CEOs and the remaining members as shareholders. Members&#x27; individual activities continue to be manage by their respective agencies. A press conference to launch Shinhwa&#x27;s comeback was held on March 5, 2012, at CGV cinema in Cheongdam-dong, which was streamed live by Mnet Media. The group released their tenth studio album &quot;The Return&quot; on March 23, 2012. To promote the album, Shinhwa embarked on the 2012 Shinhwa Grand Tour in Seoul: The Return, which kicked off at Olympic Gymnastics Arena on March 24 and 25, 2012, and continued with shows in Japan, China, Taiwan and Singapore. They also hosted their first exclusive variety program, &quot;Shinhwa Broadcast&quot;, which aired on cable channel JTBC. The producers held a public shoot and press conference to showcase the program.

The following year, Shinhwa resumed their music activities as a group with the release of their 11th studio album and 15th anniversary concert in March, in addition to the 2013 Shinhwa 15th Anniversary Concert: The Legend Continues at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in March. On the same day information on ticketing and a teaser video were released. The 25,000 tickets were sold out within five minutes of going on sale, by over 300,000 people who tried to buy the tickets. Their eleventh album &quot;The Classic&quot; was released on May 16, 2013, followed by an Asian concert tour, 2013 Shinhwa Grand Tour: The Classic in support of the album.
Their 16th anniversary concert, Here, was held on March 22–23, 2014 at the Olympic Park Gymnastics Stadium, which sold out its 27,000 seats and crashed the website server. Due to a gambling scandal, however, Andy was absent from the shows, making a surprise appearance during the last show to apologize to the audience.

In 2015, Shinhwa announced it would be appearing on Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS)&#x27;s 800th Inkigayo episode, including the return of Andy from his extended hiatus. This was followed by the release of their album in over two years, &quot;We&quot; (February 2015). The LDN Noise-produced lead-single &quot;Sniper&quot; rose to the top of five real-time music charts, Bugs, genie, Olleh Music, Mnet, and Cyworld, and the music video for the single reached over a million YouTube views within two weeks of the song&#x27;s release. Shinhwa also won the Show Champion for the song &quot;Sniper&quot; on March 11, 2015. Their thirteenth album, &quot;Unchanging&quot;, was released on January 1, and peaked at No. 3 on the World Albums Chart. They held their 17th anniversary concert &#x27;WE&#x27; on March 21 and 22 in Korea, and went on to hold concerts in various parts of China. They held their 17th anniversary FINALE concert &#x27;WE SHINHWA&#x27; on August 22 and 23 in Korea. On May 29, Shinhwa won the trademark rights to their group name after 12 years. The members expressed their joy upon earning their name back after years of legal battle.

=== 2018–present: 20th anniversary and Shinhwa WDJ ===

In commemoration of their 20th anniversary, Shinhwa released a re-recorded darker version of their song &quot;All Your Dreams&quot; from the album &quot;Only One&quot;, in addition to filming a new music video. They also kicked off a fan meeting party from March 24–25 to signal the start of their 20th anniversary project, &quot;All Your 2018&quot; and performed for KBS Music Bank&#x27;s twentieth anniversary alongside other artists.

On August 28, they released their album, &quot;Heart&quot;, with the title track &quot;Kiss Me Like That&quot; and promoted on music shows for three consecutive weeks. Their 20th anniversary concert, Heart Tour in Seoul, which will take place October 6–7, sold out within 5 minutes and crashed the website&#x27;s servers upon ticket release. On April 20 and 21, 2019, they held their 21st anniversary concert, Chapter 4. On August 17, 2022, Liveworks Company announced Shinhwa&#x27;s first sub-unit, Shinhwa WDJ, which consisted of Minwoo, Dongwan and Junjin, to debut this winter. The release schedule for the album &quot;Come to Life&quot; was released on December 6.

== Legacy ==
Shinhwa is the longest-running Korean boy band in existence, and is often listed as one of the legendary &quot;first generation&quot; K-pop idol groups including H.O.T., S.E.S., Sechs Kies, Fin.K.L, and g.o.d. Although the word &quot;shinhwa&quot; means myth or legend, the group themselves have been described as a &quot;legendary&quot; K-pop idol group for their longevity, and their constant change in image and rebranding have been credited for their continued success. Shinhwa was the first K-pop group to try a lot of new things: from being an idol-actor, to radio DJ, to branching out as solo artists while still being active as a group.

When they debuted, the trend at the time was for male idol group members to remain &quot;mysterious&quot; and &quot;dark&quot;, a concept the group utilized when promoting their early materials. They rebranded themselves when the &quot;flower boy&quot; concept, which describes &quot;young males with pretty faces and &#x27;unpretentious cuteness&#x27;&quot;, became popular; they have continued to adjust their images as they age, incorporating suits and polished haircuts into their looks later on. Shinhwa&#x27;s intense dance moves have also become one of their staples, with their song &quot;Wild Eyes&quot; spawning various dance covers due to its choreography incorporating the use of chairs and the choreography for &quot;Venus&quot; being described as &quot;high intensity&quot;. Shinhwa were also credited for pioneering vogue dancing in Korea. With the rise of competition from the &quot;second generation&quot; of idol groups in South Korea, Shinhwa began to make a foray into Asia in 2005, embarking on tours and fan meetings. They were voted as the Best Korean Singer Overseas twice in poll held by Arirang International Broadcasting. The poll allowed only foreigners to vote, with Shinhwa&#x27;s songs &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; in 2006 and &quot;Pretty&quot; in 2007 topping the polls.

Shinhwa&#x27;s popularity have also led to the creation of the official fan club, Shinhwa Changjo. The color orange has been associated with Shinhwa Changjo ever since its establishment in 1998, and is used in both Shinhwa&#x27;s official and unofficial merchandise, including light-sticks, balloons, raincoats, and various kinds of apparels and accessories. These orange-colored cheering tools are used in each member&#x27;s individual promotion activities as well. Similar to the band, Shinhwa Changjo is the longest running Korean fan club, and upon the release of their 12th album in February 2015, Shinhwa opened the recruitment for the 10th wave of its official fanclub. Shinhwa does not have an official light-stick like other groups, instead they have a new light-stick for every concert Shinhwa holds.

Their work have inspired newer generations of artists, including 2PM, Big Bang, Dreamcatcher, EXID, MAP6, and Seventeen, many who strive to one day last as long as the sextet. Kangta, a member of H.O.T., have also praised the group for choosing to switch labels when SM Entertainment offered contracts to all but one member instead of splitting up, a rare action among idol groups.

==Controversy==

===&quot;Hey, Come On!&quot;===
In July 2002, Taiwanese boy band Energy covered Shinhwa&#x27;s song, &quot;Hey, Come On!&quot; causing tensions between the fans of Shinhwa and Energy. As it was later noted, Jeff Vincent and Peter Rafelson who wrote &quot;Hey, Come On!&quot; had sold the song to Energy, therefore, it was legal. Even so, fans of Shinhwa were angry over that fact. The Taiwanese group 5566 also covered Shinhwa&#x27;s &quot;Dark&quot;, a song included in Shinhwa&#x27;s 4th album.

===Leaving SM Entertainment===
In 2003 SM Entertainment&#x27;s 5-year contract with Shinhwa ended. Lee Soo Man, the head of SM Entertainment, offered contract renewals to all but Dongwan. Choosing to sign with a new agency instead, the choice sparked controversies when Lee denied their permission to use the name &quot;Shinhwa&quot; with the different company. At the height of the battle in September 2014, the band had to rename the agency Shinhwa Company as ShinCom Entertainment to avoid legal issues. In May 2015, after 12 years of legal battles, Shinhwa finally won the lawsuit over Joon Media and re-renamed their agency as Shinhwa Company. Open World Entertainment CEO, Seok-Woo Jang, holder of the rights to the name of Shinhwa, granted permission to use the name as long as they perform together as a group. Open World held the rights to Shinhwa&#x27;s overseas concerts with Shinhwa Company, and overseas licensing of the group&#x27;s albums. The heads of Top Class Entertainment and Liveworks Company are directors of Shinhwa Company, with the former in charge of promotion and management in general, and the latter providing support regarding albums, concerts and promotions.

<text>In chess, a relative value (or point value) is a standard value conventionally assigned to each piece. Piece valuations have no role in the rules of chess but are useful as an aid to evaluating a position.

The best-known system assigns 1 point to a pawn, 3 points to a knight or bishop, 5 points to a rook and 9 points to a queen. Valuation systems, however, provide only a rough guide; the true value of a piece can vary significantly depending on position.

== Standard valuations ==
Piece values exist because calculating to checkmate in most positions is beyond reach even for top computers. Thus, players aim primarily to create a material advantage; to pursue this goal, it is normally helpful to quantitatively approximate the strength of an army of pieces. Such piece values are valid for, and conceptually averaged over, tactically &quot;quiet&quot; positions where immediate tactical gain of material will not happen.

The following table is the most common assignment of point values.

The oldest derivation of the standard values is due to the Modenese School (Ercole del Rio, Giambattista Lolli, and Domenico Lorenzo Ponziani) in the 18th century and is partially based on the earlier work of Pietro Carrera. The value of the king is undefined as it cannot be captured or traded during the course of the game. Chess engines usually assign the king an arbitrary large value such as 200 points or more to indicate that the inevitable loss of the king due to checkmate trumps all other considerations. During the endgame, as there is less danger of checkmate, the king will often assume a more active role. It is better at defending nearby pieces and pawns than the knight is and better at attacking them than the bishop is. Overall, this makes the king more powerful than a minor piece but less powerful than a rook, so its fighting value is about four points.

This system has some shortcomings: namely, combinations of pieces do not always equal the sum of their parts; for instance, two bishops on opposite colours are usually worth slightly more than a bishop plus a knight, and three (nine points) are often slightly stronger than two rooks (ten points) or a queen (nine points). Chess-variant theorist Ralph Betza identified the &#x27;leveling effect&#x27;, which causes reduction of the value of stronger pieces in the presence of opponent weaker pieces, due to the latter interdicting access to part of the board for the former in order to prevent the value difference from evaporating by 1-for-1 trading. This effect causes 3 queens to badly lose against 7 knights (when both start behind a wall of pawns), even though the added piece values predict that the player with the seven knights is two knights short of equality. In a less exotic case, it explains why trading rooks in the presence of a queen-vs-3-minors imbalance favours the player with the queen, as the rooks hinder the movement of the queen more than of the minor pieces. Adding piece values is thus a first approximation, because piece cooperation must also be considered (e.g. opposite-coloured bishops cooperate very well) alongside each piece’s mobility (e.g. a short-range piece far away from the action on a large board is almost worthless).

The evaluation of the pieces depends on many parameters. Edward Lasker stated that &quot;It is difficult to compare the relative value of different pieces, as so much depends on the peculiarities of the position&quot;. Nevertheless, he valued the bishop and knight () equally, the rook a minor piece plus one or two pawns, and the queen three minor pieces or two rooks. Larry Kaufman suggests the following values in the middlegame:

The is worth 7.5 pawns – half a pawn more than the values of its constituent bishops combined. Although it would be a very theoretical situation, there is no such bonus for a pair of same-coloured bishops. Per investigations by H. G. Muller, three light-squared bishops and one dark-squared bishop would receive only a 0.5-point bonus, while two on each colour would receive a 1-point bonus. More imbalanced combinations like 3:0 or 4:0, however, were not tested. The position of each piece also makes a significant difference: pawns near the edges are worth less than those near the centre, pawns close to promotion are worth far more, pieces controlling the centre are worth more than average, trapped pieces (such as ) are worth less, etc.

==Alternative valuations==
Although the 1-3-3-5-9 system of point totals is the most commonly given, many other systems of valuing pieces have been proposed. Several systems treat the bishop as slightly more powerful than a knight.

&quot;Note:&quot; Where a value for the king is given, this is used when considering piece development, its power in the endgame, etc.
===Larry Kaufman&#x27;s 2021 system===

Larry Kaufman in 2021 gives a more detailed system based on his experience working with chess engines, depending on the presence or absence of queens. He uses &quot;middlegame&quot; to mean positions where both queens are on the board, &quot;threshold&quot; for positions where there is an imbalance (one queen versus none, or two queens versus one), and &quot;endgame&quot; for positions without queens. (Kaufman did not give the queen&#x27;s value in the middlegame or endgame cases, since in these cases both sides have the same number of queens and their values cancel.)

The file of a pawn is also important, because this cannot change except by capture. According to Kaufman, the difference is small in the endgame (when queens are absent), but in the middlegame (when queens are present) the difference is substantial:

In conclusion:
*an unpaired bishop is slightly stronger than knight;
*a knight is superior to three average pawns, even in the endgame (situations like three &quot;passed&quot; pawns, especially if they are connected, would be exceptions);
*with queens on the board, a knight is worth four pawns (as commented by Vladimir Kramnik for a full board);
*the bishop pair is an advantage (as one can hide from one bishop by fixing king and pawns on the opposite colour, but not from both), and this advantage increases in the endgame;
*an extra rook is helpful in the &quot;threshold&quot; case, but not otherwise (because two rooks fighting against a queen benefit from the ability to defend each other, but minor pieces against a rook need a rook&#x27;s help more than the rook needs the help of another rook);
*a second queen has lower value than normal.

In the endgame:
* R = B (unpaired) + 2P, and R &gt; N + 2P (slightly); but if a rook is added on both sides, the situation favours the minor piece side
* 2N are only trivially better than R + P in the endgame (slightly worse if there are no other pieces), but adding a rook on both sides gives the knights a big advantage
* 2B ≈ R + 2P; adding a rook on both sides makes the bishops superior
* R + 2B + P ≈ 2R + N

In the threshold case (queen versus other pieces):

* Q ≥ 2R with all minor pieces still on the board, but Q + P = 2R with none of them (because the queen derives more advantage from cooperating with minor pieces than the rooks do)
* Q &gt; R + N (or unpaired B) + P, even if another pair of rooks is added
* Q + minor ≈ R + 2B + P (slightly favouring the rook side)
* 3 minors &gt; Q, especially if the minors include the bishop pair. The difference is about a pawn if rooks are still on the board (because in this case they help the minors more than the queen); with all rooks still on the board, 2B + N &gt; Q + P (slightly).

In the middlegame case:

* B &gt; N (slightly)
* N = 4P
* The exchange is worth:
** just under 2 pawns if it is unpaired R vs N, but less if the rook is paired, and a bit less still if the minor piece is an unpaired bishop
** one pawn if it is paired R vs paired B
* 2B + P = R + N with extra rooks on the board
* 2N &gt; R + 2P, especially with an extra pair of rooks
* 2B = R + 3P with extra rooks on the board

The above is written for around ten pawns on the board (a typical number); the value of the rooks goes down as pawns are added, and goes up as pawns are removed.

Finally, Kaufman proposes a simplified version that avoids decimals: use the traditional values P = 1, N = 3, B = 3+, and R = 5 with queens off the board, but use P = 1, N = 4, B = 4+, R = 6, Q = 11 when at least one player has a queen. The point is to show that two minor pieces equal rook and two pawns with queens on the board, but only rook and one pawn without queens.

===Hans Berliner&#x27;s system===
World Correspondence Chess Champion Hans Berliner gives the following valuations, based on experience and computer experiments:

There are adjustments for the and of a pawn and adjustments for the pieces depending on how or the position is. Bishops, rooks, and queens gain up to 10 percent more value in open positions and lose up to 20 percent in closed positions. Knights gain up to 50 percent in closed positions and lose up to 30 percent in the corners and edges of the board. The value of a may be at least 10 percent higher than that of a .
There are different types of doubled pawns; see the diagram. White&#x27;s doubled pawns on the b-file are the best situation in the diagram, since advancing the pawns and exchanging can get them un-doubled and mobile. The doubled b-pawn is worth 0.75 points. If the black pawn on a6 were on c6, it would not be possible to dissolve the doubled pawn, and it would be worth only 0.5 points. The doubled pawn on f2 is worth about 0.5 points. The second white pawn on the h-file is worth only 0.33 points, and additional pawns on the file would be worth only 0.2 points.

==Changing valuations in the endgame==
As already noted when the standard values were first formulated, the relative strength of the pieces will change as a game progresses to the endgame. Pawns gain value as their path towards promotion becomes clear, and strategy begins to revolve around either defending or capturing them before they can promote. Knights lose value as their unique mobility becomes a detriment to crossing an empty board. Rooks and (to a lesser extent) bishops gain value as their lines of movement and attack are less obstructed. Queens slightly lose value as their high mobility becomes less proportionally useful when there are fewer pieces to attack and defend. Some examples follow.
* A queen versus two rooks
**In the middlegame, they are equal
**In the endgame, the two rooks are somewhat more powerful. With no other pieces on the board, two rooks are equal to a queen and a pawn
* A rook versus two minor pieces
** In the opening and middlegame, a rook and &quot;two&quot; pawns are weaker than two bishops; equal to or slightly weaker than a bishop and knight; and equal to two knights
** In the endgame, a rook and &quot;one&quot; pawn are equal to two knights; and equal to or slightly weaker than a bishop and knight. A rook and &quot;two&quot; pawns are equal to two bishops.
* Bishops are often more powerful than rooks in the opening. Rooks are usually more powerful than bishops in the middlegame, and rooks dominate the minor pieces in the endgame.
* As the tables in Berliner&#x27;s system show, the values of pawns change dramatically in the endgame. In the opening and middlegame, pawns on the central files are more valuable. In the late middlegame and endgame the situation reverses, and pawns on the wings become more valuable due to their likelihood of becoming an outside passed pawn and threatening to promote. When there is about fourteen points of material on both sides, the value of pawns on any file is about equal. After that, wing pawns become more valuable.

C.J.S. Purdy gave a value of points in the opening and middlegame but 3 points in the endgame.

==Shortcomings of piece valuation systems==

There are shortcomings of giving each type of piece a single, static value.
* Two minor pieces plus two pawns are sometimes as good as a queen. Two rooks are sometimes better than a queen and pawn.
* Many of the systems have a 2-point difference between the rook and a , but most theorists put that difference at about points (see ).
* In some open positions, a rook plus a pair of bishops are stronger than two rooks plus a knight.

===Example 1===

Positions in which a bishop and knight can be exchanged for a rook and pawn are fairly common (see diagram). In this position, White should not do that, e.g.:
: 1. Nxf7 Rxf7
: 2. Bxf7+ Kxf7
This seems like an even exchange (6 points for 6 points), but it is not, as two minor pieces are better than a rook and pawn in the middlegame.

In most openings, two minor pieces are better than a rook and pawn and are usually at least as good as a rook and two pawns until the position is greatly simplified (i.e. late middlegame or endgame). Minor pieces get into play earlier than rooks, and they coordinate better, especially when there are many pieces and pawns on the board. On the other hand, rooks are usually blocked by pawns until later in the game. Pachman also notes that the is almost always better than a rook and pawn.
===Example 2===

In this position, White has exchanged a queen and a pawn (10 points) for three minor pieces (9 points). White is better because three minor pieces are usually better than a queen because of their greater mobility, and Black&#x27;s extra pawn is not important enough to change the situation. Three minor pieces are almost as strong as two rooks.

===Example 3===

In this position, Black is ahead in material, but White is better. White&#x27;s queenside is completely defended, and Black&#x27;s additional queen has no target; additionally, White is much more active than Black and can gradually build up pressure on Black&#x27;s weak kingside.

==Fairy pieces==
In fairy chess, in general, the approximate value formula_1 in centipawns of a short-range leaper with formula_2 moves on an 8 × 8 board is formula_3. The quadratic term reflects the possibility of cooperation between moves.

If pieces are asymmetrical, moves going forward are about twice as valuable as move going sideways or backward, presumably because enemy pieces can generally be found in the forward direction. Similarly, capturing moves are usually twice as valuable as noncapturing moves (of relevance for pieces that do not capture the same way they move). There also seems to be significant value in reaching different squares (e.g. ignoring the board edges, a king and knight both have 8 moves, but in one or two moves a knight can reach 40 squares whereas a king can only reach 24). It is also valuable for a piece to have moves to squares that are orthogonally adjacent, as this enables it to wipe out lone passed pawns (and also checkmate the king, but this is less important as usually enough pawns survive to the late endgame to allow checkmate to be achieved via promotion). As many games are decided by promotion, the effectiveness of a piece in opposing or supporting pawns is a major part of its value.

An unexpected result from empirical computer studies is that the princess (a bishop-knight compound) and empress (a rook-knight compound) have almost exactly the same value, even though the lone rook is two pawns stronger than the lone bishop. The empress is about 50 centipawns weaker than the queen, and the princess 75 centipawns weaker than the queen. This does not appear to have much to do with the bishop&#x27;s colourboundedness being masked in the compound, because adding a non-capturing backward step turns out to benefit the bishop about as much as the knight; and it also does not have much to do with the bishop&#x27;s lack of mating potential being so masked, because adding a backward step (capturing and non-capturing) to the bishop benefits it about as much as adding such a step to the knight as well. A more likely explanation seems to be the large number of orthogonal contacts in the move pattern of the princess, with 16 such contacts for the princess compared to 8 for the empress and queen each: such orthogonal contacts would explain why even in cylindrical chess, the rook is still stronger than the bishop even though they now have the same mobility. This makes the princess extremely good at annihilating pawn chains, because it can attack a pawn as well as the square in front of it.

<text>Earl Beaulieu (pronounced &quot;Bewley&quot;), of Beaulieu in the County of Southampton, was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1784 for the 1st Baron Beaulieu, who had earlier represented Tiverton in the House of Commons. He had previously been created Baron Beaulieu, of Beaulieu in the County of Southampton, in 1762, also in the Peerage of Great Britain.

Born Edward Hussey, he was the husband of Lady Isabella Montagu, widow of the 2nd Duke of Manchester and daughter of the 2nd Duke of Montagu, and had assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Montagu in 1749. His son and heir, John, Lord Montagu, predeceased him. Consequently, both titles became extinct on Lord Beaulieu&#x27;s death in 1802. Between 1790 and 1802, Earl Beaulieu also held the title Lord of Bowland, a lordship he inherited on the death of his father-in-law. On his death, the Lordship of Bowland passed to his sister-in-law&#x27;s husband, Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch.

<text>The E-Meter (also electropsychometer and Hubbard Electrometer) is an electronic device used in Scientology that allegedly &quot;registers emotional reactions&quot;. After claims by L. Ron Hubbard that the procedures of auditing, which used the E-Meter, could help heal diseases, the E-Meter became the subject of litigation. Since then, the Church of Scientology publishes disclaimers declaring that the E-Meter &quot;by itself does nothing&quot;, is incapable of improving health, and is used solely for spiritual purposes.

==History==

=== Mathison ===
Volney Mathison built an EDA meter based on a Wheatstone bridge, a vacuum tube amplifier, and a large moving-coil meter that projected an image of the needle on the wall. He patented his device in 1954 as an &quot;electropsychometer&quot; or E-meter, and it came to be known as the &quot;Mathison Electropsychometer&quot;. In Mathison&#x27;s words, the E-meter &quot;has a needle that swings back and forth across a scale when a patient holds on to two electrical contacts&quot;. Mathison recorded in his book, &quot;Electropsychometry&quot;, that the idea of the E-Meter came to him in 1950 while listening to a lecture by L. Ron Hubbard:

and

Hubbard told of that encounter in a 1952 recorded lecture:
Mathison began working with L. Ron Hubbard in 1951 and that year filed application for his first E-meter patent, U.S. Patent 2,684,670. After the partnership broke up in 1954, Mathison continued improving his E-meters with additional patents (, ), marketing them through his own company and publications, retaining many of the concepts and terms from his time with Hubbard.

In a separate line of development, EDA monitors were incorporated in polygraph machines by Leonarde Keeler. Rigorous testing of the polygraph has yielded mixed results, and some critics classify polygraph operation as a pseudoscience.

=== Hubbard ===
The E-meter was adopted for use in Dianetics and Scientology when Mathison collaborated with Hubbard in 1951. Some sources say the E-meter was &quot;developed by Volney Mathison following Hubbard&#x27;s designs&quot;, or that Hubbard invented it. Hubbard falsely claimed to be the inventor of the E-meter, a claim which is in keeping with the Scientology stance that Hubbard is the &quot;source&quot;, or &quot;the only originator of all Dianetics and Scientology material&quot;.

The E-meter was not part of the early days of Dianetics and Scientology. Auditing was composed of conversation and not led by a mechanical device. Hubbard introduced an E-meter prototype during the 1952 Philadelphia Doctorate Course but did not introduce his transistorized version until several years later. The E-meter became &quot;the principal material artifact&quot; of Dianetics and Scientology from the 1960s onward.

In the book, &quot;L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?&quot;, Bent Corydon wrote:

Though it seemed for a while that Scientology&#x27;s more advanced techniques would serve without an E-meter, a few months later in May 1955, Hubbard wrote:

The Scientology meter was smaller, based on transistors rather than vacuum tubes, and powered by a low-voltage rechargeable battery rather than line voltage.

From then on, the E-meter was a required tool for Scientology ministers. The &quot;Hubbard Mark II&quot; E-meter was christened in 1960 and the Hubbard Mark III shortly after. On December 6, 1966, Hubbard won a patent on the Mark V version under the name &quot;Hubbard Electropsychometer&quot;. Corydon wrote that the Hubbard E-meter was actually developed by Scientologists Don Breeding and Joe Wallis, though the patent () does not list other developers.

The Scientology E-meter has been redesigned and re-patented several times since its first introduction to Dianetics (e.g.: , , ).

=== Earlier similar devices ===

Electrodermal activity meters were first developed in 1889 in Russia, and psychotherapists began using them as tools for therapy in the 1900s.

== Use in Scientology ==


E-meters are used by Scientology practitioners known as &quot;auditors&quot;. Scientology materials refer to the subject as the &quot;preclear&quot;. The auditor gives the preclear a series of commands or questions while the preclear holds a pair of cylindrical electrodes (&quot;cans&quot;) connected to the meter, and the auditor notes both the verbal response and the activity of the meter. Auditor training includes familiarization with a number of characteristic needle movements, each with a specific significance. Religion scholar Dorthe Refslund Christensen describes the e-meter as &quot;a technical device that could help the auditor locate engrams and areas of change when auditing a preclear&quot;.

Scientology concepts associated with the E-meter and its use are regarded by the scientific and medical communities as pseudoscience, as the E-meter has never been subjected to clinical trials as a therapeutic tool.

Scientologists claim that in the hands of a trained operator, the meter can indicate whether a person has been relieved from the spiritual impediment of past experiences. In accordance with a 1974 federal court order, the Church of Scientology asserts that the E-meter is intended for use only in church-sanctioned auditing sessions; it is not a curative or medical device. The E-meters used by the Church were previously manufactured by Scientologists at their Gold Base facility, but were being manufactured in Hong Kong and Taiwan as of 1998.

According to Hubbard, the E-meter is used by the operator for three vital functions:
# To determine what process to run and what to run it on.
# To observe how well the process is running.
# To know when the process should be stopped.
The Church claims that the E-meter can be used to assess the emotional charge of single words, whole sentences, and questions, as well as indicating the general state of the subject when the operator is not speaking. Few users of the E-meter claim that it does anything to the subject. To most, it does no more than suggest to the operator a change of mental, emotional, or autonomic nervous system activity.

New religious movement scholar Douglas Cowan writes that Scientologists cannot progress along the Bridge to Total Freedom without an E-meter, and that Hubbard even told Scientologists to buy two E-meters, in the event that one of them fails to operate. According to anthropologist Roy Rappaport, the E-meter is a ritual object, an object that &quot;stand[s] indexically for something intangible&quot;.

=== Other uses ===

Similar devices have been used as research tools in many human studies and as one of several components of the Leonarde Keeler&#x27;s polygraph (lie detector) system, which has been widely criticized as ineffective and pseudoscientific by legal experts and psychologists.

EDA meters are used in both therapist-patient and bio-feedback settings. EDA is one of the factors recorded by polygraphs, and EDA meters are often used in human studies to gauge psychological responses.

== Description ==
Most prominent on the face of the e-meter is a display with a needle pointer. There are several dials and knobs, and modern e-meters have several LCD displays. All models have knobs for turning the device on, testing it, setting the sensitivity, and boosting the device. The primary control for the auditor is the tone arm (a rotating lever) which is held throughout auditing and operated by one hand while the auditor writes with their other hand. As the needle on the display moves off the right or left of the dial, the tone arm is used to bring the needle back on the dial. During an auditing session, the auditor writes down questions he has asked the preclear, the preclear&#x27;s answers, and activity of the e-meter such as needle movements and tone arm settings

=== Electronics ===

One of E-meter&#x27;s primary components is a Wheatstone bridge, an electrical circuit configuration invented in 1833 that enables the detection of very small differences between two electrical impedances (in this case, resistances). The E-meter is constructed so that one resistance is the subject&#x27;s body and the other is a rheostat controlled by the operator. A small voltage from the battery is applied to electrodes held in the subject&#x27;s hands. As the electrical properties (electrodermal activity) of the subject&#x27;s body change during the counseling, the resulting changes in the small electric current are displayed in needle movements on a large analog panel meter. The dial face is without numbers because the absolute resistance in ohms is relatively unimportant, while the operator watches primarily for characteristic needle motions. The voltage applied to the electrodes is less than 1.5 V, and the electric current through the subject&#x27;s body is less than a half a milliampere.

In the Scientology E-meter, the large control, known as the &quot;tone arm&quot;, adjusts the meter bias, while a smaller one controls the gain. The operator manipulates the tone arm to keep the needle near the center of the dial so its motion is easily observed. A simple E-meter powered by direct current, such as that used by the Scientologists and the like, displays several kinds of electrodermal activity (EDA) on the one dial without distinction, including changes in resistance and bioelectric potential. Researchers in psychophysiology are also exploring admittance and impedance aspects of EDA that can be observed only with alternating current.

The E-Meter, measuring variations in electrodermal activity (which can be highly responsive to emotion), functions on the same physiological data sources as one of the parts of the polygraph, or &quot;lie detector&quot;. According to Scientology doctrine, the resistance corresponds to the &quot;mental mass and energy&quot; of the subject&#x27;s mind, which are claimed to change when the subject thinks of particular mental images (engrams). One account tells about Hubbard using the E-meter to determine whether or not fruits can experience pain, as in his 1968 assertion that tomatoes &quot;scream when sliced&quot;.

The traditional theory of EDA holds that skin resistance varies with the state of sweat glands in the skin. Sweating is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. Because sweat contains electrolytes (salt, etc.), conductivity is increased when the sweat glands are activated. But some advocates argue that the meter responds more quickly than would be possible by the exudation and drying of sweat. They propose an additional mechanism termed the &quot;Tarchanoff Response&quot;, through which the cerebral cortex of the brain affects the current directly. This phenomenon is not completely understood, and further research needs to be performed.

== Legal issues ==

===United States===

The medical establishment had been watching Hubbard&#x27;s enterprises since 1951, when the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners prosecuted the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation (Elizabeth, New Jersey) for practicing medicine without a license. In 1958, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seized and destroyed 21,000 Dianazene tablets from Hubbard&#x27;s Distribution Center Inc., charging that they were falsely labeled as a treatment for radiation sickness.

On January 4, 1963, in service of an FDA complaint, more than 100 US marshals and deputized longshoremen with drawn guns raided the Founding Church of Scientology in Washington, D.C., and confiscated more than three tons of property, including 5,000 books, 2,900 booklets, and several hundred E-meters. The FDA accused the Church of making false medical claims that the E-meters could treat physical and mental illnesses. The FDA also charged that the meters did not bear adequate directions for treating the conditions for which they were recommended.

The Church claimed that they had not written any publication that the E-meter could or would heal anything and sued to get the property back. Years of litigation ensued. In the first trial beginning on April 3, 1967, the jury found that the Church misrepresented the E-meter, and the judge ordered the confiscated materials destroyed. However, in 1969 the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed the verdict; the Church, it said, had made substantial showing that Scientology is a religion and the government had done nothing to rebut the claim. The US Court of Appeals wrote: 

Having found that Scientology was a religion, the Court wrote that the government was forbidden by the First Amendment to the Constitution to rule on the truth or falsity of the Church&#x27;s doctrines and interfere with its practices, provided the claims are not manifestly insincere and the practices are reasonably harmless. The Court ordered a new trial with the mandate that the trial court could not forbid auditing, use of the E-meter, or purveyance of the literature within a religious context. The FDA appealed the decision, but in 1969, the US Supreme Court declined to review the case, commenting only that &quot;Scientology meets the &quot;prima facie&quot; test of religion&quot;. In his 1973 judgment, District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell ruled that:Unable to do more under the mandate from the Court of Appeals, Judge Gesell ordered all the property to be returned to the Church, and thereafter, the E-meter may be used only in &quot;&quot;bona fide&quot; religious counseling&quot;. All meters and referring literature must include a label disclaiming any medical benefits:

The church adopted a modified version of that statement, which it still invokes in connection with the E-meter. The current statement reads:

Judge Gesell also ordered the Church to pay all the government&#x27;s legal fees and warehousing costs for the confiscated property for the nine years of litigation. He also required the church to pay the salaries and travel expenses of FDA agents who might, from time to time, inspect for compliance with the court&#x27;s order. The raid was ruled illegal, but the government retained copies of the documents.

===Sweden===
In 1979, a court forbade calling the E-meter &quot;an invaluable aid to measuring man&#x27;s mental state and changes in it&quot; in an advertisement. The prohibition was upheld by the European Commission of Human Rights in case &quot;X. and Church of Scientology v. Sweden&quot;.

===France===
In October 2009, a three-judge panel at the Correctional Court in Paris, convicted the church and six of its members of organized fraud. The Court&#x27;s decision followed a three-week trial, where two plaintiffs alleged they were defrauded by the organization. One plaintiff&#x27;s complaint involved the use of an E-Meter by Scientologists with medical implications. This plaintiff claimed that, after being audited with the device, she was encouraged to pay tens of thousands of euros for vitamins, books, and courses to improve her condition. She argued that amounted to fraud. The Court agreed, and the ruling was upheld on appeal in 2013. See .

===Australia===

In 1964, the government of Victoria, Australia, held a Board of Inquiry into Scientology which returned its findings in a document colloquially known as the Anderson Report. Psychiatrist Ian Holland Martin, honorary federal secretary of the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, gave evidence that the E-Meter &quot;used for Scientology&quot; was a &quot;psycho-galvano-meter&quot; and was &quot;dangerous in unqualified hands&quot;. He said that if the E-meter &quot;was suggested to possess mysterious powers&quot; to someone who did not understand that it had &quot;been thoroughly discredited as a lie detector&quot; then &quot;that person would be suggestible to ideas foisted on him by the operator&quot;. The final report of the inquiry stated that the E-meter enabled Scientology

In 1965, Victoria banned the use of the E-meter without a license, with Western Australia and South Australia following suit. In 1969, the High Court of Western Australia ruled the ban illegal. South Australia repealed its law in 1973, and Victoria repealed it in 1982. In 1983, the High Court of Australia ruled that Scientology was a religion and as such had the same rights and protections.

==Scientology beliefs and theories==
Within the Church of Scientology, the early psychoanalysts are credited with first use of the E-meter.

Hubbard credited Mathison with recreating the E-meter and bringing him the first model for use in Dianetics. Hubbard set out his theory of how the E-meter works in his book &quot;Understanding the E-Meter&quot;:

Hubbard claimed that this &quot;mental mass&quot; has the same physical characteristics, including weight, as mass as commonly understood by lay persons:

This text in &quot;Understanding the E-Meter&quot; is accompanied by three drawings. The first shows a man standing on a weighing scale, which reflects a weight of &quot;150&quot; (the units are not given). The next shows the man on the same scale, weighed down under a burden of &quot;Mental Image Pictures&quot;, and the scale indicates a weight of &quot;180&quot;. The last picture shows the man standing upright on the scale, now unburdened by &quot;Mental Image Pictures&quot; and with a smile on his face, while the scale again indicates a weight of &quot;148&quot;.

Bob Thomas, senior executive of the church in the early 1970s, gave a prosaic description.

<text>Interpreting is translation from a spoken or signed language into another language, usually in real time to facilitate live communication. It is distinguished from the translation of a written text, which can be more deliberative and make use of external resources and tools.

The most common two modes of interpreting are simultaneous interpreting, which is done at the time of the exposure to the source language, and consecutive interpreting, which is done at breaks to this exposure.

Interpreting is an ancient human activity which predates the invention of writing.

== History ==
=== Historiography ===

Research into the various aspects of the history of interpreting is quite new. For as long as most scholarly interest was given to professional conference interpreting, very little academic work was done on the practice of interpreting in history, and until the 1990s, only a few dozen publications were done on it.

Considering the amount of interpreting activities that is assumed to have occurred for thousands of years, historical records are limited. Moreover, interpreters and their work have usually not found their way into the history books. One of the reasons for that is the dominance of the written text over the spoken word (in the sense that those who have left written texts are more likely to be recorded by historians). Another problem is the tendency to view it as an ordinary support activity which does not require any special attention, and the social status of interpreters, who were sometimes treated unfairly by scribes, chroniclers and historians.

Knowledge of the past of interpreting tends to come from letters, chronicles, biographies, diaries and memoirs, along with a variety of other documents and literary works, many of which (and with few exceptions) were only incidentally or marginally related to interpreting.

== Etymology ==
Many Indo-European languages have words for &quot;interpreting&quot; and &quot;interpreter&quot;. Expressions in Germanic, Scandinavian and Slavic languages denoting an interpreter can be traced back to Akkadian, around 1900 BCE. The Akkadian root / also gave rise to the term dragoman via an etymological sideline from Arabic.

The English word &quot;interpreter&quot;, however, is derived from Latin (meaning &#x27;expounder&#x27;, &#x27;person explaining what is obscure&#x27;), whose semantic roots are not clear. Some scholars take the second part of the word to be derived from or (meaning &#x27;price&#x27;, which fits the meaning of a &#x27;middleman&#x27;, &#x27;intermediary&#x27; or &#x27;commercial go-between&#x27;), but others have suggested a Sanskrit root.

== Modes ==
===Consecutive===

In consecutive interpreting (CI), the interpreter starts to interpret after the speaker pauses; thus much more time (perhaps double) is needed. Customarily, such an interpreter will sit or stand near the speaker.

Consecutive interpretation can be conducted in a pattern of short or long segments according to the interpreter&#x27;s preference. In short CI, the interpreter relies mostly on memory whereas, in long CI, most interpreters will rely on note-taking. The notes must be clear and legible in order to not waste time on reading them. Consecutive interpreting of whole thoughts, rather than in small pieces, is desirable so that the interpreter has the whole meaning before rendering it in the target language. This affords a truer, more accurate, and more accessible interpretation than where short CI or simultaneous interpretation is used.

An attempt at consensus about lengths of segments may be reached prior to commencement, depending upon complexity of the subject matter and purpose of the interpretation, though speakers generally face difficulty adjusting to unnatural speech patterns.

On occasion, document sight translation is required of the interpreter during consecutive interpretation work. Sight translation combines interpretation and translation; the interpreter must render the source-language document to the target-language as if it were written in the target language. Sight translation occurs usually, but not exclusively, in judicial and medical work.

Consecutive interpretation may be the chosen mode when bilingual listeners are present who wish to hear both the original and interpreted speech or where, as in a court setting, a record must be kept of both.

When no interpreter is available to interpret directly from source to target, an intermediate interpreter will be inserted in a relay mode, e.g. a Greek source language could be interpreted into English and then from English to another language. This is also commonly known as double-interpretation. Triple-interpretation may even be needed, particularly where rare languages or dialects are involved. Such interpretation can only be effectively conducted using consecutive interpretation.

=== Simultaneous ===

Simultaneous interpretation (SI) has the disadvantage that if a person is performing the service the interpreter must do the best they can within the time permitted by the pace of source speech. However they also have the advantages of saving time and not disturbing the natural flow of the speaker. SI can also be accomplished by software where the program can simultaneously listen to incoming speech and speak the associated interpretation. The most common form is extempore SI, where the interpreter does not know the message until they hear it.

Simultaneous interpretation using electronic equipment where the interpreter can hear the speaker&#x27;s voice as well as the interpreter&#x27;s own voice was introduced at the Nuremberg trials in 1945. The equipment facilitated large numbers of listeners, and interpretation was offered in French, Russian, German and English. The technology arose in the 1920s and 1930s when American businessman Edward Filene and British engineer Alan Gordon Finlay developed simultaneous interpretation equipment with IBM. Yvonne Kapp attended a conference with simultaneous interpretation in 1935 in the Soviet Union. As it proved successful, IBM was able to sell the equipment to the United Nations, where it is now widely used in the United Nations Interpretation Service.

In the ideal setting for oral language, the interpreter sits in a sound-proof booth and speaks into a microphone, while clearly seeing and hearing the source-language speaker via earphones. The simultaneous interpretation is rendered to the target-language listeners via their earphones.

===The progressive shift from consecutive to simultaneous===
Pavel Palazchenko&#x27;s &quot;My Years with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze: The Memoir of a Soviet Interpreter&quot; gives a short history of modern interpretation and of the transition from its consecutive to simultaneous forms. He explains that during the nineteenth century, interpreters were rarely needed during European diplomatic discussions; these were routinely conducted in French, and all government diplomats were required to be fluent in this language. Most European government leaders and heads of state could also speak French. Historian Harold Nicolson attributes the growing need for interpretation after World War I to the fact that U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and British Prime Minister David Lloyd George &quot;were no linguists&quot;. At the time, the concept and special equipment needed for simultaneous interpretation, later patented by Alan Gordon Finlay, had not been developed, so consecutive interpretation was used.

Consecutive interpreters, in order to be accurate, used a specialized system of note-taking which included symbols, abbreviations and acronyms. Because they waited until the speaker was finished to provide interpretation, the interpreters then had the difficult task of creating from these notes as much as half an hour of free-flowing sentences closely matching the speaker&#x27;s meaning. Palazchenko cites , Jean Herbert and the Kaminker brothers as skilled interpreters, and notes one unusual case in which André Kaminker interpreted a speech by a French diplomat who spoke for two and a half hours without stopping.

After World War II, simultaneous interpretation came into use at the Nuremberg trials and began to be more accepted. Experienced consecutive interpreters asserted that the difficulties of listening and speaking at the same time, adjusting for differences in sentence structure between languages, and interpreting the beginning of a sentence before hearing its end, would produce an inferior result. As well, these interpreters, who to that point had been prominent speakers, would now be speaking invisibly from booths.

In 1951, when the United Nations expanded its number of working languages to five (English, French, Russian, Chinese and Spanish), consecutive interpretation became impractical in most cases, and simultaneous interpretation became the most common process for the organization&#x27;s large meetings. Consecutive interpretation, which provides a more fluent result without the need for specialized equipment, continued to be used for smaller discussions.

===Technology support===
Stemming from the field of computer-assisted translation, the field of computer-assisted interpretation has emerged, with dedicated tools integrating glossaries and automated speech recognition.

===Whispered===

Whispered interpretation is known in the trade by the French term &quot;chuchotage&quot;. To avoid disturbing the participants using the original language, the interpreter speaks to a few people at close proximity with normal voiced delivery at a very low volume, or through electronic equipment without the benefit of a soundproof booth. Typically, no actual whispering is involved as this is difficult to decipher, causes postural fatigue while parties lean in to one another, and straining to be heard at a whisper &quot;can be as bad for your voice as shouting.&quot;

==Types==

===Conference===

Conference interpreting refers to interpretation at a conference or large meeting, either simultaneously or consecutively. The advent of multi-lingual meetings has reduced the amount of consecutive interpretation in the last 20 years.

Conference interpretation is divided between two markets: institutional and private. International institutions (EU, UN, EPO, et cetera), which hold multilingual meetings, often favor interpreting several foreign languages into the interpreters&#x27; mother tongues. Local private markets tend to have bilingual meetings (the local language plus another), and the interpreters work both into and out of their mother tongues. These markets are not mutually exclusive. The International Association of Conference Interpreters (AIIC) is the only worldwide association of conference interpreters. Founded in 1953, its membership includes more than 2,800 professional conference interpreters, in more than 90 countries.

===Judicial===
Judicial, legal, or court interpreting occurs in courts of justice, administrative tribunals, and wherever a legal proceeding is held (i.e., a police station for an interrogation, a conference room for a deposition, or the locale for taking a sworn statement). Legal interpreting can be the consecutive interpretation of witnesses&#x27; testimony, for example, or the simultaneous interpretation of entire proceedings, by electronic means, for one person, or all of the people attending. In a legal context, where ramifications of misinterpretation may be dire, accuracy is paramount. Teams of two or more interpreters, with one actively interpreting and the second monitoring for greater accuracy, may be deployed.

The right to a competent interpreter for anyone who does not understand the language of the court (especially for the accused in a criminal trial) is usually considered a fundamental rule of justice. Therefore, this right is often guaranteed in national constitutions, declarations of rights, fundamental laws establishing the justice system or by precedents set by the highest courts. However, it is not a constitutionally required procedure (in the United States) that a certified interpreter be present at police interrogation. This has been especially controversial in cases where illegal immigrants with no English skills are accused of crimes.

In the US, depending upon the regulations and standards adhered to per state and venue, court interpreters usually work alone when interpreting consecutively, or as a team, when interpreting simultaneously. In addition to practical mastery of the source and target languages, thorough knowledge of law and legal and court procedures is required of court interpreters. They are often required to have formal authorization from the state to work in the courts – and then are called certified court interpreters. In many jurisdictions, the interpretation is considered an essential part of the evidence. Incompetent interpretation, or simply failure to swear in the interpreter, can lead to a mistrial.

===Escort interpreter===

In escort interpreting, an interpreter accompanies a person or a delegation on a tour, on a visit, or to a business meeting or interview. An interpreter in this role is called an &quot;escort interpreter&quot; or an &quot;escorting interpreter&quot;. An escort interpreter&#x27;s work session may run for days, weeks, or even months, depending on the period of the client&#x27;s visit. This type of interpreting is often needed in business contexts, during presentations, investor meetings, and business negotiations. As such, an escort interpreter needs to be equipped with some business and financial knowledge in order to best understand and convey messages back and forth.

Signed language interpreters typically refer to this role as a &quot;designated interpreter.&quot; It is not a new practice; since the 1960s, deaf professionals and academics such as Robert Sanderson increasingly sought out and trained specific interpreters to work with on a regular, if not exclusive basis.

===Public sector===
Also known as community interpreting, is the type of interpreting occurring in fields such as legal, health, and federal and local government, social, housing, environmental health, education, and welfare services. In community interpreting, factors exist which determine and affect language and communication production, such as speech&#x27;s emotional content, hostile or polarized social surroundings, its created stress, the power relationships among participants, and the interpreter&#x27;s degree of responsibility – in many cases more than extreme; in some cases, even the life of the other person depends upon the interpreter&#x27;s work.

===Medical===
Medical interpreting is a subset of public service interpreting, consisting of communication among healthcare personnel and the patient and their family or among Healthcare personnel speaking different languages, facilitated by an interpreter, usually formally educated and qualified to provide such interpretation services. In some situations, medical employees who are multilingual may participate part-time as members of internal language banks. Depending on country/state-specific requirements, the interpreter is often required to have some knowledge of medical terminology, common procedures, the patient interview and exam process. Medical interpreters are often cultural liaisons for people (regardless of language) who are unfamiliar with or uncomfortable in hospital, clinical, or medical settings.

For example, in China, there is no mandatory certificate for medical interpreters as of 2012. Most interpretation in hospitals in China is done by doctors, who are proficient in both Chinese and English (mostly) in his/her specialty. They interpret more in academic settings than for communications between doctors and patients. When a patient needs English language service in a Chinese hospital, more often than not the patient will be directed to a staff member in the hospital, who is recognized by his/her colleagues as proficient in English. The actual quality of such service for patients or medical interpretation for communications between doctors speaking different languages is unknown by the interpreting community as interpreters who lack Healthcare background rarely receive accreditation for medical interpretation in the medical community. Interpreters working in the Healthcare setting may be considered Allied Health Professionals.

In the United States, language access is a socioeconomic disparity, and language access to federally-funded health services is required by law. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any program or activity that receives Federal funds or other Federal financial assistance. Hospital systems and clinics that are funded by federal programs, such as Medicare, are required by this law to take reasonable steps towards ensuring equitable access to health services for limited English proficient patients.

===Military interpreting===

Interpreters are often used in a military context, carrying out interpretation usually either during active military combat or during noncombat operations. Interpretation is one of the main factors in multi-national and multi-lingual cooperation and military cohesion of the military and civilian populations.

During inactive military operations, the most common goal of military interpreters is to increase overall cohesion in the military unit, and with the civilian population. One of the primary forces behind the feeling of an occupation is a lack of mutual intelligibility. During the War in Afghanistan, the use of American soldiers that did not speak the languages of Afghanistan, and the primary recruitment from northern Afghanistan, primarily Tajiks, led to a feeling of the United States and Tajik forces as an occupying force. This feeling was most common in majority Pashtun areas of the country, which in turn was one of the main causes of the Taliban&#x27;s resurgence. If interpreters are not present inside war zones, it becomes extremely common for misunderstandings from the civilian population and a military force to spiral into an open conflict, or to produce animosity and distrust, forming the basis of a conflict or an insurgency.

Military interpreters are commonly found in Iraq and have been largely effective, particularly in the Kurdish held regions (Kurdistan Regional Government), during the fighting against ISIS. Military interpreters were the primary drivers in cooperation between the coalition and the Iraqi population and military. Likewise managing to produce stability in areas held by the coalition, Kurdish interpreters were known for being a primary aid in this endeavour.

The fundamental act of interpreting during active combat is extremely stressful and dangerous. It is, however, necessary when different-language battalions are fighting together with no common intermediate language. Misunderstandings in this context are most often fatal, the most common misinterpretations are positioning and attempted break outs. In the chaos of combat, however, it can be very easy to make a mistake in interpreting, particularly with the immense noise and changing locations.

Military interpreters are also used within single armies instead of multi-lingual cooperation. In this context, a military interpreter is usually a given job in each unit. Common examples include Bosnia, Pakistan, Switzerland, and South Africa. This use of assigning soldiers with different languages to a single battalion helps reinforce a feeling of unity in the military force.

=== Sign language ===


A sign language interpreter conveys messages between combinations of spoken and signed languages and manual systems. This may be between deaf signers and hearing nonsigners, or among users of different signed languages and manual systems. This may be done in simultaneous or consecutive modes, or as sight translation from printed text.

Interpreters may be hearing, hard of hearing, or deaf, and work in teams of any combination, depending upon the circumstance or audience. Historically, deaf interpreters or DIs work with DeafBlind people who use either close vision or Protactile signing, deaf people with nonstandard, emerging, or idiolect language varieties, affinity or cultural groups within the Deaf community, minors, immigrants of a different signed language, users of a minority signed language, participants in medical, carceral, or legal matters, and persons with cognitive or intellectual disabilities. DIs may work in relay teams with hearing interpreters, from a teleprompter, or with another DI to access the source language. DIs are commonly the member of the team visible on camera or on stage at televised, recorded, or public events.

Interpreters can be formally trained in postsecondary programs and receive a certificate, associates, bachelors, masters, or doctoral degree. In some circumstances, lay interpreters take an experiential route through churches, families, and social networks. Formal interpreter education practices are largely the product of twentieth-century developments.

In the United States, Sign Language interpreters have national- and some states have state-level certifications. The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID), a non-profit organization, is known for its national recognition and certification process. In addition to training requirements and stringent certification testing, RID members must abide by a Code of Professional Conduct, Grievance Process and Continuing Education Requirement. There are many interpreter-training programs in the U.S. The Collegiate Commission on Interpreter Education is the body that accredits Interpreter Preparation Programs. A list of accredited programs can be found on the CCIE web site.

Some countries have more than one national association due to regional or language differences. National associations can become members of the umbrella organizations, the World Association of Sign Language Interpreters or the European Forum of Sign Language Interpreters (efsli). In Canada, the professional association that recognizes and nationally certifies sign language interpreters is the Association of Visual Language Interpreters of Canada (AVLIC). Under AVLIC holds several affiliate chapters representing a specified region of Canada.

Sign language interpreters encounter a number of linguistic, environmental, interpersonal and intrapersonal factors that can have an effect on their ability to provide accurate interpretation. Studies have found that most interpreter training programs do not sufficiently prepare students for the highly variable day-to-day stresses that an interpreter must manage, and there is an ongoing conversation in the interpreting field as to how to appropriately prepare students for the challenges of the job. Proposed changes include having a more robust definition of what a qualified interpreter should know, as well as a post-graduate internship structure that would allow new interpreters to work with the benefit of supervision from more experienced interpreters, much like the programs in place in medicine, law enforcement, etc.

In Israel, Naama Weiss, a board member of Malach, the Organization of the Israeli Sign Language Interpreters, advertised a video which she produced. It was her paraphrase of the video &quot;So-Low&quot;, and showed her viewpoint upon the Israeli Sign Language interpreters&#x27; jobs. A study which was made in Finland found that, in comparison to the foreign language teachers and non-linguistic experts, a high cooperativeness was found to be more characteristic to simultaneous and consecutive interpreters, and Weiss showed it in her video, although she claimed to be comic.

The World Federation of the Deaf asserts that computer-generated signing avatars &quot;do not surpass the natural quality and skill provided by appropriately trained and qualified interpreters,&quot; and approves their application only &quot;for pre-recorded static customer information, for example, in hotels or train stations&quot;. The WFD statement concedes to such a project only if &quot;deaf people have been involved in advising,&quot; and it does not intend to replace human interpreters. Quality and naturalness of movements are closely critiqued by sign-fluent viewers, particularly those who began signing at a younger age.

===Media===
By its very nature, media interpreting has to be conducted in the simultaneous mode. It is provided particularly for live television coverages such as press conferences, live or taped interviews with political figures, musicians, artists, sportsmen or people from the business circle. In this type of interpreting, the interpreter has to sit in a sound-proof booth where ideally he/she can see the speakers on a monitor and the set. All equipment should be checked before recording begins. In particular, satellite connections have to be double-checked to ensure that the interpreter&#x27;s voice is not sent back and the interpreter gets to hear only one channel at a time. In the case of interviews recorded outside the studio and some current affairs program, the interpreter interprets what they hear on a TV monitor. Background noise can be a serious problem. The interpreter working for the media has to sound as slick and confident as a television presenter.

Media interpreting has gained more visibility and presence especially after the Gulf War. Television channels have begun to hire staff simultaneous interpreters. The interpreter renders the press conferences, telephone beepers, interviews and similar live coverage for the viewers. It is more stressful than other types of interpreting as the interpreter has to deal with a wide range of technical problems coupled with the control room&#x27;s hassle and wrangling during live coverage.

==Modalities==

Interpreting services can be delivered in multiple modalities. The most common modality through which interpreting services are provided is on-site interpreting.

===On-site===

Also called &quot;in-person&quot; and &quot;face-to-face&quot; or &quot;F2F&quot; interpreting, this traditional method requires the interpreter be physically present. With the growth of remote settings, having interpreters on-site remains crucial in high-stakes medical, legal, and diplomatic situations, and with socially, intellectually, or emotionally vulnerable clients.

===Telephone===

Also referred to as &quot;over-the-phone interpreting&quot;, &quot;telephonic interpreting&quot;, and &quot;tele-interpreting&quot;, telephone interpreting enables interpretation via telephone. Telephone interpreting can be used in community settings as well as conference settings. Telephone interpreting may be used in place of on-site interpreting when no on-site interpreter is readily available at the location where services are needed. However, it is more commonly used for situations in which all parties who wish to communicate are already speaking to one another via telephone (e.g. telephone applications for insurance or credit cards, or telephone inquiries from consumers to businesses).

===Video===

Interpretation services via video remote interpreting (VRI) or a video relay service (VRS) are useful for spoken language barriers where visual-cultural recognition is relevant, and even more applicable where one of the parties is deaf, hard-of-hearing or speech-impaired (mute). In such cases the direction of interpretation is normally within the same principal language, such as French Sign Language (FSL) to spoken French and Spanish Sign Language (SSL) to spoken Spanish. Multilingual sign language interpreters, who can also interpret as well across principal languages (such as to and from SSL, to and from spoken English), are also available, albeit less frequently. Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the interpreter, since sign languages are distinct natural languages with their own construction and syntax, different from the aural version of the same principal language.

With video interpreting, sign language interpreters work remotely with live video and audio feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, converse with the hearing party and vice versa. Much like telephone interpreting, video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRI and VRS interpretation requires all parties to have the necessary equipment. Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera, in order to zoom in and out, and to point the camera toward the party that is signing.

==Venues==
The majority of professional full-time conference interpreters work for phone interpreting agencies, health care institutions, courts, school systems and international organizations like the United Nations (for the United Nations Interpretation Service), the European Union, or the African Union.

The world&#x27;s largest employer of interpreters is currently the European Commission, which employs hundreds of staff and freelance interpreters working into the official languages of the European Union and some others in DG Interpretation. In 2016, Florika Fink-Hooijer was appointed as Director General and the first ever Knowledge Centre on Interpretation was created. She had spoken about the need to &quot;futureproof&quot; services by strengthening the skills of colleagues to work with new technologies as well as how artificial intelligence may be an (un)desired revolution in linguistic services. Subsequently, she drove forward the digitalization of the service by introducing features like automatic speech recognition and other support services to interpreters. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she scaled up multilingual interpretation in hybrid meetings via new digital platforms and technologies, which was a &quot;watershed moment&quot; for the interpretation profession.

The European Union&#x27;s other institutions (the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice) have smaller interpreting services.

The United Nations employs interpreters at almost all its sites throughout the world. Because it has only six official languages, however, it is a smaller employer than the European Union.

Interpreters may also work as freelance operators in their local, regional and national communities, or may take on contract work under an interpreting business or service. They would typically take on work as described above.

Militaries often use interpreters to better communicate with the local population. One notable example is the US military during the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.

==Associations==
There are a number of interpreting and translation associations around the world, including the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters, the International Association of Conference Interpreters, the China Accreditation Test for Translators and Interpreters, the Canadian Translators, the Terminologists and Interpreters Council, the Institute of Translation and Interpreting, the Argentine Association of Conference Interpreters, and the American Association of Language Specialists.

==Certifications==

No worldwide testing or certification agency exists for all types of interpreters. For conference interpretation, there is the International Association of Conference Interpreters.

Specific regions, countries, or even cities will have their own certification standards. In many cases, graduates of a certain caliber university program acts as a de facto certification for conference interpretation.

===China===

The most recognized interpretation and translation certificate in the People&#x27;s Republic of China is the China Accreditation Test for Translation and Interpretation (CATTI). Entrusted by China&#x27;s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, it is a translation and interpretation professional qualification accreditation test that is implemented throughout the country according to uniform standards, in order to assess examinees&#x27; bilingual translation or interpretation capability.
CATTI was introduced in 2003. In later 2013, translation and interpreting tests of different levels in English, French, Japanese, Russian, German, Spanish and Arabic were held across the nation.

Those examinees who pass CATTI and obtain translation and interpretation certificates acquire corresponding translation and interpretation professional titles.
* Senior translator or interpreter – professor of translation or interpretation
* Level 1 translator or interpreter – associate professor of translation or interpretation
* Level 2 translator or interpreter – translator or interpreter
* Level 3 translator or interpreter – assistant translator or interpreter

Relevant institutions from Australia, France, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and other countries as well as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan have established work ties with CATTI.

===Germany===

In Germany, anyone can become and call themselves an interpreter; access to this profession is not regulated, but court interpreters must be sworn in and prove their qualifications, e.g. through a recognized certificate or professional experience of several years.

In order to learn and practice the necessary skills, colleges and universities offer studies in Translation and/or Interpretation Studies, primarily to/from English, but there are also Sign Language Interpretation studies.
Admission to higher education, however, is highly restricted.

Some states offer a State Examination title .
Unlike a bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degree, this certificate merely &quot;certifies&quot; professional skills.
Access to the exam is far easier, but requires proof of the necessary skills.
For that, there are private schools that offer preparatory courses.
Attending these schools is usually sufficient to prove someone&#x27;s aptitude.
Of course, a university or college degree is accepted, too.

Furthermore, the State Examination is offered in &quot;many more&quot; languages, including German Sign Language, yet primarily to/from German.

<text>Amelia Lyn &quot;Amy&quot; Acuff (born July 14, 1975) is a track and field athlete from the United States. A high jump specialist, she competed in the 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games as a member of USA Track and Field. Her best Olympic performance came at the 2004 Games, where her jump of 1.99 m earned her fourth place in the final.

==Biography==
Born in Port Arthur, Texas, she established herself domestically with wins at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 1995 and 1997. At the age of 22, she became the Universiade champion, edging out Monica Iagăr in the 1997 high jump final. Acuff was the winner of the 1998 Hochsprung mit Musik meeting in Arnstadt, Germany, becoming the first non-European winner in the history of the event. She went on to win at the national championships in 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007. Six national championships, all in odd numbered years.

Her personal best is 2.01 m, which she achieved at the Weltklasse Golden League international track and field meet in Zürich, Switzerland, on August 15, 2003. She finished 4th place at that high jump competition.

During the 2004 Olympic final, she was in bronze medal position through 1.99m. At 2.02m, after Vita Styopina cleared her lifetime personal best on her first attempt, Acuff strategically chose to pass at what would have been her personal best just to equal Styopina and retain bronze medal position. At the time, American television commentator Dwight Stones said &quot;That is a decision she will think about the rest of her life.&quot;

While in high school in 1993 she was named the national Girl&#x27;s &quot;High School Athlete of the Year&quot; by Track and Field News.

Her 1.95m at the Texas Relays at age 36 on March 31, 2012, should qualify as the W35 American Masters record.

Just 17 days before her 40th birthday, on June 28, 2015, Acuff placed third at the USATF track championships in Eugene, Oregon, potentially qualifying her for 2015&#x27;s US delegation to the world championships in Beijing, however she needed jump of 1.94 meters, the qualifying standard. She, and all of the other American women, were ultimately unable to meet this standard and could not compete in Beijing.

She was Inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame, Class of 2015.

==Modeling==
Amy Acuff is also known for her career as a model. She was the subject of modeling projects, media stories, and photography relating to her sports career as a track and field athlete. Acuff was even featured on national television commercials. A new challenge was taken in 1999 as she successfully organized the making of the &quot;2000 Omnilite Millennium Calendar of Champions&quot;, which featured nude/semi-nude photographs of Acuff and 11 other U.S. female track and field stars, with half the proceeds going to the Florence Griffith-Joyner Youth Foundation.

Acuff&#x27;s cover appearances include:
* &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Women of Summer: Strength &amp; Beauty: A Portfolio of America&#x27;s 10 Sexiest Athletes&quot;
* Men&#x27;s magazines, such as &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;FHM&quot;
* The 2004 Olympics were noted for the large number of female Olympians who posed nude—following in the footsteps of the 2000 Matildas and the Omni calendar. Of the 2004 examples the most visible was Acuff&#x27;s appearance on the cover and within &quot;Playboy&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The Women of the Olympics&quot; issue.
* Acuff appears across the top of the title for &quot;The Complete Book of the Olympics: 2008 Edition&quot;.

==Personal life==
Acuff graduated from Calallen High School in Corpus Christi, Texas. She attended UCLA and was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 2007. Acuff went on to study at the Academy of Oriental Medicine in Austin, Texas, and become a licensed acupuncturist.

She is distantly related to country musician Roy Acuff (her grandfather&#x27;s second cousin).

She is married to Tye Harvey, a retired pole vaulter. They have a daughter, Elsa.
In addition to being a model, Acuff is also an artist with work on display with the Art of the Olympians.

<doc id="899961" wikidata="Q1902998" url="?curid=899961" title="Martell (cognac)">
<text>Martell is a cognac house founded in 1715 by Jean Martell. It is the oldest of the &quot;big four&quot; cognac houses (the others are Hennessy, Rémy Martin and Courvoisier), who together produce most of the world&#x27;s cognac. Formerly owned by the Seagram spirits empire, it is now part of the Martell Mumm Perrier-Jouët (MMPJ) subsidiary of the French wines and spirits conglomerate Pernod Ricard. Martell&#x27;s flagship Cordon Bleu, introduced in 1912, was for many years the world&#x27;s highest-selling premium cognac.

By 2015 Martell was producing around 14 million bottles of its cognacs a year, making it the world&#x27;s second-largest cognac producer behind Hennessy.

==History==

Jean Martell, a young merchant, was born on the island of Jersey in 1694. It was then a location known for smuggling, which may have led to his involvement in the liquor trade. In 1715 he began his own trading business at Gatebourse in Cognac, on the banks of the Charente, and thus founded one of the first cognac houses. Variations of the logo he chose, a swift in combination with the Martell family coat of arms, have been in use ever since.

Martell used grapes from the vineyards in the Borderie subregion for his &quot;eaux-de-vie&quot;, and Tronçais oak for its casks, a combination that resulted in an exceptionally smooth cognac. After the founder&#x27;s death in 1753, Jean Martell&#x27;s widow and then his two sons and grandson continued this tradition. They also developed an export business, and by 1814 Martell was the most consumed brandy in England. In 1831, Martell created its first V.S.O.P. cognac. The use of English-language designations like &quot;very superior old pale&quot; and &quot;extra old&quot; reflected aged cognac&#x27;s status as primarily an export product.

In 1795 a marriage between the Hennessy and Martell families cemented a strategic alliance that created an effective duopoly in the cognac market. Another marriage followed in 1865. While still in competition, the two companies also made joint decisions, for example introducing the star grading system at the same time. This semi-formal relationship was dissolved in 1947 after the death of Maurice Firino-Martell.

In 1912 the marque launched Martell Cordon Bleu at the Hôtel de Paris, its first post-phylloxera cognac. While sold without designation (Martell XO is a distinct product), it is regarded as the oldest XO equivalent cognac still in production, and is widely credited as the first mass-market premium cognac. Martell Cordon Bleu was served at the coronation of George V, on the maiden voyage of the , and on board the Concorde.

In 1987, Seagram took control of Martell in a deal worth around $600 million, reportedly attracted by cognac&#x27;s high profit margin. According to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, Seagram largely neglected the brand, and while other cognac producers experienced a boom in the 1990s, driven by increased consumption among African Americans, Martell&#x27;s sales declined. By 1998 it was selling less cognac in the United States than all of the other big four producers.

Seagram was broken up in 2001, and Martell was acquired by Pernod Ricard. Pernod repositioned the brand, making efforts to attract new consumers with multiple new product lines: Martell XO (released 2005), Martell Création Grand Extra (released 2007, in a bottle designed by the artist and glass designer Serge Mansau), L&#x27;Or de Jean Martell (released 2009). In 2011 the marque Martell expanded into an &quot;ultra-prestige&quot; range with Martell Chanteloup Perspective, a tribute to the know-how of the cellar masters and to the Domaine de Chanteloup.

In 2006, Martell joined the Comité Colbert, an association that promotes French luxury houses on an international scale.

In 2010, Martell renewed its sponsorship with the Palace of Versailles, which began in 2007, by supporting the restoration of the Queen&#x27;s antechamber.

==Products==

Martell selects crus from the Cognac region: Les Borderies, Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne and Fins Bois.

* Martell Noblige Cognac

* Martell XO
* Martell Chanteloup

* Martell Cohiba
* Martell L’Or de Jean
* Martell Blue Swift

==Marketing==
Martell sponsored the Grand National horse race between 1992 and 2004.

Like its chief rival Hennessy, Martell has targeted African American consumers in the United States. In 2022, it teamed with Janelle Monáe in a campaign celebrating black mixologists.

==In popular culture==
A bottle of Martell Cordon Bleu can be seen in the opening scene of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979), on the bedside table of Captain Willard (played by Martin Sheen).

The &quot;Poe Toaster&quot; is the name given to a mysterious figure who, formerly, would visit the site of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s original grave in Baltimore on the anniversary of the writer&#x27;s death. He would pour a glass of Martell and raise a toast. He then would arrange three red roses on the monument in a distinctive configuration and depart, leaving the unfinished bottle. Several of the Martell bottles are kept at the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum in Baltimore.

<doc id="899965" wikidata="Q4745039" url="?curid=899965" title="American Society for Quality">
<text>The American Society for Quality (ASQ), formerly the American Society for Quality Control (ASQC), is a society of quality professionals, with more than 40,000 members.

ASQ is a global organization with members in more than 140 countries. ASQ operates regional centers in North Asia, South Asia, and Latin America, and has established strategic alliances with organizations through the World Partners® Program in countries like Japan, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates to promote ASQ products and training.

==History==
ASQC was established on 16 February 1946 by 253 members in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with George D. Edwards as its first president. The organization was first created as a way for quality experts and manufacturers to sustain quality-improvement techniques used during World War II.

In 1948, ASQC&#x27;s Code of Ethics establishes standards for members to conduct their activities and business. Business writer Armand V. Feigenbaum served as president of the society in 1961–63.

In 1997, the members of the organization voted to change its name from &quot;American Society for Quality Control&quot; to &quot;American Society for Quality&quot;.

== Quality ==
ASQ provides its members with certification, training, publications, conferences, and other services. ASQ is a founding partner of the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), a quarterly economic indicator.

Since 1989, ASQ has administered the annual Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. The ASQ also gives the Dorian Shainin Medal, which is awarded annually for the &quot;Development and Application of Creative or Unique Statistical Approaches in the Solving of Problems Relative to the Quality of Product or Service&quot;.

==Certifications==
ASQ offers 18 professional certifications relating to various aspects of the quality profession. Professional certification exams are translated into five languages included English, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, and Spanish. Exams are given nationally and, to a limited degree, worldwide several times annually. The body of knowledge for each certification is maintained through peer review every few years on a rotating schedule.

In 1968, the first ASQ certification was offered.

In 2016, ASQ&#x27;s certification exam delivery method changed from paper to computer-based testing at Prometric nationwide testing facilities.

== Publications ==
ASQ publishes a range of magazines and journals:

* &quot;Quality Progress&quot;
* &quot;Journal for Quality and Participation&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Quality Technology&quot;
* &quot;Quality Engineering&quot;
* &quot;Quality Management Journal&quot;

<text>West Cambridge is a university site to the west of Cambridge city centre in England. As part of the &quot;West Cambridge Master Plan&quot;, several of the University of Cambridge&#x27;s departments have relocated to the West Cambridge site from the centre of town due to overcrowding. A number of other research institutions also have buildings on the site.

== Layout ==
The West Cambridge site covers the area between the M11 motorway, Madingley Road, Clerk Maxwell Road and the Coton Footpath. The area currently contains some open fields and a small lake. As well as number of university departments and private research institutions, the site also has residential areas and a restaurant. The roads on the site are named after the famous Cambridge scientists. The Institute of Astronomy is located just to the north of the site, while the Centre for Mathematical Sciences is to the east.

=== Buildings ===
== Future development ==
Preparation for the construction of a new Cavendish laboratory (Cavendish III) has begun and it is expected to be completed by 2021/2022. Planning permission has also been granted for the construction of the Civil Engineering Building (CEB) due to be completed in spring 2019.

== Conservation ==
The West Cambridge site is also of conservation importance. The area is host to a number of native species, including barn owls, the grey partridge, badgers, grass snakes and various amphibians. RPS have been conducting surveys on the site since 2003. In order to preserve and develop habitats on the site, a number of ponds are maintained and the roofs of some buildings are covered with plants such as sedum. Landscape management is also employed to create and maintain hedgerows and ditches.

== Archaeology ==

An ancient Roman settlement dominates the archaeology of the site, but smaller, prehistoric and medieval use has also been documented. Investigations and excavations were conducted between 1999 and 2000, and the site was opened to the public as part of National Science Week and followed by a Schools&#x27; Week. During the investigations, over 3000 excavations were made and around 50,000 finds retrieved. Some of these are on display in the William Gates Building.

=== Prehistoric activity ===
A number of Stone Age flints and Iron Age pottery pits were discovered. Analysis is continuing into other possible prehistoric features.

=== Roman settlement ===
A series of regular enclosures and semi-open Roman fields dominate the site. Also present were two timber buildings, some quarry pits and two cemeteries, featuring forty burials, plus five isolated burials. This settlement seems to be part of a much larger system that probably formed a ring around the Roman town. Current understanding suggests that the site was in use, in various stages, from the late 1st to early 5th centuries.

Some unusual features have also been documented, including a cache of 3rd-century coins and an enclosure containing butchered animal carcasses apparently for some ritualistic purpose. Deposits of horse and cattle remains mark the entrance of one of the cemeteries. Finds from this period include spearheads, brooches, coins, pottery and a copper bust of possibly Minerva or Pallas Athena.

=== Later use ===
The site was abandoned in the 5th century AD, with no further activity until the late medieval period when ploughing began. A dyke was constructed known as &quot;Willowes Ditch&quot;, which is marked on 14th-century maps. No other development is apparent until the construction of Vicars Farm in the 19th century.

<text>The definition of the term &quot;planet&quot; has changed several times since the word was coined by the ancient Greeks. Greek astronomers employed the term (), &#x27;wandering stars&#x27;, for star-like objects which apparently moved over the sky. Over the millennia, the term has included a variety of different celestial bodies, from the Sun and the Moon to satellites and asteroids.

In modern astronomy, there are two primary conceptions of a &quot;planet&quot;. A &quot;planet&quot; can be an astronomical body that &quot;dynamically dominates&quot; its region (that is, whether it controls the fate of other smaller bodies in its vicinity) or it is defined to be in &quot;hydrostatic equilibrium&quot; (it has become gravitationally rounded and compacted). These may be characterized as the dynamical dominance definition and the geophysical definition.

The issue of a clear definition for &quot;planet&quot; came to a head in January 2005 with the discovery of the trans-Neptunian object Eris, a body more massive than the smallest then-accepted planet, Pluto. In its August 2006 response, the International Astronomical Union (IAU), which is recognised by astronomers as the international governing body responsible for resolving issues of nomenclature, released its decision on the matter during a meeting in Prague. This definition, proposed by uruguayan astronomers Julio Ángel Fernández and Gonzalo Tancredi, which applies only to the Solar System (though exoplanets had been addressed in 2003), states that a planet is a body that orbits the Sun, is massive enough for its own gravity to make it round, and has &quot;cleared its neighbourhood&quot; of smaller objects approaching its orbit. Pluto fulfills the first two of these criteria, but not the third and therefore does not qualify as a planet under this formalized definition. The IAU&#x27;s decision has not resolved all controversies. While many astronomers have accepted it, some planetary scientists have rejected it outright, proposing a geophysical or similar definition instead.

== History ==
=== Planets in antiquity ===

While knowledge of the planets predates history and is common to most civilizations, the word &quot;planet&quot; dates back to ancient Greece. Most Greeks believed the Earth to be stationary and at the center of the universe in accordance with the geocentric model and that the objects in the sky, and indeed the sky itself, revolved around it (an exception was Aristarchus of Samos, who put forward an early version of heliocentrism). Greek astronomers employed the term (), &#x27;wandering stars&#x27;, to describe those starlike lights in the heavens that moved over the course of the year, in contrast to the (), the &#x27;fixed stars&#x27;, which stayed motionless relative to one another. The five bodies currently called &quot;planets&quot; that were known to the Greeks were those visible to the naked eye: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

Graeco-Roman cosmology commonly considered seven planets, with the Sun and the Moon counted among them (as is the case in modern astrology); however, there is some ambiguity on that point, as many ancient astronomers distinguished the five star-like planets from the Sun and Moon. As the 19th-century German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt noted in his work &quot;Cosmos&quot;,

Of the seven cosmical bodies which, by their continually varying relative positions and distances apart, have ever since the remotest antiquity been distinguished from the &quot;unwandering orbs&quot; of the heaven of the &quot;fixed stars&quot;, which to all sensible appearance preserve their relative positions and distances unchanged, five only—Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn—wear the appearance of stars—&quot;cinque stellas errantes&quot;—while the Sun and Moon, from the size of their disks, their importance to man, and the place assigned to them in mythological systems, were classed apart.
In his &quot;Timaeus&quot;, written in roughly 360 BCE, Plato mentions, &quot;the Sun and Moon and five other stars, which are called the planets&quot;. His student Aristotle makes a similar distinction in his &quot;On the Heavens&quot;: &quot;The movements of the sun and moon are fewer than those of some of the planets&quot;. In his &quot;Phaenomena&quot;, which set to verse an astronomical treatise written by the philosopher Eudoxus in roughly 350 BCE, the poet Aratus describes &quot;those five other orbs, that intermingle with [the constellations] and wheel wandering on every side of the twelve figures of the Zodiac.&quot;

In his &quot;Almagest&quot; written in the 2nd century, Ptolemy refers to &quot;the Sun, Moon and five planets.&quot; Hyginus explicitly mentions &quot;the five stars which many have called wandering, and which the Greeks call Planeta.&quot; Marcus Manilius, a Latin writer who lived during the time of Caesar Augustus and whose poem &quot;Astronomica&quot; is considered one of the principal texts for modern astrology, says, &quot;Now the dodecatemory is divided into five parts, for so many are the stars called wanderers which with passing brightness shine in heaven.&quot;

The single view of the seven planets is found in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Dream of Scipio&quot;, written sometime around 53 BCE, where the spirit of Scipio Africanus proclaims, &quot;Seven of these spheres contain the planets, one planet in each sphere, which all move contrary to the movement of heaven.&quot; In his &quot;Natural History&quot;, written in 77 CE, Pliny the Elder refers to &quot;the seven stars, which owing to their motion we call planets, though no stars wander less than they do.&quot; Nonnus, the 5th century Greek poet, says in his &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, &quot;I have oracles of history on seven tablets, and the tablets bear the names of the seven planets.&quot;

=== Planets in the Middle Ages ===

Medieval and Renaissance writers generally accepted the idea of seven planets. The standard medieval introduction to astronomy, Sacrobosco&#x27;s &quot;De Sphaera&quot;, includes the Sun and Moon among the planets, the more advanced &quot;Theorica planetarum&quot; presents the &quot;theory of the seven planets,&quot; while the instructions to the &quot;Alfonsine Tables&quot; show how &quot;to find by means of tables the mean &quot;motuses&quot; of the sun, moon, and the rest of the planets.&quot; In his &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;, 14th-century poet John Gower, referring to the planets&#x27; connection with the craft of alchemy, writes, &quot;Of the planetes ben begonne/The gold is tilted to the Sonne/The Mone of Selver hath his part...&quot;, indicating that the Sun and the Moon were planets. Even Nicolaus Copernicus, who rejected the geocentric model, was ambivalent concerning whether the Sun and Moon were planets. In his &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot;, Copernicus clearly separates &quot;the sun, moon, planets and stars&quot;; however, in his Dedication of the work to Pope Paul III, Copernicus refers to, &quot;the motion of the sun and the moon... and of the five other planets.&quot;

=== Earth ===
When Copernicus&#x27;s heliocentric model was accepted over the geocentric, Earth was placed among the planets and the Sun and Moon were reclassified, necessitating a conceptual revolution in the understanding of planets. As the historian of science Thomas Kuhn noted in his book, &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;:

The Copernicans who denied its traditional title &#x27;planet&#x27; to the sun ... were changing the meaning of &#x27;planet&#x27; so that it would continue to make useful distinctions in a world where all celestial bodies ... were seen differently from the way they had been seen before... Looking at the moon, the convert to Copernicanism ... says, &#x27;I once took the moon to be (or saw the moon as) a planet, but I was mistaken.&#x27;

Copernicus obliquely refers to Earth as a planet in &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot; when he says, &quot;Having thus assumed the motions which I ascribe to the Earth later on in the volume, by long and intense study I finally found that if the motions of the other planets are correlated with the orbiting of the earth...&quot; Galileo also asserts that Earth is a planet in the &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot;: &quot;[T]he Earth, no less than the moon or any other planet, is to be numbered among the natural bodies that move circularly.&quot;

=== Modern planets ===

In 1781, the astronomer William Herschel was searching the sky for elusive stellar parallaxes when he observed what he termed a comet in the constellation of Taurus. Unlike stars, which remained mere points of light even under high magnification, this object&#x27;s size increased in proportion to the power used. That this strange object might have been a planet simply did not occur to Herschel; the five planets beyond Earth had been part of humanity&#x27;s conception of the universe since antiquity. As the asteroids had yet to be discovered, comets were the only moving objects one expected to find in a telescope. However, unlike a comet, this object&#x27;s orbit was nearly circular and within the ecliptic plane. Before Herschel announced his discovery of his &quot;comet,” his colleague, British Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, wrote to him, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it.&quot; The &quot;comet&quot; was also very far away, too far away for a mere comet to resolve itself. Eventually it was recognized as the seventh planet and named Uranus after the father of Saturn.

Gravitationally induced irregularities in Uranus&#x27;s observed orbit led eventually to the discovery of Neptune in 1846, and presumed irregularities in Neptune&#x27;s orbit subsequently led to a search which did not find the perturbing object (it was later found to be a mathematical artifact caused by an overestimation of Neptune&#x27;s mass) but did find Pluto in 1930. Initially believed to be roughly the mass of the Earth, observation gradually shrank Pluto&#x27;s estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large; far too small to have influenced Neptune&#x27;s orbit at all. In 1989, Voyager 2 determined the irregularities to be due to an overestimation of Neptune&#x27;s mass.

=== Satellites ===
When Copernicus placed Earth among the planets, he also placed the Moon in orbit around Earth, making the Moon the first natural satellite to be identified. When Galileo discovered his four satellites of Jupiter in 1610, they lent weight to Copernicus&#x27;s argument, because if other planets could have satellites, then Earth could too. However, there remained some confusion as to whether these objects were &quot;planets&quot;; Galileo referred to them as &quot;four planets flying around the star of Jupiter at unequal intervals and periods with wonderful swiftness.&quot; Similarly, Christiaan Huygens, upon discovering Saturn&#x27;s largest moon Titan in 1655, employed many terms to describe it, including &quot;planeta&quot; (planet), &quot;stella&quot; (star), &quot;luna&quot; (moon), and &quot;satellite&quot; (attendant), a word coined by Johannes Kepler. Giovanni Cassini, in announcing his discovery of Saturn&#x27;s moons Iapetus and Rhea in 1671 and 1672, described them as &quot;Nouvelles Planetes autour de Saturne&quot; (&quot;New planets around Saturn&quot;). However, when the &quot;Journal de Scavans&quot; reported Cassini&#x27;s discovery of two new Saturnian moons (Dione and Tethys) in 1686, it referred to them strictly as &quot;satellites&quot;, though sometimes Saturn as the &quot;primary planet&quot;. When William Herschel announced his discovery of two objects in orbit around Uranus in 1787 (Titania and Oberon), he referred to them as &quot;satellites&quot; and &quot;secondary planets&quot;. All subsequent reports of natural satellite discoveries used the term &quot;satellite&quot; exclusively, though the 1868 book &quot;Smith&#x27;s Illustrated Astronomy&quot; referred to satellites as &quot;secondary planets&quot;.

=== Minor planets ===

One of the unexpected results of William Herschel&#x27;s discovery of Uranus was that it appeared to validate Bode&#x27;s law, a mathematical function which generates the size of the semimajor axis of planetary orbits. Astronomers had considered the &quot;law&quot; a meaningless coincidence, but Uranus fell at very nearly the exact distance it predicted. Since Bode&#x27;s law also predicted a body between Mars and Jupiter that at that point had not been observed, astronomers turned their attention to that region in the hope that it might be vindicated again. Finally, in 1801, astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi found a miniature new world, Ceres, lying at just the correct point in space. The object was hailed as a new planet.

Then in 1802, Heinrich Olbers discovered Pallas, a second &quot;planet&quot; at roughly the same distance from the Sun as Ceres. The fact that two planets could occupy the same orbit was an affront to centuries of thinking. In 1804, another world, Juno, was discovered in a similar orbit. In 1807, Olbers discovered a fourth object, Vesta, at a similar orbital distance.

Herschel suggested that these four worlds be given their own separate classification, asteroids (meaning &quot;starlike&quot; since they were too small for their disks to resolve and thus resembled stars), though most astronomers preferred to refer to them as planets. This conception was entrenched by the fact that, due to the difficulty of distinguishing asteroids from yet-uncharted stars, those four remained the only asteroids known until 1845. Science textbooks in 1828, after Herschel&#x27;s death, still numbered the asteroids among the planets. With the arrival of more refined star charts, the search for asteroids resumed, and a fifth and sixth were discovered by Karl Ludwig Hencke in 1845 and 1847. By 1851 the number of asteroids had increased to 15, and a new method of classifying them, by affixing a number before their names in order of discovery, was adopted, inadvertently placing them in their own distinct category. Ceres became &quot;(1) Ceres&quot;, Pallas became &quot;(2) Pallas&quot;, and so on. By the 1860s, the number of known asteroids had increased to over a hundred, and observatories in Europe and the United States began referring to them collectively as &quot;minor planets&quot;, or &quot;small planets&quot;, though it took the first four asteroids longer to be grouped as such. To this day, &quot;minor planet&quot; remains the official designation for all small bodies in orbit around the Sun, and each new discovery is numbered accordingly in the IAU&#x27;s Minor Planet Catalogue.

=== Pluto ===

The long road from planethood to reconsideration undergone by Ceres is mirrored in the story of Pluto, which was named a planet soon after its discovery by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930. Uranus and Neptune had been declared planets based on their circular orbits, large masses and proximity to the ecliptic plane. None of these applied to Pluto, a tiny and icy world in a region of gas giants with an orbit that carried it high above the ecliptic and even inside that of Neptune. In 1978, astronomers discovered Pluto&#x27;s largest moon, Charon, which allowed them to determine its mass. Pluto was found to be much tinier than anyone had expected: only one-sixth the mass of Earth&#x27;s Moon. However, as far as anyone could yet tell, it was unique. Then, beginning in 1992, astronomers began to detect large numbers of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune that were similar to Pluto in composition, size, and orbital characteristics. They concluded that they had discovered the hypothesized Kuiper belt (sometimes called the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt), a band of icy debris that is the source for &quot;short-period&quot; comets—those with orbital periods of up to 200 years.

Pluto&#x27;s orbit lays within this band and thus its planetary status was thrown into question. Many scientists concluded that tiny Pluto should be reclassified as a minor planet, just as Ceres had been a century earlier. Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology suggested that a &quot;planet&quot; should be redefined as &quot;any body in the Solar System that is more massive than the total mass of all of the other bodies in a similar orbit.&quot; Those objects under that mass limit would become minor planets. In 1999, Brian G. Marsden of Harvard University&#x27;s Minor Planet Center suggested that Pluto be given the minor planet number 10000 while still retaining its official position as a planet. The prospect of Pluto&#x27;s &quot;demotion&quot; created a public outcry, and in response the International Astronomical Union clarified that it was not at that time proposing to remove Pluto from the planet list.

The discovery of several other trans-Neptunian objects, such as Quaoar and Sedna, continued to erode arguments that Pluto was exceptional from the rest of the trans-Neptunian population. On July 29, 2005, Mike Brown and his team announced the discovery of a trans-Neptunian object confirmed to be more massive than Pluto, named Eris.

In the immediate aftermath of the object&#x27;s discovery, there was much discussion as to whether it could be termed a &quot;tenth planet&quot;. NASA even put out a press release describing it as such. However, acceptance of Eris as the tenth planet implicitly demanded a definition of planet that set Pluto as an arbitrary minimum size. Many astronomers, claiming that the definition of planet was of little scientific importance, preferred to recognise Pluto&#x27;s historical identity as a planet by &quot;grandfathering&quot; it into the planet list.

== IAU definition ==
The discovery of Eris forced the IAU to act on a definition. In October 2005, a group of 19 IAU members, which had already been working on a definition since the discovery of Sedna in 2003, narrowed their choices to a shortlist of three, using approval voting. The definitions were:

* A planet is any object in orbit around the Sun with a diameter greater than 2,000 km. (Eleven votes in favor)
* A planet is any object in orbit around the Sun whose shape is stable due to its own gravity. (Eight votes in favor)
* A planet is any object in orbit around the Sun that is dominant in its immediate neighbourhood. (Six votes in favor)

Since no consensus could be reached, the committee decided to put these three definitions to a wider vote at the IAU General Assembly meeting in Prague in August 2006, and on August 24, the IAU put a final draft to a vote, written and proposed by uruguayan astronomers Julio Ángel Fernández and Gonzalo Tancredi, which combined elements from two of the three proposals. It essentially created a medial classification between &quot;planet&quot; and &quot;rock&quot; (or, in the new parlance, &quot;small Solar System body&quot;), called &quot;dwarf planet&quot; and placed Pluto in it, along with Ceres and Eris.

The vote was passed, with 424 astronomers taking part in the ballot. The IAU also resolved that &quot;&quot;planets&quot; and &quot;dwarf planets&quot; are two distinct classes of objects&quot;, meaning that dwarf planets, despite their name, would not be considered planets.

On September 13, 2006, the IAU placed Eris, its moon Dysnomia, and Pluto into their Minor Planet Catalogue, giving them the official minor planet designations (134340) Pluto, (136199) Eris, and (136199) Eris I Dysnomia. Other possible dwarf planets, such as 2003 EL61, 2005 FY9, Sedna and Quaoar, were left in temporary limbo until a formal decision could be reached regarding their status.

On June 11, 2008, the IAU executive committee announced the establishment of a subclass of dwarf planets comprising the aforementioned &quot;new category of trans-Neptunian objects&quot; to which Pluto is a prototype. This new class of objects, termed plutoids, would include Pluto, Eris and any other trans-Neptunian dwarf planets, but excluded Ceres. The IAU decided that those TNOs with an absolute magnitude brighter than +1 would be named by a joint commissions of the planetary and minor-planet naming committees, under the assumption that they were likely to be dwarf planets. To date, only two other TNOs, 2003 EL61 and 2005 FY9, have met the absolute magnitude requirement, while other possible dwarf planets, such as Sedna, Orcus and Quaoar, were named by the minor-planet committee alone. On July 11, 2008, the Working Group on Planetary Nomenclature named 2005 FY9 &quot;Makemake&quot;, and on September 17, 2008, they named 2003 EL61 &quot;Haumea&quot;.

== Acceptance of the IAU definition ==
Among the most vocal proponents of the IAU&#x27;s decided definition are Mike Brown, the discoverer of Eris; Steven Soter, professor of astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History; and Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium.

In the early 2000s, when the Hayden Planetarium was undergoing a $100 million renovation, Tyson refused to refer to Pluto as the ninth planet at the planetarium. He explained that he would rather group planets according to their commonalities rather than counting them. This decision resulted in Tyson receiving large amounts of hate mail, primarily from children. In 2009, Tyson wrote a book detailing the demotion of Pluto.

In an article in the January 2007 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, Soter cited the definition&#x27;s incorporation of current theories of the formation and evolution of the Solar System; that as the earliest protoplanets emerged from the swirling dust of the protoplanetary disc, some bodies &quot;won&quot; the initial competition for limited material and, as they grew, their increased gravity meant that they accumulated more material, and thus grew larger, eventually outstripping the other bodies in the Solar System by a very wide margin. The asteroid belt, disturbed by the gravitational tug of nearby Jupiter, and the Kuiper belt, too widely spaced for its constituent objects to collect together before the end of the initial formation period, both failed to win the accretion competition.

When the numbers for the winning objects are compared to those of the losers, the contrast is striking; if Soter&#x27;s concept that each planet occupies an &quot;orbital zone&quot; is accepted, then the least orbitally dominant planet, Mars, is larger than all other collected material in its orbital zone by a factor of 5100. Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt, only accounts for one third of the material in its orbit; Pluto&#x27;s ratio is even lower, at around 7 percent. Mike Brown asserts that this massive difference in orbital dominance leaves &quot;absolutely no room for doubt about which objects do and do not belong.&quot;

== Ongoing controversies ==
Despite the IAU&#x27;s declaration, a number of critics remain unconvinced. The definition is seen by some as arbitrary and confusing. A number of Pluto-as-planet proponents, in particular Alan Stern, head of NASA&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission to Pluto, have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter the definition. Stern&#x27;s claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Even with this controversy excluded, however, there remain several ambiguities in the definition.

=== Clearing the neighbourhood ===

One of the main points at issue is the precise meaning of &quot;cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit&quot;. Alan Stern objects that &quot;it is impossible and contrived to put a dividing line between dwarf planets and planets&quot;, and that since neither Earth, Mars, Jupiter, nor Neptune have entirely cleared their regions of debris, none could properly be considered planets under the IAU definition.
Mike Brown responds to these claims by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control the orbits of the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist with a large number of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter&#x27;s orbit because they are in the sway of the planet&#x27;s huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune&#x27;s gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.

In October 2015, astronomer Jean-Luc Margot of the University of California Los Angeles proposed a metric for orbital zone clearance derived from whether an object can clear an orbital zone of extent 2 of its Hill radius in a specific time scale. This metric places a clear dividing line between the dwarf planets and the planets of the solar system. The calculation is based on the mass of the host star, the mass of the body, and the orbital period of the body. An Earth-mass body orbiting a solar-mass star clears its orbit at distances of up to 400 astronomical units from the star. A Mars-mass body at the orbit of Pluto clears its orbit. This metric, which leaves Pluto as a dwarf planet, applies to both the Solar System and to extrasolar systems.

Some opponents of the definition have claimed that &quot;clearing the neighbourhood&quot; is an ambiguous concept. Mark Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and organiser of the petition, expressed this opinion to National Public Radio. He believes that the definition does not categorize a planet by composition or formation, but, effectively, by its location. He believes that a Mars-sized or larger object beyond the orbit of Pluto would not be considered a planet, because he believes that it would not have time to clear its orbit.

Brown notes, however, that were the &quot;clearing the neighbourhood&quot; criterion to be abandoned, the number of planets in the Solar System could rise from eight to more than 50, with hundreds more potentially to be discovered.

=== Hydrostatic equilibrium ===

The IAU&#x27;s definition mandates that planets be large enough for their own gravity to form them into a state of hydrostatic equilibrium; this means that they will reach a round, ellipsoidal shape. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into an ellipsoid. (None of the large objects of the Solar System are truly spherical. Many are spheroids, and several, such as the larger moons of Saturn and the dwarf planet , have been further distorted into ellipsoids by rapid rotation or tidal forces, but still in hydrostatic equilibrium.)

However, there is no precise point at which an object can be said to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium. As Soter noted in his article, &quot;how are we to quantify the degree of roundness that distinguishes a planet? Does gravity dominate such a body if its shape deviates from a spheroid by 10 percent or by 1 percent? Nature provides no unoccupied gap between round and non-round shapes, so any boundary would be an arbitrary choice.&quot; Furthermore, the point at which an object&#x27;s mass compresses it into an ellipsoid varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object. Objects made of ices, such as Enceladus and Miranda, assume that state more easily than those made of rock, such as Vesta and Pallas. Heat energy, from gravitational collapse, impacts, tidal forces such as orbital resonances, or radioactive decay, also factors into whether an object will be ellipsoidal or not; Saturn&#x27;s icy moon Mimas is ellipsoidal (though no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium), but Neptune&#x27;s larger moon Proteus, which is similarly composed but colder because of its greater distance from the Sun, is irregular. In addition, the much larger Iapetus is ellipsoidal but does not have the dimensions expected for its current speed of rotation, indicating that it was once in hydrostatic equilibrium but no longer is, and the same is true for Earth&#x27;s moon. Even Mercury, universally regarded as a planet, is not in hydrostatic equilibrium. Thus the IAU definition is not taken literally even by the IAU, as it includes Mercury as a planet; its requirement for hydrostatic equilibrium is in practice ignored in favour of a requirement for roundedness.

=== Double planets and moons ===

The definition specifically excludes satellites from the category of dwarf planet, though it does not directly define the term &quot;satellite&quot;. In the original draft proposal, an exception was made for Pluto and its largest satellite, Charon, which possess a barycenter outside the volume of either body. The initial proposal classified Pluto–Charon as a double planet, with the two objects orbiting the Sun in tandem. However, the final draft made clear that, even though they are similar in relative size, only Pluto would currently be classified as a dwarf planet.

However, some have suggested that the Moon nonetheless deserves to be called a planet. In 1975, Isaac Asimov noted that the timing of the Moon&#x27;s orbit is in tandem with the Earth&#x27;s own orbit around the Sun—looking down on the ecliptic, the Moon never actually loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the Sun in its own right.

Also many moons, even those that do not orbit the Sun directly, often exhibit features in common with true planets. There are 20 moons in the Solar System that are massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium (the so-called planetary-mass moons); they would be considered planets if only the physical parameters are considered. Both Jupiter&#x27;s moon Ganymede and Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan are larger than Mercury, and Titan even has a substantial atmosphere, thicker than the Earth&#x27;s. Moons such as Io and Triton demonstrate obvious and ongoing geological activity, and Ganymede has a magnetic field. Just as stars in orbit around other stars are still referred to as stars, some astronomers argue that objects in orbit around planets that share all their characteristics could also be called planets. Indeed, Mike Brown makes just such a claim in his dissection of the issue, saying:

It is hard to make a consistent argument that a 400 km iceball should count as a planet because it might have interesting geology, while a 5000 km satellite with a massive atmosphere, methane lakes, and dramatic storms [Titan] shouldn&#x27;t be put into the same category, whatever you call it.

However, he goes on to say that, &quot;For most people, considering round satellites (including our Moon) &#x27;planets&#x27; violates the idea of what a planet is.&quot;

Alan Stern has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term &quot;satellite planet&quot; for planetary-mass moons.

=== Extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs ===

The discovery since 1992 of extrasolar planets, or planet-sized objects around other stars ( such planets in planetary systems including multiple planetary systems as of ), has widened the debate on the nature of planethood in unexpected ways. Many of these planets are of considerable size, approaching the mass of small stars, while many newly discovered brown dwarfs are, conversely, small enough to be considered planets. The material difference between a low-mass star and a large gas giant is not clear-cut; apart from size and relative temperature, there is little to separate a gas giant like Jupiter from its host star. Both have similar overall compositions: hydrogen and helium, with trace levels of heavier elements in their atmospheres. The generally accepted difference is one of formation; stars are said to have formed from the &quot;top down&quot;, out of the gases in a nebula as they underwent gravitational collapse, and thus would be composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, while planets are said to have formed from the &quot;bottom up&quot;, from the accretion of dust and gas in orbit around the young star, and thus should have cores of silicates or ices. As yet it is uncertain whether gas giants possess such cores, though the &quot;Juno&quot; mission to Jupiter could resolve the issue. If it is indeed possible that a gas giant could form as a star does, then it raises the question of whether such an object should be considered an orbiting low-mass star rather than a planet.
Traditionally, the defining characteristic for starhood has been an object&#x27;s ability to fuse hydrogen in its core. However, stars such as brown dwarfs have always challenged that distinction. Too small to commence sustained hydrogen-1 fusion, they have been granted star status on their ability to fuse deuterium. However, due to the relative rarity of that isotope, this process lasts only a tiny fraction of the star&#x27;s lifetime, and hence most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusion long before their discovery. Binary stars and other multiple-star formations are common, and many brown dwarfs orbit other stars. Therefore, since they do not produce energy through fusion, they could be described as planets. Indeed, astronomer Adam Burrows of the University of Arizona claims that &quot;from the theoretical perspective, however different their modes of formation, extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs are essentially the same&quot;. Burrows also claims that such stellar remnants as white dwarfs should not be considered stars, a stance which would mean that an orbiting white dwarf, such as Sirius B, could be considered a planet. However, the current convention among astronomers is that any object massive enough to have possessed the capability to sustain atomic fusion during its lifetime and that is not a black hole should be considered a star.

The confusion does not end with brown dwarfs. María Rosa Zapatero Osorio et al. have discovered many objects in young star clusters of masses below that required to sustain fusion of any sort (currently calculated to be roughly 13 Jupiter masses). These have been described as &quot;free floating planets&quot; because current theories of Solar System formation suggest that planets may be ejected from their star systems altogether if their orbits become unstable. However, it is also possible that these &quot;free floating planets&quot; could have formed in the same manner as stars.
In 2003, a working group of the IAU released a position statement to establish a working definition as to what constitutes an extrasolar planet and what constitutes a brown dwarf. To date, it remains the only guidance offered by the IAU on this issue. The 2006 planet definition committee did not attempt to challenge it, or to incorporate it into their definition, claiming that the issue of defining a planet was already difficult to resolve without also considering extrasolar planets. This working definition was amended by the IAU&#x27;s Commission F2: Exoplanets and the Solar System in August 2018. The official working definition of an &quot;exoplanet&quot; is now as follows:

The IAU noted that this definition could be expected to evolve as knowledge improves.
This definition makes location, rather than formation or composition, the determining characteristic for planethood. A free-floating object with a mass below 13 Jupiter masses is a &quot;sub-brown dwarf&quot;, whereas such an object in orbit around a fusing star is a planet, even if, in all other respects, the two objects may be identical. Further, in 2010, a paper published by Burrows, David S. Spiegel and John A. Milsom called into question the 13-Jupiter-mass criterion, showing that a brown dwarf of three times solar metallicity could fuse deuterium at as low as 11 Jupiter masses.

Also, the 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff does not have precise physical significance. Deuterium fusion can occur in some objects with mass below that cutoff. The amount of deuterium fused depends to some extent on the composition of the object. As of 2011 the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia included objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, saying, &quot;The fact that there is no special feature around in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit&quot;. 
As of 2016 this limit was increased to 60 Jupiter masses based on a study of mass–density relationships. The Exoplanet Data Explorer includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: &quot;The 13 Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the sin i ambiguity.&quot; The NASA Exoplanet Archive includes objects with a mass (or minimum mass) equal to or less than 30 Jupiter masses.

Another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs, rather than deuterium burning, formation process or location, is whether the core pressure is dominated by Coulomb pressure or electron degeneracy pressure.

One study suggests that objects above formed through gravitational instability and not core accretion and therefore should not be thought of as planets.

A 2016 study shows no noticeable difference between gas giants and brown dwarfs in mass–radius trends: from approximately one Saturn mass to about (the onset of hydrogen burning), radius stays roughly constant as mass increases, and no obvious difference occurs when passing . By this measure, brown dwarfs are more like planets than they are like stars.

====Planetary-mass stellar objects====
The ambiguity inherent in the IAU&#x27;s definition was highlighted in December 2005, when the Spitzer Space Telescope observed Cha 110913-773444 (above), only eight times Jupiter&#x27;s mass with what appears to be the beginnings of its own planetary system. Were this object found in orbit around another star, it would have been termed a planet.

In September 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged CHXR 73 b (left), an object orbiting a young companion star at a distance of roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus technically a planet; however, its vast distance from its parent star suggests it could not have formed inside the small star&#x27;s protoplanetary disc, and therefore must have formed, as stars do, from gravitational collapse.

In 2012, Philippe Delorme, of the Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics of Grenoble in France announced the discovery of CFBDSIR 2149-0403; an independently moving 4–7 Jupiter-mass object that likely forms part of the AB Doradus moving group, less than 100 light years from Earth. Although it shares its spectrum with a spectral class T brown dwarf, Delorme speculates that it may be a planet.

In October 2013, astronomers led by Dr. Michael Liu of the University of Hawaii discovered PSO J318.5-22, a solitary free-floating L dwarf estimated to possess only 6.5 times the mass of Jupiter, making it the least massive sub-brown dwarf yet discovered.

In 2019, astronomers at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain identified GJ3512b, a gas giant about half the mass of Jupiter orbiting around the red dwarf star GJ3512 in 204 days. Such a large gas giant around such a small star at such a wide orbit is highly unlikely to have formed via accretion, and is more likely to have formed by fragmentation of the disc, similar to a star.

=== Semantics ===
Finally, from a purely linguistic point of view, there is the dichotomy that the IAU created between &#x27;planet&#x27; and &#x27;dwarf planet&#x27;. The term &#x27;dwarf planet&#x27; arguably contains two words, a noun (planet) and an adjective (dwarf). Thus, the term could suggest that a dwarf planet is a type of planet, even though the IAU explicitly defines a dwarf planet as &quot;not&quot; so being. By this formulation therefore, &#x27;dwarf planet&#x27; and &#x27;minor planet&#x27; are best considered compound nouns. Benjamin Zimmer of Language Log summarized the confusion: &quot;The fact that the IAU would like us to think of dwarf planets as distinct from &#x27;real&#x27; planets lumps the lexical item &#x27;dwarf planet&#x27; in with such oddities as &#x27;Welsh rabbit&#x27; (not really a rabbit) and &#x27;Rocky Mountain oysters&#x27; (not really oysters).&quot; As Dava Sobel, the historian and popular science writer who participated in the IAU&#x27;s initial decision in October 2006, noted in an interview with National Public Radio, &quot;A dwarf planet is not a planet, and in astronomy, there are dwarf stars, which are stars, and dwarf galaxies, which are galaxies, so it&#x27;s a term no one can love, dwarf planet.&quot; Mike Brown noted in an interview with the Smithsonian that &quot;Most of the people in the dynamical camp really did not want the word &#x27;dwarf planet&#x27;, but that was forced through by the pro-Pluto camp. So you&#x27;re left with this ridiculous baggage of dwarf planets not being planets.&quot;

Conversely, astronomer Robert Cumming of the Stockholm Observatory notes that, &quot;The name &#x27;minor planet&#x27; [has] been more or less synonymous with &#x27;asteroid&#x27; for a very long time. So it seems to me pretty insane to complain about any ambiguity or risk for confusion with the introduction of &#x27;dwarf planet&#x27;.&quot;

<text>The Finow Canal (German &quot;Finowkanal&quot;) is one of the oldest artificial waterways in Europe. Construction began in 1605. The channel, about long, is in the German state of Brandenburg in the Barnim district. It was built for the first time in 1605 and connects the Oder and Havel rivers. The Ragöse river flows into the canal.
After completion of the straighter Oder–Havel Canal in 1914, the economic relevance of the Finow Canal decreased. Today it is mainly used for tourism. The Experimental Radio Station Eberswalde is also at the Finow Canal.

A total of 10,625 athletes from a record 201 countries represented by National Olympic Committees (NOC) participated in these games. The games featured featured 301 events in 28sports and 39 disciplines, including the Olympic debuts of women&#x27;s wrestling and women&#x27;s sabre. Kiribati and Timor Leste competed for the first time in these Olympic Games. It was the second time after 1896 that Athens had hosted the Summer Olympics in the modern era.

Athletes from 74 countries won at least one medal and 56 of them won at least one gold medal. The United States led the medal table both in number of gold medals won and in overall medals, winning 36 and 101 respectively. It was the third consecutive Summer Olympic Games that the United States led the medal count in both gold and overall medals. The United Arab Emirates, Paraguay and Eritrea won their first ever Olympic medals. Israel, Chile, Dominican Republic, Georgia, Chinese Taipei and the United Arab Emirates won their first Olympic gold medals. American swimmer Michael Phelps won the most gold medals among individual participants with six and the most total medals with eight (six gold and two bronze), equalling the record held by Soviet gymnast Alexander Dityatin in 1980 for the most medals won at an Olympic Games.

During and after the Games, some athletes who were caught doping, or tested positive for banned substances, were disqualified from competition and had their medals rescinded.

==Medal table==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

Events in boxing result in a bronze medal being awarded to each of the two competitors who lose their semi-final matches, as opposed to fighting in a third place tie breaker. Another combat sport, judo, uses a repechage system which also results in two bronze medals being awarded. In the women&#x27;s 200 metre backstroke, there were ties for third place which resulted in two bronze medals being awarded.
