<text>Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune ( or ) is a United States military training facility in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Its of beaches make the base a major area for amphibious assault training, and its location between two deep-water ports (Wilmington and Morehead City) allows for fast deployments. The main base is supplemented by six satellite facilities: Marine Corps Air Station New River, Camp Geiger, Stone Bay, Courthouse Bay, Camp Johnson, and the Greater Sandy Run Training Area. The Marine Corps port facility is in Beaufort, at the southern tip of Radio Island (between the NC State Port in Morehead City, and the marine science laboratories on Pivers Island in Beaufort). It is occupied only during military port operations.

==Facilities==
Camp Lejeune encompasses 156,000 acres, with 18 kilometers of beach capable of supporting amphibious operations, 32 gun positions, 48 tactical landing zones, three state-of-the-art training facilities for Military Operations in Urban Terrain and 80 live fire ranges to include the Greater Sandy Run Training Area. Military forces from around the world come to Camp Lejeune regularly for bilateral and NATO-sponsored exercises.

== History ==

In April 1941, construction was approved on an tract in Onslow County, North Carolina. On May 1 of that year, Lieutenant Colonel William P. T. Hill began construction on Marine Barracks New River. The first base headquarters was in a summer cottage on Montford Point and then moved to Hadnot Point in 1942. Later that year it was renamed in honor of the 13th Commandant of the Marine Corps, John A. Lejeune, upon his death.

One of the satellite facilities of Camp Lejeune served for a while as a third boot camp for the Marines, in addition to Parris Island and San Diego. That facility, Montford Point, was established after Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802. Between 1942 and 1949, a brief era of segregated training for black Marines, the camp at Montford Point trained 20,000 African Americans. After the military was ordered to fully integrate, Montford Point was renamed Camp Gilbert H. Johnson and became the home of the Marine Corps Combat Service Support Schools.

On May 10, 1996, two helicopters performing a joint United States/British training exercise collided and crashed into a swampy wooded area, killing fourteen and injuring two.

In mid-September 2018, Hurricane Florence damaged IT systems and over 900 buildings in the camp, leading to a $3.6 billion repair cost. 70 percent of base housing was damaged and 84,000 gallons of sewage were released.

==Drinking water contamination==
From at least 1953 through 1987, Marines and their families at Lejeune drank and bathed in water contaminated with toxicants at concentrations 240 to 3,400 times permitted by safety standards. A 1974 base order required safe disposal of solvents and warned that improper handling could cause drinking water contamination, yet solvents were dumped or buried near base wells for years. The base&#x27;s wells were shut off in the mid-1980s but were placed back online in violation of the law. In 1982, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were found in Camp Lejeune&#x27;s drinking water supply. VOC contamination of groundwater can cause birth defects and other ill health effects in pregnant and nursing mothers. This information was not made public for nearly two decades, when the government attempted to identify those who may have been exposed.

An advocacy group called The Few, The Proud, The Forgotten was created to inform possible victims of the contamination at Lejeune. The group&#x27;s website includes an introduction with some basic information about the contamination at Lejeune, including that many health problems such as various types of cancer, leukemia, miscarriages and birth defects, have been noted in people who drank the contaminated water. According to the site, numerous base housing areas were affected by the contamination, including Tarawa Terrace, Midway Park, Berkeley Manor, Paradise Point, Hadnot Point, Hospital Point, and Watkins Village. As many as 2,000,000 people may have been exposed to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune over a period of 30 years.

=== Camp LeJeune Justice Act of 2022 ===
Efforts to create a Camp LeJeune Justice Act in 2021 failed, but the effort was renewed in 2022 when Camp LeJeune Justice Act became Section 706 of the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act, H.R. 3967. The U.S. House passed H.R. 3967 on March 3, 2022, by a vote of 256–174. The U.S. Senate passed H.R. 3967 with some minor amendments on June 16, 2022, by a vote of 84–14. Following the bill&#x27;s passage in the U.S. Senate, President Biden&#x27;s White House made a celebratory statement that included mention of Camp LeJeune victims. There were constitutional taxation problems with the amended version and a &quot;blue slip&quot; was issued causing the matter to return to the U.S. House. The U.S. House made the changes necessary to avoid the constitutional issue and passed the PACT Act on July 13, 2022, by a vote of 342–88. This new PACT Act was repackaged as S. 3373 with the Camp LeJeune Justice Act set as Section 804. Some Republican senators changed their votes and refused cloture on July 27, 2022, by a vote of 55–42. After several days of veterans protesting at the Capitol, there was another vote on S. 3373 and this time it passed by a vote of 86–11 on August 2, 2022. The bill was signed into law by President Biden on August 10, 2022.

The language of Section 804 provides for monetary relief for those injured by exposure to the Camp Lejeune base and its toxic water. Thirty days of &quot;living&quot; or &quot;working&quot; or &quot;otherwise&quot; being exposed between 1953 and 1987 is the prerequisite for compensation. This includes &quot;in-utero&quot; exposure. Harms must be demonstrated and they must be associated with some condition caused by the base toxicants. Some of the possible conditions may include those listed for the Janey Ensminger Act of 2012. 38 C.F.R. 17.400(b).

=== Litigation ===
At least 850 former residents filed claims for nearly $4 billion from the military. The multi-district litigation, MDL-2218, was dismissed on North Carolina statute of repose grounds on December 5, 2016, and the appeal to the 11th Circuit failed (&quot;Straw, et. al. v. United States&quot;, 16–17573). The U.S. Supreme Court refused certiorari. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2014 potentially curbed groundwater contamination lawsuits by families at Camp Lejeune. Federal law, which imposes a two-year statute of limitations after the harm is discovered, preempts North Carolina&#x27;s 10-year statute of repose law, but this was not followed by the 11th Circuit. State lawmakers tried to eliminate the state prohibition on lawsuits being filed 10 years after the last pollution occurred or from the time a polluted property was sold. The Camp LeJeune Justice Act of 2022, Section 804(b) of the PACT Act, S. 3373, provide an entirely new means for justice to the victims and removes normal tort defenses. Public Law 117-168, SEC. 804(b), 136 Stat. 1802–1804.

Disability activist, lawyer, columnist, and politician, Andrew U. D. Straw, has appealed his cases unsuccessfully. He has also pursued claims at the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, stating that the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; UCMJ responsibilities imply a contract to protect U.S. Marine Corps family members (&quot;Straw v. United States&quot;, 1:17-cv-00560, U.S. COFC). This case was dismissed and denied on appeal. Straw has advocated for legislative reform to avoid the legal arguments of the Department of Justice. The main chemicals involved were trichloroethylene (TCE, a degreaser), perchloroethylene (PCE, a dry cleaning solvent), vinyl chloride, and benzene; however, more than 70 chemicals have been identified as contaminants at Lejeune. Andrew Straw is pursuing his own infant brain injury &quot;pro se&quot; and as estate executor for the wrongful death of his mother from a Camp LeJeune cancer. &quot;Straw v. United States&quot;, 7:23-cv-1475-FL (E.D.N.C.)

Straw has sought not only compensation, but he also has sought health care under the Janey Ensminger Act of 2012. He litigated for that benefit for seven years. He was rejected at the VA, the BVA, the U.S. Court of Veterans Claims, and finally in 2021 at the Federal Circuit. Despite Straw being born at Camp LeJeune in 1969, his having 19 months of base access while his father worked there as a U.S. Marine, the language of the Janey Ensminger Act was interpreted narrowly so as to deny Straw this benefit. Straw&#x27;s parents had a home off base at the time of his birth and this is where they slept, even while using and working at the base during the day from 1968–1970. The fact that Straw&#x27;s mother died from one of the cancers listed in the Act and Straw having neurobehavioral effects listed in the Act was irrelevant to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit also refused to consider the misapplication of the North Carolina Statute of Repose as being a taking of private property. &quot;Straw v. Wilkie&quot;, 843 F. App’x 263 (Fed. Cir. 1/15/2021); &quot;Straw v. United States&quot;, 4 F.4th 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The narrow construction of the Janey Ensminger Act of 2012 in Straw&#x27;s case led to the Camp LeJeune Justice Act of 2022 having no such on-base limitation. Straw suggested that change to Attorney Ed Bell, the author of the CLJA, and Bell agreed. The new 2022 law provides a catch-all &quot;otherwise exposed&quot; inclusive provision so such exclusion for sleeping off base cannot be used to deny the relief.

On March 8, 2010, Paul Buckley of Hanover, Massachusetts, received a 100 percent, service connected disability from the Department of Veterans Affairs for cancer (multiple myeloma), which was linked to toxic water exposure on Camp Lejeune. This is believed to be the first time the government has admitted the link between the contamination and illnesses.

In 2007, Jerry Ensminger, a retired Marine master sergeant, found a document dated 1981 that described a radioactive dump site near a rifle range at the camp. According to the report, the waste was laced with strontium-90, an isotope known to cause cancer and leukemia. According to Camp Lejeune&#x27;s installation restoration program manager, base officials learned about the document in 2004. Ensminger served in the Marine Corps for years and lived for part of that time at Camp Lejeune. In 1985, his nine-year-old daughter, Janey, died of cancer. Straw&#x27;s mother died in 1997 from breast cancer.

On July 6, 2009, Laura Jones filed suit against the U.S. government over the contaminated water at the base. Jones previously lived at the base where her husband, a Marine, was stationed, and she has since been diagnosed with lymphoma. Twenty former residents of Camp Lejeune—all men who lived there during the 1960s and the 1980s—have been diagnosed with breast cancer. In April 2009, the United States Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry withdrew a 1997 public health assessment at Camp Lejeune that denied any connection between the toxicants and illness.

On August 10, 2022, President Biden signed the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022, allowing victims to sue for sicknesses related to water contamination at Camp Lejeune.

Straw has renewed his several claims for compensation. &quot;Straw v. United States&quot;, 7:23-cv-162-BO-BM (E.D.N.C.) (Camp LeJeune Justice Act lawsuit, docketed 2/21/2023). The Estate of Straw&#x27;s mother also has a claim pending at U.S. Navy JAG Code 15 for her wrongful death from breast cancer. CLS23-5185. Straw is appealing the denial of his motion for health care and education benefits. &quot;Straw v. United States&quot;, 23-2156 (4th Cir. 2024) (DENIED)

One of the DOJ lawyers involved in denial of relief under FTCA in MDL-2218, Adam Bain, has appeared again in CLJA case filings. &quot;Estate of Jane Ensminger v. United States&quot;, 7:23-cv-161 (E.D.N.C.)

A review of the backgrounds of 4th Circuit judges on Ballotpedia.org reveals that half of the 14 judges worked for the Justice Department or federal government prior to appointment to the bench and several were JAG attorneys for the Military previously.

The lead attorneys for the plaintiffs have set up a website to inform the victims and the public of happenings in the case. The Court ordered these attorneys to submit a Master Complaint that will apply to all lawsuits and plaintiffs. The Master Complaint is now online. Each plaintiff is required to submit a short form complaint using a template provided by the Court at pages 14–18 of its Case Management Order #2. The government had until November 20, 2023, to answer. The consolidated case is meant to streamline prosecution of the matter. The government told the Court in November 2023 that there were over 1,300 cases in federal court along with 117,000 claims at Navy JAG under Camp LeJeune Justice Act (CLJA), amounting to $3.3 trillion in claims.

In 2024 The U.S. Navy received over 546,500 claims for compensation from people impacted by the contaminated water at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune that were submitted by the August 10, 2024, deadline.

===Janey Ensminger Act===
In July 2012, the U.S. Senate passed a bill, called the Janey Ensminger Act in honor of retired Marine Master Sergeant Jerry Ensminger&#x27;s daughter Janey who died of cancer at age 9, authorizing medical care to military and family members who had resided at the base between 1957 and 1987 and developed conditions linked to the water contamination. The measure applies to up to 750,000 people. The bill applies to 15 specific ailments believed to be linked to the contamination, including cancer of the esophagus, lung, breast, bladder or kidney; leukemia; multiple myeloma; myleodysplasic syndromes; renal toxicity; hepatic steatosis; female infertility; miscarriage; scleroderma; and/or neurobehavioral effects or non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. The Department of Veterans Affairs is assigned to provide the medical care. To fund the medical care, the bill extended higher fees for VA home loan guarantees through 2017. This health coverage was worded to require the victim to have lived on the base and any civilian dependent who slept off base was excluded regardless of getting the illnesses on the list. &quot;Straw v. Wilkie&quot;, 843 F. App’x 263 (Fed. Cir. 1/15/2021). (Straw was born at Camp LeJeune Naval Hospital and had base access for 19 months but was denied health care for a condition—bipolar disorder—PCE doubles the chance of contracting).

A 2023 cohort study of 172,128 American veterans who were stationed in Lejeune and 168,361 who were stationed in Pendleton found that the rates of Parkinson&#x27;s disease were 70% higher in Lejeune as compared to Pendleton, suggesting that exposure to trichloroethylene in the water may increase risk of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

A Cancer Incidence Study was delayed at ATSDR when this information may be critical to the victims in obtaining compensation. The Cancer Incidence Study was released at the end of January 2024 after about 8 years of work. It showed more evidence that the water increased the risk of various cancers. Another ATSDR mortality study showed that the risk of death from Camp LeJeune exposure and diseases was elevated. ATSDR provides a FAQ about Camp LeJeune toxic exposure andvarious studies done or to be done.

<text>An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument used for measuring angles of slope, elevation, or depression of an object with respect to gravity&#x27;s direction. It is also known as a &quot;tilt indicator&quot;, &quot;tilt sensor&quot;, &quot;tilt meter&quot;, &quot;slope alert&quot;, &quot;slope gauge&quot;, &quot;gradient meter&quot;, &quot;gradiometer&quot;, &quot;level gauge&quot;, &quot;level meter&quot;, &quot;declinometer&quot;, and &quot;pitch &amp; roll indicator&quot;. Clinometers measure both inclines and declines using three different units of measure: degrees, percentage points, and topos. The astrolabe is an example of an inclinometer that was used for celestial navigation and location of astronomical objects from ancient times to the Renaissance.

A &quot;tilt sensor&quot; can measure the in often two axes of a reference plane in two axes.
In contrast, a full motion would use at least three axes and often additional sensors. One way to measure tilt angle with reference to the earth&#x27;s ground plane, is to use an accelerometer. Typical applications can be found in the industry and in game controllers. In aircraft, the &quot;ball&quot; in turn coordinators or turn and bank indicators is sometimes referred to as an inclinometer.

==History==

Inclinometers include examples such as Well&#x27;s in-clinometer, the essential parts of which are a flat side, or base, on which it stands, and a hollow disc just half filled with some heavy liquid. The glass face of the disc is surrounded by a graduated scale that marks the angle at which the surface of the liquid stands, with reference to the flat base. The zero line is parallel to the base, and when the liquid stands on that line, the flat side is horizontal; the 90 degree is perpendicular to the base, and when the liquid stands on that line, the flat side is perpendicular or plumb. Intervening angles are marked, and, with the aid of simple conversion tables, the instrument indicates the rate of fall per set distance of horizontal measurement, and set distance of the sloping line.

Al-Biruni, a Persian polymath, once wanted to measure the height of the sun. He lacked the necessary equipment to measure this height. He was forced to create a calibrated arc on the back of a counting board, which he then used as a makeshift quadrant with the help of a plumb line. He determined the location&#x27;s latitude using the measurements taken with this rudimentary tool. This quadrant was most likely an inclinometer based on the quarter-circle panel.

The Abney level is a handheld surveying instrument developed in the 1870s that includes a sighting tube and inclinometer, arranged so that the surveyor may align the sighting tube (and its crosshair) with the reflection of the bubble in the spirit level of the inclinometer when the line of sight is at the angle set on the inclinometer.

One of the more famous inclinometer installations was on the panel of the Ryan NYP &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot;—in 1927 Charles Lindbergh chose the lightweight Rieker Inc P-1057 Degree Inclinometer to give him climb and descent angle information.

==Uses==
Hand-held clinometers are used for a variety of surveying and measurement tasks. In land surveying and mapping, a clinometer can provide a rapid measurement of the slope of a geographic feature, or used for cave survey. In prospecting for minerals, clinometers are used to measure the strike and dip of geologic formations. In forestry, tree height measurement can be done with a clinometer using standardized methods including triangulation. Major artillery guns may have an associated clinometer used to facilitate aiming of shells over long distances.

Permanently-installed tiltmeters are emplaced at major earthworks such as dams to monitor the long-term stability of the structure.

===Factors which influence the use of inclinometers===
(Overall accuracy varies depending on the type of tilt sensor (or inclinometer) and technology used)
* Gravity
* Temperature (drift), zero offset, linearity, vibration, shock, cross-axis sensitivity, acceleration/deceleration.
* A clear line of sight between the user and the measured point is needed.
* A well defined object is required to obtain the maximum precision.
* The angle measurement precision and accuracy is limited to slightly better than one arcsec.

==Accuracy==
Certain highly sensitive electronic inclinometer sensors can achieve an output resolution to 0.0001°; depending on the technology and angle range, it may be limited to 0.001°. An inclinometer sensor&#x27;s true or absolute accuracy (which is the combined total error), however, is a combination of initial sets of sensor zero offset and sensitivity, sensor linearity, hysteresis, repeatability, and the temperature drifts of zero and sensitivity—electronic inclinometers accuracy can typically range from ±0.01–2° depending on the sensor and situation. Typically in room ambient conditions the accuracy is limited to the sensor linearity specification.

==Sensor technology==
Tilt sensors and inclinometers generate an artificial horizon and measure angular tilt with respect to this horizon. They are used in cameras, aircraft flight controls, automobile security systems, and speciality switches and are also used for platform leveling, boom angle indication, and in other applications requiring measurement of tilt.

Important specifications to consider for tilt sensors and inclinometers are the tilt angle range and the number of axes. The axes are usually, but not always, orthogonal. The tilt angle range is the range of desired linear output. 

Common implementations of tilt sensors and inclinometers are accelerometer, Liquid Capacitive, electrolytic, gas bubble in liquid, and pendulum.

Tilt sensor technology has also been implemented in video games. &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Universal Gravitation&quot; and &quot;Kirby Tilt &#x27;n&#x27; Tumble&quot; are both built around a tilt sensor mechanism, which is built into the cartridge. The PlayStation 3 and Wii game controllers also use tilt as a means to play video games.

Inclinometers are also used in civil engineering, for example, to measure the inclination of land to be built upon.

Some inclinometers provide an electronic interface based on CAN (Controller Area Network). In addition, those inclinometers may support the standardized CANopen profile (CiA 410). In this case, these inclinometers are compatible and partly interchangeable.

==Two-axis digital inclinometer==
Traditional spirit levels and pendulum-based electronic leveling instruments are usually constrained by only single-axis and narrow tilt measurement range. However, most precision leveling, angle measurement, alignment and surface flatness profiling tasks essentially involve a two-dimensional surface plane angle rather than two independent orthogonal single-axis objects. Two-axis inclinometers that are built with MEMS tilt sensors provides simultaneous two-dimensional angle readings of a surface plane tangent to earth datum.

Typical advantages of using two-axis MEMS inclinometers over conventional single-axis &quot;bubble&quot; or mechanical leveling instruments may include:
* Simultaneous measurement of two-dimensional (X-Y plane) tilt angles (i.e. pitch &amp; roll), can eliminate tedious swapping back-and-forth experienced when using a single-axis level, for example to adjust machine footings to attain a precise leveling position.
* Digital compensation and precise calibration for non-linearity, for example for operating temperature variation, resulting in higher accuracy over a wider measurement range.
* The accelerometer sensors may generate numerical data in the form of vibration profiles to enable a machine installer to track and assess alignment quality in real-time and verify a structure&#x27;s positional stability by comparing leveling profiles before and after it is set up.

== Inclinometer with gyroscope ==
As inclinometers measure the angle of an object with respect to the force of gravity, external accelerations like rapid motions, vibrations or shocks will introduce errors in the tilt measurements. To overcome this problem, it is possible to use a gyroscope in addition to an accelerometer. Any of the abovementioned accelerations have a huge impact on the accelerometer, but a limited effect on the measured rotation rates of the gyroscope. An algorithm can combine both signals to get the best value out of each sensor. This way it is possible to separate the actual tilt angle from the errors introduced by external accelerations.

==Applications==

Inclinometers are used for:
* Determining latitude using Polaris (in the Northern Hemisphere) or the two stars of the constellation Crux (in the Southern Hemisphere).
* Determining the angle of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field with respect to the horizontal plane.
* Showing a deviation from the true vertical or horizontal.
* Surveying, to measure an angle of inclination or elevation.
* Alerting an equipment operator that it may tip over.
* Measuring angles of elevation, slope, or incline, e.g. of an embankment.
* Measuring slight differences in slopes, particularly for geophysics. Such inclinometers are, for instance, used for monitoring volcanoes, or for measuring the depth and rate of landslide movement.
* Measuring movements in walls or the ground in civil engineering projects.
* Determining the dip of beds or strata, or the slope of an embankment or cutting; a kind of plumb level.
* Some automotive safety systems.
* Indicating pitch and roll of vehicles, nautical craft, and aircraft. See turn coordinator and slip indicator.
* Monitoring the boom angle of cranes and material handlers.
* Measuring the &quot;look angle&quot; of a satellite antenna towards a satellite.
* Adjusting a solar panel to the optimal angle to maximize its output.
* Measuring the slope angle of a tape or chain during distance measurement.
* Measuring the height of a building, tree, or other feature using a vertical angle and a distance (determined by taping or pacing), using trigonometry.
* Measuring the angle of drilling in well logging.
* Measuring the list of a ship in still water and the roll in rough water.
* Measuring steepness of a ski slope.
* Measuring the orientation of planes and lineations in rocks, in combination with a compass, in structural geology.
* Measuring range of motion in the joints of the body
* Measuring the inclination angle of the pelvis. Numerous neck and back measurements require the simultaneous use of two inclinometers.
* it measures the angle of elevation, and ultimately computing the altitudes of, many things otherwise inaccessible for direct measurement.
* Measuring and fine tuning the angle of line array speaker hangs. Confirmation of the angle achieved via use of a laser built into the remote inclinometer.
* Setting correct orientation of solar panels while installing
* Setting firing angle of a cannon or gun (determines projectile range)
* Electronic games
* Help prevent unsafe working conditions.
* The USDA Forest Service uses tilt sensors (or inclinometers) to measure tree height in its Forest Inventory and Analysis program.
* Logistics and transport also use tilt indicators, it is a specific system for single use. They are attached to the products during the shipping process.

===Games===
Nintendo used tilt sensor technology in five games for its Game Boy series of hand-held game systems. The tilt sensor allows players to control aspects of the game by twisting the game system. Games that use this feature:
* &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Universal Gravitation&quot; (Game Boy Advance)
* &quot;&quot; (Game Boy Advance)(not released in Europe)
* &quot;Koro Koro Puzzle Happy Panechu!&quot; (Game Boy Advance)(Japan only)
* &quot;Kirby Tilt &#x27;n&#x27; Tumble&quot; (Game Boy Color)(not released in Europe)
* Command Master (Game Boy Color)(Japan only)

Tilt sensors can also be found in game controllers such as the Microsoft Sidewinder Freestyle Pro and Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3 controller.

However, unlike these other controllers in which the tilt sensor serves as a supplement to normal control methods, it serves as one of the central features of Nintendo&#x27;s Wii Remote and the Nunchuk attachment. Along with accelerometers, the tilt sensors are a primary method of control in most Wii games.

It is now being used in many different aspects, instead of just games like motocrossing and flight simulators. It can be used for sport gaming, first-person shooter, and other odd uses such as in &quot;&quot;

Another example is a virtual version of a wooden maze with obstacles in which you have to maneuver a ball by tilting the maze. A homebrew tilt sensor interface was made for the Palm (PDA).

<text>General Henry Seymour Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson, (20 February 1864 – 28 March 1925), known as Sir Henry Rawlinson, 2nd Baronet between 1895 and 1919, was a senior British Army officer in the First World War who commanded the Fourth Army of the British Expeditionary Force at the battles of the Somme (1916) and Amiens (1918) as well as the breaking of the Hindenburg Line (1918). He commanded the Indian Army from 1920 to 1925.

==Early life==
Rawlinson was born at Trent Manor in Dorset on 20 February 1864. His father, Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet, was an Army officer, and a renowned Middle East scholar who is generally recognised as the father of Assyriology. His mother was Louisa Caroline Harcourt Seymour (1828-1889). He received his early formal education at Eton College.

==Early military career==
After passing through commissioned officer training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Rawlinson entered the British Army as a lieutenant in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps in India on 6 February 1884. His father arranged for him to serve on the staff of a friend, General Sir Frederick Roberts, the commander-in-chief in India. Rawlinson and the Roberts family remained close friends throughout his life. When Roberts died in November 1914, Rawlinson wrote, &quot;I feel as if I have lost my second father.&quot; His first military experience was serving in Burma during the 1886 uprising.

===Colonial service===
In October 1889, Rawlinson&#x27;s mother died and he returned to Britain. He transferred to the Coldstream Guards, and was promoted to captain on 4 November 1891. He attended the Staff College, Camberley from 1893 to 1895, which brought him into contact with Julian Byng, Aylmer Haldane, Thomas Snow, Hubert Hamilton, Alexander Hamilton-Gordon, Launcelot Kiggell, and Henry Wilson, all of whom would rise to high rank in the First World War. He served on Major General Herbert Kitchener&#x27;s staff during the advance on Omdurman in Sudan in 1898, and was promoted to major on 25 January 1899 and to brevet lieutenant colonel on 26 January 1899.

Rawlinson served with distinction in a field command in the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902, earning promotion to the local rank of colonel on 6 May 1901. He was in Western Transvaal during early 1902, and led a column taking part in the Battle of Rooiwal, the last battle of the war (11 April 1902).

Following the end of hostilities in June 1902, he returned to the United Kingdom together with Lord Kitchener on board the &quot;SS Orotava&quot;, which arrived in Southampton on 12 July. In a despatch dated 23 June 1902, Lord Kitchener wrote of Rawlinson that he &quot;possesses the qualities of Staff Officer and Column Commander in the field. His characteristics will always ensure him a front place in whatever he sets his mind to.&quot; For his service in the war, Rawlinson was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the April 1901 South Africa Honours list (the award was dated to 29 November 1900), and he received the actual decoration after his return home, from Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902.

Rawlinson had received the brevet rank of colonel in the South Africa Honours list published on 26 June 1902, was promoted to the substantive rank of colonel on 1 April 1903, and named as commandant of the Army Staff College.

=== Staff College ===
Rawlinson was the first of three reforming commandants who transformed the Staff College into a real war school. The curriculum was modernised and updated, the teaching given a new sense of purpose and instructors became &#x27;directing staff&#x27; rather than &#x27;professors&#x27;, emphasising practicality. Major Godwin-Austen, historian of the college, wrote: &quot;Blessed with an extremely attractive personality, a handsome appearance, high social standing, and more than an average share of this world&#x27;s goods, he was one to inspire his students unconsciously to follow in his footsteps.&quot;

Promoted to temporary brigadier general on 1 March 1907, he was made commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade in place of Edwin Alderson at Aldershot that year. Having been promoted to major general on 10 May 1909, he became general officer commanding (GOC) of the 3rd Division in June 1910, in succession to Major General William Franklyn. In manoeuvres in June 1912, he showed an appreciation of the use of artillery, the Times&#x27;s correspondent noting approvingly:

The historians Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson praise Rawlinson&#x27;s foresight in considering combining infantry with the fire-power of machine-guns and artillery. After handing over the division to his successor, Major General Hubert Hamilton, in May 1914 Rawlinson went on leave, returning on the outbreak of war to briefly serve as director of recruiting at the War Office.

==First World War==
=== Western Front ===
In September 1914 Rawlinson was appointed General Officer Commanding 4th Division in France. Promoted to temporary lieutenant-general on 4 October 1914, he then took command of the IV Corps. In late September, the Belgian government formally requested British military assistance in defending Antwerp. IV Corps, acting under orders from the Cabinet, was chosen to reinforce the city. Rawlinson arrived in Antwerp on 6 October. It was soon obvious that the combined British, Belgian, and French forces were too weak to hold the city, and Kitchener decided on an evacuation two days later. IV Corps and the remnants of the Belgian Army successfully re-joined Allied forces in Western Belgium, with the Cabinet returning Rawlinson&#x27;s corps to Field Marshal Sir John French&#x27;s command. IV Corps marched into Ypres on the night of 13–14 October, where the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), advancing northwards, was preparing to meet the German Army. Located at the centre of the British line, IV Corps met the main thrust of the German attacks between 18 and 27 October and suffered heavy casualties. On 28 October, IV Corps was put under the temporary command of Douglas Haig while Rawlinson went to England to oversee the preparation of 8th Division. When he returned in November the German attacks on Ypres had died down.

Rawlinson wrote to the Conservative politician Lord Derby (24 December 1914) forecasting that the Allies would win a war of attrition but it was unclear whether this would take one, two or three years. In 1915, IV Corps formed part of the First Army (General Douglas Haig). At the battle of Neuve Chapelle (10–12 March 1915), he massed 340 guns. The weight of this bombardment on a comparatively narrow front enabled the attackers to secure the village and of the German front line. The arrival of German reinforcements prevented further advance. Rawlinson concluded that an enemy&#x27;s line of trenches could be broken &#x27;with suitable artillery preparation&#x27; combined with secrecy. He also drew a lesson, that trench warfare called for limited advances: &#x27;What I want to do now is what I call &quot;Bite &amp; Hold&quot; – bite off a piece of the enemy&#x27;s line like Neuve Chapelle &amp; hold it against all counter-attacks...there ought to be no difficulty in holding against the enemy&#x27;s counterattacks &amp; inflicting on him at least twice the loss that we have suffered in making the bite&#x27;.

At the end of 1915, Rawlinson was considered for command of the First Army, in succession to Haig but the command was instead given to Sir Charles Monro. He was promoted to temporary general on 22 December 1915. Promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-general on 1 January 1916, Rawlinson assumed command of the new Fourth Army on 24 January 1916. The Fourth Army would play a major role in the planned Allied offensive on the Somme. He wrote in his diary: &quot;It is not the lot of many men to command an army of over half a million men&quot;. The Somme was originally conceived as a joint Anglo-French offensive but owing to the demands of the Battle of Verdun, French participation was greatly reduced, leaving the British, and especially Rawlinson&#x27;s inexperienced army, to bear the brunt of the offensive. On the eve of the offensive, he &quot;showed an attitude of absolute confidence&quot;. To his diary he confided some uncertainties: &quot;What the actual results will be no one can say but I feel pretty confident of success myself though only after heavy fighting. That the bosh [sic] will break and that a debacle will supervene I do not believe...&quot; He was not satisfied that the wire was well cut and enemy trenches sufficiently &quot;knocked about&quot;.

===Battle of the Somme===
The Somme offensive was launched on 1 July 1916. In English writing, attention has been paid to the first day, a British disaster for three of the five attacking corps, although the battle lasted 141 days against two German armies. On 1 July, British forces were repulsed by the Germans along most of the front north of the Albert–Bapaume road, suffering 57,000 casualties. The worst defeats were in front of Pozières and Thiepval. By the afternoon Rawlinson was aware of much of the disaster but not of the casualties. By 3 July he knew 8,000 prisoners had been taken. On the Allied right, the British and French had more success. Here they had a better fire plan but limited objectives as a flank guard to a main advance further north. This was more in keeping with Rawlinson&#x27;s idea of &quot;bite and hold&quot;. There is no documentary evidence that the corps commander on the right (southern) British flank, Lieutenant General Walter Congreve, commanding XIII Corps, telephoned Rawlinson to ask permission to advance beyond his set objectives or to send in cavalry.

The principal causes of the defeat in the north were the skill of German defenders, the siting of their defences and the failure of the long and heavy preliminary artillery bombardment to destroy the German barbed wire and trenches, except in the southern sector where French heavy artillery assisted. It is not true that heavily laden British infantry were required to advance at a slow walk. The researches of the historians Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson have shown that the majority of battalions were out in No Man&#x27;s Land before whistles blew. This was of no avail, except in the south, against skilful placing of German machine guns in enfilade positions and German artillery fire falling on British trenches to prevent reinforcements reaching the 36th (Ulster) Division, who had penetrated the German position north of Thiepval. Rawlinson&#x27;s &#x27;Tactical Notes&#x27;, initially drafted by his chief of staff Archie Montgomery, were not prescriptive, giving initiative to battalion commanders to choose their formations.

Haig told Rawlinson to exploit success in the south. Fourth Army fought its way forward towards the second German line atop the Bazentin Ridge. At first light on 14 July, following a night approach march, a two-day preparatory bombardment of over 375,000 shells and a five-minute intensive hurricane bombardment, the leading British attackers, some within of enemy lines attacked the German position. Nearly all first line objectives were taken. The Germans suffered 2,200 casualties and the British took 1,400 prisoners. The British were unable to exploit this success and a long period of difficult fighting followed. The Germans made excellent use of the woods on the battlefield, turning each into a strongpoint. Rawlinson mainly failed to intervene and coordinate attacks until late August and early September, when he massed guns and men, enabling brigades of the 16th (Irish) Division to capture Guillemont village. By late September, superior British artillery and better tactics enabled the British to achieve a striking success in the Battle of Morval. At the start of October, the rain and the temperature fell and the battlefield turned into a quagmire. The only late success was gained by the Fifth Army (formerly Reserve Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Hubert Gough) capturing Beaumont Hamel.

The results of the Somme remain in dispute; casualties on both sides were immense. There is evidence that the German Army suffered enormous damage from an increasingly effective British artillery aided by French and British air superiority over the battlefield. &quot;The unprecedented English artillery fire on the Somme is filling the hospitals more than ever&quot; wrote the wife of a German aristocrat. Rawlinson contributed to this in his awareness of guns and aircraft and his planning aided by his chief of staff for attacks on 14 July and 25 September. On and before 1 July and during most of August he has been criticised for giving insufficient direction and did not consistently assert control over subordinate commanders. There was cautious British optimism at the end of the Battle and General Sir Henry Wilson&#x27;s felt that Haig could defeat Germany in 1917 by fighting &quot;two Sommes at once&quot;, but that he should be told how much manpower was available and told to plan accordingly.

In January 1917, Rawlinson was promoted to permanent general &quot;for distinguished service in the field&quot;. For a period in 1917–18, he also commanded the Second Army. In February 1918 he was appointed British Permanent Military Representative to the inter-Allied Supreme War Council at Versailles.

===Battles of 1918===
On 28 March 1918, Rawlinson took over Fifth Army from Hubert Gough, sacked in the wake of the German March offensive, Operation Michael; his Fourth Army Staff joined him and Fifth Army became Fourth Army on 2 April. By this time the German Army&#x27;s offensive had been checked, and the Allies were preparing a counter-offensive. Following the success of the Australian attack at Le Hamel on 4 July, Rawlinson proposed to Haig a larger attack, designed to force the Germans back from the city of Amiens and further to damage the German Army&#x27;s weakening morale. At lunch on 16 July Haig agreed, saying he had already proposed such an operation. Rawlinson had learned from his experiences on the Somme:

The attack was to be on a relatively narrow front, with no prior bombardment and limited objectives. To ensure a breakthrough, Haig gave Rawlinson command of virtually the whole British armoured forces. By this stage of the war British manpower was severely depleted, and to achieve the breakthrough, the Fourth Army comprised four Canadian, five Australian, five British and two American divisions.

The Allies achieved surprise and the Battle of Amiens proved a striking success. On 8 August, described by General Erich Ludendorff as &quot;the black day of the German Army&quot;, the Allies took 12,000 prisoners and captured 450 guns. The German and Allied commands were struck by the collapse in German morale and the high number of Germans surrendering without a fight. The Allies were still cautious about pressing their advantage too far and on 11 August Rawlinson advised Haig to halt the offensive. In September, again commanding a mixed force of British, Australian and American divisions, Rawlinson participated in the breaking of the Hindenburg Line, a major part of the Hundred Days Offensive. Initial planning was by John Monash, the Australian commander, but Rawlinson broadened the front and gave him more tanks. The Allied attack was preceded by a massive artillery bombardment. Allied success was most striking in the centre where the 46th (North Midland) Division crossed the St Quentin Canal and stormed trenches beyond, advancing up to and taking over 5,300 prisoners. The Fourth Army&#x27;s advance continued in the Battles of the Selle and the Sambre and Oise Canal. In the Hundred Days, the Fourth Army had gained , taking 80,000 prisoners and 1,100 guns.

==Later life ==
=== Post-war activities ===
Rawlinson was bestowed with many honours in reward for his role in the First World War. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in 1917 and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George 1918. In August 1919 the Houses of Parliament passed a vote of thanks to him for his military service, and awarded him the sum of £30,000 from the Exchequer. In 1919, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Rawlinson of Trent in the County of Dorset, and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.

Rawlinson was again called on to organise an evacuation, this time of the Allied forces that had been sent to Russia to intervene in the Russian Civil War. In November 1919, after returning to Britain, he succeeded General Sir Archibald Murray as general officer commanding-in-chief (GOC-in-C) of Aldershot Command.

=== Indian Command ===
In 1920, Rawlinson was made Commander-in-Chief, India. Winston Churchill as Secretary of State for War was instrumental in securing his appointment, over-riding a tradition that the post alternated between officers from the British and Indian Armies. He told Lloyd George that the post should go to the best qualified officer and that his military advisors &quot;entirely supported my view that the best appointment we could make would be that of General Lord Rawlinson&quot;. He held the post until his death. He faced severe challenges. Brigadier Reginald Dyer&#x27;s ordering his men to shoot at a crowd at Amritsar, killing 387 unarmed Indians, left a deep legacy of bitterness. The 3rd Afghan War had ended, but there was continued fighting in Waziristan. A hugely expanded army faced postwar demobilisation and continued cost of modernisation. The new commander-in-chief was expected to introduce a measure of &quot;Indianisation&quot;, giving commissions to Indians. Under the system of Dyarchy, Indians, generally opposed to military expenditure, took a share in government and Rawlinson would have to justify army budgets. The Moplah Rebellion of 1921 brought widespread disorder. When Gandhi launched the movement of non-cooperation with the British on 1 August 1920, he wished to avoid popular violence, but in 1922 the campaign degenerated: a crowd attacked a police station at Chauri Chaura, set fire to the building and 22 or 23 policemen were burnt to death or hacked down by the crowd. Gandhi cancelled the campaign, but he and other leaders of the resistance were arrested. Rawlinson certainly began his command believing that the Army would have to maintain order. On 15 July, he complained that:

John Newsinger argues that &quot;there is no doubt that the great majority of the British in India, soldiers, officials, civilians, agreed with Rawlinson on this. A few months later he noted in his journal that he &quot;was determined to fight for the white community against any black sedition or rebellion&quot;, and, if necessary, &quot;be the next Dyer&quot;. Nonetheless, with Gandhi temporarily behind bars and increasing economic stability as the 1920s advanced, Rawlinson had the scope to reduce the Army&#x27;s strength, modernise its equipment and work closely with Viceroys Chelmsford and Reading to try to make dyarchy a success. In Waziristan, the British and Indian Field Force backed by aircraft put an end to the fighting, built roads and established a brigade base at Razmak. Rawlinson announced a scheme of &quot;Indianisation&quot; to the Legislative Assembly on 17 February 1923. Its aim, he said, was to &quot;give Indians a fair opportunity of providing that units officered by Indians will be efficient in every way&quot;. The Prince of Wales&#x27; Royal Indian Military College was founded at Dehra Dun in 1922, run on English public school lines, to encourage potential officer candidates.

In January 1924, Rawlinson was appointed a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India. By the end of his Indian command, he had reduced the Indian army in numbers and cost, but improved firepower, mobility and training. In financial matters he had been hugely helped by Sir Bhupendra Mitra, who had financial details &quot;at his finger&#x27;s ends&quot;. He had been appointed to succeed Lord Cavan as CIGS when he left India.

==Death==
Rawlinson died on 28 March 1925 at the age of 61 at Delhi in India, after a medical operation for a stomach ailment, although not long before the operation he had played polo and cricket and seemed fit and well. His body was carried back to England on the SS &quot;Assaye&quot;, which was met on reaching the English Channel by a Royal Navy destroyer, onto which the coffin was transferred, then carried into Portsmouth Harbour, being met at the South Jetty by a military ceremonial receiving party. Rawlinson was buried in the chapel of St Michael and St George in the north transept of St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Trent, in the county of Dorset.

==Personal life==
Rawlinson was a gifted watercolour artist. In March 1920, he and Winston Churchill enjoyed a painting holiday together on the French estate of the Duke of Westminster. &quot;The General paints in water colours and does it very well,&quot; wrote Churchill. &quot;With all my enormous paraphernalia, I have produced very indifferent results here.&quot;

He married Meredith Sophia Francis Kennard (1861–1931) at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Knightsbridge, London on 5 November 1890, the marriage producing no children. On Henry Rawlinson&#x27;s death the baronetcy passed to his brother Alfred Rawlinson.

<text>Ivan Dragomiloff is a fictional character, the chairman of &quot;The Assassination Bureau, Ltd&quot; in the book of that name by Jack London. The character was played by actor Oliver Reed in the film of the same name.

Ivan is a confident character, almost to the point of being unbeatable. With the various attempts on his life by the other board members, he makes the most of their blunders to turn the tables on them. He is calm, suave, and quick to act, and makes the most of all opportunities presented.

In the movie, Dragomiloff cleverly exploits his opponents&#x27; weakness: for example, when faced by Assassination Bureau member General von Pinck (Curt Jurgens) in a Zeppelin, Dragomiloff draws a sword, knowing that his opponent cannot resist a sword duel challenge.

<text>The Continental Indoor Soccer League (CISL) was a professional indoor soccer league that played from 1993 to 1997.

==History==
In the summer of 1989 Dr Jerry Buss, the owner of the Los Angeles Lakers and California Sports, told his executive Vice President, Ron Weinstein, he was closing the doors on the Los Angeles Lazers of the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) and that if he ever wanted to &quot;create a professional indoor soccer league that played in the summer months, out from under the shadow of the NBA, NFL, NHL, NCAA Football and NCAA Basketball&quot;, he would support the endeavor. 
One year later, in late 1990, Ron Weinstein incorporated the Continental Indoor Soccer League with his business partner Jorge Ragde. They drafted all the necessary franchise documents to bring the league into fruition and create what was the first professional sports league to operate under the &quot;single entity&quot; formula in 1991. Buss later took a leave of absence from the project and was temporarily replaced by Phoenix Suns owner, Jerry Colangelo, who joined as one of the inaugural members of the league.

Colangelo and Weinstein took the lead role in working to attract NBA and NHL owners. Through Buss&#x27;s and Colangelo&#x27;s cooperative efforts they orchestrated two CISL meetings in conjunction with their own NBA Board of Governors meetings. The first was held in 1991 in Marina Del Rey and the second in New York City in 1992. CISL was launched with 7 teams committed to begin playing in the summer of 1993 with another eight contracted for 1994.

Monterrey La Raza made the CISL the first US league to have a team from Mexico participating. In 1995, a second Mexican team entered the league, the Mexico City Toros.

By the end of the 1995 season, the third year of the league, 50% of the teams were already profitable. In 1996, CISL signed a three-year agreement with FOX Sports to televise a game of the week nationally in prime time. That same year, the Indiana Twisters became the next expansion franchise admitted to the league.
In the fall of 1997, the surprising demise of the league took place primarily due to differences of direction between the NBA/NHL owners and three of the leagues non NBA/NHL teams: Dallas, Portland and Houston. They collaborated in an effort to leave the CISL and form their own league, The Premier Soccer Alliance. It is the opinion of many executives within the sports world, that indoor Soccer has never again reached the pinnacle of the CISL since operations formally ceased in the winter of 1998.

The Continental Indoor Soccer League Championship Trophy was titled the &quot;Lawrence Trophy&quot; named in honor of the commissioner and founder&#x27;s father, Lawrence Albert Weinstein.

<doc id="889200" wikidata="Q1364768" url="?curid=889200" title="Hubert Gough">
<text>General Sir Hubert de la Poer Gough ( ; 12 August 1870 – 18 March 1963) was a senior officer in the British Army in the First World War. A controversial figure, he was a favourite of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, and the youngest of his Army commanders.

Gough was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before commissioning into the 16th Lancers in 1889. His early career included notable service in the Second Boer War, and a more controversial role in the Curragh incident, in which he was one of the leading officers who threatened to accept dismissal rather than deploy into Protestant Ulster.

Gough experienced a meteoric rise during the First World War, from command of a cavalry brigade in August 1914, to division command at the First Battle of Ypres that autumn, to a corps at the Battle of Loos a year later. From mid 1916 he commanded the Reserve (later renamed the Fifth) Army during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. His tenure was marked by controversy around his leadership style, his perceived reputation as &quot;a thruster&quot;, and the efficiency of the organisation of his Army, especially relative to the reputation for caution and efficiency of Herbert Plumer&#x27;s Second Army. Fifth Army bore the initial brunt of the German spring offensive in March 1918, and Gough was relieved of his command.

After the war, he briefly held a command in the Baltic until retirement in 1922, and stood unsuccessfully for Parliament. Thereafter, after a brief spell at farming he made a new career for himself as a company director. Gough gradually re-emerged as an influential figure in military circles and public life, writing two volumes of memoirs. He was a senior commander in the London Home Guard in the Second World War and lived long enough to be interviewed on television in the early 1960s. Historians continue to study Gough&#x27;s career as a case study of how the BEF coped with rapid expansion, with officers commanding forces far larger than during their peacetime experience, of the degree of initiative which should be granted to subordinates, and of the evolution of operational planning under stalemate conditions, from an initial emphasis on achieving breakthrough (with attrition regarded as preliminary &quot;wearing out&quot;) to a stress on cautious advances under cover of massive, concentrated artillery fire.

==Early life==

Gough was born in London on 12 August 1870. He was born into an Anglo-Irish military family, the eldest son of General Sir Charles J. S. Gough, VC, GCB. As an infant, Gough went to India with his family late in 1870, but Gough and his brother Johnny were sent to a boarding school in England, and Gough did not meet his father, who was on active service in the Second Afghan War, again until he was sixteen.

==Early career==

Gough was educated at Eton College then at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was gazetted into the 16th Lancers as a second lieutenant on 5 March 1889. Although not particularly wealthy compared to other cavalry officers he distinguished himself as a rider, winning the Regimental Cup, and as a polo player. Many of his horses were provided for him by other officers.

Gough was promoted to lieutenant on 23 July 1890, and set out for India that autumn. He was promoted captain on 22 December 1894 at the relatively early age of 24. He served with the Tirah Field Force 1897–98 and on the Northwest Frontier.

Gough returned to England in June 1898, and sat the examination for entrance to the Staff College, Camberley. He married Margaret Louisa Nora Lewes (known as &quot;Daisy&quot;) on 22 December 1898.

==Boer War==
Gough started at Staff College, Camberley on 9 January 1899 but did not complete the course. Instead he was ordered on special service to South Africa on 25 October 1899, reaching Cape Town on 15 November. He was deployed to Natal, initially as instructor to one of the Rifle Associations (locally raised units of volunteer mounted infantry or light cavalry). Gough then served as ADC to Lord Dundonald, who was commanding mounted troops in Natal. In January 1900 he was promoted to brigade intelligence officer, a role which required a great deal of scouting.

On 1 February Gough was appointed, as a local unpaid major, CO of a Composite Regiment (a squadron of Imperial Light Horse, a squadron of Natal Carbineers and a company of 60th Rifles Mounted Infantry). He led his regiment to assist Buller&#x27;s third attempt (5–7 February) to cross the Tugela, and in the fourth attempt (14–27 February). He led the first British troops into Ladysmith (28 February), in defiance of written orders from Dundonald and there met his brother Johnnie who had been besieged inside the town. His meeting with George Stuart White was widely portrayed.

During the period of guerrilla warfare which followed, Gough&#x27;s Regiment was reinforced to a strength of 600 men. Along with Smith-Dorrien and Allenby, he served under the overall command of Lieutenant-General French. On 17 September 1901 he led the Composite Regiment, after inadequate reconnaissance, to attack what appeared a tempting target of Boers near Blood River Port, only to be taken prisoner with his entire force by larger Boer forces which had been out of sight. He later escaped. Gough was invalided home with a wounded right hand in January 1902,

==Edwardian era==
Gough returned as a Regular Army captain in the 16th Lancers on 23 August 1902, but the following month was appointed brigade major of the 1st Cavalry Brigade at Aldershot on 24 September 1902 with promotion to the substantive rank of major on 22 October 1902. His brevet rank of lieutenant colonel took effect the following day (23 October 1902).

Gough was appointed an instructor at the Staff College on 1 January 1904 and served there until 1906 under Colonel Henry Rawlinson as commandant. While there Gough was the first instructor to win the college point-to-point. Gough was promoted brevet colonel on 11 June 1906 and substantive lieutenant colonel on 18 July 1906, but continued to serve at the Staff College in his position. He was appointed commanding officer (CO) of the 16th (Queen&#x27;s) Lancers on 15 December 1907. He was still the youngest lieutenant colonel in the army. He was then placed on the half-pay list on 19 December 1910 and was promoted to full colonel on the same date.

On 1 January 1911 Gough was removed from half-pay and promoted to temporary brigadier general and appointed general officer commanding (GOC) of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade at the Curragh, taking over from Major General The Hon. John Lindley. In June 1912 he was created a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1912 Birthday Honours.

==Curragh incident==
With Irish Home Rule due to become law in 1914, the Cabinet were contemplating some form of military action against the Ulster Volunteers who wanted no part of it. Gough was one of the leading officers who threatened to accept dismissal in the ensuing Curragh incident.

On the morning of Friday 20 March, Arthur Paget (Commander-in-Chief, Ireland) addressed senior officers at his headquarters in Dublin. By Gough&#x27;s account (in his memoirs &quot;Soldiering On&quot;), he said that &quot;active operations were to commence against Ulster,&quot; that officers who lived in Ulster would be permitted to &quot;disappear&quot; for the duration, but that other officers who refused to serve against Ulster would be dismissed rather than being permitted to resign, and that Gough – who had a family connection with Ulster but did not live there – could expect no mercy from his &quot;old friend at the War Office&quot; (French). French, Paget and Ewart had in fact (on 19 March) agreed to exclude officers with &quot;direct family connections&quot; to Ulster. In offering his officers an ultimatum, Paget was acting foolishly, as the majority might have obeyed if simply ordered north. Paget ended the meeting by ordering his officers to speak to their subordinates and then report back. Gough also sent a telegram to his brother Johnnie, Haig&#x27;s Chief of Staff at Aldershot. Gough did not attend the second meeting in the afternoon, at which Paget confirmed that the purpose of the move was to overawe Ulster rather than fight.

That evening Paget informed the War Office by telegram that 57 officers preferred to accept dismissal (it was actually 61 including Gough). Gough was suspended from duty and he and 2 of his 3 colonels were summoned to the War Office to explain themselves.

===&quot;The peccant paragraphs&quot;===
Gough sent a telegram to the elderly Field-Marshal Roberts (who had been lobbying the King and arguing with John French (CIGS) on the telephone), purporting to ask for advice, although possibly designed to goad him into further action. After being reassured by Roberts that the deployment was purely precautionary, he confirmed to Spencer Ewart (on the morning of Sunday 22 March) that he would have obeyed a direct order to move against Ulster.

In another meeting at the War Office (23 March), Gough demanded a written guarantee from French and Ewart that the Army would not be used against Ulster (possibly influenced by Major-General Henry Wilson). At another meeting Seely accepted French&#x27;s suggestion that a written document from the Army Council might help to convince Gough&#x27;s officers. The Cabinet approved a text, stating that the Army Council were satisfied that the incident had been a misunderstanding, and that it was &quot;the duty of all soldiers to obey lawful commands&quot;, to which Seely added two paragraphs, stating that the Government had the right to use the &quot;forces of the Crown&quot; in Ireland or elsewhere, but had no intention of using force &quot;to crush opposition to the Home Rule Bill&quot;.

At another meeting after 4 pm Gough, on the advice of Henry Wilson (also present), insisted on adding a further paragraph clarifying that the Army would not be used to enforce Home Rule &quot;on Ulster&quot;, with which French concurred in writing. When H.H. Asquith (Prime Minister) learned of this he demanded that Gough return the document, which he refused to do. Asquith publicly repudiated the &quot;peccant paragraphs&quot; (25 March). French and Seely both had to resign.

==First World War==
===Early war===
====Cavalry brigade: Mons to the Marne====

At the outbreak of war in August 1914, Gough took the 3rd Cavalry Brigade to France, under the command of Allenby (GOC Cavalry Division). On 22 August an artillery battery under Gough&#x27;s command was the first British battery in France to open fire on the Germans. Gough&#x27;s brigade fought at the Battle of Mons (23 August). During the following days Gough detached himself from Allenby&#x27;s command and linked up with Haig&#x27;s I Corps on the BEF right. Allenby publicly laughed this episode off as &quot;only Gough&#x27;s little way&quot; but was privately furious both at Gough&#x27;s behaviour and at the way it was tolerated by French (Commander-in-Chief of the BEF) and Haig. Relations between Allenby and Gough were strained thereafter.

Gough&#x27;s brigade also fought at the Battle of Le Cateau (26 August). By 1 September they were at Villers-Cotterêts, south of the Aisne, after a retreat of 180 miles (100 miles as the crow flies), and at last linked up with I Corps, assisting a rearguard of Irish Guards in the last major action of the retreat. On 5 September Gough linked up for the first time with British transport and supplies.

====Cavalry division====

By the time of the Battle of the Marne 3rd and 5th Cavalry Brigades had been formed into &quot;Gough&#x27;s Command&quot;, an &quot;ad hoc&quot; cavalry force separate from Allenby&#x27;s Cavalry Division. On 15 September Gough&#x27;s Command, with the addition of supporting troops, was formed into 2nd Cavalry Division and he was appointed GOC on 16 September. The two cavalry divisions were formed into a Cavalry Corps under Allenby (9 September), and reached the Belgian border by train on 11 September.

2nd Cavalry Division was on the BEF western flank, and tried to turn the German west flank, but was forbidden to advance further by Allenby. On 14 October Gough linked up with Rawlinson&#x27;s IV Corps moving down from the coast, removing the danger of being cut off. Gough advanced again but met new German forces trying to turn the &quot;British&quot; flank; on 16 and 17 October the Germans held the River Lys against Gough. Entrenchment began on 20 October. Gough&#x27;s division, sometimes with as few as 2,000 men in the front line, was defending around Messines and Wytschaete. Gough was promoted to the rank of major-general on 26 October 1914, backdated to 15 September, the date on which his division had been formed. From 30 October to the night of 31 October – 1 November Gough&#x27;s small division, assisted by Indian and London Scottish Territorial troops, held Messines-Wytschaete Ridge against a strong attack from the south-east by von Fabeck.

Gough&#x27;s division returned to the front line at Hooge, near Ypres, on 12 February 1915. On 13 February he was offered a command in the expedition intended for Salonika (in the event these troops were sent to Gallipoli) but declined after consulting his brother and BEF Chief of Staff &quot;Wully&quot; Robertson. Johnnie Gough was wounded and died later in February. Haig, a shy man, liked Gough for his wit and open personality, and to some extent he replaced his dead brother as Haig&#x27;s confidant. Haig specifically asked for Gough to be attached to his forces in case he succeeded in &quot;breaking the enemy line&quot; at Neuve Chapelle (10–13 March); Gough&#x27;s division was in GHQ Reserve for that battle.

====Infantry division====
Gough was appointed GOC of the 7th Division on 18 April 1915, part of Rawlinson&#x27;s IV Corps, itself part of Haig&#x27;s First Army; Gough may have been appointed as a counterbalance to Rawlinson, with whom Haig had a wary relationship. Gough&#x27;s division was in reserve at Second Ypres (22 April).

Gough commanded 7th Division at the Battle of Aubers Ridge in May. 7th Division was in corps reserve on 9 May, and that night was ordered to relieve 8th Division in the line, ready to attack the next day. After protests from the brigadiers that the support trenches were full of men – alive, wounded and dead – Gough cancelled the relief on his own authority. He expected to be disciplined by Rawlinson, but instead his division was redeployed to the sector of Monro&#x27;s I Corps, where diversionary attacks were to be mounted to assist the French.

Gough and his artillery officer &quot;Curly&quot; Birch were given great freedom by Monro. They planned a few minutes&#x27; bombardment, leaving a gap to tempt the Germans out of their shelters (repeated several times in preceding days), while bringing some guns forward on muffled wheels for surprise. The assault began at 3:15 am on 16 May; the right of 7th Division was the only part of I Corps attack to succeed. The next day Gough made little further progress despite assistance from almost every First Army gun in range.

===Corps commander: Loos===
====Planning====
Gough was appointed GOC I Corps, still part of Haig&#x27;s First Army, and promoted temporary lieutenant-general on 13 July 1915. Gough, along with the other First Army corps commanders, was present at a meeting with Kitchener (Secretary of State for War) on 19 August. Gough, by his own account, &quot;flared up&quot; at Kitchener&#x27;s statement that the introduction of conscription was impractical.

Haig (13 August) had asked Gough to plan to take the Hohenzollern Redoubt (roughly north-east), while Rawlinson was to take Loos and possibly Hill 70 (roughly south-east to open a gap for the reserves to push due east to take Hulluch). Gough (22 August) proposed that 9th Scottish Division should &quot;rush&quot; the German positions on his left (Hohenzollern Redoubt, Fosse 8) just before dawn (4 am) after a barrage and gas attack, while the following night 7th Division would push through the Quarries to Citie St Elie.

====Initial attacks====
On 25 September poison gas was released to assist the British attack, despite the wind being unfavourable (i.e. likely to blow it back over British troops). Although Captain Ernest Gold (meteorological officer) and Maj-Gen Horne (GOC 2nd Division) were later blamed, Foulkes (the gas officer) later hinted that &quot;still higher authority&quot; may have been responsible, and a gas officer Lt Sewill recorded being told that the order came from Gough. At 5:20 am Gough had advised Haig that it was too late to cancel the gas release. However, Nick Lloyd argues that the fault lay with Haig for agreeing to the plan.

On Gough&#x27;s left 2nd Division met with heavy losses. On Gough&#x27;s right 7th Division captured the enemy first line with heavy loss. Gough was away from his headquarters for two hours that morning trying to discover why 28 Brigade on his left were not making progress. The GOC 28 Brigade, Major-General G. H. Thesiger, &quot;dissociated&quot; himself from orders to attack again at noon, making clear that they came from Gough. Orders only reached the two forward battalions just before noon, forcing them to attack at heavy loss after very little preparation. Gough made little mention of this episode in his memoirs, while the divisional history (1921) was scathing about it. Nick Lloyd argues that Gough displayed the aggression and impatience for which he was later to become notorious.

====Subsequent attacks====
Maj-Gen Edward Bulfin (GOC 28th Division, which between 27 September and 5 October tried once again to take Fosse 8, taken briefly by the British on 26 September) later told the Official Historian (in 1927) &quot;I have a very confused memory of Loos – a sort of horrid nightmare. I was under Hugh (sic) Gough – and I never want to serve under him again. I remember he ordered me to attack a Fosse – and of course the whole thing was hopeless.&quot; His colleague Brig-Gen Pereira (85 Brigade) recalled that Gough thought Bulfin slow and constantly ordered attacks without proper artillery support. 28th Division were much criticised by Haig and Gough (who issued them a stinging twelve point rebuke on 6 October) had fought hard in wet weather, against strong German resistance, winning two VCs.

====Ousting of Sir John French====
Gough began a corps-level inquiry into the lessons of the battle (10 October), which after a discussion with Haig was followed by an Army-level inquiry (20 October). Gough&#x27;s inquiry found that British attacks had been stymied by lack of grenades, but had come close to achieving a breakthrough in areas where the wind had carried British chlorine gas over the German lines.

With intrigues afoot to remove French from command of the BEF, Gough was one of the senior officers who spoke to Lord Haldane (9 October 1915) and George V (24 October 1915) against French. French was shortly forced to &quot;resign&quot; as Commander-in-Chief.

====Military ideas====
Gough later commented on the draft of the &quot;Official History&quot; (1926) that a limited attack at Loos would have been more sensible, as it could always have been reinforced if Joffre&#x27;s offensive succeeded, and was critical of Haig for – as so often – attempting to achieve decisive victory with insufficient means.

Notes from a conference held by Gough on 20 December 1915 show that he still thought in terms of the principles of warfare as taught at Staff College: he still expected an &quot;advance guard&quot; to move forward until, after two or three days, a plan had been decided on for deploying the bulk of British forces, whereas in reality, by 1917, the opening day would often prove the most effective of any offensive. Like many British generals, he blamed the failures of that year on human error in applying the principles of warfare, rather than on the need to concentrate artillery, learn new tactics, and allow senior officers to gain experience.

===The Somme 1916===
====Initial phases====
=====Training cavalry=====
Haig originally wanted to launch an offensive in Flanders, and told Gough to be prepared to take I Corps up to that sector. Haig had not completely abandoned his hopes at least as late as June.

Gough was appointed GOC Reserve Corps on 4 April 1916, which was to exploit any breakthrough achieved at the Somme. Gough spent most of the next two months supervising the training of the cavalry divisions. Gough&#x27;s staff had to liaise with XIII and XV Corps (on the right of Rawlinson&#x27;s Fourth Army) to draw up contingency plans in case &quot;things went as we hoped for&quot; and with Claud Jacob, whose II Corps was also earmarked for the exploitation. By mid-June Gough was also supervising the training of the 1st Indian Cavalry Division and 2nd Indian Cavalry Division.

=====Plans for exploitation=====
In May, after discussions with Rawlinson, Gough proposed that two brigades of cavalry should be used, one in the north (the Ancre Valley) and one in the south (Montauban), to assist the infantry in the event of a German collapse. His suggestion that a further entire cavalry division should be used in the north to help roll up the enemy second line, was vetoed by Haig, who thought the ground unsuitable.

Reserve Corps was renamed Reserve Army on 22 May 1916, In late June the plans were recast, despite the Battle of Verdun reducing the planned French contribution from 39 divisions to twelve. Instead of exploiting southeast to cover the flank of a French crossing of the Somme, Haig (memo to Rawlinson 16 June, Haig diary 21 June) now wrote that once Pozières Ridge was taken Gough was to exploit northeast to Bapaume and then once reinforced turn north to Monchy to take the German Arras positions in &quot;flank and reverse&quot;.

Haig told Gough (diary 27 June) he was &quot;too inclined to aim at fighting a battle at Bapaume&quot; but should instead be ready to push on, before the Germans had a chance to attack him from the North. Haig would have preferred Gough to take command of the two left hand corps (VIII Corps and X Corps) prior to the attack but instead, that evening, approved Rawlinson&#x27;s plan for Gough to set up HQ at Albert as soon as the Pozières Heights had fallen. By now Reserve Army had three infantry and three cavalry divisions. Research by Stephen Badsey among the surviving evidence suggests that the final plan was probably for Gough to exploit any breakthrough achieved in the initial attack with the 25th Division, followed by two of the three cavalry divisions, then the II Corps (three divisions).

=====Battle of Albert=====
In the afternoon of 1 July Haig, not yet aware of how badly the attack had gone in the northern sector, visited Gough and ordered him to &quot;move up&quot; in the evening. Gough visited Rawlinson in the afternoon (the third time that day) but was told that there would be no breakthrough that day, so he ordered cavalry to return to billets. At 7 pm Rawlinson put Gough in command of X and VIII Corps (the northern sector of the Somme front), with orders to &quot;push them on again&quot;. Taking command on 2 July, Gough reported that VIII Corps communication trenches were blocked with dead and wounded troops and X Corps was found to be little better. In the early hours of 3 July, Rawlinson ordered Gough to renew the attack, orders which Haig then countermanded.

Gough was ordered to attack towards Schwaben Redoubt to rescue British survivors of 1 July. Despite the preference of Haig and Rawlinson for minor attacks, they allowed Gough to attack a salient south-east of Thiepval, with six battalions from the 32nd Division and 49th Division. The attackers had no time to prepare, orders were delayed in transmission, 32nd Division was ordered to attack over a frontage of rather than the planned, and the attack was delayed from 0315 to 0600, to coincide with a Fourth Army attack at Ovillers. The artillery had already fired half its ammunition. Sheffield wrote that the attack was &quot;a complete shambles&quot;, but Gough was not entirely to blame and that it typified the &quot;chaos&quot; of British operations at that stage. Gough later claimed to have regretted the attack. In the afternoon of 3 July, Reserve Army was formally made independent of Fourth Army.

Over the following months most of the shells and heavy artillery would be supporting Rawlinson&#x27;s efforts, and although Gough was given extra guns later, he never had as many as Fourth Army. Haig&#x27;s orders were to &quot;sap&quot; with small penetrations to open up he German lines to flanking attacks. Kiggell wrote Gough a memo (4 July) that his role was to assist Rawlinson&#x27;s attacks, by pinning down German reserves and that he was to keep within the quantity of shells which he was given. In July Gough believed that frequent small attacks would keep casualties low and keep the Germans &quot;off balance&quot; – this was mistaken, as small narrow-front attacks allowed the Germans to concentrate their fire, so contributing to the massive British losses of that month.

Gough was promoted to the temporary rank of general on 7 July 1916, aged just 45. The Reserve Army took Ovillers on 16 July.

====Summer====

=====Pozières=====
The events of 1 July had shown that the German positions on VIII Corps sector and much of X Corps sector as well, were too strong to attack frontally. Gough&#x27;s efforts until early September consisted of attacks by two divisions of X Corps, later assisted by the newly arrived II Corps, assisting Rawlinson&#x27;s left flank. On only two occasions before 3 September, were efforts coordinated with that of the Fourth Army and one of those (22/23 July) by accident.

On 15 July, the day after the Fourth Army success at the Battle of Bazentin Ridge, Haig envisaged Gough exploiting up the Ancre valley, to attack the enemy on Third Army&#x27;s front (to Gough&#x27;s north) from the south. The Pozières sector was handed over from Rawlinson to Gough on 15 July, making the Albert–Bapaume Road the boundary between the two armies. When Fourth Army&#x27;s attacks again ran out of steam, Haig ordered Gough (18 July) to prepare for &quot;methodical operations against Pozières ... with as little delay as possible&quot;, to capture the summit of Thiepval Ridge and cover the left flank of Fourth Army&#x27;s advance. Haig sent some fresh divisions to X Corps and also deployed 1 ANZAC Corps, newly arrived on the Western Front, opposite Pozières. This was the most important attack yet expected of Gough.

Gough had to be dissuaded from launching 1st Australian Division against Pozières at 24 hours notice. Charles Bean, the Australian Official Historian, later wrote that on 18 July Maj-Gen Harold &quot;Hooky&quot; Walker, the British officer commanding 1st Australian Division, had been ordered to attack Pozières the following night. Walker was appalled by these &quot;scrappy &amp; unsatisfactory orders from Reserve Army&quot;, later recording in his diary his concerns that he would be &quot;rushed into an ill-prepared ... operation&quot;. I ANZAC Corps HQ had not yet arrived on the Somme and Walker, with &quot;the sweat on (his) brow&quot;, argued with Gough, as did his chief of staff Brudenell White, until Gough gave in. Walker later wrote (in 1928) that the incident was &quot;the very worst exhibition of Army commandship that occurred during the whole campaign, though God knows the 5th Army [as Reserve Army was later designated] was a tragedy throughout&quot;. Walker later wrote of how he had had to demand extra artillery, and only obtained permission to attack from the south east rather than the south west (the direction of previous unsuccessful attacks) as Gough wanted after taking Edward &quot;Moses&quot; Beddington, a staff officer whom Gough trusted, with him to reconnoitre the position. Haig advised Gough (20 July) to &quot;go into all the difficulties carefully&quot;, as that division had not fought in France before. Gough defended the ANZACs to Haig against &quot;tittle-tattle&quot; at GHQ by officers who had &quot;no idea of the real worth of the Australians&quot;. Gough later claimed (letter to Edmonds in 1939) he had given Walker no choice but had &quot;himself&quot; ordered the change in the direction of the attack.

The attack was delayed until 12:30 am on the night of 22/23 July and Pozières was taken, partly as a result of planning and partly as tired German troops were in the process of being relieved by fresh troops. The fall of Pozières on 22/23 July was the most successful part of a Big Push involving eight divisions, spread across five corps, from Pozières on the left to Guillemont on Rawlinson&#x27;s right (Rawlinson had decided to push ahead without the French after they had requested a postponement of their part of the offensive). After German counterattacks had failed, the Germans then subjected the village to several weeks of severe shelling.

=====Clashes with subordinates=====
Gough used his corps as &quot;postboxes&quot;, whereas Rawlinson was more tolerant of debate and discussion. Gough was reluctant to allow corps their normal role of control of artillery (he centralised artillery at Army level under Brigadier-General Tancred) and in planning operations. A memo of 16 July ordered that all points for bombardment by heavy howitzers must be selected at corps-level, and then, four days later, he ordered that after any bombardment, at whatever level it had been requested, daily reports were to be submitted to Army HQ. Neill Malcolm (Chief of Staff Reserve Army) recorded several instances in his diary (6 July, 13 July, 18 July) of corps commanders chafing at his &quot;interference&quot;. Before coming under Gough&#x27;s command, Hunter-Weston (GOC VIII Corps) wrote to his wife (1 July) of his personal liking for Gough – by 3 August he wrote to her that his staff were glad to be moving to the Second Army at Ypres, that Reserve Army staff had not run smoothly and that although he liked Gough and thought him &quot;a good soldier ... he is hardly a big minded enough man to make a really good Army Commander&quot;. He also complained of Gough&#x27;s &quot;impetuosity&quot; and &quot;optimism&quot;.

Gough also clashed badly with Philip Howell, Chief of Staff of II Corps. Howell thought Gough &quot;very loveable in many ways&quot;, if perhaps not quite sane, and &quot;really quite a child &amp; can be managed like one if treated as such &amp; humoured&quot;. By 24 July 1916 Howell was writing that Gough and Malcolm had &quot;managed to put everybody&#x27;s back up&quot; and throughout August 1916 complained repeatedly about Army-level micromanagement, with Reserve Army allegedly even taking direct control of four of 12th Division machine guns during an attack on 2 August. Philip Howell claimed (29 August 1916) that Jacob (II Corps), Percival (49th Division) and even Neill Malcolm (!) were terrified of Gough. Gough thought Howell a &quot;great thorn&quot; who spent much time &quot;trying to argue&quot;, avoiding fighting and disobeying orders. Howell was killed by shellfire in September.

Gough also clashed with Cavan (XIV Corps) (3 August). Gough&#x27;s attempts to micro-manage had little effect on the strong-minded Cavan.

=====Mouquet Farm=====
Gough ordered further attacks to seize the German OG1 and OG2 trenches north of Pozières, and to take Mouquet Farm (which lies approximately between Pozières and Thiepval). The first attack, by tired troops in the dark, failed. 1st Australian Division were withdrawn on 25 July and replaced by 2nd Australian Division. Sheffield &amp; Todman argue that Gough&#x27;s &quot;direct operational control&quot; of 2nd Australian Division on 29 July contributed to the failure of that attack, as Gough pressured Maj-Gen Legge to attack before preparations were complete. The German positions were on a reverse slope, so wire and machine gun positions could not be destroyed by bombardment. Bean blamed Legge for not standing up to Gough, and wrote that Brudenell White blamed himself for not doing so, although Sheffield argues that this is not entirely fair, as Legge, a &quot;colonial&quot;, should have had more support from Corps level.

By the end of July it was clear that the Germans were not about to crumble as Haig had hoped, and on 2 August he ordered Reserve Army to conduct methodical attacks in the area from Pozières to Mouquet Farm and Ovillers, as economically with men and munitions as possible, so as to draw in German reserves and thus assist with Rawlinson&#x27;s attacks on Gough&#x27;s right flank. Haig recorded (diary 3 August) that Gough had demanded &quot;reasons in writing&quot; from Legge, after the failure of the Australian attack. Gough had written to Birdwood (1 ANZAC Corps Commander) demanding an explanation and asking if the attack would have succeeded given &quot;greater energy and foresight on the part of the higher commanders&quot;. Birdwood refused to pass this note on to Legge as he thought it was &quot;essential to give (him) a fair trial&quot;. Legge&#x27;s second attack on Mouquet Farm, was better planned and succeeded on 4 August.

Gough now planned to capture Thiepval by converging attacks by the ANZACs from the east and by II Corps to the south west. This meant that the ANZACs had to attack along the crest of Thiepval Ridge, facing German fire from west, north and east. These attacks were often small in scale and were often not coordinated with II Corps attacks, let alone with Fourth Army, allowing the Germans – who knew the BEF plan from captured documents – a chance to concentrate their fire on the attackers.

Gough almost pushed Maj-Gen Robert Fanshawe (48th Division) (25 August) to the point of resignation. Gough complained to Haig (Haig diary 29 August) that &quot;the Commanders of the Australians are becoming less offensive in spirit! The men are all right...&quot; In over a month of fighting II Corps and I ANZAC Corps advanced towards Mouquet Farm and Thiepval. The BEF (not just ANZACs but also the 12th, 25th, 48th divisions and the Canadian Corps) suffered approximately 20,000 casualties in these attacks from 7 August to 12 September. The ANZACs had suffered 23,000 casualties in six weeks, a similar loss to what they had endured in eight months at Gallipoli.

Prior &amp; Wilson criticised Gough for his responsibility for what they called &quot;the Mouquet Farm fiasco&quot;, not least because at some point in September (documentary evidence of the exact date has not been found) Gough had changed his mind and decided to attack Thiepval solely from the front, rather than trying to outflank it via Mouquet Farm. Philpott believes that although Haig&#x27;s instructions were &quot;confusing and contradictory&quot;, Gough (and Rawlinson) share some responsibility for the costly nature of these small piecemeal attacks, whose supposed aim was to &quot;wear down&quot; the Germans, prior to the decisive breakthrough which Haig was hoping to achieve in September. In August, clearly still hopeful that decisive victory could be attained on the Somme, Gough wrote to one of his nephews: &quot;We are breaking in bit by bit and we must not stop until we have made the gap. It would be terrible to ask our men to begin their attacks all over again on fresh defences next year.&quot;

====Autumn====
=====Initial attack on Thiepval=====
A conference was held on 23 August to plan the attack on Thiepval, and the V Corps Chief of Staff (Brig-Gen Boyd) later brushed aside the GOC 6th Division&#x27;s objections that an afternoon attack was unwise. The next day detailed plans for each division&#x27;s attack were issued not at corps level but by Reserve Army.

3 September saw an attack by four divisions of Reserve Army from Pozières to the Ancre valley, simultaneously with an attack by Fourth Army. V Corps, extending Reserve Army operations into the Ancre valley for the first time, attacked towards St Pierre Divion and Schwaben Redoubt (north of Thiepval) to attack Thiepval from the &quot;north&quot;. II Corps (48th and 25th Divisions, moved up in mid-August) attacked Thiepval. These attacks failed. 4th Australian Division gained part of Fabeck Graben Redoubt north of Mouquet Farm, which was then lost by the Canadian Corps when it relieved 1 ANZAC Corps in the line.

The attack by 39th and 49th divisions (part of II Corps) failed, with some battalions taking between 30% and 50% casualties. Gough attributed the failure to lack of &quot;martial qualities&quot;, lack of &quot;discipline and motivation&quot;, &quot;ignorance on the part of the Commanding officers&quot; and &quot;poor spirit in the men&quot;, to which Claud Jacob, GOC II Corps, added &quot;want of direction&quot;, &quot;stage fright&quot;, and cowardice on the part of the brigadier, while also commenting adversely on the lack of casualties among the C.O.&#x27;s. V Corps, at Reserve Army&#x27;s insistence, sent a detailed critique of the operation to 39th Division. However, Gough took responsibility for not having cancelled the operation when it was clear surprise had been lost. He had lost an ADC wounded next to him as he observed attacks, his third during the war.

=====Assisting Rawlinson&#x27;s offensive=====
Gough had submitted (28 August) an ambitious plan for the capture of Courcelette on his right flank. This was rejected by Kiggell, who told him that he was to continue to conduct limited operations to assist Rawlinson with the Battle of Flers–Courcelette the next Fourth Army attack, which, if successful, would enable &quot;Rawlinson&quot; to attack Thiepval (on Gough&#x27;s front) from the rear. In the event Haig changed his mind at the last moment.

Two days before Flers–Courcelette, Haig (13 September) – over Rawlinson&#x27;s objections (Rawlinson diary 14 September) – ordered an attack on Martinpuich (Rawlinson&#x27;s left flank) and an attack by 2nd and 3rd Canadian divisions on Courcelette (Gough&#x27;s right flank) with a view to opening a gap which could be exploited by cavalry. Haig also urged Gough and Rawlinson (separately) not to neglect any opportunity to put the cavalry through, the ultimate aim being to take the Germans facing the Third and even First armies (to Gough&#x27;s north) from the rear. II and V Corps were also to make feint attacks at Thiepval. The Canadian assault on Courcelette was a great success. Gough wrote (to his brother Johnnie&#x27;s widow Dorothea, 23 September 1916) that many corps and division commanders were &quot;incompetent&quot; and that &quot;considerable exercise of firmness&quot; was needed to get them to obey orders.

=====Thiepval Ridge=====
After Flers-Courcelette (15 September), Haig, perhaps believing a decisive breakthrough to be imminent, initially envisaged Gough attacking Thiepval, together with further attacks by Fourth Army and by the French further south – an attack by ten divisions.

Gough&#x27;s plan was for 18th Division to capture Thiepval and Schwaben Redoubt, 11th Division to capture Mouquet Farm and Zollern and Stuff Redoubts (roughly north of Mouquet Farm) while on the right 1st and 2nd Canadian divisions were to attack from Courcelette to Regina Trench which lay just beyond the ridge line. Gough allocated all seven of his tanks (five of which broke down before reaching the lines) to the Canadians.

The preliminary bombardment began on 23 September. This was the heaviest barrage yet fired by Reserve Army, assisted by an indirect machine gun barrage into the German rear areas. Gough had 570 field guns and 270 howitzers to attack along a front (roughly twice the concentration of 1 July, but only half that of the Battle of Bazentin Ridge on 14 July and much the same as that of the Battle of Flers–Courcelette on15 September.

Allenby&#x27;s Third Army was to co-operate with an attack on Gough&#x27;s left flank (Haig diary 24 September 30 September).

In the event poor weather delayed the attacks until the early afternoon of 25 September. As Gough planned to use a few tanks to assist his attack, Haig ordered him to delay until the following morning when they could be concealed in the morning mist but in the event further delays, for which the reason is unclear, meant that Gough attacked at 12:35 pm on 26 September, exactly a day after Rawlinson and Foch.

Four divisions of Canadian and II Corps attacked between Courcelette and Schwaben. The Battle of Thiepval Ridge was Gough&#x27;s most ambitious operation to date. The attack of 26 September showed the improvement in British tactics. Mouquet Farm at last fell in the afternoon. On the western sector, lodgements were gained in Zollern, Stuff and Schwaben redoubts and British forces pushed to the edge of St Pierre Divion. Thiepval was surrounded and captured by Maxse&#x27;s highly trained 18th Division by 08.30 on 27 September. By 30 September, after fierce hand-to-hand fighting in which the British suffered 12,500 casualties, had been gained, an advance of between . Regina Trench and parts of Stuff and Schwaben Redoubts remained in German hands. This fighting demonstrated that, either attacking German positions with proper artillery support, or in hand-to-hand fighting in which artillery support mattered little, British volunteer infantry could fight as well as the Germans. The same would prove true in November. Gough&#x27;s capture of Thiepval (an original objective for 1 July) preserved his status with Commander-in-Chief.

=====Tactical ideas=====
A 5 October 1916 memo (over Neill Malcolm&#x27;s signature) for the guidance of division and brigade commanders (bypassing corps), sheds light on Gough&#x27;s tactical thinking. Although he understood the importance of the creeping barrage and of mopping-up parties, he was – unlike Rawlinson – uninterested in bite and hold tactics and tended to feel that opportunities would be lost if infantry were obliged to stop at a predetermined point to stick to an artillery plan.

He recommended aiming for deep advances into enemy positions, with troops attacking up to five consecutive preassigned objectives, with waves aiming for predetermined objectives in a conveyor-belt approach. Each brigade was to attack in up to eight &quot;waves&quot;: two battalions, making up the first four waves, were to take the first objective and another two battalions, perhaps deployed in columns for speed of movement, would then take the second, with &quot;no&quot; battalions held in brigade-level reserve (the argument being that orders would never reach them in time). He recommended that each &quot;division&quot; attack with two brigades and hold a third &quot;brigade&quot; in reserve, ready to take the third objective, by which time the first two brigades would have been reorganised to take the fourth objective. The fifth objective would require fresh troops.

He wanted commanders to keep as far forward as possible, even if it was not possible to keep in contact with their superiors by telephone, in order not to have to waste time sending junior officers forward to reconnoitre and report back. The brigade commander was to stay forward so that while the second objective was being assaulted they could reorganise the troops who had just taken the first objective, so that they could take the third. Divisional commanders were also urged to stay forward so that they could reorganise the attacking brigades so as to create their own reserve. Simpson comments that corps would have the benefit of RFC patrols to keep in touch, but their own reserves would be too far back to be of use, while heavy artillery controlled at corps level would be more important for counterbattery work and for the preliminary bombardment, rather than being needed during the infantry assault. Simpson also comments that all this was very similar to VIII Corps views prior to 1 July attacks, and that Reserve Army&#x27;s attacks in October were to be little more successful, although weather and mud made Gough&#x27;s task more difficult. Although it is true that opportunities for advance sometimes went begging for lack of initiative (e.g. at Bazentin Ridge on 14 July 1916), Sheffield argues that Gough was overly focussed on infantry rather than artillery tactics, and was demanding too much from his men.

Gough agreed with Haig&#x27;s suggestion (Haig diary 8 October) that &quot;the deterioration of the Enemy&#x27;s fighting qualities&quot; meant that it was not necessary for British troops to be protected by a barrage once they had captured an enemy position, as this would hamper reserves from pushing on to the next objective. General Bridges later wrote (in &quot;Alarms and Excursions&quot;) that &quot;With the true cavalry spirit, (Gough) was always for pushing on&quot;. Rawlinson (diary 9 October) recorded his concerns at Gough&#x27;s &quot;hourush tactics and no reserves, as they are not sound&quot;.

The fighting at Thiepval went on until November and was later criticised by the Official Historian for lack of co-ordination and excessive reliance on infantry &quot;elan&quot;.

=====Battle of the Ancre Heights=====
The Battle of the Ancre Heights (1 October – 11 November) was conducted further to the left of Gough&#x27;s sector. Haig issued orders (29 September) for further advances by Reserve and Fourth Armies. Gough was to attack Loupart Wood from the south and Beaumont Hamel from the west. The plan was for Reserve Army to advance and capture more ground in one battle than in three months of campaigning.

On 8 October, the 1st and 3rd Canadian divisions, on Gough&#x27;s right flank, assisted another of Rawlinson&#x27;s offensives by attacking unsuccessfully towards Le Sars and Regina Trench, only to be held up by German wire. Speaking to Haig that afternoon, Gough blamed the 3rd Canadian Division, claiming that in some cases they had not even left their trenches. Stuff Redoubt fell (9 October) to a battalion of 25th Division. Schwaben Redoubt was attacked unsuccessfully (9 October) in a surprise night attack with no barrage, then successfully on 14 October after a two-day bombardment. These costly penny-packet attacks sometimes involved little more than a single battalion. A big German counterattack was then repulsed. By this time Gough was discussing with Haig the possibility that the war might go on into 1917, requiring fresh offensives.

After two weeks of rain had rendered plans for exploitation unrealistic, Gough issued a new, more cautious plan (15 October), in which 45 tanks were to be used, although he was still under pressure from Haig to exploit to the north and north-east. Stuff and Regina Trenches (which ran approximately west–east north of a line from Thiepval to Courcelette) were then captured in a major attack by 35th, 25th, 18th and 4th Canadian divisions, completing the capture of the Ancre Heights. The battle testified to the revived German defence after their panic of September.

Wilson, whom Gough had disliked since the Curragh incident, commanded IV Corps first alongside then under Gough in 1916. Wilson commented in his diary (21 October) on reports of Gough micro-managing divisions and even brigades. That autumn Lord Loch told Wilson &quot;Goughie is the best hated &amp; most useless &amp; most dangerous General we have got&quot;.

After the success of 21 October, Gough once again presented more ambitious plans, with Haig offering (24 October) to place an extra two cavalry divisions (for three in total) at his disposal – this at a time when even quite minor infantry attacks on Fourth Army sector were having to be cancelled because of mud. Haig cautioned Gough to wait for three days of fine weather (26 October) before attacking again. Gough complained that Brigadier-General Radcliffe (chief of staff, Canadian Corps) &quot;made unnecessary difficulties&quot; (Haig Diary 30 October 1916).

Reserve Army was redesignated Fifth Army on 30 October 1916.

====The Ancre====
=====Political considerations=====
Gough fought the last major British attack on the Somme at the Ancre, beginning on 13 November. This was &quot;perhaps Gough&#x27;s finest hour as an offensive general&quot;, although a large part of its success was owed to delays because of the weather, which gave more time for planning and preparation and which forced the original plans (drawn up by GHQ in October) to be scaled back. Haig urged Gough (2 and 6 November) to wait for dry weather before proceeding. After continuous rain between 24 October and 3 November, Fifth Army was ordered (5 November) to conduct only a &quot;limited&quot; attack and authorised to wait until the weather was good enough.

Haig sent Kiggell (Chief of Staff BEF) to Gough&#x27;s HQ (8 November) to explain the motivation for the attack, although Kiggell stressed that Haig did not want the attack to proceed unless there were good prospects of success. The aim was to pin down German troops which might otherwise have been sent to Romania, to impress on the Russians that the BEF was still fighting, as well as strengthening Haig&#x27;s hand in the inter-Allied conference due to start at Chantilly on 15 November, at which the possible transfer of Western Allied troops to Salonika was to be discussed. Gough later recorded that the first murmurings against Haig&#x27;s leadership were beginning to be heard in London. Simkins suggests that Haig wanted to be able to blame Gough if the Ancre attack went wrong but take the credit if it succeeded.

Gough then consulted his corps commanders (10 November): Jacob (II Corps) was persuaded to try for deeper objectives as Fanshawe (V Corps) and Congreve (XIII Corps) wanted. The attack was agreed for 13 November. Staff officers and patrols inspected the ground and Gough (10–11 November) visited six divisional commanders and ten brigadiers, also seeing two battalion commanders at each brigade headquarters. He had asked his corps commanders to make similar inquiries. He found no consensus as to whether or not the ground was dry enough. The start time was set for 5:45 am after further consultations with Jacob, Fanshawe and divisional commanders.

Kiggell again visited Gough on 12 November – Gough later wrote (in &quot;The Fifth Army&quot;) of how any further delay would have had a bad effect on troop morale, and how after four dry days the prospects were as good as they were likely to be that winter, and of how he had sat looking out of the window turning over the decision in his mind after Kiggell had &quot;gravely elaborated the great issues at stake&quot; – that afternoon Haig also visited him and gave him the go-ahead (writing in his diary &quot;a success at this time was much wanted&quot; and &quot;I am ready to run reasonable risks ... (but given) the difficulties of ground and weather. Nothing is as costly as failure!&quot;)

Sheffield comments that this sequence of events indicates that Haig enjoyed warmer relations with Gough than with, say, Rawlinson, but also suggests that he felt the need to supervise him closely. He also comments that although Gough consulted his subordinates, it is unclear that he took their advice: Simon Robbins quotes evidence of warnings from some corps, division and brigade staffs that troops were exhausted and conditions too poor to attack. Neill Malcolm&#x27;s &quot;Memorandum on Operations&quot; (13 November 1916) recorded the political reasons for the attack.

=====Initial success=====
The Ancre attack employed 282 heavy guns and a creeping barrage, over an area which had not been heavily fought over so far, thus allowing men and guns to be moved more easily over relatively undisturbed ground. The volume of shells exceeded that put on the entire enemy line on 1 July. After a seven-day preliminary bombardment, 13 November saw an attack by 5 divisions, with 2 brigades on the flanks, the largest British attack since September. Lessons were also learned from previous battles: a mine was blown at Beaumont Hamel, simultaneously with the commencement of the artillery barrage, far more successfully than the mine which had been blown in the same area 10 minutes prior to the infantry assault on 1 July.

The attack began at 5:45 am, behind an effective creeping barrage, with the German machine guns on the crest behind Beaumont Hamel completely suppressed by 40 guns specifically given this task. The attack succeeded in the southern sector, where the 63rd Royal Naval Division took Beaucourt by 10:45 am, albeit with some attacking battalions taking 40–50% casualties, and the 51st Highland Division took Beaumont Hamel and St Pierre Divion, where the French practice was adopted of assigning a 4.5 inch howitzer to shell the entrance of each German dugout until the &quot;mopping-up&quot; platoons had reached them. However, further north in V Corps sector the attack on Serre was less successful because of mud and uncut wire, despite Gough visiting the sector at 2 pm to order further attacks. Those who fought at Beaumont Hamel thought it had been well-planned. Haig wrote in his diary (13 November) &quot;the success has come at a most opportune moment&quot;.

Gough ordered further attacks the next day (14 November), leading to the vicious local struggles for Munich and Frankfort Trenches. When he learned of this, Haig telephoned from Paris that he did not want any further attacks &quot;on a large scale&quot; until his return from the conference, but this news did not reach Gough until 9 am on 15 November, when the attack was about to begin, and after consulting his corps commanders Gough decided to proceed, a decision which Haig approved retrospectively that afternoon.
Sheffield writes that these attacks &quot;bore a distinct resemblance to the narrow-fronted, penny-packet attacks around Pozières and elsewhere in the summer, with the added complication of appalling weather.&quot;

Brigadier-General Home of the Cavalry Corps noted (15 November) that the rumours that Gough was to be promoted to Commander-in-Chief in Haig&#x27;s place were &quot;too comic as I don&#x27;t think they could ever make him do what they wanted&quot;.

=====Final stages=====
After the first attempt to take Munich and Frankfort trenches (15 November) failed, the commanders of 2nd and 51st Divisions were asked for detailed reports. Maj-Gen George Harper (GOC 51st Division) blamed the slowness of the creeping barrage, which caused his &quot;impetuous&quot; men to suffer casualties from friendly fire, and the fact that the attack had not been &quot;under one command&quot;. Maj-Gen W. G. Walker (GOC 2nd Division) commented that the attack had been too hurried, as his troops had not been familiar with the ground, and that Fanshawe (GOC V Corps) had rejected his requests for a delay and for a daylight attack. Gough forced 2nd Division to attack for two consecutive days despite protests from its commander (Walker) and chief of staff that the ground was impassable.

Malcolm issued a confidential memo to Corps Commanders (16 November) complaining about their tendency to query and argue about orders. Another &quot;Memorandum on Future Operations&quot; (16 November) discusses Fanshawe&#x27;s wish to attack because of &quot;a serious break on his front&quot;. Fanshawe held a conference of division commanders (16 November) to discuss the troop and barrage requirements for a renewed attempt.

George Jeffreys later testified that the GOC of 19th Division had complained of the difficulties of attacking at Grandcourt and Gough and his staff &quot;had simply no conception of conditions in the forward area&quot;. Gough later demanded to know why that division had not left 58th Brigade in the line for a further 24 hours, which &quot;show(ed) ... that he had no notion of the physical strain on the troops of even a few hours in the line under such conditions&quot;.

The first snow of the winter fell on 18 November. The attacks on 18 November suffered around 10,000 casualties. One officer of II Corps later wrote to Edmonds (in 1936) that it had been a &quot;cruel useless sacrifice of life&quot; with men dead from exhaustion in trying to crawl out of the mud, and that given the weather it was obvious &quot;to the very stupidest brain that no success could possibly result&quot;. Haig called off the battle. Kiggell later wrote to Edmonds (in 1938) &quot;the later stages of the fight were hardly justified, but Gough was so keen and confident the C-in-C decided to permit them&quot;.

A few days later 32nd Division relieved 2nd Division in the line, and their attack would also fail, partly as a result of inaccurate bombardment as 2nd Division staff had not been able to give them an accurate description of where the front line actually was. Gough exercised almost personal control of 32nd Division in fighting for Frankfort Trench from 18 November onwards. The GOC, William Rycroft, was apprehensive of Gough because of the failure of 3 July and was said by his GSO1 (chief of staff), the future Maj-Gen Wace, to be &quot;terrified of Gough&quot; and on learning in October 1916 that his division was returning to the Somme had remarked &quot;wryly that it would be his undoing unless we went to Rawly&#x27;s Army&quot;, however &quot;lack(ed) the kick in him to stand up to Gough, when all initiative was taken out of his hands&quot;. Wace later testified to Edmonds (in 1936) that during the planning for the Ancre orders came down, via Corps, as being very clearly the Army Commander&#x27;s decision. Rycroft only received the orders at 9:45 pm the night before and called it &quot;another of Gough&#x27;s mad ideas&quot;, and was simply told what orders he was to issue, even for the location of Advanced Brigade Headquarters. After the attack failed Gough sacked up to seven senior officers of 32nd Division, including Rycroft and two brigadiers, one of whom was Jenkins, GOC 75th Brigade.

Gough rebuked Fanshawe in writing (21 November) for lack of grip, and for failing to issue detailed written artillery orders, during 15 November attack. On his copy of the report, against the comment that copies of Gough&#x27;s remarks were to be sent to the two divisional commanders, Fanshawe wrote &quot;I hope not all of them&quot; and protested in the margin that he had been in telephone contact with divisions throughout. Simpson criticises Gough for his &quot;poor reasoning and indifference to the views of the men on the spot&quot;, although he is also critical of Fanshawe for attempting to blame his own subordinates. Sheffield writes &quot;Some of Gough&#x27;s points were fair, if harshly expressed, but others were not; some were based on factual inaccuracies. All this suggests a commander who had an incomplete grasp of the realities of the battle.&quot; He also remarks on Gough&#x27;s deliberate humiliation of Fanshawe in front of the latter&#x27;s subordinates. Walker was relieved of command of 2nd Division on 27 December.

Gough was awarded the KCB in 1916.

====Gough and the BEF&#x27;s &quot;learning curve&quot;====
Gough practised top-down command to a degree which was unusual in the British Army of that era, with its culture, evolved in an army designed for fighting small colonial wars, of leaving decisions to &quot;the man on the spot&quot;. Andy Simpson argues that although Gough&#x27;s command methods were clearly more prescriptive than those of Rawlinson&#x27;s Fourth Army, in which a 20-page summary of division commanders&#x27; views was circulated in late August, given Rawlinson&#x27;s lack of grip this was not necessarily a bad thing. Simpson argues that Gough&#x27;s hands-on control may have been at Haig&#x27;s urging, given Haig&#x27;s dissatisfaction with Rawlinson, and suggests that this may also have been a factor in Gough being employed in major offensives in 1917, whereas Rawlinson was not. Michael Howard cited Gough&#x27;s love of micro-managing divisions as evidence that he had been overpromoted, and Gary Sheffield concedes that Gough&#x27;s reputation for touring the trenches to spot dirty rifles suggests that he had found it hard to adapt to his greater responsibilities.

Sheffield argues that Gough&#x27;s behaviour was to some extent an attempt to answer the dilemma noted by Malcolm (diary 29 June 1916). Malcolm believed that a &quot;happy medium&quot; had been attained between Army maintaining control of operations and delegating decision-making to the &quot;man on the spot&quot; as prescribed by &quot;Field Service Regulations&quot;. Sheffield describes that claim as &quot;misplaced&quot;. The BEF had recently grown from 7 divisions to 70 – the Army had not anticipated or trained for the challenges of officers having to command large formations, nor for trench warfare, nor for the difficulties in communication (which would remain until battlefield radios came into use) involved. Officers&#x27; personalities, and how they related with one another, mattered a great deal in how they managed these changes. Part of Gough&#x27;s concern at micromanaging plans may have been because he knew that once an attack had begun he would have little chance to influence the results.

Sheffield observes that Haig was himself grappling with the dilemma of the degree to which subordinates should be &quot;gripped&quot;, and so often gave Gough unclear guidance. Gough himself also had a tendency to ignore orders from above when it suited him, the very tendency he abhorred in his own subordinates.

Some of Gough&#x27;s ideas were adopted in other armies: Fourth Army&#x27;s document &quot;Artillery Lessons of the Battle of the Somme&quot; (18 November) reflected Gough&#x27;s prescriptive approach rather than the delegation encouraged under &quot;Field Service Regulations&quot;, or practised by Rawlinson during the Somme. On the other hand, the tactical manual SS144 &quot;The Normal Formation for the Attack&quot; (February 1917) was a compromise between Gough&#x27;s view and the opposite view, that each infantry wave should take and consolidate just &quot;one&quot; objective, with &quot;fresh&quot; units being fed through to take deeper objectives.

===Spring 1917===
====Advance on the Ancre====
On 1 January 1917, Gough was promoted to permanent lieutenant general, while continuing to hold the temporary rank of full general. He was awarded the GCVO in 1917.

Early in 1917 Gough conducted minor operations aimed at &quot;improving our position &amp; hustling the Bosche&quot; (letter to the King&#x27;s adviser Clive Wigram, 7 January). Birdwood, then commanding I ANZAC Corps, which had briefly been part of Fourth Army, was &quot;very sick&quot; (Rawlinson diary 26 January) at the prospect of having to serve under Gough again. Limited operations were conducted between 10 January and 13 February (at which point there was a cold snap), to seize points of high ground off the enemy. In mid February, having heard reports that the German trenches opposite were thinly held, Gough ordered his divisional commanders to prepare for a general advance. Reconnaissance was hampered by German air superiority. Beginning on the night of 23/4 February the Germans conducted a limited withdrawal on the Ancre Heights which allowed operations to be stepped up by 63rd, 18th and 2nd Divisions, and by 1 ANZAC Corps. Fifth Army occupied Miraumont, Serre and Pys. Brigadier-General Cumming later (in 1922) recalled Gough&#x27;s visit to the headquarters of 91 Brigade in February 1917. Gough&#x27;s demands for an immediate advance were impractical owing to the state of the ground and the exhaustion of his troops, and only Gough&#x27;s departure had allowed his staff to get on with preparing the next day&#x27;s operations.

When his enemy Wilson was appointed (March 1917) to head Anglo-French liaison at French GQG, Gough wrote to Stamfordham (i.e. for the King to see) complaining of how Wilson had made little impact either as a staff officer in 1914 or in 1916 as a corps commander, but had a great reputation throughout the army for intrigue and for &quot;talk&quot;.

With relations between the French Commander-in-Chief Nivelle and the British generals becoming particularly strained, Nivelle asked the British government (7 March 1917) that Haig be sacked and replaced by Gough. Haig openly confronted Gough about the rumours (which Lord Esher had recorded in his diary on 9 March). Gough, to his own ultimate detriment (and unlike Haig) made little effort to cultivate the press. Gough&#x27;s own view of the Calais Scheme to place the BEF under Nivelle&#x27;s command was that it would leave Britain a puppet of France as Serbia and Rumania were of Russia, and Austria-Hungary of Germany, and correspondingly likely to be cheated at the peace conference after the war.

Fifth Army stormed the German intermediate line, which had been reached by the end of February, on 10 March.

====Advance to the Hindenburg Line, Arras and Bullecourt====
Haig had ordered Gough to prepare a major offensive, in &quot;bites&quot; but with &quot;the object of breaking the enemy&#x27;s front and attracting as many of his reserves as possible&quot; to coincide with Allenby&#x27;s offensive, originally due to start on or after 15 March.

On 14 March V Corps was repulsed from Bucquoy on the north of Gough&#x27;s sector; Gough later claimed that he had thought the enemy defences too strong but had permitted the attack at the request of the corps commander.
By now Gough had a reputation among junior officers for &quot;heavy losses and complete failure&quot; &quot;very typical of Gen Gough, who apparently does not care a button about the lives of his men&quot; (Brigadier-General Hodgkin&#x27;s Diary, 14 March). He had a reputation for &quot;terroris(ing) those under him to the extent that they are afraid to express their opinions for fear of being (sacked)&quot; (Haldane Diary 31 March).

Allenby was annoyed at the apparent favouritism shown to Gough at Army Commanders&#x27; conferences. Gough was allowed to expand Fifth Army&#x27;s role in Arras beyond what had originally been intended. Gough commanded the southern part of the offensive (Horne&#x27;s First Army attacked in the north, including the famous Canadian attack on Vimy Ridge, while the main attack was conducted by Allenby&#x27;s Third Army in the centre). 4th Cavalry Division was allotted to Gough&#x27;s sector to exploit any breakthrough achieved.

Building on his experiences on the Aisne in September 1914, Gough formed mixed brigades of infantry, cavalry, artillery and engineers during the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line in mid March. 2–9 April saw costly fighting on the outskirts of the Hindenburg Line. Over the protests of the ANZAC Commanders Gough launched an attack at (First) Bullecourt (10–11 April), described by Sheffield as &quot;hasty, ill-prepared and ultimately disastrous&quot; ... &quot;the infantry plan was disrupted at a late stage by Gough&#x27;s ill-fated employment of tanks&quot;. 4th Australian Brigade lost three-quarters of their men in action, 12th Australian Brigade half of each battalion engaged. Simkins writes that &quot;(Haig) yet again indulged Gough&#x27;s tendency to launch precipitate and ill-considered attacks&quot;, while Prior &amp; Wilson describe the attack as &quot;singularly barren&quot;. Bullecourt became known as the &quot;Blood Tub&quot;.

Gough was ordered (Haig diary 14 April) to prepare to &quot;pierce&quot; the Hindenburg Line &quot;astride the Bapaume–Cambrai Road&quot; if Allenby&#x27;s main attack made sufficient progress. Gough attended an Army commanders&#x27; conference on 16 April. With the Arras offensive bogging down, he later declined to conduct further infantry attacks as part of the 23 April push, restricting his efforts to artillery only.

At the Army Commanders&#x27; Conference on 30 April 1917 Haig, who had just been told that Nivelle was to be sacked, still expected Italian and (contrary to the War Office view) Russian offensives to take place that year. He told the Army commanders that he was not entirely clear what the BEF would be doing for the rest of the year but that he wanted to &quot;shift the centre of gravity up to the Second Army&quot;. In the afternoon after the conference he told Gough that he was to command the proposed Flanders Offensive, and ordered him to speak to Colonel Macmullen (who had presented plans, later abandoned, for a tank-led assault at Ypres) and visit the workshop at Erin, where tanks were being prepared for Operation Hush, a proposed amphibious landing on the Belgian Coast.

The Second Battle of Bullecourt (3–15 May) was &quot;memorably bloody and ill-rewarded&quot;. Sanders Marble writes: &quot;The results could largely have been predicted before so many lives were lost. Hasty attacks failed with heavy losses. Once adequate time was allowed for preparations the village was finally wrested from the Germans ... it was not the BEF&#x27;s finest hour&quot; Bullecourt &quot;did not win many plaudits&quot; and further worsened Gough&#x27;s reputation in the eyes of the Australians.

===Third Ypres===
==== Planning the offensive ====
While Gough was fighting at Bullecourt, Haig unveiled the timetable for Third Ypres at an Army Commanders&#x27; conference at Doullens (17 May). Haig may well have chosen Gough to spearhead Third Ypres because his aggression and preference to attack &quot;at the hurroush&quot; contrasted with the more cautious tactics favoured by Rawlinson and Plumer, and perhaps also because his inexperience and lack of knowledge of the Ypres Salient made him more willing to do Haig&#x27;s bidding. Haig&#x27;s admiring biographer John Terraine later wrote that putting Gough in charge of the early stages of Third Ypres was &quot;Haig&#x27;s greatest and most fatal error&quot;. The war correspondent Repington and the CIGS, General Robertson, agreed with one another as early as 5 July 1917 that Plumer should have been chosen because of his knowledge of the Ypres Salient, and Gough himself later came to agree.

Gough later wrote highly of Maxse (XVIII Corps), Jacob (II Corps) and Congreve (XIII Corps), his corps commanders in 1917, although not of Watts (XIX Corps). However, Simon Robbins suggests that the &quot;climate of fear&quot; still pervaded throughout Fifth Army in 1917 and even into 1918. Gough held his first corps commanders&#x27; conference on 24 May 1917, before he had moved his HQ to the Ypres sector – the composition of divisions and corps for Third Ypres had already been chosen by this point. Simpson argues that by this time, possibly because staff officers had become more experienced at their jobs, Fifth Army&#x27;s approach appears to have become &quot;more hands-off and consultative&quot; than in 1916, e.g. suggesting that each corps hold two divisions in the front and two in reserve. On 30 May Gough moved his HQ to Lovie Chateau two miles outside Poperinghe, and the HQ was up and running by 2 June.

Much of the tactical discussion concerned how far the British infantry should realistically be expected to push. The immediate targets were the Black Line, just under forward, the Green Line further on and the Red Line further. Gough agreed with Maxse&#x27;s proposal (31 May) for attacks just before sunset (giving troops more rest prior to the attack, and the Germans less time to counterattack) and advancing further than the Black Line to the River Steenbeck. Gough agreed that opportunities had gone to waste at Arras (9 April) as the initial attack had not been pressed hard enough. At the next corps commanders&#x27; conference (6 June) Gough declared that &quot;should the enemy be thoroughly demoralised during the initial attack, it might be possible to gain portions of the Red Line (at that stage still a second day&#x27;s objective) during the first 24 hours,&quot; although he was keen to distinguish between a bold attack against a crumbling enemy and &quot;an organized attack against ... organized resistance&quot;. A document circulated on 7 June stressed that platoon, company and battalion commanders were to be urged to act with initiative to seize ground, in the hope of repeating the successes of 1 July 1916 (the First Day of the Somme, on the southern part of the British line), 13 November 1916 (the first day of the Ancre) or 9 April 1917 (the first day of Arras). Simpson comments that as adequate field artillery support on the first day would only extend as far as the Green Line in places, &quot;a repulse was almost inevitable&quot; for those units which pushed on further, and that Gough still did not appear to realise that an offensive might stall because of stronger German resistance and counter-attacks, rather than from lack of initiative among junior officers.

====Failure to exploit Messines====
After his victory at Messines, and in accordance with prior plans, Plumer ordered II and VIII Corps to exploit German disorganisation by attacking the Gheluveld Plateau. When their patrols encountered resistance (8 June), Haig asked Plumer to launch this attack at once, instead of waiting three days to redeploy sixty heavy and medium guns as arranged. When Plumer, after consultation with his corps commanders, declined to be rushed in this way, Haig placed II and VIII Corps under Gough&#x27;s command, ordering him to prepare to seize the area around Stirling Castle. Gough, despite being given Plumer&#x27;s plan (9 June), did not then make any such attack, and at the next Army Commanders&#x27; Conference (14 June) stated that he had not wanted to push his men into the small salient which such an attack would achieve, and that he wished to attack the Gheluveld Plateau &quot;simultaneously&quot; with his main attack (Gough later described this as &quot;a slight change of plan&quot; and also claimed that he did not want to rush into an advance because of his experience at Bullecourt). Haig approved this, and stated at the conference that he hoped to capture Passchendaele–Staden–Klerken Ridge on 25 July. The failure to seize the Gheluveld Plateau (the German Army Group Commander, Crown Prince Rupprecht, had recorded in his diary on 9 June that the area might have to be abandoned) was to have unhappy consequences.

Besides the four divisions of II and VIII Corps (VIII Corps, still under Hunter-Weston, was soon moved out of the sector) Gough was also given another four of Plumer&#x27;s divisions at the end of June, together with two from GHQ Reserve. Another six were transferred from Horne&#x27;s First Army. (This makes a total of 16 divisions: Farrar-Hockley states that he also had a division in Army reserve, with another in GHQ Reserve close by). Plumer, now left with only 12 divisions, was also required to transfer half his artillery and all his tanks to Gough.

====Final plans====
The Germans had between five and seven (on the Gheluveld Plateau) defensive lines, and their positions had been strengthened since mid-June by Colonel von Lossberg. The fourth position, Flandern I, was away. Intelligence reports, filed mistakenly with the Messines operations in the Australian War Memorial, show that Fifth Army was largely aware of the digging of the German defences throughout June.

After another corps commanders&#x27; conference on 26 June, results of the discussions were published as orders. Gough planned a four-phase attack across a front of : &quot;a series of organised battles&quot;. First the enemy&#x27;s front system (the crest of Pilckem Ridge and the edge of Shrewsbury forest on the Gheluveld Plateau) was to be taken, then the second line after a pause of 30 minutes. After a pause of four hours the third objective was to be attacked – advancing to the River Steenbeek, entering Polygon Wood and taking the German third line, in front of which lay their field (as opposed to heavy) artillery and counterattack reserves – for a planned advance of in total, i.e. up to the Green Line. Army was to control artillery initially, which would then be delegated to corps an hour after the third objective had been taken. There would then, &quot;without any settled pause&quot; and &quot;either immediately or within a few hours&quot; be a fourth phase: an extra , taking the attackers to Passchendaele Ridge itself at Broodseinde, with the left flank along Gravenstafel spur to Gravenstafel and Langemarck (the Red Line). Although the &quot;strength&quot; of the fourth advance was to be left to the discretion of divisional commanders, Gough, in the words of the Official Historian, &quot;instead of confining his first day&#x27;s operation to a short fixed advance, was in favour of going as far as he could&quot;, and more than twice as deep than Rawlinson and Plumer had earlier recommended. All available heavy artillery was to be ready to lay a protective barrage in front of the fourth objective, where Gough expected that resistance by German reserves would be met. However, if little opposition was met, a further advance was to be made that same afternoon to Passchendaele Village itself (technically a fifth objective, although not specifically numbered as such), an objective which Gough more realistically hoped to attain on the third or fourth day. Haig did not interfere, and Gough would later tell the Official Historian that Haig had hoped to reach the Belgian coast within a matter of weeks.

Brigadier-General &quot;Tavish&quot; Davidson, Director of Military Operations at GHQ, now (25 June) proposed that Gough make jumps of &quot;not less than and not more than &quot;, while also recommending jumps of only about a mile (). This would enable greater concentration of artillery fire, while attacking troops would be less disorganised and less vulnerable to counterattack, as well as being better able to maintain their morale and to be relieved by fresh troops, ready for an advance to the Red Line three days later. Although Davidson later wrote that Haig had seen and approved his memorandum, Haig&#x27;s diary makes no mention of it. Gough&#x27;s response to the memorandum declared himself &quot;in agreement&quot; with the &quot;broad principles&quot; of &quot;a continuous succession of organised attacks&quot; but criticised Davidson&#x27;s suggestion that major attack could be mounted every three days, Gough thinking ten days a more realistic interval. Gough and Maxse (who wrote &quot;BALLS!&quot; on his copy of Davidson&#x27;s paper) agreed with one another that opportunities for further advance should be taken, and blamed the failures at Arras after 11 April, on renewed attacks without adequate artillery preparation. By Davidson&#x27;s later account, at a conference on 28 June, Plumer also favoured permitting local commanders to attempt a deeper advance. Gough would later claim (in the 1940s) that he had wanted a shallower advance but had been overruled by Haig and Plumer – this appears to be at best a false recollection, if not a lie.

Simpson wrote that Gough&#x27;s wish to allow infantry to push forward was &quot;more cautious than is usually supposed&quot;. Rawlinson was not involved in these discussions and his view that Gough wanted to go forward at the &quot;Hurroosh&quot; may well be more a comment on his knowledge of Gough&#x27;s temperament than a strictly accurate description of Gough&#x27;s plans by this stage.

====Eve of the offensive====
Haig briefed Gough (diary 28 June) that &quot;the main advance&quot; should be limited until the Gheluveld Plateau had been secured as far as Broodseinde. Haig was principally concerned that Gough was not giving sufficient weight to the attack on Gheluveld Plateau. Prior &amp; Wilson write: &quot;It is not evident that Gough allowed these views greatly to influence the disposition of his forces&quot;. The boundary of Fifth Army was extended south, placing another of Plumer&#x27;s divisions under II Corps, so that Sanctuary Wood could be assaulted, lest the Germans there subject the attackers of the Gheluveld Plateau to enfilade fire. A XIV Corps memorandum states that they had sufficient high-explosive shell but insufficient heavy guns to bombard as thoroughly as they would have liked. Prior &amp; Wilson point out that, had Gough followed Haig&#x27;s advice to concentrate more weight against the Gheluveld Plateau, that would have reduced the effectiveness of the attack on his left and centre, but also argue that more heavy guns could have been obtained from Rawlinson&#x27;s forces (threatening a diversionary attack along the Belgian Coast) and Plumer&#x27;s Second Army (some of which was attacking the Gheluveld Plateau, but some of which was mounting largely fruitless diversionary attacks further south).

Rawlinson urged the CIGS Robertson (29 June) of &quot;the desirability of holding on to Goughy&#x27;s coat tails and ordering him only to undertake the limited objective and not going beyond the range of his guns&quot;. He repeated this advice to Haig over dinner (3 July) although he was concerned that Haig would not insist hard enough. Aylmer Haldane recorded in his diary (30 June 1917) his lack of keenness at going to Fifth Army and wrote that Gough was &quot;very impetuous and difficult to get on with&quot; as well as &quot;excitable and thoughtless and impatient&quot;.

Another memo by Gough (30 June) raised the possibility that open warfare might be attained after 36 hours, although &quot;this is a result which we can hardly hope to attain until the enemy has been beaten in two or three heavy battles.&quot; Haig annotated this to insist that the capture of Passchendaele–Staden Ridge, not just the defeat of the German forces, must be the object of the offensive. Gough expressed scepticism to Robertson and King George V when they visited Fifth Army Headquarters on 3 July about Haig&#x27;s &quot;illusion&quot; that the advance would be rapid – he said &quot;we would be lucky to reach Roulers in two months&quot;. Like Plumer, Gough believed that Haig was being fed an exaggerated picture of German weakness by his intelligence advisor Charteris.

In his instruction of 5 July, Haig ordered that Passchendaele–Staden Ridge was to be taken within weeks, and that thereafter a chance for the &quot;employment of cavalry in masses is likely to occur&quot; as they exploited towards Bruges, Roulers and Ostend. Haig hoped to reach Roulers by 7–8 August, in time for Fourth Army to catch the high tides for their coastal operations.

====Pilckem Ridge====
The bombardment began on 16 July. The battle was to have commenced on 25 July. Gough was granted three extra days for bombardment as it had taken longer than expected to get heavy artillery into place. A further delay was granted for General Anthoine (commanding the French Army on Gough&#x27;s left flank) as bad weather was hampering his counter-battery programme. Haig noted in his diary (23 July) that three of the four British corps commanders (but not Jacob of II Corps) welcomed the delay for the same reason (Charteris later described the conference as &quot;definitely heated&quot; and Haig as &quot;very moody&quot; after he had to bow to their wishes for a further delay). Fifth Army intelligence at the time recorded weather conditions as &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; for much of the pre-31 July period (making it difficult for aircraft to spot German batteries behind Passchendaele Ridge and the Gheluveld Plateau, or for sound-ranging to operate in the prevailing westerly wind).

Walter Guinness wrote of the slipshod staff planning, engineering and signalling arrangements of Fifth Army in 1917: &quot;None of the lessons taught by Plumer&#x27;s success seem to have been learned.&quot; He recorded in his diary (23 July 1917) that there was &quot;little confidence&quot; in Gough.

On 31 July the attack was relatively successful on the left (Anthoine&#x27;s French, Cavan&#x27;s XIV Corps (which took its objectives up to the Black Line before running into counterattacks), and to some extent Maxse&#x27;s XVIII and Watts&#x27; XIX (both of which reached beyond the Green Line in places, although they did not take St Julien, and were driven back to the Black Line by counterattacks in places), but less so in Jacob&#x27;s II Corps attacking the Gheluveld Plateau, where counterbattery work had not been good enough to silence German artillery). Despite initial German concerns at the success of the British attack in the left and centre, the German counterattack was conducted by Eingreif divisions which had survived further back towards Passchendaele Ridge, and artillery operating from and behind Passchendaele Ridge and the Gheluveld Plateau. British infantry training had proven relatively effective, but German artillery and the poor light and state of the ground caused a breakdown in communications, making it hard to bring up reinforcements.

Edmonds later stressed in the &quot;Official History&quot; that after four days Gough&#x27;s men were less than halfway to their first day objectives and had lost 30–60% of their fighting strength. Prior &amp; Wilson point out that the attack had captured 18 square miles, including two of the German defensive lines on the left, at a cost of 27,000 casualties and inflicted approximately equal German casualties (as opposed to the First Day of the Somme, which had captured 3.5 square miles, for a cost of 57,000 British casualties, with minimal German losses). Ypres had been almost entirely removed from enemy observation. However, the attack had failed to capture the Gheluveld Plateau, and infantry pushing too far ahead had been vulnerable to counterattack. Farrar-Hockley writes that at the time &quot;the results were not considered disappointing.&quot; John Lee writes that the results on 31 July were &quot;mixed&quot;, with much of the ground taken lost, even on the first day, to &quot;stupendous&quot; counterattacks and that attempts to push forward after initial success led to &quot;less than happy results&quot;. Andy Simpson writes of &quot;the limited nature of the debatable success&quot;. It came on to rain on 31 July.

====Early August====
Gough had issued orders for II Corps to capture the Third objective (Tower Hamlets and Polygon Wood) on the Gheluveld Plateau, but at a Corps Commanders&#x27; conference on the evening of 31 July Jacob told him that this was not on, as the 30th Division had been pushed back to or just behind the first objective. Gough ordered II Corps to make a limited advance on the Gheluveld Plateau to reach the Black Line (the original second objective) on 2 August, while the other three corps were to retake the ground lost to counterattacks on 31 July and to reach the Green Line (the original third objective) on 4 August, and to take Langemarck, with the Red Line (the limit beyond which opportunist exploitation was not to pass) to be taken at a later date. Haig agreed.

Haig urged Gough (Haig diary 31 July) to stick to &quot;the original plan&quot; and consolidate the ground gained and prepare for the next advance &quot;only after adequate bombardment and after dominating the enemy artillery&quot;. Davidson (1 August) objected to hurried preparations, the use of &quot;part worn&quot; troops, and recommended Gough wait for two or three days of good flying weather to allow &quot;careful and accurate (artillery) shooting&quot;. Haig now agreed with Davidson, urging Gough (who, he claimed, &quot;quite agreed&quot;) that he should concentrate on the Gheluveld Plateau and that he should wait for two or three days of dry weather for artillery and infantry to operate effectively (Haig diary 2 August).

Lunching with Gough on 5 August, six days after Third Ypres began, Rawlinson recorded that &quot;he is converted from the &quot;huroosh&quot; and now accepts the limited objective as the normal tactics&quot;. Kiggell wrote to Gough (7 August) urging him &quot;to jump well within our power&quot; and to persuade the government, who had agreed to the offensive with deep reluctance on condition it would be conducted as a series of step-by-step advances, of &quot;our power to win decisively&quot; by &quot;let(ting) them see that at each bound we gain the line aimed at and maintain it against counterattack, and with moderate losses&quot;. &quot;Boche beating, not gain of territory. Beat him first, then &quot;en avant&quot;&quot;. Tanks were to be used to crush enemy strongpoints after the main attack had passed by.

Haig urged Gough (8 August), given the bad state of the ground, to limit the depth of his advance to about , so that his men would still be fresh to defeat German counterattacks. In August there were only three days (7, 19, 22) in which no rain was recorded; rainfall for the month was almost double the August average. Much of the battlefield turned into a quagmire in which men and animals sometimes drowned, making movement of men and supplies difficult and severely reducing the accuracy and effectiveness of artillery.

====Battle of Langemarck====
Gough delayed his planned attacks for a week. During the 2–10 August delay, corps reserves had to be used to relieve exhausted units in the line, instead of being kept to exploit the attack. The 10 August attack was in good weather but after rain two days earlier, not giving the ground enough time to dry. The 18th and 25th divisions attacked the Gheluveld Plateau on 10 August, aiming to capture the second objective from 31 July. They were heavily shelled by unsubdued German guns, and after initial progress were subjected to counterattacks, suffering 2,200 casualties for a gain of on the left and no progress on the right. Part of the reason for the failure of the attack on Westhoek to hold ground east of the village, was that Gough had dispersed his artillery along the rest of his front in readiness for the next big push.

The 16 August attack was originally scheduled for 14 August but Gough, Farrar-Hockley claims under pressure from Haig to make rapid progress to link up with the planned seaborne landing, allowed Jacob a postponement of only one day. A thunderstorm forced another. Although Second Army artillery were providing some assistance on the Gheluveld plateau, much of their strength was being dissipated assisting the Battle of Hill 70, a First Army attack by the Canadian Corps at Lens.
Although Haig had urged concentration on the Gheluveld Plateau, at a conference at his house at Cassel (15 August) he &quot;left this matter entirely to General Gough&#x27;s discretion&quot;. The attack of 16 August was carried out across a wide front and after two days of heavy rain. The French on Gough&#x27;s left, heavily equipped with artillery and facing weaker German defences, achieved their targets for a cost of only 350 casualties, while Cavan&#x27;s XIV Corps on Gough&#x27;s left also achieved its objectives against tired German forces which were in the process of being relieved. On the left an advance of was achieved. In the centre Gough&#x27;s attacks were largely unsuccessful; the attacks on the Gheluveld plateau made initial progress but were driven back by counterattacks, without obtaining the second objective which had been the target on 10 August. Gough&#x27;s forces suffered 15,000 casualties. Farrar-Hockley describes the 16 August attacks as &quot;on balance a failure&quot;. Gough later claimed in his memoirs that he had visited Haig in his railway carriage twenty miles from Ypres and had advised him that &quot;tactical success was not possible, or would be too costly under such conditions, and advised that the attack should now be abandoned&quot; and that Haig had told him that with Russia dropping out of the war it was necessary for the BEF, the strongest Allied army at the moment, to wear down German strength, to prevent the Germans defeating France or Italy, as well as capturing the submarine bases and Gotha bomber bases and of the difficulties of persuading Lloyd George to see &quot;the realities of the situation&quot;.

In the centre, the 16th (Irish) Division and 36th (Ulster) Division, both part of Watts&#x27; XIX Corps, had to attack fortified German farmhouses on Zonnebecke Ridge, not one of which had been subdued by artillery fire. When Gough accused the troops in question of not being able to hold onto their gains because they &quot;were Irish and did not like the enemy&#x27;s shelling&quot;, Haig was not impressed by Gough &quot;playing the Irish Card&quot; and noted that the men had been exhausted and that the bombardment had been ineffective. Gough later came to regret the &quot;Irish card&quot; comments when he learned the facts. He told one of his chaplains in late August that the heart had gone out of a part of Fifth Army.

Haig noted (diary 18 August) that &quot;Failure to advance on the right centre&quot; was caused by &quot;Commanders being in too great a hurry&quot; and that three more days should have been allowed to allow artillery to gain the upper hand – the same advice he had given before the battle but had not enforced. He demanded Gough get the facts and then &quot;talk the matter over with him&quot;. There is no evidence of Gough thinking the same way: at a conference of his corps commanders (17 August), he noted the tendency of his men to be driven back by counterattacks, wanting to court martial some officers and NCOs for &quot;glaring instances&quot; of this, and also complained that divisions were being rotated too quickly through the line, which might risk Fifth Army &quot;running out of men&quot;. Gough proposed a series of piecemeal operations: XVIII Corps were to attack on 19 August, XIX Corps on 21 August, then II Corps on 22 August, in each case to seize the objectives which they had failed to achieve on 16 August. XIV, XVIII and XIX Corps were then to attack on 25 August, followed by II Corps later on the same day. There would then be a general advance at some unspecified future date. This plan was then abandoned as XIX and II Corps did not have enough fresh troops to attack.

It was decided instead that Maxse&#x27;s XVIII Corps would attack on 19 August, then XIV and II Corps on 22 August. The former attack was successful, capturing fortified farmhouses near St Julien which had caused difficulty on 16 August (as the farmhouses were on dry ground, Maxse was able to use twelve tanks, protected by a smoke barrage). The attack on 22 August was unsuccessful owing to the ineffectiveness of the bombardment and German counterattacks, with no ground at all being gained on the Gheluveld Plateau.

Rain began again on 23 August. On 24 August Gough&#x27;s intelligence branch informed him that the German defences were not linear but consisted of strongpoints in a chequerboard formation, with many German units held back for counterattack. Gough issued a new paper &quot;Modifications Required in Our Attack Formations to Meet the Enemy&#x27;s Present System of Defence&quot; (24 August) –with a greater percentage of &quot;moppers-up&quot; to deal with bypassed enemy strongpoints, while larger numbers of troops were employed to withstand counterattacks. These tactics (&quot;waves&quot; followed by &quot;worms&quot;) were later demonstrated to Third Army on 14 September, although in Simpson&#x27;s view Gough did not appear to have realised that artillery superiority was needed to use them effectively.

====Plumer takes over====
Haig then saw Plumer (25 August), the day after the German counterattacks which recaptured Inverness Copse, and informed him that II Corps would soon be returned to his command, and that his Second Army was to take the lead in the offensive, to take the Gheluveld Plateau with a more cautious and methodical approach. He saw Gough later the same day and informed him that he was to undertake subsidiary attacks to assist Plumer.

By 26 August the rain had become torrential. XVIII Corps attacks on the St Julien spur failed (27 August), while that day Inverness Copse (on the Gheluveld Plateau) resisted its fourth assault. Simpson writes that the large attacks on 27 August were, like those on 22 August, &quot;no more successful than those before&quot;. Farrar-Hockley blames the attack on Haig&#x27;s orders to &quot;press the enemy&quot; and on Neill Malcolm&#x27;s &quot;speaking savagely&quot; to the corps commanders. The &quot;Official History&quot; writes that the attack resulted in &quot;considerable further casualties and very little gain in ground&quot;. Plumer&#x27;s biographer describes it as &quot;a bloody fiasco&quot; in which some of Gough&#x27;s men were left standing up to their knees in water for up to ten hours before zero hour. Prior &amp; Wilson write that Gough&#x27;s troops were exhausted by now after repeated attacks. Gough ordered another attack for 31 August.

Haig ordered Gough (28 August) to hand over command of II Corps effective early September, although he initially permitted him to make further limited attacks in the region of Inverness Copse until then which would facilitate the upcoming big push, but otherwise to train and rest his divisions ready to assist Plumer. However, when Gough proposed (30 August) to take this region on 3 September, Haig withheld permission as the weather conditions were not suitable.

Rawlinson, who was highly sceptical about the likelihood of the campaign succeeding, told Wilson that the command change was being made because &quot;even he (Haig) began to see that Goughie was quite unable to do the job&quot; (Wilson diary 29 August and 5 September). Haig wrote (diary 7 September) &quot;I decided to stop Gough from going on with ... little attacks&quot; which Haig thought &quot;wasteful&quot;.

In early September Gough ordered XIX Corps to make small-scale attacks in the St Julien area. Not one of the fortified farmhouses was captured, and after the fourth attack Haig remonstrated with Gough. However, Gough protested (Haig diary, 9 September) that two of the divisions were soon to leave the salient, and that for the sake of their &quot;training and morale&quot; they should be made to retake ground which they had recently lost to counterattacks. Haig permitted a fourth, equally unsuccessful attack on 10 September. Kiggell (Haig diary 10 September) reported that &quot;some of Gough&#x27;s subordinates&quot; did not give an honest answer as to the likely success of attacks and remarked to Neil Malcolm of the order to make only limited attacks: &quot;We did not expect you to pursue the matter so vigorously&quot;. Fanshawe – GOC V Corps, which had recently replaced Watts&#x27; XIX Corps in the line – was opposed to further attacks, while the other corps commander McKenzie, possibly put up to it by Gough, was in favour. Haig then interviewed the divisional commanders, then urged Gough to desist, which Gough agreed to do. Aylmer Haldane recorded in his diary (10 September) Lambton&#x27;s lack of keenness at going to Fifth Army. Haig wrote (diary 18 September), after touring Fifth Army and corps HQ, that the Chief of Staff Malcolm seemed &quot;fatigued&quot; and that &quot;Fifth Army staff work is not as satisfactory as last year.&quot;

====Sidelined====
Beginning on 20 September and into early October Plumer captured the Gheluveld Plateau, in drier weather and under cover of intense artillery fire (he had guns brought in from First, Third and Fourth Armies, and had twice as many guns for counter-battery alone as Gough had had for all purposes prior to 31 July), in a series of costly but effective set piece attacks (Menin Road – 20 September, Polygon Wood – 26 September, Broodseinde – 4 October). Fifth Army played a supporting role in Plumer&#x27;s victory at Menin Road, making more use of new tactics: the &quot;draw-net barrage&quot; (which began &quot;behind&quot; the German front line then drew back towards it, demoralising the defenders), using the Stokes Mortar as part of the creeping barrage, small columns of infantry following a wave of skirmishers and greater use of the rifle (as opposed to hand grenades) to repel counterattacks. Maxse also felt, ironically in view of the tactical debates of late June, that limiting the depth of the attack to had been worthwhile. The Fifth Army portion of the attack was conducted by 9th (Scottish) Division and 55th Division (under V Corps); 20th (Light) Division (under XIV Corps), and 51st (Highland) Division &amp; 58th Division (under XVIII Corps). John Lee observes that 9th Scottish and 58th London, which were new to Fifth Army, reached their objectives, whereas the others did not, suggesting that the men had probably been worn out by excessive time spent on trench duty and labouring tasks, adding that &quot;the anecdotal evidence of soldiers preferring service in Second, or any other, Army than Fifth is hard to ignore.&quot;

With a breakthrough apparently imminent, Haig ordered (26 September) that forces for exploitation, including cavalry, be ready to exploit to Roulers by 10 October, ready to link up with the long-postponed coastal advance and seaborne landing. Gough protested that 16 October was a more realistic date (Plumer&#x27;s suggestion was 13–14 October) but was over-ruled by Haig. Gough appears to have anticipated a dramatic exploitation by mounted cavalry, but marginal notes by Haig on a memo from Neill Malcolm (1 October) indicate that he had misunderstood the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s intent – Haig envisaged cavalry being used more cautiously at first, in a dismounted role, in the event of German resistance breaking, a far cry from the dramatic exploitation which had been anticipated at the Somme.

The rain then resumed. Edmonds later claimed in the &quot;Official History&quot;, that at a conference on 7 October Gough and Plumer urged &quot;a closing down&quot; of the campaign, but were over-ruled by Haig, who cancelled the plans for cavalry exploitation but ordered that Passchendaele Ridge be taken. Prior &amp; Wilson point out that there is no documentary evidence for the existence of this conference, either in contemporary records or in Haig&#x27;s diary, nor did Gough make any such claim in his memoirs, although it would have been in his interests to do so. Gough had written to H. A. Gwynne, editor of &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, on 6 October that he hoped the weather, although &quot;wintry and rather wet&quot;, would hold long enough to permit further attacks.

During the night before First Passchendaele (12 October) Gough telephoned Plumer to suggest a postponement because of the foul weather, but Plumer, after consulting his corps commanders, decided to push on. Gough recommended to Kiggell that the final operation (Second Passchendaele, in which the Canadians played a key role) be delayed until frost had dried out the ground, but Haig vetoed Kiggell&#x27;s suggestion of a conference with Gough and Plumer and demanded (diary 26 October) that Gough and Plumer inspect the front lines and then report back to him. The offensive went ahead as planned.

Rawlinson recorded &quot;things had not been running at all smoothly&quot; in Fifth Army Staff (Diary 11 and 13 October 1917). By late 1917 he recorded that &quot;intense feeling against Goughy&quot; had &quot;made many enemies&quot; and led to the &quot;formation of a sect of officers called the GMG&quot; which stood for &quot;Gough must go&quot; (Rawlinson Diary 14 October 1917 and 1 November 1917). Kiggell advised Haig to send the Canadians to Plumer not Gough as they did not &quot;work kindly&quot; with Gough as he &quot;drove them too much in the Somme fighting last year&quot; (Haig Diary 5 October 1917 &amp; 8 November 1917). Haig (diary 5 October) blamed Malcolm for the Canadians&#x27; reluctance to serve under Gough.

In November Kiggell warned Haig &quot;of the strong wish of divisions not to be sent to Gough&#x27;s Army&quot;. Haig at first (8 November) thought it best &quot;not to mention to Gough the state of feeling among the troops&quot; lest it &quot;might make Gough lose confidence in himself&quot;. After Passchendaele, Malcolm was moved to command of 66th Division. Lord Derby (Secretary of State for War) warned Haig (11 November and 12 December) of Gough&#x27;s growing unpopularity, among Canadian troops and at home in the UK. Derby again warned Haig (23 December 1917) that he was hearing many criticisms in London of Gough&#x27;s responsibility for the &quot;failure&quot; of Third Ypres. That month Robertson had intervened on Gough&#x27;s behalf when Lloyd George had wanted to sack him for &quot;being one of those responsible for perpetrating the massacres&quot; of Third Ypres.

===Spring 1918===
====Preparing the defence====
Gough moved his HQ to Nesle (12 miles south of Peronne) in mid December 1917. In January 1918 Lt-Col Armitage recorded that in his meeting with Smuts and Hankey (who were interviewing senior British generals to assess their suitability to replace Haig as Commander-in-Chief) &quot;Gough, compared with other army commanders, did not come convincingly out of that interview as his views were somewhat narrow and he failed to put before Smuts the perilous position on his front&quot;. Yet Smuts&#x27; own account of the meeting recorded that he learned more about conditions at the front from Gough than from other generals, while Hankey recorded that Gough was &quot;a terrific fellow, oozing with character and Irish humour&quot;.

Haig, anxious to protect the Channel Ports, had concentrated his reserves further north, leaving Fifth Army – now redeployed back down to the Somme, the southern part of the BEF&#x27;s line – to bear the brunt of the German Operation Michael offensive. Gough was ordered to prepare a &quot;battle zone&quot; deep, behind the front line, and a &quot;rearward zone&quot; behind the battle zone. The only defensive feature of note was the River Somme (which runs roughly north–south south of Peronne) in his rear, and the Crozat Canal connecting the Somme to the Oise. He had only eleven divisions (and 3 cavalry, equivalent in firepower to one infantry division) rather than the seventeen he demanded. 39th and 20th (Light) Division divisions, both in GHQ Reserve, were placed in his rear. Gough had to take over two more sections of line ( and respectively) in mid January, leaving him holding of front, (as opposed to Third Army to his north, which had 14 divisions to hold ).

At a corps commanders&#x27; conference on 3 February, Gough warned them that intelligence had deduced that von Hutier, who had recently taken Riga in September 1917, was opposite them. Edward Beddington acted as Fifth Army Chief of Staff until 10 February 1917, when Neill Malcolm&#x27;s replacement Brigadier-General Jocelyn Percy became available. Beddington later wrote highly of Gough&#x27;s active mind, &quot;full of ideas, some excellent and some the reverse&quot;. Gough also badgered Haig and Pétain (Anthoine, his old colleague from Third Ypres, was now Chief of Staff at French GQG) and was assured that Humbert&#x27;s French Third Army at Clermont was earmarked to reinforce him.

====Asking for reinforcements====
A memorandum (4 February 1918) from Maj-Gen Davidson (Chief of Operations at GHQ) discussed the possibility of Gough having to fall back to positions defending the Somme Crossings, although he stressed that such a retreat would be bad for morale, but made no mention of Gough&#x27;s lack of manpower. Davidson proposed building a fortified bridgehead around the Somme crossings at Brie and Peronne, and wanted Gough to fortify the River Tortille, which runs roughly northeast from Peronne to the Canal du Nord. A further request for reinforcements resulted in formal orders (9 February 1918) from Lt-Gen Herbert Lawrence (Chief of Staff BEF), ordering Gough to be prepared to conduct a fighting retreat and then conduct counterattacks – it may well be that although the German attack was expected it was thought it would be a subsidiary attack prior to an attack on the French in Champagne. Some extra labourers were made available. The total number of labourers in Fifth Army sector rose from 17,400 (30 December) to 24,217 (early February) to 48,154 by mid March (out of 354,577 in the BEF as a whole) but no more than 8,830 were ever available per week. Most of them were used to build roads, railways, depots, hospitals, water reservoirs – not fortifications.

Derby wrote to Haig (5 March) that Gough did &quot;not have the confidence of the troops he commands&quot;, that Lloyd George had &quot;spoken to (Haig) on the subject&quot; and that his letter was an &quot;indefinite order&quot; which Haig could use as &quot;a loophole&quot; to remove Gough. It is unlikely that Derby, a Conservative, was much influenced by Liberal MPs who remembered the Curragh incident, but he may well have been influenced by Henry Wilson. Lord Bertie (British Ambassador to Paris) suggested to Haig (5 March) that Gough be appointed Governor of Gibraltar. Haig ignored both suggestions.

Gough was active in inspecting units to encourage the construction of defences. When he visited Divisional HQ of 16th Irish Division on 14 March Maj-Gen Hull suggested strengthening the battle (second) zone, but Gough replied &quot;The Germans are not going to break my line&quot;.

Haig inspected the front with Gough (7 March). From north to south Fifth Army then consisted of Congreve&#x27;s VII Corps, Watts&#x27; XIX Corps (containing 66th Division now commanded by Neill Malcolm), Maxse&#x27;s XVIII Corps and III Corps. The latter was commanded by Butler, recently removed as Deputy Chief of Staff BEF, and who had never before commanded a large formation in battle but was now holding the weakest part of the front. None of these corps had any division in reserve. After this inspection Haig released 39th Division (north of Peronne) to control of Fifth Army, and brought 50th Division, still in GHQ Reserve, down from Flanders to a point west of St Quentin – given the 24 hours&#x27; notice required, it would take two and a half days to reach the front when needed. Gough also requested that men from 20th (still in GHQ Reserve behind his front) and 50th Divisions be used to help dig defences, but this was vetoed by GHQ.

Gough had a reasonable idea of the size and timing of the German attack from air reconnaissance and interrogation of prisoners, although many at GHQ believed the attack would not be until a few days or weeks. Lawrence was in the habit of referring to Gough as &quot;young Goughie&quot;, although the latter was his senior in rank Farrar-Hockley argues that Lawrence and Davidson were personally unsympathetic to Gough and in early 1918 effectively starved him of reinforcements which Haig might, if asked, have agreed to send. He argues that Gough ought to have demanded to speak to Haig personally, which was his right but not the etiquette of the time. On the evening of Tuesday 19 March Lawrence (&quot;purring on the telephone like a damned pussycat&quot;) once again refused permission to move up the 20th and 50th Divisions.

====21 March====
The German attack began at 4:40 am on 21 March; Gough, Beddington and other rear echelon officers recorded being awakened at around 5:10 am, when British artillery, hampered by the fog, began to return fire. The Germans had over 8,000 guns and trench mortars. Much of the German bombardment (described by eyewitnesses as &quot;a wall of orange flame&quot; and &quot;a sea of fire&quot;) concentrated on British headquarters and communications, while pauses were left in the bombardment of the British front lines to tempt the defenders out of their shelters. Gas was also used, although mustard gas was not used in areas through which German troops were to pass. 19 German divisions assaulted six of Byng&#x27;s Third Army, while 43 German divisions attacked Fifth Army (13 divisions plus 2 in GHQ Reserve). Many British divisions were at little more than half strength, and none more than two-thirds, giving the Germans a 4:1 numerical superiority on Byng&#x27;s front and over 8:1 on Gough&#x27;s.

At 8:30 am Gough ordered the 20th and 50th Divisions to be ready to move up to the front, and obtained retrospective permission from GHQ. Gough spent the morning at his own headquarters listening to reports as they came in – III Corps forward zone was already reported overrun by 10 am – and reading reports of the rounding up of labourers and pioneers into &quot;ad hoc&quot; fighting units, as he would have been putting himself out of communication had he attempted to tour the front. At around 1 pm General Humbert arrived, telling Gough that he had only a skeleton staff but no troops to send (&quot;je n&#x27;ai que mon fanion&quot; – &quot;I&#x27;ve only the pennant on my car&quot;), and promising to lobby GQG to send French divisions. At 2 pm, after studying aerial reconnaissance reports (the fog had cleared enough by 12:30 pm for British planes to be launched), Gough ordered the corps commanders to begin a fighting retreat, described by Beddington as &quot;a right and brave decision arrived at very quickly&quot;. He was disinclined to speak to Lawrence or Davidson again, and disappointed not to hear directly from Haig himself that day. In the afternoon he visited his corps commanders one by one. Formal orders to fall back were issued at 9:45 pm. Haig (diary 21 March) approved Gough&#x27;s withdrawal. Haig (diary 21 March) appears to have regarded the initial day&#x27;s fighting as a creditable result, knowing as he did that the first day was often the most successful of any offensive, and GHQ (from their 2 March appraisal) appear to have believed that the main German effort would fall somewhere else, perhaps against the French in Champagne.

To avoid a repetition of the chaos of the August 1914 retreat, Gough took particular care to order that corps headquarters retreat to spots which he had selected (sited on existing signal cables) and keep a tight grip on the location of their division headquarters. That evening he spoke to Lawrence on the telephone, who told him that the Germans were unlikely to attack again the next day as they would be too busy reorganising their tired troops and collecting their wounded – Gough claimed to have &quot;emphatically&quot; disagreed, and that evening Haig agreed to send a second division being moved down from Flanders – one was already on its way – to Gough&#x27;s sector.

Martin Kitchen takes a rather different point of view, arguing that Haig was misled by Gough&#x27;s overly favourable report. Haig therefore did not ask the French for reinforcements until after midnight of 21/22 March, and then asked for only three divisions – half what had been agreed under &quot;Hypothesis A&quot; – which reached the British line on 23 March. Following Haig&#x27;s request, Pétain agreed to send two divisions and some dismounted cavalry under General Pelle to cover the French left flank. This news reached Gough the following morning. On the evening of 21 March Pétain, having heard that Butler&#x27;s III Corps had been unable to hold the line of the Crozat Canal the previous evening, had also at last agreed that French 125th Division be deployed to III Corps sector.

====22–25 March====
At 10:45 am on 22 March, following a telephone request from Congreve for clarification of his previous verbal instructions, Gough issued written orders to corps commanders to retreat &quot;in the event of serious hostile attacks&quot; the forward line of the Rear Zone (&quot;the Green Line&quot; in front of the Somme – in practice little more than a line of signposts and wire). Fifth Army staff also informed corps commanders of the impending French reinforcement and Gough&#x27;s hopes to withdraw III Corps to form a reserve. On receiving these messages at around noon, Maxse ordered XVIII Corps to withdraw immediately, without cover of artillery fire, and they fell back behind the Somme altogether that evening. Gough attempted to halt Maxse&#x27;s withdrawal when he heard of it, but it was too late. Maxse&#x27;s precipitate retreat allowed a German penetration at Bethencourt on his left flank, forcing Watts XIX Corps on his left to fall back also. Watts&#x27; falling back in turn jeopardised V Corps (part of Byng&#x27;s Third Army) still holding the Flesquières Salient.

London was soon awash with exaggerated rumours, based largely on accounts of stragglers and chaos in rear areas, that Fifth Army had broken. Haig at last visited Gough on 23 March, meeting his requests for reinforcements with a laconic &quot;well, Hubert, you can&#x27;t fight without men,&quot; but wrote in his diary of his dismay that Fifth Army had &quot;gone so far back without making some kind of stand&quot;. At 4 pm on 23 March Haig and Pétain met at Dury. Pétain agreed to deploy his Reserve Army Group (GAR – two armies under Fayolle) to operate in the Somme Valley. Gough was ordered to hold the line of the Somme (roughly north–south south of Peronne) &quot;... at all costs. There will be no withdrawal...&quot; and informed that as of 11 pm on Sunday 24 March Fifth Army would be placed under Fayolle&#x27;s orders, making the Somme (roughly east–west between Amiens and Peronne) the Anglo-French boundary. VII Corps, north of the bend in the Somme, was placed under Third Army&#x27;s orders at the end of 24 March.

Bertie recorded (24 March), somewhat prematurely, that Haig had saved Gough&#x27;s job. By 24 March the Germans had broken through into open country, although officers on the ground were organising stragglers and rear echelon troops into scratch formations. Reinforcements (1st Cavalry Division on Gough&#x27;s left to maintain contact with Third Army, 35th Division down from Flanders into VII Corps sector, and Robillot&#x27;s II French Cavalry Corps (whose formations were in fact mainly infantry) in XVIII Corps sector) were beginning to take their place in Gough&#x27;s line. On Gough&#x27;s right III Corps were now under the command of General Pelle, but its units were becoming interspersed with French units as Butler had been attempting to withdraw them, and had lost control of the situation.

Herbert Lawrence visited Fifth Army on 24 March (Haig was visiting Byng&#x27;s Third Army that day) and reported that it had &quot;still plenty of life&quot; despite shortage of numbers, and that Gough was planning a counterattack by four British brigades and 22nd French Division against a bridgehead which the Germans had made over the Somme at Pargny (threatening a breach between Watts&#x27; and Maxse&#x27;s Corps).

The planned counterattack did not take place as General Robillot refused to co-operate, despite a personal visit from Maxse on the morning of 25 March, and Watts&#x27; Corps had to fall back from the line of the Somme. Gough spent much of that day visiting Maxse and Watts, and reconnoitring the ground east of Amiens which his troops would have to hold next. Gough ordered 2,000 rear echelon troops – mainly engineers (including 500 Americans), tunnellers, and signallers – to be formed into a unit under temporary command of Maj-Gen PG Grant, Fifth Army Chief Engineer, to work on the defences and fight if necessary. Brigadier-General Carey, due to return from leave on the afternoon of the 26th to take command of a division, was notified that he was instead to take command of this force, to be known as &quot;Carey&#x27;s Force&quot;.

====26 March====
Gough was not invited to the Army Commanders&#x27; meeting 11 am on 26 March, at which Haig told Plumer, Horne and Byng that Amiens was to be held &quot;at all costs&quot; until the French were in a position to give more support.

Brigadier-General James Walter Sandilands later recorded that, returning from leave, in the chaos he was unable to locate his brigade (104th Brigade, part of 35th Division), or even find out which corps it was currently part of. Making his way to Fifth Army Headquarters on 26 March by asking a lift from a man who knew him by sight, he found Gough having his teeth examined, but decided &quot;discretion was the better part of valour&quot; and beat a hasty retreat from the room. At about 11am a car drew up containing Milner and Wilson, now CIGS, who asked whether it was safe to drive into Amiens. Sandilands pointed out that Gough was in the building, assuming that they would wish to speak to him, but Wilson replied &quot;Oh he is here is he? Well good morning&quot; and drove off. Sandilands thought &quot;that&#x27;s the end of Gough&quot;. He later realised that they had been on their way to the Doullens Conference at which Foch was appointed generalissimo.

At the Doullens Conference that afternoon Wilson suggested to Haig that Rawlinson and his staff, currently at Versailles, could replace Gough (in the &quot;Official History&quot; Edmonds openly blamed Wilson for Gough&#x27;s dismissal, so that he could remove Rawlinson, &quot;a strong man&quot; from Versailles). Pétain (who, according to Haig had &quot;a terrible look. He had the appearance of a commander who had lost his nerve&quot;) said of Gough&#x27;s Fifth Army &quot;Alas it no longer really exists ... From the first they have refused to engage the enemy ... they have run like the Italians at Caporetto&quot;. This was an exaggeration, and angered even the Francophile Henry Wilson. Pétain told the meeting that 24 French divisions (at another meeting at Compiegne the previous day he had given the figure as 15 divisions) were en route to prevent a German breakthrough to Amiens.

By 26 March Gough had received a British infantry division from Italy, as well as three Australian and one New Zealand Divisions. Maxse was maintaining his place in the line, despite pressure from the French to join them in retreating south-westwards. Gough had to send a messenger, Paul Maze, to Humbert&#x27;s headquarters, with orders to get back XVIII Corps artillery which had been lent temporarily to the French, with orders not to leave until he had obtained written orders for its return. Gough spent much of the afternoon with Watts, whose sector was also being strongly attacked. Gough returned to his headquarters, now moved back from Villers-Bretonneux to Dury, for a meeting with Foch (who was also establishing his own headquarters at Dury) and Weygand at 4 pm. Speaking in French, Foch demanded to know why Gough was not in the front line himself, why Fifth Army was falling back, and why there was no defence as at First Ypres in 1914. Gough thought him &quot;peremptory, rude and excited&quot;, but such a manner was common in French generals, whose subordinates also sometimes answered back in similar vein. Gough telephoned Haig to complain, adding that French troops were falling back at a much faster rate than his own. Haig recorded that Gough complained that Foch had been &quot;most impertinent&quot; to him. After meeting with Gough, Foch saw Fayolle (Reserve Army Group commander) and was rather more civil to him.

At 5 pm, after the Doullens conference, Haig met Milner and Wilson – he recorded that he told them that no matter what opinion at home might think, or what Foch had just said, he thought Gough &quot;had dealt with a most difficult situation very well. He had never lost his head, was always cheery and fought hard.&quot;

On the evening of 26 March Gough telephoned Lawrence to say that the Germans were weakening and often falling back in the face of local counterattacks, and that with three fresh divisions (he had in reserve only two composite battalions and a Canadian motor machine-gun battery, which he had had to send to Watts&#x27; sector) he could push them back to the Somme. He recorded that &quot;Lawrence laughed and said it was good to hear that we had plenty of fight still left, though no reinforcements at the moment could be sent.&quot; In fact Byng&#x27;s Third Army had been prioritised for reinforcements, and had been sent seven divisions since 22 March.

====Dismissed====
Bertie recorded (27 March) that Haig himself might be sacked instead of Gough. Gough spent much of 27 March with Watts, who was still facing strong German attacks although beginning to drive them back with counterattacks, and then with Maxse whose XVIII Corps was about to be relieved by French troops coming into the line. He returned to his HQ at about 5 pm, to find Haig&#x27;s Military Secretary Maj-Gen Ruggles-Brise, who informed him to his surprise that he was to be relieved of command of Fifth Army and was to hand over command to Rawlinson the following day.

Gough had to deal with a final crisis as the Germans were crossing the east–west portion of the Somme at Cerisy, threatening XIX Corps rear. Byng, on hearing this news had moved 1st Cavalry Division south of the Somme and returned it to Gough&#x27;s command pending the arrival of 61st Division by hastily organised motor transport. Gough eventually telephoned Foch at 3am on 28 March to ask permission for Watts to withdraw further, although he later regretted not having simply made the decision on his own authority. XIX Corps and Carey&#x27;s Force were able to hold the Stop Line on 28 March.

Gough handed over command to Rawlinson at 4:30 pm on 28 March. Beddington and other staff officers remained to ease the transition. Over dinner (29 March) Haig told Gough that he wanted him out of the line, along with a Reserve Army staff, to prepare an east–west line of defence along the Somme from Amiens to the sea (in case the Germans broke through and the BEF had to form a defensive perimeter around the Channel Ports). Gough set up Reserve Army HQ at Crecy on 3 April – this would later form the nucleus of the reconstituted Fifth Army under Birdwood (remnants of Gough&#x27;s previous army were now renamed the Fourth and under Rawlinson).

Haig defended Gough to Lloyd George during a car journey (3 April) – he recorded that Lloyd George was looking for a scapegoat for the manpower problem and for his attempts to redeploy divisions to the Middle East contrary to Robertson&#x27;s advice, and that Lloyd George demanded Gough&#x27;s dismissal on the grounds that he had neither held nor destroyed the Somme bridges. Haig, by his own account, replied that &quot;could not condemn an officer unheard&quot; and refused to sack him unless given a direct order to do so. The next day (4 April) Haig received a telegram from Lord Derby ordering that Gough be dismissed altogether on the grounds of &quot;having lost the confidence of his troops&quot;. Haig held a farewell lunch with Gough on 5 April.

Gough&#x27;s formations had retreated over and communications often broke down. However, he had averted a complete disaster. Andrew Roberts offers a favourable assessment of Gough&#x27;s contribution:

Martin Kitchen takes a more critical view, pointing out that troops were initially under orders not to retire from the forward zone, that there were no adequate lines of communications between corps, and that Gough caused further trouble by issuing orders direct to lower formations, even down to brigade level. Gough &quot;muddle(d) through ... to the limit of his very modest abilities&quot;.

==Disgrace and after==

===Scapegoat===
Lord Derby (Secretary of State for War) informed the War Cabinet (4 April) that he was demanding a full report on the recent reverse suffered by Fifth Army.

Gough visited Derby (8 April) to ask about an inquiry – he recorded that Derby was &quot;pleasant enough, almost genial&quot;, but appeared glad when the interview was over. In the House of Commons Lloyd George (9 April) refused to rule out a court martial for Gough, praised General Carey for forming an &quot;ad hoc&quot; force to hold back the enemy in the Fifth Army sector, apparently unaware that the initiative had come from Gough when Carey was still on leave, and praised Byng (GOC Third Army) for only retreating when forced to do so by Fifth Army&#x27;s retreat, apparently unaware of Byng&#x27;s folly in clinging to the Flesquières Salient. Byng wrote to the editor of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; (19 April) that Gough was &quot;talking too much and had better keep quiet&quot;.

Lloyd George told the War Cabinet (11 April) that the Liberal War Committee (a committee of backbench MPs) had made &quot;very serious protests&quot; to him that afternoon against the retention of &quot;incompetent&quot; officers like Gough and Haking.

When the War Cabinet demanded a progress report into the inquiry into the Fifth Army debacle (1 May), General Macdonogh (Director of Military Intelligence) reminded them the following day that the Under-Secretary of State had recently informed the House of Commons that, with the German Spring Offensives still in progress, the Government thought it unwise to put pressure on Haig.

After Lloyd George survived the Maurice Debate (9 May) with a misleading speech, Gough wrote to Lord Milner (now Secretary of State for War), in the hope that an inquiry into the Fifth Army would reveal the lack of reserves, only to receive a reply from the Under-Secretary that he was &quot;mistaken&quot; in thinking that there had been a promise of an inquiry (it is unclear whether this was an error or a deliberate lie). A furious Gough wrote to a friend in June that none of the other Army Commanders would have had the resilience to handle such a massive German attack, and that he &quot;never wanted to wear the uniform of England again&quot;. He resisted the temptation to breach King&#x27;s Regulations by airing his views in public as Maurice had done or to brief Opposition MPs.

Haig in fact wrote to his wife (16 June) claiming that &quot;some orders (Gough) issued and things he did were stupid&quot; (it is unclear to what Haig was referring) and claiming that he would &quot;stick up for him as I have hitherto done&quot; although he had not in fact specifically done so in his report of 12 May, in which he had blamed the German crossing of the Oise on the fog and the low level of the water owing to the recent dry weather. Haig also (letter of 6 July, replying belatedly to a letter of Gough&#x27;s of 21 June) claimed that he had defended Gough from political criticism throughout the winter of 1917–18 and advised him to keep quiet so that he could be restored to an active command when memories had faded. In August, stung by a letter from Lord Roberts&#x27; widow that he owed a duty to protect the reputation of the men of Fifth Army, Gough had an interview with Lord Milner, who blamed the events of March on poor defence, incompetent leadership and the reluctance of the troops to fight, and bluntly refused to help.

===Rehabilitation===
Press reports of the events of March 1918 appeared in the &quot;National Review&quot; and the &quot;Illustrated Sunday Herald&quot; in October 1918, while officers and men returning after the Armistice were able to challenge claims that the Fifth Army had been defeated because morale had been poor and the soldiers had lacked confidence in Gough&#x27;s leadership (although in practice few front line soldiers would have known the name of their Army Commander). At a dinner on board his train in February 1919 Haig confessed to Edward Beddington that he agreed that Gough&#x27;s treatment had been &quot;harsh and undeserved&quot; but that &quot;public opinion at home, whether right or wrong, (had) demanded a scapegoat&quot; and he had been &quot;conceited enough to think that the Army could not spare&quot; himself rather than Gough – Beddington agreed that this had been the correct decision at the time.

Beddington later complained to Haig that he had only given Gough &quot;faint praise&quot; in his Final Despatch, and that he had been &quot;fobbed off&quot; with a GCMG instead of being promoted to field marshal and being given a cash grant. Haig was angry, although he later invited Gough to his home at Bemersyde to repair their relations.

Gough was not in London for the peace ceremonies (he was on a business trip to Baku), and it is unclear whether he knew that he was one of the senior officers (including Robertson and Hamilton) whom Lloyd George deliberately did not invite.

A further official statement in March 1919 declared that &quot;the matter was now closed&quot;. However, in May 1919 Gough received a handwritten note from the new Secretary of State for War, Winston Churchill (Edmonds – &quot;Official History&quot; 1918 Vol II p. 119 – attributes the letter wrongly to Churchill&#x27;s predecessor Lord Milner), praising the &quot;gallant fight of the Fifth Army&quot; and promising to consider Gough for &quot;command appropriate to (his) rank and service&quot;. Gough was initially angry that this was not a full exoneration and implied that he might be employed in his permanent rank of lieutenant-general (not as an acting full general, the rank he had held at the time of his dismissal), but eventually accepted because of the praise given to Fifth Army.

===Baltic Mission===
He was appointed Chief of the Allied Military Mission to the Baltic on 19 May 1919. The British forces consisted solely of a squadron of cruisers. Britain hoped that the White forces would overthrow the Bolsheviks, but was not sure which side would triumph, and British policy was to encourage independence for Russia&#x27;s Baltic subject peoples and Finland (which the Whites privately did not want). Gough was privately briefed by the Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon not to let Churchill push him into intervention, and not to let troops supported by England (sic) occupy Petrograd, which might cause friction with future Russian governments. Gough struck up good relations with the White leader General Yudenich and with the Latvian and Estonian leaders, but urged the other nationalities not to attack Russia, causing the Finns to back off from their plans to march on Petrograd. The Iron Division (German troops under von der Goltz, occupying Lithuania and Latvia) also backed off from their plans to attack Russia, and after initial attempts to defy British demands were persuaded by Gough&#x27;s firm stand (firmer, in fact, than that of the authorities in London) to depart for Germany by rail. However, White Russian opinion was angered by the independence of Finland, Estonia and Latvia, and émigré groups in London, both imperialist and social democrat, put it about that Gough was in the pay of the Bolsheviks, while gossips also talked again of his &quot;responsibility&quot; for Third Ypres. Gough was once again sacked at the Prime Minister&#x27;s insistence on 25 October 1919 and returned home, and neither sought nor was offered further military employment. He was awarded the GCMG in 1919.

Gough was a signatory to joint statement issued with other officers and advisors who had served in Russia, who on 23 February 1920 indicated their support of peace between the British and the Bolshevik Russia.

Gough retired from the Army as a full general on 26 October 1922, although owing to an administrative error he was initially told that he would receive the pension of a full colonel, his substantive rank as of August 1914.

===Possible political career===
As he had now become convinced of the merits of Home Rule he declined an offer to stand as an Ulster Unionist for a Belfast seat in the November 1918 General Election, despite an interview with Carson whom he found more &quot;broadminded&quot; in private than the uncompromising speeches which he was delivering in public.

Gough&#x27;s name was proposed to the Cabinet early in 1921 by William O&#x27;Brien as a potential Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (in succession to French). Nothing came of this, but he stood unsuccessfully as an Asquith Liberal (i.e. opposed to Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition government) in the 1922 Chertsey by-election. During the campaign he stressed his opposition to the policy of reprisals which had been employed in Ireland. Gough would later decline further attempts to persuade him to stand for Parliament in the 1922 General Election.

After the May 1929 General Election he recorded his dislike of the &quot;fierce old women who support, and in large part constitute, the Tory Party&quot; and of the &quot;arrogant audacity&quot; with which they appropriated the Union Jack as a party symbol. However, in March 1931 he declined another offer to stand for Parliament as a Liberal, not least because of his dislike of Lloyd George, who was now Liberal leader.

==Later life==
===Farming and business career===
Gough initially (August 1918) found that his recent &quot;difficulties&quot; in France would make it difficult for him to pick up company directorships. In October 1918 he attended an agriculture course at Cambridge University, most of the other students being wounded or invalided officers, and was there when the armistice was announced. In November 1918 he went on an expedition to Armenia, on behalf of a merchant banker, to investigate the affairs of a British company there.

With four daughters to support, from the summer of 1920 (i.e. after his return from the Baltics) Gough attempted to earn his living as a pig and poultry farmer at Burrows Lea at Gomshall in Surrey. He also became a director of the Ashley Trading Company, initially selling US-manufactured wallpaper paste in Britain. In 1925–26 he bought land in Kenya with a view to moving out there, but thought better of it, in part because so much of his time was taken up with the affairs of Fifth Army veterans, and also because his farm in Surrey was not succeeding as he had hoped. He sold Burrows Lea in 1927.

The reputation which Gough had won on his commercial trip to Baku in 1919 enabled him to obtain several directorships, including Siemens Brothers and Caxton Electrical Development Company. After the economic downturn, coupled with poor performance by junior managers, led to the bankruptcy of several smaller companies of which he was a director, he exercised a much more hands-on management than was normal for directors. His business interests included slate quarries in Wales and the supply of electrical equipment in Warsaw. He was also involved in the management and fundraising of King&#x27;s College Hospital and St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London. As late as 1950, aged eighty, he was still chairman of Siemens Brothers, and a chairman or director of nine other companies.

===Battle of the memoirs===
The war correspondent Philip Gibbs, freed of the constraints of wartime censorship, wrote in &quot;Realities of War&quot; (1920) of the incompetence of British generals and of their staffs, the latter having &quot;the brains of canaries and the manners of Potsdam&quot;. His main target was Gough&#x27;s Fifth Army, although he wrote highly of Plumer and Harington&#x27;s leadership of Second Army.

&quot;The Fifth Army in France in 1918&quot; by Walter Shaw Sparrow (1921) gave some indication of the strain of the battle which Fifth Army had borne, although the book, written at the time of the Irish War of Independence, tended to denigrate the 16th (Irish) Division at the expense of the 36th (Ulster) Division. Gough thought Sparrow &quot;a fine old fighter&quot;.

Part II of Churchill&#x27;s &quot;World Crisis&quot; appeared in 1927, and praised Gough&#x27;s role in March 1918. In March 1930 Gough was approached by Lord Birkenhead to assist with the writing of a chapter on the March 1918 crisis in his forthcoming book &quot;Turning Points in History&quot;. Over dinner Birkenhead discussed how Haig had &quot;completely lost the confidence&quot; of the British War Cabinet by the end of 1917, and how in Birkenhead&#x27;s opinion – which Gough did not share – Pétain&#x27;s alleged entreaties had been &quot;lie(s) and bluff&quot; by the &quot;d-d French&quot; which did not justify a continuation of the Third Ypres Offensive. The book was published in October 1930 (after Birkenhead&#x27;s death) and the book&#x27;s praise of Gough&#x27;s handling of the March 1918 Offensive was widely quoted in newspaper reviews.

Gough&#x27;s conduct of the Somme and Third Ypres was strongly criticised by the Australian Official Historian Bean (1929 and 1933). Gough angrily denied Bean&#x27;s account of the events at Pozières in July 1916 (Edmonds, the British Official Historian, had passed on his comments to Bean in 1927) and Bean&#x27;s claim (in the 1916 volume, published 1929) that he was &quot;temperamentally&quot; prone to hasty attacks without proper reconnaissance.

After the publication of Birkenhead&#x27;s essay, and the news that his old colleague Maj-Gen Sir George Aston was earning good money as a newspaper correspondent, Gough wrote his own account &quot;The Fifth Army&quot; (1931). He approached the King&#x27;s adviser Lord Stamfordham as to whether His Majesty would be willing to mark the anniversary of March 1918 with a public tribute to the Fifth Army, only to be brushed aside by another Royal adviser Clive Wigram with the news that the King would prefer Gough, like Haig, not to write his memoirs. In the end the book was a great success. Gough was dissuaded from sending a copy to the King, but sent a copy to the Prince of Wales, receiving a handwritten note in reply. The book was ghosted by the novelist Bernard Newman. He made no mention of his dispute with Walker on 18 July 1916, although he pointedly omitted him from a list praising officers commanding Australian formations. Gough claimed that he had often vetoed attacks by subordinates if he thought them under-prepared, on too narrow a front, or in inadequate strength – Sheffield &amp; Todman argue that this was a deliberate answer to Bean&#x27;s charges. Writing about the Tavish Davidson memorandum of June 1917, he claimed that he had wanted to attack in shorter jumps (a claim not supported by contemporary documents) but that Plumer had insisted on going all-out for a deep objective on the first day. Gough also claimed that the delay in launching Third Ypres (from 25 to 31 July 1917) wasted good weather and &quot;was fatal to our hopes&quot; – this is untrue. The relevant chapters were also published separately as &quot;The March Retreat&quot; (1934).

In the mid-1930s the volume of Lloyd George&#x27;s memoirs covering Third Ypres was published. During the ensuing newspaper correspondence Lloyd George quoted Gough&#x27;s name in an attack on Haig, causing Gough to write to the newspapers in Haig&#x27;s defence. Ahead of the publication of the 1918 volume, Gough dined twice with Lloyd George and his historical adviser Liddell Hart. Gough was initially impressed by the former Prime Minister&#x27;s charisma, and was almost persuaded that he had had nothing to do with his sacking in April 1918, until he remembered that both Esher and Birkenhead had told him the truth years earlier. Lloyd George, who may well have been keen to appease a potential critic, eventually sent Gough a letter (described as &quot;carefully worded&quot; by Farrar-Hockley) claiming that new facts had come to his attention since that date, and admitting that Gough had been &quot;let down&quot; and that &quot;no General could have won that battle&quot;.

In 1936 Gough complained to Liddell Hart that Haig had dominated his Army Commanders instead of taking them into his confidence and discussing matters, a view later made much of by the Canadian academic Tim Travers – Sheffield points out that this view not only needs to be treated with caution (Haig in fact held regular conferences) but sits ill with the evidence of Gough&#x27;s own command habits. He complained to Edmonds (in 1938) that other Army and corps commanders did not issue enough detailed guidance to their subordinates.

===Final military service===
Gough&#x27;s colleagues continued to lobby the Government for him to receive an award (e.g. promotion to field marshal, a peerage and/or a cash grant) similar to that given the other army commanders at the end of the war. The Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin declined to do so in response to a Question in the Commons (10 November 1936), although he acknowledged that Gough&#x27;s reputation had been vindicated. After further lobbying (in part by Master of the Rolls Wilfred Greene, a former major on Gough&#x27;s staff) Gough was turned down for a GCB in King George VI&#x27;s Coronation Honours in 1937, but was eventually given the award in the Birthday Honours of the same year. His GCB was seen as official rehabilitation.

From 1936 until 1943, Gough was honorary colonel of the 16th/5th The Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers, at the insistence of the regiments concerned, despite some resistance from the War Office because of his role in the Curragh incident.

In the summer of 1938 Gough was invited by Hitler to visit a Nuremberg Rally, but declined as the Foreign Office refused to give him formal approval and advice (General Ian Hamilton accepted a similar invitation while visiting Berlin on behalf of the British Legion). In 1939, prior to the outbreak of war, Gough was initially appointed a &quot;conducting officer&quot; to supervise the evacuation of women and children to Kent and Sussex, but was asked to resign after it was pointed out that to use a distinguished general in this role was a gift to German propaganda. He later rejoined the organisation as a &quot;duty officer&quot; (an administrative role in London) and also served as a member of an &quot;emergency squad&quot; standing by to give assistance in the event of air raids, while continuing to write newspaper articles. In March 1940 he visited the French Army, where he met General Gamelin and inspected part of the Maginot Line – he was unimpressed by the French troops he saw, and thought effort had been wasted on fortifications which could have been used on training.

In May 1940 Gough joined the LDV (Home Guard) and was put in command of the Chelsea Home Guard, which he organised from scratch. News of his efficient performance reached Churchill&#x27;s ears, and in June 1940 he was soon promoted to Zone Commander Fulham &amp; Chelsea, in command of parts of Fulham and Victoria, but declined further promotion as he wished to enjoy his last chance of hands-on leadership of a military unit. A blind eye was turned to Gough&#x27;s age (the official upper age limit was 65) until August 1942, when he was at last asked to retire. By now he was suffering from arthritis, which would eventually see him walk with sticks and then become a wheelchair-user.

Gough helped to found, and was president of, the Irish Servicemen&#x27;s &quot;Shamrock Club&quot;, which opened in March 1943 off Park Lane, London W.1, with a grant of £1,000 from Guinness.

===Third Ypres and the &quot;Official History&quot;===

The volume of the &quot;Official History&quot; covering Third Ypres went through several drafts and did not appear until 1948, by which time the Official Historian Edmonds was in his late eighties. Gough, then in his mid-seventies, and remembering events of thirty years earlier with limited access to documents, lobbied hard to have himself shown in a better light, arguing that Haig had put verbal pressure on him to achieve a breakthrough towards Roulers.

Edmonds wrote to Wynne (17 February 1944), the author of the relevant volume, &quot;Gough was out to fight and get forward. He had no idea how to conduct the action Haig required and would not take advice. I heard him complain that the troops had no &quot;blood lust&quot;, the officers no &quot;spirit of the offensive&quot;. In the same letter Edmonds repeated the story of how Gough had once come into the officers&#x27; mess at Fifth Army HQ and demanded that two officers be shot as an example. In this draft Wynne suggested Gough had been overly ambitious to break through over a wide front, despite Haig&#x27;s orders at the Doullens Conference (7 May 1917) to &quot;wear down the enemy and have an objective&quot; (the objectives in this case being Passchendaele–Staden Ridge and then the coast) and Haig restrained him. Wynne agreed that Haig had originally intended a breakthrough, but wrote that he had learned from Davidson that Haig had changed his mind after his meeting with the politicians (25 June), after which he had issued renewed orders (30 June) for Gough to &quot;wear down the enemy&quot; but &quot;have an objective&quot;. Wynne argued that Gough had placed too much emphasis on the &quot;objective&quot; rather than the &quot;wearing down&quot;.

Gough objected to this claim and said that Haig had told him to aim for a breakthrough at the 28 June conference. He also pointed out that a sleeper roadway earmarked for exploiting cavalry had been prepared long before he had been appointed to command the offensive and that appointing him (a &quot;thruster&quot;) was evidence of Haig&#x27;s desire for ambitious objectives. Gough also objected to Wynne&#x27;s claim that he should have foreseen a wet August. In fact the weather seems to have broken unusually early that year.

After seeing Wynne&#x27;s draft Gough claimed that Haig had been responsible for too narrow and weak an initial thrust and that Haig&#x27;s &quot;personal explanations&quot; at the time urged Gough &quot;to capture the Passchendaele Ridge and advance as rapidly as possible on Roulers (if possible on the first day)&quot;, which lay behind the German front line [actually ] and thereafter on Ostend with the Fourth Army on the coast covering his left and &quot;very definitely ... an attempt to break through and moreover Haig never altered this opinion until the attack was launched as far as I know. He confirmed this general idea on several occasions.&quot; Gough also scoffed at the implication that Haig had disapproved of his breakthrough attempt but had done nothing to stop it, and that even the corps commanders had warned of Gough&#x27;s mistakes. Edmonds blamed the influence of Tavish Davidson on Wynne. Neill Malcolm, formerly Gough&#x27;s chief of staff, called the 1943 draft &quot;a farrago of malicious nonsense&quot; (he objected particularly to Wynne&#x27;s suggestion that Gough was allowed both to execute his attacks as he saw fit and to dictate to his corps commanders, without interference from Haig) and wrote that &quot;Haig decided that he wanted a breakthrough and Charteris was always telling him that the Germans were on the verge of cracking. The breakthrough was the policy.&quot;

Gough denied that Haig had firmly told him to capture the Gheluveld Plateau over lunch on 28 June but it is in Haig&#x27;s diary. He also accused Cavan of inventing a claim that he had begged Gough to let II Corps &quot;bang through on the right&quot; and a footnote to that effect was deleted from the History, although Cavan&#x27;s claim is in fact confirmed by letters at the time; Percy Beddington, then GSO1 of a division, later chief of staff Fifth Army, later felt that Gough should have devoted a further two divisions to attacking the Gheluveld Plateau. Gough claimed that it was he who had realised the mistake.

Gough also criticised Haig for a poor choice of battlefield, &quot;the worst possible for an offensive operation&quot; – he said Haig should have attacked at Cambrai (Edmonds accepted that attacks of some kind were necessary and felt that Flanders was the best spot, contrary to Gough&#x27;s opinion), for having a poor team around him (Charteris, Davidson, Lawrence, Kiggell) and for his top-down management style, claiming that Haig issued orders instead of gathering commanders and staff officers to thrash out the issues around a table. Gough also claimed that any entries in Haig&#x27;s diary urging a step-by-step advance had been &quot;written up after the event&quot;.

When told of Gough&#x27;s criticisms Wynne wrote that &quot;both Pilckem and Langemarck were thoroughly bad in their planning, and even the &quot;Official History&quot; should admit as much – and Gough must lump it. He should have been sacked for them without a pension.&quot; However, Wynne praised Gough&#x27;s &quot;gracious&quot; admission that Haig had been wrong to select him to command the offensive, an admission which eventually appeared in the &quot;Official History&quot;. Another of the writing team, W. B. Wood, wrote (letter undated but probably in December 1944) that Gough &quot;was at last getting his deserts&quot; for having caused &quot;disasters&quot; by &quot;adhering to his own plans for breaking the German lines over the whole of the Fifth Army front in preference to Haig&#x27;s views&quot;.

There was then a further rewrite under the influence of Tavish Davidson, stressing Haig&#x27;s involvement in the planning of the 31 July attacks. Edmonds ordered a further rewrite, at which point Norman Brook (future Cabinet Secretary) intervened and called a meeting as he felt Edmonds was exercising too much unfettered discretion over the tone of the History. Edmonds&#x27; &quot;Reflections&quot; blame Gough for &quot;distant objectives&quot; and ignoring Haig&#x27;s advice to clear the Gheluveld Plateau first. The final version of the &quot;Official History&quot; suggests that Edmonds came to agree with Gough that Haig had been pushing for a breakthrough, rather than the limited offensive agreed by the War Cabinet. Edmonds repeatedly mentions how, throughout the Gough and Plumer periods, Haig hoped that the next major blow might cause the disintegration of the German opposition.

==Family and final years==
Gough&#x27;s son Valentine died in infancy shortly after his return from South Africa. He and his wife Mary (known as &quot;Daisy&quot;) then had four daughters: Myrtle Eleanore born 4 April 1904, Anne born 1906, Joyce born 6 November 1913, and Denise born 26 March 1916. Myrtle married Major Eric Adlhelm Torlogh Dutton, CMG, CBE, in 1936. Gough&#x27;s wife died in March 1951.

In common with many generals of the era, Gough was a man of strong religious faith.

As late as 5 March 1951 Gough was writing to Edmonds to blame Tavish Davidson and Herbert Lawrence for their lack of influence over Haig&#x27;s decision-making and claiming that he should have requested an interview with Haig prior to the March 1918 attack, and demanded to hold the bulk of his forces back from the front line, although he doubted that Haig would have agreed to give up ground voluntarily. His long battle for rehabilitation after his unjust dismissal deflected attention from his poor generalship in 1916 and 1917, and by World War Two he had come to be regarded as a military elder statesman. His reputation was also helped by his longevity, and during the revival of interest in the First World War from the late 1950s onwards, he was treated fairly mildly by Alan Clark and A. J. P. Taylor, not least because criticism was so increasingly focussed on Douglas Haig. Gough published another volume of memoirs, &quot;Soldiering On&quot;, in 1954. The book contains a number of factual errors. In March 1963, shortly before his death, Gough was interviewed on television (the &quot;Tonight&quot; Programme), using the opportunity to criticise his old nemesis Wilson.

==Death==
Gough died in London on 18 March 1963 at the age of 92. He suffered from bronchial pneumonia for a month before his death occurred.

==Assessments==
Gough was a man of whom there were extreme opinions; he was the only senior general who regularly visited forward trenches. He was the youngest of the Army Commanders by five years (the next-youngest was Birdwood, who briefly commanded Fifth Army in 1918). F. S. Oliver wrote that Gough brought &quot;something of the nature of religious fervour into his profession&quot;. He is often described as having had a &quot;peppery&quot; personality. However, Captain Charles Carrington (&quot;Soldiers From the Wars Returning&quot; p. 104) recorded that Gough was very civil to him when he encountered him out riding.

===Contemporary views===
Boraston, in his strongly pro-Haig account (1922), wrote that Gough&#x27;s performance on the Somme &quot;amply justified the selection of this young but brilliant general&quot; and wrote highly of Gough&#x27;s performance during the semi-open warfare of early 1917, during the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line. Beddington described him as &quot;a great commander&quot; for his performance on the Somme. Liddell Hart (in a letter in 1954) wrote that Gough was &quot;unlucky&quot; to command under stalemate conditions and that in an earlier war, or World War Two, might have been &quot;one of the outstanding figures in military history ... his performance was a lot better than was generally recognised&quot;. In the &quot;Official History&quot; Edmonds argued that under different circumstances Gough might have been a great leader in open warfare like &quot;the late General Patton&quot;, and claimed that widespread opinion thought it a pity that an opportunity had been wasted that Gough was not in command of the cavalry at Cambrai.

Sir Charles Bonham-Carter, head of GHQ Training in 1917–18, argued that Gough &quot;had greater qualities than any of the other Army Commanders&quot; and had had the potential to be a great general, but was let down by a poor staff, and was too impatient to realise that infantry attacks needed &quot;time to prepare&quot;.

Maj-Gen Sir Richard Bannatine-Allason wrote to Edmonds (in 1931) that Gough&#x27;s &quot;temperament did not suit him for command&quot; and &quot;found him full of nerves &amp; hunting his subordinates&quot;. Simon Robbins suggests that the death of his brother in fighting on the Western Front in early 1915 may well have exacerbated Gough&#x27;s latter personality traits during the conflict.

===Modern historians===
Gough&#x27;s admiring biographer Anthony Farrar-Hockley pointed out that during the Battle of the Somme Gough had captured more difficult ground than Rawlinson, had taken more prisoners (17,723 as opposed to 15,630) but had suffered only half as many casualties (125,531 as opposed to 227,194). Farrar-Hockley also pointed out that not only did Gough not have enough artillery to succeed at Ypres in August 1917, but also argues that the limited advances advocated by &quot;Tavish&quot; Davidson were no cheaper in lives and did not stand any chance of achieving breakthrough or capturing German guns.

Simkins argues that Gough might have been more successful in the semi-open warfare of the Hundred Days. Gough was, in Philpott&#x27;s view &quot;probably the most discussed and vilified British Western Front general (after Haig at least) ... intelligent, quick witted and charming, a popular man in the army, both confident and courageous&quot; although not popular with subordinates, and was &quot;still learning his trade&quot; in July 1916. However, Philpott concedes that he &quot;interfered far too much&quot; with his subordinates.

Prior &amp; Wilson write of his command record on the Somme: &quot;His grasp of the tactical situation ... seemed always limited, his dithering over the best way to capture Thiepval was disastrous for his troops, and his &#x27;victory&#x27; at Beaumont Hamel much over-rated. His performance at the Somme should have seen him sink into a well-deserved obscurity. Perversely, in 1917, the opposite was to happen.&quot;

Historians tend to take an equally dim view of Gough&#x27;s record at Third Ypres. Simpson writes that after the &quot;more or less unsuccessful&quot; operations on 10 and 16 August, Gough &quot;in the end ... decided upon a more or less staggered approach, first one corps attacking and then another, which invited the sort of treatment the Germans had meted out to Fourth Army&#x27;s piecemeal attacks the previous year. Throughout, though admittedly crippled by the weather, he failed to stick to the principles of careful preparation he had defined at the start of the planning for the offensive. While corps orders were as careful as before, the operations were doomed to fail&quot;. John Lee writes that &quot;despite the atrocious rainfall Gough persisted in attacking through August in conditions that led to inevitable defeat and a severe loss of morale among the usually steady and reliable British infantry&quot;. Prior &amp; Wilson simply describe Gough&#x27;s August operations as &quot;abysmal&quot;.

Ian Beckett (1999), building on Tim Travers&#x27; (1987) concept of a &quot;command vacuum&quot;, argues that Gough&#x27;s failings can in part be attributed to structural failings in the BEF chain of command, as officers grappled with the problems of commanding large formations under stalemate conditions, and the degree of initiative which should be permitted to subordinates. Gary Sheffield does not agree, and argues that before 1918 Gough&#x27;s &quot;poor performance at Third Ypres&quot; masked the &quot;tactical and operational improvements&quot; which were being made.

Sheffield argues that Gough&#x27;s overbearing behaviour, especially in 1916, may well have been a need to overcompensate for having been promoted at such a young age, over the heads of jealous colleagues (Gough admitted (&quot;The Fifth Army&quot; p. 94) that his rapid promotion brought &quot;special difficulties&quot; at Loos), many of whom mistrusted him because of the Curragh incident. He also argues that Gough &quot;demonstrated a good deal of skill during the March (1918) retreat&quot; and might have come into his own during the advances of the Hundred Days but that his &quot;military vices outweighed his virtues&quot; and &quot;he was not the right man to command an Army on the Somme,&quot; although he blames Haig to some extent for not supervising him properly. In Sheffield&#x27;s view, Archibald Wavell&#x27;s later observation that Western Front operations were often conducted as &quot;open warfare at the halt&quot; (i.e. seeking to commit reserves to &quot;break the enemy line&quot; as opposed to careful siege operations) certainly applied to Gough&#x27;s command at the Somme. &quot;His inability to take direction, and his wholehearted and often unjustified confidence in his own planning, led him to overestimate his army&#x27;s abilities and contributed to his disastrous operations at Bullecourt and Third Ypres&quot;. At Third Ypres his performance was &quot;hopelessly optimistic&quot; and &quot;deeply disappointing&quot;. &quot;Haig promoted and sustained (Gough) beyond his level of competence&quot; although &quot;arguably, while he deserved dismissal for his handling of the Somme, Bullecourt and Third Ypres, Gough was sacked for the one major battle in which he commanded Fifth Army with some competence&quot;.

Les Carlyon concurs that Gough was unfairly dealt with in 1918 but also regards his performance during the Great War in generally unflattering terms, citing documented and repeated failings in planning, preparation, comprehension of the battle space and a lack of empathy with the common soldier.

====Execution of officer====
Edmonds later wrote (to Wynne, 17 February 1944, during the period of the writing of the Third Ypres volume of the &quot;Official History&quot;) that he had heard Gough say that his men had &quot;no blood lust&quot; and that officers had &quot;no spirit of the offensive&quot;, and that in 1918 he had once come into the mess demanding that two officers be shot &quot;pour encourager les autres&quot;, and despite being told by the APM (Assistant Provost Marshal) that there were no officers currently under arrest, &quot;he got them&quot;. Nicholas Ridley comments that the suggestion that Gough effectively committed murder is, on the face of it, absurd and an example of the problems of relying on uncorroborated decades-old eyewitness testimony. However, it has been suggested that the story may have arisen from the execution of Sub-Lt Edwin Dyett in January 1917, for alleged desertion while serving with the Royal Naval Division at Beaucourt on 13 November 1916. Gough, overruling the Divisional Commander&#x27;s recommendation for clemency, recommended that the execution proceed.

===Fifth Army&#x27;s &quot;malaise&quot;===
Some put the blame for Fifth Army&#x27;s performance on Gough&#x27;s Chief of Staff Neill Malcolm, although his overbearing behaviour with Gough&#x27;s subordinates may have been, even in the view of contemporaries, a variant on the &quot;good-cop/bad-cop&quot; routine. Edmonds also wrote in his memoirs (which are somewhat less reliable than the &quot;Official History&quot;) that Malcolm &quot;accentuated and encouraged Gough&#x27;s peculiarities, instead of softening them down&quot; and claimed that in late 1917 Peyton (Military Secretary) had warned Haig &quot;three times that he was not only injuring himself but also injuring the cause by keeping Gough in command&quot; but Haig was &quot;perfectly infatuated with him&quot;. The situation worsened after Edward Beddington, who had been something of a buffer, left Fifth Army staff in 1917. Gough, in conversation with Liddell Hart and in &quot;The Fifth Army&quot; put some blame on Malcolm and also blamed himself for taking Malcolm with him on his inspection rounds, so that officers did not feel able to speak freely. Michael Howard, in his review of Farrar-Hockley&#x27;s biography, commented that there was more to Fifth Army&#x27;s &quot;malaise&quot; than that. Sheffield points out that this does not seem to have been Gough&#x27;s view during the war and that Gough&#x27;s problems began before Malcolm&#x27;s arrival (e.g. at Loos) and continued after his removal. Watts of XIX Corps was the biggest victim of Malcolm. Farrar-Hockley argues that Gough was a popular figure until Bullecourt. Wilson&#x27;s academic biographer Keith Jeffery describes Farrar-Hockley as &quot;an unconvincing defence&quot; of Gough.

Gough was notorious for his &quot;encounters&quot; with subordinates (Brigadier-General Sandilands to Edmonds, 1923). He was &quot;looked on as a bit of a freak&quot; (Brigadier-General Yatman to Edmonds, 1930). By late 1917 &quot;no division wanted to go&quot; to Fifth Army (Liddell Hart 1947) and most units looked on transfer to the Second Army (Plumer) with relief (Liddell Hart 1927). In &quot;The Fifth Army&quot; Gough acknowledged that there were some who hated coming into the Fifth Army, although he maintained that these were men lacking in boldness, resolution or energy. He wrote to Edmonds (18 March 1944) that &quot;among the senior officers the spirit of energy, of resolution, &amp; of initiative, was lamentably under-developed&quot;.

<text>A digital imaging technician (DIT) was created for the motion picture industry in response to the transition from the long established film movie camera medium into the current digital cinema era. The DIT is the camera department crew member who works in collaboration with the cinematographer on workflow, systemization, camera settings, signal integrity and image manipulation to achieve the highest image quality and creative goals of cinematography in the digital realm.

With the progression of the digitization ever more tasks concerning data management emerged: the position of the Digital Imaging Technician was introduced. The DIT is the connector between on-set time and post production. DITs support the camera team with technical and creative tasks with the digital camera. Their purpose is to ensure the best technical quality possible, as well as production safety. DITs are responsible for tasks during preparation, on-set time and post production. They are also responsible for managing data on set, such as making backups and quality checks of the material. In post production, the DIT hands the recordings to the post production team, possibly after checking the quality of the material and generating working copies.

Data backups and quality control are of great significance for the DIT who has to make sure that the original camera data and metadata is backed up at least twice daily, ensuring data integrity with checksum verification. Furthermore, the data may be backed up on LTO tape which is hardier than electronic devices and is used for long-term storage. Another copy must be made on a transfer data carrier that will be sent to post production along with the reports of the content. Again, the data has to be backed up. The data has to be accessible at all times and should be saved in a system where it can be reviewed, displaying the metadata of each clip.

The DIT&#x27;s role on-set has become especially prevalent through assisting cinematographers, normally accustomed to film stock, in achieving their desired look digitally. This is accomplished by the DIT through monitoring picture exposure, setting up Color Decision List (CDL) on daily basis and, if requested, &quot;look up tables&quot; (LUTs) for the post-production. Additionally, the DIT handles any settings in the digital camera&#x27;s menu system, such as recording format and outputs. As a courtesy, the DIT also secures the digital audio recorded by the external digital audio recorder operated by the Production Sound Mixer.

== Related positions ==
Alongside the digital imaging technician, the digital loader position has also been created. Digital loaders may be independent or work under a digital imaging technician. A data wrangler is another common term for the role of digital loader. A digital loader supports the camera department by managing, transferring and securing all the digital data acquired on-set via any digital cinematography cameras, interacting with the 2nd AC. Depending on the scale of the project, the DIT can also wrangle data, but never the opposite. In tradition with the classic role of film loader, the 2nd AC may alternatively take on the responsibility of digital loading as an additional duty.

A digital loader may also be called a loader, DMT (Data Management Technician), data wrangler or film loader. Loaders usually, however, have responsibilities in addition to data wrangling, like maintaining the camera truck and completing paperwork for the camera crew. Traditional film loaders also continue to be employed on film productions where the skills of a DIT aren&#x27;t applicable.

Prior to the DIT position and its focus on on-set image work, several other positions, including video controllers, video shaders and video engineers performed similar functions of exposure and color control on a live video feed. While video positions still exist (especially in live broadcast and studio television), the DIT position has become commonplace in cinema, commercials and digital television.

<text>U.S. Route 58 (US 58) is an east–west U.S. Highway that runs for from U.S. Route 25E just northwest of Harrogate, Tennessee, to U.S. Route 60 in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Until 1996, when the Cumberland Gap Tunnel opened, US 58 ran only inside the commonwealth of Virginia (and it now runs only about 1 mile outside of Virginia into Tennessee before terminating). It was then extended southwest along a short piece of former US 25E, which no longer enters Virginia, to end at the new alignment in Tennessee. For most of its alignment, it closely parallels Virginia&#x27;s southern border with North Carolina.

State Route 383 (SR 383) is overlaid on U.S. Route 58 in Tennessee.

U.S. Route 58 is the longest numbered route in Virginia.

==Route description==

===Tennessee===
US 58 begins at a trumpet interchange with US 25E, just south of the Cumberland Gap Tunnel. The interchange is located on the border of the municipalities of Cumberland Gap and Harrogate, within Claiborne County. The route travels northeast as a four lane divided highway, through a small section of Cumberland Gap with a few businesses. US 58 then abruptly leaves Cumberland Gap and enters a small section of a rural area within Harrogate, passing along the southeastern edge of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. After intersecting a road leading to the park and the historical area in Cumberland Gap, the route leaves the state of Tennessee and enters the commonwealth of Virginia, after only about a half mile in Tennessee.

US 58 in Tennessee carries the designation State Route 383.

===Virginia===
====Tennessee to Jonesville====
Upon entering Virginia, US 58 also enters Lee County and becomes Wilderness Road. The divided highway makes a reverse turn heading generally towards the east, in a forested region, before turning east-northeast after to the south of the Wilderness Road entrance to the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. US 58 crosses over Station Creek, before curving due east through the hamlet of Gibson Station. Past Gibson Station, the highway passes northeast through an area of a rolling hills with homes surrounding either side of the road. It is paralleled by Indian Creek on its southeast side, with the route crossing over its Pendleton Branch, prior to intersecting SR 691 in the village of Wheeler. US 58 continues northeast from Wheeler, before turning due east again while passing along the southern edge of the Wilderness Road State Park. The route crosses Indian Creek twice, before intersecting SR 684 to the southwest of a park and ride lot, and the DeBusk Veterinary Teaching Center of Lincoln Memorial University. The route then dips south through more rural areas of rolling hills, residences, and farmland before turning northeast once more. After passing through some hill cuts with stone sides and crossing over the Roaring Branch of Indian Creek, US 58 reaches the unincorporated town of Ewing. At Ewing, the route reaches its first intersection with a gantry, as its intersection with SR 724 has a blinking yellow light above it. US 58 continues northeast through more rural forests and farmland along the southeastern slope of Poor Valley Ridge, before reaching the unincorporated town of Rose Hill. In Rose Hill, more businesses and houses appear along the edges of the road, and a jersey barrier briefly forms in the median before the road crosses over the White Branch of the Powell River. Beyond the crossing, the median reverts to a grassy surface as US 58 leaves Rose Hill. The route continues to pass more homes, mainly in the traditional style, and businesses, mainly those that are timber shed retailers, before it makes a brief turn to the due east. Here US 58 crosses over Burning Well Road, Hardy Creek, and the railroad line of CSX Transportation (former L&amp;N) leading to the Hagan&#x27;s Switchback, on a twin-span beam bridge. The route then turns back towards the northeast and crosses the Hugh C. Chance Memorial Bridge. US 58 then makes a curve to the southeast through hilly wooded areas, before crossing over Dry Creek and meeting State Routes 880 and 758 at an intersection. The latter road provides access to the Lee County Airport. Past the intersection, US 58 briefly gains an eastbound climbing lane, before narrowing back to two lanes in each direction. The route continues east before heading northeast through wooded residential areas. Soon US 58 narrows to a two-lane rural road heading east through hilly residential zones entering the town limits of Jonesville, the county seat of Lee County.

====Jonesville to Virginia Beach====
East of Jonesville, US 58 intersects US 421, and the two routes stay concurrent through Duffield (where the concurrency also picks up U.S. 23), Gate City, Weber City (where the US 23 concurrency ends), and Bristol, where US 58 begins a concurrency with Interstate 81. The two routes stay concurrent until I-81 exit 19 in Abingdon, where US 58 resumes its eastward journey close to the Virginia–North Carolina state line. The route is signed as the J.E.B. Stuart Highway and the A. L. Philpott Memorial Highway. Much of the highway through the region features hairpin turns, steep grades, and load-zoned bridges.

US 58 begins a concurrency with US 221 in Independence, and the routes stay merged through Hillsville, just past the interchange with Interstate 77. Continuing eastward, the route crosses the Blue Ridge Parkway in the unincorporated community of Meadows of Dan before winding its way to Martinsville, where US 58 and US 220 share a southern bypass of the city. Between Stuart and the Martinsville bypass, several loops are found following the original alignment. East of Martinsville, a loop between Byrd&#x27;s Store and Axton follows the original alignment, although one section west of Byrd&#x27;s Store and one section east of Chatmoss remain inaccessible. Between Martinsville and Danville and between Danville and South Boston the route was widened to four lanes as part of the Arterial Highway system initiated by the Commonwealth in the mid 1960s. A newer alignment was generally just added to the older alignment. A loop of the older alignment is visible east of Brosville.

Approaching Danville, US 58 once again follows an expressway bypass to the south of the city, while a business route enters the city itself. It reaches its southernmost point near the North Carolina state line at its interchange with US 29, where the exit ramp to southbound US 29 immediately enters North Carolina, and the ramp to eastbound US 58 from northbound US 29 instantly enters Virginia. Drivers continuing into the city without exiting onto US 58 east instantly enter Virginia before going under the bridge that carries the bypass. The southeastern half of this bypass is shared with 9. East of Danville, US 29 continues north, while US 58 picks up US 360 (which begins in central Danville) and resumes its eastward journey. The routes stay cosigned until South Boston, where US 360 resumes a more northerly route to Richmond, while US 58 travels eastward to Clarksville and crosses Kerr Lake.

The route crosses US Route 1 and Interstate 85 in South Hill, followed by Interstate 95 in Emporia. Near Franklin, an expressway bypass carries US 58 (and, for one stretch, US 258) south of the city, while a business route enters the city. A bypass also carries traffic around Suffolk, where US 58 begins concurrencies with US 13 and then US 460. The three US routes stay merged until an intersection with the Hampton Roads Beltway at the confluence of Interstate 64, Interstate 264, and Interstate 664. US 58 travels inside the beltway and through Portsmouth and into Norfolk via the Midtown Tunnel. The route crosses I-64 once again, and continues to Virginia Beach, roughly paralleling I-264 to its south. US 58, designated as Virginia Beach Boulevard and becoming Laskin Rd. in Virginia Beach, ends at US 60, Pacific Ave. Historically, US 58 continued for one additional block to the east, ending at Atlantic Ave., which once carried US 60 and then Business US 60.

Much of the western section of US 58 is part of Crooked Road, Virginia and The Crooked Road: Virginia&#x27;s Heritage Music Trail.

=== Alternate route ===
An alternate route of US 58, known as U.S. Route 58 Alternate (US 58 Alt.), splits from the main route in Abingdon, Virginia and travels northwest (signed west) as the &quot;Trail of the Lonesome Pine&quot; to Coeburn. From there, US 58 Alt. travels in a southwesterly direction (signed west) through Norton, Big Stone Gap and Pennington Gap before rejoining the main route in Jonesville.
==History==
The corridor across southern Virginia was part of the initial 1918 state highway system, in which it was State Route 12. It generally followed the present U.S. 58 from Abingdon to Virginia Beach, while present US 58 west of Abingdon was part of State Route 10. These routes deviated from present US 58 in the following places:
*SR 10 left Virginia into Kentucky at Cumberland Gap; the piece of current US 58 into Tennessee was (in general terms) State Route 107 from 1923 to 1928 and State Route 100 from 1928 to 1933 (as well as U.S. Route 25E from 1926 to 1996).
*SR 10 used present U.S. Route 58 Alternate from Jonesville to Pennington Gap and U.S. 421 southeast back to U.S. 58.
*SR 10 used present State Route 638 and State Route 600 from near Pattonsville to Clinchport.
*SR 10 used present U.S. 421 and U.S. Route 11 through Bristol to Abingdon. From Abingdon to Meadowview, where SR 12 began, SR 10 used present State Route 609.
*SR 12 used present State Route 80 and State Route 803 from Meadowview to Lodi and roughly present State Route 91 to Damascus.
*From Danville to Boydton, SR 12 used present State Route 360 to near Scottsburg, U.S. Route 360 to Clover, and State Route 92 to Boydton. Present US 58 was State Route 44 (formed ca. 1930) from Danville to Clarksville, and from Clarksville to Boydton it was initially part of State Route 1, renumbered State Route 31 in the 1923 renumbering, State Route 324 from soon after 1923 to 1927, part of State Route 201 from 1927 to 1928, and State Route 400 from 1928 to 1933.
*From Suffolk to Portsmouth, SR 12 used present State Route 337.

In 1959 there were plans to extend US 58 from Cumberland Gap to St. Louis, using US 25 to London, KY, using Kentucky Route 80 to Kentucky Lake, then join U.S. Route 68 to St. Louis.

<text>Francisco Manuel da Silva (21 February 1795 – 18 December 1865) was a Brazilian songwriter and music professor, notable for composing the Brazilian National Anthem.

==Biography==
Silva was born on 21 February in Rio de Janeiro and died on 18 December 1865, at the age of 70, in the same city. He had great prominence in the musical life of Rio de Janeiro in the period between the death of José Maurício Nunes Garcia and Antônio Carlos Gomes. He was a singer of Capela Real since 1809, and later a cello player. He was one of the founders of (National Imperial Music and Opera Academy), of , which became (Nacional Music Institute) and is called (Rio de Janeiro University Music School).

He was taught by José Maurício Nunes Garcia and, most probably, by Sigismund Neukomm. He was directly responsible for Capela Imperial&#x27;s reinstatement and being turned to its old beauty. He left a handful of works, spread around Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and São Paulo archives, covering gospel music, modinhas and lundus.

He composed the Brazilian National Anthem, first as a patriotic march, since emperor Pedro I&#x27;s abdication, later being officialized as anthem by the Brazilian Republic Revolution (1889). He also composed one opera, &quot;O prestigio da lei&quot;.

<text>In financial regulation, a Suspicious Activity Report(SAR) or Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) is a report made by a financial institution about suspicious or potentially suspicious activity as required under laws designed to counter money laundering, financing of terrorism and other financial crimes. The criteria to decide when a report must be made varies from country to country, but generally, it is any financial transaction that either a) does not make sense to the financial institution; b) is unusual for that particular client; or c) appears to be done only for the purpose of hiding or obfuscating another, separate transaction. The report is filed with that country&#x27;s Financial Intelligence Unit, which is typically a specialist agency designed to collect and analyse transactions and then report these to relevant law enforcement teams.

Front-line staff in the financial institution have the responsibility to identify transactions that may be suspicious and these are reported to a designated person who is responsible for reporting the suspicious transaction. This means that the front line staff can ask questions and in some cases refuse the transaction. However, the financial institution is not allowed to inform the client or parties involved in the transaction that a SAR has been lodged, otherwise known as tipping off under the Financial Action Task Force&#x27;s Recommendations.

The Financial Action Task Force&#x27;s Recommendations are widely recognized as the international standard in anti-money laundering and countering financing terrorism with endorsements from 180 nations. FATF Recommendations set forth essential measures to combat money laundering and to protect domestic and international monetary systems including the application of preventive measures for the financial sector and other designated sectors; and the establishment of powers and responsibilities for the relevant competent authorities (e.g., investigative, law enforcement and supervisory authorities), including guidelines regarding suspicious activity reports.

Most countries have laws that require financial institutions to report suspicious transactions and will have a designated agency to receive them. The agency to which a report is required to be filed for a given country is typically part of the law enforcement or financial regulatory department of that country. For example, in the United States, suspicious transaction reports must be reported to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an agency of the United States Department of the Treasury. FinCEN maintains a team of analysts who meticulously review these Suspicious Activity Reports to detect potential money laundering activities. They also supply informational support to local law enforcement, along with national and international bodies including the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), the National White-Collar Crime Center (NWCCC), and the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), facilitating further actions.

In Australia, the Suspicious Matter Report must be reported to Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), an Australian government agency. A 2020 Bank Policy Institute study found that American SARs elicited a response from law enforcement in a median of 4% of reports and that a tiny subset of those responses resulted in arrest and conviction, suggesting that 90% to 95% of SARs reports were false positives of unlawful activity.

European Securities and Markets Authority reported around 52% of Suspicious Transaction and Order Reports in European Union was insider trading, while market manipulation was around 47% for 2023.

==History==
In 1992, the requirement to file suspicious activity reports (as well as the accompanying implied gag order) in the United States was added by Section 1517(b) of the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act (part of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, , , 4060).

==Reporting==
SARs include detailed information about transactions that are or appear to be suspicious. The goal of SAR filings is to help the government identify individuals, groups, and organizations involved in fraud, such as terrorist financing, money laundering, and other crimes.

The purpose of a suspicious activity report is to detect and report known or suspected violations of law or suspicious activity observed by financial institutions subject to the regulations (for example, the United States Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)). In many instances, SARs have been instrumental in enabling law enforcement to initiate or supplement major money laundering or terrorist financing investigations and other criminal cases. Information provided in SAR forms also presents governments with a method of identifying emerging trends and patterns associated with financial crimes. The information about those trends and patterns is vital to law enforcement agencies and provides valuable feedback to financial institutions.

Under the United States Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), financial institutions are required to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering, such as:
* Keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments,
* File reports of cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and
* Report suspicious activity that might signal criminal activity (e.g., money laundering, tax evasion)

==Reporters==
The report can start with any employee of a financial services institution. The employees are trained to be alert for suspicious activity, such as situations where people are trying to wire money out of the country without identification, or activity by someone with no job who starts depositing large amounts of cash into an account. Employees are trained to ask questions about the transaction and communicate their suspicion up their chain of command where further decisions are made about whether to file a report or not.

Many different types of finance-related industries are required to file SARs. These include:
* depository institutions (for example, banks and credit unions)
* securities and futures dealers (for example, stock brokers and mutual fund brokers)
* money services businesses (for example, check cashing services, currency exchange bureaus, and money order providers)
* casinos and card clubs
* dealers in precious metals and gems (for example, jewelry dealers)
* insurance companies
* mortgage companies and brokers

==Other related reports==
Most countries also require other types of transactions to be reported. For example, in the United States, FinCEN requires businesses and individuals to report:
* individuals who transport more than $10,000 in currency into or out of the country
* shippers and receivers involved in the transfer of $10,000 in currency into or out of the country
* businesses that receive more than $10,000 in currency in a single transaction or in related transactions
* people who have control over more than $10,000 in financial accounts outside of the country during a calendar year

==Confidentiality==
In most countries, unauthorized disclosure of a SAR filing is an offense. In the United States, it is specifically a federal criminal offense.

Financial institutions are required to undertake an investigation process prior to filing a SAR to ensure that the information reported is appropriate, complete, and accurate. This process will often include review by financial investigators, management and/or attorneys prior to filing.

To encourage complete candor and cooperation, there are disclosure and evidentiary privileges that protect SAR filers. First, an individual or organization is precluded from discovering the existence or contents of a SAR that includes the individual or organization&#x27;s name. SARs filers are immune from the discovery process. Second, SAR filers enjoy immunity for all statements made in their SARs, regardless of whether those statements were allegedly made in bad faith.

==Penalties for non-compliance==
In most countries financial institutions and their employees face civil and criminal penalties for failing to properly file suspicious activity reports, including any combination of fines, regulatory restrictions, loss of banking charter, or imprisonment.

==By country==
The number of Suspicious Transaction and Order Reports for 2023 was in Germany more than two thousand, in France more than one thousand, and in Sweden more than five hundred, as reported by European Securities and Markets Authority.

<text>Round Square is an international network of schools, based on the educational concepts of Kurt Hahn, and named after a distinctive building at Gordonstoun. Founded by a group of seven schools in the late 1960s, by 1996 it had grown to 20 member schools worldwide, and has since expanded to over 200 schools. Round Square is incorporated in England as a Company Limited by Guarantee, and is a registered charity.

==History==
Between 1962 and 1963 Jocelin Winthrop Young and Roy McComish listed all the schools which they considered to have adopted the educational ideas of Kurt Hahn or had included them at their foundation. These schools were: in Scotland, Rannoch School and Dunrobin School; in England, Abbotsholme School, Battisborough and Milton Abbey; in Germany Louisenlund; in Switzerland Aiglon College, in Ghana Achimota School; in India The Doon School; and the soon to open Athenian School in California. Salem, Gordonstoun, Anavryta and Box Hill were &#x27;taken for granted&#x27; as the already established and pre-eminent Hahnian schools.

On 5 June 1966, Kurt Hahn&#x27;s 80th birthday was celebrated at Schule Schloss Salem, and as the headmaster of the school Winthrop Young invited the headmasters of Box Hill School, Gordonstoun, Louisenlund, Anavryta, Battisborough, the Athenian School, and the recently opened Atlantic College, to discuss the establishment of a Hahn schools conference. This meeting was chaired by King Constantine and during its course an agreement was reached on naming the conference &quot;The Hahn Schools&quot;, it was then decided that the first conference would be held at Gordonstoun in 1967. At this first conference at Hahn&#x27;s insistence the name &quot;The Hahn Schools&quot; was dropped in favour of a new name &quot;The Round Square&quot; after an iconic building at Gordounstoun. Six of the schools that attended this first conference and were the founding members of the Round Square: Box Hill School, Gordonstoun, Anavryta Experimental Lyceum, Schule Schloss Salem, Aiglon College and Abbotsholme School. At the 2nd Round Square conference held at Box Hill the principles of the association were established and co-education was the first of the sequence of conference themes that were discussed. At a later conference held at Box Hill in 1980 the R.S.I.S. (Round Square International Service) was created to promote and organise overseas voluntary service projects in much the same way as the project in Cephalonia. Winthrop Young retired as headmaster of Salem in 1974 but continued to run the Round Square association as Honorary Secretary and later as Director until he retired from that position in 1992.

==Activities==
Round Square schools encourage students to take part in a range of community service activities both locally and internationally. Many projects are run through the school and further opportunities are available via the Round Square Region, Network and Worldwide Organisation. Notable events including the Round Square International Conference (RSIC), where as the most recent 2024 conference took place in Brookhouse School, Nairobi.

== Round Square IDEALS ==
Round Square schools are characterised by a shared belief in an approach to education built around six themes, our IDEALS, drawn from the theories of the educationalist Kurt Hahn.

<text>U.S. Route 63 (US 63) is a , north–south United States Highway primarily in the Midwestern and Southern United States. The southern terminus of the route is at Interstate 20 (I-20) in Ruston, Louisiana; the northern terminus is at US 2 west of Ashland, Wisconsin.

==Route description==

===Louisiana===

US 63 runs concurrently with US 167 for its entire route in Louisiana, from Ruston north, to Junction City, at the Arkansas state line, a distance of .

===Arkansas===

U.S. 63 enters into Arkansas from Louisiana concurrent with US 167 in Junction City. Just a few miles into the state, the two highways run on the eastern edge of El Dorado as an expressway. US 167 splits here, traveling towards Hampton. US 63 bypasses the town of Warren, crossing US 278. US 63 passes through the rural Cleveland County, then enters into Jefferson County.
In Jefferson County, US 63 serves the city of Pine Bluff. US 63 bypasses the city, running on the last 3 miles of I-530. Also in Pine Bluff, the highway overlaps with US 65 and US 79. US 63 runs northeast with US 79 until Stuttgart, where the highway runs north to Hazen. Just north of Hazen, US 63 overlaps with I-40 to Brinkley. In Brinkley, US 63 begins an overlap with US 49 north to Jonesboro. US 63 leaves US 49 and follows I-555 until I-555 terminates, together serving as a bypass for southern Jonesboro. In Hoxie, US 63 intersects with US 67 (Future I-57). Northwest of here near Portia the highway overlaps with US 412.

In Imboden US 62 joins this overlap. In Hardy, US 63 leaves the two highways. In Mammoth Spring, US 63 crosses into Missouri, traveling to West Plains.

While historically there were many non-concurrencies on US 63, many of those have been resolved. In 2016, US 63 from Jonesboro (including its original US 49 concurrency from Red Wolf Blvd. to Southwest Drive) to Turrell was designated as I-555. As a result, US 63 was rerouted to run concurrently with US 49 from Brinkley to Jonesboro. US 63 then runs concurrently with I-555 until it ends west of Jonesboro, where it then continues northwest alone to its concurrency with US 412 at Portia, just northwest of Walnut Ridge.

===Missouri===

The highway passes south-to-north through Missouri, from Arkansas to Iowa, serving cities such as Rolla, Jefferson City, Columbia, Moberly, Macon, and Kirksville. Notable routes that are intersected include US 60 in Howell County, I-44 at Rolla, US 50 (with which it shares a concurrency into Jefferson City south of the Missouri River until it reaches the junction with US 54), US 54 (which it overlaps in Jefferson City from the junction with US 50 and crosses the Missouri River with on the Jefferson City Bridge), I-70 at Columbia, US 24 at Moberly, US 36 at Macon, and US 136 at Lancaster.

US 63 in Missouri was Route 7 from 1922 to 1926.

===Iowa===

US 63 passes south-to-north through Iowa. It enters the state from Missouri south of Bloomfield. Between Ottumwa and Oskaloosa, the highway overlaps Iowa Highway 163. This segment is an expressway which connects Des Moines with Burlington, with freeway bypasses of Ottumwa and Eddyville. Near Malcom, US 63 meets I-80. Only a few miles later, it joins US 6 westbound for several miles near Grinnell, then goes north again. At Toledo, it intersects US 30 and at Waterloo, US 63 meets US 20. An expressway section opened in October 2012, completing the four-lane link between Waterloo and New Hampton. The highway enters Minnesota just north of Chester.

===Minnesota===

US 63 enters Minnesota from Iowa south of Spring Valley. After meeting I-90, US 63 serves the local airport and then intersects with US 52. In this area, US 63 is an expressway, but plans are to upgrade the highway to a freeway between Stewartville and the US 52 interchange. North of Rochester, the highway meets US 61 at Lake City. From there, the two routes run concurrently to Red Wing, where US 63 turns north and crosses the Mississippi River to enter Wisconsin over the Eisenhower Bridge.

The Minnesota section of US 63 is defined as Routes 59 and 161 in Minnesota Statutes §§ 161.114(2) and 161.115(92).

===Wisconsin===
US 63 enters Wisconsin south of Hager City. Near Baldwin, US 63 intersects I-94. The highway briefly overlaps near Spooner with US 53. At Trego, they separate and US 63 runs southwest to northeast, passing through Hayward and Cable most notably, and ending near Ashland at US 2. According to a 2013 law, the road is referred to as the &quot;Gaylord Nelson Highway&quot; throughout Wisconsin.

==History==

Though US 63 as a stand-alone highway had always ended at Turrell, Arkansas, before the 1999 extension, in the past it was concurrent with US 61/US 64/US 70/US 79 (and later I-55) on into Memphis, Tennessee, over the Memphis &amp; Arkansas Bridge. Unlike the 1999 extension, this concurrency to Memphis was generally in line with the rest of US 63. Though some maps continued to show this concurrency until 1999, Arkansas had not recognized US 63 south of Turrell for many years, since at least the 1960s.

<doc id="889234" wikidata="Q2712505" url="?curid=889234" title="Speed (TV network)">
<text>Speed was an American sports-oriented cable and satellite television network that was owned by the Fox Sports Media Group division of 21st Century Fox. The network was dedicated to motorsports programming, including auto racing, as well as automotive-focused programs.

Although the channel was based in the United States (its headquarters were located at University Research Park in Charlotte, North Carolina), Speed ceased being available to most American viewers as a standalone network with its own original programming on August 17, 2013, when it was replaced by the general-interest sports network Fox Sports 1. An &quot;international&quot; version of the network, now known as Fox Sports Racing, concurrently launched in Canada, the Caribbean and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico to replace the domestic feed, airing archived Speed programming and live simulcasts of motorsports events carried by Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2 in the United States that would be otherwise unavailable to international viewers.

When it originally launched in 1995 as Speedvision, the network carried a lineup featuring programs profiling the automobile and motorsports industries (including individual companies, vehicles and teams), how-to series, and coverage of various domestic and international racing series (such as the Formula One World Championship, Rolex Sports Car Series, and the American Le Mans Series). After it was acquired by News Corporation in 2001 and relaunched as Speed Channel, the network&#x27;s programming became increasingly NASCAR-oriented; prior to its shutdown in the U.S., Speed&#x27;s lineup consisted mostly of automotive-themed reality shows, NASCAR-related programs (including coverage of practice and qualifying sessions, and full coverage of the Truck Series and NASCAR-owned Rolex Sports Car Series), along with news programs focusing on motorsports. Most of Speed&#x27;s live event programming was carried over to Fox Sports 1 (or sister network Fox Sports 2), and was simulcasted on the Speed network that remained available outside the U.S.

Due to contractual changes associated with the relaunch, Fox was expected to temporarily distribute a version of Speed (separate from the international version) to fulfill contracts with providers that had not yet signed deals to carry Fox Sports 1, airing a loop of the network&#x27;s past reality programming. Many of the programs once found on Speed can now be found in the United States on CBS Sports Network, MAVTV and Velocity (such as &quot;Gearz&quot;, &quot;My Classic Car&quot;, &quot;Chop Cut Rebuild&quot;, and &quot;Dream Car Garage&quot; as well as live coverage of racing events), others not such as &quot;Speed Center&quot;.

==History==
===As Speedvision===
The network originally launched as Speedvision on December 31, 1995. The network was one of two (the other being the Outdoor Life Network) formed out of a partnership of Cox Cable and Times Mirror which had combined their cable systems operations in 1994. In July 1995, Times Mirror decided to reassess its media holdings and reduced its stake in the two planned networks to 10%. Comcast and Continental Cablevision were brought on as new partners.

Speedvision was planned by former ESPN executive Roger L. Werner, E. Roger Williams and Robert Scanlon. The network offered a mix of automotive, boating, and aviation programming.

Speedvision&#x27;s initial lineup featured various automotive programs, including various documentary-style series focusing on prolific vehicles, manufacturers, and racing teams (such as &quot;Victory by Design&quot; and &quot;Legends of Motorsport&quot;), series focusing on classic automobiles (such as &quot;Dream Car Garage&quot;, coverage of Barrett-Jackson&#x27;s auctions, and &quot;My Classic Car&quot;, which moved to the network from TNN), an &quot;AutoWeek&quot;-branded television series, along with &quot;MotorWeek&quot; and &quot;Autoline Detroit&quot; – two programs respectively syndicated from PBS member stations in Maryland and Detroit. Speedvision also carried coverage of various minor and professional auto racing series, including the Sports Car Club of America&#x27;s World Challenge series (of which it also acquired title sponsorship of in 1999, becoming the &quot;Speedvision World Challenge&quot;).

===Fox acquisition and NASCAR push===
In the summer of 2001, the Fox Entertainment Group (then a subsidiary of News Corporation) purchased a 30% ownership interest in Speedvision. In August of that year, Fox negotiated a deal to acquire the stakes held by Cox and Comcast, thus giving them majority control of the network. Since Fox Sports had recently acquired broadcast rights to the first half of the NASCAR Busch and Winston Cup Series in a six-year deal, Fox planned to leverage Speedvision as an outlet for supplemental NASCAR programming. To coincide with that year&#x27;s running of the Daytona 500, Speedvision was relaunched as Speed Channel on February 11, 2002; the network&#x27;s operations were also relocated from Stamford, Connecticut to Charlotte, North Carolina (where NASCAR and the majority of its teams are based).

In the following years, additional NASCAR-related programs were slowly brought on to the schedule, ranging from news programs (such as &quot;Totally NASCAR&quot;, rerun from Fox Sports Net, and &quot;NASCAR Race Hub&quot;), pre-race programs &quot;Trackside&quot; and &quot;NASCAR RaceDay&quot;, and the post-race &quot;NASCAR Victory Lane&quot;. Speed Channel also added a weekly call-in show in 2003, &quot;WindTunnel with Dave Despain&quot;, which featured interviews and discussions relating to news and events in auto racing.
Starting in 2003, Speed began to carry NASCAR&#x27;s Truck Series, after buying out the remainder of ESPN2&#x27;s contract for the events. The channel also offered coverage of practices and qualifying races in NASCAR&#x27;s main national series, the Gatorade Duels qualifying races, and the Sprint All-Star Race. In 2005, the channel&#x27;s name was shortened to simply Speed.

In 2006, the conclusion of Daytona 500 qualifying coverage was moved to Speed due to NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2006 Olympic Winter Games. The coverage still had NBC graphics and commentary. It would be the only time that the NBC/TNT broadcast combo (which aired the Daytona 500 in even-numbered years and the summer race in the odd-numbered months) would air its NASCAR coverage on SPEED.

Until late 2007, Speed also aired coverage of International Bobsleigh &amp; Skeleton Federation events over the winter months – including bobsledding, luge and skeleton. Its winter sports coverage also included an annual charity bobsledding event organized by NASCAR driver and bobsled builder Geoff Bodine, which featured participation by various NASCAR drivers. Universal Sports acquired the rights to FIBT events beginning in the 2007–08 season.

Speed continued to maintain coverage of other professional racing series, such as the Rolex Sports Car Series (including the 24 Hours of Daytona), the American Le Mans Series (along with the 24 Hours of Le Mans), the newly renamed &quot;Speed World Challenge&quot; until 2010, and the Formula One World Championship. By the mid 2000s, these came along with an increasing number of reality series (such as the street racing-inspired &quot;Pinks&quot;, &quot;Unique Whips&quot;, &quot;Chop Cut Rebuild&quot;, the drag racing game show &quot;Pass Time&quot;, &quot;American Trucker&quot;, and &quot;Hard Parts: South Bronx&quot;, along with reruns of the MTV series &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;). By 2008, Speed was carried in over 73 million households.

In 2010, Fox launched Speed 2, a TV Everywhere video streaming service which featured coverage of additional racing series not broadcast by Speed, along with video on demand access to archived Speed programs. The service was shut down in 2014.

In 2011, Speed began carrying Australia&#x27;s V8 Supercars series; it also aired live coverage of the Gold Coast 600 (where major international drivers competed in teams alongside Australian drivers) and the Bathurst 1000 featuring Darrell Waltrip, Mike Joy, Leigh Diffey, and Calvin Fish on-location. The move was met with praise from series organizers, who felt that the series could benefit from the additional exposure it would receive from American coverage—the series would also add a U.S. event at Austin&#x27;s Circuit of the Americas for the 2013 season.

On October 12, 2012, Fox Sports announced that it would not renew its contract to air Formula One racing on Speed after the conclusion of the 2012 season. Two days later, NBC Sports announced that it had reached a new four-year deal to broadcast F1 races beginning in the 2013 season, with the majority of its coverage to be carried by NBC Sports Network. Three days later, Fox Sports reached an agreement with NASCAR to extend the network&#x27;s broadcasting contract through the 2022 season (maintaining its rights to the first half of the Cup Series and the full NASCAR Truck Series), along with the addition of online streaming rights beginning in 2013.

===International expansion===
Speed became available in Canada shortly after its U.S. launch. As Speedvision, Speed was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to be added to its list of foreign cable networks approved for carriage on Canadian cable and satellite providers in 1997. As such, Speed was carried by most Canadian television service providers. Prior to August 2013, Canadian viewers saw a largely identical schedule as the U.S. channel, although some programming, particularly live Formula 1 events, were blacked out to protect TSN, which holds domestic broadcast rights to F1 events (under CRTC rules, foreign services must own Canadian broadcast rights to the content they air). However, this point became moot when NBC Sports Network obtained rights to F1 events beginning with the 2013 season, as that network is not available in Canada.

The Latin American version of Speed was launched on November 5, 2005 with a Brazilian version following in July 2006, carrying live coverage of the NASCAR Cup, Nationwide Series, and Truck Series, Rolex Sports Car Series, American Le Mans Series (including 24 Hours of Le Mans), and the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters. It also aired delayed coverage of the World Series by Renault and NASCAR Mexico. Other programming included highlights shows including British Formula Three Championship, the Argentine TC 2000 and Turismo Carretera, and the Colombian T.C. 2000 and delayed highlights of Australia&#x27;s V8 Supercars, FIA GT (airing on a few months delay), AMA Supercross and Monster Jam, as well as non-motorsport programs such as Grand Prix on Track, Grand Prix Story, Unique Whips, Tuner Mania and Pinks.

Speed launched in Australia on November 1, 2010 on Foxtel in both standard and high definition. After months of negotiations and controversy, on March 25, 2011, Speed and Speed HD launched on subscription television provider Austar. Among other racing events, the Australian network aired NASCAR Cup, Nationwide and Truck Series, V8 Supercars and Superbike World Championship with the network also having its own version of &quot;Speed News&quot;. Unlike the U.S. version, it was owned by Fox Sports Pty Limited, a subsidiary of News Corp Australia – which no longer was directly connected to 21st Century Fox due to its inclusion in the split of News Corporation.

On February 5, 2012, the Latin American channel was replaced in Brazil by a domestic version of Fox Sports. Beginning in 2012, the network broadcast Formula 1 free practices and live and delayed qualifying events and races, as well as live races from the GP2 Series and GP3 Series. On November 5, 2012, Speed Latin America was relaunched as Fox Sports 3, whose programming remained focused on motorsports the following years.

On November 2, 2014, the Australian version of Speed closed and was replaced by Fox Sports 5.

===Shutdown of Speed and relaunch as Fox Sports 1, 2 and Fox Sports Racing===

On March 5, 2013, Fox Sports announced that Speed would be shut down and replaced by a new mainstream sports channel known as Fox Sports 1; the network was to inherit Speed&#x27;s NASCAR coverage (which would be expanded under a new television deal in 2015 to add coverage of selected Sprint Cup Series and Nationwide Series events), but joined by new or recently acquired sports rights, including college basketball and football, Major League Soccer, UFC, and new studio programming. Sister channel Fuel TV was also being re-launched as a companion, Fox Sports 2.

The last program to be broadcast by Speed in the United States was a replay of qualifying for that weekend&#x27;s Sprint Cup event, the Pure Michigan 400, which was soon followed by a statement from Fox NASCAR play-by-play announcer Mike Joy marking the end of Speed&#x27;s operations in the United States:
Although Fox marketed the transition to Fox Sports 1 as a re-launch of Speed, Fox was required to re-negotiate carriage deals with providers for Fox Sports 1 due to the change of its nature of service. There was uncertainty over whether Fox Sports 1 would have sufficient carriage at launch, as it had not yet reached deals with three of the four largest pay television providers in the United States (these being DirecTV, Dish Network and Time Warner Cable) with only a month before its launch. However, all three finally agreed to terms to carry Fox Sports 1 three days before the scheduled launch. For any remaining television providers that did not reach a deal, Fox offered a &quot;watered-down&quot; version of Speed (which consisted of a loop of the network&#x27;s reality programming and no live events) to fulfill existing carriage contracts until they reached a deal to carry Fox Sports 1. In international markets such as Canada, a Speed-branded service was maintained running an automated loop of Speed&#x27;s previous non-event programming, and simulcasts of motorsports programming carried by Fox Sports 1 or 2.

Despite the channel’s shutdown, the Speed brand would be briefly used on Fox Sports’ social media platforms for coverage of AMA Supercross, the NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series, the ARCA Racing Series, IMSA, and other non-NASCAR motorsports. Some of these Speed-branded accounts were later converted for &quot;IndyCar Series on Fox&quot; use.

In Canada, as well as the Caribbean and Puerto Rico, Speed was not converted to Fox Sports 1 with the exact reasons for this not being confirmed, although in the case of Canada, it was not clear whether Fox would have had the ability to make such a change given that Speed&#x27;s Canadian authorization was based on it being a motorsports-based network with that version of Speed still being available in these areas despite its U.S. shutdown. It would continue to carry various NASCAR and other motorsports events, as well as related studio programming, mostly simulcast with their U.S. broadcasts on Fox Sports 1 or Fox Sports 2, but did not otherwise originate any new programming of its own. During hours when the network was not simulcasting FS1 or FS2 coverage, it carried repeats of past events and Speed&#x27;s previous reality and documentary programming without carrying commercial advertising: commercial breaks consist solely of promos for its programming, with no outside advertising aside from public service announcements and promotions inserted by local providers.

In early 2014, major Canadian service providers including Rogers Cable and Bell Satellite TV began to drop the service upon the expiration of their carriage contracts. Cogeco dropped the Speed Channel on July 15, 2014. Shaw later announced they would drop Speed on April 1, 2015 within their cable and satellite system (a.k.a. Shaw Cable and Shaw Direct). Reports indicate that Fox had attempted to raise the channel&#x27;s carriage fees significantly, despite the major reductions in original programming for international viewers, and Rogers suggests Fox was unwilling to allow Speed to be moved to a more specialized package in light of the programming and cost changes.

On February 19, 2015, Fox announced that the international feed of Speed would be re-branded as Fox Sports Racing, and announced that Rogers had reached a deal to add the rebranded network back to its lineup.

===Revival as a FAST channel===

On October 12, 2022, it was announced that Speed co-founder Robert Scanlon was collaborating with Rick Hendrick, Bill Goldberg and advertising industry sales executive Joe Abruzzese to revive the Speedvision brand as a linear channel on FAST (free ad-supported television) services. The new channel was launched on November 17, 2022 and features original and archival automotive programming on its daily schedule.

=== Speed on Fox ===
&quot;Speed on Fox&quot; was the name given for any motorsports events shown on Fox which would normally be broadcast by Speed Channel. The events included races from the NASCAR Truck Series (using NASCAR on Fox branding and graphics when aired), Formula One, and Rolex Sports Car Series. The name was first used in February 2007. Formula One was broadcast on Fox for six years and the Truck Series for eight years.

<doc id="889238" wikidata="Q2425291" url="?curid=889238" title="Cheerios">
<text>Cheerios is a brand of cereal manufactured by General Mills in the United States and Canada, consisting of pulverized oats in the shape of a solid torus. In Europe, Cheerios is marketed by Cereal Partners under the Nestlé brand; in Australia and New Zealand, Cheerios is sold as an Uncle Tobys product. It was first manufactured in 1941 as CheeriOats.

== History ==
Cheerios were introduced on May 1, 1941, as &quot;Cheerioats&quot;. The name was shortened to &quot;Cheerios&quot; in 1945, after a competing cereal manufacturer, Quaker Oats, claimed to hold the rights to use the term &quot;oats&quot;.

Cheerios&#x27; production was based upon the extrusion process invented for Kix in 1937. The oat flour process starts in Minneapolis before being shipped to factories in Iowa, Georgia, and Buffalo, New York.

On 1976, 35 years after the cereal was first introduced, &quot;Cinnamon Nut Cheerios&quot; became the first alternate variety of Cheerios to be sold in stores. Nearly 3 years later, in 1979, &quot;Honey Nut Cheerios&quot; was introduced. General Mills sold approximately 1.8 million cases of Honey Nut Cheerios in its first year.

Since their introduction, Cheerios have become a popular baby food. Generally first fed to children aged 9–12 months, Cheerios serve to help infants transition to eating solid food, as well as develop fine motor skills.

==Ingredients==
In January 2014, General Mills announced that it would halt the use of genetically modified ingredients in original Cheerios. However, General Mills notes for Original Cheerios that &quot;trace amounts of genetically modified (also known as &#x27;genetically engineered&#x27;) material may be present due to potential cross contact during manufacturing and shipping&quot;. In February 2015, the company announced that it would be making Cheerios gluten-free by removing the traces of wheat, rye, and barley that usually come into contact with the oat supply used to make Cheerios during transportation to the General Mills plant in Buffalo, New York, along Lake Erie.

In the United Kingdom, Cheerios differ somewhat from their US counterpart, being made from oats, wheat and barley, thus Cheerios in the United Kingdom are not gluten-free. Cheerios in the United States are made solely from oats and, since 2015, can be called gluten-free.

==Advertising==
Many television commercials for Cheerios have targeted children, featuring animated characters (such as a Honey bee). Bullwinkle was featured in early 1960s commercials, with the tagline at the end of the ad being &quot;Go with Cheerios!&quot; followed by Bullwinkle, usually worse for wear due to his Cheerios-inspired bravery somewhat backfiring, saying &quot;...but watch where you&#x27;re going!&quot; Hoppity Hooper was also featured in ads in the mid-1960s; General Mills was the primary sponsor of his animated program.

===Cheeri O&#x27;Leary===

This cartoon character, a cheery young girl, was seen in 1942–1943 magazine advertising and Sunday newspaper&#x27;s comics sections. These ads were multi-panel cartoons where Cheeri O&#x27;Leary interacted with entertainers of the day, including Charlotte Greenwood, Barbara Stanwyck, Dick Powell, Joan Blondell, Johnny Mack Brown, Betty Hutton, and Claudette Colbert.

===The Cheerios Kid===
Beginning in the mid-1950s and continuing through the early 1960s, &quot;The Cheerios Kid&quot; was a mainstay in Cheerios commercials. The Kid, after eating Cheerios, quickly dealt with whatever problem presented in the commercial, using oat-produced &quot;Big-G, little-o&quot; &quot;Go-power.&quot; By the late 1960s, there was a jingle called &quot;Get Yourself Go&quot; (written by Neil Diamond), which played as the two used power to solve the problem. The character was revived briefly in the late 1980s in similar commercials. In 2012, The Cheerios Kid and his sidekick Sue were revived in an internet video that showed how Cheerios &quot;can lower cholesterol.&quot; Video clips of &quot;the Kid&quot; and Sue are part of a montage included in a 2014 TV commercial, along with clips of the Honey Nut Cheerios bee&#x27;s early commercials.

===&quot;Peanuts&quot;===
In 1984 and 1985, characters from the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; were featured in many Cheerios commercials. In the commercials, the characters become tired in the middle of performing an activity (e.g. taking a dance lesson, or playing tennis), but then another character tells them that they did not have a healthy Cheerios breakfast. Then, at the end of the commercial, the character would be energized, followed by children singing &quot;You&#x27;re on your toes with Cheerios!&quot;

===Spoonfuls of Stories===
The Spoonfuls of Stories program, begun in 2002, is sponsored by Cheerios and a 50/50 joint venture of General Mills and Simon &amp; Schuster. Mini-sized versions of Simon &amp; Schuster children&#x27;s books are published within the program when the book drive occurs. The program also includes a New Author contest; winners&#x27; books are published in miniature inside boxes of Cheerios.

===Shawn Johnson===
In 2009, Olympic gold medalist and World Champion gymnast Shawn Johnson became the first athlete to have her photo featured on the front of the Cheerios box. The limited edition was distributed in the Midwestern region of the United States by the Hy-Vee grocery store chain.

===Just Checking===

In 2013, a Cheerios commercial aired, titled &quot;Just Checking,&quot; showcasing an interracial family in which a daughter asks her mother (white) if Cheerios is good for the heart, as her father (black) mentioned. The mother says the cereal is suitable according to the box which states that whole grain oats lower cholesterol. The next scene features the father waking up as a pile of Cheerios spills down his chest, which the daughter placed there having taken her father&#x27;s words literally. The commercial received unintentional notoriety due to intense backlash. This was so extreme that General Mills disabled further comments on the video. In 2014, General Mills released a Super Bowl ad titled &quot;Gracie,&quot; featuring the same family: in the commercial, the father, using Cheerios to illustrate his meaning, tells the daughter that a new baby is coming, that her mother is pregnant, and the daughter accepts this—as long as they also get a puppy—and the father agrees, while the mother looks a little surprised.

===Vortexx===
To promote the premiere of the Vortexx Saturday morning block on The CW Television Network in August 2012, special boxes of Cheerios were branded as &quot;Vortexx O&#x27;s,&quot; complete with the schedule on the back, and the wordmark plastered on one of the Vortexx promotional backgrounds. Toys were also included in the box, featuring John Cena, Iron Man, and the Pink Power Ranger.

===Good Goes Around===
In 2017, Latrell James was hired to sing a song for a new Cheerios commercial, with the refrain &quot;Good goes around and around and around.&quot;

===Murray the Brave===
In May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, it partnered with Food Banks Canada to do a tribute to food bank workers.

===Return of &quot;Cheerioats&quot; for 80th Anniversary===

Beginning in July 2021, a limited re-release of Cheerios cereal was made across North American markets by reusing the original-brand name &quot;Cheerioats&quot; instead of &quot;Cheerios.&quot; Cheerioats used the same ingredients as modern-day Cheerios but were repackaged in a throwback campaign to celebrate the 80th anniversary of Cheerios cereals being sold (1941–2021).

==2009 FDA demand==
In May 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration sent a letter to General Mills indicating that Cheerios was being sold as an unapproved new drug, due to labeling which read in part:

&lt;poem&gt;* &quot;You can Lower Your Cholesterol 4% in 6 weeks&quot;
* &quot;Did you know that in just 6 weeks Cheerios can reduce bad cholesterol by an average of 4 percent? Cheerios is ... clinically proven to lower cholesterol. A clinical study showed that eating two 1½ cup servings daily of Cheerios cereal reduced bad cholesterol when eaten as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

The FDA letter indicated that General Mills needed to change the way it marketed Cheerios or apply for federal approval to sell Cheerios as a drug. General Mills responded with a statement that the FDA had approved their claim of soluble fiber content, and that claims about lowering cholesterol had been featured on the box for two years.

In 2012, the FDA followed up with a letter approving the Cheerios labeling and declaring that the matter was moot and required no further action.

<text>Thomas Simpson Sproule (October 25, 1843 – November 10, 1917) was a Canadian parliamentarian, Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada from 1911–1915, and a member of the Canadian Senate from 1915–1917.

==Early life and education==
Sproule was born to James and Jane (née Mitchell) Sproule, farmers who had emigrated to King Township, Canada West from County of Tyrone, Ireland.

His parents moved to Grey County when he was young, and he attended public schools there before studying at University of Michigan and Victoria University in Cobourg. He left school for two years before returning to Victoria University, graduating in 1868 with a degree in medicine.

==Doctor, businessman, politician, and husband==

After his graduation, Sproule first practised medicine at Craighurst, Ontario, before he moved to Galesburg, Michigan. He moved back to Grey County, and settled in Markdale, Ontario, where in addition to his medical practice, he also opened a drug store, bought a large cattle farm, and invested in local businesses such as a flour mill and lumber yard.

He turned to politics and succeeded the retiring William Kingston Flesher as MP of Grey East in the 1878 election as a Conservative MP. He also fell in love with Flesher&#x27;s daughter, Mary Alice, and wooed her by having a beautiful Italianate house that he called Knarsboro Hall built for her in Markdale. The couple was married in 1881, and had a daughter, Lillian.

Sproule was also related to the famous NHL Toronto St. Patricks owner Harvey Sproule. Thomas Sproule&#x27;s niece was Mary Elizabeth Sproule Head, of Milton, Ontario, who along with her husband, John Head, cared for her young nephew Harvey Sproule and his sister.

Sproule was subsequently re-elected to Parliament eight times in succession. Both Sproule and his wife were dedicated teetotallers and Prohibitionists, and when Mary Alice Sproule was the hostess of her husband&#x27;s political functions, she never allowed alcohol to be served.

==Political views==
Sproule was a staunch Protestant from an Irish Unionist background. He was a member of the Orange Order, and rose to the position of &quot;Master and Sovereign.&quot; In 1906, he became &quot;President of the Imperial Grand Council of the World.&quot; The Order was noted for its anti-French and anti-Catholic views, particularly at the time.

As a Conservative MP, he was a supporter of Canadian Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, but his loyalty to Orangeism led him to differ with his party&#x27;s leadership on issues of language and religion, particularly on the Manitoba Schools Question. Sproule opposed any concession to Catholic separate schools or French-language instruction.

Following the fall of the Conservative government in the 1896 election, largely by the divisions over the school issue, he became a pronounced critic of the immigration policies of Sir Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s government. Sproule opposed the admission to Canada of non-British migrants. He supported the abolition of French-language instruction in Ontario schools, and the implementation of Regulation 17. Sproule also opposed the expansion of French-language services by the federal government.

==Speaker of the House==
Following the defeat of the Laurier government in the 1911 election, the new Conservative Prime Minister, Robert Laird Borden, nominated Sproule to the position of Speaker of the House of Commons. Because Sproule had to lead the House in prayers in both English and French, he embarked on French lessons despite being a lifelong opponent of the language.

During a thirty-six-day filibuster on the question of the government&#x27;s naval bill, Sproule lost his patience after weeks of 24-hour sessions, and became the first Speaker ever to &quot;name&quot; a member of the House for disorderly conduct.

==Illness and death==
Sproule was forced to retire from the Speakership due to ill health, and was named to the Senate of Canada in 1915. He served for two years until his death in 1917. Four years after his death, Sproule&#x27;s wife Mary Alice sold Knarsboro Hall, the house Sproule had built for her, and went to live with her daughter where she stayed until her death in 1941.

<doc id="889256" wikidata="Q726295" url="?curid=889256" title="Sondre Lerche">
<text>Sondre Lerche (; born 5 September 1982) is a Norwegian singer, songwriter, musician and actor. His discography includes ten studio albums and multiple EPs.

==Early life==
Growing up in a suburb of Bergen, Lerche was heavily influenced by 1980s pop. Lerche was fascinated by bands such as the Beatles, A-ha, the Beach Boys, and Prefab Sprout, and began formal guitar instruction at the age of eight. Not being satisfied with classical lessons, Lerche&#x27;s teacher introduced him to Brazilian music, such as bossa nova, and thus formed the foundation of Lerche&#x27;s vast array of complex melodies and chords throughout his music today. At the age of fourteen, Lerche penned his first song, &quot;Locust Girl.&quot; Lerche performed acoustic gigs at the club where his sister worked while he was still under age. Norwegian producer H.P. Gundersen &quot;discovered&quot; Lerche, and began to mentor him, exposing him to diverse music genres, including psychedelia, 1960s pop, and mainstream Brazilian music.

==Career==
Lerche met with Oslo-based manager Tatiana Penzo, leading up to a deal with Virgin Norway signed in 2000. His popularity in his home country increased steadily, and, in 2000, he recorded his debut album, &quot;Faces Down&quot;.

&quot;Faces Down&quot; was not released until 2001, after Lerche finished schooling. In the interim, he was named Best New Act at the Norwegian Grammys (Spellemannprisen) and performed locally in support of major acts such as Beth Orton. &quot;Faces Down&quot; was officially released in Norway in September 2001 and gradually throughout all of Europe. Lerche toured with various acts, including his long-time idols, a-ha, in Oslo. Autumn 2002 saw the release of &quot;Faces Down&quot; in America and Lerche&#x27;s first major tour of the United States. &quot;Faces Down&quot; was a hit in Norway and received critical praise in Norway and the United States — &quot;Rolling Stone Magazine&quot; placed it in their top 50 albums of 2002. He released the live/studio collection &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Shallow EP&quot; the following year. In 2003, he toured with another one of his musical heroes, Elvis Costello (they toured together once again in 2005).

In 2004, his second album was released, &quot;Two Way Monologue&quot;, also produced by Gundersen. The album displayed more of Lerche&#x27;s ability to span many different styles—from pop-like and upbeat tracks to more mellow or melodic tunes. It was very well received, with positive reviews in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. Devon Powers of &quot;Popmatters&quot; praised Sondre&#x27;s &quot;contagious musical sensibilities, exhilarating vigor and downright stupefying songcraft,&quot; and noted that &quot;Lerche manages to both push himself and maintain an allegiance to his ways – something artists twice his age have trouble doing.&quot;

On 27 February 2006, &quot;Duper Sessions&quot; was released. The jazz album was recorded in the fall of 2005 with his band the Faces Down and pianist Erik Halvorsen at Duper Studios in Bergen. The album reached No. 21 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart.

His February 2007 release, &quot;Phantom Punch&quot;, is a rock album with a more aggressive sound than his previous work. Lerche and the Faces Down recorded and mixed the album in Los Angeles in April and May 2006, with producer Tony Hoffer.

In September 2009, Lerche released &quot;Heartbeat Radio&quot;, to critical acclaim. While it maintained the studio polish of his groundbreaking debut, there was also a sense of musical adventure that mixed acoustic guitars with grand gestures of orchestral pop, elements of 1950s Jazz, 1960s and 1970s Brazilian psych-folk, and state-of-the-art 1980s pop masters such as Prefab Sprout, Scritti Politti and Fleetwood Mac. In his review, Mikael Wood of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;No matter what genre he&#x27;s working in – fuzzy garage rock, breezy vocal jazz, acoustic folk-pop – this young Norwegian singer-songwriter crafts catchier choruses than many musicians who’ve been working twice as long as he has.&quot; Allmusic Guide&#x27;s Tim Sendra called &quot;Heartbeat Radio&quot; Sondre&#x27;s &quot;best work to date.&quot;

In June 2011, Lerche released the self-titled &quot;Sondre Lerche&quot;, on his own Mona Records. Praised by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Stereogum&quot;, &quot;Filter&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; among others for its experimentation with contrasting musical sounds, this eponymous album contains Lerche&#x27;s most interesting arrangements and catchy songwriting to date, but also some of his most somber and introspective. In the studio, Lerche wanted to explore his new creative alliances in Williamsburg, the Brooklyn neighborhood where he&#x27;s lived on and off for the previous six years. The album was recorded – live in the studio – and mixed in a short but intense time period of three weeks. The sessions included fellow musicians – Midlake drummer McKenzie Smith, longtime producer/collaborator Kato Ådland, Dave Heilman (drummer for Regina Spektor), and co-producer, mixer, and owner of Rare Book Room Studio, Nicolas Verhnes (Spoon, Animal Collective).
Lerche celebrated his 30th birthday with the release of his first live album, &quot;Bootlegs&quot;, in 2012.

Lerche wrote and recorded &quot;Please&quot; following his divorce from Mona Fastvold. The album, known as his &quot;divorce record&quot;, was released on 23 September 2014 on Mona Records. &quot;Bad Law&quot; was released as the main single for the album in June 2014.

On 3 March 2017, Lerche released his eighth studio album, &quot;Pleasure&quot;, on the PLZ label. On 24 November that year the songs from &quot;Pleasure&quot; were also released in a stripped down solo version titled &quot;Solo Pleasure&quot;. &quot;Solo Pleasure&quot; was released digitally on 14 February 2018.

In April 2022, Lerche released a double album, &quot;Avatars of Love.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 2005, Lerche married director and actress Mona Fastvold. They divorced in 2013. Lerche was in a relationship with writer and blogger Linnéa Myhre from 2013 to 2020. His current partner is photographer Hilde Solli, as of 2023.

Lerche returned to Norway in 2020. Prior to that, he lived in Los Angeles and Brooklyn, New York, where he resided from 2005 to 2018.

Sondre Lerche is the cousin of Norwegian rapper Lars Vaular. In 2012, they collaborated on the single &quot;Øynene Lukket&quot;.

Lerche discovered a talent and joy for running in 2015 and has since completed marathons in New York, London, Berlin and Norway. His personal best time is 2:55:51 in 2020.

<text>The Shire is the largest river in Malawi. It is the only outlet of Lake Malawi and flows into the Zambezi River in Mozambique. Its length is . The upper Shire River issues from Lake Malawi and runs approximately before it enters shallow Lake Malombe. It then drains Lake Malombe and flows south through Liwonde National Park where large concentrations of hippopotamus are common along its shores. Between the towns of Matope and Chikwawa, the middle river drops approximately through a series of falls and gorges, including Kapachira Falls. Two hydroelectric dams have been built along the Shire northwest of Blantyre.

Beyond Chikwawa, the lower river turns southeast and enters the low-lying Mozambique plain. Its largest and one of its few perennial tributaries, the Ruo River, joins the Shire near the Malawian town of Chiromo. The muddy waters pass through a large stagnant area known as the Elephant Marsh before reaching the confluence with the Zambezi River south of the town of Sena, Mozambique.

In 1859, David Livingstone&#x27;s Second Zambezi expedition traveled up the Shire river.

The river&#x27;s valley is part of the East African Rift system.

<text>U.S. Route 64 (US 64) is an east–west United States highway that runs for 2,281 miles (3,672 km) from Nags Head in eastern North Carolina to just southwest of the Four Corners in northeast Arizona. The western terminus is at U.S. Route 160 in Teec Nos Pos, Arizona. The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is at NC 12 and U.S. Route 158 at Whalebone Junction, North Carolina. Major cities served along US 64&#x27;s route include Tulsa, Oklahoma, Conway, Arkansas, Memphis and Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Raleigh and Rocky Mount, North Carolina.

===Arizona===
US 64&#x27;s western terminus is Teec Nos Pos, Arizona, at US 160. From there, it runs southeast through sparse ranch land for about to the New Mexico state line.

===New Mexico===

Within New Mexico, US 64 runs through Farmington, Taos, Angel Fire, Eagle Nest, Cimarron, and Raton. As it runs through Raton, it is co-signed with U.S. Route 87. It continues through to Clayton, where US 87 is replaced by U.S. Routes 56 and 412. The three routes then run concurrently into Oklahoma.

It is one of the roads on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways. At Angel Fire, US 64 runs past the Vietnam Veterans Memorial State Park.

Although US 64 does not technically cross into Texas, the New Mexico-Texas border does reach the shoulder of US 64 outside of Clayton at .

===Oklahoma===
Heading into the Oklahoma Panhandle, the three conjoined routes pick up a fourth two miles (3 km) southwest of Boise City, as US-385 merges from the south. In Boise City, US-385 departs to the north along with U.S. 287, which replaces US-385 in the four-way concurrency on the way out of town to the east, before departing itself to the southeast two miles (3 km) outside of town. Shortly thereafter, US-56 also departs the route, heading northeast into Kansas, while US-64 and US-412 continue their journey due east toward Guymon.

Near Guymon, the route turns due south to approach the town. US-412 then heads due east, while US-64 veers from due south to northeast, joining up with US-54. These two routes remain together for about , splitting at Hooker, with US-54 continuing northeast into Kansas while US-64 again veers due east. At Turpin, US-64 turns left, running north with US-83; three miles (5 km) later, it again turns east, joining US-270 while US-83 and westbound US-270 continue north to Liberal, Kansas. to the east, US-270 departs to the south, and US-64 finally runs solo for a significant stretch save for very short concurrencies with US-283 near Rosston, US-183 through Buffalo, and US-281 in Alva.

Near Pond Creek, US-64 turns south, joined by US-60 and US-81. US-64 splits off just north of Enid, jogging through the city before rejoining US-412 on the east side of town. The two routes remain together until they meet Interstate 35, which US-64 joins briefly southbound while US-412 continues east, becoming the Cimarron Turnpike. US-64 departs I-35 at Perry, intersecting the parallel US-77 before continuing east.

On either side of Morrison the route intersects US-177 and US-412 (again) before passing through Pawnee and Cleveland. It then veers southeast, rejoining US-412 yet again to head into Tulsa.

In downtown Tulsa, the route diverges from US-412 for the final time. It briefly (and separately) is concurrent with Interstate 244 and US-75 before bearing southeast through the city while joining OK-51, intersecting Interstate 44 before briefly joining the southernmost five miles (8 km) of US-169, disjoining OK-51 running southbound on the eastern edge of the city. It then proceeds south, crossing the Creek Turnpike, then crosses the Arkansas River in Bixby before turning to the southeast.

After passing through Haskell, US-64 and US-62 meet head-on, north–south; they join and head east toward Muskogee. The routes disengage at the intersection with US-69, with US-64 bearing south out of the center of town. At Warner, the route turns eastward again, where it will run parallel to Interstate 40 for the remainder of its path through Oklahoma. It passes through Webbers Falls, Gore, Vian, Sallisaw (where it has a brief concurrence with US-59), Muldrow, and Roland before leaving the state.

===Arkansas===
The route enters Arkansas in Fort Smith and crosses the Arkansas River. The route continues following Interstate 40 through Clarksville, Russellville, and Conway, where I-40 turns south and US 64 continues east. US 64 runs with Interstate 57 along with both US 67 and US 167 near Searcy before passing through rural Eastern Arkansas fields. US 64 runs east to Marion and West Memphis, where it meets I-40 and Interstate 55 to continue east over the Mississippi River on the Memphis &amp; Arkansas Bridge to Memphis, Tennessee. A segment of US 64 in Crittenden County is also known as Military Road and is the oldest road in the state. It was surveyed for the removal of Native Tribes known of as the Trail of Tears. A historical marker in Marion notes this information.

===Tennessee===
US 64 enters Tennessee on the Memphis-Arkansas Bridge at Memphis. The route shares the bridge with Interstate 55 and U.S. Routes 61, 70, and 79. The route traverses several streets in Memphis before becoming a rural divided highway in eastern Shelby County. The highway runs directly to the east through the county seats of Tennessee&#x27;s most southern counties. US 64 then continues on past Lawrenceburg, the largest city on the Alabama state line between Memphis and Interstate 65, to Chattanooga. Then US 64 runs from Chattanooga to Cleveland, where it duplexes with US 74 to the North Carolina state line. The Tennessee Department of Transportation is currently working to expand the highway to four lanes across the state. The easternmost portion of the highway in Tennessee is the Ocoee Scenic Byway, a winding, two-lane road through the Ocoee River gorge in Polk County. The steep terrain around the highway is subject to landslides, such as the massive slide in November 2009 that closed the highway for several months.

===North Carolina===
US 64 enters North Carolina in Cherokee County, west of Murphy. The highway serves the cities of Brevard, Hendersonville, Rutherfordton, Morganton, Lenoir, Statesville, Lexington, Asheboro, Siler City, Pittsboro, Cary, Raleigh, Rocky Mount, Tarboro, Williamston, and Manteo.

The segment from Franklin to Highlands is a mountainous two-lane road limited to moderate-sized trucks. Large trucks are routed via Truck US 64 (US 23/441 and US 74) to Sylva, and Asheville.

Interstate 40 travels through Statesville on a route originally designed in 1950 as a bypass of US 64, intersecting with Interstate 77 at what was once intended to be a bypass of US 21.

Within the Raleigh city limits, US 64 follows the southern section of the Beltline. In 2006 a major section known as the Knightdale Bypass opened to ease traffic. After it was completed, US 64 became a divided freeway between Cary and Williamston, and carried at least four lanes between Asheboro and Columbia.

US 64 serves as a gateway to the Outer Banks, ending at Nags Head where it meets U.S. Route 158 and NC 12.

US 64 extends a total of 604 miles (972 km) from the state&#x27;s western border to the Outer Banks. It is the longest highway in North Carolina; a common way to express coverage of the entire state is to say, &quot;&quot;. US 64 runs through both.

==History==

U.S. Route 485 (US 485) was commissioned in 1926, looping west of US 85 between Santa Fe and Raton, New Mexico. In 1931, it became an extension of US 64. In 1959, the Arizona Department of Transportation submitted a proposal to extend US 64 west from Santa Fe, New Mexico to US 89 near Tuba City, Arizona, which was rejected. The portion south of Taos was removed in 1974, when US 64 was realigned and extended to Farmington, and became NM 68.

<text>Space Mountain is a space-themed indoor roller coaster attraction located at five of the six Disneyland-style Disney Parks. Although all five versions of the attraction are different in nature, all have a similar conical exterior façade that is a landmark for the respective park. The original Space Mountain coaster opened in 1975 at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. There are two tracks within this attraction, Alpha and Omega, which passengers can choose from. Other versions of the attraction were built at all other Disney parks except for Shanghai Disneyland.

==History==
===Walt Disney World===
The Space Mountain concept was a descendant of the first Disney &quot;mountain&quot; attraction, the Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland, which opened in 1959. The Matterhorn&#x27;s success had convinced Walt Disney that thrilling rides did have a place in his park.

WED partnered with Arrow Development Company, the same company that had helped design the Matterhorn&#x27;s roller coaster systems years before. The initial concept was to have four separate tracks, but the technology available at the time, combined with the amount of space required versus that which was available within Disneyland, made such a design impossible.

By 1969, the concept was moved to Walt Disney World. The Magic Kingdom&#x27;s Tomorrowland had the right amount of available land, and computing technology had improved significantly since the initial design phases. However, it was decided the mountain would be built outside the park, on the opposite side of the train tracks that act as the perimeter of the park. To help cover the cost of developing and building Space Mountain, Card Walker, the CEO of Walt Disney Productions, convinced RCA chairman Robert Sarnoff to sponsor the new attraction; RCA was contracted by Disney to provide the communications hardware for the Walt Disney World Resort, and their contract stated that if Disney presented an attraction of interest, RCA would provide US$10 million to support it. Space Mountain then opened on January 15, 1975.

A musical-variety episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; celebrated the opening on March 23, 1975. Starring actor Lucie Arnaz, it was the first Walt Disney World network special, the previous one being syndicated.

====Ride changes====
* When the Walt Disney World version first opened, the post-show featured new home technology created by its then-sponsor, RCA. One of the innovations was a laser disc home video system, seen playing a clip of Kurt Russell singing The Archies&#x27; hit song, &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; in a clip from &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; Haunted Mansion preview episode. Russell had also recorded &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; for his own Capitol Records LP. The RCA mascot Nipper was originally part of the ride as the iconic dog listening to a gramophone but inside of a space ship; after the end of the RCA sponsorship, Nipper was made into a robot dog.

===Disneyland===
The success of Walt Disney World&#x27;s Space Mountain prompted designers to revisit their original plan to build one for Disneyland. After two years of construction, the $20 million complex opened on May 27, 1977, including the roller coaster, 1,100-seat Space Stage, 670-seat Space Place (fast food restaurant) and Starcade.

Six of the original seven &quot;Mercury&quot; astronauts attended Space Mountain&#x27;s opening: Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, Senator John Glenn, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton. The lone exception was Gus Grissom, who had died in the Apollo 1 fire ten years earlier. Due in part to the opening of Space Mountain, the Memorial Day day attendance record was set, with 185,500 guests over the three-day period. Space Mountain at Disneyland was designed by Bill Watkins of Walt Disney Imagineering, including a tubular steel track design awarded . Due to space limitations, Disneyland&#x27;s Space Mountain consists of only one track as opposed to the Magic Kingdom&#x27;s two, and is of a completely different layout than either the latter park&#x27;s.

Space Mountain at Tokyo Disneyland opened with the park on April 15, 1983. It was the first version of Space Mountain to open concurrently with the park. From its opening in 1983 and until late 2006, Tokyo Disneyland&#x27;s Space Mountain was an almost exact clone of Disneyland&#x27;s Space Mountain. The ride was then redesigned to have a more sci-fi futuristic look to it similar to refurbished Walt Disney World version, with new effects, and a new spaceport which features a futuristic spaceship hanging from the ceiling. Like its Walt Disney World counterpart, there is no ride audio to the seats.

On April 27, 2022, The Oriental Land Company announced that the current version of the attraction will close in July 31, 2024, in order to be completely rebuilt as part of a wider redevelopment of the park&#x27;s Tomorrowland area. The new version of the attraction is expected to open in 2027.

===Disneyland Paris===
The version at Disneyland Paris opened on June 1, 1995, three years after the opening of the park. It was originally called &quot;De la Terre à la Lune&quot;, and was originally designed as a view on space travel from a Jules Verne-era perspective, based on the novel &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;. The track is significantly different from the other four, as it&#x27;s the only one to include a launch and 3 inversions (Sidewinder, Corkscrew, Horseshoe). 

The ride was praised for its unique storytelling and theme, its cutting edge visual effects, and honoring the legacy of Jules Verne. It was also the first rollercoaster to feature music synced to the ride, which allowed Walt Disney Imagineering to feature the same system on future rides, such as Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller Coaster. Furthermore, the success of the ride allowed Disneyland Paris to see its first profits, after the financial troubles the company had run through shortly after opening the park. 

It underwent modifications in 2005 and became Space Mountain: Mission 2. This journey was slightly different from the first as it took riders beyond the Moon, to the very edge of the universe. In January 2015 the ride closed for yet another refurbishment and was reopened in August 2015. The ride temporarily closed on January 8, 2017 and was replaced with &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Hyperspace Mountain on May 7.

===Hong Kong Disneyland===

Space Mountain at Hong Kong Disneyland was based on the refurbished Space Mountain at Disneyland, with a similar soundtrack and the same layout. It also featured new show elements not presented in the refurbished California version (i.e. a &quot;hyperspeed&quot; tunnel). It did not feature the Rockin&#x27; Space Mountain configuration that was featured in Disneyland&#x27;s Space Mountain in 2007.

Unlike most Space Mountains, the boarding area for the attraction is quite small. Not present is a Space Station of its two most similar counterparts at Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland. Instead, a dark queue featuring neon earth-tone colored planets along with star patterns decorate the area. Lining the walls of the station are colored neon light bars that are used for lighting and decoration.

Similar to the Disneyland Paris version of the ride, its &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;Hyperspace Mountain&quot; overlay theming, originally meant to be temporary, has become the permanent theme of the ride. The queue area has been fully refurbished with the addition of a full-sized replica X-Wing, a character meeting area as well as a grey and white &quot;Star Wars&quot; queueline theme, although some elements of the original queue have also remained intact such as the planet models and star patterns. The ride&#x27;s storyline is identical to the Disneyland Paris version.

==Ghost Galaxy==
Space Mountain: Ghost Galaxy (Traditional Chinese: 驚心動魄太空山) was a seasonal Halloween overlay of Space Mountain at Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland. It first premiered at Hong Kong Disneyland in 2007, and premiered at Disneyland on September 25, 2009, as part of the Halloween season at the parks. The latter made use of effects previously used for the Rockin&#x27; Space Mountain overlay in 2007.

Inside the space station, the planet screen at the front of the station had been changed to reflect the overlay, as well. While viewing the planet, a green &quot;storm&quot; appeared over the planet, causing interruptions to the video feed. Static appeared, then a blue screen, reminiscent of the Windows Blue Screen of Death, saying &quot;LOSS OF SIGNAL...,&quot; &quot;SEARCHING...&quot; and &quot;SIGNAL ESTABLISHED&quot;. Outside on the dome, five projections played, with several Halloween-themed color schemes appearing between these projection shows:
*The first projection showed the dome becoming a dull grey, with cracks and breaks forming on the dome. Suddenly, the dome seemed to crumble and fall into nothingness. Then, a green grid appeared at the top section of the dome, accompanied with a loud humming sound.
*The second projection showed an alien arm resembling that of the nebula ghost running, pushing against the dome from the inside.
*The third projection showed yellow scratch marks appearing on the dome.
*The fourth projection showed lightning bolts shooting up the left side of the dome, then the right, the middle, and finally the entire dome itself.
*The last projection showed the dome being turned into a bluish-purple radar, with explosions that appeared on the dome, resembling activity of the nebula ghosts.

===Ride changes===
With the refurbishments to Space Mountain, Ghost Galaxy had some significant changes.
*The soundtrack echoed the attraction
*The red lights at the top of the first lift hill were an eerie green. 
*The flashing blue light tunnel between the first and second lift hills were pitch black.
*Instead of the spinning galaxy beyond the second lift, a giant ghost nebula electrified the lift.
*Projections of otherworldly wisps could be seen before the final lift, along with the ghostly nebula.
*The ghosts popped up unexpectedly. Two places that were notorious for this were at a steep drop near the end as trains narrowly avoided being &quot;clawed&quot; by an unseen arm. The other spot was a ghostly head that popped out of the wall after the onride picture is taken when the train makes the final right turn to reenter the station.

==&quot;Star Wars&quot;: Hyperspace Mountain==
&quot;Star Wars&quot;: Hyperspace Mountain is a seasonal version of Space Mountain at Disneyland. The &quot;Star Wars&quot; themed overlay of the ride first made its debut in Disneyland on November 16, 2015 at the &quot;Season of the Force&quot; event held at the parks to celebrate the release of the new &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie, &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;. The &quot;Star Wars&quot; theming of the ride then became the permanent main attraction at both Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland. The parks will periodically re-theme Space Mountain back to Hyperspace Mountain for a select few days of the year in the instance of special events at the parks. The ride becomes &quot;Star Wars&quot; themed again with the release of every &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie since &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; and for special events held at the parks such as Disneyland After Dark: 80s Nite.

===Ride changes===
* The line queue has special &quot;Star Wars&quot; themed lore and safety videos.
* The launch tunnel includes voiceovers of pilots speaking and a projection of stars.
* The car accelerates at the end of the launch tunnel to simulate entering &quot;lightspeed&quot;.
* John Williams&#x27; music from &quot;Star Wars&quot; plays throughout the duration of the ride.
* A projection is displayed of a journey to the planet Jakku where the riders encounter TIE fighters and X-Wings.

==Rockin&#x27; Space Mountain==

Rockin&#x27; Space Mountain was a version of Space Mountain in Disneyland that was first presented as part of the &quot;Year of a Million Dreams&quot; Celebration at the parks in 2007. The ride was designed to transform from the original version of Space Mountain to this special edition at night time only. The concept was created by Disney Grad Nites which were private events not held for the general public. These special events are where they first began the concept of re-theming rides.

===Ride changes===
* The soundtrack is changed to the song &quot;Higher Ground&quot; by the Red Hot Chili Peppers
* Colored, flashing lights are along the track
* &quot;Uncle&quot; Joe Benson, a radio disc jockey from the Disney-owned 95.5 KLOS, welcomes riders

==Film==
Screenwriter Max Landis wrote a feature film based on the Space Mountain attraction, which was developed for a short time at Disney. The film was based in a 1950s &quot;Jetsons&quot;-esque retro-future. This idea of the future wouldn&#x27;t contain the internet or cell phones but would be powered by many large contraptions and robots. One key plot point of the film involved the idea of people getting sent into hyperspace and, upon their return, realizing their souls had gone missing from them and they would eventually transform into terrifying monsters. The film was ultimately scrapped.

On October 9, 2020, a new film adaptation of the ride was announced to be in development at Disney, with Joby Harold producing and writing the film alongside Tory Tunnell producing under their Safehouse Pictures banner. Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich of Rideback will also produce. Unlike the original idea, the film is described as a family adventure.

The Space Mountain building is featured as an &quot;easter egg&quot; in the Disney films &quot;Meet the Robinsons (alongside Rocket Jets)&quot; and &quot;Tomorrowland&quot;. 

On April 19, 2024, it was announced that Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec had been tapped to write a script for a &quot;Space Mountain&quot; film for Disney.

==Graphic novel==
In November 2013, Disney Publishing Worldwide revived Disney Comics as an imprint in the US with the imprint&#x27;s first publication was the &quot;Space Mountain&quot; graphic novel, its first original graphic novel, released on May 7, 2014. This book presented Space Mountain as a research station orbiting a black hole and harnessing its power to travel through time. During the course of the time travel adventure, Space Mountain takes on the form of its Parisian version in a darker timeline.

<doc id="889264" wikidata="Q6402203" url="?curid=889264" title="Khon Kaen Silk Festival">
<text>The International Silk Festival, Phi Suea tradition and Charity Fair (Thai: ), commonly known as the Khon Kaen Silk Festival is an event held in Khon Kaen, Isan, Thailand over twelve days at the end of November and the beginning of December each year.

The event is centred on promotion of the local silk industry, but includes a wide range of other activities including parades, performances of mor lam music, and mass dances featuring up to 25,000 people.

First held in 1979, the festival has undergone several name changes as it has developed and broadened its scope. While still widely referred to as the Khon Kaen Silk Festival, it is now officially known as the &quot;International Silk Festival, Phi Suea tradition and Charity Fair&quot;. Silk products from other southeast Asian countries are promoted alongside local creations. Fundraising for the Red Cross is also a focus. The Phuk Sieo ceremony sees senior people tying symbolic threads on the wrists of younger participants, as a mark of mutual support and social cohesion.

<doc id="889271" wikidata="Q410041" url="?curid=889271" title="U.S. Route 68">
<text>U.S. Route 68 (US 68) is a United States highway that runs for from northwest Ohio to Western Kentucky. The highway&#x27;s western terminus is at US 62 in Reidland, Kentucky. Its present eastern terminus is at Interstate 75 in Findlay, Ohio, though the route once extended as far north as Toledo. US 68 intersects with US 62 three times during its route.

==Route description==

US 68 is signed east–west in Kentucky, while in Ohio it is signed north–south.

===Kentucky===
U.S. Route 68 is designated as a &quot;Scenic Highway&quot; throughout Kentucky. US 68 passes near or through Reidland, Aurora, Cadiz, Hopkinsville, Elkton, Russellville, Auburn, Bowling Green, Glasgow, Edmonton, Greensburg, Campbellsville, Lebanon, Perryville, Harrodsburg, Lexington, Paris, and Maysville.

The majority of the route winds through forested, hilly terrain. US 68 is Broadway through downtown Lexington, and it is Harrodsburg Road before it leaves Lexington.

The route passes several Civil War battle sites. The Jefferson Davis State Historic Site is located along the highway, approximately east of Hopkinsville at the small town of Fairview. The Battle of Tebbs Bend Historic Civil War Site is located near Campbellsville and the Perryville Battlefield State Historic Site is outside Perryville.

There is an annual yard sale, held along the highway for four days in early summer.

The sections of the highway through Campbellsville and Lebanon are slated for expansion to begin in 2008. The long-term goal is to widen and make safer the entire US 68 corridor through Kentucky as part of the Heartland Parkway project.

Sections in Kentucky have been improved in recent years. The Paris Pike was completed in 2003. Work is currently in progress to make US 68 four lanes through Land Between the Lakes. This was accelerated, following a devastating collision of the cargo vessel MV &quot;Delta Mariner&quot; with Eggner Ferry Bridge in January 2012.

===Ohio===

US 68 takes a south–north route throughout Ohio, roughly paralleling Interstate 75 but covering counties one tier to the east of those counties covered by I-75. US 68 begins at the William H. Harsha Bridge over the Ohio River and is immediately concurrent with US 52 and US 62 for while traveling on the north bank of the river. US 52 leaves the concurrency at Ripley, at which point US 68 and US 62 head north for as a generally rural two-lane highway. In Brown County&#x27;s Jefferson Township, near Redoak, US 62 leaves the concurrency. Afterward, US 68 passes through or bypasses communities such as Georgetown, Mount Orab, Fayetteville, Wilmington, Xenia, and Yellow Springs. Shortly before reaching Interstate 70, it becomes a four-lane expressway, bypassing Springfield before transitioning back to a rural two-lane road as it approaches Urbana. As it continues north, US 68 passes through West Liberty, Bellefontaine, Kenton, Dunkirk, and Arlington on its way north to its terminus at an interchange with Interstate 75 outside Findlay.

Near Redoak in Brown County, the designation &quot;Brigadier General Charles Young Memorial Historical Corridor&quot; leaves the US 62/US 68 concurrency and joins US 68 solely at the routes&#x27; junction. The designation is in honor of Young, a pioneering figure in US history, and at his death, the highest-ranking Black officer in the Regular Army. The memorial historical corridor stretches northward to Xenia, where it leaves US 68 and joins US 42 at the junction of those routes.

In total, US 68 traverses 179.1 miles within Ohio.

==History==
===Original route in central Kentucky===

From 1926 until the late 1940s, in terms of the routing between Bowling Green and Perryville, US 68&#x27;s concurrency with US 31W went further northeast through southeastern Edmonson and northwestern Barren counties to Horse Cave, in Hart County. US 68 then followed the present-day Kentucky Route 218 (Charlie Moran Highway) to the US 31E junction at Wigwam, and then joined US 31E northward through LaRue and Nelson counties to Bardstown, where it joined US 150 for a concurrency that lasted through Washington County until it went solo in Perryville. US 68 moved to its current routing between Bowling Green and Perryville (except for the later rerouting onto Glasgow&#x27;s Veterans Outer Loop) around 1948–49.

===Original alignment in northwestern Ohio===
US 68 previously ran to Toledo, Ohio, terminating at the west approach to the Anthony Wayne Bridge south of downtown, but the Toledo-Findlay segment was decommissioned in the 1950s. It also passed through Springfield, Ohio prior to its realignment onto a four-lane bypass of that city.

===Widening project in western Kentucky (1990s)===
For much of the 1990s, much of the US 68/KY 80 corridor from the I-24 junction near Cadiz to the Natcher Parkway (now I-165) junction in Bowling Green was under construction for a regional construction project to widen the corridor to four lanes, with several alignments remaining intact, especially around small towns such as Fairview and Auburn. The project included bypass routes in Hopkinsville and Russellville. 

===Eggner Ferry Bridge incident (2012)===
Two spans of the US 68/KY 80 Eggner Ferry Bridge over Kentucky Lake collapsed after being struck by a cargo ship on January 26, 2012. The bridge reopened to traffic on May 25, 2012. That bridge was replaced by a new four-lane bridge a few years afterwards.

===Ohio roundabout===
In summer 2020, ODOT made plans to convert the intersection with SR 235, the state route&#x27;s southern terminus, to a roundabout, near Oldtown in Xenia Township, Greene County, Ohio, almost north of downtown Xenia. Construction was expected to begin in spring 2023 and to be completed that fall, with an estimated cost of $2 million. However, site preparations did not begin until early June 2024, and it was announced that construction would begin on July 16, at a cost of $2.29 million, to be completed by the fall. On December 3, 2024, the roundabout was substantially completed except for minor finish work such as landscaping, which is scheduled to be done in spring 2025.

==Future==
In Springfield Township, Clark County, Ohio, there is an almost full-access interchange between controlled-access US 68 and US 40/SR 4, which is itself a controlled-access highway until approximately 0.3-mile west of the US 68 interchange. One exit ramp from US 68 ends on Upper Valley Pike, rather than on US 40/SR 4; another entrance ramp includes two-way traffic and an at-grade entrance to a retirement community. On US 40/SR 4 between the controlled-access portion and US 68, there are an at-grade intersection at Upper Valley Pike, other street and driveway breaks in access control and a steep grade on the eastbound approach toward Upper Valley Pike. In September 2013, the Clark County-Springfield Transportation Coordinating Committee (TCC) ranked the US 40/SR 4/Upper Valley Pike intersection as the most hazardous in the county, based on 2010-2012 crash data. Because the road design over the years had played a significant factor in the high number of crashes in the area, the TCC conducted a study; in February 2006 it recommended reconfiguring the US 68 interchange and altering nearby traffic patterns. The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) the same year approved $5 million to fund the project. However, the TCC soon rejected ODOT&#x27;s money, concluding that even its recommended fix would not be enough to solve the area road network&#x27;s underlying problems. Instead, the TCC is making small changes, such as improving traffic signal timing and adding signs. ODOT, for its part, is working on reducing the number of driveways near the US 40/SR 4/Upper Valley Pike intersection and on upgrading traffic signals.

On December 7, 2023, ODOT announced that it would provide a $2.6 million grant to construct a single-lane roundabout at Fairfield Pike in Springfield Township, Clark County, Ohio, on the border with Springfield, in 2028.

<text>Ronald Tree (born 8 April 1963 in Leeds, England) is an English musician and songwriter, best known as frontman and bassist for the English space rock band Hawkwind from 1995 to 2002. He also played both these roles in the reunited Steve Took&#x27;s Horns in 2002, taking the place of Steve Peregrin Took. He later became the vocalist/songwriter in the Hawklords, alongside Jerry Richards, Harvey Bainbridge, Dave Pearce and Tom Ashurst.

==History==
Prior to joining Hawkwind, Tree played with 2000DS, Plato&#x27;s Jacuzzi, Captain Jesus and the Sunray Dream (who released two limited-edition &quot;private press&quot; LPs), and his own band, Bastard. He contributed vocals and bass to Bajina in 2000, with Dino Ferari (drums) and Judge Trev Thoms (lead guitar). Also with Ferari and Thoms, he recorded two new tracks for the Steve Took&#x27;s Horns album, &quot;Blow It!!!&quot;, built around a session of three tracks recorded 29 November 1977 at Pathway Studios, London, by Took with Ferari and Thoms; that album was released on 10 August 2004. After these musical excursions he contributed vocals and bass for Thoms (lead guitar and vocals), Jim Hawkman (synthesizer), and John Morgan (drums) with the Mother Of All Bands (M.O.A.B.).

Since then, amongst other various musical projects, he has played with the Leeds-based band The Sewer Suckers, who supported bands such as My Older Ego in his home town. Hawklords have annually released an album, namely; &quot;We Are One&quot; (2012), &quot;Dream&quot; (2013), &quot;Censored&quot; (2014), &quot;Re:volution&quot; (2015), &quot;Fusion&quot; (2016) and &quot;Six&quot; (2017); although Tree did not appear on the latter.

<text>Louis-Philippe Brodeur, baptised Louis-Joseph-Alexandre Brodeur (August 21, 1862 – January 2, 1924) was a Canadian journalist, lawyer, politician, federal Cabinet minister, Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, and puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

== Life and career ==
Born in Belœil, Quebec, he was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1891 election as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Rouville, Quebec. He represented the riding continuously until his retirement prior to the 1911 election.

Brodeur was a firm supporter of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and came from a &quot;Rouges&quot; family. His father fought in the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837, and his maternal grandfather was killed in the Rebellion&#x27;s Battle of Saint-Charles.

As a young man, Brodeur studied law, graduating in 1884 with an LL.B. from the Université Laval in Montréal. He worked as a young lawyer with Honoré Mercier, before establishing his own law firm of Dandurand and Brodeuer with Raoul Dandurand. He also engaged in journalism for Liberal newspapers such as &quot;la Patrie&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Électeur&quot; before becoming editor of &quot;Le Soir&quot;. He was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons at the age of 29. After the Liberals won the 1896 election, Brodeur was appointed deputy speaker. He was appointed as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1899. He became Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada following the 1900 election.
In 1904, he was appointed to the Laurier Cabinet as Minister of Inland Revenue where he introduced antitrust legislation to protect tobacco farmers from the monopolistic practices of the American Tobacco Company.

In 1906, he was promoted to Minister of Marine and Fisheries and reorganized the Montreal Harbours Commission and instituted reforms in the department to reduce patronage and corruption.

Brodeur was a member of the Canadian delegation to the 1907 Imperial Conference in London, and also helped negotiate a trade treaty with France.

In 1910, he became Minister of the Naval Service and was responsible for introducing legislation to create the Canadian Navy. This signified a move towards Canadian independence from Britain. It was opposed by the Conservative Party, which preferred Canada&#x27;s participation in the Royal Navy. By the end of his term, the new Navy consisted of 233 sailors and two cruisers, one on each coast. The policy of creating a Canadian Navy was also opposed by French-Canadian nationalists such as Henri Bourassa who feared that the Canadian Navy would only be used as a device to engage Canada in British wars.

=== Supreme Court of Canada ===
Prior to the 1911 election, Brodeur retired from politics and was appointed by Laurier to a seat on the Supreme Court of Canada. He retired from the court in 1923 to accept an appointment as the 13th Lieutenant Governor of Quebec. Brodeur died on 2 January 1924, at the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s official residence of Spencer Wood in Sillery.

==Family==

Louis-Philippe Brodeur married Emma Brillon, daughter of J. R. (Joseph-Régnier) Brillon, of Belœil, P.Q.,
in June 1887. Their son, Victor, attained the rank of Rear Admiral in the Royal Canadian Navy. The École Victor-Brodeur in Esquimalt, British Columbia, is named after him. Victor&#x27;s son Nigel attained the rank of Vice Admiral.

== Archives ==
There are Louis-Philippe Brodeur fonds at Library and Archives Canada and Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec.

== Electoral record ==

<text>U.S. Route 70 or U.S. Highway 70 (US 70) is an east–west United States highway that runs for from eastern North Carolina to east-central Arizona. It is a major east–west highway of the Southeastern, Southern and Southwestern United States. Established as one of the original highways of 1926, it originally ran only to Holbrook, Arizona, then was extended in 1934 as a coast to coast route, with the current eastern terminus near the Atlantic Ocean in Atlantic, North Carolina, and the former western terminus near the Pacific Ocean in Los Angeles, California. The current western terminus was then truncated to US 60 / SR 77 in Globe, Arizona. Before the completion of the Interstate system, U.S. Highway 70 was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Broadway of America&quot;, due to its status as one of the main east–west thoroughfares in the nation. It was also promoted as the &quot;Treasure Trail&quot; by the U.S. Highway 70 Association as of 1951.

In the early years, US 70 had a different route between Clovis, New Mexico and eastern Arizona, taking the route of current US 60 and US 180 to an endpoint in Holbrook. US 70 was later re-routed to El Paso, Texas, when US 60 was extended to California. US 70 was later re-routed again west of Alamogordo, New Mexico along its current route to Globe, as well as being concurrent with US 60 to a common terminus in Los Angeles, California.

===Arizona===
U.S. 70 begins in Globe at a junction with U.S. Route 60, concurrent with State Route 77. SR 77 splits off east of town. U.S. 70 then enters the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation and runs southeast for 17 miles (27 km) to Peridot, where it crosses Indian Route 9. It has no other highway junctions until Safford, where it begins a ten-mile (16 km) overlap with U.S. 191. U.S. 70 then runs an additional . (59 km) before crossing into New Mexico east of Franklin.

===New Mexico===

After entering the state of New Mexico, U.S. 70 heads southeast. Five miles (8 km) after crossing the state line, it serves as the southern terminus for New Mexico State Road 92. U.S. 70 does not have another highway junction for 21 mi (34 km), where it meets State Roads 464 and 90 three miles (5 km) north of Lordsburg. At Lordsburg, U.S. 70 joins with Interstate 10 eastbound, splitting off in Las Cruces, and becoming Picacho Avenue in Las Cruces. When Picacho Avenue meets Main Street, US 70 follows Main Street northbound. U.S. 70 then crosses Interstate 25, and has been upgraded at this point to a controlled access highway until entering the foothills of the Organ Mountains.

As a divided highway, U.S. 70 then crosses the Organ Mountains via San Augustin Pass, descends to the valley floor of the Tularosa Basin, and next crosses the White Sands Missile Range. Overhead missile tests can close the highway for a few hours; this generally happens once or twice a week, and typically only for an hour at a time. The road then passes the entrance to White Sands National Park, and shortly after that passes the southern end of Holloman Air Force Base. It then turns northbound, and picks up a concurrency with U.S. 54 upon entering Alamogordo. On the north end of Alamogordo, US54/US70 intersects the beginning of U.S. Route 82 near La Luz. The concurrency with US 54 lasts until Tularosa, and the highway remains divided until US 70 and US 54 diverge. After splitting off to the northeast, U.S. 70 begins an ascent into the Sacramento Mountains and enters the Lincoln National Forest. The road then runs across the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation and near the resort town of Ruidoso. In Hondo, it begins another concurrency, this time with U.S. 380. U.S. 70 then bypasses Roswell to the northwest, together with U.S. 285. U.S. 70 then heads off to the northeast, running through Portales and Clovis before entering Texas at Texico.
From mile 170.6 to mile 197.25 on US 70 the speed limit is posted at 75 mph (120 km/h) across White Sands Missile Range. (26.6-mile stretch) just slightly longer than a standard marathon. US 70 is one of only two non-interstate roadways in New Mexico to receive a speed limit of 75 miles per hour (U.S. 285 between Roswell and Vaughn is also posted at 75 miles per hour).

===Texas===

U.S. 70 enters Texas joins with U.S. 60 and U.S. 84. U.S. 60 splits off to the northeast in Farwell, just over the state line. U.S. 70/84 then angle southeast to Muleshoe, where the two routes split. U.S. 70 heads due east, meeting U.S. 385 at Springlake, and having an interchange with Interstate 27 in Plainview. U.S. 70 then arcs toward the south to begin a concurrency with US 62 in Floydada. The two routes head east to Paducah, where US 62 splits off to the north to join with U.S. 83. U.S. 70 then proceeds to Vernon, where it overlaps U.S. 287 and U.S. 183 (and has a junction with U.S. 283). Near Oklaunion, U.S. 70/183 split off to the north to cross the Red River into Oklahoma. The route through Texas was cosigned with Texas State Highway 28 before 1939. SH 28 was designated in 1919 as a route from Muleshoe to Olney with a spur, SH 28A, from SH 28 at Crowell east to the Oklahoma border. In 1922, the route split in Benjamin, going south to Sagerton and east to Olney. In 1926, The portion from Crowell to Sagerton became SH 51, while the portion from Benjamin to Olney became SH 24. SH 28 was instead rerouted over SH 28A to end at the Oklahoma border. By 1939, the route was cancelled due to US 70.

===Oklahoma===

U.S. 183 splits away from U.S. 70 north of the state line, in the town of Davidson. It then has an interchange (Exit 5) with I-44, serving as the southern terminus of the H.E. Bailey Turnpike, west of the town of Randlett. U.S. 70 then passes south of Waurika. U.S. 70 then becomes a four-lane divided highway near Wilson and runs through Lone Grove before entering the city of Ardmore, where it briefly heads south on Interstate 35, bypassing the central business district. US-70 serves as the southern terminus of U.S. 177 in Madill. U.S. 70 then heads to Durant, where it has an interchange with the U.S. 69/75 freeway.

East of Soper, U.S.70 joins with U.S.271. The two routes then approach Hugo, where they serve as the southern terminus of the Indian Nation Turnpike. U.S. 271 also splits off at this interchange, continuing the freeway southbound from the turnpike. U.S. 70 then heads through downtown Hugo. It then bypasses Idabel to the north (with Bypass U.S. 70 providing a western and southern bypass). It then meets U.S. 259 and State Highway 3 northeast of town and overlaps them into Broken Bow, forming a wrong-way concurrency with SH-3. U.S. 70 then splits off to the east in Broken Bow before leaving the state.

===Arkansas===

U.S. 70 enters Arkansas eight miles (13 km) west of De Queen, and crosses through the north part of the town where it meets the combined U.S. 71/U.S. 59 and overlaps with it for . It then heads northeast to Dierks, where it begins a concurrency with U.S. 278. U.S. 70 then heads east-northeast to Hot Springs, which it bypasses to the south on a freeway alignment shared with U.S. 270. U.S. 70 then heads east to join with Interstate 30 at Exit 111 south of Benton. The two highways run concurrently to the state capital, Little Rock, where U.S. 70 splits off from I-30 at Interstate 430 at Exit 129. U.S. 70 follows Interstate Highway 430 for 1 mile to Exit 1 (Stagecoach Road), where it overlaps Arkansas Highway 5 heading northeast into Little Rock, becoming Colonel Glenn Rd at the intersection with Arkansas Highway 300. Continuing northeast through Little Rock, U.S. 70 turns east again at Roosevelt Road, before turning north through downtown Little Rock as Broadway Street, with during which it crosses Interstate 630 before crossing the Arkansas River into North Little Rock. It then crosses Interstate Highway 30, and serves as the northern terminus of U.S. Route 165. U.S. 70 then crosses Interstate 440 and leaves the Little Rock area, paralleled by I-40.

U.S. 70 continues its alignment near I-40 throughout eastern Arkansas, generally about two or three miles (5 km) apart. I-40 bypasses Forrest City to the north, while U.S. 70 serves the city center. The two routes remain close through West Memphis, Arkansas, where U.S. 70 runs along Broadway Blvd. Finally, U.S. 70 joins with I-55 to cross the Mississippi River into Tennessee.
===Tennessee===
US 70 enters Tennessee, as well as the city of Memphis, concurrent with Interstate 55, US 61, US 64, and US 79. At exit 12, the northernmost exit on I-55 in the state, I-55 turns south; however, the four US routes continue east onto the at-grade Crump Boulevard. US 61 splits from the concurrency soon afterward, heading south along 3rd Street to exit the city for Walls, Mississippi and points south. US 64, 70 and 79, however, remain overlapped through downtown Memphis, following Danny Thomas Boulevard north to Union Avenue, Union east to East Parkway (briefly overlapping with U.S. Route 51 along the western portion of Union), then East Parkway north to Summer Avenue, where the triple concurrency turns east. Near the city line, US 64/70/79 interchanges with Interstate 40 at exit 12A.

Past the Memphis city limits in the suburb of Bartlett, U.S. 64 separates from U.S. 70/79, taking a more southerly routing through the state. U.S. 70 and US 79, meanwhile, head to the northeast, paralleling I-40 to Brownsville. East of the city, U.S. 79 breaks from U.S. 70, following U.S. 70 Alternate out of the city to the northeast. U.S. 70, now concurrent with only its unsigned designation of State Route 1, heads east, interchanging with I-40 at exit 66 before entering Jackson. The route continues northeastward from the city, meeting I-40 once more at exit 87 just outside the city limits. At Huntingdon, U.S. 70 Alternate rejoins US 70 as the main route turns to the east toward New Johnsonville, where it crosses the Tennessee River.

From the river, U.S. 70 continues eastward through Waverly and Dickson to the Nashville area. Southwest of the city near Pegram, U.S. Route 70S splits off from U.S. 70; however, U.S. 70 now continues to be signed as U.S. 70 instead of U.S. 70N, as it was formerly. U.S. 70 follows I-40 into Nashville, meeting the concurrent I-40/I-65 immediately west of the city center. The route turns south, acting as collector/distributor roads for I-40/I-65 for two blocks before joining U.S. 431 and U.S. 70S on a brief overlap. At an intersection with the concurrent U.S. 31/U.S. 41, U.S. 431 and U.S. 70S split from U.S. 70. U.S. 70 progresses eastward, roughly paralleling the Cumberland River to an interchange with State Route 155 east of downtown. U.S. 70, now paired with State Route 24, heads east out of Nashville to Lebanon, where U.S. Route 70N breaks from the main US 70. US 70 heads southeast, passing through Smithville before rejoining U.S. 70S in Sparta and U.S. 70N to the east in Crossville.

From Crossville eastward to the North Carolina state line, U.S. 70 closely parallels I-40, passing through the Roane County cities of Rockwood and Kingston. At Dixie Lee Junction in eastern Loudon County U.S. 70 intersects U.S. 11 (also known as the Lee Highway), and the two highways are concurrent from the junction intersection eastward through Farragut and into Knoxville. In Farragut and west of downtown Knoxville U.S. 70 carries the name Kingston Pike. Neyland Drive carries U.S. 70 along the Tennessee River to a junction with Hall of Fame Drive. On the east side of Knoxville it becomes concurrent with U.S. 25W and U.S. 11E and carries the name Asheville Highway from Knoxville to the community of Trentville in eastern Knox County. At Trentville, U.S. 11E separates from the concurrency. U.S. 25W remains overlapped with U.S. 70 to Newport, where U.S. 70 is joined by U.S. 25E, which becomes US 25. U.S. 25 and U.S. 70 remain concurrent into North Carolina.

===North Carolina===

US 70 enters North Carolina as a two-lane road in concurrency with US 25. Going southeast, it widens to four-lane near Marshall, merging farther down with I-26/US 19/US 23 going into Asheville. In the downtown area, it breaks from the US 19/23 freeway onto city streets and through Beaucatcher Tunnel as it goes east; paralleling north of I-40, going through the cities Marion, Morganton, Hickory, Conover and Statesville. From there, it goes southeast to Salisbury, where it starts to parallel I-85 north through Lexington, Thomasville, High Point and Greensboro, in concurrency with I-85 Bus/US 29.

US 70 passes through Greensboro in concurrency with Interstate 40, Interstate 85 Business, then US Routes 29 and 220 briefly, then heads east through the Wendover Avenue expressway, which takes the route out of town towards Burlington. It downgrades to a two lane rural road heading out of Greensboro, and again parallels north of I-40/I-85. Entering Alamance County, it expands to a four-lane expressway through the city of Burlington, then returns to 2 lanes through Mebane, Efland and Hillsborough. It joins I-85 briefly in Eno, then veers southeast through the downtown areas of both Durham and Raleigh.

After a brief overlap with I-40 near Garner, it continues in a southeasterly direction, briefly concurrent with Interstate 42, as it goes through or bypasses the cities of Clayton, Smithfield, Selma, Goldsboro and Kinston. Near and through New Bern, US 70 briefly becomes a freeway but returns to expressway grade as it goes through Havelock. After passing through Morehead City and Beaufort, it drops back to a two-lane rural road as it travels close along the Core Sound. After passing the southern terminus of NC 12 (which connects to the Outer Banks), near Sealevel, US 70 ends its seven state tour in the community of Atlantic.

==History==
Most or all of the present route designated as U.S. Route 70 (or U.S. Highway 70 depending on the state) was earlier known as Lee Highway. During the earliest days of the automobile, and earlier, American highways were disorganized affairs of widely varying quality. Highways were known by a bewildering variety of names which typically changed at each town. And they were only named, not numbered.

During the 1910s the first national highway was conceived: the Lincoln Highway, named in honor of Abraham Lincoln, stretching across the northern United States from coast to coast. A companion effort was launched to create a transcontinental highway stretching across the southern half of the country, this one named in honor of Confederate States of America general Robert E. Lee. The two highways were a revolution of sorts, in that a driver could follow a single road from coast to coast bearing the same designation. Much of today&#x27;s U.S. 70 was formerly the Lee Highway, although that was later removed.
When originally commissioned on 11 November 1926, U.S. Route 70 ran between Beaufort, North Carolina and U.S. Route 66 in Holbrook, Arizona. This older route ran from present day US 70 in Clovis, New Mexico through Vaughn, Willard (where former child route U.S. Route 470 branched off to Albuquerque) and Springerville, Arizona before finally reaching US 66 in Holbrook. In 1932, US 70 was rerouted to El Paso, Texas from Clovis along what is today U.S. Route 54. The re-routing temporarily removed US 70 entirely from Arizona. The old route to Holbrook was replaced by U.S. Route 60 and U.S. Route 260. That same year, the eastern terminus of US 70 was extended to Atlantic, North Carolina, where it remains to this day (albeit in a slightly different location). In 1934, the routing was changed yet again and US 70 was rerouted to California through Las Cruces, New Mexico, Deming, Globe, Arizona and Phoenix to a junction with U.S. Route 99 around Mecca. Between Globe and its new western end in California, US 70 was paired with US 60. A year later, US 70 was extended along Valley Boulevard and reached downtown Los Angeles at U.S. Route 101 running concurrent with US 99 and/or US 60 throughout its course west of Globe. Beginning in 1964 it was decommissioned in favor of Interstate 10 or US 60. After being removed from California, US 70 ended at the California/Arizona state line in Ehrenberg until 1969, when it was further truncated to its current endpoint in Globe. US 70, unlike many other decommissioned US Highways in California, doesn&#x27;t have a state route that was numbered after it and taking over its path (unlike US 60, which had State Route 60 to replace it), due to the fact that it was replaced in its entirety by I-10. Therefore, the current State Route 70 bears no relation to this highway.

Robert Mitchum and Don Raye&#x27;s song, &quot;The Ballad of Thunder Road&quot; immortalized in the 1958 film of the same name, follows a family of anarchistic moonshiners who engage in run-ins with the police. The Mitchum film is based on a real life incident in which a moonshiner perishes on the road on the Kingston Pike stretch of Highway 70 in Knoxville while on the run from the police, although the actual filming did not take place on Highway 70.

===Historic alignments===
Old and bypassed sections of US 70 exist, and at least one such road section has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is located in Lonoke County, Arkansas, between Young Road and point east of the present US 70&#x27;s junction with Arkansas Highway 15. About long, it runs mostly parallel to, and just north of, the present alignment, jogging a bit farther around the AR 15 junction. It was built about 1913, and some of its original bituminous pavement survives. It was replaced by the present alignment in 1930–31. Between Florence, Arizona and Wickenburg, Arizona, US 70 ran concurrently with both US 60 and US 89.

==Special routes==
===Branch routes===
In Tennessee, US-70 has two additional branches: US-70N and US-70S. This split is unique, in that it is the only existing instance of a N/S split of a U.S. Route (all the others are E/W splits). Furthermore, US-70 does not &quot;disappear&quot; at these splits; thus, these two highways both co-exist with the main route and serve as additional branches. US-70N begins in Lebanon, just east of Nashville, and ends in Crossville; US-70S begins in the Bellevue neighborhood of southwest Nashville, and ends in Sparta (a few miles west of Crossville). Historically, both split routes began in Pegram and ended in Crossville. The original designation for US-70 between Lebanon and Sparta was state route 26.

<text>U.S. Route 72 (US 72) is an east–west United States highway that travels for from southwestern Tennessee, throughout North Mississippi, North Alabama, and southeastern Tennessee. The highway&#x27;s western terminus is in Memphis, Tennessee and its eastern terminus is in Chattanooga. It is the only U.S. Highway to begin and end in the same state, yet pass through other states in between. Prior to the U.S. Highway system signage being posted in 1926, the entire route was part of the Lee Highway.

==Route description==
The highway passes through Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. Most of the original eastern and western portions of the route through roughly follows the path of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, a railroad that predated the American Civil War and now operated by Norfolk Southern Railway as their Memphis-Chattanooga, Tennessee mainline. US 72 Alt. follows the Memphis and Charleston route through North Alabama.

===West Tennessee===
US 72 begins at Bellevue Boulevard (US 51) in Memphis. From Memphis, the route follows Union Avenue and Poplar Avenue into Collierville. Just south of Collierville, US 72 junctions State Route 385 (the Bill Morris Parkway), a freeway which links Collierville with I-240. The route enters Mississippi southeast of SR 385. This segment of the highway is concurrently designated State Route 86 (SR 86) south of its concurrency with SR 57 between Union Avenue in Memphis and Collierville.

===Mississippi===
US 72 enters Mississippi in western Marshall County. The route follows rolling hills across the extreme northern part of the state, passing through Walnut and Corinth as it heads east. Near Burnsville, US 72 crosses the Divide Cut of the Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway. Farther east, the route enters the Tennessee Valley and heads through Iuka before crossing into Alabama.

All of US 72 in Mississippi has been widened to four-lane highway, with the last two lane section between MS 302 and the Tennessee state line being completed in 2019. Legally, the Mississippi section of US 72 is defined in the Mississippi Code §65-3-3.
===Alabama===
US 72 enters Alabama just west of Cherokee. The route parallels the Tennessee River east to Muscle Shoals, where US 72 Alternate splits from US 72. The mainline turns north, passing through Muscle Shoals and crossing the Tennessee River, entering Florence on the opposite bank. From Florence to Huntsville, the route heads through areas dominated by farmland. Between the two locales, however, US 72 enters Athens.

After passing through Athens and an overpass with Interstate 65 (I-65), US 72 approaches Huntsville from the west. Part of this section has the local name University Drive. At an interchange with Memorial Parkway, the route turns northward briefly, joining the routes of US 231 and US 431, until it breaks off from the Parkway and heads eastward again. (This part is known to locals as &quot;72 East&quot; because it is east of the Parkway; it has no other name.) Northeast of downtown Huntsville, US 72 interchanges with I-565. I-565/US 72 Alt., part of Corridor V of the Appalachian Development Highway System, terminates at the interchange while US 72 takes over the freeway alignment, joining Corridor V.

I-565 is mentioned as the eastbound route and SR 20 is mentioned as the westbound route. Signs for I-565 east at this interchange recently were changed to remove any mention of SR 20 east. Most of the US 72 portion of Corridor V is a four-lane divided expressway with at-grade intersections. Past Huntsville, US 72 follows several mountain valleys to Scottsboro. From Scottsboro, the route follows a northeasterly routing similar to that of the Tennessee River as it enters Tennessee for the second time.

All of US 72 within Alabama is four lanes in width. Additionally, much of US 72 has been built through northeast Alabama with interchanges at the major state highways. Just west of Moores Mill Road in Huntsville, US 72 becomes limited access over Chapman Mountain. Throughout Alabama, US 72 is paired with unsigned State Route 2 (SR 2).

The stretch of US 72 paralleling I-59 to the far northeast in between Scottsboro and South Pittsburg contains multiple freeway-style Interchanges.

===East Tennessee===
US 72 enters Tennessee for the second time just south of South Pittsburg. At South Pittsburg, Corridor V ends at an interchange with Interstate 24. US 64, concurrent with I-24 west of the exit, departs the expressway and forms an overlap with US 72 through Kimball to Jasper, where US 41 joins the concurrency. Just east of Jasper, the highways cross the Tennessee River on Nickajack Lake. The route then follows a cut in the Cumberland Plateau made by the Tennessee River to the western outskirts of Chattanooga, where it interchanges with I-24 once more. Just east of the interchange, US 11 joins the overlap.

Together, US 11, US 41, US 64, and US 72 follow the bluffs on Lookout Mountain above the Tennessee River to Chattanooga, where the routes follow Broad Street north into downtown. At the corner of Main Street and Broad Street, US 72 comes to an end; US 76 begins at the intersection, making one highway in essence a continuation of the other.

==History==
===West Tennessee===

Originally, US 72 followed US 45 to Selmer and followed a route west to Memphis. In 1931, US 64 replaced US 72 between Memphis and Selmer. In 1935, US 72 was routed to Memphis through Mississippi from Corinth removing the extension on US 45 to Selmer.

As late as the early 1970s, US 72 followed State Route 57 (Poplar Avenue) from Collierville to its western terminus at East Parkway N. (which carried US 64, US 70, and US 79, as well as State Route 1). During the mid-1980s until the early 2000s, U.S. 72&#x27;s westbound route in midtown Memphis was changed to switch from Poplar Avenue to a westbound off-ramp connection with Union Avenue (just as its name changed from Walnut Grove Road), instead of following Poplar west to East Parkway North. (In the same trend, eastbound US 72 ignored East Parkway South and continued eastward on Union—joining SR 57—until an exit ramp deposited the two highways onto eastbound Poplar.) Some signs still remain from this route change.

===Mississippi===

In Tishomingo County, US 72 originally followed the current Road 172 / Quitman Street through Iuka before being bypassed in the mid-1980s. Also, An Old US 72 exists south of US 72 between Burnsville and Glen. US 72 also followed Alcorn County Road 218 and entered Corinth on Proper Street. Until 1935, US 72 followed US 45, now Polk Street / Mississippi Highway 145 north into Tennessee. Also, included in the original 1935 routing west of Corinth followed Mississippi State Route 2 / Kossuth Road to Kossuth before turning west. Continuing westward, yet another segment of Old US 72 exists south of US 72 in Benton County from just west of the Tippah County line to just east of the Wolf River near Canaan. The bridge across the Wolf River collapsed due to flooding and is now closed; much of this segment is now on private property and little evidence of pavement remains due to washout and ecological succession. The continuation of this segment west of Wolf River to Mississippi Highway 5 is signed Wyatt Road. Finally, there is one more route that may have been a former US 72 road alignment. Boswell Road begins as a curve off of US 72 between Slayden and Mount Pleasant as a gravel road, and heads generally parallel to US 72 as a gravel road, before stopping in Mount Pleasant at Mississippi Highway 311. The possible former alignment then continues from the staggered junction heading west as a partially paved road. This road is now broken by Mississippi Highway 302, but continues to head west as a gravel road for a mile, for a total of approximately .

===Alabama===

Most of the original US 72 route in Alabama paralleled the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, a critical route for the South during the American Civil War. Some sections of the original road were named the Memphis Pike reflecting the idea of connecting Chattanooga to Memphis, Tennessee. The original route also belonged to the original route of the Lee Highway. Both of these designations can be found in western Colbert County where sections of the original highway, including parts of Colbert County Route 20 still bear those names.

The original route once passed through Tuscumbia on what is named today the Old Lee Highway and Main Street. This route was bypassed in the 1960s.

In Florence US 72 originally followed Huntsville Road to Royal Avenue, then north to Tennessee Street, and finally west to Court Street. Its route was later moved two blocks south through downtown Florence, from Tennessee Street to Dr. Hicks Boulevard.

East of Florence the original route is now County Highway 66 through downtown Rogersville and Killen.

Athens&#x27; Clinton and Washington Streets hosted a Business 72 route in earlier years. This route was decommissioned in the 1980s.

US 72 has seen several route changes in Huntsville that included a temporary route down Sparkman Drive in the 1960s. Other original routes include Andrew Jackson Way to Holmes Avenue and down Holmes Avenue to reconnect to the original route.

Prior to 1931, US 72 passed through Big Cove between Huntsville and Paint Rock via Little Cove Rd/Old &quot;US 431&quot;. That route was abandoned for the one used today over Chapman Mountain.

Other original routes include State Route 35 from Woodville to the west side of Scottsboro, State Route 279 east of Scottsboro, and State Route 277 from Stevenson to Bridgeport. State Route 277 carries the distinction of being the last two-lane section of US 72 in Alabama. Today, the entire route through Alabama has a minimum of four lanes.

U.S. Route 72 Alternate (US 72 Alternate) exists in Alabama on the south side of the Tennessee River between Muscle Shoals and Decatur. US 72 alt. crosses the Tennessee River at Decatur along with US 31 and follows the entire route of Interstate 565. However, signs on I-65 at the I-565 exit make no mention of US 72 Alt. and only mention SR 20 westbound from the I-65/I-565 junction. SR 20 was co-signed with US 72 Alt. from Muscle Shoals to Huntsville. SR 20 has since been truncated to the junction of I-65 just east of Decatur. Originally, US 72 Alt. turned off of SR 20 on to SR 53 (Jordan Lane) in Huntsville and followed it north to rejoin with US 72. With the completion of I-565 in the early 1990s, US 72 Alt. was routed along with I-565 to the termination of I-565 at US 72.

US 72 Alternate between Decatur and Huntsville is part of Corridor V of the Appalachian Development Highway System.

<doc id="889317" wikidata="Q5470266" url="?curid=889317" title="Formula One Decade">
<text>Formula One Decade was a television show on Speed Channel. First airing on May 11, 2003, the show takes a look at Formula One Grand Prix events that were run 10 years prior to the present season. A one-hour show, the announcers, SPEED&#x27;s Formula One commentary team, Bob Varsha, Steve Matchett, and David Hobbs, perform a mixture of a commentary as if the race is taking place right now along with reminiscing about rules changes and also Matchett&#x27;s then role with Michael Schumacher&#x27;s team. In 2003, when the show looked back at the 1993 season, dominated by Alain Prost, Varsha was the show&#x27;s host, while Hobbs and Matchett looked at videotape of the races, and reminisced. That changed in 2004, when Matchett began introducing the race that would be seen on an episode and wrapping up each show, while Varsha joined Matchett and Hobbs to do commentary.

Speed Channel picked up the rights to broadcast the years-old races in their three-year agreement with FOM in 2003. It was included in their contract that allowed them to continue broadcasting live Formula One races, though it cost extra money, as the Formula One archives are rarely opened to any network.

On April 2, 2004, the show had the daunting task of airing the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, and showing the crash that claimed the life of 3-time World Drivers&#x27; Champion, and 41-time Grand Prix race winner Ayrton Senna in that event. Matchett, a mechanic for Benetton-Ford that weekend, made these remarks at the beginning of the broadcast:

:&quot;Welcome to&quot; F1 Decade, &quot;Speed Channel&#x27;s retrospective of the 1994 Formula 1 World Championship. We have reached round three-the San Marino Grand Prix. The constant, metronomic beat of the clock has led us, inescapably, to Imola, and when the date 1994 and the name of Imola are brought together, they combine to form nothing but black, somber memories. The events of that race weekend, from the morning of April 28, when the teams first assembled at the track, until the evening of Sunday, May 1, rest amongst motor racing&#x27;s darkest times. It was a weekend of tragedy, despair, and death. 10 years on, it may be that some viewers would prefer not to watch the coverage of these events, and if you feel in any way unsure, then I urge you to switch off your TV now. We cannot shy away from the fact that three very serious accidents happened. The events of Imola are a part of the sport&#x27;s history. The aftermath of that horrible weekend would forever change the way Grand Prix cars are built, and forever change the way the races themselves are conducted. We at Speed Channel feel it is only proper that the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix is correctly documented, and that, in our opinion, must include correct coverage of Ayrton Senna&#x27;s fatal accident.&quot;

The show returned in 2005, taking a look back at the 1995 season, when Michael Schumacher took his second straight World Drivers&#x27; Championship. &quot;F1 Decade&quot; was not renewed for 2006; if it had been, it would have looked back at Damon Hill&#x27;s championship season in 1996.

==History==
* The series&#x27; first episode took a look at the opening round of the 1993 Formula One season, the 1993 South African Grand Prix at Kyalami, which was the last South African Grand Prix ever held.
* A special edition of the show took place on September 26, 2003, during the weekend of the 2003 United States Grand Prix, when Jackie Stewart joined Hobbs to take a look back at the 1973 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, which Stewart won.
* On April 2, 2004, a special re-broadcast of the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was aired to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the tragic deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna. The broadcast, as Steve Matchett said in the introduction to it, was not cut or edited to exclude Senna&#x27;s fatal crash.
* Matchett worked on Johnny Herbert&#x27;s car as a mechanic at Benetton. Herbert and Matchett both claimed their maiden Formula One wins in the 1995 British Grand Prix, a race perhaps made most famous for the fact that Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill crashed out of the race while battling for the lead. At episode&#x27;s end, Matchett talked about how nervous he was during the closing laps of the race, and how much the win had meant to him. Said Matchett, &quot;I freely confess that those closing laps at Silverstone rank amongst the most stressful times of my life! They seemed to take forever!&quot; Herbert and Matchett would team up for another Formula One win in 1995 — the 1995 Italian Grand Prix at Monza, another race in which Schumacher and Hill crashed out together.

<text>U.S. Route 73 (US 73) is a north–south United States highway that runs for from northeast Kansas to southeast Nebraska. The highway&#x27;s southern terminus is Bonner Springs, Kansas at I-70. Its northern terminus is near Dawson, Nebraska at US 75.

===Kansas===

U.S. Route 73 begins at I-70 in Kansas City in a concurrency with U.S. Route 24, U.S. Route 40, and K-7. Two miles north of its terminus, US 24 and US 40 turn west, while US 73 continues north with K-7. It continues north with K-7 through Lansing, where it intersects K-5. US 73 and K-7 then continue through Leavenworth. It goes northwesterly from Leavenworth, meeting K-192 near Easton and at Atchison, turns west. At Atchison, it loses K-7 and is briefly concurrent with U.S. Route 59. It goes west and turns northwest near Lancaster at its intersection with K-9. It goes through Huron and begins a concurrency with K-20 near Everest. It goes west into Horton and intersects U.S. Route 159. The two highways continue north together and meet U.S. Route 36 at Hiawatha. After a brief northwesterly routing through Reserve, US 73 and US 159 turn north and enter Nebraska.

===Nebraska===
U.S. Routes 73 and 159 enter Nebraska northwest of Reserve, Kansas. U.S. Route 159 turns east in Falls City, Nebraska toward Rulo, Nebraska and continues east toward Interstate 29 in Missouri. A few miles north of Falls City, U.S. Route 73 turns west, passes through Verdon, and ends at U.S. Route 75 just north of Dawson, Nebraska.

==History==
The original southern terminus was at Atoka, Oklahoma at an intersection with U.S. Highway 75. From the creation of the highway in 1926 until April 11, 1935, US 73 was split between Oswego, Kansas and Horton, Kansas. US 73E followed modern US 160 from Oswego to Columbus, then modern US 69 to Kansas City, where it then latched onto what is now US 73. The US 73E designated then went from Kansas City to Horton. US 73W followed the route of modern U.S. Route 59 from Oswego to K-39, K-39 west to Chanute, modern U.S. Route 169 from Chanute to Garnett, modern US 59 again from Garnett to Nortonville, and then modern U.S. Route 159 from Nortonville to Horton. On April 10, 1935, US 73 was truncated at Kansas City with the modern designations taking over the old routes and US 69 taking over the Atoka-Oswego segment. In Kansas City, US 73 previously followed U.S. Route 24 into downtown Kansas City, Kansas, terminating at the Intercity Viaduct (Lewis and Clark Viaduct), before Interstate 435 was completed. After I-435 was completed, US 73 ended at its intersection with I-435. On December 1, 2008, the southern terminus was rerouted, along with US 24 and US 40, southward along K-7 to its new terminus at I-70.

Nebraska also had a split highway, with the split between Tekamah and Winnebago between 1935 and 1957. US 73E went north through Decatur along the current route of U.S. Route 75, while US 73W went west from Tekamah along current Nebraska Highway 32 to Oakland, then north from Oakland in a concurrency with U.S. Route 77.

The original northern terminus was south of Auburn, Nebraska, near Howe, Nebraska. US 73 went east through Howe, then south to Stella, Nebraska, then east through Shubert, Nebraska, then south to the current highway. In 1932, the highway was extended to South Sioux City, Nebraska. In 1965, the route was shortened to Winnebago, Nebraska. In 1984, U.S. 75 was removed from western Iowa along Interstate 29 and placed on U.S. 73&#x27;s route, superseding it through Omaha, Nebraska and truncating the highway to its present northern terminus near Dawson, Nebraska.

K-227 was a highway in Kansas that was designated on September 9, 1968. K-227&#x27;s southern terminus was at K-4 and U.S. Route 59 (US-59) in the city of Atchison and the northern terminus was at K-9 and US-73 in Atchison. In 1980, US-73 was realigned along K-227 and at that time K-227 was decommissioned.

<doc id="889373" wikidata="Q2913636" url="?curid=889373" title="Rock Howard">
<text>is a fictional character appearing in various games from SNK. Rock makes his first appearance as a playable character in the 1999 fighting game &quot;&quot;, a chapter in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, as the new lead character from the series. Rock appears in the series as the son of Geese Howard, the main antagonist from the previous &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; games, who fell to his death after refusing to be saved by Terry Bogard. However, Terry adopted Rock in order to put his past with Geese behind him, and helped teach Rock how to fight. The mystery behind his missing father leads him to clash with Terry in &quot;Garou&quot; which will be further explored in the 2025 sequel &quot;Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&quot; Besides his appearance in &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot;, Rock is featured in few games from &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, as well as various crossovers from SNK. &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot; feature him as downloadable content with the latter incorparting him into the main &quot;KOF&quot; canon for the first time as the leader of the Garou Team with two B. Jenet and Gato, two fellow rivals from his original game.

Rock was created by Nobuyuki Kuroki to be the new &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; as well as Terry&#x27;s successor. This resulted in his younger contrasting look and dark fate caused by his relationship with Geese. Rock&#x27;s development in the &quot;KOF&quot; spin-off series was handled by Akihiko Ureshino who wanted to further explore Rock&#x27;s life before &quot;Garou&quot; while in &quot;KOF&quot; DLC he was developed to be a stronger fighter. His returns in &quot;City of the Wolves&quot; is meant to further explore his lineage and relationship with Terry Bogard. He was voiced by Eiji Takemoto () since debut until &quot;Maximum Impact Regulation A&quot;, later voiced by Yuuma Uchida (). In the English edition of &quot;&quot;, he is voiced by Jon Thomas and by Mike Lane in its .

Rock has also been featured in manwhua adaptations from the games he has appeared as well as the anime &quot;The King of Fighters Another Day&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters: Destiny&quot;. Rock&#x27;s character has received various responses from video games publications. His debut in &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot; has been highly praised by reviewers although some of them considered his character to be too strong in comparison to the others, although his development in the &quot;KOF: Maximum Impact&quot; series has been criticized due to his English voice actor and his new outfit. The character has been praised for his game design as his mixed martial arts combine elements from his father Geese with his adoptive father Terry, as a symbolic way of describing his life with his dark fate. While his story in &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; in general has been popular form due to &quot;Garou&quot; ending on a dark cliffhanger, the character has also been popular for his return in &quot;City of the Wolves&quot; and his inclusion as downloadable content in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; with a more balanced design.

==Conception and design==

Though introduced in &quot;&quot;, Rock&#x27;s first appearance was a cameo in &quot;Fatal Fury 3&quot; as a child. From a cameo, he ended up becoming a protagonist with that strong presence. For that reason, the character with Terry Bogard&#x27;s cap, Rock, did not appear in the plot &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; writers wrote back then. However, since he was writing in 2007 after the release of &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot;, he could not ignore Rock, the writers revised that part and linked it with Terry&#x27;s life after Geese&#x27;s death, and kept it to about the length of one paperback volume. As Akihiko often writes novelizations, there are often characters who end up suffering due to the circumstances of the plot.

Rock Howard was designed as the new lead character of the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series by Nobuyuki Kuroki in 1998. Both he and Yasuyuki Oda wondered what type of hero would succeed Terry Bogard in &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;″s latest game, &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot;. While they were not confident with Rock, they still decided to make him as the new protagonist. Rock&#x27;s character and entire personality served as the main basis for the game. This led to the creation of supporting characters like B. Jenet or Terry Bogard&#x27;s redesign. Since Rock was the protagonist, the cast gave full attention to him. Nobyuki Kuroki tried giving him his own style of cool which he hoped would attract gamers. Rock was designed to contrast previous masculine &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; characters by giving him a more &quot;bishonen&quot; appearance, something Kuroki felt the sequel needed to balance the cast. According to Oda, Rock was originally a weak character in his own debut. SNK wanted Rock to retain many of his original traits from &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot;, such as the way he adjusts his gloves.

Dan was in a subprogrammer in charge of enemy AIs as well as Rock, Don Juan, Hotaru, Hokutomaru, and Grant. Rock Howard&#x27;s Deadly Rave move was originally hard to do during location tests. The story was written with a cliffhanger from the get go, leaving material for a potential sequel which remained on development hell. New moves were done for both Rock and B. Jenet before the development was put on hold. Though Akihiko Ureshino has not talked about working in the upcoming &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; sequel &quot;Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&quot;, he sees the Terry from &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot; as a more fatherly character having issues adopting Rock Howard and trying his best to write them together in the spin-off &quot;&quot; which takes place before &quot;Garou&quot; under his own request. When Rock says that &quot;there is a possibility that he may change greatly in the future&quot;, he means that when he is confronted with a truth that he did not know until then, the values that Rock has cultivated while living with Terry may be completely overturned. If a sequel were had been released, perhaps Rock might have been transformed into a character who was at odds with Terry. According to Yasuyuki Oda, the phrase The King of Fighters is commonly associated with Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami than &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; characters. As a result, the new tournament was dubbed &quot;Maximum Mayhem King of Fighters&quot; to give a new tension to associate Terry and Rock.

Since &quot;The King of Fighters 2003&quot;, Terry in &quot;KOF&quot; has been based on the design from &quot;Garou&quot;, rather than the original red cap design. On the other hand, in &quot;Maximum Impact&quot;, he has his original &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; design. As a scenario writer, this is a uncomfortable for him due to the lack of age gap between Rock and Terry. In the &quot;Garou&quot; setting, there is an age difference of nearly 20 years between Terry and Rock. However, while Rock joined &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; at the equivalent of 17 years old, young Terry&#x27;s age has stopped at about 24 years old. Even if Rock stands next to him, he looks like a brother at best, not a stepfather and son. That is why he feel uncomfortable when the two of them talk in demo scenes and the like. Geese is already dead in the world of &quot;Maximum Impact&quot;. That led Rock&#x27;s age as the standard and make Terry&#x27;s middle aged man by the default. Whether fans want a young Terry or an old man Terry aside, if Terry becomes an old man, it would be strange if Billy Kane didn&#x27;t become an old man as well. For him, it was fun to think about the reactions of Rock, or Billy, who faced Geese&#x27;s nightmare. For &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;, Rock was considered for inclusion. Although Geese&#x27;s appearance resulted in the development team finding it complicated to proceed with this plan, as &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot; occurs years after Geese&#x27;s death in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, they ultimately changed their minds and included Rock as a DLC character. According to Oda, Rock was originally a weak character in his own debut. As a result, the staff highly reworked Rock&#x27;s fighting style for &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; in order simultaneously strengthen him and heighten his popularity. At the same time, SNK wanted Rock to retain many of his original traits from &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot;, such as the way he adjusts his gloves.

Several of the Miera brothers&#x27; prototype designs were assigned to other characters&#x27; alternate outfits; in this case, Alba&#x27;s prototype design became Rock&#x27;s alternate outfit. Two of his extra outfits from &quot;KOF: Maximum Impact 2&quot; are also cosplays from Kaede, the lead character from &quot;The Last Blade&quot; (this is in contrast to the similarities between Sakura Mitsukoshi from Face&#x27;s &quot;Money Puzzle Exchanger&quot; and Sakura Kinomoto from Clamp&#x27;s &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;, as both of them have green eyes and voiced by Sakura Tange, Eiji Takemoto&#x27;s then castmate in Aoni Production), and Kain R. Heinlein, the final boss from &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot;.

In his development blog for &quot;&quot;, Ureshino states that he does not know about Rock&#x27;s mother or the true inheritor of Geese&#x27;s legacy but hints that it would most likely conflict with Terry if SNK released another game involving them. One of Oda&#x27;s biggest desires with &quot;City of the Wolves&quot; is ending Rock&#x27;s story arc which has been on cliffhangers for decades due to SNK cancelling the first &quot;Garou&quot; sequel. Rock&#x27;s and Terry&#x27;s designs in &quot;City of the Wolves&quot; were altered to look different from &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; and have a different demeanor. Rock&#x27;s appearance was changed based on American comic books as notable through his altered facial expressions. The story will properly explore Rock Howard&#x27;s lineage as foreshadowed by his uncle Kain R. Heinlein in the ending of &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot;. It was decided to skip the timeline some years making Rock now a young adult.

==Appearances==
Despite making cameos in &quot;Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory&quot; as a child friendly with the lead Terry Bogard, Rock is properly introduced as a playable character in &quot;&quot;, having both lived with Terry and studied martial arts under him for ten years after Geese Howard&#x27;s death. During this time, a new King of Fighters tournament arose under the name &quot;Maximum Mayhem&quot;, which Rock and Terry both decide to compete in. By the end of the tournament, Rock finds his final opponent is Kain R. Heinlein, who reveals himself to be both the host and Rock&#x27;s uncle. Kain, aware that Geese Howard&#x27;s will held presumably valuable secrets but unable to discover them without assistance, wins Rock&#x27;s aid in working through the document by offering information regarding Rock&#x27;s mother—whom Kain claimed was still alive. Terry accepts Rock&#x27;s decision to become Kain&#x27;s new partner, with Rock promising to return. &quot;Memories of Stray Wolves&quot;, a twenty-minute featurette serves as a retrospective of the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, with Terry narrating the events of the games to Rock.

Despite making several cameos in games from &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, Rock was only playable in the spin-off games &quot;&quot; and &quot;Maximum Impact 2&quot; for several years. Both games feature Rock entering into King of Fighters tournaments developed in Southtown prior to the events of &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot;. In spite of his father&#x27;s ways, Rock is a warm, friendly and compassionate young man, possessing Terry&#x27;s strong sense of justice and heroism. Every day, Rock fights off his evil side and tries to get out of the shadow of his father. He is the middle term between Geese&#x27;s excessive evil and Terry&#x27;s excessive festive personality. Rock is also a very compassionate man, offering to help those in need, such as helping Hotaru Futaba to find her older brother. He also tends to be very uncomfortable and nervous around women, having been raised by men nearly all of his life. Rock makes his first playable appearance in a mainline &quot;King of Fighters&quot; title in &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;, being added to the game via post-launch downloadable content. However his canonical first participation on the team-based tournament is in &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot;, where he is a new leader of the DLC Team Garou. Rock also appears as a playable character in the crossover video games &quot;NeoGeo Battle Coliseum&quot; and &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2&quot;.

Rock also appears in the 2006 original net animation &quot;The King of Fighters: Another Day&quot;. In the second episode Rock finds Lien Neville fighting Billy Kane, Geese&#x27;s former right-hand man, in the Geese Tower. As Lien is about to be killed, Rock saves her, which enrages Billy as he cannot believe that he is Geese&#x27;s son. As Billy attacks Rock, Lien shoots a laser that takes Billy out of the tower. The first seven volumes from the manhua &quot;The King of Fighters 2003&quot; by Wing Yen features a short chapter from &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot; based on Rock&#x27;s training with Terry and their eventual fight in the semifinals which ends with the teenager&#x27;s victory and follows with his battle against Grant.

A young Rock appears in the 2017 webseries, &quot;The King of Fighters: Destiny&quot;. In episode eleven, Rock meets Terry at a coffee shop. He is caught by a worker attempting to steal food, so he pretends that Terry is his father to escape trouble. After learning that the boy has no one to raise him, Terry promises to adopt Rock as his son after he defeats Geese. Terry&#x27;s display of kindness towards Rock also convinces Angelina to stop herself from poisoning him.

Rock is featured in &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot;, and makes a cameo in the King of Fighters Stadium stage in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

==Reception==
Rock was voted as the number one favorite character with 190 votes at the time of his debut in &quot;&quot; in a popularity poll from such game developed by SNK. &quot;Game Type&quot; magazine praised Rock and Terry&#x27;s relationship as they really seem like son and father and wondered whether or not Terry&#x27;s love interest Blue Mary would end up joining them. However, they lamented the game ending on a cliffhanger with Rock joining Kain and leaving Terry&#x27;s side despite their bond. ScreenRant said that the one of the several reasons &quot;KOF&quot; fans want to see the &quot;Garou&quot; sequel is because of Rock&#x27;s unfinished story which was famous in general. When SNK was &quot;revived&quot; thanks to the return of &quot;KOF&quot; after years with &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; and &quot;Samurai Showdown&quot;, SNK fans saw potential in the development of the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; sequel. As another reference to &quot;Garou&quot; unfinished story, &quot;SNK Heroines&quot; had Terry Bogard&#x27;s ending be a nightmare of Rock killing him by throwing him from a cliff like Terry accidentally did with Geese indicating Oda&#x27;s desire to continue the narrative as if he was traumatized like Terry. This led to more wonders to fans whether or not Rock&#x27;s story could be continued in the future. 

GameRant regarded Rock as the weakest character of &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot; as a result of the handling of his special moves and thus called him as having one of the biggest glow ups in gaming thanks to SNK&#x27;s rehandling of the character in &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot; where he became one of the strongest members from the cast. In regards to Rock&#x27;s story, Comic Book Resources noted that Rock&#x27;s ending from &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot; ended on a major cliffhanger and there has been a desire to continue the plot of &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; from this point. In a preview from &quot;Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&quot;, Destructoid claimed he still felt like the Rock from &quot;Garou&quot; and is notable for inheriting more of Terry&#x27;s moves. The Outer Heaven praised his reprisal of Geese&#x27;s old technqiues like the Reppuken but with air variations and how his Raging Storm is as iconic as Geese&#x27;s. In regards to moves taken from Terry, the writer noted Rock took Terry&#x27;s High Angle Gesyer from &quot;The King of Fighters 2002&quot; as Terry also had replaced that with his Buster Wolf. Griffin Pautu voicing him in the English dub was noted to be nostalgic for Insomniac&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. In regards to his role in the story, Outerheaven believed more of Rock&#x27;s lore will be revealed and for this the rest of the game&#x27;s cast will be important, citing Kim&#x27;s sons and Gato as key figures. Anime News Network felt the mixture of Rock and new Terry moves like the Power Geyser helped to give the character good game design as he keeps showing signs of his father and adoptive father through his gameplay. Though Rock remains as the main character in &quot;City of the Wolves&quot;, the first confirmation of the sequel generated rumors about his actions in the story as he is followed by two silhouettes in the background that are harder to see. In regards to the character&#x27;s life, GeneracionXbox believes that his relationship with Terry is still stable despite having abandoned him favor of Kain as his uncle motivated with the idea of finding his missing mother in the end of &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot;. While liking the imported moves from &quot;Garou&quot;, the writer enjoyed that Rock could now perform the Power Geyser. GameReactor asked Yasyuki Oda in anticipation but the planner decided to leave it ambiguous. BonusStageMX described the character as a conflicted teenager due to the multiple emotions he experiences in the story due to, despite having a peaceful growth with Terry, he appears to face a dark fate when learning of his lineage, especially his mother&#x27;s current state which could be the main factor to why he fights in &quot;City of the Wolves&quot;. Surtido regarded Rock as a character who has been in Terry and Geese&#x27;s shadow, but with &quot;City of the Wolves&quot; he becomes able to show off despite his problematic story involving his missing mother. Lablelling him and Terry as SNK&#x27;s &quot;biggest stars&quot;, GameRant said that Rock&#x27;s design appeared to be recycled from &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot; with few differences and enhanced. According to &quot;Sensatez&quot;, &quot;City of the Wolves&quot; might have a heavy emphasis about Rock&#x27;s relationship with Terry, as he will try to stay loyal to his adoptive father despite having abandoned him. They also teased the chance of Rock and Terry becoming enemies in a tower mirroring the final fight between Terry and Geese from &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury&quot;.

Rock has also been notable for becoming a downloadable character in &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; with Comic Book Resources seeing him as one of the best DLCs in general , and is worthy enough to appear in another sequel just like he did in &quot;XIV&quot;. Gmnetwork referred to him as &quot;One of the most requested and popular characters in SNK&#x27;s fighting game history&quot; which made his appearance in &quot;XIV&quot; appealing to fans especially since he has been missing from several SNK games despite being the new lead of &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and having a striking story and gameplay. Blog PlayStation regarded Rock as a &quot;fan-favorite&quot; with praise on his mix of Geese and Terry&#x27;s special moves. Destructoid referred to Rock as the most impressive based on his popularity in SNK games in general. He saw his &quot;XIV&quot; interested and looked forward to use his counter moves he inherited from Geese while also referring to his original &quot;Garou&quot; low-tier character. Den of Geek found Rock&#x27;s debut in &quot;KOF&quot;″s main series with &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; interesting due to the fact in this timeline his father is alive unlike in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; one. Rock&#x27;s revelation as a DLC was leaked by fans; this angered Oda who wanted to surprise fans with the official trailer. Nevertheless, Oda hoped the fans would enjoy playing as him. When SNK announced and increase of sales of profits and sales in 2017, Destructoid attributed it to the DLC of &quot;XIV&quot;, citing Rock as one of the reasons for such increase. In November 2019, mangaka Itokatsu known for writing &quot;Silver Nina&quot; made her own sketch of Rock in tribute of the anniversary of &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot;.

In regards to Rock&#x27;s inclusion as DLC in &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot;, Screen Rant regarded Team Garou as the best DLC in the entire game for coming for different eras of the company with Rock making his first canonical appearance in a main &quot;KOF&quot; game in contrast to the returning B. Jenet and Gato, making it a highlight for him due to his few appearances in &quot;KOF&quot; games, appearing only in spin-offs. The Gamer set Rock as &quot;One of the most popular characters in SNK&#x27;s lineage&quot; when demanding his role as playable character &quot;KOF XV&quot;, citing his popularity in &quot;Garou&quot; and &quot;KOF XIV&quot; thanks to his mixtures of Terry and Geese&#x27;s moves. PCInvasion was surprised by Rock&#x27;s revelation in &quot;KOF XV&quot; as DLC considering the young fighter as appealing as the iconic Terry Bogard. The fact that Geese Howard&#x27;s team would also be DLC was also the subject of praise for the potential it gives.

Rock also influenced two other SNK characters. As &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot; was developed at the same time as Garou: Mark of the Wolves, the protagonist&#x27;s designer Shinichi Morioka was fearing the lead K&#x27; was too similar to Rock which made him nervous. When developing &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; protagonist Shun&#x27;ei, Rock served as the main inspiration for the character. Kuroki noted both Rock and Shun&#x27;ei were developed as &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; characters but aimed towards a female audience.

<text>U.S. Route 74 (US 74) is an east–west United States highway that runs for from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. Primarily in North Carolina, it serves as an important highway from the mountains to the sea, connecting the cities of Asheville, Charlotte and Wilmington. It is known as Andrew Jackson Highway throughout most of North Carolina.

===Tennessee===

US 74 was designated in 1927. The route travels from the I-24/I-75 interchange, in Chattanooga, northeast to Cleveland, where it then continues east, along with US 64, to the North Carolina state line. The highway is predominantly freeway or expressway grade four-lane, except between Ocoee and Ducktown, where it is a curvy two-lane mountain highway along the Ocoee River known as the Ocoee Scenic Byway.

TDOT&#x27;s signage for US 74 is poor. Most highways that cross it will typically only list I-75 or US 64 instead; I-75 completely ignores US 74 along its route, even ignoring it at their intersection, showing instead the US 64 Bypass.

===North Carolina===

From the Tennessee state line, US 74 traverses across the southern portion of the state, connecting the major cities Asheville, Charlotte, and Wilmington, for a total of .

In western North Carolina, US 74 enters the state with a concurrency with US 64. Routed along on pre-existing highways in the region, specifically the: Appalachian Highway (at-grade expressway, except in the Nantahala Gorge) and the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway (controlled-access freeway, which is broken in three sections along the route); it shares a revolving door of concurrency changes with US 19, US 129, US 441 and US 23. The alternating named highway (depending on grade of road) is considered the commercial back-bone and main truck route of Western North Carolina, connecting the cities of Murphy, Andrews, Bryson City, Cherokee, Sylva, and Waynesville. In or around October, the fall colors create an influx of more tourists in the region. In the winter months, the highway is the first to be salted and plowed; however, both the Nantahala Gorge and Balsam Gap tend to get the most snow and/or ice in the region and should be traveled with care.

North of Clyde, US 74 merges with Interstate 40 and goes east, in concurrency, to Asheville. From there, it then goes southeast, in concurrency with Interstate 26 till Columbus, where it separates and continues east along a mostly controlled-access highway, except in Shelby, to Interstate 85, in Kings Mountain.

After crossing a unique weave intersection with Interstate 85, it joins with US 29 and travels through downtown Gastonia along Franklin Boulevard. East of Gastonia, it becomes Wilkinson Boulevard as it goes through McAdenville, Cramerton and Belmont. After crossing the Lake Wylie/Catawba River, via Sloans Ferry Bridge, it enters Charlotte, with connections with Interstate 485 and Interstate 85/Charlotte Douglas International Airport, via Little Rock Road. At Morehead Street, west of Center City, it splits with US 29 for Interstate 277 along the John Belk Freeway. East of Center City, it goes solo again along Independence Freeway/Boulevard to Matthews, where it connects again with Interstate 485.

After leaving the Charlotte city limits, the route turns southeast as it goes through Stallings, Indian Trail and Monroe, where it briefly overlaps with US 601, before continuing east again through Wingate, Marshville, Peachland, Polkton, Wadesboro and Lilesville. On this stretch, prior to 2018, signage for the route was very poor, only being found at a few locations along the route. As part of the US 74 Monroe Bypass project, signage along the route was improved by the NCDOT.

Crossing the Pee Dee River and into the Sandhills region, US 74 meets up with Future Interstates I-73/I-74, in Rockingham. After a future interchange near NC 38 that will end its overlap with Interstate 73, US 74/Future I-74 continues southeast, bypassing Laurinburg and Maxton. East of Maxton and through Lumberton, the highway is officially US 74/Interstate 74, before dropping back to Future I-74 west of Boardman; the concurrency with Future I-74 ends at Bolton, where a future interchange will split from US 74 to continue south towards South Carolina. This is one of only two instances (along with I-41 in Wisconsin) of similarly numbered U.S. and Interstate routes being designated on the same road.

Near Chadbourn, US 74 overlaps with US 76, which continue mostly together till Wrightsville Beach, where US 74 dead-ends north and US 76 dead-ends south. Eastbound after the overlap with US 76, US 74 continues on Salisbury Street through some residential areas and businesses before coming to a traffic light separating Salisbury Street and Lumina Avenue. Drivers are directed to take a left on to North Lumina Avenue to continue on US 74 while South Lumina Avenue connects to Jack Parker Boulevard, which leads to US 76. Approximately on North Lumina, US 74 reaches its eastern terminus at a dead end circle with an entrance to the local Shell Island Resort hotel.

The highway connects the cities and towns of Whiteville, Lake Waccamaw, and Wilmington. The road through the Cape Fear region is flat, surrounded by parts of the Green Swamp.

===ADHS corridors===
US 74 overlaps with two corridors that are part of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS), which is part of Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). Passed in 1965, the purpose of ADHS is to generate economic development in previously isolated areas, supplement the interstate system, connect Appalachia to the interstate system, and provide access to areas within the Region as well as to markets in the rest of the nation.

* Corridor A – From I-285, in Sandy Springs, Georgia to I-40, near Clyde, North Carolina. US 74 overlap from US 23, in Dillsboro, to I-40, near Clyde; it is also completed with divided four-lane limited-access and controlled-access sections. This corridor is signed as &quot;Appalachian Highway,&quot; in white text on blue background.
* Corridor K – From I-75, in Cleveland, Tennessee, to US 23, in Dillsboro, North Carolina. The entire section of US 74 is authorized for ADHS funding. The majority of the route is a four-lane limited-access road, with a section that is controlled-access between Bryson City and Cherokee. Current two-lane sections that are impending improvements are: Ocoee River to Ducktown and the Nantahala Gorge. In North Carolina, this corridor is signed as &quot;Appalachian Highway,&quot; in white text on blue background.

===Scenic byways===
The Ocoee Scenic Byway is a National Forest Scenic Byway that traverses through the Cherokee National Forest, in East Tennessee. 19 miles of the Byway are concurrent with US 74 (in addition to U.S. Route 64). Features include the Ocoee Whitewater Center and scenic bluffs along Ocoee River and Gorge.

Nantahala Byway is a byway from Marble to Whittier; it is known for its scenic views of the Nantahala Gorge, The Great Smoky Mountains Railroad, and whitewater rafting on the Nantahala River. US 74 overlaps of the byway from Marble to Bryson City. The byway also overlaps with US 19 and US 129.

===Dedicated and memorial names===

US 74 features several dedicated bridges and stretches of highway throughout its route.

* American Indian Highway  – this name was authored by Tuscarora Indian Robert M. Chavis, he launched a campaign to obtain support from all the city councils and the Robeson county Commissioners, they all signed onto the partition Mr. Chavis sent to the NCDOT and it was approved by the state DOT, official North Carolina name of the section of US 74/I-74 in Robeson County (mile marker 191–213).

==History==
Established as an original U.S. Route in late 1926, US 74 traversed from Asheville to Chadbourn, in North Carolina. It was extended eastward in late 1934 to Wilmington, replacing an old alignment of US 17.

In 1936, US 74 was extended eastward again from Wilmington, via Market Street, to Wrightsville Beach, then going north on Lumina Avenue to its current eastern terminus. US 74 also spawned two alternate routes the same year, the first and shortest () in Leland, and a second in Shelby; which eventually replaced all of US 74 through the downtown area by 1949 (later renamed US 74 Business in 1960).

In 1937, US 74 was rerouted through Kings Mountain, replacing part of NC 7. Its old alignment became an alternate route, but was replaced a year later by both NC 161 and NC 274.

By 1949, US 74 was on its first bypass around Rutherfordton, via Ruth; its former route becoming an alternate route (later renamed US 74 Business in 1960). In 1952, the first Monroe Bypass was completed, leaving a short-lived alternate route going through the downtown area. By 1953, the first bypass around Rockingham was completed, leaving a short lived alternate route through the downtown area.

In 1970, US 74 was placed on new freeway alignment bypassing Spindale, Forest City, Ellenboro, and Mooresboro; the old route was replaced by an extension of US 74 Business. In 1973, US 74 was realigned onto new road south of Lumberton. In 1975, US 74/US 76 was rerouted onto new freeway bypass south of Leland and then east of Belville, its old alignment becoming secondary roads. In 1976, US 74/US 76 was bypassed north of Chadbourn and Whiteville, leaving behind US 74 Bus./US 76 Bus.

In 1984, Maxton was bypassed, replaced by an extension of US 74 Bus. In 1985, US 74 was rerouted north of Kings Mountain onto new freeway bypass; its old alignment becoming US 74 Bus. In 1986, Hallsboro and Lake Waccamaw were bypassed; its old alignment replaced by NC 214.

Also in 1986, US 74 was extended west, from Asheville to Chattanooga, Tennessee. The routing extension started at its former western terminus with US 70, going northerly, in concurrency with US 70, to I-240, where it overlapped briefly before joining US 19/US 23. From Asheville, in concurrency with US 19/US 23, it went through Canton and Lake Junaluska. From Lake Junaluska, in concurrency with US 23, it went through Waynesville. Near Dillsboro it switches US 23 for US 441 and continues till it splits north within the Qualla Boundary. West of Bryson City, it overlaps with NC 28. In Topton, it joins with US 129 and continues southwesterly till at Murphy, where it joins with US 64 and separates from US 19/US 129. Heading west, in concurrency with US 64, it enters Tennessee; traversing through Ducktown, it reaches Cleveland, where it then follows the US 64 Bypass to I-75. Continuing southeasterly, as a hidden concurrency with I-75, it connects with Chattanooga, ending at its new terminus at I-24.

In 1988, US 74 was extended east to its current eastern terminus in Wrightsville Beach. In 1990, US 74 was rerouted onto I-277 (John Belk Freeway), this left a section of Independence Boulevard that was still overlapped with NC 27. In 1992–1993, Bolton was bypassed to the north, with its old alignment becoming an extension of NC 214.

In 1994, US 74 was rerouted onto I-40 for , in Asheville, and then onto I-26, from Asheville to Columbus. East of Columbus, it traverses along new freeway to Forest City, where it meets back with its old alignment. The former routing between Asheville and Forest City becomes US 74A. In 1996, US 74 was rerouted through Wilmington. In late 1997, US 74 was rerouted onto I-40, between Clyde and Asheville.

In 2002, US 74 was placed on its second bypass around both Rockingham and Hamlet, its old alignment becoming US 74 Business. In 2005, US 74 was rerouted north of downtown Wilmington. In 2007, US 74 was placed on new freeway, in concurrency with I-74 from Maxton to just east of I-95; its old alignment becoming US 74 Alternate.

In 2018, US 74&#x27;s new toll bypass around Monroe was completed.

===Independence Boulevard===
Independence Boulevard and Independence Expressway are two major interconnected roads in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina that carry US 74. Originally constructed in the 1940s and early 1950s, Independence Boulevard was the city of Charlotte&#x27;s first expressway. The road has undergone numerous realignments, extensions, upgrades, truncations, and renamings since the mid-20th century.

Ben Douglas, former mayor of Charlotte and member of the North Carolina State Highway Commission, helped lead the push for the urban highway project in the 1940s that would become Independence Boulevard. In 1946, Charlotte voters passed a referendum in favor of a $200,000 bond issue to fund the project; this was coupled with over $2 million in federal funding. The expressway was to be named after Independence Park that was largely demolished to make way for the road; the name suggestion was coined by City Clerk Lillian Hoffman on May 4, 1949, after a previous suggestion naming it after the current mayor, Herbert Baxter, was rejected. Construction commenced in the late 1940s and the new expressway which traversed east–west along the southern part of the city opened in two parts; the first opened to traffic in 1949 and the other opened in 1950. US 74 and NC 27 were subsequently shifted from their central business district alignments to the new expressway.

Major changes to Independence Boulevard occurred in the 1980s. A portion of West Independence Boulevard was converted from expressway to limited-access freeway and made a part of the John Belk Freeway and Interstate 277. The portion west of Interstate 77 was renamed Wilkinson Boulevard. A new intersection with I-277 (which would also connect to the Brookshire Freeway that was upgraded as part of the I-277 project) was constructed and the connecting freeway along with the updated portion of East Independence Boulevard was given the name Independence Freeway; US 74 was shifted to this new alignment. After the massive transportation revamp, a few disconnected segments of the original Independence Boulevard remained. These segments were later reorganized and given the names Carson Boulevard, Stonewall Street, and South Independence Boulevard; the latter was downgraded to a surface street and renamed Charlottetown Avenue in 2007 to prevent confusion with the unconnected East Independence Boulevard. In 2021, Stonewall Street was renamed to Brooklyn Village Avenue to honor a Charlotte neighborhood that had been demolished for expansion of the Uptown area.

The freeway and bus lanes of Independence Freeway were extended to Albemarle Road in 2005. The limited-access road extension has caused numerous businesses along the corridor to leave the area and vacate their commercial real estate, resulting in brownfield land.

===&quot;American Indian Highway&quot; controversy===
In Robeson County, the highway is designated &quot;American Indian Highway,&quot; a name that was the brain child of Robert M. Chavis, the Wolfclan chief of the NC Tuscarora; Cherokee Indians of Robeson County, and Nottoway Nation, who authored the name in the late 1990s. American Indian people of Robeson County, NC had attempted to remove Andrew Jackson&#x27;s name from the highway for some sixty years. Knowing that the new US 74 was to come, Chavis started a campaign to change the name to American Indian Highway. Chavis did this in honor of all the Indian people that had lost their lives along the Trail of Tears during the Indian Removal Act of the 1830s authored by Andrew Jackson. Chavis was cited in many newspapers across North Carolina stating that the name should be changed, because that name on this section of road was tantamount to having a major road named Adolf Hitler that ran across a Jewish state or county. Chavis, with the help of the Tuscarora East of the Mountains, obtained the information on how to attempt the name change from Rep. Ronnie Sutton and the NCDOT. Then Chavis presented the reasons for the name change to all the cities of Robeson County and the Robeson County Commissioners. Once he obtained support from these entities, he presented the proposal to the NCDOT. Rep. Sutton supported the name change at the state level and the name change was approved by the NCDOT. The new signs of American Indian Highway were placed on the new sections of I-74 once the highway construction was completed.

==Future==
===Western North Carolina===
In Graham County, NCDOT has proposed to relocate US 74 onto a new divided four-lane highway from Robbinsville to Stecoah. This new routing will feature controlled at-grade intersections, viaduct and tunnel (at Stecoah Gap). At a cost of $383 million, right-of-way acquisition is scheduled to begin in 2014 and construction to begin in 2016; however, this is subject to reprioritization. The project is part of an overall project to bypass the current routing through the Nantahala Gorge, where bottlenecks are common along the two-lane highway through protected valley area within the Nantahala National Forest. The overall project, from Andrews to Almond, would complete a four-lane expressway from Cherokee County to Asheville.

The portion of US 74 that is concurrent with I-40 near Asheville and I-26 south of Asheville is being improved as part of the Asheville I-26 Connector project and the widening project of I-26 between Hendersonville and Asheville.

===Future interstate corridor (Columbus to Kings Mountain, North Carolina)===
On April 10, 2023, a bill was introduced to further upgrade the entire stretch of US 74 from I-26 in Columbus, and I-85 in Kings Mountain to interstate highway standards. Most of the corridor is already a freeway with the exception of sections in Mooresboro and Shelby in Cleveland County. Currently, a controlled-access highway is being constructed under the designation of US 74 Bypass to bypass Shelby to the north. When completed, it will improve vehicle capacity along the US 74 corridor, reduce future traffic congestion, increase safety and improve roadway continuity between I-26 and I-85. Being built in six sections, the cost is estimated at $295.9 million and has been fully funded. Construction first began on Section AA in July 2013 and was completed in September 2016. The next two sections (AB and B) being started in July 2014 and ending in April 2018; an additional paving project for Section AB (listed as Section F) was completed in 2020 as well. Construction on Section C began in 2017 and is expected to be completed by June 2024. The final design as well as right-of-way purchase for sections D and E are underway and construction of these final sections is expected to begin by the end of 2023 and be completed by 2029.

In Mooresboro, there are plans to convert the last remaining at-grade intersections (US 74 Business/Lattimore Road/Academy Street) into an interchange, as well as improving the bridges over Sandy Run Creek. When the interchange and the rest of the Shelby Bypass are completed, US 74 will become a full freeway between I-26 in Asheville and I-85 in Kings Mountain. The project had been in the State Transportation Improvement Program since 2000, but activities on it were limited until funding was secured in 2018. Public input from the community on these improvements, which gave four alternatives construction plans (1, 1A, 2, and 2A) as well as three options for service roads, was requested from late August to early September 2022. In December 2022, NCDOT announced the findings from the responses given and later stated that they had chosen Alternative 1A. This alternative will transform the US 74 Business/Lattimore Road/Academy Street intersection with a parclo interchange that will include a roundabout on the ramps to and from eastbound lanes. Service road plans were not announced, but public feedback showed almost unanimous support for option 3. Right-of-way acquisition and construction began in 2023.

===Charlotte and Wadesboro===
The Independence Widening project, in Mecklenburg County, is to enhance and improve traffic flow and safety along US 74 in east Charlotte, by converting the corridor into an expressway grade highway from Center City to Matthews. Construction on three new interchanges at Sharon-Amity Road, Idlewild Road and Conference Drive were completed by October 15, 2016, at a cost of $101.2 million. NCDOT is now planning to add two-way grade-separated express lanes to this segment along with converting it to an expressway with additional interchanges as well. Partial funding for part of the project was provided in the NCDOT&#x27;s 2024-2033 State Transportation Improvement Program and right-of-way acquisition is scheduled to start in 2024; construction will begin in 2028.

In Union and Anson counties, the US 74 freeway upgrade and Wadesboro Bypass is an estimated $741 million project. Plans include linking with the Monroe Expressway with the Rockingham Bypass with upgrading to existing facilities to freeway standards and bypass the cities of both Marshville (to the south) and Wadesboro (to the north). The Wadesboro Bypass project remains only partially funded, but it was included in the NCDOT&#x27;s 2024-2033 State Transportation Improvement Program. Feedback from Anson County residents was requested from late-November–December 2023. Currently, the right of way for the project is tentatively scheduled for summer of 2028, with construction on the bypass beginning summer of 2030.

===Interstate 74 upgrades (Rockingham to Bolton, North Carolina)===
The US 74 corridor from Rockingham to Bolton is being upgraded to interstate standards as part of the I-74 extension. Currently, the only segment that has been completed and been officially signed as I-74 is between Maxton and Lumberton. This segment has an interchange with I-95, which meant that it could be signed as an interstate since it connected to the interstate highway system. The other portions of the route are in various stages of planning.

<text>John Dufresne (born January 30, 1948) is an American author of French Canadian descent born in Worcester, Massachusetts. He graduated from Worcester State College in 1970 and the University of Arkansas in 1984. He is a professor in the Master of Fine Arts Creative Writing program of the English Department at Florida International University. In 2012, he won a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship for his work.

==Books==
Dufresne&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Louisiana Power and Light&quot; (1994), was named as one of &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27; notable books of the year, as was his second novel, &quot;Love Warps the Mind a Little&quot; (1997).

Dufresne&#x27;s third novel, &quot;Deep in the Shade of Paradise&quot; (2002), was a Book Sense Top Ten of the Year selection. It contains some of the same characters in &quot;Louisiana Power and Light&quot;, although in an interview with writer Max Ruback, which appeared in the Winter 2001 issue of the literary magazine &quot;Turnrow&quot;, Dufresne has said that he does not consider &quot;Deep in the Shade of Paradise&quot; to be a sequel. Both of these novels, however, developed from a long short story in Dufresne&#x27;s first collection, &quot;The Way that Water Enters Stone&quot; (1991).

Dufresne published a second short story collection, &quot;Johnny Too Bad&quot;, in 2005. The title story of the book had previously been chosen for compilation in &quot;New Stories from the South: The Year&#x27;s Best, 2003&quot;. In 2003, he also published &quot;The Lie That Tells a Truth: A Guide to Writing Fiction&quot;.

Dufresne published a fourth novel, &quot;Requiem, Mass.&quot;, in 2008.

All of his books were published originally by W. W. Norton, which kept them in print except for his first book of short stories, &quot;The Way that Water Enters Stone&quot;. Plume, an imprint of Dutton-Signet, a division of Penguin Books, republished &quot;The Way that Water Enters Stone&quot; as a trade paperback in 1997, but would later be out of print. Plume has also published still-in-print trade paperback editions of &quot;Louisiana Power and Light&quot; (in 1995), &quot;Love Warps the Mind A Little&quot; (in 1998) and &quot;Deep in the Shade of Paradise&quot; (in 2003).

In 1998, Dufresne collaborated with Carl Hiaasen, Dave Barry, Elmore Leonard and nine other South Florida writers on &quot;Naked Came the Manatee&quot;, a detective novel published by Ballantine Books, a division of Random House.

Dufresne&#x27;s short story &quot;This is the Age of Beautiful Death&quot; appears in the online journal &quot;Blackbird&quot;. His essay &quot;To Knit a Knot, Or Knot: A Beginner&#x27;s Yarn&quot; appears in the anthology &quot;Knitting Yarns: Writers on Knitting&quot;, published by W. W. Norton &amp; Company in November 2013.

==Plays and screenplays==
Dufresne&#x27;s screenplay &quot;Freezer Jesus&quot;, based on another story in his first short story collection, won in the Grand Valley State University Summer Film Project&#x27;s 2002 screenwriting contest and was produced that year by the project. The cinematographer, Jack Anderson, has a long list of Hollywood credits. After being selected for several other festivals, it was featured at Saugatuck, Michigan&#x27;s 2006 Waterfront Film Festival.

Dufresne&#x27;s play, &quot;Trailerville&quot;, premiered at the Off-off-Broadway Blue Heron Theatre in 2005.

In the summer of 2007, Grand Valley State University produced the film &quot;To Live and Die In Dixie&quot;, with a screenplay by Dufresne. Jack Anderson was again hired as cinematographer, with Harper Philbin as director. The film was released in 2008.

<doc id="889383" wikidata="Q6335047" url="?curid=889383" title="KNWN (AM)">
<text>KNWN (1000 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Seattle, Washington, and serving the Seattle metropolitan area. Owned by Lotus Communications, the station primarily airs an all-news radio format. It is the local affiliate for ABC News Radio and identifies itself as &quot;Northwest News Radio&quot;.

KNWN is a clear-channel Class A station, broadcasting with 50,000 watts, the maximum power for American AM stations. It is non-directional by day but uses a directional antenna at night to avoid interfering with WMVP in Chicago and XEOY in Mexico City, the two other Class A stations on 1000 AM. Under favorable conditions, KNWN can be heard in the daytime from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Portland, Oregon. At night it can be heard across much of Western North America. The station&#x27;s studios and offices are co-located with former sister station KOMO-TV within KOMO Plaza (formerly Fisher Plaza) in the Lower Queen Anne section of Seattle, directly across the street from the Space Needle. The transmitter is on Vashon Island, off SW 159th Street.

While KNWN primarily runs an all-news format, in the early morning on weekdays it carries two syndicated news programs from Westwood One: &quot;First Light&quot; and &quot;America in the Morning&quot;. Some midday hours feature longer-form interviews and call-ins. On weekends, some hours include shows on money, health and wine, as well as some paid brokered programming.

KNWN&#x27;s programming is simulcast full-time on 97.7 MHz KNWN-FM, licensed to Oakville, Washington, as well as on several FM translator stations.

==History==
===Early years===
In July 1926, KNWN was founded on Harbor Island, as KGFA at 980 kHz, by two owners: Birt F. Fisher, whose lease on Seattle radio station KTCL was about to run out, and the Fisher brothers of Fisher Flouring Mills, who had been on the island since 1911. (The Fisher Brothers and Birt Fisher were not related.) In preparation for the switch to the new station, Birt Fisher changed KTCL&#x27;s call sign to KOMO. In December, his lease ended, and he took the call letters with him to KGFA. KOMO&#x27;s first broadcast on 980 was December 31, 1926. The studios moved to Downtown Seattle in 1927. The station also began a long-running affiliation with NBC Radio that year as well, primarily with the Red Network, but also with the short-lived West Coast NBC Orange Network from 1931 to 1933. Over the following years, KOMO&#x27;s frequency would go from 980 to 1080, back to 980, down to 920, up to 970, then back to 920, and settled at 950 after the NARBA frequency shakeup in 1941.

===1944 call letter swap between KJR and KOMO===
Fisher&#x27;s Blend Station bought NBC Blue Network affiliate KJR from NBC in 1941. However, the August 1941 adoption of the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s &quot;duopoly&quot; rule restricted licensees from operating more than one radio station in a given market, and an attempt by the Fisher family to be granted an exemption was unsuccessful. The Fishers decided to keep the superior frequency of 1000 kHz, but also keep the KOMO call letters that they had held since the 1920s. Thus, on May 6, 1944, KOMO and KJR swapped call letters, with the KOMO call sign moving from 950 kHz to the more desirable 1000 kHz. The next year KJR was sold to Birt F. Fisher, who was, as aforementioned, unrelated to the KOMO owners.

At its new frequency, KOMO began broadcasting with 50,000 watts of power from its current transmitter site on Vashon Island in 1948. New studios at the corner of Fourth and Denny, near what is now the Seattle Center, were dedicated in February 1948 and included space for an expansion into television broadcasting. The cost of the new facility exceeded $1 million.


In 1953, KOMO-TV first signed on the air on Channel 4 as an affiliate of the NBC television network. Channel 4 swapped affiliations with KING-TV in 1958 and joined the ABC television network. KOMO radio followed suit by switching to the ABC radio network the next year.

===Full service formats===
Through the 1940s and 1950s, KOMO carried network dramas, comedies, game shows, soap operas and big band broadcasts, during the Golden Age of Radio. By 1964, old-line network programming had been phased out and KOMO carried a MOR music format. Long-time morning drive personality Larry Nelson began in 1967. By 1971, KOMO went towards an adult contemporary music format. From 1967 to 1978, KOMO was the original flagship station of the Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association with Bob Blackburn on play-by-play. Norm Gregory, formerly of KJR and KZOK-FM, joined the staff as an afternoon disk jockey in 1984. KOMO carried a full-service schedule of adult contemporary music, personality, news, talk, and Washington Huskies sports well into the early 1990s. It played more music than most full-service AM radio stations throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Until 1993, the station was playing music in all dayparts, with local newscasts every hour. In the fall of 1993, evening talk programming was added. Dayparts gradually changed from music to talk and by the spring of 1996, the conversion to news-talk was complete.

In January 1981, former FM rock Programmer Ken Kohl joined KOMO. When Kohl arrived, the station&#x27;s ratings were in the middle of the pack. After building the station&#x27;s news commitment and implementing KOMO&#x27;s first major marketing effort, Kohl and his KOMO team inched to within a tenth of a point of market leader KIRO. In January 1987, Kohl departed Seattle for KFI in Los Angeles. For the next several years, KOMO unsuccessfully attempted to directly compete with market leader KIRO. Following an outcry from loyal fans following his firing at KIRO-FM (&quot;The Buzz 100.7&quot;) in 1999, local comedian Pat Cashman took over as KOMO&#x27;s morning drive host, with Dr. Laura added for middays.

===All-news format, change to KNWN===
In late 2002, Fisher Communications announced a six-year contract for Seattle Mariners play-by-play rumored to be worth at least $10 million annually, a record for any Major League Baseball radio broadcast agreement, which started in the 2003 season. After the agreement expired in 2008, Mariners broadcasts returned to KIRO.

Concurrent with the acquisition of the Mariners broadcast rights, KOMO dropped its talk shows and became an all-news station with reports from an enlarged radio news staff and material from KOMO-TV newscasts. Some notable anchors include Bill Yeend, Manda Factor, Brian Calvert (who also works as a reporter and weathercaster on KOMO-TV), Lisa Brooks, Bill Rice, Art Sanders, Nancy Barrick, Pamela McCall, and Eric Slocum. It was announced on May 11, 2009, that KOMO would be simulcast on KFMY, an FM station in Oakville, Washington, starting on May 15, 2009. KFMY changed its call letters to KOMO-FM on May 18, 2009, to reflect the simulcast. The move was made to improve KOMO&#x27;s coverage in the southern part of the market, as well as give listeners who prefer the sound of FM that option.

On April 11, 2013, after 87 years of owning the station, Fisher Communications announced that it would sell its properties, including KOMO, to the Sinclair Broadcast Group. Although Sinclair primarily owns television stations, the company initially retained KOMO and Fisher&#x27;s two other Seattle radio stations, KVI and KPLZ-FM. The deal was completed on August 8, 2013. Two months after the sale, several radio employees were laid off as part of general cutbacks by Sinclair at most of the stations they acquired from Fisher.

On June 3, 2021, Sinclair announced they would sell KOMO-AM-FM, KVI, and KPLZ to Lotus Communications for $18 million. Of the $18 million, $5 million was in cash paid at closing; the remainder was Lotus&#x27; choice of either cash or advertising for Sinclair properties on Lotus&#x27; stations. Sinclair retained KOMO-TV, as well as rights to the KOMO call letters. Lotus and Sinclair also agreed to allow Lotus to use Sinclair equipment and IT systems, including sub-leasing the current KOMO studios, for 18 months following the sale; with it, KOMO-TV and KOMO-AM-FM were separated after 68 years. The sale was completed on September 28, 2021.

As required by the terms of the sale, KOMO&#x27;s call sign was changed to KNWN (for &quot;Northwest News&quot;) on February 2, 2022. The KNWN call sign is solely used for hourly station identifications, with the station primarily branding itself as &quot;Northwest News Radio&quot;. Program director and afternoon co-anchor Rick Van Cise told the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; that there would be no programming changes accompanying the rebranding, and that KNWN would maintain its partnership with KOMO-TV. During the week preceding the relaunch, competitor KIRO-FM began promoting itself as &quot;Your Northwest News Station&quot;.

==Marketing slogans==

Early 1970s: &quot;From the Olympics to the Cascades, from Vancouver (B.C., Canada) to Vancouver (Washington), this is KOMO Radio 1000!&quot;

(also) &quot;You&#x27;re in KOMO Country&quot;. Slogan was used with a heavily orchestrated instrumental jingle package from a Canadian studio. The package was called &quot;Big Timber&quot;, and was commissioned exclusively for KOMO.

Early 1980s: &quot;A taste of what you&#x27;re living for, KOMO AM 1000, Seattle!&quot;

Early 1990s: &quot;The station you depend on!&quot;

2002–2005, 2006-2007: &quot;First For Local News, Traffic and Weather.&quot; Similar to KOMO-TV&#x27;s past slogan of &quot;First 4 Local News&quot;.

2005–2006: &quot;The commuter&#x27;s best friend.&quot;

2007–2009: &quot;The Northwest&#x27;s News, Traffic and Weather Station.&quot;

2009–2014: &quot;Everything you need to know.&quot;

2011–2012: &quot;Western Washington&#x27;s News, Traffic and Weather Station.&quot;

2012–2014: &quot;What happens next, happens here.&quot;

2014–present: &quot;Stay connected. Stay informed.&quot;

2016–2022: &quot;Stay connected. Stay informed. Stay on time.&quot;

<doc id="889385" wikidata="Q588294" url="?curid=889385" title="KCRW">
<text>KCRW (89.9 FM) is an NPR member station broadcasting from the campus of Santa Monica College in Santa Monica, California, where the station is licensed. KCRW airs original news and music programming in addition to programming from NPR and other affiliates. A network of repeaters and broadcast translators, as well as internet radio, allows the station to serve the Greater Los Angeles area and other communities in Southern California. The station&#x27;s main transmitter is located in Los Angeles&#x27;s Laurel Canyon district, adjacent to Mulholland Drive at the end of Briarcrest Road, and broadcasts in the HD radio format. It is one of two full NPR members in the Los Angeles area; Pasadena-based KPCC is the other.

==History==
KCRW was founded in 1945 to train servicemen returning from World War II in the then-new technology, FM broadcasting—hence its call letters, which stand for College Radio Workshop. It was a charter member of NPR in 1970, making Santa Monica College the second community college to own a public radio or television station.

===Ruth Seymour===
Former KPFK program director Ruth Seymour became general manager in 1978 and retired in February 2010. Born Ruth Epstein to Russian-Polish Jewish immigrants, she grew up in the East Bronx, studied at Sholem Aleichem Folk School and the City College of New York, and married and divorced Jack Hirschman, adopting the name of her paternal great-grandfather in 1993 to become Ruth Hirschman Seymour. She developed a mix of music, news, and other spoken-word programming that now attracts over 500,000 listeners each week. She was also known for a feisty temperament and a spur-of-the-moment style that led to the nickname &quot;Lady of the Iron Whim.&quot;

===Jennifer Ferro===
The current general manager is Jennifer Ferro. Ferro is also the President of the KCRW Foundation, which provides financial support and other resources to ensure that KCRW can maintain and expand its mission consistent with economic, social and technological developments. The KCRW Foundation board of directors is composed of business and community leaders; Monica J. Shilling, a partner at Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP, serves as chair.

The station airs programs from NPR, Public Radio International (PRI), American Public Media, and the BBC, a range of music programs and live in-studio performances, and locally produced news and culture programs. KCRW also airs programming created through their&quot; Independent Producer Project,&quot; a project KCRW created to support &quot;the work of independent contributors,&quot; which includes programs like Strangers, UnFictional, and SoundsLA. The station has three live program streams—&quot;On Air,&quot; &quot;Eclectic 24&quot; and &quot;News 24&quot;—and on-demand listening through the KCRW apps and podcasts.

In August 2013, KCRW released a new logo and brand design created by Los Angeles–based branding agency Troika Design Group.

==Programming==
KCRW is an affiliate of NPR. Music programming includes the station&#x27;s music program &quot;Morning Becomes Eclectic&quot;.

Warren Olney hosts the station&#x27;s news and public affairs programs, &quot;To the Point&quot; (nationally distributed by Public Radio International).

KCRW covers the Southern California film industry with programs including &quot;The Business&quot; with Kim Masters, &quot;The Treatment&quot; with Elvis Mitchell, &quot;Martini Shot&quot; with Rob Long, and film reviews from Pulitzer Prize winning &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; film critic Joe Morgenstern.

Music programs feature an eclectic array of songs from around the globe, particularly on the daily music program &quot;Morning Becomes Eclectic&quot; and the daytime weekend line-up. At night, music such as house, progressive, and electronic dance music are the main styles on shows formerly known as &quot;Metropolis&quot; and &quot;Nocturna&quot;. KCRW dropped all program names except &quot;Morning Becomes Eclectic&quot; and &quot;Strictly Jazz&quot; in 2008. Three of the station&#x27;s previous music directors currently have programs on the air at KCRW.

Local and regional touring artists can send recordings to KCRW for consideration of airplay.

KCRW airs Santa Monica City Council meetings live when they are held. Because of the nature of the repeater network, Santa Monica City Council meetings can be heard throughout the Southern California region reaching out to approximately 150 mi (240 km).
Before its current host, Evan Kleiman, took over as host, the KCRW show &quot;Good Food&quot; was parodied on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in a recurring character sketch series, &quot;Delicious Dish&quot;, with Ana Gasteyer and Molly Shannon.

Since 2013, KCRW has put on the annual Radio Race, a 24-hour competition in which participants can write, record, and edit a nonfiction radio story. &quot;Here Be Monsters&quot;, a podcast about fears and the unknown, got its start on KCRW after winning Radio Race.

== Programs, a selected table ==
==Influence and accolades==
KCRW&#x27;s flagship program is &quot;Morning Becomes Eclectic&quot;, a three-hour daily music program that has aired for more than 30 years. Historically, the show host is also the station&#x27;s music director. Isabel Holt created the show in 1978. Tom Schnabel hosted the show from 1979 to 1990. In November 1990, Chris Douridas took over the show, hosting until April 1998. Nic Harcourt was in the seat from 1998 until December 1, 2008, coming from WDST FM 100.1 in Woodstock, N.Y. At WDST Harcourt successfully transitioned a traditional Triple A station to a cutting-edge trendsetting Alternative station in the shadow of New York City. Longtime KCRW DJ Jason Bentley, known for his &quot;Metropolis&quot; nighttime avant garde dance program, is the former host and music director. That position (morning host and MD respectively) will be split in two on August 30, 2019, with Bentley relinquishing both duties after 10 years, but will continue hosting &quot;Metropolis&quot;.

KCRW has given initial exposure to artists such as Coldplay, Norah Jones, Sigur Ros, Damien Rice, David Gray and Lorde. KCRW programming has won numerous awards and accolades, including the Golden Pylon Award in 2011 and 2014, a PRNDI Award in 2013 and 2014, The Edward R. Murrow Award in 2014 and 2015, the Webby Award in 2015, an APTRA Award in 2015, The Gracie Award in 2016, and seven first place awards from the Los Angeles Press Club for the year of 2015.

Several hosts have extended their careers into music supervision for both film and television, including Chris Douridas (&quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;Shrek 2&quot; and &quot;House of Lies&quot;), Liza Richardson (&quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; and &quot;The Kids Are All Right&quot;), and Gary Calamar, the music supervisor for HBO&#x27;s &quot;True Blood&quot; and &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;.

Streaming media is now prominent at the station, which streams thousands of hours of content each week. KCRW provides three different live streams: the live broadcast, a 24-hour music service, and a 24-hour news service. Streams are available through web browsers, with alternate streams offered using the PLS file format, which can be played using software such as iTunes, Winamp and RealPlayer. The music service and news service are also included as channels in AOL Radio. The station also archives its talk and music programs for listeners to stream at their convenience, and offers podcasts of in-studio performance and talk programs.

KCRW has members across the country and the station regularly sponsors live music events throughout the United States and in Canada.

In a 2021 &quot;L.A. Podcast&quot; interview, former staffer Cerise Castle accused the station of &quot;microaggressions, gaslighting, and blatant racism.&quot; The station investigated the accusations with the help of a law firm. In a statement, the station said: &quot;Ultimately, several of the claims were found to be unsubstantiated or not corroborated. But we take all claims very seriously.&quot;

==Events==
KCRW promotes a great deal of live music events nationally, featuring both established and emerging artists. In April 2011, KCRW promoted and sponsored the controversial graffiti exhibit entitled &quot;Art in the Streets&quot; at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MoCA). The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported an increase in tagging around MoCA after the exhibit opened to the public.

==Stations==
KCRW programming is relayed by five full-power stations. However, KERW—serving San Luis Obispo—is a full-time HD1 simulcast partner with KCRW-HD2&#x27;s &quot;Eclectic 24&quot; music programming. &quot;Eclectic 24&quot; is heard on the HD2 signals of the four other stations, as it does on KCRW itself.

The call letters of KCRI, KCRU, KCRY, and KDRW are identified at the top of each hour alongside those of KCRW, as are the frequencies of those stations and their transmitters.

KCRW also directly feeds three low-power translators, while other stations feed four additional translators.

KCRW also has applications pending for new translators on 88.5 in Mojave, 89.9 in Temecula, 90.1 in Baker, 90.3 FM in Barstow, and 105.7 FM in Julian.

Previous translators (now off the air and licenses returned to the FCC) operated on 88.3 FM in Palmdale, 89.1 FM in Camarillo, 90.9 FM in Palm Springs, and 100.1 in China Lake. Another former translator, K296AI, was the only KCRW translator not owned by the station. It is operated by Indian Wells Valley TV Booster, Inc., which also operates translators that rebroadcast Los Angeles–area television stations in the Ridgecrest area. That translator currently rebroadcasts KMZT.

In February 2014, KCRW announced that it would buy Santa Barbara station KDB (93.7 FM), currently a classical music station, for $1 million. The transaction will allow KCRW to begin using another Santa Barbara station, KQSC (88.7 FM) as a repeater for KCRW&#x27;s programming, while transferring KUSC&#x27;s classical programming from KQSC to KDB, thereby preserving KDB&#x27;s role as Santa Barbara&#x27;s classical station.

===KCRW Berlin===
On September 13, 2017, partner station, KCRW Berlin, was awarded a broadcast license in Berlin, Germany, on 104.1 MHz. This license and frequency had previously been held by NPR Berlin. The station has a website at kcrwberlin.com.

KCRW Berlin ceased broadcasting on December 13, 2020, due to the economic disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

===Tennessee===

In the state of Tennessee, US-76 is an arterial road that travels east-southeast from Downtown Chattanooga to East Ridge and south to the Georgia state line. US-76 travels concurrent with US-41 for its entire length in Tennessee, about .

===Georgia===

In Georgia, US 76 traverses the northern part of the state and passes through the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest and Georgia&#x27;s most mountainous region. US 76 passes through Catoosa, Whitfield, Murray, Gilmer, Fannin, Union, Towns, and Rabun counties.

===South Carolina===
US 76 enters South Carolina across the Chattooga River, then continues southeast toward Westminster. This segment is a moderately windy two-lane road. In Westminster, it heads east toward Seneca and Clemson. From Clemson, the road heads southeast toward Anderson, intersecting Interstate 85 (I-85), then east toward the small towns of Belton and Honea Path. US 76 is a four-lane highway from Westminster to Anderson. In Anderson, the road widens to six lanes with a reversible turn lane. After a concurrency with US 178, the road narrows to five lanes, and, as it goes south towards downtown Anderson, it narrows again to four. However, the sections around Seneca, Clemson, and Anderson are well developed with many traffic lights. It travels concurrent with US 123 from Westminster to Clemson, SC 28 from Seneca to Anderson, and US 178 from Anderson to Honea Path.

From Honea Path, the highway heads east to Laurens. This section is a rural two-lane road that is not frequently traveled. From Laurens, US 76 roughly parallels I-385 and I-26 as it heads to Columbia. US 76 provides local access to the communities of Laurens, Clinton, Newberry, Prosperity, Chapin, and the other smaller towns in the area. In Irmo, US 76 travels concurrent with US 176, then continues on to I-26, with which it travels concurrently. After the interchange with I-20, US 76 splits off from I-26 and continues into downtown Columbia concurrent with I-126.

In Columbia, US 76 follows Elmwood Avenue, Bull Street, Gervais Street, Millwood Avenue, and Devine Street before heading east toward Sumter. The segment from Columbia to Sumter is a four-lane highway and US 76 is concurrent with US 378 from the intersection of Bull and Gervais near the University of South Carolina in Columbia to Sumter. From Sumter, US 76 heads northeast to Florence. US  76 is the major road through Florence. It then continues east out of Florence to the small towns of Marion and Mullins, then into North Carolina. The highway is concurrent with US 301 from Florence to across the Pee Dee River.

===North Carolina===


The highway passes through Fair Bluff and becomes concurrent with US 74 from Chadbourn to Wilmington. The highway is mostly four lanes, divided with at-grade and controlled intersections. The speed limit is from to . It crosses the Cape Fear Memorial Bridge into Wilmington and continues to Wrightsville Beach via Oleander Drive to the route&#x27;s eastern terminus. US 76 traverses in North Carolina; approximately concurrent with US 74, between Chadbourn and Wilmington.
==History==

A significant section of US 76 was relocated in Georgia during the 1980s with the old alignment decommissioned first in 1982 from the Hemptown community in Fannin County westward and eastward into Union County in 1988. Extending from west of Blue Ridge to Blairsville, the stretch of road today is known as Blue Ridge Highway and Old Highway 76 including the city of Morganton. In Morganton, the stretch is joined briefly by SR 60, and, in Blairsville, a small portion of the route is unofficially part of US 19/US 129. This old alignment from Blairsville to Blue Ridge is approximately long and has some of Georgia&#x27;s most scenic views along its eastern end. This stretch was formerly part of SR 2, as well.

US 76 also has other old alignments in Ellijay (by-passed in 1982), Cherry Log, Whitepath (both bypassed in 1989) and south of Blue Ridge (by-passed in 1965). US 76 was also relocated from present-day SR 52 from Ellijay to Chatsworth in 1981 to a less treacherous course along SR 282. Significant curve realignments also occurred along the previously serpentine section from Hiawassee to Clayton from 1988 to 2005. Today, US 76 shares mileage with SR 5, SR 515, SR 282, SR 61, SR 52, SR 17, SR 75, SR 15, and SR 3, in addition to SR 2. U.S. highways with common mileage include US 411, US 41, US 441, and US 23.

Formerly, US 76 followed a longer route from Westminster to Pendleton. From Westminster, the old route followed S-37-13 through the Richland community, then its current alignment to SC 59 into downtown Seneca, then SC 130 out of Seneca to S-37-1, then its current alignment to SC 93 toward Clemson University, then SC 28 Business through Pendleton.

US 76 did not appear in North Carolina until late 1934 into 1935. It replaced NC 202 and US 17 from the South Carolina border to Chadbourn, US 17 and NC 20 to Wilmington and NC 20 to Wrightsville Beach. The original US 76 followed the current alignment of the road from the South Carolina state line to Chadbourn. US 76 then followed NC 214 north of Lake Waccamaw and through Bolton. It then followed the current alignment to Leland. US 76 then used Office Road, Lincoln Road, Old Mill Road, to get to Village Road NE. US 76 then used the closed causeway to cross the Brunswick River. From Belville US 76 used NC 133 routing to cross the Cape Fear and NE Cape Fear River&#x27;s. US 76 then went down 3rd Street to Market Street and then followed 17th Street to Oleander Drive. US 76 then used Arlie Road to where US 76 currently crosses into Wrightsville Beach. US 76 then turned north on Lumina Avenue to the current end point of US 74. In 1936 US 74/US 76 was given a short bypass around Leland using Village Road. The old part became US 74-A. In 1940, US 76 was removed off the routing along Lumina Avenue and was instead routed south along Waynick Drive to the southern part of the island. Sometime between 1959 and 1962, US 76 was removed off Arlie Drive, and instead, US 76 followed Oleander Drive all the way to Causeway Drive. In 1966, US 76 was moved onto split roads along both 16th and 17th streets in downtown Wilmington. In 1969, US 76 was redirected to use a new bridge to cross the Cape Fear River into Wilmington. US 76 would also now use Dawson and Wooster Streets through downtown Wilmington. In 1975, US 76 and US 74 were placed on a new freeway that bypassed both Leland and Belville; along with that, US 76 was placed on a new freeway that bypassed Chadbourn. Between 1986 and 1987, US 76 was placed on a bypass of Hallsboro and Lake Waccamaw. Around 1992, US 76 was routed to bypass Bolton leaving behind NC 214. In 2003, US 76 was moved onto Military Cutoff Road instead of being on Wrightsville Avenue.

<text>Charles Marcil, (July 1, 1860 – January 29, 1937) was a longtime member of the House of Commons of Canada and served as Speaker of the House from 1909 to 1911.

He was first elected to the House of Commons as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1900 election and represented the riding of Bonaventure Quebec in the Gaspé Peninsula without interruption until his death in 1937.

Marcil was born to a French-Canadian father and Irish mother. His father&#x27;s family settled in New France around 1665.

Growing up in the Ottawa-Hull area, he served as a House of Commons page, then went on to work as a journalist for the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; and several other newspapers.

Marcil ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Quebec Liberal Party in the 1897 provincial election before winning a seat in the federal parliament in 1900.

He worked hard to obtain projects for his community including the construction of bridges, lighthouses and the establishment of a ferry service.

Marcil was nominated for the position of Speaker by Wilfrid Laurier following the 1908 election. Despite initial opposition by Ontario Tories, he was unanimously elected to the position.

He was a popular Speaker and might have continued through a second Parliament had the Liberals not been defeated in the 1911 election. He returned to the backbenches, and concurrently was elected to sit on Montreal&#x27;s city council as an alderman in 1918 while remaining an MP.

From 1921 to 1931, he served as Chairman of the Liberal caucus in Ottawa. He was Dean of the House from 1930 to his death in 1937.

Charles Marcil was not the only member of his family to be involved in politics. In the late 19th Century, his uncle Doctor David Marsil was mayor of Saint-Eustache, Quebec from 1871 to 1875 and appointed to the Legislative Council of Quebec in 1888. Charles Marcil&#x27;s brother Georges was the last mayor of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, before the city was annexed to Montreal in 1910. Georges&#x27; granddaughter Susie Marcil was married to Daniel Johnson, Premier of Quebec in 1994.

Another notable relative was Charles Marcil&#x27;s maternal uncle, Edward P. Doherty, an American Civil War officer who formed and led the detachment of soldiers that captured and killed John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of United States President Abraham Lincoln.

<text>Gilbert J. Clarke (born August 17, 1962) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter and record producer. He is known for having a three-year tenure as the rhythm guitarist of Guns N&#x27; Roses, replacing Izzy Stradlin in 1991 during the Use Your Illusion Tour, and also featured on &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot; (1993). Following this, Clarke went on to forge a solo career as well playing guitar with Slash&#x27;s Snakepit, Kat Men, Heart, Nancy Sinatra, Kathy Valentine (of The Go-Go&#x27;s), MC5 and forming his own group Rock Star Supernova with members of Metallica and Mötley Crüe.

Clarke&#x27;s production work includes albums by L.A. Guns, Bullets and Octane, The Bronx, Frankie and the Studs and Vains of Jenna.

==Career==

=== 1985–1991: Early career ===
Gilby Clarke started his musical career during the first half of the Eighties, replacing Candy&#x27;s original guitarist, Geoff Siegel, who later played with the Nymphs. Gilby eventually replaced the band&#x27;s lead vocalist and penned several unreleased fan favorites including, &quot;Dance America&quot;. He left them to form Kill for Thrills, a metal band which released the EP &quot;Commercial Suicide&quot; and the LP &quot;Dynamite from Nightmareland&quot; before eventually disbanding. 
Kill for Thrills was a supergroup of sorts with Jason Nesmith (son of former Monkees Mike Nesmith) on Guitar, and Todd Muscat formerly of seminal L.A. Punk band Decry, on Bass and then later with Junkyard after Kill for Thrills. Muscat is also the brother of Brent Muscat (Faster Pussycat, L.A. Guns, Sin City Sinners). All members have deep roots in the Los Angeles rock scene.

=== 1991–1994: Guns N&#x27; Roses ===

Following rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin&#x27;s decision to abruptly quit the band, during Use Your Illusion Tour in 1991, citing a combination of Axl Rose&#x27;s personal behavior (he would consistently delay the start of shows by hours at a time) and his mismanagement of the band and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan due to his new-found sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions, Clarke was chosen as his replacement, playing out the rest of gigs of the tour which lasted until 1993. His first show with the band was December 5, 1991 in Worcester, MA, USA.

During many shows throughout the tour, Rose introduced Clarke and had him play &quot;Wild Horses&quot;, a Rolling Stones cover with Slash.

On November 23, 1993, Guns N&#x27; Roses released a collection of punk and glam rock covers entitled &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot; where many of the tracks were recorded with original Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin during the &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; sessions and then were later re-recorded by Clarke.

Clarke&#x27;s contract was not renewed and he was gone from the band by 1995. Slash stated in his book that Rose fired Clarke without consulting anyone, claiming he was only a &quot;hired hand&quot;. Clarke was not involved in the recording of &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, stating &quot;I knew that that was the ending [of Clarke&#x27;s involvement in Guns N&#x27; Roses] because nobody told me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me&quot;. Clarke also mentioned that before the final show of the &quot;Use Your Illusion Tour&quot;, Rose came up to him and told him &quot;Hey, enjoy your last show&quot;. Clarke later sued the band over the use of his likeness in Guns N&#x27; Roses Pinball.

Clarke&#x27;s only other appearances on a Guns N&#x27; Roses release would be on the live and compilation albums &quot;Live Era &#x27;87–&#x27;93&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

Clarke is featured on Guns N&#x27; Roses video releases &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot;, &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Videos&quot;.

===1994–1996: &quot;Pawnshop Guitars&quot; &amp; Slash&#x27;s Snakepit===

In 1994, he released his debut solo album &quot;Pawnshop Guitars&quot; on Virgin Records which featured contributions from several of his close friends. Ryan Roxie (Alice Cooper) on guitar, Will Effertz on Bass and Marc Danzeisen (Riverdogs, Little Caesar) Drums and backing vocals, also including all the then members of Guns N&#x27; Roses. It went gold in Argentina.
Following the end of the Use Your Illusion Tour in 1993, Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash began recording demos of material that he had written during the tour, at his home studio with bandmate Matt Sorum. Clarke and Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez soon started to come around to jam with them. They eventually recorded twelve demo songs. Eric Dover, live guitarist for Jellyfish, successfully auditioned to become the group&#x27;s singer. Slash and Dover wrote the lyrics for all the tracks, except &quot;Monkey Chow&quot; which was contributed by Clarke and &quot;Jizz da Pit&quot; which is an instrumental written by both Slash and Inez. The album was released by Geffen Records in February 1995 charting at No. 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. For the tour in support of the album, James LoMenzo and Brian Tichy, both members of Zakk Wylde&#x27;s solo band, joined the band to replace Inez and Sorum who could not tour with the group due to other commitments. With Guns N&#x27; Roses regrouping to record a new album, Snakepit disbanded with Clarke resuming his solo career.

===1997-2006: Solo career and new projects===

Since then he has released another three solo albums, &quot;The Hangover&quot;, &quot;Rubber&quot; and 2002&#x27;s &quot;Swag&quot; as well as the live album &quot;99 Live&quot;.

He formed the band Col. Parker with ex-Stray Cat Slim Jim Phantom and former touring additional GN&#x27;R keyboardist Teddy &quot;Zig Zag&quot; Andreadis, releasing the album &quot;Rock N Roll Music&quot; in 2001.

In addition, he made a guest appearance on the L.A. Guns album &quot;Shrinking Violet&quot;, which he also produced. Clarke also produced The Bronx&#x27;s self-titled album released in 2003 and Girlsplayboys debut album &quot;From Ritual to Romance&quot; in 2006, and L.A. Guns&#x27; 2001 album &quot;Man in the Moon&quot;.

In 2002, Clarke worked with Nancy Sinatra on her album &quot;California Girl&quot; and a year later joined Heart on their national tour.

In 2005, he played along with the reformed MC5, joining original members Wayne Kramer, Dennis Thompson, and Michael Davis, along with new vocalist Handsome Dick Manitoba.

=== 2006–2012: Rock Star Supernova and reunion with GNR on Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ===
In 2006, Mötley Crüe drummer, Tommy Lee, formed Supernova with Clarke on guitars and former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted. The band used the TV show &quot;Rock Star&quot; to find a new lead singer. Lukas Rossi was chosen as their lead singer. However, there was already a band from California called Supernova. On June 26, 2006, the California band filed a federal lawsuit and on September 12, 2006, U.S. District Judge John A. Houston in San Diego ruled in favor of the original Supernova, granting their request for a preliminary injunction. The injunction stopped the band from &quot;Rock Star: Supernova&quot; from &quot;performing rock and roll music, or recording, or selling rock and roll music recordings under the same name, pending a trial of this action on its merits, or until otherwise ordered by the court.&quot; The band renamed itself Rock Star Supernova.

Clarke produced a cover of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; on &quot;Rock Star: Supernova&quot; runner-up Dilana Robichaux&#x27;s 2007 album, also released as a single on digital download websites.

In 2007 he released a best of album featuring tracks from all of his solo albums as well as two songs from the Col. Parker project and a rerecording of the song &quot;Black&quot;, featuring vocals by Dilana.

In July 2008 Clarke played at the G-TARanaki Guitar Festival in New Zealand. His solo band included bassist Muddy Stardust and drummer Dennis Morehouse. He then toured North America as part of the Rock n&#x27; Roll Fantasy Camp.

Clarke reunited with Guns N&#x27; Roses members Slash, Steven Adler, Matt Sorum and Duff McKagan, during the live performance, at the band&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction on April 14, 2012. Clarke himself was not inducted as part of the band.

===2021-present: &quot;The Gospel Truth&quot; and touring===
In 2021 Clarke released his most successful album to date, &quot;The Gospel Truth&quot; on Golden Robot Records. It featured a host of well-known musicians including Nikki Sixx.

<text>The Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (, UFRGS) is a Brazilian public federal research university based in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. UFRGS is among the largest and highest-rated universities in Brazil, having one of the largest number of scientific publications. From 2012 to 2019, the university was elected as the best federal university of Brazil. UFRGS has over 31,000 undergraduate students, over 12,000 graduate students, and more than 2,600 faculty members. As a Brazilian public federal institution, students do not pay tuition fees to enroll in courses offered by the university.

Among the main alumni affiliated with UFRGS, there are three former presidents of Brazil, former state governors, former members of the Supreme Federal Court, members of the Brazilian Academy of Letters and important Brazilian actors, musicians and journalists.

==History==
The university originated from the &quot;Escola de Farmácia e Química&quot; (School of Pharmacy and Chemistry) in 1895. It was expanded in 1896, when the Engineering College was created. This was the beginning of higher education in Rio Grande do Sul. In the end of the 19th century, the Medicine and Law schools were founded, the latter being the first school of humanities tertiary education in the state.

In November 1934, the &quot;Universidade de Porto Alegre&quot; (University of Porto Alegre) was founded, initially composed of the following units:

* Engineering School, with its Astronomy, Electrical and Industrial Chemistry institutes;
* Medical College, with its Dentistry and Pharmacy institutes;
* Law College, with the School of Commerce;
* Communication College (called FABICO), which comprises the Journalism, Advertising and Public Relations programs;
* Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine Colleges;
* Philosophy, Science and Linguistics Colleges; and
* Institute of Fine Arts

The third transformation took place in 1947, when it became the &quot;Universidade do Rio Grande do Sul&quot; (University of Rio Grande do Sul), URGS, incorporating the Law and Dentistry Colleges from Pelotas and with the Pharmacy College from Santa Maria. These units, however, separated from URGS when the Federal University of Pelotas and the Federal University of Santa Maria were founded.

In December 1950, control of the university passed to the Federal Government. After that, the name of the institution became &quot;Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul&quot; (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul).
The institute also has a profound political history. Between 1964 and 1969, during the worst years of the military dictatorship, 33 professors were eliminated, as well as a good number of students. Many high-ranking officials, including three presidents - Getúlio Vargas, João Goulart and Dilma Rousseff - as well as the majority of the history, philosophy and social sciences teachers in smaller universities throughout the state were educated in the institution. The climate of intellectual debate and analysis of public issues has also been important in training students (often with scholarships and/or student apprenticeships) to work for non-governmental and governmental organisations which contribute to the critical reflection and planning of development programs.

==Organization==

UFRGS is almost completely located in Porto Alegre, with four campuses: &quot;Campus Centro&quot; (Downtown Campus), &quot;Campus Saúde&quot; (Health Sciences Campus), &quot;Campus Olímpico&quot; (Olympic Campus, housing the School of Physical Education, Physiotherapy and Dance) and &quot;Campus do Vale&quot; (Vale Campus), a few off-campus buildings (including the Business School and the Institute of Arts) and units in other cities, such as the Agriculture Experimental Station and the Campus Litoral Norte (a new campus in the state&#x27;s northeastern coastal city of Tramandaí).

===Infrastructure===

Offering graduate and undergraduate courses, UFRGS is the largest university of Rio Grande do Sul. Its more than 300 buildings accommodate 29 faculties, schools and institutes, which are divided into 94 departments.

The university spreads through 2,185 ha, and it has 402,000 m2 of constructed area. It is divided into four campuses and minor units (see above).

The undergraduate program&#x27;s students make up for a population of about 31 thousand students, while the graduate program has 12 thousand students. The elementary, high-school and technical school sum up to 1,300 students.

The university&#x27;s infrastructure comprises more than 500 laboratories, 33 libraries, 37 lecture halls, the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (the university&#x27;s clinical research hospital), UFRGS Press, UFRGS Museum, Botanical Garden, Broadcasting Center, Observatory, 3 buildings for Campus Accommodation, 5 refectories, 2 summer camps and several other centers and facilities.

===Other units===

====SECOM====

SECOM is an executive office of UFRGS directly connected to the Central Administration&#x27;s cabinet – as well as to other sectors and the Provosts&#x27; Offices. SECOM defines the communication policies and strategies employed by UFRGS, facilitating services inside the university through the creation of informative and institutional materials. Its goal is to promote new activities and establish initiatives which recognize and publicize the institution&#x27;s potential. Some of its sections are the university newspaper, TV channel and radio station.

====Hospital====


UFRGS university hospital is located in the centre of Porto Alegre.

==Research==

;Undergraduate Research Grant Program

The objective of the Undergraduate Research Internship Program is to integrated students from undergraduate courses into research activities, technological development and, innovation. Besides contributing for students’ academic and professional growth, the program also offers the opportunity to take part in the community of the university researchers fostering dialogue between undergraduate and graduate programs.

;Research Promotion Program

The research promotion program has as goal to support the continuity of research projects, the organization of events and the qualification of technical and administrative personnel, besides stimulating the national and international exposure of works made in research by professors, technical and administrative personnel, and students.

;Science in Society and Science in School Program

This program has the compromise of stimulating university developed projects which are turned to popularization and spreading of science and technology in a variety of social groups and in school environment, through participation of UFRGS undergraduate students, in activities which enable the permanent development of human capital in these areas.

;Journal Editing Supporting Program

The Journal Editing Supporting Program implements ways of support and stimulus for journal editing at UFRGS. Its objective is to grant visibility to scientific periodicals of the institution.

==Admission==

Students are accepted through the vestibular, which is an open examination where the top-placed candidates are offered a placement at the university. Since UFRGS is free of charge, the Vestibular is usually a very hard examination since there are many candidates for few open placements. Examinations take place in January and classes begin in March.

===ENEM===

The Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, as well as the other Brazilian federal universities, adopted the National High School Examination (ENEM) in 2010 as a standard of admission. The applicants’ participation in ENEM is optative. Initially, their performances in the examination were analyzed together with their performances in the university entrance exam, comprehending 10% of the final grade. However, as of 2019, UFRGS decided to withdraw the sum of 10% in the final score, having only vacancies through the National High School Exam (30%) and/or through the Vestibular (70%).

==Quality of education==

According to the ranking sponsored by the Ministry of Education (MEC, Ministério da Educação), UFRGS is Brazil&#x27;s best university (in a ranking which doesn&#x27;t include Universidade de São Paulo—see rankings of universities in Brazil for details). According to the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities in 2012, UFRGS was placed 71st worldwide.

<text>The 78th Training Division (Operations) (&quot;Lightning&quot;) is a unit of the United States Army which served in World War I and World War II as the 78th Infantry Division, and currently trains and evaluates units of the United States Army Reserve for deployment.

==World War I==


The 78th Division of the United States Army was constituted on 5 August 1917 and activated on 23 August 1917, over four months after the American entry into World War I, at Camp Dix, New Jersey. It consisted of four infantry regiments: the 309th, 310th, 311th and 312th; and three artillery Regiments: the 307th, 308th and 309th.

The division was originally allocated to New York and northern Pennsylvania in the National Army recruiting plan. While the headquarters of the 78th Division was activated in August, with the first draftees arriving in September, it was not fully active until early 1918. After several more months of training, the 78th was transported to France in May and June 1918.

In France, during the summer and fall of 1918, it was the &quot;point of the wedge&quot; of the final offensive which knocked out Germany. The 78th was in three major campaigns during World War I – Meuse-Argonne, St. Mihiel, and Lorraine. The division was demobilized on 9 July 1919 at Camp Dix, New Jersey.

*Activated: 27 August 1917.
*Overseas: May 1918.
*Major Operations: Meuse-Argonne, St. Mihiel.
*Roll of Honor: two Medal of Honor recipients
*Casualties: Total-7,144 (KIA-1,169; WIA-5,975).

==Interwar period==

The division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Second Corps Area, and assigned to the XII Corps with the state of New Jersey as its home area. The division headquarters was organized on 1 July 1921 at 39 Whitehall Street in Manhattan, but relocated on 26 March 1924 to the Globe Indemnity Building, Washington Place, Newark, New Jersey. The headquarters was relocated on 25 July 1936 to the Federal Building, 1180 Raymond Boulevard in Newark and remained there until activated for World War II. Like the 77th Division, the initial formation of the “Lightning Division” was expedited by the enrollment of many officers who were World War I veterans of the division. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the division staff published a newsletter, the “78th Division Gazette.” The newsletter informed the division’s members of such things as when and where the inactive training sessions were to be held, what the division’s summer training quotas were, where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC). The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp Dix, the location where much of the 78th’s training activities occurred in the interwar years. The division headquarters often conducted its summer training there, and on a number of occasions, participated in CPXs at Camp Dix as well. The 78th Division headquarters also occasionally trained with the staffs of the 1st Division or the 1st Infantry Brigade at Camp Dix. In 1924, the division officers with assistance from Colonel Edward A. Shuttleworth, the division chief of staff, established Camp Silzer at Sea Girt, New Jersey, for the purposes of providing a training area for the division. Camp Silzer was used some summers by the division staff for command post exercises and frequently for “contact camps” by subordinate units. For the 1937 camp at Camp Dix, the division staff and subordinate units planned and conducted an unusual division night attack exercise in coordination with the 303rd Chemical Regiment and the 40th Engineer Battalion (Camouflage). As of 1937, the division was commanded by Brigadier General Perry L. Miles.

The subordinate infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the units of the 1st Infantry Brigade. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, usually trained at various posts in the Second and Third Corps Areas also with other units of the 1st Division. For example, the division’s artillery units trained with the 7th Field Artillery at Pine Camp, New York; the 303rd Engineer Regiment usually trained with the 1st Engineer Regiment at Fort DuPont, Delaware; the 303rd Medical Regiment trained with the 1st Medical Regiment at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania; and the 303rd Observation Squadron trained with the 5th Observation Squadron at Mitchel Field, New York. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility for conducting the infantry CMTC held at Camp Dix each year. On a number of occasions, the division participated in Second Corps Area or First Army command post exercises in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. These training events gave division staff officers’ opportunities to practice the roles they would be expected to perform in the event the division was mobilized. Unlike the Regular Army and National Guard units in the First Corps Area, the 78th Division did not participate in the Second Corps Area maneuvers and the First Army maneuvers of 1935, 1939, and 1940 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular Army and National Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel.

==World War II==

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

The 78th Infantry Division was reorganized effective 20 February 1942, and was ordered into active military service on 15 August 1942 and reorganized at Camp Butner, North Carolina, and concurrently redesignated as Headquarters, 78th Infantry Division. It was designated as a replacement pool division on 1 October 1942, and remained in this assignment until 1 March 1943, when the 78th Division was restored to field duty, and to its training regimen. 78th Division moved to the Carolina Maneuver Area on 15 November 1943 to test its training, and then returned to Camp Butner on 7 December 1943. The personnel then went on Christmas leave, and deployed to the Tennessee Maneuver Area on 25 January 1944, where they participated in the 5th Second Army Tennessee Maneuvers. They then moved to Camp Pickett, Virginia, where they filled their TO&amp;E, (table of organization and equipment), then deployed to the staging area at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, on 4 October 1944.

After two years as a training division, the 78th embarked for the European Theatre from the New York POE on 14 October 1944, whereupon they sailed for England. They arrived on 26 October 1944, and after further training crossed to France on 22 November 1944.

After landing in France, the division moved to Tongeren, Belgium, on 27 November 1944, and to Roetgen, Germany, on 7 December 1944, to prepare for combat. The 311th Infantry Regiment was attached to the US 8th Infantry Division in the Hurtgen Forest, 10 December. The 309th and 310th Infantry Regiments relieved elements of the 1st Division in the line in the vicinity of Entenpfuhl, 1–12 December. On the 13th these regiments smashed into Simmerath, Witzerath, and Bickerath and were fighting for Kesternich when Gerd von Rundstedt launched his counteroffensive in the Monschau area, on 18 December.

The 78th held the area it had taken from the Siegfried Line against German attacks throughout the winter. The Division attacked, 30 January 1945, and took Kesternich, 2 February, the town of Schmidt on the 8th, and captured intact the vital Schwammanauel Dam the next day. In the advance, the Roer River was crossed, 28 February, and the division joined the offensive of the First and Ninth Armies toward the Rhine. That river was crossed over the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen, 8 March, by the 310th Regiment, the first troops to cross in the wake of the 9th Armored Division. That unit, attached to the 9th Armored and acting as a motorized unit had driven across Germany capturing Euskirchen, Rheinbach, and Bad Neuenahr. The 78th expanded the bridgehead, taking Honnef and cutting part of the Autobahn, 16 March. From 2 April to 8 May, the division was active in the reduction of the Ruhr Pocket and at VE-day was stationed near Marburg. In mid-November 1945 the division relieved the 82nd Airborne Division on occupation duty in Berlin. In May 1946, the 3rd Inf Regiment was moved to Berlin and on 15 June, it took over the Berlin Military District from the division.

The 78th Infantry Division was subsequently inactivated at Berlin on 16 June 1946. The division&#x27;s infantry regiments were also inactivated as follows:
309th Infantry Regiment between 15 Apr – May 22, 1946, in Germany; 
310th Infantry Regiment on 15 Jun 1946, at Berlin; 
311th Infantry Regiment on 22 May 1946, in Germany. The division remained on occupation duty in Germany until it was inactivated on 22 May 1946.

==Post-war service==
On 1 November 1946, the 78th Infantry Division was reactivated at Newark, New Jersey. The headquarters location was changed on 9 November 1955 to Kearny, New Jersey, and on 6 December 1958 to Edison, New Jersey.

The 78th Division was deployed to Southwest Asia 1990 and 1991 when the 920th Transportation Company (Medium, Petroleum) to support operations in Desert Storm. The 1018th Reception Battalion, the 2nd Brigade OSUT Headquarters, and the 1st and 3rd Battalion of the 310th Regiment as well as the 1st Brigade&#x27;s 3rd Battalion, 309th Regiment with a composite detachment from the 78th Training Support Brigade, provided assistance in necessary training base expansion at Fort Dix. The 348th Military Police Detachment conducted protective service missions for key national leaders throughout the world during the mobilization period. In addition, many individuals from the 78th served as &quot;fillers&quot; in other deployed units.

On 1 October 1993, the division was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters, 78th Division (Exercise), under the Army&#x27;s &quot;Bold Shift&quot; initiative. The new mission is to conduct small unit collective training (LANES) and computerized battle simulation exercises for client units in the First Army East area (a 14 state region). Like the other exercise divisions, the 1st Brigade was designated as the simulations exercise unit, conducting Battle Command and Staff Training for US Army Reserve and Army National Guard units at the battalion, brigade, command, and division levels. This training uses the simulations models used by the Regular Army in conducting WARFIGHTER exercises. The other brigades within the division (2d through 5th depending on the division) conducted field training for units at the squad, platoon, and company levels. In all units, then made up of US Army Reserve soldiers, there were detachments of Regular Army soldiers assigned to manage the day-to-day requirements and planning of exercises as part of the Congressionally mandated Ground Forces Readiness Enhancement (GFRE – popularly known as &quot;Jeffries&quot;) program. This program was partially instituted to ensure that reserve component units would have continual training support in order to preclude some of the training and readiness problems that were discovered in the ramp-up, and eventual deployments, in support of Desert Storm.

One of five exercise divisions in the United States Army, the 78th Division Headquarters, and its 1st Brigade, were for many years headquartered at the Kilmer Reserve Center (the former Camp Kilmer) in Edison, New Jersey, with subordinate units located in New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York.

As a result of the 2005 BRAC, the division&#x27;s headquarters and its 1st Brigade were relocated to Fort Dix, New Jersey, joining the already located Division&#x27;s 2d Brigade (LANES) and some 1st Brigade (BCST) subordinate elements.

On 17 October 1999, the division was redesignated from 78th Division (Exercise) to 78th Division (Training Support) to reflect the growing change in the type of training provided by the division&#x27;s units. There was also an associated change in the manning of the unit, adding National Guard personnel to the regulars and Army Reservists already assigned. This was one of the first instances of the growing multi-component organization of US Army units that deal with Reserve Component training and operations.

In 1999, the 189th Infantry Brigade was reflagged as the 4th Brigade, 78th Division (TS) and merged with the existing 4th Brigade, 78th Division (Exercise). The reorganization created a unique unit consisting of active-component, National Guard, civilian and drilling US Army reservists. On 1 October 2009, the division was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters, 78th Training Brigade, and on 1 October 2010, it was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters, 78th Training Division.

The 4th Brigade is a tenant unit on Fort Bragg with headquarters at the 78th Division (Training Support), Edison, New Jersey. The brigade&#x27;s responsibility is to train, coach, teach and mentor the Reserve and Army National Guard units of North Carolina.

The 4th Brigade, 78th Division (Training Support) provides training assistance, support, and evaluation to priority Reserve Component units and all other units within capabilities. Synchronize training support within area of responsibility in order to enhance individual and unit readiness to meet directed mobilization and/or wartime requirements. On order, activate or augment mobilization assistance teams (MAT) to assist installation commanders in post-mobilization training and validation of mobilized units for deployment. On order, deploy a defense coordinating officer (DCO) and/or a defense coordinating element (DCE) to coordinate military support to civilian authorities (MSCA) during federal disaster response operations. Provide command and control of subordinate units.

1st BN (LS), 313th Regiment, 4th BDE, provides logistic support for a multi-component (AC/USAR/ARNG) training support brigade that conducts lanes training, TAM evals for priority RC client units; On order provides mobilization augmentation training and military support to civilian authorities.

== Subordinate units ==

As of 2017 the following units are subordinated to the 78th Training Division (Operations):

* 1st Brigade
** 3d Battalion, 309th Regiment
** 2d Battalion, 311th Regiment
** 3d Battalion, 318th Regiment
** 2d Battalion, 323d Regiment

==Insignia==
The shoulder sleeve insignia was originally approved for the 78th Infantry Division on 27 May 1922. It was retained for the 78th Division (Training) on 11 Sep 1959. The insignia was redesignated on 1 Oct 1993 for the 78th Division (Exercise) and the description revised to provide metric measurements. The insignia was redesignated for the 78th Division (Training Support) on 17 Oct 1999.

===Distinctive unit insignia===
*Description: A gold color metal and enamel device in height overall, consisting of a white enamel alerion on a scarlet enamel disc centered upon a blue enamel equilateral triangle with notched sides, all in front of two white enamel lightning flashes in a V form contained at top and bottom by a continuous scarlet scroll inscribed below with the word &quot;AUDACITER&quot; in gold.
*Symbolism: The white alerion on scarlet is from the arms of Lorraine Province in France where the organization served in three World War I campaigns. In World War II, the unit participated in the Ardennes-Alsace, Rhineland and Central Europe campaigns indicated by the three points, in the color blue for Infantry and for the area of the Rhine River. The white flashes and the red of the scroll allude to the Division shoulder sleeve insignia.
*Background: The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 78th Division (Training) on 21 Dec 1971. It was redesignated on 1 Oct 1993 for the 78th Division (Exercise) and the description revised to provide metric measurements. On 17 Oct 1999 the insignia was redesignated for the 78th Division (Training Support).

==Honors==

<text>Blackwater fever is a complication of malaria infection in which red blood cells burst in the bloodstream (hemolysis), releasing hemoglobin directly into the blood vessels and into the urine, frequently leading to kidney failure. The disease was first linked to malaria by the Sierra Leone Creole physician John Farrell Easmon in his 1884 pamphlet entitled &quot;The Nature and Treatment of Blackwater Fever.&quot; Easmon coined the name &quot;blackwater fever&quot; and was the first to successfully treat such cases following the publication of his pamphlet.

==Signs and symptoms==
Within a few days of onset there are chills, with rigor, high fever, jaundice, vomiting, rapidly progressive anemia, and dark red or black urine.

==Causes==
The cause of hemolytic crises in this disease is unknown (mainly due to intravascular haemolysis). There is rapid and massive destruction of red blood cells resulting in hemoglobinemia (hemoglobin in the blood, but outside the red blood cells), hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin in urine), intense jaundice, anuria (passing less than 50 milliliters of urine in a day), and finally death in the majority of cases.

The most probable explanation for blackwater fever is an autoimmune reaction apparently caused by the interaction of the malaria parasite and the use of quinine. Blackwater fever is caused by heavy parasitization of red blood cells with &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;. However, there have been other cases attributed to &quot;Plasmodium vivax,&quot; &quot;Plasmodium malariae&quot;, &quot;Plasmodium knowlesi&quot;.

Blackwater fever is a serious complication of malaria, but cerebral malaria has a higher mortality rate. Blackwater fever is much less common today than it was before 1950. It may be that quinine plays a role in triggering the condition, and this drug is no longer commonly used for malaria prophylaxis. Quinine remains important for treatment of malaria.
==Diagnosis==

Blackwater fever should be suspected in a malaria patient who is intermittently passing dark-red to black urine, and is diagnosed using a urine dipstick test, which will be positive for hemoglobin. Microscopy of urine will be negative for erythrocytes.

==Treatment==
The treatment is antimalarial chemotherapy, intravenous fluid and sometimes supportive care such as intensive care and dialysis.

==Society and culture==
===Prominent victims===
* Brigadier General Charles Young (United States Army officer) first contracted malignant malaria, also known as blackwater fever, in 1913 during a military expedition in Liberia. Given his vulnerability to the disease, he and his family understood that military orders dispatching him back to Liberia in 1921 were akin to suicide, but he refused to retire from the U.S. Army or try to alter his military orders. He contracted the disease again during a visit to Nigeria and died in 1922. The U.S. Army posthumously promoted Young to Brigadier General in 2021.
* Prior to his photography career, Henri Cartier-Bresson contracted blackwater fever while hunting in Western Africa. Expecting to die, he sent instructions to his family on his wishes for a funeral. He made a full recovery.
* British mariner and naval officer Charles Lightoller contracted malaria c. 1897 during his tenure in Elder Dempster Lines. In his autobiography, he describes suffering from severe complications, including blackwater fever and a temperature of 106°F. He was treated by his shipmates and made a full recovery.
* Zoologist John Samuel Budgett died from the disease in 1904, after returning from a collecting trip to West Africa, in search of specimens of the fish &quot;Polypterus&quot;.
* Missionary and explorer George Grenfell died after a bad attack of blackwater fever at Basoko on 1 July 1906.
* Jesse Brand, a missionary to the Chat Mountains in India, died of blackwater fever in 1928.
* Actor Don Adams, best known as Maxwell Smart from the popular sitcom &quot;Get Smart&quot; and as the title character in &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, contracted blackwater fever at Guadalcanal during World War II. Adams was evacuated from his United States Marine Corps unit to a hospital in New Zealand where he ultimately made a full recovery.
* Humanitarian and MMA fighter Justin Wren contracted malaria, which devolved into blackwater fever, while drilling water-wells for Congo Pygmies in 2013. The affliction nearly claimed Wren&#x27;s life. He was misdiagnosed four times and required airlift to Uganda, where he narrowly recovered from severe symptoms.
* Aeneas, Jeannie Gunn&#x27;s husband, is described as having died from Blackwater Fever or Malarial Dysentry at Elsey Station in the Northern Territory in 1903. She later authored the classic account &quot;We of the Never Never.&quot;
* Bernard Deacon
* Peter Cameron Scott, a Scottish-American missionary and founder of Africa Inland Mission, died from the disease in December 1896.
* Henry Stricker, South African cricketer

<text>The 87th Infantry Division (&quot;Golden Acorn&quot;) was a unit of the United States Army in World War I and World War II. After World War II, the 87th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop became the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, which made the only combat jump in Vietnam and in Iraq. As of 22 September 2021, the rest of the division now exists as a training formation as part of the 84th Training Command.

==World War I==
The 87th Division was a National Army division, made up of draftees from Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. It was activated at Camp Pike, Arkansas on 25 August 1917. Like many units, the 87th Division was used to furnish personnel for other units scheduled for earlier overseas departure. Before November 1917, most of the enlisted men were transferred to other units (2,400 to the 81st Division, 3,000 to the 31st Division, and 8,000 to the 39th Division). The division was reconstituted from draftees drawn from the Midwest. Between January and June 1918, 40,000 men arrived at Camp Pike, but 30,000 left. The 87th Division lost more than 20,000 men, and numbered 15,000 men in June 1918. It was again reconstituted, with draftees mostly from New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. It went overseas in September 1918, but was utilized as a pool of laborers by the Services of Supply, American Expeditionary Forces. It returned to the United States in January 1919 to Camp Dix, New Jersey, and was demobilized in February 1919.

==Interwar period==

The 87th Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Fourth Corps Area, and assigned to the XIV Corps. The division was further allotted to the states of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. The division headquarters was organized on 23 September 1921 at Jackson, Mississippi. The headquarters was subsequently relocated on 14 October 1921 to the New Orleans International Depot in New Orleans, Louisiana, and once again relocated in April 1922 to Poland and Dauphine Streets in New Orleans, where it remained until activated for World War II. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the chief of staff published a division newsletter named “The Acorn” in keeping with division’s nickname and the military, geographical, and historical background of the regions from which it drew its personnel. The newsletter informed the division’s members of such things as when and where the inactive training sessions were to be held, what the division’s summer training quotas were, where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC).

The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp McClellan, Alabama, the location where much of the 87th Division’s training activities occurred in the interwar years. The division headquarters was called to duty for training there as a unit on a number of occasions. The headquarters and special staff usually trained with their counterparts on the staff of the 8th Infantry Brigade, 4th Division, either at Camp McClellan or at Fort McPherson, Georgia. The infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the 4th Division&#x27;s 8th or 22nd Infantry Regiments, either at Camp McClellan or at one of the Regular Army regiments&#x27; home stations. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Fourth Corps Area, usually with the active units of the 4th Division. For example, the division’s artillery trained with units of the 2nd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; the 312th Engineer Regiment trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, with the 4th and 7th Engineer Regiments; the 312th Medical Regiment trained at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia; and the 312th Observation Squadron trained with the 22nd Observation Squadron at Maxwell Field, Alabama. 

In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the CMTC held at Camp McClellan and Fort McPherson each year. On a number of occasions, the division participated in Fourth Corps Area and Third Army command post exercises in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the Fourth Corps Area, the 87th Division did not participate in the various Fourth Corps Area maneuvers and the Third Army maneuvers of 1938, 1940, and 1941 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some officers were assigned duties as umpires or support personnel. For the 1938 Third Army maneuvers, for example, about 200 of the division’s officers were attached to the National Guard&#x27;s 31st Division (troops from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi) to allow that unit to function as an almost full-strength division.

==World War II==

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery, and its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

The 87th Infantry Division was ordered into active military service on 15 December 1942 at Camp McCain, Mississippi. It was nicknamed the &quot;Baby Division&quot; because many of its initial filler soldiers were among the first eighteen year olds conscripted after the lower limit of the draft age was reduced from twenty to eighteen years old in November 1942. It moved to the Tennessee Maneuver Area on 3 December 1943, for the Second Army #4 Tennessee Maneuvers, and consolidated at Fort Jackson, South Carolina on 20 January 1944 for divisional training. The division staged at Camp Kilmer, at Stelton (now Edison), New Jersey, on 10 October 1944 until it received its port call to the New York Port of Embarkation in Brooklyn, New York.

It sailed to the European Theater on 17 October 1944, arrived in England on 12 November 1944, and staged for movement to France. It was assigned to the Third Army on 25 November 1944, and arrived at Le Havre, France, on 28 November 1944. The 87th was further assigned to the III Corps on 4 December 1944, and to the XII Corps on 11 December 1944, to the XV Corps on 21 December 1944, and to the VIII Corps on 29 December 1944. Crossed into Belgium on 12 January 1945, and returned to XII Corps on 14 January 1945. Crossed into Luxembourg on 21 January 1945, and assigned to VIII Corps on 25 January 1945. Because of discontinuity in the German railroad system, the 87th was routed to Germany by returning to Belgium on 3 February 1945. Entered Germany 16 March 1945, and remained to Victory in Europe Day. Returned to the United States at the New York Port of Embarkation on 11 July 1945, and proceeded to Fort Benning, Georgia, on 14 July 1945 to prepare for deployment to Japan; it was at Fort Benning on VJ Day. The 87th Infantry Division was inactivated on 21 September 1945, at Fort Benning.

===Combat chronicle===

The 87th Infantry Division arrived in Scotland, 22 October 1944, and trained in England, 23 October-30 November. It landed in France, 1–3 December, and moved to Metz, where, on 8 December, it went into action against and took Fort Driant. The division then shifted to the vicinity of Gros-Réderching near the Saar-German border on 10 December and captured Rimling, Obergailbach, and Guiderkirch.

The 87th was moving into Germany when, on 16 December 1944, German Field Marshal Von Rundstedt launched his offensive in the Ardennes forest (Battle of the Bulge). The Division was placed in SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force) reserve, 24–28 December, then thrown into the Bulge battle in Belgium, 29 December. In a fluctuating battle, it captured Moircy on 30 December and Remagne on 31 December. On 2 January 1945, it took Gérimont, on 10 January Tillet, and reached the Ourthe by 13 January. On 15 January 1945, the division moved to Luxembourg to relieve the 4th Infantry Division along the Sauer and seized Wasserbillig on 23 January. The 87th moved to the vicinity of St. Vith, 28 January, and attacked and captured Schlierbach, Selz, and Hogden by the end of the month. After the fall of Neuendorf, 9 February, the division went on the defensive until 26 February, when Ormont and Hallschlag were taken in night attacks. The 87th crossed the Kyll River, 6 March, took Dollendorf on 8 March, and after a brief rest, returned to combat, 13 March 1945, crossing the Moselle on 16th and clearing Koblenz, 18–19 March. The division crossed the Rhine, 25–26 March, despite strong opposition, consolidated its bridgehead, and secured Grossenlinden and Langgöns. On 7 April, it jumped off in an attack which carried it through Thuringia into Saxony. Plauen fell, 17 April, and the division took up defensive positions, 20 April, about 4 miles from the border to Czechoslovakia. On 6 May 1945, it took Falkenstein and maintained its positions until Victory in Europe Day.

The 87th Division returned to the States in July 1945 expecting to be called upon to play a role in the defeat of the Imperial Japanese, but the sudden termination of the war in the Pacific while the division was reassembling at Fort Benning changed the future of the 87th. The division was inactivated 21 September 1945.

The last active soldier from the division that served in World War II retired in June 1981. Colonel Vedder B. Driscoll (1925–1983), who had enlisted in 1943 and was a platoon sergeant for Company I, 345th Infantry, achieved thirty years of commissioned service.

==Postwar==
The 87th Infantry Division was reformed in the Organized Reserve Corps after the war, in the Third Army area. It comprised units in Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Florida. It was inactivated on 15 February 1957 in Birmingham, Alabama, and subsequently the division shoulder sleeve insignia and number, but not the division lineage and honors, were used by the 87th Maneuver Area Command (MAC), also in Birmingham, with sixteen subordinate battalions. The 87th MAC was later inactivated and, on 1 October 1993, the lineage of the 87th Infantry Division was redesignated as Headquarters, 87th Division (Exercise) and activated at Birmingham, Alabama. On 17 October 1999 it was reorganized and redesignated Headquarters, 87th Division (Training Support).

According to Global Security, &quot;On 16 January 2006, First US Army&#x27;s mission expanded to include the training, readiness oversight, and mobilization for all US Army Reserve and Army National Guard units within the continental United States and 2 US territories. First US Army assumed authority from Fifth US Army, which was transforming into United States Army North (ARNORTH), assuming nationwide responsibility for homeland security. With its new role, First US Army developed two subordinate multi-component headquarters, one division to support the eastern United States and the other to support the western United States. Division East, First US Army Division East was activated on 7 March 2007, and was headquartered at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Division East replaced the functions previously performed by US Army Reserve divisions, like the 87th Division, in its area of responsibility. As a result, the 87th Division&#x27;s brigades were subsequently inactivated and the 87th Division was reorganized and redesignated as the 87th Army Reserve Support Command. The 87th Army Reserve Support Command assumed command and control of the newly formed Mobilization Support Group East and its 16 subordinate battalions effective 16 October 2008.&quot;

On 1 October 2015 the 87th Army Reserve Support Command was inactivated. 
On September 22, 2021. The 87th Training Division was reactivated in Hoover, Alabama under the 84th Training Command.

<text>These are tables of congressional delegations from West Virginia to the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate.

The current dean of the West Virginia delegation is Senator Shelley Moore Capito, having served in the Senate since 2015 and in Congress since 2001.

From June 1861 to June 1863, during the Civil War and before West Virginia statehood, the United States recognized the Restored Government of Virginia sitting in Wheeling as the &quot;legitimate&quot;, pro-Union government of Virginia. Also called the Reorganized Government of Virginia, it controlled a contiguous area roughly the same as present-day West Virginia, along with parts of Northern Virginia and Tidewater. The rest of Virginia was under Confederate military control, with a state government in Richmond, and did not send representatives to Congress. The legislature in Wheeling chose two U.S. Senators for Virginia, John S. Carlile and Waitman T. Willey, who were seated by the Senate. Three U.S. Representatives elected in western districts of Virginia also went to Congress in 1861: Jacob B. Blair, William G. Brown, and Kellian V. Whaley. In 1861, as one of its first acts, the Restored Government began the process of creating the new state of West Virginia, which was achieved in 1863. The Restored Government of Virginia then moved to Alexandria.

<text>U.S. Route 85 (US 85) is a north–south United States Highway that travels in the Mountain and Northern Plains states of the United States. The southern terminus of the highway is at the Mexican border in El Paso, Texas, connecting with Mexican Federal Highway 45. The northern terminus is at the Canadian border in Fortuna, North Dakota, where the route continues north as Saskatchewan Highway 35. The highway route is part of the CanAm Highway. Sections of US 85 are designated as the Theodore Roosevelt Expressway.

The highway passes through Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, and North Dakota. From Las Cruces, New Mexico to Fountain, Colorado, US-85 shares its alignment with I-25 and is not signed.

===Texas===

US 85 in Texas begins at the Mexico–US border with US 62 and travels north through El Paso, beginning at the Santa Fe Street Bridge, and following Santa Fe Street, then Paisano Drive westward, along the Rio Grande until Paisano Drive ends where it joins with Interstate 10, about before both reach the New Mexico border. The route is concurrent with I-10 for the remainder of its route within Texas.

The original route of US 85 in Texas had the highway concurrent with Doniphan Drive (after Paisano Drive), and parallelling the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway through the Mesilla Valley communities of Canutillo, Vinton and Anthony before crossing the Texas/New Mexico state line in Anthony, New Mexico, then following the road which is now New Mexico State Road 478 (NM 478) up the Mesilla Valley to Las Cruces. This route is marked as Texas State Highway 20 north of the intersection with Mesa Street/Country Club Drive.

===New Mexico===

The unsigned route of US 85 through New Mexico exists only on paper to maintain continuity with signed sections in Colorado and Texas. Except for a 4-mile segment through Las Vegas (signed as Business Loop 25), US 85 in New Mexico is entirely concurrent with Interstate Routes. For the first it shares its route with I-10, then continues north for the remainder of its length in New Mexico concurrent with I-25. US-85 was de-signed in segments between 1970 and 1990 as I-25 was built through the state. I-25 between Bernalillo and a point just south of Santa Fe was built over the old US 85 alignment. I-25 was also built directly over US 85 from east of Santa Fe to Las Vegas and from US 64 to the Colorado border at Raton Pass. From the US-64/87 interchange in Raton to the Colorado state line at Raton Pass, US-85 also runs concurrently with US-87 (also unsigned along I-25 in New Mexico). At one point, the route went along the historic El Camino Real.

The original route from Anthony to Las Cruces is now signed as NM 478. The original route from Las Cruces to Hatch is now signed as NM 185; NM 187 south of Truth or Consequences (T or C); NM 181 north of T or C; NM 1 (the route&#x27;s pre-US-85 designation) from Redrock to Socorro; NM 314 from Belen to Albuquerque; NM 313 from Albuquerque to Bernalillo; NM 14 and NM 466 through Santa Fe; and NM 445 from Maxwell to US 64 Remnant US-85 signs can still be seen on Fourth Street in downtown Albuquerque, the original route through the city before I-25 was built.

For concurrencies of interstate, US routes, and routes of different levels of significance, the New Mexico Department of Transportation&#x27;s policy is to sign only the route of greater significance, while leaving the route of lesser significance unsigned. Consistent with this policy, NMDOT has removed US 85 from its route logs, but the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) retains US 85 on a concurrent alignment with I-10 and I-25 to maintain continuity with signed segments in Texas and Colorado. Many mapmakers, such as the American Automobile Association, Rand McNally and Google Maps follow AASHTO&#x27;s practice and still sign US 85 along its concurrent stretches with the respective interstates.

===Colorado===
US 85 enters Colorado from New Mexico concurrent with I-25 and US-87 but is not signed. US 85 leaves I-25 at Exit 128 and follows Santa Fe Avenue through Fountain before turning west briefly onto Lake Avenue, then turning north following Nevada Avenue through Colorado Springs before rejoining I-25 at Exit 148. Approaching the south side of Denver, US 85 again leaves I-25 at Exit 184. From there it heads west and north as a two lane rural highway. It becomes an expressway near Chatfield Reservoir and the southern Denver suburbs of Littleton and Englewood, where it is commonly known as Santa Fe Drive. It continues north through Denver for a few miles before once again joining with I-25 at mile marker 207. There it becomes a concurrency with US 87 as well as I-25 and heads north through downtown Denver. At exit 214, US 85 turns east and becomes a concurrency with I-70 and US 6 for about a mile where it exits with U.S. 6 and heads northeast through Commerce City. In just a few miles the US 6/US 85 concurrency merges with I-76 at mile marker 9. They travel concurrently for until exit 12 when US 85 becomes an expressway and continues north out of the Denver area through Brighton. From there it parallels I-25 for about passing through Fort Lupton, Platteville, LaSalle, Evans, Greeley, Eaton, Ault, Pierce, and Nunn before crossing into Wyoming.

===Wyoming===

US 85 enters Wyoming from Colorado south of Cheyenne. In Cheyenne it joins with Business Route 87, and a mile later with I-180 until it meets with US 30. The segment with I-180 is the only fully at-grade interstate route in the U.S. At exit 12, it joins with I-25 and US 87 in a concurrency for until US 85 leaves at exit 17 and travels northeast towards Meriden. From there it heads north to Torrington, where it meets with US 26 and concurrencies for until Lingle, and later it meets US 20 and US 18 at Lusk. It shares the next with US 18 and later meets US 16 near Newcastle. From here it is until it enters South Dakota in the Black Hills.

===South Dakota===
The South Dakota section of US 85, with the exception of two concurrencies with US 14 Alternate and a concurrency with I-90, is defined at South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-181.

US 85 enters the Black Hills from Wyoming and travels northeast until it meets with US 14 Alternate east at Cheyenne Crossing. The two routes form a concurrency from there, along the way coming to the road which leads to Terry Peak. Upon entering to Lead, the two routes are separated, and the overlap with US 85 is replaced by a truck route. As the route US 85 and US 14 are separated until both meet again in Deadwood, but not before US 85 serves as the northern terminus of U.S. Route 385. The routes run together through Deadwood before splitting, and US 85 then runs north to meet I-90. US 85 overlaps I-90 for while heading west. At exit 10 on the north side of Spearfish, US 85 heads back north. At Belle Fourche it crosses state highway 34 and US 212. From there it continues to North Dakota passing only through the small towns of Redig, Buffalo (where it meets state highway 20), and Ludlow, as well as coming to the Geographic Center of the United States.

===North Dakota===

US 85 enters North Dakota in the southwest part of the state. The first city on its route is Bowman at the junction of US 12. Continuing north, it passes between North Dakota&#x27;s two highest points, White Butte and Black Butte. Near Amidon US 85 heads east for before going back north along the Little Missouri National Grassland for about . Near Belfield it junctions with I-94. After forming a concurrency with North Dakota Highway 200, it eventually passes through part of the scenic Badlands, crosses the Little Missouri River and passes near the Theodore Roosevelt National Park (North Unit).

Then, at Watford City it travels west for where it turns back north before Alexander. U.S. 85 continues north as North Dakota 200 turns west toward Montana. South of Williston it crosses the Missouri River. The stretch from Watford City to Williston is in the process of being converted into an undivided four-lane highway, and should be substantially completed in 2014. A few miles later it meets with US 2 where the two overlap for as an expressway, which now bypasses Williston to the northwest. After US 2 heads east, US 85 continues north to a concurrency with North Dakota Highway 5. From there it is to Fortuna where US 85 heads back north for its remaining to the Canada–US border.

==History==
What is now US 85 from El Paso, Texas to then-US 66 (now NM 6) in Los Lunas, New Mexico (south of Albuquerque) was shown as U.S. Route 466 in an early 1925 plan for the U.S. Highway System. This north–south route was never signed in the field; instead, the route was designated as U.S. Route 570 and then as part of US 85. The number &quot;466&quot; was later used along another routing.
