<text>The Oldsmobile 4-4-2 (also known as the 442) is a muscle car produced by Oldsmobile between the 1964 and 1987 model years. Introduced as an option package for US-sold F-85 and Cutlass models, it became a model in its own right from 1968 to 1971, spawned the Hurst/Olds in 1968, then reverted to an option through the mid-1970s. The name was revived in the 1980s on the rear-wheel drive Cutlass Supreme and early 1990s as an option package for the new front-wheel drive Cutlass Calais.

The &quot;4-4-2&quot; name (pronounced &quot;Four-four-two&quot;) derives from the original car&#x27;s four-barrel carburetor, four-speed manual transmission, and dual exhausts. It was originally written &quot;4-4-2&quot; (with badging showing hyphens between the numerals), and remained hyphenated throughout Oldsmobile&#x27;s use of the designation. Beginning in 1965, the 4-4-2s standard transmission was a three-speed manual along with an optional two-speed automatic and four-speed manual, but were still badged as &quot;4-4-2&quot;s. 
Because of this change, from 1965 on, according to Oldsmobile brochures and advertisements, the 4-4-2 designation referred to the 400 cubic inch engine, four-barrel carburetor, and dual exhausts. By 1968, badging was shortened to simply &quot;442&quot;, but Oldsmobile brochures and internal documents continued to use the &quot;4-4-2&quot; model designation.

==First generation==
===1964===

The 4-4-2 was born out of competition between Pontiac and Oldsmobile divisions of GM. The high performance GTO version of the Pontiac LeMans intermediate had proved an unexpected success midway through the 1964 model year. Oldsmobile&#x27;s hasty response was to beef up their own popular Cutlass, a task given to a team led by performance enthusiast and Olds engineer John Beltz (later responsible for the distinctive and powerful Toronado), aided by Dale Smith and division chief engineer Bob Dorshimer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Car Craft, 1/91&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasted with the 1964 Tempest LeMans GTO with its 389 cubic inch V-8 (introduced in September, 1963 as an option package), the Oldsmobile offering was a conservative package. Technically the &quot;B09 Police Apprehender Pursuit&quot; option, the 442 used the four-barrel carbureted 330 CID (5.4 L) V8, known as L79, but with shorter valve spring retainers, longer pushrods, M400 rod and main bearings, and high lift camshaft, raising rated (SAE gross) output to 310 hp (231.3 kW) at 5,200 rpm. Torque remained , although the torque peak rose from 2800 rpm to 3600 rpm. Enhanced handling was credited to the heavy duty (HD) suspension package that included HD springs (30% higher rating), HD shocks (valving with 50% more restriction), a 15/16 diameter front and 7/8 diameter rear sway bar, and boxed lower rear control arms with denser bushings. Other standard 442 equipment included Muncie M20, heavy duty clutch with higher rate springs in the pressure plate assembly, HD manual steering ratio 20:1 versus the standard ratio 24:1, performance rear axle ratio 3.36:1, dual exhaust, 14x6 HD wheels sporting 7.5 x14 US Royal 80XP Black with red stripe tire, front fender and rear decklid 442 medallions, and a dual snorkel air cleaner. The 442 was not equipped with power brakes or steering, unless added as an option. The frame, part number 3837595, was not unique or modified for the 442 option, and could be found under F85s equipped with a manual transmission. There was an HD frame option in 1964, part number 9773002; which was boxed, but it was not standard equipment for the 442. Unlike the 1965 442 model built in Lansing, the 1964 442 does not have an option code on the data plate. There is documentation available showing that the 1964 442 was built in both Lansing and Fremont.

The package was dubbed &quot;4-4-2&quot; based on its combination of four-barrel carburetor, four-speed manual transmission, and dual exhausts. It was available on any F-85 or Cutlass model except the station wagon, although most were Cutlass hardtop coupés (Oldsmobile archives indicate that approximately 10 four-door sedans were built with the B09 option) with an optional list price of $136 ($ in dollars ), added to the MSRP of $2,663 ($ in dollars ) for the coupe and $2,773 ($ in dollars ) for the hardtop, along with additional optional equipment. A total of 2,999 were sold.

&quot;Motor Trend&quot; tested an early 1964 4-4-2 with a 3:55 rear axle (standard ratio was 3.36:1) and found that the 3,440-lb (1,560 kg) car ran 0–60 mph (0–96 km/h) in 7.5 seconds, the standing quarter mile in 15.5 seconds at , and reached a top speed of 116 mph (185.6 km/h).

===1965===
With the GTO receiving GM corporate sanction to receive their full-sized car&#x27;s 389 V-8, Oldsmobile followed suit and replaced the 4-4-2&#x27;s standard 330 CID with the new 400 CID (6.5 L). The definition of &quot;4-4-2&quot; was then restated as referring to 400 cubic inches, a four-barrel carburetor (a 515 cfm Rochester four-jet), and two exhausts. Output for the big engine rose to and . The standard transmission became a three-speed manual with column shifter, with a floor shifter four-speed and Oldsmobile&#x27;s two-speed Jetaway automatic transmission as optional. A heavy duty three-speed with Hurst floor shifter was introduced as a mid-year option. 

Other touches added to the 1965 were chrome body side scoops adorned with 4-4-2 badging, chambered dual exhaust pipes, chrome single snout air cleaner, and 4-4-2 badging on the dash. Late in the year option N98 was added, which were chrome wheels. It also offered standard bucket seats when optioned on the Cutlass and a 6,000 rpm tachometer, mounted in the optional console, more as decoration than for usefulness. Retractable front seat belts were optional. The turning diameter was 41 feet.

&quot;Modern Rod&quot; tested a 1965 F85 4-4-2 with the four-speed manual, slicks, and headers and obtained a quarter mile acceleration of 13.78 seconds at ; &quot;Car Life&quot;&#x27;s automatic 1965 ran the quarter mile in 15.5 seconds at , with a 0 to 60 mph time of 7.8 seconds. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; tested a 1965 4-4-2 and did 0–60 mph in 5.5 seconds.

Offered in four body styles, 4-4-2 sales rose to 25,003, including 3,468 convertibles.

===1966===

The 1966 4-4-2 shared a modest facelift with other Cutlasses. It came with a 400 ci &quot;L78&quot; V8 rated at /440 lb•ft with a single four-barrel carburetor. Two new optional 400 ci engines offered even higher performance: the &quot;L69&quot;, with three two-barrel Rochester 2GC carburetors on a progressive linkage and of torque, which was priced at US$264.54, and the rare &quot;W30&quot;. Besides the convertible, the 4-4-2 option was available on both hardtop and pillared coupes, which shared the same roofline. Besides the new sweeping C pillar on coupes which featured a &quot;flying buttress&quot; recessed rear window, the new body had high, round rear fenders giving the car a more muscular appearance.

The W30 engine added an outside-air induction system (admitting cool air to the carburetors via tubing from the front grill) and a hotter cam, under-rated as producing the same as the L69. The battery was relocated to the trunk to make room for the air hoses, which prevented the package from being ordered on convertible models. Only 54 W30s were built by the factory, although an additional 97 were produced for dealer installation.

The standard transmission was a three-speed manual with column shift and the two-speed Jetaway automatic with switch-pitch torque converter was optional. Hurst shifters became standard equipment with floor-mounted manual transmissions including the optional heavy-duty three-speed, M-20 wide-ratio four-speed or M-21 close-ratio four-speed. The standard 350-horsepower 400 engine could be ordered with any of the four transmissions, while only manual transmissions could be ordered with the L69 three two-barrel option.

Inside, a revised instrument panel featured two round pods for the speedometer and other instruments, replacing the horizontal sweep speedometer of 1964–65 models, but the rest of the basic dashboard designed was unchanged. F-85 models had base interiors with bench seats and rubber floor mats while the more lavish Cutlass versions came with full carpeting and featured Strato bucket seats of a new design with higher and thinner seat backs, or a no-cost bench seat option. Head rests were an option.

&quot;Car Life&quot; tested an L69 4-4-2 with four-speed transmission and obtained a 0–60 time of 6.3 seconds and a quarter mile of 14.8 seconds at . &quot;Motor Trend&quot;&#x27;s similar test car ran 0–60 mph in 7.2 seconds, with a quarter mile time of 15.2 seconds at .

Production slumped to 21,997. The 4-4-2 still constituted only about 10 percent of Cutlass sales.

===1967===
For 1967 the 4-4-2&#x27;s styling and base engine remained the same, save for minor trim changes, a distinctive louvered hood, and an increase in intake valve size to 2.067 from 1.99. The three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission with Switch Pitch became available, replacing the two-speed Switch Pitch Jetaway, as was the case with the mid-sized muscle cars from other GM divisions (Pontiac GTO, Chevrolet Chevelle SS396, and Buick GS400). The heavy-duty floor-mounted three-speed manual transmission was now standard with the Muncie M-20 and M-21 four-speeds optional, all with Hurst shifters. Front disc brakes were a new option.

A GM policy decision banning multiple carburetors for all vehicles except Ed Cole&#x27;s beloved Corvette and the Corvair saw the demise of the L69 with its triple carburetors, a rare option for Olds and an icon for Pontiacs since 1957. The W30 remained available, although the four-barrel Quadrajet carburetor replaced the tri carb setup. New red plastic inner fender liners became part of the W30 package. 502 factory W30 engines were built to meet NHRA homologation rules, along with an unknown number of dealer-installed packages.

&quot;Cars&quot; tested a W30 4-4-2 with close-ratio four-speed and 4.33 rear axle (a dealer-installed only option), obtaining a quarter mile of 14.1 seconds at in completely stock form. 0–60 mph times were between 6.5 and 6.7 seconds.

Unlike in previous years which the 4-4-2 option could be ordered on either baseline F-85 or upscale Cutlass models, the 1967 4-4-2 package was based on the top-line Cutlass Supreme series, including the sport coupe (with center post), Holiday hardtop coupe and convertible. Standard equipment on all models included Strato bucket seats or no-cost notchback bench seat, full carpeting, expanded Morocceen vinyl upholstery, heavy-duty suspension with rear sway bar, and wide-oval tires.

Like all cars sold in the U.S. for 1967, the 4-4-2 came standard with a group of occupant protection and accident avoidance features mandated by Federal law. This package included an energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, padded dash, recessed controls, four-way hazard flashers, and a dual-circuit brake hydraulic master cylinder.

Production rose somewhat from the previous year, rising to 24,833.

==Second generation==
===1968===
The 4-4-2 became a separate model from 1968 through 1971. The wheelbase was , and over 33,000 were sold for 1968. Despite the engine displacement staying at 400 CID, the engine was based on the new 455 V8&#x27;s 4.25 stroke, with the bore decreased (to 3.87). Torque came at 3000–3200 rpm as opposed to the early 400&#x27;s 3600 rpm peak, mostly due to a milder base cam grind. &quot;Car Life&quot; tested a 1968 4-4-2 with a 3.42:1 rear axle ratio and Hydramatic and attained 0–60 times of 7.0 seconds, and a quarter-mile time of 15.13 seconds at . Top speed was reported as . The base engine was still rated at , but only with the standard three-speed and optional four-speed; automatics were rated at . W-30s were rated again at . Car Life also tested a four-speed W-30 with a 4.33 rear end and recorded a 13.3 at .

All standard 1968 4-4-2 engines are painted a bronze–copper color, as with the 1967s, topped with a fire-red air cleaner. W-30 option cars were equipped with ram air intake hoses leading from chrome-topped dual snorkel black air cleaners to special under-bumper air scoops and set off by bright red plastic fender wells. In addition, a Turnpike Cruiser option was made available with a two-barrel carburetor; this was previously available on the Cutlass Supreme for 1967. 1968 was the first year for side marker lights and front outboard shoulder belts, and the last year for vent windows on hardtops and convertibles. 4-4-2s for 1968 had unique rear bumpers, with exhaust cutouts and special exhaust tips.

====Hurst/Olds====

In 1968 Oldsmobile partnered with Hurst Performance Research Corporation to create the Hurst/Olds rather than just adding Hurst shifters as with earlier models. The limited regular production run of 515 Hurst/Olds (459 Holiday Coupes/56 Sport Coupes) started out as regular 4-4-2s, but were treated to numerous distinct enhancements, both cosmetic and mechanical. All cars were painted Peruvian silver (a Toronado color) with liberal black striping and white pinstripes, exterior and interior H/O badging (unique to 1968), and a real walnut wood dash insert. Mechanically, the cars left the factory with two drive train combinations. Red 455 CID engines were backed by modified W-30 Turbo 400 automatic transmissions. A/C cars got W-46 engines with 3.08:1 rears while non-A/C cars got W-45 engines with 3.91:1 rears. While both engines were rated at , the W-45 engine received the cylinder heads from the W-30 and the camshaft from the W-31, making it more suitable for higher rpms. All cars came with bucket seats and a Hurst dual-gate shifter in a mini-console. Also standard were numerous regular 4-4-2 options such as disc brakes, heavy duty cooling, and FE2 suspension. They shared the red fender wells and ram air setup with the W-30. Popular, but not standard, additional options included the tick-tock-tach and wood-grained steering wheel. Power front disc brakes were optional.

The 1968 Hurst/Olds posted a 0–60 mph time of 5.4 seconds, and turned the 1/4 mile in 13.9 seconds at .

===1969===
1969 4-4-2s were very similar to the 1968 except the division tooth between the grilles, the trunk lid inlets for the tail lights, wing windows deleted on Holiday Coupes and convertibles, steering lock ignition switch on the steering column, standard headrests were added to the front seats, and the paint scheme. Twin hood stripes were now available to highlight the new dual-bulged hood. The 4-4-2 numerals grew to nearly double their previous size. Optional disc brakes had updated single-piston calipers. The exhaust manifolds featured a new center divider for better performance. Other changes to the engine were minimal, but the Turnpike Cruiser option was deleted. A new optional W-32 high-performance engine was available with an automatic; it came with the W-30&#x27;s forced air induction system, but had the base engine&#x27;s milder cam. A total of 297 were built, including 25 sport coupes and convertibles each.

The Hurst/Olds returned, with a cameo white and fire frost gold striped paint scheme, large functional ram air mailbox hood scoops, rear pedestal spoiler, 15&quot; SSII chrome plated rims, European racing mirrors, and a 380-horsepower 455 cid V8 that was detuned slightly from 1968. 906 production Hurst/Olds Holiday Coupes were built, plus 6 prototypes and 2 convertibles. Performance was 0–60 in 5.9 seconds, the 1/4 mile in 14.03 seconds at .

===1970===

1970 was the pinnacle of performance from Oldsmobile. In order to keep up in the horsepower arms-race, General Motors dropped the cap on engine size in 1970, and Oldsmobile responded by making the Olds 455 V8 the standard 4-4-2 engine. Output was and , with a variant available with the &quot;W30&quot; option. The 1970 model year can be identified by vertical bars in its chrome grille, rectangular parking lights in front bumper, and vertical tail lights.

The revised body style and increased performance resulted in the 4-4-2 being awarded pace car duties at the Indianapolis 500 race in 1970. A high-performance W-30 package was offered, which added a fiberglass hood (option W25) with functional air scoops and low-restriction air cleaner, aluminum intake manifold, special camshaft, cylinder heads, distributor, and carburetor. Two W-30 equipped 4-4-2 Vista Cruisers were produced by special order. Rear shoulder seat belts were optional at $23.

Motor Trend tested a 4-4-2 W-30 with the four-speed manual transmission and 3.91:1 rear gears, clocking a quarter mile time of 14.2 seconds at . However, the magazine noted that Oldsmobile engineers had earlier posted a best of 13.7 seconds on the same test car with a fresh tune.

New options for the 1970 4-4-2 included GM&#x27;s variable-ratio power steering (option N47), a console-mounted Hurst Dual/Gate shifter for use with the Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, and aluminum differential housing and cover (option W27). All Oldsmobile V8s received new Positive Valve Rotators for the 1970s to increase engine valve life.

===1971===

Despite an industry-wide softening of muscle car sales, the 4-4-2 returned in 1971 with only minor modifications from the previous year. Engine output was down for 1971 due to a lower compression ratio (8.5:1), which affected all of GM&#x27;s engines as the result of a corporate policy requiring engines to run on lower-octane regular leaded, low lead, or unleaded gasoline, in preparation for the introduction of the catalytic converter on 1975-model cars. The base 455 was rated at , with the W-30 achieving a rating of . The W-27 option was downgraded to an aluminum cover for the cast iron differential housing.

The 1971 4-4-2 was available in a hardtop coupe and convertible body type. The sport coupe disappeared for the first time since 1964, only to return in 1972. 1971 Model Year Appearance changes included a black grille with silver surround, silver headlight bezels, round parking lights in front bumper, and horizontal tail lights.

Quarter mile performance as reported by Road Test magazine was 15.2 seconds at , and 0–60 mph in 8.9 seconds, using the TH400 automatic transmission.


===1972===

By 1972, the muscle car era was unmistakably in decline due to the twin blows of rising insurance rates and increasingly stringent Federal emissions standards. The 4-4-2 name reverted to an appearance and handling option package (option code W-29) in 1972 on the Cutlass Holiday coupe, Cutlass &quot;S&quot; sport coupe and Holiday coupe, and Cutlass Supreme convertible. The W-29 option was not available on Cutlass Supreme notchback hardtops. The 4-4-2 option package, which carried a modest sticker price of $29, consisted of the &quot;FE2&quot; suspension upgrades (heavy duty springs &amp; shocks, front and rear sway bars, boxed lower rear control arms, and 14- by 7-in [356- by 178-mm] wheels), side striping, fender and decklid badging, faux hood louvers, and a unique grille. The rear bumper sported cutouts for exhaust tips, but only when paired with the optional &quot;L75&quot; 455 CID V8 in place of the standard Oldsmobile 350 V8.

Interior trims differed on each 4-4-2 bodystyle, much like the early 1964–66 models. For the base Cutlass hardtop coupe a basic two-spoke steering wheel, vinyl or cloth/vinyl bench seat, and rubber floor mats were standard; Cutlass S sport coupe and Holiday hardtop coupe featured full carpeting, deluxe steering wheel, courtesy lighting, and bench seats with cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery or optional Strato bucket seats; and the Cutlass Supreme convertible came with more woodgrain interior accents than the &quot;S&quot;, along with an all-vinyl notchback bench seat with armrest or no-cost Strato bucket seats; a center console was optional. An AM/FM stereo radio with a tape player was $363.

4-4-2s could still be ordered with the additional W30 option, which included the still-potent L77 455 engine, rated at and s of torque with standard low-restriction dual exhausts. Other notable components of the W30 package included a lightweight aluminum intake manifold, the W25 fiberglass ram-air hood, anti-spin differential with 3.42:1 gears (3.73:1 available), and heavy duty cooling. Due to the low-vacuum at idle, air conditioning was not available, and power brakes were only available with an automatic transmission. Only 113 W30 convertibles and 659 W30 coupes were produced in 1972.

A special edition Hurst/Olds paced the Indianapolis 500 in 1972. The H/O coupe was based on the notchback Cutlass Supreme Holiday coupe (not offered with the 4-4-2 option) and the Cutlass Supreme convertible, both of which came standard with a 270-net horsepower 455 Rocket four-barrel V8 or optional 300-net horsepower W-30 option 455. Both H/O engines were mated to Turbo 400 transmissions with console-mounted Hurst Dual Gate shifters. A H/O Vista Cruiser was provided for the Medical Director.

Appearance changes included a silver grille with black surround, black headlight bezels, round parking lights in front bumper, and 3-section horizontal tail lights.

==Third generation==
===1973===
Originally expected to debut for the 1972 model year, the new &quot;Colonnade&quot; body style was delayed until 1973 due to an auto workers strike in 1972. The body was redesigned to feature massive long doors and energy absorbing bumpers. The rear windows were fixed and the roof was reinforced in anticipation of roll-over standards being imposed by the government. These cars were a few hundred pounds heavier and slightly larger than the 1972&#x27;s.

Consistent with 1972, the 4-4-2 option remained a handling and appearance package, code W-29, and was available on the Cutlass and Cutlass &quot;S&quot;. It consisted of a faux louvered hood, FE2 suspension, specific grilles, emblems and stripes. Items such as dual exhaust and super stock wheels were optional, reflecting an industry-wide weaning of U.S. consumers from large powerful cars. Power figures are all net, rather than the earlier gross units.

The W-30 (that had in 1972) had become a trim package. The L77 &quot;V&quot; code 455 was there, but only with the 4-speed wide-ratio M-20 transmission. 1973 was also the last year of the 4-speed manual transmission in the Oldsmobile &quot;A&quot; body. The L77 &quot;V&quot; code produced , the L75 &quot;U&quot; code 455 AT produced , while the &quot;K&quot; code 350 single exhaust produced and the &quot;M&quot; code 350 with dual exhausts produced . Positraction rear ends, axle ratios, gauges, Super Stock wheels, HD cooling and many sport type options were optional. The L77 &quot;V&quot; code engine was also available in the Hurst/Olds without A/C, code W-46, the W-45 L75 &quot;U&quot; code was standard with A/C. Both 455s used the Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission, while the 350 was mated to the Turbo 350.

Interior trims for the 1973 4-4-2 included a cloth/vinyl or all-vinyl bench seat and rubber mats on base Cutlass coupe, while Cutlass S included full carpeting on floor and lower door panels, woodgrain trim, deluxe steering wheel and more luxurious cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seat, or optional swiveling Strato bucket seats with vinyl trim that could be rotated 90 degrees for easy exit/entry. Center console with floor shifter was optional with either the 4-speed manual or Turbo Hydra-matic transmissions.

===1974===
The 1974 4-4-2 received the same facelift as other Cutlasses that year including a revised grille and new flush taillights over a newly mandated rear bumper to match the similarly mandated front bumper introduced in &#x27;73. It remained a handling and appearance package available on both base Cutlass and Cutlass S Colonnade coupes. Engine offerings included the standard Rocket 350 four-barrel V8 or optional Rocket 455, which reintroduced the W-30 code that signified the top 4-4-2 engine option package from 1966 to 1972. Power steering and Turbo Hydra-matic transmission became standard equipment on 4-4-2 and all other Cutlass models. The four-speed manual transmission with Hurst shifter was dropped from the option list. GM-specification radial tires were introduced as an option.

Interiors were similar to 1973 with cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats standard, or optional swiveling Strato bucket seats with Moroceen vinyl upholstery. The center console with floor shifter was optional with bucket seats.

===1975===
The 1975 4-4-2 received revised vertical-bar grilles and continued with vertically stacked taillight lenses. It was once again a handling/appearance package on base Cutlass and Cutlass S coupes with content similar to previous years. Radial tires became standard equipment, along with a GM High Energy electronic ignition.

All engines were mated to catalytic converters, which required use of unleaded gasoline and spelled the end of true dual exhausts. With economy now a selling point following the 1973–74 energy crisis, the 1975 4-4-2 and most other Cutlass models no longer included a V8 engine as standard equipment. For the first time since its 1964 introduction, the 4-4-2 came standard with a six-cylinder engine, Chevrolet&#x27;s 250 cubic-inch inline unit which had previously been offered on some Oldsmobile intermediates from 1966 to 1971 and the compact Omega since its 1973 introduction. Also new was a small Oldsmobile-built 260 cubic-inch Rocket V8 specifically designed for fuel economy. The 170-horsepower 350 Rocket V8 was now an extra-cost option along with the 190-horsepower 455 V8. A three-speed manual transmission was reinstated as standard equipment with the six-cylinder engine, with the Turbo Hydra-matic transmission optional with that engine and the only transmission offered with the V8 engines. Interiors again consisted of bench seats with cloth-and-Moroceen vinyl or all-Moroceen trim, or optional swiveling Strato buckets upholstered in Moroceen vinyl. Revised door panels featured pull straps. The console remained an option with bucket seats.

Due to Detroit&#x27;s conversion from SAE Gross horsepower ratings (commonly referred to as &quot;brake horsepower&quot; (bhp) to SAE net for the 1972 model year, and ever-more stringent Federal emissions standards, engine output continued to significantly decline. The 1975 4-4-2 equipped with a 455 was rated by Oldsmobile at just 190 hp at 3400 rpm and 350 lb-ft at 2000 rpm.

===1976===
The 1976 4-4-2 shared a new aerodynamic sloped nose designed for NASCAR with split grilles and new quad rectangular headlights with Cutlass S models, along with revised lower sheetmetal with fewer creases than the 1973–75 models. The 4-4-2 option was offered on Cutlass S coupes and was once again an appearance/handling package. Engine/transmission offerings were unchanged from 1975 except that the 260 V8 could be ordered with a five-speed manual transmission. This was also the final year for the 455 Rocket V8.
Interiors again consisted of bench seats with cloth-and-Moroceen vinyl or all-Moroceen trim, or optional swiveling Strato buckets upholstered in Moroceen vinyl. A console was optional with bucket seats.
===1977===

The 1977 model year was the last for the 1973-vintage Colonnade body. The 4-4-2 was the only Oldsmobile intermediate to feature the NASCAR sloped nose from the &#x27;76 model, with the Cutlass S switching to an upright nose similar to Cutlass Supreme models. Engine offerings were revised, with Buick&#x27;s 231 cubic-inch V6 replacing the base model Chevy 250 inline-six, with optional powerplants again including the Oldsmobile built 260 and 350 cubic-inch Rocket V8s. Replacing the 455 as the top engine was a new Oldsmobile 403 cubic-inch Rocket V8 rated at and . Transmission offerings included a three-speed manual or Turbo Hydra-matic with the V6, five-speed manual or Turbo Hydra-matic for the 260 V8, and Turbo Hydra-matic was the sole offering for the 350 and 403 V8s. Interiors included a standard bench seat with cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seat, or optional Strato bucket seats with all-vinyl upholstery and without the swiveling feature of previous years. The console remained optional with bucket seats.
==Fourth generation==

===1978===
The 4-4-2 model continued on the downsized A-body platform introduced for the 1978 model year. The 1978 version of the 4-4-2 was an option package on the semi-fastback &quot;Aeroback&quot; Cutlass Salon, which was now the entry-level trim of the best-selling Cutlass range. It was offered with all powertrains available on the standard Cutlass, including the two-barrel Buick V6, two-barrel Oldsmobile V8, and Chevrolet V8s, in either two- or four-barrel form. A three-speed manual transmission was standard, and a three-speed THM200 automatic was available with all engines; a Borg-Warner five-speed manual was offered with the 260 V8 and a four-speed Saginaw manual with the 305 V8.

Distinctive trim elements included contrasting striping along the rocker panels, lower doors, and wheelwells, badging on the rear trunk, and interior emblems. All other options offered on the Cutlass Salon were available with the 4-4-2 package.

===1979===
The 1979 4-4-2 remained based on the Cutlass Salon body style. The Hurst/Olds rejoined the lineup this year, based on the Cutlass Calais.

===1980===
The 4-4-2 moved to the notchback Cutlass Calais for 1980, with some of its performance heritage returning as it gained a larger Oldsmobile V8 engine not available on other Cutlass models. The 231 V6 and the Chevrolet 305 were no longer offered. It included W-30 badging on the front fenders above the side marker lights, with less dramatic graphics than before. Otherwise, the car shared identical powertrain with the 1979 Hurst/Olds, excepting the Hurst shifter. Also available only in gold over white or gold over black paint, a total of 886 were built: 540 in black, and 346 in white.

The MSRP of a Cutlass Calais in 1980 was $6,919.57 (~$ in ). Option W-30 4-4-2 appearance and handling package consisted of: gold accent paint scheme (Y71), painted grille face, applique pillar molding, aluminum sport wheels, &quot;W-30&quot; decals on front fender, tail lamp bezel and rear window molding to match body color, &quot;442&quot; emblem on sail panel and deck lid, 5.7 liter engine (350 CID) V8, 4-bbl (L34), sport console (D55), Rallye suspension package (FE2), P205/70R14 steel belted radial ply blackwall tires with raised white letters (QFV) and a digital clock (UE8). The W-30 4-4-2 option was not available in California.

The 4-4-2 was not available from 1981 to 1984.
==Fifth generation==
The 4-4-2 name was revived in 1985 on the rear-wheel drive G-body Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme due to the demise of Oldsmobile and Hurst&#x27;s official collaboration on the Hurst/Olds but Oldsmobile wanted to continue to offer a performance-oriented Cutlass model to the public. The name was now defined as referring to the car&#x27;s four-speed 200r4 automatic transmission, four-barrel carburetor, and two exhausts. This &quot;W42&quot; model replaced the 1983 and 1984 Hurst/Olds models and used the same LG8 V8. The shifter was mounted on the floor in a console between the front seats, and the upgraded &quot;F41&quot; suspension package was included. 3,000 were produced in the first year, and all were sold quickly. 4,273 were produced for 1986, and 4,208 were made in 1987.

All 1985 and 1986 4-4-2s used the already-sporty Cutlass Salon model as their base platform. Due to cost concerns, for 1987 it was decided they would use the less-expensive Cutlass Supreme model to base the 4-4-2 on. The package included a beefier drive train, 15 X 7 fully chromed styled-steel wheels with gold trim, manually inflated air shocks in the rear, special paint scheme (always silver at the bottom) and gold body stripe decal package, dual-snorkel air cleaner with chrome lid, mandatory A/C and door panel 4-4-2 emblems. With few exceptions (vinyl tops, painted pinstripes, chrome outside mirrors and wire wheel covers, for example), 4-4-2s could be ordered with much of the optional equipment found on other Cutlass models.

The 1984 Hurst/Olds and 1985–87 4-4-2 were equipped with an 8.5-inch GM corporate differential and all were equipped with 3.73:1 ring and pinion final drive gears. Rather than using the weaker 7.5-inch rear differential found in the Monte Carlo SS, these models used the same stout unit found in the Buick Grand National. Many 4-4-2s (and G-body Hurst/Olds) did not come with RPO G80 (limited-slip). This was, in large part, due to dealer ordering &quot;packages&quot; that grouped popular options together for ease of ordering. Problem was, G80 was not part of a single one of those popular option packages, but could be added &quot;a la carte&quot;. 

The 1983–84 Hurst/Olds and 1985–1987 4-4-2s are distinguishable by there being a &quot;9&quot; as the engine code found in the 8th character of their VINs. These were the only models to get the hotter VIN 9 307 cubic inch engine, and it was the only engine available. From 1983 to 1985, this engine was flat-tappet valve train, and rated at 180 hp/240 lb•ft torque. In 1986, the 307 engine received a roller-camshaft valve train and new swirl-port heads to improve economy and low-end torque. HP dropped to 170, with torque climbing to 255LBS FT. The 1985 4-4-2 used an OZ code THM 200-4R transmission (as did the 1983–84 Hurst/Olds). Both 1986 and 1987 4-4-2 used the KZF code THM 200-4R. The KZF removed much of the shift harshness of the original OZ coded transmissions, but were still firmer than the run-of-the-mill overdrive transmissions used in the rest of Oldsmobile&#x27;s lineup.
==Sixth generation==
The 442 option was revived on the &quot;Quad 442&quot; front-wheel drive 1990–1991 Cutlass Calais. This model used a 2.3 L &quot;LG0&quot; Quad-4 four-cylinder engine with four valves per cylinder and two camshafts. The engine was tuned with higher output camshafts which produced more top end power at the expense of idle quality. It used a single exhaust with a dual tipped muffler and produced with a five-speed manual transmission. 

This version of the 442 also played upon the &quot;W-30&quot; option code used in past versions of the 442, the exception being that this model used the option code &quot;W-40&quot;. A low production, late 1991 model year version used the option code &quot;W-41&quot;; the key differences of the &quot;W-41&quot; package were a engine with a differently geared five-speed transmission, plus silver striping and lettering on the body side molding in place of the W-40&#x27;s gold.

This 442 model lasted just two years. 

Production totals:

1990 &quot;W-40&quot; = 2,629

1991 &quot;W-40&quot; = 1,160

1991 &quot;W-41&quot; = 204

GM literature referred to the 1992 and 1993 Oldsmobile Achieva SCX as a 442, the last time the designation was used. The Achieva SCX used the same &quot;W41&quot; drive train as the very limited production 1991 Quad 442 W41.

<text>Elizabeth Shaughnessy Cohen ( Murray; February 11, 1948 – December 9, 1998) was a Canadian politician who represented the riding of Windsor—St. Clair for the Liberal Party of Canada from 1993 until her death in 1998.

==Background==
She was born in London, Ontario, and grew up in Thamesville. She studied English literature and sociology at the University of Windsor, and taught at St. Clair College before returning to law school. She married Jerry Cohen, a psychology professor, in 1971. She had originally intended to keep her own surname, but opted to take her husband&#x27;s name when she realized it would make her both Irish and Jewish.

She was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1979, and worked as a lawyer until her election to Parliament.

==Political career==
===1988 and 1993 Federal Elections===
Cohen stood as the Liberal candidate in Windsor—St. Clair in the 1988 election, but lost to New Democratic Party incumbent Howard McCurdy. However, in the 1993 election, Cohen defeated McCurdy for the seat. Following the election, she was briefly the subject of controversy when she and her husband were sued for $200,000 in unpaid debt, but Cohen blamed the situation on the costs of conducting a political campaign and the controversy soon subsided after she agreed to a debt consolidation plan.

===Member of Parliament===
Her first political action after being sworn in as a Member of Parliament was a letter requesting that the federal government building in Windsor be named after former MP Paul Martin, Sr., a request which the government accepted. After the first sitting of the new parliament in January 1994, Cohen was the first newly elected MP to be subjected to a critical profile in &quot;Frank&quot;, although both Cohen and the &quot;Windsor Star&quot; criticized the profile&#x27;s accuracy.

In February 1994, Cohen was appointed to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Human Resources and Development. In June, she was one of several Liberal MPs, alongside Jean Augustine, Barry Campbell, Bill Graham and Hedy Fry, who privately intervened with Ontario Liberal Party leader Lyn McLeod to encourage her not to withdraw the party&#x27;s support of the Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act (Bill 167). In August, she was appointed co-chair with Herb Gray of a parliamentary subcommittee to investigate allegations against the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, including the role of Grant Bristow as an informant. 

On the final day of the 1995 Ontario provincial election campaign, Cohen was one of several MPs, alongside Jane Stewart, Paddy Torsney, Benoît Serré and Stan Dromisky, who made speeches in the federal House of Commons campaigning on behalf of McLeod&#x27;s Ontario Liberal Party and against the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party of Mike Harris. 

In September 1995, she was one of only a few MPs to vote in favour of Réal Ménard&#x27;s private member&#x27;s motion calling on the government to recognize same-sex marriage. 

In January 1996, she travelled to the Middle East as an election monitor for the Palestinian Authority election. In March, she was appointed to and named as chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice. In this capacity, she conducted a review of the federal Young Offenders Act, which led to reforms announced by Justice Minister Anne McLellan in 1998.

She was re-elected in the 1997 election by a narrower margin, due to a significant resurgence in support for the New Democratic Party. Her NDP challenger was Joe Comartin. In her second term, she identified one of her key goals as advocating for a crossnational environmental project to clean up pollution in the Detroit River.

===Death in House of Commons===
On December 9, 1998, she collapsed in the House of Commons, just minutes after she had stood to address the House.
Three MPs, that were doctors, rushed to her desk and performed CPR on her until paramedics took over about ten minutes later. Reform Party MP Grant Hill was one of those doctors, and said she had a pulse when the paramedics rushed her to the hospital. She had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and was pronounced dead soon afterward at Ottawa Civic Hospital. She was the fifth MP in Canadian history to die on Parliament Hill, and the first ever to suffer a fatal health incident in the House of Commons chamber rather than in her office or on the wider Parliament Hill grounds.

In the House the following day, MPs from all parties spoke in tribute to Cohen. Reform Party MP Randy White praised her personality as &quot;a seemingly impossible combination of vigorous partisanship and open-minded friendship,&quot; while New Democratic Party leader Alexa McDonough paid tribute to Cohen&#x27;s passionate belief in &quot;the pursuit of justice for the rights of those who were not being fully respected.&quot; Historian Charlotte Gray, a personal friend of Cohen&#x27;s, revealed that Cohen had once filled the glass on Paul Martin&#x27;s House of Commons desk with gin just before a budget speech, while Liberal Party strategist Jerry Yanover described her as &quot;an up-front, in-your-face, old-fashioned Liberal, the kind that had principles and didn&#x27;t compromise them.&quot; Following the speeches, MPs unanimously agreed to immediately adjourn the House for the Christmas holiday, several days earlier than planned.

Her funeral was held Saturday, December 12, with prime minister Jean Chrétien and almost the entire federal cabinet attending the service. Over 800 people attended the funeral held at St. Anne&#x27;s Catholic Church in Tecumseh. She was cremated after the church ceremony and her ashes were buried on Pelee Island, Canada’s most southern inhabited land. Her gravesite can be found in the municipal cemetery.

Following her death, her widower Jerry Cohen ran for the Liberal nomination in the resulting by-election, but lost to city councillor Rick Limoges. Limoges won the by-election, narrowly defeating the NDP&#x27;s Comartin by 91 votes, although Comartin defeated Limoges in the 2000 election.

==Legacy==

In 2000, the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada instituted a literary award, the Shaughnessy Cohen Award for Political Writing, in her memory. Journalist Susan Delacourt published a biography of Cohen, &quot;Shaughnessy: The Passionate Politics of Shaughnessy Cohen&quot;, the same year.

<doc id="887234" wikidata="Q413578" url="?curid=887234" title="Mupirocin">
<text>Mupirocin, sold under the brand name Bactroban among others, is a topical antibiotic useful against superficial skin infections such as impetigo or folliculitis. It may also be used to get rid of methicillin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; (MRSA) when present in the nose without symptoms. Due to concerns of developing resistance, use for greater than ten days is not recommended. It is used as a cream or ointment applied to the skin.
Common side effects include itchiness and rash at the site of application, headache, and nausea. Long term use may result in increased growth of fungi. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding appears to be safe. Mupirocin is chemically a carboxylic acid. It works by blocking a bacteria&#x27;s ability to make protein, which usually results in bacterial death.
Mupirocin was initially isolated in 1971 from &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot;. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 162nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==

Mupirocin is used as a topical treatment for bacterial skin infections (for example, boils, impetigo, or open wounds), which are typically due to infection by &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; or &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;. It is also useful in the treatment of superficial methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) infections. Mupirocin is inactive for most anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria, mycoplasma, chlamydia, yeast, and fungi.

Intranasal mupirocin before surgery is effective for prevention of post-operative wound infection with &quot;Staphylcoccus aureus&quot; and preventative intranasal or catheter-site treatment is effective for reducing the risk of catheter site infection in persons treated with chronic peritoneal dialysis.

===Resistance===
Shortly after the clinical use of mupirocin began, strains of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; that were resistant to mupirocin emerged, with nares clearance rates of less than 30% success. Two distinct populations of mupirocin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; were isolated. One strain possessed low-level resistance (MuL: MIC = 8–256 mg/L), and another possessed high-level resistance (MuH: MIC &gt; 256 mg/L). Resistance in the MuL strains is probably due to mutations in the organism&#x27;s wild-type isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (&quot;IleS&quot;). In &quot;E. coli&quot; &quot;IleS&quot;, a single amino acid mutation was shown to alter mupirocin resistance. MuH is linked to the acquisition of a separate Ile synthetase gene, &quot;MupA&quot;. Mupirocin is not a viable antibiotic against MuH strains. Other antibiotic agents, such as azelaic acid, nitrofurazone, silver sulfadiazine, and ramoplanin have been shown to be effective against MuH strains.

Most strains of &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot;, a causative agent in the skin disease acne vulgaris, are naturally resistant to mupirocin.

Most strains of &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; are also resistant to mupirocin as they produce the antibiotic and it&#x27;s possible other species of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; may be resistant as well. 

The mechanism of action of mupirocin differs from other clinical antibiotics, rendering cross-resistance to other antibiotics unlikely. However, the MupA gene may co-transfer with other antibacterial resistance genes. This has been observed already with resistance genes for triclosan, tetracycline, and trimethoprim. It may also result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms.

A second type of high-level resistant synthetase was discovered in 2012 and termed &quot;MupB&quot;. It was found in a Canadian MRSA isolate &quot;MUP87&quot; and is probably located on a nonconjugative plasmid.

==Mechanism of action==
Pseudomonic acid (mupirocin) inhibits isoleucine—tRNA ligase in bacteria, leading to depletion of isoleucyl-tRNA and accumulation of the corresponding uncharged tRNA. Depletion of isoleucyl-tRNA results in inhibition of protein synthesis. The uncharged form of the tRNA binds to the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site of ribosomes, triggering the formation of (p)ppGpp, which in turn inhibits RNA synthesis. The combined inhibition of protein synthesis and RNA synthesis results in bacteriostasis. This mechanism of action is shared with furanomycin, an analog of isoleucine.

Inhibition of the tRNA ligase/synthase is brought by the structural similarity between the molecule&#x27;s monic acid &quot;head&quot; part and isoleucyl-adenylate (Ile-AMS). The unique 9-hydroxynonanoic acid &quot;tail&quot; wraps around the enzyme and further stabilizes the complex, keeping the catalytic part stuck. Mupirocin is able to bind to bacterial and archaeal versions of the enzyme, but not eukaryotic versions.

==Biosynthesis==



Mupirocin is a mixture of several pseudomonic acids, with pseudomonic acid A (PA-A) constituting greater than 90% of the mixture. Also present in mupirocin are pseudomonic acid B with an additional hydroxyl group at C8, pseudomonic acid C with a double bond between C10 and C11, instead of the epoxide of PA-A, and pseudomonic acid D with a double bond at C4` and C5` in the 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid portion of mupirocin.

===Biosynthesis of pseudomonic acid A===
The 74 kb mupirocin gene cluster contains six multi-domain enzymes and twenty-six other peptides (Table 1). Four large multi-domain type I polyketide synthase (PKS) proteins are encoded, as well as several single function enzymes with sequence similarity to type II PKSs. Therefore, it is believed that mupirocin is constructed by a mixed type I and type II PKS system. The mupirocin cluster exhibits an atypical acyltransferase (AT) organization, in that there are only two AT domains, and both are found on the same protein, MmpC. These AT domains are the only domains present on MmpC, while the other three type I PKS proteins contain no AT domains. The mupirocin pathway also contains several tandem acyl carrier protein doublets or triplets. This may be an adaptation to increase the throughput rate or to bind multiple substrates simultaneously.

Pseudomonic acid A is the product of an esterification between the 17C polyketide monic acid and the 9C fatty acid 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid. The possibility that the entire molecule is assembled as a single polyketide with a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation inserting an oxygen into the carbon backbone has been ruled out because C1 of monic acid and C9&#x27; of 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid are both derived from C1 of acetate.

===Monic acid biosynthesis===
Biosynthesis of the 17C monic acid unit begins on MmpD (Figure 1). One of the AT domains from MmpC may transfer an activated acetyl group from acetyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) to the first ACP domain. The chain is extended by malonyl-CoA, followed by a SAM-dependent methylation at C12 (see Figure 2 for PA-A numbering) and reduction of the B-keto group to an alcohol. The dehydration (DH) domain in module 1 is predicted to be non-functional due to a mutation in the conserved active site region. Module 2 adds another two carbons by the malonyl-CoA extender unit, followed by ketoreduction (KR) and dehydration. Module three adds a malonyl-CoA extender unit, followed by SAM-dependent methylation at C8, ketoreduction, and dehydration. Module 4 extends the molecule with a malonyl-CoA unit followed by ketoreduction.

Assembly of monic acid is continued by the transfer of the 12C product of MmpD to MmpA.

===Post-PKS tailoring===

The keto group at C3 is replaced with a methyl group in a multi-step reaction (Figure 3). MupG begins by decarboxylating a malonyl-ACP. The alpha carbon of the resulting acetyl-ACP is linked to C3 of the polyketide chain by MupH. This intermediate is dehydrated and decarboxylated by MupJ and MupK, respectively.

The formation of the pyran ring requires many enzyme-mediated steps (Figure 4). The double bond between C8 and C9 is proposed to migrate to between C8 and C16. Gene knockout experiments of mupO, mupU, mupV, and macpE have eliminated PA-A production. PA-B production is not removed by these knockouts, demonstrating that PA-B is not created by hydroxylating PA-A. A knockout of mupW eliminated the pyran ring, identifying MupW as being involved in ring formation.

The epoxide of PA-A at C10-11 is believed to be inserted after pyran formation by a cytochrome P450 such as MupO. A gene knockout of mupO abolished PA-A production but PA-B, which also contains the C10-C11 epoxide, remained.

===9-Hydroxy-nonanoic acid biosynthesis===

The nine-carbon fatty acid 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid (9-HN) is derived as a separate compound and later esterified to monic acid to form pseudomonic acid. 13C labeled acetate feeding has shown that C1-C6 are constructed with acetate in the canonical fashion of fatty acid synthesis. C7&#x27; shows only C1 labeling of acetate, while C8&#x27; and C9&#x27; show a reversed pattern of 13C labeled acetate. It is speculated that C7-C9 arises from a 3-hydroxypropionate starter unit, which is extended three times with malonyl-CoA and fully reduced to yield 9-HN. It has also been suggested that 9-HN is initiated by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (HMG). This latter theory was not supported by feeding of [3-14C] or [3,6-13C2]-HMG.

It is proposed that MmpB to catalyze the synthesis of 9-HN (Figure 5). MmpB contains a KS, KR, DH, 3 ACPs, and a thioesterase (TE) domain. It does not contain an enoyl reductase (ER) domain, which would be required for the complete reduction to the nine-carbon fatty acid. MupE is a single-domain protein that shows sequence similarity to known ER domains and may complete the reaction.

<text>Von der Decken&#x27;s hornbill (Tockus deckeni) is a hornbill found in East Africa, especially to the east of the East African Rift, from Ethiopia south to Tanzania. It is found mainly in thorn scrub and similar arid habitats. Jackson&#x27;s hornbill is often treated as a subspecies of it. It was named after the German explorer Baron Karl Klaus von der Decken (1833–1865).

==Description==
This species is a small hornbill with blackish upperparts and mainly whitish underparts and head. It has a long tail and a long curved bill which lacks a casque. It is similar to the red-billed hornbill except for the bill colour and the lack of spotting on the wing coverts in both male and female.

The species shows sexual dimorphism; the female has a black bill, whereas the male has a red bill with a cream tip and a black cutting edge.

==Breeding==
During incubation, the female lays two or three white eggs in a tree hole, which is blocked off with a cement made of mud, droppings and fruit pulp. There is only one narrow aperture, just big enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and chicks.

When the chicks and the female are too big for the nest, the mother breaks out and rebuilds the wall. Then both parents feed the chicks.

Captive breeding can be achieved by providing a small barrel or hollow tree with an entrance hole tall and wide. The birds will block off the hole once the hen is ready.

==Food and feeding==

Von der Decken&#x27;s hornbill is omnivorous, taking insects, fruit and seeds. It feeds mainly on the ground and will form flocks outside the breeding season. In captivity, Von Der Decken&#x27;s hornbill will readily eat papaya, cantaloupe, blueberries, bananas, and apples. Live food such as crickets and mealworms should also be offered daily. Small rodents are readily taken but should only be offered two or three times a week.

<doc id="887241" wikidata="Q7893669" url="?curid=887241" title="United for Peace and Justice">
<text>United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ) is a coalition of more than 1,300 international and U.S.-based organizations opposed to &quot;our government&#x27;s policy of permanent warfare and empire-building.&quot;

The organization was founded in October 2002 during the build-up to the United States&#x27; 2003 invasion of Iraq by dozens of groups including the National Organization for Women, National Council of Churches, Peace Action, the American Friends Service Committee, Black Voices for Peace, Not In Our Name, Nodutdol,September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, and Veterans for Peace. Its first joint action was anti-war protests on International Human Rights Day, December 10, 2002. The direct precursor to UFPJ was &quot;United We March!&quot;, initiated by Global Exchange, the Green Party of the United States, and others, which organized the April 20, 2002, demonstration against the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.

UFPJ primarily organizes large-scale protests. The group separates its work into seven issue campaigns: Iraq, counter-military recruitment, global justice, nuclear disarmament, Palestine–Israel, civil liberties–immigrant rights and faith-based organizing.

UFPJ&#x27;s most recent major rally and march was in Washington, D.C., on January 27, 2007. Among the featured speakers were several celebrities including Jane Fonda.

UFPJ&#x27;s previous major action occurred from September 24 to 26, 2005, in Washington, D.C. UFPJ called the protest &quot;End the War on Iraq!&quot; On September 24, there was a march and rally, co-sponsored with the ANSWER Coalition, followed by a festival. Although exact numbers are never known, the organizers estimated that hundreds of thousands of people attended these events; the NYCLU says 300,000 attended the march. On September 25, there was an interfaith service and grassroots training. The final day, September 26, was devoted to lobbying Congress and to nonviolent direct action and civil disobedience. Roughly 370 were arrested for blocking the entrance to the White House, demanding to meet with George W. Bush.

== Previous protests==
Some of UFPJ&#x27;s protests include:

* Its first protest, on February 15, 2003, in front of the United Nations headquarters in New York City and entitled &quot;The World Says No to War.&quot; The protest drew over 500,000 people. 
* Its second major protest, held on March 20, 2004, to commemorate the first anniversary of the U.S.&#x27; attack on Iraq. The event drew over 100,000 people in New York City, plus nearly two million in 700 other cities.
* In 2004, the organization wanted to hold a rally on the Great Lawn of Central Park in opposition to the continued occupation of Iraq. The City denied UFPJ&#x27;s application for a permit, on the basis that a mass gathering on the Great Lawn would be harmful to the grass, and that such damage would make it harder to collect private donations to maintain the Park. UFPJ charged that Mayor Michael Bloomberg was willing to allow other large gatherings on the Great Lawn, but was discriminating against the demonstration so as to curry favor with the Republican Party, which was holding its quadrennial convention in New York City. Nevertheless, a court rejected UFPJ&#x27;s challenge to the denial of the permit. The major protest was eventually held elsewhere, on Sunday, August 29, 2004, the eve of the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City. The event drew over 500,000 people, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and received lead coverage (including a double-sized, vertical front page in New York &quot;Newsday&quot;) in every major newspaper. In March, 2007 NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne stated about the RNC protests: &quot;You certainly had 800,000 on August 29th.&quot;
* On January 27, 2007, a protest of the Iraq war was held in Washington, D.C., with approximately 400,000 people participating.

== Unity statement==
UFPJ&#x27;s lengthy Unity Statement begins by asserting their opposition to the &quot;pre-emptive wars of aggression waged by the Bush administration&quot; and the &quot;drive to expand U.S. control over other nations and strip us of our rights at home under the cover of fighting terrorism and spreading democracy.&quot; It then echoes the rhetoric of Not in Our Name (founded six months earlier and itself a member of UFPJ) stating, &quot;we say NO to [the U.S.&#x27;s] use of war and racism to concentrate power in the hands of the few, at home and abroad.&quot;

It goes on to call for &quot;a broad mass movement for peace and justice&quot; and, in particular, for &quot;peaceful resolution of disputes amongst states; respect for national sovereignty, international law, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the defense and extension of basic democratic freedoms to all; social and economic justice; and the use of public spending to meet human and environmental needs.&quot;

UFPJ explicitly positions itself as not being a single-issue organization: &quot;We envision UFPJ as a movement-building coalition that coordinates and supports the work of existing groups and builds linkages and solidarity where none exist. We will link the wars abroad with the assaults at home, and U.S. militarism to the corporate economic interests it serves.&quot;

The statement lays out the intent of following these principles internally to UFPJ itself: &quot;We will pay special attention in all aspects of our work to the inclusion and leadership of constituencies bearing the brunt of the war’s impact at home, such as people of color, youth, women, and workers. We will be pro-active in addressing internal power dynamics within our movement...&quot; Further, the group pledges itself to non-violence.

The statement continues with a critique of U.S. government conduct, above all, with respect to the justification, preparation, and execution of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent occupation, including criticism of the media and the Democratic Party for &quot;refus[ing] to challenge them.&quot; It argues that, &quot;the war on Iraq was the leading edge of a relentless drive for U.S. empire... [e]xploiting the tragedy of September 11, 2001...&quot; for that purpose and to &quot;impose right-wing policies at home under the cover of fighting terrorism.&quot;

The critique is then broadened to much of U.S. foreign policy, nuclear weapons policy, racial profiling, detention of immigrants, and other abuses in domestic law enforcement, singling out the USA PATRIOT Act and the &quot;even more draconian&quot; PATRIOT Act II. It also assails the damage that a war budget and &quot;tax cuts for the wealthy&quot; have done to domestic programs such as Medicaid and even veterans&#x27; benefits, then states, &quot;Military recruiters are aggressively targeting low-income students, predominantly people of color, who, because they are denied access to good schools and decent jobs, have few alternatives to poverty or incarceration other than joining the military.&quot;

== Criticism ==
One critic claimed UFPJ is overly supportive of the Democratic Party. However, UFPJ had sponsored protests outside the Democratic National Convention in July 2004, calling for an &quot;emphatic rejection of the Democratic &#x27;leadership&#x27; that supported the war.&quot; In 2006, UFPJ, and many of its member groups, participated in the Voters for Peace campaign, a pledge which states, &quot;I will only vote for or support federal candidates who publicly commit to a speedy end to the Iraq war, and to preventing future &#x27;wars of aggression&#x27;.&quot;

Another critic has criticized the hierarchy, as he perceives it, within the New York City based leadership of UFPJ. He also stated that &quot;term limits must be enforced if the office of [UFPJ&#x27;s] national coordinator is to be continued.&quot;

== &quot;No Stolen Elections!&quot; campaign==
In September 2004, UFPJ joined with the Liberty Tree Foundation for the Democratic Revolution, Code Pink, and Global Exchange to launch the &quot;No Stolen Elections!&quot; campaign. Participants were invited to join in signing a pledge that began, &quot;I remember the stolen presidential election of 2000 and I am willing to take action in 2004 if the election is stolen again.&quot; The campaign stated that it would prepare for widespread protest and civil disobedience in the event of significant fraud in the 2004 election. On November 3, tens of thousands of people, demonstrating in over 80 cities, protested purported vote suppression and mechanical irregularities in Ohio and other states.

==Sharp disagreement with ANSWER==
Although UFPJ worked with A.N.S.W.E.R. to build the September 24, 2005, Washington, D.C., rally, by December 2005 the two groups had definitively fallen out. A December 2005 statement by UFPJ says that &quot;engagement with A.N.S.W.E.R.… [has been] …a difficult and controversial aspect of our work,&quot; and that UFPJ &quot;has decided not to coordinate work with ANSWER again on a national level.&quot; The document discusses events surrounding the September 24 rally, charges that A.N.S.W.E.R. &quot;violated the terms of our agreement in ways that substantially and negatively impacted September 24’s message and impact,&quot; remarks that &quot;co-sponsorship with ANSWER on September 24 was welcomed by some in the antiwar movement but limited or prevented completely the participation of others,&quot; and explains, &quot;We did not have consensus&quot; about the decision not to work with A.N.S.W.E.R., but had &quot;a more than two thirds supermajority … We make no recommendations or mandates on this issue to UFPJ member groups in local or constituency-based area…&quot;

A.N.S.W.E.R. responded by saying that &quot;UFPJ has publicly proclaimed its intention to split the movement,&quot; and accused UFPJ of &quot;a false and ugly attack on the A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition,&quot; and of doing so for &quot;embarrassingly petty and astonishingly trivial&quot; reasons. Besides giving their own version of the events surrounding September 24, A.N.S.W.E.R.&#x27;s statement indicates some less trivial differences between the groups: they criticize UFPJ for its willingness to embrace even moderate politicians, such as John Murtha, who are disaffected with the war, while A.N.S.W.E.R. &quot;considers it harmful to try to tailor the message of the progressive movement to please the long-awaited but fictional support from the politicians.&quot;

<doc id="887245" wikidata="Q7490749" url="?curid=887245" title="Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing">
<text>The Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing is a Canadian literary award, presented by the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada to the best nonfiction book on Canadian political and social issues. It has been presented annually in Ottawa at the Writers’ Trust Politics and the Pen gala since 2000, superseding the organization&#x27;s defunct Gordon Montador Award. 

The award had a dollar value in 2015 of CAD25,000.

The prize was established in honour of Shaughnessy Cohen (February 11, 1948 - December 9, 1998), an outspoken and popular Liberal Member of Parliament from Windsor, Ontario who died after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage in the House of Commons of Canada just seconds after standing to address her peers. The award is sponsored by CN.

==Submissions==
All Canadian-based publishers of original manuscripts may enter two books; companies publishing more than ten eligible nonfiction titles during the 2012 calendar year may add one book for every additional ten eligible books (or fraction thereof) on their nonfiction list, up to a maximum of five. For example, a publisher with a list of 18 qualifying nonfiction books would be entitled to submit three — two for the first ten and one for the next ten.

==Jury==
A three-person jury selects the winner and finalists of the Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing. The jury acts independently of the Writers’ Trust and is charged with interpreting the mandate and eligibility criteria of the prize, as well as determining which of the submissions best reflect the prize mandate. In evaluating the writing, literary merit is the sole criteria. Each juror may request an unlimited number of additional titles from the publisher&#x27;s lists. Such titles are on equal footing with all other submissions, provided that their publishers agree to abide by the conditions laid out in this document. The judgment of the jury in selecting the winners, determining eligibility, and interpreting these rules is final.

<text>KOA (850 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Denver, Colorado. Owned by iHeartMedia, it serves the Denver-Boulder media market. KOA broadcasts a news/talk radio format, and is also the flagship station of the Denver Broncos, Colorado Rockies and Colorado Buffaloes. KOA has its radio studios in Southeast Denver, while the transmitter site is off South Parker Road in Parker.

KOA is a Class A, clear-channel station, broadcasting at 50,000 watts non-directional, the maximum power permitted by the Federal Communications Commission for AM stations. By day, the station provides city-grade coverage to most of Colorado&#x27;s densely populated area, including cities such as Colorado Springs, Pueblo and Fort Collins. It provides at least secondary coverage to most of eastern Colorado, along with portions of Wyoming. Under the right conditions, it reaches portions of Nebraska and Kansas. With a good radio at night, the signal can be heard over much of the Central and Western United States, and parts of Canada and Mexico. KOA is nicknamed &quot;the Blowtorch of the West&quot;. It is Colorado&#x27;s primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System.

As of November 1, 2015, KOA is also heard on 94.1 MHz K231BQ, which is licensed to Golden, Colorado, as an FM translator of KBCO-HD3. In addition, KOA also simulcasts on translator K231AA (also on 94.1 MHz), licensed to Boulder.

== History ==
KOA was first owned by General Electric and began broadcasting on December 15, 1924. The station started with 5,000 watts, and in 1927, increased to 12,500 watts. KOA became an NBC affiliate in 1929, and the network took over operation of the station from GE shortly thereafter. On July 7, 1934, power was raised to the current level of 50,000 watts. In 1941, NBC, which had been operating KOA and KGO in San Francisco for GE since October 1, 1929, also took over ownership of the stations. NBC continued to own KOA until June 1953 when it sold the station to Metropolitan Television Company, whose principal stockholder was Bob Hope. That same year on Christmas Eve, KOA started a sister TV station, KOA-TV on channel 4; like its radio cousin, it was affiliated with the NBC Television Network. KOA-FM was added in June 1961, which in 1974 became Top 40 KOAQ (Q103). GE repurchased the stations in 1968 and continued to own them until 1983 (keeping the aforementioned channel 4, which was subsequently rechristened as KCNC-TV), when it sold KOA and KOAQ to Belo Corporation. In 1987 Jacor Communications purchased KOA and KOAQ; Jacor was purchased by Clear Channel Communications in 1999. The company rebranded to iHeartMedia in 2014.

Former &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; columnist Mike Rosen, who retired at the end of 2015, was the long-running host of the 1 to 3 p.m. show. Rosen is a fiscal conservative and social libertarian who occasionally was a substitute host for Rush Limbaugh. Common Rosen-isms are &quot;tell me where you sit before you tell me where you stand&quot; and &quot;a politician asks what you want, an economist asks what you want more&quot;. Rosen&#x27;s philosophy is reflected in his recommended reading list which includes Ayn Rand, Adam Smith, Paul Johnson and Thomas Sowell.

Other well-known local voices previously heard on KOA include Bob Martin, Don Zimmer, Gus Mircos, and Alex Stone. Rollye James and George Weber. The late Rick Barber was heard for 30 years on KOA. Consumer advocate Tom Martino and former FEMA official Michael D. Brown were KOA hosts until they switched to sister station KHOW.

Radio host Alan Berg broadcast his talk show from the station, but was shot and killed by members of the white supremacist group The Order on June 18, 1984. Another host from an earlier era was Leigh Kamman, who hosted jazz programs during World War II. Kamman returned to his home state of Minnesota after the war. &quot;The Sports Zoo&quot; with Dave Logan and Scott Hastings ran for 12 years until Hastings left in April 2005 for the Altitude Sports and Entertainment network. Hastings resumed sports radio broadcasting on KKFN in January 2006 alongside former Denver Broncos lineman Alfred Williams. Ken Hamblin, &quot;The Black Avenger&quot;, also hosted a popular and long-running show during the 1980s.

Also in the 1980s, during the weekend evening hours on KOA, Larry Cox, and his dog Wilbur, would host the radio program &quot;The National Recovery Act&quot;, a listener-friendly call-in show. A certain topic was announced and people from all over the nation, picking up the KOA signal at night, would call in with their memories. Big band music from the 1930s and 1940s was also played. The program would always end with the song &quot;And So To Bed&quot;. In December 1987, Cox began a new radio program, &quot;No Place Like Home&quot;, broadcast from his home on Chicago Creek. Listeners would often hear the fireplace crackling and Cox&#x27;s dog, Wilbur, snoring.

With the launch of conservative talk sister station KDFD &quot;Freedom 93.7&quot; in 2019, &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; moved exclusively from KOA to KDFD in September 2019, and the station launched the new afternoon drive show &quot;Big Al &amp; JoJo&quot; (co-hosted by former Denver Broncos player and KKFN host Alfred Williams), resulting in its existing sports show &quot;Logan &amp; Lewis&quot; moving to late-mornings.

In June 2022, longtime co-anchor of &quot;Colorado&#x27;s Morning News&quot; April Zesbaugh retired.

== Awards ==
KOA was one of ten stations honored at the 2007 NAB Crystal Radio Awards for public service awarded by the National Association of Broadcasters. Winners were honored at the radio luncheon on April 17, 2007, during the NAB Show in Las Vegas.

KOA was named &quot;Large Market Station of the Year&quot; at the 2008 National Association of Broadcasters&#x27; Marconi Radio Awards.

<text>Le Téléjournal () is the umbrella title used for the television newscasts aired on the Ici Radio-Canada Télé broadcast network. &quot;Le Téléjournal&quot; (by itself) has been used since 1954 as the title of the network&#x27;s flagship newscast, originating from Montreal, Quebec. It is considered the French language equivalent of the English-language CBC&#x27;s &quot;The National&quot;.

From 1983 to 2006, &quot;Le Téléjournal&quot; was paired with a separate newsmagazine series called &quot;Le Point&quot;, similar to the distinction between CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;The National&quot; and &quot;The Journal&quot;.

Other local and national newscasts airing on Radio-Canada adopted variants of the &quot;Téléjournal&quot; title beginning in the early 2000s. Local newscasts on Radio-Canada stations used to be known as &quot;(city or region name) Ce Soir&quot; (This Evening). They are also now called &quot;Le Téléjournal&quot;, usually followed by the name of the city or region, e.g., &quot;Le Téléjournal/Québec&quot; on CBVT-DT in Quebec City or &quot;Le Téléjournal/Acadie&quot; on CBAFT-DT in Moncton, New Brunswick. The Montreal program is &quot;Le Téléjournal avec Patrice Roy&quot;.

The network&#x27;s national midday newscast, previously &quot;Le Midi&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;heure du midi&quot;, was also renamed &quot;Le Téléjournal/Midi&quot; in the early 2000s. In 2006, its breakfast newscast, &quot;Matin Express&quot;, was renamed &quot;Le Téléjournal/matin&quot;. It was later replaced on Radio-Canada with a simulcast of &quot;RDI Matin&quot;. RDI continues to air a half-hour program titled &quot;Le Téléjournal/matin&quot;.

==Primetime edition==
The flagship newscast is anchored by Céline Galipeau on Mondays to Thursdays and Pascale Nadeau from Fridays to Sundays. The newscast airs live at 10 pm Eastern Time (ET), 11 pm in the Maritimes, 11:30 pm in Newfoundland, on Radio-Canada stations in Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic, and on tape delay at 10 pm local in the western provinces. An early edition of the program used to air on RDI at 9 pm ET, but this has been replaced by a separate program titled &quot;Le Téléjournal RDI&quot;, hosted by Geneviève Asselin. Every Thursday, the Points de vue segment hosted by Galipeau features journalists Tasha Kheiriddin, Michel David and in a question-and-answer session devoted to significant stories of the week.

Bernard Derome anchored the program from 1970 to 1998. He was succeeded by Stéphan Bureau, who anchored the program from 1998 until 2003 when he was replaced by Gilles Gougeon. Derome was brought back as anchor in 2004 in an effort to return the program to its earlier success. He retired from the program again on December 18, 2008. Galipeau, who succeeded Derome as the program&#x27;s main anchor, used to be the weekend anchor.

==Local &quot;Téléjournals&quot;==
Local newscasts under the &quot;Téléjournal&quot; name air on all stations in the Radio-Canada network. The newscasts run for 30 minutes, except for Ontario and some Quebec stations, where it runs for an hour.

<doc id="887259" wikidata="Q5179733" url="?curid=887259" title="Cowl unit">
<text>A cowl unit is a diesel locomotive with full-width, enclosing bodywork, similar in appearance to the cab unit-style of earlier locomotives, such as the EMD F-units of the 1940s and 1950s.  The term cowl unit is of North American origin, although similarly-styled locomotives exist elsewhere.

Unlike a cab unit, whose body is both an enclosure and the main structural member of the locomotive, a cowl unit’s bodywork acts only as a enclosure—the body plays no structural role.  Structural support for the locomotive’s machinery, as well resistance to buff and draft loads, is embodied in the locomotive&#x27;s below-deck frame.  As the body itself is not structural, it can be removed from the chassis, a feature that facilitates heavy maintenance and repair.

Cowl units were originally produced at the request of the Santa Fe railway, their EMD FP45 units having a full-width “cowl” body built on a EMD SDP45 hood unit&#x27;s chassis—the SDP45, in turn, was a stretched version of the EMD SD45 freight unit.  Amtrak’s SDP40F units were also cowl units, and were built up on the EMD SD40-2 freight locomotive chassis.

Most cowl units have been passenger-hauling locomotives.  In this service, the cowl unit&#x27;s full-width bodywork and smooth sides match the rest of the train&#x27;s general appearance, as well as facilitate decoration of the locomotive with the livery desired by passenger operators, e.g., Santa Fe’s distinctive “warbonnet” livery.  With no decking outside of the carbody, such as found on hood-style freight units, a cowl unit’s design tends to discourage unwanted riders.  Furthermore, the smooth outline of the locomotive allows it to be run through the same wash racks used to clean passenger cars.

The main disadvantage of the cowl unit is low rear visibility from the cab. The EMD SD50F and SD60F, GE C40-8M and BBD HR-616 were given a &quot;Draper Taper&quot; (named after its creator, William L. Draper, a former Canadian National assistant chief of motive power), in which the body is narrower immediately behind the cab, and gradually widens further aft, although the roof remains full-width the length of the locomotive.  This arrangement improves rearward visibility to some extent, but such locomotives cannot run in reverse as the lead unit because they do not have ditch lights at both ends.

==LMS 10000 &amp; 10001==
The LMS Diesels 10000 &amp; 10001, later classified as British Rail Class D16/1, were introduced in 1947.  These were Great Britain&#x27;s first mainline diesel locomotives, coming about a decade after America&#x27;s first cab units.  Despite their streamlined exterior, the LMS units are actually cowl units.  It is easy to misinterpret this, because as in North America, cowl designs tend to be more angular in appearance, while cab designs have a similar curved streamlining.

<doc id="887270" wikidata="Q3257839" url="?curid=887270" title="Loft Story (French TV series)">
<text>Loft Story was a French reality show, and it is the first French adaptation of &quot;Big Brother&quot; franchise. The show generally considered is the first of its kind in France. &quot;Loft Story&quot; presented by Benjamin Castaldi and broadcast on M6 from 26 April 2001 to 5 July 2001 for the first season and from 11 April 2002 to 4 July 2002 for the second season.

The French title of the show is a play-on-words on &quot;loft&quot; because the contestants are &quot;locked up&quot; in a loft during their adventure, and &quot;Love Story&quot;.

The initial &quot;Loft Story&quot; inspired the creation of a similar show of the same name in Quebec. The famous eye logo is used by both &quot;Loft Story&quot; versions. It evokes the voyeuristic eye of the television viewer as she or he watches the &quot;Lofteurs&quot; live in front of the cameras. Some of them get gradually voted off the show by viewers on their phones and the last couple win a house. It caused great controversy in France and the house was attacked by protesters.

==Production==

=== Format ===
&quot;Loft Story&quot; is a slightly re-tooled version of the original &quot;Big Brother&quot;, toned down slightly for the French market by production company Endemol.

Eleven singles cut off from the outside world and must live in a loft where all rooms (except toilets and a room imposed by the CSA) are equipped with 26 cameras (including 3 infrared cameras, mostly hidden behind one-way mirrors) and microphones. They are filmed 24 hours a day.

=== Broadcast ===
The live stream is slightly delayed on one or more paid channels of the TPS offer, as well as on the Internet during the first season. A daily program is broadcast after editing this live footage.

=== Presentation ===
The show was presented by Benjamin Castaldi. Two hosts co-hosted the live show from the loft: Marie Guillaumond in 2001 and Séverine Ferrer in 2002.

In 2002, during the second season, there was also a show presented by Max and broadcast on Saturday at 23:55 summarizing the events of the week and welcomed the evicted contestants.

==Series overall==
==Season 1==
*Start Date: 26 April 2001
*End Date: 5 July 2001

===Nominations table===

The contestants released a music single under the name &#x27;Les Lofteurs&#x27;; &#x27;Up and Down&#x27; reached number one in the French charts.

==Criticism==

&quot;Loft Story&quot; became a craze when it was screened, but as it went on, it became extremely criticized, mocked and belittled by the media: the premise of ordinary young people being filmed most of the time in a cozy loft (and letting themselves out, they got a reputation of being stupid), being voted off by people on phones and getting to win money at the end, got it called high-rated &quot;garbage tv&quot;.

&quot;Loft Story&quot; is considered to be the precursor of reality shows in France where the contestants get voted off by viewers.

Like other &quot;Big Brother&quot;-style programs, the show&#x27;s sexual content was criticized as several contestants were seen having intercourse on camera.

<text>The Richmond–San Rafael Bridge (officially renamed the John F. McCarthy Memorial Bridge in 1981) is the northernmost of the east–west crossings of California&#x27;s San Francisco Bay, carrying Interstate 580 from Richmond on the east to San Rafael on the west. It opened in 1956, replacing ferry service by the Richmond–San Rafael Ferry Company, and was officially renamed in 1981 to honor California State Senator John F. McCarthy, who championed the bridge&#x27;s creation.

==History==

===Early proposals===
Proposals for a bridge were advanced in the 1920s, preceding the completion of the Golden Gate Bridge. In 1927, Roy O. Long of The Richmond–San Rafael Bridge, Incorporated, applied for a franchise to construct and operate a private toll bridge. The proposed 1927 Long bridge would have been a steel suspension bridge, carrying a roadway for a distance of at an estimated construction cost of . The bridge would afford a maximum vertical clearance of with a main span. Charles Derleth Jr. was selected as the consulting engineer, after having served in that role for the recently completed Carquinez Bridge. The Long bridge would have spanned San Pablo Bay between Point Orient (in Contra Costa County) to just below McNear&#x27;s Point (in Marin County), and Long was granted the franchise in February 1928 by the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors.

A competing proposed bridge also came out in 1927, from Charles Van Damme of the Richmond-San Rafael Ferry Company. The 1927 Van Damme bridge would have carried a roadway for a distance of at an identical estimated construction cost of . It would have spanned San Pablo Bay from Castro Point (Contra Costa County) to Point San Quentin (Marin County), approximately the same routing as the eventually completed 1956 bridge. Although the 1927 Long bridge had been granted a franchise in February 1928, Van Damme subsequently petitioned to reopen the case, since the ferry company owned the land at the proposed eastern terminus and therefore should have been favored in the franchise selection process. Also, since the ferry company&#x27;s franchise rights were not set to expire until the 1950s, Long&#x27;s 1927 bridge cost would have increased to reimburse losses to ferry revenues. Soon after winning the franchise rights, Long approached Van Damme with an offer to buy the Richmond-San Rafael Ferry Company for .

Van Damme and Long later agreed in September 1928 to merge their interests for a combined bridge proposal between Point San Pablo (Contra Costa County) and McNear&#x27;s Point (Marin County). The combined project, now headed by Oscar Klatt for the American Toll Bridge Company, received approval for the routing from then-Secretary of War Good in May 1929, although vertical and horizontal clearances for the proposed bridge were not fully established at the time. In November 1929, vertical clearance had been increased to to satisfy Navy requirements. The construction permit was issued in February 1930.

Klatt&#x27;s 1929 bridge was dormant for nearly a decade following the issuance of a construction permit in 1930. An extension was filed in 1938 to allow construction to start as late as February 1942, and fresh plans for a bridge district to facilitate financing were announced in 1939. In 1947, interest was revived in bridging Marin and Contra Costa Counties.

===Tomasini&#x27;s San Francisco–Alameda–Marin crossings===
A third bridge was proposed in late 1927 by the enigmatic T.A. Tomasini. Tomasini&#x27;s 1927 bridge called for two lanes of automobile traffic straddling a central rail line from San Pedro Hill (Marin) to San Pablo station (Contra Costa), a distance of over . In 1928, Tomasini presented a revised proposal for a bridge farther south than the other two bridges—spanning the water from Albany (in Alameda County) to Tiburon. The 1928 Tomasini Albany–Tiburon bridge was the longest of the three proposed bridges by a significant margin. The proposed Albany–Tiburon bridge would have been similar in concept to the 1967 San Mateo–Hayward Bridge, with a high-level western section approximately long transitioning to a low-level eastern causeway. The western section featured two spans to cross the navigation channels, with the western navigation span having a minimum vertical clearance of and the eastern navigation span having a minimum vertical clearance of . The navigation channels for the proposed Albany–Tiburon bridge were opposed by shipping interests, who wanted the channels to be wide instead. The cost of the longer spans required would have made the proposed Albany–Tiburon bridge impractical, and Tomasini argued that &quot;any mariner who could not negotiate a bridge such as proposed should lose his license.&quot;
Tomasini would later add a bridge spanning Richardson Bay in March 1928 from Sausalito to Belvedere to his proposal. The additional Sausalito–Belvedere bridge would have been long and wide with a lift span to allow the passage of large vessels, at an estimated cost of . Meanwhile, in April 1928 Tomasini recruited the prominent Ralph Modjeski to serve as the consulting head engineer for the proposed Albany–Tiburon span, and Modjeski promptly complimented the plans that had been drawn up by Tomasini&#x27;s chief engineer, Erle L. Cope. The design for a lift span in the proposed Sausalito–Belvedere bridge was changed to a bascule after public comments were received from a local shipbuilder. Tomasini received a permit for the Sausalito–Belvedere bridge from the War Department in December 1928. Tomasini had planned to commence construction of the Sausalito–Belvedere bridge in July 1930, but he was met with opposition from the Tiburon-Belvedere Chamber of Commerce, who felt the creation of a bridge would eliminate the promised San Francisco-Tiburon ferry service. In 1931, the Richardson Bay Redwood Bridge was opened, which was the largest structure in the world constructed of redwood. The Redwood Bridge carried the Redwood Highway (present-day US 101) and spanned the upper reach of Richardson Bay, eliminating some of the need for the proposed Sausalito–Belvedere bridge. The Redwood Bridge would be replaced by a concrete structure in the 1950s.

Tomasini continued to add to the project scope in July 1928 by proposing a bridge and tunnel to join San Francisco to the proposed Albany–Tiburon bridge. The tunnel would run roughly northeast from Bay Street and Grant Avenue, not far from present-day Pier 39, at a depth of below low tide water level for . At that point, the tunnel would surface northwest of Goat Island, and then transition to a bridge nearly long with a minimum vertical clearance of and two lift spans connecting to the proposed Albany–Tiburon bridge. The cost of the entire project was , split as for the Albany–Tiburon bridge, for the Sausalito–Belvedere bridge, and for the San Francisco–Marin–Alameda tunnel and bridge. Tomasini organized each of the three proposed structures as independent projects, preferably to be built simultaneously, but in the event that one was not approved, it would not delay the construction of the other two. San Francisco&#x27;s board of supervisors rejected Tomasini&#x27;s San Francisco–Marin–Alameda tunnel and bridge in September 1928, although the board&#x27;s action was non-binding.
By February 1932, Tomasini&#x27;s proposed Albany–Tiburon bridge had changed to a combination bridge—tunnel. The bridge portion was a low trestle approximately long, extending westward from Point Fleming in Albany in Alameda County. The proposed tunnel would have been long and ventilated by four towers, emerging at Bluff Point near Tiburon in Marin County. Total estimated cost for the two structures was now and despite opposition from the US Navy, who cited potential navigation hazards, the bridge—tunnel was approved by the War Department in July 1932. Although he had the permit to begin work, Tomasini filed numerous annual extensions to retain the rights through 1941, apparently due to a lack of funding to start work. Tomasini was still scrambling for funding in August 1941, seeking the issue of bonds worth . Tomasini lost the rights to the crossing in October 1941, which was not the first time he was opposed by Earl Warren, who had questioned the validity of Tomasini&#x27;s franchise as early as 1933. Still, Tomasini was doggedly trying to advance his plans as late as 1948.

===Construction: 1953–1957===

In 1949, the County of Marin and the City of Richmond commissioned a preliminary engineering report from Earl and Wright of San Francisco, which concluded that a bridge would be feasible. A follow-up 1950 study, conducted by the Division of San Francisco Bay Toll Crossings, was commissioned by Marin County and the City of Richmond using in state funding. The 1950 report concluded the bridge could be built in accordance with the California Toll Bridge Authority Act. The preliminary design was approved on August 8, 1951 and California approved the preliminary report on November 27, 1951. The California Toll Bridge Authority authorized the issue of in bonds on November 7, 1952 and subsequently sold on February 26, 1953 to construct a single-deck bridge. The remaining was reserved for construction contingencies and to complete the lower deck of the bridge. The $62 million raised from bond sales was divided into three parts: for construction, to address interest obligations on the bonds during the construction period, and in construction contingency. In 1954, Governor Knight declared the second deck should not be delayed in the public interest, and was loaned from the State School Land Fund in 1955 to complete the second deck. The bridge was finished $4 million under budget.

During the study period, an earth and rock-fill bridge with lift structures was considered, but the high-level bridge was chosen as the cost of a low bridge with navigation locks and lifting structures was prohibitive.

The majority of construction costs were tied up in two contracts that opened for bidding on December 19, 1952. The first contract, for the substructure, was awarded to the low bidder, the Ben C. Gerwick, Inc. — Peter Kiewit Sons&#x27; Co. Joint Venture for . The second contract, for the superstructure, was awarded to the low bid of by a joint venture between Peter Kiewit Sons&#x27; Co. — A. Soda &amp; Son — Judson Pacific Murphy Corp. The substructure construction moved rapidly, with an estimated 45% of piers completed approximately a year after the contract was awarded.

The bridge with the upper deck was opened in 1956. It was dedicated on August 31, and opened for traffic on September 1 with one traffic lane per direction. At the time, it was the world&#x27;s second-longest bridge, behind the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, as well as the longest continuous steel bridge. The lower deck opened on August 20, 1957, at which point there were three lanes of traffic per direction.

===Historical notes===
Originally a part of State Route 17, the bridge is now part of Interstate 580.

Upon its opening, the Richmond–San Rafael bridge was the last bridge across San Francisco Bay to replace a previous ferry service, leaving the Benicia–Martinez Ferry across Carquinez Strait as the only remaining auto ferry in the Bay Area (it would be replaced by a bridge in 1962).

==Description==
The bridge—including approaches—measures 5.5 miles (29,040 feet / 8,851.39 m / 8.9 km) long. At the time it was built, it was one of the world&#x27;s longest bridges. The bridge spans two ship channels and has two separate main cantilever spans. Both main cantilever spans are raised to allow ship traffic to pass, and in between, there is a &quot;dip&quot; in the elevation of the center section, giving the bridge a vertical undulation or &quot;roller coaster&quot; appearance and also the nickname &quot;roller coaster span&quot;. To save money, the cantilever main spans share identical symmetric designs, so the &quot;uphill&quot; grade on the approach required for the elevated span is duplicated on the other &quot;downhill&quot; side, resulting in a depressed center truss section. In addition, because the navigation channels are not parallel to each other, the bridge also does not follow a straight line. This appearance has also been referred to as a &quot;bent coat hanger&quot;.

After it was completed, many were disappointed by the appearance of the bridge; Frank Lloyd Wright, a famous designer who was not an engineer, reportedly called for it to be destroyed due to its ugliness, and complained that it was &quot;the most awful thing I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot; during its construction in 1953. Contrariwise, the neighboring Golden Gate Bridge, and the western span of the Bay Bridge, had been considered engineering and historical marvels. However, the project&#x27;s senior engineers were the same ones who had worked on the Bay Bridge, with their design reflecting lessons they had learned from doing so.

From west (Point San Quentin) to east (Castro Point), the bridge consists of:
* A trestle structure supported by fifty-seven bents. The upper deck is , and the lower deck is slightly longer at .
* of girder spans, consisting of nineteen girder spans
* of truss spans, divided into fourteen trusses each long, on average.
* The western cantilever structure, with arms measuring each flanking a central span of . The western cantilever span is the main navigation channel and features a vertical clearance of .
* of truss spans, consisting of ten spans each long, on average.
* The eastern cantilever structure, with arms measuring each flanking a central span of . The eastern cantilever span is the secondary navigation channel and features a reduced vertical clearance of .
* of truss spans, consisting of twelve spans each long, on average.
* of girder spans

Excluding approaches, the bridge structures comprise a total length of on the upper deck and on the lower deck. Despite the varying height of the bridge, roadway grades are limited to 3% or less. As completed, the bridge has two decks each capable of carrying three lanes of traffic. As of 2020, westbound traffic rides on the upper deck and is marked with two lanes of vehicle traffic, as well as a pedestrian/bicycle path separated from vehicles by a movable barrier. Eastbound traffic rides on the lower deck and features two lanes of vehicle traffic as well as a third lane that is activated during evening commute hours and serves as a shoulder when not in use. The extra lane features lights indicating that the lane is open or closed. The third lane has been used for various purposes other than traffic, such as carrying a water pipeline during a drought.

The bridge stands on 79 reinforced concrete piers supported on steel H-piles. Nine piers stand on land, eight are in cofferdams near the Contra Costa terminus, and the remaining 62 are bell-type piers with a flared base. The original deck was a thick reinforced concrete slab, with a mortar wearing surface thick. To facilitate maintenance, the bridge was designed with two lines (carrying compressed air and potable water) extending from end to end. Each deck was also equipped with three overhead maintenance tracks.

===Public transit service===
Golden Gate Transit bus route 580 provides public transportation across the bridge. Formerly route 40, it runs between the San Rafael Transit Center and the El Cerrito del Norte BART station. Golden Gate Transit Route 42, which provided service to Richmond BART/Amtrak station, was folded into route 40 in December 2015 that was later redesignated line 580, after the freeway on which it crosses the bay.

==Tolls==

Tolls are only collected from westbound traffic headed to San Rafael at the toll plaza on the Richmond side of the bridge. All-electronic tolling has been in effect since 2020, and drivers may either pay using the FasTrak electronic toll collection device or using the license plate tolling program. It remains not truly an open road tolling system until the remaining unused toll booths are removed, forcing drivers to slow substantially from freeway speeds while passing through. Effective , the toll rate for passenger cars is $8. During peak traffic hours on weekdays between 5:00 am and 10:00 am, and between 3:00 pm and 7:00 pm, carpool vehicles carrying three or more people, clean-air vehicles, or motorcycles may pay a discounted toll of $4 if they have FasTrak and use the designated carpool lane. Drivers without Fastrak or a license plate account must open and pay via a &quot;short term&quot; account within 48 hours after crossing the bridge or they will be sent an invoice of the unpaid toll. No additional toll violation penalty will be assessed if the invoice is paid within 21 days.

=== Historical toll rates ===
The following initial toll rates were adopted on July 10, 1956, prior to the opening of the bridge:
The basic toll (for automobiles) on the seven state-owned bridges, including the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge, was standardized to $1 by Regional Measure 1, approved by Bay Area voters in 1988 (). A $1 seismic retrofit surcharge was added in 1998 by the state legislature, increasing the toll to $2 (), originally for eight years, but since then extended to December 2037 (AB1171, October 2001). On March 2, 2004, voters approved Regional Measure 2 to fund various transportation improvement projects, raising the toll by another dollar to $3 (). An additional dollar was added to the toll starting January 1, 2007, to cover cost overruns on the eastern span replacement of the Bay Bridge, increasing the toll to $4 ().

The Metropolitan Transportation Commission, a regional transportation agency, in its capacity as the Bay Area Toll Authority, administers RM1 and RM2 funds, a significant portion of which are allocated to public transit capital improvements and operating subsidies in the transportation corridors served by the bridges. Caltrans administers the &quot;second dollar&quot; seismic surcharge, and receives some of the MTC-administered funds to perform other maintenance work on the bridges. The Bay Area Toll Authority is made up of appointed officials put in place by various city and county governments, and is not subject to direct voter oversight.

Due to further funding shortages for seismic retrofit projects, the Bay Area Toll Authority again raised tolls on all seven of the state-owned bridges in July 2010. The toll rate for autos on the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge was thus increased to $5 ().

In June 2018, Bay Area voters approved Regional Measure 3 to further raise the tolls on all seven of the state-owned bridges to fund $4.5 billion worth of transportation improvements in the area. Under the passed measure, the toll rate for autos on the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge was increased to $6 on January 1, 2019; to $7 on January 1, 2022; and then to $8 on January 1, 2025.

In September 2019, the MTC approved a $4 million plan to eliminate toll takers and convert all seven of the state-owned bridges to all-electronic tolling, citing that 80 percent of drivers are now using Fastrak and the change would improve traffic flow. On March 20, 2020, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, all-electronic tolling was put into effect for all seven state-owned toll bridges. The MTC then installed new systems at all seven bridges to make them permanently cashless by the start of 2021. In April 2022, the Bay Area Toll Authority announced plans to remove all remaining unused toll booths and create an open-road tolling system which functions at highway speeds.

The Bay Area Toll Authority then approved a plan in December 2024 to implement 50-cent annual toll increases on all seven state-owned bridges between 2026 and 2030 to help pay for bridge maintenance. The standard toll rate for autos will thus rise to $8.50 on January 1, 2026; $9 in 2027; $9.50 in 2028; $10 in 2029; and then to $10.50 in 2030. And becoming effective in 2027, a 25-cent surcharge will be added to any toll charged to a license plate account, and a 50-cent surcharge added to a toll violation invoice, due to the added cost of processing these payment methods.

==Improvements==

===Seismic retrofit===

In the fall of 2001, the bridge commenced an extensive seismic retrofit program, similar to other bridges in the area. The retrofit was designed by a three-way joint venture between Gerwick/Sverdrup/DMJM under a design contract awarded in 1995. The retrofit is intended to allow the two-tier bridge to withstand a 7.4 magnitude earthquake on the Hayward Fault and an 8.3 magnitude quake on the San Andreas Fault. The foundation piers were strengthened by wrapping the lower section of structural steel in a concrete casing, installing new shear piles, and adding bracing to the structural steel towers. Isolation joints and bearings were also added to the main bridge structures (cantilever spans over the navigation channels) to strengthen the structure.

The fifty-year-old bridge was showing its age and also needed age-related maintenance, which was performed in conjunction with the seismic upgrade work. There were reports of cars being damaged while traveling on the lower deck by fist-sized concrete chunks falling from the joints of upper deck slabs.

A major part of the retrofit involved the long concrete causeway on the Marin side, which as part of the retrofit program, was nearly completely replaced. Because of the active use of the bridge, Caltrans designed the project to allow the bridge to remain open to traffic. For economy, schedule efficiency and traffic impact mitigation, much of the repair work was fabricated off site and shipped to the bridge by barge.

To reduce impacts to traffic the major work was performed at night. Caltrans kept two lanes of traffic moving in each direction during daylight hours, then reduced that flow to a single lane in each direction at night. Thus, one trestle was completely closed, and the other trestle had two-way traffic.

The concrete segments of the trestle were precast in Petaluma and barged to the site. At monthly intervals, tugs positioned barges with one or two , 500-ton pre-cast concrete roadway segments, which a 900-ton barge-mounted crane lifted into place. Earlier, either two or four of the corroded, concrete segments of the old roadway were removed by crane. Then, a pile driver moved into position and drove new piles. After the new concrete road segment was in place, steel plates were used to temporarily fill the gaps, and the roadway was ready for morning traffic. At times, construction backed up traffic to Highway 101 into central San Rafael.

The completion of this retrofit, on September 22, 2005, was celebrated as a success despite the many challenges, including the deaths of two workers.

The retrofit was originally estimated by Caltrans engineers at , but Caltrans adjusted the estimate to in 2000 during the bidding process. While most of the resulting bids were close to , the low bid came in at from the Tutor-Saliba/Koch/Tidewater Joint Venture. Caltrans revised their estimate to in May 2001 when more funds were appropriated for California&#x27;s Toll Bridge Seismic Retrofit Program in Assembly Bill 1171. The cost was again adjusted during an August 2004 review by Caltrans, this time to . The final cost of the retrofit, however, was $778 million, or $136 million below this August 2004 estimate.

===Third lanes===

In both directions, the bridge is wide enough to accommodate three lanes of traffic. The bridge previously operated with all three lanes in both directions opened to traffic after the lower deck was completed in 1957. Currently the third lane on the lower deck is used as a right-hand shoulder or a &quot;breakdown lane&quot; and is marked along the bridge with the signs &quot;Emergency Parking Only&quot;. The third lane on the upper deck is a separated bicycle and pedestrian path.

In 1977, Marin County was suffering one of its worst droughts in history. A temporary on-surface pipeline, long, was placed in the third lane. The pipe transferred of water a day from the East Bay Municipal Utility District&#x27;s mains in Richmond to Marin&#x27;s 170,000 residents. By 1978, the drought subsided and the pipeline was removed. The disused third lane was then restriped as a shoulder.

In 1989, after the Loma Prieta earthquake, the third lane was opened up as a normal lane to accommodate increased traffic after the Bay Bridge was shut down because of a failure of that span. Many commuters from San Francisco drove across the Golden Gate Bridge into Marin and then across the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge to go to Oakland (and vice versa). After the Bay Bridge was reopened, the third lane was again closed.

On February 11, 2015, the Bay Area Toll Authority approved a plan to install a protected bike and pedestrian path on the wide shoulder of the upper deck of the bridge. The path was expected to be complete in 2017, however it opened on November 16, 2019. As part of the same project, a third eastbound lane was added the previous year on the lower deck to be available for evening commutes.

==Closures==
Like most San Francisco Bay bridges, the Richmond–San Rafael is subject to closure in the event of strong crosswinds. The bridge has been closed due to wind at least three times: in 1963, in the late 1970s, and in 2008.

On February 7, 2019, the bridge was closed for several hours due to concrete falling from the upper deck to the lower.

On July 21, 2023, the bridge was closed in the eastbound direction for more than 19 hours due to a disturbed person on the bridge; the goal of this closure was to &quot;not cause him to jump off or cause him to fall into the water and also keeping that communication open.&quot; The bridge reopened following the man&#x27;s rescue.

==In popular culture and film==
The novel &quot;Abuse of Power&quot; by Michael Savage has several important scenes set on the bridge. In one, the hero Jack Hatfield escapes his enemies by climbing the work ladders built into the piers. In the film &quot;Magnum Force&quot;, the bridge is in the background when Dirty Harry and the rookie cop are on motorcycles on the ship&#x27;s decks where they attempt to subdue each other. The bridge is also visible in the 1982 film &quot;48 Hours&quot;.

<text>This Magazine is an independent alternative Canadian political magazine.

==History and profile==
The magazine was launched &quot;by a gang of school activists&quot; in April 1966 as &quot;This Magazine Is About Schools&quot;, a journal covering political issues in the education system.

During its early years, its editorial offices were located near the University of Toronto in space rented from Campus Co-operative Residences Inc., which in the late 1960s spawned the experimental &quot;free university&quot; Rochdale College. The educational philosophy of Rochdale College was influenced by this association, and by several individuals who published in &quot;This Magazine&quot;, especially Dennis Lee. The name was shortened to simply &quot;This Magazine&quot; in 1973, and it gradually expanded its focus to include a wide variety of political, arts and cultural writing from a progressive perspective.

&quot;This Magazine&quot; is one of Canada&#x27;s longest-publishing alternative journals. Praised for integrating commentary and investigative reporting with in-depth arts coverage, it has been instrumental in trumpeting the new works of young Canadian writers and artists. &quot;This Magazine&quot; has introduced the early work of some of Canada&#x27;s most notable writers, critics and artists.

&quot;This Magazine&quot; is published bimonthly by the Red Maple Foundation, a registered charity, and receives financial support from the Canada Council for the Arts and the Ontario Arts Council. It is indexed in the Canadian Periodical Index, the Canadian Literary Press Index, Alternative Press Index and the Canadian Magazine Index, and on microfiche and microfilm from University Microfilm, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

The magazine&#x27;s current editor is Valerie Howes (Interim Editor) and its current publisher is Lisa Whittington-Hill.

<text>Ogrodzieniec is a town in Zawiercie County, Silesian Voivodeship, Poland, with 4,282 inhabitants (2019). It is noted for the extensive ruins of a medieval castle.

Ogrodzieniec is a part of Lesser Poland. Ogrodzieniec lies among the hills of Lesser Poland Upland, on the outskirts of Zagłębie Dąbrowskie. The town has an area of 28 km2, and is located approximately 400 meters above sea level. In the south and west, Ogrodzieniec is surrounded by forests.

==History==
The origins of the town date back to the 11th century. It was a forest settlement, with a wooden castle built along the border of Lesser Poland and Silesia. In 1241, during the first Mongol invasion of Poland, the village and the castle were burned, and afterwards, a new, stone castle was built. Ogrodzieniec received its Magdeburg rights town charter in 1386. It was a local trade center, with merchants and artisans, many of them Jewish. Furthermore, enormous forests attracted noble hunters, including Polish kings. In 1346, Ogrodzieniec Roman Catholic parish church was first mentioned. In the mid-16th century, it was turned into a Calvinist prayer house, and remained so until circa 1630, when it was returned to the Catholics. In the first half of the 18th century, a new, stone church was built, but it was not completed until 1787. Ogrodzieniec was a private town of Polish nobility, including the Pilecki, Firlej, Warszycki and Jakliński families, and was administratively located in the Lelów County in the Kraków Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown.

After the Third Partition of Poland, in 1795, it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, and included within the newly formed province of New Silesia. In 1807 it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw. After its dissolution, since 1815, it belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. After the unsuccessful Polish January Uprising, Ogrodzieniec, like many other locations of Lesser Poland, lost its town charter (1870). In 1888, Ogrodzieniec had 162 houses (most of them wooden), with app. 1,000 inhabitants. After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence and control of Ogrodzieniec. In the Second Polish Republic, Ogrodzieniec belonged to the Kielce Voivodeship.

In September 1939, during the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, German troops massacred a group of Polish boy scouts from Ogrodzieniec in Tucznawa, and also carried out executions of Poles in Ogrodzieniec (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). The town was afterwards occupied by Germany and annexed directly into the Third Reich until 1945. German occupiers planned to change its name into &quot;Bonerburg&quot;.

After the war, until 1956, Ogrodzieniec belonged to Olkusz County of Kraków Voivodeship, then it was moved to Zawiercie County. Town rights were restored in 1973.

==Ogrodzieniec Castle==

Due to the existence of the Ogrodzieniec Castle, the town is a popular tourist center, located on the Trail of the Eagles&#x27; Nests (note: the castle itself does not administratively belong to the town, it lies in the village of Podzamcze, 2 kilometers east of Ogrodzieniec). The castle was built in the 14th century by the Sulimczyk family. It is located on &quot;Góra Zamkowa&quot;, the highest hill of the Polish Jura (515 meters above sea level).

First stronghold was built here in the early 12th century, during the reign of Bolesław III Wrymouth. In 1241, during the Mongol invasion of Poland, it was burned and destroyed, and in the mid-14th century, new, stone complex of a mighty Gothic castle was built here. The castle guarded western border of Lesser Poland, and in 1470 it was purchased by the Salomon family, merchants from Kraków. It then changed hands several times, belonging to the Rzeszowskis, Pileckis, Chełmińskis and finally, the Boner family (since 1523). In 1530 - 1545, Seweryn Boner turned the Gothic stronghold into a Renaissance residence. In 1562, Boner&#x27;s daughter Zofia married Jan Firlej, and the castle, as a dowry, changed hands once more. In 1587, it was captured by Maximilian III, during the War of the Polish Succession. In 1655, it was seized by Swedes (see Deluge). Swedish garrison stayed at the castle for two years, which resulted in its extensive damage. In 1669, the castle was partially restored by its new owner, castellan of Kraków Stanisław Warszycki. In 1695 it was purchased by the Męciński family, and in 1702, once again it was destroyed by Swedish soldiers, during the Great Northern War. After the destruction, the castle remained a ruin, and its subsequent owners could not afford to rebuild the complex. It remained inhabited until circa 1810.

After World War II, the castle was nationalized, and its walls were strengthened in 1949 - 1973, which prevented total collapse of the complex. It now has a status of permanent ruin, and is open to visitors. The castle is popular among film makers; in 1973, some episodes of the TV series &quot;Janosik&quot; were made here, and in 2001, Andrzej Wajda shot &quot;The Revenge&quot; here. Furthermore, in 1984 the castle was presented in Iron Maiden’s video &quot;Behind the Iron Curtain&quot;, in the song &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;. Also, in the Australia television series &quot;Spellbinder&quot;, the castle was used as the ruins of the castle of the old Spellbinders.

<doc id="887283" wikidata="Q1603184" url="?curid=887283" title="Aventail">
<text>An aventail () or camail () is a flexible curtain of mail attached to the skull of a helmet that extends to cover at least the neck, but often also the throat and shoulders. Part or all of the face, with spaces to allow vision, could also be covered. Some featured a ventail (a mail flap next to the mouth), which could be laced or hooked up to cover the lower face, or left loose for easier breathing or speech.

== European history ==
=== Early and High Middle Ages ===
Aventails of chain mail started appearing on Northern European helmets as early as the 6th century, as seen on several Vendel Era helmets, most notably the Valsgärde 8 helmet (580–630 AD) from Uppsala, Sweden, but also the well preserved Coppergate Helmet (ca. 750–800 AD) from York, England. These early appearances varried greatly in configuration, the Valsgärde 8 helmet featuring an aventail which enclosed the entire lower face, throat and neck, versus the Coppergate Helmet, which combines hanging cheek guards with an aventail for the neck (a configuration likely also used on the similar 7th century Anglo-Saxon Pioneer Helmet).

Byzantine helmets also sometimes show evidence of mail aventails. A rare find of a helmet in Yasenovo in Bulgaria, dating to the 10th century, may represent an example of a distinctively Byzantine style. This rounded helmet has a brow-band pierced for the attachment of a face-covering camail.

The enclosed Vendel style aventail came to be the most conventional type going forward into the High Middle Ages. Some configurations fixed the frontal aventail to a spectacle visor (upper face mask) like the Vendel 8 helmet or a nasal guard, notably seen on several Rus&#x27; and Kievan Rus&#x27; high medieval helmets. Other configurations let the aventail hang loose in front of or under the face like a veil, most likely with an inner liner against chafing or padding against blows. A reason to not connect the frontal chain mail to a spectacle visor or nasal guard might have been to allow for a ventail, a flap of mail which allowed the user to open and close the mail over the mouth for added flexibility. Archeological finds of complete aventails from the early medieval period are however sparse and more than often only a few perforated attachment holes remain.

=== Later Middle Ages ===

Early aventails were riveted or otherwise fixed directly to the edge of the helmet, however, beginning in the 1320s in Western Europe, a detachable version replaced this type. The detachable aventail was attached to a leather band, which was in turn attached to the lower border of the helmet by a series of pierced rivets, called vervelles. Holes in the leather band were passed over the vervelles, and a waxed cord was passed through the holes in the vervelles to secure it.
Aventails were commonly seen on bascinets in the 14th century and served as a replacement for a complete mail hood (coif). Some aventails were decorated with edging in brass or bronze links (sometimes gilded), or with a zig-zag lower edge (vandyked). By the mid 14th century, the aventail had replaced the mail coif completely. By the dawn of the 15th century, the plate armored neck guard (gorget) of the Great Bascinet started to replace the aventail.

<doc id="887294" wikidata="Q476977" url="?curid=887294" title="Piece of Mind">
<text>Piece of Mind is the fourth studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It was released on 16 May 1983 in the United Kingdom by EMI Records and in the United States by Capitol Records. It was the first album to feature drummer Nicko McBrain, who had recently left the band Trust and was Iron Maiden&#x27;s drummer until his retirement from touring in 2024.

&quot;Piece of Mind&quot; was a critical and commercial success, reaching number three on the UK Albums Chart and achieving platinum certification in the UK and North America.

==Background==
In December 1982, drummer Clive Burr ended his association with the band due to personal and tour schedule problems and was replaced by Nicko McBrain, previously of French band Trust, as well as Pat Travers and Streetwalkers. Soon afterwards, the band went to Jersey to compose the songs, taking over the hotel Le Chalet (as it was out of season) and rehearsing in its restaurant. In February, the band journeyed for the first time to the Bahamas to record the album at Nassau&#x27;s Compass Point Studios. Recordings were finished in March, and the album was later mixed at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.

This is the first of four Iron Maiden albums that were not named after a song featured on the album itself (though the lyrics in the song &quot;Still Life&quot; contain the expression &quot;peace of mind&quot;). Originally, the release&#x27;s working title was &quot;Food for Thought&quot;—once the band had decided that Eddie would be lobotomised on the front cover—until the band came up with the title &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; in a pub in Jersey during the album&#x27;s writing stage.

Included in the liner notes is a slightly altered version of a passage from the &quot;Book of Revelation&quot;, which reads,

The actual text (from Chapter 21, Verse 4) is nearly identical, except that it reads, &quot;neither shall there be any more pain&quot; rather than &quot;brain&quot;, which was added as a pun on the album&#x27;s title.

In a lower corner on the back side of the album cover, there is this message: &quot;No synthesizers or ulterior motives&quot;.

==Composition==
Lyrically, the album largely reflects the group&#x27;s literary interests, such as &quot;To Tame a Land&quot;, inspired by Frank Herbert&#x27;s 1965 science fiction novel &quot;Dune&quot;; &quot;Sun and Steel&quot;, based on the life of samurai Miyamoto Musashi and its title taken from Yukio Mishima&#x27;s 1968 essay &quot;Sun and Steel&quot;; &quot;Still Life&quot;, influenced by Ramsey Campbell&#x27;s 1964 short story &quot;The Inhabitant of the Lake&quot;, and &quot;The Trooper&quot;, inspired by Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1854). Film influences are also present, such as &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, based on the Brian G. Hutton 1968 film of the same title, scripted by Alistair MacLean, and &quot;Quest for Fire&quot;, based on the 1981 film by Jean-Jacques Annaud, which incorrectly puts together, in the same period of History, dinosaurs and men. On top of this, &quot;Revelations&quot;, written by Dickinson, includes lines from G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s hymn &quot;O God of Earth and Altar&quot;, while the remainder of the song is influenced by Aleister Crowley. More exotic influences include Greek mythology, albeit slightly altered, for &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot;. &quot;To Tame a Land&quot; was meant to be entitled &quot;Dune&quot; after the novel, but after seeking permission from Frank Herbert&#x27;s agents, the band received a message which stated, &quot;Frank Herbert doesn&#x27;t like rock bands, particularly heavy rock bands, and especially bands like Iron Maiden&quot; and were forced to change the name.

=== Hidden message ===
At the beginning of the sixth track, &quot;Still Life&quot;, the band included a hidden message which could only be understood by playing the song backwards. This was a joke and an intended swing back at the critics who had accused Iron Maiden of being Satanic. The backwards-message consists of drummer Nicko McBrain mimicking actor John Bird&#x27;s impression of Idi Amin, uttering the following phrase &quot;What ho said the t&#x27;ing with the three &#x27;bonce&#x27;, don&#x27;t meddle with things you don&#x27;t understand...&quot;, followed by a belch. The phrase itself is taken from the satirical album &quot;The Collected Broadcasts of Idi Amin&quot; (1975) by Bird and Alan Coren. &quot;What ho&quot; and &quot;What ho said the t&#x27;ing&quot; are phrases that also crop up regularly on McBrain&#x27;s &quot;Listen With Nicko!&quot; tracks from &quot;The First Ten Years&quot; collection.

According to McBrain, &quot;We were sick and tired of being labelled as Devil worshippers and all this bollocks by these fucking morons in the States, so we thought, &#x27;Right, you want to take the piss? We&#x27;ll show you how to take the bleeding piss, my son!&#x27; And one of the boys taped me in the middle of this Idi Amin routine I used to do when I&#x27;d had a few drinks. I remember it distinctly ended with the words, &#x27;Don&#x27;t meddle wid t&#x27;ings yo don&#x27;t understand.&#x27; We thought, if people were going to be stupid about this sort of thing, we might as well give them something to be really stupid about, you know?&quot;

==Release and reception==
Preceded by the single &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; on 28 April, &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; was released on 16 May 1983. It peaked at No. 3 in the UK and spent eighteen weeks on the chart.

In North America, the album became the band&#x27;s highest charting thus far, peaking at No.14 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. By July, &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA, rising up to platinum status in 1986. In 1995, the album achieved platinum status in the UK.

In 1983, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; published a poll of the greatest metal albums of all time, with &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; ranking No.1 and &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; at No.2. Reviews were mostly positive, with Sputnikmusic hailing it &quot;easily an album that belongs in your collection&quot; (although they argue that &quot;the likes of &quot;Powerslave&quot; [1984], &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; [1986], and &quot;Brave New World&quot; [2000] would overtake it&quot;). AllMusic described it as &quot;essential for anyone with even the most basic interest in heavy metal&quot;, although &quot;the second half dips a bit from the first&quot;. In a mixed review from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Both &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; and &quot;Powerslave&quot; proceed in kind, albeit with diminished melodic interest...&quot;

It was ranked No. 21 on IGN&#x27;s list of the top 25 metal albums in 2007.
==Tour==
The UK leg of the World Piece Tour opened at Hull City Hall on 2 May. Subsequent legs in Europe, the US, followed by a second European tour were later carried out before the tour concluded on 18 December with a televised performance at Westfalenhalle in Dortmund. A total of 139 shows were performed throughout the tour.

The tour was supported by Grand Prix in the UK, Rock Goddess during the first European leg, Saxon, Fastway, Coney Hatch, Quiet Riot and Axe in the US, and by the Michael Schenker Group during the second European leg. Local Dutch band Vandale also supported the band during their show in Kerkrade.

==Cover versions==
In 2010, Maiden uniteD, featuring lead singer Damian Wilson, released an all-acoustic reinterpretation of the album entitled &quot;Mind the Acoustic Pieces&quot;.

Two songs were covered for the 2008 tribute album &quot;Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden&quot;: &quot;The Trooper&quot; by Coheed and Cambria and &quot;To Tame a Land&quot; by Dream Theater. The latter was also included in the special edition of Dream Theater&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings&quot;.

&quot;The Trooper&quot; has been covered by Finnish doom/death metal band Sentenced on their 1994 EP &quot;The Trooper&quot;, the American heavy metal band Iced Earth on the &quot;tour edition&quot; of their 2011 album, &quot;Dystopia&quot;, the death metal band Vital Remains on the 1998 tribute album &quot;A Call to Irons&quot;, Christian metal band Stryper on the album &quot;The Covering&quot; in 2011, and Swedish lounge act Hellsongs on their 2008 album, &quot;Hymns in the Key of 666&quot;.

&quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; has been covered by Fozzy on their second album, &quot;Happenstance&quot;, in 2002. Fozzy have also covered &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (from &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;) on their debut, &quot;Fozzy&quot;. The song was also covered by Faroese viking metal band Týr on their 2013 album &quot;Valkyrja&quot;, and Deliverance on their 2013 album &quot;Hear What I Say!&quot;.

<doc id="887303" wikidata="Q400558" url="?curid=887303" title="Ahlspiess">
<text>The ahlspiess (or awl pike) was a thrusting spear developed and used primarily in Germany and Austria from the 15th to 16th centuries. The ahlspiess consisted of a long thin spike of square cross section measuring up to about a metre (39 inches) in length, mounted on a round wooden shaft and sometimes secured with a pair of extending from the socket. The length of the shaft ranged from 1.6 to 1.8 m. (5 - 6 feet), and located at the base of the spike was a rondel guard (a circular metal plate) to protect the hands. Large numbers of these weapons have survived and are kept in the arsenal and museums of Vienna as well as the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 

Some ahlspiesse have thicker spikes which are round and much shorter than the usual form. These are seen in 14th-century illustrations, suggesting that they may have been the precursors of the longer type which came later. These shorter forms are also known by the Italian term &quot;candeliere&quot;, which refers to a round candlestick of the period that had in the center a small pricket or spike that held the candle in place. An excavated and partially restored &quot;candeliere&quot; is present in the collection of the castle of Grandson in Switzerland. There were also forms of the ahlspiess which lacked a rondel guard and these were known as &quot;breach pikes&quot;.

The ahlspiess is depicted in numerous pieces of renaissance art, including a scene from the &quot;Très Belles Heures&quot;, a French religious Book of Hours of around 1400. Another is portrayed in a woodcut from the &quot;Nuremberg Chronicle&quot; of 1493, depicting the Red Sea drowning Pharaoh&#x27;s army, which is shown carrying a variety of staff weapons including halberds, flails and military forks as well as an ahlspiess. A third is from the emperor Maximilian&#x27;s book &quot;Der Weisskunig&quot; of the early 16th century in an illustration entitled &quot;The Battle Against the Blue Company&quot; and is shown being carried by a Swiss soldier.

The ahlspiess was used in other countries as well, including England, and was a popular weapon along with the pollaxe in tournament foot combat among armoured knights.

<doc id="887305" wikidata="Q2704441" url="?curid=887305" title="Chilean Civil War of 1891">
<text>The Chilean Civil War of 1891 (also known as Revolution of 1891) was a civil war in Chile fought between forces supporting Congress and forces supporting the President, José Manuel Balmaceda from 16 January 1891 to 18 September 1891. The war saw a confrontation between the Chilean Army and the Chilean Navy, siding with the president and the congress, respectively. This conflict ended with the defeat of the Chilean Army and the presidential forces, and with President Balmaceda committing suicide as a consequence of the defeat. In Chilean historiography the war marks the end of the Liberal Republic and the beginning of the Parliamentary Era.
==Causes==
The Chilean Civil War grew out of political disagreements between the president of Chile, José Manuel Balmaceda, and the Chilean congress. In 1889, the congress became distinctly hostile to the administration of Balmaceda, and the political situation became serious, at times threatening to involve the country in civil war. According to usage and custom in Chile at the time, a minister could not remain in office unless supported by a majority in both houses of the congress. Balmaceda found himself in the difficult position of being unable to appoint any ministers that could control a majority in the senate and chamber of deputies, and at the same time act in accordance with his own views of the administration of public affairs. At this juncture, the president assumed that the constitution gave him the power of nominating and maintaining in office any ministers of his choice and that congress had no power to interfere.

The Congress was now only waiting for a suitable opportunity to assert its authority. In 1890, it came to light that President Balmaceda had decided to nominate a close personal friend as his successor. This brought matters to confrontation and the congress refused to approve a budget for supplies to run the government. Balmaceda compromised with congress, agreeing to nominate a cabinet to their liking on condition that the budget would be approved. This cabinet, however, resigned when the ministers understood the full scope of the conflict between the president and congress. Balmaceda then nominated a cabinet not in accord with the views of Congress under Claudio Vicuña, whom it was no secret Balmaceda intended to be his successor. To avoid opposition to his actions, Balmaceda refrained from summoning an extraordinary session of the legislature for the discussion of the estimates of revenue and expenditure for 1891.
===Crisis===
On 1 January 1891, president Balmaceda published a Manifest to the Nation in various newspapers to the effect that the budget of 1890 would be considered the official budget for 1891. This act was interpreted by the opposition as illegal and beyond the attributes of the executive power. As protest against the action of President Balmaceda, the vice-president of the senate, Waldo Silva, and the president of the chamber of deputies, Ramón Barros Luco, issued a proclamation appointing Captain Jorge Montt commander of the navy, and stating that the navy could not recognize the authority of Balmaceda so long as he did not administer public affairs in accordance with the constitutional law of Chile. The majority of the members of congress sided with this movement, and signed an &quot;Act of Deposition&quot; of President Balmaceda.

==Rebellion of the navy==

On 6 January 1891, the political leaders of the Congressional party embarked on board the armored frigate &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot;, at Valparaíso, and Captain Jorge Montt of that vessel hoisted a broad pennant as commodore of the Congressional fleet. On 7 January the &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot;, accompanied by the &quot;Esmeralda&quot; and &quot;O&#x27;Higgins&quot; and other vessels, sailed out of Valparaiso harbour and proceeded northwards to Tarapacá to organize armed resistance against the president.

For the present, and without prejudice to the future, command of the sea was held by Montt&#x27;s squadron (January). The rank and file of the army remained faithful to the executive, and thus in the early part of the war the &quot;Gobiernistas&quot;, speaking broadly, possessed an army without a fleet, the congress a fleet without an army. Balmaceda hoped to create a navy; the congress took steps to recruit an army by taking its sympathizers on board the fleet.

Immediately on the outbreak of the revolution President Balmaceda published a decree declaring Montt and his companions to be traitors, and without delay organized an army of some 40,000 men for the suppression of the insurrectionary movement. While both sides were preparing for hostilities, Balmaceda administered the government under dictatorial powers with a congress of his own nomination. In June 1891 he ordered the presidential election to be held, and Claudio Vicuña was duly declared chosen as president of the republic for the term commencing in September 1891.

Preparations had long been made for the naval insurrection, and in the end few vessels of the Chilean navy adhered to the cause of Balmaceda. But amongst these were two new and fast torpedo gunboats, &quot;Almirante Condell&quot; and &quot;Almirante Lynch&quot;, and in European dockyards (incomplete) lay the most powerful vessel of the navy, the battleship &quot;Capitán Prat&quot;, and two fast cruisers. If these were secured by the Balmacedists the naval supremacy of the congress would be seriously challenged. The resources of Balmaceda were running short on account of the heavy military expenses, and he determined to dispose of the reserve of silver bullion accumulated in the vaults of the Casa de Moneda in accordance with the terms of the law for the conversion of the note issue. The silver was conveyed abroad in a British man-of-war, and disposed of partly for the purchase of a fast steamer to be fitted as an auxiliary cruiser and partly in payment for other kinds of war material.

===&quot;Itata&quot; incident===

The organization of the revolutionary forces went on slowly. They were experiencing difficulty in obtaining the necessary arms and ammunition. A supply of rifles was bought in the United States, and embarked on board the &quot;Itata&quot;, a Chilean vessel in the service of the rebels. The United States authorities refused to allow this steamer to leave San Diego, and a guard was stationed on the ship. The &quot;Itata&quot;, however, slipped away and made for the Chilean coast, carrying with her the representatives of the United States. A fast cruiser was immediately sent in pursuit, but only succeeded in overtaking the rebel ship after she was at her destination. The &quot;Itata&quot; was then forced to return to San Diego without landing her cargo for the insurgents.

==Hostilities==
The first shot was fired, on 16 January, by the &quot;Blanco&quot; at the Valparaiso batteries, and landing parties from the warships engaged small parties of government troops at various places during January and February. Balmaceda&#x27;s principal forces were stationed in and about Iquique, Coquimbo, Valparaíso, Santiago and Concepción. The troops at Iquique and Coquimbo were necessarily isolated from the rest and from each other, and military operations began, as in the campaign of 1879 in this quarter, with a naval descent upon Pisagua followed by an advance inland to Dolores.

The Congressional forces failed at first to make good their footing (16–23 January), but, though defeated in two or three actions, they brought off many recruits and a quantity of munitions of war. On 26 January they retook Pisagua, and on the 15 February the Balmacedist commander, Eulogio Robles, who offered battle in the expectation of receiving reinforcements from Tacna, was completely defeated on the old battlefield of San Francisco. Robles fell back along the railway, called up troops from Iquique, and beat the invaders at Huara on 17 February, but Iquique in the meanwhile fell to the Congressional fleet on 16 February.

===Battle of Pozo Almonte===

The Pisagua line of operations was at once abandoned, and the military forces of the congress were moved by sea to Iquique, whence, under the command of Colonel Estanislao del Canto, they started inland. The battle of Pozo Almonte, fought on 7 March, was desperately contested, but Del Canto was superior in numbers, and Robles was himself wounded and then executed inside a field hospital and his army dispersed. After this the other Balmacedist troops in the north gave up the struggle. The garrison of Tacna (at that time part of Chile) was driven into Peru, others joined the Congressional Army and the rest made a laborious retreat from Calama to Santiago, in the course of which it twice crossed the main chain of the Andes. These forces were later sent to Coquimbo to form the fifth division of the Presidential Army.

===Sinking of the &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot;===

Early in April a portion of the revolutionary squadron, comprising the armoured frigate &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot; and other ships, was sent southward for reconnoitring purposes and put into the port of Caldera. During the night of 23 April, and whilst the &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot; was lying quietly at anchor in Caldera Bay, the &quot;Almirante Lynch&quot; torpedo gunboat, belonging to the Balmaceda faction, steamed into the bay of Caldera and discharged a torpedo at the rebel ship. The &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot; sank in a few minutes and 300 of her crew perished. This coup severely weakened the Congressional squadron.

===Congressional offensive===

The Revolutionary Junta, created on 13 April, now firmly established in Iquique prosecuted the war vigorously, and by the end of April the whole area was in the hands of the &quot;rebels&quot; from the Peruvian border to the outposts of the Balmacedists at Coquimbo and La Serena. The Junta now began the formation of a properly organized army for the next campaign, which, it was believed universally on both sides, would be directed against Coquimbo. The necessary arms and ammunition were arranged for in Europe; they were shipped in a British vessel, and transferred to a Chilean steamer at Fortune Bay, in Tierra del Fuego, close to the Straits of Magellan and the Falkland Islands, and thence carried to Iquique, where they were safely disembarked early in July 1891. A force of 20,000 men was now raised by the junta, but with weapons and ammunition for only 9,000, and preparations were rapidly pushed forward for a move to the south with the object of attacking Valparaiso and Santiago, because in a few months the arrival of the new ships from Europe would reopen the struggle for command of the sea so the Congressional party could no longer aim at a methodical conquest of successive provinces, but was compelled to attempt to crush the Presidentialist forces at a blow.

Where this blow was to fall was not decided up to the last moment, but the instrument which was to deliver it was prepared with all the care possible under the circumstances. Del Canto was made commander-in-chief, and an ex-Prussian officer, Emil Körner, chief of staff. The army was organized in three brigades of all arms, at Iquique, Caldera and Vallenar. Körner superintended the training of the men, gave instruction in tactics to the officers, caused maps to be prepared, and in general took every precaution that his experience could suggest to ensure success. Del Canto was himself no mere figurehead, but a thoroughly capable leader who had distinguished himself at Tacna (1880) and Miraflores (1881), as well as in the present war. The men were enthusiastic, and the officers unusually numerous. The artillery was fair, the cavalry good, and the train and auxiliary services well organized. About one-third of the infantry were armed with the Austrian Mannlicher magazine rifle, which now made its first appearance in war, the remainder had the French Gras and other breech-loaders, which were also the armament of the Presdidential infantry. Balmaceda could only wait upon events, but he prepared his forces as best he was able, and his torpedo gunboats constantly harried the Congressional navy. By the end of July Del Canto and Körner had done their work as well as time permitted, and early in August the troops prepared to embark, not for Coquimbo, but for Valparaiso itself.

===Lo Cañas massacre===
At the beginning of August the disembarking of the Congressional Army was expected, and both sides were preparing for the coming battles. The Presidential Army had four divisions; Santiago, Valparaiso, Concepcion and Coquimbo, and President Balmaceda had ordered his generals to not engage the enemy unless they had a combined force of al least 14,000 men. But these four division were scattered across the country, with only the Santiago and Valparaiso divisions near each other, the Concepcion division was 311 miles from the Capital and the Coquimbo division 287 miles. As the Junta had only 9,000 men ready for battle they took precautions to prevent the Presidential Army from concentrating its forces.

On 16 August the Revolutionary Committee of Santiago received instructions from the Junta to perform sabotage operations, destroying railroads, bridges and the telegraph. Two days later, a group of 84 young men met at the Lo Cañas Estate, property of Carlos Walker Martinez, a former Senator, member of the Revolutionary Committee and brother of Joaquin Walker Martinez, a member of the Junta. This group was armed with rifles and dynamite to destroy a bridge over the Maipo River to prevent the Concepcion Division from advancing north. They were discovered by a patrol and ambushed by a force of 90 cavalry and 40 infantry men. Few of the revolutionaries died in the ambush, the rest either surrendered, expecting to be taken as POW&#x27;s, or tried to escape but were capture by the cavalry. Commander Alejo San Martin ordered his men to torture and interrogate the prisoners and later he organized a court martial and decided to execute all of the men his troops had captured, later he burned the bodies. 
This massacre had an important effect on the Chilean people, gaining more support for the Junta and making so that those loyal to the President started to waver on their convictions.

===Battle of Concón===
In the middle of August 1891 the rebel forces were embarked at Iquique, numbering in all about 9,000 men, and sailed for the south. The expedition by sea was admirably managed, and on 10 August the Congressional army was disembarked at Quintero, about 20 km. north of Valparaiso and not many miles out of range of its batteries, and marched to Concón, where the Balmacedists were entrenched.

Balmaceda was surprised, but acted promptly. The first battle was fought on the Aconcagua river at Concón on the 21st. The eager infantry of the Congressional army forced the passage of the river and stormed the heights held by the Gobiernistas. A severe fight ensued, in which the troops of President Balmaceda were defeated with heavy loss. The killed and wounded of the Balmacedists numbered 1,600, and nearly all the prisoners, about 1,500 men, enrolled themselves in the rebel army, which thus more than made good its loss of 1,000 killed and wounded.
===Battle of La Placilla===

After the victory at Concón the insurgent army, under command of General Campos, pressed on towards Valparaiso, but were soon brought up by the strong fortified position of the Balmacedist general Orozimbo Barbosa at Viña del Mar, whither Balmaceda hurried up all available troops from Valparaiso and Santiago, and even from Concepcion. Del Canto and Körner now resolved on a daring step. Supplies of all kinds were brought up from Quintero to the front, and on 24 August the army abandoned its line of communications and marched inland. The flank march was conducted with great skill, little opposition was encountered, and the rebels finally appeared to the southeast of Valparaiso.

There, on 28 August, the final struggle in the conflict took place: the decisive battle of La Placilla. Concon had been perhaps little more than the destruction of an isolated corps; the second battle was a fair trial of strength, for Balmaceda&#x27;s generals Barbosa and Alcerreca were well prepared, had massed their troops in a strong position and had under their command the greater part of the existing forces of the president. But the splendid fighting qualities of the Congressional troops and the superior generalship of their leaders prevailed in the end over every obstacle and resulted in victory for the rebels. The government army was practically annihilated, 941 men were killed, including Barbosa and his second in command, and 2,402 wounded. The Congressional army lost over 1,800 men.

Valparaiso was occupied the same evening and three days later the victorious insurgents entered Santiago and assumed the government of the republic soon afterwards. There was no further fighting, for so great was the effect of the battles of Concon and La Placilla that even the Coquimbo troops surrendered without firing a shot.

==Aftermath==
After the battle of Placilla it was clear to President Balmaceda that he could no longer hope to find sufficient strength amongst his adherents to maintain himself in power, and in view of the rapid approach of the rebel army he abandoned his official duties to seek asylum in the Argentine legation. On 29 August, he officially handed power to General Manuel Baquedano, who maintained order in Santiago until the arrival of the congressional leaders on 30 August.

The president remained concealed in the Argentine legation until 18 September. On the morning of that date, when the term for which he had been elected president of the republic terminated, he committed suicide by shooting himself. The excuse for this act, put forward in letters written shortly before his end, was that he did not believe the conquerors would give him an impartial trial. The death of Balmaceda finished all cause of contention in Chile, and was the closing act of the most severe and bloodiest struggle that the country had ever witnessed. In the various engagements throughout the conflict more than 10,000 people died, and the joint expenditure of the two governments on military preparations and the purchase of war material exceeded £10,000,000.

The defeat of the presidential forces opened a so-called &quot;pseudo-parliamentary&quot; period in Chile&#x27;s history, which lasted from 1891 to 1925. As opposed to a &quot;true parliamentary&quot; system, the executive was subject to the legislature but checks and balances of executive power were weakened. The position of President remained as head of state but its powers and control of the government were reduced.

<text>Lionsgate Television is the television division of the American production company Lionsgate Studios.

== History ==
The company was established in July 1997 as Lions Gate Television, Inc. with the establishment of Lionsgate Films. In June 1998, it acquired documentary/reality production company Termite Art Productions but was itself acquired by Erik Nelson in September 2004 and renamed Creative Differences. 

The company acquired Mandalay Television in September 1997, before acquiring a minority investment in Mandalay Entertainment outright before splitting in 2002. Lionsgate sold off its shares in Mandalay Television in April 1999.

In March 1999, Lions Gate Television, Inc. became an incorporated entity. In January 2003, Lionsgate and New Line Television set up a partnership to provide twenty motion pictures designed for television. 

On July 12, 2006, Lionsgate expanded into television syndication when the company acquired television distribution company Debmar–Mercury. Debmar–Mercury syndicated the film library before the acquisition.

20th Television handled advert sales to the series distributed by Debmar–Mercury with the exception of &quot;Meet the Browns&quot;, as the advert sales are handled by Disney–ABC Domestic Television with Turner Television Co. distributing the series.

On March 13, 2012, Lionsgate Television formed a new 50/50 joint venture, Sea to Sky Entertainment, with Thunderbird Films, the company founded by Lionsgate&#x27;s founder and chairman, Frank Giustra. The chairman and chief creative officer (CCO) is currently Kevin Beggs and he is the longest tenured television studio chairman.

<text>CBS Studios, Inc. is an American television production company which is a subsidiary of the CBS Entertainment Group unit of Paramount Global. It was formed on January 17, 2006, by CBS Corporation as CBS Paramount (Network) Television, as a renaming of the original incarnation of the Paramount Television studio.

It is the television production arm of the CBS network (CBS Productions previously assumed such functions until 2004, when it was merged into Paramount Television), and, along with Warner Bros. Television Studios (a part of Warner Bros. Discovery) &amp; CW Studios (network&#x27;s recently-launched production arm), it is also the television production arm of The CW (in which Paramount has a 12.5% ownership stake; along with Warner Bros. Discovery).

==History==

=== Predecessors ===

==== CBS&#x27;s original production and distribution units ====
In 1952, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) formed an in-house television production unit, CBS Productions, as well as facilities in the newly established Television City in the Fairfax District, Los Angeles in Westside. Also formed was CBS Television Film Sales (later known as CBS Films) as the distributor of off-network and first-run syndicated programming to local television stations in the United States and abroad.

In 1963, CBS Studio Center is established in the Studio City district of Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley. In 1970, CBS Films became Viacom Enterprises and was spun off the following year. In 1978, CBS&#x27; production unit gained the secondary/alternate name CBS Entertainment Productions.

In 1994, Westinghouse Electric acquired CBS. Viacom merged with its creator CBS, in 2000.

==== Paramount Pictures&#x27; early television ventures ====
In 1939, experimental television stations were established in Los Angeles (&quot;W6XYZ)&quot; as Television Productions Inc. and Chicago (&quot;W9XBK&quot;) with Balaban and Katz. Commercial broadcasting began in 1943 over &quot;WBKB&quot; in Chicago (now WBBM-TV). Commercial broadcasting began in 1947 over KTLA in Los Angeles. In 1949, Paramount Pictures became the first major studio to establish program syndication with the Paramount Television Network (much of which originated from KTLA). Paramount branched out of broadcasting in 1964 with the sale of KTLA to Gene Autry.

==== Desilu Productions, later Paramount Network Television ====
Desilu Productions was formed in 1950 by Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball. Desilu Studios was established in Hollywood and Culver City in 1957, after Arnaz/Ball purchased the RKO Pictures studio lot. Desilu Sales Inc. was formed in 1962 as the company&#x27;s syndication arm. In 1967, Desilu Productions was acquired by Gulf and Western Industries. The company became the television division of Paramount Pictures Corporation in July, retaining the Desilu name until the end of that year. Desilu Sales, in turn, merged with Paramount&#x27;s syndication division to become Paramount Television Sales.

From 1966 to 1967, Gulf+Western acquired Paramount Pictures. In 1968, Paramount Television, formerly Desilu, was established as the studio&#x27;s television production unit. In 1977, Paramount Television Service was formed. In 1982, Paramount Television Group and Paramount Domestic Television and Video Programming was established. In September 1989, Gulf+Western was reincorporated as Paramount Communications, Inc.. On March 11, 1994, Viacom acquired Paramount Communications. In 1995, Viacom launched the United Paramount Network (UPN) with Chris-Craft Industries.

On August 10, 2004, Viacom merged the international television banners of CBS Broadcast International and Paramount International Television to form CBS Studios International. On September 7, 2004, Viacom merged CBS Productions and Paramount Network Television to form a new entity of Paramount Network Television, also known as CBS Paramount Television Entertainment Group, with CBS Productions becoming an in-name-only unit.

On December 31, 2005, as the CBS/Viacom split took effect, CBS inherited Paramount&#x27;s television program library, with the second incarnation of Viacom keeping Paramount&#x27;s films, the MTV Networks and the BET Networks.

===Formation===
On January 17, 2006, CBS Corporation CEO Les Moonves announced that Paramount Television would be renamed CBS Paramount Television as of that day, and the network division becoming CBS Paramount Network Television, and the domestic distribution arm becoming CBS Paramount Domestic Television.

On September 26, 2006, CBS Corporation merged its television distribution arms—King World, CBS Paramount International Television and CBS Paramount Domestic Television—to form CBS Television Distribution. CBS Home Entertainment was then established as a subsidiary of the latter.

On May 17, 2009, the Paramount name was dropped after a -year loan of its use from sister company Viacom, forming CBS Television Studios.

National Amusements retained majority control of both CBS and the second Viacom. For a short time, many of Paramount&#x27;s theatrical films were distributed domestically by CBS Television Distribution (the new name for the distribution arm as of 2007). Paramount Home Entertainment continues to distribute home video sales of CBS shows through the CBS DVD brand.

From 2009 until 2011, all shows produced by the company aired on either CBS or The CW. In the past, Paramount Television produced shows for all networks, but especially had a good relationship with ABC (much as Universal Television had a good relationship with eventual sister network NBC). &quot;The Cleaner&quot;, which aired on A&amp;E until September 2009, was the most recent show from the company to air on a network other than CBS or The CW (which is ironic when NBC/ABC&#x27;s ownership of A&amp;E is taken into account). This was until BET began airing new episodes of &quot;The Game&quot; in 2011. In 2012, USA Network began airing &quot;Common Law&quot;.

CBS Television Studios does not directly produce any shows appearing on Showtime, a premium cable television network co-owned with the studio. Instead, sister company Showtime Entertainment handles in-house productions for the network. However, CBS Television Distribution and its international arm handle syndication distribution for these shows if they ever appear in syndication.

On October 25, 2018, CBS Television Studios announced the opening of a new animation division, CBS Eye Animation Productions. A new &quot;Star Trek&quot; series entitled &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; was announced simultaneously.

=== ViacomCBS re-merger; rebranding as CBS Studios ===
It was announced on August 13, 2019, that parent company CBS Corporation would reunite with Viacom to form a combined media company and be renamed ViacomCBS (now known as Paramount Global). The merger closed on December 4. For the first time in nearly fourteen years, Paramount Global encompasses the Paramount Pictures film studio, the current incarnation of its television division, and CBS&#x27;s production studio under one umbrella.

On October 8, 2020, it was announced that CBS Television Studios had been renamed CBS Studios as part of a unification of branding elements between CBS divisions, citing that use of the word &quot;Television&quot; in the name was antiquated due to its position of producing programming for multiple platforms.

<text>Three [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorism]] bills were enacted in the Australian Parliament in 2004 by the Howard Coalition government with the support of the Labor Opposition. These were the &quot;Anti-terrorism Bill 2004&quot;, the &quot;Anti-terrorism Bill (No 2) 2004&quot; and the &quot;Anti-terrorism Bill (No 3) 2004&quot;.

==Anti-terrorism Bill 2004==
The Attorney-General, Philip Ruddock, introduced the &quot;Anti-terrorism Bill 2004&quot; on 31 March 2004. He described it as &quot;a bill to strengthen Australia&#x27;s counter-terrorism laws in a number of respects – a task made more urgent following the recent tragic terrorist bombings in Spain.&quot; He said that Australia&#x27;s counter-terrorism laws &quot;require review and, where necessary, updating if we are to have a legal framework capable of safeguarding all Australians from the scourge of terrorism.&quot;

The main provisions of the Bill were:
* to extend the fixed investigation period (that is, the period for which a suspect can be questioned before being either charged or released) under Part 1C of the Crimes Act for investigations into suspected terrorism offences, from 4 to 24 hours. Any such extension would have to be authorised by a magistrate or other judicial officer.
* to permit law enforcement agencies to reasonably suspend or delay questioning of a person suspected of committing a terrorism offence to make overseas inquiries to obtain information relevant to that terrorism investigation.

Ruddock said that the government recognised the need to &quot;ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place to maintain the balance between security and individual rights and freedom.&quot; Existing safeguards in part 1C of the &quot;Crimes Act&quot; continue to apply to terrorist suspects being investigated in accordance with the &quot;Crimes Act&quot; regime. These safeguards include:
* a suspect&#x27;s right to communicate with a legal practitioner, friend or relative, an interpreter or a consular office
* a suspect&#x27;s right to remain silent
* requiring the tape recording of any admissions or confessions made by a suspect as a pre-condition for admissible evidence, and
* a suspect&#x27;s right to a copy of recorded interviews.

The Bill amended a number of Acts:
* the &quot;Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act&quot; to make it an offence for a person to commit hostile activities while serving in any capacity in or with the armed forces of a foreign state.
* the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; to make it an offence for a person to be a member of an organisation found by a court to be a terrorist organisation, and gave the government the power to prescribe organisations for the purposes of the Act. A further amendment to section 102.5 of the Criminal Code introduced new offences of providing training to or receiving training from a terrorist organisation.
* the &quot;Proceeds of Crime Act&quot; to extend the operation of the Act to foreign indictable offences beyond proceeds derived in Australia, to also cover proceeds that have been derived elsewhere and then subsequently transferred to Australia. The Bill defined &quot;foreign indictable offence&quot; to include an offence triable by a military commission of the United States under a specified military order.

The Bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, which recommended some amendments to strengthen safeguards in the Bill. The Labor Opposition then indicated that it would support the Bill if it were amended in accordance with the committee&#x27;s recommendations. The Bill was passed by the House of Representatives without opposition on 13 May. In the Senate the government accepted most, but not all, of the committee&#x27;s amendments. The Australian Democrats, the Australian Greens and independent Senator Meg Lees opposed the Bill in the Senate. The Bill was passed by the Senate with the support of the Opposition on 24 June, was assented on 30 June and came into force on 1 July 2014 as the &quot;Anti-terrorism Act 2004&quot;.

==Anti-terrorism Bill (No 2) 2004==
Ruddock introduced the &quot;Anti-terrorism Bill (No 2) 2004&quot; on 17 June, to amend a number of pieces of legislation to bring them into conformity with the &quot;Anti-Terrorism Act&quot; described above. &quot;Under the new offence,&quot; Ruddock said, &quot;what must be proved is that the person communicates or meets directors, members or promoters of a listed terrorist organisation and in doing so provides support intended to assist the expansion or continued existence of the organisation.&quot;

The Bill amended a number of Acts:
* the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; under the &quot;Crimes Act&quot; was amended to make it an offence to &quot;intentionally associate with a person who is a member or who promotes or directs the activities of a listed terrorist organisation where that association provides support that would help the terrorist organisation to continue to exist or to expand.&quot; 
* the forensic procedure laws in part 1D of the &quot;Crimes Act&quot; was amended to ensure that if a terrorist attack or other mass-casualty disaster were to occur within Australia forensic services from all jurisdictions in Australia would be able to work together, using the national DNA database system, to identify the victims of the disaster and conduct a criminal investigation.
* the &quot;Passports Act&quot; was amended to give Australian authorities, such as the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the power to request an order for the surrender of a person&#x27;s foreign passport.
* the &quot;Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act&quot; was amended to give ASIO the power to demand a person surrender their Australian and foreign passports if the person is subject to a request for consent to apply for a questioning warrant.
* the &quot;Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977&quot; was amended to make decisions of the Attorney-General on security grounds exempt from the application of the Act.

The Bill passed Parliament and was assented to on 16 August 2004 as the &quot;Anti-terrorism Act (No. 2) 2004&quot;.

==Anti-terrorism Bill (No 3) 2004==
Ruddock introduced the &quot;Anti-terrorism Bill (No 3) 2004&quot; on 24 June which reintroduced the provisions of the &quot;Anti-terrorism Bill (No 2), 2004&quot;, relating to the amendment of Part 1D of the &quot;Crimes Act&quot;, the &quot;Passports Act&quot; and &quot;Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act&quot; (described above), which had been separated from that Bill at the request of the Opposition to allow a speedy passage of these non-controversial sections of the Bill.

The Bill was supported by the Opposition and was passed by the House of Representatives on 24 June without opposition. The Bill was then referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee and was debated in the Senate after the Committee reported. The Bill passed Parliament and was assented to on 16 August 2004 as the &quot;Anti-terrorism Act (No. 3) 2004&quot;.

==Criticisms of the legislation==
The Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens opposed the bills on the grounds that they unacceptably abridged the rights of persons and organisations. Some civil liberties organisations also opposed all or parts of the bills. The Castan Centre for Human Rights Law at Monash University said: &quot;No evidence is offered to support this claim that the investigation of terrorist offences is sufficiently complex as to warrant a doubling of the total permitted time of detention from 12 to 24 hours. Indeed, given the breadth of the definition of &#x27;terrorism offences&#x27;, it is difficult to see how such evidence could be produced. The potential subject matters of investigation are simply too varied.&quot;

The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties said: &quot;The Council is in general concerned about any extension of the power to detain people as proposed by this bill.&quot; The Civil Rights Network said: &quot;We are concerned that this proposal does not seem to have arisen from any real, practical difficulty which has been experienced. Further, there has been a complete absence of debate as to the reasons for and necessity of this amendment. When changes to Australia&#x27;s legal system which have the potential to severely impact on individual&#x27;s liberty and rights are proposed it is fundamentally important that the community is properly consulted and informed before our elected representatives act.&quot;

The Law Council of Australia also expressed concerns about some aspects of the bills. &quot;The Law Council is not convinced of the need for this legislation,&quot; the council&#x27;s submission to the Senate inquiry said. &quot;Indeed in our submission the new laws have the potential to operate harshly and will unfairly target members of minority groups, especially those of the Islamic faith.&quot;

<doc id="887344" wikidata="Q3438745" url="?curid=887344" title="Roger Bowen">
<text>Roger Wendell Bowen (May 25, 1932 – February 16, 1996) was an American comedic actor and novelist, best known for his portrayal of Lt. Col. Henry Blake in the 1970 film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

Bowen considered himself a writer who only moonlighted as an actor. He wrote eleven novels (including &quot;Just Like a Movie&quot;) as well as sketches for Broadway and television. He was also one of the co-founders of Chicago&#x27;s comedy and acting troupe The Second City.

==Life and career==
A native of Providence, Rhode Island, Bowen majored in English at Brown University, then attended graduate school at the University of Chicago. While writing theater reviews for &quot;The Chicago Maroon&quot;, he was asked to pen material for an improvisational troupe that included Alan Arkin and Mike Nichols. The troupe, Compass Players, evolved into The Second City. Bowen spent most of the 1960s playing &quot;preppie&quot; types on a number of TV &amp; radio commercials. His first film role was 1968&#x27;s &quot;Petulia&quot;, but his big movie break came in 1970 when he landed the role of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake in Robert Altman&#x27;s film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. Bowen had in fact served in the U.S. Army in Korea, albeit after the Korean War had ended. (After serving in Japan as a Special Agent in the Counter Intelligence Corps (441st CIC Detachment – Bepu Field Office) from 1957–58, Bowen was sent to the 308th CIC Detachment in Seoul, South Korea in 1958.)

After &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Bowen returned to television and gained a fan following as Hamilton Majors Jr., the pleasantly snooty Ivy League CEO of Continental Flange and supportive boss of Herschel Bernardi on the TV sitcom &quot;Arnie&quot; (1970–72). He then joined the cast of &quot;The Brian Keith Show&quot;, and returned to TV commercials and smaller movie roles. In 1976, Bowen appeared in the TV parody film &quot;Tunnel Vision&quot;, doing a convincing Henry Kissinger impersonation that he was often asked to perform at parties around Hollywood. (The film featured a galaxy of comic stars including Chevy Chase, John Candy, Howard Hesseman and Joe Flaherty, but Bowen received top billing as the others were still relatively unknown at the time.) Bowen also played minor roles in such films as &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978), &quot;The Main Event&quot; (1979) and &quot;Zapped!&quot; (1982).

Bowen was a tournament chess player who participated in several events in the 1970s. In the early 1980s, Bowen enjoyed another round of weekly TV work with recurring roles on &quot;House Calls&quot; (starring former &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; sitcom alumnus Wayne Rogers), &quot;At Ease&quot;, and &quot;Maggie Briggs&quot;. He made his final credited film appearance in the 1991 comedy &quot;What About Bob?&quot; starring Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss.

==Personal life==

Bowen met and married the Bronx-raised Ann Raim, in Chicago. After they moved to San Francisco, Ann formed the &quot;Pitschel Players&quot;, an improvisational comedy group, and directed the group of political and social satirists, that played for ten years, performing with Country Joe McDonald, at Episcopal Church of St. John the Evangelist, San Francisco, on weekends at the Intersection for the Arts and other venues in San Francisco and the Bay Area. The Pitschel Players included Paul Willson, John Pray, Robin Menken, John Bailey, James Carroll Pickett III, Gene Babo (musical director) and Edie McClurg (beginning 1975). In 1974, producer Joe Roth and the Pitschel Players relocated to Los Angeles. Soon after 11 November 1973, Roth and Bowen leased 8162 Melrose Avenue, as the &quot;Pitschel Players Cabaret&quot;, which was the former &quot;Ash Grove&quot; nightclub site, and the later L.A. Improv. Al Franken and Tom Davis performed at the &quot;Pitschel Players Cabaret&quot;. David Lander and Michael McKean &quot;moonlighted&quot; by performing at the &quot;Pitschel Players Cabaret&quot;. The &quot;Pitschel Players&quot; appeared in 1977&#x27;s &quot;Cracking Up&quot;.

In 1980, Bowen and Ann moved back to New York.

Bowen died of a heart attack at the age of 63 while on vacation in Marathon, Florida. His death came one day after that of McLean Stevenson, who played Blake for the first three seasons of the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; television series. (Stevenson also died from a heart attack; because of this strange coincidence, Bowen&#x27;s family did not make the news of his death public until a week afterward in an attempt to minimize any confusion over the two actors and their obituaries.)

<text>The Merri Creek is a waterway in southern parts of Victoria, Australia, which flows through the northern suburbs of Melbourne. It begins near Wallan and flows south for 70 km until joining the Yarra River at Dights Falls. The area where the creek meets the river was traditionally the location for large gatherings of the Wurundjeri people and is thought to have been the location for one of the earliest land treaties in Australia between Indigenous Australians and European settlers.

The creek was the site of heavy industrial use throughout much of the 20th century, being home to quarries, landfills and accepting waste runoff from neighbouring factories. This has degraded the riparian ecology of the creek leaving behind pollutants such as heavy metals and various greases. Recent decades have seen some regenerative planting and the foundation of several community groups dedicated to protecting and regenerating the creek&#x27;s ecology.

==Etymology==
In the 1800s, John Batman described a “lovely stream of water” believed to be Merri Creek, but did not give it a name. It was known for a time as Lucy&#x27;s Creek, apparently after Batman&#x27;s daughter. A map dated to 1893 indicated a &quot;Merri Merri Creek&quot;, which was shortened later to &quot;Merri Creek.&quot; Some believe it means “very rocky” or “very stony” to symbolise the volcanic history of the site. The phrase is said to originate from the Woiwurrung language, but its authenticity is disputed by historians and Indigenous Elders.

==Geography==

Over 400 million years ago. the sea covering the area receded, leaving behind a layer of yellowish marine siltstone and sandstone rocks. Around 66 million years ago, non-marine sediments left a sandy layer behind. Over time, the ancestral valley of the Merri Creek developed, eroding through these sediments. Then, from 4.6 to 0.8 million years ago, volcanoes such as Hayes Hill (about 5 km east of Donnybrook) and Mount Fraser (near Beveridge) erupted, sending lava on a journey along the ancestral valleys of the Merri and Darebin Creeks and into the valley of the Yarra River as far as the Melbourne CBD. The modern day Merri Creek was formed over many years by incising through the lava surface. 

Today, the creek begins in Wallan and flows in a southerly direction for 70 km until it joins the Yarra River in Fairfield near Dights Falls and subsequently flows into Port Phillip Bay. Its tributaries include Wallan Creek, Mittagong Creek, Taylors Creek, Malcolm Creek, Aitken Creek, Curly Sedge Creek, Central Creek, Merlynston Creek and Edgars Creek. It flows through, or forms a part of the borders between the suburbs of Wallan, Kalkallo, Donnybrook, Craigieburn, Wollert, Epping, Somerton, Campbellfield, Lalor, Thomastown, Fawkner, Reservoir, Coburg North, Coburg, Preston, Thornbury, Brunswick East, Northcote, Westgarth, Fitzroy North, Clifton Hill and Fairfield before meeting the Yarra River just upstream of Dights Falls.

===Rocky cliff face===
One of the many sites of geological interest
along the Merri valley is the rocky cliff face on the eastern side of Merri Creek visible from the shared path in Clifton Hill. Its tall, cracked (or jointed) basalt columns, formed by cooling lava, are clearly visible and the weathering evident in the rocky riffles midstream where columns have collapsed and tumbled into the stream. Some of the vertical fractures at the top of the cliff appear to be leaning, forming a striking radial pattern.

===Flora and fauna===

As native vegetation has been regenerated, some species of native wildlife have returned to the creek. These include kookaburras, kingfishers, yellow-tailed Black Cockatoos, echdidnas and frogs. There have also been reports of platypuses in the upper northern regions and further south in Coburg.

Merri Creek is also abundant in edible plants, although care should be taken when attempting to identify them. including dandelion, dock, fennel, jerusalem artichoke, numerous brassicas, blackberry nightshade, sorrel, catsear, sowthistle, nettle and many others. Caution is advisable when harvesting fennel and other members of the family Apiaceae, as poison hemlock has been found growing in some areas of the creek.

==History==
The large number of pre and post-contact archaeological sites demonstrate a heavy usage of the area by Indigenous Australians. The creek and surrounding valley was the site of many large gatherings of Aboriginal people and is thought to be the site of one of the earliest land treaties between Aboriginals and Europeans.

===Archaeology===
Many archaeological sites found contain scattered stone artefacts from old campsites, and scarred trees from which traditional people removed slabs of bark to make canoes, containers and shields. The artefact scatters are found because erosion of some sort has exposed the implements which were covered with sediment. The scarred trees are often on the creek bank, fence line or road reserve where they escaped the clearance process. Both site types exhibit traces of the hunting and gathering lifestyle of pre-contact Victoria, and are a fragile and non-renewable historical resource. Aboriginal sites are protected under the Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006.

===Pre-European===

The northern suburbs of Melbourne are built on the unceded land of the Wurundjeri-willam people. During the first years of European colonisation, the Wurundjeri were represented by influential senior men such as Billibellary. His clan lived on the northern bank of the Yarra and their territory extended from Yarra Bend northwards along the Merri Creek.

The creek supplied the Wurundjeri-willam with an abundance of food such as eel, fish, and duck. Women waded through the Merri with string bags suspended around their neck, searching the bottom of the stream for shellfish. Emu and kangaroo were hunted in the surrounding grasslands. In the forests and hills, possum was also a staple source of food and clothing, The flesh of the possum was cooked and eaten, while the skin was saved to be sewn into valuable waterproof cloaks.

===Post-European===

In May 1835, a historic meeting took place between Batman and the Wurundjeri-willam and other clans in which a document was signed that came to be called Batman&#x27;s Treaty. To date, this remains the only treaty ever struck between European settlers and the Indigenous people of Australia. Batman wrote that these negotiations took place beside a &quot;lovely stream of water&quot; which historians now suspect to be the Merri Creek. This treaty was declared invalid by Sir Richard Bourke, the Governor of N.S.W., who was unwilling to recognize and allow the Indigenous people the right to use and control their own land as they saw fit - thus implementing the doctrine of &quot;terra nullius&quot;.

In January 1844, the Wurundjeri-willam hosted an immense gathering of Indigenous people who came from all over central Victoria. An estimated 800 people journeyed to the district to witness important judicial proceedings carried out according to traditions of Aboriginal law.

Since European settlement, the lower reaches of the creek have been significantly degraded by human activity. In the early history of Melbourne, numerous quarries were established along the creek to extract bluestone for the construction of many of the city&#x27;s buildings and paving for roads and lanes. These quarries were later used as landfill for waste. Numerous environmental weeds, such as prickly pear and weeping willows, invaded the banks. Stormwater from suburban streets also drains directly into the creek, bringing rubbish and other pollutants.

===Recent years===

In recent decades, much has been done to remedy the creek&#x27;s condition. As recently as the 1980s, the community considered Merri Creek little more than a weed-choked industrial drain. Things have improved significantly since then, largely thanks to the efforts of local community groups. Today it is a popular destination for residents taking walks and other leisure activities, and is considered a &quot;green oasis&quot; in the northern suburbs. 

Patches of remnant native flora still remain along the creek, and their quality has improved through weed control and ecological burning. Much native vegetation has been replanted by the Merri Creek Management Committee and the volunteer group Friends of Merri Creek. 

Melbourne Water has been involved in a willow control program to improve water flows and allow for the revegetation of sites with indigenous plant species. At times of low flow, water is sustained in the creek through treated outfall from the Craigieburn sewage treatment plant, . 

Water quality was thought to have been insufficient to allow repopulation by platypus, as industrial toxicants have reduced macroinvertebrate productivity to the point where there is insufficient food. However, the first platypus sighting in decades occurred between Thornbury and Coburg in September 2010. Platypus sightings have continued, albeit on a &quot;few and far between&quot; basis, ever since.

==Parks and recreation==
Parks Victoria manages some of the established parklands on the banks of Merri Creek. Facilities include football and cricket ovals, tennis courts and playgrounds. The Merri Creek Trail shared pathway has been established along the banks to take advantage of the improving environment, but the path is broken at Westgarth and North Fitzroy, necessitating traversing St George&#x27;s Road. The CERES Community Environment Park - a community-run farming initiative with plenty of public spaces, cafes and markets - is a popular destination for Melburnians located adjacent to the Merri Creek. The Merri Creek Labyrinth, a circular labyrinth made of stone, is located just off the adjoining trail in Clifton Hill.

<doc id="887351" wikidata="Q5462465" url="?curid=887351" title="Floyd Laughren">
<text>Floyd Laughren (born October 3, 1935) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1971 to 1998 who represented the northern Ontario riding of Nickel Belt. He served in cabinet as Finance Minister and Deputy Premier in the government of Bob Rae.

==Background==
Laughren was born in Shawville, Quebec to parents Irvin and Erma Laughren. He is one of eight children. The family moved to a farm near Caledonia, Ontario where he grew up. He studied business at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute and York University. After graduation, he worked as a manager at a Zellers store. In 1969 he was hired to teach economics at Cambrian College in Sudbury.

Laughren&#x27;s wife Jeanette (née Gossen), whom he married in 1962, died on August 26, 2007. They had three children.

==Politics==
In the 1971 provincial election Laughren ran as the New Democratic Party candidate in the Sudbury-area riding of Nickel Belt. He defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent Gaston Demers by just under 2,000 votes. He was re-elected without difficulty in the elections of 1975, 1977, 1981, 1985, 1987 and 1990.

Laughren was from left-wing of the party, and supported Richard Johnston for the party&#x27;s leadership in 1982. He was not initially an ally of Bob Rae, and was also a frequent rival of fellow Northern Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Bud Wildman for key shadow cabinet postings. Some of the official critic postings that he held included Colleges and Universities, Treasurer, and Natural Resources.

According to journalist Thomas Walkom, Laughren was planning to retire from politics before the 1990 campaign, and only ran again because the election was called before he could coordinate his departure. The NDP won a majority government and Laughren was sworn in as Finance Minister and Deputy Premier on October 1, 1990.

As Finance Minister, Laughren was frequently criticized for presiding over a series of budget deficits (his 1991 budget proclaimed a deficit of almost ten billion dollars) without significant job creation. Laughren&#x27;s defenders have noted that much of North America was mired in a significant recession during this period, and that the outgoing Liberal government of David Peterson significantly underestimated expenditure costs in 1990. It has also been noted that Laughren&#x27;s budgets after 1991 were generally focused on deficit-cutting measures.

Despite his previous reputation for being on the left-wing of the party, Laughren emerged as a proponent of austerity measures and generally centrist policies during his time in government. He also became known as Bob Rae&#x27;s closest ally in cabinet, notwithstanding their previous differences. Along with Rae, he supported the party&#x27;s withdrawal from an earlier pledge to introduce public automobile insurance in the province in 1991. He also approved the introduction of casinos to the province, and was a leading proponent of the Social Contract in 1993.

As the province&#x27;s first socialist Finance Minister, Laughren was nicknamed &quot;Pink Slip Floyd&quot; by the right-wing Sun Media tabloid newspapers and public sector unions OPSEU and CUPE alike. When Liberal Robert Nixon retired from the legislature in 1992, Laughren became its longest-serving member.

The NDP government was defeated in the 1995 provincial election, although Laughren was able to retain Nickel Belt with a somewhat reduced majority. In 1996, he was the only New Democratic MPP from northern Ontario to support Frances Lankin&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to replace Rae as party leader.

===Cabinet positions===

==Later life==
He retired in 1998 and was appointed as chair the Ontario Energy Board. He served a three-year term. In 2001, Laughren was appointed to the Board of Governors for Laurentian University. In 2010, he was made Chair of the Board. In 2000, he received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from that institution.

In 2006, he was appointed by Greater Sudbury mayor David Courtemanche to chair an advisory committee to review and recommend improvements to city services in the five-year-old amalgamated city. Laughren offered 34 recommendations for service improvements when he presented his final report on January 10, 2007.

In 2012, Laughren was appointed to a three-member panel along with Murray Elston and David McFadden to study Ontario&#x27;s electricity distribution system. They released a report that recommended the 73 power distribution utilities be reduced to between 8 and 12 with at least 400,000 customers in each of the new utilities. In 2017, he was made a member of the Order of Ontario.

<text>Canon EOS (Electro-Optical System) is an autofocus single-lens reflex camera (SLR) and mirrorless camera series produced by Canon Inc. Introduced in 1987 with the Canon EOS 650, all EOS cameras used 35 mm film until October 1996 when the EOS IX was released using the new and short-lived APS film. In 2000, the D30 was announced, as the first digital SLR designed and produced entirely by Canon. Since 2005, all newly announced EOS cameras have used digital image sensors rather than film. The EOS line is still in production as Canon&#x27;s current digital SLR (DSLR) range, and, with the 2012 introduction of the Canon EOS M, Canon&#x27;s mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera (MILC) system. In 2018 the system was further extended with the introduction of the EOS R camera, Canon&#x27;s first full frame mirrorless interchangeable lens system.

The development project was called &quot;EOS&quot; (Electro Optical System). EOS is also the name of the goddess of dawn in Greek mythology, which further signifies the design&#x27;s generational stature.

The EOS emblem was created using Handel Gothic typography.

It competes primarily with the Nikon F series and its successors, as well as autofocus SLR systems from Olympus Corporation, Pentax, Sony/Minolta, and Panasonic/Leica.

At the heart of the system is the EF lens mount, which replaced the previous FD lens mount, which mainly supported only manual-focus lenses. The EOS R full frame camera introduced a new lens mount to the system – the RF mount.

==EF lens mount==
The bayonet-style EF lens mount is at the centre of the EOS camera system. Breaking compatibility with the earlier FD mount, it was designed with no mechanical linkages between moving parts in the lens and in the camera. The aperture and focus are controlled via electrical contacts, with motors in the lens itself. This was similar in some ways to Canon&#x27;s earlier attempt at AF with the T80. Other manufacturers including Contax (with its G series of interchangeable-lens 35 mm rangefinder cameras), Nikon&#x27;s 1983 F3AF, and Olympus (with its Four Thirds System) have since embraced this type of direct drive system. It is a large lens mount compared to most of its competition, enabling the use of larger aperture lenses.
==EOS flash system==
The flash system in the EOS cameras has gone through a number of evolutions since its first implementation. The basic EOS flash system was actually developed not for the first EOS camera, but rather for the last high-end FD-mount manual-focus camera, the T90, launched in 1986. This was the first Canon camera with through-the-lens (TTL) flash metering, although other brands had been metering that way for some time. It also introduced the A-TTL (Advanced TTL) system for better flash exposure in program mode, using infrared preflashes to gauge subject distance.

This system was carried over into the early EOS cameras wholesale. A-TTL largely fell out of favor, and was replaced by E-TTL (Evaluative TTL). This used a pre-flash for advanced metering, and used the autofocus system to judge where the main subject was for more accurate exposure. E-TTL II, which was an enhancement in the camera&#x27;s firmware only, replaced E-TTL from 2004.

Canon Speedlite-brand flashes have evolved alongside the cameras. They are capable of wired and wireless multi-flash setups, the latter using visible or infrared pulses to synchronise. Later models, including RT in their model name, can also communicate via radio links, where up to 16 units can make up a network. Canon also produces Speedlite accessories, including the OC-E3 Off-Camera Shoe Cord, which can be used to hand-hold the flash while allowing the camera to control it through the cord. The Off-Camera Shoe Cord is popular among portrait photographers who need to have more control over lighting than a camera mounted flash can offer.
==EOS cameras==
As of 2017, Canon has released no fewer than 70 EOS SLR and DSLR camera models, starting with the introduction of the EOS 650 in 1987. In the 1990s, Canon worked with Kodak to produce digital camera bodies, starting with the EOS DCS 3 in 1995. The first digital EOS SLR camera wholly designed and manufactured by Canon was the EOS D30, released in 2000.

Canon sold two EOS cameras designed to use the APS film format, the EOS IX and the EOS IX Lite.

Canon also sold a manual-focus camera, the Canon EF-M, which used the same EF lens mount as the EOS cameras. It came with all the automatic and manual exposure functions but lacked autofocus. It came equipped with a split-screen/microprism focusing screen for precise manual focusing.

===Eye-controlled focusing===

Through the tracking of eyeball movements, EOS cameras equipped with eye-controlled focusing (ECF) (some identifiable by the suffix E) were able to select the desired autofocus point in the scene, based on where the user was looking in the viewfinder frame. ECF was especially useful in sports photography where the subject may shift its position in the frame rapidly.

EOS cameras equipped with ECF were the EOS A2E (U.S. model names are shown; see the table below for equivalents in other countries), EOS Elan IIE, EOS IXe, EOS-3, EOS Elan 7E, and EOS Elan 7NE.

Canon did not continue its use of eye-controlled focusing for its digital SLRs. The EOS Elan 7NE was the last EOS camera to have this function, until 2021 when Canon reintroduced eye-controlled focus with the EOS R3.

===Quick control dial===

Most prosumer and professional level EOS cameras feature a large quick control dial (QCD) on the camera back. The first (and only) consumer-level EOS camera with this feature was the EOS 760D/Rebel T6s, announced in February 2015. This feature allows easy adjustment of certain parameters using the thumb. The QCD is used for quick access to often-used functions that would otherwise require a more complicated procedure of button presses and dial clicks. Settings such as ISO button, Exposure Compensation button, or menus are all easily available through the QCD.

Cameras equipped with the QCD can easily be operated with one hand (forefinger on the main dial, thumb on the QCD) without taking the eye off the viewfinder.

A QCD is programmed to perform useful functions, which may include setting exposure compensation, setting of aperture in manual exposure mode, and scrolling of images and menus in digital EOS cameras.

===Multi-point autofocus system===
Currently, top-line EOS cameras have either 61 or 65 user-selectable autofocus (AF) points. Autofocus is a camera&#x27;s ability to focus a lens automatically on an object by pressing down on the shutter button. Autofocus most often chooses the closest image in the field of view to focus on. The following EOS cameras feature such a system, with 61 points unless otherwise indicated:
* The EOS 5D Mark III, introduced in March 2012.
* The EOS-1D X, announced in October 2011 and originally scheduled for sale in April 2012, but delayed until June 2012. Since replaced by a Mark II version.
* The EOS 7D Mark II, on sale since November 2014. This APS-C body has Canon&#x27;s first (and so far only) 65-point AF system.
* The EOS 5Ds and 5Ds R, two closely related higher-resolution full-frame bodies otherwise similar to the 5D MkIII, announced in February 2015 with sales beginning in June of that year.
* The EOS-1D X Mark II, the replacement for the original 1D X, announced in February 2016 with sales expected to begin in April of that year.
* The EOS 5D Mark IV, announced in August 2016 as the replacement for the 5D Mk III.
The release of the 5D Mark III gave Canon the lead once again in this category; previously, its top-line cameras had 45 AF points, which led the industry until Nikon released its D3 and D300 DSLRs with 51-point AF systems.

A higher number of AF points increases the chances of a sharply focused photograph in situations where the subject travels across the frame at high speeds (e.g. sports, wildlife).

Having so many AF points also helps relieve the photographer from having to use the &#x27;lock focus and recompose&#x27; method of framing a photograph that can introduce focusing inaccuracy. The camera generally focuses on the closest object or on human faces, which may not be what the photographer wants, so EOS cameras equipped with a multi-point AF system still allow the photographer to manually select an AF point.

The EOS-3, EOS-1V, all EOS-1D models prior to the EOS-1D X, EOS 80D, EOS 77D, and EOS 800D/Rebel T7i feature a 45-point AF system. Most Canon DSLRs introduced since late 2005, starting from the EOS 20D and the Rebel XTi (400D), feature a nine-point AF system in a diamond-shape formation. The EOS 5D, released in 2005, takes this 9-point AF system a step further by introducing six more &#x27;invisible&#x27; AF points (i.e., not user selectable) in helping the camera acquire focus faster during subject tracking. There have been several exceptions to Canon&#x27;s recent rule of a 9-point AF system. The EOS 1000D (Rebel XS) has the 7-point AF system of most older Canon DSLRs. The EOS 7D, released in 2009, has a 19-point AF layout, fitting essentially within the same diamond-shaped area of the frame as the nine-point layout. The EOS 70D, released in August 2013, inherited the 7D&#x27;s 19-point layout, but with fewer AF control options. The 70D system was in turn handed down to the EOS 750D (Rebel T6i) and 760D (Rebel T6s), announced in February 2015. As mentioned above, the EOS 5D Mark III, EOS-1D X, EOS 5DS/5DS R, and EOS-1D X Mark II have 61-point AF layouts. The EOS 6D, released in October 2012, has an 11-point layout. The EOS 80D, announced in 2016, marked the return of 45-point AF systems to the Canon EOS line, as well as the first appearance of a 45-point system in a non-professional body. This system was brought downmarket in 2017 with its inclusion in the upper-entry-level EOS 77D and mid-entry-level EOS 800D/Rebel T7i.

For the earlier generation of 45-point AF system, the central column of 1 or 2 sensors (7 in all up to EOS-1Ds Mk II, EOS-1D Mk II N) are cross-type sensors, which are sensitive to both vertical and horizontal lines to offer a high degree of accuracy. The EOS-1Ds Mk III, replaced by the EOS-1D X, has 19 cross-type sensors for higher accuracy, as well as placing the cross-type sensors to complement the Rule of Thirds. The other Canon professional SLR replaced by the EOS-1D X, the APS-H EOS-1D Mk IV, has 39 cross-type sensors, a major increase from the 19 of the Mk III. Of the 61 AF points of the EOS-1D X and 5D MkIII, 21 central points and 20 outer points are cross-type, and five central points are dual-cross-type (sensitive to diagonal lines in addition to horizontal and vertical). All 65 points of the 7D MkII are cross-type, but only the center point is dual-cross-type.

Similarly, , all AF points on later generations of the X0D series (beginning with the 40D and continuing through the current 80D) are cross-type sensors for higher accuracy, and the center sensor is dual-cross-type for even greater accuracy and sensitivity. In June 2012, the EOS 650D (Rebel T4i) became the first consumer-level Canon to receive this AF system.

===Naming scheme of EOS DSLR and SLR cameras===
Identical Canon models are sometimes marketed under different names in different parts of the world. For example, the &quot;EOS Rebel 2000&quot; known in the Americas is also known as &quot;EOS Kiss III&quot; in Japan, and &quot;EOS 300&quot; in other parts of the world.

===Digital cameras===

Prior to the introduction of the EOS D30 digital SLR, Kodak produced four digital SLRs also sold under the Canon brand. These cameras used a digital camera back with the image sensor and associated electronics designed and built by Kodak together with modified internals of the EOS-1N film SLR. Due to using the Canon EOS body, these four digital SLRs can accept EF lenses. The four cameras were:

After termination of the agreement by Canon, Kodak cooperated with Sigmawho at that time had a Canon licenseto produce the Kodak DCS Pro SLR/c based on a SA9 SLR body in 2004, which was compatible with EF lenses.

The following digital SLRs, starting from the D30, had bodies and sensors completely designed and manufactured by Canon (except for the Canon EOS-1D, which uses a Panasonic sourced CCD sensor).

Canon digital SLRs are equipped with a CMOS sensor (with the exception of EOS-1D that uses a CCD sensor). Canon designs and manufactures their own CMOS sensors.

<text>The EF lens mount is the standard lens mount on the Canon EOS family of SLR film and digital cameras. EF stands for &quot;Electro-Focus&quot;: automatic focusing on EF lenses is handled by a dedicated electric motor built into the lens. Mechanically, it is a bayonet-style mount, and all communication between camera and lens takes place through electrical contacts; there are no mechanical levers or plungers. The mount was first introduced in 1987.

Canon claims to have produced its 100-millionth EF-series interchangeable lens on April 22, 2014.

== History ==

The EF mount replaces its predecessor, the FD mount.
The standard autofocus lens mounting technology of the time used a motor in the camera body to drive the mechanics of the focus helicoid in the lens by using a transfer lever. The key innovation of the EF series was to use a motor inside the lens itself for focusing. This allowed for autofocusing lenses which did not require mechanical levers in the mount mechanism, only electrical contacts to supply power and instructions to the lens motor. The motors were designed for the particular lens they were installed in.

The EF mount reversed the mechanical logic of the FD mount. The FD mount provided the three-eared bayonet fitting on the camera body, and each FD lens provided a breech-lock receptacle to register and fasten the lens to the bayonet. The EF mount reverses this logic, providing the bayonet on each lens, and a receptacle on the camera body.

When the EF mount was introduced in 1987, it had the largest mount diameter (54 mm internal) among all 35 mm SLR cameras.

The EF series includes over eighty lenses, encompassing focal lengths from 8 to 1200 mm. Many EF lenses include such features as Canon&#x27;s ultrasonic motor (USM) drive, an image stabilization system (IS), diffractive optics (DO) and, particularly for L-series lenses, fluorite and aspherical lens elements.

== Versatility ==
Its large diameter and relatively short flange focal distance of 44.0 mm allows mechanical adaptation of EF camera bodies to many types of non-EF lenses. It is possible to mount lenses using the Nikon F mount, Olympus OM, Leica R and universal M42 lens mounts (among others) by the use of a mechanical adapter without electronic control of the aperture or autofocus. In contrast, parfocal adaptation of EF lenses to non-EF camera bodies is not possible with only a mechanical adapter that does not contain optical elements.

EF mount lenses are somewhat compatible with newer Canon bodies, though the reverse is not true:

* EF-S lens mount cameras can mount EF lenses without an adapter
* EF-M lens mount cameras can mount EF lenses with an EF-EOS M adapter
* RF mount cameras can mount EF lenses with a variety of adapters

Lenses for the earlier Canon FD lens mount are not usable for general photography on an EF mount cameras, unless adapters with optical elements are used because they are made for a flange focal distance of only 42.0 mm. Infinity focus would be lost with an adapter which lacks optical elements. The Canon FD-EOS adapter is rare and is only usable with certain FD telephoto lenses. With a manual connection, the aperture and focus controls of the lens cannot be controlled or read from the camera; the lens must be focused manually. Since the only possible metering is through-the-lens, the lens must be manually stopped down to accurately meter at anything less than full aperture. (This is called stop-down metering.)

=== Third-party lenses ===
Compatible third-party lenses with the EF lens mount are manufactured by Yongnuo, Samyang, Schneider, Sigma, Tamron, Tokina, Cosina and Carl Zeiss. The manufacturers of these lenses have reverse engineered the EOS electronics—except Zeiss, which does not have the rights to use the autofocus or the electronic aperture control of EOS cameras . The use of these third-party lenses is not supported by Canon. Sometimes compatibility problems arise, as no third party has access to Canon&#x27;s specifications for camera-to-body communication. These compatibility issues mostly occur when using a newer body with an older third-party lens. Over time, most of these issues have been resolved by the major third-party brands.

=== Third-party cameras ===
Due to the high market penetration of EF-mount lenses, other camera manufacturers began to offer EF-mount cameras. Since the EF-mount was created for SLR cameras with their long focal flange distance, mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras can use EF lenses with a mechanical adaptor that bridges the distance.

Red Digital Cinema Company offers various camera models that can be equipped with an electronic EF-mount.
Many Blackmagic Design cameras are sold in EF-mount variants.
For Sony E-mount various adaptors enable using EF-mount lenses with full electronic control.

== Controls and features ==

Canon EF lenses typically have a number of controls, switches and physical features, used by the photographer to control the lens. The types and number of the controls can vary from lens to lens. With the most basic lenses having only a few, to the most complex having over a dozen different controls and switches.

This is a list of the different controls and switches found on most Canon EF lenses, along with a detailed description on what they are used for.

Lens mount index: This raised, round red mark is found on all EF lenses. It is used for matching the EF lens mount to the mount on an EOS body, so one can connect the lens to the body quickly.

Focusing ring: This control, found on most EF lenses, is used for focusing the lens. It is usually a ring on the lens body, that can be turned.

Zoom ring: This control is found on most EF zoom lenses. It is used for changing the focal length of the lens. The zoom ring usually has certain, common, focal lengths marked on it. To set the zoom ring to any given focal length, one must turn the ring so that the marked focal length matches the zoom index. The zoom index is typically a white, or black, line found next to the zoom ring.
Distance scale window: This feature is found on many EF lenses. This feature, while not a control or switch, is useful to the photographer for determining, or setting, the lens&#x27;s focus distance. It is used in conjunction with the Focusing ring. When rotated, the distance scale will also rotate to show the changing focus distance. On some lenses the distance scale also has an infrared index. These are shown as red markings below the distance scale. This is used for making focus adjustments when the photographer is doing infrared photography, as lenses typically focus infrared light at a different point than visible light, and therefore achieving correct focus using visible light will result in an out-of-focus infrared image. To make an adjustment, first focus the subject, then turn the Focusing ring so it matches the corresponding infrared index mark.
Focus mode switch: This switch is found on most EF lenses that have an autofocus feature. It is used for setting the lens to either autofocus mode, or manual focus. When set to autofocus mode (AF), the lens will autofocus when directed to by the camera. When set to manual focus (MF), the lens is focused using the Focusing ring. Some lenses support full-time manual focusing (FT-M), which allows the photographer to focus the lens manually even with the mode switch set to AF, without damaging the lens (as could happen if a lens without FT-M is manually focused while in AF mode).

Focusing distance range limiter switch: This switch is found on most longer focal length lenses, and macro lenses. It is used for limiting the focusing distance range of the lens when using it in autofocus mode. Most lenses have two settings; these are usually full focus range (from minimum focus distance to infinity), and distant focus range (from halfway point of focus range to infinity). Other lenses have three settings, with the additional setting usually being near focus range (from minimum focus distance to halfway point of focus range). Longer focal length lenses and macro lenses have a relatively long travel distance for the focusing mechanism inside the lens; this feature shortens the autofocus time. When the photographer knows they will not need a certain part of the focus distance range, limiting it will help shorten the autofocus time, and possibly prevent &quot;focus hunting&quot;.

Soft focus ring: This ring is found only on the 135 mm &#x27;Soft Focus&#x27; prime lens, and enables a variable soft focus effect from completely sharp (0) to very soft (2), although it has little effect when used with apertures over f/5.6. Although the ring can be set to any position, two &#x27;stops&#x27; are implemented at positions 1 and 2.
Image stabilizer switch: This switch is found on all EF lenses that feature an image stabilizer. It is used for turning the image stabilizer &quot;on&quot;( | ), or &quot;off&quot;( o ).

Image stabilizer mode switch: This switch is found on many EF lenses that feature an image stabilizer, particularly those of longer focal lengths. The switch has two settings on most lenses: Mode 1 and Mode 2. The newest IS Mark II versions of certain EF super telephoto lenses (the 300mm f/2.8L, 400mm f/2.8L, 500mm f/4L, and 600mm f/4L), plus the 200–400mm f/4L IS and 100–400mm f/4–5.6L IS II, have a third setting, Mode 3. Mode 1 is normal mode, used for typical photography, where the subject does not move. Mode 2 is used for panning; this is useful for sports or wildlife photography, where the subject moves constantly and one will need to pan. Mode 3, intended to track action, is similar to Mode 2 in that it ignores panning; however, it only applies stabilization when the shutter is released—the viewfinder image is not stabilized. One should not use Mode 1 for panning as this will typically cause blurred photographs; the image stabilizer will attempt to correct for all motion, including the panning motion, but cannot do so due to the limited range of motion of the IS mechanism. Older lenses that have an image stabilizer, but do not feature this switch, are permanently in Mode 1. Some newer lenses, such as the Canon EF-S 18-200mm lens, are able to detect if they are being panned in either axis and will automatically disable the stabilization for the axis parallel to movement and therefore do not require this switch.

Autofocus stop buttons: These buttons are found on some super telephoto EF lenses, evenly spaced around the front collar of the lens. They are used for temporarily stopping the autofocus feature of the lens. Only one button needs to be pressed to activate the feature. To use this button, one must first have the autofocus active, then when one wishes to halt autofocus, one presses and holds the button. To resume autofocus, one releases the button. Some newer bodies allow these buttons to be assigned to perform other functions; for instance, the Canon EOS 7D allows the photographer to set these buttons to perform any of six functions.

Focus preset: The focus preset feature is found on most super telephoto EF lenses. The focus preset feature uses one switch, one button, and one ring. It is used for presetting a given focus distance into memory, so that the photographer can quickly recall the focus distance, without the need for autofocus. The switch has three settings &quot;off&quot;( o ), &quot;on&quot;( | ), or &quot;on with sound&quot;( (- ), and is used for turning on the feature, and deciding if sound is desired. The &quot;set&quot; button is used for saving the focus distance into memory. The focus preset ring is used for recalling the memory save point. It is a thin knurled ring, usually located in front of the Focusing ring. To use this feature, one must set the switch to either &quot;on&quot; or &quot;on with sound&quot;, focus the lens to the desired distance, then press the &quot;set&quot; button. After this, when the feature is turned on, the photographer can turn the focus preset ring, and the lens will recall and focus quickly to the distance that was saved. This feature is useful for sports and birding photography (for instance, to allow rapid focusing on the goal or on a spot where the birds may perch).
Filter mounting: This mount is used for attaching filters to EF lenses. There are three types: front threaded mount, inner drop-in mount, and rear gelatin holders. Front threaded filters are used on most lenses, and are attached by threading and tightening the filter. Inner, drop-in filter mounts are used on super telephoto EF lenses. They are attached by first pressing the two buttons on the filter mount, and pulling it out. Then either a round threaded filter is attached, or one can use a gelatin filter. Rear gelatin filter holders are used by cutting out a sheet of gelatin, to the size shown on the back of the lens and then sliding it into the holder. Filter mounts are useful for all types of photography, and every EF lens has either one or two of the three types used.

Lens hood mount: This feature is found on most EF lenses. This mount is used for attaching the lens hood. The hood mount is of a bayonet style on most EF lenses, though a clip-on style hood mount is used for a small selection of current lenses.

Tripod collar: This feature is found on most longer focal length lenses, and macro lenses. The tripod collar is used for attaching the tripod ring. There are two main styles of tripod rings. One type is opened up, placed on the lens&#x27; tripod collar, then closed and tightened. The other type does not open, but instead is slid up the lens from the mount end (which can only be done when the lens is not mounted on a camera body) and tightened. To set the tripod ring so that it is level with the lens, rotate the ring until the index mark on the tripod ring matches the index mark on the distance scale. The tripod ring is used for attaching a tripod/monopod near to the point of balance of the lens-body combination, more conveniently than the camera body. In the case of larger and heavier lenses, there is also less strain on the lens mount if the body is supported by the tripod-mounted lens than if the lens were to be supported by a tripod-mounted body.

== Related technologies ==

=== Ultrasonic motor drive ===

Ultrasonic motor (USM) lenses appeared with the introduction of the EF 300 mm 2.8L USM lens in 1987. Canon was the first camera maker to successfully commercialise the USM technology. EF lenses equipped with USM drives have fast, silent and precise autofocus operations, and consume less power compared to other AF drive motors.

There are three types of USMs: &quot;ring-type USM&quot;, &quot;micromotor USM&quot;, and &quot;Nano USM&quot;. Ring-type USM allows for full-time manual focus (FT-M) operations without switching out of AF mode. Micromotor USM is used to bring down the cost of the lens. It is possible to implement FT-M even with micromotor USM; however, it requires additional mechanical components, and the vast majority of micro-USM lenses do not offer such capability. Nano USM was introduced in 2016 with the release of Canon&#x27;s latest iteration of the EF-S 18–135mm lens. It is intended to offer the AF speed of ring-type USM with the quietness of STM mechanisms (see below).

Some older USM lenses are identified with a gold ring and the word &quot;Ultrasonic&quot; printed in gold on the lens barrel. L lenses with USM don&#x27;t have the gold ring, but they still have the word &quot;Ultrasonic&quot; printed on the lens barrel.

=== Stepping motor ===

Canon announced stepping motor (STM) lenses first in June 2012, alongside the EOS 650D/Rebel T4i/Kiss X6i.

Canon stated that this technology allows smooth and silent autofocus, and with compatible bodies (the first of which is the 650D) will provide continuous autofocus in live view and video. Unlike USM, STM lenses use focus-by-wire to enable full-time manual mode. Two main disadvantages are linked to focus-by-wire: First, the need to computationally process the input before the intended action is executed leads to a sometimes perceptible lag. Second, using the motor requires power, so when an STM lens is not connected to a camera or the camera is switched off, changing the focus is impossible.

All stepping-motor lenses are marked with the letters &quot;STM&quot; on the front of the lens as part of the model designation.

=== Image stabilizer ===

The image stabilization (IS) technology detects handheld motion and optically corrects it. It only corrects handheld motion; if the subject of the photograph is moving, IS will not stop it. It also can only stabilize so much motion, ranging from two to five stops, depending on the specific IS in the lens. Canon has released several versions of the IS system, including the following:

* The first version, first used in the 75-300mm lens (1995), takes approximately one second to stabilize, provides approximately two stops of stability, is not suitable for use on a tripod, or for panning.
* The 300mm 4L IS USM lens, released in 1997, adds IS Mode 2, which detects whether panning is taking place horizontally or vertically, and only compensates for vibration in the plane perpendicular to the plane of panning.
* In 1999, with the release of the IS super-telephoto lenses (300mm 2.8L through 600mm 4L), tripod detection was added, so that the lens could be used on a tripod with IS turned on.
* In 2001, a new version of the Image Stabilizer was created for the 70–200mm 2.8L. This version takes approximately 0.5s and can be stabilized up to three stops.
* In 2006, the 70–200 mm 4L IS USM was released with an Image Stabilizer which allows up to four stops of stabilization.
* In 2008, the 200mm f/2L IS USM was released with a new version of IS which allows up to five stops of stabilization.
* In 2009, the 100 mm 2.8L Macro IS USM became the first Canon lens with a Hybrid Image Stabilizer. In addition to correcting angular movement, Hybrid IS also corrects for shift movement.
* In 2011, with the release of the 300mm 2.8L IS II and 400mm 2.8L IS II, IS Mode 3 was added. This mode is similar to Mode 2, except that stabilization is applied only when the shutter is released.
* Some newer lenses include an Image Stabilizer which can automatically detect whether the user is panning and respond accordingly, and therefore these lenses do not have an IS mode switch.

All EF lenses that support IS have the words &quot;Image Stabilizer&quot; written on the lens. On some of Canon&#x27;s larger telephoto lenses, the words &quot;Image Stabilizer&quot; are etched onto a metal plate affixed to the lens.

=== Diffractive optics ===

Diffractive optics (DO) are special lens elements that are used in some lenses. DO lenses are usually smaller and lighter and are better at handling chromatic aberration, compared to conventional lenses of similar focal length and aperture value. They are more expensive to make. Only the EF 400 mm 4 DO IS USM, its updated Mark II version, and the EF 70–300 mm 4.5–5.6 DO IS USM contain DO elements. DO lenses have a green ring on the barrel.

=== L-series lenses ===
Top range Canon EF lenses are designated &quot;L-series&quot;, or &quot;Luxury&quot; lenses. L series lenses are compatible with the full range of EF or EF-S mounts and, as they are aimed at the high-end user, most also include environmental or weather sealing and a constant maximum aperture. All L lenses are supplied complete with a hood and a pouch or case, which are not generally included with non-L lenses. Distinctive visual cues include a red ring around the lens and an off-white colour on longer-focal-length models. The latter also helps to reflect light and reduce heat absorption and subsequent internal expansion of lens components that can affect the image quality of long focal length lenses.

All L lenses include at least one fluorite, ultra-low-dispersion glass element, super ultra-low-dispersion glass element, and/or certain types of aspherical elements. (Note that a number of non-L lenses also use aspherical elements, and at least one non-L lens has a Super UD element.) Most L lenses feature an ultrasonic motor (USM) for focusing.

==Timeline of innovations==
In 1987 Canon was the first to use USM (Ultrasonic Motor) with the Canon EF 300mm f/2.8L USM.

In 1989 Canon was the first to create a full frame f/1.0 AF (AutoFocus) lens and the only one until today with the Canon EF 50mm f/1.0L USM.

In 1993 Canon was the first to create an interchangeable 10× superzoom lens for SLR cameras. That lens was Canon EF 35-350mm f/3.5-5.6L USM.

In 1993 Canon created the first Super UD (Ultra low Dispersion) lens with the Canon EF 400mm f/5.6L USM.

In 1995 Canon created the first lens with IS (Image Stabilization). That lens was the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM.

Canon in 2001 was the first to create a lens with DO (multi layered Diffractive Optical element) element. That lens was the Canon EF 400mm f/4 DO IS USM.

Canon in 2008 created the first lens with SWC technology (Subwavelength Structure Coating). That lens was the Canon EF 24mm f/1.4L II USM.

Canon in 2009 created the first lens with Hybrid IS (Image Stabilization) which compensates both angle camera shake and shift camera shake with the Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM.

Canon in 2010 was the first to create a lens with Fluoride coating. That lens was the Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6L IS USM.

Canon in 2011 made the first fisheye zoom lens, both circular and rectangular. That lens was the Canon EF 8-15mm f/4L Fisheye USM.

Canon in 2012 made the first wide angle lens with Image Stabilization. That lens was the Canon EF 24mm f/2.8 IS USM.

Canon in 2013 created the first telephoto with built-in 1.4× extender. That lens was Canon EF 200-400mm f/4L IS USM Extender 1.4x.

== Communication protocol ==
The communication protocol between the camera and the lens is 8-data-bit, 1-stop-bit SPI (mode 3). The pins, from right to left on the lens, are:

The information from the lens is used by the camera body for focusing and metering, and with digital camera bodies it is used to record the lens parameters in the Exif data in the images.

All L series primes 135mm or longer, the 400mm DO, the 70–200mm zooms, the 100–400mm zooms, the
200–400mm zoom and the 50mm Compact Macro have three additional communication pins. These additional pins are used by the Canon Extender EF adapters and the &quot;Life-Size Converter EF&quot; to indicate to the lens the change in focal length so that it is able to report the correct focal length and aperture to the camera body when mounted on a teleconverter. The lens also reduces autofocus speed when a teleconverter is attached to improve autofocus accuracy.

== List of Canon EF lenses ==

The &quot;I&quot;, &quot;II&quot;, &quot;III&quot; Roman numeral suffix after the focal length(s) indicates the generation number. While I is used in the table below, it is not used in official Canon model numbers; the original model lacks a Roman numeral and only the second and subsequent generations have them. Roman numerals are used only when the entire model designation—focal length(s), aperture, IS, DO, L status, and motor mechanism—is identical from one version to the next. This means, for example, that when Canon introduced IS to lenses whose prior versions lacked that feature (24mm, 28mm, 35mm IS primes in 2012, 16–35mm IS zoom in 2014), the first IS versions lacked Roman numerals.

The EF lenses are grouped below by their focal lengths:
* Zoom: for zoom lenses that have a range of focal lengths
* Prime: for prime lenses that have a single focal length

=== Zoom ===


=== Prime ===

== Exceptions ==
Canon has two further types of lenses compatible with the EF mount: Tilt-shift and the 1-5x Macro lens, which are not designated EF, but TS-E and MP-E respectively. TS stands for Tilt-shift while MP stands for macro-photo. These types of lenses are not designated EF as they are manual-focus only lenses. They do, however, retain electronic aperture control as well as focus confirmation.

<text>Blain Kevin Morin (born September 30, 1960) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1998 to 1999 who was elected in a by-election. He represented the riding of Nickel Belt in the Sudbury, Ontario, area.

==Background==
Morin was president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, Sudbury district. He subsequently worked for the Ontario Federation of Labour.

==Politics==
Morin ran in a by-election to replace Floyd Laughren, who had retired in 1998. He was elected to the legislature in a by-election on October 1, 1998, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Gerry Courtemanche by 1,364 votes.

In 1999, the provincial ridings of Nickel Belt and Sudbury East were merged for the 1999 provincial election; even during the by-election campaign, Morin was already indicating that he did not intend to compete against Sudbury East&#x27;s popular incumbent Shelley Martel for the merged riding&#x27;s nomination. There was some consideration that he might run for the NDP nomination in the neighbouring riding of Sudbury instead, but he did not do so.

===Electoral record===



==After politics==
After leaving the legislature in 1999, Morin went back to work for CUPE as a health and safety representative.

<text>Jurij Dalmatin ( – 31 August 1589) was a Slovene Lutheran minister, reformer, writer and translator. He translated the complete Bible into Slovene.

==Life==
Born in Krško, Dalmatin came from a Dalmatian family. Until the age of 18, he studied under the Protestant teacher and grammarian Adam Bohorič. Dalmatin next studied in Württemberg and Bebenhausen south of Tübingen. In August 1566 he entered the University of Tübingen, becoming a &quot;baccalarius&quot; in March 1569 and a &quot;magister&quot; in August 1569. He published his magisterial work &quot;De catholica et catholicis disputatio&quot; in 1572. These German studies were funded by Bohorič and the Protestant reformer Primož Trubar. Dalmatin became a preacher in Ljubljana in 1572.

He had a wife named Barbara, with whom he had four children: Janez, Katarina, Elizabeta, and Marko.

He died in Ljubljana in 1589.
==Work==
Dalmatin was the author of several religious books, such as &quot;Karšanske lepe molitve&quot; (&quot;Beautiful Christian Prayers&quot;, 1584), &quot;Ta kratki würtemberški katekizmus&quot; (&quot;The Short Württemberg Catechism&quot;, 1585), and &quot;Agenda&quot; (1589). However, his most important achievement is the complete translation of the Bible into Slovene, which he allegedly wrote to a large extent at Turjak Castle under the protection of the Carniolan governor, Herbard VIII von Auersperg (), and Herbard&#x27;s son Christoph von Auersperg, who are said to have provided for the translator Dalmatin a &quot;Wartburg&quot;-type sanctuary as had been offered to Martin Luther by Frederick the Wise, the Elector of Saxony. This, however, is refuted as pure legend.

The original title of Damatin&#x27;s translation was &quot;Bibilija, tu je vse svetu pismu stariga inu noviga testamenta, slovenski tolmačena skuzi Jurija Dalmatina&quot; (The Bible: That Is, the Entire Holy Scripture of the Old and the New Testament, Translated into Slovene by Jurij Dalmatin), and it was published in 1583, printed in the Bohorič alphabet. The translation set the norm for the Slovene standard language (with later innovations in vocabulary) until the first half of the 19th century.

<text>Witley Common is an area of woodland and heath, close to Witley, Surrey, England. It is part of a much larger Site of Special Scientific Interest, the Thursley, Hankley and Frensham Commons.

The land has been occupied since the Bronze Age — it features a group of four bowl barrows which have been dated to this period. It has been used as common land by many generations over the centuries — particularly for grazing, turf-cutting and, during the 16th and 17th centuries, for iron workings.

Witley Common again proved useful during the First and Second World Wars when the land was used by the army as a training camp (Witley Camp) with up to 20,000 soldiers based there at one point. The poet, Wilfred Owen, was posted there in June 1916, after completing his basic training, to be commissioned into the 2nd Battalion, Manchester Regiment.

In the late 1940s, the common was gradually restored to its pre-war condition.

Today it is managed by the National Trust, to provide a mixture of habitats for wildlife, with birch, oak and pine woodland, as well as open heathland. Birdlife includes willow warblers, tree pipits and woodlarks. The area is populated by many rare species. The area is a water catchment for the upper reaches of the River Wey.

==Witley Centre==
Witley Common contains a nature information centre, known as The Witley Centre, built and managed by the National Trust. The centre features a countryside exhibition and often hosts school groups and children&#x27;s holiday activities.

<text>Henry Percy Brewster (also Persy; November 22, 1816 – December 28, 1884) was a lawyer, statesman, and soldier from Texas. He fought in the Texas Revolution, and as a colonel in the Confederate Army during the Civil War.

==Biography==
Brewster was born in Laurens County, South Carolina. He read for the law and began his practice there. In 1836, while visiting New Orleans, he volunteered to serve in the nascent Texas Army. When Brewster arrived in Velasco, Texas, he was detached from his company to serve as secretary to General Sam Houston. The only action he was in was the Battle of San Jacinto. After that battle he accompanied Houston, who was wounded, to New Orleans.

When he returned to Texas later in 1836 he served briefly as the interim Secretary of War and Navy for President David G. Burnet. In the fall of that year, he established a legal practice at Brazoria. In 1840 he was appointed the District Attorney for the Second Judicial District of Texas, a post he held until 1843. Six years later, Governor of Texas George Tyler Wood appointed him Attorney General of the state of Texas. In 1855 Brewster moved to Washington, D.C. to practice international law.

When the Civil War erupted he returned to Texas, where he was commissioned a captain in the Confederate Army and was appointed adjutant general to General Albert Sidney Johnston on September 11, 1861. The next spring he became Johnston&#x27;s chief of staff and was with the general when he was killed at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. Afterwards he served on the staff of John Bell Hood, where he rose to the rank of colonel.

At the close of the war in 1865, he returned to Texas and practiced law in San Antonio. In 1881 Governor John Ireland appointed him commissioner of insurance, statistics, and history, a position he held until his death in Austin. His body was taken to Galveston and buried in the Gulf of Mexico.

==Honors==
Brewster County, Texas, was named in his memory in 1887.

<doc id="887374" wikidata="Q5025284" url="?curid=887374" title="Cambrian College">
<text>Cambrian College, established in 1967, is a college of applied arts and technology in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, partnered with private Hanson College of Business, Health and Technology in Brampton and Toronto. It is attended primarily by international students. 

== History ==

Cambrian College was founded as a trade school in 1967, during the formation of Ontario&#x27;s college s ystem. It was originally established with campuses in Sudbury, North Bay and Sault Ste. Marie; the North Bay and Sault campuses became the independent Canadore College and Sault College in 1972 and 1973, respectively.

Until 1995, Cambrian was a bilingual institution, offering courses in both English and French. In that year, the French programs were transferred to Collège Boréal.

In 2017 the college was hit with a ransomware attack that downed many systems. 
From 2018 to 2024 Cambrian&#x27;s international student population grew by 208%. In the same time period Cambrian&#x27;s annial revenue went from under $100 million to nearly $300 million.

== Student population and programs ==

The largest college in Northern Ontario, Cambrian College has over 4,100 full-time students and close to 80 full-time programs, a number of which are uniquely suited to the academic and employment aspirations of First Nations people. An additional 9,000 registrations are taken annually for part-time personal, professional and human resources development courses, workshops and seminars. Delivery methods include classroom learning, independent learning, distance education and the Internet.

The various programs at Cambrian College are organized under the umbrella of five larger schools:
*Schools of Business and Information Technology; Creative Arts, Design and Hospitality. 
*Schools of Health Sciences and Emergency Services
*Schools of Justice; Community Services; and General Studies
*Schools of Skills Training; and Community and Corporate Learning
*School of Engineering Technology and Environmental Studies

In May 2021, it was announced that the College would no longer be accepting new applications for the Music Program. Despite the required minimum number of applications being met, the Music Program is not going to have a September 2021 intake of students. 

The percentage of Cambrian student headcount comprised by international student has grown significantly over the past decade. In 2013-14 learners on a student visa comprised 2% of total student headcount. In 2021-22 that number had grown to 56%. 

== Student associations ==
Cambrian is also home to 3 particular student government associations; SAC (Students Administrative Council), CNSA (Cambrian Native Students Association) and the CAA (Cambrian Athletics Association). All three provide essential services to students, although SAC represents every student on campus and provides specific services regarding students and student life. These services range from basic student services like faxing and mailing duties; to the executive council members of SAC dealing with academic appeals, clubs and associations duties, college-wide changes, leadership and other concerns. The executive of SAC reports to a student body elected President (As do the CAA and CNSA)..

== Computer and engineering technology ==
The energy systems program was launched in fall 2007 at the Barry Downe campus and features &quot;The Living Building Project&quot; which has received significant government and industry funding. Students in the energy systems program take classes in areas as varied as chemistry, instrumentation and biology and take a hands-on role in the construction and design of &quot;The Living Building Project&quot;.

== University transfer agreements ==

Cambrian College has agreements with universities in Canada and in countries that include Australia and the USA that enhance student mobility between college and university. These agreements formally recognize credits earned at each institution and facilitate the transfer of these credits between institutions.

== Cambrian College in Toronto, Brampton and Vancouver ==

In 2005, Cambrian College entered into a partnership with Hanson Canada to create Cambrian @ Hanson. At the three campus locations in Toronto, Brampton and Vancouver, Hanson is delivering Cambrian College programs exclusively to international students. Hanson is also a registered Private Career College in both Ontario (registered with MTCU) and in BC (registered with PTIB). A report commissioned by the Ontario Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development (MAESD) in 2017 stated that private public partnership arrangements pose unacceptable risks. This includes limited ability to ensure academic standards and potentially subverting the intent of Canada’s federal immigration strategy. This lead the government of the day to direct a phase out of public private college partnerships, a decision that was later reversed by the Ford Government.

== Media ==
In 2009, &quot;The Shield&quot;, Cambrian&#x27;s student-run newspaper was replaced by a daily-updated website, cambrianshield.ca, and a new glossy magazine. The first edition of &quot;the Shield&quot; magazine was released on November 6. Both are put together by students in the college&#x27;s journalism program. In March 2013 the website and magazine was shut down after the journalism program was suspended in 2012.

Students of the Broadcast — New Media program also host shows on Laurentian University&#x27;s campus station CKLU-FM.

=== Radio ===
Cambrian College had a closed-circuit radio station called CCRS &quot;Cambrian College Radio Station&quot; which was heard around the campus. It is unknown when the station was launched or shutdown.

==Sports==
The college is represented in the Canadian Colleges Athletic Association by the Cambrian Golden Shield.

* Brian Hayes, Canadian politician
* Will Morin, Canadian politician
* Glenn Thibeault, Canadian politician

<doc id="887376" wikidata="Q4750019" url="?curid=887376" title="An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon">
<text>An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon is a book written by the English trader and sailor Robert Knox in 1681. It describes his experiences some years earlier in the Kingdom of Kandy, on the island today known as Sri Lanka. It provides one of the most important contemporary accounts of 17th century Sri Lankan life.

==History==
Knox spent 19 years in Sri Lanka after being taken prisoner by the Kingdom of Kandy during the reign of Rajasinha II. He survived by knitting caps, selling goods and lending rice and corn. He finally escaped with one companion in 1679 and reached Arippu, a Dutch settlement on the north-west coast of the island, from where he was able to return to England in 1680.

The book was written during the voyage to England. It came to the attention of Knox&#x27;s employers, the directors of the British East India Company, who recommended its publication. The historian and biographer John Strype, Knox&#x27;s cousin, helped him to prepare the book for publication with the encouragement of the natural philosopher and polymath Robert Hooke. It was printed by Richard Chiswell, the printer to the Royal Society, under the imprimaturs of the Society and the Company. When the book was published in 1681 it was widely read and was translated in Knox&#x27;s lifetime into German (1689), Dutch (1692) and French (1693) editions. It made Knox internationally famous and was a major influence on the works of Daniel Defoe; &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and the later &quot;Captain Singleton&quot; both draw on the experiences of Knox.

==Contents==
The &quot;Relation&quot; has a wider literary importance in influencing the development of the English novel. Knox uses direct and idiomatic language to provide detailed descriptions of the factual reality that he saw during his time on Ceylon. He paints a portrait of himself as a practical, self-sufficient and robust individual, very much like Defoe&#x27;s shipwrecked mariner. The book is of fundamental importance as a source for the economic history and anthropology of Ceylon during this period due to the objectivity and detail of the text, in which Knox provides closely observed descriptions of Sinhalese topography, economic and social life, cultural characteristics and conditions in the kingdom of Kandy. It is divided into four parts; the first three describe the kingdom of Kandy, and the final part details Knox&#x27;s escape from captivity.

The preface provides maps and descriptions of Tamil royal and rural life in the country Vanni which he stumbled into in the north and east of the island. The book is accompanied by seventeen copperplate engravings of unknown provenance to illustrate topics addressed by Knox. The engravings are not particularly artistically accomplished, but they do fit the text well. However, the artist suffers from evidently not having seen his subjects; H. A. I. Goonetileke comments that &quot;the animals are near caricatures and the human subjects are obviously based on more familiar European models.&quot; The non-English editions of the book imitate or adapt the original English engravings. The Dutch edition, for instance, incorporates engravings by Jan Luyken which are based on the English originals but provide a more animated setting, with more detailed backgrounds of buildings and landscapes.

<doc id="887386" wikidata="Q16850340" url="?curid=887386" title="Jobs created during U.S. presidential terms">
<text>Politicians and pundits frequently refer to the ability of the president of the United States to &quot;create jobs&quot; in the U.S. during his term in office.
The numbers are most often seen during the election season or in regard to a president&#x27;s economic legacy. The numbers typically used and most frequently cited by economists are total nonfarm payroll employment numbers as collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a monthly and annual basis. The BLS also provides numbers for private-sector non-farm employment and other subsets of the aggregate.

Among the presidents from Jimmy Carter to Donald Trump, Bill Clinton created the most jobs at 18.6 million, while Ronald Reagan had the largest cumulative percentage increase in jobs at 15.6%. This computation treats the base month as the December before the month of inauguration and last month as December of the final full year in office. Using the month after inauguration as the base month as shown in the accompanying diagram, the top four presidents in terms of cumulative job creation percentage are Clinton (D), Reagan (R), Carter (D), and Obama (D).

==Methodology==
The jobs numbers are reported as part of the &quot;Monthly Employment Situation Report&quot; from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The widely publicized &quot;job creation&quot; number is a net figure, computed as jobs created less jobs lost during the survey month. Estimates are generated via the &quot;Establishment Survey&quot;, also known as the payroll survey or Current Employment Statistics (CES) program. The Establishment Survey as of May 2020 included &quot;approximately 145,000 businesses and government agencies representing approximately 697,000 worksites.&quot; The Establishment Survey publishes jobs, hours, and earnings estimates at varying levels of detail (nation, state, metro area) and for different industries.

The sample establishments are drawn from private non-farm businesses such as factories, offices, and stores, as well as federal, state, and local government entities. Employees on non-farm payrolls are those who received pay for any part of the reference pay period (which includes the 12th of the month), including persons on paid leave. Further, BLS explains that: &quot;The CES employment series are estimates of nonfarm wage and salary jobs, not an estimate of employed persons; an individual with two jobs is counted twice by the payroll survey. The CES employment series excludes employees in agriculture, private households, and the self-employed.&quot; These monthly job counts are revised (sometimes by 20% or more) within 90 days to reflect additional data, seasonal adjustment models, and annual adjustments resulting from unemployment insurance filings. Figures are seasonally adjusted, which removes from the series the effects of normal variation from recurring events within a year, such as holidays and weather changes, and helps reveal underlying economic trends.

Journalist Glenn Kessler of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; explained in 2020 that economists debate which month to use as the base for counting job creation, between either January of the first term (the month of inauguration) or February. Survey data is typically from around the twelfth of the month, so January numbers are counted before the new president takes office. For that reason, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; uses the February jobs level as the starting point. For example, for President Obama, the computation takes the 145.815 million jobs of February 2017 and subtracts the 133.312 million jobs of February 2009 to arrive at the 12.503 million figure. Four of the top five presidents in terms of total jobs added were Democrats. For these 13 presidents beginning with Truman, total job creation was 2.4 times faster under Democrats, 70.5 million for the seven Democratic presidents and 29.1 million for the six Republican presidents. The Democratic presidents were in office for a total of 429 months, with 164,000 jobs per month added on average, while the Republicans were in office for 475 months, with a 61,000 jobs added per month average. The table below summarizes the results for the past seven presidents, with data through January 2021 for President Trump:


==Controversy==
The exact usefulness of these numbers is debated. On the one hand, they include only nonfarm payroll employment, which excludes certain types of jobs, notably the self-employed. However, as a semi-balancing factor, they count one person with two jobs as two employed persons.

Additionally, for at least the first eight months of a president&#x27;s term, he inherits a budget proposed and implemented by his predecessor (as well as an overall economy which may be in decline or recovery). The data in columns shown for September (in &quot;italic&quot;) correlate better with the federal fiscal year starting each October, showing the impact of a given president and resulting federal budget on the job count.

Moreover, according to the United States Constitution, the United States Congress is responsible for government spending and thus, regardless of presidential advocacy, bears constitutional responsibility for such things as spending and tax policy that have enormous effects upon the economy. Furthermore, it is debatable how much effect any president realistically could have on a system as large, diverse, and complex as the U.S. economy. Nevertheless, the nonfarm payrolls number is the one most frequently used in the media and by economists, largely because the alternative (household survey numbers) is thought to drastically overestimate employment.

Another factor to consider is population growth, which provides opportunities for the creation of jobs, rendering these figures less impressive, or in the case of the already subpar, clearly insufficient.

The Heritage Foundation has pointed to Alan Greenspan&#x27;s general economic optimism in 2004 as support for household survey numbers over payroll numbers. However, the subsequent downturn, and Greenspan&#x27;s admission of having been wrong, may have discredited that view.

According to a Harris Poll, despite persistent reports that inflation is falling and the unemployment rate is nearing a 50-year low, two-thirds of Americans (68%) are unhappy with the economy.

==Job creation lists==
===By four-year presidential term===
Numbers listed from 1941 and onward are Bureau of Labor Statistics data of nonfarm jobs (in thousands), and are shown from the year beginning and ending each presidential term. The monthly statistics are quoted from January, as U.S. presidents take office at the end of that month.

<text>Dragonslayer is a 1981 American dark fantasy film directed by Matthew Robbins from a screenplay he co-wrote with Hal Barwood. It stars Peter MacNicol, Ralph Richardson, John Hallam, and Caitlin Clarke. It was a co-production between Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Productions, where Paramount handled North American distribution and Disney handled international distribution through Buena Vista International. The story is set in a fictional medieval kingdom where a young wizard encounters challenges as he hunts a dragon, Vermithrax Pejorative.

It is the second joint production between Paramount and Disney, after &quot;Popeye&quot; (1980), and is more mature than most contemporary Disney films. Because the audience expected the film be solely children&#x27;s entertainment, the violence, adult themes and brief nudity were somewhat controversial, though Disney did not hold the North American distribution rights. The film was rated PG in the U.S. Like &quot;The Black Hole&quot; (1979), the version of the film broadcast on the Disney Channel was edited to remove two scenes.

The special effects were created at Industrial Light and Magic, the first use of ILM outside of a Lucasfilm production. Phil Tippett had co-developed an animation technique there for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) called go motion, a variation on stop motion. This led to the film&#x27;s nomination for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, but it lost to &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, the only other visual effects nominee that year, whose special effects were also provided by ILM. Including the hydraulic model, the dragon consists of 16 puppets dedicated to flying, crawling, or breathing fire.

The film received generally positive reviews from critics, but it performed poorly at the box office, grossing $14.1 million worldwide against a production budget of $18 million. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score, which went to &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. It was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, again given to &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. On October 21, 2003, &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; was released on DVD in the U.S. by Paramount Home Entertainment. The film was re-released in remastered format on Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD on March 21, 2023, in the U.S. by Paramount Home Entertainment.

== Plot ==
Urland, a sixth-century kingdom near the River Ur, is being terrorized by Vermithrax Pejorative, a 400-year-old dragon. To appease Vermithrax, King Casiodorus offers it virgin girls selected by lottery twice a year. An expedition led by Valerian, a young man, seeks help from the last sorcerer, Ulrich of Cragganmore.

Tyrian, the captain of Casiodorus&#x27;s Royal Guard, and his lieutenant Jerbul intimidate Ulrich, doubtful of his abilities. Ulrich invites Tyrian to stab him to prove his magical powers. Tyrian complies and Ulrich dies. Ulrich&#x27;s elderly servant Hodge cremates the wizard&#x27;s body and places the ashes in a leather pouch.

Ulrich&#x27;s young apprentice Galen Bradwarden is selected by the wizard&#x27;s magical amulet as its next owner; encouraged, he journeys to Urland. En route, he discovers that Valerian is a young woman disguised to avoid being selected in the lottery. To discourage the expedition, Tyrian kills Hodge. Before dying, Hodge hands Galen Ulrich&#x27;s ashes and reveals that the wizard wanted them spread over a lake of burning water.

In Urland, Galen inspects Vermithrax&#x27;s lair and magically seals its entrance with a rockslide. Tyrian apprehends Galen and takes him to Casiodorus. Casiodorus disputes that Galen is a real wizard and complains that his attack may have angered Vermithrax instead of killing it, as his brother and predecessor once did. Casiodorus confiscates the amulet and imprisons Galen. His daughter, Princess Elspeth, visits Galen, who mentions rumors that the lottery is rigged; it excludes her name and those others whose families are rich enough to bribe Casiodorus into disqualifying their children. Casiodorus cannot lie convincingly when she confronts him over this.

Meanwhile, Vermithrax escapes its prison, causing an earthquake. Galen escapes from his prison, but without the amulet. The village priest, Brother Jacopus, leads his congregation to confront Vermithrax, denouncing it as the Devil. Vermithrax incinerates him and then heads for the village of Swanscombe, burning all in its path.

When the lottery begins anew to placate it, Elspeth rigs the draw so that only her name can be chosen. Desperate, Casiodorus returns the amulet to Galen so that he might save Elspeth. Galen uses the amulet to enchant a spear (forged by Valerian&#x27;s father and dubbed &quot;Sicarius Dracorum&quot;, or &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;) with the ability to pierce Vermithrax&#x27;s armored hide. Valerian gathers molted dragon scales to create a shield for Galen. Valerian laments that, her disguise now blown, she will be eligible for the lottery since she is still a virgin. Galen admits that he has fallen in love with her, and the two kiss.

To rescue Elspeth, Galen fights and kills Tyrian. Elspeth, however, wants to make amends for all the girls whose names have been chosen in the past; she descends into Vermithrax&#x27;s cave and dies. Galen follows her and finds young dragons feasting on her corpse. He slays them and goes on to find Vermithrax resting within an underground lake of fire. He wounds Vermithrax, but the spear&#x27;s shaft is broken in the battle. Only Valerian&#x27;s shield saves him from incineration.

After his failure to kill Vermithrax, Valerian convinces Galen to leave Swanscombe with her. As both prepare to depart, the amulet gives Galen a vision of the &quot;burning water&quot; within Vermithrax&#x27;s cave. Galen realizes that Ulrich planned his own death and cremation, being too old and frail to make the journey himself.

Galen returns to the cave and spreads the ashes over the fiery lake. Ulrich is resurrected. He reveals that his time is short, and that Galen must destroy the amulet &quot;when the time is right&quot;. Ulrich then transports himself to a mountaintop, summons a storm and confronts Vermithrax. After a battle, Vermithrax snatches Ulrich and flies away with him. Cued by Ulrich, Galen crushes the amulet with a rock. Ulrich&#x27;s body explodes and kills Vermithrax, which falls from the sky.

Casiodorus arrives and drives a sword into Vermithrax&#x27;s carcass to claim the glory for himself. While leaving Urland with Valerian, Galen confesses that he misses both Ulrich and the amulet. He says, &quot;I just wish we had a horse.&quot; A white horse then appears, insinuating that the amulet&#x27;s power is now within Galen. The couple mount the horse and ride away.

== Production ==
=== Conception ===
According to Hal Barwood, Matthew Robbins and he got the inspiration for &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; from &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; sequence in &quot;Fantasia&quot;. They later came up with a story after researching St. George and the Dragon. Barwood and Robbins rejected the traditional conceptions of the medieval world to give the film more realism: &quot;Our film has no knights in shining armor, no pennants streaming in the breeze, no delicate ladies with diaphanous veils waving from turreted castles, no courtly love, no holy grail. Instead, they set out to create a very strange world with a lot of weird values and customs, steeped in superstition, where the clothes and manners of the people were rough, their homes and villages primitive, and their countryside almost primeval, so that the idea of magic would be a natural part of their existence.&quot; For this reason, they chose to set the film after the end of Roman rule in Britain, prior to the arrival of Christianity. Barwood and Robins began to hastily work on the story outline on June 25, 1979, and completed it in early August. They received numerous refusals from various film studios, due to their inexperience in budget negotiations. The screenplay was eventually accepted by Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures, becoming the two studios&#x27; second joint effort after &quot;Popeye&quot; (1980).

=== Dragon ===

About 25% of the film&#x27;s budget went into the dragon&#x27;s special effects. Graphic artist David Bunnett was assigned to design the look, and was fed ideas on the movement mechanics, and then rendered the concepts on paper. They decided early to emphasize flying, because the most important sequence is the final battle. Bunnett gave it a degree of personality, deliberately trying to avoid the creature from &quot;Alien&quot;, which he believed was &quot;too hideous to look at&quot;.

After Bunnett handed his storyboard panels to the film crew, the dragon design used a wide variety of techniques. The final creature is a composite of several different models. Phil Tippett of ILM finalized the design, and sculpted a reference model, which Danny Lee of Disney Studios closely followed in constructing the larger dragon props for close-up shots. Two months later, Lee&#x27;s team finished a 16-foot head and neck assembly, a 30-foot tail, thighs, legs, claws capable of grabbing a man, and a wing section. The parts were flown to Pinewood Studios outside London in the cargo hold of a Boeing 747.

Brian Johnson was hired to supervise the special effects, and began planning on- and off-set effects with various specialists. Dennis Muren, the effects cameraman, stated, &quot;We knew the dragon had a lot more importance to this film than some of the incidental things that appeared in only a few shots in &quot;Star Wars&quot; or &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. The dragon had to be presented in a way that the audience would be absolutely stunned.&quot;

After the completion of principal shooting, a special-effects team of 80 people at ILM studios in northern California worked eight months in producing 160 composite shots of the dragon. Chris Walas sculpted and operated the dragon head used for close-up shots. The head measured 8 ft in length. The model was animated by a combination of radio controls, cable controls, air bladders, levers, and by handthus giving the illusion of a fully coordinated face with a wide range of expressions. Real World War II-era flamethrowers were used for the dragon&#x27;s fire-breathing effects. The animals used for the dragon&#x27;s vocalizations included lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, alligators, pigs, camels, and elephants.

Phil Tippett built a model for the dragon&#x27;s walking scenes. He did not want to use standard stop motion animation techniques, and had his team build a dragon model that would move during each exposure, rather than in between, as was once the standard. This process, named go motion by Tippett, was tested with motion control in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. To make the motion even smoother, they decided to use a motorized rod puppet with a computer program that recorded the creature&#x27;s movements in motion as a real animal would move, which added motion blur and removed the jerkiness common in prior stop-motion films.

Ken Ralston was assigned to the flying scenes. He built a model with an articulated aluminum skeleton for a wide range of motion. Ralston shot films of birds flying to incorporate their movements into the model. As with the walking dragon, the flying model was filmed using go motion techniques. The camera was programmed to tilt and move at various angles to convey the sensation of flight.

=== Casting ===
Peter MacNicol first met Robbins in the office of casting director, Debby Brown, who had seen MacNicol&#x27;s work as Benvolio in Romeo and Juliet at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. She had left a note backstage for him, encouraging him to move to New York, saying, &quot;he would do well there&quot;. He took her advice. On his first day in New York City, MacNicol stopped by Brown&#x27;s office to tell her he was now a Manhattan resident. While there, he heard the loud voices of actors coming from Brown&#x27;s audition room. He asked Brown if anything right for him was in the project. She responded with a smile, &quot;Well...actually, there is.&quot; An hour later, MacNicol was the front runner for the role of Galen. He was flown to England along with Caitlin Clarke for a screen test. Within a day or two, Paramount and Disney had said yes, and he was renting a flat in Chelsea. MacNicol had grown up riding horses—his first paid job was on a ranch near Arlington, Texas—so the young actor knew how to ride, even jump hurdles without a saddle, but during his pre-filming, he needed to learn to ride the type of trooper-style saddle they were using in the movie. Because he would have to ride on camera during action sequences, his riding skills had to be stress-tested. &quot;They took away my stirrups, they took away my reins and whipped the horse, and then they told me to windmill my arms and turn a complete circle in the saddle. Then, they took away the saddle!&quot; The young actor had already worked for two years in classical repertory theater and was highly trained in voice production. Nevertheless, a voice coach was hired to achieve the mid-Atlantic sound the role required. Having studied stage combat at the University of Minnesota (two years of classes in tumbling, foil, saber, rapier, and dagger), he was eager to do as much of the fighting as they would allow. The role also required some juggling and magic tricks. For this, he was mentored by British prestidigitator Harold Taylor, who had previously performed for the British royal family.

Caitlin Clarke was initially hesitant to involve herself in the film, as she was preparing to audition for a play in Chicago. Her agent insisted, though, and after doing an audition tape, was called back for more tests. Clarke failed them but managed to pass after doing another test at Robbins&#x27;s insistence. She got along well with Ralph Richardson and stated that he taught her more in one rehearsal than she had learned in years of acting classes.

=== Set design ===

Elliot Scott was hired to design the sets of the film&#x27;s sixth-century world. He temporarily converted the 13th-century Dolwyddelan Castle into Ulrich&#x27;s ramshackle sixth-century fortress, to the surprise of the locals. He built the entire village of Swanscombe on a farm outside London. Although Scott extensively researched medieval architecture in the British Museum and his own library, he took some artistic liberties in creating the thatched-roof houses, the granary, Simon&#x27;s house and smithy, and Casiodorus&#x27;s castle, because he was unable to find enough information on their exact look. He built the interior of the dragon&#x27;s lair, using of polystyrene and 40 tons of Welsh slate and shale. The shots of the Welsh and Scottish landscapes were extended through the use of over three dozen matte paintings.

Nearly all of the outdoor scenes were shot in North Wales. The final scene was shot in Skye, Scotland.

=== Costumes ===
The costumes were designed by Anthony Mendelson, who consulted the British Museum, the London Library, and his own reference files to evoke the designs of the early Middle Ages. They are roughly stitched and use colors that would have been possible with the vegetable dyes of the time. The costumes of Casiodorus and his court were designed of fine silk, as opposed to the coarsely woven clothes of the Urlanders.

=== Music ===
The film&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated score was composed by Alex North. The score&#x27;s linear conception was developed through transparently layered and polyphonic orchestral texture, dominated by a medieval-style modal harmony. It was largely based on five major thematic concepts:
# The suffering of the Urlanders 
# A &quot;magic&quot; motif 
# The amulet 
# The sacrificial virgins 
# The relationship between Galen and Valerian

North had six weeks to compose the score, which features music rejected from his score for Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. The opening sequence of &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; features a reworking of his original music for the opening of &quot;2001&quot;″s &quot;Dawn of Man&quot; sequence—which in that final film is played without music—and a waltz representing the dragon in flight that had been a variation of the cue &quot;Space Station Docking&quot;, which in the final cut of &quot;2001&quot; was replaced by &quot;The Blue Danube&quot;. North was disappointed by the resulting dragon scenes, as they do not use the entirety of the pieces he composed for them. He later stated that he had written &quot;a very lovely waltz for when the dragon first appears, with just a slight indication that this may not be a bad dragon&quot;. The waltz was replaced by tracks used earlier in the movie.

The score was widely praised. Pauline Kael wrote in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; that the score was a &quot;beauty&quot;, and that &quot;at times, the music and the fiery dragon seem one&quot;. Royal S. Brown of &quot;Fanfare Magazine&quot; praised the soundtrack as &quot;one of the best scores of 1981&quot;.

On April 22, 2010, a limited-edition soundtrack CD was released on La-La Land Records.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film grossed just over $14 million in the US with an estimated budget of $18 million. It later became a cult film.

=== Critical response ===
At the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 84% score based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s critic consensus reads, &quot;An atypically dark Disney adventure, &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; puts a realistic spin — and some impressive special effects — on a familiar tale.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

The book &quot;Flights of Fancy: The Great Fantasy Film&quot; says: &quot;&quot;Dragonslayer&quot; is a compelling and often brilliant fantasy film [... but] it seeks, as well, to impose modern sensibilities on its medieval characters and plot—20th-century political, sociological, and religious sensibilities, which only serve to dilute its particular strengths.&quot;

Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both gave the film three stars out of four in their respective print reviews. Siskel praised the &quot;dazzling special effects&quot; and the &quot;convincing portrait by Ralph Richardson of the aged magician Ulrich&quot;, and Ebert called the scenes involving the dragon &quot;first-rate&quot;.

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Vermithrax &quot;the greatest dragon yet&quot;, and praised the film for its effective evocation of the Dark Ages.

David Denby of &quot;New York&quot; praised &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;″s special effects and lauded the film as being much better than &quot;Excalibur&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.

David Sterritt of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; praised the sets and pacing of the film, but criticized it for lack of originality, stressing that MacNicol and Richardson&#x27;s characters bore too many similarities to the heroes of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. A similar critique was given by John Coleman of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, who called the film a &quot;turgid sword-and-sorcery fable, with Ralph Richardson in a backdated kind of &quot;Star Wars&quot; of Alec Guinness role&quot;.

Tim Pulleine of the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s lack of narrative drive and clarity to supplement the special effects. Upon the film&#x27;s first television broadcast, Gannett News Service columnist Mike Hughes called the story &quot;slight&quot; and &quot;slow-paced&quot;, but admired a &quot;lyrical beauty to the setting and mood&quot;. Nonetheless, he warned: &quot;In movie theaters, that came across wonderfully; on a little TV screen, this may be strictly for specialized tastes.&quot;

Alex Keneas of &quot;Newsday&quot; criticized the focus on superstition, and for being &quot;bereft of any sense of medieval time, place and society&quot;.

Larry DiTillio reviewed &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; for &quot;Different Worlds&quot; magazine and stated, &quot;Much imagination went into the recreation of this world and fans will revel in it when they see it.&quot;

Christopher John reviewed &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; in &quot;Ares&quot; magazine and commented, &quot;Though the dialogue is occasionally stiff, there is a believable reality. When the people and setting of a fantasy are as carefully wrought as they are here, it is easy to get an audience to accept as small and wonderful a thing as a dragon.&quot;

Dirk Libbey of &quot;CinemaBlend&quot; describes that &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; &quot;tends to get overlooked. Even if you do remember it, there&#x27;s a decent chance you had no idea it was technically a Disney movie, as it was a far cry from their normal output in the early &#x27;80s and thus the Disney name was largely left off the film.&quot;

==== Vermithrax Pejorative ====
Guillermo del Toro has stated that along with Maleficent in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, Vermithrax is his favorite cinematic dragon. He further stated that: &quot;One of the best and one of the strongest landmarks [of dragon movies] that almost nobody can overcome is &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;. The design of Vermithrax Pejorative is perhaps one of the most perfect creature designs ever made.&quot;

&quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; author George R. R. Martin once ranked it the fifth-best fantasy film of all time, and called Vermithrax &quot;the best dragon ever put on film [with] the coolest dragon name&quot;. Vermithrax is mentioned as an Easter egg in a list of dragons&#x27; names in the fourth episode of that book series adaptation, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. Fantasy author Alex Bledsoe stated: &quot;...everyone has a &#x27;first dragon&#x27;, the one that awoke their sense of wonder about the creatures. For many it&#x27;s Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s elaborate world of Pern, where genetically engineered intelligent dragons bond with their riders; for others, it&#x27;s Smaug in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, guarding his hoard deep in a cave. But for me, it was the awesome Vermithrax from the 1981 film, &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;.&quot;

During filming of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, in which Ian McDiarmid, who portrays minor character Brother Jacopus in &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, stars as the film&#x27;s main antagonist, Emperor Palpatine, the ILM crew jokingly placed a model of Vermithrax in the arms of the Rancor model and took a picture. The picture was included in the book &quot;Star Wars: Chronicles&quot;. A creature based on the appearance of this dragon appears in one of Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s creature pens in &quot;Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy&quot;.

== Related media ==
A novelization, &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, was written by Wayland Drew, that delves deeper into the background of many of the characters.

Marvel Comics published three formats of &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; adaptations in 1981; all were by the same team. These were a magazine-sized issue, a two-issue standard comic-sized adaptation, and a paperback format (&quot;Marvel Illustrated&quot;) of the two comic books in 160 pages, due to the smaller pages. Credits include writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil, and artists Marie Severin and John Tartaglione, in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; #20.

Simulations Publications, Inc. produced the board game &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, designed by Brad Hessel and Redmond A. Simonsen.

Australian label Southern Cross initially released an unauthorized soundtrack album in 1983 on LP (a boxed audiophile pressing, at 45 rpm), and in 1990 on CD. The first official and improved CD release came in 2010 by U.S. label La-La Land Records. The new album features newly mastered audio from the original LCR (Left-Center-Right) mix, previously unreleased source music, and alternative takes.

<text>George J. Saling (July 27, 1909 – April 15, 1933) was an American track and field athlete, winner of 110 m hurdles at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

Saling was born in Memphis, Missouri, but the family moved to Corydon, Iowa when George was three months old. He graduated from Corydon High School in 1927 and was the captain of the basketball team. At the University of Iowa, Saling established himself as a world class hurdler during his senior year, in 1932, winning the NCAA Championships in 110 m hurdles, equaling the Percy Beard&#x27;s world record of 14.4. At the AAU Championships, Saling lost in 110 m hurdles final to Jack Keller by , but won the 200 m hurdles title, thus earning a place in the Olympic team.

At the Los Angeles Olympic Games, Saling beat his chief rival, Percy Beard, in the semi-final by 0.2 seconds and then again in the final by 0.1 seconds.

That would remain his last victory on the track, because George Saling was killed in a car accident in Missouri six months after the Olympic Games, aged only 23.

<doc id="887404" wikidata="Q135780" url="?curid=887404" title="Z-order">
<text>Z-order is an ordering of overlapping two-dimensional objects, such as windows in a stacking window manager, shapes in a vector graphics editor, or objects in a 3D application. One of the features of a typical GUI is that windows may overlap, so that one window hides part or all of another. When two windows overlap, their Z-order determines which one appears on top of the other.

==Definition==
The term &quot;Z-order&quot; refers to the order of objects along the Z-axis. In coordinate geometry, X typically refers to the horizontal axis (left to right), Y to the vertical axis (up and down), and Z refers to the axis perpendicular to the other two (forward or backward). One can think of the windows in a GUI as a series of planes parallel to the surface of the monitor. The windows are therefore stacked along the Z-axis, and the Z-order information thus specifies the front-to-back ordering of the windows on the screen. An analogy would be some sheets of paper scattered on top of a table, each sheet being a window, the table your computer screen, and the top sheet having the highest Z value.

==Use==
Typically, users of a GUI can affect the Z-order by selecting a window to be brought to the foreground (that is, &quot;above&quot; or &quot;in front of&quot; all the other windows). Some window managers allow interaction with windows while they are not in the foreground, while others will bring a window to the front whenever it receives input from the user. It is also possible for special windows to be designated &quot;always on top&quot;; these are then fixed to the top of the Z-order so that (with few exceptions) no other window can overlap them.

When dealing with visual objects on a computer screen, an object with a Z-order of 1 would be visually &quot;underneath&quot; an object with a Z-order of 2 or greater. This is the same as making &quot;layers&quot; of objects where the Z-order determines what object is on top of another. An HTML page can use CSS to specify the Z-order so that some objects can be layered over others.

Z-ordering is also used in 3D applications to determine object visibility based on overlap from other objects. This confers a speed advantage to the user as the computer does not need to render unseen objects. In practice, of course, some objects may be only partially obscured, and this is a complication that must be taken into account.

In early real-time 3D graphics, Z-order was applied on a per-polygon basis to avoid using Z-buffer, which was considered expensive at the time.
In modern 3D graphics, Z-order is used for order-dependent rendering, for example with semi-transparent objects. It can also be used to reduce the problem of Z-fighting, by either rendering farther objects first and then using weak inequality as the depth test or, conversely, rendering front-to-back and using strict inequality.

==z-index==
The actual number assigned to a particular place in the Z-order is sometimes known as the z-index. In particular the CSS property that sets the stack order of specific elements is known as the z-index. An element with greater stack order is always in front of another element with lower stack order.
p {
 position: relative;
 z-index: -1;


Negative stack orders can also be used in the same manner. A negative value will appear behind a positive one. codice_1 only works on elements that have a position value (e.g. codice_2) and for many coders, this one of the first things to investigate when debugging why the z-index isn&#x27;t working.

Like all other CSS properties, it can be set with JavaScript as well with the following syntax:
object.style.zIndex= &#x27;1&#x27;;

<doc id="887415" wikidata="Q2962210" url="?curid=887415" title="Chello">
<text>Chello was the brand of internet service provider-activities of Liberty Global Europe (formerly UGC), a provider of broadband internet access via cable in Europe, with estimated 1.3 million customers across its markets. LGE operates in 15 European, 4 Latin American and 2 Asian/Pacific countries. The Chello branded internet service were available in seven of these: Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Slovakia. The Chello brand was introduced in the European market in 1998 and was awarded the best Consumer ISP award in 1999 

Features of the Chello service are standardized according to the cable provider. In each market Chello delivered open-access content portals that featured local news and entertainment content. Also, all users of the service were granted email addresses.

Chello products were typically available at many speeds and are named Chello Starter, Chello Easy, Chello Classic, Chello Plus and Chello Extreme.

The Chello brand appears to have been replaced by other brands. For example, in The Netherlands, Chello has been renamed to UPC Live. UPC Live also has replaced Chello in Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. In Sweden, Chello has been replaced by ComHem, and in Norway, by Get. In Ireland, UPC Ireland took over the broadband and cable service NTL in 2005, having previously bought another Irish cable provider - Chorus. In 2015, UPC in Ireland was rebranded as Virgin Media Ireland. In Belgium, Chello was a product of UPC that was absorbed by Telenet in 2006 when Liberty Global bought a majority stake in Telenet.

The brand was available in New Zealand in the early 2000s, under TelstraSaturn&#x27;s cable network.

<doc id="887418" wikidata="Q885836" url="?curid=887418" title="Blue Origin">
<text>Blue Origin Enterprises, L.P. is an American space technology company headquartered in Kent, Washington. The company operates the suborbital New Shepard rocket and the heavy-lift New Glenn rocket. In addition to producing engines for its own rockets, Blue Origin supplies engines for other vehicles, including United Launch Alliance&#x27;s Vulcan Centaur. It is also working on the Blue Moon human lunar lander for NASA&#x27;s Artemis program, the Blue Ring spacecraft platform, and the Orbital Reef space station in partnership with other organizations.

Founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin initially operated with a very low profile, funded by Bezos&#x27;s private investments. In 2015, the company achieved a significant milestone with the first uncrewed launch and landing of the New Shepard and announced plans for New Glenn. In 2021, New Shepard completed its first crewed mission with Bezos himself on board, crossing the Kármán line, the conventional definition of the edge of space, above sea level. Another key achievement came in January 2023 when the company delivered its first BE-4 rocket engine to United Launch Alliance. Despite these milestones, Blue Origin has faced criticism for its perceived slow progress, particularly when compared to SpaceX. Addressing these challenges, the company underwent a leadership change in September 2023, appointing Dave Limp as CEO to succeed Bob Smith.

On January 16, 2025, Blue Origin reached orbit with the first launch of the New Glenn vehicle.

== History ==
The company was founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Rob Meyerson joined the company in 2003 and served as the CEO before leaving the company in 2018. Bob Smith served as CEO from 2018 to 2023. The current CEO is Dave Limp. Little is known about the company&#x27;s activities in its early years. In 2006, the company purchased land for its New Shepard missions 30 miles north of Van Horn, Texas, United States called Launch Site One (LS1). In November 2006, the first test vehicle was launched, the Goddard rocket, which reached an altitude of 285 feet.

After initiating the development of an orbital rocket system prior to 2012, and stating in 2013 on their website that the first stage would perform a powered vertical landing and be reusable, the company publicly announced their orbital launch vehicle intentions in September 2015. In January 2016, the company indicated that the new rocket would be many times larger than New Shepard. The company publicly released the high-level design of the vehicle and announced its name in September 2016 as &quot;New Glenn&quot;. The New Glenn heavy-lift launch vehicle can be configured in both two-stage and three-stage variants. New Glenn first successfully launched in January, 2025.

On July 20, 2021, New Shepard performed its first crewed mission to sub-orbital space called Blue Origin NS-16. The flight lasted approximately 10 minutes and crossed the Kármán line. The passengers were Jeff Bezos, his brother Mark Bezos, Wally Funk, and Oliver Daemen, after the unnamed auction winner (later revealed to have been Justin Sun) dropped out due to a scheduling conflict. Subsequent New Shepard passenger and cargo missions were: Blue Origin NS-17, Blue Origin NS-18, Blue Origin NS-19, Blue Origin NS-20, Blue Origin NS-21 and Blue Origin NS-23.

The company primarily employs an incremental approach from sub-orbital to orbital flight, with each developmental step building on its prior work. The company moved into the orbital spaceflight technology development business in 2014, initially as a rocket engine supplier via a contractual agreement to build the BE-4 rocket engine, for major US launch system operator United Launch Alliance (ULA). United Launch Alliance (ULA) has said that the first flight of its Vulcan Centaur heavy-lift launch vehicle is scheduled to launch in Q4 of 2023. The heavy-lift launch vehicles main power is supported by two BE-4 engines. On June 7, 2023, United Launch Alliance (ULA) performed a Flight Readiness Firing of the Vulcan Centaur rocket at launch pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States. The two BE-4 rocket engines worked as expected.

In 2024, the company won its first National Security Space Launch (NSSL) contract. The New Glenn vehicle is to be used on the launches.

== Launch vehicles ==

=== New Shepard ===

New Shepard is a fully reusable suborbital launch vehicle developed for space tourism. The vehicle is named after Alan Shepard, the first American astronaut in space. The vehicle is capable of vertical takeoff and landings and can carry humans and customer payloads to the edge of space.

The New Shepard is a rocket that consists of a booster rocket and a crew capsule. The capsule can be configured to house up to six passengers, cargo, or a combination of both. The booster rocket is powered by one BE-3PM engine, which sends the capsule to an apogee (Sub-Orbital) of and flies above the Kármán line, where passengers and cargo can experience a few minutes of weightlessness before the capsule returns to Earth.

The launch vehicle is designed to be fully reusable, with the capsule returning to Earth via three parachutes and a solid rocket motor. The booster lands vertically on the same launchpad it took off from. The company has successfully launched and landed the New Shepard launch vehicle 26 times with 1 partial failure (deemed successful) and 1 failure. The launch vehicle has a length of , a diameter of and a launch mass of . The BE-3PM engine produces 490 kN of thrust at takeoff. The New Shepard allows the company to significantly reduce the cost of space tourism.

On the morning of February 25, 2025, Blue Origin launched its 10th space tourism mission and sent six paying passengers to suborbital space. This marked the company&#x27;s tenth human flight, and its 30th overall flight of New Shepard.

=== New Glenn ===

New Glenn is a heavy-lift launch vehicle, first successfully launched in January 2025. The initial launch date had been set back by numerous delays. Named after NASA astronaut John Glenn, design work on the vehicle began in early 2012. Illustrations of the vehicle, and the high-level specifications, were initially publicly unveiled in September 2016. The full vehicle was first unveiled on a launch pad on February 21, 2024. The rocket has a diameter of 7 meters (23 ft), and its first stage is powered by seven BE-4 engines. The fairing is claimed to have twice the payload volume of &quot;any commercial launch system&quot; and to be the biggest payload fairing in the world.

Like the New Shepard, New Glenn&#x27;s first stage is also designed to be reusable. In 2021, the company initiated conceptual design work on approaches to potentially make the second stage reusable as well, with the project codenamed &quot;Project Jarvis&quot;.

NASA announced on February 9, 2023, that it had selected the New Glenn heavy-lift launch vehicle for the launch of two Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) spacecraft. The New Glenn heavy-lift launch vehicle will launch ESCAPADE in Q2 of 2025 with the ESCAPADE spacecraft entering Mars&#x27;s orbit approximately one year after launch.

In 2024, Blue Origin received funding from the USSF to assess New Glenn&#x27;s ability to launch national security payloads. On January 16, 2025, Blue Origin achieved its first successful launch of New Glenn from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station&#x27;s Launch Complex 36 at 02:03 Eastern Time The mission&#x27;s primary objective was to deploy the Blue Ring Pathfinder test satellite, which was successfully placed into orbit.

== Blue Moon ==

In May 2019, Bezos unveiled plans for a crew-capable lunar lander named Blue Moon. The lander is designed to transport up to to the lunar surface in its standard configuration, while a stretched-tank variant can carry up to . Both versions are engineered for soft landings on the Moon.

In 2020, Blue Origin, in collaboration with Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Draper, submitted the Blue Moon lunar lander proposal for NASA&#x27;s Artemis program. After NASA awarded the human landing system (HLS) contract to SpaceX in 2021 for its Starship HLS, Blue Origin contested the decision. This challenge ultimately led to NASA awarding a separate contract for Blue Moon in 2023.

The lander is powered by the BE-7 hydrolox engine. On May 19, 2023, NASA contracted Blue Origin to develop, test, and deploy the Blue Moon landing system for the Artemis V mission. This mission will support lunar exploration and lay the groundwork for future crewed missions to Mars. The $3.4 billion contract includes an uncrewed test mission followed by a crewed Moon landing planned for 2029.

In mid-2024, Blue Origin announced the successful completion of initial acceptance testing on the thrusters for the MK1 variant of the Blue Moon lander.

== Rocket engines ==
=== BE-1 ===
Blue Origin&#x27;s first engine is a &quot;simple, single-propellant engine&quot; called the Blue Engine-1 (BE-1) which uses peroxide propellant and generates of thrust.

=== BE-2 ===
The Blue Engine-2 (BE-2) which is a bipropellant engine using kerosene and peroxide, produces of thrust.

=== BE-3 (BE-3U and BE-3PM) ===

The BE-3 is a family of rocket engines made by Blue Origin with two variants, the BE-3U and BE-3PM. The rocket engine is a liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen (LH2/LOX) cryogenic engine that can produce and 710 kN (160,000 lbf) of thrust, respectively. Early thrust chamber testing began at NASA Stennis in 2013. By late 2013, the BE-3 had been successfully tested on a full-duration sub-orbital burn, with simulated coast phases and engine relights, &quot;demonstrating deep throttle, full power, long-duration and reliable restart all in a single-test sequence.&quot; NASA has released a video of the test. , the engine had demonstrated more than 160 starts and of operation at the company&#x27;s test facility near Van Horn, Texas.

# The BE-3U is an open expander cycle variant of the BE-3. Two of these engines will be used to power the New Glenn heavy-lift launch vehicle&#x27;s second stage. The amount of thrust the BE-3U produces is 710 kilonewtons (160,000 lbf).
# The BE-3PM uses a pump-fed engine design, with a combustion tap-off cycle to take a small amount of combustion gases from the main combustion chamber to power the engine&#x27;s turbopumps. One engine is used to power the Propulsive Module (PM) of New Shepard. The amount of thrust the BE-3PM produces is 490 kilonewtons (110,000 lbf). The rocket engine can be throttled to as low as 110 kN (25,000 lbf) for use in controlled vertical landings.

=== BE-4 ===

The BE-4 is a liquid oxygen/liquified natural gas (LOX/LNG) rocket engine that can produce of thrust.

In late 2014, the company signed an agreement with United Launch Alliance (ULA) to develop the BE-4 engine, for ULA&#x27;s upgraded Atlas V and Vulcan Centaur rockets replacing the RD-180 Russian-made rocket engine. The newly developed heavy-lift launch vehicle will use two of the BE-4 engines on each first stage. The engine development program for the BE-4 began in 2011.

On October 31, 2022, a Twitter post by the official Blue Origin account announced that the first two BE-4 engines had been delivered to ULA and were being integrated on a Vulcan rocket. In a later tweet, ULA CEO Tory Bruno said that one of the engines had already been installed on the booster, and that the other would be joining it momentarily. On June 7, 2023, the two BE-4 rocket engines performed as expected when ULA performed a Flight Readiness Firing of the Vulcan Rocket at launch pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Vulcan Centaur launched for the first time on January 8, 2024, successfully carrying Astrobotic Technology&#x27;s &quot;Peregrine&quot; lunar lander, the first mission on NASA&#x27;s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program using the BE-4 engine.

=== BE-7 ===

The BE-7 engine is a liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen dual expander cycle engine currently under development, designed for use on Blue Moon. The engine produces of thrust. Its first ignition tests were performed in June 2019, with thrust chamber assembly testing continuing through 2023.

=== Pusher escape motor ===
The company partnered with Aerojet Rocketdyne to develop a pusher launch escape system for the New Shepard suborbital crew capsule. Aerojet Rocketdyne provides the Crew Capsule Escape Solid Rocket Motor (CCE SRM) while the thrust vector control system that steers the capsule during an abort is designed and manufactured by Blue Origin.

== Facilities ==

The company has facilities across the US which include five main locations and five field offices:
* Kent, Washington (headquarters)
* Van Horn, Texas
* Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida
* Huntsville, Alabama
* Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama
* Arlington, Virginia
* Denver, Colorado
* Los Angeles, California
* Phoenix, Arizona
* Washington, DC

The company’s headquarters is in Kent, Washington. Rocket development takes place at its headquarters. The company has continued to expand its Seattle-area offices and rocket production facilities since 2016, purchasing an adjacent -building. In 2017, the company filed permits to build a new warehouse complex and an additional of office space. The company established a new headquarters and R&amp;D facility, called the O&#x27;Neill Building on June 6, 2020.

=== Launch Site One (LSO) ===

Corn Ranch, commonly referred to as Launch Site One (LSO) is the company&#x27;s launch site north of Van Horn, Texas.

The site hosts the company&#x27;s sub-orbital launch pad for its New Shepard rocket along with a landing pad. Additionally, LSO has a number of rocket engine test stands and engine test cells are to support the hydrolox, methalox and storable propellant engines. There are three test cells for the BE-3 and BE-4 engines. The test cells support full-thrust and full-duration burns, and one supports short-duration, high-pressure preburner tests.

=== Blue Engine ===
Engine production is located in Huntsville, Alabama, at a facility called, &quot;Blue Engine&quot;. The companies website states that, &quot;The world-class engine manufacturing facility in The Rocket City conduct[s] high rate production of the BE-4 and BE-3U engines.

The company is planning a third major expansion in Huntsville and the company purchased adjacent to its already sprawling campus at the price of $1.427 million.

=== Orbital Launch Site (OLS) ===
The Orbital Launch Site (OLS) at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, develops rockets and conducts extensive testing. The company converted Launch Complex 36 (LC-36) to launch New Glenn into orbit at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The facility was initially completed in 2020 and is being used for the construction of New Glenn prototypes, rocket testing, and designs.

The company facility is situated on of land assembled from the former Launch complexes 11, 12, 36A and 36B. The land parcel used to build a rocket engine test stand for the BE-4 engine, a launch mount, called the Orbital Launch Site, (hence its name) and a reusable booster refurbishment facility for the New Glenn launch vehicle, which is expected to land on a drone ship and return to Port Canaveral for refurbishment. Manufacturing of &quot;large elements, such as New Glenn&#x27;s first and second stages as well as the payload fairings and other large components will be made nearby in Exploration Park, which is near the entrance to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex on Merritt Island, Florida.

In addition to their Florida operations, they have also been leased the greenfield of Space Launch Complex 9 (SLC-9) at Vandenberg Space Force Base, where they plan to construct a New Glenn launch pad to give the launch vehicle polar orbit and Sun-synchronous orbit capabilities.

== Other projects ==
=== Blue Ring (Space Truck Vehicle) ===
The Blue Ring vehicle was announced in October 2023 by Blue Origin. It will have its own engine and is meant to handle orbital logistics and delivery. In March 2024, in partnership with the United States Space Force, it was announced that the Blue Ring’s capabilities will be tested soon on a mission called DarkSky-1.

=== Orbital Reef (commercial space station) ===

The company and its partners Sierra Space, Boeing, Redwire Space and Genesis Engineering Solutions won a $130million award to jump-start the design of their Orbital Reef commercial space station. The project is envisioned as an expandable business park, with Boeing&#x27;s Starliner and Sierra Space&#x27;s Dream Chaser transporting passengers to and from low Earth orbit (LEO) for tourism, research and in-space manufacturing projects.

Orbital Reef’s design will be modular in nature, to provide the greatest amount of customization and compatibility. It will reportedly be designed to accept docking from almost every spacecraft in operation, such as SpaceX Dragon 2, Soyuz (spacecraft), Dream Chaser, and Boeing Starliner. The initial modules will be: Life, Node, Core, and Research Modules.

In 2024 NASA increased funding for Orbital Reef by $42 million, bringing the total award to $172 million.

=== Nuclear rocket program ===

NASA plans to test spacecraft, engines and other propellent systems powered by nuclear fission no later than 2027 as part of the agency&#x27;s effort to demonstrate more efficient methods of traveling through outer space for space exploration. One benefit to using nuclear fission as a propellent for spacecraft is that nuclear-based systems can have less mass than solar cells which means a spacecraft could be smaller while using the same amount of energy more efficiently. Nuclear fission concepts that can power both life support and propulsion systems could greatly reduce the cost and flight time during space exploration.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency awarded General Atomics, Lockheed Martin and Blue Origin contracts to fund and build nuclear spacecraft under the agency&#x27;s Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations program or DRACO program. The company was awarded $2.9 million to develop spacecraft component designs.

In partnership with Blue Origin, Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, GE Research, Framatome and Materion, USNC-Tech won a $5 million contract from NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to develop a long range nuclear propulsion system called the Power Adjusted Demonstration Mars Engine, or PADME.

=== Space technology ===
NASA awarded $35 million to the company in 2023 for the company&#x27;s work on lunar regolith to be used for solar powered systems on the moon. The company&#x27;s website states that &quot;Blue Alchemist is a proposed end-to-end, scalable, autonomous, and commercial solution that produces solar cells from lunar regolith, which is the dust and crushed rock abundant on the surface of the Moon. Based on a process called molten regolith electrolysis, the breakthrough would bootstrap unlimited electricity and power transmission cables anywhere on the surface of the Moon. This process also produces oxygen as a useful byproduct for propulsion and life support.&quot;

Gary Lai, chief architect of the New Shepard rocket said during the pathfinder awards at the Seattle Museum of Flight that [The company] &quot;aims to be the first company that harvests natural resources from the Moon to use here on Earth&quot;. He also mentioned that the company is building a novel approach to extract outer space&#x27;s vast resources.

== Blue Origin flights (before 2025)==
In 2025, Blue Origin achieved orbital spaceflight with the maiden launch of New Glenn. Below is a list of all Blue Origin flights before 2025. For list of flights performed after 1 January 2025 see the articles of New Glenn and New Shepard where they are listed.

In the chart below, ♺ means &quot;Flight Proven Booster&quot;.

== NASA partnerships and funding ==
The company has contracted to do work for NASA on several development efforts. The company was awarded $3.7 million in funding by NASA in 2009 via a Space Act Agreement under the first Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program for development of concepts and technologies to support future human spaceflight operations. NASA co-funded risk-mitigation activities related to ground testing of (1) an innovative &#x27;pusher&#x27; escape system, that lowers cost by being reusable and enhances safety by avoiding the jettison event of a traditional &#x27;tractor&#x27; Launch Escape System, and (2) an innovative composite pressure vessel cabin that both reduces weight and increases safety of astronauts. This was later revealed to be a part of a larger system, designed for a bionic capsule, that would be launched atop an Atlas V rocket. On November 8, 2010, it was announced that the company had completed all milestones under its CCDev Space Act Agreement.

In April 2011, The company received a commitment from NASA for $22 million of funding under the CCDev phase 2 program. Milestones included (1) performing a Mission Concept Review (MCR) and System Requirements Review (SRR) on the orbital Space Vehicle, which utilizes a bionic shape to optimize its launch profile and atmospheric reentry, (2) further maturing the pusher escape system, including ground and flight tests, and (3) accelerating development of its BE-3 LOX/LH2 engine through full-scale thrust chamber testing.

In 2012, NASA&#x27;s Commercial Crew Program released its follow-on CCiCap solicitation for the development of crew delivery to ISS by 2017. The company did not submit a proposal for CCiCap, but reportedly continued work on its development program with private funding. The company had a failed attempt to lease a different part of the Space Coast, when they submitted a bid in 2013 to lease Launch Complex 39A (LC39A) at the Kennedy Space Center – on land to the north of, and adjacent to, Cape Canaveral AFS – following NASA&#x27;s decision to lease the unused complex out as part of a bid to reduce annual operation and maintenance costs. The companies bid was for shared and non-exclusive use of the LC39A complex such that the launchpad was to have been able to interface with multiple vehicles, and costs for using the launch pad were to have been shared across multiple companies over the term of the lease. One potential shared user in the companies proposed plan was United Launch Alliance (ULA). Commercial use of the LC39A launch complex was awarded to SpaceX, which submitted a bid for exclusive use of the launch complex to support their crewed missions.

The company completed work for NASA on several small development contracts, receiving total funding of $25.7 million by 2013. In September 2013 – before completion of the bid period, and before any public announcement by NASA of the results of the process – Florida Today reported that the company had filed a protest with the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) &quot;over what it says is a plan by NASA to award an exclusive commercial lease to SpaceX for use of mothballed space shuttle launch pad 39A&quot;. NASA had originally planned to complete the bid award and have the pad transferred by October 1, 2013, but the protest delayed a decision until the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) reached a decision on the protest. SpaceX said that they would be willing to support a multi-user arrangement for pad 39A. In December 2013, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) denied the companies protest and sided with NASA, which argued that the solicitation contained no preference on the use of the facility as either multi-use or single-use. &quot;The [solicitation] document merely [asked] bidders to explain their reasons for selecting one approach instead of the other and how they would manage the facility&quot;. NASA selected the SpaceX proposal in late 2013 and signed a 20-year lease contract for Launch Pad 39A to SpaceX in April 2014.

The company placed their first bid via the NASA Sustaining Lunar Development (SLD) competition to fund and develop a lunar lander capable of transporting astronauts to and from the lunar surface. The Blue Origin led team called the &quot;National Team&quot; included, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Draper. On April 30, 2020, the company and its partners won a $579 million contract to start developing and testing an integrated Human Landing System (HLS) for the Artemis program to return humans to the Moon. However, the Blue Origin led team lost their first bid to work for NASA&#x27;s Artemis program and on April 16, 2021, NASA officially selected the Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) to develop, test and build their version of the Human Landing System (HLS) for Artemis missions 2 (II), 3 (III) and 4 (IV).

In early 2021, the company received over $275 million from NASA for lunar lander projects and sub-orbital research flights.

The company then announced on December 6, 2022, that it had submitted a second bid via the NASA Sustaining Lunar Development (SLD) competition to fund and develop a second lunar lander capable for transporting astronauts to and from the lunar surface. The announcement fell within NASA&#x27;s deadline for Sustaining Lunar Development (SLD) proposals. As with their first bid, the company is leading another team called the &quot;National Team&quot; which includes Draper, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Astrobotic, Honeybee Robotics and Blue Origin.

On May 19, 2023 NASA contracted the company to develop, test and deploy its Blue Moon landing system for the agency&#x27;s Artemis V mission, which explores the Moon and prepares future crewed missions to Mars. The project includes an uncrewed test mission followed by a crewed Moon landing in 2029. The contract value is $3.4 billion.

== Internal and additional U.S Government funding ==
By July 2014, Jeff Bezos had invested over $500million into the company. and the vast majority of further funding into 2016 was to support technology development and operations where a majority of funding came from Jeff Bezos&#x27; private investment fund. In April 2017, an annual amount was published showing that Jeff Bezos was selling approximately $1billion in Amazon stock per year to invest in the company. Jeff Bezos has been criticized for spending excessive amounts of his fortune on spaceflight.

The company received $181 million from the United States Air Force for launch vehicle development in 2019. The company was also eligible to benefit from further grants totaling $500M as part of the U.S. Space Force Launch Services Agreement competition. On November 18, 2022, the U.S. Space Systems Command announced that an agreement with the company that &quot;paves the way&quot; for the company&#x27;s New Glenn rocket to compete for national security launch contracts once it completes its required flight certifications for Top Secret military payloads.

In an interview with Bob Smith by the financial Times in 2023, Smith said that the company had &quot;hundreds of millions in revenue as well as billions of dollars in orders&quot;.

The company is part of the DARPA Lunar Programs, specifically Luna10, an architecture study for lunar surface operations.

== Early test vehicles ==

=== Charon ===

The company&#x27;s first flight test vehicle, called &quot;Charon&quot; after Pluto&#x27;s moon, was powered by four vertically mounted Rolls-Royce Viper Mk. 301 jet engines rather than rockets. The low-altitude vehicle was developed to test autonomous guidance and control technologies, and the processes that the company would use to develop its later rockets. &quot;Charon&quot; made its only test flight at Moses Lake, Washington on March 5, 2005. It flew to an altitude of before returning for a controlled landing near the liftoff point. As of 2016, Charon is on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.

=== Goddard ===
The next test vehicle, named &quot;Goddard&quot; (also known as PM1), first flew on November 13, 2006. The flight was successful. A test flight for December 2 never launched. According to Federal Aviation Administration records, two further flights were performed by Goddard. Blue Engine 1, or BE-1, was the first rocket engine developed by the company and was used in the company&#x27;s Goddard development vehicle.

=== PM2 ===
Another early suborbital test vehicle, PM2, had two flight tests in 2011 in west Texas. The vehicle designation may be short for &quot;Propulsion Module&quot;. The first flight was a short hop (low altitude, VTVL takeoff and landing mission) flown on May 6, 2011. The second flight, August 24, 2011, failed when ground personnel lost contact and control of the vehicle. The company released its analysis of the failure nine days later. As the vehicle reached a speed of Mach 1.2 and altitude, a &quot;flight instability drove an angle of attack that triggered [the] range safety system to terminate thrust on the vehicle&quot;. The vehicle was lost. Blue Engine 2, or BE-2, was a pump-fed bipropellant engine burning kerosene and peroxide which produced of thrust. Five BE-2 engines powered the company&#x27;s PM-2 development vehicle on two test flights in 2011.

<text>WinRAR is a trialware file archiver utility, developed by Eugene Roshal of win.rar GmbH. It can create and view archives in RAR or ZIP file formats, and unpack numerous archive file formats. To enable the user to test the integrity of archives, WinRAR embeds CRC32 or BLAKE2 checksums for each file in each archive. WinRAR supports creating encrypted, multi-part and self-extracting archives. WinRAR is a Windows-only program. An Android application called &quot;RAR for Android&quot; is also available. Related programs include the command-line utilities &quot;RAR&quot; and &quot;UNRAR&quot; and versions for macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, WinCE, and MS-DOS.

==Evolution==
RAR/DOS started as a mix of x86 assembler and C, with the amount of assembly code decreasing over time and moving to pure C/C++ later on. The first versions of WinRAR were written in C, modern versions are using C++. RAR for Android is written as a mixture of Java and C++.

WinRAR and the RAR file format have evolved over time. Support for the archive format RAR5, using the same RAR file extension as earlier versions, was added in version 5.0; the older RAR file format has since been referred to as RAR4. WinRAR versions before 5.0 do not support RAR5 archives; only older versions of WinRAR run on older operating systems, and cannot open RAR5 archives.

The RAR5 file format - from version 7 on, referred to as &quot;RAR&quot; - increased the maximum dictionary size up to 64 GB, depending on the amount of available memory, with the default in version 5 increased from 4 MB to 32 MB, typically improving compression ratio.
For dictionaries larger than 4 GB, the size can be specified if it is unequal to a power of 2. Thus, there are no restrictions to the range 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, allowing 5 GB or 22 GB to be chosen at will. Archives with dictionaries larger than 4 GB can only be extracted by WinRAR 7.0 or newer.
AES encryption, when used, is in CBC mode and was increased in strength from 128- to 256-bit. Maximum path length for files in RAR and ZIP archives is increased from 2047 to 65535 characters.

Options added in v5.0 include 256-bit BLAKE2 file-hashing algorithm instead of default 32-bit CRC32, duplicate file detection, NTFS hard and symbolic links, and Quick Open record to allow large archives to be opened faster.

The RAR5 file format removed comments for each file (though archive comment still remains), authenticity verification, and specialized compression algorithms for text and multimedia files. RAR5 also changed the file name for split volumes from &quot;archivename.rNN&quot; to &quot;archivename.partNN.rar&quot;.

The RAR7 file format added support for 64GB compression dictionary and improved compression ratio by adding two extra algorithms. RAR7 archives with dictionary sizes up to 4GB can be unpacked by previous versions of WinRAR (5.0 and above) given there&#x27;s enough RAM.

==Features==
* Creation of packed RAR or ZIP archives.
* Unpacking of ARJ, BZIP2, CAB, GZ, ISO, JAR, LHA, RAR, TAR, UUE, XZ, Z, ZIP, ZIPX, ZST, 7z, UUE 001 (split) archives, as well as EXE files containing these archive formats
* Checksum (integrity) verification for ARJ, BZIP2, CAB, GZ, BZIP2, RAR, XZ, ZIP and 7z archives
* Multithreaded CPU compression and decompression

When creating RAR 7.0 archives:
* Support for maximum file size of 16 EiB, about 1.8 × 1019 bytes or 18 million TB
* Compression dictionary from 1 MiB to 64 GiB (it is limited to 256 MiB on 32-bit editions, although 32-bit editions still can decompress archives with 1 GiB dictionary; default size is 32 MiB)
* Optional 256-bit BLAKE2 file hashing that can replace the default 32-bit CRC32 file checksum
* Optional encryption using AES with a 256-bit key in CBC mode, using key derivation function based on PBKDF2 using HMAC-SHA256
* Optional data redundancy is provided in the form of Reed–Solomon &quot;recovery records&quot; and &quot;recovery volumes&quot;, allowing reconstruction of damaged archives (including reconstruction of entirely missed volumes)
* Optional &quot;quick open record&quot; to open RAR files faster
* Ability to create multi-volume (split) archives
* Ability to create self-extracting files (multi-volume self-extracting archives are supported; the self-extractor can execute commands, such as running a specified program before or after self-extraction)
* Support for NTFS permissions, hard and symbolic links
* Support for maximum path length up to 65,535 characters (stored in the UTF-8 format)
* Optional archive comment (stored in the UTF-8 format)
* Optional file timestamps preservation: modification, creation, last access times with high precision
* Optional file deduplication
* Advanced backup options, time-stamped files and previous file version retention.

==License==
The software is distributed as &quot;try before you buy&quot;; it may be used without charge for 40 days. When the period expires, the non-enterprise functionalities remain available, a move intended to discourage piracy. In China, a free-to-use personal edition has been provided officially since 2015.

Although archiving with the RAR format is proprietary, RARLAB supplies as copyrighted freeware the C++ source code of the current UnRAR unpacker, with a license allowing it to be used in any software, thus enabling others to produce software capable of unpacking, but not creating, RAR archives.

RAR for Android is free of charge. It displays advertisements; for a payment they can be disabled. A license for WinRAR does not provide ad-suppression for RAR for Android.

==Security==
In February 2019, a major security vulnerability in the unacev2.dll library which is used by WinRAR to decompress ACE archives was discovered. Consequently, WinRAR dropped the support for the ACE format from version 5.70.

Self-extracting archives created with versions before 5.31 (including the executable installer of WinRAR itself) are vulnerable to DLL hijacking: they may load and use DLLs named UXTheme.dll, RichEd32.dll and RichEd20.dll if they are in the same folder as the executable file.

It was widely reported that WinRAR v5.21 and earlier had a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability which could allow a remote attacker to insert malicious code into a self-extracting executable (SFX) file being created by a user, &quot;putting over 500 million users of the software at risk&quot;. However, examination of the claim revealed that, while the vulnerability existed, the result was merely an SFX which delivered its payload when executed; published responses dismissed the threat, one saying &quot;If you can find suckers who will trust a .exe labelled as self-extracting archive ... then you can trick them into running your smuggled JavaScript&quot;.

WinRAR 6.23 fixes a critical security vulnerability which allowed the hacker to automatically execute malware distributed in archives under some circumstances.

==History==

===Versions===
* Command line RAR and UNRAR were first released in autumn 1993.
* Early development version WinRAR 1.54b was released in 1995.
* 3.00 (2002–05): the new RAR3 archive format is implemented. The new archives cannot be managed by older versions of WinRAR. Solid compression and WAV audio lossless compression features are added.
* 3.41 (2004–12): adds support for Linux .Z archives like GZIP and BZIP2. New options include storing entire file paths and restoring compressed NTFS files.
* 3.50 (2005–08): adds support for interface skins.
* 3.60 (2006–08): adds multithreaded version of the compression algorithm, which improves compression speed on systems with multiple dual-core or hyper-threading-enabled CPUs.
* 3.80 (2008–09): adds support for ZIP archives, which contain Unicode file names in UTF-8.
* 3.90 (2009-05): adds support for the x86-64 architecture. Multithreaded support is enhanced.
* 3.91 is the last release that supports Valencian.
* 3.92 is the last release that supports Serbian Cyrillic and Serbian Latin.
* 4.00 (2011-03): decompression is sped up by up to 30%.
* 4.10 (2012-01): removes all ZIP limitations now allowing unlimited number of files and archive size. WinRAR now also allows creation of multivolume ZIP files. ZIP archives now include Unicode file names.
* 4.20 (2012-06): compression speed in SMP mode is increased significantly, but this improvement was made at the expense of increased memory usage. ZIP compression now uses SMP as well. The default SMP mode cannot handle text; text compression is significantly worse unless additional switches are used.
* 5.00 (2013-09): the RAR5 archive format is implemented. RAR5 compressed archives cannot be managed by old versions of WinRAR. The RAR 5 format improves multi-core processor utilization, and adds a larger dictionary size of up to 1 GiB with 64-bit WinRAR. Special optional compression algorithms optimized for RGB bitmaps, raw audio files, Itanium executables, and plain text, which were supported by earlier versions, are supported only in the older RAR format, not RAR5. Optional optimized compression of x86 executables and delta compression (for structured table data) are supported in both file formats.
* 5.50 (2017-08): adds support for a master password which can be used to encrypt passwords stored in WinRAR. The default RAR format is changed to version 5. Adds support for decompressing Lzip archives; adds support for high precision file dates, longer file names and larger file sizes for TAR archives.
* 5.60 (2018-06): repairing of protected RAR5 archives was improved. Automatic detection of the encoding of ZIP archive comments. Recognition of GZIP files with arbitrary preceding data as an actual GZIP archive.
* 5.70 (2019-02): removes support for ACE archive decompression due to major security vulnerabilities in the unacev2.dll library.
* 6.00 (2020-12): &quot;Ignore&quot; and &quot;Ignore All&quot; options are added to read error prompt. &quot;Ignore&quot; allows to continue processing with already read file part only and &quot;Ignore All&quot; does it for all future read errors.
* 6.10 (2022-01): Added support for unpacking ZST archives. Maximum recovery record is increased to 1000% of protected data size.
* 6.11 (2022-03): Support of Gzip archives with large archive comments has been added; In command line mode, the switch -mes can also be used to suppress the password prompt and abort when adding new files to an encrypted solid archive.
* 6.12 (2022-05): security vulnerability is fixed in Unix RAR versions. WinRAR and Android RAR are not affected.
* 6.23 (2023-08): and critical security vulnerabilities are fixed in WinRAR. Unix and Android versions are not affected.
* 6.24 (2023-10): Fixes an issue with null pointers.
* 7.00 (2024-02): drops support for creating RAR 4.x format archives. Maximum path length limit increased to 65535 characters. Maximum RAR dictionary size up to 64 GB for the 64-bit version (limited by available RAM). Command line RAR filters out control character 27 from screen output for security reasons.
* 7.10 (2025-02): drops support for 32bit Windows editions. Adds support for Large Memory Pages which increases compression and decompression speed specially when using a large compression dictionary. Adds dark mode.

===Operating systems support===
More recent versions do not support many older operating systems. Versions supporting older operating systems may still be available, but not maintained:
* RAR 2.50 is the last version to support MS-DOS and OS/2 on 16-bit x86 CPUs (8086-compatible).
* RAR 3.93 is the last version to support MS-DOS and OS/2 on IA-32 CPUs (80386 equivalents and later). RAR for Pocket PC 3.93 is the last version for Windows Mobile. It supports file names longer than the MS-DOS standard of 8.3 characters, in a MS-DOS box (except under NT-based operating systems), and uses the RSX DPMI extender.
* WinRAR 2.06 is the last version to support Windows 3.1, Windows NT 3.1, Windows NT 3.5, Windows NT 3.51 and Win32s.

<text>8128 is the integer following 8127 and preceding 8129.

It is most notable for being a perfect number (its proper divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 127, 254, 508, 1016, 2032, and 4064 add up to 8128), and one of the earliest numbers to be recognized as such. As a perfect number, it is tied to the Mersenne prime 127, 27 – 1, with 26 (27 – 1) yielding 8128. Also related to its being a perfect number, 8128 is a harmonic divisor number.

Another consequence of 8128 being a perfect number is that it has the same prime factors as the sum of its divisors, its cototient is a power of two, and it is a harmonic seed number (though there are deficient and abundant numbers that share these properties).

8128 is the 127th triangular number, the 64th hexagonal number, a happy number, the eighth 292-gonal number, and the fourth 1356-gonal number, as well as the 43rd centered nonagonal number.

<text>Aramis Nin Ramírez (; born June 25, 1978) is a Dominican former professional baseball third baseman, who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs, and Milwaukee Brewers. He was named an All-Star three times during his career.

He started his professional career with the Pirates in 1998, before being traded to the Chicago Cubs in 2003. On November 12, 2006, Ramírez signed a five-year deal with the Cubs. On December 12, 2011, he signed a three-year contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. On July 23, 2015, he was traded back to Pittsburgh exactly 12 years after they first traded him, where he would finish the remainder of his final season.

==Professional career==

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
On November 7, 1994, Ramírez signed a contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates. On May 26, 1998, he made his major league debut with the Pirates, becoming the youngest player in MLB at that time.

Ramírez struggled in his first three seasons, splitting playing time between the Pirates and Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Playing with the Pirates for an entire season for the first time in 2001, Ramírez hit .300 with 34 home runs. In 2002, his batting performance dipped to .234 with 18 home runs.

===Chicago Cubs===

====2003 season====
Ramírez was traded to the Chicago Cubs on July 23, 2003 with outfielder Kenny Lofton for José Hernández, Matt Bruback and a player to be named later (The Cubs sent Bobby Hill on August 15, 2003 to complete the trade). Ramírez finished the 2003 season strong in Chicago, though he led the majors with 33 errors at third base. He had the lowest fielding percentage of all Major League third basemen with .929. The Cubs made the playoffs and defeated the Atlanta Braves before being beaten by the eventual World Series champions Florida Marlins in the seven-game 2003 National League Championship Series. During the first inning of Game 4 of the NLCS, Ramírez hit the first playoff grand slam in Cubs history off Marlins starter Dontrelle Willis. Ramírez finished the series with three home runs, seven RBIs, and one triple.

====2004 season====
On September 16, 2004, Ramírez became the 14th player in Major League history to have two different games with three home runs in a season. On defense, his range factor of 2.26 was the lowest among all Major League third basemen.

====2005 season====
In 2005, he was elected to play in his first All-Star Game. Ramírez finished the season on the disabled list, after straining his quadriceps femoral muscle on August 24. He finished the season with 31 home runs and 92 RBIs.

====2006 season====
In , Ramírez hit 38 home runs and 119 RBIs. He collected his 1,000th hit on July 15 versus the New York Mets. On defense, his range factor of 2.41 was the lowest among Major League third basemen for the third straight year. After the season, he was listed as being potentially the biggest free agent in the market. Ramírez elected to stay with the Cubs, agreeing to a five-year, $73 million contract on November 12, 2006.

====2007 season====

Ramírez hit his 200th career home run, off Claudio Vargas, on April 23, 2007. On June 29, 2007, Ramírez had one of the best games of his career, in which he went 3-for-5, highlighted by ending a crucial game against the Milwaukee Brewers with a two-out, two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning off pitcher, Francisco Cordero to cap a five-run comeback win. Many Cub fans saw this game as the best comeback win of the season, which also sparked a new rivalry with the Brewers.

The Cubs won the 2007 National League Central division. Ramírez finished the season with 101 RBIs, which led the team. He finished second on the Cubs in home runs (26) and batting average (.310). The divisional title came only after battling it out with Milwaukee for the final month of September. Ramírez made strides to improve his defensive game in 2007, as he lowered his error total and improved his range factor for the third consecutive year. Aramis Ramírez hit the longest home run of the season on 9/21/07, at 495 feet.

====2008 season====
On June 20, in the bottom of the ninth inning, during the first game of the 2008 Crosstown Classic against the Chicago White Sox, Ramírez hit his 2nd home run of the day for a walk off. He went on to homer in each of the next two games in that series.

On July 7, Ramírez was selected to play in the All-Star Game as a reserve. Prior to Game 4 of the World Series, Ramírez was awarded the Hank Aaron Award as the most outstanding offensive performer in the National League. Ramírez finished the season with the lowest range factor (2.16) of all major league third basemen.

====2009 season====
Ramírez got off to a quick start in 2009 with five RBIs during the Cubs&#x27; opening series against the Houston Astros. His first-inning homer in the season opener off Roy Oswalt was the 250th of his career. On April 18 against the St. Louis Cardinals, he hit a walk-off home run in the 11th inning.

On May 8, Ramírez dislocated his left shoulder while fielding a ground ball in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers.

====2010 season====
Ramirez began the season fairly slowly, batting .168 with five home runs and 22 RBIs through his first 47 games before landing on the 15-day disabled list on June 9 with a bruised thumb. Infielder Chad Tracy was recalled from the Iowa Cubs to replace Ramirez.

Ramirez returned to the starting lineup on June 25 in Chicago against the White Sox. On defense, in 2010 he had the lowest fielding percentage among major league third baseman, at .939.

====2011 season====
Ramirez activated his $14 million option on November 3, 2010 to stay with the Cubs for the 2011 season.

On June 27, 2011, Ramirez and teammate Carlos Peña homered twice in a 7–3 win over the Colorado Rockies. Ramirez and Pena both hit a two-run home run and a solo home run each.

On July 1, 2011, Ramírez hit his 300th career home run against the Chicago White Sox.

On July 10, 2011, Aramis Ramírez was asked by National League manager Bruce Bochy to replace Plácido Polanco in the All-Star Game, but Ramirez declined the invitation due to previous plans to be with his family during the break.

On October 30, 2011, Ramirez declined his portion of the $16 million option on his contract and chose to become a free agent.

On November 2, 2011, Ramirez was awarded the Louisville Slugger Silver Slugger Award for best offensive NL third baseman. In his ninth season as a Cub, Ramirez batted .306 with 35 doubles, 26 home runs and a team-high 93 RBIs. He also led the team in slugging percentage and on-base percentage.

===Milwaukee Brewers===

On December 12, 2011, Ramirez signed a three-year deal worth $36 million with the Milwaukee Brewers.

====2012 season====
Ramirez continued his success in Milwaukee. He had a slow start to 2012, batting as low as .218 in mid-May. However, Ramirez was able to rebound to have a very solid offensive season with the Brewers, finishing the season with a .300 batting average, with 27 home runs, 105 RBIs, as well as a league-leading 50 doubles.

Ramirez was a top-five finalist for the NL Gold Glove Award in his first season as a Brewer, dramatically improving his fielding abilities and becoming one of the best infield defenders in baseball. He also finished ninth overall in MVP voting, the highest of his career.

====2013 season====

Ramirez&#x27;s 2013 campaign was constantly interrupted by injury. During the preseason, Ramirez sprained his left knee sliding into second base during an exhibition game at Maryvale Baseball Park in Phoenix where the Milwaukee Brewers play their spring training games. He recovered in time to play on Opening Day, but re-aggravated the injury on a similar slide into second base during the fourth game of the season and was forced to miss 30 days on the Disabled List. Ramirez returned to play in May and June, but was hampered by the knee injury causing him to lack lateral movement at 3rd base and diminished his signature power. The injury developed into patella tendinitis forcing Ramirez into another 30-day stint on the Disabled List by the end of July.

Ramírez returned from the DL, finishing the season with a .283 batting average, 12 home runs and 49 runs batted in over 92 games. This was his fewest games played in a season since 2009, when Ramirez played in only 82 games.

====2014 season====
Ramirez focused on lower body workouts in the off season to prevent a re-occurrence of the knee injury from the previous season. His workouts proved successful as he was a starter for the 2014 National League All-Star Team. He alternated strong batting seasons with weak ones, but ended the season with a .285 batting average, 15 home runs, and 66 RBI over 131 games.

====2015 season====
In advance of spring training, Ramirez announced that the 2015 season would likely be his last.

===Second stint with Pirates===
On July 23, 2015, Ramirez was traded back to the Pirates in exchange for minor league pitcher Yhonathan Barrios. Upon his return to the Pirates, he was unable to wear his familiar #16 as that was being currently worn by first base coach Nick Leyva, so Ramirez chose to wear #17 instead, with Pedro Florimón making the switch to #23 to accommodate Ramirez. On September 9, 2015, Ramirez played a position other than third base for the first time in his Major League career, starting at first base.

Ramírez formally announced his retirement from MLB on November 5 but added that he hoped to play one final season in the Dominican Winter League with los Tigres del Licey. He also expressed an interest in remaining involved in baseball in the future.

==Personal life==
Ramirez has a son, Aramis Jr.

On January 12, 2024, Ramirez was inducted into the Chicago Cubs Hall of Fame with former teammate Kerry Wood. Their induction was announced at the 2024 Cubs Con.

<doc id="887439" wikidata="Q471669" url="?curid=887439" title="Eddie Pope">
<text>George Edward Pope (born December 24, 1973) is an American former soccer player who last played for Real Salt Lake of Major League Soccer and spent eleven years as a defender for the United States national team. He spent most of his career playing for D.C. United. Pope is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

==Youth==
Born in High Point, North Carolina, Pope attended Southwest Guilford High School. Pope had a very successful career playing for the North Carolina Tar Heels where he also kicked for Mack Brown&#x27;s football team. In 1994, he was a first-team All-American, and also earned All-ACC and All-South Region honors.

==Professional club career==
In 1996, D.C. United selected Pope in the first round (second overall) in the MLS College Draft. His first season in Washington, D.C. was split between United and the men&#x27;s Olympic team, which was preparing for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. However, he still played 18 games for United and won a league title with the team, scoring a golden goal in the first-ever MLS Cup against the Los Angeles Galaxy. He also played his first game with the national team, helping the team beat Trinidad and Tobago 2–0 on November 10 that year.

In 1997, Pope made quite a splash on the MLS scene. He was named MLS Defender of the Year and earned a place in the MLS Best XI, as well as winning a second MLS title. In 1998, Pope helped United win both the CONCACAF Champions Cup and the InterAmerican Cup, the first continental honors earned by an MLS team. He scored goals in both of these two finals; including the winning goal in United&#x27;s victory in the Interamerican Cup.

Pope&#x27;s 1999 season was beset by injuries, and his playing time was limited, which continued to pester him into 2000, although he would play 19 and 21 games, respectively, in those seasons, and he earned his third and fourth consecutive trips to the MLS All-Star Game. Injuries continued to dog Pope in 2001, but he again played in the All-Star Game and also played an important role in the national team&#x27;s World Cup qualification. His injuries continued into the 2002 MLS season, and he only appeared in seventeen matches.

On December 23, 2002, Pope was traded to the MetroStars, along with Jaime Moreno and Richie Williams, in return for Mike Petke, a first-round draft pick, and an allocation. Pope continued his quality play with the MetroStars, captaining the team to an excellent defensive record. He was named to the MLS Best XI for the third time for his efforts. In 2004, he had a down year with the Metros, but was still voted to the MLS Best XI for a second consecutive season. After the year, Pope was traded to expansion Salt Lake for an allocation. He played three seasons with Real Salt Lake, providing veteran leadership for the expansion franchise. In 2007, he retired from professional soccer. In ten years in MLS, he scored nine goals and ten assists, plus added that MLS Cup goal and an assist in the playoffs. In 2005, he was named to the MLS All-Time Best XI.

On June 14, 2007, Pope announced his plans to retire from all competitive soccer at the end of the 2007 season, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s just time...You get up in the morning and you&#x27;re in pain. Before practice, you are in pain. And after practice you are still in pain.&quot;

On March 11, 2011, he was selected for induction into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

==International career==
Pope began his international career with the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team on November 10, 1996, in a World Cup qualifier against Trinidad and Tobago. At the time, he was in his rookie season with D.C. United. He quickly became a fixture for the national team, which surprised the world when it defeated Brazil 1-0 and made its way to the finals of the CONCACAF Gold Cup. Pope also played in two games for the disappointing U.S. campaign at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. In 2002, he started all five U.S. matches in the World Cup, and played a big part in the surprising success of the United States in that tournament. In 2006, Pope was part of the U.S. team that participated in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In the second match against Italy, he received a red card which caused him to miss the third match against Ghana, the last of his team at the tournament.

Pope started every game he played with the national team. On August 3, 2006, Pope announced his retirement from international soccer. His international career included 82 caps and 8 goals over an eleven-year period.

==Post playing career==
Pope served as the director of player relations for the MLS Players Union following his playing retirement. In 2015, Pope left the MLS Players Union to work at the Octagon sports agency.

In 2022, Pope was named as sporting director of the newly founded MLS Next Pro club Carolina Core FC, to begin play in 2024. The club is based in his hometown of High Point, North Carolina.

<doc id="887441" wikidata="Q3888350" url="?curid=887441" title="PaRappa the Rapper 2">
<text>is a 2001 rhythm video game developed by NanaOn-Sha and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. It is the third and most recent title in the &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; series, following &quot;Um Jammer Lammy&quot;. The game was made available for the PlayStation 4 through the PlayStation Network in December 2015.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay follows that of its predecessors, in which the player must press buttons to make PaRappa rap in response to a teacher&#x27;s lyrics. Players earn points and progress by rapping in time to the music and maintaining a Good rating through to the end of each level. By successfully improvising raps, the player can obtain a Cool rating, during which PaRappa will be given the chance to rap freestyle by himself, although it can be lost if the player performs badly, which will drop the rating down to Good. However, they will drop down a rating to Bad and Awful if they are currently on Good, with the player losing if they drop below Awful or end the song with a Bad or Awful rating. &quot;PaRappa 2&quot; features some tweaks to the gameplay, as some of the teacher&#x27;s lyrics may change based on the player&#x27;s performance. For example, the lyrics may become simpler if the player is struggling, or become tougher if they perform well.
After clearing two stages in a row, players can participate in a minigame where they must hit targets held out by Chop Chop Master Onion&#x27;s Tamanegi students, earning bonus points which are added onto the previous level&#x27;s score. Clearing each level with a Cool rating unlocks music tracks that can be listened to after completing the game. Each time the player clears the game, the color of PaRappa&#x27;s hat changes from blue, to pink, to yellow, with each hat remixing the lines in each level. In addition to the single player campaign, the game features a two-player Vs. Mode, in which players are given a line to rap to, which they must improve upon by freestyling better than their opponent.

==Plot==
PaRappa, having won a lifetime&#x27;s worth supply of instant noodle products from Beard Burger&#x27;s burger shop, has become nothing short of weary from eating nothing but noodles for every meal every single day. When PaRappa complains about being served noodles by his crush, Sunny Funny, he becomes shocked when she calls him a baby, causing him to question his own maturity. When PaRappa and his friend P.J. Berri go to eat at Beard Burger instead, they are shocked to discover that for some reason, the burgers have turned into noodles. From a poster, the Beard Burger Master, the founder of Beard Burgers, comes back as a ghost and helps PaRappa make a &quot;Traditional Parappa Town Burger&quot;. Afterwards, PaRappa and P.J. learn that a mysterious phenomenon is turning all the food in town, not just burgers, into noodles. Papa PaRappa and General Potter, PaRappa and Sunny&#x27;s respective fathers, try to develop an invention that can stop the &quot;noodlization.&quot; However, they inadvertently shrink themselves in the process. Afterwards, PaRappa and P.J. participate in a workout on an adult show run by Chop Chop Master Onion, not knowing that Papa PaRappa and Potter are stuck small by Papa PaRappa&#x27;s invention. PaRappa presses a remote for a different T.V. show but accidentally shrinks both P.J. and himself, along with their friends and some other people. They are soon helped out by the Guru Ant and return to normal size. After undergoing army training under Instructor Moosesha, PaRappa helps rescue Hairdresser Octopus from being hypnotized into giving people afros. Later, PaRappa discovers &quot;Food Court&quot;, a video game cartridge, to be the cause of the &quot;noodlization&quot;. PaRappa&#x27;s father warns them that if a player loses the game, the cartridge will curse them to only be able to eat noodles. Despite this, PaRappa insists that he should be the one to complete the game.

Upon winning the game, PaRappa&#x27;s father reverse engineers the cartridge to create a device that can reverse the noodlization. PaRappa and the others use sweets and the de-noodlization devices to combat against the Noodle Syndicate, who are behind the town&#x27;s noodlization. They soon confront the mastermind, Colonel Noodle, who is revealed to be the son of Beard Burger Master who, similar to PaRappa&#x27;s situation, had grown nothing short of weary from eating burgers for every meal all his life (not helped by his friends rejecting him for it upon his first birthday party and his mother turning into a burger from eating so many) and decided upon discovering a love for noodles that they should rule the world instead. Thankfully, PaRappa manages to convince him to be more open-minded about various types of food, and he becomes good. As everyone celebrates with a party from MC King Kong Mushi, Sunny assures PaRappa that he&#x27;s more mature than what he thinks himself to be. Everything returns to normal excluding the situation repeating itself when he wins a lifetime supply of cheese.

==Soundtrack==

&quot;PaRappa the Rapper 2&quot; had its soundtrack named after its game. A promotional video of the song &quot;Say &#x27;I Gotta Believe!&#x27;&quot; was released, featuring members of De La Soul as chefs, mixed with clips of PaRappa.

==Marketing and release==
In Japan, McDonald&#x27;s released a demo disc alongside its Happy Meal, containing a demo of the first level which was changed to resemble a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant. The disc also came with a demo of &quot;Ape Escape 2001&quot;.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

GameSpot&#x27;s Jeff Gerstmann gave the game a 6.6, stating that &quot;an almost total lack of innovation makes the game seem pretty dated when compared with other games on the market. ... Even when played to perfection, though, the rapping still sounds just as stuttery as it did in the previous game. While it was excusable then and perhaps even a little charming, it would have been nice to see the developers make better use of the PlayStation 2&#x27;s higher specs&quot;. Though the game &quot;features the same 2D graphical style as its predecessor, but it&#x27;s not without its share of enhancements&quot;, he added: &quot;The music in the game covers a lot more ground, genre-wise, than the original did, but none of it is especially funny or toe-tapping – with the exception of the level that takes place inside an old video game machine. &quot;PaRappa 2&quot; isn&#x27;t a bad game, but it doesn&#x27;t have as much of the same off-beat charm that the original – and to a lesser extent, &quot;Um Jammer Lammy&quot; – had&quot;. However, IGN&#x27;s Douglass C. Perry gave the game a slightly better score of 7: &quot;The game concept hasn&#x27;t changed, leaning neither toward an evolutionary or even a moderate change in the way gamers play music games. ... [&quot;PaRappa 2&quot; is] not as hard as &quot;Um Jammer Lammy&quot; (which may be good for some folks), and it certainly covers familiar territory when it comes to the essentials – gameplay, graphics, and sound – but it&#x27;s still fun and happy-making&quot;.

<doc id="887444" wikidata="Q1918218" url="?curid=887444" title="Irma Serrano">
<text>Irma Consuelo Cielo Serrano Castro (; 9 December 1933 – 1 March 2023) was a Mexican singer, actress and politician. Famous for her &quot;tantalizing&quot; &quot;untamed spitfire&quot; voice, she was one of the most noted performers of the ranchera and corrido genres; she was nicknamed &quot;La Tigresa de la Canción Ranchera&quot; (&quot;The Rancheras Tigress&quot;) and later known simply as &quot;La Tigresa&quot; (). At the same time, she pursued a film career with more than a dozen films. At the time of her death, she was one of the last surviving actresses from the Golden Age of Mexican cinema.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Serrano achieved great success as an actress and producer in a series of controversial stage plays, especially the controversial play &quot;Naná&quot; (1973). In the 1990s, she also ventured into politics and occupied a seat in the Mexican Senate.
In her later years, she was the center of multiple scandals and controversies. She appeared in celebrity gossip magazines and television shows because of her political career as senator for her home state of Chiapas from 1994 to 1997.

==Early life==
Serrano was the third of three children (Mario, Yolanda, and Irma). Her father, Santiago Serrano Ruiz &quot;El Chanti&quot; (25 July 1897 – 17 December 1957), was a distinguished author, poet, and politician born in Suchiapa. Her mother, María Castro Domínguez, was a local aristocrat who owned various haciendas. Her older siblings were Mario and Yolanda. Her parents divorced when she was 7 years old. She was a cousin of poet, author, and diplomat Rosario Castellanos.

==Career==
===Music===
Irma Serrano began her artistic career as a dancer in the choreographic group directed by the dancer Chelo La Rué. Later, Serrano began her career as singer when signing a contract with Columbia Records in 1962. In 1963, she won several awards such as the Folklore Revelation Trophy, the Macuilxóchitl as the Revelation Songwriter and the Musa Trophy of Radiolandia. Serrano became one of the most popular Mexican folk music artists of the 1960s. One of her most remembered songs is the corrido of &quot;La Martina&quot;, considered a classic of the Mexican folk genre.

===Film===

She began her career in films at age 29 in the movie &quot;Samson vs. the Zombies&quot;, starring the popular Mexican wrestler &quot;El Santo (Samson)&quot;. She worked on films like &quot;The Extra&quot; (1962), opposite Cantinflas, &quot;Tiburoneros&quot; (1963, directed by Luis Alcoriza), and &quot;Gabino Barrera&quot; (1964) along with the actor and singer Antonio Aguilar, among others. From 1968, she began to use the pseudonym of &quot;La Tigresa (The Tigress)&quot;, taken from a comic that she herself starred in due to its popularity. In the 1970s she participated in her best films. In 1972, she starred in &quot;La Martina&quot;, inspired by her most popular song. In 1973 she starred in the fantastic film &quot;La Tigresa&quot;. In that same year, she worked in the film &quot;The Monastery of the Vultures&quot; of the filmmaker Francisco del Villar.

At the end of the 1970s and during the 1980s, Serrano&#x27;s appearances at the movies were rather sporadic. She performed special performances in films like &quot;Cabaret Nights&quot; (1978) and &quot;Lola la trailera&quot; (1982). In 1985 she produced &quot;Naná&quot;, inspired by the controversial stage play of the same name in which she herself starred years before. In 1986, Serrano made her last major film performance in the horror film &quot;The Lovers of the Lord of the Night&quot; next to Isela Vega and Emilio Fernández.

===Theater===

In 1972, Serrano acquired the old Virginia Fábregas Theater, located in Calle Donceles in Mexico City&#x27;s Historic Center. The actress remodeled the theater and renamed it &quot;Teatro Fru Fru&quot;. From the 1970s, Serrano starred in and produced a series of theatrical montages that caused controversy, particularly &quot;Naná&quot; (1973), a free adaptation of Serrano of the novel of the same name by Émile Zola. The stage play was produced by Serrano and directed by Maricela Lara. &quot;Naná&quot; caused controversy in Mexico because of its highly erotic content, and it remained on the billboard for four uninterrupted years (1973–1977).

In 1977, Serrano partnered with actor, producer, writer and director Alejandro Jodorowsky to perform the stage play &quot;Lucrecia Borgia&quot;. Nevertheless, the differences between the two caused a dispute that led to them independently producing their own versions of the work.

Other stage plays starring Serrano in the Teatro Fru Frú were &quot;A Lady Without Camelias&quot; (1977), &quot;Oh ... Calcutta&quot; (1977), &quot;Yocasta Reina&quot; (1978), &quot;The Cross-legged War&quot; (1979) and the autobiographical &quot;A calzón amarrado&quot; (1980, based on the controversial book published by &quot;La Tigresa&quot; a little earlier). In addition to starring in these works, Serrano also served as co-producer, co-director and co-author of the scripts, some along with the director, actor and producer Pablo Leder.

Her last theatrical projects were &quot;The Two Emanuele&quot; (1984, alongside Isela Vega and also represented in the &quot;Million Dollar Theater&quot; of Los Angeles) and &quot;The Well of Solitude&quot; (1985).

As a producer, she also performed a series of theatrical productions, some of them as part of the successful &quot;Theater at Midnight&quot; concept, created by Pablo Leder for a strictly adult audience. These productions included &quot;Emanuele LIVE&quot; (1981), &quot;Jail for Girls&quot; (1981), &quot;Vampira! (Emanuele de ultratumba)&quot; (1983) and &quot;Carmen&quot; (2004).

==Personal life==
It was rumored that Serrano and Mexican president Gustavo Díaz Ordaz had a short-lived romantic liaison. Neither confirmed the rumor until she published her book &quot;A calzón amarrado&quot;, in which she admitted the affair.

In 1994, Serrano successfully ran for the Senate, representing her home state of Chiapas.

On 25 March 2009, Serrano was arrested in Chiapas and taken into custody to Mexico City&#x27;s federal.

Serrano resided in Comitán, Chiapas. She died from a heart attack on 1 March 2023, at the age of 89.

<doc id="887447" wikidata="Q1353311" url="?curid=887447" title="John Landy">
<text>John Michael Landy (12 April 1930 – 24 February 2022) was an Australian middle-distance runner and state governor. He was the second man to break the four-minute mile barrier in the mile run and held the world records for the 1500-metre run and the mile race. He was also the 26th Governor of Victoria from 2001 to 2006.

==Early life and education==
Landy was born in Melbourne, Victoria, on 12 April 1930, and attended Malvern Memorial Grammar School and Geelong Grammar School. He was initially more interested in nature, and Australian rules football, though in his final year won the &#x27;Associated Public Schools Mile Championship&quot;. He graduated from the University of Melbourne in 1954, receiving a Bachelor of Agricultural Science.

==Athletics==
During his school years, Landy enjoyed watching middle-distance track events. He became a serious runner during his university years, joining the Geelong Guild Athletic Club in 1949. He was coached by Percy Cerutty, who trained him to cut his time for running a mile down to 4 minutes, 11 seconds, earning himself a place on the Australian Olympic team at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. While at the Helsinki Olympics, Landy befriended Emil Zatopek, the Czech four-time gold medal-winning runner, who persuaded him to increase the intensity of his training programme. He became faster still.

On 21 June 1954, at an international meet at Turku, Finland, Landy became the second man, after Roger Bannister, to achieve a sub-4-minute mile. He achieved a world record time of 3:57.9, ratified by the IAAF as 3:58.0 owing to the rounding rules then in effect. He held this record for more than three years.

Landy ran his second sub-4-minute mile on August 7, at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, held in Vancouver, British Columbia. He lost the Mile Race to Roger Bannister, who had his best-ever time. This was the first time in history that two men had run a mile in under four minutes in the same race. This meeting of the world&#x27;s two fastest milers was alternately called &quot;The Miracle Mile&quot;, the &quot;Race of the Century&quot;, and the &quot;Dream Race&quot;; it was heard over the radio by 100 million people and seen on television by millions more. On the final turn of the last lap, as Landy looked over his left shoulder, Bannister passed him on the right. A larger-than-life bronze sculpture of the two men at this moment was created by Vancouver sculptor Jack Harman in 1967 from a photograph by &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; photographer Charlie Warner and stood for many years at the entrance to Empire Stadium; after the stadium was demolished, the sculpture was moved to the Hastings and Renfrew entrance of the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) fairgrounds. In 2015, it returned to the site of the stadium. Regarding this sculpture, Landy quipped that &quot;While Lot&#x27;s wife was turned into a pillar of salt for looking back, I am probably the only one ever turned into bronze for looking back.&quot;

At the 1956 Australian National Championships prior to the Melbourne Olympic Games, in the final of the mile race, Landy stopped and doubled back to check on fellow runner Ron Clarke after another runner clipped Clarke&#x27;s heel, causing him to fall early in the third lap of the race. Landy, who was close behind, leaped to clear his body but scraped his spikes on Clarke&#x27;s shoulder. Clarke, the then-junior mile world record holder, had been leading the race. Landy apologised, helped him back to his feet and they both started running again. In the final two laps Landy made up the deficit and won the race. The National Centre for History and Education in Australia said that &quot;[i]t was a spontaneous gesture of sportsmanship and it has never been forgotten.&quot; Sculptor Mitch Mitchell created a bronze sculpture of the moment when Landy helps Clarke to his feet. The sculpture was dedicated in June 2002 and is on Olympic Boulevard, Olympic Park in Melbourne.

==Governor of Victoria==

On 1 January 2001, Landy was sworn in as the 26th Governor of Victoria, succeeding Sir James Gobbo. He was appointed by Queen Elizabeth II on the recommendation of Premier of Victoria Steve Bracks, who remained premier throughout his term. Landy retired as governor on 7 April 2006, and was succeeded by David de Kretser. On 15 March 2006, in the final month of his term as governor, Landy was the final runner in the Queen&#x27;s Baton relay during the 2006 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony at the Melbourne Cricket Ground stadium in Melbourne, presenting the baton to the Queen.

==Other accomplishments==
Landy worked as senior manager at ICI Australia, and had a public speaking career. For eight years (1971–78), he served on the Victorian Land Conservation Council, contributing to debates and recommendations about the balanced use of public land across Victoria. Landy authored two books on natural history: &quot;Close to Nature&quot; (1984) and &quot;A Coastal Diary&quot; (Pan Macmillan Australia, 1993).

Landy was commissioner-general for the Australian pavilion at Expo 86 Vancouver. On 12 February 2009, he was appointed the chair of the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund Advisory Panel. He stood down from the position on 7 September that same year.

==Death==
Landy died on 24 February 2022 at his home in Castlemaine, Victoria, aged 91. He had Parkinson&#x27;s disease for a period of time.

His life was commemorated in a State Memorial Service at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 20 December 2022.

==Honours and awards==
In 1949 and 1950, Landy played Australian rules football for Dookie College when he was at the University of Melbourne&#x27;s Dookie College campus and won the 1950 Central Goulburn Valley Football League&#x27;s best and fairest award.

In 1955, Landy was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to amateur athletics in Australia, was awarded the Australian Sports Medal in 2000, and in 2001 was awarded the Centenary Medal, made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), and a Knight of Grace of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem. In 2006 he was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) during the Queen&#x27;s visit to Australia. Landy was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985.

Over the years, Landy was awarded honorary degrees, the first being a Doctor of Laws from the University of Victoria in 1994 then, in 1997, a Doctor of Rural Science from the University of New England, followed by a Doctor of Laws from the University of Melbourne in 2003, and Doctor of Laws from Deakin University in 2009.

On 12 July 2008, Landy was the guest speaker at his club&#x27;s centenary dinner held in North Geelong. He had been a life member of the Geelong Guild Athletic Club since April 1958. Named after Landy, Landy Field in South Geelong is the Geelong region&#x27;s major athletic facility. East Doncaster Secondary College has a VCE centre dedicated in Landy&#x27;s honour. Central Park, in Malvern East, Melbourne, has a sports oval dedicated to Landy with a plaque which reads in part &quot;Named in honour of John Landy, resident of Central Park Road, who used this oval for his training.&quot;

==In media==
In the 1988 television miniseries &quot;The Four Minute Mile&quot;, detailing the rivalry between Landy and Sir Roger Bannister, Landy was portrayed by actor Nique Needles and Bannister was portrayed by actor Richard Huw.

<doc id="887450" wikidata="Q312627" url="?curid=887450" title="Stanisław Wyspiański">
<text>Stanisław Mateusz Ignacy Wyspiański (; 15 January 1869 – 28 November 1907) was a Polish playwright, painter and poet, as well as interior and furniture designer. A patriotic writer, he created a series of symbolic, national dramas within the artistic philosophy of the Young Poland Movement. 

Wyspiański was one of the most outstanding and multifaceted artists of his time in Poland under the foreign partitions. He successfully joined the trends of modernism with themes of the Polish folk tradition and Romantic history. Unofficially, he came to be known as the Fourth Polish Bard (in addition to the earlier Three Bards: Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz Słowacki, and Zygmunt Krasiński).

==Biography==
Stanisław Wyspiański was born to Franciszek Wyspiański and Maria Rogowska. His father, a sculptor, owned an at the foot of Wawel Hill, in the Długosz House. His mother died of tuberculosis in 1876 when Stanisław was seven years old. Due to problems with alcohol, Stanisław&#x27;s father could not fulfil his parental responsibilities. Stanisław was adopted by his aunt Joanna Stankiewiczowa and her husband Kazimierz. The Stankiewicz family belonged to the bourgeois intellectual class. In their house, Wyspiański became acquainted with painter Jan Matejko, who was a frequent visitor. Matejko soon recognized that the boy had artistic talent and gave him his first artistic guidance. Wyspiański attended Saint Anne&#x27;s secondary school. The school was unique for several reasons. First, although the Polish language was forbidden in educational institutions under foreign rule, the lectures at Saint Anne&#x27;s were delivered in Polish. Second, the teacher&#x27;s goal was to equip the students with a thorough knowledge of Polish history and literature. Third, graduates of the school, including Lucjan Rydel, Stanisław Estreicher and Henryk Opieński, were considered prominent figures in Kraków&#x27;s cultural life. As a student, Wyspiański took particular interest in art and literature. According to Joanna Stankiewiczowa, the young Stanisław portrayed small cottages, animals, plants, armors and decorations. Wyspiański also created a dramatic interpretation of Matejko&#x27;s painting &quot;Stefan Batory pod Pskowem (&quot;Bathory at Pskov&quot;)&quot;.

In 1887 Wyspiański enrolled in the Faculty of Philosophy at Jagiellonian University and the School of Fine Arts in Kraków. While studying at the university, he attended lectures in art, history and literature. Jan Matejko, the dean of the School of Fine Arts, soon recognized Wyspiański&#x27;s talent and asked him to join in the creation of a polychrome inside the Mariacki Church.

The years 1890–1895 were devoted to travel. Wyspiański visited Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Prague and France. His stay in France is regarded as a major point in his artistic life. He studied at the private Académie Colarossi. Since the school fee was very high, Wyspiański applied for a grant. During his stay in France he got acquainted with Paul Gauguin. Together they visited art museums, where Wyspiański was bewitched by the beauty of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes&#x27;s paintings. He also attended theatre performances based on Shakespeare and classical era plays. His future dramas &quot;Daniel i Meleager (&quot;Daniel and Meleagra&quot;)&quot; and &quot;Powrót Odysa (&quot;Return of Odysseu&quot;s)&quot; were based on the antic tradition. Meanwhile, he worked on several dramas, &quot;Królowa Polskiej Korony (&quot;The Queen of Polish Crown&quot;), Warszawianka (&quot;Varsovian Anthem&quot;)&quot; and the first version of &quot;Legenda (&quot;Legend&quot;)&quot;. The play &quot;Legenda (Legend)&quot; was based on the famous Polish legend of Wars and Sawa. In August 1894 he returned to Kraków, where he got involved in the modernist movement. It was then he designed and partially made a polychrome for the Franciscan Church that was composed of flowery, geometrical and heraldic motifs. Moreover, the prior of the church encouraged Wyspiański to design various stained glass windows, such as &quot;Blessed Salomea, Saint Francis Stigmata&quot; and &quot;God the Father&quot;. Wyspiański received an award from the Polish Academy of Learning for the landscape of the &quot;Kopiec Kościuszki (Kościuszko Mound)&quot;.
As a painter, interior designer and poet he cooperated with the Municipal Theatre in Kraków. First he designed furniture and scenography for the theatre performances, then he staged various dramas on the stage of the theatre.

He cooperated with the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Art and in mid-1898 was named art manager of the weekly &quot;Życie (Life)&quot;. Unfortunately, his first published dramas, &quot;Legenda (Legend)&quot;, (1897) and &quot;Daniel i Meleager (Daniel and Meleagra)&quot; (1898), did not receive the acclaim of the critics. It was the &quot;Warszawianka (Varsovian Anthem)&quot; that brought instantaneous acclaim to its author. The premiere of the drama marked his debut as a playwright of national dramas. The theatre premiere of the drama on 2 July 1901 starred Helena Modrzejewska as Maria. The years 1899–1900 marked the publication of &quot;Protesilas i Laodamia (Protesilas and Laodamia), Lelewel (Lelevel)&quot; and &quot;Legion&quot;. This drama is regarded to be the author&#x27;s polemic displaying a romantic vision of history. In 1900, Wyspiański married the mother of his four children, Teodora Pytko. In November the same year he participated in the wedding of his friend Lucjan Rydel in Bronowice, a village near Kraków. The wedding party was the inspiration for his widely acclaimed play &quot;Wesele (The Wedding)&quot;. It is a deeply critical yet sarcastic exposé of Polish society of the 19th century. &quot;Wesele&quot; transformed Wyspianski from a moderately successful visual and verbal artist associated with the Young Poland movement into a national dramatist-visionary whose significance in Poland is comparable to Yeats&#x27;s in Ireland, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s in America, or Maeterlinck&#x27;s in Belgium.&quot; The drama made references to the contemporary situation in Poland and depicted a powerless society. Although censorship barred the sale of copies of &quot;Wesele (The Wedding)&quot;, the play was staged in the theatre.

After the success of &quot;Wesele (The Wedding)&quot; four new plays based on Polish history were published: &quot;Wyzwolenie (Liberation), Achilles, Bolesław Śmiały (Boleslaus The Bold)&quot; and &quot;Legenda II (Legend 2)&quot;. The following years were devoted to publishing of &quot;Skałka&quot; and &quot;Powrót Odysa (Return of Odysseus)&quot;; meanwhile Wyspiański translated Corneillea&#x27;s &quot;Cyd (Le Cid)&quot; and Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Zaïre&quot;.

In 1906 Wyspiański became a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków. He was also a member of the city council.
In his last years, Wyspianski&#x27;s health deteriorated. As a result, he underwent medical treatments in Rymanów and Bad Hall and then settled in his small cottage in the village of Węgrzce. He died of syphilis, which was incurable at the time. His funeral took place in Kraków and became a national day of mourning. Wyspiański was buried in the Crypt of the Distinguished in the Skałka Church.

==Creative output==

Wyspiański&#x27;s artistic output is very eclectic. Among dramas and poetry, there are views of Cracow (drawings, sketch-books, oil-paintings, pastel drawings), portraits and self-portraits, designs of stained glass windows and paintings, illustrations, graphic art, and designs for furniture and interiors, and development of Wawel.

Drawings, such as his 1890 self-portrait, and drafts from his journeys across Europe and Poland, are among Wyspiański&#x27;s better-known works. He later created a herbarium by drawing plants. However, he most frequently used soft pastel techniques; his first pastel drawings were produced between 1890 and 1894. They mainly present the artist&#x27;s family, friends and other artists. Wyspiański eagerly drew his children in everyday situations such as sleeping or feeding, including &quot;Helenka&quot; (1900), pastel drawing, owned by the National Museum in Kraków; &quot;Śpiący Staś (Sleeping Staś)&quot; (1902), pastel drawing, Silesian Museum in Katowice; &quot;Śpiący Mietek (Sleeping Mietek)&quot; (1904), pastel drawing, Museum of Art in Łódź; &quot;Macierzyństwo (Motherhood)&quot; (1905), pastel drawing, National Museum in Kraków; and &quot;Żona artysty z synkiem Stasiem (The Artist&#x27;s Wife with Their Son Staś)&quot; (1904), pastel drawing, now at the Upper Silesian Museum in Bytom.
Using this technique, he painted many of his acquaintances and artists, among others Kazimierz Lewandowski, Jacek Malczewski, Eliza Pareńska, the Kryształowicz family, Ludwik Solski, Irena Solska, and Jan Stanisławski. He painted landscapes of Kraków – the Kraków Planty Park with desmans (also painted in oil), the Vistula Rudawa River, cottages in Grębowo, and at the end of his life, views from his studio to the Kościuszko Mound. He also created a poster for Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;Wnętrze (Interior)&quot;.

Part of his output constitutes various designs – mainly stained glass windows, polychromes and interiors. Stanisław Wyspiański and Józef Mehoffer designed 36 stained glass windows together for the Mariacki Church in Kraków to help Matejko with the church conservation he had been involved with since 1889. During their stay in Paris they both made two boxes for the competition of the Rudolfinum Hall Decoration Design in Prague and curtain designs for the Juliusz Słowacki Theatre in Kraków. However, Wyspiański himself designed stained glass windows and polychromes for the Franciscan Church in Kraków (with the famous stained glass window &quot;Stań się&quot;), stained glass windows depicting Saint Stanislaus, Kazimierz the Great and Henryk Pobożny for Wawel Cathedral (not executed until 2005–2007 in the Wyspiański 2000 Pavilion), the design of a showroom of the Fine Arts Society (1904), and stairs and hall decoration for the Medical Society. In 1905 Wyspiański and Władysław Ekielski designed a scheme for redevelopment of the Wawel Hill (the so-called &quot;Acropolis&quot;).

==Wyspiański Museum and monuments in his honor==
At the beginning the Stanisław Wyspiański Museum in Kraków was located in the Szołayski tenement house built in the 17th century. Since 2021, the Old Granary has housed the Stanisław Wyspiański Museum. It is a new division of the National Museum in Kraków, sometimes referred to as the NMK Wyspiański. The museum holds the largest collection of Stanisław Wyspiański&#x27;s works in Poland, including 1 100 objects. 

At All Saints&#x27; Square, the &quot;Wyspiański 2000&quot; Information Exhibition Pavilion is a rare example of contemporary architecture in the Old Town, featuring three of Wyspiański&#x27;s stained glass windows.

In 1996 a plaque for Stanisław Wyspiański was unveiled at &quot;Hotel Nordbahn&quot; (since 2008 &quot;Austria Classic Hotel Wien&quot;) at Praterstraße 72 in Vienna&#x27;s Leopoldstadt, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Österreichisch-Polnische Gesellschaft&quot; (&quot;Austrian-Polish Society&quot;) and Wyspiański&#x27;s frequents stays at the hotel, where among other things he wrote his German dramatic fragment &quot;Weimar 1829&quot; in summer 1904.

In front of the new National Museum building in Kraków on 3-go Maja Street there is a monument to Stanisław Wyspiański. 2007 was named &quot;the Year of Stanisław Wyspiański&quot; by the Polish Sejm.
==Kraków streets associated with Wyspiański==
* 26 Krupnicza Street: Wyspiański was born at 26 Krupnicza Street in Kraków, in a house that belonged to his grandparents. He lived there until 1873.
* 25 Kanonicza Street: In the summer of 1873 Wyspianski&#x27;s family moved to the house of Jan Długosz. Wyspiański&#x27;s younger brother and mother died here. In the autumn of 1880 Wyspiański moved into the house of his uncle and aunt.
* 1 Kopernika Street: Between 1880 and 1883 he lived in the house of the Stankiewicz family, site of the later PTTK Tourist House and the present Wyspiański Hotel.
* 2 Zacisze Street: Here was the Stankiewicz family&#x27;s new apartment. It was on the second floor of the now non-extant Central Hotel at the junction of Zacisze and Basztowa streets, with a view onto the Barbakan and the Planty Park. Because of the hotel&#x27;s expansion, the Stankiewicz family was forced to move out in 1885.
* 1 Westerplatte Street (then Kolejowa Street): In July 1895 the Stankiewicz family began living here in an apartment on the ground floor at the corner of Kolejowa and Lubicz streets. Currently at this site there are arcades and stairs to an underground passage. At the time Wyspiański had his studio in the nearby village of Grzegórzki, where he worked on stained glass window designs for the Franciscan Church.
* 10 Poselska Street: After a few months at Westerplatte Street, Wyspiański&#x27;s uncle died and Wyspiański and his aunt went to live at 10 Poselska Street in a second-floor apartment.

<text>Swimfan is a 2002 American teen psychological thriller film directed by John Polson and written by Charles Bohl and Phillip Schneider. Starring Jesse Bradford, Erika Christensen, and Shiri Appleby, the film is about a high school swimming star who finds himself stalked by a teenage seductress after a one-night stand.

The film was panned by critics, with the plot drawing unfavorable comparisons to similar films like &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; and &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;, but was box office hit.

==Plot==
Ben Cronin is a star on his high school&#x27;s swim team. His coach informs him that Stanford University scouts will appear at next week&#x27;s swim meet. Ben and his girlfriend Amy discuss their plans. Amy wants to attend school in Rhode Island but explains she will go to school in California to stay close to Ben. The next day, Ben nearly runs his car into Madison Bell and gives her a ride home as an apology. Later, he realizes that Madison left her notebook in his car. When he returns the notebook, he meets Madison&#x27;s cousin, Christopher. Madison explains that she has not eaten, so Ben takes her to a diner. At the diner, Ben tells Madison about his girlfriend, and Madison explains that she has a boy waiting for her in New York City.

Although Ben tries to end the date, Madison convinces him to go to the pool. Her aggressive flirtation lures Ben in, and the two have sex. They agree to remain friends and not to discuss their encounter.

The next night, Ben goes to a party at Amy&#x27;s house. Amy introduces Ben to her new friend, who turns out to be Madison. The two pretend to have not met. Shortly after, Madison obsesses over Ben—she stops by his house to meet his mom and bombards him with e-mails and instant messages. Ben realizes her unhealthy behavior and demands that she leave him alone. His lying eats at him, but before he can confess, Madison tells Amy. Madison dates Ben&#x27;s rival teammate, Josh. Right before their biggest swim competition, Ben is disqualified for having steroids in his urine. Outraged and suspecting Madison had Josh set him up, he confronts Josh about the drug test. Days later, Madison accidentally calls Josh by Ben&#x27;s name while they are kissing. Josh realizes that Madison&#x27;s obsession with Ben is real and tells her off.

Ben tries to tell Amy everything, but she doesn’t believe him. The next day, he goes to the pool, where he finds Josh dead. The police suspect that Ben murdered Josh, so to prove his innocence, he breaks into Madison&#x27;s room to find evidence, where he discovers a bottle of steroids and a creepy shrine of his belongings. Christopher warns Ben of a similar case regarding a man named Jake Donnelly. When Ben visits Jake in the hospital, a nurse tells him that Jake&#x27;s girlfriend Madison survived the crash.

Disguising herself as Ben, Madison steals his car and runs Amy off the road, with Ben being framed for the crime. That night at the hospital, Ben and a few friends record Madison confessing her crimes, resulting in her arrest. She escapes custody, then enters Ben&#x27;s house and drags Amy to the school&#x27;s swimming pool. After watching Madison throw a handcuffed Amy into the pool, Ben dives in. Madison attacks them with the handle of a pool cleaner, and Ben grabs one end, pulling her into the pool. Unable to swim, Madison drowns while Ben frees the drowned Amy and resuscitates her. Later, after watching a swim meet, Ben goes outside to his car, where he and Amy kiss and drive away.

==Cast==
== Filming ==
The film was shot in New Jersey and New York. It was partly financed by Furthur Films, a production company founded by actor Michael Douglas.

==Release==
&quot;Swimfan&quot; opened in the number one spot at the North American box office in its first week of release, earning $12.4 million and beating &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; and &quot;City by the Sea&quot;.

The film was distributed by 20th Century Fox in most countries, beating out Paramount Pictures and Miramax in acquisition, but Icon Film Distribution distributed it in the United Kingdom. The worldwide box office gross was $34.4 million; nearly a third of that came from its first-place opening weekend in the US. Director John Polson credited the film’s strong opening weekend to Fox’s marketing campaign.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 15% of 93 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.9/10. The consensus is, &quot;A &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; rip-off, &quot;Swimfan&quot; is a predictable, mediocre thriller.&quot; Peter Bradshaw gave the film two stars out of five, calling it a &quot;teen &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; with an unappetising extra helping of &quot;Scream&quot; and saying it lacks &quot;the sardonic wit that parts of the script had seemed initially to promise&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; described it as a &quot;chiller resolutely without chills, in which even the pool water always seems heated. And inasmuch as the pic never owns up to its own trashiness, it&#x27;s not even enjoyable camp—like Mary Lambert&#x27;s recent &quot;The In Crowd&quot;—even though there&#x27;s about as much underage drinking, heavy petting and full-on sex as you can imagine this side of a very surprising PG-13 rating.&quot;

Ying, an ancient city within the borders of present-day Jingzhou, became the capital of the State of Chu in 689 BCE, and remained as such for over 400 years, including during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods of the Zhou dynasty.
During the Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms era, Jingzhou was known as Nanjun due to it being the seat of Nanjun district.

The city was lost to Eastern Wu by Guan Yu during the Three Kingdoms period leading to the modern phrase &quot;dàyì shī Jīngzhōu&quot; (), .

Under the Tang dynasty, it served as the southern capital and was known as Nandu ().

Later on, Jiangling was the capital of the Southern Qi and Liang dynasties. It was the capital of the small Jingnan Kingdom (also known as Nanping) that existed from 924 to 963 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.

Jingzhou was the site of one of the last major battles between Republican and Qing forces during the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. At the end of the Qing dynasty, Jingzhou had one of the largest Manchu populations, around half of the city, anywhere outside Beijing.

In July 1949, the area was taken by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

On September 29, 1994, Jiangling County and Shashi City were merged to create the prefecture-level city of Jingsha. On November 20, 1996, Jingsha was renamed to Jingzhou.

==Sights==

Numerous sites have been preserved from the Chu State period, including the ruins of five Chu cities, 73 sites featuring Chu Culture and more than 800 ancient tombs, including those of 18 Chu kings.

There are also historical sites dating to the Three Kingdoms period, such as the Wulin Battlefield (where the Battle of Red Cliffs took place) and the Huarong Path.

The city walls were rebuilt in 1646 and measure high and thick. The perimeter of the wall extends for . The city walls, city gates, watchtowers, and battlements have all been well maintained. Many of the towers on top of the majestic city gates have been damaged or rebuilt, leaving only the Chaozong Tower which was rebuilt in 1838 on the Gongji Gate.

The Jingzhou Museum has on display a well-preserved 2,000-year-old male corpse, as well as silk and lacquerware from the Warring States period.

A 58-meter-tall, 1,197-ton bronze Statue of Guan Yu designed by Han Meilin was constructed in Jingzhou in 2016. In 2021, the statue was dismantled, and is currently pending relocation to Dianjiangtai.

== Cuisine ==

Jingzhou is home to unique breakfast items. The city has a unique style of guokui, a Chinese flatbread, as well as a unique style of rice noodles.

<doc id="887456" wikidata="Q214461" url="?curid=887456" title="Adolph Sutro">
<text>Adolph Heinrich Joseph Sutro (April 29, 1830 – August 8, 1898) was a German-American engineer, politician and philanthropist who served as the 24th mayor of San Francisco from 1895 until 1897. Born a German Jew, he moved to Virginia City, Nevada and made a fortune at the Comstock Lode. Several places in San Francisco bear his name in remembrance of his life and contributions to the city.

== Early life ==
Born to a Jewish family in Aachen, Rhine Province, Prussia (today North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany), Sutro was the oldest of eleven children of Rosa (Warendorff) and Emanuel Sutro. He spent his youth working in his father&#x27;s cloth factory and at school. After his father&#x27;s death, he and one of his brothers, Sali &quot;(né&quot; Emanuel Sali Sutro; 1827–1908), began running the cloth factory.

The Prussian rebellion in 1848 caused the family to leave for America in 1850 and settle in Baltimore. Soon after, Adolph left for California and arrived in San Francisco on November 21, 1851. Adolph held a number of positions in San Francisco and eventually owned several tobacco shops.

==Sutro Tunnel==

In 1860, Sutro left San Francisco for Virginia City, Nevada after silver was found in the Comstock Lode with plans to continue selling cigars. He soon devised a concept for a tunnel to drain water from the mines and eliminate the threat of flooding. This concept became the Sutro Tunnel.

In 1865 Sutro incorporated the Sutro Tunnel Company and was granted an exclusive charter to build the tunnel by the U.S. Congress in 1866. The project encountered financial difficulties, due in part to William Ralston (1826–1875) of the Bank of California, who originally agreed to finance the project but later rescinded the offer. Over time, Sutro found other investors, including miners in the area. Sutro won miners&#x27;s support after a disaster at the Yellow Jacket Mine on April 7, 1869, allowing him to lobby the Miner&#x27;s Union in support of the Sutro Tunnel and begin construction on October 19, 1869.

According to historian Samuel Dickson &quot;(né&quot; Samuel Benjamin Dinkelspiel; 1889–1974), Sutro set off blasts of dynamite, leading the way for tunnel diggers&quot; during the tunnel&#x27;s construction. The tunnel was completed in 1878 and made Sutro &quot;the King of Comstock&quot; because it could drain four million gallons of water daily and was rented by mine owners at an average of $10,000 a day.

After a year of running the tunnel, Adolph moved back to San Francisco. His brother Theodore Sutro took over the Sutro Tunnel Company. Theodore Sutro sold the Sutro Tunnel Company to Franklin Leonard, Sr., after Adolph&#x27;s death.

== Estate, baths, and home ==

Sutro&#x27;s wealth was increased by large real estate investments in San Francisco, where he became an entrepreneur and public figure after returning from the Comstock in 1879. These land investments included Mount Sutro, Land&#x27;s End (the area where Lincoln Park and the Cliff House are today), and Mount Davidson, which was called &quot;Blue Mountain&quot; at the time.

Sutro invested most of his $900,000 savings on land acquisitions in San Francisco, eventually owning 1/12 of the city: &quot;I took my money and invested in real estate…when everyone was scared and thought the city was going to the dogs. I bought every acre I could lay my hands on until I had 2,200 acres in this city.&quot; His largest acquisition was the entire northwestern portion of Rancho San Miguel, which he covered with eucalyptus trees over the years: &quot;The people of the Pacific Coast…will wander through the majestic groves rising from the trees we are now planting, reverencing the memory of those whose foresight clothed the earth with emerald robes and made nature beautiful to look upon.&quot; Planting only eucalyptus trees became a controversial issue, as the plant smothered other endemic species and fires rapidly spread. Other lands were rented to the big Italian families that developed large agriculture operations and provided the Colombo Market with daily fresh picks.

Sutro opened his own estate to the public and was heralded as a populist for various astute acts of public generosity, such as opening an aquarium and an elaborate and beautiful, glass-enclosed entertainment complex called Sutro Baths in the Sutro District. Though the Baths were not opened until 1896, Sutro had been developing and marketing the project for years, attempting four separate times to insulate the site from waves using sea walls, the first three of which collapsed into the Pacific Ocean.

In 1896, Adolph Sutro built a new Cliff House, a seven-story Victorian Chateau, called by some, &quot;the Gingerbread Palace&quot;, below his estate on the bluffs of Sutro Heights. This was the same year work began on the famous Sutro Baths, which included six of the largest indoor swimming pools north of the restaurant that included a museum, ice skating rink and other pleasure grounds. Great throngs of San Franciscans arrived on steam trains, bicycles, carts and horse wagons on Sunday excursions.

In 1894, Sutro, in preparation for the opening of the Cliff House, bought a large part of the collection of Woodward&#x27;s Gardens, a combination zoo, amusement park, aquarium, and art gallery which had closed in 1891.
The Baths were saltwater and springwater pools, heated to varying degrees, and surrounded by a concert hall and museums stocked with treasures that Sutro had collected in his travels and from Woodward&#x27;s Gardens. The baths became very popular despite their remote location, across the open dunes to the west of the populated areas of the city. This popularity was partly due to the low entry fee for visiting the Baths and riding the excursion railroad he built to reach them.

Sutro managed a great increase in the value of his outlying land investments as a direct result of the development burst that his vacationers&#x27; railroad spawned. He also increased the value of his lands by planting his property at Mount Sutro with saplings of fast-growing eucalyptus. This occurred at the same time as city Supervisors granted tax-free status to &quot;forested&quot; lands within city limits. Small fragments of the forest still exist. The largest is at Mount Sutro, where are the property of the University of California, San Francisco, and another 19 are property of the City of San Francisco.

At his death in 1898, his lands in San Francisco were valued at $3 million, but with a treasury of only $473.50.

===Segregation at the baths===
The Sutro Baths were segregated in the early years of their operation. In 1897, a black man named John Harris sued the Sutro Baths for refusing him entry because of his race. The case was tried in the San Francisco Superior Court, which ruled in Harris&#x27; favor.

===Destruction of baths===
A fire destroyed the baths complex in 1966 and all that remains now are ruins. The fire was later determined to be arson. Developers, planning to turn the location into apartments, took their insurance money and left the property behind.

== Mayor (1894–1896) ==
Sutro&#x27;s reputation as a provider of diversions and culture for the average person led the politically weak and radical Populist Party to draft him to run for mayor on their ticket. He won on an anti-big business platform, inveighing against the tight grip that the Southern Pacific Railroad had over local businesses. According to historian Alexander Saxton:
Sutro was quickly considered a failed mayor, ill-suited for political work, and did not provide any popularity boost to the Populist party.

At the time of his death, in 1898, his fortune was extensive and his legal affairs in disarray. As a result, his heirs fought bitterly over his holdings.

Many of Sutro&#x27;s gifts to the city of San Francisco still exist and bear his name, such as Mount Sutro, originally Mount Parnassus (a lower hill nearby is the location of the Sutro Tower), and Sutro Heights and Sutro Heights Park. Sutro Baths became a skating rink and then was destroyed by a fire in 1966. The ruins of the baths (mostly the concrete foundations) are just north of the Cliff House. They are part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
(1894–1896)

==Family==
In 1854, Sutro married Leah Harris (1832–1893). They had seven children:

Leah filed for divorce from Adolph in 1879 and the two officially separated on July 3, 1880. Shortly after Adolph&#x27;s death in 1898, Clara Louisa Kluge (1863–1943) claimed to be his widow by way of common law marriage. She retained attorney Van R. Paterson (1849–1902) and prevailed in securing financial support for her two children that she claimed Adolph had fathered:

A brother of Adolph, Otto Sutro (1833–1896), was an organist, conductor, and minor composer who was prominent in music in Baltimore, Maryland. Otto&#x27;s daughters, Rose Laura Sutro (1870–1957) and Ottilie Sutro (1872–1970), were an internationally acclaimed piano-duo team.

Another brother, Theodore Sutro (1845–1927), a New York City lawyer, married Florence Sutro (née Florence Edith Clinton; 1865–1906), a musician, painter, and founding president of National Federation of Women&#x27;s Music Clubs on September 18, 1884, in Manhattan.

In New York City in 1874, two brothers of Adolph Sutro, Ludwig and Hugo Sutro, established Sutro Brothers, an enterprise for the manufacture of braids and similar articles, which in time grew to large proportions. Upon the incorporation, in 1888, the firm was renamed Sutro Brothers Braid Company.

Cousins of Adolph Sutro, Charles and Gustav Sutro, founded Sutro &amp; Company, a stockbroking company, in San Francisco in 1858. Sutro &amp; Co. stayed independent until 1986 when it was bought by John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. There it was merged with Tucker Anthony to form Tucker Anthony Sutro, which in turn was bought by Royal Bank of Canada in 2001.

== Portrayal on TV ==
The actor Robert Argent played Sutro in the 1957 episode (season 5, episode 17), &quot;The Man Who Was Never Licked&quot; of the TV show &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. William Hudson was cast in the same episode as Lucky Baldwin, a powerful, 19th-century California businessman.

<doc id="887457" wikidata="Q232219" url="?curid=887457" title="40 Days and 40 Nights">
<text>40 Days and 40 Nights is a 2002 romantic comedy film directed by Michael Lehmann, written by Rob Perez, and starring Josh Hartnett, Shannyn Sossamon, and Paulo Costanzo. The film depicts Matt Sullivan, a San Francisco web designer who has chosen to abstain from any sexual contact for the duration of Lent.

== Plot ==
Matt Sullivan lives in San Francisco with his roommate Ryan, working at a dot-com company. His obsession with his ex-girlfriend Nicole who broke up with him causes him sexual dysfunction with other women, which he confides to his brother John, a Catholic seminarian. After disastrously trying to fake an orgasm with a date, Matt learns that Nicole is now engaged. Hoping to resolve his issues, he vows to abstain from sexual stimulation, including masturbation, for the 40 days of Lent.

On the first day of his celibacy, Matt purges his apartment of items of temptation and reminders of Nicole. He befriends a stranger named Erica at a laundromat, despite being unable to speak to her. Unbeknownst to Matt, his coworkers and Ryan start a pool to bet on how long he can last, which soon spreads online. He revisits the laundromat to see Erica, who reveals she works as a “cyber nanny” filtering internet pornography. They share an emotional connection, and Matt takes Erica on a date riding the city bus, but awkwardly avoids kissing her.

They both discover his coworkers’ betting pool, complete with its own website. Matt tries to explain his intentions, but Erica remains upset, and Matt&#x27;s boss decides to join him in celibacy. Having fallen for Matt, she agrees to another date, where they run into Nicole and her fiancé. Frustrated by Matt&#x27;s vow and his feelings for Nicole, Erica leaves him. Struggling with his urges, Matt is forced to endure his coworkers’ attempts to sabotage him. He turns to his brother for help, but even a family dinner results in their parents discussing their own sex life.

By Day 35 of Matt&#x27;s vow, the pool has reached $18,000, and a colleague convinces him to give in. As Matt marches into the bathroom to masturbate, he discovers his boss – who accidentally had a Viagra-spiked drink intended for Matt – masturbating in the next stall. With the entire office waiting, Matt escapes through the bathroom window and goes to Erica. They reconcile and spend a night of intimacy together without actual intercourse.

On Day 38, Matt has an inadvertent erection at work and is sent home. Nicole arrives at his apartment, having broken up with her cheating fiancé, but Matt rejects her advances and sends her away, which only excites her more. Overhearing the bet the next day, she goes to Matt&#x27;s coworkers, adding her own $3,500 to the pot and discovering that Matt has plans to celebrate with Erica at midnight when his vow ends.

On Day 40, the long-suffering Matt is unable to stop picturing women naked. He walks in on his brother kissing a nun; tormented by Matt&#x27;s exploits, John is taking a sabbatical from the priesthood. Fighting to contain himself, Matt has Ryan handcuff him to his bed, and awakens from an erotic dream to find Nicole has raped him while he was asleep, just before midnight. Arriving as Nicole is leaving, Erica assumes Matt was unfaithful and dishonored his vow, and storms out.

Determined to win Erica back, Matt gives her a box of moments they had shared; he finds her at the laundromat, and they finally kiss. As they consummate their relationship in Matt&#x27;s bedroom for hours, Ryan and the coworkers wait outside and place new bets on how long he can last, until Matt kicks them all out.

==Production==

Writer Rob Perez said they pitched the film to every studio in town, and eventually got a deal. Perez turned in the first draft a few months later and the film was greenlit. Thirteen months after having sold the pitch, filming began. The film was released a year-and-a-half later. 
In 2009, Perez noted how lucky he was that the film got made: &quot;At the time I believed the film was made because of the script. However, in retrospect I believe it was made because of a confluence of a 20 completely random stars aligning. This included an influx of money at the studio from a new partnership; their recent films had been hits; young comedies like mine were connecting at the time; a few bankable actors in the age range wanted to play the lead; the executive(s) happened to like (or at least think it was commercial) the concept/script; and that the producer was hungry enough that when he hit road blocks, he found other ways to keep moving forward. I can go on, but hope this is enough to illustrate my point: the film was made because of 20 things that had nothing to do with the script.&quot;

The film was shot primarily in Vancouver, but also featured some San Francisco locations, including Potrero Hill, San Francisco, California.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 39% based on reviews from 137 critics, with an average rating of 4.90/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;As romantic comedies go, &quot;40 Days and 40 Nights&quot; is smutty, sexist, and puerile.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 53%, based on reviews from 33 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars. He praised director Michael Lehmann for raising the film above the level of sexual sitcom, through his sympathy for his characters and use of humor to examine human nature. He also credited writer Rob Perez for dialogue about sex with &quot;more complexity and nuance than we expect.&quot; Not wanting to reveal too much, Ebert explained he was dissatisfied with the ending, writing: &quot;Nicole&#x27;s entire participation is offensive and unnecessary, and that there was a sweeter and funnier way to resolve everything&quot;.
&quot;Variety&quot;″s Todd McCarthy called it: &quot;A self-described abstinence comedy that is funny, sexy and silly in equal measure&quot; but notes &quot;had tried to deepen the film’s potentially serious themes as often as they make light of them, they might have come up with something more than the disposable farce at hand.&quot;

Peter Travers called it &quot;a one-joke sex farce,&quot; and complained: &quot;Yup, director Michael Lehmann, far from the glory days of &quot;Heathers&quot;, has made a movie about a hard-on, in which he relentlessly pounds a flaccid premise.&quot;

===Box office===
The film earned in its opening weekend $12,229,529. It earned $37,939,782 at the domestic box office and $57,152,885 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $95,146,283.

===Accolades===
In 2005, &quot;Empire&quot; included the film on its list of &quot;Worst Sex Scenes.&quot;

<text>Muckle Flugga lighthouse punctuates the rocky stack of Muckle Flugga, in Shetland, Scotland. Originally called North Unst Lighthouse, it was renamed in 1964.

The brothers Thomas and David Stevenson designed and built the lighthouse in 1854, originally to protect ships during the Crimean War. First lit on 1 January 1858, it stands high, has 103 steps to the top, and is Britain&#x27;s most northerly lighthouse. The light beam flashes white every 20 seconds, with a nominal range of 22 nautical miles (41km). In March 1995 it was fully automated. Thomas&#x27;s son Robert Louis Stevenson, the writer, visited it as a young man. As a result, Unst became his inspiration for the map of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. The lighthouse was served by the &quot;Grace Darling&quot; which was launched from the boat house below the lighthouse shore station in Burrafirth. Supplies were winched up by the blondin cable hoist to the courtyard, from the boat in a natural cleft of the rocks that provides a degree of harbourage.

This lighthouse was also used as a setting for the wartime comedy &quot;Back-Room Boy&quot;.

==History==
In 1851 it was decided to build a lighthouse on north Unst but, because of difficulties in determining the exact location, nothing had been done by the start of 1854. During the Crimean War, the government urged the commissioners to set up a light on Muckle Flugga to protect Her Majesty&#x27;s ships. A temporary lighthouse high was built above sea level and lit on 11 October 1854. It was thought to be high and safe enough to withstand the elements, but when winter storms began waves broke heavily on the tower and burst open the door to the living quarters. The principal keeper reported that of stone dyke had been broken down, and the keepers had no dry place to sit or sleep. Plans were made for a higher and more permanent lighthouse, but there were still disagreements about where to locate it, Muckle Flugga or Lamba Ness. The orders to start the work on the new Muckle Flugga tower were finally given in June 1855. The lighthouse&#x27;s original name was &quot;North Unst&quot;, but in 1964 that was changed to &quot;Muckle Flugga&quot;.

==Lighthouse keepers==
*Russell Powell 1977–1990
*Thomas J. M. Hutchison 1949–1962

==Muckle Flugga Shore Station==
Muckle Flugga was one of the few lighthouses in Scotland which had a separate shore station that served as accommodation for the lighthouse keepers when they were off duty (similar to Sule Skerry and its shore station in Stromness, Orkney). The shore station was sold off when the lighthouse was automated. Part of the building now hosts the Hermaness Visitor Centre at the entrance to the neighbouring Hermaness National Nature Reserve, which is managed by NatureScot.

<doc id="887459" wikidata="Q372848" url="?curid=887459" title="Joseph Lane">
<text>Joseph Lane (December 14, 1801 – April 19, 1881) was an American politician and soldier. He was a state legislator representing Evansville, Indiana, and then served in the Mexican–American War, becoming a general. President James K. Polk appointed Lane as the first Governor of Oregon Territory. When Oregon was admitted as a state in 1859, Lane was elected one of Oregon&#x27;s first two U.S. Senators.

In the 1860 United States presidential election, Lane was nominated for vice president of the pro-slavery Southern wing of the Democratic Party, as John C. Breckinridge&#x27;s running mate. Lane&#x27;s pro-slavery views and sympathy for the Confederate States of America in the Civil War effectively ended his political career in Oregon.

One of his sons was later elected U.S. Representative, and a grandson U.S. Senator, making Lane the patriarch of one of the state&#x27;s most prominent political families.

==Early life==
Joseph Lane was born in Buncombe County, North Carolina, on December 14, 1801, to a family of English extraction with roots in colonial Virginia. His father, John Lane, was a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. The Lane family moved to Kentucky from North Carolina when Joseph was a young child.

Lane left home at the age of 15, and was married four years later. He moved to Evansville, Indiana, in 1820. Lane and his wife, Polly Hart Lane, had 10 children.

Lane was largely self-educated, learning about the world from books he read at night. During the daytime, he worked and saved his money, investing it shortly in the purchase of a flatboat, with which he transported freight up and down the Ohio River. Financial success followed.

Lane was an eloquent public speaker, a talent that helped him to win election to the Indiana House of Representatives in 1822 at the age of just 21. He served in that body from 1822 to 1823, from 1830 to 1833, and from 1838 to 1839. He then moved to the Indiana State Senate, where he served from 1839 to 1840, and from 1844 to 1846. Widely esteemed by his peers, Lane was likewise elected as a captain of his local militia while still a young man.

==Mexican-American War==
The Mexican–American War broke out in 1846. Lane resigned his State Senate seat, and enlisted in a company of Indiana volunteers. His company was assigned to the 2nd Indiana Volunteer Regiment, and Lane was elected colonel in June 1846. He was appointed a brigadier general of volunteers less than a week later.

Lane and the Indiana troops were then deployed to Mexico where he fought with distinction, suffering two minor gunshot wounds, and was brevetted to major general in 1847. He commanded the Indiana Brigade at the Battle of Buena Vista, where he served under General and future President Zachary Taylor.

Lane also led the relief force which lifted the Siege of Puebla, defeating Antonio López de Santa Anna at the Battle of Huamantla.

==Oregon territory and statehood==
As soon as Lane returned from Mexico, President Polk appointed him governor of Oregon Territory. Lane received his commission on August 18, 1848. Lane arrived in Oregon on March 3, 1849, following a hazardous winter trip on the Oregon Trail. Upon reaching Oregon City, Lane&#x27;s first official act was to initiate the first census of the territory&#x27;s residents, which showed a total of 8,785 American citizens and 298 citizens of other countries.

While Governor, Lane also served as the first Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs.

Also among Lane&#x27;s early duties was the apprehension of five Cayuse Indians accused in the Whitman Massacre. The accused were brought back to Oregon City for trial, where they were convicted and hanged.
Lane resigned as territorial governor on June 18, 1850, in favor of a new appointee. On June 2, 1851, Lane was elected Oregon Territory&#x27;s Delegate in Congress as a Democrat. In May 1853, he was acting Territorial Governor for three days to assist in the removal of the unpopular John P. Gaines from office. Lane then ran for re-election as Delegate, winning election on June 6, 1853. Lane won two more terms of office as Delegate in the June elections of 1855 and 1857. He was subsequently elected as one of Oregon&#x27;s first two United States Senators when Oregon became a state in 1859.

==Military operations against Native Americans==
In 1853, after he was re-elected as Delegate, but before he left for Washington, D.C., Lane was appointed as brigadier general commanding a force of volunteers raised to suppress recent Native American violence. Lane led the force to southern Oregon to stop Native American attacks against settlers and miners there. Lane was again wounded in a skirmish at Table Rock, in Sams Valley, not far from today&#x27;s cities of Medford and Central Point.

Lane was also an active participant in the so-called Rogue River Wars of 1855–1856, being wounded in the shoulder at the Battle of Evans Creek.

==Vice-presidential nomination and political decline==
In 1860, the Democratic Party split on the issue of slavery. Pro-slavery Democrats from the South left the national convention and nominated their own candidates: John C. Breckinridge for president, and Lane for vice president.

This &quot;Southern Democrat&quot; ticket was defeated. With his defeat for vice president and the beginning of the Civil War, Lane&#x27;s political career ended. His pro-slavery views had been controversial in Oregon; his pro-secessionist views were wholly unacceptable. Lane became notorious for an exchange with Andrew Johnson of Tennessee on his last day in the Senate. Johnson had spoken in favor of the Union and denounced secession. A referendum on secession in Tennessee failed shortly thereafter, generally credited to Johnson&#x27;s speech. On March 2, Lane accused Johnson of having &quot;sold his birthright&quot; as a Southerner. Johnson responded by suggesting that Lane was a hypocrite for so accusing Johnson when Lane so staunchly supported a movement of active treason against the United States.

==Later years==

Lane had taken a land claim of located just north of Roseburg, Oregon, in 1851. He later purchased a ranch located about east of that town, which he owned for a number of years before selling to a son. Lane also constructed a home overlooking the South Umpqua River; after his Senate term, he retired there in 1861. Although openly sympathetic to the Confederate cause, he remained home on his ranch; he did not participate in the war, nor did he make a return to politics after that date. He has been accused of keeping a personal slave as late as 1878, an assumption based on the race of the African-Indian orphan, named Peter Waldo, he raised from the age of two to seventeen. Lane was baptized as a Roman Catholic in 1867, and his family was reared in the same faith, but he renounced that faith shortly before his death.

==Death and legacy==
Lane died at his home on April 19, 1881. His body was interred in the Roseburg Memorial Gardens.

General Lane&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s home in Roseburg, where he spent much of his time, is now a museum maintained by the Douglas County Historical Society. Known as the Creed Floed House, the Floed–Lane House, or simply the Joseph Lane House, it is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Floed-Lane House was never his dwelling place.

Lane County, Oregon, is named for Lane. Joseph Lane Middle School in Roseburg is named for him, as is Joseph Lane Middle School in Portland.

Lane&#x27;s son Lafayette Lane served as U.S. Representative from 1875 to 1877; another son, John Lane, fought in the Civil War for the Confederacy. Lane&#x27;s grandson Harry Lane was a mayor of Portland, Oregon, and then U.S. Senator from 1913 until his death in 1917.

<doc id="887460" wikidata="Q380759" url="?curid=887460" title="Franklin Knight Lane">
<text>Franklin Knight Lane (July 15, 1864 – May 18, 1921) was an American progressive politician from California. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as United States Secretary of the Interior from 1913 to 1920. He also served as a commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and was the Democratic nominee for Governor of California in 1902, losing a narrow race in what was then a heavily Republican state.

Lane was born July 15, 1864, near Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in what was then a British colony but is now part of Canada, and in 1871, his family moved to California. After attending the University of California while working part-time as a reporter, Lane became a New York correspondent for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, and later became editor and part owner of a newspaper. Elected City Attorney of San Francisco in 1898, a post he held for five years, Lane ran in 1902 for governor and in 1903 for mayor of San Francisco, losing both races. In 1903, he received the support of the Democratic minority in the California State Legislature during the legislature&#x27;s vote to elect a United States Senator from California.

Appointed a commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905 and confirmed by the Senate the following year, Lane was reappointed in 1909 by President William Howard Taft. His fellow commissioners elected him as chairman in January 1913. The following month, Lane accepted President-elect Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s nomination to become Secretary of the Interior, a position in which he served almost seven years until his resignation in early 1920. Lane&#x27;s record on conservation was mixed: he supported the controversial Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project in Yosemite National Park, which flooded a valley esteemed by many conservationists, but also presided over the establishment of the National Park Service.

The former Secretary died of heart disease at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on May 18, 1921. Because of two decades of poorly paid government service, and the expenses of his final illness, he left no estate, and a public fund was established to support his widow. Newspapers reported that had he not been born in what is now Canada, he would have become president. In spite of that limitation, Lane was offered support for the Democratic nomination for vice president, though he was constitutionally ineligible for that office as well.

== Early life ==

Lane was born in DeSable, west of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on July 15, 1864, the first of four children of Christopher Lane and the former Caroline Burns. Christopher Lane was a preacher who owned a farm outside Charlottetown; when his voice began to fail, he became a dentist. The elder Lane, disliking the island colony&#x27;s cold climate, moved with his family to Napa, California in 1871, and to Oakland in 1876, where Franklin graduated from Oakland High School. Franklin Lane was hired to work in the printing office of the &quot;Oakland Times&quot;, then worked as a reporter, and in 1884 campaigned for the Prohibition Party. From 1884 to 1886, he attended the University of California at Berkeley, though he did not graduate. Lane later wrote, &quot;I put myself through college by working on vacation and after hours, and I am very glad I did it.&quot; He later received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of California, from New York University, Brown University, and the University of North Carolina. After leaving college, he worked as a reporter for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. In 1889, he was admitted to the California Bar, having attended Hastings Law School.

Rather than practicing law, Lane moved to New York City to continue his newspaper career as a correspondent for the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. There he became a protégé of the reformer Henry George and a member of New York&#x27;s Reform Club. He returned to the West Coast in 1891 as editor and part owner of the &quot;Tacoma News&quot;. He was successful in driving a corrupt chief of police into exile in Alaska, but the business venture as a whole was unsuccessful, and the paper declared bankruptcy in 1894, a victim of the poor economy and Lane&#x27;s espousal of Democratic and Populist Party causes. In 1893, Lane married Anne Wintermute; they had two children, Franklin Knight Lane, Jr. and Nancy Lane Kauffman.

Lane moved back to California in late 1894, and began to practice law in San Francisco with his brother George. He also wrote for &quot;Arthur McEwen&#x27;s Letter&quot;, a newspaper which crusaded against corruption, especially in the San Francisco Bay area and in the Southern Pacific Railroad. In 1897–98, he served on the Committee of One Hundred, a group which was tasked with drafting a new city charter. The charter required the city to own its own water supply.

== California politician ==

In 1898, Lane, running as a Democrat, was elected to the combined position of City and County Attorney, defeating California&#x27;s sitting Attorney General, W. F. Fitzgerald, by 832 votes in a year that otherwise saw most offices across the state fall to the Republicans. He was re-elected in 1899 and 1901.

Lane ran for Governor of California in 1902 on the Democratic and Non-Partisan tickets. At a time when California was dominated by the Republican Party, he lost by less than a percentage point to George Pardee. (Theodore Roosevelt won the state by 35 points two years later.) Between 8,000 and 10,000 votes were disqualified on various technicalities, possibly costing him the election. During the campaign, the influential &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; slanted its news coverage against him. &quot;Examiner&quot; owner William Randolph Hearst later denied responsibility for this policy, and stated that if Lane ever needed anything, he should send Hearst a telegram. Lane retorted that if Hearst received a telegram purportedly signed by Lane, asking him to do anything, he could be sure it was a forgery.

Journalist Grant Wallace wrote of Lane at the time of the gubernatorial campaign:

At the time, the state legislatures still elected United States Senators, and in 1903, Lane received the vote of the state legislature&#x27;s Democratic minority in the Senate election. However, the majority Republicans backed incumbent George Clement Perkins, who was duly re-elected. Later that year, City Attorney Lane ran for mayor of San Francisco, but again was defeated, finishing third in the race. He returned to the private practice of law, and would not again stand for elective office.

Even before the mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a potential Democratic candidate for vice president, though since he was born in what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an era when political convention delegates were far more free to make their own choices than they are today, Lane wrote that he had heard that he could gain the support of the New York delegation, which he declined to do. While returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C., as an advocate for the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project, he stopped in Austin, Texas, to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature. &quot;The New York Times&quot; saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he had been promised help from Texas.

== Interstate Commerce Commission ==

=== Appointment and confirmation ===

The railroad companies, which were loosely regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), exercised great power in California because of the lack of alternate means of shipping freight. Lane had taken cases against those corporations in his law practice, and, in his gubernatorial campaign, had argued that they had too much power. In early 1904, Benjamin Wheeler, president of the University of California, suggested to President Roosevelt that Lane would be an admirable choice to serve on the ICC. Roosevelt agreed, and promised to name him to the next ICC vacancy. When that vacancy occurred in early 1905, Roosevelt forgot his promise and instead named retiring five-term Senator Francis Cockrell of Missouri. Wheeler wrote to remind Roosevelt that he had said he would name Lane. Roosevelt apologized for his oversight, but noted that, as he had just been re-elected, &quot;I shall make ample amends to Lane later&quot;.

In December 1905, Commissioner Joseph W. Fifer resigned from the ICC and on December 6, 1905, President Roosevelt named Lane to fill the remaining four years in his term. Opposition to the appointment came from Republicans, who pointed out that were the nominee to be confirmed by the Senate, three of the five commissioners would be from the minority Democratic Party. Historian Bill G. Reid, in his journal article about Lane, suggests that Lane&#x27;s liberal record was a factor in the Senate&#x27;s hesitation to confirm him. The dispute held up Senate approval. However, Republican Congressman William Peters Hepburn proposed legislation which, though its primary purpose was increased railroad regulation, would expand the Commission by two members. Roosevelt indicated that he would appoint Republicans to the new positions, and opposition to Lane&#x27;s nomination dissipated. The resultant Hepburn Act was signed by President Roosevelt on June 29, 1906, while his nominee was confirmed the same day and was sworn in on July 2, 1906.

The City of San Francisco suffered a severe earthquake on April 18, 1906. Lane, who was living in north Berkeley while awaiting Senate confirmation, hurried to the city within hours of the earthquake to do what he could to help. Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz immediately appointed him to the Committee of Fifty to deal with the devastation of the earthquake and subsequent fire, and plan the rebuilding of the city. According to Lane&#x27;s friend, writer Will Irwin, Lane did not content himself with committee work, but personally fought the fire, helping to save much of the Western Addition. In late April, the commissioner-designate took the train east to Washington, where he unsuccessfully fought to obtain Federal money to help the city&#x27;s recovery.

=== Commission work ===

The new commissioner spent the second half of 1906 attending ICC hearings around the country. The Hepburn Act had given the Commission broad powers over the railroads, and the Commission worked to deal not only with past railroad abuses, but to strike a balance between the desires of railroads and those of shippers.

There was a severe shortage of coal in the Upper Midwest in late 1906, especially in North Dakota, and President Roosevelt ordered an investigation. Railroad companies were accused of failing to send cars with coal to that region that could then be used to transport grain from that region to Great Lakes ports. It was alleged the companies were waiting for the lakes to freeze over before sending cars so that the grain would have to be transported by rail all the way to market instead of by water transport. Lane led the inquiry and held hearings in Chicago, and concluded that the car shortage was due to demand for cars further west, and that it would actually cause area railways to lose money since they could not transport the grain to port. In January 1907, he submitted his report to Roosevelt, which set out the causes of the shortage. He found that fifty million bushels of grain still remained on North Dakota farms or in the state&#x27;s grain elevators, because of lack of space in eastbound railroad cars. He recommended that railroad companies pool their cars with neighboring lines.

The Commission spent much of 1907 investigating the railroads and other companies owned by Edward H. Harriman, holding hearings across the country. In October, Lane determined that the Southern Pacific Railroad, one of Harriman&#x27;s lines, was engaged in rebating, a practice of effectively giving special rates to favored shippers that had been outlawed by the Hepburn Act.

Lane was reappointed as commissioner by President William Howard Taft on December 7, 1909, this time to a full seven-year term, and was confirmed by the Senate three days later. He was also approached by, as he put it, &quot;a good many people&quot; who urged him to seek the Democratic nomination for Governor of California in 1910. He did not run, remaining an ICC commissioner. Taft designated Lane as a U.S. delegate to the 1910 International Railways Congress. The Congress, which convened every five years, met in Berne, Switzerland. Before adjourning in anticipation of meeting in 1915 in Berlin, it elected Lane to its Permanent International Commission.

On July 1, 1911, the ICC ordered a &quot;sweeping investigation&quot; into the activities of express companies, which transported and delivered parcels. Lane presided over a lengthy hearing in New York in November 1911. Fellow Commissioner James S. Harlan noted that after hearing of the abuses of the express system, Lane recommended to Congress that it establish a parcel post service as part of the United States Post Office Department. Parcel post began on January 1, 1913, and was an immediate success.

Early in 1912, Commissioner Lane returned to New York to preside over hearings (begun on the Commission&#x27;s own initiative) into oil pipelines. While investigating the sale of pipelines to the Standard Oil Company, he grew frustrated with the testimony of a witness who, though secretary of several pipeline companies, could not say who authorized the sales. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to deal with a clerk or one of your $5,000 a year men. I want testimony from someone who can speak with authority.&quot; The Commission held that oil pipelines were common carriers, and ordered the companies owning them to file rate schedules and otherwise comply with the Interstate Commerce Act.

Lane also gave attention to improving the ICC&#x27;s internal capabilities. Lane and his ally, fellow Commissioner Balthasar H. Meyer, supported increasing the Commission&#x27;s ability to compute marginal rates, and the Commission engaged noted economist Max O. Lorenz (inventor of the Lorenz curve) for this task. Lane also advocated the creation of a new commission with powers over any corporation engaged in interstate commerce, as the best way to prevent trusts.

== Secretary of the Interior ==

=== Selection by Wilson ===

In the 1912 presidential election, Lane supported Democratic candidate and New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, though he declined to make campaign speeches on Wilson&#x27;s behalf, citing ICC policy that commissioners act in a nonpartisan manner. Wilson was elected on November 5, 1912, and on November 21 the commissioner spent much of the day with Colonel Edward M. House, the President-elect&#x27;s advisor, who would play a key role in selecting Cabinet appointees. The possibility of Lane becoming Secretary of the Interior was discussed, but he indicated he was happy in his present position. After the meeting, Lane had second thoughts, and asked House if he would have a free hand as Interior Secretary. House indicated that were he to prove capable in the position, Wilson would not interfere. Colonel House did not immediately recommend Lane for the job, but went on to consider other candidates, such as former San Francisco mayor James D. Phelan and Wilson friend Walter Page.

At the ICC meeting on January 8, 1913, the commissioners elected Lane as the new chairman, effective January 13. Wilson continued to keep his Cabinet intentions quiet, and Lane noted in January 1913 of those who met with the President-elect in New Jersey, &quot;nobody comes back from Trenton knowing anything more than when he went&quot;. On February 16, House met again with him (on Wilson&#x27;s instructions) to get a better sense of the ICC chairman&#x27;s views on conservation. According to House&#x27;s diaries, Lane, while reluctant to leave his position as chairman, was willing to serve in the Interior position if offered. He considered the position the most difficult Cabinet post but was also willing to serve in any other capacity.

As Wilson adjusted his lineup of potential Cabinet appointees, he and House considered Lane for the positions of Attorney General and Secretary of War. Finally, Wilson wrote to him on February 24, 1913, offering him the Interior position, and, although the two had never met, he accepted the post. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Chairman Lane was selected since he was one of the few California Democrats who had fought the railroads and who was not beholden to Hearst. At the time, it was customary not to make an official announcement of Cabinet appointments until the new president formally submitted the names to the Senate on the afternoon of Inauguration Day, March 4; however, &quot;The New York Times&quot; obtained the list of Wilson&#x27;s appointees a day early. The Senate met in special session on March 5, and approved all of President Wilson&#x27;s Cabinet appointees.

=== Department activities ===

The Department of the Interior in 1913 was a hodgepodge of different agencies. Many of them, such as the Pensions Office, Indian Office, and General Land Office had been departmental responsibilities since the Interior Department was organized in 1849. Others, such as the Bureau of Education, the Geological Survey and the Bureau of Mines, had been added later. The Department was also responsible for national parks, the Patent Office, the United States Capitol building and grounds, Howard University, Gallaudet University, St. Elizabeths Hospital and the Maritime Canal Company of Nicaragua, charged with building a canal upon which work had been suspended for twenty years.

Soon after taking office in 1913, Lane became involved in the Hetch Hetchy Valley dispute. San Francisco had long sought to dam the Tuolumne River in Yosemite National Park to create a reservoir that would assure a steady flow of water to the city. Lane had supported the project as City Attorney and continued his advocacy as the new Interior Secretary. The Hetch Hetchy project was strongly opposed by many conservationists, led by John Muir, who said, &quot;Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for water tanks the people&#x27;s cathedrals and churches; for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man.&quot; In spite of Muir&#x27;s objections, Lane was successful: Congress authorized the project after a long and bitter battle.

The new Secretary sought allies in Congress to implement his agenda. One such ally was the new junior senator from Montana, Thomas J. Walsh, whose support was key to the passage of the Hetch Hetchy legislation. While Walsh dissented from Lane&#x27;s policies on national parks, for example by supporting local control of development in his home state&#x27;s Glacier National Park, he sided with him on subjects ranging from development of Alaska to reclamation projects. The Interior Secretary advocated leasing, rather than selling, public lands with possible mineral deposits, and Senator Walsh pursued legislation in this area. While the two were successful in providing for coal land leasing in Alaska, a general minerals leasing bill would not be passed until shortly after Lane left office in 1920.

In July 1913, Lane left on a long inspection tour of National Parks, Indian reservations, and other areas under the Interior Department&#x27;s jurisdiction. Fearful that local employees would control what he was allowed to see, he sent an assistant to visit each site and provide him with a complete report on it two weeks in advance of his arrival. The tour was interrupted in August, when President Wilson asked his Interior Secretary to go to Denver and serve as his representative at the Conference of Governors. Lane did, and then rejoined his inspection party in San Francisco. After several days of meetings there, he collapsed because of an attack of angina pectoris. After three weeks recuperating, he returned to Washington against medical advice to resume his work. Following the death of Justice Horace Harmon Lurton, Lane was considered a possibility for elevation to the Supreme Court; however, Wilson chose another member of his cabinet, James Clark McReynolds.

As Interior Secretary, Lane was responsible for the territories, and advocated the development of the Alaska Territory. While private railroads had been established there, they were not successful, and he pushed for a government-built railroad, which he believed would lead to large-scale population movement into Alaska. In 1914, Congress passed a bill authorizing construction of the Alaska Railroad, which passed the Senate following a two-day speech in support by Walsh. Lane was the first Interior Secretary to appoint an Alaska resident, John Franklin Alexander Strong, as territorial governor. Secretary Lane&#x27;s vision for the territory was, &quot;Alaska should not, in my judgment, be regarded as a mere storehouse of materials on which the people of the States may draw. She has the potentialities of a State. And whatever policies may be adopted should look toward an Alaska of homes, of industries, and of an extended commerce.&quot;

Despite his role in the Hetch Hetchy controversy, Lane was friendly towards the National Park movement, and in 1915 hired Stephen Mather to oversee the parks for which the Department was responsible. Mather, a self-made millionaire and member of the Sierra Club, had written Lane a bitter letter in late 1914, complaining that the national parks were being exploited for private profit. Lane was intrigued by Mather&#x27;s letter, made inquiry, and found that Mather was well thought of by Lane&#x27;s friends—and had, like Lane, attended the University of California. Mather&#x27;s advocacy led to the establishment of the National Park Service in 1916.

In 1915, Lane returned to San Francisco to open the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The President was supposed to open the fair, but was unable to attend, and sent the Interior Secretary in his place. In 1916, Wilson appointed Lane to lead the American delegation and meet with the Mexican commissioners at Atlantic City, New Jersey about the unstable military situation in Mexico. These negotiations led to the withdrawal of United States troops from Mexico.

The Interior Department had never had a central headquarters, but had worked from offices scattered across Washington, with the bulk of the department located in the old Patent Office building. The Secretary lobbied for a new building for the Department, and, after Congress appropriated the funds, construction went ahead and the building was opened in early 1917. The structure, located at 1800 F Street N.W., now houses the General Services Administration.

Mather, who had been appointed the first director of the National Park Service, began to display apparent mental illness in 1917. His assistant, Horace Albright, reported this condition to Lane. The Secretary chose to keep Mather in his position, while allowing Albright to perform the functions of Mather&#x27;s job until Mather recovered, keeping all of this secret. According to Albright, Lane was not a conservationist, but did not care to interfere in the decisions of his officials, and so let Mather and Albright have free rein. Lane wrote in 1917:

=== World War I responsibilities ===

In 1916, Wilson appointed Lane to the Council of National Defense (CND), where he urged cooperation between the private and public sectors. He defused a difficult situation for the CND when it decided to merge its male-dominated state and local organizations with the separate Women&#x27;s Committee into a unified Field Division. Lane headed the Division, leading a board of five men and five women.

Lane bitterly opposed what he saw as the President&#x27;s hesitation to commit the country to war. He wrote to his brother George in February 1917:

Lane was a strong advocate of preparedness in the prelude to U.S. involvement in World War I. In early 1917, he urged Wilson to authorize the arming and convoying of merchant vessels. Wilson refused, but changed his mind when informed of the Zimmermann Telegram. In a critical Cabinet meeting in March 1917, Lane, with other Cabinet members, urged American intervention in the war.

He helped Thomas Garrigue Masaryk to create Washington Declaration in October 1918.

With Lane&#x27;s support, the nation&#x27;s railroads voluntarily united to form a Railroad War Board to meet the emergency. Lane made many effective speeches for the Committee on Public Information. The Secretary penned two brief works for the Committee, &quot;Why We Are Fighting Germany&quot; and &quot;The American Spirit&quot;, which were well received and widely distributed. He urged businessmen to make &quot;sacrifices as worthy as those of the men on their way to the trenches&quot;. President Wilson reportedly stopped discussing matters of importance at Cabinet meetings because the &quot;gregarious&quot; Lane divulged confidential matters.

Lane was a supporter of the Treaty of Versailles and of the League of Nations. He wrote articles urging, in vain, U.S. ratification of the treaty establishing the international organization.

== Later life and legacy ==

On December 17, 1919, Lane confirmed rumors that had been circulating in Washington for some months that he would be leaving the Cabinet. Secretary Lane stated that he had not done so earlier because of President Wilson&#x27;s illness. While he gave no specific reason for his departure, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Lane had found it difficult to make ends meet on a Cabinet officer&#x27;s salary of $12,000 and desired to make more money for himself and his family.

As Lane prepared to leave office in January 1920, he reflected on the postwar world:

Lane resigned in February 1920, and left office on March 1. He subsequently accepted employment as vice president and legal advisor to the Mexican Petroleum Company, which was run by Edward Doheny (who, after Lane&#x27;s death, would be implicated in the Teapot Dome scandal), as well as a directorship of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.

In a letter to Democratic presidential candidate and Ohio Governor James M. Cox in July 1920, Lane set forth his vision for America:

By early 1921, Lane&#x27;s health was failing, and he sought treatment at the Mayo Clinic. He was able to leave the Clinic and spend the remainder of the winter in warmer areas as advised by his physicians, but soon returned. Lane&#x27;s heart was in such poor condition that the Clinic could not give him general anesthesia during his heart operation. Lane survived the operation, and wrote of the ordeal, but died soon afterward. According to his brother, George Lane, the former Secretary left no will or estate. The vice-president of Lane&#x27;s company noted that the Californian had worked 21 years for the Government on a &quot;living salary&quot;, and the earnings from the one year of substantial wages had been heavily sapped by illness. Lane&#x27;s body was cremated, and his ashes thrown to the winds from atop El Capitan peak in Yosemite National Park.

According to newspapers reporting Lane&#x27;s death, it was said that had he been born in the United States he would have been elected president. Following Lane&#x27;s death, a memorial committee was formed by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt and former Lane assistant and member of the Federal Reserve Board Adolph C. Miller. The committee established a Franklin K. Lane Memorial Fund, initially dedicated to the support of Lane&#x27;s widow, Anne Lane, and upon her death to be used to promote causes in which her husband believed. The two future presidents, Miller, and National Park Service Director Mather were among the major contributors to the fund. In 1939, after Mrs. Lane&#x27;s death, the corpus of the trust (just over $100,000) was transferred to the former Secretary&#x27;s alma mater, the University of California, to promote the understanding and improvement of the American system of democratic government. Fifty years later, the entrusted amount, still administered by the University, had grown to almost $1.9 million.

A 1922 collection of Lane&#x27;s letters concluded with a fragment written the day before his death in which he speculates on the afterlife, mentioning figures from Ancient Greece before concluding that he would most like to &quot;loaf with [Abraham] Lincoln along a river bank&quot;. In Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;Pale Fire&quot;, the fictional narrator Charles Kinbote quotes part of this &quot;remarkable fragment&quot; from &quot;a great book by a great guy&quot;.

In November 1921, Lane Peak in Mount Rainier National Park was named for the former Secretary. Lane was named a National Historic Person on the advice of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada on May 19, 1938. A federal plaque was affixed to a cairn reflecting that honor near his DeSable, PEI, birthplace. Other tributes to Lane included a World War II Liberty ship, a New York City high school, and a California redwood grove. Lane&#x27;s patriotic essay &quot;Makers of the Flag&quot; adapted from a speech he delivered to Interior Department employees on Flag Day 1914, continues to be reprinted as a speech and in schoolbooks.

<text>Marcus Nispel (born 26 May 1963) is a German film director and producer, best known for several high-profile American remakes such as &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, as well as an extensive career in television commercials and music videos.

==Early life and career==
Nispel was born on 26 May 1963 in Frankfurt. He grew up near McNair Barracks and was able to learn English from hanging out with children of soldiers. At the age of 15, he got a job at a boutique called Hessler and Kehrer. When he had his first interview at an American ad agency, he was asked what do Oreos mean, and he realized the importance of understanding American culture, and how working in advertising helped him understand that. He received a Fulbright Scholarship at the age of 20 and attended Brooklyn College and New York Institute of Technology. He was also an art director for Young &amp; Rubicam. He started a production company, Portfolio Artists Network which later merged with RSA (Ridley Scott Associates) Black Dog Films to form Portfolio/Black Dog. He worked at RSA as a commercial director for several years, resigning in 2000.

==Feature career==
Nispel was set to make his feature directorial debut with &quot;End of Days&quot;, but stepped down before shooting due to issues with the budget. In 2002, Nispel signed on to direct &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;. He was initially opposed to remaking the film, but Daniel Pearl, the cinematographer for the original film and regular collaborator with Nispel, convinced him to direct. The film was released on October 17, 2003 to negative reviews but was financially successful, grossing $107 million worldwide.

After directing &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, Nispel signed on to direct a psychological thriller called &quot;Need&quot;, starring Diane Lane. He picked the film as he wanted something &#x27;diametrically opposed to TCM&#x27;, but it was never released. Throughout the 2000s and into the 2010s, Nispel would direct several more remakes of prominent genre films, such as &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (reuniting him with Platinum Dunes, who made &quot;Texas Chainsaw&quot;) and &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;. In 2015, Nispel directed the ghost exorcism film &quot;Exeter&quot;, formerly titled &quot;Backmask&quot;.

==Personal life==
He is married to singer/songwriter/commercial editor Dyan Humes-Nispel who has written songs for various artists including Whitney Houston. They have two children.

<text>Frederick William Schule (September 27, 1879 – September 14, 1962) was an American track and field athlete, football player, athletic coach, teacher, bacteriologist, and engineer. He competed for the track and field teams at the University of Wisconsin from 1900 to 1901 and at the University of Michigan in 1904. He was also a member of the undefeated 1903 Michigan Wolverines football team that outscored its opponents 565 to 6.

In 1904, Schule won the gold medal in the 110 meter hurdles at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri. From 1905 to 1907, he was employed as the director of the gymnasium and coach of the football and basketball teams at the University of Montana in Missoula, Montana.

Schule also worked as a school teacher in Wausau and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and as an assayer and bacteriologist in Utah and Chicago. He later worked as an engineer and superintendent for Westinghouse Lamp Company. In 2008, he was posthumously inducted into the University of Michigan Track &amp; Field Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
Schule was born in Preston, Iowa in 1879. His father, Frederick Schule, was an immigrant from Germany who was employed as a physician. His mother, Sophia Schule, was also an immigrant from Germany. He had four older sisters, Clara, Augusta, Henrietta, and Sophia. At the time of the 1880 United States Census, the family was living in Fairfield Township, Jackson County, Iowa.

==University of Wisconsin==
Schule began his collegiate studies at the University of Wisconsin, where he was a member of the track and field team from 1899 to 1900. In 1900, Schule won the Big Ten Conference championship in the long jump, becoming the first Wisconsin Badgers athlete to win a Big Ten championship in track and field. He repeated as Big Ten champion in the long jump in 1901 with a distance of 22 feet, 4-4/5 inches.

Schule received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1901 in bacteriology and chemistry. After receiving his degree, Schule worked as a bacteriologist for the Chicago Sanitary District for five months. He then returned to the University of Wisconsin for post graduate studies and as a fellow in bacteriology. From 1902 to 1903, he taught physics at a high school in Wausau, Wisconsin. He was the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) champion in hurdles in 1903.

==University of Michigan==
In the fall of 1903, Schule enrolled at the University of Michigan where he studied chemistry. He received a master&#x27;s degree from Michigan in 1904.

While attending Michigan, Schule was also a member of the 1903 Michigan Wolverines football team coached by Fielding H. Yost. The 1903 football team compiled a record of 11-0-1 and outscored its opponents 565 to 6.

In February 1904, Schule announced that he would also compete for the 1904 Michigan Wolverines men&#x27;s track and field team coached by Keene Fitzpatrick. At the annual Penn Relays Carnival held in Philadelphia in April 1904, Schule &quot;left the field behind in the [120-yard] hurdle event, and won in the good time of 15 4/5 seconds.&quot; Schule also set a world record in the 75-yard hurdles while attending Michigan. Schule&#x27;s record-setting time was 9-4/5 seconds at an indoor event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on March 5, 1904.

In June 1904, the University of Michigan&#x27;s Athletic Board of Control ruled that Schule was no longer eligible to compete for the school in intercollegiate athletics, because he had already competed for four years.

In 2008, Schule was posthumously inducted into the University of Michigan Track &amp; Field Hall of Fame.

==1904 Summer Olympics==
Schule competed for the United States as a hurdler at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis. He won the gold medal in the 110 meter hurdle event with a time of 16.0 seconds, beating fellow American Thaddeus Shideler by two yards. Schule also competed in the 200 metre hurdles event and finished fifth. The 1904 Summer Olympics have been called the &quot;Michigan Olympics&quot; due to the fact that University of Michigan athletes (including Schule, shot putter Ralph Rose, sprinter Archie Hahn, and pole vaulter Charles Dvorak) won ten medals, including six gold medals.

==Coaching career==
After competing in the 1904 Olympics, Schule was employed as an assayer and chemist in Utah from 1904 to 1905. In 1905, he was hired at the director of the gymnasium at the University of Montana in Missoula, Montana. He also served as an instructor and coach at the University of Montana. He was the head football coach from 1905 to 1906 and the head basketball coach from 1905 to 1907. In two season as the head football coach, Schule compiled a record of 4-7 as his teams were outscored by a combined total of 166 to 150.

==Later years==
At the time of the 1910 United States Census, Schule was living in Washington Township, Buchanan County, Missouri. He listed his occupation as a shoe merchant. He was also identified as a merchant residing in St. Joseph, Missouri in March 1912. Schule later worked a teacher at West Division High School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

In September 1918, Schule indicated in a draft registration card that he was living in East Orange, New Jersey, with his wife Flora Randolph Schule (born July 22, 1884, in Nortonville, Kansas). He listed his occupation as an engineer with the Westinghouse Lamp Company. At the time of the 1920 United States Census, Schule was still living in East Orange with his wife Flora. They had three sons, Frederick W. Jr., Robert, and Paul. Schule listed his occupation as an electrical engineer.

At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Schule was living in DeRuyter, New York, with his wife Flora and their three sons. At that time, he listed his occupation as a stock speculator.

At the time of the 1940 United States Census, Schule was living with his wife Flora in Jersey City, New Jersey. He listed his occupation at that time as a superintendent for a lamp manufacturer and also indicated that he and his wife had resided in Owensboro, Kentucky in 1935. In 1942, Schule completed a draft registration card indicating that he was unemployed and living with his wife Flora R. Schule in Jersey City.

Schule spent much of his retirement years in DeRuyter, New York. He moved to Poughkeepsie, New York, in 1960 and died there in 1962. He was buried at the Hillcrest Cemetery in DeRuyter.

<text>CBC Prime Time News was a Canadian nightly newscast which aired on CBC Television from 1992 to 1995.

==Background==
For the previous ten years, the CBC&#x27;s nightly newscast, &quot;The National&quot;, had aired at 10 p.m., and was followed by a 40-minute newsmagazine package called &quot;The Journal&quot;, which was hosted by Barbara Frum. However, following Frum&#x27;s death in early 1992, the CBC took the opportunity to revamp its flagship newscast.

The CBC&#x27;s live coverage of the Charlottetown Accord referendum results on October 26, 1992 effectively acted as a soft launch for the show, which formally debuted on November 2. With Peter Mansbridge and Pamela Wallin as equal cohosts of a package which replaced both &quot;The National&quot; and &quot;The Journal&quot;, &quot;Prime Time News&quot; combined news and &quot;Journal&quot;-style features into a single integrated program which aired at 9 p.m.

Despite the change, &quot;The National&quot; was not entirely discontinued; concurrently with the change on the main network, the CBC&#x27;s separate all-news channel CBC Newsworld adopted the title for its own prime time news program.

The program&#x27;s choice of name also created a conflict with CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Prime Time&quot;, whose host Geoff Pevere spoke out against the potential confusion caused by the television and radio programs having such similar names.

==Ratings performance==
Although ratings were strong at first, with its first week seeing a full 30 per cent improvement over &quot;The National&quot;&#x27;s average ratings during the previous year, the approach proved unpopular, both within the CBC and with network audiences and critics. &quot;The National&quot; had been produced by the CBC&#x27;s news department, while &quot;The Journal&quot; belonged to current affairs; bringing the two departments together was fractious, and the on-air rapport between Wallin and Mansbridge was visibly tense at times. Critics especially lambasted the debut episode, whose lead story was the last full day of the 1992 United States presidential election, as &quot;an uninspiring collection of newsreading, charts and cutaways to foreign correspondents&quot; more reminiscent of a local television station than a national network with the high reputation of CBC News, and viewer response to the new program&#x27;s format was highly unfavourable.

Also, because the program aired at 9 p.m., it was competing in one of the most heavily watched timeslots on the commercial networks. Although &quot;The National&quot; and &quot;The Journal&quot; had faced commercial competition at 10 p.m., they had been much more successful at carving out their own niche because in that time slot, almost all of the commercial networks were airing drama series. At 9 p.m., &quot;Prime Time News&quot; had to compete with popular sitcoms such as &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;.

As a result, &quot;Prime Time News&quot; rapidly dropped off in the ratings, seeing a 12 per cent viewership decline after its first week alone; by the end of the first month ratings were lower than &quot;The National&quot;. &quot;CTV National News&quot; concurrently saw its ratings jump 40 per cent, overtaking the CBC in national newscast ratings for the first time in its history, and CBC Newsworld&#x27;s edition of &quot;The National&quot; saw viewership gains of 30 per cent over that network&#x27;s prior prime time lineup, and itself sometimes garnered higher ratings than &quot;Prime Time News&quot;.

The shift also resulted in significant ratings declines for several other programs, including &quot;Man Alive&quot; and &quot;The Nature of Things&quot;, whose timeslots had been shifted to accommodate the new program.

==Format revisions==
In the fall of 1994, &quot;Prime Time News&quot; returned to the 10 p.m. time slot, and to a format closer to the old &quot;National&quot; and &quot;Journal&quot;. Mansbridge again became the sole anchor of the news portion of the show, and Wallin became the host of a magazine segment very similar to &quot;The Journal&quot;. However, the show retained the name &quot;Prime Time News&quot; for the 1994–1995 television season, and Wallin sometimes appeared as substitute anchor of the main news portion when Mansbridge was absent.

Ratings recovered significantly following this shift; by December, the show was regularly drawing fully 95 per cent of &quot;The National&quot;&#x27;s former audience.

In April 1995, Wallin was dropped from the program, and was succeeded by Hana Gartner in June. In the fall the newscast officially reverted to the name &quot;The National&quot;, while the magazine segment became &quot;The National Magazine&quot;. This format remained in place until &quot;The National&quot; was again re-launched as a one-hour newscast in early 2001.

<text>Realizational morphology or &quot;word-and-paradigm&quot; (WP) was a theory first created by linguist Charles F. Hockett. WP morphology focuses on the whole of a word rather than morphemes or internal structure. This theory also denies that morphemes are signs (form-content pairs). Instead, inflections are stem modifications which serve as exponents of morphological feature sets. It serves as an alternative for the Item-and-Arrangement (IA) and Item-and-Process (IP) Models.

The theory takes paradigms as a central notion. Instead of stating rules to combine morphemes into word-forms, or to generate word-forms from stems, word-based morphology states generalizations that hold between the forms of inflectional paradigms. The major point behind this approach is that many such generalizations are hard to state with either of the other approaches. The examples are usually drawn from fusional languages, where a given &quot;piece&quot; of a word, which a morpheme-based theory would call an inflectional morpheme, corresponds to a combination of grammatical categories, for example, &quot;third person plural&quot;.

Morpheme-based theories analyze such cases by associating a single morpheme with two categories. Item-and-Process theories, on the other hand, often break down in cases like these, because they all too often assume that there will be two separate rules here, one for third person, and the other for plural, but the distinction between them turns out to be artificial. Word-and-Paradigm approaches treat these as whole words that are related to each other by analogical rules.

Words can be categorized based on the pattern they fit into. This applies both to existing words and to new ones. Application of a pattern different from the one that has been used historically can give rise to a new word, such as &quot;older&quot; replacing &quot;elder&quot; (where &quot;older&quot; follows the normal pattern of adjectival comparatives) and &quot;cows&quot; replacing &quot;kine&quot; (where &quot;cows&quot; fits the regular pattern of plural formation). While a Word-and-Paradigm approach can explain this easily, other approaches have difficulty with phenomena such as this.

<text>In linguistics, a compound is a lexeme (less precisely, a word or sign) that consists of more than one stem. Compounding, composition or nominal composition is the process of word formation that creates compound lexemes. Compounding occurs when two or more words or signs are joined to make a longer word or sign. Consequently, a compound is a unit composed of more than one stem, forming words or signs. If the joining of the words or signs is orthographically represented with a hyphen, the result is a hyphenated compound (e.g., &quot;must-have&quot;, &quot;hunter-gatherer)&quot;. If they are joined without an intervening space, it is a closed compound (e.g., &quot;footpath&quot;, &quot;blackbird&quot;). If they are joined with a space (e.g. &quot;school bus, high school, lowest common denominator&quot;), then the result – at least in English – may be an open compound. 

The meaning of the compound may be similar to or different from the meaning of its components in isolation. The component stems of a compound may be of the same part of speech—as in the case of the English word &quot;footpath&quot;, composed of the two nouns &quot;foot&quot; and &quot;path&quot;—or they may belong to different parts of speech, as in the case of the English word &quot;blackbird&quot;, composed of the adjective &quot;black&quot; and the noun &quot;bird&quot;. With very few exceptions, English compound words are stressed on their first component stem.

As a member of the Germanic family of languages, English is unusual in that even simple compounds made since the 18th century tend to be written in separate parts. This would be an error in other Germanic languages such as Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, German, and Dutch. However, this is merely an orthographic convention: as in other Germanic languages, arbitrary noun phrases, for example &quot;girl scout troop&quot;, &quot;city council member&quot;, and &quot;cellar door&quot;, can be made up on the spot and used as compound nouns in English too.

For example, German would be written in English as &quot;Danube steamship transport company captain&quot; and not as &quot;Danube­steamship­transportcompany­captain&quot;.

The meaning of compounds may not always be transparent from their components, necessitating familiarity with usage and context. The addition of affix morphemes to words (such as suffixes or prefixes, as in &quot;employ&quot; → &quot;employment&quot;) should not be confused with nominal composition, as this is actually morphological derivation.

Some languages easily form compounds from what in other languages would be a multi-word expression. This can result in unusually long words, a phenomenon known in German (which is one such language) as (&quot;tapeworm words&quot;).

Compounding extends beyond spoken languages to include Sign languages as well, where compounds are also created by combining two or more sign stems.

So-called &quot;classical compounds&quot; are compounds derived from classical Latin or ancient Greek roots.

==Formation of compounds==
Compound formation rules vary widely across language types.

In a synthetic language, the relationship between the elements of a compound may be marked with a case or other morpheme. For example, the German compound consists of the lexemes (sea captain) and (license) joined by an &quot;-s-&quot; (originally a genitive case suffix); and similarly, the Latin lexeme contains the archaic genitive form of the lexeme (family). Conversely, in the Hebrew language compound, the word בֵּית סֵפֶר (school), it is the head that is modified: the compound literally means &quot;house-of book&quot;, with בַּיִת (house) having entered the construct state to become בֵּית (house-of). This latter pattern is common throughout the Semitic languages, though in some it is combined with an explicit genitive case, so that both parts of the compound are marked, e.g.

Agglutinative languages tend to create very long words with derivational morphemes. Compounds may or may not require the use of derivational morphemes also. 

In German, extremely extendable compound words can be found in the language of chemical compounds, where, in the cases of biochemistry and polymers, they can be practically unlimited in length, mostly because the German rule suggests combining all noun adjuncts with the noun as the last stem. German examples include (color television set), (radio remote control), and the often quoted jocular word (originally only two Fs, Danube-Steamboat-Shipping Company captain[&#x27;s] hat), which can of course be made even longer and even more absurd, e.g. &quot;Donau­dampfschifffahrts­gesellschafts­kapitänsmützen­reinigungs­ausschreibungs­verordnungs­diskussionsanfang&quot; (&quot;beginning of the discussion of a regulation on tendering of Danube steamboat shipping company captain hats&quot;) etc. According to several editions of the Guinness Book of World Records, the longest published German word has 79 letters and is &quot; Donau­dampfschiffahrts­elektrizitäten­hauptbetriebswerkbau­unterbeamten­gesellschaft &quot;(&quot;Association for Subordinate Officials of the Main Electric[ity] Maintenance Building of the Danube Steam Shipping&quot;), but there is no evidence that this association ever actually existed.

In Finnish, although there is theoretically no limit to the length of compound words, words consisting of more than three components are rare. Internet folklore sometimes suggests that (airplane jet turbine engine auxiliary mechanic non-commissioned officer student) is the longest word in Finnish, but evidence of its actual use is scant and anecdotal at best.

Compounds can be rather long when translating technical documents from English to some other language, since the lengths of the words are theoretically unlimited, especially in chemical terminology. For example, when translating an English technical document to Swedish, the term &quot;Motion estimation search range settings&quot; can be directly translated to , though in reality, the word would most likely be divided in two: – &quot;search range settings for motion estimation&quot;.

==Subclasses==

===Semantic classification===

A common semantic classification of compounds yields four types:

*endocentric
*exocentric
*copulative
*appositional

An endocentric compound (&quot;tatpuruṣa&quot; in the Sanskrit tradition) consists of a &quot;head&quot;, i.e. the categorical part that contains the basic meaning of the whole compound, and modifiers, which restrict this meaning. For example, the English compound &quot;doghouse&quot;, where &quot;house&quot; is the head and &quot;dog&quot; is the modifier, is understood as a house intended for a dog. Endocentric compounds tend to be of the same part of speech (word class) as their head, as in the case of &quot;doghouse&quot;.

An exocentric compound (&quot;bahuvrihi&quot; in the Sanskrit tradition) is a hyponym of some unexpressed semantic category (such as a person, plant, or animal): none (neither) of its components can be perceived as a formal head, and its meaning often cannot be transparently guessed from its constituent parts. For example, the English compound &quot;white-collar&quot; is neither a kind of collar nor a white thing. In an exocentric compound, the word class is determined lexically, disregarding the class of the constituents. For example, a &quot;must-have&quot; is not a verb but a noun. The meaning of this type of compound can be glossed as &quot;(one) whose B is A&quot;, where B is the second element of the compound and A the first. A bahuvrihi compound is one whose nature is expressed by neither of the words: thus a &quot;white-collar&quot; person is neither white nor a collar (the collar&#x27;s colour is a metonym for socioeconomic status). Other English examples include &quot;barefoot&quot;.

Copulative compounds (&quot;dvandva&quot; in the Sanskrit tradition) are compounds with two semantic heads, for example in a gradual scale (such as a mix of colours).

Appositional compounds are lexemes that have two (contrary or simultaneous) attributes that classify the compound.

===Syntactic classification===

====Noun–noun compounds====
All natural languages have compound nouns. The positioning of the words (i.e. the most common order of constituents in phrases where nouns are modified by adjectives, by possessors, by other nouns, etc.) varies according to the language. While Germanic languages, for example, are left-branching when it comes to noun phrases (the modifiers come before the head), the Romance languages are usually right-branching.

English compound nouns can be spaced, hyphenated, or solid, and they sometimes change orthographically in that direction over time, reflecting a semantic identity that evolves from a mere collocation to something stronger in its solidification. This theme has been summarized in usage guides under the aphorism that &quot;compound nouns tend to solidify as they age&quot;; thus a compound noun such as &quot;&quot; begins as spaced in most attestations and then becomes hyphenated as &quot;&quot; and eventually solid as &quot;&quot;, or the spaced compound noun &quot;&quot; directly becomes solid as &quot;&quot; without being hyphenated.

German, a fellow West Germanic language, has a somewhat different orthography, whereby compound nouns are virtually always required to be solid or at least hyphenated; even the hyphenated styling is used less now than it was in centuries past. 

In French, compound nouns are often formed by left-hand heads with prepositional components inserted before the modifier, as in &quot;chemin-de-fer&quot; &#x27;railway&#x27;, lit. &#x27;road of iron&#x27;, and &quot;moulin à vent&quot; &#x27;windmill&#x27;, lit. &#x27;mill (that works)-by-means-of wind&#x27;.

In Turkish, one way of forming compound nouns is as follows: &quot;yeldeğirmeni&quot; &#x27;windmill&#x27; (&quot;yel&quot;: wind, &quot;değirmen-i&quot;: mill-possessive); &quot;demiryolu&quot; &#x27;railway&#x27; (&quot;demir&quot;: iron, &quot;yol-u&quot;: road-possessive).

Occasionally, two synonymous nouns can form a compound noun, resulting in a pleonasm. One example is the English word &quot;&quot;.

In Arabic, there are two distinct criteria unique to Arabic, or potentially Semitic languages in general. The initial criterion involves whether the possessive marker li-/la ‘for/of’ appears or is absent when the first element is definite. The second criterion deals with the appearance/absence of the possessive marker li-/la ‘for/of’ when the first element is preceded by a cardinal number.

====Verb–noun compounds====
A type of compound that is fairly common in the Indo-European languages is formed of a verb and its object, and in effect transforms a simple verbal clause into a noun.

In Spanish, for example, such compounds consist of a verb conjugated for the second person singular imperative followed by a noun (singular or plural): e.g., &quot;rascacielos&quot; (modelled on &quot;skyscraper&quot;, lit. &#x27;scratch skies&#x27;), &quot;sacacorchos&quot; &#x27;corkscrew&#x27; (lit. &#x27;pull corks&#x27;), &quot;guardarropa&quot; &#x27;wardrobe&#x27; (lit. &#x27;store clothes&#x27;). These compounds are formally invariable in the plural (but in many cases they have been reanalyzed as plural forms, and a singular form has appeared). French and Italian have these same compounds with the noun in the singular form: Italian &quot;grattacielo&quot; &#x27;skyscraper&#x27;, French &quot;grille-pain&quot; &#x27;toaster&#x27; (lit. &#x27;toast bread&#x27;).

This construction exists in English, generally with the verb and noun both in uninflected form: examples are &quot;spoilsport&quot;, &quot;killjoy&quot;, &quot;breakfast&quot;, &quot;cutthroat&quot;, &quot;pickpocket&quot;, &quot;dreadnought&quot;, and &quot;know-nothing&quot;.

Also common in English is another type of verb–noun (or noun–verb) compound, in which an argument of the verb is incorporated into the verb, which is then usually turned into a gerund, such as &quot;breastfeeding&quot;, &quot;finger-pointing&quot;, etc. The noun is often an instrumental complement. From these gerunds new verbs can be made: &quot;(a mother) breastfeeds (a child)&quot; and from them new compounds &quot;mother-child breastfeeding&quot;, etc.

In the Australian Aboriginal language Jingulu, a Pama–Nyungan language, it is claimed that all verbs are V+N compounds, such as &quot;do a sleep&quot;, or &quot;run a dive&quot;, and the language has only three basic verbs: &quot;do&quot;, &quot;make&quot;, and &quot;run&quot;.

A special kind of compounding is incorporation, of which noun incorporation into a verbal root (as in English &quot;backstabbing&quot;, &quot;breastfeed&quot;, etc.) is most prevalent (see below).

====Verb–verb compounds====

Verb–verb compounds are sequences of more than one verb acting together to determine clause structure. They have two types:

*In a serial verb, two actions, often sequential, are expressed in a single clause. For example:

In Tamil, a Dravidian language, van̪t̪u paːr, lit. &quot;come see&quot;. In each case, the two verbs together determine the semantics and argument structure.

Serial verb expressions in English may include &quot;What did you go and do that for?&quot;, or &quot;He just upped and left&quot;; this is however not quite a true compound since they are connected by a conjunction and the second missing arguments may be taken as a case of ellipsis.

*In a compound verb (or &quot;complex predicate&quot;), one of the verbs is the primary, and determines the primary semantics and also the argument structure. The secondary verb, often called a vector verb or explicator, provides fine distinctions, usually in temporality or aspect, and also carries the inflection (tense and/or agreement markers). The main verb usually appears in conjunctive participial (sometimes &quot;zero&quot;) form. For examples, Hindi &quot;nikal gayā&quot;, lit. &quot;exit went&quot;, means &#x27;went out&#x27;, while निकल पड़ा &quot;nikal paRā&quot;, lit. &quot;exit fell&quot;, means &#x27;departed&#x27; or &#x27;was blurted out&#x27;. In these examples निकल &quot;nikal&quot; is the primary verb, and गया &quot;gayā&quot; and पड़ा &quot;paRā&quot; are the vector verbs. Similarly, in both English &quot;start reading&quot; and Japanese 読み始める &quot;yomihajimeru&quot; &quot;read--start&quot; &quot;start reading&quot;, the vector verbs &quot;start&quot; and 始める &quot;hajimeru&quot; &quot;start&quot; change according to tense, negation, and the like, while the main verbs &quot;reading&quot; and 読み &quot;yomi&quot; &quot;reading&quot; usually remain the same. An exception to this is the passive voice, in which both English and Japanese modify the main verb, i.e. &quot;start to be read&quot; and 読まれ始める &quot;yomarehajimeru&quot; lit. &quot;read--start&quot; &quot;start to be read&quot;. With a few exceptions, all compound verbs alternate with their simple counterparts. That is, removing the vector does not affect grammaticality at all nor the meaning very much: निकला &quot;nikalā&quot; &#x27;(He) went out.&#x27; In a few languages both components of the compound verb can be finite forms: Kurukh &quot;kecc-ar ker-ar&quot; lit. &quot;died-3pl went-3pl&quot; &#x27;(They) died.&#x27;
*Compound verbs are very common in some languages, such as the northern Indo-Aryan languages Hindustani and Punjabi, and Dravidian languages like Tamil, where as many as 20% of verb forms in running text are compound. They exist but are less common in other Indo-Aryan languages like Marathi and Nepali, in Tibeto-Burman languages like Limbu and Newari, in Turkic languages like Turkish and Kyrgyz, in Korean and Japanese, and in northeast Caucasian languages like Tsez and Avar.
*Under the influence of a Quichua substrate speakers living in the Ecuadorian altiplano have innovated compound verbs in Spanish:

:&quot; Botaremos matándote&quot; &#x27;We will kill you.&#x27; (Cf. Quichua

:Likewise in Hindi:
*Compound verb equivalents in English (examples from the internet):
:&quot;What did you go and do that for?&quot;
:&quot;If you are not giving away free information on your web site then a huge proportion of your business is just upping and leaving.&quot;
:&quot;Big Pig, she took and built herself a house out of brush.&quot;
*Caution: In descriptions of Persian and other Iranian languages the term &#x27;compound verb&#x27; refers to noun-plus-verb compounds, not to the verb–verb compounds discussed here.

====Parasynthetic compounds====
Parasynthetic compounds are formed by a combination of compounding and derivation, with multiple lexical stems and a derivational affix. For example, English &quot;black-eyed&quot; is composed of &quot;black&quot;, &quot;eye&quot;, and &quot;-ed&quot; &#x27;having&#x27;, with the meaning &#x27;having a black eye&#x27;; Italian &quot;imbustare&quot; is composed of &quot;in-&quot; &#x27;in&#x27;, &quot;busta&quot; &#x27;envelope&#x27;, &quot;-are&quot; (verbal suffix), with the meaning &#x27;to put into an envelope&#x27;.

====Compound adpositions====
Compound prepositions formed by prepositions and nouns are common in English and the Romance languages (consider English &quot;on top of&quot;, Spanish &quot;encima de&quot;, etc.). Hindi has a small number of simple (i.e., one-word) postpositions and a large number of compound postpositions, mostly consisting of simple postposition &quot;ke&quot; followed by a specific postposition (e.g., &quot;ke pas&quot;, &quot;near&quot;; &quot;ke nīche&quot;, &quot;underneath&quot;).

Spanish:
* &#x27;science fiction&#x27;: , &#x27;science&#x27;, + , &#x27;fiction&#x27; (This word is a calque from the English expression &quot;science fiction&quot;. In English, the head of a compound word is the last morpheme: science &quot;fiction&quot;. Conversely, the Spanish head is located at the front, so &quot;ciencia ficción&quot; sounds like a kind of fictional science rather than scientific fiction.)
* &#x27;centipede&#x27;: &#x27;hundred&#x27; + &#x27;feet&#x27;
* &#x27;railway&#x27;: &#x27;iron&#x27; + &#x27;lane&#x27;
* &#x27;umbrella&#x27;: &#x27;stops&#x27; + &#x27;(the) water&#x27;
* &#x27;keeping the head low in a bad mood&#x27;: &quot;cabeza&quot; &#x27;head&#x27; + &quot;bajo&quot; &#x27;down&#x27;
* &#x27;seesaw&#x27; (contraction of &#x27;goes up and down&#x27;)
* &#x27;windshield wiper&#x27; is a nested compound: &#x27;clean&#x27; + &quot;windshield&quot;, which is itself a compound of &#x27;stop&#x27; + &#x27;breezes&#x27;.

Tamil:
* In &quot;Cemmozhi&quot; (Classical Tamil), rules for compounding are laid down in grammars such as Tolkappiyam and Nannūl, in various forms, under the name &quot;punarcci&quot;. Examples of compounds include from &#x27;kō&#x27; (king) + &#x27;puram&#x27; (exterior). Sometimes phonemes may be inserted during the blending process such as in kovil from &#x27;kō&#x27; (king) + &#x27;il&#x27; (home). Other types are like &quot;vennai&quot; (butter) from &#x27;veḷḷai&#x27; (white) + &#x27;nei&#x27; (ghee); note how &#x27;veḷḷai&#x27; becomes &#x27;ven&#x27;.
* In &quot;koṭuntamizh&quot; (Non-standard Tamil), parts of words from other languages may be morphed into Tamil. Common examples include &#x27;ratta-azhuttam&#x27; (blood pressure) from the Sanskrit &quot;rakta&quot; (blood) and &quot;Cemmozhi&quot; &#x27;azhuttam&#x27; (pressure); note how &quot;rakta&quot; becomes &quot;ratta&quot; in Tamil order to remove the consonant-cluster. This also happens with English, for examples &quot;kāpi-kaṭai&quot; (coffee shop) is from English &quot;coffee&quot;, which becomes &quot;kāpi&quot; in Tamil, and the Tamil &quot;kaṭai&quot; meaning shop.

Tłįchǫ Yatiì/Dogrib:
*&quot;dlòotsǫ̀ǫ̀&quot; &#x27;peanut butter&#x27;: &quot;dlòo&quot; &#x27;squirrel&#x27; + &quot;tsǫ̀ǫ̀&quot; &#x27;dung&#x27;
*&quot;eyakǫ̀&quot; &#x27;hospital&quot;: &quot;eya&quot; &#x27;sick&#x27; + &quot;kǫ̀&quot; &#x27;house&#x27;
*&quot;dè gotłeè&quot; &#x27;kerosene&#x27;: &quot;dè&quot; &#x27;land&#x27; + &quot;gotłeè&quot; &#x27;its fat&#x27;
*&quot;dǫ łèt&#x27;è&quot; &#x27;bannock&#x27;: &quot;dǫ&quot; &#x27;[Aboriginal] people&#x27; + &quot;łèt&#x27;è&quot; &#x27;bread&#x27;

=== Germanic languages ===
In Germanic languages (including English), compounds are formed by prepending what is effectively a namespace (disambiguation context) to the main word. For example, &quot;football&quot; would be a &quot;ball&quot; in the &quot;foot&quot; context. In itself, this does not alter the meaning of the main word. The added context only makes it more precise. As such, a &quot;football&quot; must be understood as a &quot;ball&quot;. However, as is the case with &quot;football&quot;, a well established compound word may have gained a special meaning in the language&#x27;s vocabulary. Only this defines &quot;football&quot; as a particular type of ball (unambiguously the round object, not the dance party, at that), and also the game involving such a ball. Another example of special and altered meaning is &quot;starfish&quot; – a starfish is in fact not a fish in modern biology. Also syntactically, the compound word behaves like the main word – the whole compound word (or phrase) inherits the word class and inflection rules of the main word. That is to say, since &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;shape&quot; are nouns, &quot;starfish&quot; and &quot;star shape&quot; must also be nouns, and they must take plural forms as &quot;starfish&quot; and &quot;star shapes&quot;, definite singular forms as &quot;the starfish&quot; and &quot;the star shape&quot;, and so on. This principle also holds for languages that express definiteness by inflection (as in North Germanic).

Because a compound is understood as a word in its own right, it may in turn be used in new compounds, so forming an arbitrarily long word is trivial. This contrasts to Romance languages, where prepositions are more used to specify word relationships instead of concatenating the words. As a member of the Germanic family of languages, English is unusual in that compounds are normally written in separate parts. This would be an error in other Germanic languages such as Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, German and Dutch. However, this is merely an orthographic convention: As in other Germanic languages, arbitrary noun phrases, for example &quot;girl scout troop&quot;, &quot;city council member&quot;, and &quot;cellar door&quot;, can be made up on the spot and used as compound nouns in English too.

===Russian language===
In the Russian language compounding is a common type of word formation, and several types of compounds exist, both in terms of compounded parts of speech and of the way of the formation of a compound.

Compound nouns may be agglutinative compounds, hyphenated compounds (стол-книга &#x27;folding table&#x27;, lit. &#x27;table-book&#x27;, &quot;book-like table&quot;), or abbreviated compounds (acronyms: колхоз &#x27;kolkhoz&#x27;). Some compounds look like acronym, while in fact they are an agglutinations of type stem + word: Академгородок &#x27;Akademgorodok&#x27; (from &quot;akademichesky gorodok&quot; &#x27;academic village&#x27;). In agglutinative compound nouns, an agglutinating infix is typically used: пароход &#x27;steamship&#x27;: пар + о + ход. Compound nouns may be created as noun+noun, adjective + noun, noun + adjective (rare), noun + verb (or, rather, noun + verbal noun).

Compound adjectives may be formed either per se (бело-розовый &#x27;white-pink&#x27;) or as a result of compounding during the derivation of an adjective from a multi-word term: Каменноостровский проспект () &#x27;Stone Island Avenue&#x27;, a street in St.Petersburg.

Reduplication in Russian is also a source of compounds.

Quite a few Russian words are borrowed from other languages in an already-compounded form, including numerous &quot;classical compounds&quot; or internationalisms: автомобиль &#x27;automobile&#x27;.

===Sanskrit language===

Sanskrit is very rich in compound formation with seven major compound types and as many as 55 sub-types. The compound formation process is productive, so it is not possible to list all Sanskrit compounds in a dictionary. Compounds of two or three words are more frequent, but longer compounds with some &quot;running through pages&quot; are not rare in Sanskrit literature. Some examples are below (hyphens below show individual word boundaries for ease of reading but are not required in original Sanskrit).
*हिमालय (IAST Himālaya, decomposed as hima-ālaya): Name of the Himalaya mountain range. Literally &quot;the abode of snow&quot;. A compound of two words and four syllables.
*प्रवर-मुकुट-मणि-मरीचि-मञ्जरी-चय-चर्चित-चरण-युगल (IAST pravara-mukuṭa-maṇi-marīci-mañjarī-caya-carcita-caraṇa-yugala): Literally, &quot;O the one whose dual feet are covered by the cluster of brilliant rays from the gems of the best crowns&quot;, from the Sanskrit work Panchatantra. A compound of nine words and 25 syllables.
*कमला-कुच-कुङ्कुम-पिञ्जरीकृत-वक्षः-स्थल-विराजित-महा-कौस्तुभ-मणि-मरीचि-माला-निराकृत-त्रि-भुवन-तिमिर (IAST kamalā-kuca-kuṅkuma-piñjarīkṛta-vakṣaḥ-sthala-virājita-mahā-kaustubha-maṇi-marīci-mālā-nirākṛta-tri-bhuvana-timira): Literally &quot;O the one who dispels the darkness of three worlds by the shine of Kaustubha jewel hanging on the chest, which has been made reddish-yellow by the saffron from the bosom of Kamalā (Lakshmi)&quot;, an adjective of Rama in the Kakabhushundi Rāmāyaṇa. A compound of 16 words and 44 syllables.
*साङ्ख्य-योग-न्याय-वैशेषिक-पूर्व-मीमांसा-वेदान्त-नारद-शाण्डिल्य-भक्ति-सूत्र-गीता-वाल्मीकीय-रामायण-भागवतादि-सिद्धान्त-बोध-पुरः-सर-समधिकृताशेष-तुलसी-दास-साहित्य-सौहित्य-स्वाध्याय-प्रवचन-व्याख्यान-परम-प्रवीणाः (IAST sāṅkhya-yoga-nyāya-vaiśeṣika-pūrva-mīmāṃsā-vedānta-nārada-śāṇḍilya-bhakti-sūtra-gītā-vālmīkīya-rāmāyaṇa-bhāgavatādi-siddhānta-bodha-puraḥ-sara-samadhikṛtāśeṣa-tulasī-dāsa-sāhitya-sauhitya-svādhyāya-pravacana-vyākhyāna-parama-pravīṇāḥ): Literally &quot;the acclaimed forerunner in understanding of the canons of Sāṅkhya, Yoga, Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika, Pūrva Mīmāṃsā, Vedānta, Nārada Bhakti Sūtra, Śāṇḍilya Bhakti Sūtra, Bhagavad Gītā, the Ramayana of Vālmīki, Śrīmadbhāgavata; and the most skilled in comprehensive self-study, discoursing and expounding of the complete works of Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa&quot;. An adjective used in a panegyric of Jagadguru Rambhadracharya. The hyphens show only those word boundaries where there is no sandhi. On including word boundaries with sandhi (vedānta=veda-anta, rāmāyaṇa=rāma-ayana, bhāgavatādi=bhāgavata-ādi, siddhānta=siddha-anta, samadhikṛtāśeṣa=samadhikṛta-aśeṣa, svādhyāya=sva-adhyāya), this is a compound of 35 words and 86 syllables.

=== Sign languages ===
Also in sign languages, compounding is a productive word formation process. Both endocentric and exocentric compounds have been described for a variety of sign languages. Copulative compounds or dvandva, which are composed of two or more nouns from the same semantic category to denote that semantic category, also occur regularly in many sign languages. The sign for &quot;parents&quot; in Italian Sign Language, for instance, is a combination of the nouns &#x27;father&#x27; and &#x27;mother&#x27;. The sign for &quot;breakfast&quot; in American Sign Language follows the same concept. The words &quot;eat&quot; and &quot;morning&quot; are signed together to create a new word meaning breakfast. This is an example of a sequential compound; in sign languages, it is also possible to form &quot;simultaneous&quot; compounds, where one hand represents one lexeme while the other simultaneously represents another lexeme. An example is the sign for &quot;weekend&quot; in Sign Language of the Netherlands, which is produced by simultaneously signing a one-handed version of the sign for &quot;Saturday&quot; and a one-handed version of the sign for &quot;Sunday.&quot; In American Sign Language there is another process easily compared to compounding. Blending is the blending of two morphemes to create a new word called a portmanteau. This is different from compounding in that it breaks the strict linear order of compounding. 

==Recent trends in orthography==
Although there is no universally agreed-upon guideline regarding the use of compound words in the English language, in recent decades written English has displayed a noticeable trend towards increased use of compounds. Recently, many words have been made by taking syllables of words and compounding them, such as pixel (picture element) and bit (binary digit). This is called a syllabic abbreviation.

In Dutch and the Scandinavian languages there is an unofficial trend toward splitting compound words, known in Norwegian as &quot;særskriving&quot;, in Swedish as &quot;särskrivning&quot; (literally &quot;separate writing&quot;), and in Dutch as &quot;Engelse ziekte&quot; (the &quot;English disease&quot;). Because the Dutch language and the Scandinavian languages rely heavily on the distinction between the compound word and the sequence of the separate words it consists of, this has serious implications. For example, the Norwegian adjective &quot;røykfritt&quot; (literally &quot;smokefree&quot;, meaning no smoking allowed) if separated into its composite parts, would mean &quot;røyk fritt&quot; (&quot;smoke freely&quot;). In Dutch, compounds written with spaces may also be confused, but can also be interpreted as a sequence of a noun and a genitive (which is unmarked in Dutch) in formal abbreviated writing. This may lead to, for example, &quot;commissie vergadering&quot; (&quot;commission meeting&quot;) being read as &quot;commission of the meeting&quot; rather than &quot;meeting of the commission&quot; (normally spelled &quot;commissievergadering&quot;).

The German spelling reform of 1996 introduced the option of hyphenating compound nouns when it enhances comprehensibility and readability. This is done mostly with very long compound words by separating them into two or more smaller compounds, like &quot;Eisenbahn-Unterführung&quot; (railway underpass) or &quot;Kraftfahrzeugs-Betriebsanleitung&quot; (car manual). Such practice is also permitted in other Germanic languages, e.g. Danish and Norwegian (Bokmål and Nynorsk alike), and is even encouraged between parts of the word that have very different pronunciation, such as when one part is a loan word or an acronym.

<text>Antal Szerb (1 May 1901, Budapest – 27 January 1945, Balf) was a noted Hungarian scholar and writer. He is generally considered to be one of the major Hungarian writers of the 20th century.

==Life and career==
Szerb was born in 1901 to assimilated Jewish parents in Budapest, but baptized Catholic. He studied Hungarian, German and later English, obtaining a doctorate in 1924. From 1924 to 1929 he lived in France and Italy, also spending a year in London, England, from 1929 to 1930.

As a student, he published essays on Georg Trakl and Stefan George, and quickly established a formidable reputation as a scholar, writing erudite studies of William Blake and Henrik Ibsen among other works. Elected President of the Hungarian Literary Academy in 1933, aged just 32, he published his first novel, &quot;The Pendragon Legend&quot; (which draws upon his personal experience of living in Britain) the following year. His second and best-known work, (&quot;Journey by Moonlight&quot;) came out in 1937. He was made a Professor of Literature at the University of Szeged the same year. He was twice awarded the &quot;Baumgarten Prize&quot;, in 1935 and 1937. Szerb also translated books from English, French, and Italian, including works by Anatole France, P. G. Wodehouse, and Hugh Walpole.

In 1941 he published a &quot;History of World Literature&quot; which continues to be authoritative today. He also published a volume on the theory of the novel and a book about the history of Hungarian literature. Given numerous chances to escape anti-Semitic persecution (as late as 1944), he chose to remain in Hungary, where his last novel, a Pirandellian fantasy about a king staging a coup against himself, then having to impersonate himself, &quot;Oliver VII&quot;, was published in 1942. It was passed off as a translation from the English, as no &#x27;Jewish&#x27; work could be printed at the time.

During the 1940s, Szerb faced increasing hostility due to his Jewish background. In 1943, Szerb&#x27;s &quot;History of World Literature&quot; was put on a list of forbidden works. During the period of Communist rule, it would also be censored, with the chapter on Soviet literature redacted, and the full version would only be available again in 1990. Szerb was deported to a concentration camp in Balf late in 1944. Admirers of his attempted to save him with falsified papers, but Szerb turned them down, wanting to share the fate of his generation. He was beaten to death there in January 1945, at the age of 43. He was survived by his wife, Klára Bálint, who died in 1992.

== Work ==
Szerb is best known for his academic works on literature. In the ten years before the Second World War, he wrote two monumental works of literary criticism, characterized by a brilliant and ironic style intended for an educated reader rather than an academic public.

In addition, Szerb wrote novellas and novels that still attract the attention of the reading public. &quot;The Pendragon Legend&quot;, &quot;Journey by Moonlight&quot; and &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Necklace&quot;, for instance, fuse within the plot the aims of the literary critic with the aims of the novel writer. The author gives importance to the exotic in these novels, with a meta-literary outlook. In these three novels, the stage of the narrative action is always a Western European country: leaving quotidian Hungary allows the writer to transfigure the actions of his characters.

===&quot;The Pendragon Legend&quot;===
In his first novel, &quot;The Pendragon Legend&quot;, Szerb offers to his readers a representation of the United Kingdom and its inhabitants. England and, in particular, London, hosted Szerb for a year and not only suggested to him new and interesting directions for his research, but also offered him the background for his first novel. &quot;The Pendragon Legend&quot; is a detective story that begins in the British Museum and finishes in a Welsh castle. The author provides a non-native&#x27;s look at the country, in a way that is consistent with the parody genre.

In &quot;The Quest for the Miraculous: Survey and Problematic in the Modern Novel&quot;, Szerb claims that among the literary genres he prefers the fantasy novel. It fuses the quotidian details of everyday life with the fantastic feats that he calls “the miracle”. In the case of &quot;The Pendragon Legend&quot;, this allows the reader a cathartic experience through the adventures of the Hungarian philologist who serves as the protagonist of the novel.

=== &quot;Journey by Moonlight&quot; ===
 (literally, &quot;Traveler and Moonlight&quot;), published in 1937, focuses on the development of the main character, Mihály - a bright and romantic, albeit conflicted, young man who sets off for a honeymoon in Italy with his new wife, Erzsi. Mihály quickly reveals his bizarre childhood experiences to her over a bottle of wine, alluding to a set of seemingly unresolved longings for eroticism and death which Erzsi seems to only vaguely comprehend. The plainspoken disharmony between the newlyweds leads to Mihály&#x27;s detached self-recognition: he is not ready to be Erzsi&#x27;s husband. He then leaves his wife for his own journey through the Italian countryside and eventually Rome - figuratively tracing the sparkling fanaticisms of his juvenile imagination, even rekindling bonds with changed (and some unchanged) childhood friends - all among the impressive foreign landscapes and peculiar liveliness of its inhabitants. Szerb celebrates the exotic cult of Italy, the leitmotif of thousands of writers from the past and present, relaying his own travel impressions of Italy through the mind of his eccentric protagonist, Mihály. Szerb explores the altogether interrelatedness of love and youthfulness within bourgeois society.

===&quot;The Third Tower&quot;===
Szerb also published an interesting diary, &quot;The Third Tower&quot;, recounting his travels to the cities in the north of Italy - Venice, Bologna, Ravenna. Before going back home, he visited San Marino, Europe&#x27;s oldest state, and Montale (San Marino) inspired the title of the book. The diary is divided into paragraphs which alternate descriptions with his personal thoughts.

<doc id="887476" wikidata="Q359381" url="?curid=887476" title="Adnan Khashoggi">
<text>Adnan Khashoggi (; 25 July 1935 – 6 June 2017) was a Saudi businessman and arms dealer known for his business dealings, extensive geopolitical influence, and opulent lifestyle, which earned him the moniker &quot;&quot;The Great Gatsby of the Middle East&quot;.&quot; During his peak in the early 1980s, Khashoggi&#x27;s net worth was estimated at around $4 billion, amassed through his pivotal role as an intermediary between Western defense companies and the Saudi government.

Khashoggi was the founder of Triad International Holding Company, which held diverse investments worldwide, including in luxury hotels, oil refineries, and real estate. Known for hosting lavish parties attended by celebrities and politicians, Khashoggi&#x27;s lifestyle made him a media fixture and inspired popular culture, even influencing songs by Queen and appearing in shows like &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Khashoggi was born in Mecca, to Muhammad Khashoggi, who was King Abdul Aziz Al Saud&#x27;s personal doctor, and Samiha Ahmed, a Saudi woman of Syrian origin. Khashoggi&#x27;s sister was author Samira Khashoggi who married businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed and was the mother of Dodi Fayed. Another sister, Soheir Khashoggi, is a well-known Arab novelist (&quot;Mirage&quot;, &quot;Nadia&#x27;s Song&quot;, &quot;Mosaic&quot;). He had two brothers, Essam Khashoggi and Adil Khashoggi, and he named Triad Corporation in reference to himself and his two brothers. He was a paternal uncle of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Khashoggi was educated at Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt, and attended Chico State, Ohio State, and Stanford University. Khashoggi left his studies in order to pursue a business career.

== Personal life ==

In 1961, Khashoggi married 20-year-old Englishwoman, Sandra Daly, who converted to Islam and took the name Soraya Khashoggi. Together they raised one daughter (Nabila) and four sons (Mohamed, Khalid, Hussein, and Omar). They divorced in 1974.

Khashoggi&#x27;s second wife, Italian Laura Biancolini, (m. 1978) also converted to Islam and changed her name to Lamia Khashoggi. She was seventeen when she met Adnan; together they had a son, Ali. Khashoggi was married to Lamia Khashoggi at the time of his death. Adnan&#x27;s third legal wife was Shahpari Azam Zanganeh (m. 1991-2014). Apart from his marriages, Khashoggi also maintained a harem, and it was reported that he had relationships with at least 12 women who were described as his &quot;pleasure wives&quot;. One was Jill Dodd, a former model and fashion designer he met in 1980. Dodd has written a memoir titled &quot;The Currency of Love&quot; about their relationship.

In the 1980s, the Khashoggi family occupied one of the largest villa estates in Marbella, Spain, called &quot;Baraka&quot;, hosting lavish parties. Guests at these parties included film stars, pop celebrities and politicians such as former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau. In 1985, celebrity reporter Robin Leach reported Khashoggi threw a five-day birthday party in Vienna for his eldest son, and in his heyday, Khashoggi spent $250,000 a day to maintain his lifestyle. Due to his extravagant lifestyle, he was called the Great Gatsby of the Middle East.

Another Khashoggi home was Ol Pejeta Conservancy, in Laikipia County, Kenya known at the time as the Mount Kenya Safari Club. His house has since been converted into a hotel which is run by Serena Hotels.

Khashoggi continued to spend lavishly even when he encountered financial problems. His net worth was said to have been down to about $8 million in 1990.

He died on 6 June 2017 while being treated for Parkinson&#x27;s disease at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London. He was 81 years of age.

== Business career ==

Khashoggi&#x27;s early years were spent among some of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s most influential figures. &quot;While attending school he met Hussein bin Talal, the future King of Jordan. It was at school that Khashoggi first learned the commercial value of facilitating a deal, bringing together a Libyan classmate whose father wanted to import towels with an Egyptian classmate whose father manufactured towels, earning US$1,000 for the introduction. Khashoggi&#x27;s subsequent education at university would serve as a launchpad for his commercial career.&quot;

In one of his first big deals, a large construction company was experiencing difficulties with the trucks that it used on the shifting desert sands. Khashoggi, using money given to him by his father for a car, bought a number of Kenworth trucks, whose wide wheels made traversing the desert considerably easier. Khashoggi made his first US$250,000 leasing the trucks to the construction company, and became the Saudi Arabia-based agent for Kenworth.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Khashoggi helped bring together Western companies and the Saudi Arabian government to satisfy its infrastructure and defense needs. Between 1970 and 1975, Lockheed paid Khashoggi $106 million in commissions. His commissions started at 2.5% and eventually rose to as much as 15%. Khashoggi &quot;became for all practical purposes a marketing arm of Lockheed. Khashoggi would provide not only an entrée but strategy, constant advice, and analysis&quot;, according to Max Helzel, then vice president of Lockheed&#x27;s international marketing.

A commercial pioneer, he established companies in Switzerland and Liechtenstein to handle his commissions as well as developing contacts with notables such as CIA officers James H. Critchfield and Kim Roosevelt and United States businessman Bebe Rebozo, a close associate of U.S. President Richard Nixon. His yacht, the &quot;Nabila&quot;, was the largest in the world at the time and was used in the James Bond film &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. After Khashoggi ran into financial problems he sold the yacht to the Sultan of Brunei, who in turn sold it for US$29 million to Donald Trump, who sold it for US$20 million to Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal as part of a deal to keep his Taj Mahal casino out of bankruptcy. Khashoggi gained influence with U.S. President Richard Nixon by donating US$200 million to his 1972 political campaign, through a friendly bank circumventing existing laws that prohibited such large sums from American corporations to political campaigns. Similar arrangements allowed Khashoggi to gain influence with important people throughout the world.
Khashoggi headed a company called Triad International Holding Company which among other things built the Triad Center in Salt Lake City, which later went bankrupt. He was famed as an arms dealer, brokering deals between US firms and the Saudi government, most actively in the 1960s and 1970s. In the documentary series &quot;The Mayfair Set&quot;, Saudi author Said Aburish states that one of Khashoggi&#x27;s first deals was providing David Stirling with weapons for a covert mission in Yemen during the Aden Emergency in 1963. Among his overseas clients were defense contractors Lockheed Corporation (now Lockheed Martin Corporation), Raytheon, Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation and Northrop Corporation (the last two of which have now merged into Northrop Grumman).

=== Triad International ===

Triad International is a multi-national private investment corporation that was owned by Khashoggi. It was named &quot;Triad&quot; after the three brothers, Adnan, Essam and Adil. Its investments include many notable properties and businesses throughout the world. The company consisted of subsidiary companies, including Triad Management, Triad Properties, Triad Energy, Triad Technology, and Triad Financial resources.
The global span of the businesses prompted the creation, by the Khashoggi family, of a board-game called &quot;Triopoly&quot; which was modeled after the classic game of &quot;Monopoly&quot;. The various game tiles represented properties and companies owned by Khashoggi and his Triad corporation. 

Triad International was formed in the early 1960s and as it grew spanned five continents. The company holdings included hotels, shopping centers, banks, oil refineries, a computer manufacturer, a gold mine, construction companies, car and truck franchises, and the Utah Jazz, a professional basketball team. The company was headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, with its subsidiary companies located in the United States, Canada and Saudi Arabia.

Khashoggi, through Triad, owned the Mount Kenya Safari Club, known as Ol Pejeta Conservancy, a several hundred acre reserve at the foot of Mount Kenya, San Francisco Town Center East, US; a US$250 million property; Long Beach Edgington Oil a US$250 million per year oil refinery in the US; ATV computer systems, Santa Ana, Arizona, US; Colorado Land &amp; Cattle company, Security National bank in Walnut Creek, California, US, Barrick gold mine in Toronto, Canada; Saudi Arabian Kenworth, Chrysler and Fiat car and truck dealerships; the National Gypsum company in Saudi Arabia, and Sahuaro Petroleum in Phoenix, Arizona, US.

The company also had major financial interests in Lloyd&#x27;s of London; the Manera company; Las Brisas Resort in Acapulco, Mexico; the Houston Galleria; National car rental company; Pyramid Oasis in Cairo, Egypt; Travel Lodge Australia; Pacific Harbor hotel in Fiji; Beirut Riyadh bank; and the bank of Contra Costa.

Khashoggi&#x27;s Triad real estate holdings included private residences in Beirut; Jeddah; Riyadh; Geneva; Cairo; Salt Lake City, Utah; Cone Ranch, Florida; Rome; Paris; Cannes; London; and a multi-floor penthouse in Olympic Tower in New York.
Khashoggi also owned several private jets, and super-yachts through Triad, including a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 and DC-9, three Boeing 727s, and several smaller business jets and helicopters. His three super-yachts, the &quot;Nabila&quot;, the &quot;Mohammadia&quot;, and the &quot;Khalidia&quot;, were named after his children, Nabila, Mohammed, and Khalid.

== Geopolitical involvement ==
Khashoggi was directly involved in helping to organize and fund the top-secret Operation Moses in 1984 to airlift to safety 14,000 Ethiopian Jews from Sudan to Israel during a famine caused by the Ethiopian Civil War.

Khashoggi was implicated in the Iran–Contra affair as a key middleman in the arms-for-hostages exchange along with Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar and, in a complex series of events, was found to have borrowed money for these arms purchases from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) with Saudi and United States backing. His role in the affair created a related controversy when Khashoggi donated millions to the American University in Washington DC, to build a sports arena which would bear his name. Khashoggi was a member of the university&#x27;s board of trustees from 1983 until his indictment on fraud and other charges in May 1989. Khashoggi was &quot;principal foreign agent&quot; of the United States and helped establish the supranational intelligence partnership known as the Safari Club.

In 1988, Khashoggi was arrested in Switzerland, accused of concealing funds, and held for three months. Khashoggi stopped fighting extradition when the U.S. prosecutors reduced the charges to obstruction of justice and mail fraud and dropped the more serious charges of racketeering and conspiracy. In 1990, a United States federal jury in Manhattan acquitted Khashoggi and Imelda Marcos, widow of the exiled Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, of racketeering and fraud.

Khashoggi was a financier behind Genesis Intermedia, Inc. (formerly NASDAQ: GENI), a publicly traded Internet company based in the US. In 2006, Khashoggi was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for securities fraud. The case was dismissed in 2008 and Khashoggi did not admit or deny the allegations.

In January 2003, Seymour Hersh reported in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine that former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle had a meeting with Khashoggi in Marseille in order to use him as a conduit between Trireme Partners, a private venture capital company of which he was one of three principals, and the Saudi government. At the time, Perle was chair of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, a Defense Department advisory group, which provided him with access to classified information and a position to influence defense policy. Khashoggi told Hersh that Perle talked to him about the economic costs regarding a proposed invasion of Iraq. If there is no war,&#x27; he told me, &#x27;why is there a need for security? If there is a war, of course, billions of dollars will have to be spent.

== Media ==
Khashoggi’s enormous yacht was the inspiration for Queen&#x27;s song &quot;Khashoggi&#x27;s Ship&quot;.

In 1991 Khashoggi made an extended appearance on the British television programme &quot;After Dark&quot;, discussing the Middle East alongside, among others, former Prime Minister Edward Heath and Lord Weidenfeld.

Khashoggi also appeared in &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot; in 1985 with host Robin Leach which showcased Khashoggi&#x27;s extravagant lifestyle.

During his peak, Khashoggi was a well-known figure who frequently appeared in the press and media. He also appeared in various television shows, newspapers, and notable magazine covers such as &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

<text>Ponsworthy is a hamlet on the eastern side of Dartmoor, Devon, England. It lies in the steep valley of the West Webburn River about southwest of the village of Widecombe-in-the-Moor.

Its row of picturesque thatched cottages, climbing up a steep hill, are often the subject of calendars and postcards. It also has a mill and old bakehouse, converted to a house in 1976. Ponsworthy House, built c.1800, has a porch with Doric columns of granite. At the foot of the hill is the ‘Ponsworthy Splash’, where vehicles must drive through a small stream which runs across the road.

The village is also well known for Ponsworthy Bridge over the West Webburn River. It has a single arch and contains a stone engraved with the dates 1666 and 1792 - believed to be when repairs were carried out. It was further repaired in 1911. The bridge has a width restriction, which is one of the reasons the village is so quiet, for it is impassable to modern coaches.

<doc id="887484" wikidata="Q3277394" url="?curid=887484" title="Head (linguistics)">
<text>In linguistics, the head or nucleus of a phrase is the word that determines the syntactic category of that phrase. For example, the head of the noun phrase &quot;boiling hot water&quot; is the noun (head noun) &quot;water&quot;. Analogously, the head of a compound is the stem that determines the semantic category of that compound. For example, the head of the compound noun &quot;handbag&quot; is &quot;bag&quot;, since a handbag is a bag, not a hand. The other elements of the phrase or compound modify the head, and are therefore the head&#x27;s &quot;dependents&quot;. Headed phrases and compounds are called &quot;endocentric&quot;, whereas &quot;exocentric&quot; (&quot;headless&quot;) phrases and compounds (if they exist) lack a clear head. Heads are crucial to establishing the direction of branching. Head-initial phrases are right-branching, head-final phrases are left-branching, and head-medial phrases combine left- and right-branching.

==Basic examples==
Examine the following expressions:

:::big red dog
:::birdsong

The word &quot;dog&quot; is the head of &quot;big red dog&quot; since it determines that the phrase is a noun phrase, not an adjective phrase. Because the adjectives &quot;big&quot; and &quot;red&quot; modify this head noun, they are its &quot;dependents&quot;. Similarly, in the compound noun &quot;birdsong,&quot; the stem &quot;song&quot; is the head since it determines the basic meaning of the compound. The stem &quot;bird&quot; modifies this meaning and is therefore dependent on &quot;song&quot;. &quot;Birdsong&quot; is a kind of song, not a kind of bird. Conversely, a &quot;songbird&quot; is a type of bird since the stem &quot;bird&quot; is the head in this compound. The heads of phrases can often be identified by way of constituency tests. For instance, substituting a single word in place of the phrase &quot;big red dog&quot; requires the substitute to be a noun (or pronoun), not an adjective.

==Representing heads==
===Trees===
Many theories of syntax represent heads by means of tree structures. These trees tend to be organized in terms of one of two relations: either in terms of the &quot;constituency&quot; relation of phrase structure grammars or the &quot;dependency&quot; relation of dependency grammars. Both relations are illustrated with the following trees:

The constituency relation is shown on the left and the dependency relation on the right. The a-trees identify heads by way of category labels, whereas the b-trees use the words themselves as the labels. The noun &quot;stories&quot; (N) is the head over the adjective &quot;funny&quot; (A). In the constituency trees on the left, the noun projects its category status up to the mother node, so that the entire phrase is identified as a noun phrase (NP). In the dependency trees on the right, the noun projects only a single node, whereby this node dominates the one node that the adjective projects, a situation that also identifies the entirety as an NP. The constituency trees are structurally the same as their dependency counterparts, the only difference being that a different convention is used for marking heads and dependents. The conventions illustrated with these trees are just a couple of the various tools that grammarians employ to identify heads and dependents. While other conventions abound, they are usually similar to the ones illustrated here.

===More trees===
The four trees above show a head-final structure. The following trees illustrate head-final structures further as well as head-initial and head-medial structures. The constituency trees (= a-trees) appear on the left, and dependency trees (= b-trees) on the right. Henceforth the convention is employed where the words appear as the labels on the nodes. The next four trees are additional examples of head-final phrases:

The following six trees illustrate head-initial phrases:

And the following six trees are examples of head-medial phrases:

The head-medial constituency trees here assume a more traditional n-ary branching analysis. Since some prominent phrase structure grammars (e.g. most work in Government and binding theory and the Minimalist Program) take all branching to be binary, these head-medial a-trees may be controversial.

===X-bar trees===
Trees that are based on the X-bar schema also acknowledge head-initial, head-final, and head-medial phrases, although the depiction of heads is less direct. The standard X-bar schema for English is as follows:

This structure is both head-initial and head-final, which makes it head-medial in a sense. It is head-initial insofar as the head X0 precedes its complement, but it is head-final insofar as the projection X&#x27; of the head follows its specifier.

==Head-initial vs. head-final languages==
Some language typologists classify language syntax according to a head directionality parameter in word order, that is, whether a phrase is &quot;head-initial&quot; (= right-branching) or &quot;head-final&quot; (= left-branching), assuming that it has a fixed word order at all. English is more head-initial than head-final, as illustrated with the following dependency tree of the first sentence of Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;:

The tree shows the extent to which English is primarily a head-initial language. On the broadest level, the verb phrase &quot;discovered that he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug&quot; begins with the verb headword &quot;discovered&quot;. Structure is descending as speech and processing move (visually in writing) from left to right. Most dependencies have the head preceding its dependent(s), although there are also head-final dependencies in the tree. For instance, the determiner-noun and adjective-noun dependencies are head-final as well as the subject-verb dependencies. Most other dependencies in English are, however, head-initial as the tree shows. The mixed nature of head-initial and head-final structures is common across languages. In fact purely head-initial or purely head-final languages probably do not exist, although there are some languages that approach purity in this respect, for instance Japanese.

The following tree is of the same sentence from Kafka&#x27;s story. The glossing conventions are those established by Lehmann. One can easily see the extent to which Japanese is head-final:

A large majority of head-dependent orderings in Japanese are head-final. This fact is obvious in this tree, since structure is strongly ascending as speech and processing move from left to right. Thus the word order of Japanese is in a sense the opposite of English.

==Head-marking vs. dependent-marking==
It is also common to classify language morphology according to whether a phrase is head-marking or dependent-marking. A given dependency is head-marking, if something about the dependent influences the form of the head, and a given dependency is dependent-marking, if something about the head influences the form of the dependent.

For instance, in the English possessive case, possessive marking (&quot;″s&quot;) appears on the dependent (the possessor), whereas in Hungarian possessive marking appears on the head noun:
==Prosodic head==
In a prosodic unit, the head is the part that extends from the first stressed syllable up to (but not including) the tonic syllable. A high head is the stressed syllable that begins the head and is high in pitch, usually higher than the beginning pitch of the tone on the tonic syllable. For example:

The ↑bus was late.

A low head is the syllable that begins the head and is low in pitch, usually lower than the beginning pitch of the tone on the tonic syllable.

The ↓bus was late.

<text>Senses Fail is an American rock band formed in Ridgewood, New Jersey, in 2001. Founded by vocalist Buddy Nielsen, drummer Dan Trapp, guitarists Garrett Zablocki and Dave Miller, and bassist James Gill (replaced by Mike Glita shortly after); the band has seen many lineup changes, with Nielsen being the only consistent member. The band has released eight studio albums, two EPs, and one live album. Discovered by their first manager, Heath Miller of Excess dB Entertainment, booked them on a show opening for Catch 22 at Rexplex, where the owners of Drive Thru Records saw them live for the first time and offered to sign them on November 30, 2002.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;From the Depths of Dreams&quot; EP (2001–2003)===

Senses Fail&#x27;s beginnings started in October 2001 after James &quot;Buddy&quot; Nielsen posted an advertisement on the Internet to recruit members for the band. The advertisement attracted attention from Garrett Zablocki, who then began writing with Nielsen. Later Zablocki contacted Dave Miller to join the band who also brought along his friend, James Gill. After a short time with another drummer the band came across Dan Trapp, who was only 14-years-old at the time. Before the band signed to Drive-Thru Records, James Gill was kicked out of the band due to irreconcilable differences; he was replaced by former Tokyo Rose drummer Mike Glita.

Nielsen explained the band name, stating: &quot;In Hinduism, they believe that being alive is hell, and the only way to reach Nirvana is to ultimately have no attachments to anything. So, people go out and live in the middle of the woods and they don&#x27;t eat and don&#x27;t drink. They just meditate because they&#x27;ve reached such a high level where they&#x27;re not attached to love, relationships or anything. And if you want to reach the highest level of being and see God, you have to have all your senses fail.&quot;

Building a local fan base by playing any gig they could find from skate parks and clubs to churches, they soon entered the studio and started to record. Their first release, &quot;From the Depths of Dreams&quot;, was a six-track EP that was originally released on ECA Records on August 16, 2002. It originally started as two three-song demo CDs, but was later joined together to make one release by producer John Naclerio. The independent release did very well and caught the attention of some record labels. They signed to Drive-Thru Records, and reissued their EP on April 29, 2003, with two extra tracks, remastering, and new cover art. The b-side &quot;Bastard Son&quot; was also recorded during this time. The release saw much success, and sold enough copies to peak at No. 144 on the Billboard chart. In support of the EP, Senses Fail toured with such bands as The Used, Millencolin, The Starting Line, and Drive-Thru labelmates Finch.

===&quot;Let It Enfold You&quot; (2004–2005)===

Senses Fail started working on their debut album, &quot;Let It Enfold You&quot; in April 2003. During this time, lead singer and songwriter Buddy Nielsen was 18–19 years old. They worked with producer Steve Evetts (Saves the Day, A Static Lullaby, Every Time I Die) on their new label Vagrant Records. The lyrics were derived from a wide variety of sources. The title of the album was taken from a poem written by Charles Bukowski, the song &quot;Irony of Dying on Your Birthday&quot; is about the work of mythologist Joseph Campbell, and parts of the song &quot;Slow Dance&quot; include lines of the Dao De Jing. Nielsen stated that, &quot;We just love making music and writing good songs. I feel like I&#x27;ve got a lot more to say and we&#x27;ve got a lot more to contribute. But even if things ended tomorrow, we&#x27;ve gotten 10 times further than we ever expected to get and that makes us feel like we&#x27;ve succeeded regardless of what happens from here on.&quot; &quot;Let It Enfold You&quot; was released on September 7, 2004, on Vagrant and Drive Thru Records. The album was certified gold by the RIAA, and has sold over 600,000 copies worldwide.

&quot;Let It Enfold You&quot; saw the release of two singles: &quot;Buried a Lie&quot; and &quot;Rum Is for Drinking, Not for Burning.&quot; The music video for &quot;Buried a Lie&quot; was filmed on the set of the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. Nielsen&#x27;s mother, who shot the video, used to act in the show. The release of the video started attracting mainstream success for the band. During this period, Senses Fail were featured in magazines such as &quot;Kerrang!,&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone,&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; and appeared on the cover of &quot;Alternative Press.&quot;

The band toured extensively in support of the release. They participated in the Vans Warped Tour in 2004, 2005, and 2006, and 2009. 

In 2005, the band&#x27;s web site announced the departure, by mutual agreement, of guitarist Dave Miller. He was replaced by Heath Saraceno, previously the guitarist and vocalist of the band Midtown. Miller started his own record label called DMI (Dave Miller Industries) in September 2006.

The song &quot;Lady in a Blue Dress,&quot; from this album, was released as a downloadable track on the Rock Band Network on March 4, 2010.

===&quot;Still Searching&quot; (2006–2007)===

After taking a break from touring, and acquiring a new lineup, Senses Fail began to write their second studio album. The new album, titled &quot;Still Searching&quot; was produced by Brian McTernan (Thrice, Cave In) and mixed by Chris Lord-Alge. This album eased up on the aggression on previous albums and showed more emotion. On the subject of the new songs, Nielsen explained, &quot;I like my lyrics to be open to interpretation, but I didn&#x27;t want to paint pictures of things no one was going to understand; I want our fans to be able to relate. At some point, we all start examining our lives. If you don&#x27;t, there&#x27;s something wrong with you.&quot;

In support of the new album, the band toured on the Taste of Chaos again. In 2006 they toured with the Taste of Chaos International, and in 2007 Senses Fail returned to North America for the 2007 Taste of Chaos tour. In the summer of 2007 they also participated in a few dates of the Zumiez Couch Tour alongside From Autumn to Ashes. They headlined in late 2006 with Saosin and Bleeding Through as supporters. On October 5, 2007, Senses Fail began a 33-city co-headlining tour with New Found Glory which started in Las Vegas, Nevada. Also on the tour was Set Your Goals. The tour ended on November 24, 2007, in San Diego, California.

On November 13, 2007, Senses Fail released a deluxe version of &quot;Still Searching,&quot; which featured new art, behind-the-scenes DVD featuring footage from the band&#x27;s headlining tour last fall, two new songs, three b-sides, and a cover of The Cranberries&#x27; song &quot;Salvation.&quot;
On December 8, 2007, bassist Mike Glita left the band to pursue his side project Knights In Paris. Jason Black joined as a temporary replacement, though he later became a permanent member.

===&quot;Life Is Not a Waiting Room&quot; (2008–2009)===

The band&#x27;s third full-length album &quot;Life Is Not a Waiting Room&quot; was released on October 7, 2008 through Vagrant Records, followed by the beginning of a nationwide tour the day after.
On November 21, Senses Fail did an online interview with Ultimate Guitar, talking about the evolution of the band, their new bassist and the album.

On June 30, 2009, it was announced that guitarist Heath Saraceno would be leaving the band after the 2009 Warped Tour, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve shared many great times with these guys over the past four years or so. We&#x27;ve made two records I&#x27;m very proud of, toured the world and the States countless times, and I&#x27;ve made friends with people I would not have met otherwise. These guys from Jersey (and Atlanta by way of Florida) have turned into some of my closest friends, and I will miss seeing them as often as I&#x27;ve been able to.&quot; He was replaced by Zack Roach.

===&quot;The Fire&quot; (2010)===

The band began recording their new album, titled The Fire, at Salad Days Studio with Brian McTernan in June 2010 hoping to release later that year. &quot;The Fire&quot; was released in the UK on October 25, 2010, through Hassle Records and elsewhere on October 26 through Vagrant Records to generally positive reviews. The album does not feature Zack Roach on guitar, replacing Heath Saraceno after leaving in 2009, but instead has Garrett Zablocki playing both guitar roles. In February 2011, Garrett Zablocki left the band to attend college; however, he will be composing music for various films and videos.

Senses Fail went on tour with Stick to Your Guns, Make Do and Mend, and The Story So Far in November 2011. The band then released &quot;The Fire&quot; on vinyl through Mightier Than Sword Records.

Senses Fail played again on the 2012 Vans Warped Tour. They released a greatest hits album entitled &quot;Follow Your Bliss: The Best of Senses Fail&quot; which featured music from all of their previous albums and came with an added four-track EP of new songs. The album was released on June 19, 2012, in a double-CD package and it is limited to 10,000 copies.

===&quot;Renacer&quot; (2013–2014)===

Senses stated that they would record their fifth full-length album in Los Angeles, California with producer Shaun Lopez at The Airport Studio and Red Bull Studio. The resulting album, &quot;Renacer&quot;, was released on March 26, 2013. The album spawned the singles &quot;Mi Amor&quot; and &quot;The Path&quot;. 

Senses Fail embarked on a 10th Anniversary tour for &quot;Let It Enfold You&quot;, playing the album in full. ex-Poison the Well drummer and current Big Black Delta live drummer Chris Hornbrook replaced Dan Trapp on drums.

===&quot;Pull the Thorns from Your Heart&quot;, touring replacements, side projects (2014–2016)===

In 2014, on their tumblr blog the band announced they signed to Pure Noise Records. Senses Fail would enter the studio in November to start recording their next full-length album which was scheduled to be released in summer 2015. It was later announced that the album would be titled &quot;Pull the Thorns from Your Heart&quot;.

On February 2, 2015, the band released a tease of their split EP on their Facebook. The EP was released on March 3, 2015. &quot;Pull the Thorns from Your Heart&quot; was released on June 30, 2015. The touring cycle for the record kicked off by playing the entirety of the 2015 Vans Warped Tour. The band then embarked on a winter co-headlining tour with Silverstein. On this tour, guitarist Matt Smith was absent due to the birth of his first child. Greg Styliades, who had previously toured with the band after Zack Roach returned home for the birth of his child, performed with the band on this tour. At this time, the band was classified by AbsolutePunk as screamo and &quot;alternative&quot;.

===&quot;In Your Absence&quot;, Quince Años Tour and &quot;If There Is Light, It Will Find You&quot; (2016–2019)===

On November 15, 2016, the band announced that in celebration of its upcoming fifteenth anniversary, they would be embarking on the Quince Años Tour in March and April 2017, with support from Counterparts, Movements, and Like Pacific. To commemorate the event, the band performed its 2006 album &quot;Still Searching&quot; in full, alongside a collection of career spanning songs.

On the same day, the band announced the release of their long teased acoustic EP, &quot;In Your Absence&quot;. 

The band entered the studio with Saosin guitarist Beau Burchell, who also handled recording duties on &quot;In Your Absence&quot;, to begin recording their seventh full-length album on June 27, 2017, to be titled &quot;If There Is Light, It Will Find You&quot;. Nielsen commented that the album would feature a style more akin to earlier releases, such as &quot;Let It Enfold You&quot;. The album was written entirely by Nielsen.

On August 2, it was revealed that former drummer Dan Trapp would be performing drums on the album, although current drummer Chris Hornbrook would still be performing and touring with the band. However, on January 8, 2018, Hornbrook announced his departure from the band. Hornbrook had been touring with Dhani Harrison during the recording sessions. On February 1, 2018, Steve Carey of The Color Morale was announced as the band&#x27;s new drummer, following the announcement that The Color Morale would be entering a hiatus.

===&quot;Hell Is in Your Head&quot; (2020–present)===
In January 2020, Senses Fail announced that they had begun recording their eighth record, tentatively titled &quot;Hell Is In Your Head&quot;, and that it would follow the character from &quot;Still Searching&quot; after the events of the song &quot;The Priest and the Matador.&quot; In March, they updated the working title to &quot;What the Thunder Said, Hell Is in Your Head.&quot;

On February 17, 2021, the band released &quot;Lush Rimbaugh,&quot; coinciding with the death of conservative news pundit Rush Limbaugh. On August 18, a second single titled &quot;Death by Water&quot; was released alongside a music video, and featured Ice Nine Kills vocalist Spencer Charnas.
