<text>U.S. Route 51 or U.S. Highway 51 (US 51) is a major south–north United States highway that extends from the western suburbs of New Orleans, Louisiana, to within of the Wisconsin–Michigan state line. As most of the United States Numbered Highways ending with &quot;1&quot;, it is a cross-country north–south route extending from the Gulf Coast region to the Great Lakes region. Much of the highway in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin runs parallel to or is cosigned with Interstate 39 (I-39) and much of the route in several states also parallels the Illinois Central Railroad. From LaPlace, Louisiana, Mississippi, to Memphis, Tennessee, much of that portion of US 51 runs largely parallel or is concurrent with Interstate 55 (I-55). The highway&#x27;s northern terminus is between Hurley, Wisconsin, and Ironwood, Michigan, where it ends with a roundabout at US 2. Its southern terminus is in Laplace, Louisiana, ending at US 61. US 51 is routed through the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, and Wisconsin.

In addition to singing about US 61 on his album &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;, musician Bob Dylan also commemorated US 51, covering the folk song &quot;Highway 51 Blues&quot;, earlier recorded by both Curtis Jones and Tommy McClennan, on his eponymous album &quot;Bob Dylan&quot;. The North Mississippi Allstars also paid tribute to the highway in the title track of their album &quot;51 Phantom&quot;.

In Memphis, Tennessee, all of US 51 south of South Parkway East was renamed from Bellevue Boulevard to Elvis Presley Boulevard on January 17, 1972. Graceland is located on this section of the highway, in the subdivision of Whitehaven.

In 2004, the six states that US 51 traverses banded together as the &quot;Explore Hwy 51 Coalition&quot; to help promote this &quot;All-American Road&quot;. The group now offers visitor information for traveling the length of the road.

==Route description==
===Louisiana===
US 51 begins at the intersection with US 61 in Laplace and heads northeast. It intersects I-10 before running concurrently with I-55. Near the interchange with I-12, the route splits from I-55. It intersects US 190 in Hammond and remains running parallel with I-55 before entering Mississippi. In the 1930s, this highway was called Jefferson Davis Highway.

===Mississippi===

US 51 enters Mississippi from Louisiana in Osyka and runs parallel with I-55. It intersects US 98 in McComb and US 84 south of Brookhaven. Northwest of Crystal Springs, it runs concurrently with I-55 and then splits at the interchange with I-20 in Jackson. The highway then runs through Jackson, intersecting US 80. Outside Ridgeland, it passes under I-55 as it continues northeast. It continues through Canton, Pickens, Goodman, and Durant. The highway continues to run along I-55, intersecting US 82 in Winona and US 278 in Batesville. The route passes under I-69 before entering Tennessee.

The Mississippi section of US 51 is defined at Mississippi Code Annotated § 65-3-3.

===Tennessee===

US 51 enters Tennessee from Mississippi and travels through Memphis. It intersects I-55 and then I-240 before intersecting US 78. It then runs concurrently with US 79 before intersecting I-69. As it exits Memphis, it intersects I-40 and heads northeasterly. In Dyersburg, it runs concurrently with US 412 for a half a mile before intersecting I-155&#x27;s eastern terminus. US 51 then continues northeasterly before entering Kentucky. US 51 between Memphis and Kentucky is planned on running concurrently with I-69.

===Kentucky===

US 51 enters Kentucky at Fulton, running concurrently with I-69 and continues northward through the towns of Clinton, Bardwell and Wickliffe to the Ohio River. The route intersects and runs concurrently with US 62 before separating from it in Cairo. Along the way it also intersects US 60. The route then enters Illinois before running concurrently with I-57.

===Illinois===

US 51 enters Illinois from Kentucky at the city of Cairo. The route heads northward to a village near Cairo called Mounds, and shares the pavement with I-57, following it for to Dongola, before splitting and heading north. The route remains two lanes from Dongola to just before Assumption with the exception of a section between Centralia and I-64.

North of Assumption, US 51 becomes an expressway to Decatur. In Decatur, US 51 follows I-72 to bypass town. US 51 leaves I-72 after , and heads north to Bloomington–Normal as an expressway. At Bloomington–Normal, US 51 follows I-74 for a mile, then I-55 for , before following I-39 for .

US 51 follows I-39, intersecting I-80 and I-88 along the way. The highway also follows US 20 south of Rockford (while still following I-39). I-39/US 51 joins I-90, making US 51 one of the only toll roads in Illinois that is a U.S. Highway. US 51 exits I-39/I-90 just a mile south of the Wisconsin state line. US 51 follows Illinois Route 75 (IL 75) west to the intersection of IL 251, then turns north through South Beloit to enter Wisconsin.

===Wisconsin===
In the state of Wisconsin, US 51 enters from Illinois at Beloit. US 51 splits off from I-39/I-90 in South Beloit, Illinois, and continues northward through Janesville and Edgerton. In Edgerton, US 51 rejoins I-39/I-90 for before splitting off towards Stoughton and McFarland. US 51 runs almost parallel to I-39/I-90 through the eastern portion of Madison, crosses the Interstate in DeForest, and finally rejoins I-39 again at Portage. US 51 runs concurrently with I-39 until I-39&#x27;s terminus in Wausau and continues on as a mixture of freeway and expressway until just north of the interchange with US 8. From there through Hazelhurst, US 51 is a two-lane road with sporadic three-lane sections (which were constructed in 2008). US 51 expands to four lanes, with a central fifth turn lane from Hazelhurst to Arbor Vitae; north of Arbor Vitae it returns to two lanes and continues to its northern end in Hurley, where it terminates at US 2.

<text>Hypnagogia is the transitional state from wakefulness to sleep, also defined as the waning state of consciousness during the onset of sleep. Its corresponding state is &quot;hypnopompia&quot; sleep to wakefulness. Mental phenomena that may occur during this &quot;threshold consciousness&quot; include hallucinations, lucid dreaming, and sleep paralysis.

== Etymology ==
In 1848, Alfred Maury introduced the term &quot;hypnagogic&quot; from the Greek words ύπνος (“hypnos”), meaning “sleep”, and αγωγός (“agōgos”), meaning “conductor” or “leader”. Later, in 1904, Frederic Myers coined the term &quot;hypnopompic,&quot; with its word-ending originating from the Greek word &quot;pompos,&quot; meaning &quot;sender.&quot;

==Definitions==
The word &quot;hypnagogia&quot; is sometimes used in a restricted sense to refer to the onset of sleep, and contrasted with &quot;hypnopompia&quot;, Frederic Myers&#x27;s term for waking up. However, &quot;hypnagogia&quot; is also regularly employed in a more general sense that covers both falling asleep and waking up. Indeed, it is not always possible in practice to assign a particular episode of any given phenomenon to one or the other, given that the same kinds of experience may occur in both as people drift in and out of sleep.

Other terms for hypnagogia, in one or both senses, that have been proposed include &quot;presomnal&quot; or &quot;anthypnic sensations&quot;, &quot;visions of half-sleep&quot;, &quot;oneiragogic images&quot; and &quot;phantasmata&quot;, &quot;the borderland of sleep&quot;, &quot;praedormitium&quot;, &quot;borderland state&quot;, &quot;half-dream state&quot;, &quot;pre-dream condition&quot;, &quot;sleep onset dreams&quot;, &quot;dreamlets&quot;, and &quot;wakefulness-sleep transition&quot; (WST).

Threshold consciousness (commonly called &quot;half-asleep&quot; or &quot;half-awake&quot;, or &quot;mind awake body asleep&quot;) describes the same mental state of someone who is moving towards sleep or wakefulness but has not yet completed the transition. Such transitions are usually brief but can be extended by sleep disturbance or deliberate induction, for example during meditation.

==Signs and symptoms==
Transition to and from sleep may be attended by a wide variety of sensory experiences. These can occur in any modality, individually or combined, and range from the vague and barely perceptible to vivid hallucinations.

===Sights===
Among the more commonly reported, and more thoroughly researched, sensory features of hypnagogia are phosphenes which can manifest as seemingly random speckles, lines or geometrical patterns, including form constants, or as figurative (representational) images. They may be monochromatic or richly coloured, still or moving, flat or three-dimensional (offering an impression of perspective). Imagery representing movement through tunnels of light is also reported. Individual images are typically fleeting and given to very rapid changes. They are said to differ from dreams proper in that hypnagogic imagery is usually static and lacking in narrative content, although others understand the state rather as a gradual transition from hypnagogia to fragmentary dreams, i.e., from simple &quot;Eigenlicht&quot; to whole imagined scenes. Descriptions of exceptionally vivid and elaborate hypnagogic visuals can be found in the work of Marie-Jean-Léon, Marquis d&#x27;Hervey de Saint Denys.

===&quot;Tetris&quot; effect===
People who have spent a long time at some repetitive activity before sleep, in particular one that is new to them, may find that it dominates their imagery as they grow drowsy, a tendency dubbed the &quot; Tetris&quot; effect. This effect has even been observed in amnesiacs who otherwise have no memory of the original activity. When the activity involves moving objects, as in the video game &quot;Tetris&quot;, the corresponding hypnagogic images tend to be perceived as moving. The &quot;Tetris&quot; effect is not confined to visual imagery but can manifest in other modalities. For example, Robert Stickgold recounts having experienced the touch of rocks while falling asleep after mountain climbing. This can also occur to people who have travelled on a small boat in rough seas or have been swimming through waves, shortly before going to bed, and they feel the waves as they drift to sleep, or people who have spent the day skiing who continue to &quot;feel snow&quot; under their feet. People who have spent considerable time jumping on a trampoline will find that they can feel the up-and-down motion before they go to sleep. New employees working stressful and demanding jobs often report feeling the experience of performing work-related tasks in this period before sleep.

===Sounds===
Hypnagogic hallucinations are often auditory or have an auditory component. Like the visuals, hypnagogic sounds vary in intensity from faint impressions to loud noises, like knocking and crashes and bangs (exploding head syndrome). People may imagine their own name called, crumpling bags, white noise, or a doorbell ringing. Snatches of imagined speech are common. While typically nonsensical and fragmented, these speech events can occasionally strike the individual as apt comments on—or summations of—their thoughts at the time. They often contain word play, neologisms and made-up names. Hypnagogic speech may manifest as the subject&#x27;s own &quot;inner voice&quot;, or as the voices of others: familiar people or strangers. More rarely, poetry or music is heard.

===Other sensations===
Gustatory, olfactory and thermal sensations in hypnagogia have all been reported, as well as tactile sensations (including those kinds classed as paresthesia or formication). Sometimes there is synesthesia; many people report seeing a flash of light or some other visual image in response to a real sound. Proprioceptive effects may be noticed, with numbness and changes in perceived body size and proportions, feelings of floating or bobbing as if their bed were a boat, and out-of-body experiences. Perhaps the most common experience of this kind is the falling sensation, and associated hypnic jerk, encountered by many people, at least occasionally, while drifting off to sleep.

===Cognitive and affective phenomena===
Thought processes on the edge of sleep tend to differ radically from those of ordinary wakefulness. For example, something that one agreed with while in a state of hypnagogia may seem completely ridiculous while in a waking state. Hypnagogia may involve a &quot;loosening of ego boundaries ... openness, sensitivity, internalization-subjectification of the physical and mental environment (empathy) and diffuse-absorbed attention.&quot; Hypnagogic cognition, in comparison with that of normal, alert wakefulness, is characterized by heightened suggestibility, illogic and a fluid association of ideas. Subjects are more receptive in the hypnagogic state to suggestion from an experimenter than at other times, and readily incorporate external stimuli into hypnagogic trains of thought and subsequent dreams. This receptivity has a physiological parallel; EEG readings show elevated responsiveness to sound around the onset of sleep.

Herbert Silberer described a process he called &quot;autosymbolism&quot;, whereby hypnagogic hallucinations seem to represent, without repression or censorship, whatever one is thinking at the time, turning abstract ideas into a concrete image, which may be perceived as an apt and succinct representation thereof.

The hypnagogic state can provide insight into a problem, the best-known example being August Kekulé’s realization that the structure of benzene was a closed ring while half-asleep in front of a fire and seeing molecules forming into snakes, one of which formed an ourobouros. Many other artists, writers, scientists and inventors – including Beethoven, Richard Wagner, Walter Scott, Salvador Dalí, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla and Isaac Newton – have credited hypnagogia and related states with enhancing their creativity. A 2001 study by Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett found that, while problems can also be solved in full-blown dreams from later stages of sleep, hypnagogia was especially likely to solve problems which benefit from hallucinatory images being critically examined while still before the eyes.

A feature that hypnagogia shares with other stages of sleep is amnesia. But this is a selective forgetfulness, affecting the hippocampal memory system, which is responsible for episodic or autobiographical memory, rather than the neocortical memory system, responsible for semantic memory. It has been suggested that hypnagogia and REM sleep help in the consolidation of semantic memory, but the evidence for this has been disputed. In particular, suppression of REM sleep due to antidepressants and lesions to the brainstem has not been found to produce detrimental effects on cognition.

Hypnagogic phenomena may be interpreted as visions, prophecies, premonitions, apparitions and inspiration (artistic or divine), depending on the experiencers&#x27; beliefs and those of their culture.

==Physiology==
Physiological studies have tended to concentrate on hypnagogia in the strict sense of spontaneous sleep onset experiences. Such experiences are associated especially with stage 1 of NREM sleep, but may also occur with pre-sleep alpha waves. Davis et al. found short flashes of dreamlike imagery at the onset of sleep to correlate with drop-offs in alpha EEG activity. Hori et al. regard sleep onset hypnagogia as a state distinct from both wakefulness and sleep with unique electrophysiological, behavioral and subjective characteristics, while Germaine et al. have demonstrated a resemblance between the EEG power spectra of spontaneously occurring hypnagogic images, on the one hand, and those of both REM sleep and relaxed wakefulness, on the other.

To identify more precisely the nature of the EEG state which accompanies imagery in the transition from wakefulness to sleep, Hori et al. proposed a scheme of 9 EEG stages defined by varying proportions of alpha (stages 1–3), suppressed waves of less than 20μV (stage 4), theta ripples (stage 5), proportions of sawtooth waves (stages 6–7), and presence of spindles (stages 8–9). Germaine and Nielsen found spontaneous hypnagogic imagery to occur mainly during Hori sleep onset stages 4 (EEG flattening) and 5 (theta ripples).

The &quot;covert-rapid-eye-movement&quot; hypothesis proposes that hidden elements of REM sleep emerge during the wakefulness-sleep transition stage.
Support for this comes from Bódicz et al., who notes a greater similarity between WST (wakefulness-sleep transition) EEG and REM sleep EEG than between the former and stage 2 sleep.

Respiratory pattern changes have also been noted in the hypnagogic state, in addition to a lowered rate of frontalis muscle activity.

===Daydreaming and waking reveries===
Microsleep (short episodes of immediate sleep onset) may intrude into wakefulness at any time in the wakefulness-sleep cycle, due to sleep deprivation and other conditions, resulting in impaired cognition and even amnesia.

In his book, &quot;Zen and the Brain&quot;, James H. Austin cites speculation that regular meditation develops a specialized skill of &quot;freezing the hypnagogic process at later and later stages&quot; of the onset of sleep, initially in the alpha wave stage and later in theta.

==History==
Early references to hypnagogia can be found in the writings of Aristotle, Iamblichus, Cardano, Simon Forman, and Swedenborg. Romanticism brought a renewed interest in the subjective experience of the edges of sleep. In more recent centuries, many authors have referred to the state; Edgar Allan Poe, for example, wrote of the &quot;fancies&quot; he experienced &quot;only when I am on the brink of sleep, with the consciousness that I am so.&quot;

In Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; there is a pair of episodes, one that portrays the title character experiencing a hypnopompic state, which precedes the following episode, which describes him in a hypnagogic state:
There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure. … It is an undoubted fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead, yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the mere silent presence of some external object; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes: and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness.”

Serious scientific inquiry began in the 19th century with Johannes Peter Müller, Jules Baillarger, and Alfred Maury, and continued into the 20th century with Leroy.

Francis Galton in his &quot;The Visions of Sane Persons&quot; (1881), wrote:

: [B]efore I thought of carefully trying, I should have emphatically declared that my field of view in the dark was essentially of a uniform black, subject to an occasional light-purple cloudiness and other small variations. Now, however, after habituating myself to examine it with the same sort of strain that one tries to decipher a sign-post in the dark, I have found out that this is by no means the case, but that a kaleidoscopic change of patterns and forms is continually going on, but they are too fugitive and elaborate for me to draw with any approach to truth.

Maria Mikhaĭlovna Manaseina wrote “that for these phenomena to attract attention a certain power of observation is required; that is why they are chiefly found in intelligent persons.” Manaseina also noted that children are more likely to take interest in them: “[M]any children are accustomed to press their heads into the pillow and adopt an attitude of expectant attention towards the visions that then begin to form…&quot;

Havelock Ellis later recalled such a childhood interest in these visions:

: I should myself be inclined to deny that I had ever had any such visionary faculty [for hypnagogic hallucination] if it were not that I can recall one occasion of its presence, at about the age of seven, when sleeping with a cousin of the same age; we amused ourselves by burying our heads in the pillows and watching a connected series of pictures which we were both alike able to see, each announcing any change in the picture as soon as it took place.

The advent of electroencephalography (EEG) supplemented the introspective methods of these early researchers with physiological data. The search for neural correlates for hypnagogic imagery began with Davis &quot;et al.&quot; in the 1930s, and continues with increasing sophistication. While the dominance of the behaviorist paradigm led to a decline in research, especially in the English speaking world, the later twentieth century has seen a revival, with investigations of hypnagogia and related altered states of consciousness playing an important role in the emerging multidisciplinary study of consciousness.
 Nevertheless, much remains to be understood about the experience and its corresponding neurology, and the topic has been somewhat neglected in comparison with sleep and dreams; hypnagogia has been described as a &quot;well-trodden and yet unmapped territory&quot;.

Important reviews of the scientific literature have been made by Ghibellini &amp; Meier, Leaning, Schacter, Richardson and Mavromatis.

==Research==
Self-observation (spontaneous or systematic) was the primary tool of the early researchers. Since the late 20th century, this has been joined by questionnaire surveys and experimental studies. All three methods have their disadvantages as well as points to recommend them.

Naturally, amnesia contributes to the difficulty of studying hypnagogia, as does the typically fleeting nature of hypnagogic experiences. These problems have been tackled by experimenters in several ways, including voluntary or induced interruptions, sleep manipulation, the use of techniques to &quot;hover on the edge of sleep&quot; thereby extending the duration of the hypnagogic state, and training in the art of introspection to heighten the subject&#x27;s powers of observation and attention.

Techniques for extending hypnagogia range from informal (e.g. the subject holds up one of their arms as they go to sleep, to be awakened when it falls), to the use of biofeedback devices to induce a &quot;theta&quot; state – produced naturally the most when we are dreaming – characterized by relaxation and theta EEG activity.

Another method is to induce a state said to be subjectively similar to sleep onset in a Ganzfeld setting, a form of sensory deprivation. But the assumption of identity between the two states may be unfounded. The average EEG spectrum in Ganzfeld is more similar to that of the relaxed waking state than to that of sleep onset. Wackerman et al. conclude that &quot;the Ganzfeld imagery, although subjectively very similar to that at sleep onset, should not be labelled as &#x27;hypnagogic&#x27;. Perhaps a broader category of &#x27;hypnagogic experience&#x27; should be considered, covering true hypnagogic imagery as well as subjectively similar imagery produced in other states.&quot;

<text>The Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec (FTQ; Quebec Federation of Labour) is the largest labour federation in Quebec in terms of its membership. It has over 500,000 members, who account for 44% of the unionised workers in Quebec. This ratio is 60% in the private sector, in which most members work. It also has many members in government agencies.
It was established in 1957 through the merger of two longstanding unions: the Fédération provinciale du travail du Québec (Quebec Provincial Labour Federation) and the Fédération des unions industrielles du Québec (Federation of Quebec Industrial Unions). The organization was primarily developed under the leadership of Louis Laberge from 1964 to 1991, with support from American unions concerned about the potential relocation of industry to Canada.

The FTQ is unusual among labour unions in that it founded (in 1983) and controls a capital investment fund called &quot;Fonds de solidarité FTQ&quot; which it uses to collaborate with and influence industrial groups and to promote economic growth. In November 2006 its investment fund stood at more than $6.8 billion.

The FTQ endorsed the Parti Québécois for the 2007 Quebec election, but criticized their call for a new referendum.

In January 2023, Magali Picard became the first indigenous person to lead FTQ when she was elected president. She had previously been national vice-president of the Public Service Alliance of Canada before resigning in 2020 after concerns of anti-Black behaviour against PSAC employees were widely expressed by Black staff members.

<text>&quot;&quot; is the national anthem of Nepal. It was officially adopted as the anthem on 3 August 2007 during a ceremony held at the conference hall of National Planning Commission, inside Singha Durbar, by the speaker of the interim parliament, Subash Chandra Nembang. The previous national anthem &quot;Shriman Gambhir&quot; was adopted in 1962 but was dropped following the treaty of the monarchy.

The lyrics of the national anthem were penned by the poet Pradip Kumar Rai, who went by his alias Byakul Maila. The music was composed by Amber Gurung. The theme of the national anthem praises Nepalese sovereignty, unity, courage, pride, scenic beauty, progress, peace, cultural and biological diversity, and respect. In August 2016, the BBC ranked Nepal&#x27;s national anthem third in its list of &quot;Rio 2016: The most amazing national anthems&quot;, citing its musical differences compared to other anthems.

==Lyrics==
===Nepali official===
===English translation===
== History ==
After the unanimous decision on 19 May 2006 by the interim House of Representatives of the Kingdom of Nepal, the old national anthem was discontinued. On 30 November 2006, the National Anthem Selection Task Team selected poet Byakul Maila&#x27;s song as the new national anthem of the country. The new national anthem was selected from a total of 1,272 submissions made from across the country. It was officially approved on 20 April 2007.

On 3 August 2007, &quot;Sayaun Thunga Phulka&quot; was officially declared as Nepal&#x27;s national anthem by the House of Representatives.

The anthem&#x27;s range is of an octave; having a nadir and apex of D.

== Protocol ==
The public performance of the anthem is regulated by the law. All citizens must stand and show respect to the flag while radio and television stations shall broadcast the anthem during &quot;startup&quot; and &quot;closedown&quot;.

== Controversy ==
During the selection process, Byakul Maila was required to prove he was not a royalist and encountered difficulties when it was discovered that he had once edited a book of poetry that contained a contribution from King Gyanendra.

Some of Nepal&#x27;s Maoist leaders preferred a stronger, more revolutionary anthem akin to the communist &quot;Internationale&quot;&quot;,&quot; and even took their own CDs into the final selection meeting hoping to overturn Byakul Maila&#x27;s and Amber Gurung&#x27;s effort.

<text>U.S. Route 53, or U.S. Highway 53 (U.S. 53), is a north–south U.S. highway that runs for 404 miles (650 km) from La Crosse, Wisconsin to International Falls, Minnesota. It is the primary north–south route in northwestern Wisconsin, serving as a vital link between I-94 at Eau Claire, Wisconsin and the Twin Ports of Superior, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota. The entire route from Eau Claire to the city limits of Superior is a four lane divided highway. The highway&#x27;s northern terminus is at the Fort Frances–International Falls International Bridge in International Falls, Minnesota, at the Canada–US border. Its southern terminus is in La Crosse, Wisconsin, at U.S. Highway 14.

==Route description==

===Wisconsin===

U.S. Highway 53 begins at its southern terminus with a junction at U.S. 14, U.S. 61, and Wisconsin Highway 16 in downtown La Crosse. From there, U.S. 53 crosses Interstate 90 and becomes a freeway bypass of Onalaska and Holmen before proceeding north to Eau Claire as a two-lane roadway. The interchange with Interstate 94 at Eau Claire begins a freeway / expressway stretch for U.S. 53 north to the city limits of Superior. The freeway in Eau Claire bypasses most of the city, alleviating congestion on the original route (signed now as both Business U.S. 53 and Hastings Way). Business U.S. 53 / Hastings Way is a mix of grade-separated interchanges and at-grade intersections, and is routed through Eau Claire, passing within about of downtown Eau Claire. Other smaller towns between Eau Claire and Superior (Minong and Solon Springs) were bypassed in a similar manner.

Wisconsin&#x27;s first single-point urban interchange is found along the U.S. 53 bypass of Eau Claire, at its interchange with U.S. 12 in Altoona. This interchange received the 2005 Outstanding Highway Construction award from the Bureau of Project Development.

U.S. 53 continues as a freeway north of Eau Claire past Chippewa Falls to Rice Lake, where it then becomes an expressway with only three grade-separated interchanges (one at 28th Avenue (CTH-V) in Haugen, one at Wisconsin Highway 70 near Spooner and one at Wisconsin Highway 13, immediately southeast of Superior). U.S. 53 has a partial grade-separated interchange with U.S. 2 in the town of Amnicon, but traffic turning from U.S. 2 westbound onto U.S. 53 southbound must take a U-turn at an at-grade crossover past the interchange.

After passing through the city of Superior as a four-lane city surface street (East Second Street) for a stretch, U.S. 53 then approaches the Saint Louis Bay. U.S. 53 then runs together with Interstate 535 and crosses the bay via the John Blatnik Bridge into Minnesota.

===Minnesota===
US 53 enters the state at the city of Duluth on the John Blatnik Bridge over the Saint Louis Bay. US 53 runs concurrently with I-535 for as it enters Minnesota. I-535/US 53 has an interchange with I-35 in Duluth, known locally as the &quot;Can of Worms&quot;; it features a pair of left exits from I-35, a stoplight and lane drops over the I-35 bridge.

After its junction with I-35, US 53 continues through Duluth on Piedmont Avenue and Trinity Road for .

US 53 then runs concurrently with State Highway 194 (MN 194) for , from Trinity Road in Duluth to Lindahl Road in the city of Hermantown. This four-lane stretch of US 53 and MN 194 are also known as the Miller Trunk Highway in the cities of Duluth and Hermantown.

From Hermantown, the route proceeds north to the city of Virginia. The portion of the route from Duluth to Virginia is a four-lane expressway. US 53 has a junction with MN 33 at the unincorporated community of Independence. Continuing northbound, US 53 has an interchange with US 169 in Virginia. In between the US 169 and MN 135 interchanges is the Thomas Rukavina Memorial Bridge. This bridge is the tallest in the state and spans 4 lanes of freeway. Immediately north of Virginia, US 53 has an interchange with MN 169 in Wuori Township.

US 53 then proceeds northwest to International Falls, where it has a junction with US 71 and MN 11.

US 53 in Minnesota passes through Saint Louis and Koochiching counties. Legally, the Minnesota section of US 53 is defined as unmarked legislative routes 106, 11, and 315 in Minnesota Statutes §§ 161.115(37), (246), and 161.114(2). US 53 is not marked with these legislative numbers along the actual highway.

====Designations====
*A portion of US 53 in Minnesota is officially designated the &quot;Voyageur Highway&quot;. The &quot;Voyageur Highway&quot; is a state designation that is also applied to various other state highways in Minnesota.
*The portion of US 53 from the city limits of Virginia to MN 11 in International Falls was designated as &quot;Speaker Irvin N. Anderson Memorial Highway&quot; in 2009 in honor of former State House Speaker Irv Anderson.
*The 2008 Minnesota Legislature named US 53 between Superior Street and Central Entrance in the city of Duluth as &quot;Walter F. Mondale Drive&quot;. On June 12, 2008, this section of highway (Piedmont Avenue and Trinity Road) was dedicated as Walter F. Mondale Drive in honor of the former vice president&#x27;s public service.

==History==
U.S. Highway 53 was extended into Minnesota in 1934. When marked, it was paved from the Wisconsin border to its junction with U.S. 169 in Virginia, on a short segment between Britt and Idington, and from Cusson to the Canadian border. The segment from Virginia to Britt was paved during that year, and the remainder was paved in 1935.

A bypass around Virginia was completed in 1964 and opened to traffic that November; State Highway 135 was extended along the previous alignment through the city.

The expressway section between Duluth and Virginia was constructed by 1970, except the portion between Four Corners and Independence.

In 1989, the entirety of US 53 in Wisconsin was designated the &quot;Peace Memorial Highway&quot;, commemorating citizens of Wisconsin who have worked to promote international peace.

A new four-lane divided highway section of U.S. 53 in Duluth was constructed in 2004. This section of the route is known locally as &quot;Piedmont Avenue&quot;. Previously, from 1934 to 2004, this same section of U.S. 53 was a narrow two-lane roadway that had proceeded up the hill to a seven-legged intersection that had included Duluth&#x27;s &quot;Skyline Parkway&quot;. Locally, this now-defunct famous intersection, had been known for 70 years by the name &quot;Seven Corners&quot;.

A new U.S. Highway 53 interchange with State Highway 169 in Wuori Township was built in 2006.

A four-lane expressway from north of the city of Virginia to the south city limits of Cook was constructed beginning in 2009 as part of a long-range goal of providing a four-lane highway to Canada as part of the Falls-to-Falls Corridor. The first stage, from approximately County Road 307 to 0.25 miles south of County Road 652 (Goodell Road), was completed in 2009; the second stage was completed in the fall of 2013.

===Relocation between Eveleth and Virginia===
On May 5, 2010, Cliffs Natural Resources provided notice to the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) that U.S. Highway 53 easement rights across the United Taconite Mine, per a 1960 agreement, would be terminated to allow for expansion of the mine. United Taconite and MnDOT negotiated an agreement to move the roadway by 2017.

There were three rerouting options proposed:

* West – Following State Highway 37 and Saint Louis County Road 7.
* Center – Through the Auburn Pit; on the south side of the existing route of Highway 53.
* East – Around and across the Rouchleau Pit; on the north side of the existing route of Highway 53.

The East route was selected for the project and construction began in November 2015, with the realignment reaching completion in 2017. On September 15, the new roadway was opened, with a dedication of the bridge spanning the Rouchleau Pit. The bridge is the tallest in the state at in height.

==Falls-to-Falls Corridor==
The Falls-to-Falls Corridor (officially The Falls-to-Falls Corridor—United States Route 53 from International Falls on the Minnesota/Canada border to Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin) is, by the United States federal government, a recognized trade corridor.

In the 1990s, the federal government listed the corridor as a priority for development. The primary development planned is infrastructure-related, specifically, a highway project hoped to spur economic development in northwestern Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota by widening U.S. Highway 53 to full expressway standards from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin to International Falls, Minnesota. Interstate Highway 535 forms the only section of the route that is part of the Interstate Highway System.

===Wisconsin===
With the exception of a stretch as a four-lane city surface street (East Second Street) in the city of Superior, the entire route within Wisconsin is completed to freeway or expressway standards. On the south end of the corridor, the connection to Interstate Highway 94 is a stretch through the Eau Claire-Chippewa Falls conurbation. After years of legal and political wrangling, the decision was made in the late 1990s to bypass the current route, rather than to convert the present highway to freeway standards. The northern half of this bypass, as far south as WIS 312 was opened to traffic in mid-2005. The southern half of the bypass, which includes a pair of multilane bridges over the Eau Claire River, goes mostly through Altoona and includes interchanges with WIS 312, U.S. Highway 12 and WIS 93. This project won multiple awards in 2005 and 2006. This section of the bypass was opened mid-morning on August 21, 2006.

===Minnesota===
Federal funding for the project in northern Minnesota was $940,000 in 2003 and nearly $600,000 in 2004. At present, with the exception of stretch within the city of Duluth (Piedmont Avenue and Trinity Road), the route is completed as an expressway as far north as the city of Cook, leaving approximately of the route to International Falls to be converted to expressway standards.

<doc id="888928" wikidata="Q2745489" url="?curid=888928" title="Spatial disorientation">
<text>Spatial disorientation is the inability to determine position or relative motion, commonly occurring during periods of challenging visibility, since vision is the dominant sense for orientation. The auditory system, vestibular system (within the inner ear), and proprioceptive system (sensory receptors located in the skin, muscles, tendons and joints) collectively work to coordinate movement with balance, and can also create illusory nonvisual sensations, resulting in spatial disorientation in the absence of strong visual cues.

In aviation, spatial disorientation can result in improper perception of the attitude of the aircraft, referring to the orientation of the aircraft relative to the horizon. If a pilot relies on this improper perception, this can result in inadvertent turning, ascending or descending. For aviators, proper recognition of aircraft attitude is most critical at night or in poor weather, when there is no visible horizon; in these conditions, aviators may determine aircraft attitude by reference to an attitude indicator. Spatial disorientation can occur in other situations where visibility is reduced, such as diving operations.

== Flight safety, history, and statistics ==

Spatial orientation in flight is difficult to achieve because numerous sensory stimuli (visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive) vary in magnitude, direction, and frequency. Any differences or discrepancies between visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive sensory inputs result in a sensory mismatch that can produce illusions and lead to spatial disorientation. The visual sense is considered to be the largest contributor to orientation.

While testing an early turn and slip indicator devised by his friend Elmer Sperry in 1918, United States Army Air Corps pilot William Ocker entered a graveyard spiral while flying through clouds without visual references; the turn indicator showed he was in a turn, but his senses told him he was in level flight. Emerging from the clouds, Ocker was able to recover from the dive. In 1926, Ocker was subjected to a Bárány chair equilibrium test by Dr. David A. Myers at Crissy Field; the resulting duplication of the somatogyral illusion he had experienced and a subsequent re-test, which he passed using the turn indicator, led him to develop and champion instrumented flight. Sperry would go on to invent the gyrocompass and attitude indicator, both of which were being tested by 1930. With Lt. Carl Crane, Ocker published the instructional text &quot;Blind Flying in Theory and Practice&quot; in 1932. Influential advocates of instrumented flight training included Albert Hegenberger and Jimmy Doolittle.

In 1965, the Federal Aviation Agency of the United States issued Advisory Circular AC 60-4, warning pilots about the hazards of spatial disorientation, which may result from operation under visual flight rules in conditions of marginal visibility. A new version of the advisory was issued in 1983 as AC 60-4A, defining spatial disorientation as &quot;the inability to tell which way is &#x27;up.

Statistics show that between 5% and 10% of all general aviation accidents can be attributed to spatial disorientation, 90% of which are fatal. Spatial-D and G-force induced loss of consciousness (g-LOC) are two of the most common causes of death from human factors in military aviation. A study on the prevalence of spatial disorientation incidents concluded that &quot;if a pilot flies long enough ... there is no chance that he/she will escape experiencing at least one episode of [spatial disorientation]. Looked at another way, pilots can be considered to be in one of two groups; those who have been disorientated, and those who will be.&quot;

== Physiology ==
There are four physiologic systems that interact to allow humans to orient themselves in space. Vision is the dominant sense for orientation, but the vestibular system, proprioceptive system and auditory system also play a role.

Spatial orientation (the inverse being spatial disorientation, aka &quot;spatial-D&quot;) is the ability to maintain body orientation and posture in relation to the surrounding environment (physical space) at rest and during motion. Humans have evolved to maintain spatial orientation on the ground. Good spatial orientation on the ground relies on the use of visual, auditory, vestibular, and proprioceptive sensory information. Changes in linear acceleration, angular acceleration, and gravity are detected by the vestibular system and the proprioceptive receptors, and then compared in the brain with visual information.

The three-dimensional environment of flight is unfamiliar to the human body, creating sensory conflicts and illusions that make spatial orientation difficult and sometimes impossible to achieve. The result of these various visual and nonvisual illusions is spatial disorientation. Various models have been developed to yield quantitative predictions of disorientation associated with known aircraft accelerations.

== The vestibular system and sensory illusions ==
The vestibular system detects linear and angular (rotational) acceleration using specialized organs in the inner ear. Linear accelerations are detected by the otolith organs, while angular accelerations are detected by the semicircular canals.

=== Misleading sensations ===
Without a visual reference or cues, such as a visible horizon, humans will rely on non-visual senses to establish their sense of motion and equilibrium. During the abnormal acceleratory environment of flight, the vestibular and proprioceptive systems can be misled, resulting in spatial disorientation. When an aircraft is maneuvering, inertial forces can be created by changes in vehicle speed (linear acceleration) and/or changes in direction (rotational acceleration and centrifugal force), resulting in perceptual misjudgment of the vertical, as the combined forces of gravity and inertia do not align with what the vestibular system assumes is the vertical direction of gravity (towards the center of the Earth).

Under ideal conditions, visual cues will provide sufficient information to override illusory vestibular inputs, but at night or in poor weather, visual inputs can be overwhelmed by these illusory nonvisual sensations, resulting in spatial disorientation. Low visibility flight conditions include night, over water or other monotonous/featureless terrain that blends into the sky, white-out weather, or inadvertent entry into instrument meteorological conditions after flying into fog or clouds.
For example, in an aircraft that is making a coordinated (banked) turn, no matter how steep, occupants will have little or no sensation of being tilted in the air unless the horizon is visible, as the combined forces of lift and gravity are felt as pressing the occupant into the seat without a lateral force sliding them to either side. Similarly, it is possible to gradually climb or descend without a noticeable change in pressure against the seat. In some aircraft, it is possible to execute a loop without pulling negative g-forces so that, without visual reference, the pilot could be upside down without being aware of it. A gradual change in any direction of movement may not be strong enough to activate the vestibular system, so the pilot may not realize that the aircraft is accelerating, decelerating, or banking.
Gyroscopic flight instruments such as the attitude indicator (artificial horizon) and the turn and slip indicator are designed to provide information to counteract misleading sensations from the non-visual senses.

===Otoliths and somatogravic illusions===
Two otolith organs, the saccule and utricle, are located in each ear and are set at right angles to each other. The utricle detects changes in linear acceleration in the horizontal plane, while the saccule detects linear accelerations in the vertical plane; humans have evolved to assume the vertical acceleration is caused by gravity. However, the saccule and utricle can provide misleading sensory perception when gravity is not limited to the vertical plane, or when vehicle speeds and accelerations result in inertial forces comparable to the force of gravity, as the otoliths only detect acceleration, and cannot distinguish inertial forces from the force of gravity. Some examples of this include the inertial forces experienced during a vertical take-off in a helicopter or following the sudden opening of a parachute after a free fall.

Illusions caused by the otolith organs are called somatogravic illusions and include the Inversion, Head-Up, and Head-Down Illusions. The Inversion Illusion results from a steep ascent followed by a sudden return to level flight; the resulting relative increase in forward speed produces an illusion the aircraft is inverted. The Head-Up and Head-Down illusions are similar, involving sudden linear acceleration (Head-Up) or deceleration (Head-Down), leading to a misperception the nose of the aircraft is pitching up (Head-Up) or down (Head-Down); the aviator could be fooled into pitching the nose down (Head-Up) or up (Head-Down) in response, leading to a crash or a stall, respectively.

Typically, the Head-Up illusion occurs during take-off, as a strong linear acceleration is used to generate lift over the wing and flaps. Without a visual reference, the pilot may assume from the vestibular system the nose has pitched up and command a dive; if this occurs during take-off, the aircraft may not have sufficient altitude to recover before crashing into the ground.

===Semicircular canals and somatogyral illusions===

In addition, the inner ear contains rotational accelerometers, known as the semicircular canals, which provide information to the lower brain on rotational accelerations in the pitch, roll and yaw axes. Changes in angular velocity are detected from the relative motion between the fluid in the canals and the canal itself, which is fixed to the head; because of inertia, the fluid in the canals tends to lag when the head moves, signaling a rotational acceleration. However, semicircular canal output ceases after prolonged rotation (beyond ) as the fluid has now been entrained into motion through friction, matching the motion of the head. If the rotation is then stopped, the perceived motion signal from the inner ear indicates the aviator is now turning in the opposite direction from actual travel, as the fluid continues to move while the canal has stopped. In addition, the inertia of the fluid means the detection threshold of rotational acceleration is limited to approximately 2°/sec; angular accelerations below this value cannot be detected. Specific common somatogyral illusions induced by the semicircular canals are the Leans, Graveyard Spin, Graveyard Spiral, and Coriolis.
If the aircraft enters an unnoticed, prolonged turn gradually, then suddenly returns to level flight, the leans may result. The gradual turn sets the fluid into the semicircular canals into motion, and rotational acceleration of two degrees per second (or less) cannot be detected. Once the aircraft suddenly returns to level flight, the continued fluid motion gives the sensation the aircraft is banking in the opposite direction of the turn that just ended; the aviator may attempt to correct the misperception of the vertical by banking into the original turn. The leans is considered the most common form of spatial disorientation.

The graveyard spiral and graveyard spin are both caused by the acclimation of the semicircular canals to prolonged rotation; after a banked turn (in the case of the graveyard spiral) or spin (for the graveyard spin) of approximately 20 seconds, the fluid in the semicircular canals has been entrained into motion by friction, and the vestibular system no longer perceives a rotational acceleration. If the aviator then ends the turn or spin and returns to level flight, the continued motion of the fluid will cause a sensation the aircraft is turning or spinning in the opposite direction, and the pilot may re-enter the original turn or spin inadvertently; the aviator may not recognize the illusion before the aircraft loses too much altitude, resulting in a collision with terrain or the g-forces on the aircraft may exceed the structural strength of the airframe, resulting in catastrophic failure. One of the most infamous mishaps in aviation history involving the graveyard spiral is the crash involving John F. Kennedy Jr. in 1999.

Once an aircraft enters conditions under which the pilot cannot see a distinct visual horizon, the drift in the inner ear continues uncorrected. Errors in the perceived rate of turn about any axis can build up at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3 degrees per second. If the pilot is not proficient in the use of gyroscopic flight instruments, these errors will build up to a point that control of the aircraft is lost, usually in a steep, diving turn known as a graveyard spiral. During the entire time, leading up to and well into the maneuver, the pilot remains unaware of the turning, believing that the aircraft is maintaining straight flight.

In a 1954 study (180 – Degree Turn Experiment), the University of Illinois Institute of Aviation found that 19 out of 20 non-instrument-rated subject pilots went into a graveyard spiral soon after entering simulated instrument conditions. The 20th pilot also lost control of his aircraft, but in another maneuver. The average time between onset of instrument conditions and loss of control was 178 seconds.
Spatial disorientation can also affect instrument-rated pilots in certain conditions. A powerful tumbling sensation (vertigo) can result if the pilot moves his or her head too much during instrument flight. This is called the Coriolis illusion. Because the semicircular canals are set in three different axes of rotation, if the aviator suddenly moves their head during a rotational acceleration, one canal may abruptly start to detect an angular acceleration while another ceases, resulting in a tumbling sensation.

== Visual illusions ==
Even with good visibility, misleading visual inputs such as sloping cloud decks, unfamiliar runway grades, or false horizons can also form optical illusions, resulting in the pilot misjudging the vertical orientation, aircraft speed or altitude, and/or distance and depth perception; these could even combine with nonvisual illusions from the vestibular and proprioceptive systems to produce an even more powerful illusion.

<doc id="888932" wikidata="Q371212" url="?curid=888932" title="Richard Thaler">
<text>Richard H. Thaler (; born September 12, 1945) is an American economist and the Charles R. Walgreen Distinguished Service Professor of Behavioral Science and Economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. In 2015, Thaler was president of the American Economic Association.

Thaler is a theorist in behavioral economics who has collaborated with Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and others in further defining that field. In 2018, he was elected a member in the National Academy of Sciences.

In 2017, he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contributions to behavioral economics. In its announcement, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences stated that his &quot;contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making. His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioral economics.&quot;

==Personal life==
Thaler was born in East Orange, New Jersey to a Jewish family. His mother, Roslyn (née Melnikoff; 1921–2008), was a teacher, and later a real estate agent while his father, Alan Maurice Thaler (1917–2004), was an actuary at the Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey, and was born in Toronto. He grew up with two younger brothers. His great-great-grandfather, Selig Thaler (1831–1903) was from Berezhany, Ukraine. He has three children from his first marriage and is now married to France Leclerc, a former marketing professor at the University of Chicago and avid photographer.

== Education ==
Thaler graduated from Newark Academy, before going on to receive his B.A. degree in 1967 from Case Western Reserve University, and his M.A. in 1970 and Ph.D. degree in 1974 from the University of Rochester, writing his thesis on &quot;The Value of Saving A Life: A Market Estimate&quot; under the supervision of Sherwin Rosen. He also studied under departmental chair and neoclassicist Richard Rosett, whose wine-buying habits were featured in his research on behavioral economics.

== Academic career ==
After completing his studies, Thaler began his career as a professor at the University of Rochester.

Between 1977 and 1978, Thaler spent a year at Stanford University collaborating and researching with Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, who provided him with the theoretical framework to fit many of the economic anomalies that he had identified, such as the endowment effect.

From 1978 to 1995, he was a faculty member at the SC Johnson College of Business at Cornell University. Cornell established in 1989 the Center for Behavioral Economics and Decision Research, with Thaler as founding director.

After gathering some attention with a regular column in the respected &quot;Journal of Economic Perspectives&quot; (which ran between 1987 and 1990) and the publication of these columns by &quot;Princeton University Press&quot; (in 1992), Thaler was offered a position at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Booth School of Business in 1995, where he has taught ever since.

== Writings ==
=== Books ===
Thaler has written a number of books intended for a lay reader on the subject of behavioral economics, including &quot;Quasi-rational Economics&quot; and &quot;The Winner&#x27;s Curse&quot;, the latter of which contains many of his &quot;Anomalies&quot; columns revised and adapted for a popular audience. One of his recurring themes is that market-based approaches are incomplete: he is quoted as saying, &quot;conventional economics assumes that people are highly-rational—super-rational—and unemotional. They can calculate like a computer and have no self-control problems.&quot;

Thaler is coauthor, with Cass Sunstein, of &quot;Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness&quot; (Yale University Press, 2008). &quot;Nudge&quot; discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. &quot;People often make poor choices—and look back at them with bafflement!&quot; Thaler and Sunstein write. &quot;We do this because, as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, happiness, and even the planet itself.&quot; Thaler and his co-author coined the term &quot;choice architecture.&quot;

Thaler advocates for libertarian paternalism, which describes public and private social policies that lead people to make good and better decisions through &quot;nudges&quot; without depriving them of the freedom to choose or significantly changing their economic incentives. An example of this is the choice of default options in retirement savings plans. When joining the plan is made the default, roughly 90 percent of those eligible participate, much higher than if they have to actively join. However, Thaler and Sunstein argue that changing the default to agreeing to organ donation is not an effective policy for increasing organ transplants. Although the default &quot;works&quot; in that almost no one opts out, family members are still consulted before organs are removed, and the lack of an active opt out is (correctly) not considered a strong signal of the potential donor&#x27;s true preferences. Instead they advocate &quot;prompted choice&quot; (ask for permission prominently) plus &quot;first person consent&quot; which stipulates that the wishes of active donors should be honored.

In 2015 Thaler wrote &quot;Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics&quot;, a history of the development of behavioral economics, &quot;part memoir, part attack on a breed of economist who dominated the academy—particularly, the Chicago School that dominated economic theory at the University of Chicago—for much of the latter part of the 20th century.&quot;

=== Other writings ===
Thaler gained some attention in the field of mainstream economics for publishing a regular column in the &quot;Journal of Economic Perspectives&quot; from 1987 to 1990 titled &quot;Anomalies&quot;, in which he documented individual instances of economic behavior that seemed to violate traditional microeconomic theory.

In a 2008 paper, Thaler and colleagues analyzed the choices of contestants appearing in the popular TV game show &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; and found support for behavioralists&#x27; claims of path-dependent risk attitudes. He has also studied cooperation and bargaining in the UK game shows &quot;Golden Balls&quot; and &quot;Divided&quot;.

As a columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot; News Service, Thaler has begun a series of economic solutions for some of America&#x27;s financial woes, beginning with &quot;Selling parts of the radio spectrum could help pare US deficit,&quot; with references to Thomas Hazlett&#x27;s ideas for reform of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and making television broadcast frequency available for improving wireless technology, reducing costs, and generating revenue for the US government.

== Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics ==

Thaler was the 2017 recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for &quot;incorporat[ing] psychologically realistic assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. By exploring the consequences of &quot;limited rationality&quot;, &quot;social preferences&quot;, and &quot;lack of self-control&quot;, he has shown how these human traits systematically affect individual decisions as well as market outcomes.&quot;

&quot;Given the lag between when work is done and when the Nobel Prize is awarded in economics, it would be accurate to say that the prize was largely given for work I did in my Cornell years,&quot; Thaler said.

Immediately following the announcement of the 2017 prize, Professor Peter Gärdenfors, Member of the Economic Sciences Prize Committee, said in an interview that Thaler had &quot;made economics more human&quot;.

After learning that he had won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, Thaler said that his most important contribution to economics &quot;was the recognition that economic agents are human, and that economic models have to incorporate that.&quot; In a nod to the sometimes-unreasonable behavior he has studied so extensively, he also joked that he intended to spend the prize money &quot;as irrationally as possible.&quot;

Paul Krugman, the 2008 winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, tweeted &quot;Yes! Behavorial econ is the best thing to happen to the field in generations, and Thaler showed the way.&quot; However, Thaler&#x27;s selection was not met with universal acclaim; Robert Shiller (one of the 2013 laureates and a fellow behavioral economist) noted that there are some economists who still view Thaler&#x27;s incorporation of a psychological perspective within an economics framework as a dubious proposition. In addition, an article in &quot;The Economist&quot; simultaneously praised Thaler and his fellow behavioral colleagues while bemoaning the practical difficulties that have resulted from causing &quot;economists as a whole to back away a bit from grand theorising, and to focus more on empirical work and specific policy questions.&quot;

In chronicling Thaler&#x27;s path to Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics laureate, John Cassidy notes that although Thaler&#x27;s &quot;nudge&quot; theory may not overcome every shortcoming of traditional economics, it has at least grappled with them &quot;in ways that have yielded important insights in areas ranging from finance to international development&quot;.
==Other honors and awards==

In addition to earning the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Thaler holds many other honors and awards. He is a member of the National Academy of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Fellow of the American Finance Association, and more.

== Behavioral finance and other applications in policy ==
Thaler also is the founder of an asset management firm, Fuller &amp; Thaler Asset Management, which believes that investors will capitalize on cognitive biases such as the endowment effect, loss aversion and status quo bias. Since 1999, he has been the Principal of the firm, which he co-founded in 1993 with Russell Fuller. Fuller said of his co-founder that Thaler has changed the economics profession in that &quot;[h]e doesn&#x27;t write papers that are full of math. He writes papers that are full of common sense.&quot;

Thaler served with Robert Shiller as the co-director of the National Bureau of Economic Research Behavioral Economics Project for three decades.

Thaler was also involved in the establishment of the Behavioural Insights Team, which was originally part of the British Government&#x27;s Cabinet Office but is now a limited company.

Thaler made a cameo appearance as himself in the 2015 movie &quot;The Big Short&quot;, which was about the credit and housing bubble collapse that led to the 2008 global financial crisis. During one of the film&#x27;s expository scenes, he helped pop star Selena Gomez explain the &#x27;hot hand fallacy,&#x27; in which people believe that whatever is happening now will continue to happen in the future. As a consequence of his appearance in the film, Thaler has an Erdős–Bacon number of 5.

<text>The PM-84 Glauberyt is a Polish submachine gun. It is a personal weapon intended for combat and self-defence at ranges up to 150 m with single shot or fully automatic fire mode. It features a compact design, minimum overall dimensions, small weight, very good accuracy, and fire stability. It is designed for heavy weapons platoons personnel and reconnaissance detachments, special anti-terrorist and police troops.

In service with the Polish military and police it replaced the earlier PM-63 RAK submachine gun.

== Operation ==
The Glauberyt is a select-fire, straight blowback-operated firearm that fires from the closed bolt position. Its design influence can be seen to mimic the Uzi. However it features a last shot bolt hold open/release like modern service pistols unlike any other submachine guns of its time. The PM-84/PM-84P also features ambidextrous charging handles on both sides (influenced by the vz.61 Škorpion). A two-bar retractable buttstock tucks right into the side of the weapon. The magazine release is in the heel of the pistol grip. The Glauberyt feeds from 15-round flush magazines and 25-round extended magazines. Fire selector Z = SAFE, P = SEMI, C = FULL AUTO, and sits above rear of the pistol grip. When the firearm is on SAFE, the bolt is locked and prevented from moving. A folding fore grip rests in front of the trigger guard (in the style of the PM-63 RAK), and an optional tactical flashlight/laser grip can also be mounted, replacing the folding fore grip.

Modern PM-98/PM-06 variants utilize a thumb magazine release. A new slot in the magazine is required to be cut out to work in the later Glauberyts.

== Variants ==
* PM-84: Original 9×18mm Makarov model, replacing PM-63 RAK service.
* PM-84P: 9×19mm Parabellum model, 1993 production onwards.
* PM-98: Model onwards, has the magazine release relocated to the thumb position, the charging handle is redesigned to be on the left side only, a more robust receiver and retractable butt stock, enlarged trigger guard for winter gloves, optional light/laser foregrip.
* PM-98S: Special model where rate of fire increased to 770 rounds per minute in full auto.
* PM-06: Features a new 3 position telescopic butt stock that pulls out straight, a see through MIL-STD-1913 top rail to facilitate optical reflex sights, hooded front sight.
* PM96S: Civilian semi-automatic only model of the PM84P
* BRS-99: Civilian semi-automatic only model of the Glauberyt.

==Users==

* : Indonesian police use PM-98.
* : 6,000 PM-98s were sold to Iraq in mid-2000.
* : 10 PM-84P in use by Lithuanian Army.
* : Philippine police use PM-98.
* : Around 50,000 PM-84P, PM-98 and PM-06 are used in Polish Armed Forces, Military Gendarmerie and Policja.

<text>U.S. Route 54 (US 54) is an east–west United States Highway that runs northeast–southwest for from El Paso, Texas, to Griggsville, Illinois. The Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Tucumcari Line (former Southern Pacific and Rock Island Lines &quot;Golden State Route&quot;) runs parallel to US 54 from El Paso to Pratt, Kansas, which comprises about two-thirds of the route. Truckers refer to this road as &quot;The Bee Line.&quot;

The highway&#x27;s western terminus is in the city of El Paso, near the Mexican border and the eastern terminus is at Interstate 72 (I-72) in Griggsville. The highway is signed North-South in Texas and New Mexico reflecting its directional orientation and East-West the remainder of its course.

=== Texas (El Paso) ===
US 54 begins in El Paso at Loop 375 downtown (US 54/Patriot Freeway). The highway serves as a major freeway for the Metro area&#x27;s network, running north–south along the city&#x27;s eastern slope of the Franklin Mountains range. The highway runs through the city for approximately before reaching the New Mexico state line. Within the network, it is a military connector for Fort Bliss and Holloman Air Force Base.

=== New Mexico ===

US 54 enters New Mexico in Chaparral as part of the El Paso, Texas Metro area network. It also serves as a military highway to connect Fort Bliss in El Paso to Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo, New Mexico (via U.S. Route 70). The speed limit is 75 mph on the divided highway section upon entering the state to approximately south of Alamogordo, with a 35 mph zone in Orogrande. Upon entering Alamogordo, US 54 becomes concurrent with U.S. Route 70. US 54/US 70 then intersects the beginning of U.S. Route 82 at the north end of Alamogordo (near La Luz). The limit is 60 mph from Alamogordo to Tularosa and 55 mph north of Tularosa, where the concurrency with US 70 ends, and the highway reverts to being two lanes wide and not divided. The highway runs north through the central portion of the state, passing through Carrizozo and intersecting U.S. Route 380. The route then turns northeast before passing through Vaughn. Upon entering Vaughn, the route is briefly concurrent with U.S. Route 60 and U.S. Route 285. In Vaughn, US 285 splits off to the south. Exiting Vaughn, US 60 splits off to the southeast, and the route continues northeast to Santa Rosa where it becomes concurrent with Interstate 40. The I-40 concurrency lasts for to Tucumcari. The highway then exits the state back into Texas at Nara Visa. The highway runs for in New Mexico, and is signed as a north–south route through the state.

=== Texas (Panhandle) ===

The highway re-enters the Texas Panhandle just beyond Nara Visa, New Mexico, and continues northeast for to the Oklahoma border. Major Texas cities along US 54 in the panhandle are Dalhart and Stratford.

=== Oklahoma ===
US 54 runs through the Oklahoma Panhandle from southwest to northeast. It enters at Texhoma, then continues northeast through Goodwell before entering Guymon. In Guymon, it intersects US 412 and begins a concurrency with US-64. It goes northeast through Optima and Hooker, where US 64 turns east. After going northeast through Tyrone, it enters Kansas just before entering Liberal, Kansas.

=== Kansas ===
US 54 enters the state from Oklahoma in Seward County, and travels through the cities of Liberal and Plains, where it runs concurrently with US 160 in Meade County. Just east of the city of Meade, US 54 splits from US 160 and continues in a northeasterly direction through Meade and Ford counties before beginning a long concurrency with US 400 in Mullinville in Kiowa County.

The highway then travels through the town of Greensburg and continues as a two-lane road through Pratt, Cunningham, and Kingman. At Pratt, the Union Pacific railroad tracks which paralleled the highway for over from El Paso turn to the northeast (towards Topeka) and leave US 54. The road becomes a divided highway in eastern Kingman County. From Kingman to Garden Plain in Sedgwick County it is a freeway but becomes an at-grade expressway as it passes through Goddard and approaches Wichita.
The freeway resumes as the road crosses the city limits of Wichita near Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport. In Wichita, US 54/US 400 is known as Kellogg Avenue, and has junctions with I-235, I-135 and I-35, the Kansas Turnpike, before a junction with K-96. The Kellogg Avenue freeway has six lanes and extends from 111th Street on the west side of Wichita to Zelta just after the I-35/Kansas Turnpike interchange on the east side. Upgrading of Kellogg Avenue from a surface arterial to a freeway has been underway since the mid-1980s, with the latest interchange project opening in late 2019. The road gets its name from Milo Bailey Kellogg, a shopkeeper and Civil War veteran who was the city&#x27;s first civilian postmaster in 1870.

The concurrency of US 54 and US 400 continues through Augusta in Butler County before US 400 heads east toward the Missouri state line, while US 54 forms a brief concurrency with US 77 through El Dorado. At El Dorado, US 54 continues its easterly course through rural areas in Greenwood and Woodson counties before passing through the cities of Iola and Fort Scott; US 77 heads north to Junction City. US 54 exits Kansas in Bourbon County before reaching Nevada, Missouri.

=== Missouri ===
In Missouri, US 54 runs from the southwest portion of the state to the northeast. It is a major conduit through the Ozarks and is the primary access road to Pomme de Terre Lake and Lake of the Ozarks. After entering the state it passes through Nevada, El Dorado Springs, Hermitage, crossing Lake of the Ozarks the first time just north of Ha Ha Tonka State Park. It passes through Camdenton and crosses the lake a second time on the Grand Glaize Bridge at Osage Beach before bypassing Eldon and going through Jefferson City, where it crosses the Missouri River via the Jefferson City Bridge and briefly overlaps U.S. Route 63. Just north of the bridge, it splits passing through Fulton, crossing Interstate 70 at Kingdom City, bypassing Mexico, sharing a concurrency with Highway 19 through Laddonia, passing just north of Vandalia, and ultimately crossing the Mississippi River via the Champ Clark Bridge into Illinois at Louisiana.

=== Illinois ===

In the state of Illinois, U.S. 54 runs from the Champ Clark Bridge over the Mississippi River to its terminus at Interstate 72 southwest of Griggsville. Before the eastern terminus was cut back to I-72, U.S. 54 continued northeast via several existing roads, including the current Illinois Route 54, Illinois Route 50, and Governors&#x27; Highway, into downtown Chicago, where it ended at Michigan Avenue and Lake Shore Drive. It is a rural, two-lane surface street for its entire length in Illinois. In the state of Illinois, U.S. 54 is long.

== History ==

===Illinois===
Initially, US 54 ended at the junction of present-day IL 106 (former portion of US 36). In 1935, it replaced a portion of IL 107 between Louisiana, Missouri and New Hartford, Illinois. From 1942 to 1971, US 54 reached downtown Chicago. It then got truncated back to its previous northern terminus. This was in favor of portions of US 36, Illinois Route 54, US 45, Illinois Route 50, Governors Highway, Wood Street, 127th Street, Halsted Street, Vincennes Avenue, State Street, and Michigan Avenue. The four-lane section of U.S. 36 northeast of Pittsfield now also carries Interstate 72 east to Springfield. As of 1992, US 54 was extended northeast to US 36 and present-day I-72 (exit 35). That same year, the section of road that once carried Illinois Route 54 through Springfield is no longer designated as a numbered highway. Now Illinois Route 54 starts at the Interstate 55 exit and goes northeast to Onarga, where it ends at U.S. Route 45. US 54 once joined with US 45 to Kankakee, but that highway is now designated as US 45 alone to Gilman, then US 45 and US 24 through Gilman, then US 45 alone again until a four-way intersection with U.S. Route 52 and Illinois Route 49, and US 45 and US 52 through Kankakee. Between Kankakee and Monee, the section that once carried US 54 is now marked as Illinois Route 50.

<doc id="888959" wikidata="Q3523747" url="?curid=888959" title="Sudanese kinship">
<text>Sudanese kinship, also referred to as the descriptive system, is a kinship system used to define family. Identified by Lewis Henry Morgan in his 1871 work &quot;Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family&quot;, the Sudanese system is one of the six major kinship systems (Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha and Sudanese).

The Sudanese kinship system is the most complicated of all kinship systems. It maintains a separate designation for almost every one of Ego&#x27;s (the individual&#x27;s) kin, based on their distance from Ego, their relation, and their gender. Ego&#x27;s father is distinguished from Ego&#x27;s father&#x27;s brother and from Ego&#x27;s mother&#x27;s brother. Ego&#x27;s mother is similarly distinguished from Ego&#x27;s mother&#x27;s sister and from Ego&#x27;s father&#x27;s sister. For cousins, there are eight possible terms.

==Usage==
The system is named after the peoples of South Sudan. The Sudanese kinship system also existed in ancient Latin-speaking and Anglo-Saxon cultures. It exists today among present-day Arab, Turkish, and Chinese cultures. Among Germanic languages, it is present in Swedish. It tends to co-occur with patrilineal descent, and it is often said to be common in complex and stratified cultures.

===Variants===

Balkan kinships such as Bulgarian, Serbian, and Bosniak follow this system for different patrilinear and matrilinear uncles but collapse mother&#x27;s sister and father&#x27;s sister into the same term of &quot;aunt&quot; and Croatian and Macedonian further collapse the offspring of the uncles into one term.

Similarly, Finnish kinship terms separate patrilinear and matrilinear uncles but not aunts, while making no distinctions between first cousins but giving a separate term for second cousins. Further distinctions (some much more common than others) can be made between a patrilinear or matrilinear grandson/granddaughter, niece/nephew, grandfather/grandmother and others, by using compound words. An interesting feature is the presence of many unique words originating from Proto-Uralic and Germanic languages to describe affinal kinships such as, but not limited to, the brother of a spouse (lanko), mother-in-law (anoppi) or even the husband of a daughter (vävy).

On the opposite side, Chinese adds an additional dimension of relative age. Ego&#x27;s older siblings are distinguished from younger, as are those of Ego&#x27;s parents. One must specify whether older (e.g. Mandarin 哥哥 &quot;gēge&quot;) or younger (e.g. Mandarin 弟弟 &quot;dìdi&quot;). Similarly, a term for &quot;uncle&quot; or (in at least in some varieties of Chinese, including Mandarin) even &quot;father&#x27;s brother&quot; does not exist without circumlocution; the speaker must either specify &quot;father&#x27;s older brother&quot; (e.g. Mandarin 伯伯 &quot;bóbo&quot;) or &quot;father&#x27;s younger brother&quot; (e.g. Mandarin 叔叔 &quot;shūshu&quot;). This does not apply to maternal uncles.

<text>A home theater PC (HTPC) or media center computer is a convergent device that combines some or all the capabilities of a personal computer with a software application that focuses on video, photo, audio playback, and sometimes video recording functionality. Since the mid-2000s, other types of consumer electronics, including game consoles and dedicated media devices, have crossed over to manage video and music content. The term &quot;media center&quot; also refers to specialized application software designed to run on standard personal computers.

HTPC and other convergent devices integrate components of a home theater into a unit co-located with a home entertainment system. An HTPC system typically has a remote control and the software interface normally has a 10-foot (3 m) user interface design so that it can be comfortably viewed at typical television viewing distances. An HTPC can be purchased pre-configured with the required hardware and software needed to add video programming or music to the PC. Enthusiasts can also piece together a system out of discrete components as part of a software-based HTPC.

Since 2007, digital media players and smart TV software has been incorporated into consumer electronics through software or hardware changes including video game consoles, Blu-ray players, networked media players, televisions, and set-top boxes. The increased availability of specialized devices, coupled with paid and free digital online content, now offers an alternative to multipurpose (and more costly) personal computers.

== History ==
The HTPC as a concept is the product of several technology innovations including high-powered home computers, digital media, and the shift from standard-resolution CRT to high-definition monitors, projectors, and large-screen televisions.

Integrating televisions and personal computers dates back to the late 1980s with tuner cards that could be added to Amiga computers via the Video Toaster. This adaptation would allow a small video window to appear on the screen with broadcast or cable content. Apple Computer also developed the Macintosh TV in late 1993 that included a tuner card built into a Macintosh LC 520 chassis but quickly withdrew from the market with only 10,000 units shipped.

In 1996 Gateway 2000 unveiled the Destination computer, which included a tuner card and video card. The unit cost $4,000 and mostly integrated television viewing and computer functions on one color monitor. The Destination was called a &quot;PC-TV Combo&quot; but by December the term &quot;Home-theater PC&quot; appeared in mainstream media: &quot;The home theater PC will be a combination entertainment and information appliance.&quot;

By 2000, DVD players had become relatively ubiquitous and consumers were seeking ways to improve the picture. The value of using a computer instead of standalone DVD player drove more usage of the PC as a home media device. In particular, the desire for progressive scanning DVD players (480p instead of 480i) with better video fidelity led some consumers to consider their computers instead of very expensive DVD players.

As DVD players dropped in price, so did PCs and their related video-processing and storage capabilities. In 2000, DVD decryption software using the DeCSS algorithm allowed DVD owners to consolidate their DVD video libraries on hard drives. Innovations such as TiVo and ReplayTV allowed viewers to store and timeshift broadcast content using specially designed computers. ReplayTV for instance ran on a VxWorks platform. Incorporating these capabilities into PCs was well within the ability of a computer hobbyist who was willing to build and program these systems. Key benefits of these DIY projects included lower cost and more features. Advancements in hardware identified another weak link: the absence of media management software to make it easy to display and control the video from a distance.

By 2002, major software developments also facilitated media management, hardware integration, and content presentation. MythTV provided a free and open source solution using Linux. The concept was to combine a digital tuner with digital video recording, program guides, and computer capabilities with a 10-foot (3 m) user interface. XBMC was another free and open software project started with re-purposing the Xbox as a home theater PC but has since been ported to Windows and Macintosh operating systems in various forms including Boxee and Plex. Mainstream commercial software packages included Microsoft&#x27;s Windows XP Media Center Edition (2002) and Apple&#x27;s Front Row (2005), bundled with Mac OS X until 10.7. By early 2006, commercial examples of this integration included the Mac mini which had the Apple Remote, 5.1 digital audio, and an updated Front Row interface that would play shared media. Because of these features and the Mini&#x27;s small form factor, consumers began using the Mini as a Mac-based home theater PC.

As digital cable and satellite became the norm, HTPC software became more dependent on external decoder boxes, and the subscription costs that came with them. For instance, MythTV is capable of capturing unencrypted HDTV streams, such as those broadcast over the air or on cable using a QAM tuner. However, most U.S. cable and satellite set-top boxes provide only encrypted HD streams for &quot;non-basic&quot; content, which can be decoded only by OpenCable-approved hardware or software. In September 2009, OEM restrictions were officially lifted for cableCARD devices, opening up the possibility of HTPC integration.

The advent of fully digital HDTV displays helped to complete the value and ease of use of a HTPC system. Digital projectors, plasma and LCD displays often came pre-configured to accept computer video outputs including VGA, DVI and component video. Furthermore, both the computers and the displays could include video scalers to better conform the image to the screen format and resolutions. Likewise, computers also included HDMI ports that carry both audio and video signals to home video displays or AV receivers.

The simplified integration of computer and home theater displays has allowed for fully digital content distribution over the internet. For instance, by 2007 Netflix &quot;watch instantly&quot; subscribers could view streaming content using their HTPCs with a browser or with plug-ins with applications such as Plex and XBMC. Similar plug-ins are also available for Hulu, YouTube, and broadcasters such as NBC, CBS and PBS.

== HTPC characteristics ==

The media itself may be stored, received by terrestrial, satellite or cable broadcasting or streamed from the internet. Stored media is kept either on a local hard drive or on network attached storage. Some software is capable of doing other tasks, such as finding news (RSS) from the Internet.

Beyond functioning as a standard PC, normally HTPCs have some additional characteristics:

=== Television connectivity ===
Standard PC units are usually connected to a CRT or LCD display, while HTPCs are designed to be connected to a television. All HTPCs should feature a TV-out option, using either an HDMI, DVI, DisplayPort, component video, VGA (for some LCD televisions), S-Video, or composite video output.

=== Remote control ===
Integrating a HTPC into a typical living room requires a way of controlling it from a distance. Many TV tuner/capture cards include remote controls for use with the applications included with the card. Software such as Boxee, GB-PVR, SageTV, MediaPortal and Beyond TV support the use of Windows MCE and other remote controls. Another option is an in-air mouse pointer such as the Wii Remote, GlideTV Navigator, or Loop Pointer, which gives cursor control from a distance. It is also possible to use common wireless keyboards and other peripherals to achieve the same effect (though the range may not be as long as a typical remote control&#x27;s).

Some HTPCs, such as the Plex/Mac Mini combination, support programmable remote controls designed for a wide range of typical home theater devices. More recent innovations include remote-control applications for Android and Apple iOS smartphones and tablets.

=== External and networked storage devices ===
Because of the nature of the HTPC, units require higher-than-average capacities for storage of pictures, music, television shows, videos, and other multimedia. Designed almost as a &#x27;permanent storage&#x27; device, space can quickly run out on these devices. Because of restrictions on internal space for hard disk drives and a desire for low noise levels, many HTPC units use a NAS (Network Attached Storage) device, or another type of network-connected file server.

=== TV tuner cards ===
A TV tuner card is a computer component that allows television signals to be received by a computer. Most TV tuners also function as video capture cards, allowing them to record television programs onto a hard disk. Several manufacturers build combined TV tuner plus capture cards for PCs. Many such cards offer hardware MPEG encoding to reduce the computing requirements. Some cards are designed for analog TV signals such as standard definition cable or off the air television, while others are designed for high-definition digital TV.

=== Network TV tuner ===
A network TV tuner or TV gateway is a TV server that converts TV signal from satellite, cable or antenna to IP. With multiple TV tuners, the TV gateway can stream multiple TV channels to devices across the network. Several TV gateway manufacturers build the device to stream the entire DVB stream, relying on the host player device to process the feed and to capture/record, while other devices such as VBox Home TV Gateway provide a variety of option from full PVR and live TV features, to streaming of specific DVB layers to support less powerful devices and to save network bandwidth.

=== Quiet/minimal noise ===

A common user complaint with using standard PCs as HTPC units is background noise, especially in quieter film scenes. Most personal computers are designed for maximum performance, while the functions of a HTPC system may not be processor-intensive. Thus, passive cooling systems, low-noise fans, vibration-absorbing elastic mounts for fans and hard drives, and other noise-minimizing devices are used in place of conventional cooling systems.

== Software ==
HTPC options exist for each of the major operating systems: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The software is sometimes called &quot;Media Center Software&quot;.

=== Linux, Unix, and BSD ===
A number of media center software solutions exist for Linux-, Unix-, and BSD-based operating systems; for example MythTV is a fully fledged integrated suite of software which incorporates TV recording, video library, video game library, image/picture gallery, information portal and music collection playback among other capabilities. Kodi is also available (as it is for many platforms), and can be used to present all the available media including TV programmes recorded by MythTV. Freevo, VDR, SageTV and Boxee are other solutions.

Linux, partially due to its opensource nature, is available as customised versions including the mediacentre pre-installed and with superfluous software removed. Examples include MythBuntu (based on Xubuntu), and Ubuntu TV or Kodibuntu (formerly XBMCbuntu), (all based on Ubuntu).

LinuxMCE is a complete home automation solution including lighting/curtains, security, and MythTV capability.

=== Mac OS X ===
For Mac OS X versions before 10.7 (Lion), HTPC functionality is built into the operating system itself. Specifically, the programs Front Row and Cover Flow, used in conjunction with the Apple Remote, allow users easily to browse and view any multimedia content stored on their Macs. With the July 2011 release of Mac OS X Lion, Front Row has been discontinued.

Several third-party applications provide HTPC support, including Plex, and XBMC.

Beyond the operating system itself, add-on hardware-plus-software combinations (for adding more full-featured HTPC abilities to any Mac) include Elgato&#x27;s EyeTV series PVRs, AMD&#x27;s &quot;ATI Wonder&quot; external USB 2.0 TV-tuners, and various individual devices from third-party manufacturers.

=== Microsoft Windows ===

For Microsoft Windows, a common approach was to install a version that contains the Windows Media Center (Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise or Ultimate for Windows 7 or Home Premium or Ultimate for Windows Vista). Windows Media Center included additional software that covered the PVR functions of the proposed HTPC, including free program guide information and automatic program recording. Windows 7, Windows Vista Home Premium and Windows Vista Ultimate included an MPEG2 decoder. With the introduction of Windows 8, Media Center was no longer included with the operating system; instead it was necessary to buy Windows 8 Pro and then purchase the Media Center Pack via the Windows Control Panel. Windows Media Centre is not available at all for Windows 10. However, it may be restored by a number of unofficial ways.

Alternative HTPC software may be built with the addition of a third party software PVR to a Windows PC. SageTV, GB-PVR, and DVBViewer have integrated placeshifting comparable to the Slingbox, allowing client PCs and the Hauppauge MediaMVP to be connected to the server over the network. Snapstream provides heuristic commercial detection and program recompression. When using a faster CPU, SageTV and Beyond TV can record content from TV capture cards which do not include hardware MPEG2 compression. For a free alternative, GB-PVR and MediaPortal provide full home theater support and good multi-card DVR capabilities. GB-PVR also has a free client, free mediaMVP client, and free network media playback. MediaPortal provides a full client/server set-up with live TV/DVR (recorded or timeshifted) streaming. MediaPortal is open-source and offers a variety of skins and plugins for music videos, Netflix, Pandora and others.

== Digital media receivers and consumer electronics integration ==

Although digital media players are often built using similar components to personal computers, they are often smaller, quieter and less costly than the full-featured computers adapted to multi-media entertainment.

In recent years, convergence devices for home entertainment including gaming systems, DVRs, Blu-Ray players and dedicated devices such as the Roku have also started managing local video, music and streaming internet content. Likewise, some managed video services such as Verizon&#x27;s FiOS allow users to incorporate their photographs, video, and music from their personal computers to their FiOS set-top-box including DVRs. Gaming systems such as the Nintendo Wii, Sony PlayStation 3 and the Microsoft Xbox 360 support media management beyond their original gaming orientation.

As computing power increases and costs fall, traditional media devices such as televisions have been given network capabilities. So-called Smart TVs from Sony, Samsung, and LG (to name a few) have models that allow owners to include some free or subscription media content available on the Internet. The rapid growth in the availability of online content, including music, video and games, has also made it easier for consumers to use these networked devices. YouTube, for instance, is a common plug-in available on most networked devices. Netflix has also struck deals with many consumer electronics makers to have their interface available for their streaming subscribers. This symbiotic relationship between Netflix and consumer electronics makers has helped propel Netflix to become the largest subscription video service in the U.S., using up to 20% of U.S. bandwidth at peak times.

Other digital media retailers such as Apple, Amazon.com and Blockbuster have purchase and rental options for video and music on demand. Apple in particular has developed a tightly integrated device and content management ecosystem with their iTunes Store, personal computers, iOS devices, and the AppleTV digital media receiver. The most recent version of the AppleTV, at $99, has lost the hard drive included in its predecessor and fully depends either on streaming internet content, or another computer on the home network for media.

== Impact on traditional television services ==
The convergence of content, technology, and broadband access allows consumers to stream television shows and movies to their high-definition television in competition with traditional service providers (cable TV and satellite television). The research company SNL Kagan expects 12 million households, roughly 10%, to go without cable, satellite or telco video service by 2015 using over-the-top services. This represents a new trend in the broadcast television industry, as the list of options for watching movies and TV over the Internet grows every day. Research also shows that even as traditional television service providers are trimming their customer base, adding broadband Internet customers. Nearly 76.6 million U.S. households get broadband from leading cable and telephone companies, although only a portion have sufficient speeds to support quality video streaming. Convergent devices for home entertainment will likely play a much larger role in the future of broadcast television, effectively shifting traditional revenue streams while providing consumers with more options.

<text>U.S. Route 56 (US 56) is an east–west United States highway that runs for approximately in the Midwestern United States. US 56&#x27;s western terminus is at Interstate 25 Business (I-25 Bus.), US 412 and New Mexico State Road 21 (NM 21) in Springer, New Mexico and the highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is at US 71 in Kansas City, Missouri. Much of it follows the Santa Fe Trail.

==Route description==
The highway passes through New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. The eastbound shoulder also touches a corner of Texas at a small road junction near the New Mexico/Oklahoma border.

===New Mexico===
US 56 runs concurrent with US 412 for its entire length in New Mexico, and are signed as such through the state. The two routes begin in Springer and head east towards Abbot, where they serve as the northern terminus of State Road 39. Continuing east, US 56/412 meet the southern terminus of NM 193 south of Farley, the northern terminus of NM 120 east of Gladstone, and the southern terminus of NM 453. US 56/412 intersect US 64 and US 87 in Clayton, New Mexico, and US 64 joins with US 56/412 in their trek northeast. The three routes serve as the southern terminus of NM 406 as they enter the Kiowa National Grassland. The three routes then cross into Oklahoma together.

===Oklahoma===
US-56&#x27;s short path through Oklahoma consists of a diagonal slice across the western part of the Oklahoma Panhandle. US-56/64/412 enter Oklahoma near the southwest corner of the Panhandle, where they also enter Rita Blanca National Grassland. They leave the grassland near Felt. Three miles (4.8 km) southwest of Boise City, US-385 joins the concurrency. The routes then enter Boise City, where they enter a traffic circle around the Cimarron County Courthouse that involves US-56, US-64, US-385, US-412, State Highway 3, and SH-325. After leaving the traffic circle, US-56 overlaps US-64, US-412, and SH-3. east of the courthouse, US-56 meets US-287 at an interchange. US-56/64/412/SH-3 continue northeast for , where US-56 splits to travel northeast on its own.

The route parallels the Cimarron Valley Railroad for the remainder of its time in Oklahoma. Keyes is the next town on US-56, and it also serves as the northern terminus of SH-171 where the two highways intersect. US-56 crosses into Texas County east of Sturgis. Just before crossing the Kansas line, US-56 meets the north end of SH-95. US-56 then enters Kansas on the east edge of Elkhart.

===Kansas===
US-56 enters the state at the Kansas/Oklahoma border near Elkhart. It weaves its way across the state from southwest to northeast, passing through such towns as Dodge City, Great Bend, McPherson, Council Grove, and Baldwin City. It joins with I-35/US-50 east of Gardner, and goes northeast with I-35 into the Kansas City Metro Area. It exits the state as part of Shawnee Mission Parkway in Merriam.

===Missouri===
For one mile (1.6 km) in Kansas City&#x27;s Country Club Plaza, Route 56 follows the noted boulevard Ward Parkway along with 47th St through the Country Club Plaza. The route ends at an intersection with U.S. Route 71. It also includes Blue Parkway and Swope Parkway at certain points.

==History==

In the early 1950s, towns along what was then the K-45 corridor, connecting Ellsworth, Kansas to the Oklahoma state line at Elkhart, formed the Mid-Continent Diagonal Highway Association to push for a new highway from Springer, New Mexico (on US 85) northeast across the Oklahoma Panhandle, along K-45, and continuing to Manitowoc, Wisconsin on Lake Michigan. By mid-1954, it was being promoted as U.S. Route 55 between the Great Lakes and the Southwestern United States. The first submissions to the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) to establish the route were made in 1954; all placed the northeast end at Manitowoc, Wisconsin (absorbing US 151 from Cedar Rapids, Iowa), while they varied on whether the southwest end was to be at Albuquerque, New Mexico or Nogales, Arizona. The first route considered in northeast Kansas was via US 40 from Ellsworth to Topeka and K-4 and US 59 via Atchison to St. Joseph, Missouri. A revised route adopted in March 1955, due to AASHO objections to the original route, which traveled concurrently with other U.S. Highways for over half of its length, followed K-14, K-18, US 24, K-63, K-16, and US 59 via Lincoln and Manhattan. In July, the US 50-N Association proposed a plan that would have eliminated US 50N by routing US 55 along most of its length, from Larned east to Baldwin Junction, and then along US 59 to Lawrence and K-10 to Kansas City; towns on US 50N west of Larned, which would have been bypassed, led a successful fight against this.

However, in September of that year, the Kansas Highway Commission accepted that plan, taking US 55 east to Kansas City. On June 27, 1956, the AASHO Route Numbering Committee considered this refined plan for US 55, between Springer, New Mexico and Kansas City, Missouri, with a short US 155 along the remaining portion of US 50N from Larned west to Garden City. The committee approved the request, but since the proposed route was more east–west than north–south, it changed it to an even number – US 56 – and the spur to US 156.

On June 26, 1958, AASHO denied the New Mexico Department of Transportation&#x27;s request to extend US 56 west from Springer to Santa Fe, which would have followed US 85, US 84 and US 285.
US 56 originally took a different route between Boise City, Oklahoma and Elkhart, Kansas. The original route followed US 64 east to an intersection south of Eva. It then split off to the north towards Elkhart. By 1961, the section north of US 64 had been overlaid with SH-95. The following year, US 56 was rerouted over SH-114, bringing it to its current diagonal path across the Oklahoma Panhandle. The old alignment is still on the Oklahoma highway system as the north half of SH-95.&#x27;

===Herington business loop===

U.S. Route 56 Business (US-56 Bus.) is a short business loop through Herington, Kansas. US-56 begins at US-56 and US-77 south of Herington. At this intersection, there is no access to eastbound US-56 or northbound US-77 from US-56 Bus. and no access to US-56 Bus. from westbound US-56 or southbound US-77. US-56 Bus. heads north through flat lands with scattered trees for then enters Herington. The highway continues for roughly then curves east and becomes Trapp Street. US-56 Bus. then crosses Lime Creek as it continues through the city. After roughly the highway exits the city and reaches its eastern terminus at US-56 and US-77.

US-56 Bus. and US-77 Bus. was approved through Herington in a meeting on October 13, 1979. US-77 Bus. was approved to be decommissioned in a meeting on June 9, 1991, leaving just US-56 Bus..

===Temporary route===

U.S. Route 56 Temporary (US-56 Temp.) was a temporary route of US 56 in Oklahoma. It began on modern US-56 northeast of Boise City, Oklahoma and followed US 64 and SH 3 east to SH 95. It then traveled north along SH 95 to Elkhart, Kansas. The route was approved on July 11, 1956, along existing highways, when the current routing of US-56 was being constructed. By 1962, US 56 was rerouted over SH 114, bringing it to its current diagonal path across the Oklahoma Panhandle.

<text>The karabinek szturmowy wzór 96 &quot;Beryl&quot; (English: &quot;assault rifle pattern 1996 &quot;Beryllium&quot;&quot;, abbreviated kbs wz. 96) is a Polish 5.56mm assault rifle, designed and produced by the Fabryka Broni Radom. The rifle replaced the 5.45×39mm FB Tantal and 7.62×39mm AKM rifles as the standard-issue service rifle of the Polish Armed Forces.

==Development==
Development work on a new service rifle (both a standard and carbine variant) adapted to use the intermediate 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge had been undertaken in 1995, however a functioning 5.56 mm rifle and carbine variant had already been available in Radom since 1991, known as the wz. 1991 (a rechambered wz. 88 Tantal rifle). The new weapon&#x27;s specifications were approved in February 1995 and in December the same year, a prototype production batch consisting of 11 Beryl rifles was produced. In 1997 the weapon had been successfully evaluated and adopted into service as the &quot;5,56 mm karabinek szturmowy wz. 1996&quot; (&quot;assault carbine pattern 1996&quot;).

The Beryl subsequently became the standard Polish rifle. In 2011, there were more than 45,000 in the inventory, accounting for about half of the assault rifles in the Polish Army. On May 25, 2016, FB &quot;Łucznik&quot; Radom announced an order from the Polish Army for 26,000 Beryls and Mini-Beryls, though did not break it down by system.

Apart from Poland, 80 wz. 96A Beryls and 10 wz. 96A Mini Beryls are used by Lithuania (donated in May 2000 by Poland, including 10 rifles with Pallad grenade launcher and 10 rifles with CWL-1 scope with integrated laser rangefinder). Until 2002/2003 they were equipment of a special forces unit SOJ Aitvaras, operating in Afghanistan.

==Design==
The Beryl&#x27;s design layout and system of operation are similar to those of the Tantal rifle, and the principal differences, resulting primarily from using a different cartridge, include the following components: the barrel, receiver housing, buttstock, foregrip, muzzle device, sight system and magazine. With an adapter, it can use the M-16 NATO standard magazine.

The 457 mm-long barrel, has six right-hand grooves and a 228 mm (1:9 in) twist rate. The barrel&#x27;s external profile (from the breech to the front sight base) is identical to the Tantal&#x27;s barrel, but the length from the foresight base has a visible tapered contour with a decreasing diameter towards the muzzle end, used to mount a flash suppressor.

The flash hider can be used to mount and launch rifle grenades. The flash hider has a slight taper at the front that supports a bayonet and a little further to the rear – six side ports arranged in pairs. These ports are placed asymmetrically around the circumference of the flash hider and stabilize the weapon during continuous fire. Internally the flash suppressor features threading at the muzzle used to screw-in a blank firing attachment. Located mid-length on the flash hider is a cut-out with a ring retainer spring that secures a rifle grenade to the barrel.

The receiver housing contains several modifications over the receiver of the wz. 1988 rifle. It uses a reinforced rear stock trunnion, adapted for the new shoulder stock and a top-mounted Picatinny rail for mounting optical sights.

The side-folding tubular metal stock is coated with a thermal polymer shrink film. It has a metal shoulder stop covered with a rubber recoil pad. More recent models come with a collapsible stock (see picture of wz. 2004 model on right side of page).

The standard lower handguard features an angled rib pattern designed to enhance gripping by the support hand. The rear of the handguard features two molded notches that enable the 40 mm wz. 1974 grenade launcher to be mounted under the barrel (early versions of the wz. 1996 lacked these notches, fitted instead with handguards with lateral grooves). Some Beryl handguards are equipped with short Picatinny rails and an integral vertical foregrip.

The Beryl&#x27;s sighting system is very similar to the setup used on the Tantal, it does however differ with the addition of twin cuts made into the sides of rear sight base that are used to fasten a bracket for mounting the following optical sights: the passive PCS-6 night sight, a CK-3 reflex optical collimator (red dot sight), LKA-4 telescopic sight and CWL-1 scope with integrated laser rangefinder. However, the most used additional sight for Beryl is EOTech 552 holographic weapon sight and PCS-5M passive night sight. PCS-6 and CWL-1 are introduced in small number.

The weapon&#x27;s unique magazine is molded from plastic and is not interchangeable with magazines from the kbk wz. 1988 Tantal.

The Beryl has a long, trapezoid-shaped safety switch, similar to those found on the AK-47 or almost all of the AK series, but unlike the archetype, it does not act as a fire selector (its function is performed by a separate switch on the other side of the receiver).

The Beryl fires 5.56×45mm ammunition with a steel-core standard round, a tracer cartridge and a training slug, which are produced by Zakłady Metalowe Mesko in the town of Skarżysko-Kamienna.

Standard equipment shipped with the rifle includes: three spare magazines, four 15-round stripper clips, a stripper clip guide, bayonet, cleaning kit, lubricant bottle, cleaning rod (two-piece, stored in the cleaning kit pouch), sling, a magazine pouch and bipod. The rifle can also be fitted with a mounting system for optical sights and a blank-firing adaptor.

The Beryl was used to create a carbine variant known as the Mini-Beryl.

==Variants==

* kbs wz. 96A Beryl (1996): standard version of Beryl, the most produced version for Polish Forces, some examples were equipped with POPC I rail, where Polish sights (CWL-1, CK-3, LKA-4, PCS-6) could be mounted, but most mounted rail is POPC III. In Iraq, some Beryls were modified in the field and received wooden foregrip from PM md. 63
* kbs wz. 96B Beryl (2004): same as standard version, but with fixed foregrip and rails on it. Also, &quot;B&quot; version gets new rail, POPC II (short) and POPC III (long) which subtended the Picatinny standard (however, some &quot;B&quot; Beryls get POPC I rail).
* kbs wz. 96C Beryl (2009): version with new buttstock (which is fixed and telescopic), new rails (POPC IV), new handguard, magazines and new foregrip.
* kbs wz. 96D Beryl: an option available by the manufacturer, which allows to freely complete the rifle from elements of versions A, B and C
*Beryl M545 (2011): proposed 5.45×39mm export variant
*Beryl M762 (2013): &quot;C&quot; export variant chambered to fire 7.62×39mm ammunition. Bought by Nigeria.

==Users==

* : 90 units of which 80 are wz. 96A in use by special forces and recon units (10 with wz. 74 Pallad grenade launcher and 10 with CWL-1 telescopic sight with laser pointer) and 10 are wz. 96 Mini-Beryl variant. Until 2003 used by SOJ Aitvaras elite special forces unit in Afghanistan.
* : 3,200 M762 rifles (in March 2018, the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria signed a letter of intent to manufacture the rifles in Nigeria)

<text>Drop the Beat is a Canadian television series produced by Back Alley Film Productions that aired on CBC Television in 2000 and 2001. A short-run dramatic series, the show was one of the first television series in the world centred around hip hop music and culture.

A spinoff of the earlier CBC teen drama series &quot;Straight Up&quot;, the show starred Mark Taylor as Jeff and Merwin Mondesir as Dennis, the hosts of a hip hop show on CIBJ-FM, a fictional campus radio station in Toronto, Ontario. Michie Mee also starred as Divine, a rapper who was part of Jeff and Dennis&#x27; crew, and Ingrid Veninger played the station manager. The supporting cast also included Arlene Duncan, Vanessa Ford, Jennifer Baxter, Jason Harrow, Shamann Williams and Omari Forrester.

The use of a campus radio station was a deliberate reflection of Canadian reality — until Toronto&#x27;s Flow 93.5 hit the airwaves in early 2001, Canada did not have any radio stations dedicated specifically to urban music.

==Production==
As a tie-in to help promote emerging hip hop musicians, the series released a soundtrack album in conjunction with the first season, featuring artists such as Maestro Fresh Wes, Infinite, Frankie Ano, Bahamadia, Ja Rule, Black Child, Choclair, Rahzel, Jully Black and Erykah Badu.

The show was also released as one of the first &quot;interactive&quot; dramatic television series on WebTV. Viewers on that platform could call up character biographies, post messages on an interactive user forum, or buy the soundtrack album through embedded sales links.

Episode directors included John Greyson, Paul Fox, Daniel Grou, Eleanore Lindo, T. W. Peacocke, Frances-Anne Solomon and Sudz Sutherland.

==Awards==
The series received two Gemini Award nominations for Best Dramatic Series, at the 15th Gemini Awards in 2000 and at the 16th Gemini Awards in 2001. Sutherland received a nomination for Best Writing in a Drama Series in 2000 for the episode &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, and Taylor received a nomination for Best Actor in a Drama Series in 2001.

<text>The 35th Infantry Division, formerly known as the 35th Division, is an infantry formation of the United States Army National Guard headquartered at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

The 35th Division was organized 25 August 1917, at Camp Doniphan, Oklahoma, as a unit of the National Guard, with troops from Missouri and Kansas. It was inactivated in 1919, but the division headquarters was reconstituted in 1935 and it served with a brief interruption until it was inactivated again in 1963. The division was reactivated and the headquarters and headquarters company federally recognized on 25 August 1984, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

==Shoulder sleeve insignia==

The division&#x27;s shoulder patch, a Santa Fe cross in a circle, was conceived as a marking for division vehicles and baggage in 1918, and was first promulgated by 35th Division General Orders Number 25, issued on 27 March 1918. It was officially approved for the 35th Division on 29 October 1918 by the adjutant general of the American Expeditionary Force. The marking was later stenciled onto signs identifying the whereabouts of division units, soldiers&#x27; helmets, and finally was made into a shoulder sleeve insignia when that usage was authorized.

Twenty-four distinct combinations of quadrant and border colors were devised for all of the 35th Division&#x27;s units. Each major unit of the 35th Division (the division headquarters and headquarters troop and the 128th Machine Gun Battalion, the 110th Field Signal Battalion, 110th Ammunition, 110th Sanitary, and 110th Supply Trains, the 110th Engineer Regiment and Train, the 69th Infantry Brigade, the 70th Infantry Brigade, and the 60th Field Artillery Brigade) was respectively identified by one of six border colors: blue, green, white, yellow, black, or red. The component units each had their own combination of quadrant colors, consisting of one or two of the aforementioned. Patches varied widely in exact design and material.

Postwar, the wide variety of color combinations was done away with, and the insignia to be worn by all division personnel was simplified to consist of a white Santa Fe cross on a blue background with an olive drab border, although colored insignia continued in limited use in certain cases until the 1930s.

===Actions during World War I===
The 35th Division was originally constituted by the Militia Bureau in early 1917 as the 14th Division, made up of troops from Kansas and Missouri. On 18 July 1917, the War Department directed the organization of the unit, now redesignated the 35th Division, and on 5 August, the National Guard was drafted into federal service. Concentration of divisional troops at Camp Doniphan, near Fort Sill, Oklahoma, began in late August, and training began on 8 September. During October, about 3,000 draftees from Camp Funston, Kansas, most of whom were from Kansas and Missouri, joined the division, and in spring 1918, more men came from Camp Funston, Camp Travis, Texas, and Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. On 2 April 1917, the division moved from Camp Mills, New York, and Camp Merritt, New Jersey, to the Brooklyn, Hoboken, New York, and Philadelphia Ports of Embarkation, where it received approximately 2,000 replacements to bring it to full strength. Elements of the division sailed for England and France from 16 April to 8 June 1918, with the elements that landed in England (Southampton and Liverpool) moving shortly to Le Havre, France.

The 35th served first, a brigade at a time, in the Vosges mountains between 30 June and 13 August. The whole division served in the Gérardmer sector, Alsace, 14 August to 1 September. Having undergone a number of command changes at multiple echelons and arms of service on short notice, the division was committed during the opening stages of the Meuse-Argonne offensive, 21 to 30 September. Despite making good progress on its first day, the division&#x27;s operations became more and more disorganized as communications and command difficulties combined with increasingly heavy losses fighting across no man&#x27;s land towards entrenched German fighting positions. The division was shortly withdrawn from the front for fear of complete collapse and replaced with the 1st Division. American historian Robert Hugh Ferrell wrote about the 35th Division&#x27;s experience in the Meuse-Argonne in his 2004 book &quot;Collapse at Meuse-Argonne: The Failure of the Missouri-Kansas Division&quot;. The division next served in the Sommedieue sector, 15 October to 6 November. During its combat service, the 35th Division spent ninety-two days in quiet sectors and five in active, advanced twelve and one-half kilometers against resistance, captured 781 prisoners, and lost 1,067 men killed and 6,216 wounded. The 35th Division had, as an officer, Captain Harry S. Truman, future 33rd President of the United States, who commanded Battery D of the 129th Field Artillery Regiment.

==Interwar period==

Pursuant to the 1920 amendments to the National Defense Act of 1916, the 35th Division was reconstituted in the National Guard in 1921, allotted to the states of Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska of the Seventh Corps Area, and assigned to the VII Corps. In the postwar reorganization of the Army&#x27;s infantry divisions, they only had two regiments of horse-drawn 75 mm guns, with truck-drawn 155 mm howitzers initially assigned as corps and army artillery because of the belief that they were too tactically immobile. As early as 1922, the Nebraska National Guard found it impossible to organize the VII Corps&#x27; 127th Field Artillery Regiment because of a lack of funding and armory space. When suitable modifications were made to the 155 mm howitzer as part of the Army&#x27;s motorization of field artillery in the early 1930s to allow for high-speed truck traction, 155 mm howitzer regiments were returned to divisions; the 142nd Field Artillery Regiment, a partially-organized General Headquarters Reserve (GHQR) 75 mm gun unit from Arkansas, was converted to 155 mm howitzers and assigned to the 35th Division on 13 July 1931 in lieu of the 127th Field Artillery.

In the 1920s and 1930s, constituent units of the division performed routine training within their respective states as well as various activities policing labor troubles and effecting disaster relief. Arkansas units trained at Camp Pike (later renamed Camp Joseph T. Robinson), Arkansas, Fort Riley, Kansas, near Junction City, or at Fort Sill; Kansas units trained at Fort Riley; Missouri units at Camp Clark, near Nevada, Missouri; Nebraska units at Camp Ashland, near Ashland, Nebraska. Because of continued disputes between the states allotted for the division, the 35th Division commander and his staff were not organized and federally recognized until 1932-1933. Beginning in the summer of 1933, the division staff assembled at Fort Riley for consolidated staff training and did so for the next two years. In the fall of 1935, the staff participated in the Fourth Army command post exercise at Fort Lewis, Washington, and went to camp at Ashland, Nebraska, the following summer. Due to limited funding, all the units of the 35th Division did not gather together in one place for training until the Seventh Corps Area concentration of the Fourth Army maneuvers at Fort Riley, in 1937. In 1938, 180 Organized Reserve officers of the 89th and 102nd Divisions were also provided with training by the division. The division also concentrated at Camp Ripley, Minnesota, during the Fourth Army maneuvers in 1940.

With the conversion of National Guard cavalry divisions to other types of units in 1940, Kansas&#x27; 114th Cavalry Regiment was converted and redesignated as the 127th Field Artillery Regiment and assigned to the 35th Division, and the 142nd Field Artillery Regiment was relieved from the division on 1 October 1940.

==World War II==

===Federalization===

The 35th Division was ordered into federal service on 23 December 1940 at home stations. The division&#x27;s units were ordered to report to Camp Joseph T. Robinson, Arkansas, and had arrived by the end of January, 1941. The incomplete ranks of the 35th were swelled by thousands of draftees, a large portion of whom were from Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, through a War Department arrangement to fill the balance of National Guard units ordered into federal service with men from their home states or corps areas insofar as was possible. After completing the War Department-mandated divisional training program, the 35th Division maneuvered against other units in Arkansas and Louisiana in the fall of 1941. In August 1941, the division was redesignated the 35th Infantry Division. After the Pearl Harbor attack came its first assignment, the defense of the Southern California Sector of the Western Defense Command.

====Reorganization====

On 3 February 1942, the War Department ordered that the 35th Division be &quot;triangularized&quot; at the earliest practicable date. The 138th Infantry Regiment departed, assigned to GHQ. The division&#x27;s infantry and field artillery brigade headquarters were eliminated, and the engineer, field artillery, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized as battalions. The reorganization was completed on 1 March 1942. On 27 January 1943, the 140th Infantry Regiment was relieved from the division, and was replaced by the 320th Infantry Regiment.

===Further training===

The division departed California for Camp Rucker, Alabama, arriving on 1 April 1943. After participating in the Second Army Tennessee Maneuvers from 22 November 1943 to 17 January 1944 and receiving mountain warfare training at the West Virginia Maneuver Area from 21 February to 28 March 1944, the 35th Infantry Division was declared ready for overseas service. Further movement to Camp Butner, North Carolina, and Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, saw the division through to England, where it arrived on 25 May 1944.

===Commanders===
* Major General Ralph E. Truman (October 1938 – October 1941)
* Major General William H. Simpson (October 1941 – April 1942)
* Major General Maxwell Murray (May 1942 – January 1943)
* Major General Paul W. Baade (January 1943 to inactivation)

===Actions during World War II===
The 35th Infantry Division arrived in England on 25 May 1944 and received further training. It landed on Omaha Beach, Normandy 5–7 July 1944 and entered combat on 11 July, fighting in the Normandy hedgerows north of St. Lo. The division turned away twelve German counterattacks at Emelie before entering St. Lo on 18 July. After mopping up in the St. Lo area, it took part in the offensive action southwest of St. Lo, pushing the Germans across the Vire River on 2 August, and breaking out of the Cotentin Peninsula. While en route to an assembly area, the division was &quot;flagged off the road,&quot; to secure the Mortain-Avranches corridor and to rescue the 30th Division&#x27;s &quot;Lost Battalion&quot; August 7–13, 1944.

Then racing across France through Orleans and Sens, the division attacked across the Moselle on 13 September, captured Nancy on 15 September, secured Chambrey on 1 October, and drove on to the German border, taking Sarreguemines and crossing the Saar on 8 December. After crossing the Blies River on 12 December, the division moved to Metz for rest and rehabilitation on 19 December. The 35th moved to Arlon, Belgium December 25–26, and took part in the fighting to relieve Bastogne, throwing off the attacks of four German divisions, taking Villers-laBonne-Eau on 10 January, after a 13-day fight and Lutrebois in a 5-day engagement. On 18 January 1945, the division returned to Metz to resume its interrupted rest.

In late January, the division was defending the Foret de Domaniale area. Moving to the Netherlands to hold a defensive line along the Roer on 22 February, the division attacked across the Roer on 23 February, pierced the Siegfried Line, reached the Rhine at Wesel on 10 March, and crossed 25–26 March. It smashed across the Herne Canal and reached the Ruhr River early in April, when it was ordered to move to the Elbe April 12. Making the 295-mile dash in two days, the 35th mopped up in the vicinity of Colbitz and Angern, until 26 April 1945 when it moved to Hanover for occupational and mopping-up duty, continuing occupation beyond VE-day. The division left Southampton, England, on 5 September, and arrived in New York City on 10 September 1945.

==Cold War to present==

On 7 December 1945, the division was inactivated at Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky. During the next year and into 1947, the division was reestablished as a Kansas and Missouri National Guard division. In 1954 the division consisted of the 137th (Kansas), 138th (Missouri), and 140th Infantry Regiments (Missouri); 127th, 128th, 129th, and 154th Field Artillery Battalions; the 135th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion; the 135th Tank Battalion; and signals, engineer, reconnaissance, military police, other combat support units, plus combat service support units. After the Pentomic reorganization, the division&#x27;s five battle groups were the 1-137 Infantry; 2-137 Infantry; 1-138 Infantry; 2-138 Infantry; and 1-140 Infantry. In 1963, the division was inactivated, along with the 34th, 43rd, and 51st Infantry Divisions.

In early 1983, the Army began the process of reestablishing the division as a mechanized infantry formation to be made up of Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Nebraska National Guard units. The division headquarters was established 30 September 1983, at Fort Leavenworth. The division was formally reactivated as the 35th Infantry Division (Mechanized) on 25 August 1984 around a nucleus of the 67th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) from Nebraska, the 69th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) from Kansas, and the 149th Armored Brigade from Kentucky. It continues in service today.

In 1984–85, the 69th Infantry Brigade was reported to consist of the following units:

*1st Battalion, 137th Infantry
*2nd Battalion, 137th Infantry
*1st Battalion, 635th Armor
*1st Battalion, 127th Field Artillery
*Troop E, 114th Cavalry
*169th Engineer Company.


Isby and Kamps also wrote at the same time that the 110th Engineer Battalion, in Missouri, might be assigned as the divisional engineers (p383); however, this did not occur. Actually, the divisional engineer battalion, the 206th Engineer Battalion, was organized in the Kentucky Army National Guard on 1 November 1985.

The divisional aviation brigade headquarters was organized in the Kentucky Army National Guard on 15 September 1986. On 1 October 1987 the division&#x27;s aviation units were reorganized, and the 135th Aviation was established. Two battalions of the 135th joined the division&#x27;s aviation component.

<doc id="889014" wikidata="Q38421" url="?curid=889014" title="Schnauzer">
<text>A Schnauzer ( , ; plural , ; ) is a dog breed type that originated in Germany from the 14th to 16th centuries. The term comes from the German word for &quot;snout&quot; and means colloquially &quot;moustache&quot;, or &quot;whiskered snout&quot;, because of the dog&#x27;s distinctively bearded snout. Initially it was called Wire-Haired Pinscher, while Schnauzer was adopted in 1879.

==Breeds==
There are three breeds: the Standard, the Giant, and the Miniature. Toy and teacup are not breeds of Schnauzer, but these common terms are used to market undersized or ill-bred Miniature Schnauzers. The original Schnauzer was of the same size as the modern Standard Schnauzer breed and was bred as a rat-catcher and guard dog. The Giant Schnauzer and the Miniature Schnauzer were developed from the Standard Schnauzer and are the result of outcrosses with other breeds exhibiting the desirable characteristics needed for the Schnauzer&#x27;s original purpose. By the VDH and FCI Schnauzer is placed in &quot;Group 2, Section 1: Pinschers and Schnauzers&quot;, with &quot;Nr. 181, 182 and 183&quot; in &quot;Section 1.2: Schnauzer&quot; dedicated to all three Schnauzer breeds.

* Standard Schnauzers (also known as Mittelschnauzers) are around tall at the shoulder and weigh . They are in the group of working dogs, bred as multifunctional dogs to catch rats and other rodents, as livestock and guard dogs, and later they have also carried messages in times of war, helped the Red Cross and been police dogs. It is considered to have a common ancestry with the German Pinscher as a wire-haired coated variant of the Pinscher breed, and was possibly crossed with black German Poodle and gray Wolfspitz, to which influence is attributed the black soft coat and the salt-and-pepper gray wiry coat.
* Giant Schnauzers (also known as Riesenschnauzers) are around tall at the shoulder and weigh between . They are working dogs that were developed in Swabia in the 17th century, once known as the Munich Schnauzer, originally bred to drive livestock to market and guard farms, and later used as police and military dogs. The cynologists believe that the Giant Schnauzer was developed independently through crosses of black Great Danes, Munchener German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Boxers, Bouvier des Flandres, Thuringian Shepherds, and the Standard Schnauzer.
* Miniature Schnauzers (also known as Zwergschnauzers) are around tall at the shoulder and weigh between . They were developed since the late 19th century, and the cynologists consider that the Miniature Schnauzer is the result of crossing the original Standard Schnauzer with a smaller breed like the Affenpinscher, and Miniature Poodle. The Miniature Schnauzer is classified as a utility (UK, Australia, New Zealand) or terrier group (U.S., Canada), however, they are not related to the terrier group as do not have the typical terrier temperament, coat, shape of head and body. The American Kennel Club (AKC) approves salt-and-pepper gray, black, and black and silver as acceptable coat colors for a Miniature Schnauzer. They are also bred in pure white or even parti-colored, but neither is approved by the AKC. In 2004, the Miniature Schnauzer accounted for 2.4% of proportion of purebred dogs registered by the AKC.

==Genetics==

In a 2004, population genetics study of 85 purebred dogs, which used cluster-based methods with four identified genetic clusters, all three Schnauzer breeds structurally mostly clustered within &quot;recent European descent, largely terriers and hounds&quot; cluster, with a smaller percent within &quot;working breeds&quot; and &quot;mastiff-type breeds&quot; clusters, while the &quot;Asian breeds/ancient hounds and spitz-type breed&quot; cluster was present among Giant Schnauzers. In a 2007 Collie eye anomaly study of 638 dogs from 132 distinct breeds, with five specimens of each Schnauzer breed size, in the population structure of the microsatellite analysis they mostly clustered in the &quot;hunting group&quot; rather than the &quot;mastiff/terrier group&quot;. In a 2010 GWAS study using more than 48,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of 915 dogs from 85 breeds, Standard and Giant Schnauzers made a separate phylogenetic tree branch clustered among &quot;modern&quot; breeds (e.g., &quot;working dogs&quot;), and not the &quot;small terrier&quot;/&quot;mastiff-terrier&quot; cluster, sharing genetic closeness with the Doberman Pinscher, the German Shepherd Dog and the Portuguese Water Dog.

In the most recent 2017 WGS study of 1,346 dogs from 161 breeds, Standard and Miniature Schnauzers made one separate phylogenetic clade of 23 clades and formed a unique broader clade in which they share common ancestry with spitz-type breeds such as the American Eskimo Dog, the Pomeranian and the Volpino Italiano, as well as the Schipperke, the Papillon, the Brussels Griffon and the Pug. Although the Giant Schnauzer shares a haplotype with the other two Schnauzer breeds, it made a phylogentic node in a separate clade, sharing common ancestry with the Black Russian Terrier, the Rottweiler and the Doberman Pinscher. In another 2017 WGS study researching the genetic variants for the development of short tails among dog breeds, the sampled (Miniature) Schnauzer and Rottweiler have &quot;short tail phenotype caused by the unknown genetic factors&quot; and &quot;are predicted to have developed short tail independently&quot;.

==Description==
The breed is of above average intelligence and can be independent minded, so early training and diverse daily exercise are recommended. Based on Stanley Coren&#x27;s book &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot; (2006) ranking methodology, the Miniature ranked 12th, Standard 18th, and Giant 28th out of 140 breeds within 79 ranks on the ability to learn and obey new commands, e.g., working and obedience intelligence. The first two were grouped among &quot;excellent working dogs&quot;, while the Giant among &quot;above-average working dogs&quot;. Additionally, experts ranked the Miniature as 5th among top 15 breeds at watchdog barking ability, the Giant as 6th among top 13 breeds at effective guard ability, while in adaptive intelligence all three breeds showed good problem-solving abilities. They are protective and energetic, and will alert members of the household to any potential danger, although its watchful nature can lead to persistent barking. To avoid annoying the neighbors, dog owners should make every effort to curb excessive barking through training.

Schnauzers have distinctive beards and long, feathery eyebrows. They are generally either a salt and pepper colour, black, or white, but they can be brown also. Some owners shave their Schnauzers down the back while the hairs on their legs are kept long and curly, but this may change the coat colour, so show Schnauzers especially will have their back coat &quot;stripped&quot; by hand, to encourage the salt and pepper pattern to emerge. It was traditional to have the tails docked and the ears cropped to give an alert appearance, but in many countries it is now illegal. For working dogs that are ratters, these procedures don&#x27;t give the rat anything to grab on to when being attacked and therefore cannot fight back. Cropping and docking are now illegal in the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand, and are becoming less common elsewhere. The Schnauzer&#x27;s beard and leg hair should be brushed often to prevent mats from forming.

Schnauzers have a double coat. The top or guard coat is wiry and water-resistant, while the undercoat is soft. Stripping removes the undercoat and stimulates the hard top coat to come in fuller. The undercoat may be &quot;stripped&quot; (loose, dead hair is plucked) at least twice a year. A stripped Schnauzer will have a hard wiry coat as described in the breed standard. A shaved pet will lose the wiry top coat and only exhibit the soft undercoat. Schnauzers shed less often than most dogs.

==Health==
Schnauzers are prone to hepatobiliary disease. One study found the schnauzer to be 8.06 times more likely to acquire a reversive hepatocelluar injury (liver damage secondary to an endocrinopathy such as Cushing&#x27;s syndrome and hypothyroidism), 10.7 times more likely to acquire impaired hepatic perfusion, and 16.29 times more likely to acquire gall bladder mucocele.

<doc id="889020" wikidata="Q727018" url="?curid=889020" title="Incorporation (linguistics)">
<text>In linguistics, incorporation is a phenomenon by which a grammatical category, such as a verb, forms a compound with its direct object (object incorporation) or adverbial modifier, while retaining its original syntactic function. The inclusion of a noun qualifies the verb, narrowing its scope rather than making reference to a specific entity.

Incorporation is central to many polysynthetic languages such as those found in North America, Siberia and northern Australia. However, polysynthesis does not necessarily imply incorporation (Mithun 2009), and the presence of incorporation does not imply that the language is polysynthetic.

==Examples of incorporation==
===English===
Although incorporation does not occur regularly, English uses it sometimes: &quot;breastfeed&quot;, and direct object incorporation, as in &quot;babysit&quot;. Etymologically, such verbs in English are usually back-formations: the verbs &quot;breastfeed&quot; and &quot;babysit&quot; are formed from the adjective &quot;breast-fed&quot; and the noun &quot;babysitter&quot; respectively. Incorporation and plain compounding may be fuzzy categories: consider &quot;backstabbing&quot;, &quot;name-calling&quot;, &quot;axe murder&quot;.

=== Oneida ===
The following example from Oneida (Iroquoian) illustrates noun incorporation.

In this example, the verbal root &quot;hninu&quot; appears with its usual verbal morphology: a factive marker (FACT), which very roughly translates as past tense, although this is not quite accurate; an agreement marker (1.SG), which tells us that the verb agrees with 1st person singular (the speaker); and an aspect marker, punctual (PUNC), which tells us that this is a completed event. The direct object &quot;ne kanaktaʼ&quot; follows the verb. The function of the particle &quot;ne&quot; is to determine the bed: in the example, I bought this specific bed. The word for bed consists of a root &quot;nakt&quot; plus a prefix and a suffix. The notion of the root is important here, but the properties of the prefix and suffix do not matter for this discussion.

In the following sentence, the bed is unspecified. Unspecified nouns can be incorporated, thus creating a general statement. In this example: I bought a bed (and not a specific bed). In a broader sense, depending on context, it can even mean that I am a bed buyer, as in: I am a trader of beds, buying beds is my profession.

In this example, the root for bed &quot;nakt&quot; has &quot;incorporated&quot; into the verbal construction and appears before the verbal root. Two other incidental changes are noticed here. First, the agreement marker in the first example is &quot;k&quot; and in the second example is &quot;ke&quot;. These are two phonologically-conditioned allomorphs. In other words, the choice between using &quot;k&quot; and &quot;ke&quot; is based on the other sounds in the word (and has nothing to do with noun incorporation). Also, there is an epenthetic vowel &quot;a&quot; between the nominal and verbal roots. This vowel is inserted to break up an illegal consonant cluster (and also has nothing to do with noun incorporation).

===Panare===
The next example, from Panare, illustrates the cross-linguistically common phenomenon that the incorporated form of a noun may be significantly different from its unincorporated form. The first sentence contains the incorporated form &quot;u&#x27;&quot; of &quot;head&quot;, and the second its unincorporated form &quot;ipu&quot;:

===Chukchi===
Chukchi, a Chukotko-Kamchatkan language spoken in North Eastern Siberia, provides a wealth of examples of noun incorporation. The phrase &quot;təpelarkən qoraŋə&quot; means &quot;I&#x27;m leaving the reindeer&quot; and has two words (the verb in the first person singular, and the noun). The same idea can be expressed with the single word &quot;təqorapelarkən&quot;, in which the noun root &quot;qora-&quot; &quot;reindeer&quot; is incorporated into the verb word.

===Mohawk===
Mohawk, an Iroquoian language, makes heavy use of incorporation, as in: &quot;watia&#x27;tawi&#x27;tsherí:io&quot; &quot;it is a good shirt&quot;, where the noun root &quot;atia&#x27;tawi&quot; &quot;upper body garment&quot; is present inside the verb.

===Cheyenne===
Cheyenne, an Algonquian language of the plains, also uses noun incorporation on a regular basis. Consider &quot;nátahpe&#x27;emaheona&quot;, meaning &quot;I have a big house&quot;, which contains the noun morpheme &quot;maheo&quot; &quot;house&quot;.

===Chinese (Mandarin)===
Chinese makes extensive use of &quot;verb-object compounds&quot;, which are compounds composed of two constituents having the syntactic relation of verb and its direct object. For example, the verb &#x27;sleep (VO)&#x27; is composed of the verb &#x27;sleep (V)&#x27; and the bound morpheme object &#x27;sleep (N)&#x27;. Aspect markers (e.g. PERFECTIVE), classifier phrases (e.g. THREE + CL + hours), and other elements may separate the two constituents of these compounds, though different verb-object compounds vary in degree of separability.

==Semantics of noun incorporation==
In many cases, a phrase with an incorporated noun carries a different meaning with respect to the equivalent phrase where the noun is not incorporated into the verb. The difference seems to hang around the generality and definiteness of the statement. The incorporated phrase is usually generic and indefinite, while the non-incorporated one is more specific.

In Yucatec Maya, for example, the phrase &quot;I chopped a tree&quot;, when the word for &quot;tree&quot; is incorporated, changes its meaning to &quot;I chopped wood&quot;. In Lahu (a Tibeto-Burman language), the definite phrase &quot;I drink the liquor&quot; becomes the more general &quot;I drink liquor&quot; when &quot;liquor&quot; is incorporated. The Japanese phrase 目を覚ます &quot;me o samasu&quot; means &quot;to wake up&quot; or literally &quot;to wake (one&#x27;s) eyes&quot;. But when the direct object is incorporated into the nominal form of the verb, the resulting noun 目覚まし &quot;mezamashi&quot; literally means &quot;waking up&quot;, as in 目覚まし時計　&quot;mezamashidokei&quot; meaning &quot;alarm clock.&quot;

This tendency is not a rule. There are languages where noun incorporation does not produce a meaning change (though it may cause a change in syntax — as explained below).

==Syntax of noun incorporation==

=== What is noun incorporation? ===
An influential definition of noun incorporation (NI) by Sapir (1911) and Mithun (1984) has stated that NI is “a construction in which a noun and a verb stem combine to yield a complex verb.” Due to the wide variation in how noun incorporation presents itself in different languages, however, it is difficult to create an agreed upon and all-encompassing definition. As a result, most syntacticians have focused on generating definitions that apply to the languages they have studied, regardless of whether or not they are cross-linguistically attested.

Noun incorporation can interact with the transitivity of the verb it applies to in two different ways. In some languages, the incorporated noun deletes one of the arguments of the verb, and this is shown explicitly: if the verb is transitive, the derived verb word with an incorporated noun (which functions as the direct object) becomes formally intransitive and is marked as such. In other languages this change does not take place, or at least it is not shown by explicit morphology. A recent study found out that across languages, morphosyntactically highly transitive verbs and patientive intransitive verbs are most likely to perform noun incorporation.

Incorporation looks at whether verb arguments, its nominal complements, exist on the same syntactic level or not. Incorporation is characterized as a stem combination meaning it combines independent lexical items into a modal or auxiliary verb to ultimately form a complex verb. The stem of the verb will be the determiner of the new category in which the incorporation belongs and the noun which was incorporated drops its own categorical features and grammatical markings, if employed. This is done by the movement of the incorporated noun to its new position in syntax. When participating in noun incorporation, it allows for the speaker to represent an alternative expression to further explain and shift focus to the information being presented (Mithun 1984).

Although incorporation exists in many languages, incorporation is optional and non-obligatory. Incorporation is restricted to certain noun categories; namely on the degree to which they are animate or alive or suppletive forms.

If a language participates in productive compounding it does not allow for incorporation. An example of a compounding language is German. Respectively, if a language participates in incorporation it does not allow for productive compounding.

The most common type of NI is where the incorporated noun acts as the notional subject of the clause. This can be observed in Onondaga, Southern Tiwa and Koryak.

=== Types of noun incorporation ===
In 1985, Mithun introduced a four-type system to define the functionality and progression of noun incorporation in a language. This system is important as many discuss this, and it is widely applied to explain the differences in NI in languages. The four types are:

# Lexical compounding: involves a verb incorporating a nominal argument. The resulting compound usually describes a noteworthy or recurring activity. The noun in these compounds are not commonly marked for definiteness or number. 
# Manipulation of case roles: The second type uses the same process to manipulate case roles, incorporating the argument into the verb to allow for a new argument to take its place.
# Manipulation of discourse structure: The third type uses noun incorporation to background old or established information. A speaker might explicitly mention an entity once, for example, and thereafter refer to it using an incorporated verbal compound. This kind of noun incorporation is usually seen in polysynthetic languages. 
# Classificatory Incorporation: The fourth and final type proposed by Mithun involves the development of a set of classificatory compounds, in which verbs are paired with generic nouns to describe properties of an entity, rather than the entity itself.

According to Mithun, languages exhibiting any of these types always display all of the lower types as well. This seems to imply a pattern of progression, as Mithun describes in her 1984 paper on the evolution of noun incorporation. It is argued that it is necessary to distinguish at least two types of noun incorporation.

=== Accounts for noun incorporation ===

A large field of inquiry addresses whether NI is a syntactic process (verb and noun originate in different nodes and come together through syntactic means), a lexical process (word-formation rules that apply in the lexicon dictate NI), or a combined process (entailing the investigation of which aspects of noun incorporation can be productively created through general syntactic rules and which must be specified in the lexicon). Of course, this will vary from one case to another, as some languages—primarily those labelled as polysynthetic—allow for incorporated structures in a wide variety of sentences, whereas in others—such as English—this incorporation is more limited. Theories of morphology-syntax interaction and the debate between syntactic and lexical accounts of NI should strive to be restrictive enough to account for the stable properties of NI in a unified way, but also account for language-specific variations. Within this section, we will focus on describing the influential syntactic and combined approaches to NI, though it is important to note that highly-influential lexical accounts, such as Rosen&#x27;s (1989) paper, do exist.

One highly-influential syntactic account for NI is the head-movement process proposed by Baker (1988). This account states that this NI head movement is distinct from but similar to the better-established phenomenon of phrase movement and involves the movement of a head noun out of object position and into a position where it adjoins to a governing verb. An example of this movement can be seen in figure 1 where the head noun &#x27;baby&#x27; is moved out of the object N position to become incorporated with the verb as the sister to the verb &#x27;sit&#x27;. While this theory does not account for every language, it does provide a starting point for subsequent syntactic analyses of NI, both with and without head movement. A more recent paper by Baker (2007) addresses a number of other influential accounts including Massam’s pseudo-incorporation, Van Geenhoven’s base generation, and Koopman and Szabolcsi’s small-phrase movement. It was concluded that while each have their strong points, they all fail to answer some important questions, thus requiring the continued use of Baker&#x27;s head-movement account.

Others, including Barrrie and Mattieu (2016), have argued against Baker’s  headmovement hypothesis. They have investigated Onondaga and Ojibwe and proposed that phrasal movement rather than head movement can account for NI in a number of languages (including Mohawk).

=== Examples from different languages ===

==== Polysynthetic languages ====
A polysynthetic language is one in which multiple morphemes, including affixes, are often present within a single word. Each word can therefore express the meaning of a full clause or phrase; this structure has implications on how noun incorporation is manifested in the languages in which it is observed.

===== Lakhota =====
In Lakhota, a Siouan language of the plains, for example, the phrase &quot;the man is chopping wood&quot; can be expressed either as a transitive &quot;wičháša kiŋ čháŋ kiŋ kaksáhe&quot; (&quot;man the wood the chopping&quot;) or as an intransitive &quot;wičháša kiŋ čhaŋkáksahe&quot; (&quot;man the wood-chopping&quot;) in which the independent nominal &quot;čháŋ&quot;, &quot;wood&quot;, becomes a root incorporated into the verb: &quot;wood-chopping&quot;.

===== Mohawk =====
Mohawk is an Iroquoian language in which noun incorporation occurs. NI is a very salient property of Northern Iroquoian languages, including Mohawk, and is seen unusually often in comparison to other languages. Noun incorporation in Mohawk involves the compounding of a noun stem with a verb stem to form a new verb stem.
Only the noun stem is incorporated into the verb in NI, not the whole noun word.

Mohawk grammar allows for whole propositions to be expressed by one word, which is classified as a verb. Other core elements, namely nouns (subjects, objects, etc.), can be incorporated into the verb. Well-formed verb phrases contain at the bare minimum a verb root and a pronominal prefix. The rest of the elements (and therefore noun incorporation) are optional.
In the examples below, one can see the original sentence in 1a and the same sentence with noun incorporation into the verb in 1b, where instead of &quot;bought a bed&quot;, the literal translation of the sentence is &quot;bed-bought&quot;.

It is true in Mohawk, as it is in many languages, that the direct object of a transitive verb can incorporate, but the subject of a transitive verb cannot. This can be seen in the examples below, as the well-formed sentence in 2a involves the incorporation of &quot;na&#x27;tar&quot; (bread), the direct object of the transitive verb &quot;kwetar&quot; (cut). Example 2b represents a sentence that is ill-formed, as it cannot possess the same meaning as 2a (&#x27;this knife cuts bread&#x27;). This is because the subject of the transitive verb, &quot;a&#x27;shar&quot; (knife), is being incorporated into the verb, which is not attested in Mohawk.

Further, a unique feature of Mohawk is that this language allows for noun incorporation into intransitives, as illustrated in example sentence 3. &quot;Hri&quot;&#x27; (shatter) is an intransitive verb into which the noun stem ks (dish) is being incorporated, producing a well-formed sentence.

Another feature of Mohawk which is not as commonly attested cross-linguistically is that Mohawk allows a demonstrative, numeral, or adjective outside the complex verb to be interpreted as a modifier of the incorporated noun. Example sentence 4 illustrates this below. Here, the demonstrative &quot;thinkv&quot; (that) refers to, and therefore modifies, the incorporated noun &quot;ather&quot; (basket).


According to Mithun&#x27;s (1984) theory of noun-incorporation classification, Mohawk is generally considered a type IV language because the incorporated noun modifies the internal argument. As a result of this classification, NI in Mohawk can follow any of the four structures listed in Mithun&#x27;s paper, including lexical compounding, manipulation of case roles, manipulation of discourse structure, and classificatory incorporation.

Baker, Aranovich, &amp; Golluscio claim that the structure of NI in Mohawk is the result of noun movement in the syntax. This is an extension of Baker&#x27;s head-movement hypothesis which is described above. The differences displayed by Mohawk as compared to other languages therefore depend on whether or not the person, number, and gender features are retained in the ‘trace’ of the noun, the trace being the position from where the noun moved from object position before adjoining to the governing verb. Figure 2 illustrates a simplified syntax tree of noun incorporation in Mohawk following Baker&#x27;s head-movement hypothesis. Here, the noun &quot;-wir-&quot; (baby) is moved from the object N position to become incorporated with the verb as the sister to the verb &quot;-núhwe&#x27;-&quot; (to like). Please note that some details were not included in this tree for illustrative purposes.

===== Oneida =====
In Oneida (an Iroquoian language spoken in Southern Ontario and Wisconsin), one finds classifier noun incorporation, in which a generic noun acting as a direct object can be incorporated into a verb, but a more specific direct object is left in place. In a rough translation, one would say, for example, &quot;I animal-bought this pig&quot;, where &quot;animal&quot; is the generic incorporated noun. Note that this &quot;classifier&quot; is not an actual classifier (i.e., a class-agreement morpheme) but a common noun.

===== Cherokee =====
Cherokee is spoken by the Cherokee people and is a member of the Iroquoian family. Noun incorporation in the language is very limited and the cases are lexicalized. All of the noun incorporation in Cherokee involves a body-part word and few nouns; to make up for the lack of NI, it has a system of classificatory verbs with five distinct categories.

===== Sora =====
The Austroasiatic language of Sora spoken in India and Nepal is mildly polysynthetic. Sora allows multiple incorporated nouns in a single verb and incorporated nouns in serialized verb structure. One negative-TAM or plural subject prefix can be added before verbs.

===== Tangut =====
The extinct Sino-Tibetan language of Tangut (spoken in the Western Xia) has few attested cases of syntactic noun incorporation:

==== Non-polysynthetic languages ====

===== English =====
English noun incorporation differs from that of the polysynthetic languages described above.

Noun incorporation was not traditionally common in English, but has over time become more productive.

Productive incorporation involves a singular noun with no determiner, quantifier, or adjunct.

Noun incorporation forms a new verb through lexical compounding. The noun adds a recognizable concept that alters the semantics of a verb. This is known as an incorporation complex, decreasing or increasing the valency of the verb.

In English, it is more common for an argument or an actant to be incorporated into the predicate, which results in additional connotation or metaphoric meaning, e.g., &quot;to house-hunt&quot;. Although often making the semantics more complex, it simplifies the syntax of the sentence by incorporating the actant-sender &quot;house&quot;.

English uses only lexical compounding, not composition by juxtaposition or morphological compounding. Lexical compounding occurs for an entity, quality, or activity that deserves its own name, e.g., &quot;mountain-climbing&quot;. If mountain-climbing were not an institutional activity, the language would be less likely to recognize it. To be incorporated into a host verb, the syntactic features of the noun are dropped.

English also uses conversion, forming denominal verbs. The incorporated actant does not possess a separate syntactic position in the verb.
The following illustrates the three sources of incorporation in English with corresponding examples:

In the examples above, the incorporated actant possesses a separate syntactic position in the verb.

===== Hungarian =====
Hungarian is a Uralic language in which many different types of noun incorporation occur. The linguistic typology of Hungarian is agglutinative, meaning that the language has words that may consist of a whole series of distinct morphemes. Hungarian combines &quot;bare noun + verb&quot; to form a new complex verb, and this would correspond to Mithun&#x27;s first type of NI, lexical compounding. Phonologically, the V and N are separate words, but syntactically, the N loses its syntactic status as the argument of the sentence, and the VN unit becomes an intransitive predicate. This is demonstrated in the examples below:

To be clear, to &#x27;house-build&#x27; is not the same as to &#x27;build a house&#x27;: &#x27;house-building&#x27; is a complex activity and a unitary concept, and this is applied to other examples as well. The object argument of the underlying verb may be satisfied by the bare noun, but the bare noun does not act as an argument of a sentence like it usually would. In Hungarian, for examples such as the one mentioned, the incorporating verb must be imperfective and the complex verb formed from it must always be intransitive.

In Hungarian, incorporated nominals may be morphologically singular or plural; this is dependent on whether languages allow this or not in their incorporation.

One restriction in Hungarian is that bare object nouns cannot be incorporated with prefixed verbs.

Another restriction in the language is that stative verbs do not allow noun incorporation, even if the stative verbs are not prefixed verbs.

However, it is important to note that there are some unprefixed verbs that are perfective and allow NI in Hungarian.

===== Korean =====
Korean, part of the Koreanic language family, has noun incorporation.

Specifically, Korean obeys the Head Movement Constraint of Baker (1988) that was discussed in the prior section.

Korean possesses incorporated nouns in the structure [N + VStem + AN1(i)], which is different from the normal N + V as in English. AN is an affix in this case.

In Korean, the noun, the head of the preceding NP, moves to the head of the VP to form a syntactic compound. The complex VP then moves up to the right of the nominal head position where &#x27;-i&#x27; is base-generated.

<doc id="889023" wikidata="Q15202817" url="?curid=889023" title="Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine">
<text>Marc Bolan&#x27;s Rock Shrine is a memorial to Marc Bolan, of glam-rock band T. Rex, on the site where he died in a car crash in Barnes, London, on 16 September 1977. Bolan was a passenger in a car that hit a part-metal-and-wood fence and then a sycamore tree on Queen&#x27;s Ride (part of the B306, close to Gipsy Lane), and he was pronounced dead at the scene on the arrival of paramedics at the woods. A memorial stone was unveiled at the site in 1997, and a bust of Bolan added in 2002.

==Origins==

Marc Bolan died, aged 29, after being found unconscious in the wreckage of his purple Mini, driven by his girlfriend Gloria Jones. He was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash. Jones lost control of the car, which then struck a steel-reinforced chain link fence post, and came to rest against a sycamore tree, after failing to navigate a small humpback bridge, near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride, Barnes, south-west London, even though she was wearing a seat belt. She was conscious after the crash. Bolan was a passenger in the car and he was pronounced dead at the scene on the arrival of paramedics. His girlfriend, named Jones, was critically injured in the crash and spent some time in hospital. From the day of the accident, the site became a place of pilgrimage to Bolan’s fans and this was reported in various newspapers from 1978 onwards. Coincidentally, the registration number of the car was FOX 661L and within the lyrics of his single &quot;Solid Gold Easy Action&quot; are the lines &quot;Easy as picking foxes from a tree&quot; and &quot;Woman from the east with her headlights shining&quot;.

In September 1997, on the 20th anniversary of the death of Bolan, the Performing Right Society (PRS) installed a memorial stone for Bolan, facing into Gipsy Lane at the base of the embankment from the &quot;Bolan Tree&quot; located in Queen&#x27;s Ride. In 1999, the T-Rex Action Group (TAG) was formed with the specific aim of caring for the site. TAG were granted an in perpetuity lease on the site with ownership and full responsibility for the &quot;Bolan Tree&quot;. During 2000, TAG built steps up the embankment between the &quot;Bolan Tree&quot; on Queen&#x27;s Ride and the PRS memorial stone facing Gipsy Lane and took the action needed to make the tree safe so that the threat of falling was removed.

In 2002, a bronze bust of Bolan paid for exclusively by T-Rex Action Group founder Fee Warner, and sculpted by Canadian sculptor Jean Robillard, was unveiled by Bolan&#x27;s only child Rolan Bolan.

In 2005, memorial plaques were fitted to the steps to remember other members of T. Rex who also died: Steve Peregrin Took, Steve Currie, Mickey Finn and Dino Dines. A memorial plaque was also included for Marc Bolan&#x27;s wife June Bolan (née Child) as recognition for her contribution to his success.

==Official recognition ==
In February 2007, the 30th anniversary year of Marc Bolan&#x27;s death, the work done by the T-Rex Action Group since 1999 was recognised by the English Tourist Board&#x27;s publication of its new guide &quot;England Rocks&quot; which features 113 &quot;Sites of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Importance&quot; in England. In London, 29 sites are listed, but many are &quot;general sites&quot; such as Abbey Road and Wembley Stadium which are not &quot;person-specific&quot;. Only Marc Bolan, Jimi Hendrix and Freddie Mercury are listed in the guide in their own right.

<text>Airwaves is a Canadian comedy drama television series that aired on CBC Television in 1986 and 1987.

==Plot==
The Toronto-filmed show stars Roberta Maxwell as Jean Lipton, a radio talk show host and widowed mother, who lives with her daughter Zoe, played by Ingrid Veninger, and her father Bob, played by Roland Hewgill. Maxwell has indicated that Canadian journalist-activist June Callwood was a basis for her portrayal of Jean.

The show&#x27;s cast also includes Taborah Johnson, Alec Willows, and Kimble Hall. Writers for the series included Judith Thompson, John Frizzell, Susan Martin, Rob Forsythe, Linda Svendsen and Paul Gross.

==Production==
Some of the early episodes were criticized as clunky, with Ross McLean of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; writing that the show seemed unsure of its identity, and even the producers later acknowledging that they had tried to fit too much into a half-hour show. The show was retooled slightly in its second season, with the writers getting a firmer grasp on the stories they wanted to tell and adding two new characters: Christopher Bolton in the role of Matt, Jean&#x27;s nephew, and Patrick Rose as Dale, Jean&#x27;s new coworker at the radio station. Critics responded favourably to the changes, with even McLean himself noting by 1987 that the show had significantly improved.

The show was modestly successful, with an average audience of 850,000 viewers per week in its first season. and 761,000 viewers in its second. Although the CBC was willing to order a third season, the producers decided to end the series as they felt it was better to move on to other projects than to continue tinkering with a show that wasn&#x27;t getting the ratings they wanted. However, CBC subsequently reran the first two seasons, outside of prime time, in 1990.

The series was repeated on Vision TV from 1989 to 1991.

<text>Football Club Dynamo Kyiv, also known as Dynamo Kyiv, or simply Dynamo, (, ) is a Ukrainian professional football club based in Kyiv. Founded in 1927 as a Kyivan football team of republican branch of the bigger Soviet Dynamo Sports Society, the club as a separate business entity was officially formed only in 1989 and currently plays in the Ukrainian Premier League, and has never been relegated to a lower division. The club has secured brand rights from the Ukrainian Dynamo society and has no direct relations to the sports society since 1989. Their home is the 70,050 capacity Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex.

Since 1936, Dynamo Kyiv has spent its entire history in the top league of Soviet and later Ukrainian football. Its most successful periods are associated with Valeriy Lobanovskyi, who coached the team during three stints, leading them to numerous domestic and European titles. In 1961, the club became first-ever in the history of Soviet football that managed to overcome the total hegemony of Moscow-based clubs in the Soviet Top League. The Spartak Moscow–Dynamo Kyiv rivalry that began in the mid-1970s, is widely considered to have been one of the most exciting football rivalries in the Soviet Union. Since becoming the first Soviet football club to participate in UEFA competition in 1965, Dynamo Kyiv has played in European competitions almost every season.

Over its history, Dynamo Kyiv have won 16 Ukrainian top-flight league titles, 13 Soviet top-flight league titles, 11 Ukrainian national cup competitions, 9 Soviet national cup competitions, and three continental titles (including two UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cups). Its two European Cup Winners&#x27; Cups make it one of the only two Soviet clubs to have won a UEFA trophy, the other being Dinamo Tbilisi. The Dynamo Kyiv first team became a base team for the Soviet Union national football team in the 1970–1980s and the Ukraine national football team in the 1990–2000s. The two stars on the club&#x27;s crest each signify 10 top-flight seasons Dynamo Kyiv won. The club was recognised as the Eastern European Club of the 20th Century by France-Presse.

==History==
===Early history===
Today&#x27;s club was established based on the first squad of Kyiv&#x27;s branch of the all-Union Dynamo sports society and its republican branch in the Ukrainian SSR, originally based out of Kharkiv. The Soviet government relocated capital to Kyiv in 1934. The all-Union Dynamo sports society was a sports department of the Soviet state security KGB, originally Cheka-OGPU. During the Soviet period Dynamo&#x27;s players same as players of all Dynamos in the Soviet Union were officially Soviet uniform servicemembers earning rank, salary, and pension when playing on the team of masters.

On 13 May 1927, the statute of the Kyivan Proletarian Sport Society (PST) Dynamo was officially registered by the special commission in affairs of public organizations and unions of the Kyiv district. The All-Union sport society of &quot;Dynamo&quot; in Moscow was formed earlier in 1923 on the initiative of the Felix Dzerzhinsky. A year later the first Ukrainian branch cell of the Dynamo sports society was formed in Kharkiv. Under the banner of Kyivan Dynamo gathered the representatives of the local GPU (State Political Directorate), the Soviet secret police, the best footballers of which defended the honors of the Trade Union club &quot;Sovtorgsluzhashchie&quot;, a portmanteau for Soviet retail servicemen. It was a common practice of the early Soviet sports societies that were formed based on already existing &quot;pre-revolutionary&quot; (1917 Bolshevik Revolution) sports societies in 1920s.

The leadership of Dynamo did not dare to reorganize the well-established club and the main title contender in the middle of a playing season. Therefore, the first mention of the football club Dynamo could only be found on 5 April 1928 in the Russian-language newspaper (at that time) &quot;Vecherniy Kiev&quot; (&quot;Evening Kyiv&quot;).

It was then when by the initiative of Semyon Zapadny, chief of the Kyiv GPU, the football team was created. His deputy, Sergei Barminsky, started to form the team not only out of regular chekists (members of the Soviet secret police), but also footballers of other clubs in the city among which is mentioned a team &quot;Sovtorgsluzhaschie&quot;. All the footballers were either part of the consolidated city team or the city champions. The newly created team played its first official match on 1 July 1928 against a local consolidated city team while visiting Bila Tserkva. Already on the fifth minute the Dynamo-men opened the score in the game, however, at the end the club lost it 1–2. On 15 July, the Bila Tserkva newspaper &quot;Radyanska Nyva&quot; (&quot;Soviet Fields&quot;) put it in such words:

The next match played by Dynamo was on 17 July 1928 hosting another Dynamo from the port city of Odesa. The match ended in draw 2:2. At the end of July Dynamo toured Belarus playing against the republican team of Belarus (1:5) and the districtal team of Gomel District (3:2). On 1 September 1928 Dynamo Kyiv was hosting the Dynamo&#x27;s primary team from Moscow and were thrashed 2:6. It was then Dynamo Kyiv was led by a playing coach Vasyl Boiko whose role is indicated as an instructor-organizer. Later in October 1928 Dynamo Kyiv took part in its first official tournament the 1928 Kyiv city championship and won it. On 18 November 1928 Dynamo Kyiv overpowered the Kyiv&#x27;s main football team of that period, Zheldor, 1:0.

As the club gained more experience and played on a regular basis, it started to fill the stadium with spectators with both the club and football in general gaining popularity in Soviet Ukraine.

On 14 September 1929 Dynamo Kyiv played its first international match against visiting workers&#x27; team from Deutsch-Wagram, Lower Austria and lost it 3:4.

Its club stadium Dynamo opened on 12 June 1933, a year before the Soviet government turned the city into capital of the Soviet Ukraine.

During the Soviet era, the club was one of the main rivals, and often the only rival, to football clubs from Moscow. Its ability to challenge the dominance of the Moscow clubs in Soviet football, and frequently defeat them to win the Soviet championship, was a matter of national pride for Ukraine. Leaders of the Ukrainian SSR unofficially regarded the club as their national team and provided it with generous support, making Dynamo a professional team of international importance.

In 1936, the first Soviet Championship was played, and Dynamo Kyiv was one of the pioneers of the newly formed league. The club&#x27;s early successes were however limited to a second-place finish in 1936 and third place in 1937. In the 1941 season, the club only played nine matches as World War II interrupted league play.

===The Death Match===
The propaganda story is often told of how the Dynamo team, playing as &quot;Start, City of Kyiv All-Stars&quot;, was executed by a firing squad in the summer of 1942 for defeating an All-Star team from the German armed forces by 5–1. The actual story, as recounted by Y. Kuznetsov, is considerably more complex. Still, this match has subsequently become known in the Soviet media as &quot;The Death Match&quot;.

After the Nazi occupation of Ukraine began, former professional football players (Dynamo and Lokomotyv) found employment in the city&#x27;s Bakery No. 3, and continued to play amateur football. The team participated in exhibition games that took place in the city among various other teams including teams composed of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; soldiers. The Kyiv&#x27;s team played under the name of &quot;Start&quot;, comprising eight players from Dynamo Kyiv (Nikolai Trusevych, Mikhail Svyridovskiy, Nikolai Korotkykh, Oleksiy Klymenko, Fedir Tyutchev, Mikhail Putistin, Ivan Kuzmenko, Makar Honcharenko) and three players from Lokomotyv Kyiv (Vladimir Balakin, Vasyl Sukharev and Mikhail Melnyk).

In July and August 1942, &quot;Start&quot; played a series of matches against the Germans and their allies. On 12 July, a German army team was defeated. A stronger army team was selected for the next match on 17 July, which &quot;Start&quot; defeated 6–0. On 19 July, &quot;Start&quot; defeated the Hungarian team MSG Wal 5–1. The Hungarians proposed a return match, held on 26 July, but were defeated again, 3–2.

&quot;Start&quot;&#x27;s streak was noticed and a match was announced for 6 August against a &quot;most powerful&quot; &quot;undefeated&quot; German Luftwaffe &quot;Flakelf&quot; (anti-aircraft artillery) team, but despite the game being talked up by the newspapers, they failed to report the 5–1 result. On 9 August, &quot;Start&quot; played a &quot;friendly&quot; against &quot;Flakelf&quot; and again defeated them. The team defeated Rukh 8–0 on 16 August, and afterwards, some of &quot;Start&quot;&#x27;s players were arrested by the Gestapo, tortured – Nikolai Korotkykh died during the torture – and sent to the nearby labour camp at Syrets. There is speculation that the players were arrested due to the intrigues of Georgy Shvetsov, founder and trainer of the &quot;Rukh&quot; team, as the arrests were made in a couple of days after &quot;Start&quot; defeated &quot;Rukh&quot;.

In February 1943, following an attack by partisans or a conflict of the prisoners and administration, one-third of the prisoners at Syrets were killed in reprisal, including Ivan Kuzmenko, Oleksey Klymenko and goalkeeper Nikolai Trusevich. Three of the other players – Makar Honcharenko, Fedir Tyutchev and Mikhail Sviridovskiy – who were in a work squad in the city that day, were arrested a few days later or, according to other sources, escaped and hid in the city until it was liberated.

The story inspired three films: the 1961 Hungarian film drama &quot;Two Half Times in Hell&quot;, the 1981 American film &quot;Escape to Victory&quot; and the 2012 Russian film &quot;Match&quot;.

=== Road to the first championship title: 1944–1963 ===
Only on 2 May 1944, after the return of Soviet regime, a friendly match between Dynamo Kyiv and Spartak Moscow took place at the Dynamo Stadium. From the pre-war (World War II) team there remained Anton Idzkovsky, Mykola Makhynia, Petro Laiko, Pavlo Vinkovatov, Mykola Balakin, Kostyantyn Kalach, including those who participated in the 1942 matches Makar Honcharenko and former Lokomotyv Kyiv players Volodymyr Balakin, Vasyl Sukharev.

In the first post-war years, all those who remained in the team were already quite old to play on the first team. Although in those years Dynamo Kyiv was joined by a whole group of younger footballers from Transcarpathian clubs (Vasyl Hodnychak, Ernest Yust, Zoltan Dyerfi, Zoltan Senhetovskyi, Mykhailo Koman, Dezyderiy Tovt and others), the team still could not really compete with other clubs, who endured the war better. In 1945, Dynamo took the penultimate place in the championship, and in 1946 - the very last, and, according to the regulations, it was supposed to be relegated, but an exception was made for the team, remembering the wartime losses. In addition, these events were accompanied by coaching fever: from 1946 to 1951, the club changed ten coaches.

The first post-war success was the victory in the doubles (reserves) tournament in the 1949 season. Since 1946 the Soviet first tier league was conducting championship among younger players which ran parallel to the championship among the first squads.

The turning point came during the 1951 season, before which Oleg Oshenkov took charge of the club. The new coach introduced to the main team younger players who had proven themselves well in doubles (reserves) competitions, also he drastically shortened the winter vacation of his players, offering them a serious physical training program that included sports games, various exercises and even boxing. Already in the next championship, which took place in one round robin in Moscow, it brought the first results. Dynamo Kyiv turned from a mid-table team into one of the favorites, winning the silver medals, just behind Spartak Moscow.

Oshenkov&#x27;s players achieved their first big victory during the 1954 Soviet Cup. On the way to the finals, the Kyiv team defeated Spartak Vilnius (4:2), Spartak Moscow (3:1), CDKA (3:1, in extra time), Zenit Leningrad (1:0, in extra time). In the cup&#x27;s final at Moscow&#x27;s &quot;Dynamo Stadium&quot;, the Kyiv&#x27;s team faced off with a poorly known (at that time) Spartak Yerevan. The match took place in heavy rain and fog, but all the same, the Kyivans were able to defeat their opponents and win the Soviet Cup for the first time in their history. In the final match took part following players Oleg Makarov (goalkeeper), Arkadiy Larionov, Vitaliy Golubyev, Tiberiy Popovich, Oleksandr Koltsov, Mykhaylo Mykhalyna, Volodymyr Bohdanovych, Viktor Terentiev (substitute with Pavlo Vinkovatov), Andrei Zazroyev (captain), Mykhaylo Koman, Viktor Fomin and Oleg Oshenkov as a head coach. Goals in the final were scored by Terentiev and Koman.

On 29 July 1959, an international friendly match between the football teams &quot;Dynamo&quot; (Kyiv, Ukraine) and &quot;Dynamo&quot; (Bacău, Romania) took place in Kyiv, which ended with a score of 3:0.

At the end of the 1950s, the Dynamo revamped its squad. The club left Yevhen Lemeshko, Leonid Ostroushko, Ernest Yust, Mykola Romanov, Yuriy Shevchenko, Vitaliy Sobolev. The club&#x27;s ranks were refilled with Serhiy Bohachyk, Ishtvan Sekech, Valeriy Lobanovskyi, Yevhen Snitko, Andriy Havashi, Vasyl Turyanchyk, Yozhef Sabo, while, a well-known former CDKA player (the &quot;Team of Lieutenants&quot;), Vyacheslav Solovyov became the head coach. The 1960 season brought to the Kyivans the &quot;silver&quot;.

In the 1961 season, Dynamo won the Soviet Union championship for the first time. The team from the capital of the Ukrainian SSR finished ahead of Torpedo Moscow (title holders) by 4 points. Dynamo Kyiv played 30 matches in the national championship (16 participants). Only three of those matches Dynamo lost and nine ended in a draw. The fact that they scored as many as 54 goals in 30 games testifies to the strength of the Dynamo&#x27;s offensive line, where played such players like Oleh Bazylevych, Viktor Kanevskyi, Valeriy Lobanovskyi, Viktor Serebryanikov. And about the strength of the defensive line - the fact that the experienced goalkeeper Oleg Makarov never had to take the ball out of the net in 12 matches. It was the first time in the history of the Soviet Union championships, when the national title of the country&#x27;s champion was gained by a non-Moscow club.

The first Dynamo gold medals received:

After the triumphant season of 1961, in the following two seasons, Dynamo&#x27;s position significantly worsened. In 1962, the team took 5th place, and the following year - 7th.

===Last Soviet years===

In 1989, the club transitioned into an independent company being disassociated from the Ukrainian republican society of Dynamo. The club transitioned from the Soviet &quot;team of masters&quot; to a regular professional football club of &quot;western&quot; style as it was interpreted then. It also was part of the Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s Perestroika reforms known as Khozrasschyot when state enterprises had difficult time to keep their associate organizations afloat and encouraged them to reorganize into self-sustained businesses.

During the last seasons of the Soviet Top League, it competed in the national colors of Ukraine as part of the national movement that grew very popular.

===Ukrainian Independence===

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the club became a member of the newly formed Ukrainian Premier League. By the summer of 1993, however, the club was in crisis as the economic policy of Dynamo president Viktor Bezverkhy set Dynamo on the path to bankruptcy. On 19 July 1993, an extraordinary assembly of coaches and players fired Bezverkhy and established a stock society called &quot;Football Club &quot;Dynamo (Kyiv)&quot;. Hryhoriy Surkis was elected president of the new company. The republican and city councils of the Dynamo society agreed to hand over two training centers and Dynamo Stadium to Dynamo Kyiv. The founders besides the football team and the Dynamo councils became also the commercial consulting centre Slavutych and the British firm Newport Management. A review board was created, consisting of directors of the Ministry of Interior of Ukraine, and the Security Service, Border Troops, and General Prosecutor of Ukraine.

Dynamo&#x27;s status as the country&#x27;s principal club did not change, however, as they went on to dominate domestic competitions, winning or being runner-up in every year of the Premier League&#x27;s existence and becoming a fixture in the UEFA Champions League. Its main rival in Ukraine is Shakhtar Donetsk, a club from the Donbas region, that came second to Dynamo several times before winning its first Premier League in 2002. The matches between these two sides are called the Ukrainian derby.

In 2007, as a part of club&#x27;s 80-year anniversary, two gold stars were added to the top of the crest, representing ten Ukrainian championship titles and ten USSR champion titles. Due to club&#x27;s poor performance in the UEFA Champions League during the last two seasons, Dynamo&#x27;s management took a somewhat unexpected decision by appointing the first foreign manager in the club&#x27;s history. Previously, only former players or Dynamo football academy graduates became managers, but in December 2007 Russian coach Yuri Semin was invited to become the new manager of Dynamo Kyiv. However, the club yielded to Shakhtar Donetsk in both the Ukrainian Cup and Premier League in 2008. In 2009. in the club&#x27;s most successful European campaign since 1999, it reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup (eliminating such teams as Valencia and Paris Saint-Germain) but was defeated at that stage by Shakhtar Donetsk. However, 2009 also brought success, as the club celebrated its 13th Premier League title.

In a season which contained their record win, a 9–0 victory over Illichivets Mariupol, the club only managed to finish runners-up in the league in 2010–11, after Shakhtar Donetsk. In what would be icon Andriy Shevchenko&#x27;s final season at the club, Dynamo also finished as runners-up in 2011–12. In the 2011–12 season Dynamo also managed to reach the group stage of the Europa League after being eliminated in the Champions League third qualifying round by Rubin Kazan by 0–2 in Kyiv and 2–1 in Kazan. In the Europa League playoffs, the club managed to defeat Litex Lovech with a 3–1 aggregate score. In the group stage, Dynamo finished third after a disappointing campaign in a group containing Beşiktaş, Maccabi Tel Aviv and Stoke City.

In April 2013, it was announced the club would play two European ties behind closed doors due to racism from fans during previous European ties. In the 2012–13 season, the club managed to qualify for the Champions League group stage after eliminating Feyenoord 3–1 and Borussia Mönchengladbach 4–3 on aggregate and qualified for the Champions League group stage. Dynamo was placed in a group with Paris Saint-Germain, Porto and Dinamo Zagreb and finished in third place with only five points and was eliminated in the Europa League round of 32 by Bordeaux 2–1 on aggregate. In the Premier League, Dynamo finished third, whereas in the Cup, it was eliminated in the round of 32. Overall, the 2012–13 season was a disappointment for Dynamo. The 2013–14 season was an equally disappointing season as Dynamo finished in fourth place in the league, the worst since the establishment of the Premier League and only managed to reach the round of 32 in the Europa League where it was eliminated by Valencia 2–0 on aggregate. Oleh Blokhin was sacked and was replaced by former player Serhii Rebrov. As a result, Dynamo managed to win the 2013–14 Ukrainian Cup for the first time in five years.

===Dynamo&#x27;s revival===
In the beginning of the 2014–15 season, Dynamo signed many promising players such as Aleksandar Dragović, Jeremain Lens (departed after end of the season), Łukasz Teodorczyk and Vitorino Antunes. Under Rebrov, Dynamo won the 2014–15 Ukrainian Premier League – undefeated – and the 2014–15 Ukrainian Cup to earn a domestic double for the first time in eight years. In the 2014–15 Europa League, Dynamo comfortably qualified from a group containing Aalborg BK, Steaua București and Rio Ave, finishing in first place with 15 points. In the round of 32, the club eliminated Guingamp 4–3 on aggregate, and in the round of 16, eliminated Everton 6–4 on aggregate after a spectacular 5–2 performance in Kyiv. Rebrov prioritized the passing game but focused on solid defensive foundations. However, in the quarter-finals of the Europa League, Dynamo was eliminated by Fiorentina 3–1 on aggregate.

In the beginning of the 2015–16 season, Dynamo signed the highly talented Derlis González and was drawn in Group G of the 2015–16 Champions League alongside Chelsea F.C., FC Porto and Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C. Dynamo finished in second place with 11 points after a spectacular performance and a memorable 0–2 in Porto. However, Dynamo was punished by UEFA for a racist incident in the home game against Chelsea where four black men were attacked in the stands by Dynamo fans.

Despite this, Dynamo reached the round of 16 in the Champions League for the first time since 2000, where it was drawn with Manchester City. Dynamo was eliminated 1–3 on aggregate but managed to hold an impressive 0–0 draw in Manchester. Dynamo&#x27;s domestic performance was equally memorable as the club celebrated the 2015–16 Ukrainian Premier League only losing to archrival Shakhtar Donetsk 0–3 twice and was eliminated in the quarter-finals of the 2015–16 Ukrainian Cup. At the end of the season, several star performers (such as Miguel Veloso, Aleksandar Dragović, Younès Belhanda and Łukasz Teodorczyk) departed the club and were not replaced.

===Stagnation period===

The 2016–17 season was a relative disappointment for Dynamo, as the club finished in second place in the 2016–17 Ukrainian Premier League, behind Shakhtar Donetsk, with a difference of 13 points after a string of disappointing results. In the 2016–17 Champions League, the club was drawn in Group B alongside Napoli, Benfica and Beşiktaş J.K. Dynamo finished in fourth place after a dismal campaign, but managed to record a memorable 6–0 win over Beşiktaş in Kyiv. In the winter transfer window, Dynamo signed promising defenders Aleksandar Pantić and Tamás Kádár and focused on youth academy talents such as Viktor Tsyhankov, Artem Besyedin and Volodymyr Shepelyev, managing to improve its performances. Dynamo lost the 2016–17 Ukrainian Cup to Shakhtar Donetsk 0–1 in the final.

For the 2017–18 season, after Serhii Rebrov departed, the club appointed former player Alyaksandr Khatskevich as Rebrov&#x27;s replacement. In Khatskevich&#x27;s first two seasons at the helm, Dynamo failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League group stage, having to settle for the UEFA Europa League group stage instead. Both times they were eventually eliminated in the Round of 16, first by S.S. Lazio (2–4 on aggregate) in 2017–18, and then by Chelsea F.C. (0–8 on aggregate) in 2018–19. Domestically, Dynamo remained firmly in second place behind Shakhtar Donetsk in the Ukrainian Premier League. Despite the apparent lack of progress in the results, Khatskevich was rewarded with a two-year contract extension.

However, only six matches into his new extension, Khatskevich was fired on 14 August 2019, after once again failing to advance to the UEFA Champions League group stage. Dynamo&#x27;s Sports Director, Oleksiy Mykhaylychenko, was appointed as manager. Despite the change, the results on the field hardly improved, as Dynamo was eliminated from continental competitions by placing 3rd in Group B of the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League group stage.

On 23 July 2020, Mircea Lucescu became the head coach of Dynamo. Lucescu signed a two-year contract.

==Crests and colours==

===Crest===
Being a member of the All-Union Sports Society Dynamo, the Dynamo football team of Kyiv adopted the same emblem of the Dynamo&#x27;s sports society as its first logo, which featured on their shirts since 1927 and was a cursive blue Cyrillic letter &quot;Д&quot; (D) in a vertical rhombus. Similar emblem existed in other Soviet football teams throughout the Soviet Union such as FC Dynamo Moscow, FC Dinamo Tbilisi, FC Dinamo Minsk, and others. The idea of symbol is attributed to a native of Ukraine Leonid Nedolya-Honcharenko who at that time served as a chief of political department of the OGPU troops in Moscow District.

The symbol the club obtained on franchise rights from the Ukrainian Fitness and Sports Society &quot;Dynamo&quot; (see Dynamo–Ukraine). Over the years, the club&#x27;s logo has undergone many changes and replacements, but the cursive &quot;D&quot; has remained ever since.

In 2003 after Dynamo won their 10th domestic trophy, a golden star was added at the top of the logo to celebrate the club&#x27;s success. The second star was added to the logo in 2007 during celebrations of Dynamo&#x27;s 80-year anniversary. Although Dynamo has won only 15 Ukrainian league titles, their 13 titles as USSR Champions were taken into account.

Dynamo&#x27;s traditional colours are white and dark blue, with white being the predominant colour. Throughout their history the club has usually played in a white shirt and blue shorts. This was changed in 1961 when a blue sash was added to the kit; it was removed soon afterwards. In 2004, the club&#x27;s management decided to restore the famous sash as a talisman. It was added to the away kit and remained there until the beginning of the 2008–09 season, when it was replaced by a white kit with a shirt having thin blue vertical stripes, the first time in over 50 years that a club had worn such a pattern.

During the last two seasons before the breakup of the Soviet Union, Dynamo&#x27;s kit was similar to Metalist, yellow shirts and blue shorts. This color scheme carried a symbolic meaning, representing the national colours of the yet-not-adopted Ukraine national flag. In the 1990 Soviet Cup Final, the yellow-blue Dynamo team thrashed the all-Red Lokomotiv 6–1 at Luzhniki Stadium. In the early years of Ukrainian independence, the club swapped their yellow colour for white. However blue remained one of Dynamo&#x27;s colours and is still a main colour of the club&#x27;s away kit.

The club&#x27;s current sponsors, New Balance and ABank24, feature on the team shirt. New Balance is also the manufacturer of the kit. Among former sponsors there were Ostchem Holding, Nadra Bank, PrivatBank, Prominvestbank, Ukrtelecom, and others.

==Honours==
Dynamo Kyiv has participated in all of the USSR and Ukrainian championships to date, and has won both competitions more times than any other team.

==Grounds==
===Stadiums===


The club&#x27;s home ground, Valeriy Lobanovskyi Dynamo Stadium, is situated in a park located in the centre of the city, close to the Dnieper River bank. The stadium holds 16,873 spectators, and has been the club&#x27;s home since 1934. When it was built the stadium&#x27;s capacity was 23,000. After being destroyed in 1941 during World War II, it was rebuilt in 1954. By the end of the 20th century, the stadium was reconstructed as a football-only venue with individual seats. These changes reduced the facility&#x27;s capacity to its present one. In 2002 after the sudden death of Dynamo&#x27;s longtime player and coach Valeriy Lobanovskyi, the stadium was renamed in his honour. After NSK Olympiyskiy was closed for reconstruction in 2008, Dynamo also began to play its European games at the Lobanovsky Stadium.

Due to a high demand for European fixtures of the club throughout its European history Dynamo played a majority of their home fixtures at Kyiv&#x27;s and Ukraine&#x27;s largest stadium, the Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex, historically dubbed &quot;The Republican Stadium&quot;, which held 83,450 spectators. The stadium has been the home of the Ukrainian Cup final since its inaugural game in 1992 and up until 2007. The stadium was closed for a major reconstruction in 2008, after Ukraine and Poland were chosen to host the UEFA Euro 2012. The Olympiysky became Kyiv&#x27;s main venue as well as the stadium that hosted the final; it also become a UEFA Elite rated stadium.

The team also has a modern-equipped training base in the Kyiv suburb of Koncha-Zaspa. The club maintains its own football school for children and youths, also situated in Kyiv. Junior Dynamo teams are colloquially known as &quot;Dynamo-2&quot; and &quot;Dynamo-3&quot;. Its reserves team -called &quot;double&quot; (дубль) in both Ukrainian and Russian- participates in the national Reserves tournament, where &quot;doubles&quot; of all 16 Vyscha Liga teams compete. Many notable Dynamo Kyiv players progressed through the club&#x27;s youth system, among them is Andriy Shevchenko, one of the graduates of the school.

===Reserve, youth and junior teams===
Dynamo Kyiv has several reserve teams. Dynamo reserve teams competed in national competitions since 1946. The club was fielding its reserve team in the Soviet Top League competitions for reserve teams (so called doubles) that existed in 1946–1991. Dynamo doubles team holds a record for number of champion titles of the Soviet Top League for doubles winning it 15 times with a closest pursuing Spartak doubles team trailing with 9 titles. In 2004 the club revived its reserve team which later became youth (U-21) team competing at Ukrainian Premier League competitions for U-21 and U-19 teams. Dynamo football school (academy) fields few teams in Ukrainian Youth Football League as well as Kyiv city football league. Among possibly most exotic football academy graduates is a former Moroccan international Tarik El Jarmouni.

Besides its normal junior squads, FC Dynamo Kyiv also has fielded its second team Dynamo-2 which competed among regular &quot;teams of masters&quot; (Soviet analog of professional teams) as well as republican competitions (amateur level) during the Soviet period. The first time the team participated in football competitions at professional level was in 1964 when it took part in the Soviet Second League (in so called the Ukrainian Soviet football competitions). With dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Dynamo-2 was revived based on the Dynamo&#x27;s reserve team that participated in the Soviet Top League for doubles. The team continued to play in Ukrainian First League for over 20 years. Along with the second team, Dynamo created also its third team Dynamo-3 which at first played at amateur level and later advanced to Ukrainian Second League. Since 2016, Dynamo has discontinued its numbered team.

===Other departments===

Since parting from its parent Dynamo society in 1989, Dynamo Kyiv becoming exclusively a football club (other departments were left with the Kyiv city branch of Dynamo–Ukraine) had also its own women team which while not being as successful as the main team, had some degree of success when they were playing first at Soviet and later at Ukrainian competitions. In 1994 the whole women department was liquidated as the owners of the club lost interest in it.

In 2017 the Ukrainian Association of Football pursued existing men football clubs to help with development of women&#x27;s football in Ukraine and either create own teams or adopt already existing teams of separate women football clubs or sports schools.

In 2021 Dynamo in cooperation with the Kyivan Olympic College reestablished its women football team replacing the college team at the second tier of the two-tier national football pyramid for women and gained promotion the same season.

==Supporters and rivalries==

The Dynamo fan movement is one of the oldest in Ukraine. Active support began in 1980s during the Soviet period (Ukrainian SSR). Then began to appear first graffiti with the team&#x27;s logo and was registered one of the biggest fights in the USSR: Dynamo fans against fans of Spartak Moscow in the center of Kyiv. In the 1990s on the stands became popular English style.

Historically Dynamo ultras would frequently hold patriotic (Ukrainian nationalism) and strongly anti-communist actions. During the reign of Viktor Yanukovych the ultras had bad relations with the government, caused by persecutions of fans and other political factors. The most publicized action was &quot;Freedom Pavlichenko&quot; () in support of political prisoners father and son Pavlichenko. The ultras Dynamo took part in the Independence Day of Ukraine and Heroes Day celebrations.

== Scandals ==
=== FootballLeaks-2 ===
German journalists from Rafael Buschmann and Michael Wulzinger published a book titled &quot;Football Leaks – 2&quot;.

A separate part titled &quot;Ukrainische Bruderschaft&quot; (Ukrainian Brotherhood) describes brothers Ihor and Hryhorii Surkis&#x27;s activities in the football sphere and their relation to the &quot;Newport&quot; offshore. All FC &quot;Dynamo’s&quot; activities are financed by this company. The authors refer to Football Leaks documents.

The book tells that starting from 1993, all the financial activities of Kyiv-based FC Dynamo have been performed via the company Newport, controlled by the club&#x27;s boss Ihor Surkis. Having cited the FIFA data, the authors noted that in 2011–2017 the Newport has spent US$324 million to buy 82 players for FC Dynamo. The taxes from this sum haven&#x27;t been paid in Ukraine.

<text>Throughout history, printers&#x27; errors, unconventional translations and translation mistakes have appeared in a number of published Bibles. Bibles with features considered to be erroneous are known as Bible errata, and were often destroyed or suppressed due to their contents being considered heretical by some.

==Manuscript Bibles==
===The Book of Kells, ===

The Book of Kells features two errors within its text:

* The genealogy of Jesus, in the Gospel of Luke, lists an extra ancestor in Luke 3:26. This error is considered to have resulted from the transcriber reading the phrase as , with the being considered an additional individual, resulting in the lines and the additional , rather than the singular .
* In the Gospel of Matthew, 10:34b should read &quot;I came not to send peace, but the sword&quot;. However, rather than the Latin , meaning &quot;sword&quot;, the Book of Kells has , meaning &quot;joy&quot;, rendering the verse &quot;I came not [only] to send peace, but [also] joy&quot;.

===The Book of Deer, 10th century===
The Scottish &quot;Book of Deer&quot; in Cambridge University Library has a number of errors. In the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke, it has Seth as the first man and grandfather of Adam.

==Printed Bibles==
===Geneva===
* &quot;Place-makers&#x27; Bible&quot; 1562: the second edition of the Geneva Bible, Matthew 5:9 reads &quot;Blessed are the placemakers: for they shall be called the children of God&quot;; it should read &quot;peacemakers&quot;.
** In its chapter heading for Luke 21, the Place-makers&#x27; Bible has &quot;Christ condemneth the poor widow&quot;, rather than &quot;commendeth&quot;.

===Douai===
* &quot;Manchester edition&quot; 1793: The heading on Chapter 3 of Leviticus and the first verse has &quot;bees&quot; rather than &quot;beeves&quot; (plural of beef). It reads: &quot;How the pacifique hosts must be of bees, sheep, lambs and goats&quot; (&quot;pacifique hosts&quot; meaning peace offerings).

===King James===

In various printings of the King James Version of the Bible, some of the more famous examples have been given their own names. Among them are:
* &quot;Judas Bible&quot;, from 1613: This Bible has Judas, not Jesus, saying &quot;Sit ye here while I go yonder and pray&quot; (Matthew 26:36). A second folio edition printed by Robert Barker, printer to King James I, is held in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Totnes, Devon. In this copy, the misprint has been covered with a small slip of paper glued over the name of Judas.
* &quot;Printers Bible&quot;, from 1612: In some copies, Psalm 119:161 reads, &quot;Printers have persecuted me without a cause&quot;, rather than &quot; have persecuted me...&quot;
* &quot;Wicked Bible&quot;, &quot;Adulterous Bible&quot; or &quot;Sinner&#x27;s Bible&quot;, from 1631: Barker and Lucas: Omits an important &quot;not&quot; from Exodus 20:14, making the seventh commandment read &quot;Thou shalt commit adultery.&quot; An 1886 study of Star Chamber case reports suggests that this was just one of the &quot;two grossest errors&quot; in the printing, alongside Deuteronomy 5:24, which read &quot;the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his great-asse&quot; instead of the correct &quot;greatness[e]&quot;. However, this second error does not appear in any extant copy of the Bible. The printers were fined £300 and most of the copies were recalled immediately. Only 15 copies survive in the collections of public institutions in the English-speaking world.
* &quot;More Sea Bible&quot;, from 1641: &quot;...the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was more sea&quot;, rather than &quot;...the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea&quot;, from Revelation 21:1
* &quot;&quot; or &quot;Wicked Bible&quot;, from 1653, Cambridge Press: Another edition carrying this title omits a &quot;not&quot; before the word &quot;inherit&quot;, making 1 Corinthians 6:9 read &quot;Know ye not that the unrighteous shall inherit the kingdom of God?&quot;. In addition, Romans 6:13 reads &quot;Neither yield ye your members as instruments of righteousness into sin&quot;, where it should read &quot;unrighteousness&quot;.
* &quot;Sin On Bible&quot;, from 1716: Jeremiah 31:34 reads &quot;sin on more&quot; rather than &quot;sin no more&quot;.

* &quot;Vinegar Bible&quot;, from 1717: J. Baskett, Clarendon Press: The chapter heading for Luke 20 reads &quot;The Parable of the Vinegar&quot; instead of &quot;The Parable of the Vineyard.&quot; One reviewer called this particular edition &quot;a Baskett full of errors&quot; due the abundance of typographical errors. One copy sold for $5,000 in 2008.
* &quot;The Fools Bible&quot;, from 1763: Psalm 14:1 reads &quot;the fool hath said in his heart there is a God&quot;, rather than &quot;there is no God&quot;. The printers were fined £3,000 and all copies ordered destroyed.
* &quot;Murderer&#x27;s Bible&quot;, from 1801: &quot;Murmurers&quot; is printed as &quot;murderers&quot;, making Jude 16 read: &quot;These are murderers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men&#x27;s persons in admiration because of advantage.&quot;
* &quot;To-remain Bible&quot;, from 1805: In Galatians 4:29, a proof-reader had written in &quot;to remain&quot; in the margin, as an answer to whether a comma should be deleted. The note inadvertently became part of the text, making the edition read &quot;But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit to remain, even so it is now.&quot;
* &quot;Standing Fishes Bible&quot;, from 1806: &quot;Fishes&quot; replaced &quot;fishers&quot; making Ezekiel 47:10 read &quot;And it shall come to pass, that the fishes shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.&quot;
* &quot;Wife-hater Bible&quot;, from 1810: &quot;Wife&quot; replaces &quot;life&quot; in this edition, making Luke 14:26 redundantly read &quot;If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own wife also, he cannot be my disciple.&quot;
* &quot;The Large Family Bible&quot;, from 1820: Isaiah 66:9 reads: &quot;Shall I bring to birth and not cease to bring forth?&quot; rather than &quot;Shall I bring to birth and not cause to bring forth?&quot;.
* &quot;Rebecca&#x27;s Camels Bible&quot;, from 1823: &quot;Camels&quot; replaces &quot;damsels&quot; in one instance, making Genesis 24:61 read &quot;And Rebecca arose, and her camels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebecca and went his way.&quot;
* &quot;Owl Bible&quot;, from 1944: &quot;Owl&quot; replaces &quot;own&quot;, making 1 Peter 3:5 read, &quot;For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their owl husbands.&quot; The error was caused by a printing plate with a damaged letter .

==Fictional Bible errata==
* In the novel &quot;Good Omens&quot;, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett created the &quot;Buggre Alle This Bible&quot; of 1651 (and the Charing Cross Bible). The typesetter replaced Ezekiel 48:5 with a rant complaining about his job. It also has three extra verses at the end of Genesis 3 about the loss of the flaming sword by the angel Aziraphale, added by Aziraphale himself, a character in the story. 
* In the BBC science-fiction sitcom &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, one of the main characters, Arnold Rimmer, tells of his family belonging to an obscure fundamentalist Christian sect, the &quot;Seventh Day Advent Hoppists&quot;. According to Rimmer – who is revealed in another episode to have the middle name Judas due to his parents&#x27; unconventional take on Christianity – the Hoppists&#x27; unique form of worship arose from a misprinted Bible wherein 1 Corinthians 13:13 reads &quot;Faith, hop and charity, and the greatest of these is hop.&quot; The membership consequently spent every Sunday hopping. Rimmer says he never agreed with the faith, but claims to be liberal on religious matters.
* &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is a 1998 bestselling novel by Barbara Kingsolver which mentions some of the famous &quot;misprint Bibles&quot; such as the &quot;Camel Bible&quot;, the &quot;Murderer&#x27;s Bible&quot;, and the &quot;Bug Bible&quot;. The novel&#x27;s title refers to the character of Nathan Price, a missionary in the 1950s Belgian Congo who creates his own &quot;misprint&quot; by mispronouncing the local expression &quot;Tata Jesus is bängala&quot;, meaning &quot;Jesus is most precious&quot;. In his pronunciation, he actually says &quot;Jesus is poisonwood!&quot;
* In the novel &quot;The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared&quot; by the Swedish author Jonas Jonasson, a Bible erratum plays heavily into the plot. The Bibles in question carry an extra verse (Revelation 22:22), reading &quot;And they all lived happily ever after&quot;.

<text>Hangin&#x27; In is a Canadian television sitcom that aired on CBC from 1981 to 1987. It aired briefly on Nickelodeon and in syndication in the United States.

==Synopsis==
The show starred Lally Cadeau as Kate Brown, the attractive and charismatic director of a youth drop-in centre in Toronto, and blended both comedy and drama in its portrayal of genuine teen counselling problems. David Eisner starred as Michael DiFalco, a young, affable staff counsellor, and Ruth Springford appeared as Doris Webster, the centre&#x27;s receptionist. Many young Canadian actors, including Eric McCormack, Keanu Reeves, Jessica Steen and Mark Humphrey, made guest appearances as teenaged clients of the youth centre.

During the show&#x27;s final season, Cadeau was replaced for the final five episodes by Fiona Reid as Maggie. This change was planned, as the producers were setting up a new spin-off series to star Reid as the director of a halfway house for young offenders. However, the new series was not picked up.

==Episodes==
===Season 1: 1981===
===Season 2: 1982===
===Season 3: 1982–83===
===Season 4: 1983–84===
===Season 5: 1984–85===
===Season 6: 1985–86===
===Season 7: 1986–87===
==Production==
The show was created by the same production team, led by executive producer Jack Humphrey, with Anna Sandor and Joseph Partington, behind one of the most successful Canadian sitcoms in television history, &quot;King of Kensington&quot;, which had itself evolved in its late episodes toward a similar concept and setting.

The series premiered on January 7, 1981, the day after the final episode of the dramatic miniseries &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Katie&quot;, which also starred Cadeau. Writing for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, Bill MacVicar likened the streak of Cadeau&#x27;s roles in two different series airing on four consecutive nights to &quot;the video equivalent of being shot from a cannon or, at least, making a premiere entrance on a red carpet, with klieg lights and a ravenous crowd of autograph seekers&quot;.

<doc id="889043" wikidata="Q2912000" url="?curid=889043" title="World War II cryptography">
<text>Cryptography was used extensively during World War II because of the importance of radio communication and the ease of radio interception. The nations involved fielded a plethora of code and cipher systems, many of the latter using rotor machines. As a result, the theoretical and practical aspects of &quot;cryptanalysis&quot;, or &quot;codebreaking&quot;, were much advanced.

Possibly the most important codebreaking event of the war was the successful decryption by the Allies of the German &quot;Enigma&quot; Cipher. The first break into Enigma was accomplished by Polish Cipher Bureau around 1932; the techniques and insights used were passed to the French and British Allies just before the outbreak of the war in 1939. They were substantially improved by British efforts at Bletchley Park during the war. Decryption of the Enigma Cipher allowed the Allies to read important parts of German radio traffic on important networks and was an invaluable source of military intelligence throughout the war. Intelligence from this source and other high level sources, such as Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher, was eventually called Ultra.

A similar break into the most secure Japanese diplomatic cipher, designated Purple by the US Army Signals Intelligence Service, started before the US entered the war. Product from this source was called Magic.

On the other side, German code breaking in World War II achieved some notable successes cracking British naval and other ciphers.

He played with former Tyrannosaurus Rex percussionist Steve Peregrin Took&#x27;s band Steve Took&#x27;s Horns alongside Trev Thoms on guitar.

<text>Savage Amusement is the tenth studio album by the German hard rock band Scorpions, released in 1988. It peaked at No. 5 in the US and was certified platinum by the RIAA on June 20, 1988. It was the last Scorpions record to be produced by Dieter Dierks.

==Cover art==
The cover shows a woman wearing a black dress on a dark blue background. With her right hand she hides her eyes; thus, only her mouth and nose are visible. The cover of &quot;Savage Amusement&quot; is notable, however, for the fact that instead of the lady&#x27;s right leg, a scorpion tail is seen. The typical band logo is shown on the upper left, while the title of the album is found in the lower right corner, in red, and underlined (also in red).

<doc id="889067" wikidata="Q16734646" url="?curid=889067" title="Michael Portnoy">
<text>Michael Portnoy (born August 2, 1971) is an American visual artist, filmmaker, choreographer and performance artist. He calls himself a &quot;Director of Behavior&quot;. He has been described in &quot;Art in America&quot; as &quot;one of the most interesting performance artists anywhere&quot;, and by &quot;Artforum&quot; as &quot;the great Absurdist&quot;.

==Background and early work==
Portnoy was born in Washington, D.C., and studied comparative literature and creative writing at Vassar College and theater at the National Theater Institute at The Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center. After moving to New York City, he formed several short-lived experimental theater groups and then began concentrating on solo performance. His early performance works, such as &quot;Gymnastics and Schizophrenia&quot; and &quot;5teen3sy: Kicking Games of Lip&quot;, were antic and unpredictable, and characterized by dense language play, song and movement fragments and rapid transformations of character. In the mid 1990s, Portnoy regularly performed in venues such as Surf Reality and Luna Lounge&#x27;s weekly show &quot;Eating It&quot;, the epicenter of New York&#x27;s alternative comedy scene. His wild and abstract theatrical performances, which occasionally interrupted and challenged other comedians on stage, prompted &quot;Time Out New York&quot; to describe him as &quot;the bad boy of comedy&quot;, and the &quot;New York Post&quot; to dub him &quot;the next Andy Kaufman&quot;. At the same time, Portnoy started working as a dancer for the New York choreographer Koosil-Ja Hwang, and as an actor. He also sang and performed his own operatic, electro-progressive-rock music as XAR, and with the band The Liquid Tapedeck.

==Soy Bomb==
For Bob Dylan&#x27;s performance of &quot;Love Sick&quot; at the 1998 Grammy Awards, Portnoy was hired by Dylan&#x27;s production company to stand in the background with other dancers and groove to the music to &quot;give Bob a good vibe&quot;. Instead, halfway through the performance, Portnoy ripped off his shirt, ran next to Dylan, and started dancing and contorting with the two-word poem &quot;Soy Bomb&quot; written across his chest. When questioned by reporters, Portnoy explained the poem&#x27;s meaning: &quot;Soy... represents dense nutritional life. Bomb is, obviously, an explosive destructive force. So, soy bomb is what I think art should be: dense, transformational, explosive life&quot; according to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and that &quot;he meant Soy Bomb as a &#x27;spontaneous explosion of the self&#x27; to re-invigorate the current music scene. He has also said that the phrase is a combination of Spanish and English, meaning &quot;the bomb of &#x27;I am&#x27;&quot;. The Grammys chose not to press charges against Portnoy for the act, but he was not paid the $200 fee for the gig.

The event was parodied on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where he was portrayed by Will Ferrell, and on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. In 2005, the band Eels included the track &quot;Whatever Happened to Soy Bomb&quot; on the double-disc album &quot;Blinking Lights and Other Revelations&quot;. In 2016, the TV show Broad City parodied Soy Bomb with a performance artist character played by musician Har Mar Superstar.

== Portnoy: 1999–present ==

Portnoy expanded his practice to include choreography, video, installation, sculpture, painting, participatory works and curation. His projects have included Google Office 0.2, a project for the 2010 Taipei Biennial that involved the formation of a think tank called The Improvement League, which operated by improving existing artworks in the Biennial by pruning and hybridizing in a cross between futurology and conceptual horticulture. Portnoy&#x27;s long-standing investigation of social exchange, and the rules of communication and play, has been conducted through a series of &#x27;abstract gambling&#x27; tables for Casino Ilinx (2008) and Filzzungeungewiss (2009); and conversation or inventional games drawing on 17th century universal or taxonomic languages for Fran Spafa Feda (2010); and the game-show format of 27 Gnosis (2012).

== Relational Stalinism ==

Central to many of Portnoy&#x27;s projects is his tongue-in-cheek concept of &#x27;Relational Stalinism&#x27;, a form of relational aesthetics that works against &quot;the fashionable promise that an artwork might offer a democratic magic, transforming inter-relational codes into something nicer…&quot; Unlike other artists who produce participatory artworks, Portnoy undermines the creation of a harmonious community by setting as many limitations as possible on the participants and then introducing destabilizing mechanisms, such as changing the rules in the middle of the game. This breed of absurdist, dictatorial interaction with participants is &quot;a clarification of the artist&#x27;s imperious role as producer and performer&quot;. Contrary to many contemporary participatory events, these schemes value confusion, complication, and ambiguity over predictable outcomes, and the goal is to stretch and dislocate the participants by complicating their behavior and language in the service of riotous invention. By acting as the &quot;Director of Behavior&quot; and constantly modifying the standards of the game, Portnoy forces the participants to construct unexpected worlds and new modes of communication.

== Experimental comedy ==
Much of Portnoy’s work is also framed by what he calls experimental comedy, or &quot;the injection of the sublime, the blatantly inscrutable, the abstract, the primal, the choreographic, the theoretical, the improbable, the generative, the post-rhythmic, the turbo-stupid, etc., into the frame of stand-up&quot;. This has been manifested in the operatic stand-up routine of The K Sound (2006), Taipei Women’s Experimental Comedy Club (2010), and Script Opposition in Late-Model Carrot Jokes (2011), a project that investigated the &quot;carrot joke&quot;, a term used in cognitive linguistics to describe a poem-like joke with a high degree of ambiguity, blunt omissions of information and logical faults and inconsistencies. In carrot jokes &quot;incongruities are rarely resolved and just pile on top of each other … Since the ground or ‘script’ is always shifting, the listener keeps trying to determine whether there is an overall story that could explain what the hell is going on&quot;.

== Selected exhibitions and performances ==
He has presented work internationally in venues including: dOCUMENTA (13), The 11th Baltic Triennial (as co-curator), Centre Pompidou, The Taipei Biennial 2010, Performa Biennial 07, 09 &amp; 11, SculptureCenter, The Kitchen, de Appel (Amsterdam), P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, Art Unlimited Basel, Kunsthalle Basel, Objectif Exhibitions (Antwerp), Wilfried Lentz (Rotterdam), IBID PROJECTS (London), Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts Gallery, Deitch Gallery, Roulette, Kling &amp; Bang (Reykjavík), Foksal Gallery Foundation (Warsaw), Kaaitheater (Brussels), Beursschouwburg (Brussels), Migros Museum (Zürich), Le Comfort Moderne (Poitiers, France) and The National Review of Live Art (Glasgow).

<doc id="889071" wikidata="Q1381701" url="?curid=889071" title="Evelyn Baring, 1st Baron Howick of Glendale">
<text>Evelyn Baring, 1st Baron Howick of Glendale (29 September 1903 – 10 March 1973), was Governor of Southern Rhodesia from 1942 to 1944, High Commissioner for Southern Africa from 1944 to 1951, and Governor of Kenya from 1952 to 1959. Baring played an integral role in the suppression of the Mau Mau rebellion. Together with Colonial Secretary Alan Lennox-Boyd, Baring played a significant role in the government&#x27;s efforts to deal with the rebellion, and see Kenya through to independence. Baring was aware of abuses against Mau Mau detainees. He was created Baron Howick of Glendale in 1960.

== Education and early career ==
Baring followed in the footsteps of his father, the famed &quot;Maker of Modern Egypt&quot; – Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer. Baring went to Winchester College and then to New College, Oxford, graduating from Oxford University with First Class Honours in Modern History before serving in the Indian Civil Service. He then joined Britain&#x27;s Foreign Office, where he was sent first to Southern Rhodesia before being posted in South Africa as High Commissioner.

==Seretse Khama==
In 1949, while serving as High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Baring played a key role in preventing Seretse Khama, the heir to the throne of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, from assuming the throne; doing so on the ground that Khama&#x27;s marriage to a white woman, Ruth Williams, was opposed by the white-minority government of South Africa, a neighbouring state which had recently implemented a system of racial segregation known as apartheid.

Working in close collaboration with Percivale Liesching, who was serving as Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs at the time, Baring was able to persuade government ministers to prevent Khama from assuming the throne of Bechuanaland, instead mandating him to stay in a government-imposed exile in London, which lasted until 1956.

==Governorship in Kenya==

As Governor of Kenya, Baring declared a State of Emergency on 20 October 1952 before launching Operation Jock Scott, which targeted alleged Mau Mau leaders, especially Jomo Kenyatta. Baring&#x27;s administration created the &quot;dilution technique&quot;, a system of assaults and psychological shocks to detainees, to force the compliance. Baring requested and received approval to use &quot;overpowering&quot; force from the Colonial Secretary in London.

In June 1957, Baring passed on to Alan Lennox-Boyd a secret memorandum written by Sir Eric Griffiths-Jones, the Attorney General of Kenya, which described the abuse of Mau Mau detainees. The paper alleges that Baring supplied a covering letter that asserted that inflicting &quot;violent shock&quot; was the only way of suppressing the Mau Mau rebellion.

==Career after Kenya==
Baring left Kenya in 1959. He was elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Howick of Glendale in 1960. He retired to his family estate of Howick Hall, which was inherited by his wife Lady Mary Cecil Grey, daughter of the 5th Earl Grey. He was known to enjoy birdwatching. Lord Howick of Glendale later accepted a post with the government&#x27;s Colonial Development Corporation.

==Marriage and children==
Baring married Lady Mary Cecil Grey, daughter of the 5th Earl Grey and Lady Mabel Laura Georgiana Palmer (daughter of the 2nd Earl of Selborne), on 24 April 1935. They had three children:

* The Hon. Katherine Mary Alice Baring (born 30 March 1936), married Sir Humphry Wakefield, 2nd Baronet,
* Charles Evelyn Baring, 2nd Baron Howick of Glendale (born 30 December 1937), and
* The Hon. Elizabeth Beatrice Baring (born 10 January 1940), married Nicholas Albany Gibbs.

Lord Howick of Glendale died from injuries sustained in a climbing accident on 10 March 1973, at the age of 69. He was climbing a cliff on his estate when he slipped and fell 15 feet. He was succeeded in the barony by his son, Charles.

==Honours==
* Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG), 1942, advanced to GCMG, 1955
* Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO), 1947
* Baron Howick of Glendale, 1960
* Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG), 1972

<doc id="889073" wikidata="Q1609780" url="?curid=889073" title="Middlesex (novel)">
<text>Middlesex is a Pulitzer Prize–winning novel by Jeffrey Eugenides published in 2002. The book is a bestseller, with more than four million copies sold since its publication. Its characters and events are loosely based on aspects of Eugenides&#x27; life and observations of his Greek heritage. It is not an autobiography; unlike the protagonist, Eugenides is not intersex. The author decided to write &quot;Middlesex&quot; after reading the 1980 memoir &quot;Herculine Barbin&quot; and finding himself dissatisfied with its discussion of intersex anatomy and emotions.

Primarily a coming-of-age story (&quot;Bildungsroman&quot;) and family saga, the 21st-century gender novel chronicles the effect of a mutated gene on three generations of a Greek family, causing momentous changes in the protagonist&#x27;s life. According to scholars, the novel&#x27;s main themes are nature versus nurture, rebirth, and the differing experiences of what society constructs as polar opposites, such as those found between men and women. It discusses the pursuit of the American Dream and explores gender identity. The novel contains many allusions to Greek mythology, including creatures such as the Minotaur, half-man and half-bull, and the Chimera, a monster composed of various animal parts.

Narrator and protagonist Cal Stephanides (initially called &quot;Callie&quot;) is an intersex man of Greek descent with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, which causes him to have certain feminine traits. The first half of the novel is about Cal&#x27;s family and depicts his grandparents&#x27; migration from Bursa, a city in Turkey, to the United States in 1922. It follows their assimilation into U.S. society in Detroit, Michigan, then a booming industrial city. The latter half of the novel, set in the late 20th century, focuses on Cal&#x27;s experiences in his hometown of Detroit and his escape to San Francisco, where he comes to terms with his modified gender identity.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; considered &quot;Middlesex&quot; one of the best books of 2002, and some scholars believed the novel should be considered for the title of Great American Novel. Generally, reviewers felt that the novel succeeded in portraying its Greek immigrant drama and were also impressed with Eugenides&#x27; depiction of his hometown of Detroit, praising him for his social commentary. Reviewers from the medical, gay, and intersex communities mostly praised &quot;Middlesex&quot;, though some intersex commentators have been more critical. In 2007, the book was featured in Oprah&#x27;s Book Club.

==Conception, research, and publication==
After publishing his first novel, &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;, in 1993, Jeffrey Eugenides started on his next project &quot;Middlesex&quot;. He was inspired by having read &quot;Herculine Barbin&quot;, the diary of a 19th-century French convent schoolgirl who was intersex. Eugenides had first read the memoir in 1984 and believed it evaded discussion about the anatomy and emotions of intersex people. He intended &quot;Middlesex&quot; to be &quot;the story [he] wasn&#x27;t getting from the memoir&quot;.
Eugenides worked on &quot;Middlesex&quot; for nine years. He started writing during his short-term residence at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, United States, and finished the novel in Berlin, Germany; he had accepted a grant from the German Academic Exchange Service in 1999. Eugenides spent the first few years trying to establish the narrative voice for his novel. He wanted to &quot;[tell] epic events in the third person and psychosexual events in the first person&quot;. According to Eugenides, the voice &quot;had to render the experience of a teenage girl and an adult man, or an adult male-identified hermaphrodite&quot;.

Although Eugenides sought expert advice about intersex, sexology, and the formation of gender identity, he refrained from meeting with intersex people, saying, &quot;[I] decided not to work in that reportorial mode. Instead of trying to create a separate person, I tried to pretend that I had this [physical feature] and that I had lived through this as much as I could&quot;. Eugenides read books, sifted through many sheets of microfiche, and combed through videotapes and newsletters that dealt with the subject. He visited the New York Public Library&#x27;s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture to search for the sole copy of a book about an &quot;elusive historical figure&quot;. He discovered details of what he considered a vivid intersex condition while browsing Columbia University&#x27;s medical library.

After discovering in his library research 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, an autosomal recessive condition manifested primarily in inbred, isolated population groups, his perception of the novel significantly changed. Rather than a &quot;slim fictional autobiography&quot; of an intersex individual, the novel would be epic in scope, tracing the lives of three generations of Greek Americans. Eugenides lived in Brooklyn when he began his first draft of the novel. He went through a lengthy brainstorming process. He would write 50 pages in one voice, restart in a different voice with 75 pages, and then pursue a different narrative angle. He wanted the novel to be an &quot;intimate&quot; portrayal of protagonist Cal&#x27;s transformation, so he wrote a draft in the first-person narrative in Cal&#x27;s voice. He could not, however, portray Cal&#x27;s grandparents intimately, so he completely abandoned his preceding year&#x27;s draft in favor of writing the book in the third-person. He gradually violated his narrative convention by restoring the first-person voice amid the third-person narration to depict the mindsets of both Cal and Cal&#x27;s grandparents. During the writing process, Eugenides moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan and later returned to Brooklyn. Worried about the narrative&#x27;s sounding forced, he added instances of &quot;self-reflexivity&quot; to Cal&#x27;s voice. After several years of struggling with the narrative voice, Eugenides finally seated himself at his desk and wrote &quot;Middlesex&quot;″s initial page, &quot;500 words that contained the DNA for the protein synthesis of the entire book.&quot;

&quot;Middlesex&quot; was published for the North American market in September 2002 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in the United States and Vintage Canada for Canada. A month later, it was released in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury Publishing. The novel has been translated into 34 languages; the Spanish-language edition was translated by Benito Gómez Ibáñez and released in 2003 after the publisher, Jorge Herralde, had acquired the rights in a &quot;tough auction&quot;.

==Plot==

Cal Stephanides (his masculine identity), also known as Calliope (feminine), recounts how 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, a recessive condition, caused him to be born with female characteristics. The book continues with accounts of his family&#x27;s history and the conception of Cal, his childhood and teenage years being raised as a girl, and the discovery of his intersex condition. Cal weaves his opinion of the events in hindsight from his life after his father&#x27;s funeral. &quot;Middlesex&quot; is set in the 20th century and interjects historical elements, such as the Balkan Wars, the Nation of Islam, the 1967 Detroit riot, and the Watergate scandal into the story.
In 1922, Cal&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Eleutherios &quot;Lefty&quot; Stephanides, lives in Bithynios, a village in Asia Minor. In the small village, high on the slope of Mount Olympos above the city of Bursa, incestuous marriages between cousins are a quietly accepted practice. Lefty makes a living selling silkworm cocoons harvested by his sister, Desdemona. The siblings are orphans; their parents are victims of the ongoing Greco-Turkish War. Lefty and Desdemona develop a romantic relationship as the war progresses. They flee the chaos brought by the war on a ship to the United States amid the Great Fire of Smyrna. Their histories unknown to the other passengers, they marry each other on board the vessel.

After arriving in New York, they locate and stay with their cousin Sourmelina &quot;Lina&quot; Zizmo, in Detroit, Michigan, a closeted lesbian and the only person who knows of the siblings&#x27; incestuous relationship. Lefty takes a job at Ford Motor Company, but is later retrenched. He unknowingly joins Lina&#x27;s husband, Jimmy, in bootlegging. Desdemona gives birth to a son, Milton, and a daughter, Zoe. Lina gives birth to a daughter, Theodora or &quot;Tessie&quot;. The relationship between Lefty and Desdemona declines after she learns that there is an increased chance of genetic disease for children born from incest. In 1924, after Milton&#x27;s birth, Lefty opens a bar and gambling den called the Zebra Room.

Milton and Tessie marry in 1946. They have two children, Chapter Eleven and Calliope (&quot;Callie&quot;). Prior to Callie&#x27;s birth, Desdemona predicts the child to be a boy, although the parents prepare for a girl. Chapter Eleven is a biologically &quot;normal&quot; boy; however, Callie is intersex. Unaware of this, her family raise Callie as a girl. Elements of family life are portrayed against struggles in the rise and fall of industrial Detroit. The family gets caught up in the 1967 Detroit riot resulting from racial tensions, after President Johnson authorizes the use of federal troops, and the family restaurant is raided during this period. Fleeing school integration, the family moves to a house on Middlesex Boulevard, Grosse Pointe.

When she is 14 years old, Callie falls in love with her female best friend, whom Callie refers to as the &quot;Obscure Object&quot;. In separate encounters, Callie has her first sexual experiences with a woman, the Obscure Object, and with a man, the Obscure Object&#x27;s brother. After Callie is injured by a tractor, a doctor discovers that she is intersex. She undergoes tests and examinations at a clinic in New York, and it is determined that her body will naturally develop more masculine traits. After learning about the syndrome and facing the prospect of sex reassignment surgery to make her anatomy appear &quot;normally&quot; female, Callie runs away and assumes a male identity as Cal, who hitchhikes cross-country and reaches San Francisco, where he joins a burlesque show as Hermaphroditus.

Cal is arrested by police during a raid on his workplace. He is released into Chapter Eleven&#x27;s custody and learns of their father&#x27;s recent death. The siblings return to their family home on Middlesex. Desdemona privately confesses to Cal that her husband is also her brother, recognizing Cal&#x27;s condition and associating it with stories from her old village about children born of incest. As Milton&#x27;s funeral takes place at the church, Cal stands in the doorway of his family home, assuming the male-only role in Greek traditions to keep his father&#x27;s spirit from re-entering the home.

Years later, Cal becomes a diplomat stationed in Berlin. He meets Julie Kikuchi, a Japanese-American woman, and tentatively starts a relationship with her after telling her about his past.

==Autobiographical elements==

Reporters and critics noted that many characters and events in &quot;Middlesex&quot; parallel those in Eugenides&#x27; life. The author denied writing the novel as an autobiography. In an interview by &quot;National Public Radio&quot; in 2002, he commented on the similarities:
Eugenides blended fact and fiction in his book. Like Cal, the author was born in 1960; unlike his creation, he is not intersex or transgender. His family moved to a house on Middlesex Road in Grosse Pointe after the Detroit riot in 1967. Eugenides studied at University Liggett School, a private institution that served as a model for Callie&#x27;s Baker and Inglis School for Girls. He tapped into his own &quot;locker room trauma&quot;, an adolescent experience of being naked among many other nude bodies, and used it to develop Callie&#x27;s self-discovery of her body during puberty. He based the name of the character the &quot;Obscure Object&quot; on a Brown University classmate whom he found alluring and to whom he gave that nickname. Eugenides married a Japanese-American artist, Karen Yamauchi, and moved to Berlin.

Eugenides is of Greek heritage, albeit only through his father&#x27;s side. Although his paternal grandparents were not siblings like the Stephanides, they were silk farmers like their fictional counterparts. Also like Cal, Eugenides learned some Greek customs to help himself understand his grandparents better. The Zebra Room and the bartender profession are other items shared by their grandfathers; Eugenides said the inclusion of the bar was a deliberate &quot;secret code of paying homage to my grandparents and my parents.&quot; Several aspects of Chapter Eleven were based on Eugenides&#x27; elder brother, who withdrew from society during a &quot;hippie phase&quot; in his life. While revising and editing the book, the author removed information that could be offensive to his relatives. Not all such material was excised, Eugenides said: &quot;There may still be things in there that will sting.&quot;

==Style==
Several reviewers considered &quot;Middlesex&quot; to be overly verbose. &quot;The Economist&quot; described the novel as &quot;ponderous&quot; and said that the main story (that of Cal) does not &quot;get off the ground until halfway through&quot; the book. &quot;Time&quot;″s Richard Lacayo concurred; he considered the hundreds of pages about Cal&#x27;s grandparents and several historical events to be trite, making &quot;Middlesex&quot;″s focus &quot;footloose&quot; in some spots. Several passages in the novel exhibit Eugenides&#x27; obsession with &quot;verbose voluptuousness&quot;. An example noted by Thea Hillman in her review is an incident in which Cal says, &quot;I sat in my seat, in a state of voluptuous agitation, of agitated voluptuousness, until my stop. Then I staggered out.&quot; A contrary opinion is given by Daniel Soar in his article for the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;. According to Soar, Eugenides did &quot;both background and foreground in all the necessary detail&quot;, seamlessly shifting from past to present. Despite the implausible tone of the novel&#x27;s events, the author successfully makes them &quot;elaborately justified and motivated&quot;. The quality of &quot;Middlesex&quot;″s writing was uneven in the opinions of Hillman and another reviewer, Sebastian Smee. The latter pointed out that Eugenides occasionally moves from the heartfelt (&quot;I remember the first time we took off our clothes in front of each other. It was like unwinding bandages&quot;) to the &quot;trashily journalistic&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;ve heard of installation artists? Well, the Object [a heavy smoker] was an exhalation artist&quot;) on several occasions.

Humor and irony are frequently used in the book. Mark Lawson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; considered the narrator&#x27;s tone to be &quot;sardonic[ally] empath[etic]&quot;, and other critics have characterized the beginning of the novel as comical. When Cal is baptized as an infant by Father Mike, a Greek Orthodox cleric, the priest receives a surprise: &quot;From between my cherubic legs a stream of crystalline liquid shot into the air ... Propelled by a full bladder, it cleared the lip of the font ... [and] struck Father Mike right in the middle of the face.&quot; Derek Weiler of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; noted that Eugenides has witty commentary about German compound words and the &quot;horrific qualities of public men&#x27;s rooms&quot;. The author employed another writing device—abrupt incongruity—in describing Desdemona&#x27;s physical appearances to suggest that her incestuous acts should be taken lightly when judging her. In describing her hair, he wrote that her &quot;braids were not delicate like a little girl&#x27;s but heavy and womanly, possessing a natural power, like a beaver&#x27;s tail&quot;. According to Penelope Music of &quot;Book Magazine&quot;, the mismatch in tone of the final two words compared with the rest of the sentence was such that the reading experience was changed from &quot;run-of-the-mill magical realism to true, subversive comedy&quot;. An instance of irony is illustrated by Cal&#x27;s grandparents and parents: His grandparents assimilate into American culture through hard work and struggles while retaining certain old customs. His parents, however, abandon their roots for a more comfortable lifestyle. In another incident, the diner owned by the Stephanides is engulfed in flames during the 1967 Detroit riot. Cal notes that &quot;[s]hameful as it is to say, the riots were the best thing that ever happened to us.&quot; The diner was insured and the Stephanides gain a windfall payout.

===Narrative modes===
&quot;Middlesex&quot; is written in the form of a memoir, and switches between the first and the third person in several spots. Used as a comedic device, the third person narratives illustrate Cal&#x27;s estrangement from Calliope: When he refers to her in the third person, he is identifying her as someone other than him. Patricia Chu, a scholar of English literature, noted the effectiveness of this style in the chapter in which the adolescent Callie searches for information on hermaphroditism. As the teenager reads &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, following the trail of definitions related to her condition, she reaches the entry for hermaphrodite. The narration switches from personal to external, lending poignancy to the character&#x27;s final discovery as she confronts the word &quot;monster&quot;.

Although the protagonist switches gender throughout the book, Cal&#x27;s manners of speech and thought are identical to Callie&#x27;s. Believing that males and females have no inherent disparities in their writing styles, Eugenides treated Cal and Callie as the same person, in terms of narrative voice. He also fixed the narrative voice in terms of age by setting up Cal to relate the entire story at one time. Eugenides gave his protagonist a mostly male outlook, justifying his treatment with the reasoning that Cal or Callie was a man in terms of appearance, sexual desires, and the brain. He asked his wife and other women to review his approaches on Cal&#x27;s feminine views. The &quot;emotional stuff&quot; was accurate but Eugenides had to refine certain details, such as those about toenail polish.

At the beginning of the book when Cal discusses his family&#x27;s history and actions prior to his birth, he speaks in an androgynous voice, with limited omniscience; he acknowledges that he is fabricating some of the details. John Mullan, University College London&#x27;s professor of English and a contributor to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote that by permitting Cal to be unrealistically aware of fellow characters&#x27; thoughts, Eugenides intentionally contravenes an elementary standard in storytelling fiction. In the novel&#x27;s closing pages, Cal provides minute details about his father&#x27;s dying moments and thoughts in a nonsensical car accident even though he is several thousand miles from the scene and only learns of the tragedy from his brother. Cal has the ability to dwell in the minds of others because as a female who has become a male, his identity is not confined by his own body. According to Mullan, this &quot;mobility of identification becomes a narrative principle&quot; and is thoroughly exploited in &quot;Middlesex&quot;. The novel follows the principle that people are molded by events prior to their birth, and Eugenides explores a character&#x27;s prenatal life in terms of his or her genes; the narrator is, however, subject to the principle that whatever he does not know is of his imagination. As such, contradictory statements highlight the unreliable nature of Cal&#x27;s narration. While narrating the story that pre-dates his birth, he remarks, &quot;Of course, a narrator in my position (prefetal at the time) can&#x27;t be entirely sure about any of this.&quot; However, he later says, &quot;I alone, from the private box of my primordial egg, saw what was going on.&quot; Cal&#x27;s dubious omniscience, doubtful narration, and parodies combine to show that his unreliability is an act of mischief.

Mullan remarked that Eugenides&#x27; narrator has a proclivity to reveal events that will happen in the future. Cal is a narrator who is absorbed in how his fate has been shaped. Cal eschews a chronological telling of the story, where he shares the characters&#x27; nescience. He chooses instead to relate the story beginning with his future knowledge. Cal&#x27;s genes reflect an anticipation of the future: the disclosure of his actual sex identity. Cal mimics this &quot;genetic inevitability&quot; by enjoining the readers to know the future prior to its occurring. Mullan observed that &quot;[f]or the reader, apprehension predominates over surprise&quot; as a result of this narrative style.

===Genres===
The &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described &quot;Middlesex&quot; as a &quot;virtuosic combination of elegy, sociohistorical study, and picaresque adventure&quot;, and Adam Begley in the &quot;New York Observer&quot; called it &quot;a hybrid form, epic crossed with history, romance, comedy, tragedy.&quot; Other reviews also categorized the book under various genres. Covering the lives of three generations of the Stephanides family, &quot;Middlesex&quot; is considered a family saga by novelist Geraldine Bedell. The book is more than a mere family saga, according to Samuel Cohen in his paper for &quot;Twentieth Century Literature&quot;; it depicts the Stephanides&#x27; trials and tribulations through historical events. Cohen is not convinced by Eugenides&#x27; declaration that &quot;Middlesex&quot; was not conceived as a historical novel; he said the novel satisfied much of the criterion for the genre. Cal, narrating his story in 2002, describes events from the early 1920s to the mid-1970s. According to Cohen, the difference in timeframes, at least 25 years apart, &quot;establishes that the novel is set safely in the past&quot;.

According to Stewart O&#x27;Nan of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Cal&#x27;s narration evokes the style of the picaresque novel, retelling events that have already occurred and foreshadowing the future through &quot;portentous glimpses&quot;. Francisco Collado-Rodríguez, a professor of American literature, classified the beginning of &quot;Middlesex&quot; as a historiographical and metafictional chronicle for its discussion of events such as the Greco-Turkish war and the Great Fire of Smyrna. He also considered the first section of the novel as a tragicomedy about the Stephanides&#x27; migration from Greece and assimilation into America. Soar posited Desdemona and Lefty&#x27;s passage as a romantic comedy: the lovers, brother and sister, pretend to be strangers who meet for the first time, attempting &quot;to unknow themselves, to remythologise themselves by developing a past they could live with, unfamiliar and therefore permissible&quot;. As the story progresses, &quot;Middlesex&quot; becomes a social novel about Detroit, discussing the seclusion of living in a 1970s suburb. At the end of the novel, the story adopts the tone of the detective genre.

The novel is characterized as a &quot;dramatic&quot; &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; with a &quot;big twist&quot; because the coming-of-age story is revealed to be the incorrect one: after being nurtured as a woman, Cal must instead learn to become a man. The book has &quot;two distinct and occasionally warring halves&quot;. Whereas the first part is about hermaphrodites, the second is about Greeks. The latter half, &quot;full of incest, violence, and terrible family secrets&quot;, was considered by Daniel Mendelsohn, an author and critic, to be more effective because &quot;Middlesex&quot; is largely about how Callie inherited the momentous gene that &quot;ends up defining her indefinable life&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, James Wood classified &quot;Middlesex&quot; as a story written in the vein of hysterical realism. He said the novel is influenced by its own recounting of &quot;excitements, patternings, and implausibilities that lie on the soft side of magical realism&quot;. Such moments in the book include how two cousins conceive &quot;on the same night and at the same moment&quot; and how years later, those children marry each other. Woods also pointed out the seeming coincidences that involved locales. Smyrna is the burning city from which she flees to start a new life; New Smyrna Beach is where she spends her retirement. Effectively serving as a double entendre, the title of the book refers to the name of the street where Cal stays at and describes his situation: a hermaphrodite brought up as a girl but who decides to become a boy. Cal&#x27;s condition is also reflected in his choice of locale to narrate the novel: Berlin is a city formerly of &quot;two halves or sexes&quot; (East and West).

==Themes==

===Rebirth===
Following the Great Fire of Smyrna, Lefty and Desdemona must start life anew. When she is 14 years old, Callie experiences a second birth to become Cal. To become a male, Callie peregrinates across the United States and becomes a midwife of her new life by teaching herself to forget what she has learned as a female. Likewise, Cal&#x27;s grandparents undergo a transformation, becoming husband and wife instead of brother and sister. &quot;Middlesex&quot; delves into the concept of identity, including how it is formed and how it is administered. The immigrant predicament is a metaphor and synecdoche for Calliope&#x27;s hermaphroditic condition; Callie&#x27;s paternal grandparents become Americanized through the amalgamation of the elements of heredity, cultural metamorphoses, and probability. Callie&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Jimmy Zizmo, undergoes a rebirth when he transforms from a bootlegger into Fard Muhammad, a Muslim minister.

===American Dream===
&quot;Middlesex&quot; traces the trials and adversity faced by the Stephanides family as they pursue the American Dream. Beginning with Lefty and Desdemona, Cal&#x27;s grandparents, fleeing from their homeland to Ellis Island and the United States, the novel later depicts the family living in a suburban vista at Grosse Pointe, Michigan. After they immigrate to the United States, Lefty and Desdemona find themselves in a blissful America on the brink of economic collapse. They dream about a perfect America where effort and morals will lead to good fortune. However, they must seek to attain this perfection during a period characterized by Prohibition and xenophobic anti-immigration legislation. &quot;Middlesex&quot; depicts the tribulations of attaining an identity, especially while dealing with the revelation that the American Dream is a delusion that has already disappeared.

===Race relations===
&quot;Middlesex&quot; portrays the race relations between people of different cultures; Mendelsohn considered the handling of this theme &quot;preachy and nervous&quot;. In the United States, a strongly nativist country in the 1920s, Greek immigrants must suffer numerous humiliations at the hands of prejudiced whites. When Cal&#x27;s grandfather Lefty, a recent Greek immigrant, is working at one of Henry Ford&#x27;s automobile factories, Ford investigators attempt to Americanize him. They visit his house to ascertain that he has been living as a typical American. For example, during his first English-language lesson, Lefty is taught that &quot;[e]mployees should use plenty of soap and water in the home&quot;. The narrow-minded nativists believe that immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe are unaware of the value of soap and water.

According to scholar Robert Zecker, the novel depicts African-American poverty but does not illustrate its causes. None of the characters think about how 500,000 African-Americans were placed in cramped living areas of only 25 square blocks and the bitterness and rage that stems from such conditions. The African Americans do not forget the years of oppression they have endured. However, the Greek Americans, like other whites, fail to remember that the African Americans were assaulted by whites in 1943 and faced over two decades of oppression after that. Instead, Zecker noted that the characters in the novel believe that the 1967 Detroit riots are &quot;inexplicable cataclysms that came out of nowhere&quot;.

The novel skims over the brutal attacks, lasting a week, on blacks in Detroit during World War II. Years later, in 1967, Lefty is incorrectly told that that year&#x27;s Detroit riots were started by a black man raping a white woman; this falsehood is never rectified. However, despite this misinformation, Lefty denies service to a number of white customers who partook in the riots. One dismissed customer even yells at him, &quot;[w]hy don&#x27;t you go back to your own country?&quot;, returning the spotlight of racial prejudice on him.

The relationship between the Greek Americans and the African Americans is fraught with prejudice. For example, during the Depression, Desdemona is shocked and humiliated that she will have to work in the Black Bottom, a predominantly black neighborhood. When African Americans are beaten or taken advantage of by whites, the characters in &quot;Middlesex&quot; &quot;suddenly are nearsighted&quot; to the racial prejudice. Despite being in the United States for only 10 years and having experienced racism herself, she can, Zecker noted, &quot;recite at heart the slights at blacks as lazy, dirty, sexually promiscuous, and incapable of self-help.&quot; She and other whites, including immigrant whites, feel rage because they are &quot;convinced they were somehow forced out of Detroit following 1967.&quot; While walking through the neighborhood, a group of African-American men loafing in front of a barbershop wolf-whistle to Desdemona and make lascivious comments, thus confirming the racial stereotype.

Zecker remarked that in an ironic twist, immediately after the riots, Desdemona&#x27;s family is shamed by a white realtor who &quot;doubts their fitness (whiteness)&quot; to live in the rich suburb of Grosse Pointe. In the 1970s, African Americans, instead of Mediterraneans, were discriminated against through redlining. Zecker opined that by framing African Americans as the &quot;eternal destroyers&quot; and white ethnics as &quot;yet again the oppressed innocents&quot;, Eugenides &quot;captures perfectly the dominant narrative of urban decline in the early twenty-first century American Zeitgeist.&quot; Insurance settlement from the damage caused at the riots allows the Stephanides to purchase a home away from the African Americans. The family joins the white flight from the city to avoid the racial desegregation in the public schools, sending Cal to a private school.

===Ethnic identity===
When Lefty and Desdemona are forced to immigrate to the United States, they have different mindsets. Whereas Lefty embraces his new country&#x27;s customs, Desdemona is adamant that she will follow her old country&#x27;s ways. For example, she is angered that her &quot;immigrant hair&quot; is chopped off because she does not want to &quot;look like an &quot;Amerikanidha&quot;&quot; and decides to regrow her hair immediately. Lefty attempts to assimilate into American culture by zealously learning English. Lina, the cousin of Lefty and Desdemona, is the paragon of immigrant integration. Cal noted: &quot;In the five years since leaving Turkey, Sourmelina had managed to erase just about everything identifiably Greek about her.&quot;

Cal&#x27;s father, Milton, and his friends and family cherish their Sunday gatherings. They debate and tell stories to each other, attempting to regain their ethnic roots. A &quot;contrarian&quot;, Milton enjoys debating Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger and lamenting the steep cost of church candles. Eugenides repeatedly returns to the gathering prior to Cal&#x27;s conception, to &quot;manufacture a psychology that drives his narration&quot;. As the immigrants attempt to maintain their identity, the stage is set for Cal&#x27;s writing even before he is conceived.

&quot;Middlesex&quot; delves into the schism and reconciling of two opposites by contrasting the experiences and opinions of males and females; Greek Americans and White Anglo-Saxon Protestants; Greeks and Turks; and African Americans and White Americans. Critic Raoul Eshelman noted that despite these conflicts, the narrator is able to achieve &quot;ethnic reconciliation&quot; when he moves to Berlin and lives with the Turks, who had murdered his forebears in the early 20th century and who had indirectly enabled his grandparents to consummate their incestuous relationship. Alkarim Jivani opined on BBC Television&#x27;s current affairs broadcast &quot;Newsnight&quot; that &quot;[o]nly a child of the Diaspora can do that, because we stand on the threshold of two rooms.&quot; The novel also demonstrates that love and family are vital not only to people with unambiguous genders, but also hermaphrodites.

The Greek immigrant family experiences a three-phase acculturation that occurs to immigrant families, according to scholar Merton Lee&#x27;s research about sociologist George A. Kourvetaris&#x27; work. Each generation identifies with different nationalities and cultures. In the first generation, the family members classify themselves as having a Greek nationality. In the second generation, the children classify themselves with an American nationality and Greek Orthodox religion. In the third generation, the grandchildren, who comprise the most acculturated group, characterize themselves with &quot;Greek-immigration status as a class&quot;.

The Stephanides lineage is from Bithynios, a village in Asia Minor where the Greek middleman minority is inclined to be in uneasy relations with the Turkish majority. The people of the middleman minority do not assimilate because of their small mercantile businesses and because their host country is antagonistic toward them. Desdemona, a first-generation Greek immigrant, reflects a fixation with not assimilating. She tells her husband Lefty that she does not want to become an &quot;Amerikanidha&quot; and is frightened that her cousin Lina&#x27;s husband, Jimmy Zizmo, is a Pontian Greek. Desdemona considers Pontians to be adulterated Greeks because Pontians inhabited Turkey, where some became Muslims and did not follow the Greek Orthodox religion.

Daniel Soar opined that Olympus, a parallel to Bithynios, served well as the starting point of a debacle (the eventual birth of an intersex person) that is the &quot;story&#x27;s catalyst&quot;. In Mount Olympus during Justinian&#x27;s days, silkworm eggs were contraband transported from China to Byzantium by missionaries. A parallel is drawn when Desdemona, a raiser of silk cocoons, attempts to bring them to Detroit. Because the silkworm eggs are considered parasites by the immigration officials, Desdemona must dispose of them. Soar noted that &quot;for the three generations of Greek Americans who people &quot;Middlesex&quot;, the mulberry trees of Mount Olympus are an appropriately antique beginning: they are the egg inside which everything began&quot;.

===Greek mythical allusions===
&quot;Middlesex&quot; has several allusions to Greek classical myths; for example, the protagonist is named after Calliope, the muse of heroic poetry. Eugenides was partly inspired by the explorations of hermaphrodism in Greek myths to write the novel about an intersex man. In &quot;Middlesex&quot;, Cal acts out the story of Hermaphroditus, the Greek deity of bisexuality and effeminacy, while eking out a living in San Francisco. While narrating, Cal enters his ancestors&#x27; thoughts and empathizes with them, an ability possessed by Hermaphroditus. The protagonist compared himself to another mythical figure—Tiresias, the blind prophet of Thebes; the omniscient seer lived seven years as a woman because of a curse.

Eugenides and several critics compared Cal&#x27;s condition to mythical creatures described by the ancient Greeks. The author alluded his protagonist&#x27;s nature and heritage to the Minotaur, the half-man and half-bull creature. Cal&#x27;s father is conceived after his grandparents&#x27; attendance of a theatric play entitled &quot;The Minotaur&quot;. The puzzle of Cal&#x27;s genetic identity is akin to the creature&#x27;s labyrinth, and the thread that leads out of the maze is held here by his paternal grandmother, a former silk farmer. Frances Bartkowski, a scholar of English, named Callie in her puberty as a chimera. The mythical monster is an analogy for a complex personality, a mixture of body parts from various animals that each represents a human aspect or characteristic. Similarly, adolescent Callie is an amalgamation of her genes, neither male nor female, neither adult nor child, and yet all of them at the same time.

In her book column for the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, Marta Salij said that Cal&#x27;s identity crisis resembles Odysseus&#x27;s fate. Whereas the mythical hero is troubled by Poseidon and succored by Athena, the intersex protagonist is affected by his chromosomes in a similar manner. John Sykes, professor of English and religion education, noted another Greek-hero reference. In a manner similar to Oedipus&#x27;s fulfillment of Pythia&#x27;s prophecy to slay his father and marry his mother, Callie validates the prediction her grandmother made before her birth by adopting a male identity. Eugenides also used the allusions to Greek mythology and modern pop music to show the passing of familial traits and idiosyncrasies from one generation to the next.

===Nature versus nurture===
The novel examines the nature versus nurture debate in detail. At the beginning of the novel, Cal writes, &quot;Sing now, O Muse, of the recessive mutation on my fifth chromosome.&quot; He then apologizes, saying, &quot;Sorry if I get a little Homeric at times. That&#x27;s genetic, too.&quot; This is an allusion to the poet Homer, who was also captivated with the nature versus nurture debate. In fact, Cal himself confesses, &quot;If you were going to devise an experiment to measure the relative influences of nature versus nurture, you couldn&#x27;t come up with anything better than my life.&quot;

Callie inherited the mutation for a gene that causes 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, which impedes the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. While the former hormone causes the brain to become masculine, it is the latter that molds male genitals. When Callie reaches puberty, her testosterone levels increase significantly, resulting in the formation of a larger Adam&#x27;s apple, the broadening of her muscles, the deepening of her voice, and the augmentation of her clitoris to resemble a penis. Doctors determine that Callie has the XY chromosomes of a male after inspecting Callie&#x27;s genitalia. Callie&#x27;s parents bring her to New York City to see Dr. Peter Luce, a foremost expert on hermaphroditism, who believes she should retain her female identity. Luce plans a gender reassignment surgery to make her a female. However, Callie knows that she is sexually attracted to females, and decides to run away to pursue a male identity. When Cal has a sexual relationship with the Japanese-American photographer Julie at the end of the book, he is able to love &quot;without the need to penetrate the object of his desire&quot;.

Mark Lawson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that the cause of Cal&#x27;s hermaphroditic condition is an inherited recessive gene. According to UC Riverside psychology professor Sonja Lyubomirsky, the novel examines how an individual&#x27;s traits are due neither solely to nature nor solely to nurture. Similarly, Cal&#x27;s gender cannot be defined solely as male or female. Rather, it is both male and female. Addressing how genetic determinism may have renewed the antediluvian beliefs about destiny, Eugenides refutes the post-Freudian beliefs that a person&#x27;s traits are mainly due to nurture. Thus, the novel pits evolutionary biology against free will. Eugenides sought to find a compromise between these two views. Explaining that gender is a &quot;very American concept&quot;, he believes that &quot;humans are freer than we realize. Less genetically encumbered.&quot;

===Gender identity and intersex status===
Raised as a girl, Cal views himself as a girl who likes other girls. His ability to have a &quot;feminine gender schema&quot; despite his having male genes, substantiates the constructionist position that gender identity is fully dependent on outer influences. However, when Callie discovers that he could have been raised as a boy, he renounces his female gender, recognizing his chosen gender identity as a male. Disowning the female gender before he learned about masculine traits bolsters the argument for the &quot;essentialist ideology of identity&quot;. Cal&#x27;s embrace of his inherent male identity and renunciation of his childhood female gender identity is articulated when he reflects, &quot;I never felt out of place being a girl, I still don&#x27;t feel entirely at home among men.&quot;

Cal exhibits many masculine characteristics when he is a child. He writes, &quot;I began to exude some kind of masculinity, in the way I tossed up and caught my eraser, for instance.&quot; In another incident, Cal discusses how his penchants were masculine. While his female classmates are turned off by the blood in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Cal is &quot;thrilled to [read about] the stabbings and beheadings, the gouging out of eyes, the juicy eviscerations.&quot; Cal ponders his gender identity and how males and females associate with each other, reflecting, &quot;Did I see through the male tricks because I was destined to scheme that way myself? Or do girls see through the tricks, too, and just pretend not to notice?&quot;

Cal also exhibits feminine characteristics, which allows Dr. Luce to classify her as possessing a female gender identity. In a home video taken when Cal was a child, his mother gives him a doll and he nurses it with a milk bottle. Luce carefully observes Callie&#x27;s actions and diagnoses them as feminine, which causes him to determine that Callie has a feminine gender identity. Luce then concludes that gender identity is nurtured and etched into children at their young ages.

Determining sex is paradoxical because the characters believe that the outward view of genitalia identifies one&#x27;s sex; Cal&#x27;s transformation into a male shatters this belief and the methodology behind determining gender. Eugenides addresses how difficult it was for humans to devise a &quot;universal classification for sex&quot;. Through Cal, scholar Angela Pattatucci Aragon stated, Eugenides opines that the 1876 system devised by Edwin Klebs that used gonad tissue to determine sex provides the most accurate answer.

According to intersex activist and academic Morgan Holmes, Eugenides posits that a person&#x27;s sexual attraction determines his or her gender. Cal&#x27;s wish to become male because he desires females demonstrates a link between gender identity and sexuality. While Callie is not permitted to love the Obscure Object openly, Cal can freely love Julie. Holmes believed that the depiction of Callie &quot;denies the legitimate place of lesbian desire and rewrites it as male heterosexuality.&quot; Book reviewer Georgia Warnke has a similar view. She wrote that by making these choices in the novel, Eugenides agrees with the belief that being attracted to females is &quot;masculine&quot; and thus it is &quot;more natural&quot; for a male to be attracted to a female than a female be attracted to a female. Daniel Mendelsohn of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; argued that Callie does not have to be a male in order to be drawn towards females; she could be gay. As an adult, Cal brags, &quot;Breasts have the same effect on me as on anyone with my testosterone level.&quot; Mendelsohn noted that this assertion will astonish &quot;Eugenides&#x27;s (presumably testosterone-rich) gay male readership&quot;. Scholar Rachel Carroll agreed, writing that teenage Callie&#x27;s erotic interest in girls is &quot;retroactively explained and legitimized, by the discovery of his &#x27;true biological nature&#x27;.&quot; Cal&#x27;s gender identity postdates rather than predates his sexual interests. Carroll posited that Cal&#x27;s inability to form heterosexual relationships as an adult is founded not upon his being intersex, but on his rejection of the sexual ambiguities that form his sexual interests as a youth.

When Callie is in New York, she goes to the New York Public Library and searches for the meaning of the word &quot;hermaphrodite&quot;; she is shocked when the dictionary entry concludes with &quot;See synonyms at MONSTER&quot;. Callie is not a Frankenstein; she is more like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. Bartkowski stated that Eugenides&#x27; message is &quot;we must let our monsters out—they demand and deserve recognition—they are us: our same, self, others.&quot; Morgan Holmes, formerly of ISNA, describes how the book constructs an intersex character whose life reproduces &quot;social fascination with the monstrous and the deviant.&quot;

Seven Graham wrote in &quot;Ariel&quot;, a journal published by the University of Calgary, that Eugenides&#x27; &quot;persisen[t]&quot; use of the word &quot;hermaphrodite&quot;, instead of &quot;intersex&quot;, alludes to Hermaphroditus. Hermaphroditus, a young man, is chased by the nymph Salmacis. She begs the Gods to bind her and Hermaphroditus together, and the Gods literally fulfill her wish. Hermaphroditus&#x27; name is a compound of his parents&#x27; names—Hermes and Aphrodite. He instantaneously turns into someone of both sexes. Devastated because he is no longer fully male, he &quot;curses&quot; the location where he first met Salmacis. Graham stated that the use of &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; carries negative connotations: Based on this origin story, the hermaphrodite&#x27;s lot is miserable, associated with disempowerment, the theft of identity and an unhappy dual existence. In addition, the term &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; may be deemed problematic because it alludes to an impossible state of being: no-one can be equally male and female and the preferred term &quot;intersex&quot; indicates a blended rather than divided state. While the modern term might indicate the possibility of redefining sexual ambivalence, Cal is associated in the novel with the mythic term and all it connotes. His connection to this tragic figure is confirmed by his performance as &quot;Hermaphroditus&quot; in a sex show at the age of fourteen, just as he is beginning his female to male transition.

Writing that he belongs to the Intersex Society of America, Cal notes that he has not participated in any of the group&#x27;s rallies because he is not a &quot;political person&quot;. While discussing political activism, Cal uses the word &quot;intersex&quot;, though in other parts of the novel, he uses the word &quot;hermaphrodite&quot;. In the 1920s, Bernice L. Hausman described &quot;intersexuality&quot; as a &quot;continuum of physiological and anatomical sex differences&quot;, contesting the notion of a &quot;true sex&quot; concealed in the tissues of the body. Though &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; is burdened by the implications of the anomaly, &quot;intersexuality&quot; is a neologism that tries to &quot;naturalize various sexes, which themselves are naturally occurring.&quot; Because Cal uses &quot;hermaphrodite&quot;, he indicates that the sole normal genders are the classifications of male and female. Eugenides was asked by an Oprah&#x27;s Book Club member why he used the term &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; despite its usage being &quot;either terribly ignorant or unforgivably callous&quot;. Eugenides replied that he reserved &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; for a literary character: Hermaphroditus. He further stated: &quot;When speaking about real people, I should—and I do my best to—use the term &#x27;intersex&#x27;.&quot; Noting that one of the initial sources he consulted was the journal &quot;Hermaphrodites with Attitude&quot; published by the Intersex Society of North America, he said that those writers have &quot;co-opted&quot; the term &quot;hermaphrodite&quot;. Their action is reminiscent, Eugenides wrote, of how some members of the gay community have &quot;reclaimed&quot; the term &quot;queer&quot;. Eugenides stated that it is no surprise that Cal uses &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; and further elaborated: &quot;It&#x27;s paradoxical: Cal can say &#x27;hermaphodite&#x27; but I can&#x27;t. Or shouldn&#x27;t.&quot;

===Incest and intersex===
Incest and intersex is another theme in &quot;Middlesex&quot;. Eugenides examines the passionate feelings that siblings living in seclusion experience for each other. Milton and Tessie, second cousins, are conceived during the same night, hinting to the incest of Desdemona and Lefty. Desdemona and Lefty&#x27;s incestuous relationship is a transgression of a powerful taboo, indicating that someone will suffer for their wrongs; in a way, Cal&#x27;s intersex condition symbolizes this Greek hubris. In another incestuous relationship, Milton makes love to Tessie using a clarinet which he lovingly rubs against her; their incestuous relationship enables them to contribute mutated genes to their child Cal. Cal&#x27;s mother interferes with fate by attempting to make her second child a daughter. Cal believes this interference was a factor in his being intersex. Conversely, Cal&#x27;s relationship with his brother, Chapter Eleven, is indicative of the possible dissimilarities that are products of the biosocial.

Thea Hillman, an intersex activist and board member for the (now defunct) Intersex Society of North America (ISNA), wrote in the &quot;Lambda Book Report&quot;, 2002, that the combination of incest and intersex is &quot;inaccurate and misleading&quot;. Noting that incest is a loathed social taboo that has &quot;shameful, pathological and criminal repercussions&quot;, she criticized Eugenides for underscoring that Cal&#x27;s intersex condition is due to incest. Hillman stated that this adds to the fallacious belief that intersex people are &quot;shameful and sick&quot; and a danger to society&#x27;s wellbeing.

Seven Graham agrees with Hillman and Holmes, writing that Cal is paralleled with the tragic Greek mythological characters Hermaphroditus, Tiresias, and the Minotaur. They opined that other &quot;deviant&quot; characters in the novel such as Lefty and Desdemona are spared the &quot;tragic or monstrous&quot; allusions even though there are numerous examples of incest in Greek mythology. They listed the marriage of Oedipus and his mother Jocasta, as well as the son Adonis produced by the incest between Theias and his daughter Smyrna as examples. Therefore, Graham stated that comparing Cal, an intersex person, to people who were &quot;mythological monsters&quot; is &quot;complicit with [the] exploitation&quot; of intersex people.

==Reception==

===Honors and adaptation===

In 2003, &quot;Middlesex&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The Pulitzer Board wrote in their report that &quot;Middlesex&quot; is a &quot;vastly realized, multi-generational novel as highspirited as it is intelligent . . . Like the masks of Greek drama, Middlesex is equal parts comedy and tragedy, but its real triumph is its emotional abundance, delivered with consummate authority and grace.&quot; Eugenides was attending the Prague Writers&#x27; Festival when &quot;Middlesex&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize. When a young Associated Press photographer notified him about winning the award, Eugenides was dubious, noting that &quot;[i]t seemed very unlikely that he would be the messenger of such news.&quot; At the time, Eugenides was with the Canadian author Yann Martel who confirmed the photographer&#x27;s words after checking on the hotel&#x27;s computer. A waiter brought champagne to Eugenides, and Greek women started kissing him. When journalists called Eugenides, he declined to take their calls, saying in an interview later that he wanted to &quot;celebrate the moment instead of leaping immediately into the media maelstrom.&quot;
The novel received the Ambassador Book Award, Spain&#x27;s Santiago de Compostela Literary Prize, and the Great Lakes Book Award. In 2003, it was a finalist in the fictional category of the National Book Critics Circle Award. &quot;Middlesex&quot; was also a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award, which is given to LGBT literature. In 2003, the novel was shortlisted for but did not win the International Dublin Literary Award. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; considered &quot;Middlesex&quot; to be one of the best books in 2002. In 2007, Oprah Winfrey chose &quot;Middlesex&quot; to be discussed in her book club. Eugenides was a guest on Oprah&#x27;s show with several intersex individuals who told stories about their lives. In 2011, Eugenides was interviewed by University College London English professor John Mullan in &quot;The Guardian&quot; Book Club. In 2024, the &quot;New York Times&quot; ranked it as #59 of the best 100 books of the 21st century.

The audiobook version of &quot;Middlesex&quot; was released by Macmillan Audio in September 2002. Read by Kristoffer Tabori, the audiobook has 28 sides, each side having a unique style of introductory music that complements the atmosphere and plot of the saga. In 2003, the audiobook received an Audie Award in the &quot;unabridged fiction&quot; category.

===Critical reception===
Some critics were dissatisfied with the scope of the novel. According to Book Marks, from American publications, the book received a &quot;mixed&quot; consensus, based on thirteen critics: four &quot;rave&quot;, three &quot;positive&quot;, two &quot;mixed&quot;, and four &quot;pan&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Guardian&quot;, and &quot;TLS&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;Independent On Sunday&quot;, and &quot;Literary Review&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Spectator&quot; review under &quot;Ok&quot;. On the January–February 2003 issue of &quot;Bookmarks&quot;, the book was scored four out of five. The magazine&#x27;s critical summary reads: &quot;It&#x27;s Cal&#x27;s narration that unites the critics: smart, insightful, wry, and very human&quot;. Globally, Complete Review noted a lack of consensus, summarizing that &quot;most quite enthusiastic.&quot;

Daniel Mendelsohn of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; wrote that thematically, there was no reason that a Greek should be an intersex or vice versa and that Eugenides had two disconnected stories to tell. Clay Risen of &quot;Flak Magazine&quot; believed that the immigrant experience was the &quot;heart of the novel&quot;, lamenting that it minimized the story of Callie/Cal who is such a &quot;fascinating character that the reader feels short-changed by his failure to take her/him further.&quot; Risen wished to read more about the events between Cal&#x27;s adolescence and adulthood, such as Cal&#x27;s experience in college as an intersex person as well as the relationships he had. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Lisa Zeidner opined that Eugenides purposefully devised this asymmetry. Stewart O&#x27;Nan of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; also felt that the brief description of Callie&#x27;s childhood was lacking; the book &quot;gloss[es] over&quot; how her mother did not recognize that Callie had male genitalia when she was washing or clothing Callie. Further, O&#x27;Nan characterized Cal&#x27;s relationship with the Japanese-American photographer Julie as &quot;underdeveloped&quot;, causing the reader not to experience its entirety. Michelle Vellucci of &quot;People&quot; had the same view about the novel&#x27;s end, writing that the conclusion felt &quot;rushed&quot;.

Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the novel a &quot;big-hearted, restless story&quot; and rated it an A minus. In &quot;Literary Review&quot;, Sam Leith called it &quot;a marvellous, quirky and moving entertainment&quot;. Lisa Zeidner of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; opined that &quot;Middlesex&quot; &quot;provides not only incest à la Ada and a Lolita-style road trip, but enough dense detail to keep fans of close reading manically busy.&quot; Tami Hoag of &quot;People&quot; concurred, writing that &quot;this feast of a novel is thrilling in the scope of its imagination and surprising in its tenderness&quot;. Andrew O&#x27;Hehir of &quot;Salon&quot; agreed, praising &quot;Middlesex&quot; as an &quot;epic and wondrous&quot; novel filled with numerous characters and historical occurrences. Mendelsohn praised &quot;Middlesex&quot; for its &quot;dense narrative, interwoven with sardonic, fashionably postmodern commentary.&quot; However, he criticized the novel as a disjointed hybrid. He wrote Eugenides was successful with the story of the Greek immigrants, which he described as &quot;authenti[c]&quot;, but mishandled the hermaphrodite material, which Mendelsohn characterized as &quot;unpersuasiv[e]&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; review stated that a more concise, concentrated depiction of hermaphroditism would have made the book more &quot;fun to read&quot;. Jeff Zaleski of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; praised Eugenides&#x27; portrayal of the girl, Callie, and the man Cal. Zaleski wrote that &quot;[i]t&#x27;s difficult to imagine any serious male writer of earlier eras so effortlessly transcending the stereotypes of gender.&quot; Paul Quinn of &quot;Contemporary Literary Criticism&quot; commended the novel, writing: &quot;That Eugenides manages to move us without sinking into sentiment shows how successfully he has avoided the tentacles of irony which grip so many writers of his generation.&quot; Christina McCarroll of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote that &quot;Eugenides wrangles with a destiny that mutates and recombines like restless chromosomes, in a novel of extraordinary flexibility, scope, and emotional depth.&quot;

Marta Salij of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; was impressed with the book&#x27;s depiction of Detroit, writing &quot;[a]t last Detroit has its novel. What Dublin got from James Joyce—a sprawling, ambitious, loving, exasperated and playful chronicle of all its good and bad parts—Detroit has from native son Eugenides in these 500 pages.&quot; David Kipen of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; agreed, opining &quot;[a]mong so many other things, this praiseworthy, prize-worthy yarn succeeds as a heartbroken mash note to the Detroit of Eugenides&#x27; birth, a city whose neighborhoods he sometimes appears to love—as he loves his characters—less for their virtues than for their defects. Any book that can make a reader actively want to visit Detroit must have one honey of a tiger in its tank.&quot;

Several critics have nominated the book for the title of &quot;Great American Novel&quot;. Tim Morris, a professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, wrote that the novel was &quot;the latest in a long line of contenders for the status of Great American Novel&quot;, and compared Cal to Huckleberry Finn, the narrator of &quot;Invisible Man&quot;, and J. Sutter in &quot;John Henry Days&quot;. Alexander Linklater of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; commented that American publishers chose &quot;Middlesex&quot; as the next Great American Novel to generate progress for American fiction and that Eugenides is considered the &quot;next stepping stone along from Jonathan Franzen&quot;. Dan Cryer of &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote that with the publication of &quot;Middlesex&quot;, &quot;[f]inally, Detroit has its very own great American novel&quot;.

David Gates of &quot;Newsweek&quot; contrasted Eugenides&#x27; debut novel &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; with &quot;Middlesex&quot;, writing that the first novel was &quot;ingenious&quot;, &quot;entertaining&quot;, and &quot;oddly moving&quot;, but that &quot;Middlesex&quot; is &quot;ingenious&quot;, &quot;entertaining&quot;, and &quot;ultimately not-so-moving&quot;. Despite this criticism, Gates considered &quot;Middlesex&quot; to be the novel where Eugenides &quot;finally plays his metafictional ace&quot;. Commenting that &quot;Middlesex&quot; is &quot;more discursive and funnier&quot; than &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;, Laura Miller of &quot;Salon&quot; wrote that the two novels deal with disunity. Max Watman of &quot;The New Criterion&quot; concurred, noting that &quot;Middlesex&quot; is &quot;funny, big, embracing, and wonderful&quot;, unlike Eugenides&#x27; first novel. Mark Lawson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised &quot;Middlesex&quot; for having the same unique qualities as &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;, commenting that &quot;Middlesex&quot; had &quot;an ability to describe the horrible in a comic voice, an unusual form of narration and an eye for bizarre detail.&quot; Lawson noted that whereas &quot;Middlesex&quot; deals with the &quot;links&quot; among gender, life, and genes, &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; deals with the &quot;connections&quot; between gender and death.

According to Olivia Banner of &quot;Signs&quot;, medical journals generally had positive reviews of the novel for its depiction of the inner lives of intersex people. Writing in &quot;Archives of Disease in Childhood&quot;, Simon Fountain-Polley praised the novel, writing: &quot;All clinicians, and families who have faced gender crises or difficult life-changing decision[s] on identity should read this book; delve into an emotional trip of discovery—where the slightest direction change could lead to myriad different lives.&quot; Abraham Bergman wrote in the &quot;Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine&quot;: &quot;Yes, it is fiction, but I cannot imagine a more authentic and sensitive voice. Because our interactions usually take place in limited and structured setting such as offices and hospitals, pediatricians have scant opportunity to learn how our young patients think. One way to sharpen our awareness is to listen to children&#x27;s voices as they are expressed in books. In &quot;Middlesex&quot;, the voice is loud and clear.&quot; Banner noted that most of the reviews in intersex and queer publications praised &quot;Middlesex&quot;. She posited that the problematic issues of a &quot;heteromasculine-identified narrator&quot; and the &quot;fact that it was authored by a heterosexual man&quot; may have been outweighed by the necessity for an appropriate reading that &quot;destigmatizes ambiguous sex&quot;.

Eugenides&#x27; third novel, &quot;The Marriage Plot&quot;, was published in 2011. Reviewer William Deresiewicz contrasted &quot;The Marriage Plot&quot; and &quot;Middlesex&quot;, writing that the former was &quot;far more intimate in tone and scale&quot;. &quot;The Marriage Plot&quot; follows two years in the lives of three characters, fourth-year Brown University students in 1982, whereas &quot;Middlesex&quot; follows the lives of three generations of characters. Deresiewicz preferred the 2011 novel, writing that &quot;[t]he books are far apart in quality&quot;. He criticized &quot;Middlesex&quot; for its &quot;[c]lanking prose, clunky exposition, transparent devices, telegraphed moves&quot;, &quot;a hash of narrative contrivances with very little on its mind.&quot; On a more positive note, Deresiewicz lauded Eugenides&#x27; colorful depiction of &quot;young love&quot; across his three novels. In &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;, Eugenides resplendently portrayed the intense fear during virginal sex, as well as Gabriel García Márquez, the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature laureate; in &quot;Middlesex&quot;, the single event in which the novel &quot;comes to life&quot; is Eugenides&#x27; depiction of Callie&#x27;s liaison with her adolescent lover; and in &quot;The Marriage Plot&quot;, the novel was exceptional in its &quot;sweet banter of courtship&quot; and the &quot;doormat nice-boy role&quot; the character Mitchell assumes in his interplay with his darling, Madeleine.

===Sales===
From the book&#x27;s publication until the early months of 2003, its sales were unsatisfactory, according to Bill Goldstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In the week following April 7, 2003, the day &quot;Middlesex&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize, the book sold 2,700 copies. The book later made the best-selling fiction list and kept its position for five weeks. In June 2007, the novel ranked seventh on &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Best-Selling Books list. In the same month, after Eugenides appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; to discuss the novel, &quot;Middlesex&quot; placed second on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-selling paperback fiction list. The Pulitzer award nearly propelled &quot;Middlesex&quot; to &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, which in 2003 published only the top 15 bestsellers; in the week after &quot;Middlesex&quot; was announced the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the novel placed 17th on the &quot;expanded list&quot;. In 2007, 1.3 million copies of the book had been sold. The same year, the book placed ninth on the &quot;Library Journal&quot; bestsellers list, which ranks &quot;the books most borrowed in U.S. libraries&quot;. Over three million copies of &quot;Middlesex&quot; had been sold by May 2011 and over four million by 2013.

<doc id="889075" wikidata="Q383947" url="?curid=889075" title="Argyreia nervosa">
<text>Argyreia nervosa is a perennial climbing vine native to the Indian subcontinent and introduced to numerous areas worldwide, including Hawaii, Africa, and the Caribbean. Though it can be invasive, it is often prized for its aesthetic and medicinal value. Common names include Hawaiian baby woodrose, adhoguda अधोगुडा or vidhara विधारा (Sanskrit), elephant creeper and woolly morning glory. Its seeds are known for their powerful entheogenic properties, greater or similar to those of Ipomoea species, with users reporting significant psychedelic and spiritual experiences. The two botanical varieties are &quot;Argyreia nervosa&quot; var. &quot;nervosa&quot; described here, and &quot;Argyreia nervosa&quot; var. &quot;speciosa&quot;, the roots of which are used in Ayurvedic medicine.

&quot;Argyreia nervosa&quot; contains various ergoline alkaloids such as ergine. A study reported stereoisomers of ergine to be found in the seeds at a concentration of 0.325% of dry weight. Two modern studies from a team of researchers also revealed lysergic acid, methylergometrine (&quot;syn&quot;. lysergic acid butanolamide), methysergide, lysergylalanine, and suspected, unidentifed ergopeptines. A study of the related &quot;Ipomoea tricolor&quot; showed that ergoline concentrations in the leaves are 12-fold lower than that of the seeds.

==History==
While seeds of other Convolvulaceae, specifically &quot;Ipomoea corymbosa&quot; (ololiuhqui) and &quot;Ipomoea tricolor&quot; (tlitliltzin), were used in shamanic rituals of Latin America for centuries, &quot;A. nervosa&quot; was not traditionally used for this purpose. Its properties were first brought to attention in the 1960s.

== Cultivation ==
Where temperatures fall below 13 °C (55 °F), &quot;Argyreia nervosa&quot; is grown in a warm greenhouse. Elsewhere, it is grown on arbours, pergolas, walls, or trees. It is often grown professionally under glass in a loam-based potting compost (John Innes No. 3) in full light, and watered freely from spring to autumn, with a balanced liquid fertilizer applied monthly and reduced water in winter. It is grown outdoors in moderately fertile, moist but well-drained soil in full sun. Pruning is done in late winter.

===Glycosides===

*Argyroside, (24&quot;R&quot;)-ergost-5-en-11-oxo-3β-ol-α--glucopyranoside, a steroidal glycoside unique to &quot;Argyreia nervosa&quot;
===Ergolines===

===Hydroxycinnamic acids===

===Fatty acids===


==Entheogen==

Certain New Age sources claim that, according to &#x27;various oral histories&#x27; Huna shamans used the powdered seeds to prepare an entheogenic drink. This is unlikely to reflect an authentic practice having once formed a part of traditional Hawaiian Religion, given that &quot;Huna&quot; has been widely discredited as a culturally appropriative New Age religion invented by Max Freedom Long. The seeds of &quot;Argyreia nervosa&quot; can produce psychoactive effects, but it has not yet been demonstrated satisfactorily that their use as an entheogen predates the various countercultural movements of the 1960s.
Given that &quot;A. nervosa&quot; is not native to Hawaii, having been introduced there from India, any Hawaiian practices involving it are unlikely to be of any antiquity. It cannot, however, be ruled out that the plant may have been utilised as an intoxicant in its native India at some time in the past, although evidence for this (if present) has not yet come to light.
The seeds of &quot;A. nervosa&quot; contain ergot alkaloids varying considerably in concentration with LSA weight ranging between exactly similar looking seeds from 3 μg to 34 μg (avg 17 μg). However, in its effects, LSA is about one tenth as potent as its cousin LSD, making a threshold dose level for LSA (D-Lysergic Acid Amide) about 500 μg. The psychoactive effects of the seeds may therefore be due to other alkaloids present in them and the safe and effective dose may be difficult to predict.

==Uses in the traditional medicine of India==
While he does not claim there to be any evidence for the use of the seeds of &quot;A. nervosa&quot; as a traditional entheogen in its native India, Christian Rätsch does describe some interesting traditional uses of the root of the plant in Ayurveda somewhat suggestive of effects upon the CNS:

The root is regarded as a tonic for the nerves and brain and is ingested as a rejuvenation tonic and aphrodisiac to increase intelligence. 
Other traditional uses are in the treatment of gonorrhea, strangury, chronic ulcers, diabetes, anemia, and cerebral disorders. The plant is also used as appetizer, brain tonic, cardiotonic, and aphrodisiac. It possesses anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activities

<text>The HP 3000 series is a family of 16-bit and 32-bit minicomputers from Hewlett-Packard. It was designed to be the first minicomputer with full support for time-sharing in the hardware and the operating system, features that had mostly been limited to mainframes, or retrofitted to existing systems like Digital&#x27;s PDP-11, on which Unix was implemented. First introduced in 1972, the last models reached end-of-life in 2010, making it among the longest-lived machines of its generation.

The original HP 3000 hardware was withdrawn from the market in 1973 to address performance problems and OS stability. After reintroduction in 1974, it went on to become a reliable and powerful business system, one that regularly won HP business from companies that had been using IBM&#x27;s mainframes. Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s initial naming referred to the computer as the System/3000, and then called it the HP 3000.

The HP 3000 originally used a 16-bit CISC stack machine processor architecture, first implemented with Transistor-transistor logic, and later with Silicon on Sapphire chips beginning with the Series 33 in 1979. In the early 1980s, HP began development of a new RISC processor, which emerged as the PA-RISC platform. The HP 3000 CPU was reimplemented as an emulator running on PA-RISC and a recompiled version of the MPE operating system. The RISC-based systems were known as the &quot;XL&quot; versions, while the earlier CISC models retroactively became the &quot;Classic&quot; series. The two sold in tandem for a short period, but the XL series largely took over in 1988. Identical machines running HP-UX instead of MPE XL were known as the HP 9000.

HP later renamed the computer the HP e3000 to emphasize the system&#x27;s compatibility with internet and web uses. HP initially announced the systems would be designated to be at end-of-life at HP in 2006, but extended that several times to 2010. The systems are no longer built or supported by the manufacturer, although independent companies support the systems.

==History==
===HP 2000===
While looking for a computer system to control ever-more-complex test equipment, HP briefly considered buying Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). They were ultimately unimpressed with Ken Olsen&#x27;s demands and did not attempt a deal. They later found a small company, DSI, working for Union Carbide, that had essentially &quot;stretched&quot; DEC&#x27;s PDP-8 from 12 to 16-bits. HP purchased DSI and merged it into its Dymec division. The DSI design became the basis for the HP 2116A, introduced in 1966, initially marketed as a &quot;test and instrumentation computer&quot;.

To their surprise, HP found that the machine was selling well in the business market and other non-lab uses. This led to a series of updated versions with better input/output to handle business workflows while removing some of the expansion capability needed only in the lab setting. The much smaller 2114 was particularly popular in non-lab settings. All of the 211x models were later updated to use semiconductor memory instead of core memory, leading to the 2100 family of 1971.

In 1968, the line was expanded with the HP 2000, a series of machines that were made up of collections of parts from the HP 211x lines, with most systems using a low-end 2114 CPU as a terminal controller and high-end CPU like the 2116 as the main processor. The systems ran HP Time-Shared BASIC and could support between 16 and 32 users simultaneously depending on the model. The machines were an immediate success, quickly becoming one of the best-selling systems in the timesharing market, and propelling HP to become the 3rd largest minicomputer vendor.

===Alpha and Omega===
As the success of the HP 2000 series became clear, in 1969 the designers in Cupertino Lab decided to begin the development of machines dedicated to the office role, as opposed to the HP 2000, which was made up of various bits and pieces never originally designed for the task. Two basic systems were outlined, the &quot;Alpha&quot; was essentially an HP 2100 built using newer components and improved memory handling, while &quot;Omega&quot; was a much larger 32-bit design that would support large numbers of users.

Initially, the two systems were to be released at about the same time. However, almost all development took place within Omega, and few, if any, engineers were active on Alpha during 1969. In contrast to the 16-bit Alpha, Omega would be a 32-bit computer with up to 4 MB of main memory shared among up to four central processing units (CPUs). The CPUs were designed to be programmed in a high level language, like the successful models from Burroughs that were programmed in a custom systems programming language rather than assembler. Support for multiprogramming and memory protection would be built in.

As development continued, the project appeared to be too large for HP to complete using internal funding. This would require the company to take on external debt, which management considered too risky. In the fall of 1970, Tom Perkins was promoted to Corporate Development and decided to cancel the Omega project. This resulted in several employees wearing black-velvet armbands to mourn the death of the project, and some dismay over being reassigned to &quot;just another 16-bit machine.&quot;

By this time the small amount of development on Alpha had changed the nature of the project significantly. Originally conceived as an updated HP 2100, it had become essentially a small Omega, adopting its virtual memory and stack machine design that supported high level languages, but limited to a 16-bit design with a maximum of 64 kWord main memory (128 kB), only a single accumulator, and lacking Omega&#x27;s powerful input/output systems.

When the plan to continue the development of Alpha was presented, George Newman, who replaced Perkins as the General Manager of the computer division, was concerned that the team was once again designing a machine that could not be delivered. Management was eventually convinced of the merits of the design, and the External Reference Specifications were published in July 1970.

===MPE===
Prior minicomputers were generally used in a fashion similar to modern microcomputers, used by a single user, and often dedicated to a single particular task like operating machinery. This was true for many contemporary designs like the PDP-8 and Data General Nova. It was the HP 2000&#x27;s ability to perform timesharing that made it a success in a market filled with otherwise similar machines. The ability to support multiple users running different programs was previously limited to mainframe computers, and a further expansion of this capability was a key design concept for the original Omega.

When Alpha emerged as an Omega-like design, it initially followed the same model of multi-user support, which was in turn based on the HP 2000 concept. In this model, the main CPU does not handle user interaction, which is the task of the front-end processor. This allows the main operating system to be greatly simplified, simply loading up user programs as they appear from the front-end, running them in a round-robin fashion with other users&#x27; programs, and then delivering the results. In most respects this was a batch processing system, with much of the complexity of multi-user support being isolated in the separate front-end processor.

As development re-started on Alpha, this concept was re-examined and the decision was made to expand the operating system to support multiprogramming directly. This resulted in the system becoming three-in-one, with the main portion being dedicated to timesharing but also offering real-time support and batch mode. The resulting system, ultimately known as Multi-Programming Executive (MPE), would be among the most advanced of its era. When the ten groups within the operating system team came together to describe their section of the system, they found that it was too large to fit in memory, let alone have room for user programs. To make it fit, the programmers began a marathon effort to shrink the system requirements.

===Announcement and initial marketing===
The system was announced at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in November 1971. By early 1972 the system was up and running with three prototype machines completed. However, MPE development was by this time far behind schedule. This led to a February 1972 memo outlining the development schedule with various features being delivered over time. Ultimately the realtime support was dropped, and none of the dates on the memo were met.

Meanwhile, a turf war had broken out between the engineering lab and the marketing department, who were actively trying to sell the system. It got to the point where &quot;People from marketing were banned from the lab.&quot; Engineers continued to provide performance estimates to marketing, which would pass these along to customers, even though the engineers were aware they were inaccurate.

Increasing concern among upper management led to the May 1972 formation of the Systems Management Group, who would work within the engineering labs as an internal marketing team and drive the development according to customer needs. Among the changes implemented, Jim Peachy was hired to do performance testing on the system. Peachy had previously worked on the first timesharing systems at Dartmouth College, and had since worked at General Electric and Memorex. After only three days he pronounced that there was &quot;absolutely no way&quot; the machine would meet the performance requirements being quoted by sales.

===First deliveries, recall===
As a result of the MPE delays, the ship date was pushed back from August to November 1972, and MPE was reduced solely to timesharing support, with additional features slated to arrive through 1973.

The November date was held firm, and eventually, someone put up posters claiming &quot;November is a happening&quot;, referring to the contemporary &quot;happening&quot; movement in performance art. The first machine was shipped to the Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley on November 1, although as one engineer, Frank Hublou, noted, &quot;they should have put it on the truck, drove it around the block, and brought the machine back.&quot;

After setup, it was found the machine would only support one or two users before slowing to a crawl, and it crashed every 10 to 20 minutes. Hublou&#x27;s statement came true when the machine was &quot;immediately returned.&quot; In a training session that December, a new version of MPE was able to run four users and crashed only once every two hours. The system was continually patched to keep it running as new bugs were found. Machines continued to be shipped, both to customers as well as companies that were considering purchases. These invariably ended poorly, unable to support more than four users. The schedule for MPE features continued to be pushed back, and the estimated number of machine sales continued to be reduced.

By this time, the development of an HP 2000 replacement had been underway for 5 years and had cost the company $20 million. The problems were not going unnoticed and ultimately ended up with Bill Hewlett. Hewlett asked Barney Oliver to take over the division, but he refused, and Paul Ely was sent instead in his place. Ely quickly ended production of the machines and, in a move still mentioned in historical works to this day, recalled all of the machines that had been shipped out. Dave Packard sent a memo to everyone on the team, today known simply as the &quot;Wow Ouch memo&quot;.

Ed McCracken went back to the customers and told them point-blank that the machines would not be available until the fall of 1973, and that the machines would only support four to six users. Some accepted the offer of an HP 2000 in place of their orders, while others broke down and cried. One customer threatened to sue the company, but were put off by the personal intervention of Hewlett who stated he would do everything in his power to fix the problems.

===Re-release===
The system then entered a six-month period of redevelopment of both MPE and the hardware. MPE emerged as MPE-8, officially ending real-time support. The hardware improved to run about 30% faster than the original model and was priced 20% less. As a result of these changes, the new system was able to run eight users. Shipping re-started in November, a year after the original date.

After another year, an updated version shipped. This new &quot;CX&quot; model replaced core memory with semiconductor memory and replaced the wire wrapped CPU boards with surface mounted components. MPE-C added COBOL and RPG languages, perhaps the first mini to offer the former. As part of the CX release, HP shipped IMAGE, a $10,000 database system written to the CODASYL standards. This was later bundled with the systems for free. IMAGE is the primary reason the HP 3000 eventually became a success.

==Overview==
Early 3000 models had large cabinets with front panels, while later models were made that fit into desks using only terminal consoles for diagnostics, with bootstrap routines in ROM. By 1984 HP introduced the HP3000 Series 37, the first model that ran in offices without special cooling or flooring requirements. Models ranged from a system sometimes used by a single user, to models that supported over 2,000 users.

The HP 3000 was one of the last proprietary minicomputer systems whose manufacture was curtailed by its vendor, outlasting the PDP-11-descended Digital Equipment Corporation VAX, which was acquired by Compaq and then ultimately by Hewlett-Packard. After almost 30 years, a five-year phase-out period for the now-named HP e3000 series servers was originally announced in November 2001. HP then extended this phase-out period twice. No more new e3000s are being sold by HP, although used systems continue to be sold for upgrades on a third-party reseller market. Support from HP to customers for the HP 3000 continued through December 31, 2010. Many third party firms continue to support the system for customers throughout the world. Some customers continue to use the HP 3000 in companies worldwide, especially in manufacturing and e-commerce industries, while others have migrated to business server systems made by HP and others.

For those unable or unwilling to migrate, a homesteading strategy emerged immediately after HP&#x27;s announcement of the end of system sales. In 2012, the Stromasys company released a product doing full HP3000 hardware emulation on x86-64 servers running Red Hat Linux or CentOS. That product operates as a virtualized instance of the HP 3000 server hardware. Starting in 2003, HP began a plan to sell a license for the 3000&#x27;s operating system, which can let 3000 customers run their software on this Stromasys product, known as the HPA/3000.

== Software pioneering ==

The key development that led to the tremendous success of the HP 3000 was the bundling of the HP-developed network database management system (DBMS) called IMAGE (now called TurboIMAGE/SQL) that was reputedly inspired by the TOTAL DBMS developed by Cincom Systems, Inc. IMAGE was an award-winning database anointed by &quot;Datamation&quot; within two years of the database&#x27;s introduction. It was the first database management system included with a business-class minicomputer. By bundling IMAGE with the server, HP created an ecosystem of applications and development utilities that could rely upon IMAGE as a data repository in any HP 3000.

== Classic memory segments and 64K barrier ==

Code (reentrant) and data reside in separate variable-length segments, which are 32,768 &quot;halfwords&quot; (16-bit words) (or, 65,536 bytes). The operating system, known as MPE (for Multi-Programming Executive), loads code segments from program files and segmented Library (SL) files as needed, up to 256 segments in one process.

There could be as much as 64KB of memory in a code segment, but calling a routine was based on segment number and routine number within a segment, so a program could theoretically have about 32,385 routines. With 8 bits to specify segment, and 16 bits within a segment a program could have effectively have a 24 bit address or 16MB. This was compared to most 16 bit computers like the PDP-11 or IBM System/34 that had 64KB of address space for code and data. The bigger limitation was the data segment and stack segment, which were also 64KB. Shared library routines did not permit cross-process global data since each process had its own data segment. Some procedures worked around this by requiring the caller to pass in an array from their own stack or data segment to hold all state information, similar to modern object-oriented languages where methods are applied to objects passed and allocated by the caller.

A process could allocate and use multiple extra data segments (XDS) of up to 64KB each. While the Classic architecture imposed a limit of 65,535 extra data segments system-wide, other limitations would usually restrict that to a somewhat smaller limit.

Systems programming was done in SPL (System Programming Language), an ALGOL-like language, but allowing inline assembler, and other direct access to the instruction set. The standard terminals for the HP 3000 were the HP 2640 series, which supported block mode data entry from forms (like IBM&#x27;s mainframe-based CICS), as well as character mode. By the 1980s the computer had gained the ability to use both PCs and Macs as system terminals.

== Classic and PA-RISC 3000 hardware ==

The HP 3000 family&#x27;s generations were divided into the &quot;Classic&quot; (16-bit) and then &quot;XL&quot; (later IX – 32-bit) families following the introduction of systems based on HP&#x27;s PA-RISC chips for 3000s in early 1987. These newer XL systems were not binary compatible with the Classics, but would transparently run Classic code via an emulator, one that HP integrated into the MPE XL operating system. (Classic code could optionally be translated to native PA-RISC code via OCTCOMP, the Object Code Translator/COMPiler ... such code ran at native speed, but was still subject to Classic stack and memory size limitations).

The earlier &quot;Classic&quot; machines were based on a custom CISC processor. From about 1988 onward, HP 3000s using PA-RISC processors began shipping in volume. By 1995 these PA-RISC systems effectively displaced the older family of machines from use. As with all technology shifts, there remained a significant residue of older machines in service. Even today, original Classic 3000s work in production in a few locations.

HP 3000 and many HP 9000 machines used the HP Precision Bus.

The PA-RISC based HP 3000&#x27;s operating system was written primarily in Modcal, HP&#x27;s extended version of Pascal. Large portions of the earlier MPE V operating system, written in SPL, are still used as part of MPE XL and MPE/iX on PA-RISC. A few subsystems (e.g., TurboIMAGE) are written in PSPL (Portable SPL). A small portion of MPE XL and MPE/iX is written in PA-RISC assembly language.

The 3000 series operating system was originally styled the Multi-Programming Executive, MPE (later called MPE XL and then, after POSIX compliance was added in versions 5.0-5.5, MPE/iX). The earliest versions of the system used only HP&#x27;s proprietary SPL systems programming language and BASIC. These System 3000s used a command-line interpreter, with a three-level hierarchical file system, and utilities such as compilers would resemble &quot;run fortran.pub.sys&quot; rather than allowing programs to be run as keyword commands. Later the systems gained a wide range of languages including COBOL and FORTRAN, Pascal, C, and even a version of RPG to assist in winning business away from IBM.

People who used the HP 3000 noticed from the 1970s onward that machines were more reliable compared to other mainframe and minicomputers of the time. The ability to recover from power failures - automatically and seamlessly when power was restored - was a notable feature that sold many systems versus IBM computers. At times the HP 3000 suffered from peripheral support delays or gaps caused by HP&#x27;s decision to delay supporting, or not support at all, some peripherals on the HP 3000 platform—some of which were supported on the identical HP 9000 hardware.

== Use of stack instead of registers ==

Most current computer instruction sets are based on a general-purpose register model. The processor and memory architecture of the classic HP 3000 were based on a stack machine model, like HP&#x27;s well-known line of RPN calculators. It was said to be inspired by the famous stack-based Burroughs large systems. Rather than having a small number of registers, for example only an AX and BX register in the case of the HP 1000, operands would be pushed on the same stack used to store local variables and return addresses. So rather than
LOAD AX, 0X0001
LOAD BX, 0X0002
ADD AX, BX
you would have
LDI 1
LDI 2
ADD
The 16-bit microcoded machines (Series I, II, III, 30, 33, 39, 40, 42, 44, 48, 52, 58, 64, 68, 70, 37, ...) implement a 16-bit word addressed, byte-addressable, segmented, Harvard, Stack Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). Most of the ~214 instructions are 16 bits wide. Stack operations pack 2 per 16-bit word and the remaining few are 32 bits wide.

== HP&#x27;s exit from the 3000 ecosystem ==

After the enterprise computing market shifted toward commodity Unix systems from a wide range of vendors—systems that HP had also been promoting—in November 2001 Hewlett-Packard announced that a period it called the end-of-life for the HP 3000 would wrap up at the end of 2006, and that no new systems would be sold by HP after 2003. In early 2006, Hewlett-Packard announced that limited vendor support for the HP 3000 would be extended by two years for certain clients or geographic regions. In September 2007, HP once more extended its support for the systems, offering Mature Product Support without Sustaining Engineering (ending its creation of software patches). Some patches had been built and tested inside HP, but lacked customer base testing by the end of 2008. HP made these patches available after the end of 2010. By 2011, HP had extended a special provision to 3000 customers that granted them free access to patches, unlike the rest of HP enterprise line, which was forced in 2010 to adopt a &quot;pay for patching&quot; support program instead of free patches.

== Independent support ==

A group of independent vendors has assumed systems and software support for existing customers who have left the ranks of HP&#x27;s 3000 support business. Several have pledged to continue support for their own software until customers stop using the server. Others, offering comprehensive support, are citing 2016 and later as their end of support dates. A consultants directory is maintained by Robelle Software, and other independent consultants are available through a listing at the OpenMPE website. Open source software resources, including commodity tools, for the 3000&#x27;s MPE/iX operating system are maintained in a website by Applied Technologies.

The HP 3000 has enjoyed one of the longest lifetimes for any business computer system. These enterprise-grade computers have outlasted the highly regarded PDP-11 and VAX series, although OpenVMS operating system is still being offered on Alpha, IA-64, and x86-64 based systems.

In January 2012, Stromasys announced the development of Charon/HPA-3000, which enables secure transfer of HP3000 systems to a state-of-the-art environment. Stromasys&#x27;s solution virtualizes the hardware of an existing HP3000 system, and enables the MPE/iX operating system, third-party applications, and user-developed software to run without any modification whatsoever, on industry-standard Intel servers. Their offering includes a two-user evaluation copy delivered in a VMWare package.

Multiple independent vendors have purchased HP3000&#x27;s Operating System Source Code, MPE/iX and are committed to supporting both hardware and software solutions for HP3000 systems.

Beechglen Development, Inc. began hosting HP3000 systems in 2002. In 2012 Beechglen introduced HP3000 compatible custom fibre channel disc arrays using current technology SSD and SATA hard drives, effectively replacing SCSI tape and SCSI disc devices. As of January 2020, Beechglen is the only vendor that has developed and offers 2028 MPE CALENDAR intrinsic patches for the MPE/iX Operating system allowing intrinsic dates beyond December 31, 2027. They continue evaluating and testing third-party applications for compatibility.

<text>Massurrealism is a portmanteau word coined in 1992 by American artist James Seehafer, who described a trend among some postmodern artists that mix the aesthetic styles and themes of surrealism and mass media—including pop art.

==History==

Massurrealism is a development of surrealism that emphasizes the effect of technology and mass media on contemporary surrealist imagery. James Seehafer who is credited with coining the term in 1992 said that he was prompted to do so because there was no extant definition to accurately characterize the type of work he was doing, which combined elements of surrealism and mass media, the latter consisting of technology and pop art—&quot;a form of technology art.&quot; He had begun his work by using a shopping cart, and then incorporating collages of colour photocopies and spray paint with the artist&#x27;s traditional medium of oil paint.

In 1995, he assembled a small group show near New York City and found a local cyber-cafe, where he started to post material about massurrealism on internet arts news groups, inspiring some German art students to stage a massurrealist show. The next year he started his own web site, www.massurrealism.com and began to receive work from other artists, both mixed media and digitally-generated. He credits the World Wide Web with a major role in communicating massurrealism, which spread interest from artists in Europe and in Latin America Seehafer has stated:
The differentiating factor, according to Seehafer, between surrealism and massurrealism is the foundation of the former in the early 20th century in Europe before the spread of electronic mass media. A common characteristic is the use of modern technology to fuse surrealism&#x27;s traditional access to the unconscious with pop art&#x27;s ironic contradictions.

In 2005, graffiti artist Banksy illicitly hung a rock in the British Museum showing a caveman pushing a shopping cart, which was described as &quot;a nice tribute to James Seehafer and Massurrealism.&quot;

==Artists==
British artist Alan King started to experiment with a combination of digital and traditional art methods in the 1990s, producing a majority of his works with photography and using computer techniques combining digital images with a multitude of traditional methods including oils, ink, acrylic, and watercolour.

Nationally renowned photographer Chip Simons incorporates both his photo images with digital collage.

German artist Melanie Marie Kreuzhof, who describes her work as massurrealistic, was commissioned in 2004 by the editor of the &quot;Spectakel Salzburger Festsiele Inside&quot; magazine to produce an artwork about Erich Wolfgang Korngold&#x27;s opera Die tote Stadt at the Salzburg Festival. To make her work she took 9 digital photographs, composed them in a computer and printed the result directly onto canvas, which was then attached to a wooden frame, worked on with acrylic paint and had objects attached—3 guitar strings, a strand of hair and a silk scarf. The images and elements were derived from themes in the opera. 

Other artists include Cecil Touchon who works with sound collage &amp; poetry, and conceptual artist / film set designer Jean Pierre Trevor describes his &#x27;massurreal approach&#x27; to his multi-media work. 

American Southern artist John R. Adams / Johnny Ramage&#x27;s work consists of digital media, photography, and random Google images chosen through an automatic style and rendered in unsophisticated photo editing software. Ramage&#x27;s work often focuses on ominous, absurd images inspired by frightening childhood events all depicted in style that suggests a low-fi, or 8-bit and contemporary aesthetic.

==In Popular Culture==

Hyperreality // Massurrealism is a New England IPA beer sold by Houglass Brewing Company produced out of Longwood Florida. 

In the 2013 indie movie &quot;45 RPM&quot; the main protagonist, Charlie, is applying for an artist grant, she describes her work as massurrealism.

<doc id="889108" wikidata="Q7981391" url="?curid=889108" title="Wellington East Girls' College">
<text>Wellington East Girls&#x27; College (WEGC, Maori name: Te Kura Kōhine o te Rāwhiti o Te Upoko o Te Ika) is a state single-sex girls&#x27; secondary school which sits directly above Mount Victoria Tunnel, Wellington, New Zealand. Serving Years 9 to 13 (ages 12 to 18), the school currently has students.

The College primarily serves families of the eastern and southern suburbs and inner-city Wellington. However, it also has students from all over Wellington, the Hutt Valley and Porirua City, out of zone students being accepted in on a ballot. The school has a Special Needs Unit for about 20 students, some of whom are integrated into the school system.

==School leadership==
The school&#x27;s long time principal Janice Campbell retired during 2007 and Sally Haughton took up the position. In 2019 Gael Ashworth became principal.

Currently, the Senior Leadership Team consists of the principal herself and three deputy principals. There is also a principal&#x27;s nominee – a staff member nominated by the principal who has responsibility for maintaining quality within the School to ensure the validity and credibility of assessment for qualifications according to the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA).
The school has a Guidance team (composed of one international and five year-level deans, careers advisors, counsellors, and a Guidance Leader) as well as a sports director and many department heads.

==History==
Wellington East Girls&#x27; College was built on reserve land bordering Wellington College in 1925, to cope with the demand for female education in Wellington at the time. By the end of the First World War, there were over 800 pupils at Wellington Girls’ High School (now Wellington Girls&#x27; College) in Thorndon, and teaching became severely hampered by the overcrowding – so much so that rooms in nearby houses were rented out to use as classrooms. Miss A. M. Batham, who had served on the staff at Wellington Girls&#x27; for 22 years and would be the first Headmistress of Wellington East, petitioned the Board of Governors repeatedly until it was agreed that a new school would be founded on the other side of the city. The school was originally named Mt Victoria Girls College but was changed to avoid confusion with Victoria University of Wellington, which was called Victoria University College at the time.

The school celebrates Founders Day annually on 15 September and held a 90th reunion on the date in 2015.

On 24 September 2024, the school was evacuated after receiving an email threat.

==Houses==
In 1931, Headmistress Batham divided the school into six houses for sports competitions. These six houses were named Islington, Ranfurly, Onslow, Jellicoe, Fergusson, and Bledisloe, and were named after: 
*The Lord Islington, the 15th Governor of New Zealand.
*Lieutenant-General The Lord Freyberg, the seventh Governor-General of New Zealand.
*William Onslow, 4th Earl of Onslow, the 11th Governor.
*John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe, the second Governor-General.
*Sir Charles Fergusson, 7th Baronet, the third Governor-General.
*Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe, the fourth Governor-General.

Sometime before 1950 both the Ranfurly and Freyberg Houses were renamed. They became Cobham and Freyberg, in honour of The Viscount Cobham (the ninth Governor-General) and Lieutenant-General The Lord Freyberg (the seventh Governor-General). In 1941 Freyberg and Cobham were dismantled and students in either became parts of the other four houses.

The four current houses at Wellington East Girls&#x27; College are:
* Sheppard 
* Edgar
* Cooper 
* Tirikatane

==Buildings and grounds==

Wellington East Girls&#x27; College shares with Wellington College the administration of the Gifford Observatory.

The architecture of the original building is &quot;interwar stripped classical&quot;. The grand main building is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category 1 Historic Place.

In 2011, earthquake strengthening work was begun on the building, but was halted when engineers found it to meet just 17% of the national building standard (the minimum for existing buildings is 34%). The building, which was built in 1924, was empty until late 2014, when work restarted with the aim of replacing the building. The redevelopment project was to keep the façade of the old heritage building while a new multi-storey block was built behind it.

The old block held nine classrooms (not including the music department) which held 250 pupils, as well as the library, staffroom and offices.

After the closure of the Main Block, areas previously housed inside the building were forced to relocate. The Mathematics department, along with the School Office, Student Services Centre, Hauora Centre, and the Senior Management offices were all relocated to &quot;The Village&quot;; a set of pre-fabricated buildings on the old lower netball courts. When the new building opened the prefabs were removed and this area became a car park. The music department was located in a portion of the Main Block still usable until its demolition in 2014; it then moved to pre-fabricated buildings located on the top field. It is soon to be joined by another set of pre-fabricated buildings, which will house the Art Department until completion of renovation on the South Wing (built in 1966).

Most buildings on the school site are being redeveloped in some way or another. In 2016, the Sports Centre saw strengthening and repainting. The baths, which since construction in 1958 have already witnessed the removal of the diving pool (replaced by the Special Needs Unit), have undergone total reconstruction. The outdoor swimming pool has been covered over. Seemingly, the only buildings on site left untouched by the redevelopment will be the East Wing (built 1956) and the Science Block (Opened 1985).

In April 2019 the new Matairangi block opened, providing open-plan learning spaces, a new library, canteen, art studios, food technology rooms, music facilities and a media suite, along with a Maori learning space or Wharenui. The school, with this new building, is now able to cater to approximately 1250 students.

==He Huarahi Tamariki==
He Huarahi Tamariki is a teen parent unit under the jurisdiction of Wellington East Girls&#x27; College. It serves approximately 50 teenage parents in Years 9–15 (age 12–19) in continuing secondary school education. The unit is largely autonomous and is located in Porirua, and incorporates the Griffin 2 School, an Early Childhood Centre that caters for the children of its students. It is noted that the Teen Parent Unit roll is returned with the one belonging to Wellington East Girls&#x27; College.

<doc id="889116" wikidata="Q1206519" url="?curid=889116" title="Katamari Damacy">
<text>() is a 2004 puzzle-action video game by Namco for the PlayStation 2. Designer Keita Takahashi struggled to pitch the game to Namco&#x27;s superiors, eventually seeking student aid from the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory to develop the project for less than 1 million. As director, Takahashi emphasized concepts of novelty, ease of understanding, and enjoyment.

The game&#x27;s plot concerns a diminutive prince on a mission to rebuild stars, constellations, and the Moon, which were inadvertently destroyed by his father, the King of All Cosmos. This is achieved by rolling a magical, highly adhesive ball called a &quot;katamari&quot; around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to human beings to mountains, until the ball has grown large enough to become a star. &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot;″s story, settings and characters are highly stylized and surreal, often both celebrating and satirizing facets of Japanese culture.

&quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; received positive reception, becoming a surprise hit and winning several awards. Its success led to the creation of the greater &quot;Katamari&quot; franchise, and inspired numerous subsequent games imitating its quirky, colorful charm. Some critics have hailed it as a cult classic and one of the greatest video games of all time, praising its gameplay, replay value, humor, originality, and Shibuya-kei soundtrack. A high-definition remaster of the game, was released on Windows and Nintendo Switch in December 2018, on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2020, and on Google Stadia in September 2021.

==Synopsis==
In a drunken stupor, an eccentric, god-like entity called the King of All Cosmos destroys all the stars, Earth&#x27;s Moon and other such celestial bodies in the universe, save for Earth itself. Despite acknowledging his mistake, the King charges his five-centimeter-tall son, the Prince, to go to Earth with a &quot;katamari&quot;—a magical ball that allows anything smaller than it to stick to it and make it grow—and collect enough material for him to recreate the stars and the Moon. The Prince is successful, and the universe is returned to normal.

A side-story follows the Hoshino family as the Prince works at his tasks. The father, an astronaut, is unable to go to the Moon after it is wiped out by the King, and the daughter, whose name is Michiru, &quot;senses&quot; the Prince&#x27;s work—she can feel when each constellation returns to the sky. Ultimately, the family, along with their house and town, are rolled up in the katamari that is used to remake the Moon.

==Gameplay==

The player controls the Prince as he rolls the katamari around houses, gardens, and towns in order to meet certain parameters set by the King of All Cosmos. The player uses the two analog sticks on the DualShock controller in a manner similar to the classic arcade game &quot;Battlezone&quot; to control the direction the katamari rolls. Other controls can be triggered by the player to gain a quick burst of speed, flip the Prince to the other side of the katamari and more.

Objects that are smaller than the katamari will stick to it when the player comes into contact with them, while greater objects can be hurdles; colliding at high speed with any may cause objects to fall off the katamari, slowing the player&#x27;s progress. The game uses size, weight, and surface area to determine if an object will stick to the katamari. This allows slender objects, such as pencils, that are longer than the katamari is wide, to be picked up, and these will alter how the katamari rolls until more objects are picked up. Animals such as cats will chase the katamari, knocking things from it, but once the katamari is great enough, it will scare the animals away, and they can be rolled up once they are chased down. As objects stick to the katamari, the katamari will grow, eventually allowing objects that were once hurdles to be picked up, and creating access to areas that were formerly blocked. In this manner, the player might start the game by picking up thumbtacks and ants, and slowly work up to the point where the katamari is picking up buildings, mountains, and clouds.

The typical mission given by the King of All Cosmos is the &quot;Make a Star&quot; mode, where the player needs to grow the katamari to a specific size within a given time frame. Other missions have more specific collecting rules, such as collecting as many items (swans, crabs, pairs) as possible within a given time, or collecting the largest item possible (such as a cow or bear). The player can attempt a score attack mode for any level, where the goal is to make the largest katamari possible in the time allotted. Certain levels can unlock an &quot;eternal mode&quot; by creating an exceptionally large katamari. In eternal modes, the player can explore the level with no time limit.

Each level features two secret items that can be found. The first item is a &quot;royal present&quot; that contains an object that the Prince can wear. Most gifts are non-functional, but one includes a camera that can be used to take in-game screenshots. In the two-player mode, a player can choose to play as either the Prince or one of his numerous Cousins. The screen is split vertically; player one on the left and player two on the right. Players compete simultaneously in a small arena to collect the most objects within three minutes. The playing field is replenished with new objects periodically. Players can ram into each other, knocking items from their opponents&#x27; katamaris, and if one player leads by a fair amount, then it is possible to roll up the opponent&#x27;s katamari.

==Development==

Keita Takahashi entered the Musashino Art University to study sculpting in 1995. During his studies, he came to a philosophy that his art needed to combine practical elements along with a bit of whimsy and humor. After graduation, Takahashi no longer had the desire to pursue sculpting as a full-time career, and saw the potential to become involved in video games as a means to continue his art interest in a larger medium. Joining Namco as an artist around 1999, Takahashi worked on a number of smaller projects for the publisher. One of these was called &quot;Action Drive&quot;, inspired by &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; but with more spy-based elements atop the driving gameplay. During this, Takahashi came up with the ideas of the characters that would be central to &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot;: the King, the Queen, and the Prince of all Cosmos. His idea would have been that the queen had been kidnapped by agents on Earth, and the lazy King sends the Prince to rescue her. To do this, the player would use the diminutive Prince&#x27;s head, shaped like a hammer, to stun humans, after which the Prince would then &quot;drive&quot; the humans around by putting a steering wheel on the back of the human&#x27;s head. Takahashi felt this would lead to interesting and creative gameplay, allowing the player to create havoc as the Prince followed the misguided suggestions from the King, but the project leader rejected the idea. &quot;Action Drive&quot; was eventually cancelled.

While working on other projects, Takahashi continued to try to think of game ideas, seeking to grow beyond being just an artist for Namco. Takahashi cited two concepts that led to the inspiration of &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot;. The first was a prototype shown by Sony Computer Entertainment called &quot;Densen&quot; (Japanese for &quot;power line&quot;) that had the player as a young girl traverse floating islands of various homes connected by power lines. The game, though never released, gave Takahashi the idea that the ordinary world could be made interesting with only small changes to perception, and that a game could be fun without the need to cause violence. The second idea was from the game of &quot;tamakorogashi&quot; played in Japanese school&#x27;s &quot;undōkai&quot; or sports days. In &quot;tamakorogashi&quot;, students attempt to push a giant ball into a goal. Both those ideas led to him thinking of a game where spinning a ball would roll ordinary objects into it, making the ball larger and larger over time. The evening he conceived of this idea, he spoke to a friend, one of the game designers in Namco, to see if it made for a good game idea, who agreed it had potential. The next day, he spoke to his former boss, Mitsutoshi Ozaki, about the concept, further adding a way to reuse the King and Prince characters he had previously proposed, who also agreed it would make for a great game.

As Takahashi was in Namco&#x27;s art department and not in game design, there was no easy route for him to propose this idea to Namco&#x27;s superiors. Ozaki suggested a novel approach for Takahashi through the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory. At the time, Namco had been following in the model that Konami had used in 1997: Konami established the Konami Computer Entertainment School to help educate new game developers which were eventually hired in Konami, and several of the experimental ideas founded by the School during this time became products within the Konami Games &amp; Music Division (later, Bemani) that were highly successful, including &quot;Beatmania&quot;, &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot;, and &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;. Namco hoped the Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory would follow a similar path. At the time, Masaya Nakamura was principal of this school, and oversaw one senior thesis class where the students were being trained on 3D modeling towards producing a game prototype with the help of other Namco employees, which could potentially be made into a full game. Ozaki suggested to Takahashi that he could have the students of this class create the 3D objects needed to populate his game world.

Takahashi took Ozaki&#x27;s advice, joining the project to help produce the prototype for his game. Alongside about ten students from the Digital Hollywood program, he had been able to gain some visual design artists from Namco to help with the prototype but had difficulty in getting any game development engineers, due to the low priority of the school. He was fortunate to find that some of the engineers from Namco&#x27;s arcade game division were going to be laid off, and he was able to convince three of them to join his team to retain their jobs within Namco.

One initial difficulty faced in developing the prototype was their choice of platform, the PlayStation 2. At the time the project started, Sony had just announced the specifications for the console, which was built from the ground-up to support 3D graphics via the Emotion Engine, but the company did not provide any updated software development kits, believing that developers would be able to figure out the hardware. As a result, the console was difficult to develop for at its launch. In contrast, Nintendo had recently announced the GameCube and that it would provide more developer-friendly features in contrast to the previous Nintendo 64 console. Thus, Takahashi&#x27;s team decided to develop for the GameCube for their prototype even though the final game was expected to be a PlayStation 2 release. In creating the prototype, Takahashi had envisioned that while the ball the player rolled around would grow as they rolled over objects, it would also shrink if they collided with obstacles and lost objects from it. This would have been tied to an interactive music track, which would have started off simple with a small ball and become more complex and full as it got larger. Technically, the team found they could not implement this shrinking mechanic due to memory limitations, and further found that with the interactive music concept, it was not fun to shrink back down and hear the music regress to a simpler form. The shrinking concept as well as the interactive music approach were subsequently dropped. The prototype was completed within about six months, in time for the year&#x27;s Japan Media Arts Festival for exhibition. Takahashi also presented the game for an internal review, leading Namco to green light the game&#x27;s full development.

Full work on &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; began in late 2001. Namco assigned Now Production, based in Osaka, to help bring the game to the PlayStation 2. Takahashi was initially concerned about having to work with an external studio in a different location, but found that the Namco and Now Production teams worked well together. The full team consisted of about twenty members between the two companies, and Namco had allocated a budget of about (about at the time of production) for the game; this was about the tenth of the cost of budget allocated for Namco&#x27;s blockbuster titles such as &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; or &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;. The full game took a year and a half to develop, with eight months of prototyping from the Digital Hollywood version.

Takahashi said that the team was aiming for four key points in developing the game: novelty, ease of understanding, enjoyment, and humor. Toru Iwatani compared the game to his own, &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, which focused on simplicity and innovation and served as a template for future games from the company. At one point during development, Takahashi &quot;proactively ignored&quot; advice from Namco to increase the complexity of the game.

The core gameplay of &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; is the subject of U.S. Patent 7,402,104, &quot;Game performing method, game apparatus, storage medium, data signal and program&quot;. The patent, issued in 2009, primarily describes how the game maintains the roughly spherical nature of the katamari when objects are picked up, though extends to concepts such as tracking objects collected based on temperature or weight values, which were modes included with later games of the series.

===Music===

The music in &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; was widely hailed as imaginative and original (winning both &quot;IGN&quot;″s and &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s &quot;Soundtrack of the Year 2004&quot; awards) and was considered one of the game&#x27;s best features. The soundtrack was released in Japan as &quot;Katamari Fortissimo Damacy&quot;. Its eclectic composition featured elements of traditional electronic video game music, as well as heavy jazz and samba influences (Shibuya-kei). Most of the tracks were composed by Yuu Miyake, and many feature vocals from popular J-pop singers, such as Yui Asaka from the &quot;Sukeban Deka 3&quot; TV series, and anime voice actors, including Nobue Matsubara and Ado Mizumori. One track is sung and written by Charlie Kosei, composer of the &quot;Lupin III&quot; soundtrack.

==Release==
A single-level demonstration of the final version of &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; was exhibited at the 2003 Tokyo Game Show (TGS). The demo was critically praised by the press, with &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Jeff Gerstmann describing it as a &quot;good dose of weird fun&quot;. Sony expressed strong interest in pushing the game&#x27;s release forward based on the TGS response, offering to handle the game&#x27;s promotion in exchange. Sony advertised the game on numerous billboards and posters across Japan, and created an infamous television ad of a businessman, waiting for an appointment, rolling up office furniture and staff. The original prototype game&#x27;s cover artwork featured the large red ball used in &quot;tamakorogashi&quot;, but for the game&#x27;s final release, Takahashi developed the game&#x27;s cover art, showing a large katamari on the verge of rolling over a city, emphasizing the scale of the game.

The game was released in Japan on March 18, 2004, priced at about , roughly two-thirds of the cost of most major titles at the time. Namco had estimated that the game would sell over 500,000 units in Japan during its first year, and while the game did not make that metric, it had stayed as one of the top ten games sold in Japan through its first nine weeks on the market, with more than 100,000 units sold during that period, which was considered impressive for a new intellectual property. The public reaction to the game was positive enough that Namco ordered a sequel by December 2004.

At this point, Namco had not considered any Western release for the game. &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; was first shown in the United States at the Experimental Gameplay Workshop during the March 2004 Game Developers Conference. A group of Western developers from the International Game Developers Association had previously brought &quot;Mojib-Ribbon&quot; to the 2003 Experimental Gameplay Workshop after seeing it demonstrated at the 2002 TGS, and had been at the 2003 TGS to look for a similar title to exhibit in 2004. Discovering &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; as an ideal title to exhibit, the group arranged with Namco to have Takahashi come to the United States to present the game. The press reaction to the session was described as &quot;electric&quot;, but they were disappointed to learn from Takahashi that there were no plans for a Western release. Media attention to the game from the Workshop, often called &quot;Namco&#x27;s snowball simulator&quot;, led to more pressure on Namco for a Western release. Takahashi was again invited to come present the game at E3 2004. Players wanting the game to release in the West also wrote to Namco for a release. That July, Namco officially announced the game&#x27;s release in North America for September 2004. The game was never officially released in Europe, though its subsequent sequels would receive European releases.

In Japanese, means &quot;clump&quot; or &quot;clod&quot; and &quot;Damashii&quot; is the rendaku form of which means &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;. Therefore, the phrase approximates to &quot;clump spirit&quot;. The two kanji that form the name look similar (sharing the same right-side element ), in a kind of visual alliteration. The name is officially transliterated as &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; in most releases. Game creator Keita Takahashi said that the title suddenly popped into his head from the start and never changed during development.

==Reception==

&quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; enjoyed moderate success in Japan. The game was sold at about two-thirds of the price of a new game at the time. It was the top-selling game the week of its release with 32,000 units sold, and sold over 155,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2004. Namco, however, originally estimated that over 500,000 units would be sold in Japan.

The game was not released in PAL territories such as Europe and Australia since publishers thought it was too &quot;quirky&quot; for these markets; Electronic Arts picked up both sequels, &quot;We Love Katamari&quot; and &quot;Me &amp; My Katamari&quot;, for release in Europe.

In North America the game was acclaimed by critics, and was mentioned and praised on TechTV, and was a featured sidebar in the May 2004 edition of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. &quot;Time&quot; continued to praise the game in its November 2004 &quot;Best games of the year&quot; special, calling it &quot;the most unusual and original game&quot; for PlayStation 2. Most retailers underestimated the demand for such a quirky game, and only purchased a few copies of this sleeper hit; it rapidly sold out nationwide, with sales surpassing 120,000 units in North America. It also won the U.S. award for &quot;Excellence in Game Design&quot; at the 2005 Game Developers Choice Awards, and G4 awarded &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; its &quot;Best Innovation&quot; prize in its G-Phoria of that year. &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; was one of the recipients of the 2004 Good Design Award in Japan, the first time a video game has won this award. During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; with &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Console Gaming&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Design&quot;, as well as receiving nominations for &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Original Musical Composition&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best PlayStation 2 game of September 2004. It later won the publication&#x27;s year-end &quot;Best Puzzle/Rhythm Game&quot;, &quot;Best Original Music&quot; and &quot;Most Innovative Game&quot; awards across all platforms.

In 2015, the game placed 13th on &quot;USgamer&quot;″s The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list. In 2019, it was ranked 49th on &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper&#x27;s &quot;The 50 Best Video Games of the 21st Century&quot; list.

Although the game has rapidly achieved a cult following and has been praised by many reviewers, it also has its share of criticism. A common complaint is that the game is relatively short and repetitive—it can be completed in under ten hours, and the gameplay stays virtually the same all the way through. Others, however, such as &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; reviewer Mark McDonald (who gave the game 8.5 out of ten with his &quot;EGM&quot; staff), argue that the game&#x27;s limitations, such as having &quot;basically ... the same&quot; objective in each level, are made up by its strengths, like &quot;elegant&quot; controls, its soundtrack, and &quot;wicked&quot; humor. As a well-executed, non-traditional game, &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; has been influential in the game development community. Since its release, a number of other games have been inspired by &quot;Katamari&quot;, such as &quot;The Wonderful End of the World&quot; and &quot;Donut County&quot;.

==Legacy==

&quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; has spawned numerous sequels on the PlayStation 2 and newer game consoles. The game&#x27;s direct sequel on the PlayStation 2, &quot;We Love Katamari&quot;, was released internationally in 2005 and 2006. Its story is self-referential, following on the success of the first game, most of the levels are based on requests from newfound fans of the King and the Prince. Though sharing the same mechanics, &quot;We Love Katamari&quot; introduces new gameplay features, such as co-operative play, and new goals, such as collecting the most valuable objects, that would continue through its sequels.

On July 29, 2012, the game was included in an exhibit at the New York Museum of Modern Art, entitled &quot;Century of the Child: Growing by Design&quot;. Here, the game was used to demonstrate the change in toys and &quot;playthings&quot; over the 20th century, specifically praising the game for its &quot;quirky manipulations of scale&quot; that makes it accessible for all ages. Vice president of marketing for Namco Bandai Games America, Inc. Carlson Choi described the inclusion of &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; to the exhibit as &quot;a testament to the creative designs embodied in Namco Bandai&#x27;s games, in addition to being a validation of video games as a modern form of interactive art&quot;. On November 29 of the same year, the game was included in the permanent collection of video games of the Museum of Modern Art. Curator Paola Antonelli selected &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; among the first fourteen games to be displayed in the museum, which was chosen according to a variety of criteria, including &quot;visual quality, elegance of the code and design of playing behavior&quot;.

A high-definition remaster of the game made with Unity, titled &quot;Katamari Damacy Reroll&quot;, was released on the Nintendo Switch and Windows on December 7, 2018. Known as &quot;Katamari Damacy Encore&quot; in Japan, it is the first title in Bandai Namco Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Encore&quot; series of remasters. The game includes support for the Switch&#x27;s gyro controls in addition to its traditional control scheme. &quot;Reroll&quot; was nominated for the Freedom Tower Award for Best Remake at the 2020 New York Game Awards. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were released in November 2020. A version for Amazon Luna became available on March 4, 2021, and a Stadia version in September of the same year.

In a retrospective in 2019, &quot;Edge&quot; noted that playing the game 15 years after its initial release reveals how influential the game has been for independent games following it, and added that Takahashi&#x27;s game is &quot;playful and tremendously funny, deeply weird and a game with real heart&quot;.

<text>Sněžka () or Śnieżka (, , ) is a mountain on the border between the Czech Republic and Poland, the most prominent point of the Silesian Ridge in the Giant Mountains. At , its summit is the highest point in the Czech Republic, in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in the Giant Mountains and in the entire Sudetes.

== History ==

Sněžka was one of the first European mountains visited by many tourists. This was mainly due to the relatively minor technical difficulties of the ascent and the fact that since the sixteenth century, many resort visitors flocked to the nearby Bad Warmbrunn (today: Cieplice Śląskie-Zdrój) and the highly visible Sněžka, visually dominant over all Giant Mountains was for them an important attraction.

The first historical account of an ascent to the peak is in 1456, by an unknown Venetian merchant searching for precious stones. The first settlements on the mountain soon appeared, being primarily mining communities, tapping into its deposits of copper, iron and arsenic. The mining shafts, totalling in length, remain to this day.

The first recorded German name was &quot;Riseberg&quot; (&quot;giant mountain&quot;, cf. &quot;Riesengebirge&quot;, &quot;Giant Mountains&quot;), mentioned by Georg Agricola in 1546. Fifteen years later the name &quot;Riesenberg&quot; appears on Martin Helwig&#x27;s map of Silesia. The German name later changed to &quot;Riesenkoppe&quot; (&quot;giant top&quot;) and finally to &quot;Schneekoppe&quot; (&quot;snow top&quot;, &quot;snowy head&quot;). Based on paintings of Caspar David Friedrich and of novels from Theodor Fontane the Schneekoppe region became a center of the first German tourism movement. 

In Czech, the mountain was initially called &quot;Pahrbek Sněžný&quot; (&quot;snow hill&quot;); later &quot;Sněžka&quot;, with the eventual name &quot;Sněžovka&quot;, meaning &quot;snowy&quot; or &quot;snow-covered&quot;, which was adopted in 1823. An older Polish name for the mountain was &quot;Góra Olbrzymia&quot;, meaning &quot;giant mountain&quot;.

The first building on the mountaintop was the Chapel of Saint Lawrence (&quot;Laurentiuskapelle&quot;), built c. 1665–1681 by the Silesian noble Schaffgotsch family to give thanks to God and shelter to travellers as it also served as an inn for a brief period of time. The territory including the mines were the property of the Schaffgotsch family until 1945. The so-called &quot;Prussian hut&quot; (&quot;Preußische Baude&quot;) was built on the Silesian (now Polish) side in 1850, followed by the &quot;Bohemian hut&quot; (&quot;Česká bouda&quot;) on the Bohemian (now Czech) side in 1868, both built with the purpose of providing lodging. The Prussian hut was rebuilt twice after fires (1857 and 1862), and the (after 1945) &quot;Polish hut&quot; was finally demolished in 1967. The Bohemian hut fell into disrepair after 1990 and was demolished in 2004.

A wooden weather station was built on the mountaintop in c. 1900, being the only weather station in Central Europe remaining intact after World War II. It was demolished in the 1980s.
== Today ==

One side of the mountain is in the Czech Republic; the other belongs since 1945 to Poland. Both sides of the border have lost their historic German-speaking populations in the wake of World War II. The area is very popular in summer with tourists from the Czech Republic, Poland, and Germany, who enjoy hiking in the alpine environment unique to this area.

On the Polish side a disc-shaped observatory with a weather station and restaurant was built in 1974, and the St. Lawrence Chapel. On the Czech side are a post office, and a chairlift station, connecting the peak with the town of Pec pod Sněžkou at the base of the mountain.

Although the mountain is the highest natural peak in the Czech Republic, the actual highest point is the top of the television transmitter on Praděd, reaching 1,652 metres (1,491+162 m). If the Polish observatory is taken into account, Sněžka peaks at 1,620 metres.

In 2004 a new post office and observation platform replaced an old post office and the remains of the Bohemian hut, which had been closed since the 1980s.

In March 2009 the Polish observatory suffered serious damage to the upper disc as a result of extreme weather and structural failure. The upper disc&#x27;s floor broke, though a fast response from the Technical University of Wrocław saved the remaining disc from taking any further damage. The restaurant and meteo offices were reopened soon after the construction team had finished clearing the debris and securing what was left of the observatory. After detailed inspection it was determined that no further damage should occur and the building was restored to its previous state. The upper disc was restored to its 1974 design (with contemporary improvements), skipping certain &quot;improvements&quot; made in 1980s and 1990s which were suspected to contribute to the structural failure of March 2009.

The old chairlift to the top of Sněžka was replaced by a new cable car system. Since February 2014, the four-person cabins in two sections have carried 250 visitors per hour from Pec pod Sněžkou.

There are many marked tourist routes from the Polish side to the summit, mainly from the town of Karpacz. It is possible to take a chairlift from Karpacz to Kopa (1377 m a.s.l.) which significantly shortens the way to the summit.

Sněžka belongs to the Crown of Europe, Crown of Polish Mountains and Crown of Sudetes.

== Climate ==
Due to high altitude the climate is maritime polar (Köppen: &quot;ET&quot;) not far from a continental subpolar climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;). The difference should be at least 6 °C lower on annual average compared to the weather station in the plains.

==Features==

===Town belt===
===Greek community===

A strong link was forged between Cretans and New Zealanders during World War II. New Zealanders left behind in the retreat from Crete were hidden from the occupying army by Cretans at great personal danger and they were able to harass occupying forces. A commemoration of the Battle of Crete is held each year in May.
Lloyd Street which is the site of the Greek community centre and the Greek Orthodox Cathedral was renamed Hania Street after Crete&#x27;s old capital. Wellington&#x27;s Olympic Football Club was established by Father Ilias Economou for his parishioners.

About 65 per cent of Greek New Zealanders live in Wellington and in the decades following World War II they were concentrated in Mount Victoria. The greatest concentration is now in Miramar and around half of Greek weddings are now with other New Zealanders.

===Boundaries===
The suburb is almost entirely residential with commercial activity along Kent Terrace on its north-western boundary. The houses are on the north-western flank of the ridge above the southern end of the Wellington CBD, Te Aro. Adjoining suburbs are Oriental Bay with Roseneath, Newtown to the south, Te Aro to the west beyond Kent Terrace and Hataitai on the far side of the ridge beyond the town belt.
;Waterfront
What would seem to be residential Mount Victoria&#x27;s frontage to the harbour is now technically a one-building-wide strip of Oriental Bay. The houses in Roxburgh, McFarlane, Hawker and Moeller Streets are all in Mount Victoria. The houses below those streets front onto Oriental Parade which is defined as Oriental Bay. The old monastery is in Mount Victoria. Palliser Road is in Roseneath.

Wellington College and Government House, official residence of New Zealand&#x27;s Governor-General, are beyond the southern boundary to the south-east of cricket&#x27;s Basin Reserve. Beyond Government House is Newtown&#x27;s Wellington Hospital.

==Lord of the Rings connection==

Mount Victoria was used twice as a location in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. The very first footage on the project was shot off Alexandra Road on 11 October 1999, called the &quot;Get off the road&quot; scene, followed by the &quot;Escape from the Nazgûl&quot; scenes a few hundred metres to the North. Later an old quarry at the top end of Ellice Street was used as the Rohirrim camp at Dunharrow.

<text>The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) was an international organization for collective defense in Southeast Asia created by the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty signed in September 1954 in Manila, Philippines. The formal institution of SEATO was established on 19 February 1955 at a meeting of treaty partners in Bangkok, Thailand. The organization&#x27;s headquarters was also in Bangkok. A total of eight members joined the organization in its lifetime.

Primarily created to block further communist gains in Southeast Asia, SEATO is generally considered a failure, as internal conflict and dispute hindered general use of the SEATO military; however, SEATO-funded cultural and educational programs left longstanding effects in Southeast Asia. SEATO was dissolved on 30 June 1977, after many of its members lost interest and withdrew.

==Origins and structure==
The Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty was signed on 8 September 1954 in Manila, as part of the American Truman Doctrine of creating anti-communist bilateral and collective defense treaties. These treaties and agreements were intended to create alliances that would keep communist powers in check (Communist China, in SEATO&#x27;s case). This policy was considered to have been largely developed by American diplomat George F. Kennan. President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s Secretary of State John Foster Dulles (1953–1959) is considered to be the primary force behind the creation of SEATO, which expanded the concept of anti-communist collective defense to Southeast Asia. Then-Vice President Richard Nixon advocated an Asian equivalent of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) upon returning from his Asia trip of late 1953, and NATO was the model for the new organization, with the military forces of each member intended to be coordinated to provide for the collective defense of the member states.

The organization, headquartered in Bangkok, was created in 1955 at the first meeting of the Council of Ministers set up by the treaty. This was contrary to Dulles&#x27;s preference to call the organization &quot;ManPac&quot; (Manila Pact) to avoid public identification of the pact with NATO. Organizationally, SEATO was headed by the Secretary General, whose office was created in 1957 at a meeting in Canberra, with a council of representatives from member states and an international staff. Also present were committees for economics, security, and information. SEATO&#x27;s first Secretary General was Pote Sarasin, a Thai diplomat and politician who had served as Thailand&#x27;s ambassador to the U.S. between 1952 and 1957, and as Prime Minister of Thailand from September 1957 to 1 January 1958.

Unlike the NATO alliance, SEATO had no joint commands with standing forces. In addition, SEATO&#x27;s response protocol in the event of communism presenting a &quot;common danger&quot; to the member states was vague and ineffective, though membership in the SEATO alliance did provide a rationale for a large-scale U.S. military intervention in the region during the Vietnam War (1955–1975).

==Membership==

Despite its name, SEATO mostly included countries located outside of the region but with an interest either in the region or the organization itself. They were Australia (which administered Papua New Guinea, until 1975), France (which had recently relinquished French Indochina, by 1955), New Zealand, Pakistan (which, until 1971, included East Pakistan, now Bangladesh), the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom (which administered Hong Kong, North Borneo and Sarawak) and the United States.

The Philippines and Thailand were the only Southeast Asian countries that actually participated in the organization. They shared close ties with the United States, particularly the Philippines, and they faced incipient communist insurgencies against their own governments. Thailand became a member upon the discovery of the newly founded &quot;Thai Autonomous Region&quot; in Yunnan (the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in South West China) – apparently feeling threatened by potential Maoist subversion on its land. Other regional countries like Burma and Indonesia were far more mindful of domestic internal stability rather than any communist threat, and thus rejected joining it. Malaya (independence in 1957; including Singapore between 1963 and 1965) also chose not to participate formally, though it was kept updated with key developments due to its close relationship with the United Kingdom.

The states newly formed from French Indochina (North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos) were prevented from taking part in any international military alliance as a result of the Geneva Agreements signed 20 July of the same year concluding the end of the First Indochina War. However, with the lingering threat coming from communist North Vietnam and the possibility of the domino theory with Indochina turning into a communist frontier, SEATO got these countries under its protection – an act that would be considered to be one of the main justifications for the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Cambodia, however rejected the protection in 1956.

The majority of SEATO members were not located in Southeast Asia. To Australia and New Zealand, SEATO was seen as a more satisfying organization than ANZUS – a collective defense organization with the U.S. The United Kingdom and France joined partly due to having long maintained colonies in the region, and partly due to concerns over developments in Indochina. The U.S., upon perceiving Southeast Asia to be a pivotal frontier for Cold War geopolitics, saw the establishment of SEATO as essential to its Cold War containment policy.

The membership reflected a mid-1950s combination of anti-communist Western states and such states in Southeast Asia. The United Kingdom, France and the United States, the latter of which joined after the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty by an 82–1 vote, represented the strongest Western powers. Canada also considered joining, but decided against it in order to concentrate on its NATO responsibilities with its limited defense capabilities.

===Budget===
Average of contributions to civil and military budgets between 1958 and 1973:
* United States: 24%
* United Kingdom: 16%
* France: 13.5%
* Australia: 13.5%
* Pakistan: 8%
* Philippines: 8%
* Thailand: 8%
* New Zealand: 8%

==Military aspects==
After its creation, SEATO quickly became insignificant militarily, as most of its member nations contributed very little to the alliance. While SEATO military forces held joint military training, they were never deployed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable to intervene in conflicts in Laos because France and the United Kingdom rejected the use of military action. As a result, the U.S. provided unilateral support for Laos after 1962. Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the Vietnam War was denied because of lack of British and French cooperation.

Both the United States and Australia cited the alliance as justification for involvement in Vietnam. U.S. membership in SEATO provided the United States with a rationale for a large-scale U.S. military intervention in Southeast Asia. Other countries, such as the UK and key states in Asia, accepted the rationale. In 1962, as part of its commitment to SEATO, the Royal Australian Air Force deployed CAC Sabres of its No. 79 Squadron to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The Sabres began to play a role in the Vietnam War in 1965, when their air defense responsibilities expanded to include protection of USAF aircraft using Ubon as a base for strikes against North Vietnam.

==Cultural effects==
In addition to joint military training, SEATO member states worked on improving mutual social and economic issues. Such activities were overseen by SEATO&#x27;s Committee of Information, Culture, Education, and Labor Activities, and proved to be some of SEATO&#x27;s greatest successes. In 1959, SEATO&#x27;s first Secretary General, Pote Sarasin, created the SEATO Graduate School of Engineering (currently the Asian Institute of Technology) in Thailand to train engineers. SEATO also sponsored the creation of the Teacher Development Center in Bangkok, as well as the Thai Military Technical Training School, which offered technical programs for supervisors and workmen. SEATO&#x27;s Skilled Labor Project (SLP) created artisan training facilities, especially in Thailand, where ninety-one training workshops were established.

SEATO also provided research funding and grants in agriculture and medical fields. In 1959, SEATO set up the Cholera Research Laboratory in Bangkok, later establishing a second Cholera Research Laboratory in Dacca, East Pakistan. The Dacca (now Dhaka) laboratory soon became the world&#x27;s leading cholera research facility and was later renamed the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. SEATO was also interested in literature, and a SEATO Literature Award was created and given to writers from member states.

==Criticism and dissolution==
Though Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered SEATO an essential element in U.S. foreign policy in Asia, historians have considered the Manila Pact a failure, and the pact is rarely mentioned in history books. In &quot;The Geneva Conference of 1954 on Indochina&quot;, Sir James Cable, a British diplomat and naval strategist, cabled the Foreign Office and described SEATO as &quot;a fig leaf for the nakedness of American policy&quot;, citing the Manila Pact as a &quot;zoo of paper tigers&quot;. As early as the 1950s Aneurin Bevan unsuccessfully tried to block SEATO in the British Parliament, at one point interrupting a parliamentary debate between Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and Leader of the Opposition Clement Attlee to excoriate them both for considering the idea.

Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia reported that Foster Dulles went to great efforts to convince him to join SEATO; however, he refused because &quot;I considered SEATO an aggressive military alliance directed against neighbors whose ideology I did not share but with whom Cambodia had no quarrel&quot;, While Norodom Sihanouk justified his refusal to join SEATO by claiming it was an aggressive alliance directed against neighbors with whom Cambodia had no quarrel, despite ideological differences. However, this statement is misleading, as Sihanouk later aligned the Kingdom of Cambodia with Communist governments and political parties such as the China and North Vietnam, Khmer Rouge, That directly opposed Cambodia&#x27;s proclaimed neutrality and contributed to internal conflict and regional instability. This contradiction calls into question the inconsistency of his commitment to non-alignment and neutrality.&quot;

In the early 1970s, the question of dissolving the organization arose. Pakistan withdrew in 1973, after East Pakistan seceded and became Bangladesh on 16 December 1971. South Vietnam was defeated in war and annexed by North Vietnam and France withdrew financial support in 1975, and the SEATO council agreed to the phasing-out of the organization. After a final exercise on 20 February 1976, the organization was formally dissolved on 30 June 1977 during the Carter administration. Despite the dissolution of SEATO, its underlying collective defense treaty remains in force.

<text>A bouncer (also known as a door supervisor) is a type of security guard, employed at licensed or sanctioned venues such as bars, nightclubs, cabaret clubs, strip clubs and casinos. A bouncer&#x27;s duties are to provide security, to check legal age and drinking age, to refuse entry for intoxicated persons, and to deal with aggressive, violent or verbal behavior or disobedience with statutory or establishment rules. They are also charged with maintaining order, and ensuring that laws and regulations are followed by all patrons.

They are civilians and they are often hired directly by the venue, rather than by a security firm throughout the Western world and particularly in the U.S. Bouncers are often required where crowd size, clientele or alcohol consumption may make arguments or fights a possibility, or where the threat or presence of criminal gang activity or violence is high. At some clubs, bouncers are also responsible for &quot;face control&quot;, choosing who is allowed to patronize the establishment. Some establishments may also assign a bouncer to be responsible for cover charge collections. In the United States, civil liability and court costs related to the use of force by bouncers are &quot;the highest preventable loss found within the [bar] industry&quot;, as many United States bouncers are often taken to court and other countries have similar problems of excessive force. In many countries, state governments have taken steps to professionalise the industry by requiring bouncers to have training, licensing, and a criminal records background check. In the United Kingdom, all door supervisors are required to be registered with and are licensed by the Security Industry Authority. These operatives go through a one week training regime, and are often more highly skilled than operatives without this training, as is evident by the reduced number of assaults by bouncers since the introduction of the license. Some licensed premises are obligated to use registered door supervisors as a condition of their license.

==Terminology==
Other terms include &quot;cooler&quot; in the U.S. and &quot;door supervisor&quot; in the U.K. In U.S. bars, &quot;cooler&quot; is often the term for the head bouncer. The &quot;cooler&quot; is expected to have the same ability to respond to physical situations as the rest of the bouncers, but should also have reliable interpersonal skills that can be used to de-escalate situations without violence.

==History==
In the 1990s and 2000s, increased awareness of the risks of lawsuits and criminal charges have led many bars and venues to train their bouncers to use communication and conflict resolution skills before, or rather than, resorting to brute force against troublemakers. However, the earlier history of the occupation suggests that the stereotype of bouncers as rough, tough, physical enforcers has indeed been the case in many countries and cultures throughout history. Historical references also suggest that the &#x27;door supervisor&#x27; function of guarding a place and selecting who can have entry to it (the stereotypical task of the modern bouncer) could at times be an honorific and evolve into a relatively important position.

===Ancient===
The significance of the door supervisor as the person allowing (or barring) entry is found in a number of Mesopotamian myths (and later in Greek myths descended from them), including that of Nergal overcoming the seven doormen guarding the gates to the Underworld.

In 1 Chronicles 26 of the Old Testament, the Levitical Temple is described as having a number of &#x27;gatekeepers&#x27;—amongst their duties are &quot;protect[ing] the temple from theft&quot;, from &quot;illegal entry into sacred areas&quot; and &quot;maintain[ing] order&quot;, all functions they share with the modern concept of the bouncer, though the described temple servants also serve as holy persons and administrators themselves (it is noted that some administrative function is still present in today&#x27;s bouncing in the higher position of the supervisor).
Door supervisors or bouncers are usually larger persons who display great strength and size.

The Romans had a position known as the &quot;ostiarius&quot; (doorkeeper), initially a slave, who guarded the door, and sometimes ejected unwanted people from the house whose gate he guarded. The term later become a low-ranking clergy title.

Plautus, in his play &quot;Bacchides&quot; (written approximately 194–184 BC), mentions a &quot;large and powerful&quot; doorman / bouncer as a threat to get an unwelcome visitor to leave.

Tertullian, an early Christian author living mainly in the 2nd century AD, while reporting on the casual oppression of Christians in Carthage, noted that bouncers were counted as part of a semi-legal underworld, amongst other &#x27;shady&#x27; characters such as gamblers and pimps.

Within Buddhist lore, the Nio, the twin guardian statues who decorate the entrances of temples, dojos, and various places related with religious importance, are believed to be the embodiment of wrathful deity bodhisattvas such as Vajrapani, Mahasthamaprapta, Vajrasattva, Acala, or various figures within Buddhist legend who accompanied Gautama Buddha during his journeys to spread his teachings to protect him and aid in cases needing justified force.

===Modern===
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, US saloon-keepers and brothel madams hired bouncers to remove troublesome, violent, or dead-drunk patrons, and to protect the saloon girls and prostitutes. The word &quot;bouncer&quot; was first popularized in a novel by Horatio Alger, called The &quot;Young Outlaw&quot;, which was first published in 1875. Alger was an immensely popular author in the 19th century, especially with young people and his books were widely quoted. In Chapter XIV, entitled &quot;Bounced&quot;, a boy is thrown out of a restaurant because he has no money to pay for his meal:

An 1883 newspaper article stated that The Bouncer&#x27; is merely the English &#x27;chucker out&#x27;. When liberty verges on license and gaiety on wanton delirium, the Bouncer selects the gayest of the gay, and—bounces him!&quot;

====19th century====

In US Western towns in the 1870s, high-class brothels known as &quot;good houses&quot; or &quot;parlour houses&quot; hired bouncers for security and to prevent patrons from evading payment. &quot;Good house&quot;-style brothels &quot;... considered themselves the cream of the crop, and [the prostitutes working there] scorned those who worked in (or out of) saloons, dance halls, and theatres.&quot; The best bordellos looked like respectable mansions, with attractively decorated parlours, a game room and a dance hall. For security, &quot;somewhere in every parlor of the house there was always a bouncer, a giant of a man who stayed sober to handle any customer who got too rough with one of the girls or didn&#x27;t want to pay his bill.&quot; The &quot;protective presence&quot; of bouncers in high-class brothels was &quot;... one of the reasons the girls considered themselves superior to [lower-class] free-lancers, who lacked any such shepherds.&quot;

In Wisconsin&#x27;s lumberjack days, bouncers would physically remove drinkers who were too drunk to keep buying drinks, and thus free up space in the bar for new patrons. The slang term &#x27;snake-room&#x27; was used to describe a &quot;...room off a saloon, usually two or three steps down, into which a bar-keeper or the bouncer could slide drunk lumber-jacks head first through swinging doors from the bar-room.&quot; In the late 19th century, until Prohibition, bouncers also had the unusual role of protecting the saloon&#x27;s buffet. To attract business, &quot;...many saloons lured customers with offers of a &quot;free lunch&quot;—usually well salted to inspire drinking, and the saloon &quot;bouncer&quot; was generally on hand to discourage [those with too] hearty appetites&quot;.

In the late 19th century, bouncers at small town dances and bars physically resolved disputes and removed troublemakers, without worrying about lawsuits. In the main bar in one Iowa town, &quot;...there were many quarrels, many fights, but all were settled on the spot. There were no court costs [for the bouncers or the bar]; only some aches and pains [for the troublemakers].&quot;

In the 1880s and 1890s, bouncers were used to maintain order in &quot;The Gut&quot;, the roughest part of New York City&#x27;s Coney Island, which was filled with &quot;ramshackle groups of wooden shanties&quot;, bars, cabarets, fleabag hotels and brothels. Huge bouncers patrolled these venues of vice and &quot;roughly ejected anyone who violated the loose rules of decorum&quot; by engaging in pick-pocketing, jewelry thieving, or bloody fights.

During the 1890s, San Diego had a similarly rough waterfront area and red-light district called the &#x27;Stingaree&#x27;, where bouncers worked the door at brothels. Prostitutes worked at the area&#x27;s 120 bawdy houses in small rooms, paying a fee to the procurer who usually was the bouncer or &#x27;protector&#x27; of the brothel. The more expensive, higher-class brothels were called &quot;parlour houses&quot;, and they were &quot;run most decorously&quot;, and the &quot;best of food and drink was served.&quot; To maintain the high-class atmosphere at these establishments, male patrons were expected to act like gentlemen; &quot;... if any customer did or said anything out of line, he was asked to leave. A bouncer made sure he did&quot;.

====20th century====
Bouncers in pre-World War I United States were also sometimes used as the guardians of morality. As ballroom dancing was often considered as an activity which could lead to immoral conduct if the dancers got too close, some of the more reputable venues had bouncers to remind patrons not to dance closer than nine inches to their partners. The bouncers&#x27; warnings tended to consist of light taps on the shoulder at first, and then progressed to sterner remonstrations.

In the 1930s, bars in the bawdiest parts of Baltimore, Maryland docks hired bouncers to maintain order and eject aggressive patrons. The Oasis club, operated by Max Cohen, hired &quot;...a lady bouncer by the name of Mickey Steele, a six-foot acrobat from the Pennsylvania coal fields. Mickey was always considerate of the people she bounced; first asking them where they lived and then throwing them in that general direction. She was succeeded by a character known as &#x27;Machine-Gun Butch&#x27; who was a long-time bouncer at the club&quot;.

In the Weimar Republic in the Germany of the 1920s and early 1930s, doormen protected venues from the fights caused by Nazis and other potentially violent groups (such as Communists). Such scenes were fictionalised in the movie &quot;Cabaret&quot;. Hitler surrounded himself with a number of former bouncers such as Christian Weber; the SS originated as a group designated to protect party meetings.

In early Nazi Germany, some bouncers in underground jazz clubs were also hired to screen for Nazi spies, because jazz was considered a &quot;degenerate&quot; form of music by the Nazi party. Later during the Nazi regime, bouncers also increasingly barred non-German people (such as foreign workers) from public functions, such as &#x27;German&#x27; dances at dance halls.

Bouncers also often come into conflict with football hooligans, due to the tendency of groups of hooligans to congregate at pubs and bars before and after games. In the United Kingdom for example, long-running series of feuds between fan groups like The Blades and groups of bouncers in the 1990s were described by researchers.

Bouncers have also been known to be associated with criminal gangs, especially in places like Russia, Hong Kong or Japan, where bouncers may often belong to these groups or have to pay the crime syndicates to be able to operate. In Hong Kong, triad-connected reprisal or intimidation attacks against bouncers have been known to occur.

Hong Kong also features a somewhat unusual situation where some bouncers are known to work for prostitutes, instead of being their pimps. Hong Kong police have noted that due to the letter of the law, they sometimes had to charge the bouncer for illegally extorting the women when the usually expected dominance situation between the sex worker and her &quot;protector&quot; was in fact reversed.

In the 1990s and 2000s, a number of bouncers have written &quot;tell-all&quot; books about their experiences on the door. They indicate that male bouncers are respected by some club-goers as the ultimate &#x27;hard men&#x27;, while at the same time, these bouncers can also be s for aggression and macho posturing on the part of obnoxious male customers wanting to prove themselves. Bouncing has also started to attract some academic interest as part of ethnographic studies into violent subcultures. Bouncers were selected as one of the groups studied by several English researchers in the 1990s because their culture was seen as &quot;grounded in violence&quot;, as well as because the group had increasingly been &quot;demonised&quot;, especially in common liberal discourse (see Research section of this article).

====21st century====
In 2006, a German newspaper reported that organized crime is operating bouncer extortion rackets in &quot;Berlin, Hamburg, the Ruhr Valley and the Rhein-Main region&quot; in which bar owners are &quot;compelled to hire a bouncer, for 100 euros ($128) per hour&quot;, to &quot;protect&quot; against damage to their venue from the &quot;wrong&quot; type of patron or violence. In 2008, newspapers reported that some bouncers in London and other northern UK towns were &quot;extorting cash from [club] businesses&quot; by operating protection rackets, in which they offer to sell &quot;protection&quot; to club owners, telling them &quot;you&#x27;re going to pay us, or else&quot; the club owner&#x27;s venue may be damaged.

==Research and sociology==

===Outside studies===
In the early 1990s, an Australian government study on violence stated that violent incidents in public drinking locations are caused by the interaction of five factors: aggressive and unreasonable bouncers, groups of male strangers, low comfort (e.g., unventilated, hot clubs), high boredom, and high drunkenness. The research indicated that bouncers did not play as large a role &quot;... as expected in the creation of an aggressive or violence prone atmosphere [in bars].&quot; However, the study did show that &quot;...edgy and aggressive bouncers, especially when they are arbitrary or petty in their manner, do have an adverse effect.&quot; The study stated that bouncers:

...have been observed to initiate fights or further encourage them on several occasions. Many seem poorly trained, obsessed with their own machismo, and relate badly to groups of male strangers. Some of them appear to regard their employment as giving them a licence to assault people. This may be encouraged by management adherence to a repressive model of supervision of patrons (&quot;if they play up, thump &#x27;em&quot;), which in fact does not reduce trouble, and exacerbates an already hostile and aggressive situation. In practice many bouncers are not well managed in their work, and appear to be given a job autonomy and discretion that they cannot handle well.
A 1998 article &quot;Responses by Security Staff to Aggressive Incidents in Public Settings&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Drug Issues&quot; examined 182 violent incidents involving crowd controllers (bouncers) that occurred in bars in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The study indicated that in 12% of the incidents the bouncers had good responses, in 20% of the incidents, the bouncers had a neutral response; and in 36% of the incidents, the bouncers &quot;... responses were rated as bad—that is, the crowd controllers enhanced the likelihood of violence but were themselves not violent.&quot; Finally, &quot;... in almost one-third of incidents, 31 per cent, the crowd controllers&#x27; responses were rated as ugly. The controllers&#x27; actions involved gratuitous aggression, harassment of patrons and provocative behaviour.&quot;

===Inside studies===
At least one major ethnographic study also observed bouncing from within, as part of a British project to study violent subcultures. Beyond studying the bouncer culture from the outside, the group selected a suitable candidate for covert, long-term research. The man had previously worked as a bouncer before becoming an academic, and while conversant with the milieu, it required some time for him to re-enter bouncing work in a new locality. The study has, however, attracted some criticism due to the fact that the researcher, while fulfilling his duties as a bouncer and being required to set aside his academic distance, would have been at risk of losing objectivity—though it was accepted that this quandary might be difficult to resolve.

One of the main ethical issues of the research was the participation of the researcher in violence, and to what degree he would be allowed to participate. The group could not fully resolve this issue, as the undercover researcher would not have been able to gain the trust of his peers while shying away from the use of force. As part of the study it eventually became clear that bouncers themselves were similarly and constantly weighing up the limits and uses of their participation in violence. The research however found that instead of being a part of the occupation, violence itself was the defining characteristic, a &quot;culture created around violence and violent expectation&quot;.

The bouncing culture&#x27;s insular attitudes also extended to the recruitment process, which was mainly by word of mouth as opposed to typical job recruitment, and also depended heavily on previous familiarity with violence. This does not extend to the prospective bouncer himself having to have a reputation for violence—rather a perception was needed that he could deal with it if required. Various other elements, such as body language or physical looks (muscles, shaved heads) were also described as often expected for entry into bouncing—being part of the symbolic &#x27;narratives of intimidation&#x27; that set bouncers apart in their work environment.

Training on the job was described as very limited, with the new bouncers being &#x27;thrown into the deep end&#x27;—the fact that they had been accepted for the job in the first place including the assessment that they should know what they are doing (though informal observation of a beginner&#x27;s behaviour was commonplace). In the case of the British research project, the legally required licensing as a bouncer was also found to be expected by employers before applicants started the job (and as licensing generally excluded people with criminal convictions, this kept out some of the more unstable violent personalities).

==Roles==
Bouncers monitor a club or venue to &quot;detect, report and correct any condition inside/outside the club&quot; which could lead to injuries of patrons or staff or to damage of the club or its equipment. A key role for bouncers is communicating information within a club to the venue employees who need to know (e.g., regarding injuries, size of crowd outside, capacity of venue, incidents, etc.). Bouncers answer questions about club policies and procedures while controlling crowds (by asking people not to block entrances, exits, stairwells, and other high-traffic areas). Bouncers lead &quot;injury and emergency procedures&quot; if a patron is injured and requires first aid. In a large nightclub, the bouncers may be part of a security team that includes friskers (who check for weapons and drugs), surveillance staff, a doorman, and floor men, with all of these security staff reporting to a chief of security, who in turn, reports to the general manager. In countries like the UK, or where the venue may be smaller in the US, all security personnel are considered bouncers/door supervisors and usually undertake all of the above roles at the same time. This can also include CCTV operation and sweeps/patrols of the venue.

===Character and personality===
Although a common stereotype of bouncers is that of the thuggish brute, a good club security staff member requires more than just physical qualities such as strength and size: &quot;The best bouncers don’t &quot;bounce&quot; anyone... they talk to people&quot; (and remind them of the venue rules). Lee Vineyard states that the &quot;tough guy&quot; mentality and look of some bouncers, in which they have their sleeves rolled up to show off their biceps and they have their arms crossed, can actually create more potential for fights than a bouncer who greets patrons with a &quot;hello&quot;, and is thus approachable.

An ability to judge and communicate well with people will reduce the need for physical intervention, while a steady personality will prevent the bouncer from being easily provoked by customers. Bouncers need to be able to detect the early warning signs of a potential confrontation with a patron, by observing crowds and individuals and spotting the signs of a &quot;heated&quot; interaction that could become a fight.

Bouncers also profit from good written communication skills, because they are often required to document assaults in an incident log or using an incident form. Well-kept incident logs can protect the employee from any potential criminal charges or lawsuits that later arise from an incident. Bouncers need to be polite when answering questions or controlling crowds. In larger clubs, bouncers need to be able to work with a team of bouncers, which may require the use of radios to stay in contact and communicate (particularly between the inside and outside of a club). In bouncer teams, the bouncers must be aware of the location of the other bouncers, and ensure that when one bouncer relocates (e.g., to go to the bathroom), a gap is not left in the venue security.

However, UK research from the 1990s also indicates that a major part of both the group identity and the job satisfaction of bouncers is related to their self image as a strongly masculine person who is capable of dealing with – and dealing out – violence; their employment income plays a lesser role in their job satisfaction. Bouncer subculture is strongly influenced by perceptions of honour and shame, a typical characteristic of groups that are in the public eye. Factors in enjoying work as a bouncer were also found in the general prestige and respect that was accorded to bouncers, sometimes bordering on . The camaraderie between bouncers (even of different clubs), as well as the ability to work &quot;in the moment&quot; and outside of the drudgery of typical jobs were also often cited.

The same research has also indicated that the decisions made by bouncers, while seeming haphazard to an outsider, often have a basis in rational logic. The decision to turn certain customers away at the door because of too casual clothing (face control) is for example often based on the perception that the person will be more willing to fight (compared to someone dressed in expensive attire). Many similar decisions taken by a bouncer during the course of a night are also being described as based on experience rather than just personality.

===Use of force===

Movies often depict bouncers physically throwing patrons out of clubs and restraining drunk customers with headlocks, which has led to a popular misconception that bouncers have (or reserve) the right to use physical force freely. However, in many countries bouncers have no legal authority to use physical force more freely than any other civilian—meaning they are restricted to reasonable levels of force used in self defense, to eject drunk or aggressive patrons refusing to leave a venue, or when restraining a patron who has committed an offence until police arrive. Lawsuits are possible if injuries occur, even if the patron was drunk or using aggressive language.

In The United Kingdom, the definition of an assault is very particularly defined. Door supervisors may have to use physical force in the course of their duties. Such force must be no more than is reasonable and necessary (the minimum force necessary). If deemed otherwise they may be liable for assault charges, otherwise, if it is deemed reasonable proportionate and necessary to the threat faced - the door supervisor will not face any charges.

With civil liability and court costs related to the use of force as &quot;the highest preventable loss found within the industry...&quot; (US) and bars being &quot;sued more often for using unnecessary or excessive force than for any other reason&quot; (Canada), substantial costs may be incurred by indiscriminate violence against patrons—though this depends heavily on the laws and customs of the country. In Australia, the number of complaints and lawsuits against venues due to the behaviour of their bouncers has been credited with turning many establishments to using former police officers to head their in-house security, instead of hiring private firms. In 2007, a bouncer firm in Toronto stated that a major issue for his bouncers is the risk of being charged with assault if a patron is injured because bouncers are dealing with a fight. The concerns about being charged by police may make bouncers reticent to call the police after they break up a bar fight. Lee Vineyard states that judges tend to be prejudiced against bouncers if there are injuries to patrons after bouncers break up a bar fight; as such, he recommends restraint in all bouncer actions, even if the bouncer is defending him or herself from a patron.

According to statistical research in Canada, bouncers are as likely to face physical violence in their work as urban-area police officers. The research also found that the likelihood of such encounters increased (with statistical significance) with the number of years the bouncer had worked in his occupation. Despite popular misconceptions, bouncers in Western countries are normally unarmed. Some bouncers may carry weapons such as expandable batons for personal protection, but they may not have a legal right to carry a weapon even if they would prefer to do so. An article from 2007 about bouncers in Toronto (Canada) stated that a major security firm instructs its bouncers to buy bulletproof vests, as they have to deal with armed patrons on a nightly basis. Bouncers also face patrons armed with brass knuckles, screwdrivers, and improvised weapons such as broken bottles.

Lee Vineyard recommends that bouncers be provided with uniforms by the club, so that patrons can identify the bouncers. During a fight in a bar, if the bouncers are un-uniformed as they approach the altercation, the fighting patrons may believe that the bouncers who are intervening are other fighting patrons, rather than security staff.

===Other approaches===

Use of force training programs teach bouncers ways to avoid using force and explain what types of force are considered allowable by the courts. Some bars have gone so far as to institute policies barring physical contact, where bouncers are instructed to ask a drunk or disorderly patron to leave—if the patron refuses, the bouncers call police. However, if the police are called too frequently, it can reflect badly on the venue upon renewal of its liquor licence.

Another strategy used in some bars is to hire smaller, less threatening or female bouncers, because they may be better able to defuse conflicts than large, intimidating bouncers. The more &#x27;impressive&#x27; bouncers, in the often tense environments they are supposed to supervise, are also often challenged by aggressive males wanting to prove their machismo. Large and intimidating bouncers, whilst providing an appearance of strong security, may also drive customers away in cases where a more relaxed environment is desired. In addition, female security staff, apart from having fewer problems searching female patrons for drugs or weapons and entering women&#x27;s washrooms to check for illegal activities, are also considered as better able to deal with drunk or aggressive women.

In Australia, for example, women comprise almost 20% of the security industry and increasingly work the door as well, using &quot;a smile, chat and a friendly but firm demeanor&quot; to resolve tense situations. Nearly one in nine of Britain&#x27;s nightclub bouncers are also women, with the UK&#x27;s 2003 Licensing Act giving the authorities &quot;discretionary power to withhold a venue&#x27;s licence if it does not employ female door staff&quot;. This is credited with having &quot;opened the door for women to enter the profession&quot;. However, female bouncers are still a rarity in many countries, such as in India, where two women who became media celebrities in 2008 for being &quot;Punjab&#x27;s first female bouncers&quot; were soon sacked again after accusations of unbecoming behaviour.

The Victoria Event Center has hired a sexual health educator/intimacy coach who acts as a type of bouncer called a &quot;consent captain&quot;. The consent captain monitors bar patrons to stop sexual harassment and sexual assault at social activities at venues and bars. The consent captain intervenes if she sees people who are getting stared at, harassed, or touched without sexual consent. She talks to the person who is feeling uncomfortable and then, if the first person agrees, speaks to the individual whose conduct is unwanted. Like a regular bouncer, the consent captain warns the person engaging in unwanted behavior that those acts are not tolerated in the venue; if the unwanted acts continue, she may &quot;eventually ask them to leave&quot;. The consent captain also checks on people who are intoxicated, to prevent people from taking advantage of their impaired state. Since the consent captain is, in this case, a sexual health educator, she is better able to notice risk situations regarding consent and harassment that regular bouncers might not notice.

==Regulation and training==
In many countries, a bouncer must be licensed and lacking a criminal record to gain employment within the security/crowd control sector. In some countries or regions, bouncers may be required to have extra skills or special licenses and certification for first aid, alcohol distribution, crowd control, or fire safety.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, &quot;door supervisors&quot;—as they are termed—must hold a door supervisor licence from the Security Industry Authority. The training for a door supervisor licence takes 52 hours since the current changes were implemented on 1 December 2022. The training includes subjects such as:

* access and egress control
* communication and de-escalation of conflict
* first aid
* health and safety in the workplace
* law
* monitoring systems
* patrolling
* post-conflict matters
* principles of conflict management
* principles of effective communication and customer care
* principles of fire safety
* private security industry
* problem solving strategies
* relevant legislation
* reporting and record keeping
* risk
* role of security officer within private industry
* searching persons and their property
* terrorism

Licenses must be renewed every three years, and as of 2023, additional license-linked training &quot;must&quot; be taken.

Licensed door supervisors must wear the licence (often worn on the upper arm) whilst on duty. This led to the common misconception that door supervisors are legally obliged to show their ID to members of the public upon request; in reality, in order to protect their identities from aggressive clients they only have to present ID to police and licensing authorities. The 2010 UK quango reforms includes the SIA amongst many other quangos the coalition government intended to be disbanded, ostensibly on the overall grounds of cost, despite the SIA being essentially self-funding via licence payments.

===Australia===

In Australia, bouncers are required to be legally licensed as crowd controllers. Licensing varies across the states and territories, and a crowd controller needs to apply under the Mutual Recognition Scheme to work in another state, having their license formally recognised by the state they wish to work in. In Queensland, these licenses require the undertaking of a security provider course, which teaches the licensee techniques in physical restraints, use of force, conflict negotiation and deescalation, first-aid and CPR, and details the legal requirements and obligations of the crowd controller.

===Canada===
In Canada, bouncers have the right to use reasonable force to expel intoxicated or aggressive patrons. First, the patron must be asked to leave the premises. If the patron refuses to leave, the bouncer can use reasonable force to expel the patron. This guideline has been upheld in a number of court cases. Under the definition of &#x27;reasonable force&#x27;, &quot;it is perfectly acceptable [for the bouncer] to grab a patron’s arm to remove the patron from the premises&quot;. However, &quot;Only in situations where employees reasonably believe that the conduct of the patron puts them in danger can they inflict harm on a patron and then only to the extent that such force is necessary for self defence&quot;.

In the Newfoundland and Labrador capital of Saint John&#x27;s, certification of doormen is voluntary. Some establishments require a &quot;doorman&#x27;s certificate&quot;, provided by the St. Johns Fire Department, that deals with Fire Code. This process requires answering test questions that apply to fire code for the most part, and a basic understanding of the criminal code as it applies to drug use and the use of force. It does not cover the Use of Force Model for all Canadian citizens. including law enforcement, which states that an assault is considered a crime covered by &quot;citizens arrest&quot; under Canadian law. Other municipalities in the province have no training. Municipal or provincial governance does not exist at the time of this publishing.

In British Columbia, door staff security (bouncers) are required to become certified under the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General Office. The course called BST (Basic Security Training) is a 40-hour program that covers law, customer service, and other issue related to security operation.

In Alberta, bar and nightclub security staff will have to take a new, government-run training course on correct bouncer behaviour and skills before the end of 2008. The six-hour &#x27;ProTect&#x27; course will, among other subjects, teach staff to identify conflicts before they become violent, and how to defuse situations without resorting to force.

In Ontario, courts have ruled that &quot;a tavern owes a twofold duty of care to its patrons. It must ensure that it does not serve alcohol which would apparently intoxicate or increase the patron&#x27;s intoxication. Further, it must take positive steps to protect patrons and others from the dangers of intoxication&quot;. Regarding the second requirement of protecting patrons, the law holds that &quot;customers cannot be ejected from your premises if doing so would put them in danger [e.g., due to the patron&#x27;s intoxication]. Bars can be held liable for ejecting a customer who they know, or should know, is at risk of injury by being ejected.&quot;

In Ontario, bartenders and servers must complete the Smart Serve Training Program, which teaches them to recognise the signs of intoxication. The Smart Serve program is also recommended for other staff in bars who have contact with potentially intoxicated patrons, such as bouncers, coat check staff, and valets. The Smart Serve certification program encourages bars to keep Incident Reporting Logs, to use as evidence if an incident goes to court. With the August 2007 &quot;Private Security and Investigative Services Act&quot;, Ontario law also requires security industry workers, including bouncers, to be licensed.

Nova Scotia passed a law in 2010 requiring bouncers to be trained and licensed, but the province has never adopted detailed regulations and proclaimed the legislation into effect.

===Germany===
In Germany, doormen may – like any other citizen – defend themselves in self-defense situations using physical force, but they must not interfere with the police work. Their responsibility is limited locally by the property boundaries and content by the personal rights of the guests. Specifically, this means that they can not enforce a person control or search for people. Such on-the-spot checks are always voluntary, but a criterion for entry. Bouncers own like every other the right to detain under § 127 StPO. In addition, the guards are usually also &quot;possessor&quot; of the security object, which led to many racism-related issues regarding the entry of foreign customers.

However, bouncers at discotheques, who work for a security company or are self-employed, have to take a so-called () with the responsible . This is prescribed in § 34 (a) of the Industrial Code. The certificate issued by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce after passing the exam is colloquially called &quot;bouncer certificate&quot; or simply &quot;certificate&quot; or &quot;34 a&quot;. The exam consists of a written part with multiple-choice questions and an oral part. The latter can be repeated at a reduced price if it does not exist. Currently, the number of retry attempts is not limited. The costs for the examination depending on IHK location between 150 and 190 euros.

===Italy===
In Italy, the law defines bouncers as &quot;security subsidiary unarmed operator&quot; and they must have specific requisites:
* at least 18 years of age
* no alcohol or drugs in preventive clinical analysis
* mental and physical suitability
* have not been convicted for any intentional crimes
* at least lower high school diploma
* follow a training course

Bouncers must not have ownership of any type of firearm during their service even if they have a valid firearms license.

===The Netherlands===
In the Netherlands doormen (portiers) and bouncers (uitsmijters) are 2 different specialties. Doormen are mostly seen as concierges and have primary tasks involving hospitality, such as greeting customers, providing services, supporting customer needs and some security tasks. However, bouncers are required, since 1999 by law (Beveiliging en bewaking WPBR) to be in possession of a specialized diploma (SVH Diploma Horecaportier). The course contains both theoretical and practical training and exams and can only be entered if the subject does not have a criminal record, which will be checked by a screening by Police departments in the region where the company is located. Also, this background check is repeated every 3 years, after which a renewed Security ID will be handed to the subject. With this ID, the subject is allowed to work as a bouncer. In case he/she doesn&#x27;t have this ID on his/her person at work, he/she will be liable for a fine, which will be written by a department of the Police, called Bijzondere Wetten. Not only will the bouncer be charged, but also the company. Because of the relatively strong bar-, club- and catering industry in the Netherlands, bouncers are necessary to act as host, problem solver and mediator. They are mainly tasked with preventive searches and checks, supervision of customers, keeping out drugs and weapons and maintaining a safe atmosphere in the premises.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, as of 2011, bouncers are required to have a COA (Certificate of approval). Like other security work, the person who has the COA has been vetted by the police and cleared through security checks, as well as the courts, to show the person is suitable for the job, and knows New Zealand law to prevent Security Officers going to court for using excessive force and assault on patrons.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland all potential doormen (bouncers) must complete a QQI level 4 course in Door Security Procedures. This allows them to apply for a PSA license (Private Security Authority). The PSA vet all applicants before issuing a license. Some past convictions will disqualify an applicant from working in the security industry. The license issued by the PSA entitles the holder of the license to work on pubs, clubs and event security. The PSA now requires a person to have a license to work in Event Security.

===Singapore===
Singapore requires all bouncers to undergo a background check and attend a 5-day &#x27;National Skills Recognition System&#x27; course for security staff. However, many of the more professional security companies (and larger venues with their own dedicated security staff) have noted that the course is insufficient for the specific requirements of a bouncer and provide their own additional training.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, there are special security officers referred to as Ordningsvakt with limited policing duties who share the use of force monopoly with the police, thus having more or less the same obligations as the police to report crime and intervene when on duty. They are trained and ordained by the Swedish Police Authority to maintain and enforce public order at venues or areas where the police cannot permanently divert resources to enforce public order themselves. These security officers have powers of citizen&#x27;s arrest and to verbally dismiss, physically remove, or detain those who disturb or pose an immediate threat to public order or safety, by using a reasonable amount of force. They can also detain or otherwise take into custody those who are drunk and disorderly and turn them over to police custody as soon as possible. An &quot;Ordningsvakt&quot; is recruited by the police and must go through a battery of physical tests, a language test, and an interview board before going through a two-week training program which teaches behaviour, conflict management, criminal law, physical intervention, the use of telescopic batons and handcuffs, first aid, equal opportunities and discrimination, and arrest procedures. He or she must then be re-certified every three years. At the end of each shift, a written shift report must always be submitted to the police.

An &quot;Ordningsvakt&quot; is either employed by a private security company, such as Securitas AB or G4S, where they commonly work at shopping malls, hospitals, public transportation, or as privateers employed by bar or nightclub owners. But despite employment, their first and foremost loyalty lies with the police, who manage and supervise them in the field. They can also be used to augment the police at football matches and high-risk football derbies (after receiving special training). An Ordningsvakt is required to wear a special uniform, which is similar to that of a police officer, but made out of a brighter blue colour and with slightly different emblems so they are easily identified as an Ordningsvakt but also make their connection to the police as obvious as possible. Some security officers are allowed to carry firearms, but this is rare. While on duty, an Ordningsvakt, just like a police officer, is regarded as a public servant, and an assault or threats against one will be punished more harshly. A lawful order given by an Ordningsvakt must be obeyed; otherwise, physical force may be used to enforce that order. Resisting at this point is illegal and punishable by prison.

===United States===

Requirements for bouncers vary from state to state, with some examples being:

====California====
In California, Senate Bill 194 requires any bouncer or security guard to be registered with the State of California Department of Consumer Affairs Bureau of Security and Investigative Services. These guards must also complete a criminal background check, including submitting their fingerprints to the California Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Californians must undertake the &quot;Skills Training Course for Security Guards&quot; before receiving a security licence. Further courses allow for qualified security personnel to carry batons upon completion of training.
Exempted from the Act are peace officers in specified circumstances and guards employed exclusively and regularly by any employer who does not provide contract security services (known as proprietary guards), provided they do not carry or use any deadly weapon in the performance of their duties.

====New York====
In New York State, it is illegal for a bar owner to knowingly hire a felon for a bouncer position. Under Article 7 General Business Law, bars and nightclubs are not allowed to hire bouncers without a proper license.

New York State licensed security guards must take one 8 hour course by a licensed instructor and be fingerprinted prior to starting work. Once this is done the security packet must be mailed to the state and that bouncer is “pending”. License should take 3–6 weeks to process. Security guards may work while they are “pending”. Licenses are valid for 2 years and all guards must take the 16 hour on the job training before renewal. Under New York state law only a Private Investigator or watch, guard and patrol agency can supply security guards/bouncers to bars.

==Notable examples==
The list of notable bouncers includes celebrities and historical figures who worked as bouncers, often before coming to fame in another field or profession. A number of these bouncers were wrestlers (e.g., Dave Bautista, Road Warrior Animal, Rob Terry, Giant Haystacks and Rick Rude). Some, including Bautista, are also actors (e.g., Mr. T, Vin Diesel and Marcus Hauz). Pope Francis worked as a nightclub bouncer in Buenos Aires while a university student.

==Ants==
Some types of ant species have evolved a sub-specialisation that has been called a &quot;bouncer&quot;, and performs a similar function (throwing intruders outside) for its fellows. The majors of the Australian &quot;Orectognathus versicolor&quot; ants have massive blunt mandible jaws which are of little use to the prey-capture techniques this trap jaw species normally engages in. Instead, they spend much of their time guarding the nest opening, their jaws cocked. When foreign ants venture close, the force of the mandibles is sufficient to throw back the intruder for a significant distance, a defense behaviour which is thought to also protect the guard against physical or chemical injury that it might sustain in more direct battle.

<doc id="889160" wikidata="Q5374276" url="?curid=889160" title="Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974">
<text>The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (, codified in part at ) is a U.S. federal tax and labor law that establishes minimum standards for pension plans in private industry. It contains rules on the federal income tax effects of transactions associated with employee benefit plans. ERISA was enacted to protect the interests of employee benefit plan participants and their beneficiaries by:
* Requiring the disclosure of financial and other information concerning the plan to beneficiaries; 
* Establishing standards of conduct for plan fiduciaries; 
* Providing for appropriate remedies and access to the federal courts.

ERISA is sometimes used to refer to the full body of laws that regulate employee benefit plans, which are mainly in the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA itself.

Responsibility for interpretation and enforcement of ERISA is divided among the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury (particularly the Internal Revenue Service), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

==History==
In 1961, U.S. President John F. Kennedy created the President&#x27;s Committee on Corporate Pension Plans. The movement for pension reform gained some momentum when the Studebaker Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, closed its plant in 1963. Its pension plan was so poorly funded that Studebaker could not afford to provide all employees with their pensions. The company created a program in which 3,600 workers who had reached the retirement age of 60 received full pension benefits, 4,000 workers aged 40–59 who had ten years with Studebaker received lump sum payments valued at roughly 15% of the actuarial value of their pension benefits, and the remaining 2,900 workers received no pensions.

In 1963, Senator John L. McClellan (D) of Arkansas began an investigation through the Permanent Investigations Senate Subcommittee into labor leader George Barasch, alleging misuse and diversion of $4,000,000 of union benefit funds. After three years the investigation had failed to find any wrongdoing, but had resulted in several proposed laws, including McClellan&#x27;s October 12, 1965 bill setting new fiduciary standards for plan trustees. Additionally, due much in part to his &quot;dismay&quot; over Barasch&#x27;s sole control over union benefit plan funds, Senator Jacob K. Javits (R) of New York also introduced bills in 1965 and 1967 increasing regulation of welfare and pension funds to limit the control of plan trustees and administrators and to address the funding, vesting, reporting, and disclosure issues identified by the presidential committee. His bills were opposed by business groups and labor unions, which sought to retain the flexibility they enjoyed under pre-ERISA law. Provisions from all three bills ultimately evolved into the guidelines enacted in ERISA.

On September 12, 1972, NBC broadcast an hour-long television special, &quot;Pensions: The Broken Promise&quot;, that showed millions of Americans the consequences of poorly funded pension plans and onerous vesting requirements. In the following years, Congress held a series of public hearings on pension issues and public support for pension reform grew significantly.

ERISA was enacted in 1974 and signed into law by President Gerald Ford on September 2, 1974, Labor Day. In the years since 1974, ERISA has been amended repeatedly.

==Coverage==
===Pension plans===
ERISA does not require employers to establish pension plans. Likewise, as a general rule, it does not require that plans provide a minimum level of benefits. Instead, it regulates the operation of a pension plan once it has been established.

Under ERISA, pension plans must provide for vesting of employees&#x27; pension benefits after a specified minimum number of years. ERISA requires that the employers who sponsor plans satisfy certain minimum funding requirements.

ERISA also regulates the manner in which a pension plan may pay benefits. For example, a defined benefit plan must pay a married participant&#x27;s pension as a &quot;joint-and-survivor annuity&quot; that provides continuing benefits to the surviving spouse unless both the participant and the spouse waive the survivor coverage.

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was established by ERISA to provide coverage in the event that a terminated defined benefit pension plan does not have sufficient assets to provide the benefits earned by participants. Later amendments to ERISA require an employer who withdraws from participation in a multiemployer pension plan with insufficient assets to pay all participants&#x27; vested benefits to contribute the &quot;&quot; share of the plan&#x27;s unfunded vested benefits liability.

There are two main types of pension plans: defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plans provide retirees with a certain level of benefits based on years of service, salary and other factors. Defined contribution plans provide retirees with benefits based on the amount and investment performance of contributions made by the employee and/or employer over a number of years.

===Health benefit plans===

Likewise, ERISA does not require that an employer provide health insurance to its employees or retirees, but it regulates the operation of a health benefit plan if an employer chooses to establish one.

ERISA exempts health insurance plans from various state-specific laws, particularly contract and tort law, to create federal uniformity; , about 60% of insured employees in the US were in self-funded plans subject to ERISA. ERISA has led to tension with reforms which partner with the states, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

There have been several significant amendments to ERISA concerning health benefit plans:
* The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) provides some employees and beneficiaries with the right to continue their coverage under an employer-sponsored group health benefit plan for a limited time after the occurrence of certain events that would otherwise cause termination of such coverage, such as the loss of employment.
* The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits a health benefit plan from refusing to cover an employee&#x27;s pre-existing medical conditions in some circumstances. It also bars health benefit plans from certain types of discrimination on the basis of health status, genetic information, or disability.

Other relevant amendments to ERISA include the Newborns&#x27; and Mothers&#x27; Health Protection Act, the Mental Health Parity Act, and the Women&#x27;s Health and Cancer Rights Act.

During the 1990s and 2000s, many employers who promised lifetime health coverage to their retirees limited or eliminated those benefits. ERISA does not provide for vesting of health care benefits in the way that employees become vested in their accrued pension benefits. Employees and retirees who were promised lifetime health coverage may be able to enforce those promises by suing the employer for breach of contract, or by challenging the right of the health benefit plan to change its plan documents to eliminate promised benefits.

==Pension vesting==
Before ERISA, some defined benefit pension plans required decades of service before an employee&#x27;s benefit became vested. It was not unusual for a plan to provide no benefit at all to an employee who left employment before the specified retirement age (e.g. 65), regardless of the length of the employee&#x27;s service.

Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, employer contributions made after 2006 to a defined contribution plan must become vested at 100% after three years or under a 2nd-6th year gradual-vesting schedule (20% per year beginning with the second year of service, i.e. 100% after six years). (ref. 120 Stat. 988 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006.) The Technical Explanation of H.R.4, of the PPA, Page 156 Vesting Rules, states that the PPA amends both the ERISA and Code. Different rules apply with respect to employer contributions made before 2007. Employee contributions are always 100% vested. Accrued benefits under a defined benefit plan must become vested at 100% after five years or under a 3rd-7th year gradual vesting schedule (20% per year beginning with the third year of vesting service, and 100% after seven years). (ref. 26 U.S.C. 411(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. 203(a)(2).)

==Pension funding==
ERISA established minimum funding requirements for pension plans, which includes defined benefit plans and money purchase plans but not profit sharing or stock bonus plans.

Before the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), a defined benefit plan maintained a &quot;funding standard account&quot;, which was charged annually for the cost of benefits earned during the year and credited for employer contributions. Increases in the plan&#x27;s liabilities due to benefit improvements, changes in actuarial assumptions, and any other reasons were amortized and charged to the account; decreases in the plan&#x27;s liabilities were amortized and credited to the account. Every year, the employer was required to contribute the amount necessary to keep the funding standard account from falling below $0 at year-end.

In 2008, when the PPA funding rules went into effect, single-employer pension plans no longer maintain funding standard accounts. The funding requirement under PPA is simply that a plan must stay fully funded (that is, its assets must equal or exceed its liabilities). If a plan is fully funded, the minimum required contribution is the cost of benefits earned during the year. If a plan is not fully funded, the contribution also includes the amount necessary to amortize over seven years the difference between its liabilities and its assets. Stricter rules apply to severely underfunded plans (called &quot;at-risk status&quot;).

The PPA has different funding requirements for multiemployer pension plans, which preserve most of the pre-PPA funding rules, including the funding standard account. Under PPA, increases and decreases in the plan&#x27;s liabilities are amortized, but the amortization period for benefit improvements adopted after 2007 are shortened. As with single-employer plans, multiemployer pension plans that are significantly underfunded are subject to restrictions. The restrictions, which may limit the plan&#x27;s ability to improve benefits or require the plan to reduce employees&#x27; benefits, vary depending whether a pension plan&#x27;s funding status is termed &quot;endangered&quot;, &quot;seriously endangered&quot;, or &quot;critical&quot;. The restrictions accompanying each deficient funding status are progressively more severe as funding status worsens.

==ERISA preemption==
ERISA Section 514 preempts all state laws that &quot;relate to any employee benefit plan&quot;, with certain, enumerated exceptions. The most important exceptions (i.e., state laws that survive despite the fact that they may &quot;relate to&quot; an employee benefit plan) are state insurance, banking, or securities laws, generally applicable criminal laws, and domestic relations orders that meet ERISA&#x27;s qualification requirements. ERISA also does not govern public pension funds, but it is often looked to for guidance regarding fund duties in addition to state pension codes.

A major limitation is placed on the insurance exception, known as the &quot;deemer clause&quot;, which essentially provides that state insurance law cannot operate on employer self-funded benefit plans. The Supreme Court has created another limitation on the insurance exception, in which even a law that regulates insurance is preempted if it purports to add a remedy to a participant or beneficiary in an employee benefit plan that ERISA did not explicitly provide.

A three-part analysis is used to decide whether ERISA preempts state law. First, preemption is presumed if the state law &quot;relates to&quot; any employee benefit plan. Second, a state law relating to an employee benefit plan may be protected from preemption under ERISA if it regulates insurance, banking, or securities. The third step of the ERISA preemption analysis concerns the &quot;deemer&quot; clause. State insurance regulation may be saved only to the extent that it regulates genuine insurance companies or insurance contracts. As a result, a state may not &quot;deem&quot; that an employee benefit plan is an insurance plan in an effort to sidestep preemption if the benefit plan would not otherwise meet the requirements as an insurance company or contract. The &quot;deemer&quot; clause therefore restricts the use of the &quot;savings&quot; clause to conventionally insured employee benefit plans.

The result of ERISA preemption is that the only remedy available to a covered person who has been denied benefits or dropped from coverage altogether is to seek an order from a federal judge (no jury trial is permitted) directing the Plan (in actuality the insurance company that underwrites and administers it) to pay for &quot;medically necessary&quot; care. If a person dies before the case can be heard, however, the claim dies with him or her, since ERISA provides no remedy for injury or wrongful death caused by the withholding of care.

Even if benefits are improperly denied, the insurance company cannot be sued for any resulting injury or wrongful death, regardless of whether it acted in bad faith in denying benefits. Insurers operating ERISA plans enjoy several immunities not available to other types of insurance companies. ERISA preempts &quot;all&quot; conflicting state laws, including state statutes prohibiting unfair claims practices and causes of action arising under state common law for insurance bad faith. There is no right to a jury trial in ERISA benefits actions. Although Americans normally take for granted the right to testify on their behalf, plaintiffs have no right to present live testimony in ERISA bench trials, in which the judge simply reads through the documents that formed the record originally before the ERISA plan administrator and performs &quot;de novo&quot; review. Finally, punitive damages are not allowed in actions for ERISA benefits.

It has been argued that in the case of health benefits, the effect of all of this may paradoxically have been to leave plan participants worse off than if ERISA had not been enacted.

Many persons included among the some 29 million people presently without health care coverage in the United States are former ERISA &quot;subscribers&quot;, insurance terminology for Plan beneficiaries, who have been denied benefits--usually on the ground that the prescribed care is not medically necessary or is &quot;experimental&quot;--or dropped from coverage, often because they have lost their jobs due to the very illness for which care was denied.

Many consumer and health care advocates have called for a &quot;restoration of the freedom of contract enforcement,&quot; to the 75% of Americans insured under these work place group plans-in effect, a repeal of the ERISA preemption. Permitting these insured persons access to customary state remedies (98% of all civil disputes are resolved in state courts) would, they contend, result in a substantial reduction in arbitrary denial of care benefits, simultaneously alleviating a major burden on state Medicaid systems and clogged federal court dockets.

===Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act exemption===
ERISA contains an exemption specifically regarding the Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act (Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 393), which was enacted by that state a few months before ERISA was signed into law. As a result, private employers in Hawaii are bound by the rules of that state law in addition to ERISA. The exemption also freezes the law in its original 1974 form, meaning the Hawaii legislature is not able to make non-administrative amendments without Congressional approval.

==Statute==
===Title I: Protection of Employee Benefit Rights===

Title I protects employees&#x27; rights to their benefits. The following are some of the ways in which it achieves that goal:
* Participants must be provided plan summaries.
* Employers are required to report information about the plan to the Labor Department and provide it to participants upon request. The information is reported on Form 5500, which is available for public inspection. 
* If a participant requests, the employer must provide the participant with a calculation of her or his accrued and vested pension benefits.
* Employers have fiduciary responsibility to the participants and to the plan.
* Certain service providers, such as investment managers, have fiduciary responsibilities to the plan. 
* Certain transactions between the employer and the plan are prohibited.
* Certain transactions between fiduciary and the plan, or between the plan and certain &quot;parties in interest&quot; are prohibited (unless otherwise exempt).
* A pension plan is barred from investing more than 10% of its assets in employer securities.

Title I also includes the pension funding and vesting rules described above.

The United States Department of Labor&#x27;s Employee Benefits Security Administration (&quot;EBSA&quot;) is responsible for overseeing Title I, promulgating regulations implementing and interpreting the statute as well as conducting enforcement. Plan fiduciaries and plan participants may also bring certain civil causes of action in Federal Court.

===Title II: Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code Relating to Retirement Plans===

Title II amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The changes include the following:
* Addition of various requirements for a pension plan to be tax-favored (&quot;qualified&quot;), including:
** The plan must offer retirees the option of a joint-and-survivor annuity
** Plan benefits may not discriminate in favor of officers and highly paid employees
** Plans are subject to the pension funding and vesting rules described above.
* Imposition of maximum limits on the annual benefit that may be paid from a qualified defined benefit pension plan and the annual contribution that may be made to a qualified defined contribution pension plan
* The creation of individual retirement accounts (IRAs).
* Revision of rules concerning the maximum tax deduction allowed with respect to a contribution to a pension plan
* Imposition of an excise tax if the employer fails to make a required contribution to a pension plan or engages in transactions prohibited by ERISA

===Title III: Jurisdiction, Administration, Enforcement; Joint Pension Task Force, Etc.===

Title III outlines procedures for co-ordination between the Labor and Treasury Departments in enforcing ERISA.

It also created the Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries, which licenses actuaries to perform a variety of actuarial tasks required of pension plans under ERISA. The Joint Board administers two examinations to prospective Enrolled Actuaries. After an individual passes the two exams and completes sufficient relevant professional experience, she or he becomes an Enrolled Actuary.

===Title IV: Plan Termination Insurance===
Title IV created the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to insure benefits of participants in underfunded terminated plans. It also describes the procedures that a pension plan must follow to terminate itself, and for the PBGC to initiate an involuntary termination.

====Single-employer plans====
=====Standard termination=====
An employer may terminate a single-employer plan under a standard termination if the plan&#x27;s assets equal or exceed its liabilities. If the assets are less than the liabilities, the employer must contribute the amount necessary to fully fund the plan. A standard termination is sometimes referred to as a voluntary termination because the employer has chosen to terminate the plan.

In a standard termination, all accrued benefits under the plan become 100% vested. The plan must purchase annuity contracts for all participants. If the plan permits the payment of lump sums, employees may be offered the choice of a lump sum payment or an annuity.

If any assets remain in the plan after a standard termination has been completed, the provisions of the plan control their treatment. In some plans, the excess assets revert to the employer; in other plans, the excess assets must be used to increase participants&#x27; benefits.

=====Distress termination=====
An employer may terminate a single-employer plan under a distress termination if the employer demonstrates to the PBGC that one of these conditions exists:
* Employer faces liquidation under bankruptcy proceedings.
* Costs of continuing the plan will make the business fail.
* Costs of continuing the plan have become unreasonably burdensome solely because of a decline in the employer&#x27;s workforce.

If the PBGC finds that a distress termination is appropriate, the plan&#x27;s liabilities are calculated and compared with its assets. Depending on the difference between the two values, the termination may be treated as if it had been a standard termination or as if it had been initiated by the PBGC.

=====Termination initiated by the PBGC=====
PBGC may initiate proceedings to terminate a single-employer plan if it determines one of the following:
* The employer has not made its minimum required contributions to the plan.
* The plan will not be able to pay benefits when due.
* PBGC&#x27;s long-term cost can be expected to be unreasonably higher if it does not terminate the plan.

A termination initiated by the PBGC is sometimes called an &quot;involuntary termination&quot;.

The benefits paid by the PBGC after a plan termination may be less than those promised by the employer. See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for details.

====Multiemployer plans====
A multiemployer plan may be terminated in one of three ways:
* It may be amended so that participants receive no credit for future service.
* All contributing employers may withdraw from the plan or stop making contributions to it.
* It may convert into a defined contribution plan.

==Non-ERISA status and bankruptcy==
In 2005, the BAPCPA amended the Bankruptcy Code, by exempting most organized retirement plans, even those not subject to ERISA, and accorded them protected status, claimable as exempt property by a debtor declaring bankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Now, most pension plans have the same protection as an ERISA anti-alienation clause giving these pensions the same protection as a spendthrift trust. The only remaining unprotected areas are the SIMPLE IRA and the SEP IRA. The SEP IRA is functionally similar to a self-settle trust, and a sound policy reason would exist to not shield SEP IRAs, but many financial planners argue that a rollover (or direct transfer) from a SEP IRA to a &quot;rollover IRA&quot; would give those funds protected status, too.

==Finding statutes==
Portions of ERISA are codified in various places of the United States Code, including , and Internal Revenue Code sections and (relating to the Individual Retirement Account) and sections through , and , and .

<text>Tyler Christopher Baker (November 11, 1972 – October 31, 2023) was an American actor. He was best known for his roles as Nikolas Cassadine (1996–1999, 2003–2011, 2013–2016) and Connor Bishop (2004–2005) on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

In August 2016, it was announced that Christopher would be joining the cast of the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as the son of long-time villains Stefano DiMera and Vivian Alamain. His tenure on the show began December 29, 2017. Christopher left the series on March 20, 2019.

==Early life==
Tyler Christopher Baker was born in the Chicago suburb of Joliet, Illinois, on November 11, 1972, to Jim and Jimi-Ann Baker and grew up in Delaware, Ohio, the youngest of four children. Though his parents believed they had Native American heritage, a DNA test taken by his father and sister showed no Native American ancestry.

Christopher attended Ohio Wesleyan University for two years.

==Career==
In 1993, Christopher — then credited as Tyler Baker — auditioned for the role of Stone Cates for the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;; the role was later cast with actor Michael Sutton. In April 1996, Christopher was cast in the role of Nikolas Cassadine for the serial; he signed a three-year deal and filmed his first scenes in late June 1996. In June 1999, it was announced that Christopher opted not to renew his deal with the soap opera. Following his daytime departure, Christopher made guest appearances on primetime shows including &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Felicity&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. In March 2003, it was announced that Christopher would return to &quot;General Hospital&quot;; then-executive producer Jill Farren Phelps described Christopher&#x27;s return as an opportunity the serial could not pass up.

In March 2011, &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; reported on their social media accounts that Christopher had been let go from the serial, because of his casting on ABC Family&#x27;s &quot;The Lying Game&quot;, produced by former &quot;General Hospital&quot; head writer Charles Pratt Jr. Christopher verified the reports of his firing to &quot;ABC Soaps In Depth&quot;; he explained that he had been released from his deal on Friday March 18, 2011, and the character of Nikolas was to be written out. Christopher&#x27;s deal was set to expire in June and the date would have marked the beginning of the last 13 week-cycle period in his deal—at which time the network would notify the actor of their decision to offer another deal. While Christopher had previously admitted he was unsure about renewing his deal, he was open to working both shows and thought it was a likely possibility considering they were both under ABC. Christopher last appeared on June 30, 2011; he later returned for a three-day guest appearance from July 27 to July 30, 2011.

In March 2013, Christopher returned in a recurring capacity at &quot;General Hospital&quot;, while continuing to appear on &quot;The Lying Game&quot;. In June 2013, it was announced that Christopher had signed a deal to appear on a regular basis on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. The following month, it was announced that &quot;The Lying Game&quot; had been canceled after two seasons. In May 2016, actor Nick Stabile was temporarily cast in the role of Nikolas, with Christopher being unavailable, for an undisclosed amount of time. In September 2016, &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; reported that negotiations between Christopher and the serial had fallen apart, and that he would not be reprising his portrayal of Nikolas. Christopher made his last appearance on June 16, 2016.

In August 2017, it was announced that Christopher had joined the cast of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in a newly created role. Christopher previously made a one-episode guest appearance on the soap in 2001. He made his first appearance as Stefan DiMera on December 29, 2017. His last episode was March 20, 2019.

==Personal life==
Christopher was married to Eva Longoria from 2002 to 2004. He was previously engaged to &quot;General Hospital&quot; co-star Vanessa Marcil and dated Natalia Livingston. He and auto racing reporter Brienne Pedigo publicly announced their engagement in October 2006; Christopher and Pedigo married September 27, 2008. The couple had their first child, a son, on October 3, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;GH&#x27;s Tyler Christopher/&quot;&gt;Fit for a Prince&quot;. &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;. July 22, 2013. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, it was announced that Christopher and his wife were expecting their second child, due in May 2015. On May 3, 2015, Christopher announced on his official Twitter feed that Brienne Pedigo had given birth to a baby girl. Brienne Pedigo filed for divorce in February 2019.

In later years of his life, Christopher was open about his bipolar disorder and alcoholism. He claimed to have died 3 times in alcohol related instances. In November 2019 while Christopher was going through alcohol withdrawal, he experienced delirium tremens, leading to a fall during which he hit his head on the edge of a bathtub and sustained a traumatic brain injury. He underwent a craniotomy to relieve pressure on his brain.

After recovering from his head injury and ending a medical guardianship under his sister in September 2021, Christopher moved to Hollywood from Ohio to try to find work as an actor where he was homeless for the first six months. Before his death, he was close friends with &quot;General Hospital&quot; co-star Maurice Benard who is also diagnosed with bipolar disorder and gave support to Christopher.

===Legal issues===
On November 11, 2019, Christopher was arrested and charged with public intoxication in Martinsville, Morgan County, Indiana after falling asleep in the back of an Uber car. He pleaded guilty and paid a small fine.

From January 2020 to September 2021, Christopher was placed under the medical guardianship of his sister Susan Asmo Baker following a nearly fatal head injury. After requesting that the guardianship be ended and his sister approving, he filed a lawsuit against her, citing guardianship abuse and alleging that she misused $40,000.

In May 2023, Christopher was arrested on suspicion of public intoxication at the Hollywood Burbank Airport. Police responded to reports of a drunk male and arrived to find him sleeping on the ground near a terminal. He was arrested and fined.

==Death==
On October 31, 2023, 11 days before his 51st birthday, Christopher was found dead. His cause of death was revealed to be positional asphyxia due to acute alcohol intoxication. He was 50 years old.

<doc id="889164" wikidata="Q6618986" url="?curid=889164" title="The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas">
<text>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas is a book by Gertrude Stein, written in October and November 1932 and published in 1933. It employs the form of an autobiography authored by Alice B. Toklas, her life partner. In 1998, Modern Library ranked it as one of the 20 greatest English-language nonfiction books of the 20th century.

==Summary of chapters==
===Before I Came to Paris===
Alice B. Toklas, as narrator of the work, tells how she was born into an affluent family in San Francisco, describing her parents&#x27; backgrounds and family history. Later she describes meeting Gertrude Stein&#x27;s sister-in-law during the fires in the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and decided to move to Paris in 1907.

===My Arrival in Paris===
Alice writes about the important role of Hélène, Gertrude&#x27;s housemaid, in their household in Paris. She mentions preparations for an art exhibition. She discusses Pablo Picasso and his mistress Fernande Olivier. Picasso and Fernande end their relationship, and Fernande moves to Montparnasse to teach French. Alice and Gertrude visit her there.

===Gertrude Stein in Paris, 1903–1907===
Alice tells of Gertrude and her brother Leo Stein buying paintings by Paul Cézanne and Henri Matisse from Ambroise Vollard. They subsequently all become friends. She next discusses spending the summer with Gertrude in Fiesole, Italy, while Picasso goes to Spain. Back in France, Gertrude falls out with Guillaume Apollinaire. Later, Picasso has an argument with Matisse.

===Gertrude Stein Before She Came to Paris===
Alice tells how Gertrude Stein was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, then moved to Vienna, to Passy, and finally to New York City and California. She attended Radcliffe College, where she was taught by William James. She decided to study for a master&#x27;s degree at Johns Hopkins University but dropped out because she was bored, then moved to London and was bored there too, returned to America, and eventually settled in Paris.

===1907–1914===
The episode describes the home at 27 rue de Fleurus, noting the layout of the rooms and studio (atelier). Alice tells stories about Matisse, other artists, and the writer Apollinaire. She recounts holidays in Italy and Spain with Gertrude. Finally, they move to England on the eve of World War I to meet with Gertrude&#x27;s editor, leaving Mildred Aldrich alone in Paris.

===The War===
Gertrude and Alice begin the war years in England, and then go briefly to France to rescue Gertrude&#x27;s writings. They then live in Spain for a while, and eventually move back to France. There, they volunteer for the American Fund for the French Wounded, driving through France to help the wounded and homeless. By the end of the war, Paris seems changed.

===After the War, 1919–1932===
Alice tells of Gertrude&#x27;s argument with T. S. Eliot after he finds one of her writings inappropriate. She talks about her friendship with Sherwood Anderson and Ernest Hemingway, who helped with the publication of &quot;The Making of Americans&quot;. There the couple makes friends with a coterie of Russian artists, but they constitute no artistic movement. Later, Gertrude gives a lecture at Oxford University. Alice then mentions more parties with artists. Later, they abridge &quot;The Making of Americans&quot; to four hundred pages for commercial reasons and devise the idea of writing an autobiography.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Gertrude Stein admitted to writing the work in six weeks with the aim of making money. However, she did not like writing it for that particular reason, and Alice didn&#x27;t think it would be a success. It was the first of Stein&#x27;s writings to be published in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, much to her joy. The magazine published sixty per cent of the book, in four installments.

As for her friends, Carl Van Vechten liked it; Henry McBride thought it was too commercial; Ernest Hemingway called it a &quot;damned pitiful book&quot;; Henri Matisse was offended by the descriptions of his wife; and Georges Braque thought that Stein had misconstrued Cubism. Her brother Leo Stein deemed it a &quot; of lies&quot;. The commercial success that came with her book enabled Stein to live a more prosperous lifestyle.

According to Virgil Thomson, who wrote music to libretti written by Stein, the &quot;book is in every way except actual authorship Alice Toklas&#x27;s book; it reflects her mind, her language, her private view of Gertrude, also her unique narrative powers. Every story in it is told as Alice herself had always told it. ... Every story that ever came into the house eventually got told in Alice&#x27;s way, and this was its definitive version.&quot;

Several critics, including Jeanette Winterson, have noted that in this book Stein created a new literary form, building upon Virginia Woolf&#x27;s fictional biography &quot;Orlando&quot; to make her own reinterpretation of the autobiographical genre.

<doc id="889172" wikidata="Q984194" url="?curid=889172" title="Selective perception">
<text>Selective perception is the tendency not to notice and more quickly forget stimuli that cause emotional discomfort and contradict prior beliefs. For example, a teacher may have a favorite student because they are biased by in-group favoritism. The teacher ignores the student&#x27;s poor attainment. Conversely, they might not notice the progress of their least favorite student. It can also occur when consuming mass media, allowing people to see facts and opinions they like while ignoring those that do not fit with particular opinions, values, beliefs, or frame of reference. Psychologists believe this process occurs automatically.

Selective perception has roots in cognitive psychology, where it is studied as a fundamental part of how individuals filter and process information based on biases, expectations, and past experiences. It is closely related to concepts like confirmation bias—favoring information that aligns with one’s beliefs—and cognitive dissonance, the discomfort of holding conflicting thoughts, both of which shape perception. Its applications extend beyond psychology, playing key roles in marketing (shaping consumer focus), politics (influencing voter perception), and mental health (understanding biases in disorders), highlighting its impact on both individual behaviors and societal trends.

== History ==
The concept of selective perception was established in early psychological studies when researchers began to look at how people select and filter information according to pre-existing beliefs, attitudes, and experiences. The area took its basic grounding in Gestalt psychology, noting the dominant role of cognitive frameworks in perceptual processes during the early 20th century. The concept attracted a great deal of scholarly attention in the mid-20th century as researchers studied its implications for decision-making and communication. The work of Leon Festinger provided a major milestone in the field with his statement of the cognitive dissonance theory in 1957, which went a long way toward explaining selective perception. Festinger argued that when people are exposed to information inconsistent with their already held beliefs, they experience discomfort and are motivated to reduce this dissonance through selected interpretation or perception of information that supports their already existing worldview.

Festinger&#x27;s theory was given empirical support through some brilliant experiments, most notably his study of a UFO doomsday cult, in which participants rationalized their continued beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. This research demonstrated the function of selective perception in reducing cognitive dissonance and thus maintaining consistency in one&#x27;s beliefs. Around the same time, supporting findings were demonstrated through studies by Hastorf and Cantril in the 1954 Princeton-Dartmouth football game experiment, showing how personal allegiances influenced the perception of the same events. The studies established selective perception as one of the key concepts in understanding human cognition—outlining its strong implications for areas like media use, political decision-making, and interpersonal communication.

==Definition==
Selective perception may refer to any number of cognitive biases in psychology related to the way expectations affect perception. Human judgment and decision making is distorted by an array of cognitive, perceptual and motivational biases, and people tend not to recognise their own bias, though they tend to easily recognise (and even overestimate) the operation of bias in human judgment by others. One of the reasons this might occur might be because people are simply bombarded with too much stimuli every day to pay equal attention to everything, therefore, they pick and choose according to their own needs.
==Relevant studies==
To understand when and why a particular region of a scene is selected, studies observed and described the eye movements of individuals as they go about performing specific tasks. In this case, vision was an active process that integrated scene properties with specific, goal-oriented oculomotor behavior.

The following discusses selective perception—the tendency to see what is there in light of one&#x27;s own departmental interests. Dearborn and Simon had 23 middle-management executives experience a case study regarding the Castengo Steel Company. The executives&#x27; reactions showed strong departmental influences: 83% of the Sales executives perceived sales problems, 80% of the Production executives focused on organizational structure, and Accounting executives stressed profitability. Miscellaneous executives stressed human relations problems. These findings suggest that business executives focus on issues relevant to their departments when considering various organizational challenges and, thus, substantiate the influence of departmental roles on the shaping of managerial preoccupation and perception.

In one classic study on this subject related to the hostile media effect (which is itself an example of selective perception), viewers watched a filmstrip of a particularly violent Princeton-Dartmouth American football game. Princeton viewers reported seeing nearly twice as many rule infractions committed by the Dartmouth team than did Dartmouth viewers. One Dartmouth alumnus did not see any infractions committed by the Dartmouth side and erroneously assumed he had been sent only part of the film, sending word requesting the rest.
==Advertising==
Selective perception is also an issue for advertisers, as consumers may engage with some ads and not others based on their pre-existing beliefs about the brand.

Seymour Smith, a prominent advertising researcher, found evidence for selective perception in advertising research in the early 1960s, and he defined it to be &quot;a procedure by which people let in, or screen out, advertising material they have an opportunity to see or hear. They do so because of their attitudes, beliefs, usage preferences and habits, conditioning, etc.&quot; People who like, buy, or are considering buying a brand are more likely to notice advertising than are those who are neutral toward the brand. This fact has repercussions within the field of advertising research because any post-advertising analysis that examines the differences in attitudes or buying behavior among those aware versus those unaware of advertising is flawed unless pre-existing differences are controlled for. Advertising research methods that utilize a longitudinal design are arguably better equipped to control for selective perception.
==Types==
Selective perceptions are of two types:
* Low level – Perceptual vigilance
Perceptual vigilance refers to the process by which individuals become aware of stimuli in their environment that they find enjoyable or rewarding. People actively seek out information that enhances their experiences, making them more meaningful or memorable. Typically, individuals look for perceptions that align with their needs or desires. However, this heightened awareness can sometimes lead to perceptual distortions, leading individuals to overestimate the prevalence or pervasiveness of these stimuli.
* High level – Perceptual defense
Conversely, people often try to ignore or shift their focus away from stimuli that are irrelevant to their needs or negatively impact them. Sometimes, people may even alter their perception of these stimuli to make them more acceptable. For example, if someone approaches another person, they may have no harmful intent, but the speed at which they are coming toward the other person might prompt their brain to interpret the situation as a threat, triggering an urge to escape. While they are likely to perceive a potential threat in such a scenario, it is improbable that the threat will materialize.
