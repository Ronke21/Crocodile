<text>Highway hypnosis, also known as white line fever, is an altered mental state in which an automobile driver can drive lengthy distances and respond adequately to external events with no recollection of consciously having done so.

It appears that in this state, the driver&#x27;s conscious attention is fully focused elsewhere, yet their brain is still able to process a significant amount of information related to the road and vehicle control on a subconscious level. Highway hypnosis is a manifestation of the common process of automaticity, meaning actions are performed without awareness. In some cases, the trance state in a driver can be so deep that auditory and visual distortions occur.

==History==

The idea of a hypnotic trance while driving was first described in a 1921 article that mentioned the phenomenon of &quot;road hypnotism&quot;: driving in a trance-like state while gazing at a fixed point. A 1929 study, &quot;Sleeping with the Eyes Open&quot; by Walter Miles, also addressed the subject, suggesting that motorists could fall asleep with their eyes open and continue to steer.

The idea that this phenomenon could explain the unaccountable automobile accidents became popular in the 1950s. The term &quot;highway hypnosis&quot; was coined by G. W. Williams in 1963. Building on the theories of Ernest Hilgard (1986, 1992) that hypnosis is an altered state of awareness, some theorists hold that the consciousness can develop hypnotic dissociation. In highway hypnosis, one stream of consciousness drives the car while the other deals with other matters. Partial or complete amnesia related to the time spent driving under highway hypnosis can develop for the driver involved.

In contemporary international scientific literature, the term &quot;highway hypnosis&quot; is increasingly being replaced by &quot;driving without attention mode&quot; (DWAM).

==Causes==

It is suggested that highway hypnosis can be triggered by the following factors:
* Monotonous scenery outside the window (i.e., the absence of visual stimuli, &quot;sensory deprivation&quot;)
* The flicker of white lane markings in front of the driver&#x27;s eyes
* Light glare, reflections on the car&#x27;s hood or wet road
* Monotonous engine noise and car swaying
* Driver fatigue
* The need to drive alone or with sleeping passengers (absence of distracting factors)
* A relaxed driver state or, conversely, severe stress, as well as problems occupying all the driver&#x27;s attention
* The ability to drive without intense concentration (e.g., on highways without intersections or traffic lights) or with few cars on the road

It is suggested that highway hypnosis occurs more frequently in experienced drivers and on familiar road sections, as this allows for driving in an automatic mode.

Experimental studies have shown that highway hypnosis is less likely due to monotonous landscape and uniformity of the road than to predictability of the situation for the driver. For example, if a driver has to drive in the dark on a curvy road, but they have previously driven on this road many times in daylight, highway hypnosis is more likely to occur.

==Associated risks==

Highway hypnosis is considered a serious risk factor for traffic accidents.

Although a driver in a state of highway hypnosis can drive a car, they cannot react quickly and adequately to unexpected road situations. In this state, there is a tendency for the driver to gradually increase speed (a phenomenon known as psychological inertia of speed).

Highway hypnosis is also considered a symptom of severe driver fatigue and may be the first stage of falling asleep at the wheel. In this case, the driver may not be aware of their fatigue or that they are falling asleep.

==External signs==
Thanks to experimental research on the phenomenon of highway hypnosis, external signs of a trance state in a driver have been identified:
* Driver stares intently at the road, with their head tilted forward, or the driver suddenly makes a sudden, jerking head movement.
* Driver&#x27;s eyes roll back.
* Driver&#x27;s eyes are half-closed or squinting.
* Driver makes driving errors.

==Prevention methods==
It has been established that highway hypnosis occurs more frequently on highways with high-quality pavement, especially if there are no sharp curves. Therefore, the following technical measures are sometimes taken to increase driver alertness: alternating between smooth asphalt and coarse gravel pavement, creating noticeable vibrations, and placing unexpected turns on straight, monotonous sections of the road.

It is suggested that highway hypnosis arises due to monotonous scenery or the &quot;flicker&quot; of light glare and white lane markings, so drivers are advised to periodically change their gaze direction (e.g., look in the side mirrors or at the dashboard instruments). Since one of the causes of highway hypnosis is sensory deprivation (monotonous, uninteresting scenery), it can be useful to place bright and unusual decorative objects along the highway.

Highway hypnosis is often a precursor to falling asleep at the wheel, so at the first signs of drowsiness, the driver is advised to stop the car and rest or do light physical exercises. It is also recommended to take breaks every three hours of monotonous driving, even if the driver does not feel tired.

To increase driver attention, passengers are advised to engage the driver in conversation. If the driver is alone, they are advised to talk to themselves out loud or hum.

It is also believed that chewing (gum, dried fruit, etc.) slightly reduces the risk of highway hypnosis.

<text>Sector General is a series of twelve science fiction novels and various short stories (1957–1999) by the Northern Irish author James White. The series derives its name from the setting of the majority of the books, the Sector 12 General Hospital, a huge hospital space station located in deep space, designed to treat a wide variety of life forms with a wide range of ailments and life-support requirements, and to house an equally diverse staff. The Hospital was founded to promote peace after humanity&#x27;s first interstellar war, and in the fourth book the authorities conclude that its emergency services are the most effective way to make peaceful contact with new species.

In order to treat patients of other species, doctors must download into their brains &quot;Educator tapes&quot; containing the necessary medical knowledge, and these tapes also transmit the personalities of their donors. As a result, doctors have to struggle with the tastes imported from their donors, ranging from a dislike of their own species&#x27; normal food to sexual attraction for members of the donor&#x27;s species. Other running gags include the acerbic tongue of the Chief Psychologist and one very senior non-human doctor&#x27;s love of gossip, especially about the sexual behavior of other species.

The series is noted for its diverse and believable non-humanoid alien life forms, and for its pacifist philosophy. White chose the hospital setting as a way to generate dramatic tension without violence, and because in his youth he wanted to be a doctor but had to go to work. Some commentators have praised the whole series, while others have thought there was a decline after the sixth book. One reviewer described the last book as &quot;in a very positive way, a throwback to an earlier era in science fiction&quot;.

==Background==
Sector General is a gigantic multi-species hospital space station founded as a peace-promoting project by two heroes from opposite sides of humanity&#x27;s first full interstellar war. The hospital accommodates patients and staff from dozens of species, with different environmental requirements, behaviors and ailments, but many of the stories feature types of patient that the builders did not anticipate. Initially most of the stories center round the career of Doctor Conway, who rises from junior surgeon to the top level, Senior Diagnostician. In the fourth book the Galactic Federation decides that the emergency service which the hospital offers to victims of space accidents and planetary catastrophes is its most effective means of making peaceful contact with new spacefaring species, which allows the series to expand its range of plots, characters and locations.

White said that The Troubles in Northern Ireland induced him to write about the sort of world he would like to live in, and that he disliked war and militarists. As a youth he wanted to become a doctor, but had to go out to work. Hence he relied on epidemics and natural disasters to provide the conflicts that stories need to make them interesting. He credited his wife, who was an intensive care nurse at the height of The Troubles, for advice on medical details and for pointing out how padres often did more good than doctors for disturbed patients, which inspired &quot;The Genocidal Healer&quot;.

==Challenges of inter-species medicine==
Sector General was founded to promote inter-species harmony, and therefore all medical staff must be prepared to treat beings with very different physiologies and behavior patterns, and sometimes with environmental requirements that would be lethal to staff without suitable protection. The hospital uses a four-letter system to assign patients to wards that provide suitable environments, a classification technique used earlier by E. E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith&#x27;s &quot;Children of the Lens&quot;. White&#x27;s &quot;Star Healer&quot; introduces the classification &quot;FOKT&quot;, which is regarded as an in-joke on the name of the Glasgow science fiction club Friends of Kilgore Trout.

Early on, it was learned that diseases were species specific, so there was no danger of a disease or virus spreading to other races and potentially causing a pandemic. Extreme care is still taken, as there only has to be single instance of this not being the case to have deadly consequences.

When necessary physicians, surgeons and pathologists download information about patients&#x27; species into their minds from &quot;Educator tapes&quot;, recordings of the memories of great practitioners in the appropriate species. However, in addition to medical knowledge, the educator tapes also capture the personalities of the medical experts who recorded them. Thus having an educator tape active threatens the recipient with multiple personality disorder. The new personality is from a vastly different species, often with very different behavior codes and sexual preferences, and, to make matters worse, the donors were often very dominant personalities. The mildest symptom of such conflicts is a running gag in which users of these tapes are often seen in the Sector General&#x27;s cafeteria, eating a bland-looking sandwich with closed eyes. On the other hand, the risk of finding members of other species sexually attractive is a serious concern.

Junior doctors usually have these acquired memories erased as soon as possible. However, as a doctor rises up through the hospital hierarchy, and if its mind proves to be sufficiently stable, it may find itself the permanent recipient of one or more tapes. Diagnosticians, the medical elite of Sector General, can have as many as ten different tapes active at one time, as they may have to supervise treatment of many species at the same time.

In the case of species with two permanent sexes, including but not limited to Earth-humans, the stories state that females are psychologically incapable of allowing their psyches to be violated to the extent required by the educator tapes. However, in one of the later books a very assertive non-human female character accidentally acquires several sets of memories which cannot be erased, and adjusts to this with relative ease.

==Regular characters==
Although many of the characters are &quot;Earth-human&quot; – &quot;human&quot; is ambiguous because all species refers to themselves as &quot;human&quot; in their own languages – the stories feature medical staff from a wide range of species. In each story characters belonging to species different from that of the protagonist are treated as neuter and referred to as &quot;it&quot;. Some species are touchy about any reference to sexual roles and behavior, some have more than two sexes and some change sex once or more during their lifetimes.

The following appear in nearly all the stories:
*Dr. Conway: a male Earth-human who starts as a junior intern and, over the course of the series, works his way up to Chief Surgeon and eventually Diagnostician in Charge of Surgery. Conway (whose first name, Peter, is only revealed in the ninth book) generally prefers extraterrestrial company to that of his own species, and has a habit of thinking aloud. His passions are healing and Murchison.
*Murchison: a curvaceous female Earth-human first seen as a senior nurse in the Pathology department. She eventually becomes a doctor and a Pathologist herself, and also Conway&#x27;s wife.
*Dr. Prilicla: a large but fragile winged insect-like being from the very low-gravity planet Cinruss. In addition to being highly skilled in the more delicate types of surgery, Prilicla is an empath and therefore can sense the emotions of most other lifeforms including many non-intelligent animals. Its tact and the desire of colleagues to avoid distressing it by displaying negative emotions generally makes others willing to follow its advice – a pattern that one reviewer described as &quot;a pleasant Machiavellian streak.&quot; Despite its natural timidity and the distress that other beings&#x27; anger, fear and pain cause it, Prilicla uses its empathic ability in prolonged searches for survivors of space combat and accidents.
*Major O&#x27;Mara: the Earth-human head of the hospital&#x27;s Psychology department, his job is to ensure that the hospital&#x27;s diverse species work together as harmoniously, efficiently and safely as circumstances allow, and particularly to save the staff from being driven insane by over-use of Educator tapes. Since he is a very acute observer of behavior and often uses sarcasm &quot;to shrink heads, not swell them&quot;, he is sometimes called a &quot;latter-day Torquemada&quot;.
*Charge Nurse Naydrad: a member of the Kelgian species, Naydrad looks like a giant caterpillar. Since the involuntary movements of Kelgians&#x27; fur completely show their emotions, the species is incapable of both lying and tact. Naydrad is a specialist in rescuing victims of space accidents.
*Thornnastor: a native of the high-gravity planet Traltha, Thornnastor (nicknamed &quot;Thorny&quot;) has a body like a six-legged elephant, and its own keen senses are supplemented by a symbiont that provides acute vision over up to 360 degrees. Thornnastor is the Diagnostician in Charge of Pathology, and it carries ten Educator tapes. Its fascination with gossip, especially about the scandalous activities of a multi-sexed, methane-breathing, cryogenic species, is a running gag in the series.

==Critical appraisal==
The Sector General series defined the subgenre of multi-species medical stories,
 although L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s &quot;Ole Doc Methuselah&quot; stories and Murray Leinster&#x27;s Med Service stories, neither of which were highly regarded, had explored some similar themes. Sector General was &quot;the first explicitly pacifist space opera&quot; series, while much of contemporary space opera from the USA was notably military. Mike Resnick described the series&#x27; characters as &quot;the most memorable crew of aliens ever created&quot;. Michael Ashley commented that the setting of the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; is reminiscent of Sector General. The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; television series was also set in space station with atmospheres for different species. It is highly likely that the short lived 1998-99 television series &quot;Mercy Point&quot; was influenced by Sector General.

Many commentators attribute the series&#x27; popularity to the altruism of its doctors and the emphasis on seeking to build peaceful relations between different species. John Clute wrote that &quot;in the depiction of goodness may lie the real genius of James White.&quot; White&#x27;s hatred of war and xenophobia is a constant theme of the series, notably in: &quot;Star Surgeon&quot;, where the Monitor Corps fights a savage battle in defence of the hospital space station, to prevent the conflict from escalating into a full interstellar war that can only end in genocide; and in &quot;The Genocidal Healer&quot;, where an alien race&#x27;s sexual urges are almost eliminated by a plague and can only be stimulated by hand-to-hand combat.

The early stories focus almost entirely on medical problems, mainly from Conway&#x27;s viewpoint. In Dave Langford&#x27;s opinion the xenobiological novelties were becoming less credible by the end of &quot;Star Healer&quot;, and using a variety of alien viewpoint characters gave the later books &quot;considerable new pep&quot;. These also deal with deeper issues, notably in &quot;The Genocidal Healer&quot;, and better than most science fiction according to Resnick.

Opinions differ about the quality of the series as a whole. For example, Gary Westfahl wrote that &quot;the Sector General stories remained consistently fresh and involving, and they grew in prominence as the series progressed.&quot; On the other hand, Todd White wrote that the series declined after &quot;Star Healer&quot; (1985), hitting a low point with &quot;The Galactic Gourmet&quot; (1996), and that the later books tended to stretch a short story&#x27;s worth of content to the length of a novel. However he thought that &quot;Mind Changer&quot; (1998) represented an improvement.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described &quot;Mind Changer&quot; as &quot;White&#x27;s finest performance, replete with wit, originality, medical expertise and sheer decency&quot; and commented that the series shows no signs of aging, and Booklist described the book as an &quot;enjoyable, witty resumé&quot; of Chief Psychologist O&#x27;Mara&#x27;s career.

Clinton Lawrence described the last Sector General book, &quot;Double Contact&quot; (1999), as &quot;in a very positive way, a throwback to an earlier era in science fiction&quot; since it is optimistic and depicts several advanced species working harmoniously. The struggle to build trust and produce a successful first contact is, he thought, as exciting and suspenseful as one could wish for. However he noted that the level of characterization was the minimum required to support the plot.

==Stories in the series==
The Sector General series began as short stories published in &quot;New Worlds&quot; from 1957 onwards. Originally White intended to end the series with &quot;Star Healer&quot; (1985), by which time the central characters had reached the top levels in their careers, but Ballantine Books persuaded him to continue. He extended the stories&#x27; range by introducing new central characters beginning with &quot;Code Blue - Emergency&quot; (1987), and &quot;The Genocidal Healer&quot; (1992) focused on psychological and theological issues of guilt and forgiveness rather than strictly medical ones.
The books in the series are:
* &quot;Hospital Station&quot; (1962: stories published in &quot;New Worlds&quot; 1957–1960)
* &quot;Star Surgeon&quot; (1963)
* &quot;Major Operation&quot; (1971: stories published in &quot;New Worlds&quot; 1968–1971)
* &quot;Ambulance Ship&quot; (1979) 
* &quot;Sector General&quot; (1983)
* &quot;Star Healer&quot; (1985) 
* &quot;Code Blue - Emergency&quot; (1987) 
* &quot;The Genocidal Healer&quot; (1992) 
* &quot;The Galactic Gourmet&quot; (1996) 
* &quot;Final Diagnosis&quot; (1997) 
* &quot;Mind Changer&quot; (1998) 
* &quot;Double Contact&quot; (1999)

These were also published as omnibus editions:
* &quot;Beginning Operations&quot; (2001) contains &quot;Hospital Station&quot;, &quot;Star Surgeon&quot; and &quot;Major Operation&quot;.
* &quot;Alien Emergencies&quot; (2002) contains &quot;Ambulance Ship&quot;, &quot;Sector General&quot; and &quot;Star Healer&quot;.
* &quot;General Practice&quot; (2003) contains &quot;Code Blue - Emergency&quot; and &quot;The Genocidal Healer&quot;.
* &quot;Tales of Sector General&quot; (1999) contains &quot;The Galactic Gourmet&quot;, &quot;Final Diagnosis&quot;, and &quot;Mind Changer&quot;.

===Short stories===
*White&#x27;s short story &quot;Sector General&quot; is included in the book &quot;Hospital Station&quot;.
*In addition to these books, several related short stories (&quot;Countercharm&quot;, &quot;Tableau&quot;, &quot;Occupation: Warrior&quot;, and &quot;Custom Fitting&quot;) appear in other collections by White. The first three appear in &quot;The Aliens Among Us&quot;, the fourth in &quot;Futures Past&quot;.
*The short story &quot;Custom Fitting&quot; does not mention Sector General, but does describe the Galactic Federation making its first contact with Earth. &quot;Tableau&quot; also does not mention Sector General but introduces the alien race of the Orligians, who appear in the series.
*The short story &quot;Occupation: Warrior&quot;, published in 1959, provides the backstory of the Monitor Corps&#x27; Commander Dermod, who appears in some of the books. However the editor of &quot;Science Fiction Adventures&quot; removed all reference to Sector General from &quot;Occupation: Warrior&quot; because he thought it was too grim to be treated as part of the series. &quot;Countercharm&quot; is the only short story actually set in Sector General not included in a Sector General book.

<text>The Clear Fork (also known as the Clear Fork River or Clear Fork Creek) is a stream draining part of the Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee, United States. It is a tributary of the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River. By that river, the Cumberland River, and the Ohio River, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed.

The Clear Fork rises on the Cumberland Plateau in southern Fentress County, Tennessee. It is composed of two major components, the North Prong and the South Prong, and numerous smaller tributaries. The North Prong drains an area adjacent to and east of U.S. Highway 127. The South Prong is slightly further east; it and its tributaries form an important portion of the border between Fentress County and Morgan County.

The former English settlement of Rugby, Tennessee, promoted in the late 19th century as a settlement for the &quot;second sons&quot; of English nobility who did not receive hereditary peerages, is located on the Plateau above the Clear Fork valley; swimming in its pools provided the &quot;Rugby Colony&quot; with an important recreational diversion. The stream crosses into Scott County through an oil field developed by the petroleum industry and reaches its confluence with the New River. From this point the combined stream is known as the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River; the upper reaches of the stream are the focal point of a National Recreation Area.

<doc id="890682" wikidata="Q1095292" url="?curid=890682" title="Fred Dunlap">
<text>Frederick C. &quot;Sure Shot&quot; Dunlap (May 21, 1859 – December 1, 1902) was a second baseman and manager in Major League Baseball from 1880 to 1891. He was the highest paid player in Major League Baseball from 1884 to 1889. He has also been rated by some contemporary and modern sources as the greatest overall second baseman of the 19th century. He earned the nickname &quot;Sure Shot&quot; for the strength and accuracy of his throws to first base, and was also sometimes referred to in the 1880s as the &quot;King of Second Basemen.&quot;

Dunlap played for the Cleveland Blues from 1880 to 1883, where he secured his reputation as one of the best players in the game. As a rookie in 1880, he led the National League in doubles and ranked second in extra base hits. While playing for Cleveland, he also compiled batting averages of .325 and .326 in 1881 and 1883 and led the league in assists by a second baseman and range factor. When the Union Association was formed in 1884, Dunlap was lured to play for the St. Louis Maroons where he became the highest paid player in baseball. His .412 batting average in 1884 was the highest ever recorded to that time in Major League Baseball and 56 points higher than any other player in the major leagues in 1884 due to the lack of talent in the UA.

After three years in St. Louis, Dunlap was sold to the Detroit Wolverines and helped that team win the 1887 National League pennant. Dunlap&#x27;s baseball career ended in 1891 when he broke his leg sliding into a base. He went into the construction business and bet on horses in the 1890s. At the time of his death in 1902, Dunlap was penniless and living in a rundown boarding house.

==Early years==
Dunlap was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1859. Both of his parents died when he was 10 years old. Dunlap did not attend school after his parents died and spent his youth playing baseball. Lacking formal education, Dunlap remained illiterate throughout his life.

Dunlap began playing semi-pro baseball at age 15 in 1874 for the Gloucester Club in Gloucester City, New Jersey. In 1875, he started the season with the Greighers of Camden, New Jersey, then joined the Kleinz Club of Philadelphia. He played for Chester at the start of the 1876 season before joining the Quicksteps of Wilmington, Delaware, as a pitcher. In 1877, he began playing professional baseball as a second baseman for the Auburns of Auburn, New York. In 1878, he played for teams in Hornellsville and Albany, New York. He remained with Albany in 1879.

==Major League Baseball==
===Cleveland Blues===
In May 1880, Dunlap began a 12-year career in Major League Baseball with the Cleveland Blues. In his first season, Dunlap immediately established himself as one of the game&#x27;s best players. For the 1880 season, Dunlap led the National League (NL) in doubles (27) and ranked second in extra base hits (40) and times on base (132) while serving as the team&#x27;s leadoff hitter. He also made a strong debut on defense, leading the National League in assists by a second baseman (290). Dunlap remained with the Blues for four seasons and consistently ranked as one of the leading hitters and defensive second basemen in the National League. In 1881, he compiled 156 total bases, the second most in the NL, and had a .325 batting average and .444 slugging percentage, ranking fifth in the NL in both categories. In 1882, he led the NL&#x27;s second basemen with 297 assists and a range factor of 6.73.

In his final year in Cleveland, Dunlap had a .326 batting average, .361 on-base percentage, and .452 slugging percentage, ranking among the league&#x27;s leaders in each of those categories. Defensively, he led the league&#x27;s second basemen in putouts (304) and ranked third in assists (290) and fielding percentage (.911). Dunlap was the star of the Cleveland team in the early 1880s. So key was he to the Blues that one writer observed, &quot;The Maroons without Dunlap are like the play of Hamlet without the melancholy Dane.&quot;

===&quot;Sure Shot&quot;===
Dunlap was known during his baseball career by the nicknames &quot;Sure Shot&quot; and &quot;King of Second Basemen&quot;. Most accounts indicate that the &quot;Sure Shot&quot; nickname arose from Dunlap&#x27;s powerful and accurate throws to first base. King Kelly reportedly gave Dunlap the &quot;Sure Shot&quot; nickname after watching him throw. One account described Dunlap&#x27;s throwing prowess as follows: &quot;[E]ndless practice made him adept as a monkey at grabbing a sizzling ground ball in either hand and firing it off from the very spot he seized it. His whistling throws, which seemed to clear the grass by no more than half a foot, never seemed to lose more than an inch or two.&quot;

Alfred Henry Spink, who saw Dunlap play, wrote that Dunlap could chase down a ball in the outfield and throw it to home plate &quot;with such fearful speed and accuracy that the ball seemed to sing as it flew.&quot; Dunlap was known for his range in getting to balls that others of his era could not, and he was reportedly able to dive for a ball and throw while lying on the ground with enough velocity to sting the first baseman&#x27;s hand. Dunlap was ambidextrous and was able to catch and throw a baseball with the same skill and accuracy with either hand. Moreover, Dunlap reportedly never wore a glove.

One source gives an entirely different account of how Dunlap obtained the &quot;Sure Shot&quot; nickname. In his book on the history of the home run, Mark Ribowsky wrote that the nickname dated back to a game against the Chicago White Stockings on July 10, 1880. The White Stockings had won 21 straight games until Dunlap hit a walk-off two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning. According to Ribowsky, &quot;For this Shot Heard &#x27;Round Cleveland, Dunlap won the nickname &#x27;Sure Shot.&#x27;&quot;

===St. Louis Maroons===
In November 1883, Dunlap signed a contract to play for the St. Louis Maroons in the new Union Association. He was the biggest star lured to the new league. His contract paid Dunlap a salary of $3,400 (including $1,000 paid in advance), the highest salary paid to any baseball player at that time. He remained the highest paid baseball player every year from 1884 to 1889.

Dunlap played second base for the St. Louis Maroons from 1884 to 1886 and also served as the team&#x27;s manager for portions of those seasons. During the 1884 season, the Maroons and Dunlap dominated the Union Association. The team compiled a record of 94-19, and Dunlap led the new league in most significant offensive and defensive categories. His .412 batting average was 56 points higher than any other player in the Union Association, the National League, or the American Association. He also led the league in on-base percentage (.448), slugging percentage (.621), runs scored (160), hits (185), total bases (279), home runs (13), extra base hits (60), assists by a second baseman (300), putouts by a second baseman (341), range factor at second base (6.41), and fielding percentage at second base (.926). Dunlap&#x27;s .412 batting average in 1884 was the highest ever recorded in any of the major leagues up to that time. His 160 runs scored in 1884 remains one of the highest single-season totals in major league history.

Some baseball historians have suggested that Dunlap&#x27;s accomplishments during the 1884 season should be discounted due to the lesser talent pool in the Union Association. In 1885, the Union Association was disbanded after only one year, and the St. Louis Maroons joined the National League. Although his batting average dropped 142 points to .270 in 1885, Dunlap continued to be one of the best defensive second basemen in the major leagues. He led the National League&#x27;s second basemen in 1885 with a .934 fielding percentage and ranked second in assists (374), putouts (314), and range factor (6.49). Dunlap spent a third season with the Maroons in 1886, and hit for the cycle on May 24. However, the Maroons were in financial distress, and rumors spread that the team might disband.

===Detroit Wolverines===

In early August 1886, Dunlap was sold to the Detroit Wolverines for $4,700, the most expensive purchase price at the time. In addition to the sum paid to the Maroons to grant the release, the Detroit team signed a contract to pay Dunlap $4,500 a season for two seasons, with an advance of $1,500 on the first day of November 1886 and 1887, respectively. The mid-season sale led to concerns about the Maroons: &quot;The transfer of Dunlap to Detroit is a small thing in itself, but its bearing on the entire base ball world is so great as to almost revolutionize the present order of things. He was the king pin of the St. Louis Club and his sale makes a certainty of the dissolution of the Maroons.&quot; The Detroit management was praised for their &quot;pluck and enterprise&quot; in making the bold &quot;business stroke.&quot; &quot;The Sporting News&quot; wrote at the time:&quot;Dunlap has joined the Detroits and now that team will fly the League pennant just as sure as time flies and the world grows. From the day the old St. Louis Union team went out of existence Dunlap has been anything but a favorite in St. Louis. Still there was no one in the world but was willing to concede that he was the greatest second baseman America has ever known.&quot;

Dunlap, too, expressed delight at the move, noting that he had &quot;tried for two seasons to get away from the Maroons.&quot; While the reaction to the acquisition was overwhelmingly positive in Detroit, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; expressed some concern over Dunlap&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;disorganizer&quot; and &quot;mischief maker.&quot; For the 1886 season, Dunlap led the National League with a career high 393 assists, more than any NL player at any position. In 1887, Dunlap&#x27;s defensive play at second base helped lead the Detroit Wolverines to the NL pennant with a record of 79-45. Dunlap again led the NL&#x27;s second basemen in fielding percentage (.948) while also ranking second in range factor (6.72). He also played in 11 games of the 1887 World Series against the American Association champions, the St. Louis Browns. Detroit won the series 10 games to 5. At the end of the 1887 season, &quot;Sporting Life&quot; praised Dunlap&#x27;s contributions to Detroit&#x27;s championship team: &quot;Dunlap is the king of second basemen, and a first-class all-round player. His fielding average in 1886 was .931, ranking third. This season he ranks first, with .949. ... Dunlap is one of the most active men on the field, and is of great value to a team on account of his ability as a kicker and coacher.&quot;

Before the last game of the World Series had been played, rumors spread that Detroit (which had amassed an all-star lineup with a commensurate payroll) was in negotiations to unload Dunlap&#x27;s high salary by selling him to Pittsburgh. Dunlap announced in November 1887 that he would not consent unless the Detroit club paid him half of the sum it was to receive from Pittsburgh to secure his release. He said at the time, &quot;I am sick and tired of being sold without gaining anything by it, and it is about time that my bank account was benefited by these transfers.&quot; He told a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he was not penniless and would refuse to play unless his demands were met. He told the reporter that the Detroit club had three choices -- &quot;give me half of the money secured for my release, allow me to go where I please, or fulfill the contract made with me last year.&quot;

In January 1888, Dunlap finally consented to the sale and received $2,000 of the $5,000 sales price paid to Detroit. His total annual compensation on signing with Pittsburgh was $6,000, making him the highest paid player in baseball history to that time. The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; congratulated the &quot;cranks&quot; of Pittsburgh for their team&#x27;s acquisition of &quot;no less than the king second baseman of the country.&quot;

===Pittsburgh Alleghenys===
Dunlap played for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys from 1888 to 1890, and served as manager of the Alleghenys for a portion of the 1889 season. During his three years in Pittsburgh, Dunlap&#x27;s offensive performance declined. His batting average for the Alleghenys went from .262 in 1888 to .235 in 1889. At the same time, he remained one of the leading defensive second basemen in the game. In 1888, Dunlap ranked second among the league&#x27;s second basemen in fielding percentage (.940) and range factor (6.33), and in 1889, Dunlap&#x27;s last full season in the major leagues, his .950 fielding percentage led the National League and was a career high for Dunlap.

Before the start of the 1890 season, Dunlap engaged in protracted salary negotiations with President Nimick of the Alleghenys. In late March 1890, the &quot;Pittsburg Dispatch&quot; reported that the two sides had reached a resolution, &quot;and it now seems certain that Dunlap will play his old position in the Pittsburg league club.&quot; Nimick said at the time: &quot;I had a long talk with Mr. Dunlap, and we agreed to terms for him to play with us this season. Of course the terms were below those of last year, that is, he will play for much less than $5,000. He did not sign a contract, for reasons that were quite satisfactory to me ... We know he is a good player and he is quite willing to remain with us.&quot;

In the first 17 games of the 1890 season, Dunlap&#x27;s batting average fell to .172, and as a result he was released by the Alleghenys on May 15. Aside from his batting average, disagreements with Pittsburgh&#x27;s manager, Guy Hecker, reportedly contributed to the decision. The &quot;Pittsburgh Dispatch&quot; quoted manager Hecker as saying, &quot;Dunlap is certainly the worst man to get along with that I ever met. He has had everybody in hot water during our entire western trip.&quot; Others speculated that Dunlap&#x27;s release was motivated by his $3,500 salary and the fact that Pittsburgh&#x27;s backup second baseman, Henry Youngman, had signed for a salary of only $1,050.

===Giants and Statesmen===
Dunlap jumped to the New York Giants of the Players&#x27; League in late May 1890. At the time, the Washington correspondent for &quot;Sporting Life&quot; predicted that Dunlap would bring bad luck to his new team. He wrote: &quot;Fred is a great player, but the hoo-doo that seems to shadow him will make itself felt wherever he may go. There are a number of people in this vicinity who have watched his course with more than ordinary interest, and they do not hesitate to declare him a Jonah.&quot; Dunlap appeared in only one game for the Giants and announced in July that he would play no more in 1890 and that he would spend the remainder of the summer at Atlantic City, New Jersey, with plans to return in 1891 &quot;and play the game of his life.&quot;

Dunlap concluded his baseball career in 1891 with the Washington Statesmen in the American Association. He appeared in only eight games for the Statesmen before breaking his leg sliding into a base on April 20, 1891. In early June 1891, the Washington management notified him that it would discontinue his salary payments. Dunlap returned the notice and filed a grievance, contending he should have been continued at least on half pay since he was disabled while sliding into a base. Washington refused to pay, and he never played professional baseball again.

===Career Statistics===
In 965 games over 12 seasons, Dunlap posted a .292 batting average (1159-for-3974) with 759 runs, 224 doubles, 53 triples, 41 home runs, 366 RBI, 85 stolen bases, 283 bases on balls, .340 on-base percentage and .406 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .924 fielding percentage.

==Later life==
When he retired from baseball, Dunlap was reported to have $100,000 in savings. He went into the building business in Philadelphia during the 1890s, and owned various properties in the city. The &quot;Sporting Life&quot; reported that Dunlap &quot;dropped out of the game in 1892 to follow the racing game, at which he lost the respectable fortune he accumulated in base ball.&quot; Another account indicated that Dunlap lost everything on stock market investments. In July 1902, the &quot;Philadelphia Times&quot; reported that Dunlap was &quot;clean broke.&quot;

In December 1902, Dunlap died penniless and alone at age 43. According to the &quot;Sporting Life&quot;, the &quot;last two years of his life were spent in abject poverty and mental gloom&quot; in a Philadelphia boarding house. According to several accounts, a policeman at the morgue saw the body and believed it to be Dunlap. Lave Cross was called to the morgue and confirmed that the body was Dunlap. His funeral was poorly attended by his former baseball colleagues, and one former player who did attend observed, &quot;There were not enough friends of Dunlap at his funeral to bury him and we had to call on the hack drivers to make up the list of active pall-bearers.&quot; Following Dunlap&#x27;s death, William A. Phelon, Jr., editor of &quot;Sporting Life&quot; wrote:&quot;So Fred Dunlap has passed into the great beyond, and the man whose salary figure marked the high-water limit of the long ago is gone! ... What a ball player this Dunlap was and what an artist in getting the fat salaries! ... Dunlap was a real infielder of the type so popular ten years ago -- one of the solid, bulky style through whom no grounder seemed able to pass, but who could nevertheless wave the hot ones goodbye with graceful ease when occasion demanded. With the gloves now in use to aid, Dunny would have been even a bigger wonder now than then.&quot;

==Legacy==
Dunlap has been rated by some contemporary and modern sources as the greatest overall second baseman of the 19th century. In his 1910 book on the history of baseball, Alfred Henry Spink, the founder of &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, was unequivocal: &quot;I have seen all the great second basemen ... I am free to say that Dunlap was far and away the greatest second baseman that ever lived.&quot; Stanley Robinson, who owned and managed major league teams in St. Louis and Cleveland, went even further: &quot;He was not only the greatest second baseman, but take him in all the departments of the game, he was perhaps the greatest player that ever lived.&quot; Another of Dunlap&#x27;s contemporaries, Sam Crane, also picked Dunlap as the greatest second baseman in a newspaper column published in 1912. Crane wrote: &quot;Fred Dunlap was acknowledged to be the best second baseman of his day, and was excellent from every angle. I think he excelled Fred Pfeffer.&quot; In 1910, John Montgomery Ward, a Hall of Fame inductee who played from 1878 to 1894, published an article about the greatest infielders in baseball history. While picking Fred Pfeffer as a shade better than Dunlap&quot;, Ward observed: &quot;Fred Dunlap was the king. Dunlap had the record average of .953 in 64 games with the Detroit club in 1887, and was the personification of ease and grace. He was something of a grandstand player, because of his tendency to make one-handed catches and stops but he got there just the same and was a big favorite wherever he showed.&quot;

In a 2008 book using modern sabermetric methods, author William F. McNeil concluded that Dunlap was the best offensive second baseman, the second best defensive second baseman, and the best overall second baseman of the 19th century.
Dunlap&#x27;s career range factor of 6.31 at second base still ranks as the fifth highest in the history of Major League Baseball. However, Bill James, in his 2001 book &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, ranked Dunlap as the 89th greatest second baseman of all time (and the 8th best of those who played the majority of their careers in the 19th century). James wrote that Dunlap was &quot;never a legitimate star in a legitimate major league, but a good second baseman and a .275 hitter.&quot;

<text>Eugene Lee Coon (January 7, 1924 – July 8, 1973) was an American screenwriter, television producer, and novelist. He is best remembered for his work on the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; as a screenwriter, story editor, and showrunner from the middle of the series&#x27; first season to the middle of the second. Along with series creator Gene Roddenberry, Coon is given credit for the show&#x27;s idealistic tone and for creating several key story and world-building elements that would become important parts of the ongoing franchise.

==Life and career==
The eldest son of U.S. Army Sgt. Merle Jack &quot;Pug&quot; Coon and decorator Erma Gay Noakes, Eugene Lee Coon was born in Beatrice, Nebraska, on January 7, 1924. At four years of age, young Gene showed talent, singing on the radio at WOAW-AM in Omaha. He knew 24 songs, including one in French and one in German. In his youth, Coon was a member of the Gage County 4-H Club and the Boy Scouts of America. He later attended Omaha Technical High School and participated in Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps, also playing in the school band. During this time, he was also a teenaged newscaster for KWBE (AM) in Beatrice. Coon later moved, with his parents and younger brothers, Merle Jack Coon Jr. and Bloise Newell Coon, to Glendale, California. Another brother died at 10 years old when they still lived in Beatrice. His father found employment there working with poultry, and Coon transferred to Glendale High School.

During World War II, Coon served stateside in the United States Marine Corps from 1942 to 1946. Thereafter, he remained in the Marines as a reservist while studying radio communications at Glendale Junior College, where he performed in a production of &quot;The Night of January 16th&quot;. Following additional studies at the University of Iowa, he returned to active duty during the Korean War era in 1950, ultimately attaining the rank of sergeant. He received additional training as a war reporter, and ran a pharmacy and built houses. He wrote about many of his experiences in the novels &quot;Meanwhile Back at the Front&quot; and &quot;The Short End of the Stick&quot;.

Upon his demobilization in 1952, Coon found work first as a radio newscaster before turning to freelance writing under the mentorship of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter Gene Sherman. From 1954 to 1959, Coon operated a pharmacy at the intersection of Beverly Boulevard and North Ardmore Avenue; during this period, Sherman covered his pharmacy exploits in the page 2 &quot;Cityside&quot; column for the newspaper. Sherman also allowed Coon to have a guest spot promoting &quot;Meanwhile Back at the Front&quot; in the column Sherman wrote for &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Market&quot;, using the pen name Dick Kidson.

Beginning in 1956, Coon was primarily involved in scripting teleplays for popular Western and action television shows, including &quot;Dragnet&quot; (1951), &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (1957), &quot;Maverick&quot; (1957), and &quot;Bonanza&quot; (1959). At Universal in the early 1960s, he turned &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; (1962) from a one-hour drama into a successful 30-minute sitcom. Together with the writer Les Colodny, Coon floated the idea for &quot;The Munsters&quot; (1964), as a satirical take on &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; (1958), to MCA chairman Lew Wasserman. The result of this last, whose format was worked out by Allan Burns and Chris Hayward and whose characters and situations were developed by Norm Liebman and Ed Haas, was yet another hit show, under the creative auspices of Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher. MCA, then the parent company of Universal Studios, produced the show through its Revue TV and Kayro-Vue Productions banners.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===

His &quot;Wagon Train&quot; scripts contained strong moral lessons concerning personal redemption and opposing war, and he later repeated very similar themes in his &quot;Star Trek&quot; scripts. (The latter series, though it owed much to C. S. Forester&#x27;s novels about Horatio Hornblower and Jonathan Swift&#x27;s satire &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, was sold to the NBC television network using the unofficial nickname of &quot;&quot;Wagon Train&quot; to the stars&quot;.) Coon joined the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series during its first season; David Gerrold credited him with being a skilled showrunner before Coon left in the middle of the second season. Coon was responsible for many rewrites of &quot;Star Trek&quot; scripts.

His credited creations for &quot;Star Trek&quot; include the Klingons and the Organian Peace Treaty (in &quot;Errand of Mercy&quot;), Khan Noonien Singh (in &quot;Space Seed&quot;, where he adapted a Carey Wilber story), Zefram Cochrane (in &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;), the advancement and the definition of the Prime Directive in &quot;The Return of the Archons&quot; and &quot;Bread and Circuses&quot;, respectively, the official naming of the United Federation of Planets itself in &quot;Arena&quot; (in which he inadvertently plagiarized a Fredric Brown story), and the official naming of Starfleet Command in &quot;Court Martial&quot;. Since he also had the responsibility of revising scripts, he worked uncredited on many other episodes. He also mentored the young Gerrold and helped him polish the script for the episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;. Other popular &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes that he wrote included &quot;The Devil in the Dark&quot; , &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot;, and &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot;. He is credited with much of the character development of &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s characters, much of the humor of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and the &quot;bickersonesque&quot; disagreements between Spock and McCoy.

Following arguments with Roddenberry over the tone of the installment &quot;Bread and Circuses&quot;, partly a satire on the medium of television, Coon left the writing staff and designated John Meredyth Lucas as showrunner. After announcing to Lucas that he was leaving, Lucas, who had already written the installments &quot;The Changeling&quot; and &quot;Patterns of Force&quot; for the program, quoted Coon as saying, &quot;Why the hell don&#x27;t &quot;you&quot; take over? You produced &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and &quot;Ben Casey&quot; and that shit&quot;. Lucas suspected Coon may have been secretly diagnosed with cancer, but he never definitely learned whether this was the case.

Coon contributed to four scripts for the third season under the pseudonym of Lee Cronin, as he was by then under contract to Universal Studios.

===After &quot;Star Trek&quot;===
After his work on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Coon produced the Universal Studios series &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;, starring Robert Wagner, during which he mentored Glen A. Larson. He also continued to write for &quot;Kung Fu&quot; and &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;. In 1973, he served as co-writer with Gene Roddenberry on the NBC-TV movie &quot;The Questor Tapes&quot;. The movie was to serve as a pilot for a new series, but Roddenberry balked at a decision by NBC to eliminate the character of Jerry Robinson, Questor&#x27;s human companion/mentor. (Coon died before the pilot aired in early 1974.)

Although Coon turned down the opportunity to work on &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, he continued to work with Roddenberry, co-writing &quot;Genesis II&quot; and the proposal for &quot;Spectre&quot;. He also founded UniTel Associates, one of the earliest production companies aimed at the home video market.

Coon was known as one of the fastest writers in Hollywood, and he often rewrote a script for shooting overnight or over a weekend. He had a dry sense of humor, as reflected in his two novels. After years of separation, Coon again found his first love, model Jackie Mitchell. In 1967, he divorced his wife Joy so that he could be with Jackie, with whom he spent the last five years of his life.

==Death and tributes==
A chain smoker of cigarillos for most of his life, the man whom fellow writer/producer Glen A. Larson referred to as &quot;the spirit and soul of &quot;Star Trek&quot; died in July 1973 from complications of lung and throat cancer at the age of 49, just one week after being diagnosed. A possible cause of Coon’s cancer was radiation from Nevada bomb testing sites he visited with his mentor Gene Sherman and his first wife Joy in the 1950s.

D. C. Fontana dedicated her novelization of &quot;The Questor Tapes&quot; to him. William Shatner dedicated a chapter in his 1993 memoir &quot;Star Trek Memories&quot; to him, titled &quot;The Unsung Hero&quot;, in which he attributed many aspects of &quot;Star Trek&quot; to him. Leonard Nimoy did the same in his own memoir (&quot;I Am Spock&quot;), as did Herbert F. Solow and Robert H. Justman with &quot;Inside Star Trek: The Real Story&quot;. In the closing credits of the 1999 &quot;Star Trek&quot; tribute film &quot;Free Enterprise,&quot; Gene Coon is referred to as &quot;The Forgotten Gene&quot; in recognition of his contributions to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as well as his professional collaboration and personal relationship with his collaborator, &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry.

<text>Newstead Wood School is a selective girls&#x27; grammar school in Avebury Road, Orpington, south east London, England. The school has been admitting boys into the sixth form since 2012.

==Admissions==

The school is a grammar school which admits girls in Year 7 based on the results of its own selection test. The current head teacher is Alan Blount. The school&#x27;s motto is &quot;Fortitudine Crescamus&quot; (Latin for: &#x27;May we grow in strength&#x27;). Boys are admitted in the sixth form.
==History==
The school was founded as Orpington Grammar School for Girls only in 1957, when administered by the Kent Education Committee. In 1965, as a result of the London Government Act 1963, the local area, and thus the school, came under the authority of the London Borough of Bromley. It was at this point that the school&#x27;s name was changed to Newstead Wood School. Nearby Bullers Wood School became a comprehensive in the late 1970s, and most schools in the borough are now comprehensive. There were firm plans for Newstead Wood School to become comprehensive in 1978, but the school has remained one of the only two selective state schools in Bromley. As a result, it is heavily oversubscribed.

In 1997, a survey in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; found that the school was the best value in England for each A or B grade achieved at A-level, second to St Olave&#x27;s school; Bromley was a low spender (per pupil) comparative to other LEAs. In 2004, a pupil gained the best result at Maths GCSE in England. In 2009 the headteacher told the conference in Harrogate of the Girls&#x27; Schools Association that schools were not concentrating on brighter pupils, instead trying to raise average pupils&#x27; grades from D to C, and that girls in mixed-sex schools can have their ambitions crushed and be held back in male-dominated professions (girls from single-sex schools are statistically more successful in science-based professions than from mixed schools). She also criticised a government scheme to give one-to-one tuition to less able pupils, and not more-able students, when considering the lack of women in traditionally-male occupations, and she claimed there was a &#x27;huge reluctance&#x27; to concentrate on top students.

On 1 April 2011, the school gained academy status and is now sponsored by United Learning.

==Academic performance==
At its last full inspection in 2022, Newstead Wood was rated by Ofsted as ‘Outstanding’. The school has a large catchment area of nine miles, from which pupils are selected on the basis of tests in verbal and non-verbal reasoning.

The school was ranked third amongst secondary schools in Bromley based on overall performance at end of key stage 4 in 2019 - all pupils on the Progress 8 benchmark.

Times Parent Power has ranked the School&#x27;s 2019 A-level results 121st in the country (previous year 161st) and 2019 GCSE results 11th (previous year 15th) and also ranks it 11th amongst all secondary schools in Greater London.

==Entrance examinations==
There are currently two examinations required to gain a place at the school: verbal and non-verbal reasoning.

<text>A chicken can be hypnotized, or put into a trance, with its head down near the ground, by drawing a line along the ground with a stick or a finger, starting at the beak and extending straight outward in front of the chicken. If the chicken is hypnotized in this manner, it will continue to stare at the line and remain immobile for as long as 30 minutes. Other methods of inducing this state are also known. Ethologists refer to this state as &#x27;tonic immobility&#x27;, i.e. a natural state of semi-paralysis that some animals enter when presented with a threat.

An early reference of this phenomenon was described in 1646 in &quot;Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae&quot; by Athanasius Kircher.

==Methods==

One technique of hypnosis is to hold the chicken face up with its back on the ground, and then run a finger downwards from the chicken&#x27;s wattles to just above its vent. The chicken&#x27;s feet are exposed, which allows easy application of medication for foot mites, etc. Clapping hands or giving the chicken a gentle shove will waken it.

One can also hypnotize a chicken by mimicking how it sleeps – with its head under its wing. In this method, the bird is held firmly, placing its head under its wing. Then, the chicken is rocked gently back and forth and set very carefully on the ground. When this is done it generally stays in the same position for about 30 seconds. H.B. Gibson, in his book &quot;Hypnosis – its Nature and Therapeutic Uses&quot;, states that the record period for a chicken remaining under hypnosis is 3 hours, 47 minutes.

==Notable practitioners==
Al Gore, former U.S. vice-president, Nobel Peace Prize winner, and presidential candidate, said that people in his native state of Tennessee would sometimes hypnotize chickens by placing the chicken&#x27;s head on the ground and drawing circles around it with a finger or a stick, causing the chicken to try to follow the motion.

Werner Herzog is &quot;known to hypnotize chickens; he also hypnotized the cast of his 1976 film &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;&quot;.

Steve Fairnie, a 1980s British musician, advised: &quot;You have to dominate the chicken and be right above it staring into its eyes. Then it will either go under or it will viciously attack you, so you have to be a bit careful...&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* Friedrich Nietzsche, 19th-century German philosopher, in his book &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; used a philosophical metaphor referring to the hypnosis of the chicken. It is in Chapter 6, &quot;The Pale Criminal&quot;, and reads as follows: &quot;The streak of chalk bewitcheth the hen; the stroke he struck bewitched his weak reason. Madness AFTER the deed, I call this.&quot; Nietzsche employs this metaphor again within the third essay of &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot;, stating, &quot;The unhappy man has heard, has understood; he is like a hen around which a line has been drawn. He cannot get out of this drawn circle.&quot;
*Clark Gable, in the 1945 film &quot;Adventure&quot;, hypnotizes a rooster while he and Greer Garson try to lure chickens from behind the bush by using the rooster as bait.
* Werner Herzog has included chicken hypnotism in several films, including the 1968 &quot;Signs of Life&quot;, which features a scene in which a chicken is hypnotized by a line drawn by chalk, and his 1974 film &quot;The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser&quot;.
* Federico Fellini&#x27;s 1984 &quot;And the Ship Sails On&quot; features a scene in which a male opera singer hypnotises a chicken in the mess hall.
*Ernest Hemingway briefly describes the process in &quot;The Dangerous Summer&quot;, comparing it to the hypnotic effect of a bullfighters&#x27; cape.
* The 1993 film &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot; has some lines about chicken hypnotism and shows a character hypnotizing chickens by twirling them in the air exactly twenty times.
* The United States military, when trying to avoid divulging information, gives reporters briefings with 25 minutes of intentionally dull PowerPoint presentations and 5 minutes left at the end for questions from anyone who is still awake. The presentations are called &quot;hypnotizing chickens&quot;.
* Thomas B. Hess, art critic and long time editor of &quot;ARTnews&quot;, used chicken hypnotism to describe Barnett Newman&#x27;s iconic &quot;zip&quot; paintings in a March 1950 review: &quot;There were some terrific optical illusions: if you stared closely at the big red painting with the thin white stripe, its bottom seemed to shoot out at your ankles, and the rectangular canvas itself appeared wildly distorted. It is quite like what happens to a hen when its beak is put on the ground and a chalk line drawn away from it on the floor. However, very few spectators actually became hypnotized&quot;.
*The Iggy Pop song &quot;Lust for Life&quot; contains a line referring to &quot;hypnotizing chickens&quot;, in a nod to William Burroughs&#x27; novel &quot;The Ticket That Exploded&quot;.
*Australian test cricketer Max Walker included chicken hypnotism in the title of his book &quot;How to Hypnotise Chooks&quot; (1987) &quot;chooks&quot; being Australian slang for chicken.
* Danny Glover hypnotizes a rooster in the 1990 film &quot;To Sleep with Anger&quot;.

<text>The Institute for Solar Physics () is a Swedish research institute. It is managed as an independent institute associated with Stockholm University through its Department of Astronomy. It is also a national research infrastructure under the Swedish Research Council.

The institute was established in 1951 by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences as the Research Station for Astrophysics on the island of Capri, Italy. Around 1980 the station moved to La Palma in the Canary Islands. The new station is situated within the Spanish-International Observatory on the Roque de los Muchachos. It soon became obvious that the superior astronomical climate on La Palma called for a first-class solar telescope. The 47.5-cm Swedish Vacuum Solar Telescope (SVST) was erected in 1985.

During the 1990s, the daily operations of the institute gradually moved from La Palma to Stockholm.

The SVST was removed from the tower on 28 August 2000 after almost 15 years of successful operations. It was replaced with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, which has twice as large an aperture diameter.

In 2013, the institute was transferred from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to its current home with Stockholm University.

<doc id="890709" wikidata="Q1027244" url="?curid=890709" title="Caller (dancing)">
<text>A caller is a person who prompts dance figures in such dances as line dance, square dance, and contra dance. The caller might be one of the participating dancers, though in modern country dance this is rare.

In round dance a person who performs this function is called a cuer. Their role is fundamentally the same as a caller, in that they tell dancers what to do in a given dance, though they differ on several smaller points. In northern New England contra dancing, the caller is also known as the prompter.

== Comparing callers and cuers ==
Callers and cuers serve slightly different functions in different types of dance. Improvisation in modern Western square dance calling distinguishes it from the calling in many other types of dance.

Callers in many dance types are expected to sing and to be entertaining, but round dance cuers do not sing and are expected to be as unobtrusive as possible.

Standardized dances such as round dance, modern western square dance, and Salsa Rueda consist of a number of defined difficulty levels. Callers and cuers are responsible for knowing all of the calls or cues (respectively), also known as figures, for the defined difficulty level at which their dancers are dancing, as well as all figures belonging to lower or easier levels.

Callers for other types of dance may be required only to know the particular dance they are calling.

==Contra dance caller==
Contra dance callers typically take on a role as the host of a contra dance event, stepping aside only briefly to let the organizers of the dance (who hired them and arranged logistics) make announcements (typically before the break). They are responsible for helping attendees find partners and organize themselves into contra lines, for teaching them the moves of the dance during a walkthrough, and for calling the moves during the dance until the dancers have it memorized. They also coordinate with the band to help them figure out which tunes to play and how long to play a dance for.

== Modern western square dance caller ==
The role of a caller in modern western square dance is not only to provide the dance steps which all of the dancers on the floor should be able to follow, but also to provide entertainment through a combination of factors, including programming, showmanship, singing ability, and challenging choreography.

Part of the entertainment factor can come from the caller&#x27;s use of &quot;patter&quot; — a set of rhyming words and rhythms that complement the names of the dance steps being called. Patter can not only be entertaining because it is innovative and surprising, but it can also fill in the space between lengthy dance patterns, helping boost up the energy during potentially dull moments.

There is a large, common pool of patter which callers might use. Examples are:

Allemande left with your left hand. / Back to the partner for a right and left grand.

or

Ace of diamonds, Jack of spades / Meet your partner and all promenade.
The square dance calls are underlined; all the rest is patter.

Many callers spend time inventing their own unique patter or variants on common patter.

Entertainment also comes from callers challenging the dancers on the floor. There are many techniques to accomplish this. This can be done choreographically, for example, by mixing dance calls in unexpected or unusual ways, by varying expected dance patterns, or by calling figures from unusual and unexpected formations. Callers might also use gimmicks such as calling a common and well-known sequence of calls, and then catching dancers off guard by suddenly changing an expected call.

Occasionally callers make mistakes, or forget what they are doing momentarily, in which case, it is important for them to be able to keep the dancers moving and to bring the dancers back to their partners, and home again, smoothly, and hopefully without anybody noticing.

=== Call types ===
There are two primary classifications of figure types in modern Western square dancing, &quot;patter&quot; and &quot;singing&quot;.

==== Patter calls ====
&quot;Patter calls&quot;, also known as &quot;hash calls&quot;, are based on a quick and fluid succession of spoken (&quot;pattered&quot;) or sing-song delivered calls, often to the accompaniment of an instrumental piece of music that it is not necessarily recognizable as a song. Choreography may appear &quot;on-the-fly&quot; with calls randomly strung together, but it conforms to strict choreographic rules. Most patter calling is improvised by the caller as the dancers are moving; if the tempo of the calling is done at a fast pace allowing the dancers to flow from one move to another without pauses, it may be called &quot;hot hash&quot;.

The primary purpose of patter calls is to give dancers a challenge by surprising them with unexpected choreography.

Many callers are very well known for their ability to put calls together to create a unique, smooth-flowing dance. Some callers are also known for the unusual and interesting formations they move the dancers through.

==== Singing calls ====
&quot;Singing calls&quot; are based on a sung delivery of calls, most often to a recognizable melody, and square dance calls are mixed in with the song&#x27;s original lyrics. Many widely recognized songs have been turned into singing calls. The primary purpose of singing calls is to help the dancers relax, dance well together as a group, and enjoy the song and the caller&#x27;s performance.

Some callers are very well known for their voices, and for how well they can perform singing calls.

There is often a very specific format for singing calls. Most singing calls are structured in an A-B-B-A-B-B-A format, with each section consisting of 64 beats. The &quot;A&quot; sections (the beginning, middle and end &quot;break&quot; sections) often involve simple moves done in a circular fashion, with no partner change. The &quot;B&quot; sections, known as the &quot;figures&quot;, are often, especially at the lower levels of dancing, identical, and produce a partner change. Usually this means that at the end of each &quot;B&quot; section each &quot;lady&quot; moves to the next &quot;gent&quot; to her right. At the end of the final B section, each &quot;lady&quot; has returned to her original partner. Variations are occasionally seen; for example, the ladies may move left instead of right, or the last &quot;A&quot; section may be omitted.

Singing calls, like patter calls, vary in dance difficulty, and are rarely improvised in full. They are uncommon above the Advanced program, although there are famous singing calls at the highest challenge levels.

=== Programming ===
A modern Western square dance tip is composed of a combination of patter calls and singing calls. Usually one patter call is followed by one singing call to make a tip, although this is not universal.

There are a number of ways that a caller programs the evening&#x27;s entertainment. The caller might feature a particular music theme (such as a Rock and Roll party, or a Halloween festival), or might include variations of a particular dance call throughout the night.

Generally callers start the evening slowly to warm dancers up, and to give them chances to succeed during the first tip. Then tempo and difficulty increases and peaks for most of the evenings. At the end of the evening there is usually a slower dance number at the end to relax the dancers, and to let them wind down.

=== Training to call ===
Calling a modern Western square dance requires a number of different skills and some natural talent; becoming a caller requires training— both educational training and &quot;in front of the microphone&quot; practice.

Sometimes people who get the desire to call believe that it is enough to stand up on a platform, and sing the provided text to a square dance song, or call a pre-written sequence of patter. Difficult as even that can be for some, with some natural talent, a good ear for rhythm and timing, an engaging stage presence, and perhaps a robust singing voice, even a beginner can sound good.

A caller has two main roles:
* Teacher
* Dance caller

As a teacher, the caller must develop their educational skills, as well as the educational materials used in class. People skills are very important.

As a dance caller, the caller must prepare choreographic material, and must be able to deliver it, whether by memory, or by using written sequences, or by using sight calling. The choreographic material must conform to a strict, basic set of choreographic rules: 
* Bring dancers back to their original partner
* Bring partners home
* And keep people dancing smoothly and enjoyably.

Caller training is available, and Callerlab certifies instructors.

==Round dance cuer==
Round dance cuers recite rehearsed, pre-choreographed sequences of figures. Unlike callers in Salsa Rueda or modern western square dance, who invoke an execution of figures in an unexpected order that varies from one run of the dance to another, a round dance cuer only &quot;cues&quot;, i.e., hints each subsequent figure of a predefined sequence, possibly already known to the dancers.

The cuer, rather than being expected to call out original, on-the-fly choreography, is expected to know many (sometimes lengthy) dances and lead the floor through each one by appropriately and clearly stating the name of each successive step in the dance just in time to hear it before the last step has finished. Often cuing is from &quot;cards&quot; which list the steps in abbreviated notation. Cuing each step with proper timing is often tricky, as some dance steps can have very long names (&quot;through-side-close to sidecar&quot; for example), and there are times when a series of quick steps have been placed together, which requires quick speech, while maintaining good diction.

Cuers are not expected (or even encouraged or suggested) to add patter. Rather, they speak more softly, and as quickly as possible to allow the dancers to enjoy as much of the song as possible. Cuers do not sing, either, except in rare occasions. Being more calm than most folk and country dances, round dance cuers are not expected to entertain; the act of dancing is the primary entertainment.

Cuers are expected to also know the steps they are cuing well enough to teach them. At most round dances, there are a few pieces that most people know, but it is a cuer&#x27;s job to also introduce new dances and teach them. Especially in both very early levels and very advanced levels, it is important that cuers can teach the steps, as several dances are listed as &quot;Phase 2 + 1&quot;, meaning that the majority of the steps are at phase two, but there is &quot;one&quot; step added in from another level.

==Salsa Rueda caller==
In Salsa Rueda, hand signs are used to complement voice calls; these are useful in noisy venues, where spoken calls might not be easily heard.

<doc id="890710" wikidata="Q271495" url="?curid=890710" title="Charlotte Ross">
<text>Charlotte Ross (born January 21, 1968) is an American actress. She is best known for her roles as Eve Donovan on the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from 1987 to 1991, and as Detective Connie McDowell on the ABC police procedural drama series &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; from 2001 to 2004.

==Early life==
Ross was born in the Cook County suburb of Winnetka, Illinois, on January 21, 1968, and grew up there. Her parents are Debbie Ross Kullby, and Peter Ross (died 2009), who was a financial advisor. She has one sibling, younger brother George, an NYC-based triathlete and hedge fund-analyst. Her first on-screen performance was in &quot;My First Mouthpiece&quot; when she was eight years old. She moved on to performing in various theater productions around metropolitan Chicago.

==Career==
After graduating from New Trier High School, Ross moved to Los Angeles, which her father opposed. She auditioned for the role of Kelly Bundy in the Fox comedy series &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, but was the producers&#x27; second choice behind Christina Applegate to whom she lost the role, before being cast as Eve Donovan on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Four years later, Ross co-starred with Katey Sagal in the television film &quot;Violation of Trust&quot; (aka &quot;She Says She&#x27;s Innocent&quot;). The year after that, she guest starred on &quot;Married... with Children&quot; as one of Bud Bundy&#x27;s sexier classmates.

Ross&#x27;s run on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; lasted from 1987 to 1991, earning her two Emmy Award nominations. Her other television credits include the musical drama series &quot;The Heights&quot; (where she sang on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Number One hit &quot;How Do You Talk to an Angel&quot;), &quot;The 5 Mrs. Buchanans&quot;, &quot;Drexell&#x27;s Class&quot;, &quot;Pauly&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Trinity&quot;, &quot;Beggars and Choosers&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Savage Land&quot;, &quot;Jake in Progress&quot;, &quot;Fall Into Darkness&quot;, and &quot;A Kiss So Deadly&quot; (which reunited with her &quot;Days&quot; co-star Charles Shaughnessy). She also co-starred in the Lifetime original films &quot;Montana Sky&quot; and &quot;Christmas in Paradise&quot; (both 2007). She earned a Gold record in 1992 for her work as a singer on the soundtrack album to &quot;The Heights&quot;.

Ross also played Connie McDowell in the ABC police procedural drama series &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; from 2001 to 2004. On February 25, 2003, Ross appeared in an &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; episode entitled &quot;Nude Awakening&quot;, which featured shots of her buttocks as she prepared to step into the shower. As a result, the FCC fined each of the 52 ABC stations with a $27,500 fine (a combined $1,430,000) for broadcasting &quot;indecent material&quot; between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. However, on January 4, 2011, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously revoked the fine, stating that the FCC&#x27;s enforcement of its indecency rules was &quot;unconstitutionally vague and chilling.&quot; &quot;ABC, Inc., et al. v. Federal Communications Commission&quot;, No. 08-0841-ag(L) (2nd Cir.).

In 2006, Ross joined Billy Blanks to co-host a series of Tae-Bo infomercials. In 2011, Ross appeared as Candy in Summit&#x27;s 3D film &quot;Drive Angry&quot;, alongside Nicolas Cage and Amber Heard. From 2009 to 2012, Ross began a recurring role on the Fox comedy-drama series &quot;Glee&quot; as Judy Fabray, the mother of Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron). She appeared in four episodes. In 2013, Ross began starring in the VH1 sports drama series &quot;Hit the Floor&quot;. In 2014, Ross passed on an offer to return to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Eve Donovan, and her role was recast with Kassie DePaiva because she was too busy with other acting projects. Ross made a guest appearance in the ABC musical drama series &quot;Nashville&quot;. Later in the same year, she was cast as Felicity Smoak&#x27;s mother in The CW superhero series, &quot;Arrow&quot;.

==Personal life==
On October 18, 2003, Ross married Michael Goldman. They welcomed their only child, son Maxwell Ross Goldman, on March 23, 2004. The couple separated in 2008. Ross currently resides in Los Angeles.

===Activism===
In 2002, Ross supported PETA&#x27;s anti-fur campaign by appearing naked in advertisements captioned &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Show My Buns Than Wear Fur&quot;.

In 2014, Ross signaled her support to the Animal Legal Defense Fund campaign &quot;National Justice for Animals Week&quot; by filming a video.

<doc id="890718" wikidata="Q1439916" url="?curid=890718" title="Fountains of Wayne (album)">
<text>Fountains of Wayne is the debut studio album by the American rock band Fountains of Wayne. It was released on TAG Recordings, Scratchie Records, and Atlantic Records in 1996. A reissue of the vinyl was released on Yep Roc Records.

==Background==
College friends Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger had formed two failing bands before reconvening in Manhattan, where Collingwood wrote future Fountains of Wayne songs &quot;Joe Rey&quot;, &quot;Leave the Biker&quot; and &quot;Radiation Vibe&quot; in half a day, then met with Schlesinger over drinks in order to start another band. According to Collingwood, &quot;Basically, we started all this by writing a bunch of titles on bar napkins and trying to get the other guy to laugh. We&#x27;d get drunk and just sit there writing and laughing. We wound up with a list of hundreds of titles. Then we&#x27;d decide between the two of us who was going to take which song, and then meet the next night and see what we&#x27;d come up with.&quot; Eventually it took a week to write the songs that were included on their debut album.

==Recording==
&quot;Fountains of Wayne&quot; was recorded when the band was just a duo, before drummer Brian Young and guitarist Jody Porter were recruited to the band. (Young and Porter are listed as bandmembers on later reissues of the record, but not on the original release.) Collingwood and Schlesinger provide all the instrumentation on the recording, except for the bass guitar parts, which were performed by guest bassist Danny Weinkauf, ex-the Belltower. Schlesinger and Porter had also been members of The Belltower, and Weinkauf later played with Lincoln before joining They Might Be Giants. Dominique Durand of the band Ivy, of which Schlesinger was also a member, provided backing vocals on &quot;Survival Car&quot;.

In 2016, Schlesinger explained the recording process: &quot;On the recording, I was playing drums, Danny was playing bass and Chris was playing guitar. Then Chris and I would take turns doing some overdubs on guitar or a little keys. After we made the record, Danny decided to do other stuff (he’s now been touring and recording with They Might Be Giants for many years), and that’s when we found Jody and Brian and switched the line-up around, and I started playing bass.&quot;

The album&#x27;s recording took a week and cost 5,000 dollars, with more money spent on mixing. According to Collingwood, &quot;It was deliberate that we were going to write the album and record it quickly, before we had time to think about anything. Prior to this, Adam and I had both been careful, serious songwriters, in the vein of Simon &amp; Garfunkel. We were much more careful about the arrangements and everything. But when we decided to make this record quickly and spontaneously, we figured that since doing it so fast was such a stupid idea, the band needed a stupid name as well.&quot;

==Cover==
The album&#x27;s cover photo of a little boy clutching a rabbit and posing like a superhero was shot by Nick Waplington. It was also used for the album cover of &quot;Plastic Jewels&quot; by the UK band Flamingoes, which came out in the US two weeks before this album. According to Chris Collingwood, &quot;This English photographer licensed the photograph to both bands. Worse than that, he was directly asked by us if he had licensed it to anybody else and he said no. So, basically, the guy&#x27;s a complete asshole. We&#x27;re changing the cover in Europe, but we&#x27;re keeping it the same in the States. It&#x27;s just too good a picture.&quot;

==Release==

The album was met with moderate commercial success and favorable reviews. Songs from it were featured on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot; program. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; called the album &quot;an appealing debut of clever, boisterous melodic pop that sounds classic on the first listen.&quot;

The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Radiation Vibe&quot; was included in the 2021 edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="890725" wikidata="Q740737" url="?curid=890725" title="United Nations Observer Mission Uganda–Rwanda">
<text>The United Nations Observer Mission Uganda–Rwanda (UNOMUR) was a peacekeeping mission established by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 846 and lasted from June 1993 to September 1994. Its mission was &quot;to monitor the border between Uganda and Rwanda and verify that no military assistance was being provided across it&quot;. It was based in Kabale, Uganda and its mandate thus covered 193 miles of border. Countries contributing to UNOMUR included Bangladesh, Botswana, Brazil, Hungary, the Netherlands, Senegal, Slovakia and Zimbabwe.

Its chief military observer from June to October 1993 was Brigadier-General Roméo Dallaire of Canada, who later gained fame as Force Commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda during the Rwandan genocide. Dallaire arrived in Uganda in early October 1993, where the liaison officer from the National Resistance Army (NRA) informed him he must be informed of all UNOMUR patrols at least twelve hours in advance and that all patrols would have NRA escorts. When Dallaire protested that the whole point of the Mission was to discover suspicious activity through the element of surprise, the NRA officer insisted. Also despite the fact that Uganda had agreed that the area of verification would range 100 km inside the Ugandan border, which included the transport hub of Mbarara, the NRA insisted on a 20 km limit, putting Mbarara off limits.

Dallaire noted, 
The border was a sieve, riddled with little mountain trails that had been there for millennia. Given my tiny force of eighty-one observers and the fact that we had no helicopters with night-vision capability, the task of keeping the border under surveillance was at best symbolic.

Dallaire was soon appointed head of the new mission in Rwanda and left Uganda on October 21. His replacement as chief military observer was former second-in-command Colonel Ben Matiwaza of Zimbabwe, and later Colonel Asrarul Haque of Bangladesh.

UNOMUR would later be placed under the command of UNAMIR. Following the genocide and outbreak of the Rwandan Civil War, its mandate ended on September 21, 1994.

<text>Applause is a musical with a book by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, lyrics by Lee Adams, and music by Charles Strouse. The musical is based on the 1950 film &quot;All About Eve&quot; and the short story on which the movie is based, Mary Orr&#x27;s &quot;The Wisdom of Eve&quot;. The story centers on aging star Margo Channing, who innocently takes a fledgling actress under her wing, unaware that the ruthless Eve is plotting to steal her career and her man.

The musical opened on Broadway on March 30, 1970, running for 896 performances. The production was nominated for ten Tony Awards and ultimately won four: the overall production won the Tony Award for Best Musical, Lauren Bacall won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical, and Ron Field won both the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical and the Tony Award for Best Choreography.

==History==
Composer Charles Strouse and lyricist Lee Adams (who had previously collaborated on the score to &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, among others) wanted to write a musical version of the 1950 movie, &quot;All About Eve&quot;. However, Twentieth Century Fox, which owned the rights to the movie, refused to grant them the rights to the script or the title. They were, however, able to purchase the stage rights to the short story on which &quot;All About Eve&quot; had been based, Mary Orr&#x27;s &quot;The Wisdom of Eve&quot;. The resulting musical could not contain any dialogue or characters that had been created for the movie but could use the original material that the movie also used. In April 1969, it was announced that Strouse, Adams, and book writer Sidney Michaels were beginning to work on the show, with Lawrence Kasha and Joseph Kipness producing. In July 1969, movie star Lauren Bacall was cast as aging theater star Margo Channing, the role played by Bette Davis in &quot;All About Eve&quot;. Bacall greatly identified with the role, explaining, &quot;The Margo Channing of &quot;Applause&quot; and myself were ideally suited. She was approaching middle age. So was I. She was being forced to face the fact that her career would have to move into another phase as younger women came along to do younger parts. So was I. And she constantly felt that the man she was in love with was going to go off with someone else, someone younger of course, and I, too, had had those feelings&quot;.

Bacall, Strouse, Adams, and Kasha came to the conclusion that Michaels&#x27; book was insufficient, so Kasha hired Betty Comden and Adolph Green to write a new book. They updated the story so that it was set in the present day (1970) instead of the 1950 setting of &quot;All About Eve&quot;. Comden and Green also created new characters to replace the characters created specifically for the movie. Addison de Witt, the snide and articulate drama critic played in the film by George Sanders, was replaced by Howard Benedict, producer of the play in which Margo Channing is appearing. Margo&#x27;s loyal assistant Birdie Coonan, the only character in the film who is suspicious of Eve from the start, was replaced by Duane Fox, Margo&#x27;s gay hair stylist. Strouse commented that this change also made the show more relevant to the 1970s. (A memorable moment: Margo asks Duane, &quot;Are you going to be her hairdresser too?&quot; Duane&#x27;s response: &quot;Only when she&#x27;s laid out!&quot;) At a later point, Twentieth Century Fox reversed its original decision and granted the musical&#x27;s creators full rights to &quot;All About Eve&quot;&#x27;s script; however, by that time, the show was so far along in its development that major changes could not be made to the book. However, Strouse and Adams did write a song based on one of the film&#x27;s most famous lines, &quot;Fasten Your Seat Belts&quot;.

==Production history==
The Broadway production opened on March 30, 1970, at the Palace Theatre, and closed on May 27, 1972, after 896 performances and four previews. The closing date has also been reported as July 27, 1972. Directed and choreographed by Ron Field with orchestrations by Philip J. Lang, the original cast included Lauren Bacall, Len Cariou, Penny Fuller, Bonnie Franklin, Lee Roy Reams, Robert Mandan, Brandon Maggart, Ann Williams, and Nicholas Dante.

When Bacall&#x27;s contract was up in 1971, Bacall went on tour with the show. The producers initially decided to cast film legend Rita Hayworth as a replacement for the role of Margo on Broadway. Hayworth was very interested and flew to New York to audition for the role. However, unbeknownst to anyone at the time, Hayworth was suffering from the beginning stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and could not retain lyrics or dialogue. Anne Baxter, who had portrayed Eve in the original film, replaced Bacall as Margo Channing. When Baxter departed the show in 1972, actress Arlene Dahl replaced her for one month before the show closed.

The musical was later adapted for television, starring Bacall, with Larry Hagman replacing Len Cariou in the role of Bill Sampson. It aired in the United States on CBS on March 15, 1973. It has not been released commercially, but it is available for viewing at the Paley Center for Media (formerly The Museum of Television &amp; Radio) in New York City and Beverly Hills, California.

The musical opened in the West End at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre on November 16, 1972, and ran for 382 performances. Lauren Bacall starred, along with Ken Walsh (Bill Sampson), Angela Richards (Eve Harrington), Eric Flynn (Duane Fox), Basil Hoskins (Howard Benedict), and Sarah Marshall (Karen Richards).

The Australian production with Eve Arden and Judi Connelli opened at the Metro Theatre in Kings Cross, Sydney in December 1975.

In 1980 Antonello Falqui directed the original Italian production at Teatro Nazionale in Milan and Teatro Sistina in Rome. It started Rossella Falk (Margo Channing), Ivana Monti (Eva), Gianni Bonagura (Mike), Liù Bosisio (Karen), and Gino Pernice (Duane).

New York City Center&#x27;s Encores! presented a staged concert of &quot;Applause&quot; from February 7 to 10, 2008. It was directed by Kathleen Marshall and starred Christine Ebersole, Michael Park, Erin Davie, Megan Sikora, Mario Cantone, Tom Hewitt, Chip Zien, and Kate Burton.

The Library Theatre Company in Manchester produced a UK revival of the show in 1987 starring Josephine Blake, Kathryn Evans and David Dale. It was directed by Paul Kerryson.

In the fall of 1996, the musical was revised for a Broadway-bound tour that began at Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey starring Stefanie Powers (Margo) and Kate Jennings Grant (Eve) under the direction of Gene Saks, and choreographed by Ann Reinking. Produced by Barry and Fran Weissler, the tour visited Tampa, Baltimore, Grand Rapids, and Columbus where the closing notice was posted on November 24, 1996.

Porchlight Music Theatre presented &quot;Applause&quot; as a part of their &quot;Porchlight Revisits&quot; season in which they stage three forgotten musicals per year. It was in Chicago, Illinois, in March 2016. It was directed and choreographed by Christopher Pazdernik and music directed by Nick Sula.

==Plot==

===Act One===
Middle-aged actress Margo Channing presents the Tony Award to rising star Eve Harrington, who graciously thanks &quot;my producer, my director, my writer and above all, Margo Channing&quot;. In flashback, Margo recalls the opening night for one of her plays a year-and a-half before, when Eve entered her life. Margo&#x27;s admirers crowd her dressing room and fill the air with &quot;Backstage Babble&quot;. Among the admirers is Eve, a young woman who says that she, alone and friendless in New York, has found solace in watching her hero, Margo, perform. As soon as Margo can be alone with Bill Sampson, her director and fiancé, she tries to convince him to stay with her and not go to Rome to direct a movie. Bill firmly but lovingly tells her goodbye (&quot;Think How It&#x27;s Gonna Be&quot;). Margo dreads facing the opening night party alone, and, wanting to have a good time, she persuades Duane, her gay hairdresser, to take her and Eve to a gay nightclub in Greenwich Village (&quot;But Alive&quot;). The lively evening ends back at Margo&#x27;s apartment. Eve declares that it has been the best time she&#x27;s ever had (&quot;The Best Night of My Life&quot;). Margo, seeing her 19-year-old self in one of her old movies on TV, senses the impact her increasing age will have on her career and sarcastically asks &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl?&quot;.

Four months later, Eve has become Margo&#x27;s indispensable assistant, impressing Margo&#x27;s close friends, including her producer, Howard Benedict. Howard takes Eve to a &quot;gypsy&quot; hangout. &quot;Gypsy,&quot; Howard explains,&quot;is the name dancers affectionately give themselves as they go camping from show to show.&quot; The &quot;gypsies&quot;, led by one of their own, Bonnie, celebrate &quot;the sound that says love&quot; – &quot;Applause&quot;. That night, at three a.m. after a phone call from Bill in Rome, Margo longingly wishes he would &quot;Hurry Back&quot;. Bill arranges to hurry back two weeks later, but at Margo&#x27;s welcome home party for him a misunderstanding leads to a disastrous evening (&quot;Fasten Your Seat Belts&quot;). Eve, as Margo&#x27;s ever-present assistant, knows Margo&#x27;s part in the play completely, and Eve contrives to get herself hired as Margo&#x27;s understudy. Margo, feeling betrayed and threatened, faces Eve with an ironic &quot;Welcome to the Theatre&quot;. Bill accuses her of being paranoid about Eve, and after a bitter fight, he says goodbye to Margo, ending his relationship with her. Margo is left alone on an empty stage.

===Act Two===
Margo is visiting her friends, playwright Buzz Richards and his wife Karen, in their Connecticut home. Karen, thinking Margo behaved unfairly to Eve, arranges for Margo to miss a performance by draining the car&#x27;s gas tank so they cannot return to New York in time for the evening&#x27;s performance. Stuck in the country for the night, they express their warm feelings as &quot;Good Friends&quot;. Back in New York, Eve gives a triumphant performance in Margo&#x27;s role. Howard again takes Eve to the &quot;gypsy&quot; hangout where she snubs Bonnie and her friends, who do a scathing parody of a girl who becomes an overnight star (&quot;She&#x27;s No Longer a Gypsy&quot;).

Margo is devastated when she reads a nasty interview that Eve has given in which she refers to &quot;aging stars.&quot; Bill now realizes what Eve&#x27;s true intentions are and rushes back full of love for Margo, telling her she&#x27;s &quot;One of a Kind&quot;. Margo, though, is too focused on her career to want to return to Bill. Eve, who has made an unsuccessful pass at Bill, ensnares the playwright, Buzz, and she rejoices that she now has a man who can help her career (&quot;One Hallowe&#x27;en&quot;). Her plans with Buzz are crushed by Howard who claims her for himself, telling her &quot;We both know what you want and you know I&#x27;m the one who can get it for you&quot; – Eve needs Howard&#x27;s influence as a producer as well as his silence concerning her devious rise to stardom.

Margo seems to have lost everything because of Eve, but suddenly she realizes she could be the winner because she now has a chance at &quot;Something Greater&quot; – a life with Bill. In the finale, she and Bill join with everybody answering the question &quot;why do we live this crazy life?&quot; – &quot;Applause&quot;.

<text>The Emory River is a river draining a portion of Tennessee&#x27;s Cumberland Plateau. It flows for just over from its source near Frozen Head State Park to its mouth along the Clinch River at Kingston, Tennessee.

==Hydrography==
The Emory River rises on the slopes of Fork Mountain and descends through a valley along the northern base of Bird Mountain, a prominent ridge in Frozen Head State Park in Morgan County. The surrounding area has been the subject of extensive strip mining for coal which has resulted in some stream pollution. The stream initially flows basically westward and is crossed by U.S. Highway 27. Turning more southwestward, it is paralleled for a time by a line of the Norfolk Southern Railway. It meets the Obed River in the southeast corner of the expansive Catoosa Wildlife Management Area, a large game-management area operated by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency.

Still paralleled by the railroad, the stream crosses into Roane County near Harriman. Backwaters of the Watts Bar Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River cause the water below Harriman to be somewhat slack. The Little Emory River is also impounded somewhat above its mouth into the Emory below Harriman.

The mouth of the Emory is into the Clinch River at the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s Kingston Power Plant, a coal-fired electric generation station initially developed during World War II, largely to power the uranium enrichment plants used to make the world&#x27;s first atomic bomb at nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The 2008 Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill heavily polluted the Emory River and surrounding area.

==Etymology==
According to a 1910 article in the &quot;Rockwood Times&quot; by Captain William E. McElwee, the river was named after &quot;William Emery&quot;, an early traveler who drowned while swimming the river with his &quot;accoutrements&quot; on. Early deed books sometimes refer to this as &quot;William Emeries River&quot;. The Indian name for the Emory River was &quot;Babahatchie&quot;, which means &quot;babbling waters.&quot;

<doc id="890737" wikidata="Q2428078" url="?curid=890737" title="Georgia State Route 141">
<text>State Route 141 (SR 141) is a state highway that runs southwest-to-northeast in the northwest part of the U.S. state of Georgia. It connects the Buckhead area of Atlanta with Cumming. Its routing exists within portions of Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett, Forsyth counties.

==Route description==

SR 141 begins at an intersection with US 19/SR 9 (Roswell Road NE) in the Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta, in Fulton County. It travels to the northeast to an intersection with SR 237 (Piedmont Road NE). Just after that intersection, it goes over, but does not have an interchange with SR 400 (T. Harvey Mathis Parkway). Immediately after is the southern terminus of SR 141 Connector (Lenox Road NE). The highway passes just northwest of the Buckhead Heights neighborhood, crosses into DeKalb County, and passes through Brookhaven. SR 141 passes Oglethorpe University and the Peachtree Golf Club, just before passing through Chamblee. In Doraville, it has an intersection with SR 13 Connector and an interchange with Interstate 285 (I-285). The road becomes a freeway on the northeast of the interchange, served by a pair of one-way frontage roads with &quot;Texas U-turns&quot;; it has a few exits along its length. It enters Gwinnett County near the middle of the freeway; near the end of the freeway is SR 140 where it is called Peachtree Parkway. It passes through Peachtree Corners. Then, it crosses over the Chattahoochee River back into Fulton County. It travels through Johns Creek and meets SR 120 (Abbotts Bridge Road). Northeast of there, it enters Forsyth County. The roadway curves to the northwest and then to the north. It has an interchange with US 19/SR 400 (Hospitality Highway), southwest of Cumming. Until 2020, SR 141 ended just to the northwest at SR 9, but it was extended north on Bethelview Road where it now ends at SR 20. SR 371 was removed from the state highway system as a mileage swap in order to add Bethelview Road to the state highway system.

All of SR 141 from its southern terminus in Buckhead to a point southwest of Duluth is part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==Major intersections==








==Related routes==
===Atlanta connector route===
State Route 141 Connector (SR 141 Conn.) is a connecting route of SR 141 that exists entirely within the Buckhead section of Atlanta, in eastern Fulton County. It is known as Lenox Road NE, as well as Paul Coverdell Memorial Parkway, for its entire length. It was built in the early 1990s in conjunction with SR 400 to serve area businesses and offices.

It begins at an intersection with the SR 141 mainline (Peachtree Road NE) just northwest of the Buckhead Heights neighborhood of Atlanta. The highway heads northwest, curves to the west-southwest underneath, where it crosses SR 400 (T. Harvey Mathis Parkway) with a single-point urban interchange. It curves to the southwest to meet its northern terminus, an intersection with SR 237 (Piedmont Road NE), at the Buckhead Forest neighborhood of Atlanta.

SR 141 Conn. is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.


===Gwinnett County connector route===
State Route 141 Connector (SR 141 Conn.) is a .8 mile long (1.3 km) connecting route of SR 141 that exists entirely within Gwinnett County. It is just west of Norcross. The route at SR 140 (Jimmy Carter Boulevard) and goes north along a frontage road parallel to SR 141/Peachtree Industrial Boulevard. After the split of SR 141 and Peachtree Industrial Boulevard, SR 141 Conn. merges with Peachtree Industrial Boulevard. The route then turns left onto Holcomb Bridge Road and ends at the intersection of Holcomb Bridge Road and SR 141. The route connects traffic from SR 140 to SR 141 north, since there is no direct entrance ramp between these two roads. SR 141 Conn. south does not exist because traffic can exit from SR 141 south directly to SR 140.

&#x27;

===Peachtree Industrial Boulevard===
Peachtree Industrial Boulevard is a road in the U.S. state of Georgia that begins in Chamblee and ends in Buford. Between Interstate 285 and SR 140 (Jimmy Carter Boulevard), the road is concurrent with SR 141. North of SR 140, in Peachtree Corners, Peachtree Industrial Boulevard splits from SR 141 and continues to the northeast as a highway with at least four lanes and center median, traveling through the cities of Peachtree Corners, Duluth, Suwanee, Sugar Hill, and Buford. The portion of the road concurrent with SR 141 is maintained by the state; the rest is maintained by Gwinnett County.

Peachtree Industrial Boulevard was originally built in the 1960s. The portion of the road concurrent to SR 141 was upgraded to a limited-access highway in the 1980s and 1990s.

In 2008, the section within the city limits of Chamblee was renamed to Peachtree Boulevard, to reflect the changing nature of the city. Prior to this change, the &quot;industrial&quot; name extended until Peachtree Road merges in near the city line with present-day Brookhaven. In November 2018, the Doraville City Council passed a resolution to authorize the city manager to rename Peachtree Industrial Boulevard within the city limits to Peachtree Boulevard, following the changes made by Chamblee. This change was implemented in 2023.

In 2013, Gwinnett County decreased the speed limit the road to 45 mph between SR 141 (Peachtree Parkway) and SR 20 (Nelson Brogdon Boulevard) and 50 mph between SR 20 and the Hall County line. The goal of the change was to reduce speeding and accidents.

In June 2018, the Atlanta Regional Commission Board approved funding to equip intersections along Peachtree Industrial Boulevard with connected vehicle technology.

Gwinnett County has looked at adding and improving sidewalks along Peachtree Industrial Boulevard.

The Western Gwinnett Bikeway is a multi-use trail under construction along Peachtree Industrial Boulevard.





== Orphaned segments ==
There are six road segments that previously carried State Route 141 or a derivative designation that no longer do.

# What is now Georgia SR 371 once was SR 141 between Georgia SR 9 and SR 20. It was changed to its present number in 1971. It was removed from the state highway system in 2020 when SR 141 was extended north along Bethelview Road, essentially replacing its original route with a new alignment.
# The State Route 141 designation was previously used in DeKalb County between Tucker and US 78 in what is now Stone Mountain Park on what is now Hugh Howell Highway (SR 236) which was at the time named Rosser Road.
# Prior to construction of Peachtree Parkway and the extension and re-routing of SR 141 to Buckhead, SR 141 followed what is present day Medlock Bridge Road from its current intersection with Peachtree Parkway, into downtown Norcross and became North Peachtree Road, crossed the railroad tracks at Park Street, and then traveled on South Peachtree until its terminus at Buford Highway (SR 13). When plans were drawn to re-route SR 141 to its present alignment, GDOT changed the designation of this roadway to SR 141 Connector. This designation stayed in effect until 1981, when this segment was turned over to the county and converted to local roads. What is now SR 141 between the Buckhead junction with Roswell Road (SR 9) and Motors Industrial Way (present day SR 13 Connector) was designated along with Motors Industrial Way as SR 13W before it was made part of the newly aligned SR 141.
# With the construction of Interstate 85, Norcross Tucker road, which at the time was a contiguous road, was designated SR 141 Connector, and the small segment of South Peachtree Road between Buford Highway and Norcross Tucker Road was redesigned SR 141 Spur. The South Peachtree Road (SR 141 Spur) was converted to a local road in 1981 along with truncation of SR 141 Connector to Norcross Tucker Road between South Peachtree Rd in Norcross and Interstate 85.
# As Jimmy Carter Boulevard was constructed in the 1970s, Norcross Tucker Road was split into North Norcross Tucker Road and South Norcross Tucker Road, and a portion of the road was incorporated into Jimmy Carter Boulevard. In 1981, Jimmy Carter Boulevard was designated as SR 141 Connector between Peachtree Industrial Boulevard and Interstate 85. It was converted to State Route 140 in 1984-1985 timeframe and the SR 141 Connector designation was used for what is present day SR 141 Connector at the 141/Peachtree Industrial Boulevard interchange when the Jimmy Carter Boulevard/SR 141 intersection was upgraded to a grade separated intersection.
# The 17.5 mile segment of State Route 369 East of SR 9 from North of Cumming to Gainesville was designated as SR 141 until 1970, when it was extended west to SR 20, and redesigned to its present-day number.

<doc id="890738" wikidata="Q157905" url="?curid=890738" title="Kniphofia">
<text>Kniphofia (, ) is a genus of perennial flowering plants in the family Asphodelaceae, first described as a genus in 1794. All species of &quot;Kniphofia&quot; are native to Africa. Common names include tritoma, red hot poker, torch lily and poker plant.

==Description==

The genus has herbaceous and evergreen species. The herbaceous species and hybrids have narrow, grass-like leaves long, while evergreen species have broader, strap-shaped foliage up to long. All plants produce spikes of upright, brightly coloured flowers well above the foliage, in shades of red, orange and yellow, often bicoloured. The flowers produce copious nectar while blooming and are attractive to bees and sunbirds. In the New World, they may attract nectarivores such as hummingbirds and New World orioles.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Kniphofia&quot; was first erected by Conrad Moench in 1794. Moench considered the species he was describing (now &quot;Kniphofia uvaria&quot;) sufficiently different from Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s genus &quot;Aletris&quot; and from &quot;Veltheimia&quot; to warrant a new genus. The name honours Johann Hieronymus Kniphof, an 18th-century German physician and botanist.

<doc id="890744" wikidata="Q1027101" url="?curid=890744" title="Call Me Madam">
<text>Call Me Madam is a Broadway musical written by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, with music and lyrics by Irving Berlin.

The musical is a satire on politics and foreign policy that spoofs postwar America&#x27;s penchant for lending billions of dollars to needy countries. It centers on Sally Adams, a well-meaning but ill-informed socialite widow, who is appointed United States Ambassador to the fictional European country of &quot;Lichtenburg&quot;. Signs in Lichtenburg are written in German, and inhabitants wear traditional Bavarian costume. While there, she charms the local gentry, especially Cosmo Constantine, while her press attaché Kenneth Gibson falls in love with Princess Maria of Lichtenburg.

==Background==
The lead character is based on Washington, D.C. hostess and Democratic Party fundraiser Perle Mesta, who was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949. The &quot;Playbill&quot; distributed at each performance humorously noted that &quot;neither the character of Mrs. Sally Adams nor Miss Ethel Merman resemble any person living or dead.&quot;

In 1949, Merman and her family were vacationing at the Hotel Colorado in Glenwood Springs with Howard Lindsay and his wife, Dorothy Stickney. Watching Merman at poolside, while he was reading a magazine article about Mesta, Lindsay was struck by how typically &quot;American&quot; Merman was, and immediately envisioned her portraying a colorful character similar to the newly-appointed ambassador. When he proposed the idea to Merman, who had little interest in either society or political news, she responded, &quot;Who&#x27;s Perle Mesta?&quot;

Although Merman had announced she was interested in playing a dramatic role in her next project, Lindsay and Russel Crouse approached Irving Berlin and began working on the book for &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; when Berlin expressed interest in composing the score. Berlin&#x27;s last production, &quot;Miss Liberty&quot;, had failed to recoup its investment, and he was determined to repeat the success he had had with &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;. The three collaborators agreed they needed to treat their subject with care, to avoid any legal action by Mesta. As the work progressed, Merman conceded she would be willing to sing two or three songs, but eventually accepted the fact she was going to star in a full-scale musical comedy, instead of the drama she preferred.

Producer Leland Hayward budgeted the production at $250,000. In exchange for the original cast recording and television broadcast rights, he arranged to have it financed 100% by RCA Records and NBC, with the two sharing 35% of the net earnings. In order to increase the profits, Hayward decided to charge an all-time high of $7.20 for orchestra seats.

Hayward hired George Abbott to direct, and Abbott and casting director Harold Prince auditioned thousands of actors for the twenty speaking roles and twenty-nine chorus members. Raoul Pene du Bois was hired to design sets and costumes, while the wardrobe worn by Merman was the responsibility of Mainbocher.

Once the script was completed, everyone agreed that, while it seemed originally little more than standard situation comedy material—although as the years have transpired, many musical aficionados rate it much higher—it was a perfect vehicle for Merman, and that Berlin&#x27;s score, raised to its pinnacle by Merman, was tuneful and memorable. Berlin wrote &quot;Something to Dance About&quot; to give the second act a lively opening. When the star requested a duet with Russell Nype playing her lovestruck press attaché, Berlin responded by writing the counterpoint tune &quot;You&#x27;re Just in Love&quot; and it ultimately became a showstopper at every performance.

==Synopsis==
Sally Adams, a wealthy widow from Oklahoma, lives in Washington, D.C., where she is known as &quot;the hostess with the mostest,&quot; famed for throwing the best parties in town. Despite her complete lack of experience, she is tapped as ambassador to the tiniest country in Europe, the Grand Duchy of Lichtenburg. The young press attaché Kenneth Gibson accompanies her as her aide. Sally is disappointed to find that Lichtenburg&#x27;s foreign minister, Cosmo Constantine, is a formal and standoffish person who refuses to accept America&#x27;s offer of foreign aid. She hatches a plot to get Cosmo promoted to the office of Prime Minister, thinking that he can be replaced by a foreign minister more open to her American manners and way of thinking. Meanwhile, Kenneth meets the Princess Maria, daughter of the Duke and Duchess. Her parents are planning to marry her to a wealthy suitor whose fortune will help the Duchy financially. Despite the fact that she is forbidden to speak to commoners, the Princess and Kenneth fall in love. 

Cosmo learns of Sally&#x27;s plans for him and resigns his position, opening the way for the country&#x27;s first general election in twenty years. Sally openly campaigns for Cosmo to become Prime Minister, and is recalled to Washington for interfering in another country&#x27;s internal affairs. However, the spirit of democracy has awakened in Lichtenburg: Cosmo is elected Prime Minister and the Duke and Duchess grant permission for Maria and Kenneth to marry.

==Productions==
Directed by George Abbott and choreographed by Jerome Robbins, the musical premiered at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut on September 11, 1950. Reviews were mixed—&quot;Variety&quot; said it &quot;inspires warm applause rather than cheer&quot;—and Berlin wrote two new songs to bolster the sagging second act. It opened in Boston on September 19, and while &quot;The Boston Record&quot; thought it offered &quot;only an occasional flash of inspirational fire&quot;, it played to standing-room-only audiences throughout the run.

With a record advance sale of $2 million, the Broadway production opened on October 12 at the Imperial Theatre, where it ran for 644 performances and grossed more than $4 million. In addition to Merman and Nype, the cast included Paul Lukas, Pat Harrington, Sr., Galina Talva, Lilia Skala, Tommy Rall and Richard Eastham. Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought it offered one of Berlin&#x27;s &quot;most enchanting scores: fresh, light, and beguiling, and fitted to lyrics that fall out of it with grace and humor&quot;, and the &quot;New York Post&quot; called Merman &quot;indescribably soul-satisfying&quot;, &quot;a comedienne of rare skill&quot;, and &quot;one of the joys of the world.&quot; She remained with the show for the entire run and appeared in the limited four-week engagement staged to celebrate the reopening of the National Theatre in Washington, D.C.

Apart from playing Rose in the first national tour of &quot;Gypsy&quot;, the role of Sally Adams in &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; would be the only stage role which Ethel Merman would reprise after originating it on Broadway. In July 1965 Merman would headline a revival by the Valley Music Theater in which Richard Eastham and Russell Nype also reprised their Broadway roles. The production played an encore engagement—without Nype—in Houston that October. Merman, Eastham and Nype again reprised their Broadway roles for a 1967 summer stock tour of &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;.

The national tour of &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; was headlined by Elaine Stritch; Merman&#x27;s understudy during the show&#x27;s Broadway run, Stritch had never had occasion to perform as Sally Adams at the Imperial, her debut in the role being at a matinee performance during the show&#x27;s May 1952 Washington D.C. engagement. Subsequent to engagements at the Nixon Theater in Pittsburgh and the Hanna Theatre in Cleveland—with respective openings on June 2 and 9, 1952—the &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; national tour opened at the Philharmonic Auditorium June 23, 1952, with further engagements in nine other cities—including Chicago and Detroit—the finale being an engagement at the Iroquois Park Amphitheater in Louisville in August 1953. Throughout most of the tour Stritch&#x27;s leading man was Kent Smith, as Cosmo Constantine, although Dick Smart would take over the role before the tour&#x27;s end. The cast of the national tour also included Pat Harrington, Sr. and Jay Velie reprising their Broadway roles. Stritch would reprise the role of Sally Adams in two regional theatrical productions, headlining &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; for St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre in 1954—with Russell Nype reprising his Broadway role—and for the Valley Forge Music Fair in 1956.

&quot;Call Me Madam&quot; returned to the New York stage for the first time since its original Broadway run via the New York City Center &quot;Encores!&quot; semi-staged concert version—with Tyne Daly headlining a cast including Walter Charles as Cosmo Constantine, Lewis Cleale as Kenneth and Melissa Errico as Princess Maria. Presented in February 1995 as the inaugural production of Encores! second season, &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; was lauded as the company&#x27;s first hit production. Encores! would present a fully-staged production of &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; in February 2019, with Carmen Cusack headlining a cast which included Darrell Hammond as Grand Duke Otto, Carol Kane as Grand Duchess Sophie, Stanley Wayne Mathis as Senator Borckbank, Randy Rainbow as Sebastian Sebastian, and Lauren Worsham as Princess Maria.

&quot;Call Me Madam&quot; had its premiere regional theatrical engagement at the Dallas State Fair in August 1952: with Joan Blondell headlining and Russell Nype reprising his Broadway role, the cast also included William LeMassena as Pemberton Maxwell, Michael Pollock as Sebastian Sebastian and Gene Raymond as Cosmo Constantine. In 1959 Constance Bennett would headline a production of &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, featuring Wilbur Evans as Cosmo Constantine, which played engagements at the Camden County Music Fair and at the Storrowtown Music Fair. Also in 1959 Penny Singleton would headline a 1959 production by the St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre in which both Russell Nype and Pat Harrington, Sr. reprised their Broadway roles. Wilbur Evans would reprise the role of Cosmo Constantine in a 1963 production headlined by Martha Raye which played engagements at the Valley Forge Music Fair and at the Storrowtown Music Fair, with Kenneth Gibson being played by James Kirkwood. Margaret Whiting, who headlined a 1961 production of &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; which played engagements in Boston and New Jersey, would in 1966 headline the play&#x27;s Melody Top summer stock production in Milwaukee which featured Tommy Sands as Kenneth Gibson.

Jo Anne Worley, who headlined the 1987 Pasadena Convention Center production of &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, would also headline a semi-staged concert version mounted in 2001 at the Auditorium Theatre (Chicago) with Malcolm Gets as Kenneth Gibson and Fred Willard. Leslie Uggams would headline a revival of &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; mounted at the Paper Mill Playhouse, Millburn, New Jersey, in April–May 1996: the additional cast included J. B. Adams as Henry Gibson/ Grand Duke Otto, Mark Baker as Pemberton Maxwell, and Vanessa Dorman as Princess Maria. In September 2000 &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; was mounted at the UCLA Freud Playhouse with Karen Morrow headlining a cast which included Robert Mandan as Pemberton Maxwell, Michael Nouri as Cosmo Constantine, Hugh Panaro as Kenneth Gibson, and Michael Tucci as Congressman Wilkins.

Other regional productions of &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; have been headlined by Maxene Andrews (Coachlight Dinner Theater / 1976), Klea Blackhurst (42nd Street Moon / 2009), Kim Criswell with Catherine Brunell as Princess Maria and David Hess as Cosmo Constantine (Goodspeed Musicals / 2004), Ruta Lee (Casa Mañana / 1978), and Helen Reddy with Monte Markham as Cosmo Constantine (Sacramento Civic Light Opera/ 1986).

&quot;Call Me Madam&quot; opened in the West End at the London Coliseum on March 15, 1952, for a run of 486 performances: Billie Worth headlined a cast which included Anton Walbrook as Cosmo Constantine and Shani Wallis—in her first major stage role—as Princess Maria. Noele Gordon—who had understudied Worth during the Coliseum run of &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;—headlined the production&#x27;s British touring edition in 1953. A 78 rpm cast recording of this production was released, on the Columbia Records label, (D.B. 3067), in 1952, with Billie Worth and Arthur Lowe, called &#x27; Vocal Gems from Call me Madam&#x27;. 

In 1983 Gordon headlined a West End revival, whose cast also included Jeremy Hawk as Pemberton Maxwell and Basil Hoskins as Cosmo Constantine: opening March 14, 1983, the production was afforded a seven-week run at the Victoria Palace. 

&quot;Call Me Madam&quot; has since had two evident London fringe productions, the first at Upstairs at The Gatehouse in the summer of 2009 with Thom Southerland directing a cast which included Beverley Klein as Sally Adams, Chris Love as Kenneth Gibson, Kate Nelson as Princess Maria, and Gido Schimanski as Cosmo Constantine. Subsequently, the Union Theatre, London would mount &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; in the fall of 2012: staged and directed by Michael Strassen, the production—headlined by Lucy Williamson leading as cast which included Gavin Kerr, Leo Miles and Natalie Lipin—received five nominations at the Off West End Awards and was named as one of the productions when the Union won Best Fringe at The Stage Awards in 2013 alongside The Globe (Best Theatre).

&quot;Call Me Madam&quot; began its inaugural Australian engagement on September 5, 1953, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Melbourne: with Evie Hayes headlining a cast which also included David Cahill as Hugo Tantinnin and Alec Kellaway as Congressman Wilkins, the production would play subsequent engagement in Brisbane and Sydney. Revived in 1985 at the Canberra Theatre with June Bronhill headlining and David Branson featured as Cosmo Constantine, &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; would in 2000 be mounted at the Arts Centre Melbourne with Geraldine Turner headlining a cast which included Rachael Beck as Princess Maria, Reg Gorman as Congressman Wilkins, and Spencer McLaren as Kenneth Gibson.

==Recordings==
In a highly unusual situation, two LP albums of the score were released. The recording rights had been granted to RCA Victor, which had invested in the show, but Merman was under contract to Decca Records, which refused to allow her to record the original cast album. Decca issued a 10-inch LP featuring Merman singing some of her songs, accompanied by arranger-conductor Gordon Jenkins and His Orchestra and Chorus, with vocalizing by Dick Haymes (who joined Merman in the show&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;You&#x27;re Just in Love&quot;, their single reaching &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s number 30 for a week) and Eileen Wilson (who sang &quot;It&#x27;s a Lovely Day Today&quot; with Haymes). RCA Victor went ahead with the original cast album, replacing Merman with Dinah Shore.

Merman was called back into the Decca studios to record additional songs from the show, and the label quickly re-released the album as a 12-inch LP, under the title &quot;Ethel Merman: 12 Songs from Call Me Madam&quot;. The Victor album sold reasonably well, attaining the sixth spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; popular album charts, but the LP was out of print from 1956 until RCA Red Seal reissued it briefly in 1977. Peaking at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s popular album charts, Merman&#x27;s Decca recording, which would appear on MCA Records beginning in 1973, stayed steadily in print until the end of the LP era. Merman&#x27;s &quot;Madam&quot; album was most recently available on a Decca Broadway CD, which also features Merman singing four Cole Porter tunes from the stage score of &quot;Panama Hattie&quot; (1940).

A recording of the 1952 London West End production was released of 12 numbers from the show, as Columbia 33SX 1002 (&#x27;Vocal Gems from Jack Hylton&#x27;s production by artists of the original London presentation&#x27;), with Billie Worth, Anton Walbrook, Jeff Warren and Shani Wallis in the principal roles, conducted by Cyril Ornadel, and was later reissued on the Sepia label.

Merman also is heard on the film soundtrack album (with Donald O&#x27;Connor and George Sanders), issued in 1953 as a 10-inch album, also on the Decca label. Scoring fifth position on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s popular albums charts when first released, the soundtrack, taken out of print in 1957, was reissued in 1981 by Stet Records on a 12-inch LP which also contained songs from the film scores of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1955) and &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Tomorrow&quot; (1955). The Merman soundtrack has not been legally issued on CD.

A 1995 Broadway concert cast album, featuring Tyne Daly, Lewis Cleale, Christopher Durang, Ken Page, and Melissa Errico, is available on the DRG label.

==Promotional appearances==
On the premiere episode of NBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Big Show&quot; on November 5, 1950, original Broadway cast members Ethel Merman, Paul Lukas, and Russell Nype appeared in the first half-hour (of the hour-and-a-half program) and performed songs from the score in order of their appearance in the production, while host Tallulah Bankhead filled in story notes between songs (although accidentally missing one story cue). Merman sang &quot;The Hostess With the Mostes&#x27; on the Ball,&quot; then Lukas sang &quot;Lichtenburg,&quot; then Merman sang &quot;Can You Use Any Money Today?&quot; and &quot;The Best Thing for You (Would Be Me)&quot;. Finally, Merman sang &quot;You&#x27;re Just in Love&quot; with Nype.

==In political culture==
Known as &quot;Madam Speaker&quot;, when United Kingdom&#x27;s Betty Boothroyd was assigned the chair of Deputy Speaker (1987–1992), backbencher Peter Pike asked her: &quot;What do we call you?&quot; and drawing from her show business years, Boothroyd replied: &quot;Call me Madam.&quot;

<doc id="890752" wikidata="Q7728844" url="?curid=890752" title="The Dancing Years">
<text>The Dancing Years is a musical with book and music by Ivor Novello and lyrics by Christopher Hassall, set in Vienna, from 1911 until 1938. It follows a Jewish composer and his love for two women of different social classes, with an ending set against the background of Nazi persecution.

The piece opened in early 1939 in London&#x27;s West End, starring Novello in an expensive, spectacular production, with several scene changes and a large cast. When theatres in London closed at the start of the Second World War, the show went on tour in Britain for the next three years. Censorship originally prevented the inclusion of the Nazi element, but by the time &quot;The Dancing Years&quot; reopened at the Adelphi Theatre in 1942 it had been reinstated. 

==Synopsis==
In 1911, Rudi Kleber, a penniless young Jewish composer, plays the piano at an Austrian country inn, where he has been friends since childhood with the innkeeper&#x27;s daughter, Grete; they pledge to marry someday. Maria Zeitler, an operetta star, arrives with her older admirer and patron, Prince Charles Metterling. She and Rudi fall in love, and she becomes his mistress; he composes successful operettas for her. Three years later, Grete returns from England. She has become a dancer, and Rudi swiftly includes her in his production. Maria is jealous, fearing Rudi is in love with Grete, even though Grete has a boyfriend, Franzl. Maria overhears Rudi proposing to Grete in jest and does not wait to hear Grete laughingly reject him. Pregnant and believing Rudi will never marry her, Maria returns to Vienna and immediately marries Prince Charles.

Maria&#x27;s child, Otto, is brought up to believe he is Metterling&#x27;s son. A dozen years later, Maria introduces Otto to Rudi. Rudi and Maria discover that they are still love with each other, and Maria is unhappy in her marriage, but Rudi realizes he must not break up her marriage for the sake of their son. 

Another decade passes. In 1938 Rudi is arrested by the Nazis for helping Jews to escape Austria, but Maria uses her husband&#x27;s connections to help him. She assures him that their son opposes the Nazis and tells him that he will be remembered for making &quot;the whole world dance&quot;.

== Productions ==
The musical was first produced at London&#x27;s Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 23 March 1939, directed by Novello&#x27;s frequent collaborator Leontine Sagan. Novello starred opposite Mary Ellis. It closed at the start of the Second World War in September 1939 after 187 performances. After a three-year provincial tour, the show reopened at the Adelphi Theatre on 14 March 1942, running there until July 1944, for a total of 969 performances. It was the most popular show of the war and earned an estimated £1,000,000. After this, the show toured extensively in Britain and was revived numerous times, including in London, and was adapted for film and television. The 1968 West End revival starred June Bronhill.

The Australian production opened in Melbourne at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in June 1946. The cast included Max Oldaker as Rudi, Elizabeth Gaye as Grete and Viola Wilson as Maria.

<doc id="890754" wikidata="Q235863" url="?curid=890754" title="Genevieve">
<text>Genevieve (; ; also called &quot;Genovefa&quot; and &quot;Genofeva&quot;; 419/422 AD – 502/512 AD) was a consecrated virgin, and is one of the two patron saints of Paris in the Catholic and Orthodox traditions. Her feast day is on 3 January.

Recognized for her religious devotion at a young age, she met Germanus of Auxerre and Lupus of Troyes when she was a child and dedicated herself to a virginal life. Miracles and healings began to happen around her early on and she became known for changing the weather. She moved from Nanterre, her hometown, to Paris, after her parents died and became known for her piety, healings, and miracles, although the residents of Paris resented her and would have killed her if not for Germanus&#x27; interventions. Her prayers saved Paris from being destroyed by the Huns under Attila in 451 and other wars; her organisation of the city&#x27;s women was called a &quot;prayer marathon&quot; and Genevieve&#x27;s &quot;most famous feat&quot;. She was involved in two major construction projects in Paris, a basilica in the honour of Saint Denis of Paris in 475 and the Basilica of the Holy Apostles, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul .

Genevieve performed miracles both before and after her death. She was recognized as the patron saint of Paris in the 14th century. She was &quot;a favorite of both the humblest residents and of the Bourbon family, and was equally venerated by Erasmus and revolutionary fishwives&quot; and was considered &quot;a cultural symbol which Parisians shared, appropriated, negotiated, and used according to specific communal assumptions and traditions&quot;.

Genevieve was publicly invoked during emergencies related to the needs and expectations of the residents of Paris 153 times between 885 and October 1791, ranging from spontaneous and less-ritualized invocations and processions with her reliquary during the Middle Ages to highly ritualized ones said before her unveiled reliquary in the years leading up to the French Revolution. As times and conditions changed in Paris, so did the ways in which Genevieve was invoked and processed. As new calamities threatened the city and new intercessions to her were needed, new associations, images, and metaphors were required. Devotion to her remained popular throughout the history of Paris, although devotion to her has never returned to its pre-Revolutionary popularity and unifying status.

==Life==

=== Early life ===
Genevieve was born in Nanterre, France, a small village almost west of Paris, to Severus and Gerontia, who were of German or possibly Frankish origins. A candle is one of her most common attributes; she is sometimes depicted with the devil, who is said to have blown out her candle when she prayed at night.

Genevieve appears in the &quot;Martyrology of Jerome&quot;; her &quot;vita&quot; appeared many centuries after her death, although hagiographer Donald Attwater states that her &quot;vita&quot; claims to be written by a contemporary of Genevieve and &quot;Its authenticity and value are the subject of much discussion&quot;. According to historian Moshe Sluhovsky, the &quot;Vita of Sainte Geneviève&quot; was written shortly after her death, in the late 500s and was based upon the &quot;vita&quot; of Martin of Tours. In 1310, the first French edition of her &quot;vita&quot; was published; in 1367, the first French translation was published. As David Farmer states, &quot;little can be known about her with certainty, but her cult has flourished on civil and national pride&quot;.

Even though popular tradition represents Genevieve&#x27;s parents as poor peasants, their names, which were common amongst the Gallo-Roman aristocracy, are considered evidence that she was born into the Gallic upper class. She was recognised for her religious devotion from an early age. When Genevieve was seven years old (), Germanus of Auxerre and Lupus of Troyes stopped at Nanterre on their way to Britain from Gaul to put an end to the Pelagian heresy. Germanus saw Genevieve in a crowd of villagers who gathered to meet and obtain Germanus&#x27; and Lupus&#x27; blessing and observed her thoughtfulness and piety. After speaking to her and encouraging her &quot;to persevere in the path of virtue&quot;, Germanus interviewed her parents and told them that she would &quot;be great before the face of the Lord&quot; and that by her example, lead and teach many consecrated virgins. As Sluhovsky states, &quot;Miracles marking the young girl as a bride of Christ followed&quot;. Genevieve told Germanus that she wanted to follow God; according to her &quot;vita&quot;, Germanus confirmed her desire to become a consecrated virgin, plucked a coin from the ground, and instructed her to have a necklace made from it to remind her about their meeting.

According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, Germanus gave Genevieve a medal engraved with a cross and instructed her to wear it instead of pearls and gold jewelry to help her to remember her commitment to Christ. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; also states that since there were no convents near Navarre, she &quot;remained at home, leading an innocent, prayerful life&quot;; according to historian Jo Ann McNamara, Germanus inspired Genevieve to dedicate her life and virginity to God&#x27;s service, which was not limited to an established rule or a monastic lifestyle. It is unknown when Genevieve received the consecration of virgins; some sources state that she received her veil from Pope Gregory I, while others state that she, along with two companions, received them from the Bishop of Paris when she was 15 years old. Sluhovsky states that Genevieve was consecrated .

Genevieve&#x27;s &quot;vita&quot; relates a story about her mother being struck blind after violently preventing Genevieve from attending church on a feast day. After almost two years, Genevieve realised that she was the reason for her mother&#x27;s blindness; after her mother asked her to retrieve water for her from a nearby well, she restored her mother&#x27;s sight with it. According to Sluhovsky, the miracle confirmed Genevieve&#x27;s sanctity and her family later allowed her to be brought with two girls before a bishop to be consecrated as virgins. The bishop blessed her before the other girls even though she was the youngest. Sluhovsky calls her mother&#x27;s healing the first water-related miracle associated with Genevieve, who was invoked to protect Paris from floods centuries after her death. The Navarre well was a popular site of veneration well into the 15th century. By the 16th century, many miracles occurred at the site and it was one of the major pilgrimage sites in the Ile-de-France.

In the 1700s, an annual pilgrimage to Navarre was celebrated the first Sunday after Easter and many of the well&#x27;s visitors were members of the French royal family. For example, Anne of Austria had a &quot;special devotion&quot; to Genevieve and would make yearly pilgrimages on January 3, Genevieve&#x27;s feast day, to the well in Navarre and to pray for the birth of a male heir. After Anne&#x27;s son was born, she visited Navarre to thank Genevieve and in 1642, donated the cornerstone for a new seminary there. According to Sluhovsky, other fountains and springs were associated with Genevieve and were attributed with healing powers, including against high fevers, into the early modern period. In 1599, the Swiss physician and writer Thomas Platter recorded a possibly earlier water miracle: when Genevieve was still in school, a bridge appeared over a ditch filled with water, and then disappeared after she crossed it. Platter argued that this miracle was the reason the residents of Paris ascribed Genevieve with the power to change the weather.

=== Later life and death ===
After her parents&#x27; deaths, Genevieve went to live with her godmother in Paris, devoting herself to prayer and charitable works. She became severely paralysed and almost died; after she recovered, she reported that she had seen visions of heaven. In Paris, she became admired for her piety and devotion to works of charity, and practiced fasting, &quot;severe corporal austerities&quot;, and the mortification of the flesh, which included abstaining from meat and breaking her fast only twice a week. She fasted, between the ages of 15 and 50, from Sunday to Thursday and from Thursday to Sunday; her diet consisted of beans and barley bread, and she never drank alcohol. After she turned 50 and by order of her bishops, she added fish and milk to her diet. She devoutly kept vigil each Saturday night, &quot;following the teaching of the Lord concerning the servant who awaited the master&#x27;s return from a wedding&quot;.

Genevieve&#x27;s neighbours, &quot;filled with jealousy and envy&quot;, accused her in 445 or 446 of being a hypocrite and imposter, and that her visions and prophecies were frauds. Sluhovsky states that Genevieve &quot;received the divine gift of reading people&#x27;s thoughts&quot;, which displeased many residents of Paris. Sluhovsky also states that opposition to her occurred because she threatened the male hierarchy in Paris, so she needed patronage and recognition from established male authorities, which she received from Germanius, Simeon Stylites, and Clovis I. Her enemies plotted to drown her, but Germanus visited Paris again and defended her, although the attacks continued. The bishop of Paris appointed her to care for other consecrated virgins; &quot;by her instruction and example she led them to a high degree of sanctity&quot;.

Shortly before the Huns&#x27; 451 attack of Paris, Genevieve prophesied that the city would be spared, but that those who fled Paris would be killed. Genevieve and Germanus&#x27; archdeacon persuaded the people of Paris that she &quot;was not a prophetess of doom&quot; and convinced the women that instead of joining their husbands and abandoning their homes, to pray and do acts of penance to spare the city. It is claimed that the intercession of Genevieve&#x27;s prayers caused Attila&#x27;s army to go to Orléans instead. According to her &quot;vita&quot;, Genevieve persuaded the women of Paris to undertake a series of fasts, prayers, and vigils &quot;in order to ward off the threatening disaster, as Esther and Judith had done in the past&quot;. McNamara, who translated Genevieve&#x27;s &quot;vita&quot;, calls it a &quot;prayer marathon&quot; and Genevieve&#x27;s &quot;most famous feat&quot;. Genevieve also persuaded the men to not remove their goods from Paris. The city&#x27;s residents were again angered by her prophesies, and as Sluhovsky put it, &quot;possibly by her disruption of gender hierarchies&quot;; they again plotted to kill her, but she was saved by Germanus&#x27; intervention; a messenger was sent to bring her eucharistic loaves shortly after his death, which prevented the residents from carrying out their plan against Genevieve.

Years later, Genevieve &quot;distinguished herself by her charity and self-sacrifice&quot; during the defeat of Paris by Merowig in 480 and was able to influence him and his successors, Childeric and Clovis I, to be lenient towards the city&#x27;s residents. According to Farmer, Genevieve made an agreement with soldiers during the siege of Paris to obtain provisions, which were transported by river from Arcis and Troyes. Her &quot;vita&quot; reports that Clovis, who venerated her, often pardoned criminals he had put in prison at Genevieve&#x27;s request, even if they were guilty; Attawater states that Genevieve asked Clovis to free prisoners and be lenient to lawbreakers. According to Farmer, she &quot;won Childeric&#x27;s respect&quot;. He ordered the Paris gates closed so that Genevieve could not rescue prisoners he wanted to execute, but after Genevieve was informed of his plans, she opened the gates by touching them, without a key; she then met with Childeric and persuaded him not to execute the prisoners. She led a convoy, and &quot;proved herself capable of leading a paramilitary operation which necessitated crossing enemy lines&quot;, through the blockade of Paris up the Seine from Troyes to bring food to the starving citizens. On her return home, Genevieve&#x27;s prayers saved the eleven ships that carried her, her companions, and the grain for the residents of Paris. Back in Paris, she gave food to the poor first.

Genevieve was also involved in two major construction projects in Paris. She had a strong devotion to Saint Denis of Paris, the city&#x27;s first bishop, and wanted to build a basilica in his honour in 475, even though the local priests had few resources. She told them to go to the bridge of Paris, where they found an abandoned lime kiln, which provided the building materials for the basilica. After praying all night, one of the priests promised to raise the funds needed to hire workers, and carpenters donated their time to gather wood and other resources. When the workers ran out of water to drink, Genevieve prayed and made the sign of the cross over a vessel, and water was miraculously provided. The basilica was later called the Priory of Saint Denis de Strata. Genevieve collaborated with Clothilde, the wife of Clovis I, to bring about his conversion to Christianity; shortly before her death, Genevieve convinced him to build the Basilica of the Holy Apostles, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, which was completed after the year 500. After Genevieve&#x27;s death, in recognition of her part in Clovis&#x27; conversion, Clothilde was able to honour her grave.

Genevieve&#x27;s &quot;vita&quot; states that &quot;she passed over in ripe old age, full of virtue&quot;; she died at the age of 82. After her death, she was enshrined in the Basilica of the Holy Apostles, which she helped build. She was buried next to members of Clovis&#x27; family and she was considered a protector of the royal family. Miracles started occurring at the basilica immediately following her internment there; her &quot;vita&quot; records the earliest ones. Her entombment at the basilica helped Genevieve gain prestige; soon after her death, her tomb became a pilgrimage site. Genevieve&#x27;s &quot;vita&quot; states, about the basilica, &quot;A triple portico adjoins the church, with pictures of Patriarchs and Prophets, Martyrs and Confessors to the faith in ancient times from pages of history books&quot;. Healings took place at her shrine after Genevieve&#x27;s death; oil that was kept in the Abbey of Saint Genevieve, which was built early in the 6th century, was reported to heal blindness as late as the 9th century. Additional miracles experienced by pilgrims to her shrine were recorded into the 14th century. Similar to the miracles that occurred during Genevieve&#x27;s lifetime, there were reports of miracles such as the healing of eye disease, paralysis, the plague, and high fever.

=== Miracles ===
According to McNamara, during the Franks&#x27; many sieges of Paris, Genevieve had to convince them &quot;that she and her God were allies worth having&quot;. McNamara also states that Genevieve &quot;aligned with the poor and the conquered against unharnessed secular power&quot;. McNamara believes, however, that her status as a woman with no official status or political power &quot;rendered her innocuous in the context of secular power&quot; and reports that Genevieve inspired the Franks to respect the Gallic saints and provided evidence to the rulers on both sides that God responded to her prayers. McNamara goes on to state, &quot;Power, as expressed through miracles, protected Childeric and his successors from the possibility that whatever mercy and indulgence they showed towards the saints and to the poor they championed might be construed as a sign of weakness unbecoming a warrior&quot;. Sluhovsky states that miraculous healings, which included restoring sight to the blind, healing women of paralysis, and expelling demons from the possessed, occurred both during Genevieve&#x27;s lifetime and after her death.

According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, Genevieve had frequent visions of heavenly saints and angels. She also performed miracles in Paris and throughout the Ile-de-France, which included exorcising demons, healing the blind, resurrecting the dead, rescuing prisoners, and helping a consecrated virgin escape her fiancé. Genevieve&#x27;s &quot;vita&quot; reports that she rekindled a candle after it went out on the way from her cell to the Basilica of Saint-Denis; the virgins with her were frightened, so she asked to hold the candle and it immediately lit up again. When she arrived at the basilica, the candle was consumed by its own fire and after completing her prayers, another candle was lit when she touched it and people were healed when they procured fragments of her candle. Later stories about this event report that a demon was trying to extinguish the candle and that an angel protected her. According to Sluhovsky, the residents of Paris were familiar with this story because an angel, looking over her right shoulder, and a demon, looking over her left shoulder, were featured with her in the most common iconographic representations of Genevieve, including in several late medieval and early modern drawings, miniatures, and engravings. The image also appeared in the earliest surviving statues and miniatures of her, including her statue at the Louvre, created in the 13th century, and a miniature at her abbey.

Genevieve&#x27;s &quot;vita&quot; states that when a woman stole Genevieve&#x27;s shoes, the woman was struck blind when she arrived at her home; someone led her back to Genevieve, who healed her after she asked for her forgiveness. Her &quot;vita&quot; also reports that Genevieve was able to discern that a young woman was lying about her chastity and that &quot;she restored vision, strength, and life to various people&quot;. Genevieve also healed a nine-year-old girl who lived in Lyon and healed, by the laying on of her hands, a young girl who had not been able to walk for two years. Genevieve resurrected a four-year-old boy, the son of a woman she had healed of demon possession, who had fallen into a well and drowned. The boy was baptised on Easter and was subsequently called Cellomerus because he &quot;had recovered his life in [Genevieve&#x27;s] cell&quot;. Also during Easter, she healed a blind woman with prayers and with the sign of the cross. She healed a man from Meaux who had a withered hand and arm; she prayed for him, touched his arm and joints, and made the sign of the cross over him; he was restored to health in 30 minutes. She released twelve people who lived in Paris of demon possession; she ordered them to go to the Basilica of Saint-Denis and healed them after making the sign of the cross over each of them.

Genevieve was asked to heal the wife of a tribune of paralysis, which was done with prayer and the sign of the cross. While in Troyes, many people were brought to her for healing, including a sick child who was healed after drinking water she had blessed, as well as a blind man, whom the writer of her &quot;vita&quot; reports had been punished for working on Sunday. Her &quot;vita&quot; also reports that many people, including those suffering from demon possession, had been healed after tearing off parts of her garments. She healed a city official, who had been deaf for four years, by touching his ears while making the sign of the cross over them. Her &quot;vita&quot; describes miracles that happened in Orléans through her intercessions, including raising the daughter of a family&#x27;s matriarch from the dead and healing a man who became ill because he refused to forgive his servant. Genevieve then visited Tours, &quot;braving many perils on the River Loure&quot;; she was greeted there by a crowd of people possessed by demons, whom she healed, with prayers and the sign of the cross, in the Basilica of Saint Martin. Some victims reported that Genevieve&#x27;s fingers &quot;blazed up one by one with celestial fire&quot; while healing them. She also healed three women of demon possession privately, in their homes, and at the request of their husbands. Genevieve&#x27;s &quot;vita&quot; reports that in Tours, &quot;everyone honored her in her comings and goings&quot;. Her &quot;vita&quot; also reports that near Genevieve&#x27;s home, she was able to spot and remove a demon from the opening of a water vessel.

The parents of a young boy brought her their son, whom she healed of blindness, deafness, and paralysis by making the sign of the cross and rubbing oil on him. Her prayers protected a harvest near Meaux from a whirlwind during a rainstorm; neither the reapers nor the crops were touched by any water. Another time, while traveling by ship on the Seine, her prayers saved the ship; her &quot;vita&quot; makes the connection between this and the miracle of Christ calming the storm in the Gospels. Genevieve would often use oil to anoint and heal the sick. Her &quot;vita&quot; reports that on one occasion, she sent for a vessel with oil that was supposed to have been blessed by a bishop, but after she prayed for an hour, the vessel was miraculously filled with oil and she was able to heal someone from demon possession.

== Influence ==

By the 14th century, Genevieve was recognized as the patron saint and a protector of Paris, which Sluhovsky finds remarkable because she was a woman. Sluhovsky called Genevieve&#x27;s cult, which lasted over 1,000 years, &quot;a success story&quot; and said, &quot;It was a process of expanding patronage—from monastery to neighborhood, to city, to the entire kingdom. Throughout, however, the saint managed to maintain her intimate friendship with the people of Paris&quot;. According to Shuhovsky, &quot;[Genevieve] became a favorite of both the humblest residents and of the Bourbon family, and was equally venerated by Erasmus and revolutionary fishwives&quot;. Sluhovsky considers Genevieve &quot;a cultural symbol which Parisians shared, appropriated, negotiated, and used according to specific communal assumptions and traditions&quot;.

Complex images and attributions of Genevieve were created over a period of over 700 years, in liturgical writings, in editions of her &quot;Vita&quot;, in iconography, and in textual metaphors that were motivated by changing social, political, and religious conditions. Despite a wide variety of changes throughout the history of Paris and despite the numerous choices its residents had for possible intercessors, Genevieve was chosen as the city&#x27;s patron saint. According to Sluhovsky, Genevieve successfully maintained her place in what he called &quot;the hierarchy of the sacred in Paris&quot; throughout the city&#x27;s history. The placement of her shrine, for example, remained static, despite the changes that occurred throughout the city&#x27;s history. Her public cult connected segments of French society and the urban and rural parts of France by bringing peasants into the city and by motivating urban residents to pray to her for successful crops and harvests outside Paris. Two churches in England, where five convents celebrated her feast, were dedicated to her during the Middle Ages, and her cult also spread to Southwest Germany.

=== Invocations and processions ===
Genevieve was publicly invoked during emergencies related to the needs and expectations of the residents of Paris 153 times between 885 and October 1791. They ranged from spontaneous and less-ritualized invocations and processions with her reliquary during the Middle Ages to highly ritualized ones said before her unveiled reliquary in the years leading up to the French Revolution. The reasons for the invocations also changed, from protection against floods to prayers for military victories, against a variety of meteorological occurrences, and for a steady food supply into Paris. Over 70 emergency invocations of Genevieve were processions with her reliquary from her shrine to Notre-Dame Cathedral. By the 18th century, the public rituals invoking Genevieve &quot;were motivated not so much by concern for the well-being of the city at large, but for the well-being of the royal family&quot;.

Genevieve&#x27;s relics were involved in 120 public invocations between 1500 and 1793, with over one-third occurring during the 18th century, which art historian Hannah Williams found surprising because &quot;superstitious spirituality, with miracle-working objects and cults of saints, sits uneasily with our idea of the eighteenth century as the &#x27;age of reason&#x27;&quot;. As Williams states, Genevieve&#x27;s relics were &quot;intimately tied to the city&#x27;s history&quot; and were called upon by the residents of Paris during times of crisis, &quot;their faith rewarded with Saint Geneviève&#x27;s long and impressive record of miracles&quot;. In 2016, Williams conducted an art-historical study of Genevieve&#x27;s miracles, following four objects—her relics, two paintings, and Saint Genevieve&#x27;s Church—across four events in the history of Paris, in order to demonstrate how their &quot;use, reuse, transformations and appropriations reveal not religious decline, but shifting devotional practices and changing relationships with religious ideas and institutions&quot; in Paris and throughout France. Williams also sought to demonstrate, using Genevieve&#x27;s objects, the inseparability of religion from 18th-century Paris life.Sluhovsky states that as times changed in Paris, the way in which she was invoked also changed. As new calamities threatened the city and new intercessions to her were needed, new readings of her vita provided the associations, images, and metaphors required. As Sluhovsky says, &quot;Geneviève was remade to fit new expectations&quot;. Sluhovsky also states that Genevieve remained relevant for her followers because &quot;she was made and remade by them&quot; and because her roles, which changed throughout the centuries, were designed with different meanings, functions, and attributes. For example, Sluhovsky reports that the French government controlled and used Genevieve&#x27;s relics for religio-political purposes, invoking her intervention in wars and sieges throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. Her image was changed into a military protector of France and &quot;a warrior in the service of Paris&quot;, but points out that this change did not replace other images of Genevieve, but was &quot;one of the extension of [her] roles&quot;.

Scholar Maria Warner states that Genevieve &quot;benefited from the extension of taxonomy of female types&quot; like Joan of Arc; Sluhovsky adds that it was part of the new image of the female warrior that connected her with contemporary concerns, which increased in popularity during the 16th century, when &quot;France was preoccupied with military affairs&quot;. This preoccupation included, during the 16th century, 17 public rituals &quot;to implore God for the victory of the Catholic Church&quot; over Protestantism and the successful military operations associated with it. Sluhovsky states that Genevieve&#x27;s image as a warrior and protector occurred at the same time when women like Catherine de&#x27; Medici and Anne of Austria gained more political power in France. Although Genevieve was attributed with male qualities that were usually given to bishops and military leaders, the residents of Paris were aware of the fact that their patron saint was a woman. For example, her reliquary and relics were not allowed to leave her shrine unless they were accompanied, escorted, and protected by a male, Saint Marcel. Her works and miracles, such as food supply and charitable works, were associated with feminine activities, Anne of Austria invoked Genevieve for her fertility, and most of her followers were women.

=== Artistic representations ===

The most notable artistic representations of Genevieve, which continued traditions from the late Middle Ages, were created between the 17th and 19th centuries, including the frescoes of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes in the Panthéon. Several iconographic images depicting Genevieve&#x27;s water-based miracles were created during the Middle Ages, including a small bas-relief as part of her effigy in the portal of Notre-Dame, which also depicted the well in Navarre where Genevieve retrieved the water that healed her mother. A statue in the Abbey of Saint Genevieve, in the shape of a fountain, depicted her holding a candle with water flowing from the tip. Another small statue, erected inside the abbey&#x27;s shrine, near the altar, depicted her with the emblem of Paris at her feet, and holding a key to heaven and a scepter.

Genevieve is portrayed protecting Paris from a flood in a Parisian Book of Hours published in the late 1400s and her image as a fountain is included in hymnals also published in the 1400s. In the early 1400s, a mystery play was composed by her canon called the &quot;Miracles De Sainte Genevieve&quot;; it related 14 episodes in her life, including her defence of Paris, and compared her to Joan of Arc. In 1512, the poet Pierre du Pont wrote a votive poem in honour of Genevieve, which was dedicated to Phillippe Cousin, who was the abbot of Saint Genevieve Abbey. It was the first work to portray Genevieve as a shepherdess, like Joan of Arc, which even though it contradicted Genevieve&#x27;s family history and was historically inaccurate, became immediately popular in her literary and iconographic depictions. Other images created at the end of the 1600s include a large-size painting of Genevieve, which portrayed her surrounded by a flock of sheep, and an engraving by Léonard Gaultier, which included traditional medieval images of her, as well as the newer image of her as a shepherdess and warrior. By the mid-1600s, the image of Genevieve as shepherdess also appeared in the Catholic liturgy. In 1652, a book of hymns dedicated to Genevieve was published by Antoine Godeau, a poet and the bishop of Venice, that invoked water-based images, metaphors, and associations connected with Genevieve. In 1913, the early 20th-century writer, Charles Péguy, wrote a series of poems referring to 15th-century French saint Joan of Arc as a reincarnation of Genevieve . French sculptor Paul Landowski created a statue of Genevieve in 1928, which honoured her protection of Paris during World War I, at the Pont de la Tournelle.

=== Early Middle Ages ===

Many of Genevieve&#x27;s activities during the Middle Ages were similar to contemporary Gallo-Roman bishops. For example, the author of her &quot;vita&quot; compares her to Martin of Tours, who saved Worms, and Aignan of Orléans, who organised the defense of Orléans, also like Genevieve, against the Huns. She has also been compared to Leo I, who rescued Rome from Attila the same year that she diverted Attila from Paris. She also participated in the consolidation of Clovis&#x27; power and in the defeat of Arianism, and her active life in Paris occurred at the same time the city&#x27;s influence was increasing. Like other female saints, she &quot;had to assume male characteristics in order to gain influence and to resolve the contradictions between her gender and her prominence&quot;. In her &quot;vita&quot;, Germanus advised Genevieve to &quot;act manfully&quot;, and she was compared to Judith and Esther, Biblical figures who also crossed gender boundaries.

By the eighth century, a hospice for pilgrims was built next to the Basilica of the Holy Apostles; by the ninth century, the basilica was known as Saint Genevieve&#x27;s Abbey. A small canon was formed and a small abbey was built in Genevieve&#x27;s honor in the early 800s. The community was forced to flee during the Siege of Paris in 845; they brought Genevieve&#x27;s reliquary with them and hid them in Athis, Draveil, and Marizy, although they were returned to Paris in 862. According to Sluhovsky, miracles occurred at all three sites and increased her fame throughout the Ile-de-France. In 885, the residents of Paris invoked the intercession of Genevieve and other saints when Paris was besieged by the Normans; she was credited with the city&#x27;s success in repelling them. Sluhovsky states that it &quot;affirmed her role as a divine intercessor&quot;. It was also the first time that she was invocated for the city as a whole, not just for individuals who visited her shrine, and established a tradition of public invocations of Genevieve. According to Sluhovsky, the later 800s to the eleventh century was a time of rebuilding after the destruction of the abbey by the Normans, but it was also a time of growing popularity for Genevieve. Liturgical texts and hymns were written in her honor during this period.In the winter of 834, heavy rains deluged Paris; the city&#x27;s bishop encouraged the residents to fast and do penance. The only dry church where prayers could be conducted was Genevieve&#x27;s abbey, where the only dry area was floor around her deathbed, which was kept in the abbey. The waters of the Seine receded immediately. The miracle was compared to Moses&#x27; parting of the Red Sea in the Bible and her reliquary was compared to the Ark of the Covenant, which, according to Sluhovsky, authenticated Genevieve&#x27;s power. Sluhovsky states that Genevieve&#x27;s connection with water-related miracles, images, and objects were established after the invocations to her interventions were successful and were &quot;not self-evident, but rather a result of a culminative process of successful miracles ... and propagation of the saint&#x27;s role by her guardians&quot;. Most of the sources that document Genevieve&#x27;s water-based miracles and interventions were composed and complied at her abbey, during a period in which water disasters most threatened Paris. Historian Anne Lombard-Jourdan states that Genevieve was substituted for and assigned the attributes of Leucothea, the Greek marine goddess whose name might be the origin of the name of Paris.

In 997, Robert I of France donated a new altar to the basilica and Genevieve&#x27;s reliquary was moved from the crypt to the new altar. Robert the Pius became the basilica&#x27;s patron in exchange for their prayers for him and for the stability of France, an arrangement that was renewed under Henry I and Louis VI. At first, the members of St. Genevieve&#x27;s abbey followed the Rule of Chrodegang, which emphasized living in community, although cloistering and poverty were not mandatory, and obedience to the rule was lax; for example, her secular canons were able to keep the funds they received. The community was reformed by Pope Eugene II beginning in 1147.

=== High Middle Ages ===

Genevieve was called one of the most venerated saints of the early eleventh century. As Farmer states, Genevieve&#x27;s shrine &quot;was carried in procession in times of disaster&quot; during the Middle Ages and the citizens of Paris have &quot;invoked her in times of national crisis&quot; many times. In 1129, during an epidemic of ergot poisoning, which Farmer called her most famous cure, was stayed after Genevieve&#x27;s relics were carried in a public procession from her reliquary to Notre-Dame Cathedral. The city&#x27;s bishop called for the procession only after everything else had been tried, including prayers to the Virgin Mary. Genevieve&#x27;s prestige increased and a third feast day honouring her was set at November 26, in a special liturgy celebrated by the entire country. All but three of the ill who gathered at the cathedral were healed. According to Sluhovsky, this was the first time a procession with Genevieve&#x27;s reliquary took place. By the late 15th century and until 1993, the event was commemorated annually in the churches in Paris. According to Sluhovsky, the procession was &quot;purely clerical&quot; and served to connect St. Genevieve&#x27;s Abbey and Notre-Dame. In the early 1130s, a rumor, was circulated that Genevieve&#x27;s head &quot;was no longer attached to her body and was no longer in the possession of her abbey&quot;, which would have threatened both the religious and secular authority of the abbey and basilica. After an examination was conducted on January 10 by order of Louis VII, the rumor was disproven and the date was established as the feast day of the Revelation of Genevieve&#x27;s reliquary. At the end of the twelfth century, Genevieve&#x27;s basilica was rebuilt by Danish nobles to compensate for its destruction by their ancestors.

In December 1206, Genevieve was called upon to protect the city from a flood; another procession was organised and her relics were, like in 1129-1130, paraded into Paris and relics from other churches were escorted with hers. Her body was brought from the abbey to Notre-Dame, a Mass was said, and then she was returned to the abbey. The Seine receded and even though the relics and the participants in the procession crossed the Petit Pont twice and the bridge&#x27;s foundations were weakened from the threatening flood waters, it did not collapse until the reliquary was returned and no one was injured. According to Sluhovsky, by the second half of the 1200s and continuing into the early 16th century, a tradition of invoking Genevieve to protect Paris from floods was established, often as a last resort, when the prayers to other saints were ineffective.

Genevieve&#x27;s prestige, along with the power and prosperity of her community, increased through the Middle Ages. Processions were conducted annually throughout the High Middle Ages, four times per year: 3 January, her feast day; the third Sunday in Lent; on Palm Sunday; and on the Eve of the Ascension. Like most processions of the time, the processions started at Notre-Dame and ended at the appropriate religious sites, in this case, at Saint Genevieve&#x27;s Abbey. One of the yearly processions conducted in Genevieve&#x27;s honor occurred on the final day of the Rogation Days, an important three-day procession during the harvest season. The procession ended at St. Genevieve&#x27;s Abbey and connected Genevieve to Marcel of France, another saint that had saved Paris from both a dragon and from agricultural ruin. Its purpose was both agricultural and geographical, blessing the harvest and the urban space of Paris. The procession that occurred on Genevieve&#x27;s feast day was reserved only for clerics of her abbey and of Notre-Dame, without the participation of the laity, unlike most processions of the time. In 1447, Guillaume Chartier, the bishop of Paris, declared January 3 a public holiday; it was later approved by the Parliament of Paris and Genevieve was honoured in all churches in Paris.

Genevieve&#x27;s abbey was fortified and included within the city&#x27;s new walls in 1210, and a new parish church, the Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, was constructed near by. Rental fees were paid to the abbey by its parishioners, which increased the abbey&#x27;s power and financial success. A new reliquary was built at the Étienne church beginning in 1230, and Genevieve&#x27;s bones were translated there in 1242, the anniversary of her first translation during the first Norman attack of Paris. Genevieve was not the only saint who had lived in Paris and who was invoked with rituals and processions, but as Sluhovsky states, &quot;from the twelfth century on she acquired a unique position among Parisian saints&quot;.

=== Late Middle Ages ===

In 1303, the earliest known confraternity in Genevieve&#x27;s honour was formed in the Church of the Holy Innocents in Paris. Other confraternities and occupational and devotional groups were founded in Nanterre during the early modern period. In the 17th century, two confraternities existed in the Saint-Étienne-du-Mont; the second one included both men and women and had over 400 members between 1605 and 1640. Genevieve was also honoured in parishes throughout France. In 1412, King Charles VI approved the establishment of the Confraternity of the Bearers of the Reliquary of Saint Genevieve, perhaps as a way to consolidate his support in Paris and in the 1400s, a Ceremonial of Saint Genevieve, one of the oldest documents of its type, was published. It was a compilation of descriptions and instructions of all liturgical and semi-liturgical events conducted in the Abbey of St. Genevieve.

In 1525, a lay confraternity, established at Saint Genevieve&#x27;s Abbey in 1412, obtained permission from the convent&#x27;s abbot to share with its canons the ability to carry Genevieve&#x27;s reliquary during public processions. As a result, the confraternity changed its name to the Company of the Bearers of Reliquary of Sainte Geneviève and processions became its most important task. By 1545, Genevieve&#x27;s canons gave up their rights to carry her reliquary, for unclear reasons, and only the lay members of her confraternities did so. According to Sluhovsky, who called it a &quot;laicization&quot; of the ritual, the change happened at the same time that Genevieve&#x27;s invocations were becoming major civic ceremonies. Also according to Sluhovsky, who describes the regulations and practices of the Company of the Bearers of Reliquary of Sainte Geneviève up until the 18th century, members had to financially support its activities, including payments to the abbey for its clerics to perform Masses for them. As of the late 20th century, the Company was still in existence in Paris and continued to carry Genevieve&#x27;s reliquary in an annual procession held during her octave. The processions, conducted by the elderly male members and assisted by its female members, occurred inside the Church of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, where a small reliquary that was created during the 19th century, after the larger one was destroyed during the French Revolution, and which still exists.

=== 16th century ===
Beginning in 1535 and through 1652, appeals to Genevieve &quot;were always highly politicized&quot; and included attempts to both impose and oppose royal authority. On January 21, 1535, Genevieve&#x27;s reliquary took part in &quot;a major supplicatory procession&quot; to invoke God against the Protestants in France. It was one of the largest and most spectacular religious processions that occurred in Paris and was ordered by King Francis I. According to Sluhovsky, the reliquary of Genevieve, the Eucharist, and the king&#x27;s presence symbolised the urban, the Catholic, and the national identities of the French, all of which &quot;joined together to undo the harm of fragmentation and discord, symbolised by Protestantism&quot;. Sluhovsky also states that the procession presented new relationships between the identities and symbols, as demonstrated in the new route of the procession, which started at Notre-Dame, paused at the royal church of Saint-Germain-l&#x27;Auxerrois near the Louvre, and ended back at Notre-Dame. It was the first time a procession marched in the commercial section of the Paris, connecting the royal church, the royal palace of the Louvre, and Notre-Dame; it was the first time that Genevieve&#x27;s reliquary crossed the Seine to the Right Bank and made a statement that the city&#x27;s unity depended upon royal authority.

In 1535, Genevieve&#x27;s cult became connected to the cult of Corpus Christi, which was included in what Sluhovsky called the &quot;royal religion of early modern French absolutism&quot; because the throne appropriated and changed it to support its authority and power in France. Sluhovsky goes on to say, &quot;By parading the reliquary of the patron saint on a route which led from the royal parish to the cathedral, and by employing Sainte Geneviève to honor her superiors, a new balance of political powers in the city derive not from the patronage of Sainte Geneviève but from the powers of the Host and the king&quot;. In the summer of 1549, Genevieve&#x27;s reliquary was involved in a royal supplicatory procession, which crossed the Seine to the Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis and then to Notre-Dame; it included the burning of heretics. In 1551, 1568, and 1582, her reliquary processed from the Sainte-Chapelle to Notre-Dame instead of from her abbey, where it was used during royal invocations against the Protestants. As Sluhovsky states, &quot;The redrawing of the Catholic space of Paris strengthened royal authority in the urban space, a royal authority that demanded clear demonstrations of compliance and humility from the city, just as it demanded and obtained them from Sainte Geneviève&quot;. These processions broke the tradition of bringing the reliquary and relics of Saint Marcel to Genevieve&#x27;s abbey before processing to Notre-Dame; instead, it required that her reliquary &quot;humbled itself&quot; to honour the Eucharist and the king. It was also the first time her reliquary was not the most prestigious part in a public ritual.

In 1562, two processions were held to cleanse Paris from the heresy of Protestantism. The first procession ended at Saint Genevieve&#x27;s Abbey and in the second, Genevieve&#x27;s reliquary was carried by 20 barefoot laymen wearing flowers on their heads and was received with enthusiasm from the public. Sluhovsky considered the processions as a reaffirmation of the Eucharist and of Genevieve&#x27;s part in how the Catholic authorities in Paris handled the divisions caused by the French Wars of Religion, between Catholics and the Huguenot Protestants. In 1589, processions were held and Genevieve was invoked in well-organised responses to conflict between King Henry III, the House of Guise, and the Catholic League. It was the first time that the public invoked Genevieve against the king. As Sluhovsky states, &quot;the Feast of Saint Genevieve became a feast of hatred and division, not of harmony and peace&quot;. Sluhovosky also states that for the first time, invocations of Genevieve changed from demonstrations of loyalty to public demonstrations of revolt and disloyalty to the king. In 1591, the royal army besieged Paris; an attack on the army, led by Chevalier d&#x27;Aumale, was planned to occur on Genevieve&#x27;s feast day. Prayers were made at her shrine as the fighting happened, but the attack failed and D&#x27;Aumale was killed. Sluhovsky reported that the failure decreased the city&#x27;s devotion toward Genevieve; he called their accusations against her &quot;not unfounded&quot;. Two more supplicatory processions occurred in 1594, but it also failed; Sluhovsky states that they demonstrated the &quot;authorities&#x27; inability to control the public cult of Sainte Geneviève&quot;.

During the 1560s and 1570s and throughout the latter half of the 16th century, Genevieve was invoked for assistance during famines and food shortages, both in Paris and its outlying areas. Her invocations against water-based disasters, which influenced the country&#x27;s crop yields, began to include &quot;all sorts of agricultural and meteorological exigencies&quot;. As Sluhovsky stated, Genevieve &quot;gradually became the patron saint of subsistence, the supplier of grain to the city&quot;. Beginning in the late 1500s, most of the processions with her reliquary occurred during the spring and early summer harvest months; in the previous centuries they occurred during the fall and winter, when the Seine was likely to flood. The response to all the major climate disasters of the 17th and 18th centuries were public invocations of Genevieve&#x27;s interventions. Sluhovsky called this image of Genevieve &quot;the nurturing patron&quot; and considered it a feminization of her image at a time when women&#x27;s roles were changing and becoming more restrictive, and when several canons took her as their patron saint, including novices to the Carmelite order in Paris. Genevieve&#x27;s connection with charity, caring for the poor, and food relief, which continued to occur during the late 1600s, were based upon events during her life and was also expressed with processions of her reliquary and reports of her distribution of food to the poor in 1665. Other processions included one in 1556, in response to a drought throughout France, when peasants organized a procession to numerous shrines throughout Paris, including Genevieve&#x27;s, when they were joined by city residents &quot;in spontaneous public invocations of the patron&quot;.

=== 17th century ===
In 1619, François de La Rochefoucauld, a cardinal and confidant of Richelieu, was appointed abbot of Saint Genevieve&#x27;s Abbey, which became the new headquarters of the Congregation of France and the center of monastic reform; by 1650, one-third of all monastic communities in France were included in the congregation. In 1649, when Paris was again engaged in open rebellion against the king, Genevieve appeared to Anne of Austria, the mother of King Louis XIV, in a vision after Anne invoked her for peace and the protection of the Paris people, even though many had just rebelled against her. The vision gave a different interpretation of a miracle that had occurred during Genevieve&#x27;s lifetime; another depiction of another vision of the same miracle was distributed using the printing press, the first time it was used to recruit Genevieve &quot;into oppositional political propaganda&quot;. Both visions used Genevieve&#x27;s prestige to &quot;articulate contemporary public opinions and sentiments&quot;. In 1652, additional entreatments and processions were called in response to the Fronde and the food shortages it caused. According to Sluhovsky, traditional veneration of Genevieve had &quot;given way to manipulation&quot; and after 1652, &quot;all public invocations would be confronted with wide public cynicism and skepticism&quot;.
By the 17th century, public invocations of Genevieve, even though their liturgies remained the same, changed from clerical affairs to secular public celebrations. Sluhovsky calls the clerical-based processions &quot;ordinary&quot; and the later popular entreatments and processions of the saint &quot;extraordinary&quot;. Ordinary processions honoured Genevieve, legitimised her &quot;unique position in the hierarchy of the sacred in Paris&quot;, established the route, between Notre-Dame and her shrine, of the processions, and solidified the &quot;reciprocal relationship&quot; between the cathedral and the shrine. Ordinary processions were based on the calendar and were marches from city to the shrine outside the city, while extraordinary processions and invocations were called during emergencies and were carried into Paris, for the city. At first, extraordinary processions were religious events and controlled by the clergy, but by 1631, Paris&#x27; secular authorities ordered and planned them. As Sluhovsky states, &quot;Religious and secular bodies now shared the responsibility of organizing invocations, determining their dates, mobilizing the city, and guarding the reliquaries&quot;. Sluhovsky goes on to state that the new, extraordinary processions and invocations were a combination of Masses and celebrations of urban pride, and focused on processions to and from Genevieve&#x27;s shrine. The later processions, according to Sluhovsky, turned into urban moveable feasts and emphasised the growing power of the city&#x27;s elites and government officials. He states, &quot;The religious austerity that characterized the invocations of the thirteenth century and of late medieval Paris, with its emphasis on penance and contrition, was replaced by the contradictory expressions of supplication and triumphalism&quot;. Theologians and preachers criticised the new forms for becoming spectacles, called for a return to older models, and speculated that Genevieve would no longer grant the people&#x27;s invocations because they no longer made their requests to her sincerely.

In the early 17th century, many religious ceremonies were secularized, which required a remaking of Genevieve&#x27;s cult. The Bourbons appropriated and incorporated it into their royal rites, ending traditional forms of her veneration, creating new ones, and provided her with the new role of protecting the royal family. According to Sluhovsky, these changes also &quot;distanced humble Parisian believers from direct communication with their saint&quot;. Despite this, however, Genevieve maintained her prominence and her followers&#x27; loyalty to her did not decline. In 1764, in what Sluhovsky calls &quot;the most significant event in the history of royal involvement with the cult of Sainte Geneviève&quot;, King Louis XV began construction of a new church, which later became the Panthéon, in her honour, ending over 200 years of royal patronage of her and financial support of her abbey and churches.

For example, Anne of Austria not only financially supported Saint Genevieve&#x27;s Abbey, she also supported the small church dedicated to Genevieve in Nanterre, where Anne made yearly pilgrimages and founded a seminary there in 1642. In 1658, Genevieve was invoked to heal Anne; no procession was called, but Genevieve&#x27;s reliquary was removed, and Anne recovered from her illness. Two years later, however, Anne fell ill again and a similar ceremony was held, but it did not work this time and Anne died during the invocation. Genevieve&#x27;s reliquary was removed 50 more times in the next 100 years, 33 times for the health of members of the French royal family. According to Sluhovsky, by the 17th century, &quot;The shepherdess from Nanterre that Parisians had invoked a thousand years as a humble neighbor became ... a royal courtier&quot;. Saint Genevieve&#x27;s Church began to be rebuilt in 1746 because it had decayed; as Farmer states, it &quot;was secularized at the Revolution and was called the Panthéon, a burial place for the worthies of France&quot;.

In 1694, for example, Paris was in the middle of a severe economic crisis, with poor harvests, bad weather, threats of starvation, and an ongoing war, so the residents of Paris and the Ile-de-France invoked Genevieve&#x27;a intervention. Spontaneous processions and pilgrimages to Saint Genevieve&#x27;s abbey started in early May, before an official proclamation allowed both clerics and lay people to participate. At first, invocations were made at the abbey, but it was not enough to improve the weather, so a public procession was called for on May 27. According to Sluhovsky, the poor, who were most affected by the food shortage, were allowed to participate to serve &quot;social and political goals&quot;. Sluhovsky states, &quot;By mobilizing the &#x27;deserving poor&#x27; to invoke the saint, the organizers made God and the saint accountable for the food shortage, thus preventing the poor from holding the authorities themselves responsible&quot;. Also according to Sluhovsky, &quot;The procession led to the expected results&quot;. Rain began immediately after the procession began, saving the country&#x27;s crops, and other miracles occurred, including a victory against Spain, healings from paralysis, and the decrease in the price of wheat. The government of Paris commissioned a painting commemorating the event by Nicolas de Largillière. According to Sluhovsky, &quot;An entire day of communal mobilization replaced the austere early morning processions of the late Middle Ages&quot;. The event was criticised, despite its popularity, for changing the processions into secular events.

=== 18th century and French Revolution ===
In 1725, Genevieve was invoked amidst religious and political conflict, which as Sluhovsky states, &quot;had an impact on the ability of lay Parisians to maintain their traditional forms of devotion&quot;. Sluhovsky adds that the emotions the royal appropriation of Genevieve caused during the 1720s to the 1750s were motivated by Paris&#x27; deep attachment to Catholicism. In 1744, King Louis XV became ill in Lorraine during the War of the Austrian Succession; he invoked Genevieve, was healed, and made a pilgrimage to her shrine. The abbot and canons showed the king the church, which was deteriorated, and the king pledged to finance its renovation, which totaled over 25,000 livres. The construction was completed in 1764, when Louis XV laid the church&#x27;s cornerstone. The project was criticised for being too expensive and unnecessary, and for the misuse of funds that could have been used for public relief. Sluhovsky called the building project the &quot;beginning of one of the most important transformations of the cult since the construction of the original basilica in the sixth century&quot;. Genevieve was continued to be invoked by the royals throughout the 1700s, but the citizens of Paris often opposed and ridiculed them. The opposition of the royal appropriation of Genevieve occurred at the same time Protestants and Paris elites, including Voltaire, began to criticise Catholic practices such as the cult of the saints. The appropriation of Genevieve by the monarchy did not decrease the people&#x27;s devotion to her during this time, even when processions stopped and invocations to her were made for the royal family during the late 18th century. She regularly appeared in the popular religious literature of the time. By the late 18th century, lay devotion to her was no longer controlled by municipal or royal authorities. During the French Revolution, she was used &quot;against the very same establishments which in previous centuries had been intimately connected with [her] cult&quot;. In July 1789, Saint Genevieve&#x27;s Church was used to celebrate the Revolution, although the Revolutionary authorities eventually ended her cult. Genevieve&#x27;s shrine and relics were mostly destroyed during the French Revolution, but as Farmer states, &quot;this by no means finished her cult in France&quot;.

In April 1791, after the death of Mirabeau, the early French Revolutionary leader, the French government secularised the Church of Saint Genevieve and turned it into a national monument and shrine honouring him. It ended an over 1,000-year period in which the building served as the center of Genevieve&#x27;s cult, as well as the religious traditions centering on her processions. Also in 1791, the ashes of Voltaire were transferred to the church, which was renamed the Panthéon. Despite the secularisation the transfer implied, Voltaire had a devotion to Genevieve and was proud of his grandfather&#x27;s membership in the Company of the Bearers of Reliquary of Sainte Geneviève. On his deathbed, Voltaire renewed his devotion to her. According to Sluhovsky, the building &quot;became a temple of the new deities of the Enlightenment&quot; and &quot;a temple of civic liberty&quot;. He also called it &quot;a turning point in the history of the monument&quot;; the same time Voltaire&#x27;s remains were transferred, Genevieve&#x27;s remains were moved out of the church and into another part of the abbey. A year later, in 1792, after the monarchy&#x27;s fall, Saint Genevieve&#x27;s Abbey was secularised and confiscated, and despite the protests of hundreds of nearby residents, her remains were transferred again, to the Saint-Étienne-du-Mont. Sluhovsky reports that Paris residents opposed the secularisation of Genevieve&#x27;s shrine. In 1793, at the beginning of the Reign of Terror, her reliquary was brought to the Hôtel des Monnaies and dismantled; the funds collected were put into the government&#x27;s treasury. According to Sluhovsky, Genevieve&#x27;s bones were put on trial, found guilty of collaborating with the royal authorities, and condemned to be publicly burned at the Place de Greve. Her ashes were then thrown into the Seine.

=== Post-Revolution to Modernity ===
In 1803, after the end of the Revolution, Genevieve&#x27;s cult was revived by Napoleon at the Saint-Étienne-du-Mont. New fragments of her relics were brought to Paris from other churches and a new reliquary was built. In 1806, Napoleon ordered that the Panthéon be returned to its original purpose. In 1822, Louis XVIII founded a new Church of Saint Genevieve on the grounds of the Panthéon and she was reinstated as the patron saint of Paris. In 1831. A portion of Genevieve&#x27;s stone tomb currently resides in a large casket in the church; a smaller reliquary contains the bones of one finger. Louis Phillippe I reinstated the building to a secular temple and Genevieve&#x27;s relics were sent to Notre-Dame, but Napoleon III reinstated it as a church in 1851. Genevieve&#x27;s relics, which survived the Revolution and were stored in churches outside of Paris, are stored in a reliquary at the Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, in her chapel.

According to Sluhovsky, Genevieve&#x27;s cult experienced renewed popularity when she represented Catholic opposition to Republicanism. She was invoked to save France during World War I and a procession carrying her relics occurred to prevent the German occupation of France during World War II. Also according to Sluhovsky, although Genevieve remains as the patron saint of Paris, her cult has never returned to its pre-Revolutionary popularity and unifying status.

<text>John Wesley Glasscock (July 22, 1857 – February 24, 1947) was an American shortstop in Major League Baseball who played for several teams from 1879 to 1895. Nicknamed &quot;Pebbly Jack&quot;, he was the top player at his position in the 1880s during the sport&#x27;s bare-handed era. He led the National League in fielding percentage seven times and in assists six times; he was the only shortstop to lead in fielding percentage and total chances in a season three different times until Luis Aparicio matched him. Ozzie Smith eventually surpassed Glasscock&#x27;s marks in the 1980s; Glasscock also led the NL in double plays four times and in putouts twice. He won the 1890 batting title with a .336 average for the New York Giants and led the league in hits twice; in his final season he became the sixth major league player to make 2,000 hits. He was the first player to appear in over 600 games as a shortstop, and ended his career with major league records for games (1,628), putouts (2,821), assists (5,630), total chances (9,283), double plays (620) and fielding percentage (.910) at the position. When he retired he ranked fifth in major league history in games (1,736) and at bats (7,030), seventh in total bases (2,630) and eighth in doubles (313).

==Early life==
Jack Glasscock was born in Wheeling, West Virginia (then Virginia), to Thomas Glasscock (born 1830) and the former Julia Collette (born 1833), and dropped out of school in fourth grade to pursue his father&#x27;s trade of carpentry. Nicknamed &quot;Pebbly Jack&quot; for his habit of scrutinizing the infield for small stones, typically pocketing them, the practice helped him to avoid the bad-hop ground balls which more regularly afflicted other infielders; fielding averages of the era rarely exceeded .900 among shortstops. He played for the local Standard club in 1876, the Champion City club of Springfield, Ohio, in 1877, and the Pittsburgh Allegheny Base Ball Club of the International Association in 1878, the latter at third base. After Allegheny folded, he finished the season with Cleveland Blues.

==Major league career==
He broke into the National League with that club in 1879, the first West Virginian in the majors, playing 80 games. After playing second and third bases as a rookie, he switched to shortstop permanently in 1880 with Fred Dunlap taking over at second. In 1881 he led the NL in putouts (105), assists (274) and fielding average (.911) for the first time. Over five seasons with the team he gradually improved his hitting, and in 1882 he was among the league&#x27;s top ten players in home runs (4), doubles (27), slugging average (.450) and total bases (161) while also leading the league in assists (311) and tying Sadie Houck&#x27;s major league record of 40 double plays, set the previous year; Frank Fennelly set a new major league mark with 46 for the 1885 Cincinnati Red Stockings in the American Association. In 1883, batting third, Glasscock led the team in runs batted in, and paced the NL in fielding again with a .922 average. In mid-1884 he jumped to the Cincinnati Outlaw Reds of the Union Association during that league&#x27;s only season of play and batted .419 in 38 games.

He returned to the NL with the St. Louis Maroons for the next two years, becoming team captain. In 1885 he set an NL record for assists (397), breaking Arthur Irwin&#x27;s 1880 mark of 339, and led the league in fielding average (.917); he also moved ahead of Davy Force to become the major league career leader in games at shortstop. In 1886 he hit .325 and was fifth in the league in doubles and sixth in hits, also breaking his own NL record with 43 double plays and again leading the NL in assists (392) and fielding (.906). The Maroons moved to Indianapolis and became the Indianapolis Hoosiers before the 1887, and Glasscock continued his solid output in Indianapolis with a .294 average that year. He also set new major league records for assists (493) and double plays (58), topping Fennelly&#x27;s totals of 485 and 54 with the previous year&#x27;s Red Stockings. Ollie Beard broke his major league assists mark with 537 for the 1889 Red Stockings, and Bob Allen set a new NL mark with 500 for the 1890 Philadelphia Phillies. Glasscock led the league in fielding (.901) again in 1888, and would later break his own NL double play record with 60 in 1889, though Beard set a new major league mark with 63 the same year; Allen broke the NL mark with 68 in 1890.

1889 marked Glasscock&#x27;s top all-around season as he batted .352 – second in the NL behind Dan Brouthers, and the best average by a major league shortstop prior to 1893, when the pitching distance was increased to – and led the league in hits (205). He was second in doubles (40, behind King Kelly) and total bases (272, behind Jimmy Ryan), and was fifth in the league with a career-high 128 runs. Furthermore, he led the league in every defensive category (246 putouts, 478 assists, 60 double plays, .915 average). His 246 putouts set a new NL record, breaking John Montgomery Ward&#x27;s 1887 major league record of 226 (Herman Long had 335 for the 1889 American Association Kansas City Cowboys); Bob Allen would also break this record just a year later. Glasscock hit for the cycle on August 8 of that year; he also managed the team for the last half of the season, posting a 34–32 record. Early in the year, he discovered 17-year-old future Hall of Famer Amos Rusie pitching for a local semi-pro team, and the young hurler was promptly acquired for Indianapolis.

When the Hoosiers folded after the 1889 season, his contract – as well as Rusie&#x27;s – was awarded to the Giants to replace Ward, who was leading many of the sport&#x27;s top players in a shift to the Players&#x27; League for the 1890 season. Glasscock had been intending to switch leagues as well but was expelled from the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players after signing his 1890 contract with Indianapolis. He won the 1890 batting championship by eleven points over Billy Hamilton, going 6-for-6 on September 27; he also became the second player to lead the NL in hits two years in a row (joining Brouthers), and was second in doubles to Sam Thompson and fifth in total bases. His offensive totals dropped off in later seasons, partially as a result of an 1891 hand injury. When the American Association merged with the NL prior to the 1892 season, Glasscock shifted to the St. Louis Browns (the team now known as the Cardinals), hitting .241 and .267 in two full seasons; he also managed the team for the first four games of the 1892 season, going 1–3. In June 1893 he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates, and he hit .341 over the remainder of the year, finishing with a .320 average and also with 100 RBI for the first time. The team finished only five games out of first place, the closest he would come to a league title during his major league career. He batted .280 in his last full season in 1894, leading the NL in fielding for the last time with a .933 average, and ended his major league career in 1895, splitting the year between the Louisville Colonels and the Washington Senators.

Glasscock left the major leagues with a .290 career batting average, 2,040 hits, 27 home runs, 1163 runs, 825 runs batted in and 98 triples. His batting average was nearly thirty points higher than the league average of the time, and he ranked eighth all-time in hits when he retired. He was one of the most difficult players of the 19th century to strike out, doing so just once in every 33 at bats. He played a notable role in the advancement of defensive tactics, being one of the first shortstops to use signals indicating which infielder would cover second base on steal attempts, and also one of the first to back up throws to the second baseman. Germany Smith broke his records for career assists and total chances in 1897, and his mark for games at shortstop in 1898. Herman Long broke his record for putouts in 1898, and his mark for double plays in . Tommy Corcoran bettered his career fielding percentage by the end of the 19th century. Despite his talents, he received only 2.6% of the vote on his first and only ballot on the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1936.

==&quot;Charley horse&quot;==
Some sources credit Glasscock as the originator of the term Charley horse.

==Later life==
Glasscock returned to Wheeling and played on a minor league team run by Ed Barrow, winning the first pennant of his career; he remained in the minor leagues as a first baseman until 1901, winning an 1896 batting title with a .431 average. After his baseball career ended, he returned to carpentry. He died in Wheeling from a stroke at age 89 in 1947 and is buried in Wheeling&#x27;s Greenwood Cemetery.

<doc id="890761" wikidata="Q3332038" url="?curid=890761" title="Z-level programming language">
<text>Z-level Programming Language is an array programming language designed to replace C and C++ programming languages in engineering and scientific applications. Because its design goal was to obtain cross-platform high performance, ZPL programs run fast on both sequential and parallel computers. Highly-parallel ZPL programs are simple and easy to write because it exclusively uses implicit parallelism.

Originally called Orca C, ZPL was designed and implemented during 1993–1995 by the Orca Project of the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Washington.

==Details==
ZPL uses the array abstraction to implement a data parallel programming model. This is the reason why ZPL achieves such good performance: having no parallel directives or other forms of explicit parallelism, ZPL exploits the operational trait that when aggregate computations are described in terms of arrays, many scalar operations must be (implicitly) performed to implement the array operations. This &quot;implied&quot; computation can be automatically allotted to different processors to achieve concurrency: Parallelism arises from the semantics of the array operations.

ZPL is translated into a conventional abstract syntax tree representation on which program analysis and program optimizations are performed. ANSI C code is generated as the object code. This C program (which is machine independent because it implements certain operations in abstract form) is then compiled using the native C compiler on the target machine with custom libraries optimized to the specific platform.

The creators of ZPL were: Brad Chamberlain, Sung-Eun Choi, E Christopher Lewis, Calvin Lin, Jason Secosky, Larry Snyder, and W. Derrick Weathersby with assistance from Ruth Anderson, A.J. Bernheim, Marios Dikaiakos, George Forman, and Kurt Partridge.

<text>Wing Commander Andrew Duncan Green (born 30 July 1962) is a retired British Royal Air Force fighter pilot and world land speed record holder since 1997, the first land speed record to break the sound barrier.

== Early life ==
He was born in Atherstone, Warwickshire. Green&#x27;s family moved to Hartlepool in the 1970s when his father was appointed chief fire officer of the local fire brigade. Green originally attended High Tunstall School before moving to Marske-by-the-Sea and beginning study at Bydales Comprehensive School. Green later moved to Kent with his family, where he studied at St. Olave&#x27;s Grammar School in Orpington. While at a car show in Hartlepool at a young age, Green decided that he would be interested in a career within the military.

==RAF career==
Green gained an RAF scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1983 with first class honours in mathematics. He qualified as a fighter pilot on F-4 Phantom and Tornado F3 aircraft. In 2003 Green was promoted to Wing Commander. He later became Officer Commanding Operations Wing at RAF Wittering near Peterborough. Green was the captain of the RAF team at the Cresta Run, where he used an experimental French toboggan and held the Inter-Services record for a number of years.

In his capacity as an RAF officer, he has served in West Germany, Iraq, Bosnia and Afghanistan.

==Speed records==
===Supersonic===
Green is the current holder of the world land speed record, and the only person ever to break the sound barrier on land. On 25 September 1997 in ThrustSSC he beat the previous record in Black Rock Desert, US, reaching a speed of . On 15 October 1997, 50 years and 1 day after the sound barrier was broken in aerial flight by Chuck Yeager, Green reached , the first supersonic record (Mach 1.016). His call sign was &quot;Dead Dog&quot;. As the vehicle exceeded the speed of sound it created a sonic boom.

Green was working on a new record attempt to break the mark with &quot;Bloodhound LSR&quot; but stepped down from the driver position for the project in November 2023.

===Road car===
His next land speed attempt was intended to be for MG in a specially modified MG F called the MG EX255; however, due to the time required for modifications, the project did not finish on time and that attempt never happened.

===Diesel power===
Since then, Green&#x27;s most recent challenge was the driving of the JCB Dieselmax car, attempting to take the Diesel Land Speed Record over . Having tested the vehicle on his own RAF base, Wittering, on 22 August 2006, he broke the previous record of (set in August 1973), after attaining an average speed of during two runs on the Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah. Twenty four hours later, Green broke his own record, achieving a speed of on 23 August 2006.

==Honours and awards==
He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1998 New Year Honours. He was awarded the Segrave Trophy by the Royal Automobile Club in 1997. In 2006 he was awarded the John Cobb Trophy by the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club for &quot;a success of outstanding character&quot; and an Honorary degree from Staffordshire University in July 2008.

==Racing experience==
On 14 June 2009 Green gained his first circuit racing experience, whilst raising money for the &quot;Bloodhound SSC&quot; project, by participating in Round 4 of the Elise Trophy at Snetterton.

<text>CSKA (Bulgarian: &quot;ЦСКА&quot;) was a Bulgarian sports society from Sofia, Bulgaria. CSKA stands for Central Sports Club of the Army (). It was founded on 5 May 1948 as Septemvri pri CDV, after the unification of the two sports clubs from the city, Chavdar and Septemvri. Since then, the club changed its name several times before settling on CSKA in 1989.

The club is historically known as the Bulgarian Army sports club. Currently the sports club&#x27;s departments are autonomous and are separated as of 1992. Therefore, the only connection of the departments to the Army are the historical traditions and the Bulgarian Army Stadium. Nevertheless, in the moment all of the clubs who have a connection to the sports society are incorporated into one joint society called United Sports Clubs CSKA, which is currently а successor of the previous disbanded organization.

Currently sections which belong to &quot;CSKA Sofia&quot; are football, basketball, volleyball, tennis, wrestling, athletics, ice hockey, chess, gymnastics, handball, taekwondo, boxing, weightlifting, judo, cycling, and rowing.

<doc id="890771" wikidata="Q6981908" url="?curid=890771" title="Naval Reserve Medal">
<text>The Naval Reserve Medal (NRM) was a decoration of the United States Navy which was created by order of Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson on 12 September 1938. The medal was first issued in 1938 and was an active award until 1958. On 12 September 1958, the Naval Reserve Medal was declared discontinued and was replaced by the Armed Forces Reserve Medal. It is not to be confused with the Naval Reserve Meritorious Service Medal which is a different award that was discontinued on 1 January 2014.

The Naval Reserve Medal was awarded to any commissioned officer or enlisted member of United States Naval Reserve (USNR), the associated National Naval Volunteers, and local naval militia units of the period. To be awarded the decoration, a service member was required to perform ten years of continuous service in one of the aforementioned components in either an active duty, drilling reservist, or inactive status.

An additional award of the NRM is denoted by a service star. The United States Marine Corps equivalent to the award is the Marine Corps Reserve Ribbon. The Naval Reserve Medal originally held precedence just below that of the Navy Good Conduct Medal which, in turn, held precedence just below unit awards. Sometime after 1958, the precedence of the Naval Reserve Medal was moved to rank just below the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, making it the lowest ranking medal awarded by the United States Armed Forces aside from the Navy and Coast Guard expert marksmanship medals.

As the NRM was only available for exactly 20 years, and required 10 years of USNR service, no sailor could possibly receive more than two. Additionally, with World War II (WW II) pulling the vast majority of Naval Reservists into active duty the Regular Navy, the number of sailors to receive two NRMs is very low, with all two-time recipients having had to serve a total of 20 years in the Naval Reserve between September 1938 and September 1958, e.g., before, during and after WW II. Therefore, most one-time recipients served in the USNR after WW II in the 1946-1958 window.

<doc id="890772" wikidata="Q5110011" url="?curid=890772" title="Christian Patriot movement">
<text>The Christian Patriot movement is a subset of the broader American Patriot movement that promotes Christian nationalism and emphasizes it as its core goal and philosophy. Like the larger Patriot movement, it promotes an interpretation of American history in which the federal government has turned against the ideas of liberty and natural rights expressed in the American Revolution.

==Ideology==
The movement originally referred to the Posse Comitatus, a far-right militia organization. The Posse Comitatus followed an ideology based on the teachings of William Potter Gale, who was also a Christian Identity minister. This ideology holds the view that state and federal governments are agents of an arcane conspiracy to deprive Americans of their rights as &quot;sovereign citizens.&quot; It also holds the view that this conspiracy can be undermined through various legal pleadings from English common law and other sources, such as a motion protesting the way a defendant&#x27;s name is typeset in a legal complaint.
The ideology persists despite numerous court rulings that have declared its theories frivolous.

==Status==
The movement grew during the 1990s after the Ruby Ridge and Waco Sieges appeared to confirm the suspicions of Christian Patriots. The movement maintained its ties with the American militia movement of the same period. A highly publicized federal confrontation with Christian Patriots occurred in 1996, when Federal marshals arrested the Montana Freemen.

In 2009, the Southern Poverty Law Center said that militia groups may be experiencing a &quot;Patriot revival.&quot;

<text>Wheaties is an American brand of breakfast cereal that is made by General Mills. It is well known for featuring prominent athletes on its packages and has become a cultural icon in the United States. Originally introduced as Washburn&#x27;s Gold Medal Whole Wheat Flakes in 1924, it is primarily a wheat and bran mixture baked into flakes.

== History ==

=== Creation ===

Wheaties was created in 1921, as a result of an accidental spill of a wheat bran mixture onto a hot stove by a Minnesota clinician working for the Washburn Crosby Company (later General Mills). By November 1924, after more than 36 attempts to strengthen the flakes to withstand packaging, the process for creating the flakes had been perfected by the Washburn head miller, George Cormack, and the cereal was named &quot;Washburn&#x27;s Gold Medal Whole Wheat Flakes&quot;. Soon after, the name was changed to Wheaties as a result of an employee contest won by Jane Bausman, the wife of a company export manager. Other names passed over included &quot;Nutties&quot; and &quot;Gold Medal Wheat Flakes.&quot;

Wheaties began to be advertised on Minneapolis&#x27;s WCCO radio station (owned by Washburn Crosby) on December 24, 1926, with the first-ever pre-recorded commercial jingle. Its lyrics were sung to the tune of the then-popular &quot;She&#x27;s a Jazz Baby&quot; by Bill Holcombe and David Miller or possibly to the tune of &quot;Jazz Baby&quot;:

=== Early sports association ===

Wheaties began its association with sports in 1927, through advertising on the southern wall of minor league baseball&#x27;s Nicollet Park in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In the contract, Wheaties sponsored the radio broadcasts of the minor league baseball team, Minneapolis Millers, on radio station WCCO and Wheaties was provided with a large billboard in the park to use to introduce new slogans. The first such slogan on the new signboard was penned by Knox Reeves, of a Minneapolis advertising agency. When asked what should be placed on the sign for Wheaties, Reeves sketched a Wheaties box on a pad of paper, thought for a moment, and wrote &quot;Wheaties—The Breakfast of Champions&quot;.

Throughout the 1930s, Wheaties increased in popularity with its sponsorship of baseball broadcasting, and by the end of the decade, nearly a hundred radio stations carried Wheaties sponsored events. During these events, athlete testimonials about Wheaties were used to demonstrate that Wheaties was indeed the breakfast of champions. In 1934, athletes began to be depicted on the Wheaties boxes, starting with baseball star Lou Gehrig, and the tradition continues today.

The heyday of Wheaties came in the 1930s and early 1940s, as testimonials peaked from nearly every sport imaginable. Among the many testimonials included were: baseball stars, managers, and trainers; broadcasters; football stars and coaches; circus stars and rodeo; livestock breeders; a railroad engineer; horsemen and jockeys; a big-game hunter; automobile racers; an aviator; a speedboat driver; an explorer; and parachutists.

Wheaties maintained brand recognition through its definitive association with sports, and its distinctive orange boxes. It became so popular that in the 1939 All-star game, 46 of the 51 players endorsed the cereal. In the months following, Wheaties became one of the sponsors of the first televised sports broadcast to allow commercials. On August 29, 1939, NBC television presented the first major league baseball game ever televised between the Cincinnati Reds and the Brooklyn Dodgers to approximately 500 television set owners in New York City over experimental station W2XBS (now WNBC). Red Barber was the play-by-play broadcaster. Although full commercial television would not be authorized until July 1, 1941, the FCC allowed commercials to be inserted in this particular, special event broadcast as a test. Barber had to ad-lib three live commercials, one for each Dodger sponsor. For Procter &amp; Gamble, he held up a bar of Ivory Soap. For Socony, Barber put on a Mobil gas station cap and raised a can of oil. For General Mills, he poured Wheaties into a bowl, added milk and sugar on top (some reports say he also sliced a banana), then proclaimed &quot;Now that&#x27;s the breakfast of champions.&quot; &quot;There was not a cue card in sight&quot;, Barber said.

A measure of the product&#x27;s familiarity is the reference in the 1941 baseball song &quot;Joltin&#x27; Joe DiMaggio&quot;, performed by Les Brown and his orchestra during DiMaggio&#x27;s record hitting streak. In the song, DiMaggio gets a clutch base hit, and the band awards him &quot;a case of Wheaties&quot;.

=== Ties with Ronald Reagan ===

Wheaties radio broadcasting in the 1930s touched the early career of Ronald Reagan, who was at the time a sports broadcast announcer in Des Moines, Iowa. He was asked to create play-by-play recreations of Chicago Cubs baseball games using transcribed telegraph reports; his job performance in this role led to his selection in 1937 as the most popular Wheaties announcer in the nation. He was awarded an all-expenses-paid trip to the Cubs&#x27; spring training camp in California, and while there he took a Warner Bros. screen test. This led to his eventual film career; thus the Wheaties claim of perhaps leading Reagan into show business, and later politics as governor of California and 40th President of the United States.

=== Changes and children&#x27;s promotions ===

Due to increasing costs in the 1940s of sponsorship of broadcasting, Wheaties began simple commercial sports testimonials on television or radio. These were less effective than the overall sponsorship (especially in the case of television), yet also greatly reduced costs for advertising of the product.

In the early 1950s, General Mills redirected its promotional strategy for Wheaties to focus on children, following its great success in this market with its Cheerios brand. The strategy included sponsorship of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; and &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, as well as the development of a mascot, a puppet character called Champy the Lion, produced by Bil Baird and voiced by Thurl Ravenscroft. Despite these efforts, sales of Wheaties declined dramatically, mainly due to adult consumers&#x27; dislike of so-called children&#x27;s cereals. Children&#x27;s consumption of Wheaties did in fact increase, but not enough to offset the decline in adult consumption.

=== Return of sports-related promotions ===

In 1958, General Mills decided to combat the decline in sales by returning Wheaties to its sporting roots. A three-pronged marketing strategy was devised. The first element was the selection of the brand&#x27;s first spokesman, Bob Richards, two-time Olympic pole vault champion. The second was the reentry of Wheaties into the sports television sponsorship arena, pioneering the concepts of the pre-game and post-game show. The third was the creation of the Wheaties Sports Federation. The Wheaties Sports Federation promoted physical fitness, training, and participation in athletic events, through direct financial support of Olympic educational programs and the Jaycee Junior Champ track and field competition, and also through educational and instructional athletic films.

From the 1960s through the 1990s, Wheaties provided in-box promotions but maintained a focus on athletic fitness and on-the-box sports figure promotions. Since the debut of the front cover depiction of Bob Richards, hundreds of athletes have been shown and promoted, including entire baseball, basketball, and football teams, while also highlighting Olympic successes (including regional Special Olympics editions). Wheaties also does not limit itself to current athletic stars, as special edition boxes have depicted baseball players from the early 20th century, and many athletes who were too early for Wheaties to cover (see Jim Thorpe).

=== Decline in sales ===
Recently, sales of Wheaties in the US has declined significantly. From 2005 to 2014 sales of Wheaties declined 78%.

<doc id="890782" wikidata="Q5259005" url="?curid=890782" title="Dennis Timbrell">
<text>Dennis Roy Timbrell (born November 13, 1946) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) from 1971 to 1987, and was a Cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative governments of Bill Davis and Frank Miller.

==Background==
Timbrell was born in Kingston, Ontario and educated at Woburn Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, Ontario and York University in Toronto. His brother Robert was an actor and performer, better known by the stage name Rusty Ryan.

Timbrell worked as a teacher before entering provincial politics, and served as an alderman in North York from January 1970 until September 1, 1972.

==Provincial politics==
Timbrell contested 1971 provincial election as a candidate for the PCs, and won election in the Toronto constituency of Don Mills. He was re-elected without difficulty in the campaigns of 1975, 1977, 1981 and 1985.

===Cabinet===
He became a minister without portfolio responsible for youth in the Davis government on February 26, 1974, and was named as minister of energy on January 15, 1975. On February 3, 1977, he was promoted to minister of health. After serving in this high-profile position for five years, he became minister of agriculture and food on February 13, 1982.



===First leadership campaign===
Following Davis&#x27;s resignation as PC leader and as premier, Timbrell sought the party leadership at the January 1985 leadership convention. He positioned himself as a centre-right candidate, further to the right of Red Tory rivals Larry Grossman and Roy McMurtry, but not as far to the right as Frank Miller, and therefore the candidate best able to continue Davis&#x27; pragmatic, successful style of government. (In fact, many media pundits at the time referred to Timbrell as a &quot;clone&quot; of Davis; playing to this, some of Timbrell&#x27;s supporters at the January 1985 convention wore buttons that depicted a caricature which morphed the facial features of both Davis and Timbrell into one person). Timbrell was the only candidate to favour eliminating rent controls during the campaign. His supporters included Keith Norton, Leo Bernier, Margaret Birch, Robert Eaton, Gordon Dean, Bob Welch and Norm Sterling.

Timbrell placed second on the first ballot, but was eliminated when he fell to third place on the second ballot, six votes behind Grossman who had the backing of McMurtry&#x27;s campaign. Dr. John Balkwill in 1987 claimed that 30 to 40 Miller supporters were instructed by the Miller campaign to vote for Grossman on the second ballot to prevent him from advancing. Lou Parsons, a senior Miller adviser, later acknowledged, &quot;We wouldn&#x27;t have won it against Dennis [...] Our winning strategy was always to be against Larry ... and in the end we were lucky.&quot;

Timbrell reluctantly endorsed Grossman after the results were confirmed by a recount. He however did not bring enough delegates on the third ballot and that resulted in Miller&#x27;s victory. He was retained in Miller&#x27;s Cabinet as minister of municipal affairs and housing with responsibility for women&#x27;s issues.

===Second leadership campaign===
The Progressive Conservative Party under Miller&#x27;s leadership was reduced to a narrow minority government in the 1985 election. Following a cabinet shuffle on May 17, 1985, Timbrell retained his previous postings and was additionally appointed provincial secretary for resource development. Miller&#x27;s government was defeated in the House in June, 1985. In opposition, Timbrell served as House leader of the Official Opposition and his party&#x27;s critic for education and women&#x27;s issues.

Miller resigned as leader, and the party called another leadership convention for November 1985. This contest was an extremely divisive struggle between Timbrell and Grossman, which exposed deep divisions in the party. A third candidate, Alan Pope, drew attention to the animosity between the candidates with his slogan, &quot;Don&#x27;t choose sides, choose Pope&quot;. Alan Eagleson was a co-chairman of Timbrell&#x27;s campaign.

In this leadership race, Timbrell announced he would not support the full funding of Catholic schools (which had previously been agreed to by all parties in the legislature) unless amendments were put forward guaranteeing entry to non-Catholic teachers and students. Norm Sterling, an inveterate opponent of Catholic school funding, derided Timbrell&#x27;s position as opportunistic and crossed over to Grossman.

Pope finished third on the opening ballot and some believed that he could have given Timbrell a second-ballot victory over Grossman, though Pope chose not to endorse either side. Grossman defeated Timbrell on the second ballot by nineteen votes, effectively ending Timbrell&#x27;s career in provincial politics. He did not seek re-election in 1987, as his two unsuccessful leadership bids had left him with a debt of $250,000.

Despite no longer being an MPP, Timbrell was seen by many as the front runner to succeed Grossman in the 1990 Ontario PC Leadership Race, but he chose not to run, instead supporting the candidacy of Dianne Cunningham, who would eventually lose to Mike Harris.


==Private sector career==
Timbrell served as president of the Ontario Hospital Association from 1991 to 1995. He also served as a director of the St. Joseph&#x27;s Health System (Sisters of St. Joseph, Morrow Park) from 1986 to 1988 and a director of the Toronto School of Theology from 1986 to 1992 and in 1997–2003 (vice-chairman from 1991 to 1993 and in 1997–2000, chairman from 2000 to 2003). He has served as a director of various corporations, including Cabot Trust, Confederation Leasing, Confederation Trust, Ontario Blue Cross, United Telemanagement (Canada) Corporation and Eco Power Solutions Inc.

From 2001 to 2005 Timbrell was engaged by the Ontario Ministry of Health to act as Supervisor of The Ottawa Hospital and then Investigator of The Niagara Health System and Hotel Dieu Hospital (St. Catharines) as well as Investigator of the Grand River and St. Mary&#x27;s Hospitals in Waterloo Region. His work with the leadership of these hospitals resulted in renewed/revised mandates which emphasized the unique attributes of each institution while ensuring minimal overlap and with co-ordination of their respective areas of expertise. In Ottawa Timbrell oversaw the recruitment of a complete new Board of Governors, drawn from the vast region served by TOH; having dismissed the incumbent CEO of the Hospital, he appointed a new President from the ranks of the Senior Team and created the position of Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer.

All of the Hospitals for which Timbrell was Supervisor or Investigator have gone from strength to strength in the last twenty years. He was originally appointed by a PC Government and successfully continued his roles with a Liberal Government. In his earlier role as President of the OHA, he established a very productive relationship with NDP Health Minister (now Senator) Frances Lankin which contributed to significant improvements in Ministry programs and policies directly affecting all hospitals in Ontario.

==Federal politics==
In 1997 and again in 2000 Timbrell campaigned for a seat in the House of Commons as the federal Progressive Conservative candidate in the eastern Ontario riding of Prince Edward—Hastings In the 1997 federal election, Timbrell placed second to Liberal Lyle Vanclief, with 21.5% of the vote. In the 2000 election, Timbrell placed third with 20.3% of the vote.

==Recognition==
In 2006, Toronto City Council voted to name the community recreation centre, aquatic centre, library and child care facility, located at 29 St. Dennis Drive, Don Mills the &quot;Dennis R. Timbrell Resource Centre in Flemingdon Park&quot;.

Timbrell has received the following forms of recognition:

1977 - Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Medal

1978 - Officer of The Order of St. John of Jerusalem

1992 - Canada Confederation 125 Medal

1993 - Knight of Malta

2012 - Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Medal

<text>Minor Martin White (July 9, 1908 – June 24, 1976) was an American photographer, theoretician, critic, and educator. 

White made photographs of landscapes, people, and abstract subject matter. They showed technical mastery and a strong sense of light and shadow. He taught at the California School of Fine Arts, the Rochester Institute of Technology, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and in his home. Some of his most compelling images are figure studies of men he taught or with whom he had relationships. He helped start the photography magazine &quot;Aperture,&quot; considered the only periodical produced for, and by, photographers practicing the medium as a fine art. He served as its editor for many years. White was hailed as one of America&#x27;s greatest photographers. 

==Biography==

===Early life: 1908–1937===
White was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was the only child of Charles Henry White, a bookkeeper, and Florence May Martin White, a dressmaker. His first name was the same as his paternal great, great-grandfather. His middle name was his mother&#x27;s maiden name. 

During his early years, he spent a great deal of his time with his maternal grandparents and enjoyed playing in their large garden, later influencing his decision to study botany in college. His grandfather, George Martin, an amateur photographer, gave White his first camera in 1915. From 1916 to 1922, White&#x27;s parents went through a series of separations. During those periods, White and his mother lived with her parents. His parents reconciled in 1922, remaining together until they finally divorced in 1929.

When White graduated from high school, he was aware of his latent homosexuality. In 1927, he wrote about his feelings for men in his diary, which his parents read without his permission. After this, he left home for the summer in what he called a brief crisis period. In the fall, he returned home and entered the University of Minnesota, majoring in botany. His parents never spoke of his homosexuality again. 

By 1931, when he should have graduated, he did not meet the requirements for a science degree and left school for a year. During this time, he became very interested in writing and started a life-long personal journal he called &quot;Memorable Fancies.&quot; He journaled poems, intimate thoughts about his life and sexuality struggles, excerpts from letters he wrote others, occasional diary-like entries about daily life, and later, extensive notes about his photography. He continued with the journal until 1970, when most of his energy was directed to teaching. 

In 1932, White re-entered the university, studied botany and writing, and graduated in 1934. The next semester, he took some graduate botany classes. After six months, he decided he lacked the interest to become botanist. He spent the next two years doing odd jobs and exploring his writing skills. During this time, he created a set of 100 sonnets on the theme of sexual love, his first attempt at grouping his creative output.

===Launching a career: 1937–1945===
In late 1937, White decided to move to Seattle. He purchased a 35mm Argus camera and hopped a bus to his intended destination. After stopping in Portland, Oregon, he decided to stay there. For the next two and a half years, he lived at the Portland YMCA and explored photography in depth. He taught his first photography class at the YMCA to a small group of young adults. He also joined the Oregon Camera Club and learned how photographers discuss their craft and work.

In 1938, White was offered a job as photographer for the Oregon Art Project, funded by the Works Progress Administration. One assignment was to photograph historic buildings in downtown Portland before they were demolished for a new riverfront development. These included &quot;Arches of the Dodd Building&quot;, which featured a young male prostitute standing in the shadow of the building and pointing at his crotch. During the same period, he took publicity photos for the Portland Civic Theater, documenting their plays and taking portraits of the actors and actresses.

In 1940, White was hired to teach photography at the La Grande Art Center in eastern Oregon. He quickly became immersed in his work, taught classes three days a week, lectured on art to local students, reviewed exhibitions for the local newspaper, and delivered a weekly radio broadcast about activities at the Art Center. In his spare time, he traveled throughout the region taking photographs of the landscape, farms, and small town buildings. He also wrote his first article on photography, &quot;When is Photography Creative?,&quot; published two years later in &quot;American Photography&quot; magazine.

White resigned from the Art Center in late 1941 and returned to Portland, intending to start a commercial photography business. That year, the Museum of Modern Art in New York accepted three of his photographs for inclusion in its &quot;Image of Freedom&quot; exhibition. At the exhibition’s close, the museum purchased all three prints, marking the first time his images entered a public collection. The following year the Portland Art Museum gave White his first one-man show, exhibiting four series of photos he took in eastern Oregon. He wrote in his journal that, with that show, &quot;a period came to a close.&quot;

In April 1942, White was drafted into the United States Army and hid his homosexuality. Before departing Portland, he left most of his negatives of historic Portland buildings with the Oregon Historical Society. White spent the first two years of World War II in Hawaii and in Australia. Later, he became Chief of the Divisional Intelligence Branch in the southern Philippines. He rarely photographed during this time, choosing to write poetry and extended verse. Three of his longer poems, &quot;Elegies,&quot; &quot;Free Verse for the Freedom of Speech,&quot; and &quot;Minor Testament,&quot; addressed his war experiences and the bonds of men under extreme conditions. Later, he used text from &quot;Minor Testament&quot; in his photographic sequence &quot;Amputations.&quot; During the war, White became interested in Catholicism, converting on Easter of 1943.

After the war, White traveled to New York City and enrolled in Columbia University. While in New York, he met and became close friends with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, who worked in the newly formed photography department at the Museum of Modern Art. Through them, White was offered a job as a museum photographer. He spent many hours talking with Nancy Newhall, who he said educated him and strongly influenced his thinking and direction in photography.

===Mid-career: 1946–1964===
In February 1946, White had the first of several meetings with photographer Alfred Stieglitz in New York. White had read Stieglitz&#x27;s various writings on photography and understood some of his theories. Through their conversations, White came to adopt Stieglitz&#x27;s theory of equivalence, where the image represents something other than the subject matter, and his use of sequencing pictorial imagery. White wrote in his journal that he expressed his doubt that he was ready to become a serious photographer at one of their meetings. Stieglitz asked him, “Have you ever been in love?&quot; White answered, “Yes.” Stieglitz replied, &quot;Then you can photograph.&quot;

During this time, White met and became friends with some of the major photographers of the time, including Berenice Abbott, Edward Steichen, Paul Strand, Edward Weston, and Harry Callahan. Steichen, who was director of the Museum of Modern Art’s photography department, offered White a curatorial position. Instead, White accepted Ansel Adams’s offer to assist him at the newly created photography department at the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA) in San Francisco. White moved to San Francisco in July, living in the same house as Adams for several years. Adams taught White his Zone System method of exposing and developing negatives, which White used extensively in his work. He wrote extensively about it, published a book and taught the exposure and development method as well as the practice of (pre)-visualization to his students.

While in San Francisco, White became close friends with Edward Weston in Carmel. For the remainder of his life, Weston had a profound influence on White&#x27;s photography and philosophy. Later he said &quot;...Stieglitz, Weston and Ansel all gave me exactly what I needed at that time. I took one thing from each: technique from Ansel, the love of nature from Weston, and from Stieglitz the affirmation that I was alive and I could photograph.&quot; Over the next several years, White spent a great deal of time photographing at Point Lobos, the site of some of Weston&#x27;s most famous images, approaching many of the same subjects with entirely different viewpoints and creative purposes.

By mid-1947, White was the primary teacher at CSFA and had developed a three-year course that emphasized personal expressive photography. Over the next six years, he enlisted some of the best photographers of the time as teachers, including Imogen Cunningham, Lisette Model, and Dorothea Lange. During this time, White created his first grouping of photos and text in a non-narrative form, a sequence he called &quot;Amputations&quot;. Although it was scheduled to be shown at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, the exhibition was canceled because White refused to allow the photographs to be shown without text, which included some wording that expressed his ambiguity about America&#x27;s post-war patriotism.
The next three years were some of White&#x27;s most creatively prolific. In addition to taking dozens of land- and waterscapes, he took dozens of photographs that evolved into some of his most compelling sequences. Three in particular showed his continuing struggles with his sexuality. &quot;Song Without Words&quot;, &quot;The Temptation of St. Anthony Is Mirrors&quot;, and &quot;Fifth Sequence/Portrait of a Young Man as Actor&quot; all depict &quot;the emotional turmoil he feels over his love and desire for men.&quot;

In 1949, White purchased a small Zeiss Ikonta camera and began a series of urban street photographs. Over the next four years, he took nearly 6,000 images, all inspired by his newfound interest in the poetry of Walt Whitman. The project, which he called &quot;City of Surf&quot;, included photographs of San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown, the docks, people on the streets, and various parades and fairs around town.

The period of 1951–52 is one of the formative times in White&#x27;s career. He participated in a Conference on Photography at the Aspen Institute, where the idea of creating a new journal of photography was discussed by Ansel Adams, Dorothea Lange, Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Frederick Sommer and others. Soon after, &quot;Aperture magazine&quot; was founded by many of these same individuals. White volunteered for and was approved as editor, and the first issue appeared in April 1952. &quot;Aperture&quot; quickly became one of the most influential magazines about photography, and White remained as editor until 1975.

Near the end of 1952, White&#x27;s father, from whom he had been estranged for many years, died in Long Beach, California. In 1953, Walter Chappell introduced White to the I Ching, an ancient Chinese book of philosophy and divination. White continued to be influenced by and refer to this text throughout the rest of his life. He was especially intrigued by the concepts of yin and yang, in which apparently opposite or contrary forces may be conceived as complementary. Later that same year, a reorganization at CSFS resulted in a reduction in White&#x27;s classroom time, and he began to think about an employment change. Concurrently, Beaumont Newhall recently had become the curator at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. He invited White to work with him as a curatorial assistant. He exhibited September 28 – November 3, 1954, at Limelight Gallery in New York and was included in that gallery&#x27;s &quot;Great Photographs&quot; at the end of that year. Over the next three years White organized three themed exhibitions that demonstrated his particular interests: &quot;Camera Consciousness&quot;, &quot;The Pictorial Image&quot; and &quot;Lyrical and Accurate&quot;. In 1955 he joined the faculty at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), where he taught one day a week.

White&#x27;s photographic output declined during this time due to his teaching and editorial work, but he continued to produce enough images that by the end of 1955 he had created a new sequence, &quot;Sequence 10/Rural Cathedrals,&quot; which included landscape images from upstate New York that were shot on regular and infrared film.
By 1955 White was fully engaged in teaching, having been appointed as instructor at the new four-year photography program at RIT as well as conducting classes and workshops at Ohio University and Indiana University. Walter Chappell moved to Rochester later in the year to work at the George Eastman House. Chappell engaged White in long discussions about various Eastern religions and philosophies. White began practicing Zen meditation and adopted a Japanese style of decoration in his house. Over the next two years the discussions between White and Chappell metamorphosed into lengthy discourses about the writing and philosophy of George Gurdjieff. White gradually became an adherent of Gurdjieff&#x27;s teachings and started to incorporate Gurdjieff&#x27;s thinking into the design and implementation of his workshops. Gurdjieff&#x27;s concepts, for White, were not just intellectual exercises but guides to experience, and they greatly influenced much of his approach to teaching and photography throughout the rest of his life.

During this same period White began making his first color images. Although he is better known for his black-and-white photography, he produced many color photographs. His archive contains nearly 9,000 35mm transparencies taken between 1955 and 1975.

In 1959 White mounted a large exhibition of 115 photos of his &quot;Sequence 13/Return to the Bud&quot; at the George Eastman House. It was his largest exhibition to date. It later traveled to the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. White was invited to teach a 10-days&#x27;, all-expense-paid workshop in Portland to accompany the exhibition. He took advantage of the funding to photograph landscapes and did nature studies across the country. From his experience in Portland he developed the idea for a full-time residential workshop in Rochester in which students would learn through both formal sessions and, following a combination of thinking from Gurdjieff and from Zen, through an understanding gained by the discipline of such tasks as household chores and early morning workouts. He would continue this style of residential teaching until he died. In the early 1960s White studied hypnosis and incorporated the practice into some of his teachings.

White continued to teach extensively both privately and at RIT for the next several years. During this time he traveled across the U.S. in the summers taking photographs along the way. In his journal he referred to himself during this period as &quot;The Wanderer.&quot; In 1962 he met Michael Hoffman, who became a friend, colleague and, later editor of &quot;Aperture&quot; magazine. White later named Hoffman to be the executor of his will.

===Late career: 1965–1974===

In 1965 White was invited to help design a newly formed program in visual arts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Boston. After being appointed as a Visiting Professor, White moved to the Boston area and purchased a 12-room house in suburban Arlington so he could increase the size of his residential workshops for selected students. Soon after moving to the Boston area, he completed a different kind of sequence called &quot;Slow Dance,&quot; which he would later integrate into his teachings. He continued to explore how people understand and interpret photography and began to incorporate techniques of Gestalt psychology into his teachings. To help his students experience the meaning of &quot;equivalence,&quot; he started requiring them to draw certain subjects as well as photograph them.

White was diagnosed with angina in 1966. His symptoms continued throughout the rest of his life, leading him to intensify his study of spiritual matters and meditation. He turned to astrology, and his interest in it became so significant that he required all of his current and prospective students to have their horoscopes completed. By this point in his life White&#x27;s unorthodox teaching methods were well established. One student, John Loori, who later became abbot of Zen Mountain Monastery, said, &quot;I really wanted to learn to see the way he did [...]. I didn&#x27;t realize that Minor was teaching us [... ]not only to see images, but to feel them, smell them, taste them.&quot;

White began writing the text for &quot;Mirrors, Messages, Manifestations,&quot; which was the first monograph of his photographs, in late 1966, and three years later the book was published by &quot;Aperture.&quot; It included 243 of his photographs and text, including poems, notes from his journal and other writings. Peter Bunnell, who was one of White&#x27;s early students and then Curator of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art, wrote a lengthy biography of White for the book. During this same time White completed &quot;Sequence 1968&quot;, a series of landscape images from his recent travels.
During the next several years White conceived of and directed four major themed photography exhibitions at MIT, starting with &quot;Light7&quot; in 1968 and followed by &quot;Be-ing without Clothes&quot; in 1970, &quot;Octave of Prayer&quot; in 1972 and &quot;Celebrations&quot; in 1974. Anyone could submit images for the shows, and White spent a great deal of time personally reviewing all of the submissions and selecting the final images.

White continued to teach extensively and make his own photographs even though his health was declining. He devoted more and more time to his writing and began a long text he called &quot;Consciousness in Photography and the Creative Audience,&quot; in which he referred to his 1965 sequence &quot;Slow Dance&quot; and advanced the idea that certain states of heightened awareness were necessary to truly read a photograph and understand its meaning. To complete this work he applied for and received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1970, and &quot;Consciousness in Photography and the Creative Audience&quot; became required reading for a new course he taught at MIT called &quot;Creative Audience.&quot; in 1971 he traveled to Puerto Rico to explore more of his color photography, and in 1974 and 1975 he journeyed to Peru to teach and to further his own Gurdjieff studies.

In 1975 White traveled to England to lecture at the Victoria and Albert Museum and to teach classes at various colleges. He continued on a hectic travel schedule for several weeks, then flew directly to the University of Arizona in Tucson to take part in a symposium there. When he returned to Boston after nearly six weeks of travel, he suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized for several weeks. After this White&#x27;s focus turned even more inward, and he photographed very little. He spent much of his time with his student Abe Frajndlich, who made a series of situational portraits of White around his home and in his garden. A few months before his death White published a short article in &quot;Parabola&quot; magazine called &quot;The Diamond Lens of Fable&quot; in which he associated himself with Gilgamesh, Jason and King Arthur, all heroes of old tales about lifelong quests.

On June 24, 1976, White died of a second heart attack while working at his home. He bequeathed all of his personal archives and papers, along with a large collection of his photographs, to Princeton University. He left his house to &quot;Aperture&quot; so they could continue the work he started there.
==Legacy==
===Retrospective===
Peter Bunnell studied photography under White at the RIT in the late 1950s. Originally intending to pursue fashion photography, it was his exposure to White that drew him to reconsider photography as vehicle for personal artistic expression. White became a mentor to Bunnell and recruited him to join the staff of Aperture magazine. Bunnell gradually transitioned from being a photographer to studying the medium and its history, but his interest in – and friendship with – White endured until White’s passing in 1976.

Bunnell became the acknowledged expert on White’s work, and his 1989 book Minor White: The Eye That Shapes still stands as the most complete single source of information on the photographer. 

===Equivalence===
White was greatly influenced by Stieglitz&#x27;s concept of &quot;equivalence,&quot; which White interpreted as allowing photographs to represent more than their subject matter. He wrote &quot;when a photograph functions as an Equivalent, the photograph is at once a record of something in front of the camera and simultaneously a spontaneous symbol. (A &#x27;spontaneous symbol&#x27; is one which develops automatically to fill the need of the moment. A photograph of the bark of a tree, for example, may suddenly touch off a corresponding feeling of roughness of character within an individual.)&quot;

In his later life he often made photographs of rocks, surf, wood and other natural objects that were isolated from their context, so that they became abstract forms. He intended these to be interpreted by the viewer as something more than what they actually present. According to White, &quot;When a photographer presents us with what to him is an Equivalent, he is telling us in effect, &#x27;I had a feeling about something and here is my metaphor of that feeling.&#x27;...What really happened is that he recognized an object or series of forms that, when photographed, would yield an image with specific suggestive powers that can direct the viewer into a specific and known feeling, state, or place within himself.&quot;

In the introduction to his &quot;Fourth Sequence&quot; (1950), White wrote:

 While rocks were photographed, the subject of the sequence is not rocks; while symbols seem to appear, they are barely pointers to significance. The meaning appears in the mood they raise in the beholder; and the flow of the sequence eddies in the river of his associations as he passes from picture to picture. The rocks are only the objects upon which the significance is spread like sheets on the ground to dry.

Not everyone agreed with or understood White&#x27;s philosophy. Some of White&#x27;s abstract images &quot;have an indeterminacy that forestalls any conventional response.&quot; One critic wrote &quot;Without a capacity to see in rocks some glimmer of essential form, as Weston did, or in clouds some hint of a universal life force, as Stieglitz did, one cannot understand White&#x27;s pictures...One gets the impression that White did not develop as an artist in a linear sense so much as he oscillated between conflicting poles.&quot;

===Sequences===
In the mid-1940s White began to articulate a philosophy about the importance of how his photographs are presented to the viewer. He was influenced initially by Stieglitz, who in his teaching emphasized that photographs shown in a structured content may support each other and may create a total statement that is more complex and meaningful than the individual images by themselves. When White began working as a photographer at the Museum of Modern Art in 1945 he became friends with Nancy Newhall, who was organizing a retrospective of Edward Weston&#x27;s photographs for the museum. Newhall had a gift for creating highly distinct groupings of images, and White said later that her installation of the Weston exhibit was a revelation to him.

For the rest of his life he spent a great deal of time grouping and regrouping his photographs into specific sets of images that varied in number from 10 to more than 100 prints. He described what he called a sequence as a &quot;cinema of stills&quot; that he felt would impart a &quot;feeling-state&quot; created by both the photographer and the personality of the individual viewer.

In his early sequences (through 1952) he included various poems and other texts with his images. As he evolved his thinking about sequences, he gradually stopped using texts. At the same time many of his images became more and more abstract. Although he felt strongly about the particular groupings of his images, in his early sequences he purposely did not prescribe a specific order for how they should be presented. He said he wanted his sequences to be subjective interpretations, and as such he wanted viewers to gain insights into themselves by allowing them to contemplate his work as they saw fit. This concept was limited to those viewers who were part of his workshops and teachings, where they could handle the prints individually rather than see them in a gallery.
Later, as he became more interested in anthropology and myth, he began to experiment with how individual images influenced a viewer by how they were presented. In a work he called &quot;Totemic Sequence&quot;, composed of 10 photographs, he included the same image as both the opening and the closing picture. The last picture is the first picture turned upside down. White felt that this change illustrated the simultaneous reality and unreality in a photograph. The title he gave to the first image was &quot;Power Spot.&quot;

White wrote extensively about his thought about sequences, both in his journal and in articles. In his journal he wrote &quot;The photographs in a Sequence or Constellation may be compared to a dance or theme. The major points of the whole are stated and restated with variations until the very last member of the audience has encountered it or them.&quot; He also wrote &quot;Sequence now means that the joy of photographing in the light of the sun is balanced by the joy of editing in the light of the mind.&quot;

During his lifetime White created or planned about 100 groups of his photographs, including sequences (with multiple versions), series and portfolios. Many were named simply &quot;Sequence&quot; followed by a number, but for several he added artistic titles that reflected his ideas that photographs represent more than their obvious subject matter.

Some of his major sequences are:
*&quot;Song Without Words&quot; (1947)
*&quot;Second Sequence: Amputations&quot; (1947)
*&quot;The Temptation of St. Anthony Is Mirrors&quot; (1948). This sequence is White&#x27;s most personal body of work, composed entirely of photos of a model at CSFA named Tom Murphy. The 32 images include intimate portraits and figure studies, many of which showed Murphy&#x27;s frontal full-nude body. At the time it was illegal to either exhibit or publish images that explicitly showed male genitals, and if White would have let it be known that he had taken the photographs he would have been exposed as a homosexual and subjected to harassment and loss of his job. He mounted and bound two copies of the photos into small, hand-made books, gave one to Murphy and kept the other copy for himself. Many of the photos in this sequence were never published during his lifetime, and the complete sequence was exhibited for the first time only in 2014 at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.
*&quot;Sequence 11 / The Young Man as Mystic&quot; (1955)
*&quot;Sequence 13 / Return to the Bud&quot; (1959)
*&quot;Sequence 16 / The Sound of One Hand&quot; (1960)
*&quot;Sequence 17 / Out of My love for You I Will Try to Give You Back Yourself&quot; (1963)
*&quot;Slow Dance&quot; (1965). White stepped outside of his usual methods in creating this sequence, which consists of 80 color slides intended to be seen on dual projectors. It was inspired by his interest in movement as interpreted through Gurdjieff&#x27;s &quot;rhythmic rituals.&quot;
*&quot;Totemic Sequence&quot; (1974)

===Quotations===
*&quot;At first glance a photograph can inform us. At second glance it can reach us.&quot;
*&quot;Be still with yourself until the object of your attention affirms your presence.&quot;
*&quot;Camera and I have gotten into some eye pursuit of intensified consciousness.&quot;
*&quot;Equivalency functions on the assumption that the following equation is factual: Photograph + Person Looking Mental Image.&quot;
*&quot;In becoming a photographer I am only changing medium. The essential core of both verse and photography is poetry.&quot;
*My own place in this thing called &quot;photography&quot;? Lately it has come to my attention that perhaps I have a place in it, not entirely held by others.
*&quot;One should not only photograph things for what they are but for what else they are.&quot;
*&quot;When the photograph is a mirror of the man and the man is a mirror of the world, then Spirit might take over.&quot;
*&quot;Everything has been photographed. Accept this. Photograph things better.&quot;
*&quot;No matter how slow the film, Spirit always stands still long enough for the photographer It has chosen.&quot;

<text>David Raksin (August 4, 1912 – August 9, 2004) was an American composer who was noted for his work in film and television. Raksin had more than 100 film scores and 300 television scores to his credit. Some sources called him the &quot;Grandfather of Film Music&quot;.

==Biography==
David Raksin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, to Jewish parents (of Russian heritage). His father was an orchestra conductor. Raksin played professionally in dance bands while attending Central High School of Philadelphia. He went on to study composition with Harl McDonald at the University of Pennsylvania, and later with Isadore Freed in New York and Arnold Schoenberg in Los Angeles. In New York, Raksin worked as an arranger for Harms/Chappell.

One of his earliest film assignments was as assistant to Charlie Chaplin in the composition of the score for &quot;Modern Times&quot; (1936). He is perhaps best remembered for his score for &quot;Laura&quot; (1944). The theme music for &quot;Laura&quot;, with lyrics by Johnny Mercer, became a major hit. During Raksin&#x27;s lifetime, &quot;Laura&quot; was reportedly the second most-recorded song in history after &quot;Stardust&quot; by Hoagy Carmichael and Mitchell Parish.

Raksin&#x27;s theme song, &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (also called &quot;Love is For the Very Young&quot;) for the 1953 film &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1953) was also a hit, although not as popular as &quot;Laura&quot;. Raksin insisted that the song be released as an instrumental, because he had resented having to split the proceeds from &quot;Laura&quot; with a lyricist. Raksin&#x27;s theme for &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; was initially disliked by the film&#x27;s director Vincente Minnelli and producer John Houseman, but was saved from rejection by the intervention of Adolph Green and Betty Comden, who both liked it. The theme has since been praised by Stephen Sondheim, Leonard Rosenman, Richard Rodney Bennett, and Alexander Courage. Sondheim reportedly called it &quot;one of the best themes ever written in films.&quot;

Raksin also scored the 1958 film &quot;Separate Tables&quot;, for which he earned an Academy Award nomination.

In the 1960s, Raksin wrote the theme for (and scored the pilot of) the medical drama television series &quot;Ben Casey&quot;. Later in life, Raksin taught at the University of Southern California and the University of California, Los Angeles.

Raksin died in 2004, aged 92. At the time of his death, it was announced that Raksin had completed his autobiography, titled &quot;If I Say So Myself&quot;. The book was eventually published under the title &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful: My Life in a Golden Age of Film Music&quot;.

In 2012, he was named for a Lifetime Achievement Award for a Past Film Composer.

His son Alex is a Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial writer for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

<doc id="890793" wikidata="Q842375" url="?curid=890793" title="NBA Finals">
<text>The NBA Finals is the annual championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Eastern and Western Conference champions play a best-of-seven series to determine the league champion. The team that wins the series is awarded the Larry O&#x27;Brien Championship Trophy, which replaced the original Walter A. Brown Trophy in 1976–77, though under the same name until 1984.

The series was initially known as the BAA Finals prior to the 1949–50 season when the Basketball Association of America (BAA) merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the NBA. The competition oversaw further name changes to NBA World Championship Series from 1950 to 1985, as well as a brief stint as the Showdown, before settling on NBA Finals in 1986. Since 2018, it has been officially known as the &quot;NBA Finals presented by YouTube TV&quot; for sponsorship reasons.

The NBA Finals was initially structured in a 2–2–1–1–1 format. In 1985, to ease the amount of cross-country travel, it was changed to a 2–3–2 format, in which the first two and last two games of the series were played at the arena of the team who earned home-court advantage by having the better record during the regular season. In 2014, the 2–2–1–1–1 format was restored. The team with the better regular season record hosts the first two games and the other team hosts the next two games. If needed, the remaining three are played at each team&#x27;s home arena alternately, starting with the arena of the team with the better regular season record.

A total of 21 franchises have won the NBA Finals, with the Boston Celtics winning the most recent and most in the NBA thus far with 18 total.

==History==
===1946–1956: Beginnings and Lakers dynasty===

The beginning era of modern professional basketball was dominated by the Minneapolis Lakers, who won five of the first ten titles. The Philadelphia Warriors also won multiple championships, including the inaugural title in 1947 and another in 1956 to bookend the NBA&#x27;s first decade. 
After being founded in 1946, the Basketball Association of America completed its inaugural season in April 1947 with the Philadelphia Warriors defeating the Chicago Stags in the 1947 BAA Finals in five games. The following season the Warriors again reached the Finals, however they fell short to the now defunct Baltimore Bullets. To date the Baltimore Bullets are the only defunct team to win a championship.

In 1948, the Minneapolis Lakers won the championship of the rival National Basketball League before joining the BAA. Led by future Hall of Famer George Mikan, the Lakers won the third and final BAA championship in 1949 over the Red Auerbach-coached Washington Capitals. The BAA then merged with the NBL to form the National Basketball Association before the 1949–50 season. The Lakers won the inaugural NBA championship in 1950 to become the first team to repeat as champions.

In 1951, the Rochester Royals defeated the New York Knicks in the only Finals contested between two teams from the same state (something not possible under the current NBA alignment). This was the first of three consecutive losses in the Finals for the Knicks, Meanwhile, the Lakers won three straight Finals from 1952 to 1954 to become the first team to three-peat while also winning their fifth title in six seasons.

Of the five franchises to win a championship from 1947 to 1956, one (the Bullets) folded and the other four (the Warriors, Lakers, Royals, and Syracuse Nationals) all relocated by 1964.

===1957–1969: Celtics Dynasty===

The Boston Celtics won 11 of the 12 NBA Finals they reached during 13 seasons (1956–57 to 1968–69), including eight straight NBA championships from 1959 through 1966. During this time the St. Louis Hawks also won their only title before moving to Atlanta and the Philadelphia 76ers won their first title since relocating from Syracuse.

With the establishment of the Celtics dynasty in 1957, spearheaded by center Bill Russell, the team saw great success. Despite encountering some difficulty when up against teams led by Wilt Chamberlain, for most of the late 1950s and 1960s, the Celtics and Russell managed to have an upper hand on Chamberlain&#x27;s teams.

In 1964, Chamberlain, who had moved to the state of California alongside his team, led the San Francisco Warriors to a Western Division championship, but again failed to conquer the Celtics. The following season, he returned to the Eastern Division to join the Philadelphia 76ers after the former Syracuse Nationals relocated to the city to cover the vacancy created by the Warriors.

The first clash between the two stars in the playoffs was in 1966, with Boston winning the series 4–1. In the following season, Philadelphia coach Alex Hannum instructed Chamberlain to provide an increased focus on playing a team game, to avoid drawing the double-teams that troubled Chamberlain during the Finals. This tactical change brought the team to a new record of 68 wins the following season, as well as defeating the Celtics before winning the 1967 Finals. In 1968, Boston overcame a 3–1 deficit against Philadelphia to once again arrive in the Finals. They went on to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers in the Finals to again become NBA champions.

In 1969, the Celtics faced great difficulty entering the postseason, as they had an aging team and multiple injuries to a number of players. They qualified for the playoffs as the fourth and final seed in the East, while the Lakers, who had added Chamberlain in the off-season to join stars Jerry West and Elgin Baylor, won the West and were prohibitive favorites to become champions for the first time since relocating to Los Angeles. Despite holding a 2–1 advantage going into Game 4, the Lakers led 87–86 and had the ball with 10 seconds to play. But after a turnover, Sam Jones scored to give the Celtics a narrow 88–87 win and tying the series. The series was eventually tied 3–3 going into Game 7 in Los Angeles, with Lakers owner Jack Cooke hanging balloons in the arena in anticipation of a Lakers victory. West also picked up injuries to his thigh and hamstring during the series, but returned to play for the final game. Russell utilized this newly lacking mobility in West to organize fast breaks at every opportunity for the Celtics, which allowed them to gain an early lead. They held off a furious Lakers comeback to win 108–106 and win the series, and win their eleventh championship in 13 years.

As many stars either declined or retired following this win, it is largely recognized as the last NBA Finals conducted by the Celtics dynasty.

===1970–1979: Decade of parity===
The 1970s saw ten different teams reach the Finals and eight different teams win a championship, the most of any decade in the NBA, with the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks winning twice.

In 1970, a classic Finals featured the Knicks against the Lakers. In the waning moments of Game 3, with the series tied, Jerry West hit a basket from 60 feet to tie the game, a shot that became one of the most famous ever. However, the Knicks won in overtime and eventually won the series in 7 games. Game 7 featured an injured Willis Reed returning to action for the Knicks and inspiring his team to victory, though Reed scored only 4 points. The following season had another first-time champion, as the Milwaukee Bucks, led by Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, defeated the Baltimore Bullets.

Two seasons after losing in the Finals, the Lakers won 33 straight games, the longest winning streak in NBA history. By season&#x27;s end, they broke the record for most wins in a season with 69, one more than the 1966–67 Philadelphia 76ers, before taking home the championship for the first time since relocating to Los Angeles, beating the Knicks. The Knicks returned to win the Finals again a season later, followed by the Celtics’ 12th title in 1974.

The late 1970s were characterized by a major breakthrough of the league&#x27;s western franchises. In 1975, after compiling a 48–34 regular season record, the Golden State Warriors swept the Washington Bullets 4–0 in the 1975 NBA Finals. In 1976, the Phoenix Suns, after only eight years of existence, overcame an 18–27 losing record early in the regular season to build a remarkable run to finish 42–40. The team, nicknamed the &quot;Sunderella Suns,&quot; achieved upset victories over the Seattle SuperSonics and the Warriors, before facing the Celtics in the Finals. The teams split the first four games, before Game 5 went into three overtimes, and Boston won 128–126. The Celtics quickly managed to secure their 13th championship, and second in three years, defeating the Suns 87–80 in Game 6.

Franchises that won their first titles in the 1970s included the New York Knicks in 1970, Milwaukee Bucks in 1971, the Portland Trail Blazers in 1977, and the Washington Bullets, who defeated the Seattle SuperSonics, in 1978. The Sonics exacted revenge on the Bullets the following season, beating Washington in five games in 1979 to win their first title.

===1980–1991: Celtics–Lakers rivalry and &quot;Bad Boys&quot; Pistons===
The 1980s were mostly known for the rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers, who combined to win eight titles in the decade. Rookie Magic Johnson led the Showtime Lakers to the 1980 NBA Finals against the Philadelphia 76ers, who were led by Julius Erving. The Lakers took a 3–2 lead, but Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could not play in Game 6 due to injury. Johnson, a natural point guard, was shifted to center and played every position on the court during the game, scoring 42 points, with 15 rebounds and 7 assists to win his first championship and Finals MVP honors, becoming the first and only rookie to win the award.

Boston reached the 1981 NBA Finals led by the &quot;Big Three&quot; of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish. They met the Houston Rockets, who were carried practically single-handedly by Moses Malone and upset the Lakers in the first round. The Rockets were only the second team in NBA history to make the Finals after posting a losing record in the regular season, and the Celtics had an NBA best record of 62–20. The Celtics won the Finals in 6 games.

The Lakers returned to the Finals in 1982, this time led by new coach Pat Riley, in a rematch against the 76ers. The 76ers defeated the Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals in a 7-game series, but were defeated by Lakers in 6 games. The 76ers responded by trading for Moses Malone, the league&#x27;s reigning MVP. With the new duo of Malone and Erving, the 76ers won the 1983 NBA Finals in a sweep of the Lakers.

The Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals in 1984, 1985, and 1987. In 1984, the Celtics toppled the Lakers 4–3. The final game of this series attracted the largest ever TV audience for an NBA game, and the second-largest ever for a basketball game, with only the 1979 NCAA Championship game between Johnson and Bird having a larger audience. The teams faced off again in 1985 and 1987, but the Lakers came up on top both time, winning in 6 games despite each time, despite losing Game 1 in 1985 by 34 points in the Memorial Day Massacre. The 1987 Finals included Johnson hitting a hook shot with two seconds left in Game 4 to give the Lakers a 107–106 win and a 3–1 series lead.

In the following two seasons, the Celtics failed to reach the Finals, becoming overshadowed by the Detroit Pistons. The Lakers defended their title in the 1988 NBA Finals, winning the series in 7 games against the Pistons. They became the first team to win back-to-back NBA titles since 1969. Seeking a three-peat in 1989, the Lakers were swept by the Pistons in a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s Finals. The Pistons were nicknamed the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; due to their rough, physical play led by future Hall of Fame guards Joe Dumars and Isiah Thomas and a rugged front court with Bill Laimbeer and Dennis Rodman. In 1990, the Pistons went back-to-back, defeating the Clyde Drexler-led Portland Trail Blazers in five games.

===1991–1998: Bulls dynasty===

The majority of the 1990s was marked by the supremacy of the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls, led by head coach Phil Jackson and star players Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, won six titles in six Finals appearances from 1991 to 1998. The only other team to win a title during this time was the Houston Rockets, who won titles in 1994 and 1995.

The Bulls&#x27; first championship came at the expense of the Los Angeles Lakers, in the last Finals appearance for Magic Johnson. The series was billed as a showdown between the aging Johnson and the upstart Jordan. The Lakers won the first game, however, for the rest of the series, Pippen guarded Johnson allowing Jordan to primarily focus on scoring. The Bulls won the next four games to win the series 4–1. The Bulls returned to the Finals the next year, pitted against Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers. Chicago defeated the Trail Blazers in Game 1 by 33 points, a game notable for Jordan breaking the record for the most three-pointers in a first half, with six. The Bulls went on to win the series in six games.

In 1993, The Bulls were matched against the Phoenix Suns, led by Charles Barkley, who was the league&#x27;s reigning MVP of the Phoenix Suns. After dropping the first two games at home, The Suns won Game 3 in Chicago in triple overtime. The Bulls came back to win Game 4 with Jordan scoring 55 points and tying Rick Barry for the second-most points in an NBA Finals game. Chicago clinched the series in Game 6, 99–98, on John Paxson&#x27;s three-pointer, as the Bulls became the third team in history to three-peat. After this win, Jordan retired from basketball to pursue a career in baseball.

Following Jordan&#x27;s departure, the Houston Rockets, led by Hakeem Olajuwon, won the 1994 and 1995 NBA titles. During this time, Olajuwon became the only player in history to win the NBA MVP, NBA Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP awards in the same season. 

After his short stint with baseball, Jordan returned to basketball late in the 1994–95 season. Although he did not lead the Bulls to the Finals for that season, he returned to pre-retirement form the next season while the team acquired perennial rebounding champion Dennis Rodman. The 1995–96 Bulls finished the regular season 72–10, attaining, at the time, the best regular season record in NBA history. They dominated in the playoffs, going 11–1 in the first three rounds, before facing the Seattle SuperSonics in the NBA Finals. After the Bulls took a 3–0 series lead, Seattle won the next two games after point guard Gary Payton asked his coach George Karl to be switched onto Jordan. Jordan altered his game to deal with Payton, and the Bulls won Game 6 to win their fourth title.

In 1997 and 1998, the Bulls met the Utah Jazz in the Finals twice. Led by Dream Team Olympians John Stockton and Karl Malone, the Jazz were defeated in both Finals by the Bulls in six games. In both series, Chicago won by hitting winning shots in the sixth game, the first by Steve Kerr in 1997 in Chicago, and the second by Jordan in Utah in 1998. This saw Chicago winning their sixth NBA championship, and winning their second three-peat. Jackson retired following this season, which set off a chain reaction that resulted in most of the team, including Jordan and Pippen, leaving the Bulls. With no foundation of youth to build upon, the Bulls became a lottery-bound team for the next six seasons.

===1999–2010: Spurs and Lakers dominance===

The 2000s were largely dominated by the San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Lakers, who appeared in a combined eleven Finals to win nine championships in twelve seasons.

The Spurs won four championships, in 1999, 2003, 2005, and 2007. During the 1999 NBA playoffs, the Spurs finished with a 15–2 mark. With a defensive squad led by David Robinson and Tim Duncan, San Antonio&#x27;s 84.7 points allowed per game was the fewest average points allowed in the postseason in the last 30 years. In the Finals, the Spurs held the New York Knicks, the first 8-seed team to reach the Finals in NBA history, to an average of 79.8 points per game. During the 2003 NBA Finals, the Spurs defeated the New Jersey Nets in six games, which also marked the first championship contested between two former ABA teams. In Game 6, Duncan was two blocks short of recording the first quadruple-double in NBA Finals history, finishing with 21 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, and 8 blocks. The Spurs also defeated the Detroit Pistons 4–3 in 2005 and swept the LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers in 2007. Tony Parker won the Finals MVP award in 2007, becoming the first European-born player to do so.

The Lakers won five championships in the same period, including a three-peat from 2000 to 2002, led by Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Kobe Bryant. Most notably, during their 2001 postseason run, the Lakers swept their first three series and won the Finals against the Allen Iverson-led Philadelphia 76ers in five games, finishing with an unprecedented 15–1 record, the best postseason record in NBA history at the time. The Lakers also defeated the Indiana Pacers in 2000, the Pacers’ only Finals appearance to date, and swept the New Jersey Nets in 2002.

In the 2003 off-season, veteran stars Gary Payton and Karl Malone signed with the Lakers. Along with Bryant and O&#x27;Neal, they formed what many expected to be one of the best teams in NBA history and were heavy favorites to win the championship in 2004. However, the Detroit Pistons, coached by Larry Brown, defeated the Lakers in five games. Now established as one of the powerhouses of the East, the Pistons returned to the NBA Finals the following year, losing to the Spurs in seven games.

Following bad blood and eventual fallout with former Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant, O&#x27;Neal was traded from the Lakers to the Miami Heat in 2004, where he teamed up with rising star Dwyane Wade. Together they led the Heat to a championship in 2006 at the expense of the Dallas Mavericks.

The Lakers returned to the Finals in 2008 against the Boston Celtics, renewing the teams&#x27; rivalry marking the 11th Finals matchup between them. The Celtics defeated the Lakers in six games, led by their &quot;Big Three&quot; superstars of Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett, and Paul Pierce. The Lakers bounced back from the loss by winning the 2009 NBA Finals, where they beat Orlando Magic in five games. The Lakers met the Celtics once again in 2010, trailing 3–2 before winning the last two games at home. Head coach Phil Jackson surpassed Red Auerbach&#x27;s record for most NBA titles of all time with eleven.

===2011–2022: LeBron James dominance and the Warriors dynasty===

The 2010s were distinguished by the continued excellence of LeBron James, who appeared in nine NBA Finals in ten seasons, winning four titles, while playing for three different franchises. The decade also saw the ascent of the Golden State Warriors, emerging as a dominant force in the Western Conference with six NBA Finals appearances and four titles in eight seasons.

During the 2010 off-season, the Miami Heat re-signed team captain Dwyane Wade and added James and Chris Bosh via free agency to form a new &quot;Big Three.&quot; The Heat were subsequently considered heavy title favorites and appeared four straight finals, starting in 2011 against the Dallas Mavericks. Despite being heavy underdogs on paper, the Mavericks won the series in six games. The Heat returned to the Finals in the following year against a young Oklahoma City Thunder team featuring future MVPs Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Kevin Durant. Miami won the series in five games, with James winning his first championship. The Heat repeated as champions in 2013, this time over the San Antonio Spurs, featuring a Heat comeback in Game 6 that is widely regarded one of the greatest playoff games ever played. Miami sought a three-peat in a 2014 rematch with the Spurs, but this time San Antonio prevailed in five games, winning the fifth and final title of Tim Duncan&#x27;s career.
In the 2014 off-season, James returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers where he teamed up with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love to form a new &quot;Big Three&quot;. The Cavaliers appeared in the next four Finals, all against the Golden State Warriors. The Cavaliers and Warriors became the first two teams to square off in more than two consecutive Finals. The Warriors drew first blood in the 2015 NBA Finals, coming back from a 2–1 deficit to win the series 4–2, despite James&#x27; historic efforts. The following season, the Warriors broke the record for most regular season wins with a record of 73–9. The Warriors opened up a 3–1 series lead in the 2016 NBA Finals, but James and Irving led the Cavaliers to two straight victories to force a deciding Game 7. In a key sequence with two minutes remaining in Game 7, LeBron James made a memorable chase-down block on Iguodala to keep the game tied, while Irving hit a 3-point shot a minute later to take the lead. Cleveland held on to win the title and end the city&#x27;s championship drought. In the subsequent off-season, the Warriors acquired Kevin Durant through free agency, forming what many considered to be one of the greatest teams ever assembled. In 2017, the Warriors set a playoff record of 15 consecutive wins en route to a five-game victory in the Finals, followed by a dominant sweep in 2018.

The Warriors made their fifth consecutive Finals appearance in 2019 against the Kawhi Leonard-led Toronto Raptors. Toronto prevailed in six games after season-ending injuries to stars Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, resulting in the first NBA title for a team based outside the United States.

LeBron James joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018, and subsequently led them to the 2020 NBA Finals against the Miami Heat, marking the first time in NBA history that two teams that missed the playoffs the year before met in the Finals. The Lakers won the series 4–2, claiming their 17th title to tie the Boston Celtics&#x27; franchise record; LeBron James was named Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career, becoming the first player to win the award with three different franchises. 

The 2021 NBA Finals saw the Milwaukee Bucks defeat the Phoenix Suns in the first Finals since 1971 to feature no players who had previously won a championship.

After missing the playoffs two years in a row due to injuries and roster changes, the Warriors returned to the 2022 NBA Finals for their sixth appearance in eight seasons. They defeated the Boston Celtics in six games for their fourth championship in eight seasons.

===2023–present===
The Denver Nuggets reached their first Finals in franchise history in 2023, defeating the Miami Heat in five games. Nikola Jokić was named Finals MVP, becoming the lowest-drafted player (41st overall) to win the award. The Boston Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks in the 2024 NBA Finals, marking the sixth straight year with a different championship team, matching a run of NBA championship that only occurred from 1975 to 1980. Boston won its record 18th NBA title, breaking a tie with their longtime rival Los Angeles Lakers.

(*) As a result of the original franchise&#x27;s relocation to New Orleans, the NBA team in Charlotte suspended operations for the 2002–03 and the 2003–04 seasons, before a new team, named the Bobcats, was established for the 2004–05 season. In 2013, the original Hornets were renamed the Pelicans and obtained the records during their time in New Orleans and Oklahoma City from 2002 to 2013. In 2014, the Bobcats became the second incarnation of the Charlotte Hornets, and retained the history and records of the Hornets organization from 1988 to 2002.

<text>Little Me: The Intimate Memoirs of that Great Star of Stage, Screen and Television, or simply Little Me, was the parody &quot;confessional&quot; self-indulgent autobiography of &quot;Belle Poitrine&quot; (French for &quot;Pretty Bosom&quot;). It was written by Patrick Dennis, who had achieved a great success with &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;. A bestseller when introduced in book form, the work was also later staged on Broadway as a musical.

The heavily illustrated work featured numerous photographs by Cris Alexander, who combined retouched stock photographs with original photographs taken to create Belle Poitrine&#x27;s life. Published in 1961, it was considered pretty risqué at the time. (Several of Alexander&#x27;s photographs were rejected by censors.) The book also featured family and friends of Dennis and Alexander, including Dennis&#x27; wife, Louise, as &quot;Pixie Portnoy&quot;, and ballet dancer Shaun O&#x27;Brien (Alexander&#x27;s domestic partner) as Mr. Musgrove. Actress Dodie Goodman and comedian Alice Pearce were prominently featured. Actress Jeri Archer portrayed the often overexposed, self-centered and clueless Poitrine, and Kurt Bieber was her beefcake co-star and paramour, &quot;Letch Feely&quot;. &quot;Little Me&quot; was reissued in 2002 with a new preface by Charles Busch and foreword by Alexander.

The plot of &quot;Little Me&quot; tells the rags-to-riches-to-rags-to-riches, etc. story of Maybelle Schlumpfert, an overdeveloped and self-deluded young girl who rises to become Belle Poitrine. Throughout the book, Poitrine&#x27;s character trumpets her successes (which are few) while glossing over her failures (which are many). The book was a sharp parody of the cult of celebrity and self-importance that emerged from the numerous &quot;personality overcoming obstacles&quot; biographies of the late 1940s and early 1950s.

==&quot;Little Me&quot;, the musical==

&quot;Little Me&quot; was made into a musical, with book by Neil Simon, music by Cy Coleman, and lyrics by Carolyn Leigh, which opened at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on November 17, 1962 and ran for 257 performances.

<text>Edward Nagle Williamson (October 24, 1857 – March 3, 1894) was an American professional baseball infielder in Major League Baseball. He played for three teams: the Indianapolis Blues of the National League (NL) for one season, the Chicago White Stockings (NL) for 11 seasons, and the Chicago Pirates of the Players&#x27; League for one season.

From 1883 and 1887, Williamson held the single-season record for both doubles and home runs. Although his record for doubles was surpassed in 1887, he held the home run record until 1919, when it was topped by Babe Ruth of the Boston Red Sox. Statistically, he was one of the best fielders of his era. During the first eight years of his career, he led the league at his position in both fielding percentage and double plays five times, and he also led his position in assists six times. Later, when he moved to shortstop, he again led the league in both assists and double plays.

His career was shortened by a knee injury that he suffered in Paris during a world-tour organized by Albert Spalding. After he left organized baseball, his health declined rapidly. He contracted tuberculosis and ultimately died at the age of 36 of dropsy.

==Career==
Born in Philadelphia, Williamson began his major league career on May 1, 1878 for the Indianapolis Blues of the National League. That season he played in all 63 of the team&#x27;s games as the starting third baseman, leading the league in that category. He umpired his only game on August 12, calling a game between the Chicago White Stockings and the Providence Grays. His season-ending statistics included a .232 batting average, one home run, and 31 runs scored.

The Blues were only a major league team for the 1878 season, resulting in Williamson joining the Chicago White Stockings for the 1879 season. He was their regular third baseman, leading the league in multiple fielding categories for his position, including fielding percentage, assists, putouts, and double plays. As a hitter, his numbers improved. He finished second in the league with 13 triples, and eighth in doubles with 20, while also raising his batting average to .294. During the next three seasons, his batting statistics fluctuated from year to year. His batting average rose from .251 in 1880 to .282 in 1882; likewise, his 20 doubles in 1880 were good for seventh in the league, but dropped to 12 in 1881. He followed that season with 27 in 1882, which was fourth in the league. During this time period, when his level of hitting had dropped, his play in the field did not. He led the league in fielding percentage from 1880 to 1882, and in assists in 1881 and 1882.

In 1883, Williamson set the major league record for doubles in a single season by hitting 49, surpassing King Kelly&#x27;s 37 set the previous year. Williamson&#x27;s record for doubles stood until Tip O&#x27;Neill of the St. Louis Browns hit 52 in 1887. Williamson&#x27;s doubles achievement was attributed to the short dimensions of Chicago&#x27;s Lakeshore Park; the distances were in left field, in center field, and in right field. Balls that were hit over the fence were counted as doubles until 1884, when they became home runs. On September 6, Chicago scored a record 18 runs in one inning during a 26–6 victory over the Detroit Wolverines. Williamson contributed three hits, and scored three runs in that inning, setting individual records in both categories. Other than runs scored, the other team records set that day included the most hits and total bases in one inning.

During this time period, the establishment of the ground rules of each park rested with the home team. In 1884, team captain and on-field manager Cap Anson decided that balls hit over the fence were to be home runs. Williamson used these short dimensions and new ground rules to set the single-season home run record by hitting 27 in a 112-game season, surpassing the record of 14 set by Harry Stovey the previous year. Of the 27 home runs he hit that year, 25 of them were hit at home. This record stood for 35 years until it was broken in 1919 by Babe Ruth, who hit 29 for the Boston Red Sox in a 140-game schedule. The first three of Williamson&#x27;s 27 home runs came on May 30, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Detroit Wolverines. Williamson became the first major league baseball player to hit three home runs in one game. During these two record-breaking seasons, his fielding prowess did not recede. He did not lead the league in fielding percentage in either 1883 or 1884, but did lead in assists, capping off a streak of five consecutive years in which he did so, while also leading the league in double plays for the second and third consecutive years.

After the 1884 season, the White Stockings moved to West Side Park, and Williamson&#x27;s power numbers dropped. Without the short fences, his home run total dropped to three, his doubles went down to 16, and his batting average dropped to .238, his lowest average since he became a White Stocking. Despite his low hitting numbers, he did lead the league in games played with 116, bases on balls with 75, and yet again, led his position in assists, double plays, and for the fifth and last time, fielding percentage. Chicago won the National League championship that season, and agreed to play the American Association champions, the St. Louis Browns in a seven-game &quot;World Series&quot;. Before game one began, the players of both teams held a field day which included contests of skill, and Williamson won the long throw with a toss that traveled 400 feet, four inches. The 1885 series ended in a tie when each team won three games, and one game ended in a tie. Williamson collected two base hits in 23 at bats, for a .087 batting average, and scored one run.

Beginning in 1886, Williamson switched his fielding position to shortstop, while the Chicago White Stockings again won the National League championship, their fifth in seven years. The team&#x27;s success did not coincide with Williamson&#x27;s slide in seasonal numbers. His batting average dropped to his career low of .216, and his strikeouts jumped up to a career high of 71, in 430 at bats, although he did finish third in bases on balls. The White Stockings met the St. Louis Browns following the season and agreed to play a best of seven &quot;World Series&quot; for the second consecutive year. The Browns won the series, four games to two, and Williamson&#x27;s statistics for the series did not improve. In fact, they were worse than in 1885. He gathered one base hit in 18 at bats, for a .056 batting average, and scored two runs.

1887 was Williamson&#x27;s second season at shortstop, his last full season in the majors, and his numbers began to climb back to what they were during the early part of his career. His batting average jumped back up to .267, hit 20 doubles, 14 triples, 73 base on balls, and nine home runs. In 1888, his batting average dipped again, this time to .250, but he did finish fourth in the league in both RBIs with 73, and base on balls with 65. In the field, he led the league in assists and double plays.

==Spalding&#x27;s world tour==
At the completion of the 1888 baseball season, Albert Spalding organized an around-the-world tour to promote the game of baseball. The two teams Spalding selected were the White Stockings and a collection of players from other National League teams. The tour departed on October 20, 1888 to play exhibition games throughout the western United States for a month, before departing to Hawaii. The tour visited several foreign countries, such as Australia, Egypt, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), France, Italy, and England. It was during a game played on at the Parc Aristotique in Paris, France on March 8, 1889, when Williamson suffered a torn knee cap which forced him to be bedridden in England on doctor&#x27;s orders, missing the tour through Britain. Though players in the 19th century were responsible for their own medical care, Williamson asked Spalding to help him financially with the mounting medical costs. Spalding refused, citing that he was not obligated to assist, and Williamson never forgave him for this.
Williamson, among his baseball contemporaries, wrote the most colorful articles to newspapers as the tour was unfolding. Williamson, an 1880s teammate of Anson in Chicago, had a knack for roasting—poking fun at—his teammates while always coming across as good-natured. A testament to the letters&#x27; significance is that they are a dominant source of one recent book&#x27;s World Tour presentation. Williamson is portrayed by Charlie Crabtree in the 2015 movie &quot;Deadball&quot; which depicts his life and journaling of the world tour.

==Late career and death==
The injury to Williamson&#x27;s knee caused his career to suffer, as he played in 47 games during the 1889 season. He batted .237, and of his 41 hits that season, only five of them were extra base hits. He joined the Chicago Pirates of the Players&#x27; League for the 1890 season, his final major league season, and played in 73 games, hitting .195.

In the spring of 1894, Williamson traveled to Hot Springs, Arkansas, in hopes that he could recover from a liver ailment and lose some weight as well, but the treatments did not work. Williamson died on March 3 of that year, at the age of 36 in Willow Springs, Arkansas, of dropsy (edema) complicated by consumption (tuberculosis). He was interred in an unmarked grave at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago, until November 6, 2021, when the grave received a dedication thanks to the efforts of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR); the grave notes his single-season record of home runs set in 1884.

<text>The Watauga River () is a large stream of western North Carolina and East Tennessee. It is long with its headwaters in Linville Gap to the South Fork Holston River at Boone Lake.

== Course ==
The Watauga River rises from a spring located south to the base of Peak Mountain at Linville Gap in Avery County, North Carolina. The spring emanates from the western side of the Tennessee Valley Divide, which is, at this location, congruent with the Eastern Continental Divide. On the other side of the divide at Linville Gap are the headwaters of the Linville River in the Upper Catawba watershed. Waters of the Linville River eventually reach the Atlantic Ocean, whereas waters of the Watauga River reach the Gulf of Mexico; hence the Eastern Continental Divide. The river then flows across Watauga County, North Carolina, crossing the Tennessee state line (River Mile (RM) 55.1) at Johnson County, then into Carter County, Tennessee and ends at its confluence with the Holston River&#x27;s South Fork (RM 0) on the Washington/Sullivan County border.

=== Impoundment ===
After crossing into Johnson County, the Watauga River is first impounded by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Watauga Dam, creating the Watauga Lake. This impoundment receives two important tributaries: the Elk River and Roan Creek. Watauga Lake is bridged by Tennessee State Route 67 over Butler Memorial Bridge just as the watercourse enters Carter County. The Appalachian Trail crosses the river on Watauga Dam.

Nearly 3 miles below Watauga Dam, on the Horseshoe section of the Watauga River, is the TVA Wilbur Dam, which forms a much smaller but very deep reservoir known as Wilbur Lake. TVA releases approximately of discharged water back into the Watauga River during the summer months. Below Wilbur Dam the river flows generally north and then west into Carter County where it forms the northern limits of Elizabethton, where the Watauga then receives the Doe River. Farther downstream on the Watauga River at the boundary between Carter County and Washington County is the old TVA Watauga Steam Plant.

A portion of the boundary line between Washington County and Sullivan County is formed by the Watauga River. Boone Dam is located below the slack water confluence of both South Fork Holston River and the downstream end (mouth) of the Watauga River. The distance afloat between the TVA Watauga Reservoir and Boone Lake is approximately .

== History ==
The true origin of the name of the Watauga River is probably lost to antiquity. Most documents agree that the name is of Native American origin, though which nation, tribe or language it descends from, and its meaning, are in question. Early Tennessee historian John Haywood states in his &quot;The Civil and Political History of the State of Tennessee&quot; published in 1823 that the &quot;Watauga signifies the River of Islands, or the Island River. The Holston River was known to the Cherokees by the name of Watauga.&quot;. Pre-Civil War maps of Tennessee show that the river designated as the Holston River extended west of Knoxville, meeting with the Clinch River near Kingston and well past the present-day beginning of the Tennessee River (east of Knoxville) at the confluence of both the Holston River and the French Broad River.

A North Carolina State University web page (the Watauga Medal) says the word &quot;Watauga&quot; is a Native-American word meaning &quot;the land beyond&quot;. Local references say the name means &quot;beautiful river&quot; or &quot;beautiful water&quot;. There were at least two Native American villages so named, including one at present-day Elizabethton, which became known as &quot;Watauga Old Fields&quot;, referring to former Native American residents. It was first explored by Daniel Boone and James Robertson in 1759. A historic Cherokee town known as Watauga was located along the Little Tennessee River near present-day Franklin, North Carolina, in their homelands.

The original settlers of Nashville, Tennessee, set out west from the Watauga River area, called the Watauga Association, during the American Revolution. They realized that the British Proclamation of 1763, forbidding colonial settlement west of the Blue Ridge Mountains in order to protect Native American territories, was essentially unenforceable.

Wilbur Dam is the site of first hydroelectric dam constructed in Tennessee (beginning in 1909), going online with power production and distribution in 1912. Wilbur Dam was constructed on the Watauga River by the former Tennessee Electric Power Company, a privately owned utility purchased by the TVA in the late 1930s. Elizabethton acquired the moniker &quot;City of Power&quot; because of its early access to hydro-generated electricity from Wilbur Dam.

The Watauga river is home to the endangered green floater mussel (&quot;Lasmigona subviridis&quot;). The river is also a breeding site for eastern hellbenders (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis).

== Recreation ==
Whitewater rafting, kayaking, canoeing, fly fishing, and angling with fishing reels are all popular recreation activities pursued on the Watauga River. Rainbow trout, brown trout, and striped bass are all caught in the Watauga River.

=== Whitewater ===
The Watauga River downstream of the TVA dams draws commercial rafting outfitters from both northeast Tennessee and western North Carolina during the summer months and commercial fishing guides throughout the year. The picturesque Class II+ Bee Cliff Rapids on the Watauga River (also referred to the &quot;Anaconda Rapids&quot; by some North Carolina–based rafting companies) are found downstream between Wilbur Dam and the Siam Bridge, southeast of Elizabethton.

For commercial whitewater rafting and kayaking on the Watauga River, the most popular Carter County &quot;put-in&quot; is immediately downstream of the TVA Wilbur Dam, and the most popular &quot;take-out&quot; is 2 to 2½ hours downstream (depending upon the volume of the reservoir release and other factors) at the Blackbottom riverside portion of the city linear trail park in Elizabethton. The distance afloat for paddlers from the put-in at Wilbur Dam to the Blackbottom take-out is approximately seven miles, with landmarks along the Watauga River providing a good estimate of time and distance traveled.

The Watauga River also has a section of Class IV-V whitewater popular with expert kayakers, upstream of Watauga Lake in North Carolina. This section requires significant rainfall to bring it up to runnable levels. It features continuous steep boulder bed rapids dropping up to , and several falls and ledges only runnable by expert paddlers.

=== TVA recreation areas ===

The Tennessee Valley Authority maintains a self-service public campground below Watauga Dam. Amenities and recreational opportunities at the TVA Watauga Dam Tailwater Campground include 29 camp sites with electric hookups, rest rooms with heated showers and flush toilets, dump station, public phone, picnic tables and grills, canoe access, boat ramps above and below dam, lake and river fishing, hiking trail, walking trail, wildlife viewing area, and birdwatching.

=== Influence of weather ===

The TVA regulates flow of the Watauga River by scheduling the release of deep, impounded reservoir waters from behind both the Watauga Dam and Wilbur Dam. As a result, the summer temperature of the Watauga River is approximately downstream of the dams. The Watauga River is generally comfortable for kayaking, canoeing, and rafting during the summer months, but care must be taken to prevent hypothermia by prolonged exposure to the cold river water.

As TVA also guarantees a minimum release schedule during the summer season for riverine recreation below Wilbur Dam, the Watauga River will draw commercial whitewater rafting companies from distant rivers—such as the Nolichucky River running through Erwin, Tennessee in Unicoi County—when lack of adequate summer rain fall will not allow for rafting trips on these naturally flowing rivers during seasonal droughts.

<doc id="890810" wikidata="Q5253137" url="?curid=890810" title="Food Additives Amendment of 1958">
<text>The Food Additives Amendment of 1958 is a 1958 amendment to the United States&#x27; Food, Drugs, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. It was a response to concerns about the safety of new food additives. The amendment established an exemption from the &quot;food additive&quot; definition and requirements for substances &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot; by scientific experts in the field, based on long history of use before 1958 or based on scientific studies. New food additives would be subject to testing including by the &quot;Delaney clause&quot;. The Delaney clause was a provision in the amendment which said that if a substance were found to cause cancer in man or animal, then it could not be used as a food additive.

==&quot;Generally recognized as safe&quot;==

Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designation that a chemical or substance added to food is considered safe by experts, and so is exempted from the usual Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) food additive tolerance requirements. The concept of food additives being &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot; was first described in the Food Additives Amendment of 1958, and all additives introduced after this time had to be evaluated by new standards.

==Delaney Clause==
The Delaney Clause is a provision in the amendment named after Congressman James Delaney of New York. 
It said:

the Secretary of the Food and Drug Administration shall not approve for use in food any chemical additive found to induce cancer in man, or, after tests, found to induce cancer in animals.

The Delaney Clause applied to pesticides in processed foods, but only when the concentration of a residue of a cancer-causing pesticide increased during processing; for example when more of a pesticide was present in ketchup than in the raw tomatoes used to make it. (It never applied to pesticides in raw foods.) When the law was passed, &quot;neither advocates nor opponents of the policy, including FDA officials, believed it would have broad application, for only a handful of chemicals had then been shown to be animal carcinogens.&quot;

The Delaney Clause was invoked in 1959 when Arthur Sherwood Flemming, the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare issued a statement advising the public about the possible contamination of substantial quantities of cranberries in Oregon and Washington with the herbicide aminotriazole, which the FDA had recently determined was a carcinogen (see Cranberry scare of 1959). Taking place the week of Thanksgiving, the announcement was referred to by many in the cranberry industry as &quot;Black Monday&quot; − sales plummeted, even though many government officials attempted to defuse the scare by declaring their intention to eat cranberries anyway. This episode is regarded as one of the first modern food scares based on a chemical additive.

As analytical chemistry became more powerful and able to detect smaller quantities of chemicals, and as chemicals became more widely used, regulatory agencies had an increasingly difficult time administering the Delaney Clause as it &quot;recognizes no distinctions based on carcinogenic potency and, at least in theory, it applies equally to additives used in large amounts and to those present at barely detectable levels. It thus takes no account of the actual risk a carcinogenic additive might pose.&quot;

The FDA was the first agency to have to confront this problem, with respect to the use of diethylstilbestrol to promote the growth of livestock used in meat production, which remained present in the meat. It addressed the issue by using quantitative risk assessment, declaring that if a carcinogenic food additive creates an excess lifetime cancer risk of less than 1 additional cancer case in every 1,000,000 exposed individuals, the risk is negligible. This standard became known as the &quot;de minimis&quot; exception to the Delaney Rule and was used throughout the FDA and other agencies.

In 1988 the United States Environmental Protection Agency eased restrictions on several pesticides which posed a &quot;de minimis&quot; risk to humans. This change was challenged by the Natural Resources Defense Council, and overturned in 1992 by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Pesticide use was removed from the Delaney Clause in 1996 by an amendment to Title IV of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-170, Sec. 404).

The Delaney prohibition appears in three separate parts of the FFDCA: Section 409 on food additives; Section 512, relating to animal drugs in meat and poultry; and Section 721 on color additives. The Section 409 prohibition applied to many pesticide residues until enactment of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. This legislation removed pesticide residue tolerances from Delaney Clause constraints.

Many foods contain natural substances which are carcinogenic, for example safrole, which occurs in sassafras and sweet basil. Even these substances are covered by the Delaney clause, so that, for example, safrole may not be added to root beer in the United States.

<doc id="890812" wikidata="Q1066954" url="?curid=890812" title="Charlie Muffin">
<text>Charlie Muffin (U.S. title: A Deadly Game) is a 1979 British made-for-TV film directed by Jack Gold and starring David Hemmings, Ralph Richardson, Sam Wanamaker, Pinkas Braun, Ian Richardson, Shane Rimmer and Jennie Linden. A Euston Films production, it was written by Keith Waterhouse based on the 1977 novel of the same name by Brian Freemantle.

==Plot==
This Cold War espionage thriller follows the story of British anti-hero spy Charlie Muffin, who has fallen on hard times since the forced retirement of Sir Archibald Willoughby, his previous boss at the British secret service. His new boss, Sir Henry Cuthbertson, a former military man who epitomises the haughty upper-class British imperialist, barely attempts to conceal his disdain for the under-educated agent who, although more and highly experienced, quite obviously does not stem from the &quot;right class&quot;. At the start of the film, it is established that Charlie has been deemed expendable and accordingly is set up to be captured or killed during a mission to East Germany — despite having been responsible for the mission&#x27;s success. However, Charlie religiously follows his former chief&#x27;s first rule: &quot;Always secure an escape route&quot;, and another man is killed in his place. Cuthbertson&#x27;s lap-dog agents Snare and Harrison — both totally lacking in experience and as arrogant as their boss — are shocked and embarrassed to see Muffin returning alive and well.

Back in the UK, Muffin&#x27;s humiliation does not end, as Cuthbertson attempts to demote him over Charlie&#x27;s supposed failure in interrogating a captured Russian agent. Because of Cutherbertson&#x27;s not following established British Intelligence guidelines and Charlie&#x27;s proving that his interrogation was actually a success, Charlie escapes demotion and goes on leave, which he spends with his wife Edith, while at the same time maintaining an affair with Cuthbertson&#x27;s secretary-receptionist.

Next, the story unfolds around British and American attempts to facilitate a safe defection of high-ranking Soviet General Valery Kalenin, KGB Director of Operations for more than twenty years. CIA Director Garson Ruttgers proves equally ambitious but not much smarter and ultimately equally as officious and presumptuous as his British counterpart. After Harrison and Snare&#x27;s spectacular downfalls (one is killed in Leipzig trying to escape capture by KGB agents and the other is actually captured in Moscow) as the result of CIA interference and because the Americans are using diplomatic pressure on the British to make Kalenin&#x27;s defection a joint Anglo-American operation, Cuthbertson has no choice but to call in Charlie to handle the affair. Charlie meets with Kalenin in Moscow without the CIA finding out, and Ruttgers&#x27; aide Braley, a good-hearted but docile sideshow official, is assigned to accompany Muffin first to casinos in various cities in order to &quot;launder&quot; the $500,000 Kalenin is demanding as the price of his defection and later to Prague to liaise with Kalenin on the final details. Meanwhile, Cuthbertson, who is still wary of Charlie (who keeps insisting that Kalenin&#x27;s defection is false and a trap), arranges with his secretary-receptionist that she spy on Charlie during their liaisons together.

After the arrangements have been made, Charlie, Braley, Cuthbertson and Ruttgers meet in a safehouse in Vienna. Charlie and Braley meet Kalenin at an obscure border-crossing post and escort him to the safehouse. Charlie leaves to hide the car, while Cuthbertson and Ruttgers jubilantly welcome Kalenin. However, their joy is short-lived when Kalenin reveals that his &quot;defection&quot; was merely the bait in an elaborate trap to capture the heads of both MI5 and the CIA in order to exchange them for an important Russian agent currently imprisoned in England, and that his men are now in complete control of the safehouse. Cuthbertson and Ruttgers realize too late that Kalenin&#x27;s plan couldn&#x27;t have succeeded without inside help...from Charlie, who has escaped with the money intended for Kalenin.

The Russian agent is released and flies home to Moscow, while Cuthbertson and Ruttgers are presumably disgraced and dismissed from their positions, and Charlie and Edith, now in hiding in Brighton, celebrate their freedom with the money.

==Cast==
==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Directed crisply and cleverly by Jack Gold ... &quot;Charlie Muffin&quot; is a diverting spy adventure, complete with a genuine surprise ending. The characters sometimes dissolve into caricatures, creating the childish impression that the British and American agents are idiots while the Russians are generally masterful.&quot;

<doc id="890819" wikidata="Q301821" url="?curid=890819" title="Idukki district">
<text>Idukki (ഇടുക്കി; ) is one of the 14 districts in the Indian state of Kerala in the southwest of the country. It is the largest district in Kerala and lies amid the Cardamom Hills of Western Ghats in Kerala. Idukki district contains two municipal towns – Kattappana and Thodupuzha, and five taluks.

The district was constituted on 26 January 1972, by taking Peerumade, Udumbanchola, Devikulam taluks of the former High Range division from Kottayam district and the Thodupuzha taluk from Ernakulam district. Its division was previously headquartered at Kottayam city but moved to Kuyilimala near Painavu and Cheruthoni in June 1976. Malayalam and English are the two official administrative languages in the district. Tamil is the second most spoken language in Idukki district after Malayalam.

Around 66% of Kerala&#x27;s power needs come from various Hydroelectric Power Projects in Idukki district. Numerous cash crops and spices are cultivated throughout the district, making it &quot;The Spice Garden of Kerala&quot;. A significant area in the district is protected as reserved forests and wildlife sanctuaries. The Periyar River is a major river that originates and flows through Idukki. The Pamba River is another important river that originates from Idukki district.

Though it is the largest district in the region in terms of area, it has the lowest population density among the districts of Kerala. There are only two municipalities in the district and the urban population is comparatively much lower than the rural population, due to its mountainous nature. The high peak of Anamudi, which is also the highest point of elevation in India outside the Himalayas, lies in the northern portion of the district of Idukki. The Idukki Dam is one of the highest arch dams in Asia.

The major tourism destination of Idukki is Munnar.

==Etymology==
The name Idukki was derived from the Malayalam word ‘&quot;Idukk&quot;’, which means gorge.

==History==
A perfect blend of the Malayali, the Tamil and various tribal cultures is found in the Idukki district. The temples and other older buildings in the High Range and the surrounding regions in Idukki have significant influences from the medieval era Tamil-Pandyan architectural styles. The mountain passes like Bodinayakkanur (connecting various mountain ranges) and Cumbum (which connects the eastern Tamil country with Thodupuzha) have facilitated trade and travel between the Tamil-Pandyan country which lied to east of the Western Ghats and various Kerala kingdoms west of it during the medieval period. Periyar, the longest river in Kerala, has its source of origin and major portion of its route of flow, in the Idukki district. Pamba, the third-longest river in Kerala, also has its origin in the district of Idukki. During the Travancore Era, Munnar has acted as the summer residence of the British residents in Travancore. Higher peaks like Anamudi on the eastern border of the Idukki district have acted as a natural boundary between the Malayalam kingdoms and the contemporary Tamil kingdoms in the past, thereby reducing invasions into the region from the neighbouring Tamil country as well as from other parts of the Indian peninsula. The 17th century Dutch work, &quot;Hortus Malabaricus&quot;, contains information about the flora and fauna of the region at that time.

===Pre-history===
Archaeological findings found from the district include dolmens of the Neolithic era in the Marayur area. They are locally known as &quot;muniyara&quot;, derived from &quot;muni&quot; (hermit or sage) and &quot;ara&quot; (dolmen).

Located on the highest point of elevation on the Peninsular India, the Cardamom Hills and its surrounding regions were inhabited by human beings during the Megalithic age itself. Numerous Megalithic monuments have been discovered from the mountainous regions of the district. The remnants of numerous &quot;Kodumkallaras&quot; and &quot;Kallaras&quot; have been found from various places at Marayur in Devikulam taluk. Megalithic remnants of &quot;Kallaras&quot; and &quot;Nadukkallus&quot; are also found at Kallarpattom colony in Udumbanchola taluk. Huge &quot;Kodumkallaras&quot; and &quot;Nadukkallus&quot; were discovered from the excavation sites in Vandiperiyar region as well. The Megalithic monuments found from Idukki show numerous similarities with the contemporary remnants those discovered from Deccan plateau and other parts of the South India. Usage of Iron was common in the Megalithic culture of Deccan. Tribals are another culture that was established on the hills of Idukki after the Stone Age culture. Although many of the social elements that existed in the Stone Age can be seen in the tribal culture here, the two groups represent two different periods. There is no clear evidence of where the Stone Age people went later. It is also thought that the mountain may have come down due to the weather and difficulties in living conditions. Tribal people found in Idukki are Mannan, Muthuvan, Paliyan, Urali, Malayarayan, Malapulayan, Ulladan . According to those who have studied the oral forms and rituals associated with tribal culture, tribal life begins in Idukki in the period 13 – 15 BC. Tribal people who were in contact with Tamil culture came to Idukki, from present day Coimbatore, Madurai and Ramanathapuram districts, as evidenced by their language, customs and art forms. According to modern anthropologists, the aborigines here belong to the Proto-Australoid race. Many stories are popular about their (Idukki) mountain climbing. One is that they were given the position of forest chiefs as a reward for helping the Pandya Raja clan. At one point, they had to leave Madurai and reached Idukki via Kumily via Gudalur in Tamilakkam with the help of King Poonjar. It is also believed that those who were appointed to collect forest products for the local kings settled down here over time. The tribal people here may have migrated here in search of better living facilities. As the number of families in each tribal village increases, a new community is created. The clothing used in the early days was wood made from crushed arayanjil. They also made musical instruments from animal skins. Adivasis have great ability to weave household items using reeds. They worshiped the forces of nature and trees. All the tribes had their own system of administration. The heads of the huts are known as Muppan or Kani depending on the caste. It is king among mannans. Urali are believed to be the first tribe to migrate to the hills of Idukki.Uralis still practice some practices of the Stone Age in a nominal way. It is believed that the black stone placed over the grave after burial is a continuation of the Stone Age grass stone. There are 33 tribal sanctuaries in Idukki including Venmani, Mullaringad, Nadukani, Kurukanadu, Koovakandam, Kannampadi, Muthampadi, East Mattucutta, Vellall, Memarikudi, Poovantikudi. In later times, the people who came to Poovanthikudi,Ayyappancoil who fled from the forest where the Mullaperiyar Dam is located, they left agriculture with the migration of the Britishers, Tamils and the Malayalis. All the adivasi tribes were the owners of a great cultural heritage, the tribals who danced in the inner forests, engaged in handicrafts, organized their lives in their own unique way and created many rare charms of the ancient culture. Almost all the tribal tribes of the Western Ghats were owners of a life identity that was destroyed by various invasions. Most of the land that the British planters found to plant cardamom, Tea and Coffee was in the lands where the tribal tribes roamed freely. As the mountains were cut down and whitened one by one, each tribal community was pushed back. Each tribes have their own languages closely related to Tamil and Malayalam.

===Classical Antiquity===

Ancient Roman coins have been found from the regions like Edamaruku near Thodupuzha, indicating ancient trade between the Ancient Rome and the region during the Classical Antiquity. Spices might had been imported from the region as a part of the ancient Indian Ocean trade. Idukki district is still known as &quot;The Spice Garden of Kerala.&quot;

===The Chera dynasty/The Keralaputras (up to 5th century CE)===

The literary works of the Sangam period help to take a look into the contemporary period. According to those works, early members of the Chera dynasty (first few centuries of the Common Era) had their original headquarters in a region called &quot;Kuzhumur&quot; at &quot;Kuttanad&quot; in the ancient Tamilakam and were sometimes known as the &quot;Kuttuvans&quot;. Some historians have identified &quot;Kuzhumur&quot; with Kumily in Peerumade Taluk of the Idukki district. The Chera dynasty is mentioned as &quot;The Keralaputras&quot; in the inscriptions of the emperor Ashoka of the Maurya Empire (322 BCE – 184 BCE). The province &quot;Kuttanad&quot; in the ancient kingdom of &quot;Keralaputras&quot; included the modern-day districts of Idukki, Ernakulam, Kottayam, and parts of Alappuzha, which could be broadly defined as the region between the rivers Periyar and Pamba. It was bounded by the Ay kingdom to the south, which included the regions between Pamba River and Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin), and the province of &quot;Kudanad&quot;, which lies between the rivers Periyar and Chaliyar (modern-day districts of Thrissur, Palakkad, and Malappuram), to the north.

It was during the reign of Uthiyan Cheralathan (105–130 CE) that the Chera dynasty began to expand towards the northern and the eastern regions of &quot;Kuttanad&quot; by conquering the provinces of &quot;Kudanadu&quot; and &quot;Kongu Nadu&quot;. Afterwards the dynasty got split into three branches and fixed their capitals at Muziris, Tyndis, and Caroura, respectively, as seen in the ancient Greco-Roman travelogues as well as the Old Tamil literary works of the Sangam period. During the reign of &quot;Narmudi Cheral&quot;, the regions included in the Kingdom of Ezhimala was also added to the Chera empire.

The ancient Chera empire collapsed due to continuous invasions carried out by the Kalabhras, the Pallavas, the Chalukyas, the Pandyas, and the Rashtrakutas during the period between 500 CE and 800 CE for nearly three centuries.

===The Chera Perumals of Mahodayapuram (800 – 1102 CE)===
Idukki was part of three &quot;Nadus&quot; (provinces) during the period of the Chera Perumals of Mahodayapuram (800 – 1102 CE) for nearly three centuries. The Thodupuzha-Muvattupuzha region was part of a province called &quot;Keezhmalanadu&quot; during this time, with its headquarters at Karikode near Thodupuzha. The High Range region, which lies to the east of &quot;Keezhmalanadu&quot;, was possibly included in two provinces namely &quot;Nantuzhanadu&quot; and &quot;Vempolinadu&quot; (known as &quot;Bimbali Desam&quot; in Sanskrit). This period saw the decline of Buddhism and Jainism, which were once prominent in the region, along with the growth of Hinduism, in the Thodupuzha region. The tribal cultures may have sustained in the sparsely populated High Range region. The territory of the Chera Perumals of Mahodayapuram got disintegrated into several small feudal states by early 12th century CE as a result of the continuous war that occurred between the Chera Perumals and the Medieval Cholas throughout the 11th century CE.

===Kingdom of Keezhmalanadu (1102 – 1600 CE)===
The province Keezhmalanadu of the Chera Perumals of Mahodayapuram attained political autonomy in 1102 CE following the Chera-Chola wars. Remnants of numerous medieval forts have been found from Karikode near Thodupuzha, which was the capital of the kingdom of Keezhmalanadu, many of them belonging to the era between 14th century CE and 16th century CE. Keezhmalanadu included parts of modern-day Taluks of Thodupuzha and Muvattupuzha. The Portuguese explorers described the region as &quot;The Pepper country&quot; due to the availability and high scale production of good quality Black pepper there during the 16th century CE. Keezhmalanadu merged with the Kingdom of Vadakkumkur around 1600 CE.

===Vadakkumkur dynasty (1600 – 1750 CE)===

Vadakkumkur was the northern branch of the erstwhile province of &quot;Vempolinadu&quot; which attained political autonomy in 1102 CE after the collapse of the Chera Perumals of Mahodayapuram. The rulers of this dynasty were also known by the titles &quot;Bimbaleeshas&quot; and &quot;Manikandas&quot; in the contemporary Sanskrit works just like their Thekkumkur counterparts. The kingdom of Vadakkumkur originally included the modern-day Taluks of Ettumanoor and Vaikom along with a portion of the Meenachil Taluk.

Keezhmalanadu merged with the Vadakkumkur dynasty around 1600 CE. Afterwards the Vadakkumkur kings often used to reside at Karikode near Thodupuzha, which was originally the headquarters of the Keezhmalanadu. Vadakkumkur was a vassal state of the Kingdom of Cochin during that time. Vadakkumkur&#x27;s western boundary was extended up to the Vembanad lake and the eastern boundary was the Western Ghats, which bordered with the medieval Pandyan country and the later territory of the Madurai Nayak dynasty. The Dutch Malabar who became an influential power in the territory of Vadakkumkur during the 17th century CE and the first half of the 18th century CE had trade centres in Vadakkumkur.

Vadakkumkur Raja was a part of the combined military alliance formed by the kingdoms of Odanad (Kayamkulam), Thekkumkur, and Cochin against the expansion of Travancore into the northern territories. As a result, Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, the architect of the modern Travancore, attacked and annexed Vadakkumkur in 1750. The Vadakkumkur Raja sought asylum in the kingdom of the Zamorin of Calicut.

===Thekkumkur dynasty (1102–1749 CE)===
It is presumed that a major portion of the High Range region in Idukki district belonged to the Thekkumkur dynasty just after the collapse the Chera Perumals of Mahodayapuram. The province &quot;Vempolinadu&quot; (&quot;Bimbali Desam&quot;) of the Chera Perumals of Mahodayapuram attained political autonomy in 1102 CE following the Chera-Chola wars of the 11th century CE. The &quot;Vempolinadu&quot; royal family got evolved into two independent branches by the 12th century CE – the southern branch among them later came to be known as the kingdom of Thekkumkur. It included the modern-day Taluks of Changanassery, Kanjirappally, Kottayam, and Thiruvalla, along with the High Range region of Idukki district.

The High Range region was later handed over to the Poonjar dynasty by the Thekkumkur Rajas. The Dutch East India Company was attracted by enormous growth of black pepper in the High Ranges of the Idukki district. According to the treaty signed on 16 June 1664, Dutch Malabar had trade contracts with the Thekkumkur Rajas on spices, cinnamon, opium, etc.

The Thekkumkur Rajas allied with the Kingdom of Cochin and the Kingdom of Odanad (Kayamkulam) against the military invasions of the kingdom of Travancore into its northern kingdoms that occurred during the 1740s. As a result, Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, the architect of the modern Travancore, attacked and annexed the kingdom of Thekkumkur into Travancore in 1749 during the Battle of Changanassery, after his annexation of Kayamkulam in 1746. The Thekkumkur king took refuge in the kingdom of the Zamorin of Calicut following his defeat in the battle.

===Poonjar dynasty (1160–1750 CE)===

In , Kulothunga Chola, who belonged to the lineage of the Medieval Cholas, entered into a war with Manavikrama Kulasekhara Perumal, who belonged to the Pandya dynasty of Madurai. Upon the failure in the battle, Manavikrama appointed his brother Maravarman Sreevallabha as the monarch of the Pandya dynasty and left Madurai with his family and some of his trusted servants. Manavikrama crossed the Western Ghats and sought political asylum in Kerala. The ruler of Thekkumkur awarded him a portion of the Meenachil taluk which included the region of Poonjar along with the High Range region in the Idukki district in 1160 CE, which originally belonged to the Thekkumkur Rajas. This incident commenced the beginning of the Poonjar dynasty in the region. The territory of Poonjar was annexed by the Kingdom of Travancore following the annexation of the principalities of Thekkumkur and Vadakkumkur in 1749–1750.

=== Travancore Era (1750–1947) ===
Entire portion of the modern-day district of Idukki became part of the erstwhile British Princely state of Travancore by 1750 CE. This era marked considerable progress and social reformation in all spheres. The social development indicators like the literacy rate were improved considerably during this period. After the Stone Age people and tribals, Anchunadan Tamils migrated to Idukki, Then Travancore farmers, Tamil workers and the Britishers migrated to Idukki. The Cardamom Proclamation of 1822, issued by the Rani Uthrittathi Thirunal Gowri Parvathi Bayi, the regent of the British Princely state of Travancore at that time, paved the way for bringing people from outside for collecting Cardamom from the forest of the Cardamom Hills in the district. The proclamation, issued on Malayalam Era 15 Medam 997 (which corresponds to CE 28 April 1822), entrusted Tamil workers from neighbouring districts of the Madras Presidency with harvesting cardamom in the region.

The Kannan Devan Hills on the High Range region were given on lease on 11 July 1877 by the ruler of the Poonjar dynasty to John Daniel Munroe from London and for tea plantations. This created an influx of a large number of migrant Tamil plantation workers into the region from the neighbouring districts of the Madras Presidency as well as from various 
parts of Southern Travancore especially from Kanyakumari district and Shenkottai taluk and the linguistic demographics in the Taluks of Devikulam taluk and Peerumedu taluk underwent a significant transformation during the last decades of the 19th century CE. Earlier the region was inhabited by various aboriginal tribes like Malavedas, Malayarayas, Muthuvans, and Paliyans, and was sparsely populated. The land and the plantations were later resumed by the Government of Kerala through the Kannan Devan Hills (Resumption Of Lands) Act, 1971.

Munnar has acted as the summer residence of the British residents in Travancore. Tradition states that Colonel Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, was the first British man to pass through Munnar during Tipu Sultan&#x27;s campaign into Travancore in the last decades of the 18th century CE, but this is unsubstantiated. The first survey of the terrain was undertaken by Benjamin Swayne Ward in 1816–1817, who followed the Periyar River into the Western Ghats and established a camp at the confluence of three rivers, from which the name of Munnar is derived.

Munroe, Henry Turn, and his half-brother A W Turner, obtained ownership of the Cardamom Hills from the Raja of Travancore and began clearing forest around Devikulam in 1879. Munroe formed the North Travancore Land Planting &amp; Agricultural Society in 1879. Soon many other Europeans began establishing tea plantations in the area throughout the 1880s, after A H Sharp, a European planter entered into tea cultivation in the region. Early plantations had few facilities and were mainly huts of straw.

In 1897, a separate company, Kannan Devan Hills Corporation (KDHC), was registered to operate the tea estates which was later taken over by the American Direct Tea Trading Company Ltd., who owned 26 estates, most with coffee and some with &quot;Cinchona&quot;, almost all in the area except for a few in the lower areas. The former Kundala Valley Railway through Munnar, established in 1902, was destroyed by the &quot;Great flood of 99&quot; that occurred in 1924 across the modern-day state of Kerala. Many dams were constructed in Idukki district during the Travancore rule in the region. The transportation facility through the dense forests of Idukki was also improved during the period. The controversial Mullaperiyar Dam was also constructed during the period.

During the Travancorean administration, the British Princely state of Travancore was divided into four revenue divisions- the Northern division headquartered at Kottayam, the Central division headquartered at Kollam, the Southern division headquartered at Thiruvananthapuram, and the High Range division with its headquarters at Devikulam.

The High Range division in the northeastern part of Travancore included the Taluks of Devikulam and Peerumade. Thodupuzha region was however included in the northernmost division of the British Princely state of Travancore. Kottayam was the headquarters of the northernmost revenue division in Travancore which also included the Taluks of North Paravur, Kunnathunad, Muvattupuzha, Meenachil, Changanassery, Kottayam, Vaikom, and Cherthala in 1931, in addition to Thodupuzha.

===Post Independence (1947–present)===

At the time of the integration of the state of Travancore and Cochin into the state of Travancore-Cochin in 1949 following the integration of the British Princely states of Travancore and Cochin into the Dominion of India, the erstwhile revenue divisions were reorganised into districts and the Divan Peshkars gave way to District Collectors, paving the way for the birth of the Kottayam district on 1 July 1949, which had also included the modern-day district of Idukki in it.

The erstwhile Kingdom of Cochin was reorganized into Thrissur district and Taluks of North Paravur and Kunnathunad were transferred to that district. Similarly the Cherthala Taluk was transferred into the newly formed Kollam district on 1 July 1949. The High Range division of the erstwhile Travancore was merged with the remaining Taluks of the erstwhile Kottayam division to form the Kottayam district as a part of the inauguration of the new Indian state of Travancore-Cochin on 1 July 1949. The new district of Kottayam at that time contained eight Taluks – Changanassery, Kottayam, Vaikom, Meenachil, Muvattupuzha, Thodupuzha, Devikulam, and Peerumede. Hence Idukki was a part of the Kottayam district at the time of the formation of the state Kerala in 1956.

Apart from the Kanyakumari district, the Devikulam taluk in present-day Idukki district had a slight Tamil-majority in the late 1940s. The Travancore Tamil Nadu Congress (TTNC) had requested to merge it with the Madras State as a part of the upcoming States Reorganization Act of 1956. However, in the 1951 Linguistic Census of the state of Travancore-Cochin, it was found that nearly half of the total Tamil-speaking population in Devikulam taluk at that time was born outside the state of Travancore-Cochin and most of them were immigrants from the Madras Presidency, who were brought into the region by the British officials mainly as tea plantation workers to the Cardamom Hills.

Furthermore, some quick decisions were taken by Pattom Thanu Pillai, who was the first prime minister of Travancore, to ensure that the taluk of Devikulam will retain in the modern-state of Kerala, as the region had a greater economic importance in the future coastal state of Kerala. Pattom came up with a colonisation project to re-engineer the demography of Cardamom Hills. His colonisation project was to relocate 8,000 Malayalam-speaking families into the Taluks of Devikulam and Peermade. About 50,000 acres in these Taluks, which had become Tamil-majority area by the 1940s, were chosen for the colonisation project. As a victory of the Colonisation project done by post-independence Travancore, these two Taluks and a larger portion of Cardamom Hills retained in the state of Kerala, after the States Reorganisation Act, 1956.

Following the formation of the new Indian state of Kerala according to the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, many jurisdictional changes were done in the state. Two new Taluks, namely Kanjirappally (from Changanassery and Thiruvalla) and Udumbanchola (from Devikulam and Peerumede) were carved out on 1 October 1956 in the Kottayam district. After a month, a new Taluk called Kuttanad was carved out from Changanassery and Ambalappuzha. The Kuttanad Taluk was transferred into the newly formed Alappuzha district on 17 August 1957. The Taluks of Thodupuzha and Muvattupuzha were transferred into the newly formed Ernakulam district on 1 April 1958.

The land and the plantations in the Kannan Devan Hills in the High range region were resumed by the Government of Kerala through the Kannan Devan Hills (Resumption Of Lands) Act, 1971. On 26 January 1972, the district of Idukki was formed by the separation of the three High Range Taluks, namely Devikulam, Udumbanchola, and Peerumede, from Kottayam district. The High Range region was merged with the Thodupuzha taluk of Ernakulam district to form the district of Idukki. It was the largest district of Kerala by area at that time. In 1998, Kuttampuzha village was transferred into the Ernakulam district, making Idukki the second largest district in Kerala, only after to Palakkad.

The High Range region is still sparsely populated and various cash crops and spices are extensively cultivated there. Now various hydroelectric power projects in the district of Idukki contributes around 66% of the total power needs of Kerala. The Mullaperiyar Dam still remains as the source of the interstate dispute between Kerala and Tamil Nadu. In September 2023, Idukki regained its status as the largest district in the state after the addition of 12718.5095 hectares of land which was a part of Kutampuzha village in Ernakulam district to Idamalakudi village in Idukki.

==Geography==

The Idukki district forms a high altitude plateau with rugged mountainous terrain, several river valleys and deep gorges. The entire northern part of the district forms a sub plateau higher than the rest of the district, this region includes the tallest peaks like Anamudi and includes the areas around Munnar, Pallivasal, Kanthalloor, Vattavada and Mankulam. The Pambar river valley (Marayoor, Keezhanthoor) forms an eastern sloping rain shadow region of the Western Ghats. The eastern frontier of the district (Kumily, Kattapana, Nedumkandam, Rajakumari and Ramakkalmedu) constitutes the Cardamon hills. The western part of the district is covered by forests and hills bordering the eastern regions of Ernakulam and Kottayam district like Neriyamangalam, Vannapuram, Thommankuthu, Moolamattom, Vagamon and Kuttikanam. Places like Thodupuzha, Koothattukulam, Udumbanoor and Muttom are situated in the semi elevated Thodupuzha River plains with scattered hills. The Periyar river basin in the district which includes Vandiperiyar, Ayyapankoil, Rajakkad, Idukki, Cheruthoni and Adimaly is an elevated plateau crisscrossed by river valleys and lies between the high peaks of the western and eastern parts of the district. The southern region is entirely covered with the forests of the Periyar National Park.

Anamudi and Meesapulimala, the two highest peaks in India south of the Himalayas, are located in Idukki district. Anamudi is situated in the Kuttampuzha Panchayat of Adimali Block in the Kannan Devan Hills village of Devikulam taluk. Thirteen other peaks in the district exceed a height of . Periyar, Thodupuzhayar, Muthirappuzhayar, and Thalayar are the important rivers of the district. Idukki Dam, Asia&#x27;s largest arch dam, is located in the Idukki Township. The dam is located at the point where the Periyar flows through the gorge formed between two high and massive rocks known as &#x27;Kuravan&#x27; and &#x27;Kurathi&#x27;.

=== Climate change ===
Idukki has a large area of dense forest cover and shola forests. It is highly vulnerable to floods and drought and is considered a climate change hotspot in Kerala, along with the districts of Alappuzha, Palakkad, and Wayanad. Researchers attribute the increasing frequency in landslides in Idukki to climate change and deforestation. Changes in rainfall patterns caused by climate change, coupled with deforestation and large-scale construction projects, are among the contributing factors that led to the August 2020 landslide that killed 65 people, including plantation workers.

==Demographics==
According to the 2018 Statistics Report, Idukki district has a population of 1,093,156. The 2011 Census places it at 416th among the 640 districts of India. The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001–2011 was −1.93% due to emigration and low fertility rates. Idukki has a sex ratio of 1,006 females for every 1,000 males, and a literacy rate of 92.2 percent. 4.69% of the population lives in urban areas. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes make up 13.12% and 5.03% of the population respectively.

Malayalam and English are the two official administrative languages in the district. Around four-fifth of the people in Idukki district speak Malayalam as their mother tongue. The Taluks of Devikulam, Peerumedu and Udumbanchola have a considerable Tamil minority population. However Malayalis are majority in these taluks as well. The aboriginal tribes in the district speak their own dialects such as Malavedan, Malaryan, Muthuvan, and Paliyan, which are closely related to the Malayalam and Tamil.

==Tourism==
===Munnar===

Munnar was the summer resort of the British Government in the south. The town is situated at the convergence of three mountain streams, namely Muthirappuzha, Nallathanni, and Kundala. Munnar has some of the largest tea plantations in the world. This hill station, which is more than 5,000 feet above sea level, is a tourist attraction noted for its scenic landscapes. Most of the native flora and fauna of Munnar have disappeared due to severe habitat fragmentation resultant from the creation of the plantations. However, some species continue to survive and thrive in several protected areas nearby, including the new Kurinjimala Sanctuary to the east, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Manjampatti Valley, and the Amaravati reserve forest of Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary to the northeast, the Eravikulam National Park and Anamudi Shola National Park in the north, and the Pampadum Shola National Park to the south. The Palani Hills National Park is proposed to come up to the east of Idukki. These protected areas are especially known for several threatened and endemic species including the Nilgiri tahr, the grizzled giant squirrel, the Nilgiri wood-pigeon, the elephant, the gaur, the Nilgiri langur, the sambar, and the neelakurinji (that blossoms only once in twelve years).

The former Kundala Valley Railway in Munnar was destroyed by a flood in 1924, but tourism officials are considering reconstructing the railway line to attract tourists.

<doc id="890828" wikidata="Q5288050" url="?curid=890828" title="Doe River">
<text>The Doe River is a tributary of the Watauga River in northeast Tennessee in the United States. The river forms in Carter County near the North Carolina line, just south of Roan Mountain State Park, and flows to Elizabethton.

==Hydrography==
The Doe River flows from the northern slopes of Roan Mountain, through Roan Mountain State Park and the center of Roan Mountain, Tennessee, then continues to flow west and is paralleled by U.S. Route 19E. The stream then flows to the east of Fork Mountain; while the Little Doe River flows by Fork Mountain to the west.

===Hampton and Valley Forge===

Pushing through a mountain gap just north of Hampton, Tennessee, the volume of the Doe River is increased by the waters flowing from McCathern Spring. Below the confluence of both the Doe River and the Little Doe River at Hampton, the Doe River travels roughly in a northern direction through the Valley Forge community, and is rejoined by U.S. Route 19E outside of Elizabethton.

===Elizabethton===

====Elizabethton Covered Bridge====

Flowing parallel with U.S. Highway 19-E, the Doe River flows underneath two 19-E bridges at the East Side community before heading in a northwest angle toward the Elizabethton downtown business district. The Elizabethton Covered Bridge is located in downtown Elizabethton, the county seat of Carter County. Connecting 3rd Street and Hattie Avenue, the historic 1882 covered bridge spans the river is adjacent to a city park and county government areas. The bridge is open to pedestrians and bicyclists, but is closed to motor vehicle traffic.

The Doe River spills over a weir dam immediately downstream of the covered bridge, and flows under two 1928 concrete arch bridges in Elizabethton, prior to its confluence with the Watauga River. The first concrete arch bridge is the Elk Avenue Bridge in downtown Elizabethton; the second is locally known as the Broad Street Bridge and carries traffic on Tennessee State Route 67.

==Whitewater kayaking and river tubing==
Most of the Doe River section running between the Valley Forge put-in (LAT 36.310833 LONG -82.193055) and the take-out just before the Elizabethton confluence is classified on the International Scale of River Difficulty as Class/Grade I; however there are several brief segments of the Valley Forge-Charity Hill-East Side run that should be approached as Class/Grade II. It takes approximately three hours to float down the Doe River on inner tubes from the Valley Forge put-in to the take-out near the confluence of the Doe River into the Watauga River. Putting in at Hampton High School and taking out at Valley Forge Elementary involves running class 2/3 rapids and is more difficult that the section below Valley Forge school.

All river tubes and kayaks must portage around the weir dam that is located immediately downstream of the covered bridge in downtown Elizabethton.

There is a Class III/IV section of whitewater referred to as the Doe Gorge that begins at the bridge over the river on Bear Cage Rd. and ends at the take-out at Hampton High School. This sections drops between 100 and 160 feet per mile. The gorge is for advanced paddlers only. Paddling through Roan Mtn State Park has been done many times but is not as well documented as the popular gorge section downstream.

===Influence of weather===
Unlike the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) regulated flow of the Watauga River, the water level of the Doe River often fluctuates with changes in rain fall or drought. Another significant difference between the two Carter County rivers is the variation of water temperatures: while the year round water temperature of the Watauga River is approximately 52-53 degrees Fahrenheit, the water temperature of the Doe River will vary along with the ambient air temperature. The Doe River is generally very comfortable for kayaking and river tubing during the summer months.

The Doe River valley is infrequently subject to severe flooding. The Doe River drains from a mountainous region that can be subject to seasonal heavy rains (May-early June) and snow melts, and the Doe River stream course is in many parts quite steep, allowing water levels to rise rapidly along the river banks. The last severe recent flooding of the Doe River occurred overnight from January 7 through January 8, 1998, with the sudden storms bringing down seven inches (178 mm) of rain in twelve hours and causing the deaths of seven people (including Kingsport rescue worker Carles &quot;Junior&quot; Godsey after his rescue boat overturned in the Doe River flood waters) in the Hampton area. The 1998 Doe River flood created approximately $20 million in Carter County property damages.

<doc id="890829" wikidata="Q6606342" url="?curid=890829" title="List of athletes on Wheaties boxes">
<text>In 1934, the breakfast cereal Wheaties began the practice of including pictures of athletes on its packaging to coincide with its slogan, &quot;The Breakfast of Champions.&quot; In its original form, athletes were depicted on the sides or back of the cereal box, though in 1958 Wheaties began placing the pictures on the front of the box. The tradition has included hundreds of athletes from many different sports, and also team depictions.

This article lists the athletes or teams depicted on Wheaties boxes, along with the year(s) of depiction and sport played. This list is not all-inclusive, and athletes may have been shown together with teams and groups, or on the sides, back, or front of the box. Most athletes appeared on the standard Wheaties box, while others appeared on the Honey Frosted Wheaties (HFW), Crispy Wheaties &#x27;n&#x27; Raisins (CWR), Wheaties Energy Crunch (WEC), or Wheaties Fuel (WF) boxes.

Around 1990, General Mills did a promotion called &quot;Picture Yourself on a Wheaties Box,&quot; in which, for a fee, they would make a custom Wheaties box from one&#x27;s own photograph that was sealed in clear acrylic. Kristi Yamaguchi, among other athletes, was featured in advertising this campaign.

<doc id="890838" wikidata="Q2289229" url="?curid=890838" title="Single-wing formation">
<text>In American and Canadian football, a single-wing formation was a precursor to the modern shotgun formation. The term usually connotes formations in which the snap is tossed rather than handed. Formations with one wingback and a handed snap are commonly called &quot;wing T&quot; or &quot;winged T&quot;.

Created by Glenn &quot;Pop&quot; Warner, the single wing was deemed superior to the T formation in its ability to get an extra eligible receiver downfield.

==History==
Among coaches, single-wing football denotes a formation using a long snap from center as well as a deceptive scheme that evolved from Glenn &quot;Pop&quot; Warner&#x27;s offensive style. Traditionally, the single-wing was an offensive formation that featured a core of four backs including a tailback, a fullback, a quarterback (blocking back), and a wingback. Linemen were set &quot;unbalanced&quot;, with two on one side of the center and four on the other. This was done by moving the off-side guard or tackle to the strong side. The single-wing was one of the first formations attempting to trick the defense instead of overpowering it.

Pop Warner referred to his new offensive scheme as the Carlisle formation because he formulated most of the offense while coaching the Carlisle Indians. The term single-wing came into widespread use after spectators noticed that the formation gave the appearance of a wing-shape. In 1907, Warner coached at Carlisle, a school for Native Americans, where his legacy consisted of at least three significant events. The first was the discovery of Jim Thorpe&#x27;s raw athletic ability. The second was the use of an extensive passing game that relied on the spiraled ball. Finally, faking backs who started one way, but abruptly headed the opposite way, kept defenses guessing. Since Jim Thorpe had so much raw talent, Coach Warner more than likely designed much of his single-wing offense around this gifted athlete. Thorpe, the proverbial triple threat, was a good runner, passer, and punter.
For much of the history of the single-wing formation, players were expected to play on both sides of the ball. Consequently, offensive players often turned around to play a corresponding location on defense. The offensive backs played defensive backs, just as the offensive linemen played defensive linemen. Unlike teams of today, single-wing teams had few specialists who only played on certain downs.

College football playbooks before the 1950s were dominated with permutations of the traditional single-wing envisioned by Warner. Two-time All-American Jack Crain&#x27;s handwritten playbook clearly denotes how the University of Texas ran their version of the single-wing circa 1939–1940. University of Texas Coach Dana X. Bible ran a balanced line, which meant that each side of the center had the same number of linemen. The ends were also slightly split.

Slightly splitting offensive ends, called flexing, was in widespread use by Notre Dame&#x27;s Box variation of the single-wing. Knute Rockne&#x27;s Notre Dame Box offense employed a balanced line, which had 3 linemen on each side of the center. Another Rockne innovation was a shifting backfield that attempted to confuse the defense by moving backs to alternate positions right before the snap. Another variation of the single-wing saw the quarterback move out as a wingback on the weak side. Besides adding different blocking angles for the quarterback, the double-wing formation facilitated the passing game. Stanford had a variation on the double-wing in which the quarterback stayed right behind the strong side guard, while the tailback became the wingback to the weak side. The fullback, being the only deep back left, took all the snaps and directed the plays.

The advent of the T formation in the 1940s led to a decline in the use of single-wing formations. For example, the single-wing coach Dana X. Bible, upon his retirement in 1946, saw his replacement, Blair Cherry, quickly install the T formation like many other college coaches of the day. Wallace Wade said he was &quot;not convinced that the single wing is not a more potent formation than the T. The single wing we used caused the defense to spread. It called for more intensive coaching on individual assignments.&quot;

However, from 1949 to 1957, Henry &quot;Red&quot; Sanders elevated a rarely distinguished UCLA football program to an elite level with his precision single-wing system, winning a National Championship at UCLA in 1954.

The single-wing style of football is still practiced by a small group of teams across the country, almost exclusively at the high school and youth level. The Pittsburgh Steelers were the last NFL team to use the single-wing as their standard formation, finally switching to the T formation in 1952. In 2008, the Miami Dolphins utilized a version of the single-wing offense (calling it the &quot;wildcat&quot;) against the New England Patriots on six plays, which produced four touchdowns in a 38–13 upset victory, and again two weeks later, defeating the San Diego Chargers. In college football, by the early 1960s, the only major teams still relying on the single wing were Tennessee, UCLA, University of Pennsylvania and Princeton. Following 1964, only Princeton, which had been particularly known for the single wing under its longtime coach Charlie Caldwell, still used the formation, finally giving it up in 1969 after the retirement of Caldwell&#x27;s successor Dick Colman.

===Sutherland single wing===

The Sutherland single-wing was a variation used with great success by Coach Jock Sutherland of the 1930s and 1940s. Note that coach Sutherland mastered many forms of the single-wing, but the formation described here is the one he invented and was named after him.

The Sutherland single-wing differs from the traditional single-wing in that the wingback is brought into the backfield as a halfback, flanking the fullback on the other side from the tailback. This allows a more flexible running attack to the weak-side. Both the tailback and halfback are triple threats in this offense. The weakness of this formation is less power than the traditional single-wing and it requires very talented backs to play tailback and halfback effectively.

Sutherland created this formation from the original single-wing he learned from legendary coach Pop Warner at the University of Pittsburgh in the 1910s. Sutherland became the Pitt coach in 1924, where he remained through 1938. Sutherland&#x27;s Pitt teams were named &quot;National Champions&quot; by various selectors in nine different seasons, including five recognized by the university. Sutherland was the avowed master of the single-wing offense while at Pitt. Sutherland brought his coaching skills to the NFL in 1940 as the coach of the Brooklyn Dodgers. At Brooklyn, he took over a team that had never finished better than second and had only one winning season since 1930. He implemented his offensive ideas and the Dodgers finished with a record of 8–3 and finished only a game behind the Washington Redskins. Sutherland&#x27;s star was Ace Parker, who played tailback and was NFL MVP. The Dodgers also finished second in 1941, with a 7–4 mark. Later, Sutherland coached the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1946 and 1947. In 1947, Sutherland and his single-wing pushed the Steelers to their first playoff appearance, for the East Conference crown. They were soundly defeated by Greasy Neale&#x27;s Philadelphia Eagles, running the T-formation, 21–0. Sutherland died suddenly in 1948, but the Steelers continued to use his single-wing until 1953, when they were the last NFL team to switch to the T. Runningback Austin Horton also rushed for 1,245 yards during the Sutherland season.

===Double wing===
The double-wing is an offensive formation which should not be confused with the Double Wing offense. The double-wing formation is used in many offenses from the youth level through college. The formation was first introduced by Pop Warner around 1912. Just a few offenses that use the formation are the double wing, flexbone and wing T offenses. It was the primary formation used by Ara Parseghian when he ran the wing T at Notre Dame, winning National Championships in 1966 and 1973. 
The formation is not necessarily the same in all offenses and is a broad term to describe any offense with two wingbacks. In the wing T, the double-wing formation is used to refer to Red, Blue and Loose Red formations.

The double-wing formation in American football usually includes one wide receiver, two wingbacks, one fullback, and one tight end.

==Single-wing style of play==
The direct snap or toss from the center usually went to the tailback or fullback. However, the quarterback could also take the ball. The tailback was very important to the success of the offense because he had to run, pass, block, and even punt. Unlike today, the quarterback usually blocked at the point of attack. As with his modern-day counterpart, a single-wing quarterback might also act as a field general by calling plays. The fullback was chosen for his larger size so that he could &quot;buck&quot; the line. This meant that the fullback would block or carry the ball between the defensive tackles. The wingback could double-team block with an offensive lineman at scrimmage or even run a pass route.

The single-wing formation was designed to place double-team blocks at the point of attack. Gaining this extra blocker was achieved in several ways. First, the unbalanced line placed an extra guard or tackle on one side of the center. Second, a wingback stationed outside end could quickly move to a crucial blocking position. Third, the fullback and especially the quarterback could lead the ball carrier producing interference. Finally, linemen, usually guards, would pull at the snap and block at the specified hole. Line splits were always close except for ends that might move out from the tackle.

The single-wing formation depended on a center who was skilled both at blocking and at tossing the ball from between his legs to the receiving back. The center had to direct the ball to any of several moving backs, with extreme accuracy, as the play started. Single-wing plays would not work well if the back had to wait for the snap because quick defensive penetration would overrun the play. The center was taught to direct the ball to give the tailback or fullback receiver a running start in the direction that the play was designed to go. 

The single-wing formation was a deceptive formation with spectators, referees, and defensive players often losing sight of the ball. A backfield player, called a &quot;spinner&quot;, might turn 360 degrees while faking the ball to the other backs, or even keeping the ball or passing it. Defensive players were often fooled as to which back was carrying the ball.
The one play that was unique to the single-wing formation was the buck-lateral series. The terminology for this series of plays associates the word &quot;buck&quot; with the intent of the fullback to plunge into the line. In addition, the short toss, or lateral of the ball, can be made to the quarterback or wingback who may take the ball and do other maneuvers including passing the ball. Consequently, when the fullback takes the ball, he appears to be headed to buck the line. Typically, fullbacks were larger players that ran plays intended to smash the defensive front. The fullback&#x27;s initial move pulls the defensive players toward the expected point of attack. Next, the fullback tosses the ball to another back causing the defense to change pursuit angles, thus losing a step in their catching the ball carrier.
The strong side of the formation, where the extra lineman and wingback lined up, put pressure on the defensive end. Defenses might move extra players to that side or shift the whole defense to compensate. The cut-back play could succeed regardless of how the defense reacted. The cut-back play started like a strong side sweep with offensive guards and quarterback running interference for the tailback. The fullback would fake a smash over the guard hole to occupy the defensive tackles. The play was designed to make the defensive end overreact and try to stay outside to contain the runner. If the defensive end gave ground to the sideline, the tailback would cut-back inside to let his interference push the defensive end out of the play. If the defensive end came too far inside, then the ball carrier would run around him to the outside. After the cut-back play was used in a game, then the offense might run the wingback reverse since both plays started out the same way. At the outset, the defense tries to pursue the sweeping tailback. However, the tailback delivers the ball to the wingback running the opposite way to the weak side. Both the cut-back and the reverse would be set up with quick fullback bucks up the middle, which would cause the defensive line to over-protect their gaps, as opposed to pursuing quickly to the sideline.

Single-wing teams used both a standard punting formation and a quick punt, often kicking on second or third downs. The quick punt, or quick kick, saw the tailback-punter swiftly backing up 5 yards as the ball was in the air from the center to distance himself from rushers. The strategy was to prevent defensive halfbacks, expecting a possession play, from dropping back to return the ball. The standard punt formation was often used for either punting as well as running or passing the ball. Most teams had a litany of plays that they might run from a punt formation.

Prior to 1930, the shape of the football was a prominent oval shape called a prolate spheroid. Due to the shape of the ball, single-wing backs handled the ball more like a basketball, with short tosses and underhand lobs. Gradually, balls were allowed to be elongated enough to produce streamlined passes with a spiral. The spiraled ball could be thrown further with more accuracy, thus increasing the potential for offenses to use the forward pass more frequently.

The single-wing quarterback played a different role than modern-day quarterbacks. While the quarterback may have called the snap count due to his position close to the center of the formation, he may not have called the actual play in the huddle. For much of the history of football, coaches were not allowed to call plays from the sideline. This responsibility may have gone to the team captain. The quarterback was expected to be an excellent blocker at the point of attack. Some playbooks referred to this player as the blocking back. The quarterback also had to handle the ball by faking, handing off, or optioning to other backs.

==Modern use==
Although the single-wing has lost much of its popularity since the 1950s, its characteristic features are still prevalent in all levels of modern football. They include pulling guards, double teams, play action passes, laterals, wedge blocking, trap blocking, the sweep, the reverse and the quick kick. Many current offenses, such as the spread option, use single-wing tendencies for running plays, while using wide receivers instead of wingbacks.
Once a strong running formation, the single wing has been replaced by formations that facilitate passing, while minimizing the running aspect of the game. Today the single-wing has evolved into what coaches call the spread offense or shotgun, with the emphasis on passing. The most noticeable feature that remains of the powerful Carlisle formation is the long toss from center to the main ball-handler. The main talent and field general has become the quarterback instead of the tailback. The other single-wing backs have moved close to the line of scrimmage and are split further from the main line. Wide receivers are called split-ends, flex ends, slots, and flankers. Also, linemen spacing has increased in distance. Moving offensive players further apart serves the purpose of also spreading the defense. The goal is to make defenses cover the whole field on every play.

The current incarnation of the Wildcat offense, which has been adopted by many college, NFL, and high school teams, uses many elements of the single-wing formation.

===Successful teams===
The single-wing has had a successful revival in youth leagues, middle schools, high schools, and some colleges. Here are some examples of single-wing high school teams that have had success all across the country. In 2005, Virginia saw three teams ride the single-wing to the state playoffs. Two of the three teams, Giles High School and Osbourn High School, actually won their division. Giles High School returned to the state championship game in 2006, and also won state championships using the single wing in both 1980 and 2013. In 1998 and 1999, Park View High School in Sterling, Virginia advanced to consecutive state championships using the single wing offense. When Park View coach Mickey Thompson moved to nearby Stone Bridge High School in 2000, he took the single wing with him. As a result, the Bulldogs have won 12 District titles, 9 Region titles and won the 2007, 2020, and 2021 AAA Division 5 State title games. On February 1, 2010, Stone Bridge Offensive Coordinator Matt &quot;Hate-Dog&quot; Griffis was named Head Coach of nearby Broad Run High School. Griffis announced he will be running the Single Wing as well as his hybrid Single Wing formation dubbed the &quot;Griff-Bone&quot;. Tower Hill School in Wilmington, Delaware perfected this formation which led to numerous state championships. Warren County High School in Front Royal, Va. also used the single-wing to moderate success. In Louisa County, Va., the local high school has had similar success by running the single-wing formation since 2003.

Colton California has been a consistently successful single-wing team by reaching the state playoffs on six consecutive seasons.

In 1998, The Menominee Maroons won the Michigan high school class BB football championship, and in 2006 and 2007 won the Michigan High School Class B football championship, winning 28 consecutive games over the last 2 years, and reaching the state playoffs for the last 11 years.

In 1971, the Corning High School Cardinals of Corning, California had a 9–0 undefeated season utilizing a balanced single-wing offense under coach Tag McFadden. They were the number one rated school Division 4 in the state and McFadden was garnered coach of year by Cal-Hi Sports.

In 1974 and 1975, St. Mark&#x27;s School (MA) compiled a 13–1 record running the Princeton Single Wing.

In 1980, Coach Ted Hern brought the single-wing to Moriarty High School, the &quot;Fighting&quot; Pintos made three state championship appearances winning 2 state titles, one undefeated season and suffering only 3 losses in four seasons. Coach Frank Ortiz was an assistant coach in the later seasons.

Since 1985, Santa Rosa High School has used the single-wing formation under Coach Frank Ortiz. The Lions have made the playoffs every year except three, won their district title 17 times, won the New Mexico AA State Championships in 1993, 1996, 1998, 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2012 and made a total of 13 State Finals appearances.

Xavier High School&#x27;s (NYC) Head Coach Chris Stevens recently changed the team&#x27;s offense to the single-wing. In 2007, they went 11–1, and averaged 39 points in the New York Catholic High School Football League A Division. They had two 1,000-yard rushers in Seamus Kelly and Jimmy Kowalski, while both also scored 17 TDs. In the championship game trailing by two scores with less than 8 minutes to play, Xavier scored 31 unanswered points to win their first championship in over 10 years. The following week they beat Fordham Prep 20–14 in the annual &quot;Turkey Bowl&quot;, a game that dates back to the late 1800s. Running the single-wing since 2006, they have been at the top of league in rushing. In 2007, they were in the top three rushing and scoring schools in New York. They again won a championship in the New York Catholic High School Football League in 2012 this one coming in the AA division. They averaged 34 points a game scoring 35 or more points 9 times, rushed for 46 touchdowns and 3,700 yards with a 9–2 record.

In 2005, St. Mary&#x27;s of Lynn in Massachusetts won the D4A Eastern Mass Title following two consecutive division titles with Ed Melanson running the Single Wing. Prior to Coach Melanson installing the Single Wing there in 2002, St. Mary&#x27;s had not had a winning season since 1977.

In Kansas, Mark Bliss installed the Single Wing offense at Conway Springs High School in 1997, coaching the team to Kansas Class 3A state championships in 1998, 2001, 2002, and 2003. During his seven seasons at Conway Springs, his teams compiled a record of 81–4, including a 62-game winning streak. Conway Springs continues to run the Single Wing offense and added state titles in 2004, 2008, and again in 2011 and are perennial playoffs contenders under Coach Matt Biehler.

In Kansas, Ed Buller created a football dynasty centered around the Single Wing offense. In his 40 years of coaching, which ended in 1984, Buller&#x27;s only losing season was his first. Buller compiled a record of 335–78–7 and coached the Clyde Bluejays to 10 undefeated seasons along with 39 consecutive winning seasons.

In Nebraska Dave Cisar&#x27;s Screaming Eagle youth football teams have been running the Single Wing offense for 8 seasons. During that time period those teams have gone 78-5 and averaged over 35 points per contest and won two State Titles. He did this with 6 totally different teams in 4 different leagues in various age groups. His teams even used the famous &quot;fullback full spinner series&quot; along with the other traditional Single Wing plays. Coach Cisar published a book &quot;Winning Youth Football a Step by Step Plan&quot; in 2006 to help youth coaches install this &quot;old school&quot; offense.

In Connecticut, Anthony Sagnella runs the single wing with his North Haven High School Team that reached the 2015 Class L state Championship Game and were defeated by New Caanan, 42–35. Tailback Mike Montano was an All-State Selection as a RB with over 1800 Rushing yards and 30 TDs. More recently, Sagnella won back-to-back CIAC Class MM State Championships running the single wing in 2022 and 2023 with Adam Pandolfi at Taiback. 

In Colorado, Brian Christensen&#x27;s Akron Rams (Class 1A) high school football team has made running the Single Wing offense a local tradition. Akron won back-to-back undefeated state championships in 2001 and 2002. They also took home State titles in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Christensen&#x27;s teams have made the playoffs every year since 1996 and have made it to at least the semi-finals of the state playoffs all but 4 times within that span. The Akron Rams are renowned for their &quot;exceptional prowess executing the single-wing offense.&quot; One coach characterized Akron&#x27;s single-wing attack as, &quot;A Chinese fire-drill in the backfield every single play. You have to play mistake-free defense or Akron&#x27;s single-wing attack will burn you.&quot; Christensen took over the Akron program in 1996, his overall record at Akron is: 163–31 (.841 winning percentage).

In Iowa, Bob Howard, the coach of the Sigourney-Keota Savage Cobras (2A), has led the Cobras to three state championships (1995, 2001, 2005), using the single-wing offense. He used the offense when he first started coaching at Sigourney in the 1970s, before Sigourney and Keota conjoined teams. In 2005 the vaulted Cobra single-wing offense set a new state record for points in a season with 696, 537 of which coming in the nine regular season games, and in 2007 the Cobras set a new state rushing record racking up 718 yards in a single game. Howard left Sigourney-Keota after the 2006 season to become the new head coach at Webster City High School and was charged with rebuilding a once-proud program that hadn&#x27;t won over six games or made the Class 3A playoffs since 1996. Installing his vaunted single-wing offense, in 2007 the Lynx led District 2 in rushing by gaining over 2,200 yards on the ground despite their overall record of 3–6. However, in 2008, the Lynx not only made the playoffs for the first time in 12 years, but also finished the season with a final record of 7–4. Tailback John Hill rushed for 1,420 yards—the sixth highest total in school history.

On September 21, 2008, the Miami Dolphins used a version of the single-wing offense (specifically the Wildcat offense) against the New England Patriots on six plays, which produced five touchdowns (four rushing and one passing) in a 38–13 upset victory, after its successful adoption on the college and high school level by several teams.

The 1957 Cass Township, exclusively used single-wing offense. The Cass (Schuylkill County) PA Condors rolled through a season unbeaten, untied, and unscored upon over 50 years ago, going 9–0 in the regular season before defeating Shamokin, 2–0, in a special playoff for the Eastern Conference Southern Division title for a season of 10–0. They are the only high school football team in Pennsylvania that can lay claim to that feat. The late Coach Pat Droskinis, listed in the PA Sports Hall of Fame, coached them and led by a strong 4–5–2 defense that featured All-State ends in 6-foot-3 Russ Frantz and 6-2 Harry Butsko, the Cass Twp Condors blanked Minersville, Nescopeck, West Mahanoy Township, Schuylkill Haven, Ashland, Blythe Township, Mahanoy Township, Lansford and Saint Clair, and then Shamokin in the playoff game (2–0).

In Pittsburgh, Coach Pete Dimperio ran the single wing at Westinghouse High School from 1946 to this retirement in 1966. Westinghouse played in the City League championship game every one of those 21 years and they won 17 times. Coach Dimperio&#x27;s league play record was a phenomenal 118–5–1 and (158–26–1 overall). His Bulldog teams ran the single-wing formation with mostly buck-lateral and fullback spinner plays. He did not use a multitude of plays, rather he won because his players were so well-schooled and disciplined they were all but unstoppable. When Coach Dimperio started at Westinghouse the student body was mostly the children of Italian immigrants, but by the late 1950s it was almost 100% African American. It didn&#x27;t matter to Coach Dimperio; he and his single wing won nonetheless. Being from a relatively poor inner city school, Westinghouse usually had no assistant coaches and rarely suited up more than 40 players. Yet, in exhibition games against some of the biggest suburban schools, Westinghouse usually won. Once in an exhibition game against South Hills Catholic which suited up 90 players and had five coaches, Coach Dimperio&#x27;s deceptive single wing made mincemeat of the heavier and slow opponent to the point where one of the South Hills Catholic coaches remarked, &quot;they (the Westinghouse backs) ran down the field so many times it looked like track practice.&quot; Coach Dimperio was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 1964.

Keith W. Piper, head coach at Denison University (Ohio) had played center in the single wing in high school and at Baldwin-Wallace University, and he went against trends by using that offense for three seasons at Denison in the early 1960s. After the Big Red went 0–8–1 in 1977, he returned to the single wing for good because tailback Clay Sampson offered a dual threat. He became the only player in Division III history to rush for 3,000 yards and pass for 3,000 in a career when he totaled 6,920 yards for Denison from 1977 to &#x27;80. In 1985, Piper&#x27;s single wing offense featured a potent mix of speed, athleticism and experience that produced an average victory margin of 29.6 points. That year Denison set nine school season team records—including most total yards of offense (4,330), most rushing yards (3,510) and most points (377)—and set five single game school marks.

<doc id="890844" wikidata="Q177888" url="?curid=890844" title="Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg">
<text>Pavlovsk ( &quot;[the town] of Pavel&quot; after Emperor Pavel (Paul) of Russia) is a municipal town in Pushkinsky District in the suburban part of the federal city of Saint Petersburg, Russia, located south from Saint Petersburg proper and about southeast from Pushkin. Population: Known since the late 18th century, when Saint Petersburg was the capital of Russian Empire, as a countryside residence of Russian royal family commissioned creation of the town&#x27;s landmark -palace with a large park, now parts of its federal museum reserve.

The town developed around the Pavlovsk Palace, a major residence of the Russian imperial family. Between 1918 and 1944, its official name was Slutsk, after the revolutionary Vera Slutskaya, and then was changed back to Pavlovsk. Pavlovsk is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments&quot;.

==History==
===Fortress===
A wooden fortress was built by Russians on the place of Pavlovsk and was known from at least 13th century as part of an Administrative division of Novgorod Land. The fortress and the entire region were later captured by the Swedes. On 13 August 1702, the Russian army led by Peter the Great and Fyodor Apraksin met Swedes at the Izhora river and pushed them to the fortress. For several days, the Swedish Army was reinforcing their positions but were expelled upon a surprise frontal attack.

Paul I, an avid fan of the military, had long dreamed of building a stone fortress on the ruins of the Swedish forts. After he became an emperor, in 1796, he hired the Italian architect Vincenzo Brenna and raised money for the project. By 1798 Brenna raised a Gothic folly, Bip fortress, which fascinated Paul so much that he listed it on the Army register of real fortresses. After the death of Catherine, Paul and Brenna expanded the Pavlovsk estate with real military barracks, officers&#x27; quarters and a hospital.

===Imperial residence===
Catherine the Great liked the nature in Pavlovsk area and frequently visited it for hunting trips. In December 1777, she assigned to her son, Paul I, 362 desyatinas (977 acres; 395 ha) of land along the Slavyanka river, together with forests, arable land and two small villages with peasants. This was a present to Paul and his wife Maria Feodorovna on the occasion of the birth of their first son, the future Emperor Alexander I of Russia. This date is considered the founding date of the Pavlovskoye village (the name Pavlovsk derives from Paul&#x27;s name in Russian, &quot;Pavel&quot;). Catherine commissioned the Scottish architect Charles Cameron, who had previously done much work for her in the nearby Tsarskoye Selo, to design a palace and a park in Pavlovskoye.

Between 1782 and 1786 Cameron built the original palace core that survives to date, the Temple of Friendship, Private Gardens, Aviary, Apollo Colonnade and the Lime Avenue. He also planned the original landscape including the huge English park with numerous temples, colonnades, bridges, and statues. The Temple of Friendship was the first building in Pavlovsk, followed by the main palace. However, Cameron&#x27;s Pavlovsk was far from Paul&#x27;s vision of what an imperial residence should be: it lacked moats, forts and all other military assortments so dear to Paul; &quot;Cameron created a markedly private world for the Grand Duke. The palace could have belonged to anyone. not to the tsar of Russia in waiting.&quot; Constrained financially, Paul and Maria closely watched Cameron&#x27;s progress and regularly curbed his far-reaching, expensive plans. Between 1786 and 1789 Cameron&#x27;s duties in Pavlovsk passed to Brenna.

Paul personally hired Brenna, then employed by Stanisław Kostka Potocki, in 1782, and used him in 1783–1785 to visualize his architectural fantasies. Brenna left Cameron&#x27;s palace core intact, extending it with side wings; although he remodeled the interiors, they bear traces of Cameron&#x27;s style to date. However, Maria&#x27;s private suite and the militaria displayed in public halls are attributed to Brenna alone.

In 1794, the population of Pavlovskoye counted 300 people, mostly peasants and palace servants. There was a stone church, a free public school for peasants and three hospitals: regular, military and for invalids. Later, an agriculture school and the first in Russia school for the deaf were established in Pavlovskoye. Between 1807 and 1810, the school for the deaf was located in the Bip fortress. Later, a military regiment was stationed and practiced there. Theatrical performances were regularly staged first in the palace and since 1794 in the theater built nearby by Brenna.

Pavel favored as his residence Gatchina to Pavlovskoye, and therefore, since 1788 the latter was managed by his wife who had contributed most to its well-being. Maria Feodorovna enjoyed animal husbandry (she used to milk cows herself) and thus built a large farm at the edge of the park and a wooden pavilion for studies. She was also a skilled artist, a member of Berlin Academy of Arts, and her numerous handicrafts still remain in the palace. A large collection of books was accumulated in the palace by her efforts. In 1796, the village received a status of a town and renamed to Pavlovsk.

===After Paul I===

After Paul&#x27;s death in 1801 the palace was proclaimed a residence of his widow, Maria Feodorovna. During that time, it was frequently visited by famous poets and novelists including Sergey Glinka, Nikolay Karamzin and Ivan Krylov. Vasily Zhukovsky was a regular reader for Maria Feodorovna and the teacher of Russian language and literature for Princess Charlotte of Württemberg, the wife of Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich of Russia who inherited Pavlovsk after the death of Maria Feodorovna in 1828. Michael Pavlovich spent his childhood in Pavlovsk, and then cared much about the city. Being a military person, he mostly improved well-being of the military corps staged near Pavlovsk and built barracks, riding stables, forge and workshops. But he also improved the roads of Pavlovsk, donated significant amounts to the church and established an orphanage and a school for middle-class children.

In the 19th century, Pavlovsk became a favorite summer retreat for well-to-do inhabitants of the Russian capital. The life of Pavlovsk&#x27;s &quot;dachniki&quot; was described by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who frequently visited the town, in his novel &quot;The Idiot&quot;. To facilitate transportation, the first railway in Russia, the Tsarskoe Selo Railway, was built around 1836. The first test runs were performed between Pavlovsk and Tsarskoye Selo using carriages horse-drawn over the rails. Regular trains powered by steam locomotives began operating between Pavlovsk and St. Petersburg from May 1838. Aiming to promote the railway, the Pavlovsk terminus was built in 1836–1838 as an entertainment center. It regularly hosted evening festivities, and Johann Strauss II (1856), Franz Liszt, Robert Schumann and Feodor Chaliapin were among the celebrities who performed there. The station was called &#x27;Vauxhall Pavilion&#x27;, and its fame eventually caused the word &quot;voksal&quot; (воксал) to enter the Russian language, with the meaning &quot;substantial railway station building&quot;.

Michael Pavlovich died in 1849 leaving no heir, and thus Pavlovsk became property of a son of Nicholas I, Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia. Konstantin Nikolayevich established in 1872 an art gallery and a museum in the palace and opened them for public access. He also promoted construction in 1876 of a laboratory dedicated to meteorology and study of magnetic fields on the outskirts of the park. Pavlovsk became a popular residence and by 1874 had 323 summer cottages. The celebrities living here included Alexander Brullov, Peter Clodt von Jürgensburg and Vladimir Sollogub.

===Birthplace of Russian Scouting===
On 30 April 1909, a young officer, Colonel Oleg Pantyukhov, organized the first Russian Scout troop &quot;Beaver&quot; (, &quot;Bobr&quot;) in Pavlovsk. In 1910, General Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout Movement, visited Nicholas II in Tsarskoye Selo. They had a pleasant conversation, and a Scouting badge was issued to Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia. In 1914, Pantyukhov established a society called &quot;Russian Scout&quot; (, &quot;Russkiy Skaut&quot;). The first Russian Scout campfire was lit in the woods of Pavlovsk Park. After the October Revolution of 1917, and during the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1920, most of the Scoutmasters and many Scouts fought in the ranks of the White Army and interventionists against the Red Army; the Scout movement was therefore regarded negatively in the Soviet Union and disbanded after the war.

===Soviet era to present===
After the October Revolution of 1917, the Pavlovsk palace and park were nationalized and converted to a public-access museum. In a general motion to replace the Tsar&#x27;s name, the town was renamed to Slutsk, after revolutionary Vera Slutskaya who died nearby in 1917. Later it was often mentioned in the documents under a double name Slutsk (Pavlovsk), and eventually regained the old name in 1944.

Pavlovsk suffered much from the German occupation during World War II (16 September 1941 – 24 January 1944) – the entire water system of the park and about 70,000 trees were destroyed, the palace was severely damaged by the fire of January 1944, and about 40% of exhibitions were stolen or destroyed (the rest was evacuated to Siberia before the arrival of the Germans). The old train station was burned down and rebuilt in the 1950s by A. E. Levinson. The town was liberated as a result of the Krasnoye Selo–Ropsha offensive. Restoration works started in 1944 and were completed by 1973. Nowadays about 1.5 million tourists visit Pavlovsk annually.

In 1954, Pavlovsk was transferred under the jurisdiction of St. Petersburg. In 1989, it was included into the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites as part of the Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments. In 2003, historical names were returned to dozens of streets of Pavlovsk which had been renamed during the Soviet era.

==Geology==
The town is located on the Neva Lowland, to the left of the river Neva, in the valley of the Slavyanka River. The landscape is quite varied and contains hills, ridges and terraces intermixed with valleys, plains, forests and farmland. Numerous springs give rise to streams and feed ponds. In the Paleozoic era, 300–400 million years ago, the area was covered by a sea. Sediments of that time form a layer thicker than 200 meters on top of the Baltic Shield consisting of granite, gneiss and diabase. The modern topography was shaped by the glacier retreat some 12,000 years ago which created the Littorina Sea. About 4,000 years ago the sea receded and formed the valley of the Neva River which has not changed much over the last 2,500 years.

==Climate==
The climate of Pavlovsk is temperate and wet, it has a continental climate. The length of the day varies from 5 hours and 51 minutes in the winter solstice to 18 hours and 50 minutes in the summer solstice. Summer is short and moderately warm, whereas winter is long and uneven, with frequent thaws. Air temperatures above prevail from early April to mid-November. The coldest month is February. Winds mostly blow southward and frequently change air mass above the city. Summer is dominated by westerly and northwesterly winds, and the wind direction changes to westerly and southwesterly in winter. The cloudiest months are November, December and January, and the least cloudy are May, June and July. There are at least 240 sunny days per year. Between May 25 and July 16, white nights are observed when the sun only briefly goes over the horizon and the day lasts nearly nineteen hours. The area is mostly fed by surface and ground waters.

==Soil, vegetation and wildlife==

Prior to the founding of the town the area was covered by temperate coniferous forests (mostly pine and fir) with an admixture of broad-leaved trees and fens. The soils were mostly podzol, combined with peat and gleysols. Intensive economic activities changed the original forest landscape to agricultural land with small groves of aspen, birch, alder and willow. In the 18–19th centuries, a large park area of almost 600 hectares (Pavlovsk and Arensky parks) has been created in and around the city.

Owing to the parks and environment-friendly policies, the Pavlovsk area has relatively low level of pollution. In 1978–1983 the Pavlovsk Park contained more than 360,000 trees of 54 species: 16 species of spruce, pine, larch and fir, two species of birch, two species of willow, two of basswood, oaks, elm, alder, aspen, European rowan, bird cherry, 88 shrub species, of which the dominant were yellow acacia, meadowsweet and dogwoods. In 1978, there were 71 species of birds belonging to 28 families and 9 orders. Mammals include squirrels, hares, weasels, stoats, moles, shrews, hedgehogs, red voles and muskrats. In winter, the parks are sometimes visited by fox, wild boar and moose. Amphibians and reptiles are mostly frogs, toads and lizards. There are 87 species of insects belonging to 46 families.

As most rivers of Saint Petersburg, the Slavyanka River is polluted. Water analysis performed by Greenpeace in 2008 reveals contamination levels exceeding the permissible norms by tens or hundreds times, with such chemicals as oil, lead, acetone, mercury, chloroform and others. Most pollution originates from household waste deposited by 16 companies.

==Population==
As of the 2010 Census, 16,087 people lived in Pavlovsk of which 45.3% were males and 54.7% females.

==Politics==
On 3 June 1797, the City Council was established, headed by the chief administrator. It controlled the entire life of Pavlovsk.

The modern structure of local government bodies consists of:
* the representative body of the municipal formation - the Municipal Council. Operating since 1997. As a result of the elections on 14 September 2014, a new composition of the 5th convocation was elected. Of the 10 deputies, 8 are from United Russia, 2 are self-nominated. (one self-nominated candidate later resigned).
* The head of the municipal entity. Exercises the powers of the chairman of the Municipal Council and is the highest official of the municipal entity.
* The executive and administrative body of the municipality is the Local Administration.

The head of the municipality of the city of Pavlovsk is Valery Viktorovich Zibarev.

The head of the local administration of the city of Pavlovsk is Mikhail Yuryevich Syzrantsev.

==Coat of arms==
The first coat of arms of Pavlovsk was approved by Alexander I in 1801. It features a black double-headed eagle with a white Maltese cross on its chest and the Order of St. Andrew hanging on a chain under it. On top of the cross there is a red shield with a monogram combining Russian italic letters П and М standing for Emperor Paul and Empress Maria. The eagle has gilded beaks and paws. It holds a ceremonial mace and globus cruciger in the paws; it is crowned with two golden crowns with two more crowns near its heads. The whole composition is placed on a golden shield. There was a proposal of an alternative coat during the Soviet times, but it was not approved. The updated coat of arms was adopted on 19 September 2007. It has the same composition but with slightly simplified shapes and colors. The modern flag of Pavlovsk was adopted on the same day. It contains the coat image on a yellow rectangle with the length to width ratio of 3:2.

==Cityscape==
The center of the town is Pavlovsk Palace consisting of main body and wings connected with it by galleries. In front of the palace, welcoming the visitors stands bronze monument of Paul. It is an 1872 copy of the original cast by Giovanni Vitali. North to it lies Pavlovsk Park which covers 2/3 of the town area. With the area of about 600 hectares, the park is one of the largest in Russia and Europe. Seven parts are distinguished within the park. There are numerous pavilions, and one part contains a collection of bronze statues. The Bip fortress, a favorite of young Paul I, was burned down during World War II and only its walls remained; it was restored by 2010.

Before 1917 there was no separation between the imperial residence and the town, and both belonged to one owner. Along the southern and western borders of the park run the main street, which is now called Sadovaya Street, and its previous names were Fyodorovskaya (before 1783), Tsarskoselskaya (1783–1919) and Revolyutsii (Soviet time). On the west, this street leads to the train terminal and then to Pushkin. The western border of the town is the railway St. Petersburg – Vitebsk.
There are several churches near the palace, the oldest being Maria Magdalena Church and Church of Peter and Paul (built in 1799 by Brenna). The former was raised in 1781–1784 by Giacomo Quarenghi and is the first classical stone building in Pavlovsk. More prominent however is the Cathedral of St. Nicholas in honor of Paul I, an active Orthodox church built in 1900–1904 by Alexander von Hohen in the Russian Revival style.

<text>Pit Bull was a debate show that aired live every Saturday on Speed during the 2004 NASCAR season. The show took place outside of every venue of the NASCAR Cup Series. Host Steve Byrnes moderated debates involving a four-person panel of sportswriters whose columns are mostly about racing. The three primary panelists were Mike Mulhern of the &quot;Winston-Salem Journal&quot;, David Poole of &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, and Marty Smith of NASCAR.com. The fourth panelist usually rotated between writers like Ben Blake, Lee Spencer of &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, and Speed Channel website writer Robin Miller. The panelists eventually became known as the &quot;Pit Hogs.&quot;

==Format==
Each week, the panel debated hot topics from the NASCAR world. At the end of the show, the four panelists got time to state their &quot;beef&quot; with an issue in NASCAR. It could&#x27;ve been a topic not yet touched on, a past issue, or a current issue. A live audience watched the show up-close each week. Each episode was a half-hour long.

==Criticism==
The show drew ire from NASCAR officials and drivers for its panelists&#x27; consistently questioning a NASCAR ruling or such. Then, one night, on another SPEED program, &quot;NASCAR Inside Nextel Cup&quot;, NASCAR driver Jimmy Spencer, a panelist on that night&#x27;s episode, slammed &quot;Pit Bull&quot; as being &quot;anti-NASCAR.&quot; Many &quot;Pit Bull&quot; fans jokingly claimed that since they agreed with most of what was being questioned of NASCAR by the panel (and most of the time, it was Mulhern and Blake doing the questioning) that they were &quot;anti-NASCAR&quot;, even though they were NASCAR fans.

&quot;Pit Bull&quot; debuted in February 2004, but on November 23, 2004, it was announced by SPEED that low ratings would keep the show from returning in 2005. Many &quot;Pit Bull&quot; viewers were upset by the announcement, accusing NASCAR of having a say in the show&#x27;s cancellation because of its ability to question them. However, another similar NASCAR-related debate show debuted in 2006, named &quot;Tradin&#x27; Paint&quot;, featuring NASCAR drivers like Kyle Petty as panelists debating NASCAR issues in a similar fashion. &quot;Tradin&#x27; Paint&quot; would run until the 2009 NASCAR season.

<text>William Van Mildert (6 November 1765 – 21 February 1836) was the bishop of Durham (1826–1836), and the last to rule the county palatine of Durham. He was also one of the founders of the University of Durham, where he is commemorated in the names of Van Mildert College, founded in 1965, and the Van Mildert Professor of Divinity.

==Life==
He was the son of Cornelius van Mildert, a gin distiller, and his wife Martha née Hill. Cornelius Van Mildert was the great-grandson of an Amsterdam merchant who migrated to London around 1670, Martha the daughter of William Hill of Vauxhall, Surrey, merchant and financier. William van Mildert was educated at St Saviour&#x27;s Grammar School and Merchant Taylors&#x27; School. He matriculated at the Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1784, graduating B.A. 1787, M.A. 1790, B.D. &amp; D.D. 1813. He delivered the Boyle Lectures in 1804 and the Bampton Lectures in &quot;1814&quot;, and was Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford and a canon of Christ Church, Oxford from 1813 to 1820.

Loosely attached to the high church party, he was appointed Bishop of Llandaff from 1819 to 1826, a post which he held in commendam with the Deanery of St Paul&#x27;s between 1820 and 1826, when he was translated to Durham. Prior to this, he was in 1790 the curate of Witham, Essex, where he met Jane (1760–1837), daughter of General Douglas, whom he married in 1795. He became rector of the church of St. Mary-le-Bow in London in 1796. Van Mildert is often described as a &#x27;stormy petrel&#x27; on account of his outspoken expression of his views. As Bishop of Llandaff he broke with the practice of his predecessors and actually resided in the diocese. As the bishop&#x27;s palace had fallen to ruin, he rented Coldbrook House near Abergavenny. During his time in Llandaff, he gained a reputation as &quot;a conscientious diocesan&quot;.

As part of the University of Durham&#x27;s foundation, behind which he was the driving force, he gave Durham Castle to the university, where it became the home of University College. Auckland Castle therefore became the sole residence of the Bishop of Durham. In addition, he donated a large number of buildings on Palace Green, between the castle and the cathedral. These are currently in use by various departments of the university (principally law, music and a small portion of the University Library).

In 1833, he gave 5 acres of land and a lot previously used as a burial pit during the 1831 Cholera Outbreak to the town of Stockton. Using funds allocated during the Church Building Act 1818, he ordered the construction of the gothic style Holy Trinity Church. This site is now in ruin, and is a Grade II* listed building in the park of Trinity Green. Van Mildert had a substantial library, sold at auction by Wheatley in London on 15 June 1836 (and nine following days), comprising 2138 lots; a copy of the catalogue is held at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.153(11)).

Van Mildert was the last Bishop of Durham with significant temporal powers. Those &quot;de jure&quot; vestiges of feudal jurisprudence were removed and returned to the Crown after his death in 1836 by the Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836.

In truth, most of the secular power of the bishop of Durham had already been removed by that time. The Great Reform Act 1832 saw the removal of most of the bishop&#x27;s powers — although he maintained a seat in the House of Lords — and the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 had given the governing power of the town of Durham to an elected body.

<text>L-attributed grammars are a special type of attribute grammars. They allow the attributes to be evaluated in one depth-first left-to-right traversal of the abstract syntax tree. As a result, attribute evaluation in L-attributed grammars can be incorporated conveniently in top-down parsing. 

A syntax-directed definition is L-attributed if each &quot;inherited&quot; attribute of formula_1 on the right side of formula_2 depends only on 

# the attributes of the symbols formula_3
# the inherited attributes of formula_4 (but not its synthesized attributes)

Every S-attributed syntax-directed definition is also L-attributed.

Implementing L-attributed definitions in Bottom-Up parsers requires rewriting L-attributed definitions into translation schemes.

Many programming languages are L-attributed. Special types of compilers, the narrow compilers, are based on some form of L-attributed grammar. These are a strict superset of S-attributed grammars. Used for code synthesis.

Either &quot;inherited attributes&quot; or &quot;synthesized attributes&quot; associated with the occurrence of symbol formula_5.

<text>The Muscat family of grapes includes over 200 grape varieties belonging to the &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; species that have been used in wine production and as raisin and table grapes around the globe for many centuries. Their colors range from white (such as Muscat Ottonel), to yellow (Moscato Giallo), to pink (Moscato Rosa del Trentino) to near black (Muscat Hamburg). Muscat grapes and wines almost always have a pronounced floral aroma. The breadth and number of varieties of Muscat suggest that it is perhaps the oldest domesticated grape variety, and there are theories that most families within the &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; grape variety are descended from the Muscat variety.

Among the most notable members of the Muscat family are Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains, which is the primary grape variety used in the production of the Italian sparkling wine Asti (also known as &quot;Moscato d&#x27;Asti&quot;) made in the Piedmont region. It is also used in the production of many of the French fortified wines known as &quot;vin doux naturels&quot;. In Australia, this is also the main grape used in the production of Liqueur Muscat, from the Victorian wine region of Rutherglen. Young, unaged and unfortified examples of Muscat blanc tend to exhibit the characteristic Muscat &quot;grapey&quot; aroma as well as citrus, rose and peach notes. Fortified and aged examples (particularly those that have been barrel aged) tend to be very dark in color due to oxidation with aroma notes of coffee, fruit cake, raisins and toffee.

Muscat of Alexandria is another Muscat variety commonly used in the production of French &quot;vin doux naturel&quot;, but it is also found in Spain, where it is used to make many of the fortified Spanish Moscatels. Elsewhere it is used to make off-dry to sweet white wines, often labeled as &quot;Moscato&quot; in Australia, California and South Africa. In Alsace and parts of Central Europe, Muscat Ottonel is used to produce usually dry and highly perfumed wines.

== History ==

Theories about the origins of Muscat grapes date ancestors of the varieties back to the ancient Egyptians and Persians of early antiquity (–1000 BC) while some ampelographers, such as Pierre Galet, believe that the family of Muscat varieties were propagated during the period of classical antiquity ( to 600 AD) by the Greeks and Romans. However, while domestic wine production had a long history in ancient Egypt and Persia and classical writers such as Columella and Pliny the Elder did describe very &quot;muscat-like&quot; grape varieties such as &quot;Anathelicon Moschaton&quot; and &quot;Apianae&quot; that were very sweet and attractive to bees (Latin &quot;apis&quot;), there is no solid historical evidence that these early wine grapes were members of the Muscat family.

The first documented mention of grapes called &quot;muscat&quot; was in the works of the English Franciscan scholar Bartholomeus Anglicus who wrote of wine made from Muscat grapes in his work &quot;De proprietatibus rerum&quot; written between 1230 and 1240 while Anglicus was studying in what is now modern Saxony in Germany. Anglicus&#x27; Latin work was translated into French in 1372 with the wine being described by Anglicus as &quot;vin extrait de raisins muscats&quot;.

== Origins of the name &quot;Muscat&quot; ==

Because the exact origins of the Muscat family cannot be pinpointed, theories as to the origin of the name &quot;Muscat&quot; are numerous. The most commonly cited is that it is derived from the Persian word &quot;muchk&quot;. Similar etymology follows the Greek &quot;moskos&quot;, Latin &quot;muscus&quot; and French &quot;musc&quot;. In Italy, the Italian word &quot;mosca&quot; for fly could also be one possibility with the sweet aroma and high sugar levels of Muscat grapes attracting insects such as fruit flies.

Other theories suggest that the grape family originated in the West Asian country of Oman and was named after the city of Muscat located on the coast of the Gulf of Oman. Another city that is sometimes suggested as a potential birthplace/namesake is the Greek city of Moschato, located southwest of Athens in Attica, with &quot;Moschato&quot; being a common synonym in Greece for Muscat varieties.

== Closely related varieties ==

Of the more than 200 grape varieties sharing &quot;Muscat&quot; (or one of its synonyms) in their name, the majority are not closely related to each other. The exception are the members of the &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot; and Muscat of Alexandria families. In the early 21st century, DNA analysis showed that Muscat of Alexandria was, itself, a natural crossing of &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot; and a black-skinned table grape variety from the Greek islands known as &quot;Axina de Tres Bias&quot;. Rarely seen outside of Greece, &quot;Axina de Tres Bias&quot; (also known as &quot;Heftakilo&quot;) is also grown in Malta and Sardinia.

&quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot; and Muscat of Alexandria, themselves, have crossed and have produced at least 14 different grape varieties, 5 of which are mostly cultivated in South America and 9 still found in Italy though none are of major use in wine production. More notable and widely planted offspring have come from &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot; and Muscat of Alexandria crossing with other grape varieties, such as the Argentine wine grapes of &quot;Cereza&quot;, &quot;Torrontés Riojano&quot; and &quot;Torrontés Sanjuanino&quot;, stemming from a cross of Muscat of Alexandria with &quot;Listán negro&quot; (also known as the &quot;Mission grape&quot;)

Muscat of Alexandria has also been crossed with the German / Italian wine grape &quot;Trollinger&quot; (also known as &quot;Schiava Grossa&quot;) to produce Muscat of Hamburg and &quot;Malvasia del Lazio&quot;, and with the Italian wine grapes &quot;Catarratto bianco&quot; and &quot;Bombino bianco&quot; to produce the Marsala wine grape &quot;Grillo&quot; and &quot;Moscatello Selvatico&quot;, respectively. &quot;Muscat Ottonel&quot; is the result of a crossing between one Muscat variety, &quot;&quot;Muscat d&#x27;Eisenstadt&quot; (also known as &quot;Muscat de Saumur&quot;&quot;), with the Swiss wine grape &quot;Chasselas&quot;

&quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot; has been identified as one of the parent grapes of several varieties, though with which crossing partner is currently unknown. These include the Italian wine grapes &quot;Aleatico&quot;, &quot;Moscato Giallo&quot; (Yellow Moscato), &quot;Moscato rosa del Trentino&quot; (Pink Moscato of Trentino) and &quot;Moscato di Scanzo&quot;. DNA analysis was able to identify the Tuscan wine grape &quot;Mammolo&quot; as the second parent variety that crossed with &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot; to produce &quot;Muscat rouge de Madère&quot; (Red Muscat of Madère).

== Characteristic aromas and confusion with other grapes ==

Despite the vast diversity in the Muscat family, one common trait that can be seen in most all Muscat members is the characteristic floral, &quot;grapey&quot; aroma note that is caused by the high concentration of monoterpenes in the grapes. More than 40 different monoterpenes have been discovered in Muscat grapes (as well as in other aromatic varieties like Riesling and Gewürztraminer); these include citronellol, geraniol, linalool and nerol. This characteristic &quot;musk&quot; aroma can be best observed in light bodied, low alcohol wines such as Moscato Asti which have not had their bouquet heavily influenced by other winemaking techniques like oak aging, autolysis with yeast, malolactic fermentation or fortification.

However, this common &quot;musky&quot; (French: &quot;musqué&quot;) trait has caused some confusion as varieties that are wholly unrelated to the Muscat family are often erroneously associated with Muscat grapes (often by naming and synonyms) due to their aromatic character. These include the German wine grape Morio Muskat which, despite its name, is not related to the Muscat family and is, instead, a crossing of Silvaner x Pinot blanc. Likewise, the highly aromatic clonal mutation of several wine grape varieties such as Sauvignon blanc, Chasselas and Chardonnay are often suffixed with &quot;Musqué&quot; which can add confusion to their relationship with the Muscat family. Additionally, the Bordeaux wine grape Muscadelle that is used for both sweet and dry wines is often mistaken for a Muscat variety due to its aromatic qualities. While made from a more aromatically neutral grape, Melon de Bourgogne grape, the Loire wine Muscadet is sometimes mistakenly believed to be made from a member of the Muscat family.

Lastly, the Muscat grape can be confused (in name only; the grapes themselves are quite different) with Vitis rotundifolia, which is commonly known as a &quot;muscadine&quot; grape.

== Key varieties ==
The &quot;Muscat family&quot; is highly populous, with more than 200 distinct members. However, among these many different grapes only a handful of Muscat varieties are widely used in wine production. These include &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot;, Muscat of Alexandria, Muscat of Hamburg and &quot;Muscat Ottonel&quot;.

=== &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot; ===

&quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot; is known by many names worldwide, including &quot;Muscat Blanc&quot; (white Muscat) in France and the United States), &quot;Muscat Canelli&quot; in the United States, &quot;Moscato Bianco&quot; (white Moscato) in Italy, &quot;Muscat Frontignan&quot; in South Africa, &quot;Moschato&quot; in Greece, &quot;Brown Muscat&quot; in Australia, &quot;Muskateller&quot; in Germany and Austria, &quot;Muscat de Grano Menudo&quot; in Spain, and &quot;Muscat de Frontignan&quot; and &quot;Muscat Lunel&quot; in France. While the &quot;petits grains&quot; in the grape&#x27;s name accurately describes the small, round berries of the vine, some wine experts, such as Oz Clarke, believe that the term &quot;Muscat blanc&quot;&quot; is misleading, since the grapevine is notorious for its frequent color mutations siring clusters of berries in nearly every shade possible though most commonly the grape berries are a deep yellow after veraison. In some vineyards, vines of &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot; are known to produce clusters of berries of different colors that change every vintage.

The precise origins of &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot; are not known, though Greece and Italy can both make compelling cases due to the proliferation of clones, mutations and offspring. Today, the grape is found throughout the wine-producing world, making a wide range of wine, from light, sweet sparkling and semi-sparkling &quot;Asti&quot; and &quot;Moscato d&#x27;Asti&quot; wine in the Piedmont wine region of Italy and Clairette de Die region of France, fortified &quot;vin doux naturels&quot; (VdN) in southern France in AOC regions such as &quot;Muscat de Beaume de Venise&quot;, &quot;Muscat de Saint-Jean de Minervois&quot; and &quot;Muscat de Frontignan&quot;, fortified &quot;Liqueur Muscat&quot; in the Rutherglen wine region in Australia, to dry wines in the &quot;Wachau wine&quot; of Austria and Südsteiermark.

Nearly all the most notable sweet Muscats of Greece, particularly those from the island of Samos and the city of Patras on the Peloponnese are made from &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot;. In the history of South African wine, the famous dessert wine of Constantia was made from this variety of Muscat and while today Muscat of Alexandria is more widely planted in South Africa, producers around Constantia are trying to reclaim some of the region&#x27;s viticultural acclaim by replanting more &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot; and making wines in the style of the original Constantia.

=== Muscat of Alexandria ===

While the grape&#x27;s name harkens to the city of Alexandria and suggest an ancient Egyptian origin, DNA analysis has shown that Muscat of Alexandria is the result of a natural crossing between &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot; and the Greek wine grape &quot;Axina de Tres Bias&quot;. Though as &quot;Axina de Tres Bias&quot; has also been historically grown in Sardinia and Malta, the precise location and origins of Muscat of Alexandria cannot be determined. Compared to &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot;, Muscat of Alexandria tends to produce large, moderately loose clusters of large oval-shaped berries that are distinctive from the much smaller, round berries of &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot;.

Like most Muscat varieties, Muscat of Alexandria is notable for being a desirable raisin and table grape. This is due in part to the grape&#x27;s high tolerance of heat and drought conditions. While it is used in wine production (most notably on the island of Pantelleria between Sicily and Tunisia, where it makes a &quot;passito&quot; style dessert wine under the name of &quot;Zibibbo&quot;), the grape lags far behind the reputation of &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot;. This is partly because Muscat of Alexandria is very vigorous and prone to produce high yields that can be easily overcropped as well as a more assertive aroma profile due to a higher concentration of the monoterpene geraniol, which produces a geranium scent, and lower concentration of nerol with 
a more fresh, sweet rose aroma.

In France, Muscat of Alexandria is most prominent as a blending component (with &quot;Muscat blanc à Petits Grains&quot;) in the VdN wines of Muscat de Rivesaltes AOC in the Roussillon wine region. The grape is the primary Muscat variety in Spain, where it is known as &quot;Moscatel&quot;, though the majority of the country&#x27;s plantings are used for table grapes and raisins, rather than for wine production. Likewise, in Chile, and Peru most of the Moscatel in both countries is used to produce the distilled drink &quot;pisco&quot;.

In South Africa, Muscat of Alexandria is known as &quot;Hanepoot&quot; and was the fourth-most widely planted white wine grape variety in the country until the early 2000s. While some of the plantings were used for wine production, particularly for fortified wine, many plantings were used for the production of grape concentrate and raisins. In California, there is still more plantings of Muscat of Alexandria than any other Muscat variety, with most of these grapes going into anonymous jug wines from the Central Valley. As in many other places in the world, the grape had a long history of use in the United States as a raisin variety, though in the 1920s, plantings of Muscat of Alexandria began to decline as producers turned to more popular seedless grape varieties.

=== Muscat of Hamburg ===

Even though the vast majority of the members of the Muscat family are dark skinned grapes, most of the major varieties used in wine production are white or &quot;pale skinned&quot;, with the one significant exception of Muscat of Hamburg, which is also known as &quot;Black Muscat&quot;. This dark-skinned grape is believed to have originated in the Victorian greenhouses of England, where it was first described in 1858 as being propagated by Seward Snow, gardener to the Earl de Grey. Snow described the grape as a seedling that he created from crossing the Black Hamburg grape (an old synonym of &quot;Schiava Grossa&quot;) with the White Muscat of Alexandria. In 2003, DNA analysis confirmed that Muscat of Hamburg was, indeed, a crossing of Muscat of Alexandria and Schiava Grossa, which makes the grape a full sibling to the central Italian grape &quot;Malvasia del Lazio&quot; which has the same parentage.

While Muscat of Hamburg is used mostly as a table grape throughout the world, there are two notable exceptions. The first is in California, where nearly all of the of Black Muscat in cultivation in 2009 were destined for wine production, primarily to produce dessert wines. The other exception is in China, where Muscat of Hamburg is often crossed with &quot;Vitis amurensis&quot; species that are native to the region to produce wine grapes that are better adapted to the climate of various Chinese wine regions.

=== &quot;Muscat Ottonel&quot; ===

Like Muscat of Hamburg, &quot;Muscat Ottonel&quot; is a relatively recent addition to the Muscat family, being bred in the Loire Valley wine region of France in the 1850s. The grape is a cross of the Swiss wine grape &quot;Chasselas&quot; and &quot;Muscat d&#x27;Eisenstadt&quot; (also known as &quot;Muscat de Saumur&quot;). Of all of the major Muscat varieties, &quot;Muscat Ottonel&quot; has the most pale skin color, and tends to produce the most neutral wines and is also the grape variety that ripens the earliest.

While varieties such as Muscat of Alexandria tend to thrive in very warm Mediterranean climates, Muscat of Ottonel has shown an affinity for ripening in cooler continental climates, and has found a home in many Central European nations, such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Romania and many former republic of the Soviet Union, such as Russia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Ukraine. It is also the primary Muscat variety grown in the French region of Alsace, where it is used to produce both dry and off-dry styles. In Austria, it is also the most widely planted Muscat variety, where it is used to produce late-harvest wines around Lake Neusiedl.

== Synonyms ==

While each individual Muscat variety has its own set of synonyms, the general prefix of &quot;Muscat&quot; has its own unique translation around the globe. In Greece, the grapes are usually known as &quot;&quot;Moschato&quot; or &quot;Moschoudia&quot;, while in Italy, they are known as &quot;Moscato&quot; or &quot;Moscatello&quot;. On the Iberian peninsula, Portuguese and Spanish Muscat grapes are often prefixed as &quot;Moscatel&quot;, while in Germany, the grapes are usually known as &quot;Muskat&quot; or &quot;Muskateller&quot;. The family of Muscat varieties are known as &quot;Misket&quot; in Bulgaria and Turkey, &quot;Muškat&quot; in Croatia and &quot;Muskotály&quot; in Hungary. In the northern African wine regions of Tunisia, the grapes are often known as &quot;Meski&quot;&quot;.

<text>The Convair X-6 was a proposed experimental aircraft project to develop and evaluate a nuclear-powered jet aircraft. The project was to use a Convair B-36 bomber as a testbed aircraft, and though one NB-36H was modified during the early stages of the project, the program was canceled before the actual X-6 and its nuclear reactor engines were completed. The X-6 was part of a larger series of programs, costing US$7 billion in all, that ran from 1946 through 1961. Because such an aircraft&#x27;s range would not have been limited by liquid jet fuel, it was theorized that nuclear-powered strategic bombers would be able to stay airborne for weeks at a time.

==Development and design==
In May 1946, the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project was started by the United States Army Air Forces. Studies under this program were done until May 1951 when NEPA was replaced by the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) program. The ANP program included plans for Convair to modify two B-36s under the MX-1589 project. One of the B-36s was used to study shielding requirements for an airborne reactor, while the other became the X-6.

===Nuclear Test Aircraft===

The first modified B-36 was called the Nuclear Test Aircraft (NTA), a B-36H-20-CF (Serial Number 51-5712) that had been damaged in a tornado at Carswell AFB on September 1, 1952. This plane was redesignated the XB-36H, then the NB-36H and was modified to carry a 1 megawatt, air-cooled nuclear reactor in its bomb bay. The reactor, named the Aircraft Shield Test Reactor (ASTR), was operational but did not power the plane. Water, acting as both moderator and coolant, was pumped through the reactor core and then to water-to-air heat exchangers to dissipate the heat to the atmosphere. Its sole purpose was to investigate the effect of radiation on aircraft systems.

To shield the flight crew, the nose section of the aircraft was modified to include a 12-ton lead and rubber shield. The standard windshield was replaced with one made of acrylic glass. The amount of lead and water shielding was variable. Measurements of the resulting radiation levels were then compared with calculated levels to enhance the ability to design optimal shielding with minimum weight for nuclear-powered bombers.

The NTA completed 47 test flights and 215 hours of flight time (during 89 of which the reactor was operated) between September 17, 1955, and March 1957 over New Mexico and Texas. This was the only known airborne reactor experiment by the U.S. with an operational nuclear reactor on board. The NB-36H was scrapped at Fort Worth in 1958 when the Nuclear Aircraft Program was abandoned. Based on the results of the NTA, the X-6 and the entire nuclear aircraft program was abandoned in 1961.

===Development plans===

Had the program progressed, follow-on aircraft would have been based on the successor to the B-36, Convair&#x27;s swept-wing B-60.

The X-6 would have been powered by General Electric X-39 engines (J47 engines modified to use nuclear energy as fuel), utilizing a P-1 reactor. In a nuclear jet engine, the reactor core was used as a heat source for the turbine&#x27;s air flow, instead of burning jet fuel. One disadvantage of the design was that, since the airflow through the engine was used to cool the reactor, this airflow had to be maintained even after the aircraft had landed and parked. GE built two prototype engines, which can be seen outside the Experimental Breeder Reactor I in Arco, Idaho.

A large, wide hangar was built at Test Area North, part of the National Reactor Testing Station (now part of the Idaho National Laboratory; Monteview) to house the X-6 project, but the project was canceled before the planned runway was built, necessitated by the expected weight of the nuclear-powered aircraft.

===Soviet program===
In the 1960s, the Soviet Union&#x27;s Tupolev design bureau had its own design for an experimental nuclear-powered aircraft, the Tu-119, which was to be a Tu-95 bomber with two of its conventional turboprops replaced by nuclear-powered turboprops. It was never built. Tupolev did build a nuclear reactor carrying counterpart to the NB-36H, the Tupolev Tu-95LAL.

<doc id="890880" wikidata="Q1227457" url="?curid=890880" title="Direct Internet Message Encapsulation">
<text>Direct Internet Message Encapsulation (DIME) was a Microsoft-proposed internet standard in the early 2000s for the streaming of binary and other encapsulated data over the Internet.

According to the IETF website, the standard has been withdrawn and never made RFC status. However, Microsoft did at one time recommend DIME for transmitting files via Web services. It was also used in Java EE, but differences in the implementation of the protocol made it difficult.

The first version was submitted to the IETF in November 2001; the last update was submitted in June 2002. By December 2003, DIME had lost out, in competition with Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism and SOAP with Attachments. Microsoft now describes DIME as &quot;superseded by the SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) specification&quot;

The standard was intended to be an improved version of MIME. In particular a difficulty with MIME is that each message must be encoded as text and that its sections are separated by a separator given in the message header. This means the entire stream of data must be known to the sender before starting the communication, so as to choose a separator that does not occur in the data. This is not useful if the entire stream is not available when the communication is initiated, or when searching it is expensive. DIME is more oriented to streaming, allowing, for example, a receiver to process chunks of the message as they arrive without having to wait for the entire message.

==Criticisms==
Issues with HTTP

DIME was defined as the transmission format at the data link layer in the OSI model although it was typically transmitted over HTTP. One difficulty here was that it could form an HTTP message of essentially any size (the limit being the size information for each chunk, which was 32 bits so 1 gigabit). Many HTTP receivers were not used to messages as large as this, and if they buffered messages would simply fail, due to the fact that the software expected a short message, but instead received a long one. Moreover, if the HTTP receiver was secured, it would, send back a challenge message (400 code) to the sender upon receiving the message. Because HTTP is connectionless, it would then entirely lose the possibly huge amount of data that had been sent to it, just to accept or deny the challenge. The response to the challenge could of course succeed, at the expense of sending the data twice, which if it were huge rather defeats its point.

In the alternate solution, the criteria for a successful challenge (e.g. a username and password) is established out-of-band, so it can be sent with the message the first time and not receive a challenge (the by-product of the connectionless HTTP protocol being that since each message is treated individual, &quot;any&quot; message must be able successfully to include its challenge response).

DIME was extremely fast compared to practical applications of other protocols. Because the data was binary rather than, say, Base64 encoded, it was relatively compact, and the chunking and packet methods built into the protocol meant it could be streamed and read by a suitable receiver before the whole message had been read.

Issues at the Network Layer

Because DIME was defined at the data link layer, it was possible to encapsulate a DIME message in another DIME message. This would not help at all for compression purposes but was occasionally useful to bypass networking infrastructure such as routers at the network layer of the OS model, which would otherwise block the encapsulated traffic (being binary they may treat it with suspicion). That being said, other protocols such as MIME may equally suffer such. Since DIME was generally used between well-trusted clients, a specific port could be opened at the router for the express purpose of sending and receiving DIME traffic. This did not subvert the security aspects, since the challenge would still occur, merely that it accepted that binary traffic was the norm on that port, and did not give numerous false positives.

<doc id="890885" wikidata="Q3195241" url="?curid=890885" title="Kenny Wallace">
<text>Kenneth Lee Wallace (born August 23, 1963) is an American race car driver and former reporter for &quot;Fox NASCAR&quot;. He retired from NASCAR in 2015 after driving in the national series since 1988. In a career spanning 25 years in NASCAR, Wallace had nine wins, all occurring in the NASCAR Xfinity Series. Now retired from NASCAR competition, he continues to race on local dirt tracks across the country as a hobby.

==Early life==
Wallace is the youngest of three brothers born to Russ and Judy Wallace. Russ was a prolific race winner himself, which made him unpopular with fans. Wallace earned his nickname, &quot;Herman,&quot; early in life when Lake Hill Speedway promoter Bob Mueller made note of Wallace&#x27;s boisterous behavior when taking up for his father, likening him to the mischievous cartoon character Herman the German. He went to Fox High School in Arnold, Missouri.

Wallace began his racing career by working as a mechanic on his father&#x27;s race cars and brother&#x27;s team. He entered his first race, the Illinois Street Stock State Championship, in 1982, winning the event. In 1984, Wallace worked as a mechanic for Benfield Racing and Joe Ruttman, eventually being promoted to crew chief after Jake Elder left the team. He entered the American Speed Association in 1986, achieving Rookie of the Year honors in the series.

==Motorsports career==
===Early Busch career===
In September 1988, Dale Earnhardt gave Wallace the seat for his first-ever NASCAR start, in which he finished eleventh in the Busch Series race at Martinsville Speedway, driving the No. 8 GM Goodwrench Chevrolet. The following year, he raced the full Busch Series schedule in a car owned by brother Rusty Wallace, sponsored by Cox Treated Lumber earning the 1989 Rookie of the Year award and finishing sixth in driver point standings. In 1990, he made his Winston Cup debut at North Wilkesboro Speedway in the No. 36 Pontiac for Randy Cox, finishing 26th after a late-race crash, setting up the controversial finish, which saw Brett Bodine win. He finished seventh in the Busch Series. The following season, he won his first two career races at Volusia County and New Hampshire, and finished a career-best second in the Busch points. He also subbed for Kyle Petty in two races in the Cup series at Charlotte and Dover. At the Pyroil 500, he competed against his brothers Mike and Rusty, marking the first time since Bob, Fonty, and Tim Flock raced that three brothers competed in the same race. In 1992, Dirt Devil became his sponsor and he won his third career Busch race at Martinsville, but several mechanical problems dropped him down to sixth in points.

===1993–2000===

In 1993, Wallace moved up to the Winston Cup Series full-time, driving the No. 40 Dirt Devil-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix for SABCO Racing. The team got a considerable amount of television time as the team was featured on the TV show &quot;What Would You Do?&quot;. He had three Top 10&#x27;s and finished 23rd in points, but lost his ride at the end of the season. He returned to the Busch Series to drive the No. 8 TIC Financial Systems-sponsored Ford for FILMAR Racing. He earned up three wins and finished fourth in points. Towards the end of the season, he was hired by Robert Yates Racing to replace an injured Ernie Irvan in the Cup series. In 12 races, he finished in the Top 10 three times. In 1995, Wallace and FILMAR split time between the Cup and Busch Series. Wallace had one win with the Red Dog Ford in the Busch Series at Richmond, and made eleven starts in the Cup Series in the No. 81 car.

Wallace and FILMAR began racing in Cup full-time 1996 with funding from Square D. They had two top-ten finishes and finished 28th in points. The following season, he won two poles, at Bristol and Martinsville respectively, but fell five spots in the standings. Despite seven Top 10&#x27;s in 1998, Wallace and Square D left FILMAR to drive Andy Petree Racing&#x27;s new No. 55 entry. Wallace finished in the top-ten five times and had a career-best twenty-second-place finish in points. After only one Top 10 in 2000 and a 26th-place finish in the points, he departed the team. The sole Top 10 came in his second-place finish to Dale Earnhardt in the 2000 Winston 500, which was Earnhardt&#x27;s 76th and final victory. Wallace pushed Earnhardt to the front in four laps to the lead.

===2001–2015===
In 2001, Wallace signed with the unsponsored Eel River Racing team, and also was hired to drive the No. 48 Goulds Pumps-sponsored Chevy in the Busch Series full-time for Innovative Motorsports. After several DNQ&#x27;s, Wallace resigned from the team to concentrate on his Busch ride. He won his first race in seven years at North Carolina Speedway and finished tenth in points. He also filled in for Steve Park in the Cup Series, winning one pole and nailing down two top tens, including a second-place finish at Rockingham Speedway, tying a career best. He did not win in 2002, but moved up to seventh in the Busch series standings in the No. 48 Chevrolet now sponsored by Stacker 2. He replaced Kevin Harvick in Richard Childress Racing&#x27;s No. 29 car at Martinsville after the latter was suspended for deliberately wrecking another driver in the Truck Series race the day before. He was hired late in the season by Bill Davis Racing to replace Hut Stricklin in the No. 23 Hills Brothers Coffee-sponsored Dodge, and was hired to drive the car full-time in 2003, bringing his Stacker 2 sponsorship with him while also driving a single race in the Busch Series for Michael Waltrip at Gateway, his hometown track in St. Louis. After one top ten finish, Wallace and the team moved down to the Busch Series in 2004, garnering ten top tens. He also drove in the Cup Series five times for Michael Waltrip Racing.

In 2005, Davis Racing closed its Busch team, allowing Wallace and sponsor Stacker 2 to join ppc Racing&#x27;s No. 22 Ford, earning five Top fives and eleven top tens. During that season Wallace&#x27;s team lost sponsorship when Stacker 2 backed out of NASCAR, and drove for the rest of his time with ppc Racing driving the No. 22 AutoZone-sponsored Ford. He began driving for Furniture Row Racing in the Cup Series that season, and ran seventeen races with them in 2006. After four top tens in 2006, Furniture Row began racing full-time in Cup, so Wallace left ppc.

Despite getting voted into the All-Star Race at Charlotte, Wallace was unable to keep the No. 78 in the top 35 in owner&#x27;s points, and left the team in August. On August 22, 2007, he filled in for Kyle Petty in the No. 45 Wells Fargo-sponsored Dodge at Bristol. Shortly after that drove as a sub for an injured Ricky Rudd in the No. 88 Snickers-sponsored Ford Fusion until Rudd returned.

Wallace attempted to qualify for the 2008 Daytona 500 in a second car for Furniture Row Racing—the No. 87 Denver Mattress-sponsored Chevrolet. This car was entered as a safety net for the team&#x27;s primary driver Joe Nemechek in the 78, should his car not make the race. Nemechek locked the 78 in on pole day, giving Wallace the opportunity to race. Wallace finished eighth in the first Duel at Daytona, making the 50th Daytona 500. Wallace was black flagged in the 500 for failure to maintain the NASCAR-required speed, allowing him to finished dead-last. Wallace drove for Armando Fitz early in the 2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series season before switching to the No. 28 for Jay Robinson. Between the 2008, 2009, and 2010 seasons, Wallace finished in the top ten three times. He left Jay Robinson and joined RAB Racing, driving without a paycheck in exchange for getting to drive competitive equipment. Wallace recorded eleven top ten finishes in 2011, with a best finish of fifth at Richmond. In October, he announced that he would return to the team in 2012. However, Wallace only ran the first five races before sponsorship issues forced him to move to a partial schedule. In addition to driving both RAB&#x27;s Nos. 09 and 99, Wallace also drove at Indianapolis with Benny Gordon&#x27;s SR2 Motorsports team and finished 19th.

In January 2012, RAB Racing announced that Wallace would be attempting to qualify for the 2012 Daytona 500, driving the American Ethanol-sponsored No. 09 Toyota Camry. The team suffered fuel pump issues in the Gatorade Duel and failed to qualify for the race.

In July 2012, Wallace was guaranteed a ride for one race in the No. 22 Penske Racing Nationwide car, but Sam Hornish Jr. was given the ride.

In 2013, Wallace ran the inaugural Mudsummer Classic at Eldora Speedway and after winning the fourth heat race, he finished seventeenth after starting fourth in the event. He also ran at Chicagoland Speedway in the Truck Series, as well as running a limited schedule in the Nationwide Series for RAB Racing; at the Chicagoland Nationwide race, he made his 900th start in NASCAR&#x27;s top three divisions. In late September, he qualified Brian Vickers&#x27; Sprint Cup Series car at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, due to a scheduling conflict; Vickers drove in the race and finished 7th.

In early 2015, Wallace competed in the Chili Bowl Midget Nationals for Loyet Motorsports. Also in 2015, Kenny&#x27;s brother, Mike Wallace, had open heart surgery. Kenny was announced as his replacement in the Winn-Dixie 300 at Talladega, driving the No. 26 Xfinity Series Toyota for JGL Racing. Wallace was involved in a late-race accident and finished 38th. He joined RAB Racing for the Iowa race in June with the sponsorship from U.S. Cellular, finishing a respectable 23rd after starting from the rear of the field. He also announced that he would run his final NASCAR race at Iowa with Joe Gibbs Racing in August. He finished fifteenth in his final NASCAR start.

===2016–present===

Though his NASCAR driving career came to an end, he continues to race on dirt tracks in his UMPDirtCar modified. In August, he ran the Stadium Super Trucks race at the Charlotte Dirt Track, driving the No. 36 Safecraft Safety Equipment truck. He finished eighth in the event.

==Personal life==
Wallace is a member of a large racing family. Wallace&#x27;s father, Russ, was a prolific winner on Midwestern short tracks in the 1960s and 1970s. Kenny and his older brothers, Rusty Wallace and Mike Wallace, followed in their father&#x27;s footsteps. Rusty is the 1989 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion and winner of 55 Cup Series races. Mike is a winner of four Nationwide Series and five Camping World Truck Series races. Rusty&#x27;s son, Steve Wallace, is a former Nationwide Series driver, and Mike&#x27;s daughter, Chrissy Wallace, has participated in multiple Nationwide Series and Camping World Truck Series races.

Living outside of St. Louis, Missouri, Wallace is married to Kim and has three daughters, Brooke, Brandy, and Brittany. He became a grandfather on May 19, 2016

During his early Cup days, Wallace had a go-kart track in his backyard that hosted races for other Cup drivers. The track was eventually razed when Wallace didn&#x27;t have insurance to cover injuries sustained at the track.

<text>In computer science, array programming refers to solutions that allow the application of operations to an entire set of values at once. Such solutions are commonly used in scientific and engineering settings. 

Modern programming languages that support array programming (also known as vector or multidimensional languages) have been engineered specifically to generalize operations on scalars to apply transparently to vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional arrays. These include APL, J, Fortran, MATLAB, Analytica, Octave, R, Cilk Plus, Julia, Perl Data Language (PDL), Raku (programming language). In these languages, an operation that operates on entire arrays can be called a &quot;vectorized&quot; operation, regardless of whether it is executed on a vector processor, which implements vector instructions. Array programming primitives concisely express broad ideas about data manipulation. The level of concision can be dramatic in certain cases: it is not uncommon to find array programming language one-liners that require several pages of object-oriented code.

==Concepts of array==
The fundamental idea behind array programming is that operations apply at once to an entire set of values. This makes it a high-level programming model as it allows the programmer to think and operate on whole aggregates of data, without having to resort to explicit loops of individual scalar operations.

Kenneth E. Iverson described the rationale behind array programming (actually referring to APL) as follows:
The basis behind array programming and thinking is to find and exploit the properties of data where individual elements are similar or adjacent. Unlike object orientation which implicitly breaks down data to its constituent parts (or scalar quantities), array orientation looks to group data and apply a uniform handling.

Function rank is an important concept to array programming languages in general, by analogy to tensor rank in mathematics: functions that operate on data may be classified by the number of dimensions they act on. Ordinary multiplication, for example, is a scalar ranked function because it operates on zero-dimensional data (individual numbers). The cross product operation is an example of a vector rank function because it operates on vectors, not scalars. Matrix multiplication is an example of a 2-rank function, because it operates on 2-dimensional objects (matrices). Collapse operators reduce the dimensionality of an input data array by one or more dimensions. For example, summing over elements collapses the input array by 1 dimension.

==Uses==
Array programming is very well suited to implicit parallelization; a topic of much research nowadays. Further, Intel and compatible CPUs developed and produced after 1997 contained various instruction set extensions, starting from MMX and continuing through SSSE3 and 3DNow!, which include rudimentary SIMD array capabilities. This has continued into the 2020s with instruction sets such as AVX-512, making modern CPUs sophisticated vector processors. Array processing is distinct from parallel processing in that one physical processor performs operations on a group of items simultaneously while parallel processing aims to split a larger problem into smaller ones (MIMD) to be solved piecemeal by numerous processors. Processors with multiple cores and GPUs with thousands of general computing cores are common as of 2023.

==Languages==
The canonical examples of array programming languages are Fortran, APL, and J. Others include: A+, Analytica, Chapel, IDL, Julia, K, Klong, Q, MATLAB, GNU Octave, Scilab, FreeMat, Perl Data Language (PDL), R, Raku, S-Lang, SAC, Nial, ZPL, Futhark, and TI-BASIC.

===Scalar languages===
In scalar languages such as C and Pascal, operations apply only to single values, so &quot;a&quot;+&quot;b&quot; expresses the addition of two numbers. In such languages, adding one array to another requires indexing and looping, the coding of which is tedious.

for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
 for (j = 0; j &lt; n; j++)
 a[i][j] += b[i][j];
In array-based languages, for example in Fortran, the nested for-loop above can be written in array-format in one line,

a = a + b

or alternatively, to emphasize the array nature of the objects,

a(:,:) = a(:,:) + b(:,:)
While scalar languages like C do not have native array programming elements as part of the language proper, this does not mean programs written in these languages never take advantage of the underlying techniques of vectorization (i.e., utilizing a CPU&#x27;s vector-based instructions if it has them or by using multiple CPU cores). Some C compilers like GCC at some optimization levels detect and vectorize sections of code that its heuristics determine would benefit from it. Another approach is given by the OpenMP API, which allows one to parallelize applicable sections of code by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores.

===Array languages===
In array languages, operations are generalized to apply to both scalars and arrays. Thus, &quot;a&quot;+&quot;b&quot; expresses the sum of two scalars if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are scalars, or the sum of two arrays if they are arrays.

An array language simplifies programming but possibly at a cost known as the &quot;abstraction penalty&quot;. Because the additions are performed in isolation from the rest of the coding, they may not produce the optimally most efficient code. (For example, additions of other elements of the same array may be subsequently encountered during the same execution, causing unnecessary repeated lookups.) Even the most sophisticated optimizing compiler would have an extremely hard time amalgamating two or more apparently disparate functions which might appear in different program sections or sub-routines, even though a programmer could do this easily, aggregating sums on the same pass over the array to minimize overhead).

====Ada====
The previous C code would become the following in the Ada language, which supports array-programming syntax.

A := A + B;
====APL====
APL uses single character Unicode symbols with no syntactic sugar.

A ← A + B

This operation works on arrays of any rank (including rank 0), and on a scalar and an array. Dyalog APL extends the original language with augmented assignments:

A +← B
====Analytica====
Analytica provides the same economy of expression as Ada.
====BASIC====
Dartmouth BASIC had MAT statements for matrix and array manipulation in its third edition (1966).

DIM A(4),B(4),C(4)
MAT A = 1
MAT B = 2 * A
MAT C = A + B
MAT PRINT A,B,C
====Mata====
Stata&#x27;s matrix programming language Mata supports array programming. Below, we illustrate addition, multiplication, addition of a matrix and a scalar, element by element multiplication, subscripting, and one of Mata&#x27;s many inverse matrix functions.

. mata:

: A = (1,2,3) \(4,5,6)

: A
 1 2 3
 1 | 1 2 3 |
 2 | 4 5 6 |

: B = (2..4) \(1..3)

: B
 1 2 3
 1 | 2 3 4 |
 2 | 1 2 3 |

: C = J(3,2,1) // A 3 by 2 matrix of ones

: C
 1 2
 1 | 1 1 |
 2 | 1 1 |
 3 | 1 1 |

: D = A + B

: D
 1 2 3
 1 | 3 5 7 |
 2 | 5 7 9 |

: E = A*C

: E
 1 2
 1 | 6 6 |
 2 | 15 15 |

: F = A:*B

: F
 1 2 3
 1 | 2 6 12 |
 2 | 4 10 18 |

: G = E :+ 3

: G
 1 2
 1 | 9 9 |
 2 | 18 18 |

: H = F[(2\1), (1, 2)] // Subscripting to get a submatrix of F and

: // switch row 1 and 2
: H
 1 2
 1 | 4 10 |
 2 | 2 6 |

: I = invsym(F&#x27;*F) // Generalized inverse (F*F^(-1)F=F) of a

: // symmetric positive semi-definite matrix
: I
[symmetric]
 1 2 3
 1 | 0 |
 2 | 0 3.25 |
 3 | 0 -1.75 .9444444444 |

: end
====MATLAB====
The implementation in MATLAB allows the same economy allowed by using the Fortran language.

A = A + B;
A variant of the MATLAB language is the GNU Octave language, which extends the original language with augmented assignments:

A += B;
Both MATLAB and GNU Octave natively support linear algebra operations such as matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, and the numerical solution of system of linear equations, even using the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse.

The Nial example of the inner product of two arrays can be implemented using the native matrix multiplication operator. If codice_1 is a row vector of size [1 n] and codice_2 is a corresponding column vector of size [n 1].

 a * b;

By contrast, the entrywise product is implemented as:

 a .* b;

The inner product between two matrices having the same number of elements can be implemented with the auxiliary operator codice_3, which reshapes a given matrix into a column vector, and the transpose operator codice_4:

 A(:)&#x27; * B(:);

====rasql====
The rasdaman query language is a database-oriented array-programming language. For example, two arrays could be added with the following query:

SELECT A + B
FROM A, B
====R====
The R language supports array paradigm by default. The following example illustrates a process of multiplication of two matrices followed by an addition of a scalar (which is, in fact, a one-element vector) and a vector:

&gt; A &lt;- matrix(1:6, nrow=2) # !!this has nrow=2 ... and A has 2 rows
&gt; A
 [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] 1 3 5
[2,] 2 4 6
&gt; B &lt;- t( matrix(6:1, nrow=2) ) # t() is a transpose operator !!this has nrow=2 ... and B has 3 rows --- a clear contradiction to the definition of A
&gt; B
 [,1] [,2]
[1,] 6 5
[2,] 4 3
[3,] 2 1
&gt; C &lt;- A %*% B
&gt; C
 [,1] [,2]
[1,] 28 19
[2,] 40 28
&gt; D &lt;- C + 1
&gt; D
 [,1] [,2]
[1,] 29 20
[2,] 41 29
&gt; D + c(1, 1) # c() creates a vector
 [,1] [,2]
[1,] 30 21
[2,] 42 30
====Raku====
Raku supports the array paradigm via its Metaoperators. The following example demonstrates the addition of arrays @a and @b using the Hyper-operator in conjunction with the plus operator. 
[0] &gt; my @a = 1,1],[2,2],[3,3;
1 1] [2 2] [3 3

[1] &gt; my @b = 4,4],[5,5],[6,6;
4 4] [5 5] [6 6

[2] &gt; @a »+« @b;
5 5] [7 7] [9 9
==Mathematical reasoning and language notation==
The matrix left-division operator concisely expresses some semantic properties of matrices. As in the scalar equivalent, if the (determinant of the) coefficient (matrix) codice_5 is not null then it is possible to solve the (vectorial) equation codice_6 by left-multiplying both sides by the inverse of codice_5: codice_8 (in both MATLAB and GNU Octave languages: codice_9). The following mathematical statements hold when codice_5 is a full rank square matrix:
:codice_11
:codice_12       (matrix-multiplication associativity)
:codice_13
where codice_14 is the equivalence relational operator.
The previous statements are also valid MATLAB expressions if the third one is executed before the others (numerical comparisons may be false because of round-off errors).

If the system is overdetermined – so that codice_5 has more rows than columns – the pseudoinverse codice_16 (in MATLAB and GNU Octave languages: codice_17) can replace the inverse codice_8, as follows:
:       (matrix-multiplication associativity)

However, these solutions are neither the most concise ones (e.g. still remains the need to notationally differentiate overdetermined systems) nor the most computationally efficient. The latter point is easy to understand when considering again the scalar equivalent codice_19, for which the solution codice_20 would require two operations instead of the more efficient codice_21.
The problem is that generally matrix multiplications are not commutative as the extension of the scalar solution to the matrix case would require:
:codice_22
:codice_23       (commutativity does not hold for matrices!)
:codice_24       (associativity also holds for matrices)
:codice_21

The MATLAB language introduces the left-division operator codice_26 to maintain the essential part of the analogy with the scalar case, therefore simplifying the mathematical reasoning and preserving the conciseness:
:codice_27
:codice_28       (associativity also holds for matrices, commutativity is no more required)
:codice_29
This is not only an example of terse array programming from the coding point of view but also from the computational efficiency perspective, which in several array programming languages benefits from quite efficient linear algebra libraries such as ATLAS or LAPACK.

Returning to the previous quotation of Iverson, the rationale behind it should now be evident: 

==Third-party libraries==
The use of specialized and efficient libraries to provide more terse abstractions is also common in other programming languages. In C++ several linear algebra libraries exploit the language&#x27;s ability to overload operators. In some cases a very terse abstraction in those languages is explicitly influenced by the array programming paradigm, as the NumPy extension library to Python, Armadillo and Blitz++ libraries do.

<text>Kyle of Lochalsh ( , &quot;strait of the foaming loch&quot;) is a village in the historic county of Ross &amp; Cromarty on the northwest coast of Scotland, located around west-southwest of Inverness. It is located on the Lochalsh peninsula, at the entrance to Loch Alsh, opposite the village of Kyleakin on the Isle of Skye. A ferry used to connect the two villages until it was replaced by the Skye Bridge, about to the west, in 1995.

==Geography==

The village is the transport and shopping centre for the area as well as having a harbour and marina with pontoons for maritime visitors. The Plock offers a local woodland hike and viewpoint over the peninsula. The Plock was formerly home to a golf course. It is owned by the Kyle of Lochalsh Community Trust, who also own the adjacent building which was formerly the toll building for the Skye Bridge. The surrounding scenery and wildlife are regarded as attractions of the village, as is the slow pace of life. Crofting as well as more recent crofting pursuits like salmon farming are some of the activities taking place in Kyle of Lochalsh.

A land-based control centre of the Royal Naval BUTEC submarine range is based in Kyle of Lochalsh.

Kyle of Lochalsh lies almost precisely due north of Land&#x27;s End in Cornwall.

Kyle of Lochalsh is the mainland connecting point of the Skye Bridge, with Kyleakin on the Isle of Skye being at the opposite side of the bridge.

==History==
A public hall in the centre of the village was completed in 1932.

Kyle of Lochalsh was the departure point, on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1918, of the HMY Iolaire&quot;,&quot; which was bringing home soldiers returning from World War I to the Outer Hebrides. It sank close to its destination of Stornoway and the soldiers tragically drowned.

In 1973, the ferry service which operated from Kyle of Lochalsh to Stornoway was discontinued, with services transferred to Ullapool instead.

During the 1990s, residents and workers in the area of Kyle of Lochalsh joined together with residents and workers on the Isle of Skye to form the SKAT (Skye and Kyle Against Tolls) anti-toll group movement, to protest against the Skye bridge tolls, which at the time were the highest in the country (£5 per crossing). The protestors were successful in having tolls abolished on the Skye Bridge.

==Transport==

Kyle of Lochalsh railway station is connected to Inverness by the Kyle of Lochalsh railway line, built in 1897 to improve public transport to the north-west of Scotland. The line ends on the water&#x27;s edge, near where the ferry connection used to run.

Kyle of Lochalsh is a calling point for the Royal Scotsman service.

Scottish Citylink coaches also call at Kyle of Lochalsh, at the bus stop by the old ferry slipway - current routes are the 917 between Inverness and Skye and the 915 and 916 between Glasgow, Fort William and Skye (915 via Glasgow Airport). Both run at least twice a day, depending on the time of year. There are irregular local buses to Broadford and Elgol on Skye, school buses to Plockton and a taxibus service to Glenelg, Highland via Shiel Bridge (this only runs three days a week and in winter needs to be booked). Skye has additional buses in the high summer season, some of which run to Kyle.

The A87 road runs through Kyle to and from the Skye Bridge.

==In popular culture==

* In 1980, the BBC did a series of documentaries, entitled &quot;Great Railway Journeys of the World&quot;. Kyle of Lochalsh appeared in an episode entitled &quot;Confessions of a Trainspotter&quot;, presented by Michael Palin. In the segment, Palin travelled by various trains from London to Kyle of Lochalsh. Upon reaching Kyle of Lochalsh, he purchased a large piece of railway memorabilia—the Kyle of Lochalsh railway platform sign. The ending credits showed Palin taking the oversized sign with him back to London; he then hung it on his garden wall at home.
* Along with nearby village Plockton, the town became the backdrop to the BBC drama series &quot;Hamish Macbeth&quot;.
* Kyle of Lochalsh was visited by the characters in Mark Chadbourn&#x27;s trilogy, &quot;Age of Misrule&quot;.
*It is the birth place of the character Roger Wakefield Mackenzie from the series of books and tv series &quot;Outlander&quot;.

<doc id="890892" wikidata="Q6331613" url="?curid=890892" title="KJR (AM)">
<text>KJR (950 kHz) is an all-sports AM radio station owned by iHeartMedia in Seattle, Washington. KJR is the Puget Sound region&#x27;s home of Fox Sports Radio and Infinity Sports Network, mostly carrying their national programming, while co-owned KJR-FM has local sports talk shows during the day and evening. KJR-AM-FM are the flagship stations for Seattle Kraken hockey. During the Seattle Seahawks season, the stations use the slogan &quot;Home of the 12th Man&quot;. The studios are in Seattle&#x27;s Belltown neighborhood northwest of downtown.

KJR is among the oldest radio stations in the United States, tracing its lineage back to an experimental station in 1920. It is powered at 50,000 watts, the maximum for commercial AM stations. It uses a directional antenna with a three-tower array to protect other stations on 950 AM from interference. The transmitter is on 105th Avenue SW on Vashon Island.

==History==

===7AC/7XC===
KJR&#x27;s first formal broadcasting license was issued on March 9, 1922. However, the station&#x27;s origin dates back to earlier broadcasts conducted by the station&#x27;s first owner, Vincent I. Kraft.

Beginning in 1917, Kraft was the director of the local Y.M.C.A. School of Radio Telegraphy. In early 1920, he and O. A. Dodson organized the Northwest Radio Service Company. Details on Kraft&#x27;s earliest broadcasting efforts are limited. However, in August of that year he began an irregular series of broadcasts originating from his Cowen Park home at 5503 14th Avenue, N.E. His amateur station had the call sign 7AC. Later that year Kraft was issued a license for an Experimental station, with the call sign 7XC. In early September 1921 he began transmitting programs on a regular schedule, three evenings a week from 7:45-8:30 p.m.

In early February 1922, Kraft built a radio transmitter used by a temporary station, KDP, to broadcast a week-long series of programs from Saint James&#x27; Cathedral. Following these broadcasts he began using the KDP transmitter at 7XC. On February 28, 1922, he resigned his Y.M.C.A. post in order to assume active management of Northwest Radio.

===KJR===

Initially there were no specific standards for stations making broadcasts intended for the general public, and radio stations holding a variety of license classes, most commonly Experimental and Amateur, began adopting regular broadcasting schedules. On December 1, 1921, the U.S. Department of Commerce, which regulated radio at this time, adopted a regulation formally establishing a broadcasting station category, which set aside the wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz) for entertainment broadcasts, and 485 meters (619 kHz) for market and weather reports.

A few months later Kraft applied for one of the new broadcasting licenses, which was issued on March 9, 1922, with the randomly assigned call letters KJR, for operation on both 360 and 485 meters. It had been initially reported that the station&#x27;s new call sign was &quot;KAJR&quot;, however this turned out to be an error in a telegram sent by the Commerce Department, and shortly thereafter it was correctly reported that the assignment was actually &quot;KJR&quot;. Later in 1922 KJR&#x27;s licensee was changed to &quot;Northwest Radio Service Co. (Vincent I. Kraft)&quot;.

KJR was the third license issued for a Seattle broadcasting station, preceded by KFC (Northern Radio &amp; Electric, licensed December 8, 1921, and deleted January 23, 1923) and KHQ (Louis Wasmer, licensed February 28, 1922, moved to Spokane in 1927–now KQNT). Despite this, KJR claims to have the oldest broadcasting lineage in Seattle by claiming 7XC as part of its history.

Because there was only the single entertainment wavelength of 360 meters available for use by multiple stations, each region had to set up a timesharing agreement to allocate timeslots. On June 23, 1922, three Seattle stations took turns operating from noon to 10:30 p.m., with KJR allocated 8:15 to 9:15 p.m. In May 1923 the Department of Commerce set aside an additional band of transmitting frequencies, and KJR was assigned to one of the lower power &quot;Class A&quot; frequencies, 1110 kHz, which was modified a short time later to 1060 kHz. In early 1925 the station transferred to one of the high power &quot;Class B&quot; frequencies, 780 kHz, and in 1927 the station was shifted again, to 860 kHz. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of a major reallocation resulting from the Federal Radio Commission&#x27;s (FRC) General Order 40, KJR was reassigned to a high-powered &quot;clear channel&quot; frequency of 970 kHz.

===New studios and transmitter===
KJR was originally located at the Times Square Building in downtown Seattle. In 1925, it moved to the Terminal Sales Building, where Kraft had erected a 50-foot (15 meter) mast to serve as the station&#x27;s antenna, which was soon superseded by a new, T-wire antenna built in North City near Lake Forest Park completed in 1927 (later the site of Saint Mark&#x27;s Catholic Church), at which point the studios were moved to the Home Savings Building at 1520 Westlake Ave.

Kraft sold the station to businessman Adolph Linden in 1928. KJR was planned to be the key station for a new radio network, the American Broadcasting Company (unrelated to the current ABC radio network), with plans for a nationwide expansion. However, the effort failed and Linden and a subsequent owner, Ahira Pierce, were jailed for illegal financing, using money from financial institutions which went bankrupt. KJR was then acquired by NBC, which in 1933 leased the station to the Fisher family-owned Fisher&#x27;s Blend Station, Inc., owners of KOMO radio, who moved the KJR studios to the Skinner Building.

===NBC Blue Network===

In 1936, KJR became an affiliate of the NBC Blue Network. It aired its dramas, comedies, sports and newscasts. This affiliation continued after the Blue Network became ABC in the 1940s. In 1937, a new transmitter was erected on Seattle&#x27;s West Waterway, which operated until 1996.

On March 29, 1941, KJR, along with the other stations on 970 kHz, moved to 1000 kHz, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA). That same day the Fisher family, after leasing the station for eight years, purchased it outright.

At that time, KJR was powered at 5,000 watts but it had submitted a construction permit to go up to 50,000 watts. The studios were in the Skinner Building in Seattle.

===Call letter swap between KJR and KOMO===
The August 1941 adoption of the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s &quot;duopoly&quot; rule restricted licensees from operating more than one radio station in a given market. At this time the Fisher family owned two Seattle stations – KJR on 1000 kHz and KOMO on 950 kHz – and their efforts to be granted an exemption were unsuccessful. The Fishers decided to keep the superior frequency of 1000 kHz, but also keep the KOMO call letters that they had held since the 1920s. Thus, on May 6, 1944, KOMO and KJR swapped call letters, with the KJR call sign moving from 1000 kHz to the less desirable 950 kHz. The next year KJR was sold to Birt F. Fisher, who was unrelated to the KOMO owners.

In 1946, KJR was purchased by Marshall Field&#x27;s Department Store chain. It continued its affiliation with ABC until 1953, when ABC affliliation switched to 1090 KING. In July 1952, Marshall Field sold the station to a group headed by Chicago businessman Ralph E. Stolkin, which sold it seven months later to two Portland businessmen, Theodore Gamble and Howard Lane.

===Frank Sinatra ownership===
KJR changed hands again, this time bought by Lester Smith in 1954. KJR became a pioneer Top 40 music station, continuing with this format until 1982. Smith moved the studios to the transmitter site on West Waterway in 1955. In 1957, the station was sold to entertainers Danny Kaye and Frank Sinatra, and Smith stayed on as general manager.

Sinatra sold his interest in the station to Smith in 1964, and the resulting partnership became known as &quot;Kaye-Smith Enterprises&quot;. In the 1960s, under the programming guidance of Pat O&#x27;Day, the station was top rated in Seattle and well known for introducing the Pacific Northwest to many recording stars such as Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Merrilee Rush and the Ventures.

Competitors against KJR&#x27;s top 40 format in the 1960s and 1970s included KOL 1300, KING 1090, and KIRO 710.

===Metromedia ownership===
KJR was sold to Metromedia in 1980. Metromedia was a New York-based media company with radio and television stations in many large cities in the U.S.

As youthful music moved to FM radio, KJR evolved its sound to adult contemporary in 1982, following in KING&#x27;s footsteps. In 1984, Metromedia sold the station to Ackerley Communications for $6 million in cash. In June 1988, the station shifted to oldies, playing the music that had made the station famous throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

===Sports radio===
KJR&#x27;s shift to sports programming was a gradual evolution starting in 1989, when the station added some sports-themed shows in middays and afternoons. The rest of the music programming was phased out in September 1991, making KJR a full-fledged sports radio station. The co-owned FM station at 95.7 MHz, which Ackerley had acquired (as KLTX) in December 1987, eventually switched its call sign to KJR-FM (now KJEB). KJR-FM broadcast a format that includes many of the songs and shows (including original American Top 40 shows from the 1970s) from KJR AM&#x27;s heyday as a Top 40 powerhouse.

In July 1994, KJR and KJR-FM were sold to a partnership with New Century Management and Ackerley titled &quot;New Century Media&quot; (Ackerley would re-acquire full control of the two stations in February 1998). Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) bought the stations in May 2002.

===FM simulcasts===
On November 4, 2011, at 7 a.m., KJR began simulcasting on 102.9 FM, replacing country-formatted KNBQ. This ended on June 13, 2013, when KNBQ reverted to an adult top 40 music format as KYNW. During this time, Clear Channel did not transfer the KJR-FM call letters from 95.7 to 102.9, instead co-branding the station as &quot;Sports Radio 950 AM and 102.9 FM KJR&quot;.

KJR&#x27;s programming returned to FM on March 8, 2022, when KUBE (93.3 FM) began simulcasting the station. The simulcast lasted until April 11, at which point KJR shifted to all-syndicated programming from Fox Sports Radio and CBS Sports Radio, which was moved from KFNQ (1090 AM) as a result of that station&#x27;s flip to all-conservative talk programming as &quot;The Patriot&quot;.

==Notable DJs==
KJR&#x27;s listeners were entertained by some of the country&#x27;s greatest radio personalities: Larry Lujack, Scotty Brink, Norm Gregory, Magic Matt Alan, Burl Barer, Pat O&#x27;Day, Eric Chase, Bob Shannon, Dick Curtis, &quot;World Famous&quot; Tom Murphy, Ric Hansen, Bobby Simon, Jerry Kaye, Gary Shannon, Ichabod Caine, &quot;Emperor&quot; Lee Smith, Lan Roberts, Kevin O&#x27;Brien (Kevin Metheny), Robert O. Smith, Charlie Brown, Bwana Johnny, Matt Riedy, Marion Seymour, Marty Riemer, Sky Walker, Tracy Mitchell, Bob Brooks and sports commentator Chuck Bolland, plus Bolland&#x27;s much younger brother Mark &quot;Jeffries&quot; Bolland. Gary &quot;Lockjock&quot; Lockwood, a.k.a. L.J., was the disk jockey who had the longest tenure on the &quot;Mighty Channel 95&quot;, from 1976 to 1991.

==Sports teams==
KJR served as the home of the Seattle SuperSonics from 1987 to 2006.

Since the 2006-2007 season, ISP Sports was the media rights holder for Husky athletics until IMG College took over. KJR was the Washington IMG College Network&#x27;s flagship station from 2002 to 2014. (KJR has since lost the broadcast rights back to KOMO.)

KJR carried some play-by-play from ESPN Radio, and some of the regular talk shows at night and during weekends.

In 2002, Seattle Mariners relief pitcher Jeff Nelson had surgery to remove bone chips from his pitching elbow. During his weekly show with Dave &quot;Softy&quot; Mahler, Nelson announced he would attempt to sell his bone chips on eBay. After earning bids as high as $23,600, eBay pulled the chips from auction for violating the site&#x27;s policy of not selling body parts.

In 2003, Seattle Storm point guard Sue Bird made a bet with morning host Mitch Levy that gained national publicity. The bet was over Bird&#x27;s season assist/turnover ratio. If the ratio finished higher that 3:1, Bird agreed to be spanked by Levy on the air. If Bird won the bet, Levy agreed to purchase Storm season tickets. The bet was later amended to include Bird yelling &quot;Harder, Daddy, Harder&quot;. The bet was ultimately called off by Bird. When asked at a later date, Tyler Orsborn (morning show producer at the time) suggested that Storm management were the real reason the bet was called off and not Bird.

During a 2006 radio interview with Dave &quot;Softy&quot; Mahler and former University of Washington quarterback Hugh Millen, then-Atlanta Falcons head coach Jim L. Mora said he&#x27;d be in the &quot;friggin&#x27; head of the line&quot; for the Washington Huskies football head coaching position, if it became available. Mora, who played for the University of Washington, later said he was only kidding during the interview, but was still fired by the Falcons at the end of the season. He would later coach the Seattle Seahawks for one season in 2009.

Host &quot;Softy&quot; began a feud with another sports show host in Salt Lake City, Utah after they argued about their predicted outcomes of the Washington vs. BYU game on September 5, 2008. After arguing with Hans Olsen of Sports Radio 1280 The Zone, Softy had an on-air meltdown where he claimed that he was going to choke Hans and repeatedly called him an idiot.

On August 26, 2017, KJR morning host Mitch Levy was arrested in connection with a prostitution sting. iHeartMedia has not issued a public statement on the matter. On October 6, Levy announced he would exit from the station after 23 years.

As of the 2018 Major League Soccer season, KJR is the English-speaking broadcast partner for Seattle Sounders FC with Matt Johnson on the call.

On March 3, 2021, the National Hockey League expansion team, the Seattle Kraken, announced a multi-year broadcast agreement with iHeart; as part of the deal, KJR serves as the broadcast home of the team, with some games simulcast on KJAQ. The deal also includes a promotional partnership with the entire iHeart Seattle cluster and the 80+ concerts and events to be held annually at Climate Pledge Arena.

<text>John Charles Rowe (December 8, 1856 – April 25, 1911) was an American professional baseball player, manager and team owner from 1877 to 1898. He played 12 years in Major League Baseball, as a shortstop (657 games), catcher (298 games), and outfielder (103 games), for four major league clubs. His longest stretches were in the National League with the Buffalo Bisons (1879–1885) and Detroit Wolverines (1886–1888). He was also a player-manager and part owner of the Buffalo Bisons of the Players&#x27; League in 1890, and the manager of the Buffalo Bisons (Eastern League) from 1896 to 1898.

Rowe appeared in 1,044 major league games, compiled a .286 batting average and .392 slugging percentage, and totaled 764 runs scored, 1,256 hits, 202 doubles, 88 triples, 28 home runs, and 644 RBIs. From 1881 to 1888, he was part of the &quot;Big Four&quot;, a group of renowned batters (the others being Dan Brouthers, Hardy Richardson, and Deacon White) who played together in Buffalo and Detroit and led Detroit to the National League pennant and 1887 World Series championship.

==Early years==
Rowe was born in Cold Spring Township, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, in 1856. His older brother, Dave Rowe, also played and managed in the major leagues between 1877 and 1888.

==Professional baseball==

===Minor leagues===
At age 19, Rowe began his career in organized baseball in 1876 with a club in Jacksonville, Illinois. In 1877, he played for the Milwaukee club in the League Alliance. He also played in 1877 and/or 1878 under Tom Loftus with the Peoria Reds. In 1879, Rowe and his brother, Dave Rowe, signed with the Rockford, Illinois team in the Northwestern League. At Rockford, Rowe earned a reputation as a hitter and &quot;one of the best bare-handed catchers in the game.&quot;

===Buffalo Bisons===
After the Northwestern League folded in early July 1878, Rowe signed with the Buffalo Bisons of the National League. He made his major league debut on September 6, 1879, at age 22, and played in eight games for Buffalo that season, batting .353 in 38 plate appearances.

Rowe remained with Buffalo for seven years from 1879 to 1885. During the 1879 to 1884 seasons, Rowe was principally a catcher, appearing in 272 games at that position, 91 games as an outfielder, 55 as a shortstop and 20 at third base. In 1881, he compiled a .333 batting average and led the National League with 11 triples. His .480 slugging percentage in 1881 was the third highest in the league, and his 2.8 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating was the fifth highest among the league&#x27;s position players. In 1882, he registered a 2.7 WAR rating and did not strike out even once in 329 plate appearances.

Rowe was one of four Buffalo players (with Dan Brouthers, Hardy Richardson, and Deacon White) who became known as the &quot;Big Four.&quot; The &quot;Big Four&quot; were &quot;regarded for many years as the greatest quartette (sic) in the history of the national pastime.&quot; During the 1884 season, the &quot;Big Four&quot; led Buffalo to a third place finish and a 64–47 (.577) record – the highest winning percentage in the club&#x27;s history. Rowe registered a career high 4.6 WAR rating in 1884 and ranked among the league leaders with 14 triples (3rd), a .450 slugging percentage (9th) and a .352 on-base percentage (10th). He also led the National League&#x27;s catchers in 1884 with a .943 fielding percentage.

In 1885, Rowe transitioned from a catcher to a shortstop, catching 23 games and playing shortstop in 65 games. Despite the strong bats of the &quot;Big Four&quot; (the &quot;Big Four&quot; combined for a .315 batting average in 1885), the Bisons had the worst pitching in the National League with a 4.28 earned run average (ERA), far above the league average of 2.82 ERA. The team finished in seventh place with a 38-74 record. The Bisons left the National League after the 1885 season.

===Detroit Wolverines===

In September 1885, the &quot;Big Four&quot; were sold by Buffalo to the Detroit Wolverines. All four remained with the Wolverines for three seasons, until the team disbanded after the 1888 season.

During the 1886 season, Rowe appeared in 111 games and was Detroit&#x27;s starting shortstop. He also appeared in three games as a catcher. He compiled a 4.2 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating during the 1886 season, the eighth highest rating among all position players in the National League. As a batter, he hit for .303 average and ranked among the league leaders with a 4.0 Offensive WAR rating (10th), 97 runs scored (10th) and 199 total bases (10th). Defensively, he also ranked among the league leaders with a 1.0 Defensive WAR rating (7th) and 310 assists at shortstop (5th). With the addition of the &quot;Big Four&quot;, the Wolverines improved substantially, finishing in second place with an 85-38 record.

The 1887 season was the pinnacle in the history of the Detroit Wolverines. The team won the National League pennant with a 79-45 record and then defeated the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series. Rowe was the starting shortstop for the 1887 team, appearing in 124 games at the position, and continuing to rank among the best players in the National League. Rowe hit for a .318 average, and his 4.1 WAR rating ranked as the 10th highest among the league&#x27;s position players. He further ranked among the league leaders with 135 runs scored (2nd), 30 doubles (7th) and 239 total bases (9th). He also had another solid year defensively, finishing with the fifth highest Defensive WAR rating (1.1) in the league, ranking second among the league&#x27;s shortstops with a .907 fielding percentage, and ranking third with 378 assists at shortstop. Rowe also played well in the postseason, scoring 12 runs and stealing five bases in the 1887 World Series.

During the 1888 season, the Wolverines finished in fifth place with a 68–63 record. Rowe continued to play well with a 2.6 WAR rating in 105 games as the Wolverines&#x27; shortstop. However, he committed a career high 72 errors, the second highest total in the National League by any player at any position. With high salaries owed to the team&#x27;s star players, and gate receipts declining markedly, the team folded in October 1888 with the players being sold to other teams. On October 16, 1888, the Wolverines sold Rowe and Pete Conway to the Pittsburgh Alleghenys.

===Pittsburgh===
Rowe initially refused to recognize the validity of his sale to the Pittsburgh Alleghenys. In December 1888, Rowe and Deacon White purchased interests in the Buffalo baseball club, deciding they would prefer to return to Buffalo as co-owners, managers, and players. William Nimick, the Alleghenys&#x27; owner, refused to release Rowe and White, reportedly saying, &quot;If they don&#x27;t want to play in Pittsburgh, they&#x27;ll play nowhere.&quot; In July 1888, Rowe and White agreed to play for Pittsburgh. He appeared in 75 games as the Alleghenys&#x27; shortstop, but his batting average dropped to .259.

===Players&#x27; League===
In 1890, Rowe concluded his playing career as a player, manager, and owner of the Buffalo Bisons in the newly organized Players&#x27; League. Rowe and Deacon White owned the club. Rowe appeared in 125 games as the shortstop and saw his batting average drop to .250. Defensively, he led the Players&#x27; League shortstops with a .901 fielding percentage. He appeared in his last major league game on October 5, 1890. As the team&#x27;s manager, he compiled a 27-72 (.273) record. The Players&#x27; League collapsed after the 1890 season, but Rowe and White sold the Buffalo club and grounds to &quot;some Buffalo capitalists&quot; for $2,500 in stock and $8,000 in cash. In 1891, &quot;The Sporting Life&quot; wrote that, having sold for a profit before the league&#x27;s collapse, &quot;Rowe and White are pretty slick, you bet.&quot;

===Return to minors===
Although Rowe did not return to the major leagues, he continued to play minor league baseball through the 1893 season. He played in 1891 for the Lincoln Rustlers of the Western Association. Rowe was reunited with his brother, Dave Rowe, who was manager of the Lincoln club.

Rowe concluded his playing career back in Buffalo, playing for the Buffalo Bisons of the Eastern League. In his last season of organized baseball, Rowe, at age 36, continued to hit well. In 110 games for the 1893 Bisons, Rowe compiled a .349 batting average and .456 slugging percentage with 113 runs scored, 22 doubles, nine triples, three home runs and 18 stolen bases.

===Manager at Buffalo===
In November 1895, after two years out of the sport, Rowe was hired to manage the Buffalo Bisons (Eastern League) for the 1896 season. At the time, &quot;The Sporting Life&quot; wrote: &quot;Rowe is a resident of Buffalo and has lived in this city with his family for many years. He is well known in local base ball circles, and, for that matter, his is a familiar name in connection with the history of the game all over the country.&quot; Rowe managed the Bisons from 1896 to 1898. As the Bisons&#x27; manager, he developed several major league players, including Claude Ritchey, Chick Stahl, Harry Smith and Jack Barry. In 1897, Rowe had an all red-headed outfield at Buffalo that inspired Zane Grey&#x27;s 1922 story, &quot;The Red-Headed Outfield&quot;.

==Later years==
After retiring from baseball, Rowe operated a cigar store in Buffalo. His store was reportedly &quot;a popular gathering place for sporting figures of the city.&quot; In January 1899, &quot;The Sporting Life&quot; described him as &quot;one of the most contented men in Buffalo these days&quot;, attending to his cigar business, and &quot;ever ready to talk base ball.&quot;

Rowe became ill in 1910 and moved to St. Louis, Missouri, to live with his daughter, Helen. Rowe died in April 1911 at his daughter&#x27;s residence in St. Louis at age 55. His cause of death has been reported as aortic regurgitation and nephritis. He was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.
