<text>The Plucky Duck Show is an American animated television series produced by Warner Bros. Animation and Amblin Entertainment. It is a short-lived spin-off of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; focusing primarily on the character of Plucky Duck. It premiered on September 19, 1992, and ended on December 12, 1992, with a total of 13 episodes.

==History==
Of the 13 episodes produced, only &quot;The Return of Batduck&quot; was original to the series. All remaining episodes were compilations of &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; produced shorts, though some aired on &quot;The Plucky Duck Show&quot; first.

The theme song is a rendition of the &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; theme, set to the same music, but with Plucky himself as the subject of the song. Some of the lyrics were reused in the &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Tiny Toons Christmas Special&quot;.

After the show was canceled, &quot;Batduck&quot; was edited and added in as an episode of &quot;Tiny Toons&quot;. The show&#x27;s formula was attempted again several years later when &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;, the supporting characters from &quot;Animaniacs&quot; (Steven Spielberg&#x27;s next collaboration with Warner Bros. Animation), were also given their own show. Unlike &quot;The Plucky Duck Show&quot;, however, &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; consists entirely of original material rather than reusing pre-existing shorts from the show it was spun-off from.

The &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; segment was made commercially available on the &quot;Tiny Toons Sing!&quot; CD/cassette album.

<doc id="897127" wikidata="Q782515" url="?curid=897127" title="Ureterocele">
<text>A ureterocele is a congenital abnormality found in the ureter. In this condition the distal ureter balloons at its opening into the bladder, forming a sac-like pouch. It is most often associated with a duplicated collection system, where two ureters drain their respective kidney instead of one. Simple ureterocele, where the condition involves only a single ureter, represents only twenty percent of cases.

Since the advent of the ultrasound, most ureteroceles are diagnosed prenatally. The pediatric and adult conditions are often found incidentally, i.e., through diagnostic imaging performed for unrelated reasons.

==Classification==
; Intravesical : Confined within the bladder
; Ectopic : Some part extends to the bladder neck or urethra
; Stenotic : Intravesical ureterocele with a narrow opening
; Sphincteric : Ectopic ureterocele with an orifice distal to the bladder neck
; Sphincterostenotic : Orifice is both stenotic and distal to the bladder neck
; Cecoureterocele : Ectopic ureterocele that extends into the urethra, but the orifice is in the bladder

==Signs and symptoms==

The signs and symptoms of ureterocele in the latter two forms can easily be confused with other medical conditions. Symptoms can include:
* Frequent urinary tract infections
* Pyelonephritis
* Obstructive voiding symptoms
* Urinary retention
* Failure to thrive
* Hematuria
* Cyclic abdominal pain
* Urolithiasis
* Cobra head sign is seen in radiography
* In females: salpingitis, hydrosalpinx with sepsis or torsion. T.O. mass.
===Complications===
Many other complications arise from ureteroceles. Redundant collection systems are usually smaller in diameter than single, and predispose the patient to impassable kidney stones. The effective &quot;bladder within a bladder&quot; compounds this problem by increasing the collision of uric acid particles, the process by which uric acid stones are formed. Ureterocele is also associated with poor kidney function. It can cause frequent blockage of the ureter leading to serious kidney damage. In other cases, a small, upper portion of the kidney is congenitally non-functional. Though often benign, this problem can necessitate the removal of non-functioning parts.

==Causes==
Definitive causes of ureterocele have not been found. While the abnormal growth occurs within the uterus, it has not been substantiated that genetics are to blame. Congenital abnormalities of the mesonephric duct in males can lead to the formation of a ureterocele, which often coincide with ipsilateral agenesis of the kidney (atrophic kidney) and seminal vesicle cysts, this is known as Zinner Syndrome.
==Diagnosis==
IVU-shows Adder head appearance or Cobra head appearance.
Cystoscopy-shows translucent cyst which is thin walled surrounding ureteric orifice

==Treatment==
* Single-system ureterocele: initial management is usually endoscopic incision of the ureterocele, which can be followed by surgical ureteric re-implantation to preserve renal function and prevent reflux.
* Duplex-system ureterocele: treatment options vary with the individual and include: endoscopic incision of the corresponding ureteric orifice in case of ureteric meatal stricture; upper pole nephrectomy for a poorly functioning unit with ureterectomy or, where there is useful renal function, ureteropyelostomy.

<text>The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) is an independent, international cooperative of national research institutions and governmental research agencies. It conducts large-scale comparative studies of educational achievement and other aspects of education.

Since its founding in 1958, IEA has conducted more than 30 research studies of cross-national achievement. IEA studies focus on subjects relating to mathematics, science, reading, civic and citizenship education, computer and information literacy, and teacher education, among others.

The IEA is responsible for the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) and International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS).

==History==

Even though the IEA became a legal entity in 1967, its origins date back to 1958 when a group of scholars, educational psychologists, sociologists, and psychometricians met at the UNESCO Institute for Education in Hamburg, Germany, to discuss problems of school and student evaluation. They believed that an effective evaluation requires examination of both educational inputs as well as its outcomes (such as knowledge, attitudes, and participation). The founders assumed that if research could obtain evidence from across a wide range of systems, the variability would be sufficient to reveal important relationships within different school systems. They say they strongly rejected data-free assertions about the relative merits of various education systems, and aim to identify factors that would have meaningful and consistent influence on educational outcomes.

==Location==

IEA Amsterdam The IEA headquarters is located in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

IEA Hamburg The IEA&#x27;s data processing and research department is located in Hamburg, Germany.

<doc id="897133" wikidata="Q769471" url="?curid=897133" title="Feline leukemia virus">
<text>Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a retrovirus that infects cats. FeLV can be transmitted from infected cats when the transfer of saliva or nasal secretions is involved. If not defeated by the animal&#x27;s immune system, the virus weakens the cat&#x27;s immune system, which can lead to diseases which can be lethal. Because FeLV is cat-to-cat contagious, FeLV+ cats should only live with other FeLV+ cats.

FeLV is categorized into four subgroups, A, B, C and T. An infected cat has a combination of FeLV-A and one or more of the other subgroups. Symptoms, prognosis and treatment are all affected by subgroup.

FeLV+ cats often have a shorter lifespan, but can still live &quot;normal&quot;, healthy lives.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of infection with feline leukemia virus are quite varied and include loss of appetite, poor coat condition, anisocoria (uneven pupils), infections of the skin, bladder, and respiratory tract, oral disease, seizures, lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), skin lesions, fatigue, fever, weight loss, stomatitis, gingivitis, litter box avoidance, pancytopenia, recurring bacterial and viral illnesses, anemia, diarrhea and jaundice.

Asymptomatic carriers will show no signs of disease, often for many years.

===Progression===

The disease has a wide range of effects. The cat can fight off the infection and become totally immune, can become a healthy carrier that never gets sick itself but can infect other cats, or a mid-level case in which the cat has a compromised immune system. Nevertheless, the development of lymphomas is considered the final stage of the disease. Although it is thought that virus protein has to be present to induce lymphomas in cats, newer evidence shows that a high percentage of FeLV-Antigen negative lymphomas contain FeLV-DNA, indicating a &quot;hit-and-run&quot; mechanism of virus-induced tumor development.

Once the virus has entered the cat, there are six stages to a FeLV infection:
* Stage One: The virus enters the cat, usually through the pharynx where it infects the epithelial cells and infects the tonsilar B-lymphocytes and macrophages. These white blood cells then filter down to the lymph nodes and begin to replicate.
* Stage Two: The virus enters the blood stream and begins to distribute throughout the body.
* Stage Three: The lymphoid system (which produces antibodies to attack infected and cancerous cells) becomes infected, with further distribution throughout the body.
* Stage Four: The main point in the infection, where the virus can take over the body&#x27;s immune system and cause viremia. During this stage the hemolymphatic system and intestines become infected.

If the cat&#x27;s immune system does not fight off the virus, then it progresses to:
* Stage Five: The bone marrow becomes infected. At this point, the virus will stay with the cat for the rest of its life. In this phase, the virus replicates and is released four to seven days later in infected neutrophils, and sometimes lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils (all white blood cells formed in the bone marrow).
* Stage Six: The cat&#x27;s body is overwhelmed by infection and mucosal and glandular epithelial cells (tissue that forms a thin protective layer on exposed bodily surfaces and forms the lining of internal cavities, ducts, and organs) become infected. The virus replicates in epithelial tissues including salivary glands, oropharynx, stomach, esophagus, intestines, trachea, nasopharynx, renal tubules, bladder, pancreas, alveolar ducts, and sebaceous ducts from the muzzle.

==Transmission==

Cats infected with FeLV can serve as sources of infection of FeLV-A. Cats can pass the virus between themselves through saliva and close contact, by biting another cat, and (rarely) through a litter box or food dish used by an infected cat.

Once a cat has been infected with FeLV-A, additional mutated forms of the original FeLV-A virus may arise, as may FeLV subgroups B, C and T.

In addition to domestic cats, some other members of Felidae are now threatened by FeLV (e.g. lynx and Florida panther). Overwhelming epidemiologic evidence suggests FeLV is not transmissible to either humans or dogs.

Approximately 0.5% of pet cats are persistently infected with FeLV, but many more pet cats (&gt;35%) have specific IgG antibodies which indicate prior exposure and subsequent development of immunity instead of infection. FeLV is highly infectious.

Kittens can be born with it, having contracted it from their mother while &quot;in utero&quot;.

Infection is far higher in city cats, stray or owned, than in rural cats: this is entirely due to the amount of contact the cats have with each other.

==Diagnosis and prognosis==
Testing for FeLV is possible with ELISA tests that look for viral antigens, free particles found in the bloodstream. These ELISA tests use blood samples most often, but can also use saliva or eye secretions. The sample is added to a container or dish that contains the antibodies to the viral antigens. If the antigens are present in the sample, the antibodies will bind to them and an indicator on the test will change color. These give a definitive diagnosis, but it cannot differentiate between acute or persistent infections. Therefore, it is recommended that the cat be retested in three to four months after the positive result to determine if the virus has been cleared from the body. Diagnosis can also be made by reference lab testing, using an immunofluorescence (IFA) test. The IFA test uses a blood sample and will detect the virus once it is in the bone marrow by detecting the virus&#x27;s presence in white blood cells. IFA testing will not give positive results for transient, primary infections - the infection must be persistent to get a positive result on this test. Other than ELISA and IFA testing, routine laboratory blood work may show changes that indicate infection but cannot be used as a definitive diagnosis. There may be blood cell count changes like leukopenia, decreased Packed Cell Volume (PCV) and Total Protein (TP) levels due to anemia, hemoconcentration and hypoglycemia due to vomiting and diarrhea, electrolyte imbalance caused by dehydration and anorexia, and recurrent urinary tract infections.

Cats diagnosed as persistently infected by ELISA testing may die within a few months or may remain asymptomatic for longer; median survival time after diagnosis is 2.5 years.

FeLV is categorized into four subgroups.
* FeLV-A is responsible for the immunosuppression characteristic of the disease. The vast majority of cats with FeLV have FeLV-A. An exception was reported in 2013.
* FeLV-B causes an additional increase in the incidence of tumors and other abnormal tissue growths. About half of FeLV infected cats have FeLV-B. It forms by recombination of FeLV-A and cat endogenous FeLV (enFeLV).
* FeLV-C causes severe anemia. Approximately 1% of FeLV infected cats have FeLV-C. It forms by mutation of FeLV-A.
* FeLV-T leads to lymphoid depletion and immunodeficiency. It forms by mutation of FeLV-A.

The fatal diseases are leukemias, lymphomas, and non-regenerative anemias. Although there is no known cure for the virus infection, in 2006 the United States Department of Agriculture approved Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator as a treatment aid for FeLV (see Treatment).

In Canada, one feline infected with progressive Feline Leukemia Virus Type C and its Immune-Mediated Hemolytic Anemia complication has been successfully managed so far for over 6 months with the use of high-dose corticosteroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat opportunistic and comorbid infections, antiviral medications, and immunomodulators such as cyclosporine after requiring multiple packed red blood cell transfusions to raise a critically low blood cell count.

==Prevention==
Three types of vaccines for FeLV are available: an adjuvanted killed virus noninfectious vaccine, an adjuvanted subunit vaccine, and a nonadjuvanted canarypox virus-vectored recombinant infectious vaccine (ATCvet code QI066AA01 and various combination vaccines), though no currently available vaccine offers 100% protection from the virus. Vaccination is recommended for high-risk cats: those that have access to the outdoors, feral cats, cats that do not have the virus but live with an infected cat, multicat households, and cats with an unknown status, such as cats in catteries and shelters.

Serious side effects have also been reported as a result of FeLV vaccination; in particular, a small percentage of cats who received the adjuvanted killed virus vaccine developed vaccine-associated sarcomas, an aggressive tumour, at the injection site. The development of sarcomas with the use of the old FeLV and other vaccines may be due to the inflammation caused by aluminium adjuvants in the vaccines.

Merial produces a recombinant vaccine consisting of canarypox virus carrying FeLV &quot;gag&quot; and &quot;env&quot; genes (sold as PUREVAX FeLV in the US and Eurifel FeLV in Europe). This is thought to be safer than the old vaccine as it does not require an adjuvant to be effective. Although this is a live virus, it originates from a bird host and so does not replicate in mammals.

==Viral structure==
Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is an RNA virus in the subfamily Oncovirinae belonging to the Retroviridae family. The virus comprises 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; LTRs and three genes: Gag (structural), Pol (enzymes) and Env (envelope and transmembrane); the total genome is about 9,600 base pairs.

See the entry on retroviruses for more details on the life cycle of FeLV.

==Treatment==

===Approved US treatment===
In 2006, the United States Department of Agriculture issued a conditional license for a new treatment aid termed Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator (LTCI). Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator is manufactured and distributed exclusively by T-Cyte Therapeutics, Inc.

Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator is intended as an aid in the treatment of cats infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and/or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and the associated symptoms of lymphocytopenia, opportunistic infection, anemia, granulocytopenia, or thrombocytopenia. The absence of any observed adverse events in several animal species suggests that the product has a very low toxicity profile.

Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator is a potent regulator of CD-4 lymphocyte production and function. It has been shown to increase lymphocyte numbers and Interleukin 2 production in animals.

Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator is a single chain polypeptide. It is a strongly cationic glycoprotein, and is purified with cation exchange resin. Purification of protein from bovine-derived stromal cell supernatants produces a substantially homogeneous factor, free of extraneous materials. The bovine protein is homologous with other mammalian species and is a homogeneous 50 kDa glycoprotein with an isoelectric point of 6.5. The protein is prepared in a lyophilized 1 microgram dose. Reconstitution in sterile diluent produces a solution for subcutaneous injection.

===Approved European treatment===
Interferon-ω (omega) is sold in Europe at least under the name Virbagen Omega and manufactured by Virbac. When used in treatment of cats infected with FeLV in non-terminal clinical stages (over the age of 9 weeks) there have been substantial improvements in mortality rates; in non-anemic cats, mortality rate of 50% was reduced by approximately 20% following treatment.

==History==
FeLV was first described in cats in 1964. The disease was originally associated with leukemia; however, it was later realized that the initial signs are generally anemia and immunosuppression. The first diagnostic test became available in 1973, which led to a &quot;test and elimination&quot; regime, dramatically reducing the number of infected cats in the general population. The first vaccine became available in 1986.

==Comparison with feline immunodeficiency virus==
FeLV and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) are sometimes mistaken for one another, though the viruses differ in many ways. Although they are both in the same retroviral subfamily (Orthoretrovirinae), they are classified in different genera (FeLV is a gamma-retrovirus and FIV is a lentivirus like HIV-1). Their shapes are quite different: FeLV is more circular while FIV is elongated. The two viruses are also quite different genetically, and their protein coats differ in size and composition. Although many of the diseases caused by FeLV and FIV are similar, the specific ways in which they are caused also differ. Also, while the feline leukemia virus may cause symptomatic illness in an infected cat, an FIV infected cat can remain completely asymptomatic its entire lifetime.

<doc id="897134" wikidata="Q19" url="?curid=897134" title="Cheating">
<text>Cheating generally describes various actions designed to subvert rules in order to obtain unfair advantages. This includes acts of bribery, cronyism and nepotism in any situation where individuals are given preference using inappropriate criteria. The rules infringed may be explicit, or they may be from an unwritten code of conduct based on morality, ethics or custom, making the identification of cheating conduct a potentially subjective process. Cheating can refer specifically to infidelity. Someone who is known for cheating is referred to as a &quot;cheat&quot; in British English, and a &quot;cheater&quot; in American English.

==Academic==

Academic cheating is a significantly common occurrence in high schools and colleges in the United States. Statistically, 64% of public high school students admit to serious test cheating. 58% say they have plagiarized. 95% of students admit to some form of cheating. This includes tests, examinations, copying homework, and papers. Only 50% of private school students, however, admit to this. The report was made in June 2005 by Rutgers University professor Donald McCabe for The Center for Academic Integrity. The findings were corroborated in part by a Gallup survey. In McCabe&#x27;s 2,001 of 4,500 high school students, &quot;74% said they cheated on a test, 72% cheated on a written work, and 97% reported to at least had copied someone&#x27;s homework or peeked at someone&#x27;s test. 1/3 reported to have repeatedly cheated.&quot; The new revolution in high-tech digital info contributes enormously to the new wave in cheating: online term-paper mills sell formatted reports on practically any topic, services exist to prepare any kind of homework or take online tests for students (despite the fact that this phenomenon, and these websites, are well known to educators), digital audio players can contain notes, and graphing calculators store formulas to solve math problems.

For centuries, rampant cheating and examiner-bribery were common problems for the Chinese civil service examinations, the main route to career success for literate men in imperial China, as detailed in books like the Ming-dynasty &quot;Book of Swindles&quot;.

== Sport, games and gambling ==

=== Sports ===

Cheating in sports is the intentional breaking of rules in order to obtain an advantage over the other teams or players. Sports are governed by both customs and explicit rules regarding acts which are permitted and forbidden at the event and away from it. Forbidden acts frequently include performance-enhancing drug taking (known as &quot;doping&quot;), using equipment that does not conform to the rules or altering the condition of equipment during play, and deliberate harassment or injury to competitors.
High-profile examples of alleged doping cheating include Lance Armstrong&#x27;s use of steroids in professional road cyclingparticularly controversial as it is widely suspected that a high percentage of professional cyclists are using prohibited substancesBen Johnson&#x27;s disqualification following the 100 metres final at the 1988 Summer Olympics, and admissions of steroid use by former professional baseball players after they have retired, such as José Canseco and Ken Caminiti. A famous sporting scandal involving cheating via harassment and injury occurred in 1994 in figure skating when Tonya Harding&#x27;s ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, hired Shane Stant to break Nancy Kerrigan&#x27;s leg to remove her from the year&#x27;s competitions and prevent her from competing with Harding. One of the most famous instances of cheating involving a prohibited player action occurred during the 1986 FIFA World Cup quarter-final, when Diego Maradona used his hand to punch the ball into the goal of England goalkeeper Peter Shilton. Using the hand or arm by anyone other than a goalkeeper is illegal according to the rules of association football.

Illegally altering the condition of playing equipment is frequently seen in bat sports such as baseball and cricket, which are heavily dependent on equipment condition. For example, in baseball, a pitcher using a doctored baseball, such as a spitball or an emery ball, or a batter using a corked bat are some examples of this. Tennis and golf are also subject to equipment cheating, with players being accused of using rackets of illegal string tension, or golf clubs of illegal weight, size, or make. Equipment cheating can also occur via the use of external aids in situations where equipment is prohibitedsuch as in American football via the use of stickum on the hands of receivers, making the ball easier to catch. An example of this is Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, who admitted to regularly and illegally using &quot;stickum&quot; throughout his career, calling into question the integrity of his receiving records.

Athletic cheating is a widespread problem. For example, in professional bodybuilding, cheating is now estimated to be so universal that it is now considered impossible to engage in professional competition without cheating and the use of supposedly banned substances; bodybuilders who refuse to take banned substances now compete in natural bodybuilding leagues.

Cheating may also be seen in coaching. One of the most common forms of this is the use of bribery and kickbacks in the player recruitment process. Such practices are widespread all across athletics, and are particularly visible in college sports recruitment. Another common form of cheating in coaching is profiteering in association with gamblers and match fixing. The most famous coach of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Runnin&#x27; Rebels basketball team, Jerry Tarkanian, was accused of both recruitment fraud and gambling fraud over the course of his career and was the subject of intense NCAA scrutiny. Another form of this involves a team coach or other manager undertaking corporate espionage or another form of prohibited spying in order to obtain details about other teams&#x27; strategies and tactics. The 2007 New England Patriots videotaping controversy is an example of this, in which the New England Patriots were found to have videotaped an opposing team from an unapproved location while trying to obtain defensive signals. As was the Pittsburgh Steelers use of, at the time legal, performance enhancers. However, there was cheating proven by the Denver Broncos during their back-to-back titles in the late 1990s to circumvent the league&#x27;s salary cap and obtain and retain players that they would otherwise not have been able to. Circumvention of rules governing conduct and procedures of a sport can also be considered cheating. a form of collusion.

An example of cheating via judging collusion occurred in the 2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal when the Russian team was awarded a gold medal over the Canadian team in an alleged vote-swapping judging deal; the Canadian team&#x27;s silver medals were eventually upgraded to gold at a second awards ceremony and the French judge was suspended for misconduct. The head of the French skating federation was later also suspended, and both were banned from the 2006 Olympic Games. The International Skating Union modified its judging system as a result of this case.

Cheating is also used to refer to movements in strength training that transfer weight from an isolated or fatigued muscle group to a different or fresh muscle group. This allows the cheater to move an initial greater weight (if the cheating continues through an entire training set) or to continue exercising past the point of muscular exhaustion (if the cheating begins part-way through the set). As strength training is not a sport, cheating has no rule-based consequences, but can result in injury or a failure to meet training goals. This is because each exercise is designed to target specific muscle groups and if the proper form is not used the weight can be transferred away from the targeted group.

=== Video games ===
In video games, cheating can take the form of secret access codes in single-player games (such as the Konami code) which unlock a bonus for the player when entered, hacks and exploits which give players an unfair advantage in online multiplayer games and single-player modes, or unfair collusion between players in online games (such as a player who spectates a match, removing limitations such as &quot;fog of war&quot;, and reports on enemy positions to game partners).

Attitudes towards cheating vary. Using exploits in single-player modes is usually considered to be simply another form of exploring the game&#x27;s content unless the player&#x27;s accomplishments are to be submitted competitively, and is common in single-player games with a high difficulty level; however, cheating in multiplayer modes is considered immoral and harshly condemned by fair players and developers alike. Cheating allows casual players to complete games at much-accelerated speed, which can be helpful in some cinematic or single-player games, which can take a subjectively long time to finish, as is typical of the role-playing game (RPG) genre. While this may be seen as a hasty advantage causing no damage to anyone, in a multi-player game such as MMORPGs the repercussions of cheating are much more damaging, breaking the risk/reward curve of the game and causing fair players to lose online matches and/or character development. Cheating in those types of games is generally prohibitedthough often widespread anyway. In many circles, the purchasing of items or currency from sources outside the game is also considered to be cheating. The terms of service from many games where this is possible directly prohibit this activity. One area where there is little consensus involves modern free-to-play business models which support and are supported by the exchange of real-world money for in-game services, items, and advantages. Games that grant excessive advantages only available to paying customers may be criticized as being &#x27;pay to win&#x27;sometimes considered a form of &quot;cheating&quot; that is actually legitimatized by the systemwhilst games that limit real-money purchases to cosmetic changes are generally accepted as fair.

Another form of video game cheating is when a player does things to interact with game objects that are unforeseen by the programmers and break the intended function or reward system of the object. This can involve the way enemies are encountered, objectives met, items used, or any other game object that contains a software bug. One common example is the exploitation of errors in an enemy&#x27;s pathfinding; if a player can cause an enemy to become &quot;stuck&quot; in a given terrain feature, that player can then usually kill the enemy from a distance without risk, even if much stronger, and achieve greater rewards than the player is intended to be able to at that level of progression. Another example was common in early first-person shooter games and involved skipping a weapon&#x27;s reload timer by quickly switching weapons back and forth without actually reloading the weapons, resulting in what was effectively instant reloading. It also can be accomplished through means of altered game files substituted for the normal files, or image graphics changed to permit greater visibility of the targets, etc.for example, replacing the colors on a dark-colored enemy intended to blend in with the background with a bright color permitting instant visibility and targeting. Generally speaking, there is often some concern that this is not truly cheating, as it is the fault of the programmers that such an exploit exists in the first place. However, technically, as with live sports, it is cheating if the player is not playing the game in a formally approved manner, breaking unwritten rules. In some cases, this behavior is directly prohibited by the terms of service of the game.

=== Gambling ===

The wagering of money on an event extends the motivation for cheating beyond directly participating competitors. As in sport and games, cheating in gambling is generally related to directly breaking rules or laws, or misrepresenting the event being wagered on, or interfering in the outcome.
A boxer who takes a dive, a casino which plays with secretly loaded dice, a rigged roulette wheel or slot machine, or a doctored deck of cards, are generally regarded as cheating, because it has misrepresented the likelihood of the game&#x27;s outcomes beyond what is reasonable to expect a bettor to protect himself against. However, for a bookmaker to flatter a horse in order to sell bets on it at shorter odds may be regarded as salesmanship rather than cheating, since bettors can counter this by informing themselves and by exercising skepticism.
Doping a horse is a clear example of cheating by interfering with the instruments of the event under wager. Again, not all interference is cheating; spending money to support the health and well-being of a horse one has wagered on is not in itself generally regarded as cheating, nor is improving the morale of a sportsman one has backed by cheering for them. Generally, interference is more likely to be regarded as cheating if it diminishes the standard of a sporting competition, damages a participant, or modifies the apparatus of the event or game.

In the world of gambling, knowing a secret which is not priced into the odds gives a significant advantage, which may give rise to a perception of cheating. However, legal systems do not regard secretly making use of knowledge in this way as criminal deception in itself. This is in contrast to the financial world, where people with certain categories of relationship to a company are restricted from transacting, which would constitute the crime of insider trading. This may be because of a stronger presumption of equality between investors, or it may be because a company employee who also trades in the company&#x27;s stock has a conflict of interest, and has thus misrepresented himself the company.
An advantage player typically uses mental, observational or technical skills to choose when and how much to bet, and neither interferes with the instruments of the game nor breaks any of its rules. Representatives of the casino industry have claimed that all advantage play is cheating, but this point of view is reflected neither among societies in general nor in legislation. , the only example anywhere of a type of advantage play being unlawful is for an advantage player to use an auxiliary device in the U.S. State of Nevada, whose legislation is uniquely influenced by large casino corporations. Nonetheless it remains a widely held principle that the law should not impose any restraint over the method by which a player arrives at a playing or betting decision from information held by him lawfully and which he is not debarred from under the rules of the game. In &quot;hole carding&quot;, a casino player tries to catch sight of the front of cards which are dealt face-down according to the rules.
One way of cheating and profiting through gambling is to bet against oneself and then intentionally lose. This is known as throwing a game or taking a dive. Illegal gamblers will at times pay sports players to lose so that they may profit from the otherwise unexpected loss. An especially notorious case is the Black Sox Scandal, when eight players of the 1919 Chicago White Sox took payment from gamblers and intentionally played poorly. Another happened in boxing when Jake LaMotta famously took a dive against Billy Fox in order to obtain his entry to a championship match against Marcel Cerdan, a deal offered by the mobsters who controlled professional boxing.

== Business ==

Various regulations exist to prevent unfair competitive advantages in business and finance, for example competition law, or the prohibition of insider trading.

The most extreme forms of cheating (e.g. attempting to gain money through outright deceit rather than providing a service) are referred to as fraud.

<text>A life-support system is the combination of equipment that allows survival in an environment or situation that would not support that life in its absence. It is generally applied to systems supporting human life in situations where the outside environment is hostile, such as outer space or underwater, or medical situations where the health of the person is compromised to the extent that the risk of death would be high without the function of the equipment.

In human spaceflight, a life-support system is a group of devices that allow a human being to survive in outer space.
US government space agency NASA, and private spaceflight companies
use the phrase &quot;environmental control and life-support system&quot; or the acronym ECLSS when describing these systems. The life-support system may supply air, water and food. It must also maintain the correct body temperature, an acceptable pressure on the body and deal with the body&#x27;s waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites may also be necessary. Components of the life-support system are life-critical, and are designed and constructed using safety engineering techniques.

In underwater diving, the breathing apparatus is considered to be life support equipment, and a saturation diving system is considered a life-support system – the personnel who are responsible for operating it are called life support technicians. The concept can also be extended to submarines, crewed submersibles and atmospheric diving suits, where the breathing gas requires treatment to remain respirable, and the occupants are isolated from the outside ambient pressure and temperature.

Medical life-support systems include heart-lung machines, medical ventilators and dialysis equipment.

== Human physiological and metabolic needs ==
A crewmember of typical size requires approximately of food, water, and oxygen per day to perform standard activities on a space mission, and outputs a similar amount in the form of waste solids, waste liquids, and carbon dioxide. The mass breakdown of these metabolic parameters is as follows: of oxygen, of food, and of water consumed, converted through the body&#x27;s physiological processes to of solid wastes, of liquid wastes, and of carbon dioxide produced. These levels can vary due to activity level of a specific mission assignment, but must obey the principle of mass balance. Actual water use during space missions is typically double the given value, mainly due to non-biological use (e.g. showering). Additionally, the volume and variety of waste products varies with mission duration to include hair, finger nails, skin flaking, and other biological wastes in missions exceeding one week in length. Other environmental considerations such as radiation, gravity, noise, vibration, and lighting also factor into human physiological response in outer space, though not with the more immediate effect that the metabolic parameters have.

=== Atmosphere ===
Outer space life-support systems maintain atmospheres composed, at a minimum, of oxygen, water vapor and carbon dioxide. The partial pressure of each component gas adds to the overall barometric pressure.

However, the elimination of diluent gases substantially increases fire risks, especially in ground operations when for structural reasons the total cabin pressure must exceed the external atmospheric pressure; see Apollo 1. Furthermore, oxygen toxicity becomes a factor at high oxygen concentrations. For this reason, most modern crewed spacecraft use conventional air (nitrogen/oxygen) atmospheres and use pure oxygen only in pressure suits during extravehicular activity where acceptable suit flexibility mandates the lowest inflation pressure possible.

=== Water ===
Water is consumed by crew members for drinking, cleaning activities, EVA thermal control, and emergency uses. It must be stored, used, and reclaimed (from waste water and exhaled water vapor) efficiently since no on-site sources currently exist for the environments reached in the course of human space exploration. Future lunar missions may utilize water sourced from polar ices; Mars missions may utilize water from the atmosphere or ice deposits.

=== Food ===
All space missions to date have used supplied food. Life-support systems could include a plant cultivation system which allows food to be grown within buildings or vessels. This would also regenerate water and oxygen. However, no such system has flown in outer space as yet. Such a system could be designed so that it reuses most (otherwise lost) nutrients. This is done, for example, by composting toilets which reintegrate waste material (excrement) back into the system, allowing the nutrients to be taken up by the food crops. The food coming from the crops is then consumed again by the system&#x27;s users and the cycle continues. The logistics and area requirements involved however have been prohibitive in implementing such a system to date.

=== Gravity ===
Depending on the length of the mission, astronauts may need artificial gravity to reduce the effects of space adaptation syndrome, body fluid redistribution, and loss of bone and muscle mass. Two methods of generating artificial weight in outer space exist.

==== Linear acceleration ====
If a spacecraft&#x27;s engines could produce thrust continuously on the outbound trip with a thrust level equal to the mass of the ship, it would continuously accelerate at the rate of per second, and the crew would experience a pull toward the ship&#x27;s aft bulkhead at normal Earth gravity (one g). The effect is proportional to the rate of acceleration. When the ship reaches the halfway point, it would turn around and produce thrust in the retrograde direction to slow down.

==== Rotation ====
Alternatively, if the ship&#x27;s cabin is designed with a large cylindrical wall, or with a long beam extending another cabin section or counterweight, spinning it at an appropriate speed will cause centrifugal force to simulate the effect of gravity. If &quot;ω&quot; is the angular velocity of the ship&#x27;s spin, then the acceleration at a radius &quot;r&quot; is:

Notice the magnitude of this effect varies with the radius of rotation, which crewmembers might find inconvenient depending on the cabin design. Also, the effects of Coriolis force (a force imparted at right angles to motion within the cabin) must be dealt with. And there is concern that rotation could aggravate the effects of vestibular disruption.

== Space vehicle systems ==

=== Gemini, Mercury, and Apollo ===
American Mercury, Gemini and Apollo spacecraft contained 100% oxygen atmospheres, suitable for short duration missions, to minimize weight and complexity.

=== Space Shuttle ===
The Space Shuttle was the first American spacecraft to have an Earth-like atmospheric mixture, comprising 22% oxygen and 78% nitrogen. For the Space Shuttle, NASA includes in the ECLSS category systems that provide both life support for the crew and environmental control for payloads. The &quot;Shuttle Reference Manual&quot; contains ECLSS sections on: Crew Compartment Cabin Pressurization, Cabin Air Revitalization, Water Coolant Loop System, Active Thermal Control System, Supply and Waste Water, Waste Collection System, Waste Water Tank, Airlock Support, Extravehicular Mobility Units, Crew Altitude Protection System, and Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator Cooling and Gaseous Nitrogen Purge for Payloads.

=== Soyuz ===
The life-support system on the Soyuz spacecraft is called the Kompleks Sredstv Obespecheniya Zhiznideyatelnosti (KSOZh) (). Vostok, Voshkod and Soyuz contained air-like mixtures at approximately 101kPa (14.7 psi). The life support system provides a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures. The atmosphere is then regenerated through KO2 cylinders, which absorb most of the CO2 and water produced by the crew biologically and regenerates the oxygen, the LiOH cylinders then absorb the leftover CO2.

=== Plug and play ===
The Paragon Space Development Corporation is developing a plug and play ECLSS called &quot;commercial crew transport-air revitalization system&quot; (CCT-ARS) for future spacecraft partially paid for using NASA&#x27;s Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) funding.

The CCT-ARS provides seven primary spacecraft life support functions in a highly integrated and reliable system: Air temperature control, Humidity removal, Carbon dioxide removal, Trace contaminant removal, Post-fire atmospheric recovery, Air filtration, and Cabin air circulation.

== Space station systems ==
Space station systems include technology that enables humans to live in outer space for a prolonged period of time. Such technology includes filtration systems for human waste disposal and air production.

=== Skylab ===
Skylab used 72% oxygen and 28% nitrogen at a total pressure of 5 psi.

=== Salyut and Mir ===
The Salyut and Mir space stations contained an air-like Oxygen and Nitrogen mixture at approximately sea-level pressures of 93.1 kPa (13.5psi) to 129 kPa (18.8 psi) with an Oxygen content of 21% to 40%.

=== Bigelow commercial space station ===
The life-support system for the Bigelow Commercial Space Station is being designed by Bigelow Aerospace in Las Vegas, Nevada. The space station will be constructed of habitable Sundancer and BA 330 expandable spacecraft modules. &quot;human-in-the-loop testing of the environmental control and life-support system (ECLSS)&quot; for &quot;Sundancer&quot; has begun.

== Natural systems ==
Natural LSS like the Biosphere 2 in Arizona have been tested for future space travel or colonization. These systems are also known as closed ecological systems. They have the advantage of using solar energy as primary energy only and being independent from logistical support with fuel. Natural systems have the highest degree of efficiency due to integration of multiple functions. They also provide the proper ambience for humans which is necessary for a longer stay in outer space.

== Underwater and saturation diving habitats ==

Underwater habitats and surface saturation accommodation facilities provide life-support for their occupants over periods of days to weeks. The occupants are constrained from immediate return to surface atmospheric pressure by decompression obligations of up to several weeks.

The life support system of a surface saturation accommodation facility provides breathing gas and other services to support life for the personnel under pressure. It includes the following components: Underwater habitats differ in that the ambient external pressure is the same as internal pressure, so some engineering problems are simplified.
*Gas compression, mixing and storage facilities
*Chamber climate control system – control of temperature and humidity, and filtration of gas
*Instrumentation, control, monitoring and communications equipment
*Fire suppression systems
*Sanitation systems

Underwater habitats balance internal pressure with the ambient external pressure, allowing the occupants free access to the ambient environment within a specific depth range, while saturation divers accommodated in surface systems are transferred under pressure to the working depth in a closed diving bell

The life support system for the bell provides and monitors the main supply of breathing gas, and the control station monitors the deployment and communications with the divers. Primary gas supply, power and communications to the bell are through a bell umbilical, made up from a number of hoses and electrical cables twisted together and deployed as a unit. This is extended to the divers through the diver umbilicals.

The accommodation life support system maintains the chamber environment within the acceptable range for health and comfort of the occupants. Temperature, humidity, breathing gas quality sanitation systems and equipment function are monitored and controlled.

== Experimental life-support systems ==

=== MELiSSA ===
Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative (MELiSSA) is a European Space Agency led initiative, conceived as a micro-organisms and higher plants based ecosystem intended as a tool to gain understanding of the behaviour of artificial ecosystems, and for the development of the technology for a future regenerative life-support system for long term crewed space missions.

=== CyBLiSS ===
CyBLiSS (&quot;Cyanobacterium-Based Life Support Systems&quot;) is a concept developed by researchers from several space agencies (NASA, the German Aerospace Center and the Italian Space Agency) which would use cyanobacteria to process resources available on Mars directly into useful products, and into substrates for other key organisms of Bioregenerative life support system (BLSS). The goal is to make future human-occupied outposts on Mars as independent of Earth as possible (explorers living &quot;off the land&quot;), to reduce mission costs and increase safety. Even though developed independently, CyBLiSS would be complementary to other BLSS projects (such as MELiSSA) as it can connect them to materials found on Mars, thereby making them sustainable and expandable there. Instead of relying on a closed loop, new elements found on site can be brought into the system.

<text>The guqin (; ) is a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument. It has been played since ancient times, and has traditionally been favoured by scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement, as highlighted by the quote &quot;a gentleman does not part with his &quot;qin&quot; or &quot;se&quot; without good reason,&quot; as well as being associated with the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius. It is sometimes referred to by the Chinese as &quot;the father of Chinese music&quot; or &quot;the instrument of the sages&quot;. The &quot;guqin&quot; is not to be confused with the &quot;guzheng&quot;, another Chinese long stringed instrument also without frets, but with moveable bridges under each string.

Traditionally, the instrument was simply referred to as the &quot;&quot;qin&quot; (琴) but by the twentieth century the term had come to be applied to many other musical instruments as well: the &quot;yangqin&quot; hammered dulcimer, the &quot;huqin&quot; family of bowed string instruments, and the Western piano (&quot;gangqin&quot; (钢琴)) and violin (&quot;xiaotiqin&quot; (小提琴)) are examples of this usage. The prefix &quot;gu-&quot;&quot; (古; meaning &quot;ancient&quot;) was later added for clarification. Thus, the instrument is called &quot;guqin&quot; today. It can also be called &quot;qixian-qin&quot; (七絃琴; lit. &quot;seven-stringed qin&quot;). Because Robert Hans van Gulik&#x27;s book about the qin is called &quot;The Lore of the Chinese Lute&quot;, the guqin is sometimes inaccurately called a lute. Other incorrect classifications, mainly from music compact discs, include &quot;harp&quot; or &quot;table-harp&quot;.

The guqin is a very quiet instrument, with a range of about four octaves, and its open strings are tuned in the bass register. Its lowest pitch is about two octaves below middle C, or the lowest note on the cello. Sounds are produced by open strings, stopped strings, and harmonics. The use of glissando—sliding tones—gives it a sound reminiscent of a pizzicato cello, fretless double bass or a slide guitar. The qin has 13 &quot;hui&quot;, which represent the different position in one string. Pressing different &quot;hui&quot; produces different sound keys. The qin is also capable of many harmonics, of which 91 are most commonly used and indicated by the dotted positions. By tradition, the qin originally had five strings, which represent gong, shang, jue, zhi, yu in the ancient Chinese music system, but ancient qin-like instruments with only one string or more strings have been found. The modern form has been stabilized to seven strings.

There are more than 3,360 known surviving pieces of guqin music from ancient and imperial periods. On 7 November 2003, UNESCO announced that the Chinese guqin was selected as an Intangible World Cultural Heritage. In 2006, guqin was listed in the List of National Non-material Cultural Heritage in China. In 2010, a Song period guqin was sold for $22 million, making it the most expensive musical instrument ever sold.

==History==

Legend has it that the qin, the most revered of all Chinese musical instruments, has a history of about 5,000 years, and that the legendary figures of China&#x27;s pre-history – Fuxi, Shennong and Huang Di, the &quot;Yellow Emperor&quot; – were involved in its creation. Nearly all qin books and tablature collections published prior to the twentieth century state this as the actual origins of the qin, although this is now viewed as mythology. It is mentioned in Chinese writings dating back nearly 3,000 years, and examples have been found in tombs from about 2,500 years ago. The exact origins of the qin is still a very much continuing subject of debate over the past few decades.

In 1977, a recording of &quot;Flowing Water&quot; (&quot;Liu Shui&quot;, as performed by Guan Pinghu, one of the best qin players of the 20th century) was chosen to be included in the Voyager Golden Record, a gold-plated LP recording containing music from around the world, which was sent into outer space by NASA on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft. It is the second-longest excerpt included on the disc. The reason to select a work played on this specific instrument is because the tonal structure of the instrument, its musical scale, is derived from fundamental physical laws related to vibration and overtones, representing the intellectual capacity of human beings on this subject. In 2003, guqin music was proclaimed as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.

==Schools, societies and players==
As with any other musical tradition, there are differences in ideals and interaction between different people. Therefore, there exist different schools and societies which transmit these different ideas and artistic traditions.

===Historical schools===

Many qin schools known as &quot;qin pai&quot; developed over the centuries. Such schools generally formed around areas where qin activity was greatest.

Some schools have come and gone, and some have offshoots (such as the Mei&#x27;an school, a Zhucheng school offshoot). Often, the school is originated from a single person, such as the Wu school which is named after the late Wu Zhaoji. The style can vary considerably between schools; some are very similar, yet others are very distinct. The differences are often in the interpretation of the music. Northern schools tend to be more vigorous in technique than Southern schools. But in modern terms, the distinction between schools and styles is often blurred because a single player may learn from many different players from different schools and absorb each of their styles. This is especially so for conservatory trained players. People from the same school trained under the same master may have different individual styles (such as Zhang Ziqian and Liu Shaochun of the Guangling school).

===Guqin societies===
There is a difference between qin schools and qin societies. The former concerns itself with transmission of a style, the latter concerns itself with performance. The qin society will encourage meetings with fellow qin players in order to play music and maybe discuss the nature of the qin. A gathering like this is called a &quot;yaji&quot; (, literally &quot;elegant gathering&quot;), and takes place once every month or two. Sometimes, societies may go on excursions to places of natural beauty to play qin, or attend conferences. They may also participate in competitions or research. Societies do not need strict structure to adhere to; they can operate on a leisurely basis. The main purpose of qin societies is to promote and play qin music. They create opportunities to network and learn to play the instrument, to ask questions and to receive answers.

===Players===
Many artists down through the ages have played the instrument, and the instrument was a favourite of scholars. Certain melodies are also associated with famous figures, such as Confucius and Qu Yuan. Some emperors of China also had a liking to the qin, including the Song dynasty emperor, Huizong, as clearly seen in his own painting of himself playing the qin in &quot;Ting Qin Tu&quot;.

The classical collections such as &quot;Qin Shi&quot;, &quot;Qinshi Bu&quot; and &quot;Qinshi Xu&quot; include biographies of hundreds more players.

====Contemporary====
Contemporary qin players extend from the early twentieth century to the present. More so than in the past, such players tend to have many different pursuits and occupations other than qin playing. There are only a few players who are paid to exclusively play and research the guqin professionally and nothing else. Qin players can also be well-versed in other cultural pursuits, such as the arts. Or they can do independent research on music subjects. Often, players may play other instruments (not necessarily Chinese) and give recitals or talks.

==Performance==
During the performance of qin, musicians may use a variety of techniques to reach the full expressing potential of the instrument. There are many special tablatures that had developed over the centuries specifically dedicated to qin for their reference and a repertoire of popular and ancient tunes for their choice.

===Playing technique===
The tones of qin can be categorized as three characteristic &quot;sounds&quot;. The first type is &quot;san yin&quot; (), which literally means &quot;unfettered sound&quot;. It&#x27;s the fundamental frequency produced by plucking a free string with the fingers of the right hand. The second type, made by plucking a string with the right hand and gently tapping specific note positions on the string with the left hand, will create a crisp sound named &quot;fan yin&quot; (, lit. &quot;floating sound&quot;) or overtone harmonics (the equivalent technique in Western music is the string harmonic or &quot;flageolet&quot;). Important scale notes, called &quot;hui&quot; (), are marked by 13 glossy white dots made of mica or seashell inset in the front surface of the qin, occur at integer divisions of the string length. The &quot;crystal concordant&quot; (perfectly harmonic) overtones can only be evoked by tapping the strings precisely at these &quot;hui&quot;. The third type is &quot;an yin&quot; (/, lit. &quot;pressed sound&quot;), which is sometimes also called &quot;shi yin&quot; (音, lit. &quot;full sound&quot;) or &quot;zou yin&quot; (音, lit. &quot;changing sound&quot;). These comprise the major cadences of most qin pieces. To play &quot;an yin&quot;, the musician stops a string at a specific pitch on the board surface with the left thumb, middle or ring finger, strikes the string with the right hand, then they may slide the left hand up and down to vary the note. This technique is similar to playing a slide guitar across the player&#x27;s lap. However, the manipulation of qin is much more multifarious than that of a guitar, which has only around 3 or 4 main techniques. (). According to the book &quot;Cunjian Guqin Zhifa Puzi Jilan&quot;, there are around 1,070 different finger techniques used for the qin. Thus the qin is possibly the instrument with the most playing techniques in both the Chinese and Western instrument families. Most of the qin&#x27;s techniques are obsolete, but around 50 of them still appear in modern performance. Sometimes, guqin can be played with a violin bow. It has a tone similar to that of a cello, but raspier.

The above four figures are from an old handbook.

===Tablature and notation===


Written qin music did not directly tell what notes were played; instead, it was written in a tablature detailing tuning, finger positions, and stroke technique, thus comprising a step by step method and description of how to play a piece. Some tablatures do indicate notes using the gongche system, or indicate rhythm using s. The earliest example of the modern shorthand tablature survives from around the twelfth century CE. An earlier form of music notation from the Tang era survives in just one manuscript, dated to the seventh century CE, called &quot;Jieshi Diao Youlan&quot; (&quot;Solitary Orchid in Stone Tablet Mode&quot;). It is written in a longhand form called &quot;wenzi pu&quot; ( 譜) (literally &quot;written notation&quot;), said to have been created by Yong Menzhou during the Warring States period, which gives all the details using ordinary written Chinese characters. Later in the Tang dynasty, Cao Rou and others simplified the notation, using only the important elements of the characters (like string number, plucking technique, &quot;hui&quot; number and which finger to stop the string) and combined them into one character notation. This meant that instead of having two lines of written text to describe a few notes, a single character could represent one note, or sometimes as many as nine. This notation form was called &quot;jianzi pu&quot; (字譜) (literally &quot;reduced notation&quot;) and it was a major advance in qin notation. It was so successful that from the Ming dynasty onwards, a great many qinpu (琴) (qin tablature collections) appeared, the most famous and useful being &quot;Shenqi Mipu&quot; (The Mysterious and Marvellous Tablature) compiled by Zhu Quan, the 17th son of the founder of the Ming dynasty. In the 1960s, Zha Fuxi discovered more than 130 qinpu that contain well over 3360 pieces of written music. However, many qinpu compiled before the Ming dynasty are now lost, and many pieces have remained unplayed for hundreds of years.

===Repertoire===
Qin pieces are usually around three to eight minutes in length, with the longest being &quot;Guangling San&quot;, which is 22 minutes long. Other famous pieces include &quot;Liu Shui&quot; (Flowing Water), &quot;Yangguan San Die&quot; (Three Refrains on the Yang Pass Theme), &quot;Meihua San Nong&quot; (Three Variations on the Plum Blossom Theme), &quot;Xiao Xiang Shui Yun&quot; (Mist and Clouds over the Xiao and Xiang Rivers), and &quot;Pingsha Luo Yan&quot; (Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank). The average player will generally have a repertoire of around ten pieces which they will aim to play very well, learning new pieces as and when they feel like it or if the opportunity arises. Players mainly learn popular well-transcribed versions, often using a recording as a reference. In addition to learning to play established or ancient pieces very well, highly skilled qin players may also compose or improvise, although the player must be very good and extremely familiar with the instrument to do this successfully. A number of qin melodies are program music depicting the natural world.

====Transcription====
Dapu (打譜) is the transcribing of old tablature into a playable form. Since qin tablature does not indicate note value, tempo or rhythm, the player must work it out for themselves. Normally, qin players will learn the rhythm of a piece through a teacher or master. They sit facing one another, with the student copying the master. The tablature will only be consulted if the teacher is not sure of how to play a certain part. Because of this, traditional qinpu do not indicate them (though near the end of the Qing dynasty, a handful of qinpu had started to employ various rhythm indicating devices, such as dots). If one did not have a teacher, then one had to work out the rhythm by themselves. But it would be a mistake to assume that qin music is devoid of rhythm and melody. By the 20th century, there had been attempts to try to replace the &quot;jianzi pu&quot; notation, but so far, it has been unsuccessful; since the 20th century, qin music is generally printed with staff notation above the qin tablature. Because qin tablature is so useful, logical, easy, and the fastest way (once the performer knows how to read the notation) of learning a piece, it is invaluable to the qin player and cannot totally be replaced (just as staff notation cannot be replaced for Western instruments, because they developed a notation system that suited the instruments well).

There is a saying that goes &quot;a short piece requires three months [of dapu to complete], and a long piece requires three years&quot;. In actual practice, it needn&#x27;t be that long to dapu a piece, but suggests that the player will have not only memorised the piece off by heart, but also have their fingering, rhythm and timing corrected. And afterwards, the emotion must be put into the piece. Therefore, it could be said that it really does require three months or years to finish dapu of a piece in order for them to play it to a very high standard.

====Rhythm in qin music====
It has already been discussed that qin music has a rhythm and that it is only vaguely indicated in the tablature. Though there is an amount of guesswork involved, the tablature has clues to indicate rhythm, such as repeating motifs, an indication of phrases or how the notation is arranged. Throughout the history of the qinpu, we see many attempts to indicate this rhythm more explicitly, involving devices like dots to make beats. Probably, one of the major projects to regulate the rhythm to a large scale was the compilers of the &quot;Qinxue Congshu&quot; tablature collection of the 1910s to 1930s. The construction of the written tablature was divided into two columns. The first was further divided into about three lines of a grid, each line indicating a varied combination of lyrics, gongche tablature, se tablature, pitch, and/or beats depending on the score used. The second column was devoted to qin tablature.

Western composers have noticed that the rhythm in a piece of qin music can change; once they seem to have got a beat, the beats change. This is due to the fact that qin players may use some free rhythm in their playing. Whatever beat they use will depend on the emotion or the feeling of the player, and how they interpret the piece. However, some melodies have sections of fixed rhythm which are played the same way generally. The main theme of &quot;Meihua Sannong&quot;, for example, uses this. Some sections of certain melodies require the player to play faster with force to express the emotion of the piece. Examples include the middle sections of &quot;Guangling San&quot; and &quot;Xiaoxiang Shuiyun&quot;. Other pieces, such as &quot;Jiu Kuang&quot; has a fixed rhythm throughout the entire piece.

==Organology==

While acoustics dictated the general form and construction of the guqin, its external form could and did take on a huge amount of variation, whether it be from the embellishments or even the basic structure of the instrument. Qin tablatures from the Song era onwards have catalogued a plethora of qin forms. All, however, obey very basic rules of acoustics and symbolism of form. The qin uses strings of silk or metal-nylon and is tuned in accordance to traditional principles.

Ancient guqins were made of little more than wood and strings of twisted silk. Ornaments included inlaid dots of mother-of-pearl or other similar materials. Traditionally, the sound board was made of Chinese parasol wood firmiana simplex, its rounded shape symbolising the heavens. The bottom was made of Chinese Catalpa, &quot;Catalpa ovata&quot;, its flat shape symbolising earth. Modern instruments are most frequently made of Cunninghamia or other similar timbers. The traditional finish is of raw lacquer mixed with powdered deer horn, and the finishing process could take months of curing to complete. The finish develops cracks over time, and these cracks are believed to improve the instrument&#x27;s sound as the wood and lacquer release tension. An antique guqin&#x27;s age can be determined by this snake like crack pattern called &quot;duanwen&quot; (斷紋).

===Construction===
According to tradition, the qin originally had five strings, representing the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire and earth. Later, in the Zhou dynasty, Zhou Wen Wang added a sixth string to mourn his son, Boyikao. His successor, Zhou Wu Wang, added a seventh string to motivate his troops into battle with the Shang. The thirteen &quot;hui&quot; on the surface represent the 13 months of the year (the extra 13th is the &#x27;leap month&#x27; in the lunar calendar). The surface board is round to represent Heaven and the bottom board flat to represent the earth. The entire length of the qin (in Chinese measurements) is 3 &quot;chi&quot;, 6 &quot;cun&quot; and 5 &quot;fen&quot;; representing the 365 days of the year (though this is just a standard since qins can be shorter or longer depending on the period&#x27;s measurement standard or the maker&#x27;s preference). Each part of the qin has meaning, some more obvious, like &quot;dragon pool&quot; and &quot;phoenix pond&quot;.

===Strings===
Until recently, the guqin&#x27;s strings were always made of various thicknesses of twisted silk, but since then most players use modern nylon-flatwound steel strings. This was partly due to the scarcity of high-quality silk strings and partly due to the newer strings&#x27; greater durability and louder tone.

Silk strings are made by gathering a prescribed number of strands of silk thread, then twisting them tightly together. The twisted cord of strings is then wrapped around a frame and immersed in a vat of liquid composed of a special mixture of natural glue that binds the strands together. The strings are taken out and left to dry, before being cut into the appropriate length. The top thicker strings (i.e. strings one to four) are further wrapped in a thin silk thread, coiled around the core to make it smoother. According to ancient manuals, there are three distinctive gauges of thickness that one can make the strings. The first is &quot;taigu&quot; [Great Antiquity] which is the standard gauge, the &quot;zhongqing&quot; [Middle Clarity] is thinner, whilst the &quot;jiazhong&quot; [Added Thickness] is thicker. According to the &quot;Yugu Zhai Qinpu&quot;, &quot;zhongqing&quot; is the best. The currently used silk string gauge standard was defined by Suzhou silk string maker Pan Guohui (潘國輝).

Although most contemporary players use nylon-wrapped metal strings, some argue that nylon-wrapped metal strings cannot replace silk strings for their refinement of tone. Additionally, nylon-wrapped metal strings can cause damage to the wood of old qins. Many traditionalists feel that the sound of the fingers of the left hand sliding on the strings to be a distinctive feature of qin music. The modern nylon-wrapped metal strings were very smooth in the past, but are now slightly modified in order to capture these sliding sounds.

Around 2007, a new type of strings were produced made of mostly a nylon core coiled with nylon like the metal-nylon strings, possibly in imitation of Western catgut strings. The sound is similar to the metal-nylon strings but without the metallic tone to them (one of the main reasons why traditionalists do not like the metal-nylon strings). The nylon strings can be tuned to standard pitch without breaking and can sustain their tuning whatever the climate, unlike silk. The strings have various names in China, but they are advertised as sounding like silk strings prior to the 1950s, when silk string production stopped.

Traditionally, the strings were wrapped around the goose feet, but a device has been invented, which is a block of wood attached to the goose feet, with pins similar to those used to tune the guzheng protruding out at the sides, so one can string and tune the qin using a tuning wrench.

==Tuning==

To string a guqin, one traditionally had to tie a fly&#x27;s head knot (&quot;yingtou jie&quot;) at one end of the string, and slip the string through the twisted cord (&quot;rongkou&quot;) which goes into holes at the head of the qin and then out the bottom through the tuning pegs (&quot;zhen&quot;). The string is dragged over the bridge (&quot;yueshan&quot; 『岳山』), across the surface board, over the nut (&quot;longyin&quot; dragon gums) to the back of the qin, where the end is wrapped around one of two legs (&quot;fengzu&quot; &quot;phoenix feet&quot; or &quot;yanzu&quot; &quot;geese feet&quot;). Afterwards, the strings are fine-tuned using the tuning pegs (sometimes, rosin is used on the part of the tuning peg that touches the qin body to stop it from slipping, especially if the qin is tuned to higher pitches). The most common tuning, &quot;zheng diao&quot; 〈正調〉, is pentatonic: 5 6 1 2 3 5 6 (which can be also played as 1 2 4 5 6 1 2) in the traditional Chinese number system or jianpu (i.e. 1=do, 2=re, etc.). Today this is generally interpreted to mean C D F G A c d, but this should be considered sol la do re mi sol la, since historically the qin was not tuned to absolute pitch. Other tunings are achieved by adjusting the tension of the strings using the tuning pegs at the head end. Thus &quot;manjiao diao&quot; (&quot;slackened third string&quot;) gives 1 2 3 5 6 1 2 and &quot;ruibin diao&quot; (&quot;raised fifth string&quot;) gives 1 2 4 5 7 1 2, which is transposed to 2 3 5 6 1 2 3.

==Playing context==

The guqin is nearly always played as a solo instrument since its quietness of tone means that it cannot compete with the sounds of most other instruments or an ensemble. It can, however, be played together with a &quot;xiao&quot; (end-blown bamboo flute), with other qin, or played while singing. In old times, the &quot;se&quot; (a long zither with movable bridges and 25 strings) was frequently used in duets with the qin. However, the &quot;se&quot; has not survived, though duet tablature scores for the instruments are preserved in a few &quot;qinpu&quot;, and the master qin player Wu Jinglüe was one of only a few in the twentieth century who knew how to play it together with qin in duet. Lately there has been a trend to use other instruments to accompany the qin, such as the &quot;xun&quot; (ceramic ocarina), &quot;pipa&quot; (four-stringed pear-shaped lute), &quot;dizi&quot; (transverse bamboo flute), and others for more experimental purposes.

In order for an instrument to accompany the qin, its sound must be mellow and not overwhelm the qin. Thus, the &quot;xiao&quot; generally used for this purpose is one pitched in the key of F, known as &quot;qin xiao&quot; 「琴簫」, which is narrower than an ordinary &quot;xiao&quot;. If one sings to qin songs (which is rare nowadays) then one should not sing in an operatic or folk style as is common in China, but rather in a very low pitched and deep way; and the range in which one should sing should not exceed one and a half octaves. The style of singing is similar to that used to recite Tang poetry. In order fully to appreciate qin songs, one needs to become accustomed to the eccentric singing style adopted by certain players of the instrument, such as Zha Fuxi.

Traditionally, the qin was played in a quiet studio or room by oneself, or with a few friends; or played outdoors in places of outstanding natural beauty. Nowadays, many qin players perform at concerts in large concert halls, almost always, out of necessity, using electronic pickups or microphones to amplify the sound. Many qin players attend yajis, at which a number of qin players, music lovers, or anyone with an interest in Chinese culture can come along to discuss and play the qin. In fact, the yaji originated as a multi-media gathering involving the four arts: qin, Go, calligraphy, and painting.

===Ritual use of the qin===

Being an instrument associated with scholars, the guqin was also played in a ritual context, especially in &quot;yayue&quot; in China, and &quot;aak&quot; in Korea.

The National Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts continues to perform Munmyo jeryeak (Confucian ritual music), using the last two surviving &quot;aak&quot; melodies from the importation of yayue from the Song dynasty emperor Huizong in 1116, including in the ensemble the &quot;seul&quot; (se) and &quot;geum&quot; (금; qin). The Korean &quot;geum&quot; used in this context has evolved to be slightly different when compared to the normal &quot;qin&quot; in that there are 14 instead of 13 &quot;hui&quot; and that they are not placed correctly according to the harmonic positions besides other different construction features. The finger techniques are more closer to &quot;gayageum&quot; technique than it is to the complex ones of the qin. As the qin never gained a following in Korean society, the ritual &quot;geum&quot; became the fossilised form of it and to all intents and purposes unplayable for a qin player. The Korean scholars never adopted the qin but instead created their own instrument, the &quot;geomungo&quot; (玄琴), which adopted much of the qin&#x27;s lore and aesthetics and essentially taking the qin&#x27;s place as the scholars&#x27; instrument.

In China, the qin was still in use in ritual ceremonies of the imperial court, such can be seen in the court paintings of imperial sacrifices of the Qing court (e.g. &quot;The Yongzheng Emperor Offering Sacrifices at the Altar of the God of Agriculture&quot;, 1723–35). The qin also have many variations with a different number of strings, such as during Song Taizong&#x27;s reign, but these variations never survived the changes of dynasty and so today the normal qin is used.

In Japan, the qin was never adopted into ritual music, but for a time in the late Edo period the qin was adopted by some scholars and Buddhist monks. The guqin was later adjusted and adopted into general Japanese folk music as the Koto (琴).

===Qin aesthetics===
When the qin is played, a number of aesthetic elements are involved. The first is musicality. In the second section of &quot;Pingsha Luoyan&quot;, for example, the initial few bars contain a &quot;nao&quot; vibrato followed by a phase of sliding up and down the string, even when the sound has already become inaudible (). The average person trained in music may question whether this is really &quot;music&quot;. Normally, some players would pluck the string very lightly to create a very quiet sound. For some players, this plucking isn&#x27;t necessary. Instead of trying to force a sound out of the strings one should allow the strings to emit the sounds to which they are naturally predisposed. Some players say that the sliding on the string even when the sound has disappeared is a distinctive feature in qin music. It creates a &quot;space&quot; or &quot;void&quot; in a piece, playing without playing, sound without sound. In fact, when the viewer looks at the player sliding on the string without sounds, the viewer automatically &quot;fills in the notes&quot; with their minds. This creates a connection between player, instrument and listener. This, of course, cannot happen when listening to a recording, as one cannot see the performer. It can also be seen as impractical in recording, as the player would want to convey sound as much as possible towards a third audience. But in fact, there is sound, the sound coming from the fingers sliding on the string. With a really good qin, silk strings, and a perfectly quiet environment, all the tones can be sounded. Since the music is more player-oriented than listener oriented, and the player knows the music, he/she can hear it even if the sound is not there. With silk strings, the sliding sound might be called the qi or &quot;life force&quot; of the music. The really empty sounds are the pauses between notes. However, if one cannot create a sound that can be heard when sliding on a string, it is generally acceptable to lightly pluck the string to create a very quiet sound.

==In popular culture==

As a symbol of high culture, the qin continually appears in many forms of Chinese popular culture to varying degrees of accuracy. References are made to the qin in a variety of media including TV episodes and films. Actors often possess limited knowledge on how to play the instrument and instead, they mime it to a pre-recorded piece by a Qin player. Sometimes the music is erroneously mimed to guzheng music, rather than qin music. A more faithful representation of the qin is in the Zhang Yimou film &quot;Hero&quot;, in which Xu Kuanghua plays an ancient version of the qin in the courtyard scene while Nameless and Long Sky fight at a Xiangqi parlour. It mimed the music played by Liu Li, formerly a professor at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. It is suggested that Xu made the qin himself.

The qin was also featured in the 2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony in Beijing, played by Chen Leiji (陳雷激).

The qin is also used in many classical Chinese novels, such as Cao Xueqin&#x27;s &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; and various others.

The qin is also used in many contemporary Chinese novels, notably the 2016 novel &quot;Mo Dao Zu Shi&quot;, as well as the 2019 live-action series adaptation, &quot;The Untamed&quot;, in which the qin is used as a spiritual tool of protagonist Lan Wangji. Behind-the-scenes footage of the production of the series revealed that several actors were given qin lessons prior to filming to prepare them for their roles as characters that played the instrument.

==Electric guqin==
The electric guqin was first developed in the late 20th century by adding electric guitar–style magnetic pickups to a regular acoustic guqin, allowing the instrument to be amplified through an instrument amplifier or PA system.

==Related instruments==
The Japanese ichigenkin, a monochord zither, is believed to be derived from the qin. The qin handbook &quot;Lixing Yuanya&quot; (1618) includes some melodies for a one-string qin, and the &quot;Wuzhi Zhai Qinpu&quot; contains a picture and description of such an instrument. The modern ichigenkin apparently first appeared in Japan just after that time. However, the &quot;honkyoku&quot; (standard repertoire) of the ichigenkin today most closely resembles that of the shamisen.

The Korean &quot;geomungo&quot; may also be related, albeit distantly. Korean literati wanted to play an instrument the way their Chinese counterparts played the qin. The repertoire was largely the &quot;geomungo&quot; parts for melodies played by the court orchestra.

<doc id="897148" wikidata="Q726303" url="?curid=897148" title="Guzheng">
<text>The zheng (), or guzheng (), is a Chinese plucked zither. The modern guzheng commonly has 21, 25, or 26 strings, is long, and is tuned in a major pentatonic scale. It has a large, resonant soundboard made from &quot;Paulownia&quot; wood. Other components are often made from other woods for structural or decorative reasons. Guzheng players often wear a fingerpick made from materials such as plastic, resin, tortoiseshell, or ivory on one or both hands.

It can have nylon steel strings, steel strings, silk strings, etc., depending on the genre. The most common guzheng has 21 strings. The high-pitched strings of the guzheng are close to the player, and the low-pitched strings are on the opposite side. The strings&#x27; order from the inside to the outside is 1 to 21.

The guzheng is ancestral to several other Asian zithers such as the Japanese koto, the Korean gayageum and ajaeng, Mongolian yatga, the Vietnamese đàn tranh, the Sundanese kacapi, and the Kazakhstan jetigen. The guzheng should not be confused with the guqin, a Chinese zither with seven strings played without moveable bridges.

The guzheng has undergone many changes during its long history. The oldest specimen yet discovered held 13 strings and was dated to possibly the Warring States period (475–221 BCE). The guzheng became prominent during the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE). By the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE), the guzheng was perhaps the most commonly played instrument in China. The guzheng is played throughout all of China with a variety of different techniques, depending on the region of China and the time period. It has a light timbre, broad range, rich performance skills, and strong expressive power, and it has been deeply loved by many Chinese people throughout history.

==Origin==
The guzheng has various accounts for its origin. An early guzheng-like instrument is said to have been invented by Meng Tian, a general of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), largely influenced by the se. The guzheng was originally developed as a bamboo-tube zither as recorded in the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;, which was later replaced by larger curved wooden boards with movable bridges. A third legend says the guzheng came about when two people fought over a 25-string se. They broke it in half, one person receiving a 12-string part and another the 13-string part.

Strings were once made of silk. During the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) the strings transitioned to only wires such as brass. Modern strings are almost always steel coated in nylon. First introduced in the 1970s, these multi-material strings increased the instrument&#x27;s volume while maintaining an acceptable timbre.

The guzheng is often decorated. Artists create unique cultural and artistic content on the instrument. Decorations include carved art, carved lacquer, straw, mother-of-pearl inlays, painting, poetry, calligraphy, shell carving (jade), and cloisonné.

Guzheng music has similarity with folk songs, it is developed on the basis of people&#x27;s life. Through the performance of performers, it reflects the production and life of people at that time.

==Styles and techniques==
The guzheng is plucked by the fingers with or without plectra. Interestingly, among the 21 strings of Guzheng, although no strings are specifically assigned to play F or B, those pitches can be produced by pressing E and A instead, respectively. Most modern players use plectra that are attached to up to four fingers on each hand. Ancient picks were made of mundane materials such as bamboo, bone, and animal teeth or by finer materials such as ivory, tortoiseshell, and jade.

Traditional playing styles use the right hand to pluck notes and the left hand to add ornamentation such as pitch slides and vibrato by pressing the strings to the left of the movable bridges. Modern styles use both hands to play on the right side of the strings. There are many techniques used to strike notes. One iconic sound is a tremolo produced by the right thumb rotating rapidly around the same note. Other guzheng techniques include harmonics (&quot;Fanyin&quot;) where one plucks a string while tapping it at the same time, producing a note in a higher octave.

Many guzheng techniques have been borrowed from other instruments. For example, &quot;Lun&quot; is a borrowed technique. In &quot;Lun&quot;, all five fingers pluck on a string to produce a tremolo sound similar to the Pipa.

Techniques can also vary in Northern and Southern China, producing different sounds and styles.

=== Northern China ===
Northern styles include songs from the Shandong and Henan regional schools.

Songs from Shandong include &quot;High Mountain and Flowing Water [Shandong Version]&quot; (&quot;Gao Shan Liu Shui&quot;) and &quot;Autumn Moon Over the Han Palace&quot; (&quot;Han Gong Qiu Yue&quot;). Songs from Henan include &quot;High Mountain and Flowing Water [Henan Version]&quot; and &quot;Going Upstairs&quot; (&quot;Shang Lou&quot;).

According to Samuel Wong, songs from Henan are fiery. Left hand slides and vibrato are used frequently and tremolo is done with the thumb. Meanwhile, Shandong songs are &quot;glamorous ... melodic lines often rise and fall dramatically ... Its music is characteristically light and refreshing.&quot;”&quot; Slide descending notes are not used as often as Henan. Glissandos are always on beat.

=== Southern China ===
Southern styles include Chaozhou and Kejia (Hakka) regional styles. Another prominent school is the Zhejiang regional school in the southeast.

Southern songs include &quot;&quot;&quot;Jackdaw Plays with Water&quot; (&quot;Han Ya Xi Shui)&quot; from Chaozhou and &quot;Lotus Emerging from Water&quot; (&quot;Chu Shui Lian&quot;) from the Hakka School. Famous songs from Zhejiang include &quot;The General&#x27;s Command&quot; (&quot;Jiang Jun Ling&quot;).

Chaozhou and Hakka songs are similar but according to Mei Han, “Hakka melodies are similar to but less highly embellished than those of the neighboring Chaozhou school.” Songs from Chaozhou use even less descending notes and glissando are free rhythm. Chaozhou songs have &quot;irregular beats, and alternate between hard and soft taps on the strings.&quot; Zhejiang songs use technique similar to the Pipa. Frequent tremolo is used with left-hand glissando. Other techniques include &quot;sidian&quot;, where 16th notes are played used thumb, index finger and middle finger in quick tempo.

The guzheng is played on a pentatonic scale, with notes &quot;fa&quot; and &quot;ti&quot; being produced by bending the strings. The scale can change with using &quot;flat&quot;, &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;sharp&quot; notes. Chaozhou songs use multiple scales, using both &quot;flat&quot; notes or both &quot;natural&quot; notes. The tone of the song can change based on the scale.

=== Modern music ===

Many pieces composed since the 1950s have used newer techniques and also mix elements from both northern and southern styles, ultimately creating a new modern school. Examples of modern songs include &quot;Spring on Snowy Mountain&quot; (&quot;Xue Shan Chun Xiao&quot;) by Fan Shang E, and &quot;Fighting the Typhoon&quot; (&quot;Zhan Tai Feng&quot;) by Wang Changyuan.

Newer techniques (especially since the 1950s) have included playing harmony and counterpoint with the left hand.

Experimental, atonal pieces have been composed since the 1980s. For example, &quot;Ming Mountain&quot; (&quot;Ming Shan&quot;) and &quot;Gloomy Fragrance&quot; (&quot;An Xiang&quot;) are contemporary songs that do not use the traditional pentatonic scale.

In 2021, Chinese/Australian guzheng composer and player Mindy Meng Wang collaborated with Australian electronic musician Tim Shiel, releasing a single, &quot;Hidden Qi 隐.气&quot;, in February, followed by an EP, &quot;Nervous Energy 一 触即发&quot;, in March of that year. She has previously collaborated with British band Gorillaz and Australian band Regurgitator, and intends to stay in Australia and continue to produce modern music.

==Notable people==
Notable 20th-century players and teachers include Wang Xunzhi (, 1899–1972), who popularized the Wulin &quot;zheng&quot; school based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang; Lou Shuhua, who rearranged a traditional &quot;guzheng&quot; piece and named it &quot;Yu Zhou Chang Wan&quot;; Liang Tsai-Ping (1911–2000), who edited the first &quot;guzheng&quot; manual (&quot;Nizheng Pu&quot;) in 1938; Cao Dongfu (1898–1970), from Henan; Gao Zicheng (born 1918) and Zhao Yuzhai (born 1924), both from Shandong; Su Wenxian (1907–1971); Guo Ying (born 1914) and Lin Maogen (born 1929), both from Chaozhou; the Hakka Luo Jiuxiang (1902–1978) and Cao Guifen and Cao Zheng (, 1920–1998), both of whom trained in the Henan school. The Cao family of Henan are known as masters of the &quot;guzheng&quot;.

Notable 21st-century Chinese &quot;guzheng&quot; players include Xiang Sihua, Wang Zhongshan, Chang Jing, Jing Xia, and Funa. Although most &quot;guzheng&quot; music is Chinese classical music, the American composer Lou Harrison (1917–2003) played and composed for the instrument. Contemporary &quot;guzheng&quot; works have also been written by non-Chinese composers such as Halim El-Dabh, Kevin Austin, David Vayo, Simon Steen-Andersen, and Jon Foreman.

Zhang Yan (张燕, 1945–1996) played the &quot;guzheng&quot;, performing and recording with Asian American jazz bandleader Jon Jang. Other musicians playing in non-traditional styles include Wu Fei, Xu Fengxia, Randy Raine-Reusch, Mohamed Faizal b. Mohamed Salim, Mei Han, Bei Bei He, Zi Lan Liao, Levi Chen, Andreas Vollenweider, Jaron Lanier, Mike Hovancsek, Chih-Lin Chou, Liu Le, David Sait. AND Moyun. Also, Koto player Brett Larner developed innovative works for the &quot;guzheng&quot; and played the instrument in a duet with electronic musician Samm Bennett on his CD &quot;Itadakimasu&quot;.

==In popular culture==

In the television drama series &quot;My Fair Princess&quot;, actress Ruby Lin&#x27;s character Xia Ziwei plays the &quot;guzheng&quot; (although she mimes to the music). It is featured in the 1980 pop hit, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got to Learn Sometime&quot;, by the Korgis.
In the film &quot;Kung Fu Hustle&quot;, the assassins known as The Harpists play a long zither to generate bladed and percussive attacks. The instrument has raised bridges like a guzheng but its body is shaped like a guqin. The sound is that of a guqin.

The &quot;guzheng&quot; has been used in rock music by Chinese performer Wang Yong of Cui Jian, the English musician Jakko Jakszyk (on the 2011 Jakszyk, Fripp &amp; Collins album &quot;A Scarcity of Miracles&quot;), J.B. Brubaker of August Burns Red on &quot;Creative Captivity&quot; from the 2013 album &quot;Rescue &amp; Restore&quot;, and the virtual band Gorillaz on &quot;Hong Kong&quot; (from the 2005 &quot;Help! A Day in the Life&quot; compilation). Jerusalem-based multi-instrumentalist Bradley Fish used the &quot;guzheng&quot; with a rock-influenced style and electronic effects on his 1996 collaboration &quot;The Aquarium Conspiracy&quot; (with Sugarcubes/Björk drummer Sigtryggur Baldursson), and is the most widely recorded artist of loops for the instrument. Mandopop singer-songwriter and music producer Lay Zhang is known for using traditional Chinese instruments such as the guzheng.

In the first book of the Remembrance of Earth&#x27;s Past trilogy by Liu Cixin, a military operation which sets up thin strands of nanomaterial across the Panama Canal in order to slice the incoming ship Judgment Day into slivers as it travels through the canal is codenamed Guzheng, referencing the resemblance of the strands of nanomaterial across the canal to the strings of the instrument.

<text>Douglas N. Davis (born September 21, 1975) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers, Toronto Blue Jays, Milwaukee Brewers, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Chicago Cubs.

==Youth==
Davis was born in Sacramento, California, and went to Northgate High School in Walnut Creek, California, where he played football and baseball. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers following his senior year in high school, but did not sign.

==College==
Davis attended Diablo Valley College after high school and played baseball. He later attended the City College of San Francisco, where he earned Second Team All-Conference honors as a pitcher in his junior season.

==Minor league career==
Davis was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 10th round of the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft. 

Davis began his minor league career for the Texas Rangers rookie league affiliate, the Gulf Coast Rangers, in 1996 where he went 3–1 with a 1.90 ERA in 8 games and 42 innings. In 1997 Davis started his season with the Gulf Coast Rangers going 3–1 with a 1.70 ERA in 4 games before being promoted to the High-A Charlotte Rangers where he spent the rest of 1998 and 1998, going 16–10 over that period.

In 1999, Davis began the season in AA Tulsa posting an impressive 2.42 ERA over 74 innings with a record of 4–4, which earned him a promotion to the AAA Oklahoma RedHawks where he finished the season with a 7–0 record, 3.00 ERA. Davis made his major league debut in 1999, and then spent time between AAA and the Major Leagues from 1999 to 2003 before becoming a full-time major league player, going 17–6 during that period.

==Major league career==

===Texas Rangers===
Davis made his MLB debut on August 9, 1999, for the Rangers, appearing in only 2 games. Davis pitched out of the bullpen for the majority of the season while also making 13 starts. He also threw a complete game against the Red Sox on August 21. Davis was inserted into the Rangers rotation, making 30 starts. He finished 11–10 in 186 innings.

Davis&#x27; 2002 season was cut short due to injury, managing to make just 10 starts for the Rangers. In 2003, Davis only made 1 start, pitching 3 innings while allowing 4 runs.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
Davis was claimed off waivers on April 30 by the Blue Jays. He started 11 games for them, going 4–6 with a 5.00 ERA.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
Davis signed with the Milwaukee Brewers after becoming a free agent in mid-July. He made 5 starts in Triple-A before being called up on August 11, 2003. On September 19, he allowed a home run to Hall of Fame pitcher Randy Johnson, the only home run of his career.

Davis was an anchor for the Brewers in 2004. He had career bests in all pitching categories, notching 12 wins while allowing a career low 14 home runs.

Davis continued with the Brewers in 2005, going 11–11 with a 3.84 ERA.

On Mother&#x27;s Day, May 14, 2006, Davis was one of more than 50 batters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the Breast Cancer Foundation. Davis made a brief appearance in 2005 as a potential home buyer on the A&amp;E television program Flip This House episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Rat Race&quot;.

He finished the 2006 season 11–11 with a 4.91 ERA and 102 walks.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
On November 25, 2006, Davis was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks along with pitcher Dana Eveland and outfielder Dave Krynzel, for catcher Johnny Estrada, and pitchers Greg Aquino and Claudio Vargas. The Diamondbacks and Doug Davis agreed to a three-year, $22 million deal.

In his first season for the Diamondbacks, Davis went 13–12 with a 4.25 ERA and 144 strikeouts in 192 innings.
On July 29, 2008, Davis took a perfect game into the bottom of the 7th inning at Petco Park. Davis&#x27; 2008 season was cut short due to injury, making 26 starts, and finishing with a record of 6–8.

On August 12, 2009, Davis&#x27; former team, the Milwaukee Brewers, put a waiver claim on him, but he was not traded. Davis ended the season with a 9–14 record, with a 4.12 ERA and 1.51 WHIP. He tied for the major league lead in errors by a pitcher with 5, and also led the league in walks with 103.

===Milwaukee Brewers (second stint)===
On January 22, 2010, Davis signed a one-year contract with the Milwaukee Brewers for $4.25 million in 2010, with a $6.5 million mutual option for 2011 with a $1 million buyout. Davis endured a rough season in 2010, making only 8 starts and going 1–4 with a 7.51 ERA. He spent most of the season on the disabled list. His option was declined after the season.

===Chicago Cubs===
On April 12, 2011, Davis signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs, stipulating that if he were to join the Cubs major league team that season, he would make $900,000 with possible bonuses that could bring his total salary to nearly $2 million. The Cubs purchased his contract on May 14.

Davis was released on June 29 by the Cubs after going 1–7 with a 6.50 ERA in 9 starts.

===Chicago White Sox===
On July 18, 2011, Davis signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox. He was released on September 4.

===Kansas City Royals===
On May 12, 2012, Davis signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. He remained the whole season at Triple-A, going 9–4 with a 4.66 ERA in 16 starts for the Omaha Storm Chasers. He became a free agent following the season on November 2.

==Pitching style==
Davis threw four pitches: a four-seam fastball at 84–87 mph, a cutter at 80–84, a curveball at 68–72, and a changeup at 78–81. Davis&#x27;s four-seamer was the slowest fastball among left-handed starters in the 2011 season.

Davis typically had a high walk rate throughout his career. He has finished in the top 2 in the National League in walks four times, including first in 2009.

He was known for his windup, a slow process that could be compared to the &quot;two-stage&quot; motions many Japanese pitchers have used. He has also been compared to a knuckleball pitcher inasmuch as Davis never knew where his pitches were going to go; Alex Rodriguez described it as, &quot;“He throws the ball all over the place, throws a very slow breaking ball, good changeup, good fastball, good cutter,” 

==Personal life==
Davis is married to Chantelle Renee Davis, with whom he has three children, Dylan, Gavin and Seaver. He also has a daughter, Drew, and a son, Jordan, with his ex-wife. In his off time, he enjoys golf, chess, fishing, and spending time with his kids.

On March 28, 2008, Davis was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Davis made two starts in the regular 2008 season before having surgery to remove his thyroid, a procedure scheduled for April 10. Following surgery, Davis was given a radioactive iodine treatment to kill any remaining cancer. He was expected to take 4–6 weeks to recover, and doctors reported a 97% chance of full recovery. On May 9, 2008, it was announced by the Diamondbacks that Davis had undergone a series of tests, the results of which indicated that he was, by then, cancer-free. He was expected to make two rehab starts in the minor leagues before returning to the Diamondbacks&#x27; Major League roster.

He returned to the Diamondbacks rotation on May 23, 2008, against the Atlanta Braves. He pitched seven innings, allowing only one run and striking out five in an 11–1 win for Arizona. His father was in the stands for his return.

<doc id="897168" wikidata="Q312483" url="?curid=897168" title="Vyacheslav Tikhonov">
<text>Vyacheslav Vasilyevich Tikhonov (; 8 February 1928 – 4 December 2009) was a Soviet and Russian actor whose best known role was as Soviet spy Stierlitz in the television series &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot;. He was a recipient of numerous state awards, including the titles of People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR (1974) and Hero of Socialist Labour (1982).

== Biography ==
Tikhonov was born in Pavlovsky Posad near Moscow. His mother was a kindergarten teacher and his father an engineer in the local textile factory. Vyacheslav dreamed of acting but his parents envisioned a different career, and during the war he worked in a munitions factory. After employment as a metal worker, he began [training for an] acting career in 1945 by entering, not without difficulty, the Actors’ Faculty of VGIK. After graduating VGIK with honours in 1950, he began his acting career on stage of Theatre Studio of Film Actor, where he worked for six years.

In 1948, he married Nonna Mordyukova, a popular actress at the time. The couple had one son, Vladimir, also an actor, who died in 1990. The marriage was dissolved in 1963. Later, Tikhonov married a second time to Tamara Ivanovna Tikhonova and had one child with her, Anna Tikhonova, also an actor, in 1969.

He died on 4 December 2009 in Moscow, Russia. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev expressed his condolences to Tikhonov&#x27;s family.

== Career ==
Tikhonov made his film debut in 1948. For the next few years, he appeared in relatively low-profile films and at the Film Actors&#x27; Studio Theatre in Smolensk. 

Tikhonov became more well known with the release of the rural family drama &quot;It Happened in Penkovo&quot; (1958), which was followed by several wartime dramas: &quot;May Stars&quot; (1959), set in Prague, and &quot;On the Seven Winds&quot; (1962), on the Western front. In Yevgeny Tashkov&#x27;s &quot;Thirst&quot; (1959), based on real events, Tikhonov, in the first of his spy roles, portrays a scout in an operation to free an Odessa water plant from the Nazis.

In &quot;Two Lives&quot; (1961) Tikhonov plays the less fortunate of two men who unwittingly meet in France, 40-odd years after fighting on opposite sides of the 1917 Revolution. Rostotsky&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;ll Live Till Monday&quot; (1968), in which a history teacher plans to defend a student at a disciplinary meeting, earned Tikhonov a state prize. In 1979 Rostotsky made a documentary about his friend, called &quot;Profession: Film Actor&quot;.&quot;

Tikhonov also played Prince Andrei Bolkonski in the Oscar-winning adaptation of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1968) by Sergei Bondarchuk (who played Bezukhov). But Tikhonov reportedly got the role only at the suggestion of the Minister of Culture when Innokenty Smoktunovsky opted for Kozintsev&#x27;s Hamlet and Oleg Strizhenov was also unavailable.

In 1973, Tikhonov starred in the role for which he is most known for in the former Soviet republics, when director Tatiana Lioznova chose him over Smoktunovsky to star in an adaptation of Yulian Semyonov&#x27;s novel &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot; as Standartenführer Stierlitz. The 17 moments are 17 days in the spring of 1945 just before the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II and centers around attempts by some of the Soviet Union&#x27;s men in Germany to thwart secret peace talks between the Nazis and the U.S. and Britain. The film enjoyed enormous popularity among Russian viewers of several generations. Prior to that, however, it had faced the risk of remaining unknown: Mikhail Suslov had opposed the film to go on general release. He had claimed that the film was not showing the feat of the Soviet people in the war. Fortunately, the decision to release the would-be classic film was supported by KGB Chairman Yuri Andropov. Although several of Semyonov&#x27;s Stierlitz novels were adapted for the screen, Tikhonov did not return, perhaps feeling that the original series was definitive. The role won him the title People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR, one of a number of awards.

In 1976, Tikhonov rejoined Bondarchuk in an adaptation of Mikhail Sholokhov&#x27;s &quot;They Fought for Their Country&quot;. It suited Tikhonov by concentrating on character rather than histrionics and won him another state prize in the year that he finally joined the Communist Party. 1977 saw a change of pace with Rostotsky&#x27;s Oscar-nominated &quot;White Bim the Black Ear&quot;, in which Tikhonov played a middle-aged writer who is &quot;adopted&quot; by a non-pedigree setter puppy.

Though he was often typecast as militiamen or spies, there were good roles among them, such as the KGB general in the cold-war thriller &quot;TaSS is authorised to announce&quot; (1984), another television series based on a Semyonov novel. In later years he was able to display a wider range, including the bishop in &quot;Besy&quot;, a film version of Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Devils&quot; (1992) and Charlemagne, in the &quot;Ubit Drakona&quot;, (&quot;To Kill a Dragon&quot;, 1998) after Evgeny Shvarts&#x27;s wartime satire. Shvarts was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen, and Tikhonov appeared in Eldar Ryazanov&#x27;s fantasy-biography of the Danish fabulist, &quot;Andersen: Life Without Love&quot; (2006), playing God. On 8 February 2003, Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded the Order of Merit for the Fatherland, third degree, to Tikhonov.

Tikhonov appeared in Nikita Mikhalkov&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;Burnt By the Sun&quot; (1994) and also appeared in the 2010 sequel, which finished shooting before his death.

<text>USS &quot;Stevens&quot; (DD–86) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was the first ship named for Thomas Holdup Stevens.

She was laid down at Quincy, Massachusetts, on 20 September 1917 by the Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation. The ship was launched on 13 January 1918, sponsored by Miss Marie Christie Stevens. The destroyer was commissioned at Boston on 24 May 1918.

==Service history==
&quot;Stevens&quot; departed Boston on 3 June, and arrived in New York two days later. On 15 June, she sailed for Europe in the screen of a convoy and reached Brest, France, on 27 June. The following day, she headed for Queenstown in Ireland, arriving there on 6 July. Assigned to the United States Naval Forces, Europe, &quot;Stevens&quot; operated out of that port and protected convoys on the Queenstown-Liverpool circuit until mid-December. She put to sea on 16 December and, after stops at the Azores and Bermuda, entered Boston on 3 January 1919.

Upon her return to the United States, the destroyer was assigned to Destroyer Division 7, Squadron 3, Atlantic Fleet. In the spring of 1919, she cruised to Key West, Florida, and visited New York, before getting underway from Boston on 3 May to participate in the support operations for the first successful transatlantic flight. She put into Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 4 May and stood out again five days later to guard for the Navy seaplanes&#x27; flight to Newfoundland. After returning to Halifax on 11 May, she put to sea and, by 19 May, reached Ponta Delgada, in the Azores. Along the way, she assisted in the search for one of the two downed planes, NC-3.

She completed her mission at Boston on 8 June, and a month later, shifted to Newport, Rhode Island, for normal operations. She visited the southeastern coast of the United States during the fall and early winter of 1919 and was at Philadelphia from 17 December 1919 to 1 June 1920. &quot;Stevens&quot; operated off the New England coast until 3 November 1921, when she set course for Charleston, South Carolina. The destroyer returned to Philadelphia on 8 April 1922 for inactivation. She decommissioned there on 19 June and remained inactive until 7 January 1936 when her name was struck from the Navy list. On 8 September 1936, her hulk was sold to the Boston Iron and Metal Company, Incorporated, of Baltimore, Maryland, for scrapping.

<doc id="897175" wikidata="Q7808399" url="?curid=897175" title="Tino Best">
<text>Tino la Bertram Best (born 26 August 1981) is a former West Indian cricketer. Since 2002, he has played domestic cricket for his native Barbados, with a season at English club Yorkshire in 2010. Best made his Test debut in May 2003 and played his first One Day International a year later. A back strain incurred in May 2004 prevented Best from playing cricket until March the following year. In 2008 Best signed to play in the Indian Cricket League because he had not played international cricket since 2006. He returned to the side when the West Indies fielded a side weakened by contract disputes between leading players and the West Indies Cricket Board but was dropped shortly after.

On his return to the Test side on 10 June 2012, he broke the record for highest score by a number 11 batsman, making 95 against England at Edgbaston. Later in 2013 his record was surpassed by Ashton Agar, who scored 98. The 143-run partnership with Denesh Ramdin in the same match was also notable; it is the third-highest Test stand with one wicket remaining.

==Early career==
Tino Best made his debut in first-class cricket on 25 January 2002, playing for Barbados against Guyana in the Busta Cup. He opened the bowling with Ian Bradshaw and in the first innings took four wickets for 50 runs (4/50), and Barbados won the match by 162 runs. Best finished his debut season with 17 wickets from 5 matches at an average of 24.29 with a single five-wicket haul.

==International breakthrough==
At the time of his Test call up for the Test series against Australia, Best was Barbados&#x27; leading wicket-taker in the Carib Beer Cup for the 2002/03 season with 39 dismissals. Though Best was originally drafted in as cover for fast bowler Jermaine Lawson who had chicken pox, when Best made his debut in the third Test he opened the bowling with Lawson. The West Indies lost and Best bowled twenty overs without taking a wicket.

After an ineffective first Test, Best was overlooked for the West Indies&#x27; overseas tours and drifted out of contention with the emergence of fellow fast bowlers Fidel Edwards and Jerome Taylor. Back at domestic level, he fell out of favour and struggled to be selected for Barbados&#x27; Red Stripe Bowl side. While he was infrequently chosen for the one-day team, he improved on his previous season&#x27;s wicket tally in the first-class competition and finished with 49 wickets including three five-wicket hauls, and was rewarded with a call up to the West Indies side to face England in March 2004. Best&#x27;s first international wickets came in his second Test, the first in a four-match series against England; his maiden dismissal was that of batsman Graham Thorpe. England won the series 3–0 and Best finished as the West Indies&#x27; leading wicket-taker in the series (and third overall) with 12 from four matches at a cost of 25.08 runs each.

Between June and August 2004 the West Indies embarked on a return tour of England. Best played in the Lord&#x27;s Test and was stumped off Ashley Giles&#x27; bowling after some banter from Andrew Flintoff wound him up sufficiently to try to slog the ball into the windows at Lord&#x27;s. During the match Best suffered a back strain and was unable to take part in the rest of the series. It was hoped that the fast bowler would recover within a month, however the injury was more serious than initially hoped and he did not play cricket again until March 2005. In the Second Test against Pakistan in June 2005, after a wicketless first innings – where he had Kamran Akmal caught off a no-ball – and a second innings spell of 5-0-30-0, Best took four wickets in 11 balls, as Pakistan faltered from 223 for 4 to 309 all out. However, it was not enough to give West Indies the win.

Best was fined half his match fee in July 2005 for bowling three beamers during a Test against Sri Lanka. He was dropped from the Test side after the July 2005 tour of Sri Lanka. Tino appeared in the cricket movie Hit for Six playing a Barbados cricket player.

==International fringes==
Despite successful performances for Barbados in domestic cricket by the time Best signed with the rebel Indian Cricket League in February 2008 he had not played international cricket since May 2006. Best played Twenty20 cricket for Mumbai Champs during his spell at ICL, he also played Twenty20 that season for Barbados.

In July 2009, there was a pay dispute between the West Indies players and the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB). As a result, an understrength squad was picked for the series against Bangladesh: of the 15 players named, which included Best, nine were uncapped. Sriram Veera of ESPNcricinfo noted of his performance on the second day of the first Test that &quot;[Best] has, in the past, been guilty of trying to bowl faster than what he was capable of and being erratic as a result. Today, he repeatedly hit the short-of-length in the off-stump channel and slipped in the occasional bouncer.&quot; Those two wickets were his only scalps in the series and he ended up conceding 192 runs. The West Indies lost the series 2–0 as Bangladesh secured their first overseas series win. All the players who played for the West Indies during the contract dispute were given central contracts by the WICB, including Best.

Best signed a contract with Yorkshire County Cricket Club in April 2010 to represent them until the end of May. After some good performances, his contract was extended, but his form tailed off and he was demoted from opening the bowling, before being dropped from the team at the end of July. In nine first-class matches for the club, Best managed 18 wickets at a cost of 44.05 runs each. He was more successful in Yorkshire&#x27;s one-day matches, taking ten wickets from five matches at an average of less than 20. In August 2010, Best&#x27;s central contract was not renewed.

Best&#x27;s domestic performance in the 2011/12 season, in which he took 17 first-class wickets at an average of 20.64, led to his recall to the international squad: in March 2012, Best was selected in the West Indies&#x27; ODI squad to face Australia at home. Though he did not play in the series, two months later when the West Indies toured England Best was drafted into the Test squad as cover for injured fast bowler Shannon Gabriel.

In July 2014, he played for the Rest of the World side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord&#x27;s.

<text>Fidel Henderson Edwards (born 6 February 1982) is a Barbadian cricketer, who played all formats of the game. A pace bowler, his round-arm action is &quot;not unlike&quot; that of former fast bowler Jeff Thomson but similar to the bowling action of Lasith Malinga of Sri Lanka. He was spotted in the nets by Brian Lara and was called up for his Test debut against Sri Lanka after just one match for Barbados. Edwards was a member of the West Indies team that won the 2012 T20 World Cup.

Despite a promising start to his Test career, he has been injury prone and inconsistent. With an average of just under 40 in Test cricket, he has struggled to fulfil his early potential.

He is the half brother of Pedro Collins.

==Domestic and T20 franchise career==
The experienced campaigner who also plays in the Bangladesh Premier League was bought by Rajasthan Royals in players auction for IPL 2013 for US$210,000. On 6 February 2009 the IPL franchise of Deccan Chargers bought Edwards for $150,000. His club team in Barbados is YMPC.

Edwards was bought for $60,000 by Khulna Royal Bengals to play in the newly formed Bangladesh Premier League to be held in February 2012.

Edwards made his first-class debut on 1 February 2002, playing for Barbados against the Windward Islands. In the first innings he opened the bowling with Tino Best; he had to wait until the second to take his only wicket in the match, that of Junior Murray. The Barbados squad had plenty of fast bowlers, with the likes of Best, Pedro Collins, Corey Collymore, Vasbert Drakes, and Ian Bradshaw, who all had international experience by mid-2003.

On 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Winnipeg Hawks in the players&#x27; draft for the inaugural edition of the Global T20 Canada tournament. He was the leading wicket-taker in the tournament for the Winnipeg Hawks, with eleven dismissals in six matches. In July 2020, he was named in the Jamaica Tallawahs squad for the 2020 Caribbean Premier League.

In April 2021, he was signed by Peshawar Zalmi to play in the rescheduled matches in the 2021 Pakistan Super League.

==International career==
===Impressive debuts===
Strong competition and injury meant Edwards struggled for selection. However, the selectors had monitored his development and in May that year Edwards impressed batsman Brian Lara while bowling in the nets. On the basis of the potential he showed, Edwards was included for the West Indies Test against Sri Lanka the following month. Edwards made his Test debut against Sri Lanka at Kingston, Jamaica, making 5 not out and returning with bowling figures of 5/36 and 1/54 in a winning West Indian effort. In his second first-class match, he produced the third-best bowling figures by a West Indies player on debut.

In One Day Internationals, his debut was against Zimbabwe on 29 November 2003 at Harare, taking career-best figures of 6/22 off 7 overs. As of January 2015, he is the only player to have taken 6 wickets on their ODI debut and he is only the second player after Tony Dodemaide to have taken 5 wicket hauls in both his test and ODI debuts.

===Injuries===
During the subsequent tour of South Africa he picked up an injury to his shins, which Edwards felt badly affected his bowling in South Africa. In four Tests against South Africa, he managed eight wickets while conceding 648 runs.

On 21 December 2008 Edwards picked up a career best 7 for 87 against New Zealand at the McLean Park in Napier. In so doing he claimed his 100th test wicket, a caught and bowled to dismiss top order batsman Tim McIntosh.

In the June 2009 ICC World Twenty20, Edwards suffered a back injury. He suffered a recurrence of the injury when he played for the Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League in October of that year. Consequently, his central contract was not renewed and Edwards later underwent back surgery.

===Comeback===

In the 2010–11 West Indian cricket season, Edwards made his comeback from injury, taking 22 wickets from 6 matches for Barbados at a cost of 23.77 runs. Having proved his fitness, Edwards was called into the West Indies squad for the first Test against Pakistan in May 2011, almost two years after he was sidelined with a back injury. Though included in the squad, he had to wait until India toured in June before returning to the side. Though he was apprehensive ahead of the first Test, he troubled the Indian batsmen and took four wickets.

During the Windies&#x27; 2011 tour of India, Edwards took his 150th test wicket, dismissing Sachin Tendulkar LBW for seven, in the first match of the test series held at Delhi.

In March 2012 the West Indies Cricket Board announced that while Edwards was considered whenever Test and T20I teams were selected, he was overlooked in ODIs to manage his workload; he has not played an ODI since 2009.

Edwards last played a One Day International in 2009, and the West Indies Cricket Board manages his workload to avoid further injuring him. A back injury incurred during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 prevented Edwards from playing international cricket until 2011.

In February 2021, Edwards made his comeback to West Indies national team after 8 years as he was named in the T20I squad for Sri Lanka series.

==Playing style==
Discussing his round-arm bowling action in 2004, Edwards remarked &quot;I never copied anyone, its just natural. People feel it&#x27;s a very difficult action but its like riding a bicycle. And the main advantage I get bowling in that fashion is I can swing the ball more, especially the old one. Yes, at times the swing is too wide and a few more extras are added, but I am coping with that.&quot; His bowling speed is around the late 80s and early 90s mph. His fastest was clocked at 157.7 km/h in 2003.

While his statistics attest to him being a genuine tailender, Edwards has helped save the West Indies in three Test matches during his career, forming frustrating last wicket partnerships. The first instance came against Zimbabwe at Harare in 2003, where he hung in for 33 balls to deny the African nation a rare victory. In 2006, Edwards remained at the crease for 36 balls at the Antigua Recreation Ground, with India unable to claim the final wicket, while in 2009 he prevented England from a win at the same ground by remaining unbeaten on five after 26 deliveries.

<doc id="897177" wikidata="Q2732196" url="?curid=897177" title="Chris Gayle">
<text>Christopher Henry Gayle (born 21 September 1979) is a Jamaican cricketer who has played international cricket for the West Indies from 1999 to 2021. Nicknamed &quot;The Universe Boss&quot;, Gayle is widely regarded as the greatest Twenty20 batsman ever. He played a crucial role in the West Indies teams that won the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and 2016 ICC World Twenty20. 

He has set numerous records across all three formats of the game. He is the most capped player for the West Indies in international cricket and is the only player to score a triplet of centuries – a triple hundred in Tests, double hundred in ODIs and a hundred in T20Is. Gayle is the only player to score more than 14,000 runs and hit more than 1000 sixes in T20 cricket He is also the leading run scorer for West Indies in both ODIs and T20Is and, after Brian Lara, was the second player to score more than 10,000 runs for West Indies in ODI Cricket. Gayle was the first West Indian batsman to score a double-century in ODI cricket and subsequently in the history of World Cup cricket, where he scored an innings of 215 against Zimbabwe. His innings of 215 is currently the highest individual score by a left-handed batsman in ODI cricket. Along with the ODI record, he has the highest individual score in the T20 World Cup as a West Indian with his 117 runs against South Africa. Moreover, in the ICC Champions Trophy, he has the highest score made by a West Indian with his innings of 133 not out against South Africa in the 2006 tournament. In addition to his batting, He has picked up over 200 International Wickets with his Right-arm off-break spin bowling. He was awarded the Most Valuable Player in the 2011 Indian Premier League and held the Orange Cap in 2012. On 23 April 2013, He broke the record for the fastest ever T20 hundred in his landmark knock of 175 runs from 66 balls for Royal Challengers Bangalore against Pune Warriors India in the IPL, which is also the highest score ever by a batsman in T20 history. He also equaled the record for the fastest 50 in T20 cricket while playing for Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League.

Playing Tests, Gayle scored over 7,000 runs at an average of over 42 and captained the West Indian Test side from 2007 to 2010. He last played in a Test match in September 2014, against Bangladesh. After initially expressing his desire to retire from ODIs after the 2019 Cricket World Cup He nonetheless played in the ODI series against India after the World Cup playing his final and 301st ODI match wearing the special jersey number 301 in August 2019, against India. In December 2020, Gayle was included in the ICC T20I Team of the Decade.

In September 2021, he was included in the West Indies squad for 2021 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup.

==Early career==
Gayle started his cricket career with Lucas Cricket Club in Kingston, Jamaica. Gayle claimed: &quot;If it was not for Lucas, I don&#x27;t know where I would be today. Maybe on the streets.&quot; Lucas Cricket Club&#x27;s nursery has been named in honour of Gayle.

He was made captain of the West Indies side in the ICC T20 World Cup 2009 after getting criticized for playing in the IPL 2008 and missing an international series a few months before. Gayle scored a quickfire 88 in the opening game of the tournament and helped the Windies beat the mighty Australians. They lost in the semi-final to Sri Lanka.

==International career==
===Debut years===
Gayle first played at the international level as a youth where he topscored for the Windies at the 1998 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. He eventually made his first-class debut in 1998, at age 19 for Jamaica. He played his first One Day International eleven months later in 1999, and his first Test match six months after that. Gayle went on to establish himself as a destructive batsman who&#x27;s most effective whilst playing square of the wicket. In July 2001, Gayle recorded his maiden Test century by scoring 175 against Zimbabwe at Queens Sports Club, Bulawayo. In partnership with Daren Ganga they added 214 to equal the record for opening stands against the host country.

===Rise in ranks===

Gayle had a slow start to his international career, but invigorated it in 2002, ending the year with three centuries against India in November and becoming the third West Indian to score over 1,000 runs in a calendar year, along with Vivian Richards and Brian Lara. He is one of only six players in One Day International history to have three or more scores of 150. In 2005, Gayle was dropped for the first Test against South Africa along with six other players following a dispute over sponsorship issues (see below). He returned for the second Test but had a poor series until the fourth Test, where he made a match-saving 317. It was the first-ever triple century against South Africa and up until Mahela Jayawardene made 374, it was the highest individual Test score against them. In another match of the series, Gayle had to leave the field after complaining of dizziness. During a subsequent series against Australia, Gayle again complained of dizziness and shortness of breath during his innings. He left the field for a time, and was after the match sent to hospital where he was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect causing a cardiac dysrhythmia. He underwent heart surgery following the series to correct the defect. Gayle was only the fourth West Indian to carry his bat in a Test innings.In August 2005, Gayle joined Worcestershire for the rest of the English season, playing eight matches. He made two half-centuries in three first-class matches and two half-centuries in five one-day matches, and won one Man of the Match award in the one-day National League. However, Worcestershire were relegated after Gayle made 1 in the final match against Lancashire.

Gayle was named Player of the 2006 Champions Trophy, where the West Indies nearly defended the title they won in 2004, being defeated in the final by Australia. Gayle scored three centuries and totalled 474 runs, 150 more than any other batsman, and also took eight wickets in as many matches. Gayle, in keeping with the rest of the West Indies team, had a poor World Cup in 2007. He recorded a series of low scores; the one exception being a blistering 79 off 58 balls against England in the West Indies&#x27; final match.

Gayle made the first century in international Twenty20 cricket, scoring 117 against South Africa in the first match of the 2007 World Twenty20. The innings made him the first batsman to score a century in each of international cricket&#x27;s three formats. This stood alone as the record score in a T20I until 19 February 2012, when South Africa&#x27;s Richard Levi scored 117n.o. against New Zealand, and was eventually exceeded by Brendon McCullum of New Zealand later that year.

In the semi-final match of the 2009 World Twenty20 against Sri Lanka, he became the first international player to carry his bat through the entire innings in this format of the game as well. In April 2008, Gayle was bought by the franchise Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League player auction, but missed the opening games due to a Sri Lankan tour to the Caribbean. When he finally joined the team, he missed out on the action due to a groin injury he picked up during that tour. Afterwards, he left to join the West Indies team for a home series against Australia, therefore not playing in the inaugural version of the IPL.

He played in the second IPL competition in early 2009, arriving for an away Test series against England very late, earning criticism about his commitment. His Test series went poorly, and the West Indies went on to lose both the Test and ODI series. Gayle, however, went to on score a match winning 88 in the first official match of the 2009 Twenty20, in a surprise victory over Australia.

On 17 December 2009 in the Australia v West Indies 3rd Test Chris Gayle scored the then fifth-fastest century in Test match history, taking just 70 balls to reach 100, including nine fours and six sixes. He was dismissed two balls later for 102 runs. On 16 November 2010, he became the fourth cricketer to score two triple centuries in Test cricket after Donald Bradman, Brian Lara and Virender Sehwag.

On his return to Test cricket in July 2012, he scored 150 on the third day of the first Test against New Zealand.

Gayle scored 75 runs from 41 balls, fuelling West Indies&#x27; total of 205, against Australia in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 semi-final, which was the highest total of the tournament.

In November 2012, during the First Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka, Gayle became the first player in the history of Test cricket to hit a six off the first ball of a match. In 2013, during the Third Test against Zimbabwe, Gayle surpassed Brian Lara&#x27;s record of the most sixes in Test cricket by a West Indian cricketer.

===Late career===
In February 2015, Gayle became the fourth cricketer (and the first ever non-Indian) to score a double century in ODIs, and the first ever to do so in World Cup history, when he made 215 during a pool game against Zimbabwe in the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup in Canberra. His partnership with Marlon Samuels was the most productive wicket in Cricket World Cup history, producing 372 runs before Gayle was caught for an out on the final ball of the innings. Coincidentally, he was almost adjudged out on the first ball he faced as an LBW appeal was raised by Zimbabwe bowler, Tinashe Panyangara, however, the umpire turned down the appeal. Despite a review which showed that the ball would have clipped the top of the bails, the original decision was upheld. Gayle thus became the only player in world cricket to hit a triple hundred in Tests, a double hundred in ODIs and a hundred in Twenty20 Internationals.
Chris Gayle ended his List-A career for Jamaica with a match-winning century against Barbados in a Super50 Cup 2018. On 18 February 2019, Gayle announced that he would retire from ODIs after the 2019 Cricket World Cup. He reversed this decision in June 2019.

In April 2019, he was named in the West Indies&#x27; squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup, which marked his fifth consecutive World Cup appearance (2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019). On 31 May 2019, in the West Indies&#x27; opening match of the World Cup, Gayle scored his 40th six in World Cup matches, the most by any batsman in World Cup history, surpassing AB de Villiers&#x27;s record of 37. In the West Indies&#x27; match against Australia, Gayle scored his 1,000th run in the Cricket World Cup. On 1 July 2019, in the match against Sri Lanka, Gayle became the most capped player for the West Indies in international cricket, playing in his 455th match.

Three days later, in the West Indies&#x27; final match of the 2019 Cricket World Cup, against Afghanistan, Gayle became the most-capped player for the West Indies in the Cricket World Cup, playing in his 35th match. In the same match he also equalled Brian Lara&#x27;s record of playing in 299 ODIs for the West Indies.
In the next game against India, he played his 300th ODI match, the only West Indian player to achieve that feat. He also broke the record for the most runs for the West Indies in ODIs, surpassing Brian Lara. In the next match, he scored a breath-taking 72 of just 41 balls, in a knock having 5 maximums, as he led his team to a respectable total of 240 in 35 overs. Chasing a revised target of 255 in 35 overs via DLS, India looked in a spot of bother, but Indian skipper Virat Kohli&#x27;s unbeaten 114 cost them the match as India won the series 2–0.

In November 2020, Gayle was nominated for the ICC Men&#x27;s T20I Cricketer of the Decade award. In February 2021, Gayle was recalled to West Indies&#x27; T20I squad after two-year absence and named in the T20I squad against Sri Lanka. On 13 July 2021, against Australia in the third T20I, Gayle scored his first T20I half-century in the format since 2016, scoring 67 off 38 deliveries.

In September 2021, Gayle was named in the West Indies&#x27; squad for the 2021 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup.

===Retirement===
On 6 November 2021, Gayle played his last T20I match against Australia in the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium. However he has not announced his retirement from international cricket yet. He wanted to retire in front of his home crowd in Jamaica.

==Twenty20 cricket==
On 1 July 2009, Gayle signed with the Western Australia Warriors for the Australian Domestic Twenty20 tournament known as the Big Bash for the 2009–10 season.
In 2011, after being left out of the initial part of the West Indies T20 and one-day home series against Pakistan, Gayle opted to join the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the fourth edition of the Indian Premier League. In his debut game against his previous team Kolkata Knight Riders in their home ground, he scored 102 off 55 balls, hitting 10 fours and 7 sixes. On 6 May 2011, he scored another century, 107 off 49 balls in Bangalore against the Kings XI Punjab, which included 10 fours and 9 sixes. In the next match against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, he scored 37 runs in one over, which included 3 sixes, 3 fours and a no ball that was hit for a six. Although many people cite him as having hit the over for 37, one run was awarded as an extra due to the no ball. He can therefore be said to have hit 36 off an over that went for 37. Gayle won the Orange Cap Award for scoring the most runs in the tournament amassing 608 runs in 12 matches. He was instrumental in many victories for the Royal Challengers Bangalore and received five Man of the Match awards and also the Player of the Tournament award for his performances. In the 2011 Champions League Twenty20, Chris Gayle was the second highest run-scorer in the competition, behind David Warner, with 257 runs from 6 matches at an average of 42.83 and a top score of 92, and was one of the star players.

Following his prolific performances, Gayle was signed by Zimbabwean franchise Matabeleland Tuskers, for the 2011-12 Stanbic Bank 20 Series. As Gayle later recalled it was valuable practice ahead of the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash, where he had signed for the Sydney Thunder. Gayle hoped his first appearance in the tournament was a success, and he gave the spectators something to cheer about. Gayle was the second West Indian to be signed in the event, after the legendary Brian Lara had signed for Southern Rocks the previous season.

Gayle enjoyed great success in that tournament. He was the leading run-scorer in that series with 293 runs, a top score of 109, and an average over 50, the best of the tournament. The only century Gayle scored in the event ended in defeat as Mid West Rhinos&#x27;s Brendan Taylor&#x27;s outstanding 75* outlasted his team. The Tuskers could not win the tournament as they were overpowered by Mashonaland Eagles&#x27;s Ryan ten Doeschate&#x27;s brilliant 121* off 58 and despite Gayle scoring a half-century, it was not enough to see his home through.

Gayle also joined the Barisal Burners in the Bangladesh Premier League, and had scored two centuries at more than a run-a-ball.

In the 2012 IPL season, Gayle hit the most sixes (59) and was nominated for the orange cap for making 733 in 14 matches.

Gayle was selected for team Uva Next for the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League in 2012, but did not play for the team due to injury.

Gayle started off his 2013 IPL season scoring 92 not out from 58 balls, hitting 11 fours and four sixes against the Mumbai Indians. His innings helped his side to victory, and he was awarded the man of the match. On 23 April 2013, during an IPL match against Pune Warriors India, Gayle broke multiple scoring records. With an individual score of 175 not out off 66 balls and a century reached in 30 balls, Gayle set records for the fastest century reached in any format of cricket, the highest individual score in a T20 match, and the most sixes scored in a single innings in the IPL. He also took two wickets in the match.

At the launch of the Caribbean Premier League, Gayle was announced as the first franchise player for the league.

During the 2015 T20 Blast season in England, Gayle represented Somerset and despite appearing in just 3 games for the county he contributed 328 runs including a score of 151 not out in a losing cause against Kent. The knock that came from 62 balls included 15 sixes and remains the highest T20 score at the County Ground Taunton.

On 18 January 2016, in a match with the Adelaide Strikers, Gayle set a new Big Bash League record for the fastest fifty and equaled the world record set by Indian batsman Yuvraj Singh against England in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20. He reached 51 in just 12 deliveries which included seven sixes and smashed the previous record of 18 deliveries set by Strikers batsman Tim Ludeman. He was dismissed shortly after for 56 off 17 balls by Travis Head.

Gayle was signed by Lahore Qalandars in 2016 for 200,000 dollars to play in the Pakistan Super League (PSL). Gayle had his worst T20 league, citing back problems. He only scored 103 runs from five matches and was also out twice for a golden duck, the most in his T20 career, by Junaid Khan. Gayle returned for a second season of PSL in 2017, this time picked by Karachi Kings. He played 9 matches for the side, and scored merely 160 runs. This would be prove to be last outing for Gayle in PSL, as he wasn&#x27;t picked by any side in the 2018 and 2019 drafts of the league. In 2021, he was picked by Quetta Gladiators.

On 18 April 2017, Gayle reached the 10,000 runs milestone in T20 cricket after scoring 77 runs off 38 balls in a match against Gujarat Lions where Royal Challengers Bangalore won by 21 runs. He was also awarded the man of the match which was his first in IPL 2017.

On 16 September 2017, Gayle became the first ever player to hit 100 T20I sixes.

On 28 January 2018, Gayle was bought by Kings XI Punjab (Now Punjab Kings) in the 2018 IPL Auction for his base price of ₹20 million. On 19 April, Gayle scored 104* off 63 balls against Sunrisers Hyderabad, and his team won the match by 15 runs. It was his 6th IPL century. Gayle was retained by the franchise for IPL 2021. He however left the tournament in the second leg, citing &#x27;bio-bubble fatigue&#x27;.

In May 2018, Gayle was named as one of the ten marquee players for the first edition of the Global T20 Canada cricket tournament. On 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Vancouver Knights in the players&#x27; draft for the inaugural edition of the tournament. In September 2018, he was named as the Icon Player for Balkh&#x27;s squad in the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League tournament. The following month, he was named in Jozi Stars&#x27; squad for the first edition of the Mzansi Super League T20 tournament. In June 2019, he was selected to play for the Vancouver Knights franchise team in the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament. In September 2019, he was named in the squad for the Jozi Stars team for the 2019 Mzansi Super League tournament. In October 2020, he was drafted by the Kandy Tuskers for the inaugural edition of the Lanka Premier League. In November 2021, he was selected to play for the Colombo Stars following the players&#x27; draft for the 2021 Lanka Premier League.

On 17 May 2022, Gayle was inducted into the RCB Hall of Fame (along with AB de Villiers) for his contributions to the team between 2011 and 2017.

In 2022, Chris Gayle made his Legends League Cricket debut for Gujarat Giants.

===Twenty20 centuries===
Playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore, Gayle scored a 30-ball century, that became the highest individual T20 score (175 not out). It eclipsed the previous mark set by Brendon McCullum of Kolkata Knight Riders.

Gayle holds the record for most centuries in T20 cricket (21), 15 more than his nearest rival Brendon McCullum. 15 out of his 21 T20 centuries have been not out.

==Technique and attitude==
Gayle is known for his characteristic hitting, imposing physique, and timing. He attributes the latter to being very thin when young, and having a heavy bat. He is known for appearing very calm as the bowler approaches. &quot;Tall and imposing at the crease, he loves to carve through the covers off either foot, and has the ability to decimate the figures of even the thriftiest of opening bowlers&quot; recorded &quot;Wisden&quot; and ESPNcricinfo. He holds numerous records that reflect his batting style, including record Twenty20 strike-rates and high scores.

&quot;It is instinct... We premeditate at times, but most of those things are instinct. When a fast bowler runs in to me, my breathing is controlled. So you keep a still head, slow down your breathing. Sometimes I actually hold my breath, so I can be as still and well-balanced as possible. If you get too excited, you overreact more, and with the adrenalin, you lose focus quickly.&quot;

== Music ==
Chris Gayle launched a music career in November 2020 with a dancehall music video called &quot;We Come Out To Party&quot;. Earlier in 2020, he had released a video about his partying lifestyle. In April 2021, Gayle released a music video titled &quot;Jamaica to India&quot; in collaboration with the Indian rapper Emiway Bantai. In September 2021, Gayle announced a song named &#x27;Punjabi Daddy&#x27;.

== Personal life ==
Gayle&#x27;s partner is Allysa Berridge. On 20 April 2016, Gayle announced the birth of his daughter on social media platform Instagram. On 9 September 2016, Gayle launched his autobiography &quot;Six Machine – I don&#x27;t like cricket, I love it&#x27;.&quot; According to Forbes, Gayle has an estimated net worth of $15 million.

==Controversies==
In 2005, Gayle was involved in the dispute between the West Indies Cricket Board and a number of players over sponsorship issues. These players had personal sponsorship deals with Cable and Wireless, who used to sponsor West Indian cricket. However, since the West Indies had recently become sponsored by Cable and Wireless&#x27;s rivals Digicel, the West Indies Cricket Board demanded the players dropped their Cable and Wireless deals. When the players refused to back down, the West Indies Cricket Board dropped them for the first Test against South Africa. Gayle later cut his deal with Cable and Wireless and rejoined the side for the second Test. 

He was charged with conduct contrary to the spirit of cricket during a Test against New Zealand in March 2006 but was subsequently found not guilty. Later that year, during October&#x27;s Champions Trophy tournament in India, he was fined 30 percent of his match fee after repeated verbal exchanges with the Australian batsman Michael Clarke. He also publicly criticised the West Indies Cricket Board during the 2007 tour of England, which led to an official reprimand and warning.

Gayle also received criticism in early 2009 during West Indies&#x27; tour of England, where he commented that he did not want to captain the West Indies any more given the pressures involved, and that he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be so sad&quot; if Test cricket was superseded by Twenty20 cricket in the future. From the West Indies, both Viv Richards and Gary Sobers criticised Gayle&#x27;s comments, as did opposite number Andrew Strauss. Gayle later commented that his statement had been quoted out of context, according to Julian Hunte, President of the West Indies Cricket Board. In an interview with Mike Atherton at the conclusion of a West Indies defeat in their tour of England, Gayle stated that he was not going to resign the captaincy.

In April 2011 Chris Gayle criticised the West Indies Cricket Board and coach Ottis Gibson and did not play for the team for more than a year. On 6 April 2012, Gayle and the WICB reached an understanding that paved the way for the former West Indies captain to return to the national team. On 25 June 2012, Gayle was chosen to be a part of the 2nd T20 and five-match one-day squad series starting on 30 June 2012, in the West Indies and Florida. They won the T20 series 2–0, in which Gayle was awarded man of the series, and the ODI series 4–1, in which Gayle made an aggressive century and half-century.

On 4 January 2016, while being interviewed by Network Ten commentator Mel McLaughlin during the 2015–16 Big Bash League season, Gayle said, &quot;I just wanted to have an interview with you as well; that&#x27;s why I batted so well,&quot; followed by, &quot;Your eyes are beautiful; hopefully we can win this game and then we can have a drink after as well. Don&#x27;t blush, baby&quot;. The comments were criticised by the Australian media, with former Australian test captain Ian Chappell encouraging Cricket Australia to ban him from playing in Australia again. Fellow female sports journalist Neroli Meadows stated that Gayle had been acting in such a way for years, and that he did it to &quot;humiliate&quot; women. Gayle said the comments were intended to be a joke. Melbourne Renegades sanctioned Gayle with a 10,000 fine for inappropriate conduct. On 30 October 2017, Chris Gayle won a defamation case against Fairfax Media after a jury found a series of articles published in 2016 which alleged he exposed himself to a masseuse were untrue and was awarded with $300k in damages for defamation.

== The Chris Gayle Academy ==
In 2015, Gayle set up &#x27;The Chris Gayle Academy&#x27; with the intent on helping disadvantaged children in both Jamaica and the United Kingdom better themselves and their communities through their involvement in sport. Since then the academy has expanded and now facilitates the advancement of young cricketers careers by providing access to quality coaches and playing opportunities abroad.

==International centuries==
Gayle has scored 42 international centuries, which includes 15 Tests, 25 ODIs and 2 T20I centuries as of 13 July 2021. He was the first cricketer to score centuries in all formats of the game.

<doc id="897179" wikidata="Q13121361" url="?curid=897179" title="Vasbert Drakes">
<text>Vasbert Conniel Drakes (born 5 August 1969) is a former West Indian cricketer, who played Tests and ODIs. He was a right-arm medium-fast bowler and handy right-hand lower order batsman. 

Drakes featured for Sussex, Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire and Border in his cricketing career. He also coached the UAE, Barbados and the West Indies women&#x27;s cricket team.

==International career==
Drakes made his international debut in 1994–95, when he played 5 ODI games against Australia cricket team, followed by a tour of England. He did not return to the side until the age of 33, when in September 2002 he was named in the West Indies cricket team&#x27; squad for the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy.

He took the wicket of Jacques Kallis in his first international over for seven years. He went on to make his test debut, on 8 December 2002, against Bangladesh at Dhaka&#x27;s Bangabandhu National Stadium. Drakes then took 5 wickets against Australia in the first test of the 2003 Frank Worrel Trophy series played at Bourda. This was his first and only five wicket haul in test match cricket. With the bat he scored a notable unbeaten 27 which helped the Windies to chase down a world-record target of 418, set by Australia cricket team in the fourth test of the series played at the Antigua Recreation Ground. He later made 67 in a test match played in and against South Africa. This was his first and only half century in international cricket. 

Drakes also featured in the 2003 ICC World Cup where he took a spectacular diving catch in a game against Canada. He eventually picked up a sum of 51 wickets at an average of 25.35 with two five wicket hauls in his ODI career. 

==Domestic career==
Drakes played county cricket for English sides Sussex, Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire and Leicestershire. He scored two centuries for Sussex and picked up 80 wickets in his first and only season with Nottinghamshire.
He also featured for South African club Border, with Drakes twice being named, in 1999 and 2000, as one of the South African Cricketers of the Year.

Drakes is also one of only six batsmen in the history of first-class cricket to be given out timed out. As he wasn&#x27;t in the country at the time, his flight to South Africa, to attend a match played between Border and Free State, had been delayed by several hours.

== Coaching career ==
After his cricketing career, Drakes was appointed coach of United Arab Emirates national cricket team for a three-month period that included the 2008 Asia Cup and 2008 ACC Trophy Elite. Then he took over coaching for Barbados cricket team. He was also briefly the coach of Queen&#x27;s Park Cricket Club.

In April 2015, Drakes was named head coach of West Indies women&#x27;s cricket team. He led the West Indies women&#x27;s cricket team to their first major title by winning the 2016 ICC Women&#x27;s World Twenty20 in India.

==Personal life==
Drakes&#x27;s son, Dominic Drakes is also a cricketer who&#x27;s a left arm seamer.

<doc id="897181" wikidata="Q991543" url="?curid=897181" title="Bruce Bawer">
<text>Theodore Bruce Bawer (born October 31, 1956) is an American-Norwegian writer. Born and raised in New York, he has been a resident of Norway since 1999 and became a citizen of Norway in 2024. He is a literary, film, and cultural critic and a novelist and poet, who has also written about gay rights, Christianity, and Islam.

Bawer proposed same-sex marriage in his book &quot;A Place at the Table&quot; (1993). &quot;While Europe Slept&quot; (2006) skeptically examined the rise of Islamism and sharia in the Western world, and &quot;The Victims&#x27; Revolution&quot; (2012) was a criticism of academic identity studies.

He has been described as a conservative by some. Bawer has argued that such labels are misleading or reductionist. He said his views were &quot;motivated by a dedication to individual identity and individual freedom and an opposition to groupthink, oppression, tyranny.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Bawer is of Polish descent through his father and is of English, Welsh, Scottish, Scotch-Irish, and French descent through his mother, whom he profiled in the September 2017 issue of &quot;Commentary&quot;.
Born and raised in New York City, Bawer attended New York City public schools and Stony Brook University, where he studied literature under the poet Louis Simpson. As a graduate student, he taught undergraduate courses in literature and composition. He earned a B.A. in English from Stony Brook in 1978, followed by an M.A. in 1982 and a Ph.D. in 1983, both also in English. While in graduate school, he published essays in &quot;Notes on Modern American Literature&quot; and the &quot;Wallace Stevens Journal&quot;, and opinion pieces in &quot;Newsweek&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. His dissertation, &quot;The Middle Generation&quot;, was about the poets Delmore Schwartz, Randall Jarrell, John Berryman, and Robert Lowell.

==Writing career==

===Literary criticism===

A revised version of Bawer&#x27;s dissertation was published under the same title in 1986. Reviewing the book in &quot;The New Criterion&quot;, James Atlas called the &quot;character analyses... shrewdly intuitive and sympathetic&quot;, found Bawer&#x27;s &quot;explanation for why the poets of the Middle Generation were so obsessed with [T.S.] Eliot especially persuasive&quot;, and described Bawer as &quot;an impressive textual critic&quot; with a &quot;casual and self-assured&quot; critical voice.

Bawer contributed to the arts journal &quot;The New Criterion&quot; between October 1983 and May 1993. A &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; article &quot;The Changing World of New York Intellectuals&quot;, foregrounded the contributors to &quot;The New Criterion&quot;, observing that &quot;The youthful contributors to Hilton Kramer&#x27;s magazine—Bruce Bawer, Mimi Kramer, Roger Kimball—are still in their 20s, but they manage to sound like the British critic F.R. Leavis. Their articles are full of pronouncements about &#x27;moral values,&#x27; &#x27;the crisis in the humanities,&#x27; &#x27;the significance of art.&#x27; Their mission is to defend American culture against shoddy merchandise, and they don&#x27;t shirk from the task.&quot;

===Early books===

In 1987, his book &quot;The Contemporary Stylist&quot; was published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. The year after, Graywolf Press issued Diminishing Fictions, a collection of essays on the modern novel. Reviewing it in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Jack Fuller complained of &quot;sour notes&quot;, such as &quot;undeserved sneers&quot;, but concluded that &quot;What redeems Bawer&#x27;s excesses is the persuasive case he makes that he is on a desperate rescue mission.&quot;

Graywolf published Bawer&#x27;s second collection of essays on fiction, &quot;The Aspect of Eternity&quot;, in 1993. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called the essays &quot;beautifully written&quot; and &quot;a cause for celebration&quot;, and George Core, in &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, called Bawer &quot;a first-rate critic whose continuing achievement as an independent literary journalist... is cause for our astonishment and celebration—one of the few positive signs about critics and criticism in our contentious and stuffy times&quot;.

Bawer also published a collection of essays on poetry, &quot;Prophets and Professors&quot;, in 1995. &quot;Running through these critical commentaries&quot;, wrote &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;is the theme that too many younger poets are caught up in romantic excess, that the influence of Allen Ginsberg and the Beats and the confessional self-destruction of Sylvia Plath have excused so much of the sloppy, informal and poured-out emotion of today&#x27;s poets... He is on the side of the formalists and those for whom poetry is not a game of literary gossip. This book is an intelligent study by someone who has read and judged a great deal of poetry and criticism.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Katherine Knorr wrote that &quot;Bawer is one of the best literary critics in America today&quot;, who proves &quot;that the best literary criticism comes from a serious, close reading of the work that avoids the temptations of celebrity and fashionable politics&quot;.

Reviewing &quot;Prophets and Professors&quot;, &quot;Washington Post&quot; critic Jonathan Yardley described Bawer as &quot;one of the appallingly few American literary journalists whose work repays the reading&quot; and &quot;an intelligent, independent, tough-minded critic and a clear-eyed observer of literary affairs&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, Andrea Barnet described the book as &quot;immensely readable... provocative and entertaining&quot;, saying that Bawer was &quot;thoughtful, sharply opinionated, high-minded and unafraid to slash at sacred cows&quot;, Leslie Schenk of &quot;World Literature Today&quot; opined that Bawer &quot;has the uncanny knack of writing good sense precisely in those fields where good sense seems to have been taboo... As though with the scalpel of a surgeon removing tumors, he deftly, coolly, cuts through the ephemeral malarkey that hitherto obscured his subjects. His book &quot;A Place at the Table&quot;, for example, stands as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar in the seas of mush that otherwise surround the subject of homosexuality.&quot; In &quot;Prophets and Professors&quot;, &quot;Bawer performs a similar operation on American academia&#x27;s pet fetish, modern poetry&quot;, resulting in &quot;the most important book on poetry since Dana Gioia&#x27;s Can Poetry Matter?&quot;

===Poetry===

Along with Dana Gioia, Thomas M. Disch, Charles Martin, and others, Bawer was one of the leading figures of the New Formalism movement in poetry. His poetry appeared in the 1996 anthology &quot;Rebel Angels: 25 Poets of the New Formalism&quot;, and he contributed to an essay (described as &quot;heavy-handed&quot; by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;) to the movement&#x27;s manifesto, &quot;Poetry after Modernism&quot;.

Bawer&#x27;s poems have appeared in &quot;Poetry&quot;, &quot;Paris Review&quot;, and &quot;The New Criterion&quot;. A chapbook of Bawer&#x27;s poems, Innocence, was published in 1988 by Aralia Press, which also published individual poems by Bawer in other forms. A full-length collection of Bawer&#x27;s poetry, &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, appeared in 1993. It was selected as the year&#x27;s best first book of poetry by the &quot;Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook&quot;.

==Film criticism==

From 1987 to 1990, Bawer served as the film critic for the conservative monthly &quot;The American Spectator&quot;. He also wrote several articles on film for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other publications. A collection of his film reviews, &quot;The Screenplay&#x27;s the Thing, was&quot; published in 1992. &quot;Best known as a literary critic, Bawer is an engaging, astute, formidable film reviewer as well&quot;, wrote &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, describing Bawer as a &quot;[p]olitically unpredictable&quot; critic who &quot;deflates the arty (Caravaggio), the preachy (&quot;Platoon&quot;; &quot;The Milagro Beanfield War&quot;) and the kitschy (&quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;), but gives thumbs up to &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;, &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;, &quot;Roxanne&quot;, &quot;Crossing Delancey&quot; and &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot;... One wishes he were a full-time movie critic.&quot; Bawer later wrote that he left &quot;The American Spectator&quot; because of a conflict with an editor over a reference to homosexuality in one of his reviews. He has since returned to the magazine as a freelance book reviewer.

==Gay rights==

===&quot;A Place at the Table&quot;===

Bawer&#x27;s book &quot;A Place at the Table: The Gay Individual in American Society&quot; (1993) was published by Simon &amp; Schuster. He described it in its first pages as &quot;a reflection on the theme of homosexuality&quot;, motivated by the fact that current debates had &quot;generated a lot more heat than light&quot;. The book, which criticized both heterosexuals&#x27; antigay prejudices and the political and cultural stereotypes which, in his view, were foisted on many gay people by the &quot;queer subculture&quot;, received much attention. Reviews in mainstream media tended to be positive, while, as Bawer himself later put it, &quot;antigay conservatives and queer lefties alike savaged the book&quot;

Author and attorney Dale Carpenter later summed up the response of many gay publications: &quot;In a year-end roundup of gay-themed books for 1993, one critic for San Francisco&#x27;s Bay Area Reporter called the book &#x27;terrible,&#x27; but nevertheless &#x27;important&#x27; because of its widespread impact. Gay professor and author David Bergman chided Bawer for allegedly failing to appreciate &#x27;the great spectacle of human difference,&#x27; but acknowledged that Bawer had expressed &#x27;what many people feel.&#x27;&quot;

The book received positive reviews by James P. Pinkerton in &quot;Newsday&quot;, John Fink in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; , David Link in &quot;Reason&quot;, and Lee Dembart in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt gave the book a mixed review. In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Jonathan Yardley, too, found the book &quot;imperfect.&quot;

More conservative voices included Margaret O&#x27;Brien Steinfels of the Catholic magazine &quot;Commonweal&quot;, who, in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, described the book as &quot;a model polemic&quot; and admired Bawer&#x27;s &quot;efforts to be fair and balanced&quot;. Yet she rejected Bawer&#x27;s call for same-sex marriage, arguing that insisting on it &quot;is likely to prove... explosive&quot;. Gay-rights opponent Maggie Gallagher, while calling the book &quot;fascinating&quot;, criticized Bawer for being dissatisfied with &quot;mere tolerance&quot;. Helle Bering-Jensen, in the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, sounded a similar note, arguing that while most Americans &quot;are quite happy to let other folks live the lives they please&quot;, many &quot;draw the line... at gays in the military, gay marriages, gay parenting and so forth&quot;.

&quot;A Place at the Table&quot; was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award in the category of Gay Men&#x27;s Studies and was named a Notable Book of the Year by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which described it as a &quot;sharply argued polemic&quot;.

In a 1999 article, &quot;A Book that Made a Difference&quot;, author and attorney Dale Carpenter noted that &quot;No author better crystallized this deep and widespread yearning than Bruce Bawer in... A Place at the Table, the decade&#x27;s most important book on the gay movement.&quot; In a 2019 article commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Stonewall riots, James Kirchick referred to &quot;A Place at the Table&quot; as &quot;the integrationist founding text&quot;.

===Gay issues: Other writings and activities===

On an episode of the &quot;Charlie Rose Show&quot; marking the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, Bawer took part in a discussion with fellow gay moderate Andrew Sullivan and gay-left writers Tony Kushner and Donna Minkowitz. Minkowitz underlined the conflict between the two sides of the gay-rights movement by saying: &quot;We don&#x27;t want a place at the table! We want to turn the table over!&quot; A New York Public Library lecture by Bawer, also marking the 25th anniversary of Stonewall, appeared in abbreviated form as a cover story in the &quot;New Republic&quot;. In a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bawer criticized an editorial that ran on the morning of the Stonewall 25 gay-pride march. The editors chided &quot;gay moderates and conservatives&quot; for seeking &quot;to assure the country that the vast majority of gay people are &#x27;regular&#x27; people just like the folks next door&quot;. Bawer retorted, in part: &quot;Well, most gays do live next door to straight people... we&#x27;re not putting down cross-dressers or leathermen or anyone else; we&#x27;re simply refuting an extremely misleading stereotype.&quot; After the publication of &quot;A Place at the Table&quot;, Bawer wrote widely about gay life, culture, and politics. From 1994 to 1999, he was a regular columnist for &quot;The Advocate&quot;, the gay newsmagazine. His Advocate columns and other articles by Bawer on gay issues were later collected in an e-book, &quot;The Marrying Kind&quot;.

In 1994, reviewing Robb Forman Dew&#x27;s book &quot;The Family Heart: A Memoir of When Our Son Came Out&quot;, Bawer praised the book but added: &quot;To be gay is to yearn for a time when it won&#x27;t be necessary for mothers to write sensitive books about their children&#x27;s coming out.&quot; Reviewing a book by Urvashi Vaid in 1995, Bawer argued that &quot;while more and more gay people&quot; were seeking a gay-rights movement focused on &quot;integration, education and conciliation&quot;, Vaid wished &quot;to return to the day of class struggle and liberation fronts&quot;. The fact that &quot;her rhetoric has come to seem so old so fast&quot;, he concluded, &quot;is a measure of how gay political discourse outside the academy, anyway—has been profoundly altered in a relatively brief time&quot;. Bawer explicitly called for same-sex marriage in a March 1996 &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed. In June 1997, he expressed concern that so-called &quot;morning-after&quot; treatments for possible HIV infection could result in &quot;increased carelessness&quot; by at-risk individuals. In January 2001, he urged the Bush administration in a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed &quot;to take substantive action on behalf of gays&quot;, arguing that the U.S. government was &quot;now lagging behind the American people on gay issues&quot;.

Bawer commented frequently on the treatment of gays in the films and TV. In a March 10, 1996, Times article, Bawer argued that while new films from Britain, the Netherlands, France, and Germany provided fresh, human treatments of gay people, most Hollywood movies about gays continued to be timid, banal, and formulaic. On April 14, 1996, Bawer said on the CBS Evening News, apropos of the new movie &quot;The Birdcage&quot;, that &quot;A good farce has one foot in reality. A gay person going to see this movie realizes this movie doesn&#x27;t have a single foot in reality.&quot; Martin Walker in &quot;The Guardian&quot; cited Bawer&#x27;s complaint about the makers of &quot;The Birdcage&quot;: &quot;They don&#x27;t get gay life. They don&#x27;t get anything, outside of a narrow Hollywood idea of gay life. These characters have no dignity, nor pride.&quot; Bawer was a major subject of Angela D. Dillard&#x27;s 2001 book &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner Now? Multicultural Conservatism in America&quot;. Reviewing it for &quot;Salon&quot;, he described it as a book written from &quot;the heart of Academic Country, where the very existence of conservatives who are not straight white males can indeed generate horror and confusion (or, alternatively, amusement, perhaps bordering on clinical hysteria), and where, as surely as a multiplicity of genders, skin colors, ethnic backgrounds and sexual orientations is the collective dream, a multiplicity of viewpoints is the collective nightmare&quot;. He described Dillard&#x27;s account of &quot;gay conservative&quot; as ill-informed and criticized her for, among other things, including him on &quot;a list of people who have &#x27;sided with the Religious Right&#x27;—even though I wrote &quot;Stealing Jesus&quot; (1997), which indicts fundamentalism as a betrayal of Christianity&quot;.

Bawer&#x27;s prominence in the gay-rights commentariat drew the ire of some leftists. Peter Kurth complained at &quot;Salon&quot; on November 30, 1998, that &quot;Bruce Bawer, Gabriel Rotello, Michelangelo Signorile, and the inevitable Larry Kramer have, with [Andrew] Sullivan and a few others, secured a virtual lock on gay commentary in the American media.&quot; Paul Robinson&#x27;s book &quot;Queer Wars: The New Gay Right and Its Critics&quot;, published by the University of Chicago in 2005, devoted the first of its three chapters to an analysis and critique of Bawer&#x27;s writings on gay issues.

===&quot;Beyond Queer&quot;===

The Free Press published the anthology &quot;Beyond Queer: Challenging Gay Left Orthodoxy&quot; in 1996. Edited by Bawer, it included essays by John W. Berresford, David Boaz, Stephen H. Chapman, Mel Dahl, David Link, Carolyn Lochhead, Daniel Mendelsohn, Stephen H. Miller, Jonathan Rauch, Andrew Sullivan, Paul Varnell, Norah Vincent, and John Weir, as well as Bawer. &quot;Booklist&quot; called it one of the &quot;outstanding anthologies&quot; of 1996&quot;, saying that it &quot;marks the end of radical dominance in gay politics and culture&quot; and &quot;the beginning of a pragmatic and democratic approach to gay issues&quot;. Ron Hayes, writing in &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot;, called it &quot;complex, unsettling and thought provoking&quot; and maintained that &quot;No straight person who reads these essays will ever assume all gays are liberal again. And no gay person will ever assume that all conservatives are his enemy, either.&quot;

&quot;Beyond Queer&quot; was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award in the category of Nonfiction Anthology.
Looking back on the book in 2007, James Kirchick of the &quot;New Republic&quot; said that it had been &quot;perhaps the most important work of gay nonfiction since Randy Shilts&#x27; &quot;And the Band Played On&quot;&quot;.

===&quot;House &amp; Home&quot;===

In 1996, Dutton published &quot;House and Home,&quot; the memoir of Steve Gunderson, a gay Republican Congressman from Wisconsin, and Gunderson&#x27;s partner, Rob Morris. Gunderson and Morris wrote the book with Bawer. A reviewer in &quot;The Hill&quot; called the book &quot;powerful&quot;.

==Christianity==

===&quot;Stealing Jesus&quot;===

In his book &quot;Stealing Jesus: How Fundamentalism Betrays Christianity&quot; (1997), Bawer stated, in the words of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;that fundamentalist Christianity... has been preaching a message of wrath and judgment&quot; that &quot;is incompatible with Jesus&#x27; message of love&quot;. While criticizing &quot;Bawer&#x27;s sometimes strident tone&quot;, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said that his &quot;graceful prose and lucid insights make this a must-read book for anyone concerned with the relationship of Christianity to contemporary American culture&quot;. Walter Kendrick, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, noted that like &quot;A Place at the Table&quot;, &quot;Stealing Jesus&quot; was an &quot;alarm bell&quot;, in this case about Christian fundamentalism. Although Kendrick complained that, Bawer&#x27;s hopes to the contrary, there was &quot;no hope of converting the fundamentalists&quot;, he concluded that the book might &quot;prove of value simply for its clear exposition of what today&#x27;s American &#x27;fundamentalists&#x27; believe and want to do&quot;.

The response of fundamentalist Protestants and traditional Catholics to the book was more critical. &quot;The thesis of &quot;Stealing Jesus&quot; is an antinomian heresy rooted in gnostic dualism about the flesh and spirit&quot;, pronounced Catholic priest George W. Rutler in &quot;National Review&quot;, suggesting that &quot;Bawer could some day write something about the real Church, if he read St. Francis de Sales&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on the Love of God&quot;, spent a few days in Lourdes, and quieted down with a good cigar.&quot;

&quot;Stealing Jesus&quot; was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award in the category of Spirituality/Religion.

===Christianity: Other writings and activities===

Bawer has written widely on religious topics. In an April 1996 article for the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot;, he reported on the heresy trial in the Episcopal Church over the ordination of gay clergy. In a 1997 &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, he discussed what he saw as &quot;the growing divide between North and South in American Protestantism and the declining significance of denominational distinctions&quot;. In a 1998 article about Robert Duvall&#x27;s film &quot;The Apostle&quot;, Bawer expressed surprise &quot;that a movie with such a dark, realistic texture... should candy-coat the religious subculture in which it is set&quot;. In a 1998 review of New York Episcopal Bishop Paul Moore″s autobiography, Bawer described him as &quot;a more complex figure than the privileged lefty portrayed by his critics&quot;.

==Europe==

Bawer moved from the U.S. to Europe in 1998, in part, as he later explained, because his long-term exposure to Christian fundamentalism via &quot;Stealing Jesus&quot; had drawn him to the purportedly more liberal life in Western Europe. In a 2004 &quot;New York Times&quot; article about American attitudes toward Europe, Richard Bernstein quoted a recent &quot;Hudson Review&quot; essay in which Bawer said, in Bernstein&#x27;s paraphrase, &quot;that for a time he thought about writing a book lamenting American anti-intellectualism, indifference to foreign languages and academic achievement, and susceptibility to trash TV&quot;, but in the end &quot;didn&#x27;t write that book... because he discovered that Europe wasn&#x27;t so comparatively fantastic after all&quot;.

After moving to Europe, Bawer contributed a number of travel articles to &quot;The New York Times&quot; about destinations in Norway and the Netherlands. He has also written scores of articles about the rise of Islam on the continent, the earliest being &quot;Tolerating Intolerance&quot;, which appeared in 2002 in &quot;Partisan Review&quot;.

===&quot;While Europe Slept&quot;===

Bawer&#x27;s book &quot;While Europe Slept: How Radical Islam is Destroying the West from Within&quot; (2006) concerns his belief in the threat that the rise of Islam in Europe poses to liberal values. Once established in Western European nations, Bawer maintains, Muslims avoid integration and answer only to sharia law, while avoiding the legal systems of their host nations, allowing abuse of women and gays, as well as Jews and other non-Muslims. In his conclusion, Bawer states that rising birthrates among Muslims and their &quot;refusal&quot; to integrate will allow them to dominate European society within 30 years, and that the only way to avoid such a disaster is to abolish the politically correct and multicultural doctrines that, according to him, are rife within the continent.

James Kirchick of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote that the book confirmed Bawer&#x27;s &quot;intellectual consistency; witnessing American religious fundamentalism, he moved to more socially liberal Europe only to find that Europeans&#x27; vaunted cultural tolerance was overlooking a strain of Islamist religious fundamentalism that puts Jerry Falwell to shame&quot;.

&quot;While Europe Slept&quot; was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award for 2006 in the criticism category, which led to controversy. Eliot Weinberger, one of the board members of the Circle, stated when he presented the list of nominations that Bawer&#x27;s book was an example of &quot;racism as criticism&quot;. The President of the Circle, John Freeman, declared: &quot;I have never been more embarrassed by a choice than I have been with Bruce Bawer&#x27;s &quot;While Europe Slept&quot;&quot;, and claimed that &quot;[I]ts hyperventilated rhetoric tips from actual critique into Islamophobia.&quot; J. Peder Zane, a member on the nomination committee, said that Weinberger &quot;was completely unfair to Bruce Bawer&quot; and insulting to the committee.

&quot;While Europe Slept&quot; was translated into Spanish, Danish, Dutch, and Portuguese, and was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. Bawer discussed the book in a half-hour interview on &quot;Bill Moyers Journal&quot;. He has also talked about Islam on such programs as &quot;The Michael Coren Show&quot; in Canada and at various conferences in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.

===&quot;Surrender&quot;===

In &quot;Surrender: Appeasing Islam, Sacrificing Freedom&quot; (2009), Bawer argued &quot;that people throughout the Western world—in reaction to such events as the Danish cartoon riots and the murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh—are surrendering to fear&quot; and thus censoring themselves and others and &quot;refus[ing] to criticize even the most illiberal aspects of Islamic culture&quot;, thereby &quot;undermin[ing] the values of individual liberty and equality on which our nation was founded&quot;. Ray Olson of Booklist called the book &quot;Sublimely literate&quot; and &quot;urgent&quot;. Martin Sieff in the &quot;Washington Times&quot; found it &quot;alarming, depressing, brilliant and remarkably courageous&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot; Book Review, Stephen Pollard said that the book was, &quot;at times, hard going&quot;, partly &quot;because of the level of detail Bawer offers in support of his argument&quot; and partly because &quot;Bawer is unquestionably correct, and that fact is quite simply terrifying.&quot; Like &quot;While Europe Slept&quot;, the book is considered part of the &quot;Eurabia genre&quot;.

===&quot;The Victims&#x27; Revolution&quot;===

Bawer&#x27;s book &quot;The Victims&#x27; Revolution&quot; (2012) concerned the rise of identity studies in American universities. Identity studies, according to Bawer, reduce the human experience to ideologically charged jargon about power relationships among groups. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said that while Bawer&#x27;s &quot;critique seldom engages seriously with the intellectual content of the field&quot;, his book was &quot;a lively, cantankerous takedown of a juicy target&quot; that scored &quot;lots of entertaining points against the insufferable posturing and unreadable prose that pervades identity studies&quot;. Sohbab Ahmari, in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, praised the book for its exposure of relativism on campus, while Andrew Delbanco, in &quot;The New York Times&quot; Book Review, found Bawer&#x27;s complaints outdated, arguing that universities, in Delbanco&#x27;s view, are returning to traditional subjects. &quot;National Review&quot;″s Jay Nordlinger, on the other hand, praised the book&#x27;s &quot;wonderfulness&quot; and wrote: &quot;I wish people would read The Victims&#x27; Revolution. I especially wish it of students and others in academia.&quot;

===Islam: Other writings and activities===

After moving to Europe, Bawer worked for a time as a columnist and translator for the website of Human Rights Service, an Oslo-based think tank focused on immigration and integration issues. He has also written for &quot;FrontPage Magazine&quot; websites, for &quot;City Journal&quot;, for the Gatestone Institute website, and on his blog. &quot;The New Quislings: How the International Left Used the Oslo Massacre to Silence Debate about Islam&quot; (2012) is an e-book by Bawer about the aftermath of the mass murders committed by Anders Behring Breivik on July 22, 2011. Bawer and his authorship has been regarded as a central part of the counter-jihad movement.

===Later books===
In 2017, Bawer published &quot;The Alhambra: A Novel of Islam in Europe&quot;. In 2019 Bawer published a short book called &quot;A Marriage Made at the Copa&quot;, about his parents, and two collections of essays entitled &quot;Islam&quot; and &quot;So Far&quot;.

<doc id="897182" wikidata="Q2745246" url="?curid=897182" title="Hurricane Charley">
<text>Hurricane Charley was the first of four separate hurricanes to impact or strike Florida during 2004, along with Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, as well as one of the strongest hurricanes ever to strike the United States. It was the third named storm, the second hurricane, and the second major hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Charley lasted from August 9 to 15, and at its peak intensity it attained winds, making it a strong Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale. It made landfall in Southwest Florida at maximum strength, becoming the strongest hurricane to hit the United States since Hurricane Andrew struck Florida in 1992 and tied with Hurricane Ian as the strongest hurricane to hit southwest Florida in recorded history.

After moving slowly through the Caribbean, Charley crossed Cuba on Friday, August 13, as a Category 3 hurricane, causing heavy damage and four deaths. That same day, it crossed over the Dry Tortugas, just 22 hours after Tropical Storm Bonnie had struck northwestern Florida. It was the first time in history that two tropical cyclones struck the same state within a 24-hour period. At its peak intensity of , Hurricane Charley struck the northern tip of Captiva Island and the southern tip of North Captiva Island, before crossing over Bokeelia causing severe damage. Charley then continued to produce severe damage as it made landfall on the peninsula in Punta Gorda. It continued to the north-northeast along the Peace River corridor, devastating Punta Gorda, Port Charlotte, Cleveland, Fort Ogden, Nocatee, Arcadia, Zolfo Springs, Sebring, Lake Placid, and Wauchula. Zolfo Springs was isolated for nearly two days as large trees, power poles, power lines, transformers, and debris filled the streets. Wauchula sustained gusts to ; buildings in the downtown areas caved onto Main Street.

The storm passed through the central and eastern parts of the Orlando metropolitan area, carrying winds gusting up to . The city of Winter Park, north of Orlando, also sustained considerable damage since its many old, large oak trees had not experienced high winds. Falling trees tore down power utilities and smashed cars, and their huge roots lifted underground water and sewer utilities. The storm slowed as it exited the state over Ormond Beach just north of Daytona Beach. The storm was absorbed by a front in the Atlantic Ocean shortly after sunrise on August 15, near southeastern Massachusetts.

Charley was initially expected to hit further north in Tampa and caught many Floridians off-guard due to the storm turning toward the Florida peninsula sooner than anticipated, within six hours before landfall. Along its path, Charley caused 10 deaths and $16.9 billion in damage to insured residential property, making it the second costliest hurricane in United States history at the time. Charley was a compact, fast-moving storm, which limited the scope and severity of the damage.

== Meteorological history ==

Charley began as a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on August 4. It moved quickly westward and steadily organized over the open Atlantic Ocean, with convection developing in curved bands. The wave continued to develop as it approached the Lesser Antilles, and became Tropical Depression Three on August 9 while 115 mi (185 km) south-southeast of Barbados, near the island of Grenada, however, the threat to Barbados was short-lived. Low upper-level wind shear and well-defined outflow contributed to further intensification, and the depression strengthened on August 10, despite being located in the eastern Caribbean, which is an area not particularly suited to tropical cyclogenesis. At this time, the National Hurricane Center in Miami designated the name &quot;Charley&quot;.

A strong ridge of high pressure to the system&#x27;s north forced Charley to change track quickly to the west-northwest. It continued to strengthen and became a Category 1 hurricane on August 11, while south of Kingston, Jamaica. The storm was being steered around the periphery of the high pressure area, and as a result, Charley changed direction toward the northwest. The following day, the core passed southwest of Jamaica, affecting the island on August 11 and 12. The storm then passed northeast of Grand Cayman, reaching Category 2 status just after passing the island. The hurricane continued to strengthen as it turned to the northwest and rounded the southwest portion of the subtropical ridge, becoming a major hurricane—a storm classified as a Category 3 hurricane or higher—just before making landfall on southern Cuba. Charley came ashore near Punta Cayamas with maximum sustained winds of and gusts of up to , at about 0430 UTC on August 13. It crossed the island, passing about west of downtown Havana before weakening to .
After crossing Cuba near Menelao Mora, Hurricane Charley accelerated to the north-northeast, toward the southwest coast of Florida in response to the approach of an unseasonal mid-tropospheric trough. Charley passed over the Dry Tortugas at 1200 UTC on August 13, with maximum winds of about . The strike occurred only 22 hours after Tropical Storm Bonnie made landfall on St. Vincent Island, marking the first time two tropical cyclones hit the same state within a 24-hour period. Then Charley explosively intensified, strengthening from a hurricane with a minimum central barometric pressure of to a hurricane with a pressure of in just three hours. It continued to strengthen as it turned more to the northeast, and made landfall near the island of Cayo Costa, Florida as a Category 4 hurricane with a pressure of at approximately 1945 UTC on August 13. An hour later, the hurricane struck Punta Gorda as a storm and then passed up through Port Charlotte and the Charlotte Harbor. However, the eye had shrunk before landfall, limiting the most powerful winds to an area within of the center.

Charley weakened considerably due to its passage over land, but still retained sustained winds of about as it passed directly over Orlando between 0020 and 0140 UTC August 14; gusts of up to were recorded at Orlando International Airport. It cut a swath of destruction across Florida, also passing near Kissimmee. The hurricane reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing directly over New Smyrna Beach as a Category 1 hurricane, but restrengthened slightly over open waters. Continuing to move rapidly to the north-northeast, Charley struck near Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, South Carolina as an hurricane, moved offshore briefly, and made its final landfall near North Myrtle Beach as a minimal hurricane, with winds of . Charley then began interacting with an approaching frontal boundary, becoming a tropical storm over southeastern North Carolina. After moving back into the Atlantic Ocean near Virginia Beach on August 15, the storm became extratropical and became embedded in the frontal zone. The extratropical storm continued to move rapidly to the northeast, and was completely absorbed by the front shortly after sunrise on August 15, near southeastern Massachusetts.

== Preparations ==

=== Caribbean ===
==== Jamaica ====
On August 10, the National Hurricane Center (NHC), based in Miami, Florida, issued a tropical storm watch for the entire island of Jamaica as Tropical Storm Charley intensified over the eastern Caribbean. Later that day, the watch was upgraded to a warning as the storm quickly approached the island. Early on August 11, a hurricane watch was declared for the island as Charley neared hurricane intensity. Late on August 11, all watches and warnings for Jamaica were changed to hurricane warnings as Charley attained Category 1 status on the Saffir–Simpson scale. The warning was later discontinued on August 12 as Hurricane Charley tracked towards Cuba, no longer a threat to Jamaica.

Following the issuance of hurricane watches, Robert Pickersgill, Minister of Transport and Works in Jamaica closed both airports, Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport, on the island and shut down all ports. A total of 33 flights were canceled or delayed by the storm. Roughly 3,000 passengers from the &quot;Carnival Conquest&quot; cruise ship were diverted from their scheduled arrival in Montego Bay, resulting in millions of dollars in losses. Another cruise ship, &quot;The Triumph&quot;, carrying 2,700 passengers was also diverted. Most businesses on the island were closed on August 12. Emergency shelters were set up across the island ahead of the storm; however, press reports indicate that no one sought refuge in shelters. Residents along the coast were urged to evacuate by the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management due to the risk of storm surge and large swells that could inundate low-lying communities. Up to of rain fell in eastern portions of the island, triggering mudslides.

On August 11, the Jamaica Red Cross opened its Emergency Operations Center in preparation for Hurricane Charley and placed the warning level at one, the lowest warning level. Residents throughout the country stocked up on emergency supplies and non-perishable food, noted by an increase in sales at shops. In Saint James Parish, emergency officials activated all necessary agencies by August 11. Late on August 11, emergency officials quickly opened 50 shelters in the parish. In Saint Elizabeth Parish, 100 residents sought refuge in the six shelters opened throughout the parish. A total of $1.5 million (JMD; US$17,000) was allocated by the Ministry of Local Government for repairs after the storm. The Jamaica Red Cross alerted local branches to be prepared as Charley approached.

==== Other areas ====
Cuban government officials issued a hurricane watch for the southern coastline on August 11, two days before the hurricane struck the island. This was upgraded to a hurricane warning on the 12th, 13 ½ hours before Charley made landfall. Because of the threat, the government issued a mandatory evacuation for 235,000 citizens and 159,000 animals in the area of the expected impact. An additional 3,800 residents were evacuated from offshore islands, while 47,000 in Havana were transported from old, unsafe buildings to safer areas. The people were transported to shelters provisioned with supplies. In addition, the power grid in southern Cuba was turned off to avoid accidents.

The Cayman Islands issued a hurricane warning on August 11, a day before the hurricane passed near the archipelago.

=== United States ===
==== Florida ====

On August 11, Florida governor Jeb Bush issued a state of emergency declaration due to the impending threat Charley presented to the state while the storm was still located south of Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center issued hurricane warnings for the Florida Keys and from Cape Sable to the mouth of the Suwannee River a day prior to Charley&#x27;s passage through the state, while tropical storm warnings were issued elsewhere throughout Florida. Because of the threat, 1.9 million people along the Florida west coast were urged to evacuate, including 380,000 residents in the Tampa Bay area, and 11,000 in the Florida Keys. It was the largest evacuation order for Pinellas County history, and the largest evacuation request in Florida since Hurricane Floyd five years before. Many Floridians remained despite the evacuation order, as authorities estimated that up to a million people would not go to shelters; instead, these residents boarded up their homes and bought supplies to ride out the storm. However, about 1.42 million people evacuated their homes in Florida, and approximately 50,000 residents were placed in shelters throughout the state. Power companies mobilized workers to prepare for the expected widespread power outages. MacDill Air Force Base, home of U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) and the U.S. military center for the Iraq War, severely limited its staff on base, shifting most of its operations to its forward headquarters in Doha, Qatar. Similarly, Kennedy Space Center, which usually counts with 13,000 on-site personnel, reduced its staff to only 200 people in preparation for the hurricane, and secured all Space Shuttles by sealing them in their hangars. Many amusement parks in the Orlando area closed early, and Walt Disney World&#x27;s Animal Kingdom remained closed. This was only the second time in history that a Disney park was closed due to a hurricane, with the other occurrence being after Hurricane Floyd. The approaching hurricane also forced several cruise ships to reroute their paths, and forced rail service between Miami and New York to shut down.

The rapid strengthening of Charley in the eastern Gulf of Mexico caught many by surprise. Around five hours before its Florida landfall, Charley was a strong Category 2 hurricane predicted to strengthen its strongest winds to upon its landfall in the Tampa–Saint Petersburg area. About two hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a special advisory, notifying the public that Charley had become a Category 4 hurricane, with a predicted landfall location in the Port Charlotte area. As a result of this change in forecast, numerous people in the Charlotte County area were unprepared for the hurricane, although the new track prediction was well within the previous forecast&#x27;s margin of error. National Hurricane Center marine forecaster Robbie Berg publicly blamed the media for misleading residents into believing that a Tampa landfall was inevitable. He also stated that residents of Port Charlotte had ample warning, as a hurricane warning had been issued for the landfall area 23 hours before, and a hurricane watch had existed for 35 hours.

Several local meteorologists, however, did depart from the official predictions of a Tampa Bay landfall as early as the morning of August 13. Jim Farrell of WINK, Robert Van Winkle WBBH, Steve Jerve of WFLA in Tampa, Jim Reif of WZVN in Fort Myers, and Tom Terry of WFTV in Orlando all broke with their national news forecasts and stated at around 1500 UTC that Charley was going to turn early, striking around Charlotte Harbor and traveling over Orlando, as would prove to be the case.

==== North Carolina ====

On August 13, 2004, a tropical storm watch was issued for Cape Fear, southward to South Carolina. The watch was extended northward to Oregon Inlet later that day; the watch further extended to Chincoteague, Virginia. The tropical storm watch from Cape Lookout to Oregon Inlet was changed to a hurricane warning. A hurricane watch was subsequently put into effect for coastal areas from Oregon Inlet to the North Carolina/Virginia border, although by August 15 all advisories were discontinued. Flood watches were also placed into effect for portions of the state.

Governor Mike Easley declared a state of emergency in advance of the storm, and 200 National Guard troops were dispatched to Charlotte, Raleigh, Kinston and Lumerton, while 800 more were on standby. On Ocracoke Island, authorities ordered mandatory evacuations, while on Bogue Banks voluntary evacuations were in place. Officials in Wrightsville Beach drove along the streets with loudspeakers mounted on trucks, warning tourists that a storm was approaching. The storm forced the University of North Carolina at Wilmington to suspend a planned opening for students moving into residence halls. Campgrounds at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore were closed by the National Park Service and three boat ramps were closed. Duke Power Co. prepared for Charley by lowering the level of hydroelectric lakes to make room for excessive rainfall. The state Department of Environment and Natural Resources advised hog farmers to pump out their waste lagoon. About 60 Red Cross shelters were opened during the storm and during the peak of Charley, and roughly 1,600 people sought protection.

==== South Carolina ====
Prior to the storm, a tropical storm watch was issued for locations from the Altamaha sound, Georgia to the South Santee River on August 12. The next day, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane watch from the Altamaha sound to the South Carolina–Georgia border. As Charley approached the region, a hurricane warning was issued for the entire area. A tornado watch was issued eastward from a line extending from Aiken to Lancaster County.

Governor Mark Sanford declared a state of emergency as Charley approached landfall and issued a mandatory evacuation for residents on barrier islands and in coastal locations in counties Georgetown and Horry. In Georgetown County, this order was focused on residents and tourists east of U.S. Route 17, likewise for Horry County. 180,000 people evacuated the Grand Strand. Drawbridges in Beaufort and Charleston Counties were shut down, and bridges in Georgetown and Horry Counties were locked down. Hampton County requested 2,000 sandbags, that were provided by the Department of Corrections. The Wateree Correctional Institution also filled 30,000 sandbags for potential floods. State troopers directed traffic inland from Myrtle Beach. U.S. Route 501 used a lane reversal to allow for evacuations.

==== Other areas ====
Following the Florida landfall, Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue declared a state of emergency as a precaution against a storm surge and price gouging.

== Impact ==

One death in Jamaica, four deaths in Cuba, and ten deaths in the United States were directly attributed to Charley. Numerous injuries were reported, as well as 25 indirect deaths in the U.S.

Property damage from Charley in the United States was estimated by the NHC to be $16 billion. At the time, this figure made Charley the second costliest hurricane in United States history, behind 1992&#x27;s Hurricane Andrew&#x27;s $27.3 billion.

=== Caribbean ===

==== Jamaica ====
On August 11, a yacht carrying three people was disabled roughly southeast of the Morant Cays. The Jamaica Defence Force Coast Guard rescued the crew members the following day and brought them to Kingston Public Hospital as they were severely dehydrated and exhausted. During the preparations, storms ahead of the hurricane knocked out power in isolated areas. After nearly completing restoration of the initial power outage, lightning struck a power line and left more residents without electricity.

The community of Big Woods was significantly affected by flooding, with 30 families being isolated in the area. The only fatality from the storm also occurred in this community after a man was washed away while trying to rescue a family. The severity of damage in Big Woods prompted Jamaica Labour Party Area Council Four chairman to state that it should be declared a disaster area. Torrential rains during a two-hour span overnight triggered most of the flooding in the area, isolating many homes and inundating several. In Westmoreland Parish, severe flooding inundated several homes and damaged roadways. One home sustained significant damage after a large tree fell on it. In Kingston, high winds damaged power lines and some homes. Water supply to most regions was cut due to damage to pipelines and high water turbidity. Widespread power outages occurred due to numerous downed trees and power lines.

The banana industry sustained severe losses, with trees downed and fruit damaged and numerous livestock drowned in flood waters. Initial assessments of agricultural losses from the storm reached $300 million (JMD; US$3.4 million). Residents requested the government for immediate assistance as families were without a source of food and income. Official assessments in four parishes placed the damage to agriculture and livestock at $88.4 million (JMD; US$1 million), with roughly $73.5 million (JMD; US$835,000) of this accounting for 750 farmers in Saint Elizabeth.

Roads in Saint Elizabeth sustained substantial damage, with 32 separate roads experiencing severe impacts. Throughout the country, a total of $7.6 million (JMD; US$86,000) was provided to repair the roads, $4.23 million (JMD; US$48,000) of which was used in Saint Elizabeth alone. Widespread damage to crops also resulted in an increased price in store costs. The loss to farmers was untimely as it followed a three-month drought that was preceded by damaging hailstorms that ruined crops. Following the storm, search and rescue teams were deployed, mainly in Saint Elizabeth Parish following reports of flooding. Throughout the country, Charley caused $4.1 million in damage and one fatality.

==== Cuba ====

Operationally, forecasters estimated that Charley struck southern Cuba with winds of . In post-hurricane-season analysis, Charley was determined to have struck southern Cuba with winds of hurricane; the original estimate was revised based on a report of a sustained wind measurement of in Playa Baracoa, meaning Charley was a major hurricane at landfall. The hurricane produced a storm surge of up to in Playa Cajio; on the other hand, Charley&#x27;s quick passage caused small amounts of precipitation, with the largest total being in Mariel.

Strong wind gusts downed nearly 1,500 power lines and knocked over 28 large high tension wire towers at a power plant in Mariel. As a result, more than half of the electricity customers in Havana Province were left without power for 12 days after the storm, and all of Pinar del Río Province was without power for over 11 days. Blackouts continued in areas where power returned. The power outages resulted in lack of drinking water for numerous people, including no potable water in the city of Havana for four days. As a result, the Cuban government sent water tanks to satisfy the short term need. Similarly, there was a lack of gas for cooking for over a week. However, one Cuban government official stated that it could take up to two months for basic utilities to be returned to many isolated villages.

Near its landfall location, Charley destroyed 290 of the 300 houses in the village, while over 70,000 homes in Havana were either damaged or destroyed. Numerous hotels reported damage, potentially impacting the important tourism industry in the country. Agricultural damage was heavy, with the hurricane damaging more than 3,000 agricultural institutions. Citrus officials estimated a loss of 15,000 metric tons of grapefruit on the Isle of Youth, while strong winds ruined 66,000 metric tons of citrus trees in the Havana area. Charley also destroyed around 57,000 acres (230 km2) of fruit trees in the Havana area. Approximately 95% of the sugar cane, bean, and banana crops were affected in Cuban territory. In all, Charley was directly responsible for four deaths in Cuba, and was responsible for $923 million in property damage, primarily from agricultural losses.

==== Cayman Islands ====
In spite of the close approach that Charley made on the Cayman Islands, the islands were mostly spared, and were subjected to little damage. Rainfall was light, peaking at in Grand Cayman, while Cayman Brac reported tropical storm force winds.

=== United States ===
==== Florida ====

Hurricane Charley severely affected the state of Florida. There were nine direct fatalities, 20 indirect fatalities, and numerous injuries attributed to the storm. Property damage was estimated at $5.4 billion, and approximately $285 million in agricultural damage. However, due to Charley&#x27;s speed (it crossed the Florida peninsula in approximately seven hours) and small size, rainfall along the eyewall was mostly limited to .

While moving northward to the west of the Florida Keys, Charley produced moderate winds of with gusts to in Key West. The winds toppled a few trees, power lines, and unreinforced signs. A boat, knocked loose by strong waves, struck a power transmission line, causing widespread power outages from Marathon to Key West. On Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas, the hurricane produced an estimated storm surge of up to . The surge, combined with incoming waves, caused extensive flooding in the park and damaged numerous docks. In spite of this, property damage was minimal in the area, totaling $160,000.
Hurricane Charley passed directly over Captiva Island near Cayo Costa with peak winds of . The Category 4 hurricane produced an estimated storm surge of up to on the island, which is lower than expected for a storm of its intensity. The decrease in the height of the surge was due to the hurricane&#x27;s small size and its rapid intensification just prior to landfall. Furthermore, the storm surge, combined with the strong pressure gradient, produced a inlet on North Captiva Island, known as Charley&#x27;s Cut. Strong waves and storm surge caused severe beach erosion and dune damage at various locations. The storm severely damaged five houses, lightly damaged many others, and downed many trees on Gasparilla Island. At least half of the 300 homes on North Captiva Island were substantially damaged, including ten that were destroyed. On Captiva Island, the strong winds severely damaged most houses, as well as several recreational buildings.

The city of Arcadia in DeSoto County saw extreme damage, despite being relatively further inland. About 95% of the buildings in the downtown area saw some sort of damage. The only shelter in the town had its roof torn open by the wind, leaving 3,500 evacuees inside unprotected from the onslaught of the storm.

Hardee County saw property damage estimated at $750 million, along with six injuries, but no deaths were reported. Charley caused blackouts in the entire county, as well as damage to 3,600 homes and the destruction of 1,400. A radio tower near Sebring was toppled, along with numerous trees and power poles along the north and east side of Highlands County. Additionally, there were several reports of severely damaged homes in Polk County near Babson Park and Avon Park. In Lake Wales, Florida, a sand mine lake encroached into State Road 60 due to wave action and swallowed a car. Additionally, Lake Wales saw 23,000 buildings damaged, as well as the destruction of 739 structures. Seven deaths were reported in the county, one of them determined to be direct.

Throughout the rest of the islands in Sarasota, Charlotte, Lee, and Collier counties, strong winds from Hurricane Charley caused severe damage to hundreds of buildings and trees. Lee County also endured an storm surge. These counties were exposed to Charley&#x27;s eyewall, so they saw the most damage. Due to its small size, the area of most intense damage was located within a band centered on Charley&#x27;s track, with additional heavy damage forming an outer band extending to each side of the inner swath of damage. In Charlotte County, 80% of buildings were damaged.

On mainland Florida, Charley produced a peak storm surge of at Vanderbilt Beach near Naples, along with a much lower surge at its Punta Gorda landfall. The hurricane dropped generally light rainfall across Florida, with the maximum amount of occurring in Bud Slough in Manatee County, east of Myakka River State Park. In Punta Gorda&#x27;s airport, where the hurricane made landfall, wind speeds of up to were measured, alongside gusts of up to , before the instrument was blown apart, along with most of the planes and the airport itself. The Charlotte Regional Medical Center recorded an unofficial peak wind gust of . In Port Charlotte, Charley&#x27;s strong winds blew off the roof of Saint Joseph&#x27;s Hospital and Fawcett Memorial Hospital. Due to the compact nature of the hurricane, the storm&#x27;s radius of maximum sustained winds only extended a short distance from its center. In comparison, Fort Myers, which is only from where Charley made landfall, experienced sustained winds of only with gusts of . In South Florida, Charley spawned several tornadoes, including a long-lived F2 that struck Clewiston, and five weak tornadoes near the point where the hurricane made landfall.

The most severe damage from Hurricane Charley occurred in Charlotte County. In Boca Grande, numerous houses sustained extensive roof damage, while thousands of trees and power lines were uprooted or snapped. In Port Charlotte and Punta Gorda, many buildings, RVs, and mobile homes were completely destroyed, while other buildings suffered roofing damage due to the powerful winds.

Charley devastated Southwest Florida, causing $14.6 billion in property damage on the peninsula of Florida alone. Many towns such as Punta Gorda and Port Charlotte were leveled by the hurricane. Trees were downed and trailer parks were obliterated as far as Ormond Beach.

Charley also caused considerable damage in the central and eastern parts of the state. Several possible tornadoes occurred, with severe thunderstorms during the duration of the storm. Winds were estimated to be at sustained near, and to the north of Okeechobee, while winds at Orlando International Airport topped out around in a gust. At Orlando International Airport, debris littered two runways and lashing winds tore the roofs off three terminals and shattered two giant glass panels in the main terminal. The winds also ripped the roof right off of Brookside Elementary in Winter Park, leaving damage to the school, as well as the school&#x27;s cafeteria. The storm caused 2 million customers to lose electricity in Florida. In some areas, power was not restored for weeks: 136,000 residents had no electricity a week after Charley&#x27;s landfall, and 22,000 customers, primarily from cooperatives, were still waiting for their service to be restored on August 26. Citizens in Daytona Beach, New Smyrna Beach, and Port Orange in Southeastern Volusia County also dealt with storm surge from the St. Johns River and Halifax River, and Intracoastal Waterway as Charley passed over before re-emerging into the Atlantic Ocean. Further inland, Seminole County experienced some of the highest winds ever recorded from a hurricane in the area, with a gust of in Longwood at 04:07 UTC on August 14 and in Altamonte Springs.

Public schools in some counties in the path of the hurricane were scheduled to be closed for two weeks. In some areas this was necessary because the school buildings were damaged or destroyed: all 59 of Osceola County&#x27;s schools were damaged, and one-third of Charlotte County&#x27;s were destroyed by Charley&#x27;s impact. DeSoto County schools saw $6 million in damage, while Orange County Public Schools saw $9 million in damage to their educational infrastructure.

Agricultural losses were heavy. In Florida, the second-largest producer of oranges in the world, damage to the citrus crop was estimated at $200 million, and caused a 50% increase in the price of grapefruit juice. Charley, along with the other storms that hit Florida during 2004, caused a total agricultural loss of $2.2 billion. Other crops, nurseries, buildings, and agricultural equipment also suffered.

==== North Carolina ====

Hurricane Charley produced moderate to heavy rainfall over the state, peaking at near Greenville; other rainfall amounts ranged from less than –more than . The outer rainbands began affecting the region in the early hours of August 14. Due to widespread debris, storm drains became clogged which left flooding in some areas. Freshwater flooding was reported in seven counties along the coastal plain. State highways 42 and 581, as well as numerous county and local roads, were covered with at least of water. Wilmington and surrounding towns were forced to close a total of 20 streets. The heavy precipitation also caused the Neuse River to swell to flood stage. A few businesses throughout the region were damaged; two in downtown Greenville and five others were flooded.

The storm produced estimated storm surge of , along with waves of up to in height. However, there were isolated reports of surge, particularly along the beaches of Brunswick County. This produced minor beach erosion along the coastline. Winds gusted from , causing minor wind damage. The hurricane spawned five weak tornadoes across the state, including an F1 in Nags Head that damaged twenty structures. Charley destroyed 40 houses and damaged 2,231, 231 severely, including 221 damaged beach homes in Sunset Beach. Damage was the greatest in Brunswick County, where wind gusts peaked at . The winds blew down chimneys and damaged a roof on one building, and ripped the siding off another. Crop damage was also heavy in Brunswick County, with 50% of the tobacco crop lost and 30% of the corn and vegetable fields destroyed. Strong winds downed trees and power lines, leaving 65,000 homes without power. Damage in North Carolina totaled to $25 million (2004 USD).

==== South Carolina ====

The strongest storm to make landfall in the state since Hurricane Hugo in 1989, Hurricane Charley struck near Cape Romain, South Carolina as an hurricane, moved offshore briefly, and made its final landfall near North Myrtle Beach as a minimal hurricane with winds of and gusts of . In Myrtle Beach, Charley also produced a storm tide that was unofficially measured to up to . With the landfalling system, five tornadoes were reported in the state. However, only two were confirmed; one moved through the Francis Marion National Forest, downing trees along its path. Storm surge ranged from , although only minor beach erosion occurred. A buoy situated southeast of Charleston recorded seas and winds.

Peak winds in the state were clocked at at the Isle of Palms. The storm spawned winds of at Folly Beach and in downtown Charleston. Trees, limbs and electrical poles were knocked down in those regions. Trees were blown onto U.S. Route 17 in Mount Pleasant, and awnings were torn off of a few structures. A total of 2,231 houses were damaged; 2317 of these were severely damaged and 40 were destroyed. Two-hundred and twenty-one of those damaged were beach front structures on Sunset Beach. Businesses had broken windows, six hotels had roof and outer wall damage. This led to $30 million (2004 USD) in hotel profit loss in Myrtle Beach, primarily along U.S. Route 17.

As dry air from northern sections of the state wrapped into the circulation of the storm, a band of convection developed along a frontal boundary stretching from Newberry northward. Widespread rainfall peaking at over fell to the west of the storm&#x27;s track. In downtown Charleston, of rainfall was reported, while in Hampton of rain fell. However, the bulk of the rainfall remained offshore. With the soil still saturated from Tropical Storm Bonnie, some flooding in low-lying areas of Charleston County occurred. Up to of water accumulated on South Carolina Route 17 and on local streets. Flash floods were also observed in Mount Pleasant. High winds spread vegetative debris, clogging storm drains and caused further flooding. A bridge in Union County washed out following rainfall from Charley and Tropical Storm Bonnie. 135,000 customers were without power, and storm damage totaled $20 million (2004 USD).

Following the storm, Progress Energy Carolinas assembled 1,200 tree and power line personnel to assist in damage recovery. Federal disaster funds were approved for the counties of Georgetown and Horry. The declaration covered damage to public property on August 14–15. The funding covered state and local government costs for debris removal and emergency services related to the hurricane.

==== Other areas ====
Tropical Storm Charley produced wind gusts of up to at Chesapeake Light in Virginia, causing scattered power outages. Rainfall was light, ranging from . Charley produced one tornado in Chesapeake and one in Virginia Beach. In Rhode Island, one man drowned in a rip current.

== Aftermath ==
=== Cuba ===
In Cuba, Hurricane Charley had disconnected the entirety Pinar del Río province from the Sistema Eléctrico Nacional (SEN). This damage to Cuba&#x27;s electricity infrastructure became part of the impetus for Cuba&#x27;s Energy Revolution campaign, which decentralized the country&#x27;s electricity infrastructure, promoted renewable energy sources, and drastically decarbonized its economy.

=== United States ===
President George W. Bush declared Florida a federal disaster area. He later reflected on the government response to Charley:

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson released $11 million in additional aid and other assistance to Florida, with $10 million to be earmarked to Head Start facilities that need repair or new supplies, another $1 million was provided to the DeSoto Memorial Hospital in Arcadia and Osceola Regional Medical Center in Kissimmee, and $200,000 would be spent to provide services to senior citizens. Across Florida, 114 food service operations and eight comfort stations were set up. FEMA opened four disaster recovery centers.

=== Retirement ===

Because of the hurricane&#x27;s effects in the United States, the name &quot;Charley&quot; was retired from the rotating lists of tropical cyclone names in the spring of 2005 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never again be used for an Atlantic basin tropical cyclone. The name was replaced with &quot;Colin&quot; for the 2010 season.

<doc id="897185" wikidata="Q7487985" url="?curid=897185" title="Shane Bond">
<text>Shane Edward Bond (born 7 June 1975) is a New Zealand cricket coach and former cricketer and present bowling coach of Rajasthan Royals, described as &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s best fast bowler since Sir Richard Hadlee&quot;, and often among the greatest fast bowlers of his era. He represented New Zealand in Test, ODI and Twenty20 International cricket and played for Canterbury in New Zealand domestic cricket and Warwickshire in English domestic cricket. A right-arm fast bowler, his fastest recorded delivery was clocked at 156.4 km/h against India in the 2003 World Cup.

Bond&#x27;s career was plagued with injuries, chiefly recurring stress fractures of the back. He had surgery in 2004 to try to prevent further injury, but it was only partially successful. In later years he suffered back problems, knee injuries and an abdominal tear. These problems, in conjunction with a late start to his fully professional cricket career, limited his appearances in both international and domestic cricket. Since his debut in the 2001/02 season, he only managed to appear in 18 Test matches for New Zealand before he retired from Test cricket in December 2009 at the age of 34.

His international career also suffered a hiatus of 18 months, due to Bond&#x27;s involvement with the Delhi Giants in the &#x27;rebel&#x27; Indian Cricket League during March 2008, which caused the New Zealand cricket board to terminate his central contract in January 2008. However, in June 2009 Bond severed ties with the rebel league and declared himself available to be selected for the national side once again. In January 2010, Bond was selected to play in the 3rd season of the Indian Premier League for the Kolkata Knight Riders. On 13 May 2010 he retired from all forms of the game and did not play in the 4th season of Indian Premier League. Brydon Coverdale on ESPNcricinfo described him as New Zealand&#x27;s best fast bowler.

Bond currently has the second best bowling strike rate of all time in Test match cricket (amongst bowlers who have bowled a minimum of 2,500 deliveries), behind George Lohmann.

==Personal life==
Bond was educated at Papanui High School. He is married to Tracey Bond and is the father of three children. Before becoming an international player he was a police officer based in Christchurch. He is a nephew of Sir Mark Solomon, chairman of Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu.

==Domestic career==

Bond made his first-class debut for Canterbury on 20 January 1997, in a match against Central Districts. He was relatively old when he made his first-class debut, at 21 years and 7 months old, and for the first few years of his career he played relatively little first-class cricket, playing only 12 matches for Canterbury in his first three seasons. His bowling figures in his first three seasons were solid but unspectacular. Bond stopped playing cricket professionally for one year after he joined the New Zealand Police in November 1999, which left him no time to pursue his cricket career. He returned to play several games for Canterbury in the 2000/01 season and had reasonable success despite his year off. He was handed his first international opportunity early in the 2001/02 season, and from then, due to injuries and international commitments he was mainly unavailable to play for Canterbury, and only appeared in eight State Championship and ten State Shield games in seven seasons.

He made a brief appearance in English county cricket in the 2002 season, representing Warwickshire in three County Championship games, finding moderate success with the ball. He returned to England to play a few matches for Hampshire in the 2008 season.

In his Indian Cricket League career, Bond appeared in seven Twenty20 games for the Delhi Giants during the March/April 2008 version of the league, but had little success, only taking two wickets at 86.50.

===Defection to ICL===

In January 2008, while recovering from an injury sustained on tour in South Africa, it was announced that Bond had signed to play for the unofficial Indian Cricket League. This jeopardised his international future, as just a few days earlier New Zealand Cricket had announced that selectors would be encouraged not to select players associated with the league. As a result, at the end of the month, it was announced that Bond&#x27;s contract with New Zealand Cricket had been terminated, as the International Cricket Council (ICC) prohibited contracted players from taking part in the ICL. Bond wrote in his book that he had no regret in playing for the ICL and stated that initially New Zealand cricket assured him he would still be able to represent New Zealand. He stated that the reason he defected was the fact that while New Zealand were giving good money it would not be enough to guarantee the future of his family once his cricket career would be over. Therefore, he earned money from the ICL which would guarantee his family&#x27;s future. He also stated that he had no regrets and that he was a &quot;victim of politics&quot; because he defected.

Once he terminated his contract with the ICL in June 2009 he returned to international cricket.

In May 2009, the Indian Cricket League announced that several players had been released from their contracts, and in June Bond confirmed to New Zealand Cricket that he had severed ties with the unofficial league, effectively making himself available to be selected for the national team. He was duly awarded a central contract for the 2009/10 season.

===Hampshire===

On 22 February 2008, Bond signed for English domestic cricket team Hampshire. Bond played four County Championship matches for the club, taking 19 wickets at a bowling average of 19.21, with best figures of 7/66 which came on debut against Sussex. This was one of Bond&#x27;s two five-wicket hauls for the club. Additionally, Bond played in three List-A matches for Hampshire, taking 3 wickets at a bowling average of 17.00, with best figures of 3–11.

===Indian Premier League===
At the auction held for the third season of the lucrative IPL, Shane Bond was one of the main attractions, with his final price being over US$750,000, because of the undisclosed tiebreaker money above the $750,000. His services were purchased by Kolkata Knight Riders, owned by Shahrukh Khan.

==International career==
Bond&#x27;s first chance at international level came early in the 2001/02 season, when, following an impressive display in a match for the New Zealand academy against the touring Australian academy, he received a call-up to the Test squad to tour Australia. His debut came in the Second Test at Hobart when he was chosen ahead of Chris Martin on account of his extra pace. He had a forgettable debut in a rain-affected match, taking one for 135 in Australia&#x27;s only innings. He fared little better in the Third Test at Perth, taking two for 154 in the match, which ended in a draw. Shortly thereafter, in the 2001–02 VB Series against Australia and South Africa, he earned a player-of-the-tournament award for taking 21 wickets in nine games.

After the tournament he suffered a foot injury, one of the many that would mar his career, but was back in action for New Zealand&#x27;s 2002 tour of the West Indies. He was the side&#x27;s top wicket taker in its first-ever series win in the Caribbean. Bond continued to bowl well, again leading the New Zealand bowling averages at the 2003 World Cup.

===Injuries===
Shortly after the tournament he suffered a stress fracture in his back, requiring a titanium rod to be inserted. While initially he planned to make a comeback in February 2004, he remained out of the side until August 2005. Bond&#x27;s remodelled bowling action proved no less lethal than its predecessor, however: in his second match back he took six wickets for 19 runs against India.

===Return===

In September 2009 he wore New Zealand colours once more, during a Twenty20 against Sri Lanka in Colombo. He worked his way back into the Test squad and had enough fuel for one final match-winning performance in the Dunedin Test against Pakistan. An abdominal tear ruled him out midway through the series before he decided to quit Tests and focus on limited-overs cricket. In January 2010 he was one of the biggest buys at the third IPL auction in Mumbai, fetching the maximum possible bid of $750,000 from the Kolkata Knight Riders.

===Achievements and awards===
Bond enjoyed strong success against Australia during his career. On 26 January 2002, he bowled New Zealand to victory over Australia, getting 5/25. In the Cricket World Cup, Bond achieved 6/23 again against Australia (New Zealand&#x27;s best bowling performance in ODIs at the time) – which including getting Ian Harvey and Brad Hogg in consecutive deliveries. Bond struggled with back problems which cause soft tissue to break. These injuries had ruled him out in a lot of international cricket in the past.

In a Test match against the West Indies, Bond took 5–69, his fourth 5-wicket haul in just 13 International Tests Matches, and went on to win the man of the match award. He stated that this was one of his best ever bowling efforts. New Zealand defeated the West Indies by 27 runs.

On 14 January 2007, Bond took a hat-trick in the last over against Australia in a One Day International at the Bellerive Oval, dismissing Cameron White, Andrew Symonds and Nathan Bracken in successive deliveries, becoming just the second New Zealand player to take a hat-trick in limited-overs international cricket, although the game was still lost by 105 runs.

Shortly Afterwards on 23 January 2007 Bond became the second-fastest bowler in history to take 100 One-Day wickets, behind Pakistan&#x27;s Saqlain Mushtaq by one match and the fastest fast bowler to reach the 100 wicket mark. Bond, however, needed 54 fewer deliveries than the Pakistani to achieve the feat, and was the fastest bowler to take 100 wickets in terms of number of deliveries bowled.

On 16 February 2007, Bond took 5–23, his fourth 5-wicket haul, in the 2007 Chappell–Hadlee Trophy. This enabled New Zealand to dismiss Australia for 149, giving the New Zealanders a 10-wicket victory over them, the Australians&#x27; heaviest one day defeat, and although he sat out the final game in the Chappell–Hadlee series, he was instrumental in the eventual 3–0 series win for the first time in Chappell–Hadlee Trophy history.

On 16 May 2007, Shane Bond was named New Zealand cricketer of the year for the 2006/2007 season and the best bowler for that season. In September Bond was named in the ICC&#x27;s best-performing Test side over the past year.

Despite attempts to have his registration cancelled, Shane Bond was given permission to sign for Hampshire in the ECB County Championship. He made his début against 2007 champions Sussex on 16 April 2008, recording figures of 7–66 in the first innings. On 27 November 2009, Bond claimed his fifth five-wicket bag for New Zealand on his first test back against Pakistan.

, Bond is the fastest New Zealand Cricketer to take 100 wickets in ODIs. He achieved this feat in 54 matches in January 2007. He is only bettered by Saqlain Mushtaq (53 matches, May 1997) and Mitchell Starc (53 matches, August 2016).

===Retirement===
In December 2009, Bond announced his retirement from Test cricket due to the injuries that had been plaguing him for years. He said he wanted to elongate his career in the Limited-Overs formats of the game. He ended his career in Test cricket taking 87 wickets in 18 matches at an average of 22.09 and at a strike rate of 38.7.

On 14 May 2010, Shane Bond announced retirement from all international cricket after the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. He is regarded as the best bowler to play for Blackcaps after the period of Hadlee.

===Playing style===
Bond was a fast bowler capable of regularly bowling at speeds in excess of 145 km/h. He was first recorded exceeding 150 km/h in the 2001/02 season. In contrast to some other fully fast bowlers, Bond combined pace with control and accuracy, assets which helped him find success in all forms of the game.

For players who have bowled at least 1000 balls, he has the tenth best strike rate (29.2) in ODI&#x27;s and the tenth best average (20.88). In Tests, limiting the statistics to player who have bowled at least 2000 balls, his strike rate (38.8) ranks third in the all-time list, the only one below 40 in the modern era (playing since 1900). His average in terms of runs conceded per wicket was 22.39.

Bond usually batted quite far down the batting order, at number nine or later, but he was capable of slogging some quick runs towards the end of an innings. Bond could close down the innings with a couple of boundaries.

==Coaching career==
Shane Bond was appointed as the bowling coach for New Zealand cricket team in October 2012. He retired from the position after the 2015 Cricket World Cup where New Zealand reached the final.

He was widely credited with enhancing the performance of the New Zealand team during his 3-year stint, especially that of Trent Boult and Tim Southee. He became bowling coach of the Mumbai Indians in 2015, and has since become commentator for Sky Sports with Mark Richardson, Ian Smith and Simon Doull since 2016.

Bond became an assistant coach for the Brisbane Heat for the 2015 edition of the Big Bash League, working under head coach Daniel Vettori.

In March 2018, he was appointed as head coach for Sydney Thunder.

==Autobiography==
He has written all his experiences in his autobiography written with Dylan Cleaver, &quot;Shane Bond: Looking Back&quot;.

<text>Shivnarine &quot;Shiv&quot; Chanderpaul (Hindi: शिवनारायण चंद्रपॉल) CCH (born 16 August 1974) is a Guyanese cricket coach and former captain of the West Indies cricket team. Considered one of the greatest batsmen of his era, Chanderpaul is the 10th highest run scorer of all time in International cricket and the 9th highest in Test cricket. Chanderpaul was a member of the West Indies team that won the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, and in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy Final, he had the highest contribution for West Indies with the bat, scoring 47 runs.

Chanderpaul captained West Indies in 14 Tests and 16 One Day Internationals. A left-handed batsman, Chanderpaul is well known for his unorthodox batting stance, which has been described as crab-like. He scored 20,000 runs in international cricket, and in 2008 he was named as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by the &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, and awarded Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy (ICC Cricketer of the Year) by the International Cricket Council.

He made his international debut at the age of 19, but did not score a century in international cricket for three years, prompting some criticism. Early in his career, he was plagued by injuries, and was even dubbed a hypochondriac until he had a piece of floating bone removed from his foot in 2000. After that he enjoyed consistent form, scoring over 11,000 runs in Test cricket and is the 8th highest run scorer of all time in the format.

Due to poor performances, Chanderpaul was dropped from the West Indies squad in 2015. He announced his retirement from international cricket in 2016, without a farewell, at the age of 41.

He is currently serving as head coach of the USA senior women&#x27;s and the USA Under-19 women&#x27;s teams. In November 2022, he was inducted to the ICC Hall of Fame.

Chanderpaul was awarded the Cacique&#x27;s Crown of Honour, the second highest award in the Order of Service of Guyana, in 2009.

==Early life and domestic career==
Shivnarine Chanderpaul was born to Indo-Guyanese parents Kamraj and Uma Chanderpaul in Unity Village, Guyana on 16 August 1974. His father, Kamaraj Chanderpaul, helped to nurture his cricketing ability as a youngster. His ancestors moved from India to the West Indies as indentured labours under the indentured labour system. By the age of eight, Chanderpaul was playing for his village&#x27;s cricket team, and would frequently bat for hours, being bowled at by various members of his family. His father initially took him to the Everest club in Georgetown, but there was not a place for him at the club, and so he instead joined the Demerara Cricket Club. He appeared for the club&#x27;s under-16 side while only ten. He was later given an opportunity at the Georgetown Cricket Club.

He made his first-class cricket debut for Guyana at the age of 17, facing Leeward Islands in the 1991–92 Red Stripe Cup. He was run out for a duck in his first innings, but scored 90 runs in the second. His List A debut followed a few days later, against Barbados, in which Chanderpaul did not get a chance to bat in a match with no result. He achieved his maiden first-class century in April 1993, playing for the West Indies Board President&#x27;s XI against the touring Pakistanis. After taking four wickets in the Pakistanis&#x27; innings, Chanderpaul was one of three West Indians to score a century, scoring 140 runs, and remaining not out.

During this time, he achieved the highest first-class score of his career, in a 1995–96 Red Stripe Cup match against Jamaica. In the first-innings of the match, which was eventually drawn, he scored 303 not out from 478 deliveries. In 2007, he subsequently joined Durham as an overseas player, and helped the club collect its first major honour by top-scoring in their 2007 Friends Provident Trophy final win.

In March 2008, Chanderpaul caused some controversy when, after batting for Guyana on the first day of a Carib Beer Series match, he left to attend the WIPA awards, and did not arrive to play the following day. He was 78 not out when he left the match, without notifying his team&#x27;s manager or coach. He was recorded as retiring out on the scorecard, and later returned on the third day. At the ceremony, Chanderpaul was very successful, winning three awards as the international, Test and ODI cricketer of the year.

==International career==

During the English summer of 1993, Chanderpaul travelled with the West Indies Under-19 cricket team to England. He was the team&#x27;s most successful batsman during the Test series, scoring 372 runs at a batting average of 124.00, including a score of 203 not out in the first Test, at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. In the 1993–94 Red Stripe Cup, Chanderpaul was near the top of the batting averages, and, according to the &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, he was a &quot;contentious selection&quot; for the subsequent Test series against England, in which he was picked as an all-rounder who could bowl leg breaks as well as bat. He bowled 16 overs in England&#x27;s first innings without taking a wicket, and scored 62 runs in the West Indies reply. Chanderpaul played four Tests during his debut series, and was third amongst West Indian batsmen in terms of both runs scored and batting average, getting 288 runs at 57.60.

Over the following couple of years, Chanderpaul was in and out of the West Indian Test side, missing a visit by Australia altogether.

===Dominating the arena===
In his first 18 Test matches, Chanderpaul scored 1,232 runs at an average of 49.28, but despite scoring thirteen half-centuries, his highest score was 82; a Test century eluded him. He reached the milestone in his nineteenth Test, scoring 137 against India. Just over a month later, he repeated the feat in One Day International cricket, striking his maiden century in the format, scoring 109 runs, also against India.

Chanderpaul scored a further century in each of 1998, in a Test match against England, and 1999, in an ODI against South Africa. In the latter match, Chanderpaul and Carl Hooper were the only West Indian batsmen to reach double figures while batting – Chanderpaul scored 150, and Hooper reached 108. Their partnership of 226 was, at the time, a record in ODIs for the West Indies, and Chanderpaul&#x27;s individual total is his highest in ODIs. During this early period of his international career, Chanderpaul suffered with a negative reputation. Along with his failure to convert half-centuries into centuries, he had a tendency to miss matches which was perceived as hypochondria. He was also in the news for late-night partying; on one occasion in 1999, he shot a policeman in the mistaken belief that he was a thief. His career took a turn for the positive in 2000, when he had surgery on his foot to remove a floating bone.

Free of his foot injury, Chanderpaul enjoyed the best series of his career to that point when he scored centuries in three of the five Test matches against India. In addition to his centuries, he also scored three half-centuries, and batted for a record 1,513 minutes between dismissals. The following year, against Australia, Chanderpaul scored a century from 69 balls – which at the time was the third fastest Test century. Later in that same series, the two sides scored exactly the same total in their respective first innings, and Australia then reached 417 in their second, leaving West Indies requiring 418 runs to win. No side had ever successfully chased that many runs to win in a Test previously; writing for Cricinfo, Andrew Miller reported at the end of the third day that &quot;Victory [for the West Indies] is as unlikely as ever, but it remains a remote possibility.&quot; On the final two days, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chanderpaul—batting with a broken finger—both reached centuries, and the West Indies completed the record run-chase with three wickets remaining. He subsequently suffered what ESPNcricinfo described as &quot;an indifferent run&quot;; despite scoring centuries against South Africa and Bangladesh, he averaged just over 35 across eighteen innings, of which six were against either Bangladesh or Zimbabwe. Facing England at Lord&#x27;s, Chanderpaul narrowly missed out on a century in both innings in July 2004. He remained not out on each occasion, scoring 128 runs in the first innings, and 97 in the second, but the West Indies were beaten by over 200 runs in the contest.

===Captaincy===

In late 2004, Digicel began a sponsorship deal with the West Indies cricket team, and caused division within the squad. Initially, Chanderpaul was one of five players who did not attend a training camp due to disagreements about resulting commercial issues. For the following series against South Africa, seven of the West Indies best players were omitted from the squad due to contractual issues, but Chanderpaul had resolved his differences, and was named as captain in place of Lara, who was one of the missing players. In the first match of the series, Chanderpaul became only the second player, after Graham Dowling, to score a double century on his debut as captain in Test cricket. He remained 203 not out when he declared the West Indies innings closed; the joint-highest score of his Test career. Only a resolute batting performance from Jacques Kallis rescues a draw for South Africa in the match, although Chanderpaul was criticised for both the timing of his declaration, and later, negative field placings. For the second Test of the series, the West Indies were back to full-strength after the seven missing players cancelled their contracts with Cable &amp; Wireless. Despite the return of Lara, Chanderpaul retained the captaincy. The second and third Tests of the series were both won by South Africa, before a high scoring draw in the fourth Test. Responding to South Africa&#x27;s 588 for six declared, West Indies scored 747, in which Chanderpaul was one of four players to score a century.

Less than a year after taking on the captaincy, Chanderpaul resigned the position, citing a desire to concentrate on his batting. Although his batting average during his captaincy was only slightly less than his career average, the West Indies only won one Test match and two ODIs out of thirty matches under his charge. The former West Indian bowler, Colin Croft suggested that Chanderpaul &quot;was filling a space until some else could take over the mantle.&quot; Chanderpaul&#x27;s stint as captain was generally criticised in the press; Nagraj Gollapudi, writing for ESPNcricinfo described his style as unconvincing, while Ian Chappell claimed that the West Indies needed a &quot;father figure&quot;, rather than Chanderpaul, who he thought was &quot;predictable and reactive&quot;.

===Post captaincy===
In early 2007, Chanderpaul recorded his second highest score in ODI cricket, hitting 149 not out in a losing cause against India. Later that year, he was the top-scorer for the West Indies during their series against England, aggregating 446 runs in three Tests at an average of almost 150. His achievements during the series earned him the man of the series accolade, and saw him named as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by the &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;. He was especially praised by &quot;Wisden&quot; for his third instance of batting for 1,000 or more minutes without being dismissed, and for his century in the third Test on a difficult pitch. He scored another century in the fourth match of the series, and was named as the man of the match, despite an England victory. His performances throughout 2007 resulted in him being one of four players short-listed for the ICC Player of the Year award, which was eventually won by Ricky Ponting.

In 2008 Chanderpaul continued in his form during the Sri Lankan and Australian tours of the Caribbean. During the 2008 season he rose to be ranked 5th in the Test batting rankings. By the end of the third test against Australia, Chanderpaul became the fourth West Indian batsman to accomplish 8,000 runs in Test cricket as well as rising in the ranks to 2nd of the ICC test rankings, just 4 points shy of becoming the world&#x27;s number 1 ranked batsman. In the Test match series against the Australians, Chanderpaul had amassed 442 runs in 6 innings, in 3 of which he had remained not out, at an average of 147.33, including two centuries and three half-centuries. From the West Indies second innings in the first Test, he was not dismissed until the final day of the series – more than 1,000 minutes of batting without losing his wicket – the fourth time he has achieved this feat in Test cricket. Chanderpaul eventually picked as part of the 2008 ICC test team of the year and bestowed with the 2008 ICC Cricketer of the Year award.

In December 2013, Chanderpaul scored his 29th test century against New Zealand in the 3rd test match at Hamilton to equal Donald Bradman&#x27;s number of centuries. In the process, Chanderpaul also became the sixth highest run-scorer in Test matches, overtaking Allan Border&#x27;s 11,174 runs. This was also his 17th unbeaten test ton, a new record – one more than Indian legend Sachin Tendulkar(16 unbeaten tons).

===Late career===
In July 2014, he played for the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord&#x27;s. During the Third Test against New Zealand, he was out stumped by BJ Watling, the first time in his 20-year career that he had ever done so in any form of the game. In a test series against Bangladesh in 2014, Chanderpaul continued to show his durability by achieving scores of 85*, 84* and 101*.

On 23 January 2016, Chanderpaul announced his retirement from international cricket. Aged 41 at the announcement, Chanderpaul did not play for West Indies since May 2015, and his subsequent exclusion was cited to be a result of poor performances in the home series against England, in which he averaged 15.33 in 3 matches. He was also dropped from the WICB contract in December 2015, signalling the selectors&#x27; intention to move forward with younger players, despite the fragility of the West Indies middle order.

==Personality and style==
Chanderpaul is well known for his unorthodox batting stance, in which he stands facing the bowler, as opposed to most batsmen who stand side-on. He adopts this stance in order to see the ball clearly with both eyes, something he developed as a child when facing hostile fast bowling. Despite this, when he began playing Test cricket, he had a reasonably traditional stance, with his feet only angling slightly forwards. After a year of playing international cricket, he had eliminated the forward angle, and his feet pointed square of the feet in a classical stance. Between 2000 and 2005, he started to rotate his feet forwards, until they eventually pointed almost directly down the wicket, a position he has maintained since. While he faces forwards, his bat is angled towards square-leg, prompting Scyld Berry to describe his stance as &quot;perfectly orthodox... provided the bowler delivers from next to the umpire at square-leg, not the one at the bowler’s end.&quot; Chanderpaul&#x27;s stance has frequently been described as &quot;crab-like&quot;, and his batting has been labelled as ugly. It has been suggested that these factors have resulted in him being underrated as a batsman. When the ball is delivered, Chanderpaul moves into a more traditional position to play the ball.

As his stance has developed throughout his time playing international cricket, his batting aggression has undergone a similar transformation. He was first selected for the West Indies based on his attacking style of play; he cites Rohan Kanhai as one of his early influences. It was from Kanhai that Chanderpaul took his nickname, &quot;Tiger&quot;. He maintained this style during the early part of his international career, but as the batting of the West Indies side around him grew weaker, he developed a more defensive style of play, and turned himself into what ESPNcricinfo&#x27;s Vaneisa Baksh described as &quot;the anchor of the team, the solid man.&quot; The Australian spin bowler Shane Warne described Chanderpaul as &quot;a bloke you needed to crowbar away from the crease,&quot; and he is often labelled as &quot;limpet-like.&quot;

==After retirement==
On 27 January 2017, Chanderpaul signed a Kolpak deal with Lancashire. Following a successful campaign with the club in 2017 – a season in which he scored three centuries – Chanderpaul decided to extend his contract with Lancashire by signing a one-year deal for the 2018 season. He is also still committed to playing First Class cricket for his native Guyana for the foreseeable future.
In a 2022 YouTube documentary by Vice Media, Jamaican musician Sean Paul stated that one of his signature rap lyrics people assumed to be &quot;Sean De Paul&quot;, was actually &quot;Chanderpaul&quot; in reference to Shivnarine, a sporting idol of his.

==Coaching career==
In January 2022, he was appointed as head Coach of franchise Jamaica Tallawahs for CPL 2022 edition.

In July 2022, Chanderpaul was appointed head coach of the United States women&#x27;s national cricket team. He resigned from USA Cricket after coaching the USA under-19 women to the 2023 ICC Under-19 Women&#x27;s T20 World Cup.

==International centuries==

Chanderpaul scored 30 Test centuries, including two double centuries, and reached the 100-mark 11 times in One Day International matches. He scored 77 first-class centuries.

== Achievements and statistics ==
*As of October 2016 holds the record of achieving the most times the feat of scoring fifty runs or more in both the innings of a test and remain unbeaten (or not out) (4 times).
* Most career runs in test cricket when batting at number 5 position with 6,883 runs.
* He was chosen as the most handsome man in Guyana by Guyana Malayali Samajham.
* Chanderpaul along with Stuart Williams holds the record for registering the highest opening runstand for West Indies in ODIs (200*)
*In 2018 Chanderpaul was granted an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of the West Indies at St Augustine.

==Notes==
International Jamaican Hip Hop artist Sean Paul admitted in an interview with Vice Media, that the reason he is introduced as &quot;Chander Paul&quot; or &quot;Sean Da Paul&quot; a play on words of his actual name (Sean Paul) is due to Master of Ceremonies confusing his name with the famous cricketeer Shivnaraine (Chander) Paul.

<doc id="897189" wikidata="Q3269729" url="?curid=897189" title="Herschelle Gibbs">
<text>Herschelle Herman Gibbs (born 23 February 1974) is a South African cricket coach and former cricketer, who played all formats of the game for fourteen years. A right-handed batsman,who mostly opened the batting, Gibbs became the first player to hit six consecutive sixes in one over in One Day International (ODI) cricket, doing so against the Netherlands in the 2007 Cricket World Cup.

Regarded as one of the most naturally talented cricketers South Africa have ever produced, Gibbs was also known as an excellent fielder, like his compatriot Jonty Rhodes, with former Australian captain Ricky Ponting noting that in his opinion Gibbs is better than Rhodes in his ability to hit the stumps, with a report prepared by ESPNcricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had effected the eighth highest number of run-outs in ODI cricket of any fieldsman, with the tenth highest success rate.

==Personal life==
Gibbs was schooled at St Joseph&#x27;s Marist College and then Diocesan College in Rondebosch. Gibbs was a gifted sportsman at school featuring in SA Schools teams for rugby, cricket and soccer.

At Diocesan College Gibbs played for their First Rugby XV in the same team alongside Robbie Fleck, Selborne Boome and Dave von Hoesslin who would all go on to become Springboks. Gibbs also played alongside Springboks star Percy Montgomery for Western Province in Craven Week 1992.

Gibbs fathered a son with partner Liesl Fuller in 1996. In June 2007, Gibbs married Tenielle Povey in St Kitts, but divorced soon afterwards. In 2019, a court ordered him to pay 4500 rands per month for child care of a baby belonging to him and a woman with whom he had an affair. He engaged with Dana Németh in June 2023.

== International career ==
Gibbs has scored two double centuries in his Test career, both contrasting innings. His first was an innings of 211 not out against New Zealand at Jade Stadium in 1999. His innings took 468 balls while his second double century, 228 against Pakistan came off just 240 balls. In that innings in Newlands, he reached a national record partnership of 368 with Graeme Smith. He has put on a further two 300-run opening stands with his captain, making them the only pair in Test history to break 300 on three occasions. He also holds the South African second wicket record, a partnership of 315* with Jacques Kallis.

Gibbs famously dropped a catch in a World Cup game against Australia in 1999, when he attempted to throw the ball up into the air in celebration before he had full control of it. The player that he dropped, Steve Waugh, went on to make a century and win the game for Australia, a victory which also gave the Australian side the momentum they required to go on and win the tournament. It was claimed at the time that, immediately after the dropped catch, Waugh had &quot;sledged&quot; Gibbs with the statement, &quot;You&#x27;ve just dropped the World Cup&quot;, but, in his autobiography &quot;Out of My Comfort Zone&quot;, Waugh denies this. Waugh did state, however, that teammate Shane Warne had noticed that Gibbs had developed a habit of throwing the ball in the air prematurely after taking catches and instructed his colleagues not to leave the crease too quickly if they happened to be caught by Gibbs, just in case the situation that happened to Waugh should actually occur.

===Record breaking===
Gibbs is one of only ten batsmen in ODI history to score hundreds in three consecutive innings, the others being Zaheer Abbas, Saeed Anwar, AB de Villiers, Quinton de Kock, Ross Taylor, Kumar Sangakkara, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Babar Azam. Sangakkara became the only player to hit four consecutive ODI hundreds, during 2015 cricket world cup. On 6 October 2002, in Potchefstroom, in a match against Bangladeshis, Gibbs had a chance to become the first ever batsman to score four hundreds in a row. South Africa was set the target of 155 for victory, and Gibbs fell just three runs short, finishing unbeaten on 97. With just six runs needed for victory, he had the strike on 96, but Alok Kapali bowled a legside wide that went for four and made his task almost impossible.

On 12 March 2006, Gibbs played a monumental innings in the 5th ODI against Australia, scoring 175 off just 111 balls leading South Africa to victory. He was batting with Graeme Smith after Boeta Dippenaar was out on 1(3) bowled by Nathan Bracken. This was the highest scoring One Day International match in history and his innings broke several batting records. It was the highest ever score made in an ODI against Australia, beating Robin Smith&#x27;s effort in 1993. By bringing up his hundred off just 79 balls, he also brought up what was at the time the fastest ever ODI century against Australia. More importantly however, it was the fastest ever hundred by a South African batsman against any opposition, although the record would be broken later in the year by Mark Boucher. It was also the highest ever score by a batsman in South Africa. He scored 126 runs in boundaries, the most ever by a batsman. This record stood until 11 April 2011, when Shane Watson hit 150 runs in boundaries against Bangladesh.

In the match against the Netherlands in the group stage of the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Gibbs hit six sixes in an over off the bowling of Daan van Bunge becoming the first player in One Day International history to do so. Ravi Shastri and Sir Garfield Sobers had previously achieved this feat in first-class cricket but to date no player has achieved this in Test Cricket. In doing so, he raised US$1 million for the Habitat for Humanity housing projects as part of a contest run by tournament sponsor Johnnie Walker. It is likely that his being awarded citizenship of St Kitts and Nevis was due to this feat.
His six hitting form continued throughout the tournament and when he hit Jacob Oram into the stands during a Super Eight match he drew level with Australian batsman Ricky Ponting on 28 for most sixes in World Cup history.

=== Struggle with form ===

In the past two series against England and the West Indies he was brought down the order from the opening batsman to the middle order due to lack of form. After the move he regained form and looked more comfortable batting against the older ball.
On 22 April 2006, Gibbs paid the price for his recent run-drought, and was dropped for the second and third Tests against the New Zealand cricket team. He has been short of confidence in Test cricket of late, and scored only 6 and 2 in the First Test at Centurion Park. South Africa&#x27;s chief selector, Haroon Lorgat said, &quot;We had a meeting and agreed that a break and a fresh start next season will do him a world of good.&quot; This decision was widely viewed as a harsh one.

He came back into the side in the middle order but continued to struggle for runs. On the conclusion of the 1st Test against Pakistan in January 2007 he had gone over 2 years without scoring a century. He had come close on many occasions to ending the drought, getting out in the nineties four times.

In April 2009, his sixteen One Day International innings since the March 2008 one-day series in Bangladesh having yielded just three fifties, even Stuart Hess, his most ardent media supporter, was moved to cast doubt over his future. Hess had famously recommended Gibbs as captaincy successor to Shaun Pollock in 2003, but now, noting that his &quot;average, as an opener, in that same period is 25.25, more than 10 runs below his overall average of 35.87&quot;, Hess felt &quot;a sense that Gibbs is living off past deeds and not playing with the requisite form needed to hold on to a national spot.&quot; He noted, however, that Gibbs was the only South African with more than 1,000 World Cup runs and that, of the twelve others, only Sachin Tendulkar with 57.93 and Sir Viv Richards with 63.31 had better averages:

Perhaps putting up with Gibbs&#x27;s current inconsistent streak may just have to be the pay-off South Africa have to make if it means he can help guide the national side to greater glory in two years time.

After being dropped from the side Gibbs stated that he wanted to perform well in the domestic cup and that he was feeling well about it. He stated that his aim was to play in the 2011 Cricket World Cup

His Test career came to an end following the 2007/08 West Indies tour of South Africa.

==Domestic career==
===County cricket===
Gibbs played for Glamorgan in the 2008 County Twenty20 tournament where he had a successful time; his highest score being 98 off just 52 balls in a losing game against Northants. He then signed up to play for Glamorgan for the 2009 County season, replacing Mark Cosgrove as the overseas player at the end of June. He also represented Glamorgan in two NatWest Pro40 League matches in that same season.

Gibbs then signed for Yorkshire Carnegie for the 2010 Friends Provident t20 tournament, where he was their overseas player, scoring 101 from 53 balls against Northamptonshire to achieve his first century in English T20 cricket.

===Big Bash League===
In the 2011/12 season the Perth Scorchers signed Gibbs for their campaign in the Australian Big Bash League. Gibbs did a brilliant job for the team so much so that they made it to the final. He was the third highest run scorer. He scored 302 runs in 7 matches with an average of 43.14. His prominent batting helped the Scorchers to participate in the Champions League T20 which was held in South Africa during September 2012.

=== Indian Premier League ===
In April 2008, Herschelle Gibbs joined the Deccan Chargers of the Indian Premier League. His mediocre performance in 2008 season made the Chargers&#x27; management put him on sale. However, he came up with splendid knocks in the second season helping the Deccan Chargers ahead with four continuous wins in their first four matches. Of all the openers, Adam Gilchrist and Gibbs have been the most explosive pair. He also played a crucial role in the finals by scoring an unbeaten 53 (48 balls) in the final when Adam Gilchrist went out for a duck. He also took a crucial catch off Mark Boucher at point when the Royal Challengers were cruising to the victory.
In the 2012 version of the IPL, he was signed by the Mumbai Indians with a reported fee of US$50,000.
His top score is 69* (56) v Chennai Super Kings. In 2012, he scored 66* (46) for the Mumbai Indians.

=== Bangladesh Premier League ===
In a new T20 championship in Bangladesh, the team of Khulna Royal Bengals in the Bangladesh Premier League bought him for $50000 as their team member on 19 January 2012.

=== Kashmir Premier League ===
In the inaugural edition Kashmir Premier League 2021, he was the only foreign player to join the tournament.

==Controversies==
In 2001, Gibbs was fined along with several teammates for smoking marijuana during that year&#x27;s tour of the West Indies.

Gibbs was involved in the match fixing affair with former captain Hansie Cronje, who offered him $15,000 to score &quot;less than 20&quot; in the 5th One-Day International of a series. He tearfully claimed to the King Commission of inquiry into corruption in South African cricket that he did not follow through on his side of the bargain, scoring 74 runs. As a result, he was banned for only six months. He repeatedly refused to tour India fearing arrest and refused to even speak to Indian Police over the matter. However, Gibbs was named in the South African squad to tour India in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, and as a result, met with Indian Police over his involvement in the match-fixing scandal.

On 15 January 2007, it was announced that Gibbs would face a disciplinary panel after making racist comments during the 1st Test against Pakistan. His words had been picked up on the stump microphone saying remarks such as &quot;go back to the zoo&quot; and swearing to the Pakistani players and as a result heard across the world. The comments were said to have been directed at the members of the crowd after teammate Paul Harris had been abused by them whilst fielding. The Pakistani management made an official complaint to referee Chris Broad and Gibbs was banned for two Tests. He appealed against the ban but this was rejected by the ICC&#x27;s code of conduct commissioner, Richie Benaud. The ban was, however, changed to one Test, one Twenty20 game and one ODI match – all against Pakistan. In August 2021, he accused BCCI of putting pressure on him to not play in the inaugural edition of the Kashmir Premier League (KPL).

==Coaching career==
In July 2019, Gibbs was appointed as the head coach of the Rotterdam Rhinos for the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. Prior to this, he also had an experience of coaching teams in Shpageeza Cricket League and Kuwait&#x27;s national squad. In November 2020, he was selected by the Colombo Kings as the head coach for the inaugural edition of the Lanka Premier League. On 2 January 2021 he was selected as a new head coach of Karachi Kings in the PSL.

<doc id="897191" wikidata="Q1413674" url="?curid=897191" title="Paktofonika">
<text>Paktofonika was a Polish hip hop group from Katowice and Mikołów, which debuted with the album &quot;Kinematografia&quot; in 2000. The name Paktofonika comes from the words &quot;pakt&quot; (&quot;pact&quot;) and &quot;fonika&quot; (&quot;phonics&quot;), from which derives the idea of &quot;A pact made alongside sounds from a speaker&quot;, created by band&#x27;s founders, Magik and Rahim.

==Members==
* Piotr &quot;Magik&quot; Łuszcz (1978–2000) – formerly of Kaliber 44
* Wojciech &quot;Fokus&quot; Alszer (born 1980) – ex Kwadrat Skład, since 2004 a member of Pokahontaz 
* Sebastian &quot;Rahim&quot; Salbert (born 1978) – ex 3xKlan, Erka, since 2004 a member of Pokahontaz

==History==
===Formation (1998–1999)===
Paktofonika began when Magik left Kaliber 44 after their second album, &quot;W 63 minuty dookoła świata&quot; (1998). Rahim left his group 3xKlan at around the same time, and formed Paktofonika with Magik and Fokus in 1998. Their first songs, written in October 1998, were &quot;Priorytety&quot;, &quot;Ja to Ja&quot; and &quot;Gdyby&quot;. Two new members joined Paktofonika, DJ Bambus on turntables, and Sot as a beatboxer.

===&quot;Kinematografia&quot; and Magik&#x27;s death (2000)===
In the spring of 2000, the group signed a contract with Gigant Records. In the summer of that year, the group was in Witten, Germany, where they recorded their song &quot;2 Kilo&quot; with German artists. On 18 December 2000, Paktofonika&#x27;s first album entitled &quot;Kinematografia&quot; was released. Eight days later, on 26 December at 6.15 a.m., Magik committed suicide by jumping from the window of his ninth-floor apartment.

===Aftermath (2001–2003)===
After Magik&#x27;s death, the group continued performing with DJ Bambus and Sot for some time. In concerts, they were using previously recorded material of Magik&#x27;s vocals. In May 2001, a sample of Paktofonika&#x27;s song &quot;Ja to Ja&quot;, sung by reggae/hip-hop artist Piotr &#x27;Gutek&#x27; Gutkowski, was used in an ice-cream commercial without the group members&#x27; permission, but with the knowledge of Gigant Records.

In September 2002, Paktofonika&#x27;s farewell album was released. &quot;Archiwum Kinematografii&quot; contained studio outtakes from the group&#x27;s first album, and two songs recorded later without Magik, &quot;Ja to ja 2 (dokładnie tak!)&quot; and &quot;W pełnej gotowości&quot;. In December 2002, it was announced that on 21 March 2003 the group would give its last performance under the name Paktofonika in Spodek, Katowice. The concert was recorded and released as &quot;Pożegnalny koncert&quot; on 26 April 2004 through Universal Music Poland.

Rahim and Fokus continue to work on other projects, such as PFK Company and Pokahontaz.

===The official comeback of Paktofonika (2022–present)===
In 2022, Fokus and Rahim announced their return to concerts as Paktofonika, wanting to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the Kinematografia album and the 20th anniversary of the Archiwum kinematografii. Since 2022, many concerts have been organized throughout Poland and also in other countries (e.g. United States, Canada, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway and Iceland)

==Legacy==
&quot;Jesteś Bogiem&quot;, a film inspired by Paktofonika&#x27;s story and directed by Leszek Dawid, was released on 7 May 2012. It received critical acclaim and won several awards, including two Polish Film Awards (out of ten nominations) and 6 Złote Lwy awards (out of 7 nominations) at Gdynia Film Festival. The film was also a box-office hit, with 1,366,293 viewers within its first month in theaters, and became the highest-selling Polish film of the year. The film title (&quot;You are God&quot;) refers to the title of Paktofonika&#x27;s most popular song, &quot;Jestem Bogiem&quot; (&quot;I am God&quot;). The film was met mainly with critical reception due to the downplaying of the role of the Kaliber 44 group and the distortion of facts about the Magik (the film shows that after leaving Kaliber 44, he did not have much money, and in reality he had much more income from it than from paktofonika, and creating music in paktofonika wasn&#x27;t as hard as it shows in the movie.

<text>Arnoldus Mauritius Blignaut (born 1 August 1978) is a Zimbabwean former cricketer, who played all formats of the game. He was a right-arm fast-medium bowler, also known as a hard-hitting batsman in ODIs, where he frequently scored a fast rate; though he was seldom able to sustain this form and keeping his wicket intact through many overs. He more often played ODIs, where many runs in a short time are desired, than Tests.

==International career==
On his Test debut, he took five wickets in the first innings against Bangladesh in Bulawayo in 2001. Blignaut took a hat-trick against Bangladesh in a Test match at Harare on 22 February 2004. He is the only bowler to take a Test hat-trick for Zimbabwe.

Like Travis Friend and Henry Olonga before him, Blignaut was one of the few Zimbabwean bowlers who could exceed 90 mph. In a land full of medium-fast bowlers, Blignaut (on his day) formed a lethal opening combination with the dependable Heath Streak, often rushing the batsmen for pace off the wicket. In an ODI against England at Durham in 2003, he bowled a 93 mph thunderbolt to England allrounder Andrew Flintoff. In the same game, however, he went at 10 runs an over, getting neither his line nor his length right. 
He remained Zimbabwe&#x27;s wild card, especially in the shorter formats, with the ability to either win or lose a game in a matter of overs.

After playing the series against New Zealand and India in 2005, he withdrew from Zimbabwe selection over not being paid.

His ODI strike-rate is over 100, with a high score of 63 not out, and an average of just 19. His bowling average is just above 41, with best bowling figures of 4/43, and an economy of 5.34. He was also a fine fielder.

He made a brief comeback after his initial retirement and made his T20I debut for Zimbabwe in the 2010 T20 World Cup, which was his final international appearance.

==Domestic career==
In the Australian season 2004–05, Blignaut was contracted to play for Tasmania. Injury and poor form prevented him from playing all but a couple of games for the state. He even struggled to make an impact at club level. Eventually he returned to Zimbabwe to re-join the Test side. The second year of his contract with Tasmania was cancelled.

He signed a contract with South African domestic side Highveld Lions for 2006 season. After 2006, he disappeared from cricket for a few years before returning in 2010 for a few matches for Zimbabwe.

==After cricket==
He works in the family business in Zimbabwe, and has been coaching cricket in the country.

<text>LIN is a network protocol]] used for communication between components in modern vehicles. It is a low-cost single-step serial protocol that supports communications up to 19.2 Kbit/s with a maximum bus length of .

==History==
The need for a cheap serial network arose as the technologies and the facilities implemented in the car grew, while the CAN bus was too expensive to implement for every component in the car. European car manufacturers started using different serial communication technologies, which led to compatibility problems.

In the late 1990s, the LIN Consortium was founded by five automakers (BMW, Volkswagen Group, Audi, Volvo Cars, Mercedes-Benz), with the technologies supplied (networking and hardware expertise) from Volcano Automotive Group and Motorola. The first fully implemented version of the new LIN specification (LIN version 1.3) was published in November 2002. In September 2003, version 2.0 was introduced to expand capabilities and make provisions for additional diagnostics features. LIN may be used also over the vehicle&#x27;s battery power line with a special LIN-over-DC-power-line (DC-LIN) transceiver. LIN over DC power line (DC-LIN) was standardized as ISO/AWI 17987-8.

CAN in Automation has been appointed by the ISO Technical Management Board (TMB) as the Registration Authority for the LIN Supplier ID standardized in the ISO 17987 series.

== Network topology ==
LIN is a broadcast serial network comprising 16 nodes (one primary and up to 15 secondary nodes).

All messages are initiated by the primary node with at most one secondary node replying to a given message identifier. The primary node can also act as a secondary node by replying to its own messages. Because all communications are initiated by the primary node it is not necessary to implement a collision detection.

The primary and secondary nodes are typically microcontrollers, but may be implemented in specialized hardware or ASICs in order to save cost, space, or power.

Current uses combine the low-cost efficiency of LIN and simple sensors to create small networks. These sub-systems can be connected by a back-bone network (i.e. CAN in cars).

== Overview ==
The LIN bus is an inexpensive serial communications protocol, which effectively supports remote application within a car&#x27;s network. It is particularly intended for mechatronic nodes in distributed automotive applications, but is equally suited to industrial applications. It is intended to complement the existing CAN network leading to hierarchical networks within cars.

In the late 1990s the Local Interconnect Network (LIN) Consortium was founded by five European automakers, Mentor Graphics (Formerly Volcano Automotive Group) and Freescale (Formerly Motorola, now NXP). The first fully implemented version of the new LIN specification was published in November 2002 as LIN version 1.3. In September 2003 version 2.0 was introduced to expand configuration capabilities and make provisions for significant additional diagnostics features and tool interfaces.

The protocol’s main features are listed below:

* Single master, up to 16 slaves (i.e. no bus arbitration). This is the value recommended by the LIN Consortium to achieve deterministic time response.
** Slave Node Position Detection (SNPD) allows node address assignment after power-up
* Single-wire communications up to 19.2 kbit/s @ 40 meter bus length. In the LIN specification 2.2, the speed up to 20 kbit/s.
* Guaranteed latency times.
* Variable length of data frame (2, 4 and 8 bytes).
* Configuration flexibility.
* Multicast reception with time synchronization, without crystals or ceramic resonators.
* Data checksum and error detection.
* Detection of defective nodes.
* Low-cost silicon implementation based on standard UART/SCI hardware.
* Enabler for hierarchical networks.
* Operating voltage of 12 V.

Data is transferred across the bus in fixed-form messages of selectable lengths. The master task transmits a header that consists of a break signal followed by synchronization and identifier fields. The slaves respond with a data frame that consists of 2, 4 or 8 data bytes plus 3 bytes of control information.

== LIN message frame ==
A message contains the following fields:

* Synchronization break
* Synchronization byte
* Identifier byte
* Data bytes
* Checksum byte

=== Frame types ===
# Unconditional frame. These always carry signals and their identifiers are in the range 0 to 59 (0x00 to 0x3b). All subscribers of the unconditional frame shall receive the frame and make it available to the application (assuming no errors were detected).
# Event-triggered frame. The purpose of this is to increase the responsiveness of the LIN cluster without assigning too much of the bus bandwidth to the polling of multiple slave nodes with seldom occurring events. The first data byte of the carried unconditional frame shall be equal to a protected identifier assigned to an event-triggered frame. A slave shall reply with an associated unconditional frame only if its data value has changed. If none of the slave tasks responds to the header the rest of the frame slot is silent and the header is ignored. If more than one slave task responds to the header in the same frame slot a collision will occur, and the master has to resolve the collision by requesting all associated unconditional frames before requesting the event-triggered frame again.
# Sporadic frame. This frame is transmitted by the master as required, so a collision cannot occur. The header of a sporadic frame shall only be sent in its associated frame slot when the master task knows that a signal carried in the frame has been updated. The publisher of the sporadic frame shall always provide the response to the header.
# Diagnostic frame. These always carry diagnostic or configuration data and they always contain eight data bytes. The identifier is either 60 (0x3C), called master request frame, or 61(0x3D), called slave response frame. Before generating the header of a diagnostic frame, the master task asks its diagnostic module if it shall be sent or if the bus shall be silent. The slave tasks publish and subscribe to the response according to their diagnostic module.
# User-defined frame. These can carry any kind of information. Their identifier is 62 (0x3E). The header of a user-defined frame is always transmitted when a frame slot allocated to the frame is processed
# Reserved frame. These shall not be used in a LIN 2.0 cluster. Their identifier is 63 (0x3F).

== LIN hardware ==
The LIN specification was designed to allow very cheap hardware-nodes being used within a network. It is a low-cost, single-wire network based on ISO 9141. In today’s car networking topologies, microcontrollers with either UART capability or dedicated LIN hardware are used.
The microcontroller generates all needed LIN data (protocol ...) (partly) by software and is connected to the LIN network via a LIN transceiver (simply speaking, a level shifter with some add-ons). Working as a LIN node is only part of the possible functionality.
The LIN hardware may include this transceiver and works as a pure LIN node without added functionality.

As LIN Slave nodes should be as cheap as possible, they may generate their internal clocks by using RC oscillators instead of crystal oscillators (quartz or a ceramic).
To ensure the baud rate-stability within one LIN frame, the SYNC field within the header is used.

== LIN protocol ==
The LIN-Master uses one or more predefined scheduling tables to start the sending and receiving to the LIN bus. These scheduling tables contain at least the relative timing, where the message sending is initiated.
One LIN Frame consists of the two parts: header and response. The header is always sent by the LIN Master, while the response is sent by either one dedicated LIN-Slave or the LIN master itself.

Transmitted data within the LIN is transmitted serially as eight bit data bytes with one start bit, one stop-bit, and no parity (break field does not have a start or stop bit). Bit rates vary within the range of 1 kbit/s to 20 kbit/s.
Data on the bus is divided into recessive (logical HIGH) and dominant (logical LOW).
The time normally is considered by the LIN Masters stable clock source, the smallest entity is one bit time (52 μs @ 19.2 kbit/s).

Two bus statessleep-mode and activeare used within the LIN protocol. While data is on the bus, all LIN-nodes are asked to be in the active state. After a specified timeout, the nodes enter sleep mode and will be released back to active state by a WAKEUP frame.
This frame may be sent by any node requesting activity on the bus, either the LIN Master following its internal schedule, or one of the attached LIN Slaves being activated by its internal software application.
After all nodes are awakened, the Master continues to schedule the next Identifier.

===Header===
The header consists of five parts:

&quot;BREAK:&quot;
The BREAK field is used to activate all attached LIN slaves to listen to the following parts of the header. It consists of one start bit and several dominant bits. The length is at least 11-bit times; standard use as of today are 13-bit times, and therefore differs from the basic data format. 
This is used to ensure that listening LIN nodes with a main-clock differing from the set bus baud rate in specified ranges will detect the BREAK as the frame starting the communication and not as a standard data byte with all values zero (hexadecimal 0x00).

&quot;SYNC:&quot;
The SYNC is a standard data format byte with a value of hexadecimal 0x55. 
LIN slaves running on RC oscillator will use the distance between a fixed amount of rising and falling edges to measure the current bit time on the bus (the master&#x27;s time normal) and to recalculate the internal baud rate.

&quot;INTER BYTE SPACE:&quot;
Inter Byte Space is used to adjust for bus jitter. It is an optional component within the LIN specification. If enabled, then all LIN nodes must be prepared to deal with it.

There is an Inter Byte Space between the BREAK and SYNC field, one between the SYNC and IDENTIFIER, one between the payload and Checksum and one between every Data byte in the payload.

&quot;IDENTIFIER:&quot;
The IDENTIFIER defines one action to be fulfilled by one or several of the attached LIN slave nodes. The network designer has to ensure the fault-free functionality in the design phase (one slave is allowed to send data to the bus in one frame time).

If the identifier causes one &quot;physical&quot; LIN slave to send the response, the identifier may be called a Rx-identifier.
If the &quot;master&#x27;s slave task&quot; sends data to the bus, it may be called Tx-identifier.

&quot;RESPONSE SPACE:&quot;
Response Space is the time between the IDENTIFIER field and the first Data byte which starts the LIN RESPONSE part of the LIN frame. When a particular LIN frame is transmitted completely, Header + Response, by the LIN MASTER, the LIN MASTER will use the full RESPONSE SPACE TIME to calculate when to send the response after sending the header. If the response part of the LIN frame is coming from a physically different SLAVE NODE, then each node (master &amp; slave) will utilize 50% of the Response Space time in their timeout calculations.

===Response===
The response is sent by one of the attached LIN slave tasks and is divided into data and checksum.

&quot;DATA:&quot;
The responding slave may send zero to eight data bytes to the bus. The amount of data is fixed by the application designer and mirrors data relevant for the application which the LIN slave runs in.

&quot;CHECKSUM:&quot;
There are two checksum-models available within LIN - The first is the checksum including the data bytes only (specification up to Version 1.3), the second one includes the identifier in addition (Version 2.0+).
The used checksum model is pre-defined by the application designer.

== Slave node position detection (SNPD) or autoaddressing ==
These methods allow the detection of the position of slave nodes on the LIN bus and allow the assignment of a unique node address (NAD).
* Allows similar or the same devices to be connected on the bus without end of line programming or connector pin programming.

Restrictions:
* All auto-addressing slaves must be in one line
** Standard slaves can be connected in any way

=== Extra wire daisy chain (XWDC) ===
Each slave node has to provide two extra pins, one input, D1, and one output, D2.
* The first SNPD node input D1 is either set to GND or connected to the output of the master.
** The output of the first node, D2, is connected to the input, D1 of the second node, and so on resulting in a daisy chain.

Each configuration pin Dx (x=1-2) has additional circuitry to aid in the position detection.
# Switchable resistive pull-up to Vbat
# Pull-down to GND
# Comparator referenced to Vbat/2

==== XWDC auto-addressing procedure ====
At the start of the procedure no SNPD devices have a NAD assigned

1 First auto-addressing LIN message
:1.1 All outputs (D2) are set to a high level, all pull-downs are turned off
:1.2 The first SNPD node is selected. It is identified by having the input D1 low (hardwired).
:1.3 The selected node takes the address from the LIN configuration message
:1.4 The detected node turns on the pull-down at the output D2
2 Subsequent auto-addressing LIN messages
:2.1 The first non addressed SNPD node is selected. It is identified by having the input D1 low (D2 of previous node).
:2.2 The selected node takes the address from the LIN configuration message
:2.3 The detected node turns on the pull-down at the output D2
:2.4 Steps 2.1-2.4 are repeated until all slave nodes are assigned an address
3 All pull-ups and pull-downs are turned off completing the addressing procedure

=== Bus shunt method (BSM) ===
Each slave node has two LIN pins
# bus_in
# bus_out

Each slave node needs some additional circuitry compared to the standard LIN circuitry to aid in the position detection.
# The standard pull-up must be switchable
# Switchable 2 mA current source from Vbat
# Shunt resistor
# Differential amplifier
# Analog to digital converter

==== BSM auto-addressing procedure ====
At the start of the procedure, none of the SNPD devices have a NAD assigned. The autoaddressing routine is performed during the sync field. The sync field is broken into three phases:

1 Offset current measurement
:1.1 All outputs pull-ups and current sources are switched off
:1.2 The bus current is measured, Ioffset
2 Pull-up mode
:2.1 Pull-ups are turned on and current sources remain off
:2.2 The bus current is measured, IPU
:2.3 Nodes with ΔI = IPU-Ioffset &lt; 1 mA are &quot;selected&quot;
3 Current source mode
:3.1 Selected nodes switch current source on and others switch pull-ups off
:3.2 Bus current is measured, ICS
:3.3 Node with ΔI = ICS-Ioffset &lt; 1 mA is detected as the last node
:3.4 Current sources are switched off and pull-ups are switched on
:3.5 The last node will accept the address contained in the LIN configuration message

This technique is covered by the patents EP 1490772 B1 and US 7091876.

== LIN advantages ==
* Easy to use
* Components available
* Cheaper than CAN and other communications buses
* Harness reduction
* More reliable vehicles
* Extension easy to implement.
* No protocol license fee required

LIN is not a full replacement of the CAN bus. But the LIN bus is a good alternative wherever low costs are essential and speed/bandwidth is not important. Typically, it is used within sub-systems that are not critical to vehicle performance or safety - some examples are given below.

== Applications ==
== Addressing ==
Addressing in LIN is achieved with a NAD (Node ADdress) that is part of the PID (protected identifier). NAD values are on 7bits, so in the range 1 to 127 (0x7F) and it is a composition of supplier ID, function ID and variant ID. 

You can obtain a supplier ID by contacting CAN in Automation that is the authority responsible for the assignment of such identifiers.

<doc id="897195" wikidata="Q3524453" url="?curid=897195" title="Heath Streak">
<text>Heath Hilton Streak (16 March 1974 – 3 September 2023) was a Zimbabwean cricketer and cricket coach who played for and captained the Zimbabwe national cricket team. He was the all time leading wicket taker for Zimbabwe in Test cricket with 216 wickets and in ODI cricket with 239 wickets.

Streak remains the only Zimbabwean cricketer to have taken over 100 Test wickets and completed the double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets in ODIs. He was also one of only four Zimbabwean bowlers to have taken over 100 ODI wickets. He holds the record for the most five-wicket hauls by a Zimbabwean in Tests, having achieved the feat seven times.

Streak was part of the &#x27;golden era&#x27; of Zimbabwe cricket between 1997 and 2002. His relationship with Zimbabwe Cricket soured on several occasions during his international career, as well as during his coaching career.

In September 2018, Streak submitted an application to the court to have Zimbabwe Cricket liquidated in relation to outstanding debts. In April 2021, Streak was handed an eight-year ban by the ICC for corruption.

==Early life==
Streak was born in Bulawayo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and hailed from a family whose background primarily involved ranching in Bulawayo. He completed his education at the Rhodes Estate Preparatory School and Falcon College. His father, Denis Streak, was also a first-class cricketer. He held a junior hunter&#x27;s licence prior to becoming a professional cricketer.

==Domestic career==
Streak made his first-class debut for Zimbabwe B against the touring Kent team on 30 March 1993 at Harare Sports Club.

In 1995/96, Streak played in the same Matabeleland team as his 46-year-old father Denis in the final of the Lonrho Logan Cup against Mashonaland Country Districts; this was the first instance of a father and son playing in the same first-class match for more than thirty years. Matabeleland eventually crowned as champions of the 1996 Logan Cup. He made his T20 debut representing Warwickshire against Glamorgan on 8 July 2004.

Streak was appointed the captain of Warwickshire in 2006 after signing a two-year contract. However, on 25 April 2007, Streak resigned as Warwickshire captain after featuring in just one match in the 2007 county season, indicating that captaining the side was affecting his on field abilities. He was replaced as captain by Darren Maddy. At the end of the 2007 season, he left Warwickshire citing family reasons.

At the end of the year of 2007, Streak joined the Ahmedabad Rockets in the controversial Indian Cricket League which ultimately ended his international career.

==International career==
===Early career===
Streak made his ODI debut on 10 November 1993 against South Africa. A month later, he made his test debut in Zimbabwe&#x27;s tour of Pakistan 1993/1994 (on 1 December 1993). He made his mark in international cricket by taking 8 wickets in the 2nd Test at Rawalpindi (9–14 December 1993). Streak won the Player of the series award on his debut test series for his impressive performance with the ball taking 22 wickets at an average of 13.54. It is also the most number of wickets taken by a Zimbabwean bowler in a test series.

===Rising through the ranks===
Streak bettered his best bowling figures in 1995 when Pakistan toured Zimbabwe, taking 6/90 in the first Test at Harare which Zimbabwe won by an innings. On 13 January 1996 in a test match against New Zealand at Hamilton, he became the fastest Zimbabwean bowler to take 50 test wickets in 11 matches. He was also part of Zimbabwe side which secured first test win against Pakistan in Pakistan soil in 1998. In 2000/2001, he won 2-man of the series awards, first in Zimbabwe&#x27;s tour of England and then in Bangladesh&#x27;s tour of Zimbabwe. In a test match in 2000 against England at Lord&#x27;s, he picked up 6/87 and became the first and only Zimbabwean to take a fifer at Lord&#x27;s. He is also the only Zimbabwean to be on the Lord&#x27;s honours boards.

His debut World Cup appearance came during the 1996 Cricket World Cup and was part of Zimbabwe team which reached super sixes stage for the first time during the 1999 Cricket World Cup. He was also part of the Zimbabwean side which finished fifth at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in men&#x27;s cricket competition and was part of the Zimbabwean side which played in the preliminary match against New Zealand in the inaugural edition of the ICC Champions Trophy in 1998. On 11 June 1999, he became the first as well as the fastest Zimbabwean bowler to take 100 ODI wickets.

===Captaincy===
Streak claimed in an interview in &quot;The Observer&quot; that he was faced with moral challenges in captaining Zimbabwe. He said that he was asked to falsely tell white players that they were not talented enough and were to be replaced by black players.

Streak was appointed as the captain of Zimbabwe side in 2000 for both test and ODI formats. During his captaincy tenure, he embroiled in tensions with the cricket board over pay and quota issues which also caused him to step down from the captaincy in 2001. Under his captaincy, Zimbabwe produced an upset victory against India in a test match in 2001 at home where Zimbabwe secured their first ever test win against India by four wickets. He was also known for his brutal bowling spell of 4/8 in an ODI against West Indies during the 2001 Australia Tri-series where Zimbabwe defeated West Indies by 47 runs in a low scoring affair. On 4 February 2001, in an ODI against Australia he became the first Zimbabwean bowler to take 150 ODI wickets. He along with Andy Blignaut set the highest seventh wicket partnership for Zimbabwe in test cricket by adding 154 runs during a test match against West Indies in July 2001 at Harare. On 7 October 2001, he along with Andy Flower set the highest seventh wicket partnership for Zimbabwe in ODI by adding 130 runs against England.

Streak was again appointed as the captain in 2002 and he was again in the spotlight in the wake of Zimbabwe&#x27;s political crisis. He captained Zimbabwe team in the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy and at the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy.

Streak also captained the Zimbabwean team at the 2003 World Cup, a tournament marred by political tensions in Zimbabwe. During the 2003 World Cup, his teammates Andy Flower and Henry Olonga wore black armbands in the match against Namibia at the Harare Sports Club, to &quot;mourn the death of democracy&quot; in Zimbabwe, which made international headlines. Under his captaincy, Zimbabwe reached the Super Sixes stage in the 2003 tournament. On 23 June 2003, he became the first Zimbabwean bowler to take 200 ODI wickets during an ODI against England.

In 2004, he was unceremoniously sacked from the team by the Zimbabwe Cricket Union when he was still the captain of the side due to being involved in rebellions, and was subsequently replaced by the then 22-year-old Tatenda Taibu as captain. In the same year, he was nominated for ICC ODI Player of the Year during the 2004 ICC Awards.

Streak was the most successful test captain of Zimbabwe with four wins and he was also the second most successful ODI captain for Zimbabwe with 18 wins.

===Retirement===
Streak returned to represent Zimbabwe in March 2005 after a one-year absence from international cricket. He was also part of the Africa XI team during the 2005 Afro-Asia Cup in a 3 match ODI series against Asia XI.

Streak retired from international cricket in October 2005 to become captain of Warwickshire County Cricket Club having previously played county cricket for Hampshire. He also captained his fellow exiled players from Zimbabwe in the Red Lions team, which plays charity games in England.

==Coaching career==
In August 2009, Streak was appointed as the bowling coach of the Zimbabwe national cricket team. He was also given the responsibility of working with the young Zimbabwean fast bowlers and for franchise cricket. Fast bowlers such as Kyle Jarvis, Christopher Mpofu, Brian Vitori and Shingirai Masakadza who were groomed and nurtured under his coaching later went onto become regular features in Zimbabwe national side.

In 2010, along with his former teammate Grant Flower, Streak became a supporting coach of Zimbabwe under former English cricketer Alan Butcher. Flower and Streak became batting bowling coach respectively.

In 2013, Streak&#x27;s contract was not renewed for financial reasons. Zimbabwe Cricket had offered Streak a consultancy role but they could not guarantee him a set number of working days or specific pay which forced him to stay out of the preparations for the Bangladesh series. Finances permitting at his franchise in Bulawayo, the Matabeleland Tuskers, he remained coach there. He was appointed Bangladesh&#x27;s bowling coach in May 2014 until 2016 for a contract of two years. In 2016, decided not to renew contract with Bangladesh Cricket Board with the intention to become coach of National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. In July 2016, he was appointed as the consultant of Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association Academy.

In October 2016, Streak was appointed head coach of the Zimbabwe national cricket team replacing Dav Whatmore. He was tasked with ensuring Zimbabwe qualify for the 2019 World Cup. However, Zimbabwe failed to qualify for the World Cup following the disappointing performance by the team at the 2018 ICC World Cup Qualifier, and Streak was forced to resign in early 2018 with the entire coaching staff was also sacked by the board. The chairman of Zimbabwe Cricket, Tavengwa Mukuhlani also accused Streak of being racist and insisted that some of his player selections during the 2018 World Cup qualifiers were influenced by this. Streak refuted the allegations and accused Zimbabwe Cricket of being unethical and corrupt.

In 2018, he was appointed as a consultant for the Scotland side for two matches in a T20I tri-series which also featured Ireland and Netherlands. He also joined Somerset in 2019 as a consultant bowling coach for a short stint. He continued on in his role as bowling coach for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. He also served as bowling coach for the Gujarat Lions franchise in the 2016 and 2017 IPL seasons.

In April 2021, Streak was banned from all cricketing activities for eight years for breaching the ICC&#x27;s anti-corruption policies. Streak was found guilty of assisting a corruptor known as &quot;Mr X&quot; to contact players. Streak received two bitcoins (worth around US$ 35,000), and an iPhone as payment from the corruptor in 2017. He was accused of disclosing inside information (confidential information) about the franchise T20 leagues including Indian Premier League, Pakistan Super League and Afghanistan Premier League. Streak himself accepted the ban by the ICC but denied the match fixing claims against him.

Streak also founded the Heath Streak Academy (also better known as Old Mutual Heath Streak Cricket Academy Trust) in 2014 which was established for the development and growth of cricket throughout Zimbabwe. He resigned from heading the Heath Streak Academy Trust in 2021 after being banned by the ICC; the academy was later renamed as Zimbabwe Youth Cricket Academy.

==Beyond cricket==
In 2005, he conducted an AIDS fundraiser which also included an auction of cricket memorabilia.

==Illness and death==
On 11 May 2023, David Coltart, a Zimbabwean senator, announced that Streak was &quot;extremely ill&quot;. Media reports stated that Streak had been diagnosed with Stage 4 colon and liver cancer, and was &quot;on his deathbed&quot;. On 23 August, amid reports that Streak had died of cancer, former teammate Henry Olonga confirmed that Streak was alive. On 3 September 2023, Streak died from cancer at his farm in Matabeleland at age 49.

<text>Tatenda Taibu (born 14 May 1983) is a former Zimbabwean cricketer who captained the Zimbabwe national cricket team. He is a wicket-keeper-batsman. From 6 May 2004 to 5 September 2019, he held the record for being the youngest test captain in history when he captained his team against Sri Lanka until Rashid Khan of Afghanistan claimed the record. Taibu is currently serving as Head Coach for Cricket PNG and its national Men’s team, known as the PNG Barramundis.

In July 2012 Taibu, aged only 29, decided to retire from cricket to focus on his work in church. In December 2018, it was reported that he was making a return to cricket. Later the same month, he played first-class cricket for Badureliya Sports Club in the 2018–19 Premier League Tournament in Sri Lanka.

==International career==
Taibu made his first-class debut at the age of 16, and his debut for Zimbabwe national team in 2001, aged 18. In 2003, he was appointed vice-captain to Heath Streak on the team&#x27;s tour of England, and was made national captain in April 2004, making him the youngest Test captain in history then, until Rashid Khan of Afghanistan claimed the record in 2019. Rashid Khan was 8 days younger than Taibu when he captained Afghanistan against Bangladesh.

He took a two-year break for Zimbabwe in from 2005 to 2007 when he played a season as the captain of Namibia and another season for the Cape Cobras in South Africa.

He made his return to the Zimbabwean side in a series against India A in July 2007, registering a century. The following month Zimbabwe hosted South Africa for a three-game ODI series and in the final game Taibu scored a career best 107 not out. It was the first ODI century by a Zimbabwean against South Africa.

During 2010 Taibu&#x27;s form continued and he scored 73 against South Africa as Zimbabwe were all out for 268. The South Africans chased down the total comfortably with Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers scoring centuries.

He scored 98 for his side in 2011 World Cup as their team won by 175 runs against Canada in Nagpur. Taibu played a splendid innings in must-win situation of World Cup.

When Zimbabwe returned to Test cricket in 2011, Taibu was selected to play in their one-off Tests against Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand despite making critical remarks of the country&#x27;s cricket administration. He scored half-centuries in each of the three Tests.

Taibu became the 5th Zimbabwean to score 3,000 runs during his innings of 53 (74) against Kenya at Eden Gardens, Kolkata during the 2011 World Cup on 20 March 2011. He along with Stuart Matsikenyeri set the record partnership in ODIs for the sixth wicket for Zimbabwe(188)

==Retirement==
On 10 July 2012, Taibu called time on his career aged 29. He said he would only do work for the church. Taibu told Zimeye: “I just feel that my true calling now lies in doing the Lord’s work, and although I am fortunate and proud to have played for my country, the time has come for me to put my entire focus on that part of my life.”

He scored 1,546 runs in Tests with 57 catches and five stumpings, while making 3,393 runs in ODIs with 114 catches and 33 stumpings. He finishes as Zimbabwe&#x27;s fourth highest run-scorer in ODIs with the second most dismissals as a wicketkeeper, behind Andy Flower.

==Beyond cricket==
After his retirement Taibu moved to Liverpool, England. He joined Hightown St. Mary&#x27;s Cricket Club in 2016 as a player-coach-development-officer in the second-division of the Liverpool &amp; District Cricket Competition. While writing his autobiography he realised that he would have to return to Zimbabwe. In June 2016 he accepted a role as Zimbabwe Cricket&#x27;s convener of selectors and development officer, with the encouragement of Peter Chingoka. Brendan Taylor and Kyle Jarvis left county deals in September 2017 to play again for Zimbabwe, fruit of Taibu&#x27;s efforts to entice them back.

In 2019, Taibu wrote a book titled &#x27;Keeper of Faith&#x27;, in which he discusses socio-political situation in Zimbabwe, his childhood beatings, perception after witnessing privileged white cricketers and threats by receiving photos of dead bodies.

<text>Rebecca Blaikie is a Canadian politician, who served as president of the New Democratic Party (NDP) from 2011 to 2016.

She is the daughter of Bill Blaikie, a former NDP Member of Parliament from Winnipeg, deputy leader of the party, and provincial cabinet minister. Her brother Daniel Blaikie was elected as Member of Parliament for their father&#x27;s former riding of Elmwood—Transcona in 2015.

She has an undergraduate degree in Canadian social history from the University of Winnipeg and a graduate degree in community economic development from Concordia University&#x27;s School of Community and Public Affairs.

==Candidate for the New Democratic Party==
Blaikie was a candidate for the NDP in the 2004 Canadian federal election in then-Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s electoral district of LaSalle—Émard in Montreal, Quebec. She received 4.4 per cent of the vote, coming in fourth place. She did, however, receive a large amount of press coverage.

As executive director of the party&#x27;s Quebec wing, she was one of the architects of Tom Mulcair&#x27;s historic victory in the 2007 Outremont by-election—he became the first New Democrat to win a federal seat in Quebec since Phil Edmonston in the 1990 Chambly by-election, and Outremont had voted Liberal in every election since its creation except for the Progressive Conservative win of 1988. She was also widely credited with setting the groundwork for the party&#x27;s historic breakthrough in the province in the 2011 election.

She then returned to Manitoba to work for the provincial government. She ran in the 2011 federal election in the district of Winnipeg North, receiving 35.41 per cent of the vote, narrowly losing to incumbent Kevin Lamoureux of the Liberal Party by 44 votes (0.17 per cent).

==NDP treasurer and president==
Blaikie was elected treasurer of the NDP at its 2009 convention in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She was reelected at the 2011 convention in Vancouver, alongside Brian Topp, who had been elected president. After Jack Layton&#x27;s death, Topp resigned as party president to run in the leadership race. As the party&#x27;s federal council may fill vacancies with one of its own members, it chose Blaikie to fill the seat of president. Blaikie was re-elected as president at the 2013 Montreal convention.

One of Blaikie&#x27;s first notable acts as party president was to preside over the 2012 leadership election, which Tom Mulcair won.

Her term as president of the NDP ended in 2016. At the party&#x27;s convention in April 2016, Marit Stiles was selected as her successor.

<text>Colin Everton Hunte Croft (born 15 March 1953) is a former West Indian international cricketer. He was a member of the squad which won the 1979 Cricket World Cup.

==Cricket career==
Croft was (along with Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, and Joel Garner) part of the potent West Indian quartet of fast bowlers from the late 70s and early 80s. With his height (), he bowled bouncers and was very aggressive. He was renowned for bowling wide of the crease over the wicket and angling the ball in to right-handers. His approach to the wicket was unconventional and footage of Croft bowling around the wicket show him on a run-up more typical of a &quot;left&quot;-arm bowler. Croft&#x27;s figures of 8/29 against Pakistan in 1977 are still the best Test innings figures by a fast bowler from the West Indies.

Croft was involved in a number of controversial incidents during the ill-tempered test series with New Zealand in 1979–80. During the Second Test at Christchurch&#x27;s Lancaster Park in February 1980, the West Indies considered umpire Fred Goodall&#x27;s officiating so poor that they refused to emerge from their dressing room after the tea break on Day 3 unless Goodall was immediately replaced. After 11 minutes, they were persuaded to resume. Croft collided with Goodall at the end of his bowling run-up during the fourth day&#x27;s play after knocking a bail off the stumps with a previous delivery, unhappy at being no-balled frequently and having a caught-behind appeal turned down. West Indies captain Clive Lloyd later regretted not taking a firmer line with his players.

==County career==
Lance Gibbs arranged for Croft to go to Warwickshire on a coaching scholarship in 1972 where he played two games in the second eleven. With Warwickshire already having a quartet of West Indies Test players, no opportunity presented itself at the Midlands county, but Croft did play for Lancashire in 1977, 1978 and 1982 taking 136 wickets at 26.5 in first class matches.

==Rebel tour==
In 1982 Croft accepted a place on the rebel tour of apartheid-divided South Africa, in violation of an international ban on sports tours of the country. The rebel players were granted &quot;honorary whites&quot; status by the South African government to allow them access to all-white cricket playing areas. However, there was controversy when Croft was ejected from a whites only seating compartment on a train out of Johannesburg. All the players who took part in the tour were banned for life from international cricket, thus marking the end of Croft&#x27;s cricket playing career. Croft moved to the United States to avoid recriminations at home. The ban was effectively lifted in 1989, by both the WICB and the UN.

==Teaching career==
Croft taught maths at Lambrook school in Winkfield Row, Berkshire, UK, in 2007–2008 for one and a half terms. He never coached cricket at the school.

==Media career==
Since 1994, Croft has been doing cricket coverage part-time, as a commentator/analyst, and was one of the first writers for CricInfo, contributing over 500 articles so far to that entity. He has continued his sports journalism career everywhere that cricket is played, covering West Indies tours since 1994.

Croft&#x27;s first overseas sports journalism sojourn was to the United Kingdom in 1995. During the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup Croft provided analysis for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Test Match Special&quot; radio coverage on all the Guyana-based matches. He continued his analyst&#x27;s role during the West Indies tour of England the same year.

In his private life, having been an Air Traffic Controller from 1973 to 1981, while also playing cricket for the West Indies cricket team, he has also obtained a Commercial Airline Pilot&#x27;s licence in the US, with endorsements for the UK, and worked as a Commercial Pilot in the Caribbean.

He also regularly appears as a studio guest on Sky Sports when West Indies are playing.

<text>Angus Robert Charles Fraser (born 8 August 1965) is an English cricket administrator. 

He served as the managing director of Middlesex Cricket between 2009 and 2021, before assuming a new role heading the club&#x27;s academy.

He is currently serving as Managing Director of the Middlesex in the Community charity.

He is also a former English cricketer, journalist and England selector.

Fraser played in forty-six Test matches and forty-two One Day Internationals for England. Cricket commentator Colin Bateman commented that Fraser was &quot;a reliable, intelligent and hard-working bowler&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Billinge Higher End, Lancashire, Fraser was educated at the Gayton High School in Harrow, London and Orange Hill High School, Edgware, Greater London.

==Cricket career==
Fraser began his career with Middlesex in 1984, helping them to win the County Championship in 1985, 1990 and 1993. He also helped Middlesex to win the 1988 NatWest Trophy, taking 3–36 in the final, and the 1990 Refuge Assurance Cup.

He made his Test match debut with England in 1989 against Australia. In his fourth Test in 1990 he took his first five-wicket haul in Tests, in the process helping England to their first Test victory over the West Indies for sixteen years and 30 Tests. However England missed his contributions when he was forced to withdraw from this series with injury, as was the case during the Ashes series the following winter. A hip injury then kept him out of Test cricket for two and a half years, but he made an immediate impact on his return at the Oval in 1993, taking eight wickets as England recorded their first Test victory over Australia for 18 Tests and six and a half years.
Perhaps his finest hour came in the Barbados Test match of the 1993/94 West Indies tour when Fraser took 8–75 in the first innings to help set up a famous victory, West Indies&#x27; first defeat at Bridgetown for over half a century. His career-best first-class cricket innings bowling figures of 8–53 were taken in a Test match and against the same opposition, this time at Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, in 1997/98. Despite taking eight wickets in that innings, and Test career best match figures of 11–110, he was not named Man of the Match which was awarded to Carl Hooper, from the victorious West Indies side. In all, Fraser toured the West Indies three times, and as of 2022, he has taken more Test wickets in the West Indies than any other visiting bowler.

His one-day international highest score of 38 not out was made late in the innings at number 10, which included a massive six off Steve Waugh and almost brought England back from the brink of defeat against Australia during the 1990/91 tour (Australia won by three runs). Another fine moment with the bat was in a last-wicket second-innings stand with Robert Croft to save the Third Test at Old Trafford against South Africa in 1998. According to the recollection of then England coach David Lloyd, as Fraser went out to face the bowling of Allan Donald, Fraser said :&quot;‘The only way he&#x27;ll get me out is if he knocks me through all three [stumps].’ I said: &#x27;He probably will, Gus, but good luck&#x27;. But he survived. A red-inker it was and in retrospect one of the most important innings of the series&quot;.
 Fraser&#x27;s short innings indeed helped to reverse the momentum in the series, Fraser taking three fivefers in the next two Tests to help England to an unlikely series victory. He also toured New Zealand and South Africa, and played in one-day tournaments in Asia, representing England. Throughout his career he used a bat nicknamed the &quot;Gussy Hitter&quot;, the blade of which was designed by his mother.

Fraser last played for England during the 1999 Cricket world cup. Although born in Lancashire, Fraser played all of his county cricket for Middlesex in a first-class career lasting until 2002; he served as county captain from 2001 until his retirement in 2002.

After that, he worked as the cricket correspondent of &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper (2002–2009), until his appointment to the newly created role of managing director of Cricket by Middlesex County Cricket Club in January 2009. He is a regular contributor to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Test Match Special&quot; and a cricket pundit for Sky Sports.

In the 1996 edition of &quot;Wisden&quot;, Fraser was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.

Fraser served as the managing director of cricket at Middlesex County Cricket Club between 2009 and 2021. He assumed a new role in heading the club&#x27;s academy in July 2021. 
He also served as a selector for the England cricket team for a period after 2014.

==Personal life==

He now resides in Pinner with his wife Denise and two children, Alex and Bethan. In 2008, in his first managerial role, Fraser secured the U15 Middlesex Schools Association County Cup with The John Lyon School, where his son was in the squad.

Fraser is a fan of, and regular visitor to, Wealdstone Football Club.

<doc id="897201" wikidata="Q1147028" url="?curid=897201" title="Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line">
<text>The is a subway line in Tokyo, Japan, operated by Tokyo Metro. The line runs in a U-shape between Ogikubo Station in Suginami and Ikebukuro Station in Toshima, with a branch line between Nakano-Sakaue Station and Hōnanchō Station. The official name is .

The line was named after the Marunouchi business district in Chiyoda, Tokyo, under which it passes. On maps, diagrams and signboards, the line is shown using the color red, and its stations are given numbers using the letters &quot;M&quot; for the main line and &quot;Mb&quot; for the branch line.

==Overview==
The Marunouchi Line is the second line to be built in the city, and the first one constructed after the Second World War. The route is U-shaped, running from Ogikubo Station in the west of the city via the commercial and administrative district of Shinjuku through to the Marunouchi commercial center around Tokyo Station, before turning back and heading to Ikebukuro. Along with the Ginza Line, it is self-enclosed and does not have any through services with other railway lines.

The Marunouchi Line is served by Tokyo Metro 02 series rolling stock in six-car trains on the main line, and mostly three-car trains on the Hōnanchō branch (some six-car trains during peak hours). The main line was the most frequent subway line in Tokyo, with trains once running at intervals of 1 minute 50 seconds during peak hours. In spite of such high-frequency service, according to the 2018 survey by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, the Marunouchi Line is one of the most crowded railway lines in Tokyo, running at 169% capacity between Shin-ōtsuka and Myōgadani stations. Its age and relatively short train length has made it one of the most crowded lines in Tokyo, although the 2000 opening of the Toei Ōedo Line has relieved the problem somewhat. In response to crowding, Tokyo Metro upgraded all stations with chest-high platform doors on March 28, 2009, a date on which it also began driver-only operation. The Hōnanchō branch switched to driver-only operation in July 2004.

Due to the age of the Marunouchi Line and the relative shallowness at which it runs, at several points in central Tokyo trains run at or above ground level. These include Yotsuya Station, the Kanda River near Ochanomizu Station, and between Kōrakuen and Myōgadani stations.

On maps, diagrams and signboards, the line is shown using the color red. Its stations are given numbers using the prefix &quot;M&quot;; Hōnanchō branch line stations carry the prefix &quot;Mb&quot;, which replaced the previously used lowercase &quot;m&quot; prefix in November 2016.

== Station list ==
* All stations are located in Tokyo.
* Some trains leave the main line at Nakano-sakaue (M-06) for the Marunouchi Branch Line to Hōnanchō.
===Main Line===
===Branch Line (Honancho Line)===
==Rolling stock==

Marunouchi Line services are operated using a fleet of 53 Tokyo Metro 02 series six-car EMUs in service since 1988 together with six three-car sets used on Hōnanchō branch services until September 2022. All trains are based at Koishikawa and Nakano Depots.

A fleet of 53 new Tokyo Metro 2000 series six-car trains was scheduled to be introduced from fiscal 2018, replacing the 02 series trains by fiscal 2025.
On February 23, 2019, the 2000 series started operation.

===Former===
* TRTA 500 series/TRTA 300/TRTA 400 series/TRTA 500 series/TRTA 900 series (from 1954 until 1996, later sold and exported for use on Line B of the Buenos Aires Underground)
* TRTA 100 series (from 1962 until 1968, transferred from Ginza Line, used for Hōnanchō branch only)
* TRTA 2000 series (from 1968 until 1993, used for Hōnanchō branch only)

==History==
The Marunouchi Line is the second subway line to be built in the city, and the first to be constructed after the Second World War. Its design is similar to that of the Ginza Line, the oldest subway line in Tokyo. Both lines are standard gauge and use third rail power, unlike subsequent Tokyo subway lines which use overhead wires and are mostly narrow gauge to accommodate through services with other railway lines.

In a 1925 plan for a five-line subway system, the Marunouchi Line was planned to run from Shinjuku to Ōtsuka via Hibiya, Tsukiji and Okachimachi, as a underground route. A segment between Akasaka-mitsuke and Yotsuya began construction in 1942, but was abandoned in 1944 as a result of the continuing effects of World War II. On December 7, 1946, the Marunouchi Line was revised to begin from Nakano-fujimichō to the Mukōhara neighbourhood in Toshima Ward via Kanda and Ikebukuro, for a total length of . On March 30, 1951, a groundbreaking ceremony was held at Ikebukuro Station East Exit to begin construction of the initial segment of the Marunouchi Line.

The first section was opened between Ikebukuro and Ochanomizu on January 20, 1954. The subsequent progress of the line was as follows:
*Ochanomizu to Awajichō: March 1956
*Awajichō to Tokyo: July 1956
*Tokyo to Nishi-Ginza (now Ginza): December 1957
*Nishi-Ginza to Kasumigaseki: October 1958
*Kasumigaseki to Shinjuku: March 1959
*Shinjuku to Shin-Nakano/Nakano-Fujimichō (not Nishi-Shinjuku): February 1961
*Shin-Nakano to Minami-Asagaya (not Higashi-Kōenji): November 1961
*Minami-Asagaya to Ogikubo: January 23, 1962

The Marunouchi Line was one of the lines targeted in the Aum sarin gas attack on March 20, 1995. A plan to extend the Marunouchi Line from Ogikubo to Asaka City in Saitama Prefecture was rejected in the late 1990s.

The line, stations, rolling stock, and related facilities were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

Automatic train control (ATC) was activated on the Marunouchi Line on February 27, 1998, which allowed for an increase in the maximum operating speed limit from to . This was followed by train automatic stopping controller (TASC) which was introduced in November 2002, along with automatic train operation (ATO) which was introduced on the main segment of the Marunouchi Line on December 27, 2008. The platform-edge doors at Hōnanchō Station, the terminus of the Hōnanchō Branch, were lengthened to allow six-car trains to use the station, with work starting in 2013, which enabled through trains to and from Ikebukuro to start operating all the way to Hōnanchō from fiscal 2017.

With the start of the revised timetable on December 7, 2024, the Marunouchi Line became the first subway line in Japan to adopt communications-based train control (CBTC) signalling. The new system allows for shorter intervals between trains and improved delay recovery.

<text>Grant William Flower (born 20 December 1970) is a Zimbabwean cricket coach and former cricketer. He was the batting coach of the Sri Lanka cricket team, Pakistan cricket team, and Sussex.

He is rated among the best Zimbabwean cricketers in history for his consistent left arm spin and fine batting skills. He was a fitness fanatic who spent hours in the gym, and was also regarded as a brilliant fielder who was usually seen in the gully. &quot;Flower Power&quot;, the combination of Grant and his brother Andy Flower, was the mainstay of Zimbabwean batting for a decade. He was his team&#x27;s most successful opening batsman who played the role of anchorman, with strokeplayers coming in down the order.

He played a lead role in, arguably, Zimbabwe&#x27;s finest Test victory, against a strong Pakistan side. He would show a liking for the Pakistani side over his career, averaging over 40 against them and scoring 3 centuries including an unbeaten 201. In July 2014, he was appointed as batting coach of the Pakistan cricket team for a period of two years but went onto serve in the position until August 2019.

He was also the first batsman to have carried his bat across two different formats and also the only batsman to have carried out his bat in both ODIs as well as in tests.

==Early days==
Grant Flower was born in Salisbury, Rhodesia and was educated along with his brother Andy at North Park School where they were the best players in their age groups. Although always an allrounder, he bowled seamers in his early days and his bowling was rated more than his batting. He changed to spin bowling in high school. Quite clearly, Flower is part of the famous talent production line from St George&#x27;s College, which also includes England cricketers Sam Curran and Tom Curran as well as New Zealand international Colin de Grandhomme among a plethora of other internationally capped players.

In the summer of 1990–91 his elevation to a professional cricketer was confirmed when he was employed by the Zimbabwe Cricket Union. His debut first-class game for Zimbabwe came against England A. In his second match he opened the innings and was rewarded with a fifty adding what would be the first of many century partnerships with his brother Andy.

At just 19, Flower was part of the 1990 ICC tournament where the winner would qualify for the World Cup. Zimbabwe would go on to win the competition with Grant Flower scoring heavily in the early games. Had they not won the competition it is likely that Zimbabwe would not have made their rise to Test cricket, at least not until much later. Grant Flower missed out on the 1992 World Cup due to injury. In 1990, Grant spent a season in England with Winscombe Cricket Club, followed by Widnes Cricket Club in the Manchester and District Cricket Association in 1993. He also spent a season at Barnt Green Cricket Club of the Birmingham Leaguein 1995.

==International career==
===Test career===

After the World Cup Zimbabwe were promoted to Test status and Flower was unanimously selected to play against the Indian team for the Inaugural Test match on 18 October 1992. On a flat pitch, he opened the batting for his country and dominated in a 100 run opening stand. He would go on to score 82, falling short of a century on Test debut. Zimbabwe again met the Indian team this time on their home turf and again fell just short of a maiden Test century when he fell for 96.

Pakistan toured Zimbabwe in 1995 and in the 1st Test Flower finally scored his maiden Test century. Not content, he went on to register double hundred. He hit only 12 boundaries and faced 523 balls as Zimbabwe scored a massive 4/544 declared. His innings would help Zimbabwe to win their first Test match as they won by a convincing Innings and 64 Runs. He would continue to haunt the Pakistani side, scoring his second Test century at Sheikhupura Stadium in Pakistan.

In 1997 Flower became the first Zimbabwean to score a century in both innings of a Test match. Playing against New Zealand in Harare, he scored 104 and 151. A year later he scored his 5th Test century, an innings of 156 not out at Queens Sports Club against Pakistan. He would suffer a form slump after that innings, not scoring a 99 for 33 innings including 6 ducks. On 25 November 2000 he ended his slump with a fine 106 against India and would go on to score 4 50&#x27;s in his next 6 innings.

===One Day International career===

By the end of his ODI career, Flower had taken more wickets than any other Zimbabwean bowler except Heath Streak. His ODI statistics make better reading than his Test statistics. He would score 6 ODI tons and had it not been for the nervous nineties may have had many more. 9 times he was either unbeaten or dismissed in the 90&#x27;s. One of his most memorable centuries would come in the final of a one-day triangular tournament in Bangladesh. Playing against Kenya he smashed an 82 ball century and finished with 140, just 2 short of the national record at the time. He holds the record for taking the most catches as fielder for Zimbabwe in ODI history(86)

Flower more importantly was the first batsman to carry his bat right through the completed innings of an ODI. He also holds the unique record for being the only batsman in ODI cricket to have carried his bat in a One Day International match in a winning cause.

===Late career===
In 2004 he announced his retirement from international cricket. This was due largely to the dispute between the rebels and the Zimbabwean Cricket Union. He signed a contract with Essex as a Kolpak player where he played alongside his brother Andy. There was some grumbling amongst Essex supporters at his signing, but this appeared to die down after his first season, when he topped the Essex 2005 List-A batting averages and was third in the number of wickets taken.

===Return===
Following another fine season for Essex which turned out to be his last season of county cricket, Flower was handed a shock recall to the Zimbabwe team for the tour of South Africa. He was expected to combine playing duties with his role of batting coach of the national side and was in contention to play in the 2011 Cricket World Cup held in India. He made his international return in October 2010 during the first ODI of the three-match series against South Africa.

==Coaching career==
He was appointed as the batting coach of Zimbabwe in October 2010 and served in the position until 2013. In May 2014, he was appointed as the batting coach of Pakistan cricket team. His contract was ended in August 2019 by PCB after Pakistan&#x27;s dismal performance at the 2019 Cricket World Cup. He was instrumental in Pakistan&#x27;s triumph at the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy which Flower himself considers as his personal achievement. He was appointed as the head coach of Rangpur Riders for the 2019–20 Bangladesh Premier League.

In December 2019, he was appointed as the batting coach of Sri Lanka for a contract of two years. On 8 July 2021, he was tested positive for COVID-19 on his return to Sri Lanka from England following the limited overs series between Sri Lanka and England. It was revealed that Flower is under stable position along with Sri Lanka cricket data analyst GT Niroshan.

<text>The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (previously, &quot;Princess Margaret Hospital&quot;) is a scientific research centre and a teaching hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, affiliated with the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine as part of the University Health Network. The hospital now stands as the largest cancer centre in Canada and one of the five largest cancer centres in the world. Along with the Odette Cancer Centre, which is also associated with University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine and is independently the sixth largest cancer centre in North America, it forms one of the largest cluster of cancer hospitals in the world.

The hospital is situated near the intersection of University Avenue and College Street within the Discovery District of downtown Toronto, an area with high concentration of biomedical research institutions. Named for Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, the hospital is under the royal patronage of Anne, Princess Royal.

The hospital specializes in the treatment of cancer, and offers the majority of its services to residents of the Greater Toronto Area. The hospital offers surgical oncology, medical oncology, hematology including bone marrow transplantation, radiation oncology, psychosocial oncology, medical imaging, and radiation therapy.

The hospital houses 17 radiation treatment machines, all of which are equipped with technologies including IMRT and VMAT, a superficial orthovoltage machine, and operates a Gamma Knife (Perfexion) stereotactic radiosurgery machine in collaboration with Toronto Western Hospital.

==Education==
As a teaching hospital of the University of Toronto, the hospital provides training to various medical professions. Most notable are clinical programs for medical doctors (medical and radiation oncologists) and radiation therapists.

==Research==
Its related research arm, the Ontario Cancer Institute (OCI), works in conjunction with the hospital in a mutually beneficial relationship. Many researchers at the OCI hold appointments at the University of Toronto, often within the Department of Medical Biophysics. The Princess Margaret&#x27;s research program ranked fourth in terms of the percentage of publications cited in high-impact oncology journals.

==History==
The hospital was founded as the Ontario Cancer Institute in 1952 by an Act of the Ontario legislature. Designed by the architect Henry Sproatt, it was originally located at 500 Sherbourne Street (now a condo complex) near the former Wellesley Hospital.

During health restructuring legislated by the Harris Government in the late 1990s Princess Margaret Hospital merged with what was then named The Toronto Hospital, which was the entity formed by the previous merger of the Toronto General Hospital and the Toronto Western Hospital, and the new combined organization was named University Health Network (UHN) with the three separate hospitals maintaining their own identities within the new hospital corporation.

<text>Desmond Leo Haynes (born 15 February 1956) is a former Barbadian cricketer and cricket coach who played for the West Indies cricket team between 1978 and 1994. He was a member of the squads which won the 1979 Cricket World Cup as well as finishing as runners-up at the 1983 Cricket World Cup.

Haynes favoured a more measured approach to batting and scored 7,487 runs in 116 Test matches at an average of 42.29, his highest Test innings of 184 coming against England in 1980. He is one of the few Test batsman to have been dismissed handled the ball, falling in this fashion against India on 24 November 1983. He is also one of the few players to have scored a century on an ODI debut.

He was rated by &quot;Trinidad and Tobago Guardian&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest of all time&quot;, while the BBC described him as &quot;one of the greatest opening partnerships in history with fellow Barbadian Gordon Greenidge.&quot; The cricket almanac &quot;Wisden&quot; noted his &quot;combination of timing and barely evident power&quot;, and named him one of their Cricketers of the Year in 1991. In June 2021, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame as one of the special inductees to mark the inaugural edition of the ICC World Test Championship final.

==International career==

He first made his name on the international scene with 148 at Antigua in a One-Day International against Australia and until recently Haynes held a number of ODI records, including most runs and most centuries. His 148 against Australia came on his debut match in One Day International which still remains the highest run ever made by a batsman on debut in ODI as well as the fastest century scored by an ODI debutant. He played in the World Cup of 1979, won by the West Indies, and returned to the competition in 1983, 1987 and 1992. In the 25 World Cup matches, Haynes scored 854 runs at 37.13 with three fifties and one century. As of 10 December 2013 Haynes remains one of the only two players in the history of ODI cricket to have scored century on both debut and last match played, the only other being English batsman Dennis Amiss.

Haynes, when facing Australia in the bitter 1990–91 series, clashed verbally with Ian Healy, Merv Hughes, Craig McDermott and David Boon, who christened him &#x27;Dessie&#x27;. He is also noted for using delaying tactics against England during the 1989–90 Test series.

Like most West Indian openers, Haynes was strong against pace and, after struggling against spin early in his career, developed into a strong player of slow bowling, exemplified by his knocks of 75 and 143 against Australia on an SCG dustbowl in 1989. Haynes had a successful career in English county cricket, playing 95 first-class games for Middlesex, scoring 7071 runs at 49.1 with a best of 255* against Sussex. He was awarded his Middlesex cap in 1989 and played at Lords till 1994. He played 63 first-class matches for Barbados from 1976/77 to 1994/95, scoring 4843 at 49.92 with a top score of 246 and 21 games for Western Province from 1994/95 to 1996/97, making 1340 runs at 40.6 with a best of 202*. In all first class cricket, he made 26030 runs at 45.90 and 15651 more in 419 one day games at 42.07 with a top score of 152*. He scored 61 first-class hundreds in all and won 55-man of the match awards in all forms of the game.

Haynes was only the third West Indian to carry his bat in a Test innings. He is one of only two players in international Test Cricket to achieve this feat three times, the other being Dean Elgar. Haynes announced his retirement in March 1997 after playing a first-class game for Western Province against Natal in Cape Town. He made 83 in the first innings and was dismissed for a third-ball duck in the second and his last.

===Centuries===

Haynes scored centuries (100 or more runs in an innings) in Test matches and One Day International (ODI) matches on 18 and 17 occasions respectively during his international career.

His first Test century came in February 1980 against New Zealand at the Carisbrook, Dunedin, a match the West Indies lost by one wicket. His highest score of 184 runs came the same year against England at the Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, London. Five of his Test centuries came against Australia. Haynes scored Test centuries at twelve cricket grounds, against five different opponents, including eight at venues outside the West Indies. As of August 2013, he is seventh in the list of Test century-makers for the West Indies.

He scored a century on his ODI debut in February 1978 against Australia at the Antigua Recreation Ground, St John&#x27;s. His score of 148 runs in the match earned him a man of the match award, resulting in the West Indies&#x27; win. His highest score in ODIs remained 152 runs, against India at the Bourda, Georgetown in March 1989. Due to his man-of-the-match performance, the West Indies won the match by 101 runs, and the series 5–0. He was most successful against Australia making six ODI centuries against them. As of August 2013, Haynes is the third in the list of ODI century-makers for the West Indies, and sixteenth overall among all-time combined century-makers.

==Post retirement==
After retirement as player, Haynes has served as Chairman of Selectors of the Barbados Cricket Association, President of Carlton Cricket Club, Secretary of the West Indies Players Association and is currently a Director of the West Indies Cricket Board. He is a former Government Senator and was Chairman of the National Sports Council. His main relaxation is golf. A biography &quot;Lion of Barbados&quot; was published about him, punning on his middle name &#x27;Leo&#x27;.

<doc id="897216" wikidata="Q3763998" url="?curid=897216" title="Michael Holding">
<text>Michael Anthony Holding (born 16 February 1954) is a Jamaican former cricketer and commentator who played for the West Indies cricket team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest pace bowlers in cricket history, he was nicknamed &quot;Whispering Death&quot; due to his undramatic but effective bowling style.

Holding was a key member of the West Indies team that won the 1979 Cricket World Cup, as well as finishing as runners-up at the 1983 Cricket World Cup. He had the most wickets for his team at the 1979 tournament. His bowling action was renowned for being smooth and extremely fast, and he used his height () to generate large amounts of bounce and zip off the pitch. He was part of the fearsome West Indian pace bowling battery, together with Andy Roberts, Joel Garner, Colin Croft, Wayne Daniel, Malcolm Marshall and Sylvester Clarke, that devastated opposing batting line-ups throughout the world in the late seventies and early eighties. Early in his Test career, in 1976, Holding broke the record for best bowling figures in a Test match by a West Indies bowler, 14 wickets for 149 runs (14/149). The record still stands.

During his first-class cricket career, Holding played for Jamaica, Canterbury, Derbyshire, Lancashire, and Tasmania. In September 2021, Holding announced his retirement from being a commentator.

==Early life==
Michael Anthony Holding was born on 16 February 1954, the youngest of four children to Ralph and Enid Holding who lived in Half Way Tree, Kingston. In an interview in 2020, Holding stated that his mother&#x27;s family disowned her because her husband&#x27;s skin was too dark. The family was passionate about sport, and only a few years after Michael was born his father enrolled him as a member of Melbourne Cricket Club in Kingston. At the age of three he was diagnosed with asthma, but by his early teenage years this had passed and he no longer needed an inhaler. He led an active life, playing sport in the scrubland and wooded areas near his home. Though his family would often watch the cricket at Sabina Park, Holding preferred to play rather than watch.

==Cricketing career==

===Early career===
In late 1975 the West Indies team embarked on a six-Test tour of Australia. Earlier that year the West Indies had defeated Australia in the final of the inaugural World Cup, and the teams were considered to be the best of their day. Fast bowler Bernard Julien was out of form and his place in the team was given to debutant Michael Holding who opened the bowling with Andy Roberts. He picked up a groin strain in the second Test and bowled as fast as , quicker than Jeff Thomson, Australia&#x27;s fastest bowler. According to &quot;Wisden&quot; in his debut series, Holding &quot;had shown himself to be Roberts&#x27; natural opening partner and indeed was timed to be faster than Jeff Thomson, Dennis Lillee and Andy Roberts, and considered that when West Indies captain Clive Lloyd chose to give Julien the new ball rather than Holding it was a mistake that cost the West Indies the match. Australia won the series 5–1, and though Holding&#x27;s 10 wickets in 5 matches cost on average more than 60 runs each, &quot;Wisden&quot; believed that he had performed well enough to establish himself in the side and had the potential to bowl faster still.

India visited the West Indies in March for a four-Test series. The defeat by Australia had left Andy Roberts exhausted, so he was rested for the matches against India and Holding took over as leader of the West Indies bowling attack. He finished as his team&#x27;s leading wicket taker (second in the series to Indian leg spinner B. S. Chandrasekhar) with 19 wickets at less than 20 runs each and helped his team to a 2–1 victory.

The West Indies toured England in 1976, and though Holding was largely unknown in the country, the British press noted his performance in Australia and there was a sense of anticipation about his bowling. An early psychological blow was landed by the West Indies in a warm up match against the M.C.C. when Holding struck Dennis Amiss on the head, leaving a wound that needed stitches. Amiss was a veteran player and was likely to open for England in the forthcoming Tests and seeing him struggle against Holding&#x27;s pace was a warning of things to come. In the lead up to the series, the South African-born England captain Tony Greig was very confident of his team&#x27;s chances, saying in an interview &quot;I like to think people are building these West Indians up, because I&#x27;m not really sure they&#x27;re as good as everyone thinks. You must remember, that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top they are magnificent cricketers. But if they&#x27;re down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey (Brian Close) and a few others, to make them grovel.&quot; His comments outraged the West Indians, and to many the use of the term &quot;grovel&quot; in particular was highly offensive, as it &quot;smacked of racism and apartheid&quot;.
The West Indies fast bowling attack consisted of Roberts, Holding, Wayne Daniel, and Vanburn Holder. The first three used the bouncer liberally (&quot;Wisden&quot; notes that Holding in particular bowled &quot;exceptionally fast&quot;), and England&#x27;s experienced John Edrich and Brian Close suffered in particular, both being struck on the torso many times (Close was already 45 when the series started in June, and Edrich turned 39 during the second Test). In the first innings of the fifth Test, played at the Oval, Holding took 8 wickets for 92 runs which remained the best bowling figures of his first-class career and were the best bowling figures by a West Indies bowler at the ground. He took a further 6 wickets in the match to finish with 14/149, which remain the best match figures by a West Indian in a Test match. The West Indies won the five match series 3–0.

According to an urban myth, during a Test match between the West Indies and England when Holding was to bowl to English player Peter Willey, the BBC radio commentator at the time, Brian Johnston, described the action as &quot;The bowler&#x27;s Holding, the batsman&#x27;s Willey&quot; (a double entendre, as &quot;willy&quot; is British English slang for a penis). However &quot;Wisden&quot; states that there is no record of Johnston or anyone else actually saying this (although a colleague of Johnston&#x27;s, Henry Blofeld, has said he recalls the incident occurring during a Test match at The Oval in 1976.) In a limited-overs international between England and West Indies on 26 August 1976 at Scarborough, Michael Holding&#x27;s return from long-leg deflected off the nearer wicket, breaking the bails, and then scuttled along the pitch to also break the far wicket, with Graham Barlow and Alan Knott, on his only appearance as England&#x27;s captain, stranded in mid-pitch. This highly unusual occurrence of both wickets being broken by one throw dumbfounded the umpires, David Constant and Arthur Jepson, who rejected the run-out appeal for unknown reasons. The West Indies played 26 first-class matches on the tour, winning 18 and losing only two, making them the most successful side ever to tour England.

===World Series Cricket===
After the 1976 series against England, Holding enrolled at the University of the West Indies on a scholarship to study Computer Science. As a profession, cricket did not pay particularly well at the time, even for the stars of the sport, and Holding was preparing himself for employment after his retirement. A shoulder injury sustained towards the end of the 1976 tour of England prevented Holding from joining the West Indies squad to face Pakistan in March 1977. During the series Lloyd approached Holding about a joining a proposed World XI team, captained by England&#x27;s Tony Greig, to play against Australia in World Series Cricket; at the time there was still animosity between Greig and the West Indies players over Greig&#x27;s &#x27;grovel&#x27; comment before the 1976 Test series in England. The series was the brainchild of Kerry Packer after his television channel, Channel 9, had missed out on the rights to broadcast Australia&#x27;s home Test series. Players would be paid much more than they had been before, and with his earnings from the series Holding was able to buy his first car and later a house. When the World Series Cricket plan became public, the Australian Cricket Board and England Cricket Board both threatened to ban any of their players taking part. Packer responded to the pressure by signing the whole West Indies team to compete in the series alongside a World XI and an Australian team. Relegated to playing at football grounds rather than cricket stadiums, the series initially suffered from poor crowds. The negative press surrounding the World Series – players were labelled mercenaries – bred a sense of camaraderie in the West Indies side, which contributed to the team&#x27;s dominance in the Test arena for years to come.

In March 1978, after the first season of World Series Cricket, Australia embarked on a Test tour of the West Indies. Australia were severely depleted because the ACB refused to pick leading players such as Greg Chappell, Ian Chappell, and Dennis Lillee because they had played in the Packer series. Holding suffered a recurrence of his shoulder injury and so missed the series, but otherwise the West Indies began the series at full strength. Eventually external pressure on the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) not to select players who played in the World Series resulted in three players being dropped and Clive Lloyd&#x27;s resignation as captain. The rest of the team refused to play in protest and were replaced by second-choice players. The second year of World Series Cricket was more successful than the first and matches were played in front of much larger crowds. Though contracted to last three years, the competition ended after two because Packer and the ACB came to an agreement regarding broadcasting rights.

===West Indies rampant===
A less amusing incident for which Holding is also remembered was kicking over the stumps in anger at an umpiring decision in New Zealand in 1979/80. The tour had gone poorly almost from the beginning: West Indies had just finished a long, arduous tour of Australia, and were perhaps resentful about having an additional tour to New Zealand immediately afterwards (their leading batsman of the time, Viv Richards, refused to tour). West Indies felt that the umpiring had been largely incompetent and against them throughout. After an appeal for caught behind was turned down, Holding turned and kicked the stumps in frustration.
Holding was the bowler in what is often described as &quot;the greatest over in Test history&quot;, which he bowled in 1981 in Bridgetown to English batsman Geoff Boycott, a highly experienced player who was considered to be somewhat reluctant to face very fast bowling. Holding&#x27;s first five deliveries each increased in pace, causing Boycott to have to react very rapidly and awkwardly to avoid being hit. The final ball simply beat him for speed and Boycott was unable to react at all, being clean bowled to the great delight of the crowd. Boycott later described the experience as one &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t wish on my worst enemy.&quot;

In 1984, batting with Viv Richards, Holding set the record for the highest 10th wicket partnership in ODI history(106*)

Holding opened the bowling for West Indies with Andy Roberts in 33 Tests, and the pair became a feared bowling partnership. They claimed 216 wickets at an average of 25.27 runs each, making them one of the most successful new ball partnerships of all time.

In 2009, Rudi Webster said &quot;It is difficult to overestimate how much the players in [the West Indies team led by Clive Lloyd] were admired and idolised on the cricket field. And off the field they were loved and respected for the manner in which they conducted themselves and for the role they played as outstanding ambassadors.&quot; The Federation of International Cricketers&#x27; Associations inaugurated a Hall of Fame in 1999 and Holding was inducted into it. The FICA Hall of Fame ended in 2003, but all the inductees were given official recognition when they were included in the ICC&#x27;s Hall of Fame on its inauguration in 2009.

==Post-playing career==
Holding has written two autobiographies, the first of which, &quot;Whispering Death&quot;, was published in 1988 before he retired; and the second, &quot;No Holding Back&quot;, over 20 years later in 2010. In July 2021, Holding&#x27;s third book—&quot;Why We Kneel, How We Rise—&quot;was published. Prompted by the positive public reaction to his comments, the book expands upon his theme of how institutionalised racism developed historically and how it affects people of colour, and includes contributions from notable sports stars such as Usain Bolt, Thierry Henry, Michael Johnson and Naomi Osaka. After retiring from cricket, Holding owned a petrol station in Kingston called &quot;Michael Holding&#x27;s Service Centre&quot;, employing several people who were members of Melbourne Cricket Club of which he was a member. The business was initially successful, though Holding found it stressful. Broadcasting began to take up more of his time, and while he was away the petrol station suffered so in 1995 he decided to sell. He also considered taking up umpiring, though not as a profession, and considered pursuing qualifications to umpire in domestic matches in Jamaica but his time was taken up with managing the petrol station and broadcasting.

===Broadcaster and ICC official===
Holding&#x27;s career evolved after his retirement from active play. He had never aspired to becoming a commentator but was friends with a producer at Radio Jamaica who invited him to comment on cricket. This led to him working around the Caribbean, but at this stage work was not regular enough to be his main source of income. Holding made his transition from radio commentator to television in 1990 when cricket in the Caribbean was broadcast on television around the world for the first time. Two local commentators were chosen and Holding was picked alongside Tony Cozier at the latter&#x27;s recommendation.

The ICC created the Bowling Action Review Committee (BARC) in 1999, and on the recommendation of the WICB, Holding was one of the founding members of the committee. The role of the committee was to monitor players suspected of throwing using various video replays. The process of assessing a bowler&#x27;s action has since become more scientific with more technology used and though the committee disbanded in 2005 it was influential in the ICC establishing the 15-degree maximum for bowlers straightening their arms in delivery. Even when working for the BARC, Holding was a strident critic of the ICC so in 2007 when he was approached to join the newly formed ICC cricket committee he thought a friend was playing a joke on him. Holding joined the committee and though he was initially optimistic quit in July 2008 in protest against the ICC&#x27;s decision to overturn the result of the Oval Test between Pakistan and England, which was changed from a forfeit by Pakistan (who chose not to take the field in protest against being accused of ball tampering) to a draw. The forfeiture was later reinstated, and Holding resolved not to rejoin the committee.

=== Criticism on T20 cricket ===
Michael Holding has repeatedly and strongly criticized T20 cricket. Holding has stated &quot;I don&#x27;t think [twenty20] is good for the game... It has its place but it will be bad unless those in charge manage it properly and I do not think they can because they are blinded by money. I can see Test cricket dying because of this.&quot; Despite this he was initially supportive of the Stanford 20/20, believing that the tournament funded by Allen Stanford, who had pledged to put large sums of money into domestic West Indies cricket, could revitalize the long time poorly funded domestic Caribbean cricket scene (the on-field fortunes of the West Indies team had declined rapidly from the mid 1990s onwards). However, with the conception of the Stanford Super Series involving the England Cricket Board in 2008 he became critical of the venture, as he felt that funds which had previously been invested in domestic teams were no longer of any interest to Stanford.

Regarding the IPL, Holding criticized West Indies players such as Jerome Taylor and Chris Gayle who were partaking the 2011 IPL season, rather than playing for their national sides during the home series against Pakistan at the time. He also criticized the West Indies Cricket Board for being too soft by allowing West Indian players to play the IPL, and giving them NOCs with ease. Holding also accused the BCCI for having too much power, and believed they were the main reason for the decline of the West Indies team as they promoted the IPL, and they were dictating the ICC.

Holding, on numerous occasions, has stated that he does not consider the T20 format should even be classed as cricket. He has also stated that it is very difficult for West Indies cricket to return to the top in Test cricket because of T20 and its financial lure to the region&#x27;s best players.

=== Criticism of the BCCI ===

Michael Holding has been a vocal critic of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) due to its disproportionate influence in global cricket. He argues that the financial power of the BCCI enables it to dominate the International Cricket Council (ICC), thus undermining the democratic governance of the sport. Holding believes that no single nation should have such control over the direction of cricket, and he frequently compares this situation to football, where FIFA prevents one nation from exerting undue influence. In particular, Holding has criticized the BCCI&#x27;s stance on the Decision Review System (DRS), highlighting how India&#x27;s objections to the system swayed the ICC&#x27;s decision-making. He advocated for reforms in cricket governance to prevent the financial dominance of boards like the BCCI from undermining the integrity of the sport.
Holding has also expressed frustration with the dominance of the Indian Premier League (IPL), asserting that the BCCI’s control over the tournament compromises the governance of world cricket. In a candid remark, he noted: &quot;I don&#x27;t think one copy (of his book) will be sold in India, because I have nothing good to say about the BCCI and what they are doing with world cricket.&quot; He further criticized the IPL&#x27;s scheduling, stating, &quot;You will never see IPL clashing with an Indian series, never. So they (ICC) are never effective, and the ICC just allows them (BCCI) to run it how they like.&quot; Holding has long called for more equitable governance of the sport to prevent financial interests from overshadowing its true competitive spirit.

===Anti-racism===
In July 2020, during a rain delay in the England v West Indies Test series, Holding was asked on Sky Sports by Ian Ward for his thoughts on the pre-match kneeling of both teams in respect of the Black Lives Matter movement. His widely reported comments on his personal experience of, and his views on, institutionalised racism were widely welcomed as moving, sincere, and eloquently constructive.

==Personal life==

Holding&#x27;s first marriage was to Cherine Holding, a Sri Lankan, who he met when touring Australia in the late 1970s. Their son was born in 1981. He is now married to Laurie-Ann Holding, an indigenous Antiguan; they have no children together. Holding has also fathered three other children from three other relationships, including a daughter born in 1979, and another daughter in 1988, both of whom have Jamaican mothers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Holding spent much of his time in the Cayman Islands.

==Recognition==
In June 1988, Holding was featured on the $2 Jamaican stamp alongside the Barbados Cricket Buckle.

In May 2013, he received an Honorary Degree and Lifetime Achievement Award at the University of East London.

<text>Mervyn Gregory Hughes (born 23 November 1961) is a former Australian cricketer. A right-arm fast bowler, he represented Australia in 53 Test matches between 1985 and 1994, taking 212 wickets. He played 33 One Day Internationals, taking 38 wickets. He took a hat-trick in a Test against the West Indies at the WACA in 1988–89. In 1993, he took 31 wickets in the Ashes series against England. He was a useful lower-order batsman, scoring two half-centuries in Tests and over 1,000 runs in all. He also represented the Victorian Bushrangers, Essex in English county cricket, the ACT Comets and Australia A in the World Series Cup.

==Childhood==
Hughes was born in Euroa, Victoria. He started kindergarten in Apollo Bay and his first year at school came when the family went back to Euroa. Organised sport began in 3rd grade at Werribee. In 5th grade, he pestered his father to be allowed to join football at Werribee where he held his own, despite the fact that he was one of the smallest players when out of his age group. Hughes&#x27; enthusiasm for sport was described as &quot;unquenchable.&quot;

==Domestic career==
Hughes started his career playing district cricket with Footscray in 1978–79. Footscray has subsequently had their main home ground named after him; it is now known as the &quot;Mervyn G. Hughes Oval&quot;. He was selected for Victoria in 1981–82 and made his debut against the South Australian Redbacks.

==International career==
Hughes first appeared for Australia against India in 1985–86. He took 1–123 and was not re-selected until the Ashes series against England the following year.

At the WACA Ground in 1988–89, Hughes completed a hat-trick that was unusual as it was spread across three separate overs, two innings and two different days. He had Curtly Ambrose caught behind with the last ball of his 36th over; ended the West Indies&#x27; first innings in his 37th, by removing Patrick Patterson; and more than a day later, completed his hat-trick by trapping Gordon Greenidge lbw with the first ball of the West Indies&#x27; second innings. Hughes finished the match with career-best figures of 13/217, taking 5/130 in the first innings and 8/87 in the second.

The Australian selectors always viewed Hughes as a Test match player rather than a one-day player. He was generally only selected for the shorter game when another player was injured or otherwise unavailable.

Hughes&#x27; physical presence (a burly 6&#x27;4&quot;), handlebar moustache, a penchant for exuberant displays of affection for his fellow players, along with a tendency to talk to the opposition in inventively colorful language (his nickname was &quot;Fruitfly&quot; – a somewhat incongruous nickname until Allan Border explained it was a reference to &quot;Australia&#x27;s greatest national pest&quot;) and a (some would say) &quot;mincing&quot; run-up (that at times stretched to 45 paces), made him a firm favourite amongst supporters, who would often imitate his warm-up stretches behind him en masse. In England, on his second Ashes tour in 1993, the crowd often chanted &quot;Sumo&quot; when he ran in to bowl.

Hughes played his last Test in Cape Town against South Africa in 1994.

==After cricket==
Late in his career, Hughes undertook a stint with the ACT Comets, which turned out to be unsuccessful. He claimed only five wickets at an average of 46.80 over six matches (Rodney Davison, Jimmy Maher, Jamie Cox, Shaun Young and Ryan Campbell).

Hughes replaced Allan Border in June 2005 as a selector for the Australian cricket team, although his performance as a selector came under much scrutiny after many controversial decisions and the loss of the number-one ranking in Test matches after the 2009 Ashes series. However, Australia would go on to have a successful 2009–10 summer, finishing undefeated in all three forms of the game. Hughes though, was later dropped as a selector for the Australian cricket team and subsequently replaced by Greg Chappell on 29 October 2010.

He is a prominent supporter of the Western Bulldogs in the Australian Football League and has also done some acting, portraying Ivan Milat in the comedy movie Fat Pizza. Additionally, Hughes has appeared on TV commercials as well, featuring losing weight with &quot;The 14-day All-Bran Challenge&quot; and appearing as himself in the English comedy show &quot;Hale and Pace&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hughes was a notorious consumer of alcohol and food. Towards the end of his career, this was felt to have increased damage to his knees and may have ultimately led to a shortening of his Australian and Victorian playing careers. Having always been rather overweight, he participated in both seasons of Channel Nine&#x27;s Celebrity Overhaul to lose weight and improve his fitness. He was the top performer (weight-wise) in the first season of the show.

Hughes is noted for his large handlebar moustache. Described by Cricinfo as being &quot;of incredible proportions&quot;, the moustache became sufficiently synonymous with Hughes for him to be rumored to insure it for £200,000. In a 2013 Sky Sports interview during the 2013 Ashes series, he quashed this rumour as being false.

==Other sports==
Hughes also played Australian rules football during the winter in the late 1970s and early 1980s; at his peak, he was a key position player for the Werribee Football Club in the Victorian Football Association first division.

==In the media==
In 2015, Hughes appeared on the Australian version of the TV show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;.

In an interview for &quot;Hotspur&quot; magazine, Hughes revealed he has supported Tottenham Hotspur since the early 1980s. &quot;I went to a mate&#x27;s house to watch the FA Cup Final, everyone in the house was supporting the other team except the guy I sat next to. He was English, and I told him I was with him 100 per cent. Spurs won and I&#x27;ve supported them ever since.&quot;

<doc id="897229" wikidata="Q5246258" url="?curid=897229" title="Dean Jones (cricketer)">
<text>Dean Mervyn Jones (24 March 196124 September 2020) was an Australian cricket player, coach and commentator who played Tests and One Day Internationals (ODIs) for Australia. He had an excellent record in Test cricket and is best remembered for revolutionising the ODI format. Jones was a part of the Australian team that won their first world title during the 1987 Cricket World Cup. Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was recognised as among the best ODI batsmen in the world, a view which has been validated in the retrospective ICC Player Rankings. His batting was often characterised by his agile footwork against both pace and spin, aggressive running between wickets, and willingness to take risks and intimidate bowlers. In 2019, Jones was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.

==Domestic career==
Jones began his first-class career in the 1981–82 season with Victoria in the Sheffield Shield. Jones also played for Durham and Derbyshire in the English County Championship. Jones captained Derbyshire to second place in the 1996 County Championship, their best finish for 60 years. Jones scored 1,338 runs in the season, more than any other Derbyshire player. He left Derbyshire mid-season in 1997 after disagreements with teammates. Jones also had run-ins with authority and teammates in his home state of Victoria. During his career, he scored 19,188 runs in first-class matches, including 55 centuries and 88 half centuries and a highest score of 324 not out, at an average of 51.85.

==International career==
Jones was selected on the 1984 tour of the West Indies after Graham Yallop had to pull out due to injury. He was not picked in the original XI, but was drafted into the side after Steve Smith fell ill. Jones himself was very ill before the Test, and deemed his score of 48 on his debut as his &quot;best knock&quot;. Between 1984 and 1992, Jones played 52 Test matches for Australia, scoring 3,631 runs, including 11 centuries, at an average of 46.55.

His most notable innings was in only his third Test, against India in the Tied Test in Madras (Chennai) in 1986. Suffering from dehydration in the oppressively hot and humid conditions, Jones was frequently vomiting on the pitch. He wanted to go off the field &quot;retired ill&quot; which led his captain Allan Border to say that if he could not handle the conditions, he would &quot;get a Queenslander&quot; (Greg Ritchie, a Queenslander, was the next man in to bat). This comment spurred Jones to score 210, an innings he considered a defining moment in his career and one of the epic Test innings in Australian cricket folklore. This innings of 210 remains the highest score by an Australian cricketer in India. After his innings, Jones was put on to an intravenous drip.

One of the keys to Australia&#x27;s unexpected victory in the 1987 Cricket World Cup was the batting foundation laid by the top three batsmen - Jones batting at number three behind the openers David Boon and Geoff Marsh. Jones would score a total of 314 runs at an average of 44, with 3 half-centuries. During a 1987 World Cup match against India, one of Jones&#x27; shots was changed from a four to a six during the innings break. Australia later won the match by one run. Jones was quoted as saying that he had spoken to the umpires to demand it was changed to a six.

Jones went on to be a mainstay of the Australian Test team middle order over the next six years and being one of the stars of the successful 1989 Ashes tour of England. He was recognised for his efforts by being named as one of Cricketers of the Year in the 1990 edition of Wisden Almanack. He was controversially dropped from the test team at the start of the 1992–93 season, despite having topped the averages in the previous Test series, against Sri Lanka.

Jones stayed in the one-day team a little longer: he was omitted from the one-day team for the 1993 Ashes tour, but managed to force his way back into the team for one last stint during the 1993–94 season. After Jones was dropped from the eighth and final ODI of the series in South Africa, Jones immediately announced his retirement from ODI cricket.

==After cricket==
After retiring in 1998, he continued to remain involved in cricket as a coach, commentator and writer for &quot;The Age&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;.

He was also a noted fundraiser for people with cancer. On 12 June 2006, in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List, he was made a Member (AM) of the Order of Australia for &quot;service to cricket as a player, coach and commentator, and to the community through fundraising activities for organisations assisting people with cancer&quot;. In 2007, Jones was named in Australia&#x27;s &quot;greatest ever ODI team.&quot; He was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Coaching career==
Jones worked as the head coach of Islamabad United in Pakistan Super League (PSL). During his reign, Islamabad United won the 2016 and 2018 Pakistan Super Leagues. In November 2019, Jones became head coach of PSL team Karachi Kings, replacing Mickey Arthur ahead of the 5th edition of Pakistan Super League.

In October 2017, Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) appointed Jones as the interim head coach for Afghanistan&#x27;s Intercontinental Cup fixture against Hong Kong.

== Commentary career ==
He received the nickname &quot;Professor Deano&quot; after giving a pitch report for a television show by dressing up as a professor prior to the group stage match of the 2004 Asia Cup between India and Sri Lanka which was at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium on 18 July 2004. He eventually emerged as one of the prominent broadcasters in cricket and was known for his work as commentator with Indian Premier League select dugout show in Star Sports. He also served as a summariser for BBC&#x27;s &quot;Test Match Special&quot; and had a brief stint as a commentator in the Tamil Nadu Premier League as well as in the Karnataka Premier League. During his later part of commentary career, he voiced his opinions on reviving international cricket in Pakistan since 2009.

He also toured war-torn Afghanistan to work as a commentator for the fifth edition of the Shpageeza Cricket League in 2017. He narrowly escaped a suicide bomb blast at the Kabul International Cricket Ground  while working as a commentator during a group match of the 2017 Shpageeza Cricket League.

==Controversy==
An incident on 16 January 1993 during the first one-day final of the 1992–93 Benson &amp; Hedges World Series against West Indies at the Sydney Cricket Ground, when he asked paceman Curtly Ambrose to remove the wristband he was wearing on his bowling arm. Jones maintained that he did so because Ambrose wore the same color wristbands as the ball that was used, and that it was hard to determine where it was released, while Ambrose maintained that he wore the wristbands to dry the sweat off of his forehead. Riled by this request, Ambrose went on to take 5/32 for the match. He followed this up in the remaining two games of the Test series with a 10-wicket haul in Adelaide and then a famous spell of 7 for 1 in Perth to help the West Indies retain the Frank Worrell Trophy. Writing about the incident over 20 years later, Jones reflected that, at the time, he was struggling to keep his place in the team after having his thumb broken by Wasim Akram. Furthermore, Damien Martyn had taken Jones&#x27;s spot in the Test side, and Jones was furious after coach Bob Simpson announced the team for the upcoming Test in Adelaide and was again left out. Jones noticed that Ambrose&#x27;s white wristbands were causing difficulties for the batsmen, and thought that by asking him to remove them, &quot;it would create a massive stir within the Windies team and might get Ambrose to bowl a different line and length&quot;.

Jones&#x27;s commentating contract with 10 Sport was terminated after referring to South African player Hashim Amla as a &quot;terrorist&quot; on 7 August 2006. When Amla, who is a Muslim with a full beard, took a catch, Jones was heard to say &quot;the terrorist gets another wicket&quot;. Jones made the comment during a commercial break; however, the comment went to air live in South Africa, as its broadcast had not been interrupted. He apologised for his actions.

In April 2020, Jones rescinded his life membership at Cricket Victoria and removed his name from the best men&#x27;s one-day player award, the Dean Jones Medal. He suggested the administration had given &quot;jobs for the boys&quot; in hiring David Hussey and Michael Klinger as head coaches of the Melbourne Stars and Melbourne Renegades, respectively—jobs he had applied for at the time. The comments were labelled &quot;a good bit of self-promotion&quot; by Cricket Victoria performance boss Shaun Graf. Both his life membership and the one-day player of the year being named in his honour were later reinstated posthumously in December of the same year with “full support” from his family.

== Personal life ==
Jones had a sister and three brothers. He was married to Jane at the time of his death. They had two daughters together; Jones also had a son Koby Hamilton from another relationship.

==Death==
Jones died on 24 September 2020 in Mumbai due to a stroke, aged 59. It was originally reported he had a heart attack. He was a part of the 2020 Indian Premier League commentary team for the Star Network at the time of his death. Jones collapsed in a hotel in Mumbai at around midday IST (UTC+05:30). Fellow former Australian cricketer Brett Lee witnessed the emergency and attempted CPR to resuscitate Jones prior to an ambulance arriving. The Victorian Coroner confirmed that his death was caused by a stroke.

<text>Pamela Cecile Rasmussen (born October 16, 1959) is an American ornithologist and expert on Asian birds. She was formerly a research associate at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and is based at the Michigan State University. She is associated with other major centers of research in the United States and the United Kingdom.

Rasmussen&#x27;s early research investigated South American seabirds and fossil birds from North America. She later specialised in Asian birds describing several new species and clarifying the status of others, particularly white-eyes and owls. More recently, she has been involved in large scale collaborations looking at patterns of global biodiversity, and has assessed the taxonomic status of South Asian vultures.

She was the main author of &quot;Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide&quot;, a landmark publication due to its greater geographical and species coverage compared to its predecessors. As a result of her study of museum bird specimens when researching for the book, she was instrumental in unveiling the extent of the theft from museums and fraudulent documentation perpetrated by eminent British ornithologist Richard Meinertzhagen.

==Early life and career==
Pamela Rasmussen is the daughter of Helen Rasmussen, a Seventh-Day Adventist, whose husband, Chester Murray Rasmussen, a doctor, had left the family when Pamela and her sisters were young. Her interest in birds started when her mother bought her the junior edition of Oliver Austin&#x27;s &quot;Birds of the World,&quot; and Pamela subsequently always chose to receive bird books as presents.

She took her M.S. in 1983 at Walla Walla University, an Adventist-affiliated university in southeast Washington, and her Ph.D. at the University of Kansas in 1990. At Kansas, she studied blue-eyed shags, and was introduced to evolutionary theory, which had not been taught at her alma mater.

Rasmussen is a visiting assistant professor of zoology, and assistant museum curator of mammalogy and ornithology, at Michigan State University (MSU), having formerly been a research associate for the eminent American ornithologist S. Dillon Ripley at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. She is a member of the American Ornithological Society (AOS) North American Classification Committee (NACC), a scientific associate with the bird group of the British Natural History Museum zoology section at Tring, and an associate editor of &quot;The Ibis&quot;, the scientific journal of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union. She is a scientific affiliate for the Field Museum of Natural History and the founder and editor of AVoCet, MSU&#x27;s avian vocalizations center. In 2020 she replaced the ornithologist Frank Gill as an editor of the &quot;IOC World Bird List&quot;, an online list maintained on behalf of the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union.

Rasmussen is married to Michael D. Gottfried, who is Curator of Paleontology, Associate Professor of Geology, and Director of the Center for Integrative Studies in General Science at MSU.

===Research highlights===

====South American seabirds====
Rasmussen&#x27;s early work was largely focused on studies of the systematics, ecology and behaviour of Patagonian seabirds, notably cormorants. She studied plumage variations in juvenile blue-eyed, king and red-legged cormorants, and used plumage and behavioural patterns to establish relationships between king and blue-eyed shags. She also reviewed the fishing activity of olivaceous cormorants.

====Asian birds====

Rasmussen described four new Asian bird species from her study of museum specimens. The Nicobar scops owl &quot;Otus alius,&quot; the Sangihe scops owl &quot;Otus collari&quot;, and the cinnabar hawk owl &quot;Ninox ios&quot;, a Sulawesi endemic,
all in 1998, and the Taiwan bush-warbler &quot;Bradypterus alishanensis&quot; in 2000. She rediscovered the forest owlet &quot;Athene blewitti&quot;, which had not been seen since 1884, in western India, previous searches by S. Dillon Ripley, Salim Ali and others having failed because they relied on fake documentation from Richard Meinertzhagen. In November 1997, Rasmussen and Ben King of the American Museum of Natural History spent ten days unsuccessfully searching two east Indian locations before driving west to the site of another old specimen, where King spotted a small, chunky owl with short, heavily white-feathered legs and huge claws, which Rasmussen confirmed as the target species whilst the owl was videotaped and photographed.

With her colleagues, she clarified the taxonomy of Indonesian white-eyes, establishing the specific status of the Sangihe white-eye &quot;Zosterops nehrkorni&quot; and the Seram white-eye &quot;Z. stalkeri&quot; and confirmed the identity of the Serendib scops owl which had originally been discovered in Sri Lanka by local ornithologist Deepal Warakagoda.
The imperial pheasant is a rare bird found in the forests of Vietnam and Laos. Rasmussen and her co-workers used morphology, hybridisation experiments, and DNA analysis to show that this pheasant, previously thought critically endangered, is actually a naturally occurring hybrid between the Vietnamese pheasant &quot;Lophura hatinhensis&quot; and the subspecies &quot;annamensis&quot; of the silver pheasant &quot;L. nycthemera&quot;.

A 2008 paper saw a return to white-eye taxonomy with the formal description of the Togian white-eye &quot;Zosterops somadikartai&quot;, an endemic species of the Togian Islands of Indonesia, which, unlike most of its relatives, lacks the white ring around the eye which give this group of birds its name. Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not only in its appearance, but also in its lilting song, which sounds higher pitched and is less varied in frequency than the songs of its close relatives.

Pamela Rasmussen&#x27;s interest in Asian birds led to her involvement in more specifically conservation-directed projects. Two &quot;Gyps&quot; vultures, the Indian white-rumped vulture, &quot;Gyps bengalensis&quot;, and the &quot;long-billed vulture&quot; suffered a 99 percent population decrease in South Asia due to poisoning by diclofenac, a veterinary drug that causes kidney failure in birds that have eaten the carcasses of treated cattle. Rasmussen showed that there are two distinct species of long-billed vulture: the Indian vulture &quot;G. indicus&quot; and slender-billed vulture &quot;G. tenuirostris&quot;. This is important to conservation, since a captive-breeding program has been established to assist the recovery of at-risk vulture species.

====Biodiversity====

In 2005, Rasmussen was part of a large multi-institutional collaboration investigating biodiversity hotspots, which have a prominent role in conservation. The study assessed locations quantitatively for three criteria of bird diversity – species richness, the level of threat, and the number of endemic species. The results demonstrated that hotspots did not show the same geographical distribution for each factor. Only 2.5% of hotspot areas are common to all three aspects of diversity, with over 80% of hotspots registering on only one criterion. Each criterion explained less than 24% of the variation in the other factors, suggesting that even within a single taxonomic class, different mechanisms are responsible for the origin and maintenance of various aspects of diversity. Consequently, the different types of hotspots also vary greatly in their utility as conservation tools.

Rasmussen&#x27;s recent work has concentrated on further large-scale collaborations with the same group of institutions studying global patterns in biodiversity. A survey of species richness and geographical range size did not show the decrease in range size from temperate regions to the tropics that had been previously assumed; although that pattern was largely true in the northern hemisphere, it did not appear to apply in the southern hemisphere. Research evaluating the relationship between extinction and human impact showed that, after controlling for species richness, the best predictors of the global pattern of extinction risk are measures of human impact, with ecological factors being of secondary importance. An examination of the distribution of rare and threatened vertebrate species, showed differing patterns for bird, mammal and amphibian species, which has consequences for hotspot-based conservation strategies.

Other studies by Rasmussen and her international colleagues looked at the importance of energy availability, and a 2007 paper showed that global patterns of spatial turnover are driven principally by widespread species rather than restricted ones. This complements other work, and helps to establish a unified model of how terrestrial biodiversity varies both within and between the Earth&#x27;s major land masses.

====Paleo ornithology====
A fossil site at a borrow pit in near Cheswold, Delaware created during highway construction unearthed 11 specimens of fragmentary and unassociated avian fossils, which were identified by Rasmussen as including a small loon, a small gull-like species and five specimens of a gannet-like seabird, probably &quot;Morus loxostylus&quot;, a common species in the Miocene. All of these forms were already known from a site in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. The finds suggests that the Delaware site was the near-shore area of a large bay at the time of deposition.

Rasmussen was also involved in a review of fossil birds from Miocene and Pliocene deposits in North Carolina. Finds included an early Miocene loon &quot;Colymboides minutus&quot;, various ducks, a crested tern closely resembling the modern royal tern &quot;Sterna maxima&quot;, and a member of the crow genus, one of the few fossil passerine birds from that period. The review found that fossil birds from this period generally closely resemble a modern species or genus, and those that do not can usually be placed in a modern family with a fair degree of confidence.

===&quot;Birds of South Asia&quot;===
In 1992, Rasmussen took the position of assistant to S. Dillon Ripley, the former secretary of the Smithsonian, who was planning to produce a definitive guide to the birds of South Asia. When he became ill shortly after beginning the project, Rasmussen took over the project, and with artist John C. Anderton, produced &quot;Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide&quot;, a two-volume bird guide for the Indian subcontinent which was the first field guide for the area to include sonograms. Volume 1 contains the field guide with over 3400 illustrations in 180 plates, and more than 1450 colour maps. Volume 2 (&quot;Attributes and Status&quot;) gives specimen measurements, data about identification, status, distribution and habits. Vocalizations are described from recordings, and there are over 1000 sonograms.

1508 species that have occurred in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, the Chagos archipelago and Afghanistan are covered, including 85 hypothetical and 67 &#x27;possible&#x27; species, which are given only short accounts. Notable aspects of &quot;Birds of South Asia&quot; are its distribution evidence-base – the book&#x27;s authors based their distributional information almost completely on museum specimens – and its taxonomic approach, involving a large number of species-level splits. Its geographical range was also greater than that of older works, notably in the inclusion of Afghanistan.

Many allopatric forms previously regarded as conspecific are treated by Rasmussen and Anderton as full species. Most of these had previously been proposed elsewhere, but the book introduced a number of innovations of its own. Experts on Asian birds, Nigel Collar and John Pilgrim, in 2008 analysed Rasmussen and Anderton&#x27;s proposed changes, indicating which had previously been proposed by other authors, and which were novel, and required further justification.

Although reviews in the birding and ornithological press have often been favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, considered that some of the illustrations are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.

Apart from the Meinertzhagen fraud, which is discussed in the next section, and the death of S. Dillon Ripley, other problems in the production of &quot;Birds of South Asia&quot; included the loss of the main map database during a trip to Burma, and poorly prepared specimen skins. There were also difficulties reconciling sources, delays in producing illustrations and maps, and in obtaining reliable data for &quot;difficult&quot; areas like Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands also presented serious challenges with regard to the status and taxonomy of their avifaunas.

Rasmussen considered in a 2005 paper whether the revised taxonomy of the book, with its many species splits, had significant conservation implications, but felt that the effect on species richness in South Asia was limited, and would have only a moderate conservation impact, increasing the number of potentially threatened species in the region from 6% of the total avifauna to about 7%.

===Meinertzhagen fraud===
Rasmussen revealed the true extent of the major fraud perpetrated by the eminent British officer, ornithologist and expert on bird lice, Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen. Meinertzhagen, who died in 1967, was the author of numerous taxonomic and other works on birds, and possessed a vast collection of bird and bird lice specimens; he was considered one of Britain&#x27;s greatest ornithologists. However, British ornithologist Alan Knox had analysed Meinertzhagen&#x27;s bird collection at the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum in Tring, UK in the early 1990s, and uncovered significant fraud involving theft of specimens from museums and falsification of the accompanying documentation.

When researching for &quot;Birds of South Asia&quot;, Rasmussen examined tens of thousands of bird specimens, since the late S. Dillon Ripley had strongly favoured the use of museum specimens to determine which birds to include. With Robert Prys-Jones of the Natural History Museum, she showed that the decades-old Meinertzhagen fraud was far more extensive than first thought. Many of the 20,000 bird specimens in his collection had been relabelled with regard to where they were collected, and sometimes also remounted. The false documentation delayed the rediscovery of the forest owlet, since previous searches had relied on Meinertzagen&#x27;s faked records. Rasmussen&#x27;s successful expedition ignored these and looked in the areas identified by the remaining genuine specimens.

Meinertzhargen had been banned from the Natural History Museum&#x27;s Bird Room for 18 months for unauthorised removal of specimens, and suspicions that he was stealing specimens and library material were documented by staff for over 30 years, twice reaching the verge of prosecution.

Falsified records identified by Rasmussen and Prys-Jones included high-altitude occurrences of coral-billed scimitar-babbler &quot;Pomatorhinus ferruginosus&quot;, out-of-range Kashmir flycatcher &quot;Ficedula subrubra&quot; and Himalayan winter records of ferruginous flycatcher &quot;Muscicapa ferruginea&quot; and large blue flycatcher &quot;Cyornis magnirostris&quot; (then treated as a subspecies of &quot;C. banyumas&quot;). However, some records such as those for Afghan snowfinch &quot;Montifringilla theresae&quot;, a species Meinertzhagen described, appear to be genuine.

==Exhibitions==

MSUM has regular exhibitions; those featuring Rasmussen&#x27;s projects include &quot;Land of the Feathered Dragons: China and the Origin of Birds&quot; in 2015, “They Passed Like a Cloud: The Passenger Pigeon and Extinction” in 2014, “Echoes of Silent Spring: 50 Years of Environmental Awareness” (for the &quot;Silent Spring&quot; 50th anniversary in 2012), “Avelution: Birds in the Development of Darwin’s Theories of Evolution,” in 2010 and &quot;Birds of South Asia: History vs. Mystery,&quot; in 2003–2004. The last was also shown at the Detroit Zoo Wildlife Interpretive Gallery in 2005–2006.

<text>Ramnaresh Ronnie Sarwan (born 23 June 1980) is a former Guyanese cricketer who played as a batsman. He is a former member and former captain of the West Indies cricket team, in all formats. Sarwan went on to average over 40 in both the test and one day international forms of cricket. He is considered to be one of the best West Indian batters of his generation. Sarwan was a member of the West Indies team that won the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, and was subsequently the player of the tournament.

He was named as captain of the Guyana Amazon Warriors for the 2013 inaugural tournament of the Caribbean Premier League. Sarwan also played for Guyana, Gloucestershire, Kings XI Punjab and Leicestershire in his cricketing career.

== Youth career ==
Sarwan first became fond of cricket at primary school. He later became a member of the Georgetown Cricket Club, where he was mentored by the likes of Carl Hooper, Keith Semple and Roger Harper. Sarwan was a part of the Windies&#x27; squad for the 1998 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. The Caribbean side eventually lost to Bangladesh in the plate final. With a sum of 16 dismissals, he was the highest wicket taker at the tournament, in a tie with Mluleki Nkala of Zimbabwe.

==International career==
===Rise in ranks===
Sarwan made his Test debut against Pakistan at Barbados in May 2000 – a match in which he was unbeaten in both innings including a first innings score of 84 not out. He missed scoring his maiden Test century against South Africa in March 2001 when he was run out for 91. His score of 78 in the second Test against India at Chennai in October 2002 was his fifth innings of 75+ that was not converted into a century. His maiden Test century came in his next Test series against Bangladesh at Dhaka. His next Test century came against Australia at St. John&#x27;s in May 2003. As a part-time right arm leg-break bowler, Sarwan picked up his best test bowling figures, in June 2004, with 4 for 37 against Bangladesh.

In September of that year, the Windies went on to win the final of the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy against England with Sarwan being named as the player of the tournament.

With an investigation being led in 2004 by the International Cricket Council into most of the world&#x27;s international-class bowlers, Sarwan was found to be the only bowler tested who did not transgress the Laws of Cricket regarding the straightening of the arm during delivery.

On 23 May 2006, Sarwan scored 115 not out in his hundredth one day international. This was the third game of a five match odi series played against India at the Warner Park Sporting Complex in Basseterre, St. Kitts.

On 23 June 2006, on his 26th birthday, while playing against India Sarwan hit six fours in an over off Munaf Patel at St. Kitts&#x27; Warner Park Sporting Complex. In so doing he equalled the record of Sandeep Patil with six fours hit off Bob Willis from seven deliveries, Sanath Jayasuriya with six fours hit off James Anderson in six balls and Chris Gayle with six fours hit off Matthew Hoggard from six deliveries.

Sarwan was dropped from the side for the second Test against Pakistan in November 2006. It was the first time in his six-year career that he had missed a game due to poor form. According to captain Brian Lara &quot;It wasn&#x27;t designed as a drop. We just wanted to make him aware of the situation and come back stronger. We need him and we need him to take control.&quot;

===Captaincy===
On 29 April 2007 it was announced that Sarwan was to succeed the retiring Brian Lara as captain of the West Indies following the side&#x27;s exit from the 2007 World Cup.

During the second Test in the West Indies tour of England in May 2007, Sarwan injured his shoulder when he collided with a boundary fence while attempting to prevent a four. This shoulder injury ruled him out of the remainder of the tour and for a further ten months.

===Post captaincy===
Sarwan returned to the West Indies side in 2008 for the home series against Sri Lanka, as vice-captain to Chris Gayle. Throughout the series Sarwan scored over 50 in four consecutive innings, including a match-winning century, at an average of 77.75. He was also named man of the series for his batting feats.

In the subsequent 2008 Test series against Australia, Sarwan continued his fine batting form. With Sarwan scoring a half century and a matching saving 128 in the second Test at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua. At the age 28 years, 228 days he became the youngest West Indian to reach the 5,000 runs milestone when he scored a century in the first Test of the 2009 home series against England at Sabina Park in Jamaica. In scoring his 13th Test match century Sarwan equalled the record for the most centuries in the fourth innings – a record he shared until 2017 with Sunil Gavaskar and Ricky Ponting. He went on to notch his highest test innings score, being 291 in the first innings of the fourth test of the said series played in March 2009 at Barbados&#x27; Kensington Oval. Sarwan&#x27;s knock equalled the highest test innings of Vivian Richards which was also scored against England in 1976 at The Oval in South London.

===Late career===
Sarwan did however lose his central contract due to poor fitness and indifferent form. West Indies coach Ottis Gibson stated that leaving Sarwan out was a tough decision but he will make many contributions to the West Indies in the future and that he needs time to regain his form. Therefore, he wasn&#x27;t selected for the tour of Sri Lanka along with regular wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin.

He played his last international match as an ODI against India at The Oval on 11 June 2013. Sarwan announced his retirement from international cricket in September 2016.

==Domestic career==
In July 2005 Sarwan signed for English county cricket team Gloucestershire. He later joined Indian Premier League outfit Kings XI Punjab for their 2008 season.

Having fallen out of international favour, Sarwan went on to sign for English county side Leicestershire for the 2012 English season. Sarwan had an impressive debut season in averaging 40.91 for the County Championship side. During December 2012 Sarwan was appointed Leicestershire&#x27;s new skipper replacing former captain Matthew Hoggard.

==Controversy==
Sarwan was accused of corruption and match-fixing in 2011, but his charges were dismissed. West Indies cricket official Ernest Hilaire cited irresponsible reporting as the reason rumours spread that batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan was under investigation for match-fixing. In 2020, Chris Gayle called Ramnaresh Sarwan &#x27;worse than global pandemic&#x27;. However, the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) decided to close controversial issue.

==Style of play==
For much of his career, Sarwan wore a bandana under his helmet whilst batting but dropped the practice due to a change in the design of helmet. He shared the habit of his fellow countrymen Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Narsingh Deonarine of marking his guard with a bail.

==Personal life==
Sarwan was born in an Indo-Guyanese family to Kishan and Kumari Sarwan, as the eldest of their three children, in Wakenaam, an island in Guyana&#x27;s Essequibo River. He later married Cindy Parsram as per Hindu rituals in 2013. They have three children together.

A stylish right-handed batsman and useful left-arm seam bowler, he became famous in the 1950s as the first black captain of the West Indies cricket team. Along with Everton Weekes and Clyde Walcott, he formed what was known as &quot;The Three Ws&quot; of the West Indian cricket. He was the first batter to have been involved in two 500-run partnerships and remained the only one until Ravindra Jadeja emulated him in the 2010s.

The Frank Worrell Trophy is awarded to the winner of the frequent Test series between Australia and West Indies

He spent some time studying economics and playing in England. A memorial service was held in his honour in Westminster Abbey, the first such honour for a sportsman.

In 2009, Worrell was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He is widely regarded as the Nelson Mandela of cricket.

==Career==
Frank Worrell was born in Barbados, within a mile of its Test ground. He played first class cricket for Barbados when he first came to prominence. By 1947, his mother had moved to New York City, and his father was away at sea most of the time, and Worrell moved to Jamaica. Thereafter he played cricket for Jamaica.

As a player for West Indies, Worrell made his debut in 1947–48 versus the England team of Gubby Allen. Following this series he settled in England to play for Radcliffe, Lancashire, in the Central Lancashire League and to read economics at Manchester University. He made his highest Test score of 261 against England at Trent Bridge in 1950, and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1951.

Following a successful campaign led by C. L. R. James, who was then the editor of &quot;The Nation&quot; in Trinidad, the period of white Test captaincy in the West Indies came to an end. Worrell became the first black cricketer to captain the West Indies cricket team for an entire series, thus breaking the colour barriers then found in West Indian cricket. He led the side on two particularly notable tours. The first was to Australia in 1960–61. Both Worrell and his opposing captain, Richie Benaud, encouraged their teams to play attacking cricket. The first Test of the series ended in a dramatic tie. Though West Indies lost the series 2–1, with one draw in addition to the tie, they took much credit for contributing to the series. Such was their performance and conduct on Australian soil that they were given a large ticker-tape parade in Australia at the end of their tour.

On 3 February 1962, Nari Contractor, the captain of the touring Indian team, received a career-ending head injury from a bouncer bowled by West Indies fast bowler Charlie Griffith. Worrell was the first player from both sides to donate blood to the injured Contractor, which saved his life.

In 1963, West Indies toured England. They were again popular, and this time they also won the series 3–1, and it was West Indies&#x27; second series victory in England after their 3–1 win in 1950.

Worrell retired after the West Indies–England series. When he left professional cricket, he became Warden of Irvine Hall at the University of the West Indies, and was appointed to the Jamaican Senate by Sir Alexander Bustamante. He strongly supported a closer political union between the nations of the Caribbean. He was knighted for his services to cricket in 1964.

Worrell managed the West Indies during the 1964–65 visit by Australia. He accompanied the team to India in the winter of 1966–67. 

Worrell was the first West Indian to carry his bat in a Test innings. Whilst in India, he was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He died aged 42, a month after returning to Jamaica. A memorial service was held in his honour in Westminster Abbey, the first such honour for a sportsman, the next being for Bobby Moore in 1993.

<doc id="897238" wikidata="Q6857862" url="?curid=897238" title="Military strike">
<text>In the military of the United States, strikes and raids are a group of military operations that, alongside quite a number of others, come under the formal umbrella of military operations other than war (MOOTW). What the definition of a military strike is depends on which particular branch of the military is using them. However, they do have formal, general, definitions in the United States Department of Defense&#x27;s &quot;Joint Publication 1-02&quot;:
::;strike:An attack to damage or destroy an objective or a capability.
::;raid:An operation to temporarily seize an area in order to secure information, confuse an adversary, capture personnel or equipment, or to destroy a capability culminating with a planned withdrawal.

For the United States Air Force, strikes and raids are the least common types of MOOTW, there only having been eight of them in the period from 1947 to 1997, including Operation Just Cause, Operation Urgent Fury, and Operation El Dorado Canyon. For the United States Marine Corps, the latter was also a raid, and Operation Praying Mantis was a strike.

<doc id="897242" wikidata="Q6769421" url="?curid=897242" title="Mark Richardson (cricketer)">
<text>Mark Hunter Richardson (born 11 June 1971) is a former New Zealand cricketer. He was a left-handed opening batsman. He represented New Zealand in 38 Test matches between 2000 and 2004. During his cricketing career he played for Auckland, Buckinghamshire and Otago as well as for Dunedin Metropolitan in the Hawke Cup.

==International career==

Richardson began his career as a left-arm spinner, batting at number 10. As his bowling ability declined, he worked on developing his batting, to the point where he was selected as an opening batsman for New Zealand, at age 29. His dour approach to batting – he described the range of shots he played as &quot;the straight drive, the forward defensive and 27 variations on the leave&quot; – provided vital stability to New Zealand&#x27;s batting order at a time when they were notorious for collapses.

Richardson scored 2776 Test runs at an average of 44.77, including four centuries and 19 fifties. His sole Test wicket came in a match against Pakistan in 2001, dismissing Mohammad Yousuf, then known as Yousuf Youhana, caught and bowled for 203.

His nickname Rigor is short for Rigor Mortis and was given to him in 1996 by Shane Bond because Bond thought he moved with the speed and agility of a dead man. In addition to his slow running, Richardson was also noted for developing (in conjunction with the Beige Brigade) a tradition to challenge the slowest runner of the opposing side to a running race at the conclusion of each tour. In his first race he beat Australia&#x27;s Darren Lehmann. He has since raced Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, South Africa&#x27;s Neil McKenzie and England&#x27;s Ashley Giles, only beating Kaneria. The Beige Brigade also supplied Richardson with a long-sleeved and hooded running suit in the New Zealand teams 1980s beige and brown colours.

On 16 October 2003, Richardson was batting against India in Mohali when he suffered a severe leg cramp after playing a sweep shot, forcing him onto the ground and yelling in agony. The spectacle and its replays amused the crowd and the players during the subsequent break in play.

He retired from all forms of cricket in December 2004, saying he could not sustain the intensity needed to compete at international level. He noted that he finished with &quot;a Test bowling average that is better than Sir Richard Hadlee&#x27;s (22.29), and a 50-50 record in the end-of-series running race.&quot; He scored 9,994 first-class runs during his career, remarked that the tally was &quot;only different from Donald Bradman&#x27;s Test batting average by a decimal point&quot; (Bradman finished his career with an average of 99.94).

==After cricket==
Richardson was a cricket commentator for SKY Sports from 2006 to 2020, and he has been a commentator for Spark Sport and TVNZ since 2020. He co-hosted Prime show &quot;The Crowd Goes Wild&quot; with Andrew Mulligan from February 2006 to December 2016. He hosted &quot;The Block NZ&quot; from 2012 until its axing in 2024, and was the sport presenter on &quot;The AM Show&quot; from February 2017 to December 2021. He was also an afternoon talkback host with Leah Panapa on Today FM from March 2022 to March 2023. Previously, he has been a breakfast radio announcer for The Sound and Radio Sport (with a radio-based show of The Crowd Goes Wild).. He continues to do part-time radio work on Sport Nation in New Zealand and a full-time financial advisor for Forsyth Barr in Auckland. 

Richardson has commented in the media in defense of Donald Trump, saying in July 2018, &quot;people need to give [Trump] a shot&quot;. He has been highly critical of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern&#x27;s decision to have a child in office. He was criticised for saying previously that &quot;being a mum is not a job&quot;.

After the 2018 Budget, Richardson told his tenants live on air that their rent would be going up to compensate him for losses due to the Government&#x27;s budget.

<doc id="897244" wikidata="Q12454494" url="?curid=897244" title="Shaun Pollock">
<text>Shaun Maclean Pollock (born 16 July 1973) is a South African cricket commentator and former cricketer, who was captain in all formats of the game. A bowling all-rounder, Pollock along with Allan Donald formed a bowling partnership for many years. From 2000 to 2003 he was the captain of the South African cricket team, and also played for Africa XI, World XI, Dolphins and Warwickshire. He was chosen as the &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketer of the Year in 2003. Pollock was a member of the South Africa team that won the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy, the only ICC trophy the country has won till date.

On 11 January 2008 he announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket after his 303rd One Day International on 3 February. Pollock now works as a commentator on SuperSport&#x27;s coverage of South African cricket.

In November 2021, he was inducted to the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

==International career==
===Prominence===
He is joint 10th in the all-time best ever bowler ratings in the ICC Ratings, and has taken over 400 wickets and at the time of his retirement was one of only six players to have scored 3000 runs and taken 300 wickets in Test matches.

In June 2007 he represented an Africa XI in an ODI game against an Asia XI in Bangalore. Playing as a specialist batsman, Pollock scored 130 from number 7 in the batting order, the highest ever score by an ODI batsman in that position. The record would however not last long, MS Dhoni bettered it later in the series. In 2007, he received the SA Player&#x27;s Player award and the SA ODI Player of the Year Award.

He was the leading wicket taker for South Africa in Tests until Dale Steyn overtook him on 26 December 2018. He took over 400 test wickets and scored over 3,700 test runs in his 108 Test matches.

===Captaincy===
Shaun Pollock was a bowling all-rounder. After Hansie Cronje was banned from cricket for life, Pollock took over the captaincy in April 2000. He was eventually removed from the captaincy after South Africa&#x27;s performance in the 2003 Cricket World Cup.
Although no longer captain, he retained his place in the team. After a disappointing Test series tour of Australia in 2005/2006, he faced criticism for losing his wicket taking ability. He has the lowest (best) economy rate of any bowler to have taken 300 ODI wickets, and he is also the first South African and only the tenth player to take 400 Test wickets. In September 2007 he was dropped from the South African test side for the first time in his career. Pollock was later readded to the test series against the West Indies, whereupon he announced his retirement, effective on 3 February 2008. He stated that &quot;I realise I have been blessed by God and feel I have nurtured my talents to the best of my abilities.&quot; After South Africa sealed a series victory against the West Indies, Graeme Smith paid tribute to Pollock, stating &quot;It&#x27;s very important that people celebrate what he&#x27;s given to South African cricket and what he&#x27;s achieved as an individual.&quot;

==Domestic career==
Pollock took four wickets in four balls on his first appearance for Warwickshire – in a limited-overs (B&amp;H Cup) game v Leicestershire at Birmingham in 1996.

In Summer 2008 Pollock represented Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League, and Durham Dynamos in the 2008 Twenty20 Cup in England. He played for Durham County Cricket Club in the North East of England and along with fellow South African Albie Morkel was used mainly in the Twenty20 Cup competition.

Of the 18 players who have bowled at least 2,000 balls for South Africa in ODIs, Pollock&#x27;s economy rate of 3.65 runs per over was the second best behind that of Fanie de Villiers.

==Records==
*Shaun Pollock has the record for the most Test centuries while batting at number 9 or below (2).
*He also holds the record for playing the most ODI innings before scoring a century (189).
*Shaun Pollock also holds the record for becoming the first test captain to be stranded or to be remained unbeaten on 99 in a test innings.
*He too holds the record for taking the most ODI wickets when playing at home soil (193).
*Shaun Pollock holds the record for bowling most Maiden overs in ODI history (313).

==Personal life==
Pollock comes from a family of mainly Scottish ancestry. His paternal grandfather, Andrew Pollock, who played for Orange Free State, was born in Edinburgh. He attended Northwood School in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. He is married with two daughters. His wife was a finalist in the Miss South Africa pageant in the early &#x27;90s and worked for a South African telecom company. He is a teetotaler and a devout Christian. Pollock is a graduate of the University of Natal with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in commerce.

<doc id="897246" wikidata="Q1886365" url="?curid=897246" title="Makhaya Ntini">
<text>Makhaya Ntini (born 6 July 1977) is a South African former professional cricketer, who played all forms of the game. He was the first black player to play for the South African national cricket team. Ntini was a member of the South Africa team that won the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy, the only ICC trophy the country has won to date.

He reached second place in the ICC Test match bowling ratings and was the third South African cricketer to take 300 Test cricket wickets, after Shaun Pollock and Allan Donald. In December 2017, his son Thando Ntini was named in South Africa&#x27;s squad for the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. He played his last match against India in 2011.

==Early recognition==
Ntini was born in Mdingi, a village in the Eastern Cape province, which is near King William&#x27;s Town. He was discovered by a Border Cricket Board development officer, who was setting up a mini-cricket programme. Although Ntini was both too old and too big to participate in the programme the officer, Raymond Booi, noticed the bared-footed cowherd&#x27;s enthusiasm and talent for bowling. He lent the 15-year-old Ntini a pair of plimsolls and arranged for him to participate in a net session in King William&#x27;s Town. Ntini impressed Booi, who contacted Greg Hayes, the head of the development programme. The pair placed Ntini in a junior cricket festival in Queenstown and Hayes purchased Ntini his first pair of boots for the festival, but later had to give the young bowler instructions not to wear them indoor or when herding cattle.

Two years later, he was selected to tour England with the South Africa Under-19 squad and played all five of the youth internationals. England dominated both One Day Internationals (ODIs) during the tour, with the South Africans only managing to take one wicket across the two matches, which fell to Pierre Joubert. In the Test series, which England won 2–0, Ntini claimed nine wickets, the second-most by a South African bowler. His bowling was expensive, coming at a rate of 4.53 runs per over: more than any other South African with the exception of Mark Boucher, who is best known as a wicket-keeper.

==Domestic career==

After two matches for Border against the touring Kenyans, Ntini made his First-class cricket debut in November 1995, facing an England XI. He claimed two wickets in England&#x27;s only innings as Border were beaten comprehensively.

In his debut season, Ntini claimed 17 wickets at an average of 37.05 in First-class competitions. His best performance in an innings came against Free State, when he claimed three wickets for 49 runs (3/49) during his 17 overs. He again toured with the national Under-19s in March and April 1996, touring India, where he played three youth Tests and one of the three ODIs. After claiming five wickets in the first Test and none in the second, Ntini displayed his talent in the third match, taking 6/53 in the first innings and 3/48 in the second innings.

==International career==
Ntini returned to the South African side for a Sharjah tournament in 2000. His improvement was clear as he bowled with greater control.

In 2003, he became the first South African to take 10 wickets at Lord&#x27;s. His best performance, however, came when Ntini took 13 wickets for 132 runs against the West Indies in the Port of Spain on 12 April 2005. This remains the most wickets taken by a South African cricketer in a Test match. On 3 March 2006, Ntini also achieved the best bowling figures by a South African in an ODI, demolishing Australia with 6 wickets for 22 runs. A popular figure in South African sport, Ntini was voted their favourite sportsman in a research poll conducted by the South African Press Association. For his performances in 2006 and 2007, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC. He was also named in the World Test XI by ESPNcricinfo.

Ntini went on to establish himself as South Africa&#x27;s premier fast bowler and one of the leading fast bowlers in the world. In February 2009, he was ranked as the world&#x27;s fifth-best Test bowler behind Muttiah Muralitharan, Dale Steyn, Stuart Clark and Mitchell Johnson, but had dropped to being 25th-best ODI bowler, according to the ICC rankings.

On 20 January 2007, Ntini dislodged Mohammad Sami to take his 300th Test wicket in his 74th Test. On 1 August 2008, he removed England opener Alastair Cook to claim his 350th Test wicket in his 90th Test.

Ntini played his 100th Test on 17 December 2009, becoming the only black South African cricketer to reach that mark. Sponsors Castle Lager promised every fan in attendance a free beer in celebration on the day he took his first wicket and he duly obliged on the second day when he bowled Andrew Strauss of England. However, after already having lost his place in the ODI side, he was dropped from the Test side after poor performances against England.

Ntini retired from all forms of international cricket in a T20I against India on 9 January 2011.

To date, Ntini is one of only three players to have played more than 100 Test matches without scoring a 50. Courtney Walsh and Nathan Lyon are the others.

During his career, Ntini took 22 five-wicket hauls. As of 2020, he ranks joint seventeenth among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers (joint with Allan Donald, Malcolm Marshall and Daniel Vettori), and joint second in the equivalent list for South Africa, alongside Donald and behind Dale Steyn.

==Controversies==
Ntini&#x27;s career looked like coming to an early end in 1999 when he was charged and then convicted of rape, although he was finally acquitted.

The case caused controversy in South Africa, with his conviction generating negative publicity in view of his status as the first black South African Test cricketer. Ntini maintained his innocence, was acquitted on appeal and rebuilt his international cricket career. Ntini thanked Cricket South Africa for sticking by him.

On 17 July 2020, while on SABC 2&#x27;s &quot;Morning Live&quot;, Ntini detailed the alleged racism he experienced throughout his career. He claimed other players would not sit with him during meals and said he &quot;was forever lonely&quot; in the Proteas team. Ntini further stated that he used to run to the stadium and back to hotels to avoid being lonely on the team bus. Ntini&#x27;s comments came shortly after fellow South African cricketer Lungi Ngidi called for the national team to show support towards the Black Lives Matter movement.

==Coaching career==
In January 2016, Ntini was appointed as the assistant coach of the Zimbabwean national cricket team with a two-year contract. Following the sacking of the previous coach Dav Whatmore, Ntini was appointed as interim head coach for the home series against India in 2016. He resigned from the role as coach in January 2018, although Ntini was reported to have claimed that he was asked to step down by the board on the basis of alleged complaints from the players over his coaching methods.

<text>Malcolm Denzil Marshall (18 April 1958 – 4 November 1999) was a Barbadian cricketer. Primarily a fast bowler, Marshall is widely regarded as one of the greatest and one of the most accomplished fast bowlers of the modern era in Test cricket. He is often acknowledged as the greatest West Indian fast bowler of all time, and certainly one of the most complete fast bowlers the cricketing world ever saw. His Test bowling average of 20.94 is the second best of anyone who has taken 200 or more wickets. He achieved his bowling success despite being, by the standards of other fast bowlers of his time, a short man – he stood at , while most of the great quicks have been well above and many great West Indian fast bowlers, such as Joel Garner, Curtly Ambrose, and Courtney Walsh, were or above. He generated fearsome pace from his bowling action, with a dangerous bouncer. He also statistically went on to become the most successful Test match bowler of the 1980s with 235 wickets with an average of 18.47 within a time period of just five years. Marshall was a part of the West Indies team that won the 1979 Cricket World Cup as well as the team which reached the 1983 Cricket World Cup Final, but lost to India by 43 runs.

Marshall was also a very dangerous lower middle-order batsman with ten Test fifties and seven first-class centuries. He ended his career as the all-time highest wicket taker for West Indies in Test cricket with 376 wickets, a record which he held up until November 1998 before Courtney Walsh surpassed his milestone.

In 2009, Marshall was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. To mark 150 years of the Cricketers&#x27; Almanack, Wisden named him in an all-time Test World XI.

==Early years==
Marshall was born in Bridgetown, Barbados. His father, Denzil DeCoster Edghill, also a cricketer who played for Kingspark cricket club in St. Philip and the son of Claudine Edghill and Guirdwood Ifill, was a policeman; he died in a traffic accident when Marshall was one year old. His mother was Eleanor Welch. Malcolm had three half-brothers and three half-sisters. He grew up in the parish of Saint Michael, Barbados and was educated at St Giles Boys&#x27; School from 1963 to 1969 and then at Parkinson Comprehensive from 1969 to 1973.

He was partly taught cricket by his grandfather, who helped to bring him up after his father&#x27;s death. He played cricket for the Banks Brewery team from 1976. His first representative match was a 40-over affair for West Indies Young Cricketers against their English equivalents at Pointe-à-Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago in August 1976. He made nought and his eight overs disappeared for 53 runs. He idolised legendary West Indies allrounder Sir Garfield Sobers at his young age and he started admiring Sobers after watching the magnificent test century by Sobers against New Zealand in 1972.

Marshall&#x27;s initial senior appearance was a Geddes Grant/Harrison Line Trophy (List A) match for Barbados on 13 February 1978; again he got out without scoring and did not take a wicket. Four days later, he made his first-class debut against Jamaica, and whilst he failed to score runs, he claimed 6–77 in the Jamaican first innings. On the back of this single first-class appearance he was selected to tour India in 1978/79, many first-choice West Indian stars being unavailable having committed themselves to playing World Series Cricket. Marshall heard of his selection on the radio while working in the storeroom at Banks Brewery and later claimed he did not know where India was.

==International debut==
Marshall made his test début in the second test against India at Bangalore on 15 December 1978. He immediately developed a career-long antipathy to Dilip Vengsarkar due to his aggressive appealing. Despite doing little of note in the three Tests he played on that tour, he did take 37 wickets in all first-class games, and Hampshire saw enough in him to take him on as their overseas player as a successor to Andy Roberts for 1979, remaining with the county until 1993. He was in West Indies&#x27; World Cup squad, but did not play a match in the tournament. Hampshire were not doing well at the time, but nevertheless he took 47 first-class wickets, as well as picking up 5–13 against Glamorgan in the John Player League.

Marshall came to prominence in 1980, when in the third Test at Old Trafford he accounted for Mike Gatting, Brian Rose, and Peter Willey in short order to spark an England collapse, although the match was eventually drawn despite Marshall taking 3–36 (and 2–116 in the second innings). After 1980/81 he was out of the Test side for two years, but an excellent 1982 season with Hampshire when he took 134 wickets at under 16 apiece, including a career-best 8–71 against Worcestershire, saw him recalled and thereafter he remained a fixture until the end of his international career. As of 2022 Marshall&#x27;s performance in 1982 remains the highest haul of first-class wickets by any bowler in an English season for over fifty years, since a reduction in the annual number of County Championship matches in 1969.

In seven successive Test series from 1982/83 to 1985/86 he took 21 or more wickets each time, in the last five of them averaging under 20. His most productive series in this period was the 1983/84 rubber against India, when he claimed 33 wickets as well as averaging 34 with the bat and making his highest Test score of 92 at Kanpur. A few months later he took five in an innings twice at home against Australia. In 1982, he signed a one-year contract with Melbourne Sub-District side Moorabbin and he eventually became the first active international cricketer to sign up for the Sub-District league. Marshall was reportedly approached by the Moorabbin officials during the first test match between Australia and West Indies at Melbourne after learning that Marshall was interested in playing domestic cricket in Australia. At the peak of his career, he turned down an offer of US$1 million to join a rebel West Indies team on a tour to South Africa, still suffering international sporting isolation due to apartheid.

==At the peak==
Marshall relinquished his county duties during the 1984 tour of England. In a Test series that came to be known as the &quot;Blackwash&quot;, the West Indians completed a 5–0 triumph, to date the only visiting team in England to have achieved such a feat. Marshall played a key role, taking the second-most wickets in the series with 24, behind only Joel Garner who took 29, and establishing his reputation as one of the finest bowlers in the world. In the series, he took five or more wickets in an innings three times, had the best bowling average – conceding only 18.20 runs per wicket, and the best strike rate – averaging one wicket every 42 deliveries.

In the first test at Edgbaston, which the West Indies won by an innings and 180 runs, he ended the Test career of local Warwickshire opener Andy Lloyd after half an hour; he had already faced a few short deliveries from both Marshall and Garner but was then caught unawares by a delivery from Marshall that rose sharply and struck him flush on the temple behind his right eye. Lloyd soon had to retire hurt when he realized he was suffering blurred vision in his right eye and was hospitalized for several days. Lloyd would remain stranded on 10 runs without being dismissed and he never went onto play international cricket again leaving him with a unique record of being the only opening batsman in test cricket to have never been dismissed by any bowler.

In the third Test at Headingley, Marshall ran through England&#x27;s batting order in the second innings to finish with 7/53, despite having broken his thumb in two different places when he attempted to field a stroke played by Chris Broad on the first morning in the first innings. He also came out to bat at number 11 in West Indies&#x27; first innings despite his injury, allowing his team to gain a further psychological advantage as Larry Gomes completed an unbeaten century (Marshall batted one-handed that day, with one arm in plaster). Marshall himself also contributed to the team with the bat scoring a boundary with an inside-out forehand down the line. Marshall was dismissed soon after Larry Gomes had completed the century. Even though the partnership lasted for just 16 minutes and with only 12 runs being produced, it turned out to be one of the most memorable test match partnerships for the tenth wicket. His heroics by batting and bowling with a broken thumb also impressed his captain Clive Lloyd who recalled the incident as one of the greatest and most courageous efforts that he ever witnessed during his playing career.

In 1984/85 Marshall had another successful series at home against New Zealand, although there were calls for his bouncers to be ruled as intimidatory beyond what was acceptable, and that Marshall should have been admonished by the umpires. A rising delivery broke the nose of England batsman Mike Gatting in a one-day match in February 1986; Marshall later found bone fragments embedded in the leather of the ball. As well as the bouncer, however, Marshall succeeded in swinging the ball in both directions. He also used an in-swinging yorker as well as developing an effective leg-cutter, and with the exception of the 1986/87 New Zealanders, against whom he could only manage nine wickets at 32.11, no side seemed to have an answer to him.

1988 saw his career-best Test performance of 7–22 at Old Trafford, and he ended the series with 35 wickets in five Tests, at 12.65. Marshall was coming towards the end of his international career, moreover, and though he took 11 wickets in the match against India at Port of Spain the following winter, he played his last Test at The Oval in 1991. His final Test wicket – his 376th – was that of Graham Gooch. These efforts led him to retain the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowling Rankings for the year 1990 (which he attained in 1989).

==Later career==
Marshall&#x27;s final appearances for West Indies came in One Day International cricket – the 1992 World Cup. However, in his five matches in the tournament, he took just two wickets, both in the penultimate game against South Africa at Christchurch. This was the only time Marshall played for West Indies against South Africa in his career, though he played provincial cricket for Natal in both 1992/93 and 1993/94. Whilst playing at Natal, his experience was invaluable, and his guidance was an influential spark in the early career of Shaun Pollock. Today, Shaun Pollock attributes much of his success to his mentor, Marshall.

Having missed out on Hampshire&#x27;s earlier one-day triumphs in the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1988 and the Nat West Trophy in 1991 because of touring commitments with the West Indies, Marshall was in the Hampshire team that won the 1992 Benson and Hedges Cup. He played for Hampshire again in 1993, taking 28 wickets at a shade over 30 runs apiece, but that was to be the end of his time in county cricket. He bade farewell to Hampshire fans in a benefit match at the County Ground, Southampton in September 1993, representing a West Indies XI against the county. As he walked off the pitch after his dismissal, according to a report, &quot;the crowd, as one man, rose to its feet and cheered Marshall every step of the way.&quot; This also proved to be one of the last matches at Southampton for David Gower (whom Marshall dismissed on the day while bowling off-spin). In 1994 his only game in England was against the South Africans for the Scarborough President&#x27;s XI during the Festival. He played five matches for Scotland in the 1995 Benson and Hedges Cup without much success, and his last senior games were for Natal in 1995/96. In his final senior appearance, against Western Province in a limited-overs game at Cape Town, the first of his two victims was his former international teammate Desmond Haynes. He took over 1,000 wickets for Hampshire, and received more than £60,000 (tax free) in his benefit year in 1987.

== Illness, death and legacy ==
In 1996, Marshall became coach both of Hampshire and the West Indies, although the latter&#x27;s steadily declining standards during this period brought a considerable amount of criticism his way. In 1999, during the World Cup it was revealed that Marshall had colon cancer. He immediately left his coaching job to begin treatment, but this was ultimately unsuccessful. He married his long-term partner, Connie Roberta Earle, in Romsey on 25 September 1999, and returned to his home town, where he died on 4 November aged 41, weighing little more than 25 kg.

&quot;The worldwide outpouring of grief,&quot; wrote journalist-friend Pat Symes, &quot;was testimony to the genuine love and admiration he engendered.&quot; At the funeral service at the Garfield Sobers Gymnasium in Wildey, Barbados, former West Indian fast bowler Rev. Wes Hall whispered the last rites in the belief that Marshall, having found God again in the last few weeks of his life, was off to Heaven. His coffin was carried at the service by five West Indian captains. He was buried at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Barbados.

The Malcolm Marshall Memorial Trophy was inaugurated in his memory, to be awarded to the leading wicket-taker in each England v West Indies Test series. Another trophy with the same name was set up to be the prize in an annual game between Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago.

Malcolm Marshall Memorial cricket games are also played in Handsworth Park, Birmingham, England. On the Sunday of the UK&#x27;s August bank holiday, invitation XIs play against an individual&#x27;s &quot;select eleven&quot;.

The entrance road to Hampshire&#x27;s ground the Rose Bowl is called Marshall Drive in memory of Marshall and another West Indian Hampshire great Roy Marshall.

His former Hampshire captain, Mark Nicholas, wrote a moving tribute to him.

<text>Jermaine Jay Charles Lawson (born 13 January 1982) is a former professional cricketer. A fast bowler from Jamaica, he played at Test and One Day International (ODI) level for the West Indies during the early 2000s, becoming the fourth West Indian to take a Test hat-trick. Lawson later moved to the United States, and made his debut for the American national cricket team at the World Cricket League Division Three tournament in October 2014.

==Career==
Born in Spanish Town, Jamaica Lawson attended the St Catherine Cricket Club as a youngster. He eventually became a fast bowler capable of bowling over 95 mph. At the age of 20 he made his debut for the West Indies in an away test match against India, picking up the wickets of both Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar. He went on to claim figures of 6 for 3 against Bangladesh in only his third test match. Lawson later earned a hat-trick, claiming the wickets of Brett Lee, Stuart MacGill and Justin Langer, in an eventual haul of 7/78 during the final Test of Australia&#x27;s 2003/04 tour of the Caribbean.

He was though soon reported, on 11 May 2003, for a suspect bowling action by the International Cricket Council. After undergoing a period of extensive remedial work, he returned to Test cricket in mid-2004, but stress fractures came to the fore along with another report of his action in July 2005. However, he was eventually cleared by the International Cricket Council on that second report of a suspect bowling action.

On 29 February 2008 Lawson joined English side Leicestershire as a Kolpak player for the upcoming county cricket season. During 2014 Lawson migrated to the United States of America and qualified to play for the USA&#x27;s cricket team four years later.

==Personal life==
Lawson is the father of three sons. He currently lives in East New York.

<doc id="897252" wikidata="Q3519918" url="?curid=897252" title="Neil McKenzie">
<text>Neil Douglas McKenzie (born 24 November 1975) is a South African former cricketer, who played all three forms of the game. He was a right-handed opening batsman who played for South Africa, making his first appearance in 2000. He is currently the high performance batting coach of South Africa. He played for the Highveld Lions in South African domestic cricket and has also played county cricket for Somerset, Durham and Hampshire.

He announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in January 2016.

In November 2024, he was appointed as the consultant coach for the Sri Lanka national cricket team for the upcoming 2-match test series against South Africa national cricket team.

==Early and personal life==
Educated at King Edward VII School, McKenzie was a promising junior cricketer, captaining the South African Schools and Under-19 sides. McKenzie is married to South African model Kerry McGregor. His sister, Megan, is also a leading model in South Africa.

==Domestic career==
With better form in international arena, a further development as a result of his recall was that Somerset announced that it was unlikely that McKenzie would return to the club for the 2008 season, having played in 2007 as a Kolpak player. It was subsequently announced that he would play part of the 2008 season for Durham as an overseas player.

In January 2010, McKenzie joined English county side Hampshire as a Kolpak player for the 2010 County Championship. On 5 August 2011 McKenzie hit his career best first-class score of 237 in a County Championship match against Yorkshire. Not only did he make his highest score, but during his innings a number of records fell. Himself and Michael Carberry set a new Hampshire record for the 3rd wicket in first-class cricket, setting a partnership of 523 runs to surpass the previous best partnership for the 3rd wicket, which was set by George Brown and Phil Mead in 1927. The partnership with Carberry was also the highest for any wicket for Hampshire, surpassing the 411 set by Robert Poore and Teddy Wynyard in 1899. Their partnership was the 11th time in first-class cricket that a partnership has passed 500 runs, currently ranks 9th on the all-time list.

==International career==
His Test debut came as an opening batsman in a tour of Sri Lanka but like his father Kevin McKenzie he soon cemented his place in the South African middle order before returning to the side as an opener later in his career. McKenzie made his maiden Test hundred against New Zealand in 2000–01. Another century soon came, against Sri Lanka at Supersport Park but it would be his last for seven years. From there on in he could not convert his twelve 50s into hundreds although he came close when he was run out by Damien Martyn for 99. After a series of low scores was dropped from the side. After showing excellent form in domestic cricket, and due to successive poor performances by opener Herschelle Gibbs, he was recalled to the South African Test squad three and a half years later for the second Test against the West Indies at Newlands. Opening the innings, McKenzie scored 23 before a torn calf muscle meant he was unable to bat in the second innings and would miss the third Test of the series.

During a test against Bangladesh begun on 29 February 2008, McKenzie was involved in a world record 1st wicket partnership of 415 with Graeme Smith, McKenzie registering a career best 226. He continued his form in the next Test against India when he registered scores of 94 and 155 not out.

In the first Test against England at Lord&#x27;s in July 2008, McKenzie batted for over nine hours in a 447-ball innings of 138 to help his side save the match having been asked to follow-on on the third day.

During 2008, McKenzie became one of only twelve players to score more than 1000 test runs in the calendar year. The year, however, ended in disappointing fashion as he was shown to be out of form in series against Bangladesh and Australia. That then led to him being dropped from the test squad, after the second test.

He played his first ODI since 2003 against Australia and made a hard-fought 63 in the first ODI, while also playing his part in a successful 4–1 series win, which made South Africa the number 1 ranked ODI team in the world. With Graeme Smith fit again, McKenzie lost his place in the next ODI squad.

He was however named as one of five cricketers of the year by Wisden, a prestigious award, dating back more than 125 years, for his form in the away series in England.

<doc id="897261" wikidata="Q2723803" url="?curid=897261" title="Gary Kirsten">
<text>Gary Kirsten (born 23 November 1967) is a South African cricket coach and former cricketer who was a member of the South Africa team that won the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy, the only ICC trophy the country has won till date.

Kirsten played 101 Test matches and 185 One Day Internationals for South Africa between 1993 and 2004, mainly as an opening batsman. His half brother Peter also played provincial cricket for Western Province, and then later for the South Africa cricket team which included the highlight of the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

Kirsten was the coach of the Indian cricket team from 2008 to 2011, going on to win the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He was appointed as the coach of the South African cricket team in June 2011, and he stepped down in August 2013. For a brief period in 2024, he also coached the Pakistan national cricket team.

==Playing career==

Kirsten made his Test debut against Australia in Melbourne in 1993. He retired from international cricket in 2004 after crafting a match-winning 76 in his final innings, against New Zealand. Against the same country, he had made history by becoming the first-ever Protea to play in 100 Test matches.

Over the years, Kirsten gained a reputation as being a sturdy batsman in both Test cricket and One Day cricket. He could up the tempo of an innings if he needed to, but more often than not he simply waited for the bad ball in test cricket. He was also a reliable fielder. Kirsten held the South African records for most runs and centuries in a Test career, before both were surpassed by Jacques Kallis. He was the first Test batsman to make hundreds against each of the other 9 Test nations. He scored 275 runs against England as a result of batting for over hours as South Africa followed on at Kingsmead in Durban, it still stands as the second-longest innings (in terms of duration) in Test history.

The high score was later surpassed by Graeme Smith when he made 277 against England in 2003. He still holds the record for highest innings by a South African in a One Day International; 188 not-out made against the United Arab Emirates during the 1996 World Cup, which is the tenth highest innings of all time in One Day International cricket, and the third-highest score in World Cup cricket history. This record stood until it was surpassed by Chris Gayle who scored 215 against Zimbabwe in 2015. Later, that record was surpassed by Martin Guptill who scored 237* against the West Indies in the quarter-finals of that very World Cup.

==Coaching career==
===India (2008–2011)===
After retirement, Kirsten organised his own cricket academy. In November 2007, it emerged that Kirsten was a candidate for the vacant post of coach of the India team. The BCCI offered him a two-year contract for the post, and despite voicing reservations about concerns he had about having the full support of the Indian players, he confirmed he would be taking the job on 4 December.

Kirsten officially started as a coach on 1 March 2008. However, he travelled to Australia with India beforehand during the test series. His first full series in charge was against his home country, South Africa in March–April 2008 which was drawn 1–1. Also, he coached India to the finals of the Kitply Cup and 2008 Asia Cup (India lost both the finals). During his tenure as Coach of India, the Indian cricket team won a home series against Australia beating them 2–0. Apart from clinching the Border–Gavaskar Trophy, he also coached India to its first bilateral series win in Sri Lanka against Sri Lanka and India&#x27;s first Test and One-Day International series victories against New Zealand in New Zealand after 40 years. India also won the Compaq Cup, defeating Sri Lanka in the finals on 14 September 2009 by 46 runs. A highly accomplished batsman himself, he brought in a considerable amount of improvement in the batting performances, which was largely associated with his ability to instill better confidence among younger players.

Kirsten was praised by all players for improving/enhancing their playing techniques, motivating them and discussing tactics that can be deployed on the field. The results could be clearly seen within months. He was considered the key force behind the clearly visible performance improvement in all players. In 2010, prior to the start of India&#x27;s tour of South Africa, Indian captain M.S. Dhoni described him as &quot;The best thing to happen to Indian cricket.&quot;

In 2017, Kirsten spoke to HBR about the qualities of a great coach, coaching a young team, and learning from one&#x27;s mistakes. Some edited excerpts of his interview are online.

==== World Cup 2011 ====
After the tour of South Africa, which India drew 1–1 in the Test series and lost 3–2 in ODIs, the BCCI announced that Kirsten would not renew his contract because of family commitments. Kirsten had often stated that he wanted to spend time with his two growing sons, Joshua and James, and his wife. He had also stated that he felt three years away from home was long enough. Immediately after the announcement Kirsten was linked with joining South Africa as their coach as the South Africa coach Corrie van Zyl had also announced that his contract would end after the World Cup.

Kirsten ended his tenure as coach after India won the 2011 Cricket World Cup defeating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets and 10 balls to spare on 2 April 2011 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, India. During the celebration, he was carried around the ground by Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan and Virat Kohli to show their respect.

===South Africa (2011–2013)===
On 5 June 2011, Kirsten was appointed the full-time coach of the South Africa national cricket team for a term period of two years. His first decision was to name AB de Villiers as the new captain for the limited-overs game, replacing Graeme Smith who remained the Test side captain. Kirsten began his term as a coach on 1 August and his first assignment was a home series against Australia. He took over from Corrie van Zyl, who was an interim coach for 14 months after Mickey Arthur resigned following the home series against England in 2009–10. Under Kirsten, in August 2012, the South African team reached number 1 in the ICC Test rankings, by defeating England 2–0.

Kirsten did not renew his contract with Cricket South Africa (CSA) and stepped down as the coach of the national team in August 2013 citing family commitments.

=== Hobart Hurricanes (2017–2018) ===
On 3 April 2017, Kirsten was appointed head coach of the men&#x27;s Hobart Hurricanes cricket team. The Hobart Hurricanes are Tasmania&#x27;s professional T20 cricket club in the Australian Big Bash League.

=== Royal Challengers Bangalore (2018–2019) ===
In January 2018, Royal Challengers Bangalore appointed Kirsten as their batting coach. In August 2018, he was appointed as head coach of RCB following the sacking of their previous coach Daniel Vettori for the 2019 Indian Premier League .

=== Gujarat Titans (2022–2024) ===
In January 2022, Kirsten was appointed batting coach and mentor of newly formed Gujarat Titans.

Following the dismissal of Chris Silverwood due to the England Cricket Team&#x27;s 4–0 defeat in the 2021-22 Ashes series, Kirsten emerged as a favourite for the role of Men&#x27;s Test Head Coach having previously been linked with the England Cricket Team prior to Silverwood&#x27;s appointment in 2019. The role was instead given to Brendon McCullum.

===Pakistan (2024)===
In April 2024, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced Kristen as the head coach of Pakistan national cricket team in the limited overs cricket for a two-year period. In October 2024, he resigned from his position over differences with the PCB on the merit selection of squads.

==Business interests==
In 2007, Kirsten joined Paddy Upton and Dale Williams to form a company called Performance Zone. The focus of the company is to work with individuals and teams in business and sport, bringing out their clients&#x27; best performance. When Kirsten was appointed Indian coach and Upton as Indian mental conditioning coach on a two-year contract, they decided to continue the business. Its first project post Kirsten taking on the Indian coach role has been the creation of garykirsten.com.

<text>Simon Philip Jones (born 25 December 1978) is a Welsh former cricketer, who played internationally for the England cricket team. Jones played in eighteen Test matches for England, before injury ended his international career. He played county cricket for Glamorgan, Worcestershire and Hampshire, before retiring in 2013. His father, Jeff Jones, played cricket for Glamorgan and England in the 1960s.

==Early career==
A tall () right-arm fast bowler and left-handed tail-end batsman, Jones, whose father, Jeffrey, had played for England and Glamorgan, made his county cricket debut for Glamorgan against Derbyshire at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff, on 22 August 1998.

Jones made his Test match debut at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground against India on 25 July 2002, at the age of 23. After making an impressive 44 from 43 deliveries with the bat, Jones ended the Indian first innings with figures of 2–61 off 21 overs, dismissing Ajay Ratra and Ajit Agarkar. In England&#x27;s second innings, Jones did not bat, as England declared for 301–6, setting India a target of 568 to win. As India chased, Jones took 2–68, bowling Virender Sehwag, and having VVS Laxman caught by Michael Vaughan for 74, with England winning the match by 170 runs. Jones was left out of the subsequent three Tests, with the four-match series ending in a 1–1 draw.

After impressing in that one Test, Jones was then selected for the 2002/2003 Ashes tour. However, on the first morning of the first Test at Brisbane Cricket Ground, having bowled seven overs and taken the wicket of Justin Langer, he suffered a severe injury, rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament while sliding to field a ball. After a lengthy recovery period, he was fit in time to tour the Caribbean.

==West Indies Tour==

In March, 2004, England embarked on a tour of the Caribbean, and Jones was included in the squad. In the first Test against the West Indies, at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica, Jones had match figures of 3–72, dismissing Brian Lara, Ridley Jacobs, and Ryan Hinds, as England won the Test match by 10 wickets. In the second Test, Jones took the wicket of Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the first innings, before taking 5–57 in the second, dismissing the first four batsmen – (Chris Gayle, Devon Smith, Ramnaresh Sarwan, and Ridley Jacobs), as well as Pedro Collins. It was Jones&#x27; first five-for in Test cricket, and England won the match by seven wickets. In the third Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, Jones took just one wicket, in the first innings – that of Collins, once again – and did not bowl in the second innings, as England won the match by eight wickets, and led the series by 3–0. The final Test of the series was equally uneventful for Jones, personally, as he took just one wicket, in a first innings in which Brian Lara scored a world record 400 not out. England won the four-match series 3–0.

==Lead up to The Ashes==

In May 2004, New Zealand toured England. Jones played in the first Test at Lord&#x27;s, and took match figures of 4–146. England won the match by seven wickets, but Jones did not play again for England until the West Indies returned to tour.

On the West Indies&#x27; return to England in July 2004, Jones played just one match, again at Lord&#x27;s, taking one wicket, before finding himself out of the Test lineup, but England went on to win the four-match home series 4–0.

In December of that year, Jones was included in the England squad to tour Zimbabwe and South Africa. Jones won his One Day International debut in the third ODI against Zimbabwe on 4 December 2004. Jones took 2–43 at an economy of 5.375, as England won the match by seven wickets. Jones then played in the final ODI, this time taking 1–33 at 4.12, with England again winning, this time by 74 runs, and completing the 4–0 series whitewash.

Jones then played in the first Test match in Johannesburg, dismissing Boeta Dippenaar in the first innings, before taking 4–39 in the second, including the wicket of Jacques Kallis for 61. England won the match by seven wickets, with Jones scoring 24 in the first innings. In the second Test at Kingsmead in Durban, Jones scored 21 in England&#x27;s first innings, and took 2–117 in the match. The match was drawn, and England and Jones moved on to the third Test at Newlands. Here, Jones took 3–84 in the match, but found himself left out of the fourth Test, replaced by James Anderson. England won the fourth Test, but Jones was once again restored to the Test team for the final match of the series at the SuperSport Park in Centurion, Gauteng. Jones impressed with four wickets in the first innings, conceding just 47 runs, but took just one in the second, as England drew the match but won the series 2–1.

Jones then played both matches in the home Test series against Bangladesh, as England&#x27;s four-man pace attack of Hoggard, Harmison, Flintoff, and Jones, prepared for the 2005 Ashes series. The pace attack tore through Bangladesh in the first innings of the first Test, dismissing them for 108, with Jones grabbing the wicket of Javed Omar, and conceding just four runs in six overs. In the second innings, the England seamers once again dismissed the Bangladeshis for a low score, this time just 159, with Jones picking up figures of 3–29 off 11 overs, while Flintoff, Hoggard, and Harmison, taking three, two, and two, wickets, respectively, with England winning the match by an innings and 261 runs. The second Test took a similar course, as the England pacers took 19 of the 20 Bangladeshi wickets, with Jones taking 1–75 in the match, and England winning by an innings and 27 runs.

==2005 Ashes series==

Jones played in two ODI matches of the NatWest Series in June – July, 2005. Jones took 2–53 in the abandoned 8th match at Edgbaston, before taking 1–45 in the final of the tournament, which ended in a tie.

Then, in the ODI series against Australia, in the lead-up to the Ashes, Jones played in two of the three matches of the series, but failed to take a single wicket.

In the first Test of the Ashes series at Lord&#x27;s, Jones took 2–48 in the first innings, in which Australia were restricted to just 190. Jones also managed 20 not out off 21 deliveries, helping England to a meagre 155 in response to Australia&#x27;s total. In the second innings, Australia managed 384 all out, setting England a target of 420 to win the match. Jones took 1–69 from his 18 overs. England could only manage 180 in reply, and Australia won the first match by 239.

In the second Test at Edgbaston, Jones played a significant role, scoring 19 not out from 24 deliveries, helping England to a first innings total of 407 all out. Jones then produced a controlled swing performance to dismiss Justin Langer and Brett Lee, capturing figures of 2–69, as Australia were bowled out for 308, 99 runs behind England. Jones was once again undismissed in the second innings, this time for 12, as England set Australia 282 runs to win. Jones dismissed Matthew Hayden for 31 as Australia lost by two runs despite brave efforts from Lee and Warne, and Jones finished with figures of 1–23 in the second innings.

The third Test at Old Trafford Cricket Ground was remarkably successful for Jones, as he picked up the wickets of Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne, Michael Clarke, Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee, as he collected figures of 6–53, his best bowling innings, before adding the wicket of Michael Clarke, in which Jones bowled a reverse-swinging delivery which Clarke left, expecting the ball to swing away, before it moved back towards the batsman and uprooted his off-stump. This took his match figures to 7–110, his personal best. The match finished in a remarkable draw, as the Australians finished the fifth day just 52 runs behind, and with one wicket remaining.

During the fourth Test at Trent Bridge, Jones, in the first innings, took a devastating 5–44, trapping captain Ponting as one of his dismissals. However, he then succumbed to an ankle injury during the second innings, which meant he only bowled four overs for no wickets. This injury would force him out of the crucial deciding match at The Oval, as well as out of England&#x27;s winter tour to Pakistan. Jones finished the Ashes series with 18 wickets at an average of 21.00, and England went on to win the series 2–1, reclaiming the Ashes for the first time since 1986–87. The fourth Ashes test also became his final international test match.

==Second major injury==

On 26 February 2006, Jones sustained a twisting injury to his left ankle while bowling in the nets in preparation for the first Test of England&#x27;s tour to India, which was to commence three days later. On 27 February, Jones was sent home to see a specialist, and played no further part in the Test series.

Having spent the rest of the winter recovering, Jones played his first match since the 4th Ashes Test on 19 April 2006. Playing for Glamorgan, he took one wicket for 23 runs in a match against Cardiff UCCE, and stated he was pleased with his recovery. However, on 1 May, he broke down with a new injury to his left knee in a victory against Ireland in the C&amp;G Trophy. The injury kept him out of the Test and O.D.I. series against Sri Lanka, which was due to start the next week.

In June 2006, he flew to Colorado for surgery on his knee by surgeon Richard Steadman, with the England team stating that he would not be expected to bowl for five months, and was unlikely to participate in the 2006/07 tour of Australia. In the 2006 New Year Honours, Jones was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to cricket, following his role in the successful Ashes tournament, and in April he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.

In September 2006, despite continuing injury problems which prevented him from returning to professional cricket until the start of the 2007 domestic season, his Central Contract with the ECB was renewed for another 12 months. Jones returned to action for his county, Glamorgan, in April 2007.

==Moves to Worcestershire and Hampshire==
As his contract with Glamorgan was due to expire at the end of the 2007 season, Jones was linked with a move away from Glamorgan.
After speculation linking him to Hampshire, on 19 October Jones moved to Division Two side Worcestershire, on a two-year contract. Yet another injury (this time to the neck) confined Jones to just three overs in the first game of the 2008 season. He returned to action for Worcestershire in a one-day game against Hampshire on 11 May 2008, recording career best figures of 5 for 32 from 10 overs and bowling well over 90 mph. This led to speculation that he may yet return to the England team once more.

Shortly after the surprise international call-up for Darren Pattinson, chosen ahead of Jones, Jones suffered another knee injury requiring yet more surgery.
&quot;The surgeon was happy,&quot; Jones said. &quot;He said, &#x27;You can never be 100% [but] I&#x27;m 80 to 90% sure you&#x27;ll be fine – you are always going to have 10 or 20% [chance that you won&#x27;t play again]&#x27;.&quot;

Jones, though, is happy with those odds. He has beaten worse predictions before after being given a 70% chance of recovering from his horrific cruciate ligament injury at Brisbane in 2002. &quot;I&#x27;ll always back myself,&quot; he said. &quot;I know if I can bowl at the top of my game I can get in that side.&quot;
With no hope of playing cricket in the remaining 2009 season, and with it being the final year of his contract, on 19 July Worcestershire released Jones. Towards the end of the 2009 domestic season, Jones opened talks with Glamorgan and Hampshire County Cricket Club.

Jones eventually opted to sign for Hampshire, and joined the club on 30 September 2009, with a view to regaining his fitness in time for the 2010 County Championship. Jones played a number of limited-over matches for Hampshire that season, and eventually made his first-class debut at the end of the season, in a match versus Warwickshire, taking 4–60 in the only innings in which he bowled.

In January 2011, Jones played for Hampshire in the 2011 Caribbean Twenty20, a tournament which Hampshire were invited to take part in. He played all of Hampshire&#x27;s fixtures in the tournament, including the final against Trinidad and Tobago, which Hampshire lost. Jones was the competition&#x27;s joint leading wicket-taker, along with teammate Hamza Riazuddin, with 12.

==Return to Glamorgan==
Jones returned to Glamorgan on a month&#x27;s loan on 17 June 2011, Hampshire reiterating that he was still part of their plans for the coming year. However, on 19 October 2011, Glamorgan Cricket Club announced he had signed a two-year deal to return to the Welsh county where he started his career. In his first season, he was used almost exclusively in the CB40 and Twenty20 competitions.

On 13 September 2013, Jones announced his retirement from first-class and List A cricket after the YB40 final.

==Career best performances==
&quot;Updated 18 October 2011&quot;
==Personal life==
Jones lives in Cardiff.

In February 2006, Jones was placed ninth and the highest-placed sportsman in a poll of the world&#x27;s sexiest men, voted for by readers of &quot;New Woman&quot; magazine.

In July 2015, his memoirs, &quot;The Test: My Life, and the Inside Story of the Greatest Ashes Series&quot;, were published by Random House.

Since retiring, Jones works as a school cricket coach and runs summer cricket camps.

<doc id="897264" wikidata="Q3078484" url="?curid=897264" title="Geraint Jones">
<text>Geraint Owen Jones (born 14 July 1976) is a former cricketer who played for both England and Papua New Guinea. Born to Welsh parents in Papua New Guinea, Jones was the first-choice wicketkeeper for the England cricket team between 2004 and 2006. He later played international cricket for Papua New Guinea from 2012 to 2014. He announced his retirement from first-class cricket in July 2015 following his resignation as the first-class cricket captain of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club.

==Personal life==
Jones was born in Kundiawa, Papua New Guinea, and moved to Australia with his parents, who were originally from Wales, soon after he was born. He grew up in Toowoomba where he played in the under 21 team in the annual Spring Street Church cricket match. He went on to play in Brisbane, Queensland, played for the Queensland Colts (Under-21) team, and was awarded the wicketkeeper&#x27;s trophy for most dismissals in the Brisbane Grade Cricket competition in 1995/96 when he was 19/20. His first club in England was Lydney CC in the Forest of Dean but he returned to live in Australia until he was 22. Upon his return to Britain he played for Clevedon CC. The following season he joined Abergavenny CC and was later appointed captain. Whilst at Abergavenny he trained as a pharmacist. He met his wife whilst playing for Clevedon; the couple has two sons.

After retiring, Jones joined Brentwood School as their cricket professional in November 2015. He also worked as a business studies teacher. In 2019 he trained to become a retained firefighter with Kent Fire and Rescue Service.

==Career==
===Domestic career===
Jones spent most of his career playing for Kent County Cricket Club. He made his debut for Kent in 2001 after having played Second XI cricket for the side the previous season. He was capped by the side in 2003 and played in more than 380 top-class matches for Kent, making his final appearance for the side in 2013. After losing his place in the Kent side to Sam Billings at the start of the 2014 season, Jones joined Gloucestershire on loan. He was released by Kent at the end of the season, and signed a two-year deal with Gloucestershire in October 2014, but retired after only a year with the club.

===England career===

Jones replaced Chris Read as England wicket-keeper during the 2004 tour of the West Indies. Later that year, playing against New Zealand, he scored his only Test match century. He toured South Africa in 2004/05

In 2005 he took the final catch of the 2005 Ashes Test at Edgbaston, ensuring an England victory by two runs. In the 2006 New Year Honours, Jones was awarded the MBE for playing in the successful Ashes series.

A succession of dropped catches and missed stumpings during his England career had caused many commentators to question whether his value to the team as a batsman was sufficient for him to hold his place against competition from more accomplished wicket-keepers such as Read and James Foster. Until mid-2006 the England selectors maintained faith in Jones believing that he offset his mistakes with several well-timed performances with the bat. His batting form tailed off and, after suffering a broken finger, he was replaced by Chris Read for the third Test against Pakistan in 2006.

Jones was not awarded a 12-month central contract for 2007, although neither was Read and both players were selected for the 2006-07 Ashes series. Jones played the first three matches of the series but was dropped after poor performances and never regained his England place.

===Papua New Guinea career===
Jones played for Papua New Guinea in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifiers in the United Arab Emirates. His best score was 46 off 33 balls in PNG&#x27;s victory over Denmark. Papua New Guinea finished eighth out of 16.

He played again for PNG in the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, where he was a standout in the middle order for the side and provided much needed stability to the lineup, scoring 216 runs, with an average of 27 and a high score of 55. In early January 2014 he played in the 2014 WCQ held in NZ, top-scoring with 88 runs against Hong Kong, his highest score for PNG. PNG finished fourth in the tournament and were awarded One Day International and T20 International status by the International Cricket Council. Jones played in two ODI&#x27;s for the side, both against Hong Kong in Townsville, Australia.

<doc id="897268" wikidata="Q3345527" url="?curid=897268" title="Khaled Mashud">
<text>Khaled Mashud, popularly known as Khaled Mashud Pilot (; born 8 February 1976) is a former Bangladeshi cricketer and a captain in Tests and ODIs. A wicketkeeper and middle order batsman, he was a regular member of the national team between 1995 and 2007. Bangladeshi coach Dav Whatmore claimed Mashud as the &quot;best wicketkeeper in Asia.&quot; He contributed to Bangladesh&#x27;s first ever ODI hat-trick by taking two catches off Shahadat Hossain&#x27;s bowling. After his international retirement in 2008, he continued to play domestic cricket in Bangladesh as captain of the Rajshahi Division team. Mashud announced his retirement from domestic cricket after captaining his team to win the title in 2011.

==Personal life==
His father Shamsu was a prominent Bangladeshi footballer in the 1970s. A striker, he formed a partnership with Kazi Salahuddin and helped Abahani Krira Chakra win the Dhaka First Division League title in 1977.

Khaled Mashud has been selected as the new Bangladesh team manager for the upcoming away series against New Zealand.

==Early days==
Mashud played for the Bangladesh U-19 side in 1993. Apart from his keeping duties, he also took the important responsibility of batting at No. 3. Within couple of years, he graduated to the national team and played against the touring England &#x27;A&#x27; team in February 1995. His ODI debut came later in the year at Sharjah.

==International career==
===In Test cricket===
He made an impressive Test debut with the bat, scoring 32 and 21* runs in the historic match against India in November 2000. But his most memorable moment in Test cricket came in the West Indies in May 2004. Despite taking a first innings lead of 64 runs, Bangladesh ran into trouble, losing their first seven wickets for just 123 runs. Mashud then led a late order recovery to take the score to 271/9 (decl.). The declaration came just after Mashud completed his hundred (103*). He was given excellent support by Rafiq (29) and Tapash (26).
Behind the stumps, his 87 dismissals from 44 matches does not sound very impressive, but he was playing for a side which possessed very little venom in their bowling department.

===One Day Internationals===
Mashud was a vital member of the triumphant Bangladesh team in the 1997 ICC trophy. There, he topped the batting averages for his country, scoring 92 runs and getting out only once. He was the Man of the Match against Scotland after scoring 70 runs and sharing a 115 run partnership with Aminul Islam. In the final, he scored a quickfire 15* from just 7 deliveries to take Bangladesh home to a last ball victory. His innings included two massive hits for six. He also enjoyed a highly successful time behind the stumps with 12 catches and 11 stumpings.

Mashud had little chance to show his mettle as a one-day batsman, as he almost inevitably came to bat with his team struggling. Still, he managed to get a top score of 71* runs, against the Australians in 2005. With the Bangladesh spinners being more effective in limited-over games, Mashud had more chance to show his class. His 91 catches and 35 stumpings in ODI testify to that.

Mashud had a brief stint as captain of Bangladesh. But, he lost his captaincy in acrimonious circumstances following the 2003 World Cup in Africa. Bangladesh suffered defeats at the hands of Canada and Kenya amidst allegations of match fixing. Although the allegations were not proved Mashud was stripped of his captaincy duty. In February 2006, he was fined after being found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute during a match against Sri Lanka.

His place in the side came under threat, however, with the emergence of Mushfiqur Rahim, combined with his own failure to score a half century in 24 Test innings. He was subsequently dropped from the Bangladesh squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup and after a brief return against Sri Lanka did not feature, with Rahim and Dhiman Ghosh being preferred as wicketkeepers. He announced his retirement from international cricket in 2008.

<text>Alok Kapali (; born 1 January 1984) is a Bangladeshi cricketer. He is an allrounder who bats in the middle to lower order and bowls leg spin. He was the first Bangladeshi cricketer to take a Test hat-trick.

==Early life and background==
Kapali was born into a Bengali Hindu family in Sylhet, Bangladesh. He is the youngest of six brothers and four sisters in his family. His father worked at a Hindu temple in his hometown, Sylhet.

==International career==

===Test career===

Kapali made his Test debut in 2002, against Sri Lanka at Colombo. He took 2 wickets, Michael Vandort and Upul Chandana as well as scoring 39 runs and 23 runs with batting. In his next 16 Tests he took just 4 more wickets and this included a hat-trick against Pakistan in 2003. This was spread over two overs and when he trapped Umar Gul in a LBW with the first ball of his 3rd over, Kapali became the first Bangladeshi bowler to achieve the milestone in Test cricket, and the youngest of all time, at the age of 19 years and 240 days. He finished with figures of three runs for three wickets (3/3). His effort in quickly cleaning up the tail order also allowed Bangladesh their maiden first innings lead in Tests. He is currently the player with the lowest amount of wickets in total, with 6, for those who have bowled a Test hat-trick.

With the bat, Kapali has struggled thus far in Test cricket and made his highest score of 85 runs against the West Indies at Chittagong.

Kapali has the unfortunate distinction of playing for the losing side in all 17 of his Test matches for Bangladesh.

===One Day Internationals===
In One Day International cricket he has been in and out of the side, impressing more with the bat than the ball. He hit the fastest century by a Bangladeshi batsmen (86 deliveries) in a match against India during the 2008 Asia cup., a record broken by Shakib Al Hasan two years later. He also holds the Bangladeshi record of 7th wicket partnership of 89 runs with Khaled Mashud, made against Kenya in 2006.One Day International Cricket - Partnership Records (Countries &amp; Grounds)

==Domestic career==
Kapali scored 3 hundreds for Sylhet in the Bangladeshi National Cricket League of 2006–07, finishing with 744 runs.

He was the leading run-scorer in the 2016–17 National Cricket League tournament, with 598 runs, including a career-best of 200 not out in the final match of the competition.

In January 2018, he scored his 20th century in first-class cricket, batting for the East Zone against Central Zone, in the 2017–18 Bangladesh Cricket League.

==ICL career==
In 2008, Kapali was banned for 10 years for playing international cricket because he joined the unsanctioned Indian Cricket League and played for the Dhaka Warriors in the Indian Cricket League. He scored the first century in the two seasons of ICL, 100 runs in 60 balls, against Hyderabad Heroes. He finished as the second highest scorer of the league stage with 324 runs in 8 matches at an average of 54 runs. However Kapali announced he quit the ICL in June 2009 and was available for national selection by the 31st December 2009.

==BPL career==
The Bangladesh Cricket Board founded the six-team Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a twenty20 tournament to be held in February that year. The BCB made Alok Kapali the &#x27;icon player&#x27; for Sylhet Royals. He scored 124 runs from 9 matches.

Later he also played for several BPL teams, while his innings during final match of 2015–16 Bangladesh Premier League on behalf of Comilla Victorians was extraordinary.

In October 2018, he was named in the squad for the Sylhet Sixers team, following the draft for the 2018–19 Bangladesh Premier League. In November 2019, he was selected to play for the Rajshahi Royals in the 2019–20 Bangladesh Premier League.

<text>Mohammad Sanwar Hossain (; born 5 August 1973) is a former Bangladeshi cricketer, who was part of the Bangladesh squad for the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

==History==
The middle-order batter made his international debut in 1998 against India in an ODI game at Dhaka. He notched up his maiden ODI fifty in 2001 against Zimbabwe. Despite continuous low scores, he was selected for the 2003 ODI World Cup held in South Africa, where he scored just 63 runs in six innings. In a group stage match against Sri Lanka, Charminda Vaas took 4 wickets in an over, with Hossain being the fourth batsman to fall. Hossain scored one half-century in international cricket, against Zimbabwe in 2001.

In July 2003, Hossain was called for throwing in a Test match in Australia, the delivery in question being a delivery in which he &quot;flicks the ball with a backhanded motion&quot;. Nevertheless, he was allowed to play in the subsequent One Day International series as it fell within the six weeks in which his bowling action was being reviewed.

In 2004, Hossain began working at Biman Bangladesh Airlines, but in November, he was recalled to the Bangladesh squad for their series against India after getting time off work from the airline to allow him to play.

Hossain retired from first-class cricket in 2005, but in 2015 made an appearance for Mushtaque XI against Jewel XI in a Victory Day Exhibition T20 match.

In 2012, Hossain was invited to present trophies at the Kuwait Cricket T20 Premier League Division-2 cricket tournament, and was also responsible for helping to create the 4H Group Cricket Tournament for academies, along with former Bangladeshi cricketers Habibul Bashar, Javed Omar, and Hasanuzzaman.

Hossain has been a coach of, and also managed, the Dhaka Gladiators in the Bangladesh Premier League; in 2013, Hossain was accused of match-fixing during the 2013 Bangladesh Premier League. Gladiators&#x27; bowling coach Mohammad Rafique admitted there was match-fixing, and blamed Hossain.

<doc id="897276" wikidata="Q6767806" url="?curid=897276" title="Mark Greatbatch">
<text>Mark John Greatbatch (born 11 December 1963) is a former New Zealand international cricketer. He scored more than 2,000 runs in his 41 Test matches for New Zealand. A left-handed batsman and occasional right-arm medium pace bowler in first class cricket for Auckland and Central Districts, Greatbatch scored 9,890 first class runs in total as well as being an occasional wicket keeper.

==International career==
Greatbatch highest test score of 146 not out off 485 balls was against Australia at Perth in November 1989. Greatbatch was at the crease for 11 hours (2 days) to save New Zealand from defeat, the game ending in a draw because of his efforts. He received a standing ovation at the end of the game. Greatbatch&#x27;s defensive innings is still considered by pundits to be one of the greatest cricket centuries ever, under the circumstances.

For the 1992 Cricket World Cup Greatbatch was not selected to play in the first match, against Australia. However, he was selected to open against South Africa in place of John Wright, who had been injured, and proceeded to bat to take advantage of fielding restrictions early in the innings. The strategy worked, so was repeated again throughout the World Cup and Greatbatch became one of the first &#x27;pinch hitter&#x27; players to open an innings in One Day Internationals. Because of this success other cricketing nations, notably Sri Lanka, adopted the idea of opening with an aggressive batsman who normally plays in the middle order of test matches to score quick runs early and this tactic is now common in international cricket.

Mark Greatbatch finished his career with 2,021 Test runs and 2,206 ODI runs.

==After cricket==

In September 2005 he became director of coaching at Warwickshire County Cricket Club in England. After relegation from both the County Championship and Pro40 League in 2007 he was replaced by Ashley Giles. In January, 2010, Greatbatch was appointed the coach of the New Zealand national cricket team.

In 2022, Asterix, a horse that Greatbatch partly owned, won the New Zealand Derby.

<text>Ravindranath Rampaul (born 15 October 1984) is a Trinidadian cricketer who plays as a pace bowler. He&#x27;s played for the West Indies, Trinidad and Tobago and IPL side Royal Challengers Bangalore. Rampaul has also featured for CPL outfits Barbados Tridents and Trinbago Knight Riders along with English County cricket teams Surrey and Derbyshire. Rampaul was a notable member of the Windies side that won the 2012 T20 World Cup.

==Youth cricket==
Rampaul played youth cricket for West Indies and Trinidad and Tobago, playing at the World Under-15 Challenge in England in 2000, and at the 2002 Under-19 World Cup, before breaking the record wicket tally in the regional youth tournament in West Indies after taking 45 wickets in five matches during the 2002 tournament. The following season, he took 27 wickets, as Trinidad and Tobago won their first youth title since 1987. By that time, however, he had also made his first-class debut, playing three Busta Cup matches for Trinidad and Tobago during the 2001–02 season and taking six wickets.

==International career==
After playing six further matches during the 2002–03 season, and taking 18 wickets, with only Marlon Black taking more for Trinidad and Tobago that season, Rampaul was selected for West Indies Under-19s in the 2003–04 Red Stripe Bowl one-day tournament. Rampaul was leading wicket-taker for the U-19 team, as his eight wickets was double that of any other, and after the tournament completed, Rampaul was called up to represent West Indies in their tour of Zimbabwe in October and November.

Rampaul went wicketless in his first game, sending down 13 no-balls in 30 overs, and was not selected for either of the two Test matches. However, after taking two wickets, including opener Dion Ebrahim, in the one-day warm-up match against Zimbabwe A, Rampaul played in four of the five ODIs. He failed to take a wicket in the series, which West Indies eventually claimed 3–2 with a win in the final game, and Rampaul was the most expensive West Indian bowler among those bowling more than four overs per game,

Rampaul also went to the South African leg of the tour, and recorded his first five-wicket-haul in first-class cricket, taking five of the first six wickets in a tour match against Free State. They were 86 for six after West Indies had posted 618, and Rampaul ended with figures of five for 55. Rampaul played all three tour games, but once again was left out of the Test matches. After &quot;impressing&quot; in a one-day tour match against South Africa A, he was left out of the team for the first ODI, but replaced Vasbert Drakes for the second match. Rampaul picked up the wicket of Jacques Kallis for 16, and contributed 24 runs, as West Indies lost by 16 runs. He removed Kallis again in the final ODI, when West Indies nearly leveled the 5-match series to 2 games apiece. Kallis though, in scoring 135, helped the South Africans to a 3-2 series triumph.  Rampaul&#x27;s figures of 2-56 from his 10 overs, was lauded as a &quot;marvellous late effort&quot;

After once again playing in the Under-19 World Cup, taking nine wickets as West Indies reached the final but ultimately lost to Pakistan, Rampaul played in all five ODIs against England at home, taking four wickets but once again being the most expensive of the regular bowlers. Between 1 October 1998 and 14 July 2006 only Tino Best conceded more wides and no-balls per ten overs in ODIs for the West Indies.

===Injury problems===
Rampaul was selected in a 13-man squad to play the first home Test against Bangladesh, but was not selected to play, and one month later, he was struck with injury. He had played three matches during the 2004 NatWest Series. He later picked up two wickets, Geraint Jones and Andrew Strauss, for 34 in a seven-wicket win over England. However due to a shin injury he took no further part in the series, and flew home before the Test matches. 

Rampaul returned to cricket when he turned up in Trinidad league cricket in February 2005, and represented Trinidad and Tobago again during the 2005–06 KFC Cup in October, where he played four matches and was Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s leading wicket-taker along with Samuel Badree. However, Rampaul sustained a leg injury, and did not play any games during the first-class Carib Beer Series, which his team won.

===Return from injury===
In July 2006, Rampaul was awarded a cricket scholarship by the Australian High Commissioner to Trinidad and Tobago, and attended coaching sessions in Australia.

Rampaul became Ireland&#x27;s overseas player for the 2008 Friends Provident Trophy. He helped them win their first FP Trophy game for two years against Warwickshire. In six matches for Ireland Rampaul took 10 wickets at an average of 28.70, with best bowling figures of 3/40.

Pakistan toured the West Indies in April and May 2011 for a T20I, five ODIs, and two Tests. Osman Samiuddin remarked that during the Tests Rampaul &quot;ran in precisely with the enthusiasm of a man unable to believe how his career has suddenly soared, racing in so the dream doesn&#x27;t suddenly end&quot;. Rampaul was the West Indies leading wicket-taker in the two test series, with eleven dismissals at an average of 20.90. India began a tour of the West Indies in June. Rampaul was fined 10 per cent of his match fee for the first Test for questioning the umpire&#x27;s decision when he was given out. He eventually earned ten wickets in the three-match test series at an average of 24.90.

A shoulder injury in March prevented Rampaul from playing domestic cricket for Trinidad and Tobago; a bout of dengue fever the same month prevented him from playing in the ODI series against Australia. He began club cricket towards the end of the month and hoped to represent Trinidad and Tobago to prove his fitness to the national selectors. At last Rampaul was included in the team for the third and final Test after an injury to fellow fast bowler Fidel Edwards.

In September 2021, Rampaul was named in the West Indies&#x27; squad for the 2021 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup.

=== County cricket ===
During March 2016 Rampaul signed a two-year contract to play for Surrey County Cricket. On his debut for the side, he picked up 5 for 93, at Trent Bridge against Nottinghamshire in the English County Championship. Rampaul was a member of the Surrey side which reached the final of the 2017 Royal London One Day Cup. In October 2017, Rampaul joined Derbyshire, in a three-year deal.

==Bowling style==
In 2004, at the age of 19, Rampaul was regularly bowling in excess of and by 2011 the usual pace of his deliveries was pushing . Rampaul is well known for his swing bowling, in the words of ESPNcricinfo&#x27;s Daniel Brettig, &quot;Sending the ball down at brisk pace, Rampaul maintains an immaculate seam position, maximising his chances of early deviation through the air or off the pitch&quot;.

<doc id="897281" wikidata="Q7589550" url="?curid=897281" title="St. Louis–style pizza">
<text>St. Louis–style pizza is a type of pizza in St. Louis, Missouri, and surrounding areas. The pizza has a thin cracker-like crust made without yeast, topped with sweet tomato sauce and Provel cheese, and is cut into squares or rectangles rather than wedges.

St. Louis–style pizza is available at local restaurants and chains such as Imo&#x27;s Pizza. Frozen St. Louis–style pizzas are sold at local supermarkets such as Schnucks and Dierbergs Markets.

==Distinct characteristics==

===Thin crust===
Made without yeast and rolled thin, the crust of St. Louis–style pizza is crisp and cracker-like, unlike the doughier Chicago-style pizza and New York–style pizza.

Instead of the larger pie-like wedges seen in other pizza styles, it is cut into three- or four-inch squares, referred to as a &quot;party cut&quot; or &quot;tavern cut&quot;. It has been suggested that the square cut was inspired by Ed Imo’s former profession as a tile-layer. The smaller slices and rigid crust help support the weight of its toppings.
===Provel cheese===

Provel cheese is typically—though not always—used in place of mozzarella. Provel is a white processed cheese made from cheddar, Swiss, and provolone, developed by Costa Grocery in St. Louis during the 1950s. It’s made in Wisconsin by a Kraft Heinz subsidiary, primarily for the St. Louis market.

===Sweet tomato sauce===
The tomato sauce is seasoned with more oregano than other styles of pizza, and is sweeter, likely due to the influence of Sicilian immigrants upon Italian foods in St. Louis.

<doc id="897283" wikidata="Q782330" url="?curid=897283" title="Europop (album)">
<text>Europop is the debut studio album by Italian electronic group Eiffel 65. The album was released in late 1999 as under Bliss Corporation and Universal Records and Republic Music (Universal and Republic would merge to Universal Republic). The album is most notable for the group&#x27;s two biggest hits: &quot;Blue (Da Ba Dee)&quot; and &quot;Move Your Body,&quot; which topped the charts worldwide in 2000.

== Music ==
The title of &quot;Europop&quot; describes its genre; it combines several dance styles unique to European countries, such as the United Kingdom&#x27;s trip hop, Germany&#x27;s techno, and Italy&#x27;s dance music, and songs are structured like typical pop songs. The album follows a deep house template featuring vocoder vocal effects, synthesizer hooks, and &quot;nursery rhyme choruses,&quot; with occasional deviations from it into string-orchestrated hip-hop (&quot;Living in a Bubble&quot;) and &quot;trippy&quot; house stylings (&quot;Now is Forever&quot; and &quot;Europop&quot;). Elements of 1980s synthpop dominate, with reviews making comparisons to Depeche Mode (especially towards &quot;Your Clown&quot;), Erasure, A-ha, and Duran Duran.

== Lyrics ==
Although some of its tracks are self-indulgent and facile, &quot;Europop&quot; generally incorporates social commentary on deceptions and connections between humans. Explained lead singer Jeffrey Jey, &quot;We like to speak of how things affect human beings without saying &#x27;This is bad&#x27; or &#x27;We want to drown everyone who does that.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Living in a Bubble&quot;&#x27;s message is making sure what&#x27;s real in &quot;a place of lies and hype&quot;; specifically, according to Jey, it is about how celebrities have people they encounter be unusually &quot;friendly and openhearted right away&quot; when popular, only for that to change when their fame decreases. The subject of &quot;Silicon World&quot; dreams of &quot;a silicon girl with silicon lips and silicon hair&quot; he&#x27;ll never meet. &quot;Too Much of Heaven&quot; critiques societies&#x27; fixation on wealth and its effects on morality, while &quot;Blue (Da Ba Dee)&quot; is about someone where &quot;everything is blue for him&quot; due to a need to be heard.

&quot;Europop&quot; features references to consumer technology. In &quot;Hyperlink (Deep Down)&quot;, the subject displays lust through computer terminology like &quot;a sexual browser&quot; and &quot;a hyperlink to go inside you,&quot; and a tribute to the PlayStation, &quot;My Console,&quot; that references games such as &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;, &quot;Tekken 3&quot; and &quot;Bloody Roar&quot;. There are also songs about love and relationships, including the aforementioned &quot;Silicon World&quot; and &quot;Hyperlink (Deep Down)&quot; as well as &quot;Your Clown,&quot; which depicts the subject trying to get out of an abusive love triangle caused by his girlfriend.

==Sound==
The album features pitch-corrected vocals and Euro disco beats throughout. Eiffel 65 perform all the songs on this album in English.

==Reception==

Contemporaneous reviews from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, and &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; welcomed the humorous, light-weight dance-pop style of &quot;Europop&quot; in a pop music market saturated with mostly dour music, calling serious cuts such as &quot;Your Clown&quot; and &quot;Now is Forever&quot; the LP&#x27;s weakest. Reviews from &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also appreciated its rejection of intellectual pretentiousness common in electronic music. On the other hand, the album was criticized for a lack of differentiation (in composition and production techniques) between songs, with Jose F. Promis writing its best moments came when it combined its template with different genres. In his review for &quot;Courier News&quot;, Tab Benoit called Eiffel 65 a &quot;one-trick pony&quot; for using the same vocal effect for all tracks.

The album peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States, and the song &quot;Blue (Da Ba Dee)&quot; peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, impressive for an EDM song at the time of its release. In February 2000, the album was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of two million copies in the US.

<doc id="897288" wikidata="Q1181089" url="?curid=897288" title="Dean Jones (actor)">
<text>Dean Carroll Jones (January 25, 1931 – September 1, 2015) was an American actor. He was best known as The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s main leading man in the 1970s with his roles as Agent Zeke Kelso in &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot; (1965), Jim Douglas in the &quot;Herbie&quot; franchise (1969–1997), and with other film companies such as Dr. Herman Varnick in &quot;Beethoven&quot; (1992). He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his performance as Albert Dooley in &quot;The Million Dollar Duck&quot; (1971). In 1995, he was inducted as a Disney Legend for his film work.

==Early life==
Jones was born on January 25, 1931, in Decatur, Alabama, to Andrew Guy Jones, a traveling construction worker, and the former Nolia Elizabeth Wilhite.

As a student at Riverside High School in Decatur, Jones had his own local radio show, &quot;Dean Jones Sings&quot;. He served in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War, and after his discharge worked at the Bird Cage Theater at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm in Buena Park, California. 

Jones attended Asbury College in Wilmore near Lexington, Kentucky. A member of its Class of 1953, he did not graduate, but the university in 2003 awarded him an honorary degree. On March 4, 2011, he addressed the community during the dedication ceremony of Asbury&#x27;s Andrew S. Miller Center for Communications Arts.

==Stage==

After appearing in minor film and television roles, Jones made his Broadway debut in the 1960 play &quot;There Was a Little Girl&quot;. He stepped into the role in Boston, with only one day&#x27;s notice. In 1960, he also played Dave Manning in the Broadway comedy &quot;Under the Yum-Yum Tree&quot;, a role he repeated in the 1963 film version starring Jack Lemmon and Carol Lynley.

After working in film and television, Jones was set to return to Broadway as the star of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;Company&quot; in 1970. Shortly after opening night, he withdrew from the show, due to stress that he was undergoing from ongoing divorce proceedings. Director Harold Prince agreed to replace him with Larry Kert if Jones would open the show and record the cast album. He agreed, and his performance is preserved on the original cast album, although it was Kert who received the Tony nomination for Best Actor in a Musical.

In 1986, Jones, by then having become a fervent born-again Christian, starred in &quot;Into the Light&quot;, a musical about scientists and the Shroud of Turin, which closed after only six performances. He had far more success touring in the one-man show &quot;St. John in Exile&quot; as the last surviving Apostle of Jesus Christ, reminiscing about his life while imprisoned on the Greek island of Patmos. One performance was filmed in 1986. He made one more Broadway appearance, in 1993, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, in a special two-day concert staging of &quot;Company&quot; featuring most of the original Broadway cast.

==Television and film==

Jones began as a contract performer for MGM, beginning with a small role as a soldier in &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; (1956) and he later played disc jockey Teddy Talbot in the Elvis Presley film &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; (1957). He portrayed a soldier in both &quot;Imitation General&quot; (also 1957) with Glenn Ford and &quot;Never So Few&quot; (1959) with Frank Sinatra. He gave a powerful performance as an ex-con trying to reform (with Joe&#x27;s help) on &quot;Bonanza&quot; Season 3 Episode 8 &quot;The Friendship&quot; which aired 11/11/1961.
Jones subsequently starred in the NBC television sitcom &quot;Ensign O&#x27;Toole&quot; (1962–63), produced by Four Star Television, portraying an easy-going and inexperienced officer on a U.S. Navy destroyer. His costars included Jack Mullaney, Jack Albertson, Jay C. Flippen, Harvey Lembeck, and Beau Bridges. He also recorded a singing album, &quot;Introducing Dean Jones&quot;, for Valiant Records.

As &quot;Ensign O&#x27;Toole&quot; was the lead-in show on NBC to Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful World of Color&quot;, Disney ordered a print of Jones&#x27; latest film &quot;Under the Yum Yum Tree&quot; to study. Disney signed Jones for Disney film productions beginning with &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot;. His performance was well-received. Jones continued with Disney for many years, starring in films such as &quot;The Ugly Dachshund&quot; (1966), &quot;Monkeys, Go Home!&quot; (1966), &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1968), &quot;The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot; (1968). &quot;The Love Bug&quot; (1969), &quot;The Million Dollar Duck&quot; (1971), &quot;Snowball Express&quot; (1972), &quot;The Shaggy D.A.&quot; (1976), and &quot;Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo&quot; (1977).

Jones&#x27; signature Disney role would be as race car driver Jim Douglas in the successful &quot;Herbie&quot; series. In addition to the two feature films, Jones starred in the short-lived television series &quot;Herbie, the Love Bug&quot; (1982) and the television film &quot;The Love Bug&quot; (1997). In 1969, he was the host of a short-lived sketch-comedy hour on ABC-TV titled &quot;What&#x27;s It All About, World?&quot; that became a variety show midway into its run, when the title was changed to &quot;The Dean Jones Variety Hour&quot;.

Away from Disney, Jones costarred with Broadway-era co-star Jane Fonda in the romantic comedy, &quot;Any Wednesday&quot; (1966). In a dramatic turn, in the NBC television film &quot;When Every Day Was the Fourth of July&quot; (1978) he portrayed Ed Cooper, an attorney in the 1930s who agrees to defend a man who has been accused of murder, accepting the case only after urging from his daughter. He reprised the role of Ed Cooper in the ABC television sequel &quot;The Long Days of Summer&quot; (1980). He appeared with Gregory Peck and Danny DeVito as Bill Coles, the president of Peck&#x27;s company, which was fighting a hostile takeover by DeVito, in &quot;Other People&#x27;s Money&quot; (1991).

Jones, who was known for playing pleasant characters, took on the role as Dr. Herman Varnick, the evil veterinarian in the family film &quot;Beethoven&quot; (1992). He employed method acting for the first time in his career and did not break character off-set throughout the film&#x27;s shooting period much to the surprise of cast members as well as family and friends who had never seen him so immersed in a role. He maintained his relationship to the Beethoven franchise by providing the voice of George Newton in the animated television version of &quot;Beethoven&quot;. He also appeared in a small role as Director of Central Intelligence Judge Arthur Moore in the film adaptation of Tom Clancy&#x27;s &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; (1994), which starred Harrison Ford.

Jones also appeared in two episodes of the Angela Lansbury series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; in 1984 and 1988.

==Personal life==
Jones was married to Mae Entwisle from 1954 to 1971; the couple had two daughters. He was married to actress Lory Patrick from 1973 until his death in 2015.

Jones became a born-again Christian in 1973 or 1974. His book &quot;Under Running Laughter&quot; (1982) recounts his experience of Christianity. He had previously suffered from bouts of depression. His wife, Lory, said, &quot;One night he got down on his knees and prayed that God would free him from the miserable moods that he had always suffered. He told me that in an instant it was gone and he felt peace and joy flood into his heart.&quot;

Jones appeared in several Christian films. In 1977 he portrayed Charles Colson in the feature film &quot;Born Again&quot;. He voiced the narrator in Birdwing Records&#x27; 1979 studio album &quot;Nathaniel the Grublet&quot;. Jones also voiced the standard English narration for the 80-minute Bible overview &quot;God&#x27;s Story: From Creation to Eternity&quot;, and was the voice of Father Tim for Focus on the Family Radio Theatre audio drama &quot;At Home in Mitford&quot; in 2003.

In July 1994, Jones was a guest on &quot;100 Huntley Street&quot;, a Canadian Christian discussion program.

In 1998, Jones founded the Christian Rescue Committee (CRC), an organization that helps provide a &quot;way of escape to Jews, Christians, and others persecuted for their faith&quot;.

===Death===
Jones died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in Los Angeles on September 1, 2015, at age 84. His remains were cremated.

<doc id="897293" wikidata="Q1371107" url="?curid=897293" title="Archezoa">
<text>In biology, Archezoa is a term that has been introduced by several authors to refer to a group of organisms (a taxon). Authors include Josef Anton Maximilian Perty, Ernst Haeckel and in the 20th century by Thomas Cavalier-Smith in his classification system. Each author used the name to refer to different arrays of organisms. This reuse by later authors of the same taxon name for different groups of organisms is widely criticized in taxonomy because the inclusion of the name in a sentence (e.g. &quot;Archezoa have no olfactory organs&quot;) does not make sense unless the particular usage is specified (e.g. &quot;Archezoa &quot;sensu&quot; Cavalier-Smith (1987) have no olfactory organs&quot;). Nonetheless, all uses of &#x27;Archezoa&#x27; are now obsolete.

== Archezoa &quot;sensu&quot; Cavalier-Smith (1987) ==
Cavalier-Smith proposed the term &#x27;Archezoa&#x27; for a paraphyletic (see Paraphyly) territory of eukaryotes that primitively lacked mitochondria. Like Margulis and others before (see Pelomyxa), Cavalier-Smith argued that the initial ancestor of eukaryotes emerged prior to the endosymbiotic acquisition (see endosymbiosis) of mitochondria. The same paraphyletic territory was referred to as &#x27;Hypochondria&#x27; by others. The argument for Archezoa sensu Cavalier-Smith was never universally accepted because of conflicting information, and was dropped when the contrary argument, that amitochondriates were descendants of eukaryotes with mitochondria, became dominant. 

Eukaryotes that eventually acquired a bacterial endosymbiont that became the mitochondria were placed in a taxonomic group which Cavalier-Smith called the Metakaryota, whereas the Archezoa represented an earlier paraphyletic group to which Cavalier-Smith variously assigned the diplomonads, &quot;Entamoeba&quot;, Microsporidia, oxymonads, parabasalids (Parabasalids), pelobionts (see &quot;Pelomyxa&quot;), retortamonads, trichomonads, and &quot;Trimastix&quot; (see Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s system of classification). With the rejection of &#x27;Archeozoa&#x27;, the meaning of the term &#x27;Metakaryota&#x27; became the same as &#x27;Eukaryota&#x27; (see Eukaryote), and Metakaryota became superfluous.

== Original mitochondria lost ==
Eukaryotic protists lacking mitochondria were discovered to have experienced secondary mitochondrial loss, meaning that their ancestors once possessed mitochondria but that these mitochondria had, over time, been transformed, reduced, or lost. In some of these organisms, mitochondria had degraded into simpler double-membrane bound organelles known as mitosomes and hydrogenosomes. Some of both types of organelles are known to have fully lost their genome. 

Initial discoveries found that amitochondriate organisms appeared to express mitochondrial Hsp60 and Hsp70 proteins from the nuclear DNA of the organism. This indicated that the ancestors of these organisms once possessed mitochondria which expressed these proteins, but that these genes had migrated to their nuclear DNA over time as a result of endosymbiotic gene transfer.

As a result, the argument that some extant eukaryotes lacking mitochondria had emerged from the eukaryotic lineage before mitochondria were acquired was falsified.

== Long branch attraction ==
An argument for the Archezoa group was that amitochondriate protists appeared to branch off early on from the eukaryotic lineage in phylogenetic analyses. This corroborated the supposition that Archezoa were more closely linked to primitive eukaryotes that evolved prior to the endosymbiotic process that generated the mitochondria. However, this early divergence later turned out to be a class of systematic errors in phylogenetic analysis called &quot;long branch attraction&quot;.

<text>Nelder Grove, located in the western Sierra Nevada within the Sierra National Forest in Madera County, California, is a Giant sequoia grove that was formerly known as Fresno Grove. The grove is a tract containing 60 mature Giant Sequoia (&quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot;) trees, the largest concentration of giant sequoias in the Sierra National Forest. The grove also contains several historical points of interest, including pioneer cabins, giant sequoia stumps left by 19th-century loggers, and the site where the Forest King exhibition tree was felled in 1870 for display.

Before European Americans arrived, Nelder Grove had 400 mature sequoias, but the population has experienced several steep declines since then. About 70% of the mature trees were cut during the late 19th century timber era. Despite federal protection in the 20th century, the sequoias have been further impacted by decades of fire exclusion, with 38 trees lost in the Railroad Fire of 2017. Today, only 60 mature specimens remain in the grove.

In 1928, the Madera Sugar Pine Company transferred the land to the U.S. Forest Service, placing the grove under federal protection.

== Ecology ==
Nelder Grove, a montane forest in the Sierra Nevada, is primarily composed of giant sequoias along with other tree species such as ponderosa pine, white fir, and California incense-cedar. The sequoias in Nelder Grove exhibit a low level of genetic diversity, unusual even for their species. Despite its proximity, just from Mariposa Grove, there&#x27;s no evidence of genetic exchange between the two populations. This genetic isolation heightens Nelder Grove&#x27;s vulnerability to climate change, underscoring its conservation importance.

The grove also supports rare plant species, including the mountain-lady slipper orchid and the veined water lichen. Its wildlife includes black bear,
mule deer, long-tailed weasel,
raccoon, gray squirrel, chipmunk, and flying squirrels.

==History==

===Native people===
Human occupation of Nelder Grove dates back approximately 15,000 years. Historically, the area served as a seasonal hub for the Mono and Miwok tribes during their trans-Sierra travels. Other tribes, including the Dumma, Heuchi, Chuckchansi, Chowchillas, Paiute, Kechayi, and Dalinchi, also traveled through the region. Artifacts such as mortar holes, which were used to grind acorns into flour, are evidence of this longstanding human presence.

===Exploration and naming===
In July 1858, conservationist Galen Clark formally discovered Nelder Grove, naming it Fresno Grove due to its location in Fresno County and proximity to the headwaters of the Fresno River. However, a later discovery in Robert Eccleston&#x27;s diary revealed that the Mariposa Battalion had already passed through the grove in 1851 during the Mariposa War, a discovery that had not been publicized at the time.

The grove is now named for John A. Nelder, known as the &quot;Hermit of the Fresno Forest&quot; by John Muir. Nelder, who came to California during the 1849 gold rush, filed a homestead claim for 165 acres within the grove in 1874 and built a cabin near its largest tree the following year. Muir wrote about Nelder and the grove for The Atlantic Monthly in 1878, later including it in his book &quot;Our National Parks&quot;.

John Nelder was killed in 1889 when a fire consumed his cabin. His son inherited his estate and deeded it to the Madera Flume and Trading Company in 1892.

===Timber era===
Nelder Grove was subjected to extensive logging in the late 19th century. The Madera Flume and Trading Company logged 277 mature sequoias, each measuring over four feet in diameter, between 1880 and 1892. Many of the surrounding trees, including sugar pines, ponderosa pines, white firs, and incense-cedars were also clearcut.

The logging process in the grove was grueling, with horse and oxen teams hauling heavy wagons of logs to the mill. The arrival of a Dolbeer single spool donkey, a steam-powered winch, made the work easier in later years. Due to a lack of water in the grove, a long gravity tramway was built to transport the lumber to the Soquel log flume, which then transported it to the Madera lumber yards, before it finally reached the national market via the Southern Pacific Railroad.

By 1897, the area close to the mill had been completely logged, and the last sequoia in Nelder Grove was cut.

==Noteworthy trees==
The Nelder Grove is home to several giant sequoias that are notable for their size and history.

==Access==
Nelder Grove is less accessible compared to the nearby Mariposa Grove, which can be easily reached by paved roads and shuttle buses. Under favorable conditions, visitors can reach Nelder Grove within two hours from Fresno by heading north, or from Yosemite National Park by traveling south on Highway 41 to Road 632, also known as Sky Ranch Road. However, the dirt road leading into the grove can be difficult, with muddy and rutted conditions, and is often impassable due to deep snow during the winter months.

==Hiking and Recreation==
The Shadow of the Giants National Recreation Trail, located in Nelder Grove, was built in 1965 and designated a National Recreation Trail in 1978. However, the Railroad Fire in 2015 destroyed the trail’s informational panels, bridges, and other infrastructure. As of 2022, the trail remains closed and overgrown with brush.

Additionally, there is a Sierra National Forest campground located at the Nelder Grove which serves as a spot for camping and outdoor activities.

==Structures and Buildings==

The Nelder Grove Interpretive Center features several artifacts from the area&#x27;s logging era, including two restored log cabins and replicas of traditional logging chutes. These cabins, originally constructed by pioneers in the late 1800s at nearby Bildeo Meadow, were moved to Nelder Grove in the 1980s under a project funded by the National Historic Preservation Act. They are among the oldest structures in the Sierra National Forest.

==Railroad Fire==
In September 2017, the Railroad Fire swept through much of Nelder Grove, destroying 38 of its giant sequoias and leading to the permanent closure of the popular Shadow of the Giants trail.

Experts attribute the wildfire’s intensity to several factors, including the historic 2011–2017 California drought, which caused significant dieback and stress in giant sequoias. Additionally, a century of fire suppression had led to heavy fuel buildup on the forest floor and dense understory growth, making the blaze more destructive.

Forest monitors had warned of such risks for decades. As early as the 1960s, Madera County discussed acquiring the grove to bypass federal restrictions on timber cutting and prescribed burns in the Sierra National Forest. Despite these warnings, no major preventive actions were taken before the Railroad Fire. “We’d better reduce the fuels, or we’re going to lose this resource,” Paul Rich, a retired 33-year veteran of the U.S. Forest Service, warned in 2000.

==Protection and Restoration Efforts==

Following the Railroad Fire, researchers noted a strong correlation between fire severity and the density, growth, and dominance of new giant sequoia seedlings. The successful natural regeneration of these seedlings provides hope for restoring other groves with large burn scars.

In July 2022, the U.S. Forest Service authorized an expedited Emergency Response plan to reduce combustible materials in Nelder Grove. Officials aim to replicate the success of wildfire prevention efforts seen in nearby Mariposa Grove during the 2022 Washburn Fire. As part of the initiative, 42 mature giant sequoias now have a 100-foot protective buffer.

<doc id="897299" wikidata="Q72869" url="?curid=897299" title="Stan Laurel">
<text>Stan Laurel ( ; born Arthur Stanley Jefferson; 16 June 1890 – 23 February 1965) was an English comic actor, director and writer who was one half of the comedy duo Laurel and Hardy. He appeared with his comedy partner Oliver Hardy in 107 short films, feature films and cameo roles.

Laurel began his career in music hall, where he developed a number of his standard comic devices, including the bowler hat, the deep comic gravity and the nonsensical understatement, and developed his skills in pantomime and music hall sketches. He was a member of &quot;Fred Karno&#x27;s London Comedians&quot;, where he was Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s understudy. He and Chaplin arrived in the United States on the same ship from the United Kingdom with the Karno troupe. Laurel began his film career in 1917 and made his final appearance in 1951. He appeared with his comic partner Oliver Hardy in the film short &quot;The Lucky Dog&quot; in 1921, although they did not become an official team until late 1927. He then appeared exclusively with Hardy until retiring after his comedy partner&#x27;s death in 1957.

In April 1961, at the 33rd Academy Awards, Laurel was given an Academy Honorary Award for his pioneering work in comedy, and he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard. Laurel and Hardy were ranked top among best double acts and seventh overall in a 2005 UK poll to find the &quot;Comedians&#x27; Comedian&quot;. In 2019, Laurel topped a list of the greatest British comedians compiled by a panel on the television channel Gold. In 2009, a bronze statue of the duo was unveiled in Laurel&#x27;s hometown of Ulverston.

==Early life==
Arthur Stanley Jefferson was born on 16 June 1890 in his grandparents&#x27; house in Ulverston, Lancashire, to Arthur J. Jefferson, an actor and theatre manager from Bishop Auckland, and Margaret (née Metcalfe), an actress from Ulverston. He was one of five children. One of them was Edward, an actor who appeared in four of Stan&#x27;s shorts.

His parents were very active in the theatre, frequently travelling around the country. Consequently, Laurel, who was too young to travel, lived in Ulverston with his grandparents, George and Sarah Metcalfe, for the first seven years of his life. He became very familiar with Ulverston. He attended services with his religious grandparents at Holy Trinity Church, which is close to Argyle Street and is where his parents were married. He was fond of Beer&#x27;s treacle toffee from Gillam&#x27;s general store on Market Street. Laurel remembered the treat in later life, writing to family in England in January 1950:I used to go shopping on Market Street with Grandma Metcalfe -- that was a big treat for me. Beers Treacle toffee, it sure was good!Laurel, who had a lifelong love of fishing, used to take a rod to Ulverston&#x27;s canal, learning from his uncle John Shaw. His favourite place was beyond the old North Lonsdale Iron and Steel Company Ltd, close to his home in Argyle Street. Just behind him was the viaduct carrying the railway from Carnforth. Laurel in later years would recall swinging on a pair of lock gates on the canal as he waited for a bite on his line.

During these fishing expeditions, Laurel would have passed Ulverston&#x27;s cemetery, where he was impressed by a miniature lighthouse memorial built in memory of Dr Thomas Watkins Wilson. The lighthouse memorial, which is still there today, had a light at the top that was once lit 24 hours a day. The lighthouse memorial was designated as a Grade II listed building in 1996. In 1932, Laurel was being interviewed by a &quot;Daily Herald&quot; reporter and as they looked up at his name in lights above a theatre in London&#x27;s Leicester Square, he said:Looks great but kind of wasteful, but you should see the lighthouse in the graveyard at Ulverston in Lancashire where I was born. They put it up when I was a kid, a tombstone with a light on top. It was the Eighth Wonder of the World to me. Ever since then it&#x27;s been my ambition to have a tombstone like that.Laurel went on frequent excursions from Ulverston railway station into the Lake District with his cousins, grandparents and sometimes his parents. They visited his aunt and uncle John and Nant Shaw when they ran grocery shops, first at Flookburgh, and later Sawrey. Another favourite place to visit was the lake at Windermere.

Laurel had his first taste of the theatre in Ulverston. The Hippodrome theatre, known as Spencer&#x27;s Gaff, was just across the road from his home, in Lightburn Park. The theatre was like a giant tent, made from wood with a canvas roof. Laurel&#x27;s parents both trod the boards here and his father A. J. developed some of the plays he would later become known for here. The Hippodrome burnt down in 1910, the year Laurel sailed for America with the Fred Karno troupe. Laurel visited Ulverston with his comedy partner Oliver Hardy on Tuesday 27 May 1947 at the invitation of the town&#x27;s urban council. The comedians were given a civic reception at the Coronation Hall and Laurel was presented with a copy of his birth certificate on the hall&#x27;s balcony, watched on by hundreds of fans. Laurel and Hardy then visited 3 Argyle Street for a tour of Laurel&#x27;s former home, posing for the North West Evening Mail&#x27;s photographer as they emerged from the house, crowded by fans and well-wishers. The comedy duo were appearing at Morecambe&#x27;s Winter Gardens at the time.

Later, Laurel spent much time living with his maternal grandmother, Sarah Metcalfe in North Shields. He attended school at King James I Grammar School in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, and the King&#x27;s School in Tynemouth, Northumberland.

He moved with his parents to Glasgow, Scotland, where he completed his education at Stonelaw Public School. His father managed Glasgow&#x27;s Metropole Theatre, where Laurel first worked. His boyhood hero was Dan Leno, considered one of the greatest English music hall comedians. With a natural affinity for the theatre, Laurel gave his first professional performance on stage at the Panopticon in Glasgow at the age of sixteen, where he polished his skills at pantomime and music hall sketches. It was the music hall from where he drew his standard comic devices, including his bowler hat and nonsensical understatement.

Laurel joined music hall impresario Fred Karno&#x27;s troupe of actors in 1910 with the stage name of &quot;Stan Jefferson&quot;; the troupe, advertised as &quot;Fred Karno&#x27;s London Comedians&quot;, also included a young Charlie Chaplin. Under the tutelage of Karno, the music hall nurtured him, and in England he acted as Chaplin&#x27;s understudy for some time. Karno was a pioneer of slapstick, and in his biography Laurel stated, &quot;Fred Karno didn&#x27;t teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it&quot;. Chaplin and Laurel arrived in the United States on the same ship from Britain with the Karno troupe and toured the country. During the First World War, Laurel registered for military service in America on 5 June 1917, as required under the Selective Service Act. He was not called up; his registration card states his status as resident alien and his deafness as exemptions.

The Karno troupe broke up in the spring of 1914. Stan joined with two other former Karno performers, Edgar Hurley and his wife Ethel (known as &quot;Wren&quot;) to form &quot;The Three Comiques&quot;. On the advice of booking agent Gordon Bostock, they called themselves &quot;the Keystone Trio&quot;. Stan started to do his character as an imitation of Charlie Chaplin, and the Hurleys began to do their parts as silent comedians Chester Conklin and Mabel Normand. They played successfully from February through October 1915, until the Hurleys and Stan parted ways. Between 1916 and 1918, he teamed up with Alice Cooke and Baldwin Cooke, who became his lifelong friends, to form the Stan Jefferson Trio.

Amongst other performers, Laurel worked briefly alongside Oliver Hardy in the silent film short &quot;The Lucky Dog&quot; (1921), before the two were a team. It was around this time that Laurel met actress Mae Dahlberg. Around the same time, he adopted the stage name of Laurel at Dahlberg&#x27;s suggestion that his stage name Stan Jefferson was unlucky, due to it having thirteen letters. The pair were performing together when Laurel was offered $75 a week to star in two-reel comedies. After making his first film &quot;Nuts in May&quot;, Universal offered him a contract. The contract was soon cancelled during a reorganisation at the studio. Among the films in which Dahlberg and Laurel appeared together was the 1922 parody &quot;Mud and Sand&quot;.

By 1924, Laurel had given up the stage for full-time film work, under contract with Joe Rock for 12 two-reel comedies. The contract had one unusual stipulation: that Dahlberg was not to appear in any of the films. Rock thought that her temperament was hindering Laurel&#x27;s career. In 1925, she started interfering with Laurel&#x27;s work, so Rock offered her a cash settlement and a one-way ticket back to her native Australia, which she accepted. The 12 two-reel comedies were &quot;Mandarin Mix-Up&quot; (1924), &quot;Detained&quot; (1924), &quot;Monsieur Don&#x27;t Care&quot; (1924), &quot;West of Hot Dog&quot; (1924), &quot;Somewhere in Wrong&quot; (1925), &quot;Twins&quot; (1925), &quot;Pie-Eyed&quot; (1925), &quot;The Snow Hawk&quot; (1925), &quot;Navy Blue Days&quot; (1925), &quot;The Sleuth&quot; (1925), &quot;Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde&quot; (1925) and &quot;Half a Man&quot; (1925). Laurel was credited for directing or co-directing ten silent shorts (between 1925 and 1927), but appeared in none of these. Laurel&#x27;s future partner Hardy, however, did appear in three of the shorts directed by Laurel: &quot;Yes, Yes, Nanette&quot;! (1925), &quot;Wandering Papas&quot; (1926) and &quot;Madame Mystery&quot; (1926).

==Laurel and Hardy==

Laurel next signed with the Hal Roach studio, where he began directing films, including a 1925 production called &quot;Yes, Yes, Nanette&quot; (in which Oliver Hardy had a part under the name &quot;Babe&quot; Hardy). It had been his intention to work primarily as a writer and director.

The same year, Hardy, a member of the Hal Roach Studios Comedy &quot;All Star&quot; players, was injured in a kitchen mishap and hospitalised. Because he was unable to work on the scheduled film, &quot;Get &#x27;Em Young&quot;, Laurel was asked to return to acting to fill in. Starting early in 1927, Laurel and Hardy began sharing the screen in several short films, including &quot;Duck Soup&quot;, &quot;Slipping Wives&quot; and &quot;With Love and Hisses&quot;. The two became friends and their comic chemistry soon became obvious. Roach Studios&#x27; supervising director Leo McCarey noticed the audience reaction to them and began teaming them, leading to the creation of the &quot;Laurel and Hardy&quot; series later that year.

Together, the two men began producing a huge body of short films, including &quot;The Battle of the Century&quot;, &quot;Should Married Men Go Home?&quot;, &quot;Two Tars&quot;, &quot;Be Big!&quot;, &quot;Big Business&quot; and many others. Laurel and Hardy successfully made the transition to talking films with the short &quot;Unaccustomed As We Are&quot; in 1929. They also appeared in their first feature in one of the revue sequences of &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929,&quot; and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in the lavish all-colour (in Technicolor) musical feature &quot;The Rogue Song&quot;. Their first starring feature &quot;Pardon Us&quot; was released in 1931. They continued to make both features and shorts until 1935, including their 1932 three-reeler &quot;The Music Box,&quot; which won an Academy Award for Best Short Subject.

===Trouble at Roach Studio===
During the 1930s, Laurel was involved in a dispute with Hal Roach which resulted in the termination of his contract. Roach maintained separate contracts for Laurel and Hardy that expired at different times, so Hardy remained at the studio and was &quot;teamed&quot; with Harry Langdon for the 1939 film &quot;Zenobia&quot;. The studio discussed a series of films co-starring Hardy with Patsy Kelly to be called &quot;The Hardy Family&quot;. But Laurel sued Roach over the contract dispute. Eventually, the case was dropped and Laurel returned to Roach. The first film that Laurel and Hardy made after Laurel returned was &quot;A Chump at Oxford&quot;. Subsequently, they made &quot;Saps at Sea&quot;, which was their last film for Roach.

===Second World War===

In 1941, Laurel and Hardy signed a contract at 20th Century-Fox to make ten films over five years. Laurel found, to his shock, that he and Hardy were hired only as actors, and were not expected to contribute to the staging, writing, or editing of the productions. When the films proved very successful, Laurel and Hardy were granted more freedom and gradually added more of their own material. They had made six Fox features when the studio suddenly abandoned B-picture production in December 1944. The team signed another contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1942, resulting in two more features.

Revisiting his music hall days, Laurel returned to England in 1947 when he and Hardy went on a six-week tour of the United Kingdom performing in variety shows. Mobbed wherever they went, Laurel&#x27;s homecoming to Ulverston took place in May, and the duo were greeted by thousands of fans outside the Coronation Hall. The &quot;Evening Mail&quot; noted: &quot;Oliver Hardy remarked to our reporter that Stan had talked about Ulverston for the past 22 years and he thought he had to see it.&quot; The tour included a &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; in front of King George VI and his consort Queen Elizabeth in London. The success of the tour led them to spend the next seven years touring the UK and Europe.

Around this time, Laurel found out that he had diabetes, so he encouraged Hardy to find solo projects, which he did, taking parts in John Wayne and Bing Crosby films.

In 1950, Laurel and Hardy were invited to France to make a feature film. The film was a disaster, a Franco-Italian co-production titled &quot;Atoll K&quot;. (The film was entitled &quot;Utopia&quot; in the US and &quot;Robinson Crusoeland&quot; in the UK.) Both stars were noticeably ill during the filming. Upon returning to the United States, they spent most of their time recovering. In 1952, Laurel and Hardy toured Europe successfully, and they returned in 1953 for another tour of the continent. During this tour, Laurel fell ill and was unable to perform for several weeks.

In May 1954, Hardy had a heart attack and cancelled the tour. In 1955, they were planning to do a television series called &quot;Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s Fabulous Fables&quot; based on children&#x27;s stories. The plans were delayed after Laurel had a stroke on 25 April 1955, from which he recovered. But as the team was planning to get back to work, Hardy had a major stroke on 14 September 1956 and was unable to return to acting.

===Hardy&#x27;s death===
When Oliver Hardy died on 7 August 1957, Laurel was devastated and never fully recovered from the loss. He was in fact too ill to attend Hardy&#x27;s funeral and said, &quot;Babe would understand&quot;. Although he continued to socialise with his fans, he refused to perform on stage or act in another film from then on, as he had no interest in working without Hardy, turning down every offer he was given for a public appearance.

==After Laurel and Hardy==
In 1961, Stan Laurel was given an Academy Honorary Award &quot;for his creative pioneering in the field of cinema comedy&quot;. Laurel was introduced by Bob Hope, and the award was accepted by Danny Kaye. Laurel had achieved his lifelong dream as a comedian and had been involved in nearly 190 films. He lived his final years in a small flat in the Oceana Apartments in Santa Monica, California. Laurel was gracious to fans and spent much time answering fan mail. His phone number was also listed in the telephone directory and he would take calls from fans.

Jerry Lewis was among the comedians to visit Laurel, and Lewis received suggestions from him for the production of &quot;The Bellboy&quot; (1960). Lewis paid tribute to Laurel by naming his main character Stanley in the film, and having Bill Richmond play a version of Laurel as well. Dick Van Dyke told a similar story. When he was just starting his career, he looked up Laurel&#x27;s phone number, called him, and then visited him at his home. Van Dyke played Laurel on &quot;The Sam Pomerantz Scandals&quot; episode of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. 

Director Stanley Kramer offered Laurel a cameo role in &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963) alongside Buster Keaton and the Three Stooges, but Laurel declined. He reportedly said he did not want to be seen on screen in his old age, especially without Hardy. It appears, however, his involvement reached the stage of filming a background matching shot of his old time convertible, with a stand-in seated at the wheel, donning a derby hat. The cameo appearance was then given to Jack Benny, who wore Laurel&#x27;s signature derby in the scene.

==Personal life==
Laurel and Mae Dahlberg never married but lived together as common-law husband and wife from 1919 to 1925, before Dahlberg accepted a one-way ticket from Joe Rock to go back to her native Australia. In November 1937, Dahlberg was back in the US and sued Laurel for financial support. At the time, Laurel&#x27;s second marriage was in the process of a divorce, with Dahlberg&#x27;s legal suit adding to Laurel&#x27;s woes. The matter was settled out of court. Dahlberg was described as a &quot;relief project worker&quot; by the court. Laurel was one of several popular British actors in Hollywood who never became a naturalised US citizen.

Laurel had four wives and married one of them a second time after their divorce. His first wife was Lois Neilson, whom he married on 13 August 1926. Together they had a daughter, Lois, who was born on . Their second child, Stanley, was born two months premature in May 1930, but died after nine days. Laurel and Neilson divorced in December 1934. Their daughter Lois died on aged 89.

In 1935, Laurel married Virginia Ruth Rogers (known as Ruth). In 1937, he filed for divorce, confessing that he was not over his ex-wife Lois, but Lois decided against a reconciliation.

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1938, Laurel married Vera Ivanova Shuvalova (known as Illeana); Ruth accused him of bigamy, but their divorce had been finalised a couple of days before his new marriage. The new marriage was very volatile, and Illeana accused him of trying to bury her alive in the back yard of their San Fernando Valley home. He and Illeana separated in 1939 and divorced in 1940, with Illeana surrendering all claim to the Laurel surname on 1 February 1940 in exchange for $6,500.

In 1941, Laurel remarried Virginia Ruth Rogers; they were divorced for the second time in early 1946. On 6 May 1946, he married Ida Kitaeva Raphael to whom he remained married until his death.

==Death==
In January 1965, he underwent a series of X-rays for an infection on the roof of his mouth. He died on 23 February 1965, aged 74, in his apartment, four days following a heart attack. Minutes before his death, he told his nurse that he would not mind going skiing, and she replied that she was not aware that he was a skier. &quot;I&#x27;m not,&quot; said Laurel, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be doing that than getting all these needles stuck in me!&quot; A few minutes later he died quietly in his armchair.

At his funeral service at Church of the Hills, Buster Keaton said, &quot;Chaplin wasn&#x27;t the funniest. I wasn&#x27;t the funniest; this man was the funniest.&quot; Dick Van Dyke gave the eulogy as a friend, protégé and occasional impressionist of Laurel during his later years; he read The Clown&#x27;s Prayer. Laurel had quipped, &quot;If anyone at my funeral has a long face, I&#x27;ll never speak to him again.&quot; He is interred at Forest Lawn–Hollywood Hills Cemetery.

==Legacy and honours==
Laurel and Hardy are featured on the cover of the Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. In 1989, a statue of Laurel was erected in Dockwray Square, North Shields, Tyne and Wear, England, where he lived at No. 8 from 1897 to 1902. The steps down from the Square to the North Shields Fish Quay were said to have inspired the piano-moving scene in &quot;The Music Box&quot;. In a 2005 UK poll, &quot;Comedians&#x27; Comedian&quot;, Laurel and Hardy were ranked top double act and seventh overall. Along with Hardy, Laurel was inducted into the Grand Order of Water Rats.

Neil Brand wrote a radio play entitled &quot;Stan&quot;, broadcast in 2004 on BBC Radio 4 and subsequently on BBC Radio 4 Extra, starring Tom Courtenay as Stan Laurel, in which Stan visits Oliver Hardy after Hardy has had his stroke and tries to say the things to his dying friend and partner that have been left unsaid. In 2006, BBC Four showed a drama called &quot;Stan&quot;, based on Brand&#x27;s radio play, in which Laurel meets Hardy on his deathbed and reminisces about their career.

A plaque on the Bull Inn, Bottesford, Leicestershire, England, marks Laurel and Hardy appearing in Nottingham over Easter 1952 and Christmas 1953, and staying with Laurel&#x27;s sister, Olga, who was the landlady of the pub. In 2008, a statue of Stan Laurel was unveiled in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, on the site of the Eden Theatre. In April 2009, a bronze statue of Laurel and Hardy was unveiled in Ulverston.

There is a Laurel and Hardy Museum in Stan&#x27;s hometown of Ulverston. There are two Laurel and Hardy museums in Hardy&#x27;s hometown of Harlem, Georgia. One is operated by the town of Harlem, and the other is a private museum owned and operated by Gary Russeth, a Harlem resident. Jefferson Drive in Ulverston is named after Laurel.

In 2013 Gail Louw and Jeffrey Holland debuted a short one-man play &quot;...And this is my friend Mr Laurel&quot; at the Camden Fringe festival. The play, starring Holland as Laurel, was taken on tour of the UK in 2014 until June 2015.

In the 2018 film &quot;Stan &amp; Ollie&quot;, Steve Coogan portrayed Laurel (a performance which saw him nominated for the BAFTA for Best Actor in a Leading Role) and John C. Reilly played Hardy. Developed by BBC Films, the film is set in the twilight of their careers, and focuses on their farewell tour of Britain and Ireland&#x27;s variety halls in 1953.

In 2019 Laurel was voted the greatest ever British comedian by a panel on the British television channel Gold.

<text>Pinggu District (), formerly Pinggu County (), lies in the far east of Beijing Municipality. It has an area of and a population of 457,313 (2020 Census). The district is subdivided into 2 subdistricts, 14 towns, and 2 townships. It borders the Beijing districts of Miyun and Shunyi to the north and west, respectively, Tianjin&#x27;s Jizhou District to the southeast, and in Hebei province, Xinglong County and Sanhe to the northeast and south, respectively.

==Administrative divisions==
There are 2 subdistricts, 14 towns with 4 towns of which carry the &quot;area&quot; () label, and 2 townships in the district:

==Climate==
Pinggu District has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dwa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Pinggu is . The average annual rainfall is with July as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in July, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

==History==
Pinggu District was formerly Pinggu County until 2001. The 10,000-capacity Pinggu Stadium was opened in 1986.

==Economy==

Pinggu district prides itself on the cultivation of the peach.

In 2009, it represented a growing area of over 6,000 hectares and an annual output of 270 million kilograms of more than 200 varieties of peaches in four major categories. Providing employment for over 150,000 people, Pinggu peaches are also an important source of economic growth for the people in the region. Peaches originated in China and have been cultivated there for thousands of years. The peach tree has special significance in Chinese culture, with it being considered to be the “tree of life,” and peaches are recognized as symbols of immortality and unity. What sets Pinggu peaches apart from those cultivated in other regions are their beautiful colors, high sugar content, unique flavor and large size. These characteristics are a direct result of the unique geographical properties of Pinggu. With mountains on three sides and plains at its center, Pinggu’s fresh air, low pollution, sandy soil, plentiful water supply and the marked difference between day and night temperatures make for ideal peach growing conditions. By 2005 orchard owners were exporting them to over twenty provinces in China as well as foreign markets such as Brunei, the European Union, Russia Singapore and Thailand.

To register a Geographical Indication for Pinggu peaches, orchard owners and the Pinggu government formed the Pinggu County Production and Distribution Service Center of Agricultural Products (PDSCAP). This alliance resulted in the Pinggu peach being the first agricultural product to have its GI registered in China in 2002.

==Transportation==
The planned Pinggu line will connect the District to the Beijing Subway system.

<doc id="897315" wikidata="Q271570" url="?curid=897315" title="Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia">
<text>The Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia (; ), sometimes referred to as Kingdom of New France (), was an unrecognized state declared by two ordinances on November 17, 1860 and November 20, 1860 from Antoine de Tounens, a French lawyer and adventurer, who claimed that the regions of Araucanía and eastern Patagonia did not depend on any other states and proclaimed himself king of Araucanía and Patagonia. He had the support of some Mapuche lonkos around a small area in Araucanía, who thought they could help maintain independence from the Chilean and Argentine governments.

Arrested on January 5, 1862 by the Chilean authorities, Antoine de Tounens was imprisoned and declared insane on September 2, 1862 by the court of Santiago and expelled to France on October 28, 1862. He later tried three times to return to Araucanía to reclaim his kingdom without success.

==History==


In 1858, Antoine de Tounens, a former lawyer in Périgueux, France, who had read the book &quot;La Araucana&quot; by Alonso de Ercilla, decided to go to Araucanía, inspired to become its king after reading the book. He landed at the port of Coquimbo in Chile and met some loncos (Mapuche tribal leaders) after arriving South to the Biobío. He promised them some arms and the help of France to maintain their independence from Chile. The Indians elected him Great Toqui, Supreme Chieftain of the Mapuches, possibly in the belief that their cause might be better served with a European acting on their behalf.

On November 17, 1860, and November 20, 1860, the self-proclaimed sovereign proclaimed via two decrees that the regions of Araucanía and eastern Patagonia did not need to depend on any other states and that the Kingdom of Araucanía is founded with himself as monarch under the name King Orélie-Antoine I. He declared Perquenco capital of his kingdom, created a flag, and had coins minted for the nation under the name of &quot;Nouvelle France&quot;.

He writes in his Memoirs in 1863 &quot;I took the title of king, by an ordinance of November 17, 1860, which established the bases of the hereditary constitutional government founded by me [...] On November 17, I returned to Araucanía to be publicly recognized as king, which took place on December 25, 26, 27 and 30. Weren&#x27;t we, the Araucanians, free to bestow power on me, and I to accept it?&quot;

The supposed founding of the Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia led to the Occupation of Araucanía by Chilean forces. Chilean president José Joaquín Pérez authorized Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez, commander of the Chilean troops, to arrest Antoine de Tounens on January 5, 1862. Tounens was then imprisoned and declared insane on September 2, 1862, by the court of Santiago and expelled to France on October 28, 1862.

===Attempts to return and fears of French intervention===
In a 1870 meeting of Saavedra with Mapuche lonkos at Toltén, Mapuche chiefs revealed to Saavedra that Antoine de Tounens was once again at Araucanía. Upon hearing that his presence in Araucanía had been revealed Orélie-Antoine de Tounens fled to Argentina, having however promised Quilapán to obtain arms. There are some reports that a shipment of arms seized by Argentine authorities at Buenos Aires in 1871 had been ordered by Orélie-Antoine de Tounens. A French warship, &quot;d&#x27;Entrecasteaux&quot;, that anchored in 1870 at Corral, drew suspicions from Saavedra of some sort of French interference. Accordingly there may have been substance to these fears as information was given to Abdón Cifuentes in 1870 that an intervention in favour of the Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia against Chile was discussed in Napoleon III&#x27;s &quot;Conseil d&#x27;Êtat&quot;.

On August 28, 1873, the Criminal Court of Paris ruled that Antoine de Tounens, first &quot;king of Araucanía and Patagonia&quot;, did not justify his claim to the status of sovereignty. He died in poverty on September 17, 1878, in Tourtoirac, France, after years of fruitlessly struggling to regain his kingdom.

===After de Tounens (1873–present)===
Historians Simon Collier and William F. Sater describe the Kingdom of Araucanía as a &quot;curious and semi-comic episode&quot;. According to travel writer Bruce Chatwin, the later history of the &quot;kingdom&quot; belongs rather to &quot;the obsessions of bourgeois France than to the politics of South America.&quot; A French champagne salesman, Gustave Laviarde, impressed by the story, decided to assume the vacant throne as Aquiles I. He was appointed heir to the throne by Orélie-Antoine. The pretenders to the throne of Araucanía and Patagonia have been called monarchs and sovereigns of fantasy, &quot;having only fanciful claims to a kingdom without legal existence and having no international recognition&quot;. Therefore the &quot;throne of Araucanía&quot; is sometimes the subject of disputes between &quot;pretenders&quot;, some journalists wrote : &quot;The memory of the French adventurer Orélie-Antoine, self-proclaimed king in 1860, and the defense of the rights of the Mapuches guide the action of this strange symbolic monarchy&quot; and &quot;The intensification of the Mapuche conflict in recent years has given a new purpose to the Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia, long considered an absurdity by French society.&quot;

Mapuche writer Pedro Cayuqueo considers the kingdom a lost opportunity and speculates that, in a French-ruled Araucanía, the Mapuche would have rights similar to that of the Kanak people, who were given the possibility of independence from France in a 2018 referendum.

== Pretenders to the throne after Antoine de Tounens ==
Antoine de Tounens had no children, but since his death in 1878, some French citizens without any familial relations to him declared to be pretenders to the &quot;throne of Araucanía and Patagonia&quot;. Whether the Mapuche themselves accept this or are even aware of it, is unclear.

== Flag ==
Sources are unclear on what flag, if any, Tounens used, as his &quot;government&quot; was never formalized. Some sources say a green-blue-white flag was used, and other sources say a blue-white-green. The green-blue-white variant of the flag was probably only hoisted by Orélie in Araucanía for a few weeks. The blue-white-green version was designed by Orélie in exile in France, and is still used by pretenders to the throne after his death.

<text>Roland C. Wagner (6 September 1960 – 5 August 2012) was a French writer of humorous science fiction. Since his professional debut in 1981, he had written around one hundred novellas and around fifty novels. He was the only writer to have received the Prix Rosny-Aîné seven times, as well as many other awards.

== Biography ==
Roland Wagner was born in Bab El Oued, Algeria during the Algerian War of Independence. After the war, his family left Algeria like many &quot;Pieds-Noirs&quot; and settled in Clamart. Throughout his youth, Wagner was an avid reader of &quot;Fleuve Noir Anticipation&quot; and other science-fiction stories. He began writing his own stories at age 15. In 1981, he won the Prix Rosny-Aîné for his short story &quot;Faire-part&quot;. He was killed in an automobile accident on 5 August 2012.

== Major works ==

===&quot;Histoire d&#x27;un futur&quot;===
&quot;Les Futurs Mystères de Paris&quot; (&quot;The Future Mysteries of Paris&quot;) features a &quot;transparent&quot; (not exactly invisible) private detective. Starting with &quot;La Balle du néant&quot; (&quot;The Bullet From Nowhere&quot;), this cycle has nine titles (up to &quot;Mine de rien&quot;, 2006) inside a larger set, including &quot;Le Chant du cosmos&quot; (&quot;The Song of the Cosmos&quot;), a far-future tale which describes a mental game inspired by Go.

===&quot;Rêves de Gloire&quot;===
&quot;Rêves de Gloire&quot; (&quot;Dreams of Glory&quot;) is an alternate history of Algeria with several divergence points. One of them is the assassination of Charles de Gaulle before the Évian Accords.

===Other works===
Roland C. Wagner had written under multiple pseudonyms, including Richard Wolfram and Red Deff.

&quot;La Saison de la sorcière&quot; (&quot;Season of the Witch&quot;, 2003) takes place in France with extremely high-level police security, which is invaded by the United States. The novel received the Bob Morane Prize and the Prix Rosny-Aîné in 2004. &quot;Le Temps du voyage&quot; (&quot;Trip Time&quot;, 2005) is a space opera in the mood of Jack Vance.

He had also written an alternate history biography of H. P. Lovecraft under the title &quot;HPL (1890–1991)&quot; which has been translated in English, and several pastiches of famous science fiction authors. For example, his &quot; Three Laws of Robotic Sexuality &quot; parodies Isaac Asimov&#x27;s robot stories.

==Other activities==
===Music===
He also wrote lyrics for rock bands, and is a member of the acid punk group Brain Damage, active since 1977.

== Awards and honors ==
Asteroid 428102 Rolandwagner, discovered by astronomer Bernard Christophe at Saint-Sulpice Observatory in 2006, was named in his memory.
 The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 2 February 2017 ().

<doc id="897321" wikidata="Q310738" url="?curid=897321" title="Cladonia">
<text>Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. &quot;Cladonia&quot; species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species &quot;Cladonia stellaris&quot; is used in flower decorations.

Although the phylogeny of the genus &quot;Cladonia&quot; is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the &quot;Cladonia&quot; morpho-type and the &quot;Cladina&quot; morpho-type. The &quot;Cladonia&quot; morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The &quot;Cladina&quot; morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage).

&quot;Cladonia perforata&quot; (&quot;perforate cladonia&quot;) is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida.

Several &quot;Cladonia&quot; species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of &quot;Cladonia&quot; species is one of the defining characters of grey dune, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive.

&quot;Cladonia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Chionodes continuella&quot;.

<doc id="897324" wikidata="Q289571" url="?curid=897324" title="Alice Walton">
<text>Alice Louise Walton (born October 7, 1949) is an American heiress to the fortune of Walmart as daughter of founder Sam Walton. In September 2016, she owned over $11 billion in Walmart shares. As of February 2025, Walton has a net worth of $121 billion, making her the 13th richest person and the richest woman in the world according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after Françoise Bettencourt Meyers.

==Early life and education==
Walton was born in Newport, Arkansas. She was raised along with her three brothers in Bentonville, Arkansas, and graduated from Bentonville High School in 1966. She graduated from Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, with a B.A. in economics.

==Career==

Early in her career, Walton was an equity analyst and money manager for First Commerce Corporation and headed investment activities at Arvest Bank Group. She was also a broker for EF Hutton. In 1988, Walton founded Llama Company, an investment bank, where she was president, chairwoman, and CEO.

Walton was the first person to chair the Northwest Arkansas Council and played a major role in the development of the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport, which opened in 1998. At the time, the business and civic leaders of Northwest Arkansas Council found a need for the $109 million regional airport in their corner of the state. Walton provided $15 million in initial funding for construction, and Llama Company underwrote a $79.5 million bond. The Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport Authority recognized Walton&#x27;s contributions to the creation of the airport and named the terminal the Alice L. Walton Terminal Building. She was inducted into the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame in 2001.

Llama Company closed in 1998. 

In his 1992 autobiography &quot;Made in America,&quot; Sam Walton remarked that Alice was &quot;the most like me—a maverick—but even more volatile than I am.&quot;

==Art==
Walton and her mother would often paint watercolors on camping trips. The first piece of art Walton purchased was a print of Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Blue Nude&quot; when she was ten years old; it cost her 5 weeks allowance. Her first museum quality artwork purchase was of two Winslow Homer watercolors in the late 1980s. 

In December 2004, Walton purchased art sold from the collection of Daniel and Rita Fraad at Sotheby&#x27;s, in New York. In 2005, Walton purchased Asher Brown Durand&#x27;s celebrated painting, &quot;Kindred Spirits&quot;, in a sealed-bid auction for a purported US$35 million. The 1849 painting, a tribute to Hudson River School painter Thomas Cole, had been given to the New York Public Library in 1904 by Julia Bryant, the daughter of Romantic poet and New York newspaper publisher William Cullen Bryant, who is depicted in the painting with Cole. She has also purchased works by American painters Winslow Homer and Edward Hopper, as well as a notable portrait of George Washington by Charles Willson Peale, in preparation for the opening of Crystal Bridges. In 2009, Walton acquired Norman Rockwell&#x27;s &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; for $4.9 million.

Walton&#x27;s attempt to quit smoking inspired her to purchase a painting reminiscent of an earlier painting by John Singer Sargent by Alfred Maurer which depicts a full-length woman smoking. Another painting, by Tom Wesselmann, titled &quot;Smoker #9&quot; depicts a hyper realistic, disembodied hand and mouth smoking a cigarette.

In a 2011 interview, she spoke about acquiring great works by other artists, including Marsden Hartley and Andrew Wyeth, saying that she loved the emotion and spirituality they expressed. Other artists whose work Walton has purchased include Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Mark Rothko, Edward Hopper, Kehinde Wiley, and Titus Kaphar.
Walton&#x27;s interest in art led to the Walton Family Foundation developing the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. The architect Moshe Safdie designed the 200,000 square foot museum, which was built on 120 acres of Walton family land. Crystal Bridges opened in 2011 and has been visited more than 5 million times as of 2021. It is free to attend. Walton says her motivation for the museum was to give access to art to people who had never had it.

==Political contributions==
Alice Walton was the 20th-largest individual contributor to 527 committees in the U.S. presidential election 2004, donating US$2.6 million to the conservative Progress for America group. As of January 2012, Walton had contributed $200,000 to Restore Our Future, the super PAC associated with Mitt Romney&#x27;s presidential campaign. Walton donated $353,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee supporting Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, in 2016.

==Philanthropy==
In 2016, Walton donated $225 million among a total $407 million from Walmart heirs to the Walton Family Holdings Trust, which finances the family&#x27;s philanthropy.

Walton formed the Alice L. Walton Foundation in 2017. The foundation promotes arts, education, health, and improving economic opportunity. In 2020, the foundation gave the University of Central Arkansas $3 million in funding for its fine arts program. That year, the foundation also gave a $1.28 million grant to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to expand its program to provide healthy food in schools. In 2022, Walton&#x27;s foundation gave a $3.5 million grant to the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank: $3 million to support construction of a food distribution center, and $500,000 to buy and distribute food. 

Also in 2017, Walton formed the Art Bridges Foundation. It partners with small and regional museums with less access to cultural resources. The foundation provides funding, collection loans and traveling exhibits, and creates art programs with museums. Walton has said her goal is to reduce the amount of art kept in storage. As of September 2021, the foundation had approximately 30 exhibits traveling throughout the United States. The Arts Bridges Fellows Program provides opportunities for people from historically underrepresented groups to work with its museum partners. Additionally, Walton has given $10 million to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, and partnered with the Ford Foundation through Art Bridges to fund programs to improve diversity in arts leadership. 

===Healthcare===

In 2019, Walton established the Whole Health Institute. The institute works with health systems, employers and communities to build and expand access to holistic healthcare. In March 2021, Walton announced that the institute would build a nonprofit medical school in Bentonville called the Alice L. Walton School of Medicine. The school will focus on allopathic medicine and graduates will receive a doctor of medicine degree. The campus will be located near Crystal Bridges. Construction began in 2023, with the first class enrolling in 2025, pending accreditation. 

In 2021, the Alice L. Walton Foundation partnered with the Cleveland Clinic to evaluate health care in Northwest Arkansas. Following that evaluation, in 2022, the foundation and Washington Regional Medical System announced plans to create a nonprofit medical system aimed at training doctors in specialty care fields such as oncology, cardiology, and neurology.

==Personal life==
Walton married a prominent Louisiana investment banker in 1974 at age 24. They were divorced two and a half years later. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, she married &quot;the contractor who built her swimming pool&quot; soon after, &quot;but they, too, divorced quickly&quot;.

Walton has been involved in multiple automobile accidents, one of them fatal. She lost control of a rented Jeep during a 1983 Thanksgiving family reunion near Acapulco and plunged into a ravine, shattering her leg. She was airlifted out of Mexico and underwent more than two dozen surgeries; she suffers lingering pain from her injuries. In April 1989, she struck and killed 50-year-old Oleta Hardin, who had stepped onto a road in Fayetteville, Arkansas. No charges were filed. In 1998, she hit a gas meter while driving under the influence of alcohol. She paid a $925 fine.

In 1998, Walton moved to a ranch in Millsap, Texas, named Walton&#x27;s Rocking W Ranch. An avid horse-lover, she was known for having an eye for determining which 2-month-olds would grow to be champion cutters. Walton listed the farm for sale in 2015 and moved to Fort Worth, Texas, citing the need to focus on the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. She moved back to Bentonville in 2020.
