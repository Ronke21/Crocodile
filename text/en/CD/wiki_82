<text>A geopark is a protected area with internationally significant geology within which sustainable development is sought and which includes tourism, conservation, education and research concerning not just geology but other relevant sciences.

In 2005, a European Geopark was defined as being:
&quot;a territory with a particular geological heritage and with a sustainable territorial development...the ultimate aim of a European Geopark is to bring enhanced employment opportunities for the people who live there.&quot;

Today the geopark is virtually synonymous with the UNESCO geopark, which is defined and managed under the voluntary authority of UNESCO&#x27;s International Geoscience and Geoparks Programme (IGGP). UNESCO provides a standard for geoparks and a certification service to territories that apply for it. The service is available to member states of UNESCO. 

The list of members is not the same as the member states of the United Nations. Membership in the UN does not automatically imply membership of UNESCO, even though UNESCO is part of the UN. Both lists have about 193 member nations, but not exactly the same 193. The UN list covers most of the geopolitical world, but the UNESCO list lacks Israel, for example, which resigned in 2018 because they believed UNESCO is anti-Israel.

The UNESCO Global Geoparks Network co-ordinates the activities of the many UNESCO Global Geoparks (UGGp&#x27;s) around the world. It is divided into regional networks, such as the European Geoparks Network. The EGN historically preceded the UGGN, being founded in 2000 with the first four geoparks. It joined with UNESCO in 2001 and in 2005 agreed in the Madonie Declaration to be a regional network of the UGGps, which had been created by UNESCO in 2004.

The Madonie Declaration of 2004, which was signed by Nikolas Zouros for the EGN and Wolfgang Eder for UNESCO, established what was later called a &quot;bottom up&quot; system of precedence. An applicant geopark must first be a member of the EGN before applying to the UGGN. Furthermore, another level was created, the National Geoparks Network, which at first glance seems a contradiction in terms. Geoparks are international. What the Declaration meant was, if a potentially international type of site (a possible geosite) existed within the candidate park&#x27;s country, the park must belong to it before it can apply to the regional network. This type was dubbed an NGN. Its sites could then be included under the geopark umbrella by being candidates for the international network. In 2014 the creation of other regions besides the EGN was allowed and encouraged, permitting geoparks to fulfill their declared global nature.

==Etymology and usage of geopark==
Ge- or geo- is a word-formative prefix derived from the ancient Greek word for &quot;Earth.&quot; Due to the use of ancient Greek and Latin words to form international scientific vocabulary, geo- might appear in any modern language of any type by the process of compounding. Since geo- is well known in most modern languages it is especially amenable to word production, the impromptu manufacture of words of self-evident meaning. Geopark and all its associated new geo- words began as produced neologisms but are fast becoming legitimate scientific compounds.

Produced words are often open to interpretation: they mean whatever the writer intended them to mean or whatever the reader interpreted them to mean. Eventually the word receives a common understanding that can be dictionary-defined. &quot;Geopark&quot; is right at that point. Henriques and Brilha, after listing four interpretations not to be allowed now, cite features that must be present in the application of &quot;geopark:&quot; a development plan, a geoheritage, conservation, and sustainability. These are features that must receive the credibility of the international organizations certifying the park as a geopark, without which certification they cannot be scientific geoparks. The overall qualification, therefore, is that they must be certified as geoparks by the accepted international organizations. No certification, no geopark.

The innovation of geo-compounds is neither new or recent, the most ancient perhaps being the geo-metria, &quot;earth measurement,&quot; of ancient Greece. There have been a smattering of &quot;Earth&quot; words ever since. Geo-logia is a relative newcomer, in mediaeval Latin &quot;the study of earthly things&quot; (such as law) in contrast to divine things. It was preempted to refer to the 18th century topics of fossils and rock stratification. Most geo-compounds come from the 19th and early 20th century. Geo- means &quot;Earth&quot; rather than &quot;geological,&quot; which would be redundant. 

After a floruit of international exploration, scientific research, and park-building in the later 19th century, the world wars represent a sharp decline of conservation and tourism, as the goals of war are opposite those of peace. Even the League of Nations, predecessor of the United Nations, did not unite. The last world war saw the irrecoverable destruction of national heritages and the terrible misuse of science. The United Nations and its and educational, scientific, and cultural branch, UNESCO, heir to the League&#x27;s International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, both founded in 1945 to do a better job at peace-keeping and cooperation, were at first hindered by the Cold War. As it manifestly drew to an end in the 1970&#x27;s, and the countries of east Europe would be open once more, UNESCO began to be more effective, formulating organizations to respond to a growing demand for the protection of the heritage that was left.

The current round of innovation to which geo-park belongs dates to the last decades of the 20th century and the first of the 21st, although it may not be over yet. They began as marketing terms in the vending of what Farsani calls &quot;sustainable tourism,&quot; characterizing it as &quot;a new niche market,&quot; the key words being, in addition to geopark, geotourism, geoheritage, geosite, geoconservation, and geodiversity. It is not possible to discover what individuals first innovated the words. Authors such as Farsani can only state the groups among which they were thought to be first current.

The term “geopark” was apparently first used to describe a newly instituted park in the west Vulkaneifel district of the Eifel Mountains of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. The region had tended to be economically depressed due to the preference of buyers and sellers for markets in nearby France. They did have a noted geological asset: a now dormant forested volcanic range. The land shows evidence of ancient volcanos, including crater lakes, mineral springs, and pipe formations. The place also abounds in fossils. Although of interest to scientists and hikers, the terrain was generally regarded as a liability, some 19th-century plans even having been made to fill lakes.
==Types of geopark==
The word geopark is no longer open to the process of innovation through word production. It has been defined by various organizations in the field of earth science. An essential element of the definition is that a geopark must be branded as part of an international geopark network. A national park is not necessarily a geopark. For example, the United States has a system of national parks, but none of them are geoparks. Canada, on the other hand, has several.

A geopark network requires the branding of an international scientific association. They only brand protected areas that meet certain standards, as presented above. The branding has no effect on the previous status of an area. It might already have been other types of park, such as a national park. If the geopark branding is removed, it is still those other types of park. No matter what the type, management, the exercise of authority over the area, is always national; the scientific organizations have no sovereignty; they are simply advisory and certifying agencies guided by decisions made at international conventions.

===National geoparks===
A &quot;national geopark&quot; is a post de facto designation by UNESCO of a &quot;geographical area&quot; or a transnational geographical area already known to be &quot;of international, regional, and/or national importance&quot; as a candidate geopark. It has not yet been certified as belonging to a regional or the global UNESCO geopark network. It has been &quot;already inscribed&quot; as a member of some other network; that is, &quot;national geopark&quot; is a sort of floating candidacy that can be attached to any other parkland of interest, after which attachment the parkland qualifies for the designation of geopark. The candidates so designated are termed a &quot;national network for geoparks.&quot; If it exists in a member nation all geoparks of the regional network in that nation as well as the global network must also belong to it.

Some of the networks from which UNESCO national geoparks might be chosen are World Heritage Sites, Agenda 21, Man and the Biosphere Programme. UNESCO also provides a list of recommended geosite types, such as &quot;minerals and mineral resources,&quot; &quot;fossils,&quot; etc.

The national networks (one for each nation) are intended as the bottom level of the bottom-up system. They support national conservation, education, cultural development, research, as well as economic sustainability. There is some effort to control conflict of mandate; for example, Fossils are not allowed to be sold, which practice would favor sustainability, but work against conservation. For some geoparks, such as Sitia geopark (east Crete), the conflict between geotourist development and the conservation of archaeological sites is a severe one, reaching the law courts. As with the other levels of geopark, the parks are subject to review for recertification every four years.
===Transnational geoparks===
A transnational geopark crosses a national border to extend continuously in two member nations. The park must belong to two national geoparks, one in each nation, and one regional geopark. Both national geoparks collaborate to prepare a single application, which is submitted by both to the regional and global networks. Both member nations must endorse the park. The management bodies in each nation must collaborate to establish a single set of activities and strategies for the entire park. They can appoint either two collaborating managements or one management.

The certified transnational geoparks are:

* Geopark Karawanken
* Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark
* Novohrad – Nógrád Geopark
* Muscau Arch / Łuk Mużakowa UNESCO Global Geopark

===Regional geoparks===
A regional geopark is a member of an independent network of geoparks that has agreed with UNESCO to provide candidates for the global network. All members of the regional network are a priori members of a national geopark network. They are also members of the global network if they are certified for it. A regional geopark would not be a global geopark if it has not yet been certified as such or its certification has lapsed and it has applied for recertification (Yellow Card status).

A region is more than one country. A current list of accepted regions is:
*African Geoparks Network
*Asia Pacific Geoparks Network (APGN)
*European Geoparks Network (EGN)
*Latin America and the Caribbean Geoparks Network (LACGN)

===Acting regional geopark===
Canada has some geoparks. The most logical regional classification for these might have been the &quot;North American Regional Geopark Network,&quot; following a proposed continental tradition for geopark regions. However, the United States does not have any geoparks, and Mexico is covered under Latin America. There are no other nations in North America that can be combined into a region. The United States and Israel resigned from UNESCO in 2018 because they believed that UNESCO is anti-Israel, though the US re-joined in 2023.

Canadian geoparks according to the rules must belong to a regional network before they can apply for global status, but there is none, and may not be any in the foreseeable future. UNESCO therefore treating Canada as a special case allows the national geoparks network, the Canadian Geoparks Network, to give global and green card certification. A regionalization based strictly on continents did not turn out to be practical for other regions also.
===UNESCO Global Geoparks===

A global geopark is one that has been certified to the fullest extent, and is therefore a member of UNESCO&#x27;s global network of geoparks. It is per se also a member of a regional geopark network and also a member of a national geopark network, if its nation has one, or a transnational geopark. A certification is good for four years, after which it must be certified again. In the language of certification, a recertified global geopark is termed a &quot;green-card geopark.&quot; If a geopark fails recertification it is given two years to pass, in which it is a &quot;yellow-card geopark.&quot; After two years if it is still unrecertified it is a &quot;red-card geopark;&quot; that is, no longer a geopark, and is removed from connection with or concern by UNESCO. To reapply, it must start the application over. Recertified geoparks do not have to keep the same borders; only a portion may be recertified.

* Sophie I, the first female ruler in the HOI4 mod, &quot;Pax Britannica.&quot;

=== Australia ===
Queen of Oz
* Princess Georgiana of the fictional British royal family, played by Catherine Tate, becomes the monarch after her mother unexpectedly abdicates the Australian throne in favour of her scandalous daughter, hoping to send her as far away from London as possible and make her someone else&#x27;s problem. The series also features her brother Prince Frederick, the heir apparent to the British throne.

===Austria-Hungary===
Hearts of Iron IV
* Otto I
** CharIes I&#x27;s son and successor in the HOI4 mod, &quot;Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg&quot;.
&quot;The Illusionist&quot;

&quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
* Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein – The Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and the hereditary King of Bohemia, he approaches Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson about the retrieval of letters and photographs confirming a liaison with Irene Adler in order to secure his engagement to Clotilde Lothma Von Saxe-Meiningen, a young Scandinavian princess. (The story fictionally assumes that Bohemia was ruled by its own Kings, rather than the actual situation of its being part of the domains of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor). There is also mentioned a &quot;King of Scandinavia&quot;, a title which never existed in reality as the Scandinavian countries never united into a single realm, though Sweden and Norway were in personal union when the story was written.

==B==

===Brazil===
Hearts of Iron IV

* Pedro III, the emperor of Brazil in the HOI4 mod, &quot;Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg&quot;, if the monarchy is restored.

Books by Harry Turtledove
* Dom Pedro IV: In the &quot;Southern Victory&quot; series, he is the Emperor of Brazil during the First Great War, leading the country into war on the side of Central Powers, cutting off supply lines between the Allied countries of Argentina and Britain and hastening the end of the war. Pedro IV&#x27;s lineage and the status of slavery in Brazil are not addressed, whilst the continued existence of the Brazilian Empire may be an indirect consequence of Confederate independence.
* In &quot;Curious Notions&quot; of the &quot;Crosstime Traffic&quot; series, Imperial Germany is victorious in the 20th century&#x27;s three world wars, becoming the dominant world power by 2096. This results in Germany restoring the monarchies of numerous countries including Brazil. The unnamed Emperor of Brazil is among the numerous monarchs who attend the Kaiser in Berlin in a glittering annual ceremony broadcast live worldwide.

===Bulgaria===
Hearts of Iron IV

* Kyril I, the Tsar of Bulgaria in the HOI4 mod, &quot;Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg&quot;, if the Legion choose to restore the monarchy.
* Nikolay II, a Georgian noble in the HOI4 mod, &quot;Pax Britannica&quot;.

&quot;In the Presence of Mine Enemies&quot; by Harry Turtledove
* During Horst Witzleben&#x27;s &quot;Seven O’Clock News&quot;, an unnamed Tsar of Bulgaria is reported as welcoming the Poglavnik of Croatia during a state visit.

The United States is incorporated into Canada and is renamed &#x27;Lower Manitoba&#x27;.

=== China and the Greater Chinese Empire ===
Curse of the Golden Flower

Wells&#x27;s War of The Worlds land in Qing China, destroy Beijing and cause widespread death and destruction throughout the country, but the Guangxu Emperor survives by fleeing to a faraway province. In the aftermath the Emperor – whose plans for reform were foiled in actual history – takes advantage of the chaos to stage a bloody coup and establish himself strongly in power. He then the uses the disarray of European powers, still recovering from the Martian invasion of their home territories, to shake off colonial tutlelage and make China a world power 50 years ahead of schedule. China in this history will remain a monarchy, there will be no Chinese Republic nor a Communist Chinese regime, and there will be many more new Emperors from among the progeny of the Guangxu Emperor.

==F==

===Finland===
Hearts of Iron IV
* King Fredrik Kaarle I
** In the HOI4 mod, &quot;Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg&quot;, he rules the Kingdom of Finland and has significant power compared to other monarchs in the nearby regions.
* King Väinö I
** Frederick Charles&#x27;s son and successor in the same mod.
King Ralph
* King Gustav (portrayed by Julian Glover)
** He and the Finnish royal family visit the United Kingdom shortly after King Ralph I&#x27;s accession to the British throne. The purpose of the visit is to arrange a royal marriage between Ralph and Princess Anna of Finland and to negotiate the purchasing of off-shore drilling equipment following the discovery of oil reserves in the Baltic Sea. The arranged marriage is called off after King Gustav is given photographs showing Ralph with Miranda, an exotic dancer.

===France===
&quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot; by Ward Moore
* Napoleon VI
** He is mentioned as the Emperor of France reigning sometime around the 1930s with his scandalous personal life being gossiped about in American publications.
Hearts of Iron IV
* Jean III 
** The king of France in the HOI4 mod &quot;Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg&quot; if Action Française takes power&quot;.&quot;
* Henry VI
** Jean III&#x27;s son and successor in the same mod.
*Franz I
**A German nobleman who can be put on the French throne in the HOI4 mod, &quot;Pax Britannica&quot;.
Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers
* Minnie Mouse portrays the role of a princess (apparently the daughter of King Louis XIII and Queen Anne, which would make her a female equivalent of Louis XIV) who rules the Kingdom of France but is a victim of being overthrown by the villainous Pete (see princess and dragon). In real-life such an ascension would be contrary to Salic Law.
Monty Python’s Flying Circus
* In the episode &quot;The Golden Age of Ballooning&quot;, a Scottish conman (played by Michael Palin) poses as the French monarch, claiming to be Louis XIV, Louis XV, Louis XVI and Louis XVII.
&quot;The Peshawar Lancers&quot; by S. M. Stirling
* Napoleon VI is mentioned as the Emperor of France-outre-mer in an alternate 2025 where, in 1878, a meteor shower known as &#x27;The Fall&#x27; rendered the Northern Hemisphere uninhabitable, forcing European metropolitan governments to evacuate to their colonies. France-outre-mer encompasses French North Africa and reclaimed French, Spanish and Portuguese coastal territories, with its capital based in Algiers. King-Emperor John II arranges the marriage of his daughter Sita to the heir to the throne of France-outre-mer, partly to establish an Anglo-French condominium over the Sultanate of Egypt and re-open the Suez Canal. Although the regnal name was claimed by Louis, Prince Napoléon, if he is based on a real person, the date would indicate this is either Charles, Prince Napoléon or Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon.
&quot;The Short Reign of Pippin IV&quot; by John Steinbeck
* Pippin Arnulf Héristal, a descendant of Charlemagne, is crowned as Pippin IV to provoke a rebellion.
&quot;Southern Victory Series&quot; by Harry Turtledove
* Charles XI
** After France&#x27;s defeat during the First Great War, he becomes King of France between the late 1920s and 1930 after Action Française takes control of the country, ending the French Third Republic, and restores the monarchy. He serves as the King of France for fourteen years and leads his country into another war with the German Empire after the new Kaiser Wilhelm III refuses to return Alsace-Lorraine to France. He is later killed in 1944 when Germany destroys most of Paris with an atomic bomb. 
** He might be a fictional son of the Orléanist pretender Prince Philippe, Duke of Orléans who was a claimant to the French throne as Philip VIII or the Legitimist (and Carlist) pretender Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, who used Charles XII as a claimed regnal name due to counting his brother as the real Charles XI (compare Louis XVII, who also never reigned). Turtledove clarified that Charles XI was not Charles Maurras, the founder and leader of Action Française.
* Louis XIX
** Following Charles XI&#x27;s death, he is succeeded by Louis XIX. While he initially announced France&#x27;s intention to continue to fight Germany, he ultimately accepts capitulation. There is no equivalent son of Alfonso Carlos or grandson of Prince Philippe, who both died childless.

* Umberto III – In the alternate 2010 depicted in &quot;In the Presence of Mine Enemies&quot;, Italy (like Spain and Portugal) is an ally of the Greater German Reich and possesses its own empire but is compelled to carry out racial policies such as the extermination of Arabs in its territories. The Italian King is a figurehead but does hold influence in domestic politics. Possibly a version of Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, Prince of Venice, where the naming of his father and grandfather after their grandfathers continued and established something similar to Denmark&#x27;s swapping between Fredericks and Christians.
* Cosimo III – In the alternate timeline depicted in &quot;Through Darkest Europe&quot;, due to the adoption by Thomas Aquinas and Al-Ghazali of opposite positions regarding the compatibility of reason and religion than in real-life, Islamic North Africa and the Middle East are the &quot;liberal, tolerant, and above all rich&quot; First World whilst Christian Europe is an impoverished hotspot of Christian fundamentalist terrorism.

Eventually, the rival Lietuvan Empire developed to its north and east (roughly similar to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). The two evenly matched empires were in permanent cold war, sometimes turning hot. One such occasion was when King Kuzmickas of Lietuva mobilised his army and tried to conquer the city of Polisso, capital of the Roman province of Dacia. He placed the city under siege and came very close to capturing it, but in the end had to withdraw. The ceasefire was worked out by a young Roman emissary Ieremeo Soltero whose eloquence impressed the king.

He has been told by Masikura the panther chameleon that he would get eaten by the foosa, although the prophecy did not say that all of him would be bit. So he left his island and abdicated the throne in favor of his nephew, who became King Julien XIII of Madagascar. However, the original King Julien became devious as he returned to the island and tried to reclaim the throne from his nephew. In the end, he decided to give up his evil plans and start a new and better life.
* King Julien XIII

* Agustin IV, the emperor of Mexico in the HOI4 mod, &quot;Pax Britannica&quot;.

&quot;Southern Victory Series&quot; by Harry Turtledove
* Maximilian I
** With the War of Secession ending in a Confederate victory in 1862, France and Napoleon III is able to concentrate on intervention in Mexico, winning the war and installing Maximilian I to the throne shortly afterwards. He would serve as the Emperor of Mexico until at least 1880 and his dynasty he founded there would remain in power through the Second Great War, relying on France and the Confederacy for protection from the wrath of the United States. Maximilian&#x27;s installation was a violation of the Monroe Doctrine. The French and Confederates prevented the U.S. from enforcing the doctrine, thus effectively shooting it between the eyes.
* Maximilian II
** He had served as the Emperor of Mexico since at least 1880. He maintained the close ties between his country and France. In 1881, with his nation desperate for money, Maximilian decided to sell the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora to the Confederate States, which would cause the Second Mexican War with the United States. Maximilian I has no real-life equivalent since his marriage to Charlotte of Belgium was childless by the time of his death. He had adopted Agustín and Salvador Iturbide.
* Francisco José I
** He served as the Emperor of Mexico after Maximilian II. During his reign as emperor, he saw Mexico entering the Great War on the side of the Entente Powers with the Confederate States, the United Kingdom, France, and Russia.
* Maximilian III
** He served as the Emperor of Mexico after Francisco Jose I. During his reign as emperor during the late 1910s and early 1920s, anti-Habsburg revolutionaries sought to remove him from the throne and sparked the Mexican Civil War in 1917. He served as the emperor until at least 1942 and saw the beginning of the Second Great War and Mexico join the Entente Powers once again.
* Francisco José II
** He served as the Emperor of Mexico after Maximilian III and was the emperor during the Second Great War. He reluctantly supplied troops to the Confederacy, who were used to both help attack the United States and later defend the Confederacy from US counter-attacks.
** After U.S. General Irving Morrell&#x27;s major breakthrough at Pittsburgh came at the expense of poorly-equipped Mexican troops, Francisco Jose II refused to allow his men to participate in any more major battles against the United States. This would result in Mexico losing the Baja California peninsula to the United States. Confederate President Jake Featherston, after unsuccessfully attempting to change the Emperor&#x27;s mind, finally acquiesced. Mexican troops were instead used to battle the black guerrilla fighters in the southern part of the Confederacy. Francisco José II was one of the few leaders of a Great Powers nation not forced to resign or abdicate after the alliance&#x27;s defeat in the Second Great War.

Though initially displeased with Kemi since he suspects her brother stole money from him, Moe befriends her and takes her on a journey across Springfield when Homer is arrested by Chief Wiggum shortly after her disappearance. However, Homer gets angry when he finds that Moe has taken his job to guide the princess. And when Kemi kisses Moe, the paparazzo takes a picture which is quickly viewed on the internet by the Nigerian King, leading him to decide not to sign the uranium deal with Burns.

* Nicholas II
** In 1914, when Austria-Hungary issued a number of ultimata to Serbia following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand by a Serb in Sarajevo, Nicholas II promised to support the Serbs should they refuse the ultimata. They did, and Russia declared war on Austria-Hungary, which had declared war on Serbia. The Great War followed. In 1917, Nicholas found himself facing a Red Revolution, followed by a protracted civil war, which resulted in Russia backing out of the Great War. Ultimately, Nicholas and his supporters triumphed, and Nicholas remained emperor for the remainder of the 1920s and died in the early 1930s. The destruction resulting from the wars left Russia in such a poor state that in 1929 she was forced to suspend payment of a loan to Austria-Hungary. This caused a chain effect that led in turn to the worldwide stock market crash of that year. Following his death, Nicholas was succeeded as Tsar by his younger brother, Michael II.

In February 1746, his father arrived in London to officially take the throne. In 1752, he granted clemency to the Hanoverian rebels. By 1926, the House of Hanover&#x27;s usurpation of the throne was viewed as &quot;an interlude in the national life, but it was one that will not have been without its purpose if it is regarded as a lesson upon the consequences of rebellion.&quot;

Charles III allied himself with Frederick II of Prussia and, together, they &quot;towered over the other rulers of Europe like colossi&quot; from 1766 until Frederick&#x27;s death in 1786. During his reign, the colonies in British North America rebelled against Great Britain but a diplomatic solution was reached.

&quot;Infinite Worlds&quot;
* William III of England (in the 12th rather than the 17th Century)

William survived the voyage and eventually assumed the throne – becoming known as King William III of England. Neither the Empress Matilda nor Stephen of Blois had any claim on the throne.

&quot;The Moon Maid&quot; and &quot;Moon Men&quot; by Edgar Rice Burroughs

Published in the early 1920s, &quot;The Moon Maid&quot; and &quot;The Moon Men&quot; envisioned a twentieth century in which &quot;The Great War&quot; would have gone on uninterrupted, though with varying intensity, from 1914 and until 1967 – ending with the total victory of the Anglo-Saxon Powers, Britain and the US, and the complete defeat and surrender of all other powers. Britain and the US thereupon become co-rulers of the planet, London and Washington being the twin planetary capitals and the US President and British Monarch acting as co-rulers, and with the British-American domination of the world imposed by the International Peace Fleet, made up of airships. In the first decades of the 21st century, the world basks in peace, there seems no enemy and no threat anywhere, and pressure grows for complete disarmament and scrapping of the International Peace Fleet. It is the (unnamed) King of Britain who strongly resists this pressure, and due to him half of the Fleet and of the world&#x27;s armament industries are retained. This is not enough to resist the invasion fleet of the wild Kalkars from the Moon, led by the renegade Earthman Orthis, which suddenly descends on the world in 2050, capturing London and Washington and ranging the world at will. But by the British King&#x27;s foresight there was still a remnant of the Fleet in existence, which kills the renegade Orthis – facilitating humanity&#x27;s eventual liberation from Kalkar domination, though only centuries later.

<doc id="898166" wikidata="Q189869" url="?curid=898166" title="Benito Pérez Galdós">
<text>Benito María de los Dolores Pérez Galdós (; 10 May 1843 – 4 January 1920) was a Spanish realist novelist. He was a leading literary figure in 19th-century Spain, and some scholars consider him second only to Miguel de Cervantes in stature as a Spanish novelist.

Pérez Galdós was a prolific writer, publishing 31 major novels, 46 historical novels in five series, 23 plays, and the equivalent of 20 volumes of shorter fiction, journalism and other writings. He remains popular in Spain, and is considered equal to Dickens, Balzac and Tolstoy. He is less well known in Anglophone countries, but some of his works have now been translated into English. His play &quot;Realidad&quot; (1892) is important in the history of realism in the Spanish theatre. The Pérez Galdós museum in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria features a portrait of the writer by Joaquín Sorolla.

Pérez Galdós was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1912, but his opposition to religious authorities led him to be boycotted by conservative sectors of Spanish society, and traditionalist Catholics, who did not recognize his literary merit.

Galdós was interested in politics, although he did not consider himself a politician. His political beginnings were liberal, and he later embraced republicanism and then socialism, under Pablo Iglesias Posse. Early on he joined the Sagasta Progressive Party and in 1886 became a deputy for Guayama, Puerto Rico. At the beginning of the 20th century he joined the Republican Party and was elected deputy to the Madrid cortes for the Conjunción Republicano Socialista in the legislatures of 1907 and 1910. In 1914 he was elected deputy for Las Palmas.

== Childhood and first years ==
Pérez Galdós was born on 10 May 1843 in Calle Cano in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, in a house that is now the Casa-Museo of Pérez Galdós. He was the tenth and last son of lieutenant colonel Don Sebastián Pérez and Doña Dolores Galdós. He was baptised Benito María de los Dolores at the church of San Francisco de Asís, (es) two days after his birth.

Pérez Galdós studied at San Agustín school, where he was taught by teachers trained in the principles of the enlightenment. In 1862, after completing his secondary studies, he travelled to Tenerife to obtain his certificate in &quot;bachillerato&quot; in arts. That same year he moved to Madrid to start a law degree, which he did not complete.

While at university, Pérez Galdós frequented the Ateneo of Madrid and other gatherings of intellectuals and artists. He became acquainted with life in Madrid and witnessed the political and historical events of the time, which were reflected in his journalistic works and in his early novels, &quot;The Golden Fountain Café&quot; (&quot;La Fontana de oro&quot;) (1870) and &quot;El audaz&quot; (1871).

==Career as a writer==
Pérez Galdós led a comfortable life, living first with two of his sisters and then at the home of his nephew, José Hurtado de Mendoza. He got up at sunrise and wrote regularly until ten o&#x27;clock in the morning, in pencil, because he considered the use of a pen a waste of time. He would then go for walks in Madrid to eavesdrop on other people&#x27;s conversations and to gather details for his novels. He did not drink, but smoked leaf cigars incessantly. In the afternoons he read in Spanish, English or French; he preferred the classics, including Shakespeare, Dickens, Cervantes, Lope de Vega and Euripides. In later years, he began to read Leo Tolstoy. In the evenings he would return to his walks, unless there was a concert, for he adored music. He went to bed early and almost never went to the theater.

According to Ramón Pérez de Ayala, Pérez Galdós dressed casually, using sombre tones to go unnoticed. In winter he would wear a white woollen scarf wrapped around his neck, with a half-smoked cigar in his hand and, when seated, his German shepherd dog beside him. He was in the habit of wearing his hair cropped &quot;al rape&quot; and, apparently, suffered from severe migraines.

By 1865, he was publishing articles in &quot;La Nación&quot; on literature, art, music, and politics. He completed three plays between 1861 and 1867, but none were published at the time. In 1868, Pérez Galdós&#x27; translation of &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot; introduced Dickens&#x27; work to the Spanish public. In 1870, Pérez Galdós was appointed editor of &quot;La Revista de España&quot; and began to express his opinions on a wide range of topics from history and culture, to politics and literature. Between 1867 and 1868, he wrote his first novel, &quot;La Fontana de Oro&quot;, a historical work set in the period 1820–1823. With the help of money from his sister-in-law, it was published privately in 1870. Critical reaction was slow, but this was eventually hailed as the beginning of a new phase in Spanish fiction, and was highly praised for its literary quality as well as for its social and moral purpose.

==&quot;National Episodes&quot;==
Pérez Galdós next developed the outline of a major project, the &quot;Episodios Nacionales&quot;: a series of historical novels outlining the major events in Spanish history starting from the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The Mexican-Spanish writer Max Aub said:

&quot;If all the historical material of those years (19th century) were lost, saving the work of Galdós, it would not matter. There is complete, alive, real life of the nation during the hundred years that covered the author&#x27;s claw. There are, forever, its hundreds and hundreds of historical and imagined characters, as true one as the other (...) Only the greatest in the world, and there are enough fingers to count them, achieved as much. And even more: I would leave him in the novel glory of his time hand in hand with Tolstoy, because, besides giving life to beings forever present, they knew how to bring to light the genius of their homeland through its struggles, glories and misfortunes (...) Galdós has done more for the knowledge of Spain by the Spaniards (...) than all the historians together&quot;.

The first volume was called &quot;Trafalgar&quot; and appeared in 1873. Successive volumes appeared irregularly, until the forty-sixth and final novel, &quot;Cánovas&quot;, was published in 1912. These historical novels sold well, and they remained the basis of Pérez Galdós&#x27; contemporary reputation and income. He used careful research to write these stories, and to achieve balance and wider perspectives, Pérez Galdós often sought out survivors and eyewitnesses to the actual events – such as an old man who had been a cabin boy aboard the ship &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; at Trafalgar, who became the central figure of that book. Pérez Galdós was often critical of the official versions of the events he described, and often ran into problems with the Catholic Church, then a dominant force in Spanish cultural life.

==Other novels==
Literary critic José Montesinos classified Pérez Galdós&#x27; other novels into the following groups:

# The early works from &quot;La Fontana de Oro&quot; up to &quot;La familia de León Roch&quot; (1878). The best known of these is &quot;Doña Perfecta&quot; (1876), which describes the impact made by the arrival of a young radical on a stiflingly clerical town. In &quot;Marianela&quot; (1878) a young man regains his eyesight after a life of blindness and rejects his best friend Marianela for her ugliness.
# The novelas españolas contemporáneas, from &quot;La desheredada&quot; (1881) to &quot;Angel Guerra&quot; (1891), a loosely related series of 22 novels which are the author&#x27;s major claim to literary distinction, including his masterpiece &quot;Fortunata y Jacinta&quot; (1886–87). They are bound together by the device of recurring characters, borrowed from Balzac&#x27;s &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot;. &quot;Fortunata y Jacinta&quot; is almost as long as &quot;War and Peace&quot;. It concerns the fortunes of four characters: a young man-about-town, his wife, his lower-class mistress, and her husband. The character of Fortunata is based on a real girl whom Pérez Galdós first saw in a tenement building in Madrid, drinking a raw egg – which is the way in which the fictional characters come to meet.
# The later novels of psychological investigation, many of which are in dialogue form.

==Influences and characteristics==
Pérez Galdós was a frequent traveller. His novels display a detailed knowledge of many cities, towns and villages across Spain – such as Toledo in &quot;Angel Guerra&quot;. He visited Great Britain on many occasions, his first trip being in 1883. The descriptions of the various districts and low-life characters that he encountered in Madrid, particularly in &quot;Fortunata y Jacinta&quot;, are similar to the approaches of Dickens and the French Realist novelists such as Balzac. Pérez Galdós also showed a keen interest in technology and crafts, for example the lengthy descriptions of ropery in &quot;La desheredada&quot; or the detailed accounts of how the heroine of &quot;La de Bringas&quot; (1884) embroiders her pictures out of hair.

Galdós was also inspired by Émile Zola and naturalism in which writers strove to show how their characters were forged by the interaction of heredity, environment and social conditions. This set of influences is perhaps clearest in &quot;Lo prohibido&quot; (1884–85), which is also noteworthy for being told in the first person by an unreliable narrator who dies during the course of the work. This pre-dates similar experiments by André Gide such as &quot;L&#x27;immoraliste&quot;.

Pérez Galdós was also influenced by philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause, made famous in Spain via the educationalist Francisco Giner de los Ríos. One example of this can be seen his novel &quot;El Amigo Manso&quot; (1882), but it is also clear that the mystical tendencies of &quot;krausismo&quot; led to his interest in the wisdom sometimes shown by people who appear to be mad. This is an important theme in the works of Pérez Galdós from &quot;Fortunata y Jacinta&quot; onwards, for example in Miau (1888) and his final novel &quot;La razón de la sinrazón&quot;.

All through his literary career, Pérez Galdós incurred the wrath of the Catholic press. He attacked what he saw as abuses of entrenched and dogmatic religious power rather than religious faith or Christianity per se. In fact, the need for faith is a very important feature in many of his novels and there are many sympathetic portraits of priests and nuns.

==Return to the theatre==

Pérez Galdós&#x27; first mature play was &quot;Realidad&quot;, an adaptation of his novel of the same name, which had been written in dialogue. Pérez Galdós was attracted to the idea of making direct contact with the public and seeing and hearing their reactions. Rehearsals began in February 1892. The theatre was packed on the opening night and the play was received enthusiastically. However, the play did not receive universal critical acclaim due to the realism of the dialogue which did not accord with the theatrical norms of the time; and the setting of a scene in the boudoir of a courtesan, and the un-Spanish attitude towards a wife&#x27;s adultery. The Catholic press denounced the author as a perverse and wicked influence. The play ran for twenty nights.

In 1901, his play &quot;Electra&quot; caused a storm of outrage and floods of equally hyperbolic enthusiasm. As in many of his works, Pérez Galdós targeted clericalism and the inhuman fanaticism and superstition that can accompany it. The performance was interrupted by audience reaction and the author had to take many curtain calls. After the third night, the conservative and clerical parties organised a demonstration outside the theatre. The police moved in and arrested two members of a workers&#x27; organization who had reacted against the demonstration. Several people were wounded as a result of the clash and, the next day, the newspapers were divided between liberal support for the play and Catholic/conservative condemnation. Over one hundred performances were given in Madrid alone and the play was also performed in the provinces. In 1934, 33 years later, a revival in Madrid produced much the same degree of uproar and outrage.

==Later life and political involvement==
Despite his attacks on the forces of conservatism, Pérez Galdós had shown only a weak interest in being directly involved in politics. In 1886 the Prime Minister Práxedes Mateo Sagasta appointed him as the (absent) deputy for the town and district of Guayama, Puerto Rico at the Madrid parliament; he never visited the place, but had a representative inform him of the status of the area and felt a duty to represent its inhabitants appropriately. This appointment lasted for five years and mainly seems to have given him the chance to observe the conduct of politics at first hand, which informs scenes in some of his novels.

Later, Pérez Galdós was elected as a representative in the cortes of 1907. In 1909, together with Pablo Iglesias, he led the Republican–Socialist Conjunction, although Pérez Galdós, who &quot;did not feel himself a politician&quot;, soon withdrew from the struggles &quot;for the minutes and the farce&quot; and turned his already diminished energies to the novel and the theater.

In 1914 Pérez Galdós was elected as republican deputy for Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. This coincided with the promotion, in March 1914, of a national board tribute to Pérez Galdós, made up of personalities as Eduardo Dato (head of the Government), the banker Gustavo Bauer (Rothschild&#x27;s representative in Spain), Melquiades Álvarez, head of the reformists and the Duke of Alba, as well as writers including Jacinto Benavente, Mariano de Cavia and José de Echegaray. Politicians such as Antonio Maura or Lerroux were not included in the board, nor were representatives of the Church, or the socialists. He had been blind since 1912, was in financial difficulties and increasingly troubled by illness.

Pérez Galdós was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature for five years, 1912–16, but neither was successful. Among those who nominated Pérez Galdós was the 1904 winner José Echegaray. So, the 1914 national board was established to raise money to help Pérez Galdós, to which the King and his Prime Minister Romanones were the first to subscribe. The outbreak of World War I led to the scheme being closed in 1916 with the money raised being less than half of what was required to clear his debts. In that same year, however, the ministry of public instruction appointed him to take charge of the arrangements for the Cervantes tercentenary, for a stipend of 1000 pesetas per month. Although the event never took place, the stipend continued for the rest of Pérez Galdós&#x27;s life.

In 1918, he joined in a protest with Miguel de Unamuno and Mariano de Cavia against the encroaching censorship and authoritarianism coming from the monarch.

In the literary aspect, his admiration for the work of Tolstoy is reflected in a certain spiritualism in his last writings and, in the same Russian line, he could not conceal a certain pessimism for the destiny of Spain, as can be perceived in the pages of one of his last National Episodes, Cánovas (1912):

In 1897, Pérez Galdós was elected to the Real Academia Española (Royal Spanish Academy). After becoming blind he continued to dictate his books for the rest of his life. Pérez Galdós died at the age of 76. Shortly before his death, a statue in his honour was unveiled in the Parque del Buen Retiro, the most popular park in Madrid, financed solely by public donations. And a ceremony was held in which Pérez Galdós participated. The writer, now blind, explored the statue&#x27;s face with his hands and after recognizing it, he began to cry and said to the sculptor, a great friend of his, &quot;Magnificent, my friend Macho, and how it looks like me!

<doc id="898169" wikidata="Q469189" url="?curid=898169" title="Kurihara, Miyagi">
<text>is a city located in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 66,565, and a population density of 83 persons per km2 in 24,994 households. The total area of the city is . Parts of the city are within the borders of the Kurikoma Quasi-National Park.

==Geography==
Kurihara covers a part of the northwestern corner of Miyagi Prefecture. It is mostly rice farmland, and small mountain ridges, the largest of which cluster around Mount Kurikoma, the tallest mountain in Kurihara, which is located at the furthest northwestern point of Miyagi Prefecture. In summer, the lotus on Lake Izunuma bloom. In fall, Mount Kurikoma is covered in fall colors and in winter migrating swans and geese come in flocks to spend the season on Kurihara&#x27;s lakes.

===Neighboring municipalities===

*Higashinaruse
*Yuzawa
Iwate Prefecture
*Ichinoseki

*Ōsaki
*Tome

===Climate===
The climate of Kurihara is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) per the Köppen climate classification system. As with most of Japan, the summers in Kurihara are hot and humid with temperatures usually around . Summer is also typhoon season, however, since Kurihara is so far north and inland the area is rarely affected. Fall and spring are mild, with temperatures in the low to mid 20s (Celsius). In fall, the days usually begin foggy and cold but clear up by midday. Spring comes late to the region and is mostly sunny punctuated with random light showers. The temperature fluctuates around freezing in winter, falling to an average low of , and snow levels vary with altitude.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kurihara peaked at around the year 1950 and has declined over the past 70 years.

==History==
The area of present-day Kurihara was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period by the Emishi people. During the later portion of the Heian period, the area was ruled by the Northern Fujiwara. During the Sengoku period, the area was contested by various samurai clans before the area came under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain during the Edo period, under the Tokugawa shogunate.

With the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the area was organized into Kurihara District, Miyagi Prefecture.

During the Meiji period, many mines were dug in the mountains of Kurihara, and the Hosokura mine was at one point Japan&#x27;s largest producer of lead and zinc. The mine closed in 1987.

The city of Kurihara was established on April 1, 2005, from the merger of the towns of Ichihasama, Kannari, Kurikoma, Semine, Shiwahime, Takashimizu, Tsukidate, Uguisuzawa and Wakayanagi, and the village of Hanayama (all from Kurihara District, which was dissolved as a result of the merger). The new city hall is located in former Tsukidate. Although technically referred to as a &quot;city&quot;, Kurihara in fact functions more like a county composed of ten separate towns. This arrangement is similar to English unitary authorities in the United Kingdom, such as Herefordshire.

During 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, Kurihara–specifically the former town of Tsukidate–experienced the strongest shaking, with a Shindo 7 intensity.

==Government==
Kurihara has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 26 members. Kurihara contributes two seats to the Miyagi Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, after the abolishment of the Miyagi 6th district in 2022, the city is part of Miyagi 5th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The economy of Kurihara is largely based on agriculture. Mining, which once formed a significant percentage of the economy has largely disappeared with the closure of the last mines in the 1980s.

==Education==
Kurihara has 13 public elementary schools and eight public junior high schools operated by the city government and five public high schools operated by the Miyagi Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.

<text>Ely Airport (Yelland Field) is a county-owned airport three miles northeast of Ely, in White Pine County, Nevada, United States.

The Federal Aviation Administration says this airport had 239 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 216 in 2009 and 245 in 2010. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a &quot;general aviation&quot; airport.

==History==

===Historical airline service===
Ely&#x27;s first airline service began with United Airlines in 1955 providing one daily direct flight each to Salt Lake City and San Francisco using Convair 340 aircraft. The flight to San Francisco made stops in Elko and Reno, Nevada, as well as Sacramento and Oakland, California. Service was later upgraded using Douglas DC-6s that continued into 1970. This was United&#x27;s last service using piston engine propeller aircraft. United then began a subcontract arrangement with Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) using Convair 580s for its Ely service. In 1977, United brought the service back in house using Boeing 737-200 jets flying a San Francisco - Reno - Elko - Ely - Salt Lake City - Denver route with one daily round trip. Ely was the smallest destination ever to be served year round by United jets. United&#x27;s service ended on April 1, 1982.

Scenic Airlines also served Ely from about 1973 through 1976 with flights to Las Vegas using Cessna 402 aircraft. Chaparral Aviation flew from Ely to several smaller communities throughout northern Nevada in 1981 and 1982.

With the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, service to Ely became subsidized under the Essential Air Service program so that the city would not lose all service. A series of commuter airlines then provided service to Ely.

SkyWest Airlines provided service to Salt Lake City (SLC) as well as Elko and Reno, Nevada, offering three daily flights each using Piper Navajo aircraft. In 1986, SkyWest began operating as Western Express, a code-share affiliate for Western Airlines which had built a major hub at SLC. Service was reduced to only one daily roundtrip to SLC using a larger Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner aircraft. Western Airlines merged with Delta Air Lines in 1987, and the SkyWest flight then took on the designation as Delta Connection. Service continued until 1996.

Alpine Aviation provided two daily flights to SLC from 1996 through 1999 using Piper Cheyenne aircraft.

Scenic Airlines returned to Ely from 1999 through 2006 with flights to North Las Vegas Airport and Elko Regional Airport. 
On November 12, 2006, Air Midwest began flights to McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas via Cedar City Regional Airport in Cedar City, Utah, using Beechcraft 1900Ds. The stop in Cedar City was due to the fact that McCarran Airport requires Transportation Security Administration screening not available at Ely. The return flights operated nonstop from Las Vegas to Ely. The service began as America West Express, a feeder service for America West Airlines. America West merged with US Airways in 2007 at which time the service became US Airways Express. This service ended in mid-2008.

Great Lakes Aviation then took over serving Ely with Beechcraft 1900Ds as well. At first, a single flight to Denver was operated with a stop at Moab, Utah. In 2011, the service was switched to one daily nonstop flight to Las Vegas. Great Lakes service ended in March, 2013, as passenger traffic fell below the minimum required to maintain subsidies. Ely has not seen scheduled airline service since.

== Facilities==
Ely Airport covers 4,999 acres (2,023 ha) at an elevation of 6,260 feet (1,908 m). It has two asphalt runways: 18/36 is 6,017 by 150 feet (1,834 x 46 m) and 12/30 is 4,825 by 60 feet (1,471 x 18 m).

In the year ending April 30, 2022, the airport had 5,583 aircraft operations, average 107 per week: 73% general aviation, 23% air taxi, and 4% military. 10 aircraft were then based here: 9 single-engine, and 1 multi-engine.

<text>Luscious Jackson is an alternative rock/rap-rock group formed in 1991. The band&#x27;s name is a reference to former American basketball player Lucious Jackson.

The original band consisted of Jill Cunniff (lead vocals, bass), Gabby Glaser (vocals, guitar), and Vivian Trimble (keyboards, vocals). Drummer Kate Schellenbach joined the band midway through the recording of their 1992 debut EP &quot;In Search of Manny&quot;.

Between 1993 and 2000, the band released one EP, three full-length LPs, and ten singles on the Beastie Boys&#x27; Grand Royal label. Their biggest hit—and only &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 entry—was &quot;Naked Eye&quot;. Other singles include &quot;Here&quot;, &quot;Daughters of the Kaos&quot;, &quot;Citysong&quot;, &quot;Under Your Skin&quot; and &quot;Ladyfingers&quot;.

Keyboardist Vivian Trimble left the group in 1998, and in 2000 the group announced their breakup, after releasing one album as a trio. February 2007 saw the release of the group&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

In 2011, the three remaining members announced that they had reunited and were planning to make new music. The band released two new albums, including a children&#x27;s album, in November 2013.

==History==
===1991–1993===
In 1991, Jill Cunniff and Gabby Glaser (the niece of graphic designer Milton Glaser) created the first Luscious Jackson demo with tip money from their restaurant jobs. The band&#x27;s name was derived from a malapropism of the name of former American basketball player Lucious Jackson, after the band members heard an announcer on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; mispronounce Jackson&#x27;s first name as &quot;Luscious&quot; and thought it would make for a great band name. Their first live performance was opening for Beastie Boys and Cypress Hill at the now-defunct Building in lower New York City. The Beastie Boys asked Luscious Jackson to be the first band on their Grand Royal label.

Former Beastie Boys band member Kate Schellenbach soon joined Luscious Jackson on drums, while Vivian Trimble took keyboard and backing vocal duties.

Three tracks from the original Luscious Jackson demo, along with four new songs, were released in 1992 as the &quot;In Search of Manny&quot; EP. &quot;Let Yourself Get Down&quot; and &quot;Daughters of the Kaos&quot; were issued as promotional singles, while a video was also filmed for the latter.

===1994–1995===
After previewing two new recordings from their forthcoming album on the promotional &quot;Daughters of the Kaos&quot; EP, Luscious Jackson released their first full-length LP for the Grand Royal label, &quot;Natural Ingredients&quot; (1994). The album spawned three minor hits with &quot;Citysong&quot;, &quot;Deep Shag&quot; and &quot;Here&quot;, the latter featured in the film &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995). In addition, all three singles had music videos which received airplay on MTV.

The years 1994 and 1995 brought continued success for the band. They took part in the Lollapalooza tour and were the musical guest on numerous television shows, including &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Viva Variety&quot; and MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. They were also featured in a fashion segment on MTV&#x27;s &quot;House of Style&quot; and on the Nickelodeon series &quot;The Adventures of Pete and Pete&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Dance Fever&quot;, where the band performed &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Satellite&quot;, &quot;Pele Merengue&quot; and &quot;Here&quot; at Little Pete&#x27;s first junior high dance.

While on tour in 1995, Trimble and Cunniff recorded a collection of mellow, acoustic-driven songs under the name Kostars, titled &quot;Klassics with a &quot;K&quot;&quot;. The album was released in 1996 and featured contributions by Schellenbach and Glaser, as well as Gene and Dean Ween of Ween, and was produced by Josephine Wiggs, bass player of the Breeders.

===1996–1997===
The time between 1996 and 1997 was Luscious Jackson&#x27;s most commercially successful period. While promoting the release of their second full-length album, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Fever In Fever Out&quot; (produced by Daniel Lanois), they scored their first &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 hit with &quot;Naked Eye&quot;. Two follow-up singles were released: &quot;Under Your Skin&quot; and &quot;Why Do I Lie?&quot;, the latter of which was featured in the Gus Van Sant film &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997).

During this time, Luscious Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Nice Duds&quot; fan club members received a 10-track CD album of demos and live rarities titled &quot;Tip Top Starlets&quot;.

===1998–2000===
In 1998, Luscious Jackson recorded George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Crush on You&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Red Hot + Rhapsody&quot;, a tribute to Gershwin which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease. Luscious Jackson were featured in an ad campaign for the Gap throughout 1998 and 1999. Their Christmas ad &quot;Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!&quot; was voted the most popular of the campaign in &quot;TV Guide&quot;.

In April of that year, Trimble left Luscious Jackson to pursue other interests, stating that she had grown tired of touring and wanted to ground herself in New York City. Two years later, Trimble and Josephine Wiggs released a self-titled album under the name Dusty Trails.

In 1999, Luscious Jackson (recording as a trio) released their third full-length LP, &quot;Electric Honey&quot;. The single &quot;Ladyfingers&quot; was a moderate success, with the video put into heavy rotation on VH1. &quot;Ladyfingers&quot; was also featured in the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; TV series episode &quot;Beer Bad&quot;, as well as the &quot;Witch Trial&quot; episode of &quot;Charmed&quot;. A second single, &quot;Nervous Breakthrough&quot;, was issued without a music video or commercial single release. Plans for releasing &quot;Devotion&quot; as the third single from &quot;Electric Honey&quot; were scrapped as interest in the album waned, although a radio/single remix was prepared.

The band embarked upon a tour that year with Cibo Matto, and both bands had performed at that year&#x27;s Lilith Fair. Trimble was replaced by Singh Birdsong on keyboards, and the touring group was joined by DJ Alex Young and bassist/percussionist Tia Sprocket. In August, the tour included a date at the Opera House in Toronto.

In 2000, Luscious Jackson announced they would no longer be recording or touring, as they wanted to spend more time with their families.

===Greatest hits and solo albums===
In February 2007, Capitol Records released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album.

On February 20, 2007, Cunniff released her first solo album, &quot;City Beach&quot;, on the Militia Group label.

On June 26, 2007, Glaser released her debut solo album, &quot;Gimme Splash&quot;, via Latchkey Recordings.

===Reunion (2011–present)===
In 2006, Luscious Jackson announced plans to reunite to record a new album of songs for children. By September of that year, the band had completed eleven tracks for the album and was seeking a label to release it. It was untitled, although Cunniff told MTV she wanted to call it &quot;It&#x27;s All Goo&quot;.

On July 8, Luscious Jackson&#x27;s official Twitter and Facebook accounts became active and confirmed that the band had reunited. Cunniff, Glaser and Schellenbach all returned to the band, while Trimble did not. Working with Pledgemusic as part of a fundraising drive, the band hoped to finish their album for children that had first been planned in 2006. They also revealed plans to make a new studio album, their first since 1999. A previously unreleased track from 1999 called &quot;Girlscout&quot; was also made available by the band as a free download.

On February 8, 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine posted an article on how the band had reunited quietly in 2011 after more than a decade apart to begin work on their first album of new material since &quot;Electric Honey&quot;. The band opted to skip signing to a traditional label in favor of funding their new project through Pledgemusic. A track titled &quot;Are You Ready?&quot; was made available via internet stream. In September 2013, the lead single from their forthcoming album &quot;Magic Hour&quot;, &quot;So Rock On&quot;, was premiered on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Songs Considered&quot; program.

The trio released &quot;Magic Hour&quot; on November 5, 2013, followed by their children&#x27;s album, &quot;Baby DJ&quot;, on November 12. The band performed two shows in support of &quot;Magic Hour&quot; in Philadelphia on November 23 and New York on December 7, followed by an appearance on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on November 18. Sporadic performances followed in 2014 and 2016.

On April 6, 2023, it was reported that former keyboard player Vivian Trimble had died two days prior, on April 4, at the age of 59, due to cancer.

<text>Guido Guinizelli (ca. 1225–1276) was an Italian love poet and is considered the &quot;father&quot; of the Dolce Stil Novo. He was the first to write in this new style of poetry writing, and thus is held to be the &quot;ipso facto&quot; founder. He was born in, and later exiled from, Bologna, Italy. It is speculated that he died in Verona, Italy.

== Poetry ==
Guinizelli&#x27;s poetry can be briefly described as a conciliation between divine and earthly love with deep psychological introspection. His major works are &quot;Al cor gentil rempaira sempre Amore&quot; (Within the gentle heart abideth Love), which Peter Dronke considers &quot;perhaps the most influential love-song of the thirteenth century&quot; (Dronke 1965, 57), as well as &quot;Io vogli[o] del ver la mia donna laudare&quot; and &quot;Vedut&#x27;ho la lucente stella Diana&quot;.

The main themes of the Dolce Stil Novo can be found in Guinizelli&#x27;s &quot;Al cor gentil rempaira sempre amore&quot;: the angelic beauty of the beloved women, the comparison of nobility to the sun and the rampant use of topoi such as &quot;cor gentil&quot; and &quot;Amore.&quot;

== Role in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; ==

=== &quot;Purgatorio&quot; XI ===
Guido Guinizelli appears twice in Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Purgatorio&quot;. At first, he is briefly mentioned in &quot;Purgatorio&quot; XI, when Dante encounters the great Italian artist, Oderisi da Gubbio, on the terrace of Pride. While discussing the fleeting nature of fame and recognition, Oderisi refers to Guido Guinizelli and his successor, Guido Cavalcanti (ca. 1250–1300): Thus has one Guido taken from the other

the glory of our tongue, and he, perhaps, is born

who will drive one and then the other from the nest (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; XI. 97-99).

=== &quot;Purgatorio&quot; XXVI ===
In &quot;Purgatorio&quot; XXVI, Dante journeys through the terrace of Lust, where he finally meets Guido Guinizelli. Like the other shades on this terrace, Guido is engulfed in flames to repent for his burning desires while alive. Once Guido reveals his identity, Dante narrates the awe and respect he has for the poet: when he gave his name and I knew he had been

father to me and to others, my betters,

who always used love&#x27;s sweet and graceful rhymes (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; XXVI. 97-99).In this tercet, Dante refers to Guinizelli&#x27;s influence on Italian poetry and the style of Dolce Stil Novo.

<doc id="898197" wikidata="Q1062089" url="?curid=898197" title="Geonim">
<text>Geonim (; ; also transliterated Gaonim, singular Gaon) were the presidents of the two great Babylonian Talmudic Academies of Sura and Pumbedita, in the Abbasid Caliphate. They were generally accepted as the spiritual leaders of the Jewish community worldwide in the early medieval era, in contrast to the &quot;Resh Galuta&quot; (exilarch) who wielded secular authority over the Jews in Islamic lands.

&quot;Geonim&quot; is the plural of (&quot;Ga&#x27;on&quot;) , which means &quot;pride&quot; or &quot;splendor&quot; in Biblical Hebrew and since the 19th century &quot;genius&quot; as in modern Hebrew. As a title of a Babylonian college president it meant something like &quot;His Excellency&quot;.

The &quot;Geonim&quot; played a prominent and decisive role in the transmission and teaching of Torah and Jewish law. They taught Talmud and decided on issues on which no ruling had been rendered during the period of the Talmud. 
== Era ==
The period of the Geonim began in 589 CE (Hebrew date: 4349), after the period of the Sevora&#x27;im, and ended in 1038 (Hebrew date: 4798). The first gaon of Sura, according to Sherira Gaon, was Mar Rab Mar, who assumed office in 689. The last gaon of Sura was Samuel ben Ḥofni, who died in 1034 CE; the last gaon of Pumbedita was Hezekiah Gaon, who was tortured to death by zealots of the Buyid dynasty in 1040; hence the activity of the Geonim covers a period of nearly 450 years.

There were two major Geonic academies, one in Sura and the other in Pumbedita. The Sura Academy was originally dominant, but its authority waned towards the end of the Geonic period and the Pumbedita Gaonate gained ascendancy (Louis Ginzberg in &quot;Geonica&quot;).

==Role in Jewish life==
The Geonim officiated, in the last place, as directors of the academies, continuing as such the educational activity of the Amoraim and Saboraim. For while the Amoraim, through their interpretation of the Mishnah, gave rise to the Talmud, and while the Saboraim definitively edited it, the Geonim&#x27;s task was to interpret it; for them it became the subject of study and instruction, and they gave religio-legal decisions in agreement with its teachings.

During the geonic period the Babylonian schools were the chief centers of Jewish learning; the Geonim, the heads of these schools, were recognized as the highest authorities in Jewish law. Despite the difficulties which hampered the irregular communications of the period, Jews who lived even in most distant countries sent their inquiries concerning religion and law to these officials in Babylonia.

In the latter centuries of the geonic period, from the middle of the tenth to the middle of the eleventh, their supremacy lessened, as the study of the Talmud received care in other lands. The inhabitants of these regions gradually began to submit their questions to the heads of the schools in their own countries. Eventually they virtually ceased sending their questions to Babylonian Geonim.

==The title &quot;Gaon&quot;==
The title &quot;gaon&quot; came to be applied to the heads of the two Babylonian academies of Sura and Pumbedita, although it did not displace the original title of &quot;Rosh Yeshivah Ge&#x27;on Ya&#x27;akov&quot; (Hebrew, head of the academy, pride of Jacob). The Aramaic term used was &quot;Resh metivta.&quot;

The title &quot;gaon&quot; properly designated the office of head of the academy. The title became popular in use around the end of the 6th century. As the academies of Sura and Pumbedita were invested with judicial authority, the gaon officiated as supreme judge.

The organization of the Babylonian academies recalled the ancient Sanhedrin. In many responsa of the Geonim, members of the schools are mentioned who belonged to the &quot;great sanhedrin&quot;, and others who belonged to the &quot;small sanhedrin&quot;. In front of the presiding gaon and facing him were seated seventy members of the academy in seven rows of ten persons each, each person in the seat assigned to him, and the whole forming, with the gaon, the so-called &quot;great sanhedrin&quot;. Gaon Amram calls them in a responsum the &quot;ordained scholars who take the place of the great sanhedrin&quot;. (A regular ordination (&quot;semichah&quot;) is of course not implied here: that did not exist in Babylonia, only a solemn nomination taking place.)

Gaon Ẓemaḥ refers in a responsum to &quot;the ancient scholars of the first row, who take the place of the great sanhedrin&quot;. The seven masters, or &quot;allufim&quot; and the &quot;ḥaberim&quot;, the three most prominent among the other members of the college, sat in the first of the seven rows. Nine sanhedrists were subordinated to each of the seven allufim, who probably supervised the instruction given during the entire year by their subordinates. The members of the academy who were not ordained sat behind the seven rows of sanhedrists.

==Works of the Geonim==
===Responsa===

Early in the Geonic era, the majority of the questions asked them were sent from Babylonia and the neighboring lands. Jewish communities in these regions had religious leaders who were somewhat acquainted with the Talmud, and who could on occasion visit the Jewish academies in Babylon. A literature of questions and answers developed, known as the responsa literature.

The questions were usually limited to one or more specific cases, while the responsum to such a query gave a ruling, a concise reason for it, together with supporting citations from the Talmud, and often a refutation of any possible objection.

More discursive were the responsa of the later geonim after the first half of the 9th century, when questions began to be sent from more distant regions, where the inhabitants were less familiar with the Talmud, and were less able to visit the Babylonian academies, then the only seats of Talmudic learning.

The later geonim did not restrict themselves to the Mishnah and Talmud, but used the decisions and responsa of their predecessors, whose sayings and traditions were generally regarded as authoritative. These responsa of the later geonim were often essays on Talmudic themes, and since a single letter often answered many questions, it frequently became book-length in size. Two important examples of such books are the Siddur of Amram Gaon, addressed to the Jews of Spain in response to a question about the laws of prayer, and the Epistle of Sherira Gaon, which sets out the history of the Mishnah and the Talmud in response to a question from Tunisia.

Some of the responsa that have survived are in their original form, while others are extant only as quotations in later works. Many have been found in the Cairo Genizah.

Examples of responsa collections are:
*&quot;Halakhot Pesukot min ha-Geonim&quot; (Brief Rulings of the Geonim): Constantinople 1516
*&quot;Sheelot u-Teshuvot me-ha-Geonim&quot; (Questions and Answers/Responses from the Geonim): Constantinople 1575
*&quot;Shaare Tzedek&quot; (Gates of Justice), edited by Nissim ben Hayyim: Salonica 1792, containing 533 responsa arranged according to subject and an index by the editor
*&quot;Teshuvot Ha-Geonim&quot;, ed. Mussafia: Lyck 1864
*&quot;Teshuvot ha-Geonim: Shaare Teshuvah&quot; with commentary &quot;Iyye ha-Yam&quot; by Israel Moses Hazan: Livorno 1869; linked here
*&quot;Shaare Teshuvah ha-Shalem&quot;, ed. Leiter: New York 1946
*&quot;Teshuvot Geone Mizrach u-Ma&#x27;arav&quot;, ed. Mueller: Berlin 1888
*Lewin, B. M., &quot;Otzar ha-Geonim: Thesaurus of the Gaonic Responsa and Commentaries Following the Order of the Talmudic Tractates&quot; (13 vols): Haifa 1928
*Assaf, Simhah, &quot;Teshuvot ha-Geonim&quot;: Jerusalem 1927 (second volume 1942).

===Other works===
Individual Geonim often composed treatises and commentaries. Three handbooks on Jewish law are:
* &quot;Halachot Pesukot&quot; of Yehudai Gaon (not to be confused with the responsa collection of the same name): this was the basis of many other abridgments
* &quot;She&#x27;iltot&quot; of Achai Gaon
* &quot;Halachot Gedolot&quot;, by Simeon Kayyara.

The most notable author among the Geonim was Saadia Gaon, who wrote Biblical commentaries and many other works: he is best known for the philosophical work Emunoth ve-Deoth.

==&quot;Yarchei Kallah&quot;==
Two months of the year were denoted as &quot;yarchei kallah&quot;, or &quot;months of the bride&quot; (referring to the Talmud) – the Hebrew months of Adar and Elul. During this time, foreign students assembled in the academy for common study.

During the first three weeks of the &quot;yarchei kallah&quot; the scholars seated in the first row reported on the Talmud treatise assigned for study during the preceding months; in the fourth week the other scholars and also some of the pupils were called upon. Discussions followed, and difficult passages were laid before the gaon, who also took a prominent part in the debates, and freely reproved any member of the college who was not up to the standard of scholarship. At the end of the &quot;yarchei kallah&quot; the gaon designated the Talmudic treatise which the members of the assembly were obliged to study in the months intervening until the next gathering took place. The students who were not given seats were exempt from this task, being free to choose a subject for study according to their needs.

During the &quot;yarchei kallah&quot;, the gaon laid before the assembly a number of the questions that had been sent in during the year from all parts of the Diaspora. The requisite answers were discussed, and were finally recorded by the secretary of the academy according to the directions of the gaon. At the end of the &quot;yarchei kallah&quot; the questions, together with the answers, were read to the assembly, and the answers were signed by the gaon. A large number of the geonic responsa originated in this way; but many of them were written by the respective Geonim without consulting the kallah assemblies convened in the spring.

==Individual Geonim==
*Achai Gaon (died c. 761)
*Amram Gaon (died 875)
*Dodai ben Nahman, gaon of the Talmudic academy at Pumbedita (761–764)
*Hai Gaon (939–1038)
*Saadia Gaon (882 or 892 – 942)
*Sherira Gaon (906–1006)

Chananel Ben Chushiel (Rabbeinu Chananel) (990–1053) and Nissim Gaon (990–1062) of Kairouan, though not holders of the office of Gaon, are often ranked among the Geonim. Others, perhaps more logically, consider them as constituting the first generation of Rishonim. Maimonides (1135–1204) sometimes uses the term &quot;Geonim&quot; in an extended sense, to mean &quot;leading authorities&quot;, regardless of what country they lived in.

<text>* List of Provinces of Japan &gt; Tōsandō &gt; Rikuzen Province &gt; Monou District
* Japan &gt; Tōhoku region &gt; Miyagi Prefecture &gt; Monou District

 was a rural district in Miyagi Prefecture, in the Tōhoku region of northern Japan. 

The city of Higashimatsushima and much of the city of Ishinomaki were formerly part of this district, which was dissolved in 2005.

==History==
Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the district was within Mutsu Province and was under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain. In 1869, following the Meiji restoration, Mutsu Province was divided, with the area of Monou District becoming part of Rikuzen Province, and from 1872, part of Miyagi Prefecture. In the establishment of the modern municipalities system, the district was organized into fifteen villages (Miyato (宮戸村), Nobiru (野蒜村), Ono (小野村), Takagi (鷹来村), Kanomata (鹿又村), Fukaya (深谷村), Maeyachi (前谷地村), Nakatsuyama (中津山村), Monou (桃生町), Oyachi (大谷地村), Iinogawa (飯野川町), Hashiura (橋浦村), Futamata (二股村), Okawa (大川村), Jugohama (十五浜村)).

*April 1, 1896: The village of Fukaura was abolished; villages of Oshio, Akai, Kita, Sue and Hirobuchi were established.
*March 26, 1901: The village of Iinogawa was elevated to town status.
*April 1, 1940: The village of Takagi was elevated to town status and renamed Yamoto (矢本町)
*April 1, 1941: The village of Jugohama was elevated to town status and renamed Ogatsu (雄勝町)
*April 1, 1951: The village of Shishiori was elevated to town status
*March 11, 1955: Okawa, Oyachi and Futamata merge with Iinogawa to form the town of Kahoku (河北町)
*March 11, 1955: The villages of Kanomata, Maeyachi, Kita, Sue, Hirobuchi merge to form the town of Kanan (河南町)
*March 11, 1955: The villages of Monou and Nakatsuyama merge to form the town of Monou.
*March 30, 1955: The village Hashiura and the village of Jusanhama from Motoyoshi District merge to form the village of Kitakami (北上村)
*May 3, 1955: The villages of Miyato, Nobiru and Ono merge to form the town of Naruse (鳴瀬町)
*May 3, 1955: The villages of Akai and Oshio merge with the town of Yamoto.
*April 1, 1961: The village of Kitakami is elevated to town status.

* On April 1, 2005 - the towns of Yamoto and Naruse were merged to form the city of Higashimatsushima.
* On April 1, 2005 - the towns of Kahoku, Kanan, Kitakami, Monou, and Ogatsu were merged with the town of Oshika (from Oshika District) and Ishinomaki City to create a larger, new and expanded Ishinomaki City.</text><links>

<text>Countersignaling or countersignalling is the behavior in which agents with the highest level of a given property invest less into proving it than individuals with a medium level of the same property. This concept is primarily useful for analyzing human behavior and thus relevant to signaling theory in economics, sociology and psychology.

==Signals and signaling theory==
Much research is concerned with understanding what signals signalers should send to convince a receiver that they have a certain property, and what signals a receiver should be convinced by. One way of doing this is by putting money on the table just to prove that you can; someone without the property would not be able to do the same. For example, in biology peacocks expend energy on elaborate plumage that increase their risk of dying. By doing this they demonstrate their genetic fitness, as genetically less fit males can only grow small plumage, while genetically better individuals can grow larger ones. (In biology, this is known as the handicap principle.)

Countersignaling, by contrast, is showing off by not showing off, or by playing humble. For instance, the &quot;new money&quot; are eager to flaunt their wealth, and often surround themselves with expensive luxury items. Those with old money are more understated, preferring not to waste money on what they deem frivolities.

There are a number of different models that deal with this behavior and explain how rational individuals – those interested only in maximising certain utility – would find countersignaling beneficial. One of these is by Feltovich, Harbaugh and To. They developed a formal model in which receivers of signals judge the senders of signals based not only on what can be inferred from the signal sent, but also on additional information, which is assumed to be helpful but not perfect. For example, senders might be of low, medium, or high quality, and the additional information might be adequate for distinguishing low from high but not necessarily from distinguishing medium from low or high. Under certain circumstances, medium-quality senders will have an incentive to signal (to ensure that they can be distinguished from low-quality ones), but high-quality senders may not—they are not likely to be mistaken for low-quality senders in any case, and signaling behavior may mark them as medium.

<doc id="898220" wikidata="Q1011185" url="?curid=898220" title="Onagawa, Miyagi">
<text>is a town located in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 6,319, and a population density of 97 persons per km2 in 3,110 households. The total area of the town is .

==Geography==
Onagawa is located on the rugged Sanriku Coast of north-central Miyagi Prefecture, with the Kitakami Mountains to the west and the city of Ishinomaki to the east, south and north. Much of the town is within the borders of the Sanriku Fukkō National Park. Onagawa is a natural deep water port, located at the intersection of two major ocean currents and noted for its commercial fishing industry. Located nearby on the southern side of Onagawa Bay is the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Miyagi Prefecture
*Ishinomaki

===Climate===
Onagawa has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by mild summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Onagawa is 11.1 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1213 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 23.6 °C, and lowest in January, at around -0.1 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Onagawa has declined rapidly over the past 60 years.
==History==
The area of present-day Onagawa was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period by the Emishi people. During later portion of the Heian period, the area was ruled by the Northern Fujiwara. During the Sengoku period, the area was contested by various samurai clans before the area came under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain during the Edo period, under the Tokugawa shogunate.

The village of Onagawa was established on 1 June 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system.

The port of Onagawa, with its deep and sheltered harbor, has long been important both commercially and militarily. The port was hit by an air raid on 9 August 1945, which sank several ships during the closing days of World War II. A memorial to Canadian Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm pilot Robert Hampton Gray who died in the attack, was unveiled in the town in 1989.

Onagawa was raised to town status on 1 April 1956.

===2011 earthquake and tsunami===
Onagawa was one of the most heavily damaged communities by the 11 March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The tsunami reached in excess of in height and swept inland, claiming 827 lives and destroying 70% of the buildings in the town. At least 12 of the town&#x27;s 25 designated evacuation sites were inundated by the tsunami. The town&#x27;s hospital located on a hill was extensively flooded on the first floor at the maximum recorded wave height of 18 meters. Six reinforced concrete buildings in the town of up to 4 stories in height were overturned by the force of the surging water and debris and Onagawa Station and its nearby railway tracks were also destroyed.

In an incident widely reported in the Chinese media, Mitsuru Sato, managing director of Sato Suisan, a fish processing company in the town, gave his life ensuring that all the firm&#x27;s workers, including 20 female Chinese resident trainees, had evacuated safely to higher ground.

Whereas the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant suffered insufficient cooling in the wake of the tsunami which led to three nuclear meltdowns and the release of radioactive material, the Onagawa nuclear generation facility, much closer to the earthquake epicenter, survived the earthquake without any significant damage and served as an emergency refuge for the local community.

The town had previously been hit by tsunami including that caused by the 1960 Valdivia earthquake, although it had received comparatively less impact from tsunami in the aftermath of the 1896 and 1933 Sanriku earthquakes.

Seismologists note that the deep inlets and bays of the nearby ria coastline have the potential to amplify the destructiveness of tsunami waves. Tsunami mitigation structures, warning systems and evacuation training have long been a feature of the town.

===Post tsunami reconstruction===
 The local community&#x27;s reconstruction efforts, in many cases led by Onagawa private sector business leaders, have outpaced many larger towns impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Within days of the disaster privately owned construction machinery were used to clear roads, a wholesale fish market was relaunched on 1 April and a reconstruction advisory board was formed shortly thereafter. In the aftermath of the tsunami local residents successfully established small scale grocery stores and retail food facilities in a series of temporary market structures.

Onagawa&#x27;s reconstruction plans were deliberated and materialized through a variety of participatory governance arrangements.

On 21 March 2015 the reconstructed Onagawa Station reopened marking the restoration of the entire Ishinomaki Line. The new station building features an integrated community center and public bathing facility on the upper floors.

Serving both the needs of the local community and attracting out of town visitors, a pedestrianized shopping promenade called Seapal Pia was opened in December 2015.

Five years after the tsunami many Onagawa residents continue to live in short-term temporary accommodation. After extensive landscaping, new residential housing is being relocated at higher elevations on nearby hillsides and leftover soil is being used to raise industrial and commercial sections closer to the water an average of above sea level.

Reconstruction has been supported both by central government funding and a number of private individuals and foundations including:
* The Qatar Friendship Fund, which provided US$24 million for the design and construction of a new fish processing and refrigerated storage facility.
* Pritzker Architecture Prize winner Shigeru Ban, and the Voluntary Architects&#x27; Network, provided designs both for temporary housing shelters in the town as well as the rebuilt Onagawa Station building.

==Government==

Onagawa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 12 members. Onagawa, together with the city of Ishinomaki, contributes five seats to the Miyagi Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Miyagi 5th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The economy of Onagawa is largely based on commercial fishing. The town acts as a processing and distribution hub for variety of sea foods, but is particularly known for coho salmon, pacific saury and the cultivation of oysters. The Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant, once a major source of income for the town, has remained offline since the 2011 earthquake; an intended restart date for the plant was originally set for 2021, but has been moved to 2024.

==Education==
Onagawa has one public elementary school and one public junior high school operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school. The old high school (Miyagi Prefecture Onagawa High School
) was closed in 2014 as it only had 47 students.

<doc id="898221" wikidata="Q1252987" url="?curid=898221" title="Dovre National Park">
<text>Dovre National Park () is a national park in Innlandet county, Norway. The park was established in 2003. The park covers an area of and the altitude varies from the tree line at about up to its highest point at Fokstuhøe at . The area consists of plateaus and weathered, rounded mountain peaks.

The park lies between the two larger and older parks Rondane National Park to the southeast and Dovrefjell-Sunndalsfjella National Park to the north. Its opening was part of the larger expansion of parks in the area and its purpose was to protect the area between the two parks. Like Dovrefjell-Sunndalsfjella and Rondane, Dovre national park hosts wild Fennoscandian reindeer of Beringia origin. Part of the reason for the existence of these three adjacent parks is to provide a large contiguous habitat area for the native wild reindeer population.

==Name==
The park is named after the municipality of Dovre. For the meaning of the name, see Dovre#Name. It is common to use the name &quot;Dovre&quot; also for the large mountainous area of Dovrefjell which is also known as the Dovre region. From the oldest times has Dovrefjell been the border region between the northern and southern parts of Norway, and the road over the mountain was well known. The expression &quot;til Dovre faller&quot; (&#x27;until the Dovre mountains fall apart&#x27; = until the end of the world) is widely used in Norwegian.

==Ecotourist==
In recent decades, tourism has also begun to be seen as a source of economic stability for the country. Norwegian sites are promoting natural destinations on the world market in order to attract more tourists and thus increase the benefits of tourism in the country. This means that many of the nature destinations that were previously closed to the public are now available. However, Norway pays a lot of attention to nature and is looking for ways to achieve sustainable tourism. 
Dovre-Sunndalsfjella National Park is one of the largest protected areas in Norway. Therefore, in order to apply ecological tourism, and to protect the park&#x27;s fauna and vegetation. Norway decided to set some rules for tourists in the park so that activities such as camping, berry and mushroom picking, hunting, trapping and angling are possible, but with agreement, on specially marked routes on the tourist map of the area. Organised tours must have a special permit to operate in the national park. The only exception is traditional trekking activity carried out by tourist associations, schools, kindergartens, non-profit organisations and associations.

<doc id="898223" wikidata="Q1268666" url="?curid=898223" title="Dyess Air Force Base">
<text>Dyess Air Force Base (AFB) is a United States Air Force (USAF) base located about southwest of downtown Abilene, Texas, and west of Fort Worth, Texas.

The host unit at Dyess is the 7th Bomb Wing assigned to the Global Strike Command Eighth Air Force. The wing is one of only two B-1B Lancer strategic bomber wings in the USAF, the other being the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota.

The 317th Airlift Wing, assigned to Air Mobility Command Eighteenth Air Force, is a tenant unit and one of four world-wide active-duty locations for the C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft.

Dyess AFB was established in 1942 as Abilene Army Air Base. It was renamed in honor of Texas native and Bataan Death March survivor Lieutenant Colonel William Dyess. As of 2023, the 7th Bomb Wing is commanded by Colonel Seth W. Spanier. The vice commander is Colonel Samuel M. Friend and the command chief master sergeant is Chief Master Sergeant Richelle D. Baker.

Dyess covers , and is home to the 7th Bomb Wing, which consists of four groups. The 9th and 28th Bomb Squadrons fly the B-1B. In addition, the 28th Bomb Squadron is the USAF schoolhouse for all B-1B aircrew members.

The base employs more than 5,000 people, making it the single largest employer in the area. Dyess AFB has nearly 200 facilities on base, plus 988 units of family housing, and encompasses of land. The base has a total economic impact of nearly $310 million yearly on the local community.
==History==
The base is named after Lt Col William Edwin Dyess, a native of Albany, Texas, who was captured by the Japanese on Bataan in April 1942. Dyess escaped in April 1943 and fought with guerilla forces on Mindanao until evacuated by submarine in July 1943. During retraining in the United States, his P-38 Lightning caught fire in flight on 23 December 1943 near Burbank, California. He refused to bail out over a populated area and died in the crash of his P-38 in a vacant lot.

===World War II===
In 1942, the United States Army Air Forces built Tye Army Air Field, as it was popularly known, on the site of what is now known as Dyess AFB. On 18 December 1942, the field was opened and was initially named Abilene Army Air Base. The name was changed on 8 April 1943 to Abilene Army Airfield. The first host unit as Abilene AAB was the 474th Base HQ and Airbase Squadron, established on 18 December 1942. The airfield was initially assigned to Second Air Force and its mission was to be a flying training center for cadets.

Known groups which trained at the base during the war were:
* 77th Reconnaissance Group (6 April 1943 – 12 September 1943)
* 69th Tactical Reconnaissance Group (10 September 1943 – 12 November 1943)
* 408th Fighter-Bomber Group (10 November 1943 – January 1944)

The 77th and 69th groups were units that trained reconnaissance personnel who later served overseas. The 408th was a new group that received A-24, A-26, P-40, and P-47 aircraft in October 1943 and began training. It was disbanded shortly after leaving Abilene on 1 April 1944.

On 25 March 1944, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt training for flight cadets was taken over by the 261st Army Air Force Base Unit. Training continued until 1 April 1946.

With the end of the war, the base was declared inactive on 31 January 1946. Although assigned to Continental Air Command, Abilene AAF was classified as an inactive subbase of Fort Worth Army Airfield and was sold to the city of Abilene for $1. It was used as a training facility for the Texas Army National Guard for several years.

===Cold War===
Shortly after the Korean War broke out, the city of Abilene called for the need of a military installation. They believed the 1,500 acres (6 km2) of the former Tye AAF were the perfect site for a new base. The city&#x27;s leaders went to The Pentagon with their request. The city showed their determination for a new base by raising almost $1 million to purchase an additional 3,500 acres (14 km2) adjacent to the site. They were able to attract then U.S. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s (D-TX) attention, who had the power to persuade military officials to reactivate the base in Abilene. Finally, in July 1952, Congress approved the $32 million needed to construct an air force base on the Tye AAF site. It was to be called Abilene Air Force Base and a little over three years after first starting construction, the base was opened on 15 April 1956.

Dyess&#x27; first active combat unit was the 341st Bombardment Wing, which activated on 1 September 1955. The 341st was part of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), flying the B-47 Stratojet, which it continued to operate until its inactivation on 25 June 1961.

On 1 December 1956, the name of the base was changed to Dyess Air Force Base in honor of the late Lt Col William E. Dyess, USAAF.

The 96th Bombardment Wing moved to Dyess on 8 September 1957 and for a few years worked alongside the 341st. It included not just B-47 and B-52 nuclear bombers, but also the KC-97 and later on the KC-135 refueling aircraft. During the Cold War, the base was constantly on alert in case of nuclear attack. Even signs in the base&#x27;s movie theater would instantly alert pilots in the scenario that the USSR would initiate a nuclear attack during a movie. These can still be seen today at the theater.

During the Vietnam War, B-52s and KC-135s (917th ARS) from the 96th BW participated heavily in various air campaigns, including Arc Light, Young Tiger, Bullet Shot, Linebacker, and Linebacker II missions over North and South Vietnam. The B-52s flew combat missions primarily out of Andersen AFB, Guam and Utapao RTAFB, Thailand during these missions. The KC-135As flew primarily out of Utapao RTAFB, Thailand, Clark AFB, Philippines, Kadena AFB, Okinawa, Andersen AFB, Guam, and NAS Agana, Guam.

On 19 November 1959, the United States Army conducted groundbreaking ceremonies at Dyess AFB for the battalion headquarters of the 5th Missile Battalion, 517th Artillery of the U.S. Army Air Defense Command. Installed to defend the SAC bombers and Atlas F missile silos stationed at and around Dyess AFB, the two Nike Hercules sites were controlled by a &quot;BIRDIE&quot; system installed at Sweetwater Air Force Station. Site DY-10, located at Fort Phantom Hill and site DY-50, located southwest of Abilene , remained operational from 1960 until 1966.

Units stationed at Dyess Air Force Base while the 5/517th was operational included SAC&#x27;s 819th Strategic Aerospace Division, the 96th BW, and the 578th Strategic Missile Squadron. Several of the 578th&#x27;s Altas F Silos are located near the Nike sites. The Army Air Defense Command Post was located 37 miles west at Sweetwater AFS. Both of the sites were located near former Army posts. Camp Barkeley served as a World War II infantry division training center, while Fort Phantom Hill was a frontier outpost and stop on the Butterfield stage route.

Since 1961, various models of C-130 Hercules aircraft have been stationed at Dyess AFB. The C-130s were originally assigned to the 64th Troop Carrier Wing (TCW) and from 1963 to 1972, the 516th Troop Carrier Wing was the host C-130 wing. In 1972, the 516 TCW was replaced with the 463d Tactical Airlift Wing (463 TAW). During the Vietnam War, TAC C-130 crews routinely rotated to forward based C-130 wings in the Pacific theater to support operations in Vietnam. In 1974, the 463 TAW was reassigned from Tactical Air Command to Military Airlift Command (MAC) as part of a USAF-wide initiative to place both strategic and tactical airlift assets under MAC control.

From 1962 to 1965, Dyess Air Force Base had 12 SM-65 Atlas missile sites stationed around it. The Dyess sites were operated by the 578th Strategic Missile Squadron. After being decommissioned in 1965, the Atlas missiles were removed and all sites demilitarized.

In June 1985, the 96th received its first B-1B Lancer replacing the B-52 Stratofortress, and in October 1986, assumed nuclear alert status. Since achieving IOC, Dyess has been recognized as the premier bomber-training center and leads the fleet in maintaining the highest mission capability status of its aircraft, avionics test stations and support equipment. Shortly after, the Soviet Union fell and left many wondering the fate of the base. In 1991, the 463d Tactical Airlift Wing was simply designated the 463d Airlift Wing (463 AW). In October 1992, the parent commands of both wings changed. The 96 BW was reassigned to the newly established Air Combat Command, and the 463 AW was assigned to the new Air Mobility Command.

===The 1990s===
On 1 October 1993, the 96 BW and 463 AW were both inactivated and replaced by the 7th Wing, a former B-52 and KC-135 wing that had been located at the former Carswell AFB, which was being realigned as NAS Fort Worth JRB/Carswell ARS as a result of Base Realignment and Closure action. The 7th Wing incorporated Dyess&#x27; B-1Bs and C-130s, the latter which transferred from Air Mobility Command to Air Combat Command.

Within its first year, the 7th Wing&#x27;s diverse mission made it one of the most active units in the United States Air Force. The C-130s were deployed around the globe performing several airlift missions to Europe and the Persian Gulf. The crews and support people of the B-1s focused on enhancing the purpose of the Lancer in a post-Soviet 21st century.

In 1997, Dyess&#x27; C-130s were transferred back to Air Mobility Command, and the 317th Airlift Group was reactivated as the parent unit for Dyess&#x27; C-130 squadrons. At the same time, the 7th Wing was redesignated the 7th Bomb Wing. Despite this separation as units, both the 7th Bomb Wing and the 317th Airlift Group remained at Dyess.

One of the many unique features of Dyess is its extensive collection of static military aircraft on display. Collectively known as the &quot;Dyess Linear Air Park&quot;, it contains 34 aircraft, 7 inert ordinances and one model from World War II to the present, many of them formerly based at Dyess, and is located along the base&#x27;s main road, Arnold Blvd. All but one plane has been flown before. Its most recent addition is the first operational B-1B Lancer, known as &quot;The Star of Abilene&quot;, which made its final flight in 2003. It can be seen at the front gate to Dyess along with a recently retired C-130 Hercules located on the other side of the road (a tribute to the two main aircraft currently housed at Dyess).

Another unique feature of Dyess is its main source of energy. In January 2003, Dyess became the first Department of Defense installation in the United States to be powered exclusively from renewable wind energy. Today, most of the energy Dyess receives is from other sources of renewable energy, such as biomass, and is considered one of the &quot;greenest&quot; bases in the USAF.

The remnants of Tye AAF can still be seen today. Parts of the old runway still exist, as well as part of its parking area on the west side of Dyess.

===Global War on Terrorism===
The 7th Bomb Wing and 317th Airlift Group were called to duty once again shortly after 11 September 2001. Both played and continue to play vital roles in both Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Many of the 7th BW&#x27;s B-1s and support personnel deploy to Southwest Asia. From there, the 7 BW provides close air support to troops in the field and precision strike missions with the B-1B Lancer. The 317th Airlift Group has been deployed continuously to Southwest Asia since December 2003, where the group provides airlift support to OIF, OEF, and Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa operations.

On 1 October 2015, Dyess became part of Global Strike Command.

== Role and operations ==
The host unit at Dyess is the 7th Bomb Wing of the Global Strike Command, which was activated on 1 October 1993. The wing performs combat training with the Boeing B-1B Lancer bomber and is the USAF&#x27;s premier operational B-1B unit with 36 aircraft.

The wing consists of these groups:

* 7th Operations Group (Tail Code: &quot;DY&quot;) - Responsible for executing global conventional bombing directed by proper command authority, it is the Air Force&#x27;s largest B-1 operations group comprising 36 B-1s.

**28th Bomb Squadron (B-1B) (blue/white chex tail stripe)
**9th Bomb Squadron (B-1B) (black tail stripe with a white bat silhouette centered on the tail stripe)
** 7th Operations Support Squadron
* 7th Mission Support Group
* 7th Maintenance Group
* 7th Medical Group

The 317th Airlift Wing (317 AW), an Air Mobility Command tenant unit, performs Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules airlift missions with 28 aircraft assigned. The wing is now the largest C-130J unit in the world.

The 317th AW consists of these squadrons:

*39th Airlift Squadron &quot;Trail Blazers&quot; (C-130J) (&quot;Dyess&quot; Texas state flag tail stripe)
*40th Airlift Squadron &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot; (C-130J) (&quot;Dyess&quot; Texas state flag tail stripe)
* 317th Maintenance Squadron

<text>Stephen Herbert Perrin (January 22, 1946 – August 13, 2021) was an American game designer and technical writer/editor, best known for creating the tabletop role-playing game &quot;RuneQuest&quot; for Chaosium.

==Early life and education==
Perrin earned a Bachelor of Arts in English from San Francisco State University. Perrin was a founding member in 1966 of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA).

==Early career and Chaosium==

One of his first contributions to the world of RPGs was &quot;The Perrin Conventions&quot; in 1976, an alternative set of combat rules for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, which led to his work on &quot;RuneQuest&quot;. Perrin wanted more involvement in the role-playing game industry, and with Jeff Pimper he talked to Chaosium about developing a creature book based on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, which they published as &quot;All the Worlds&#x27; Monsters&quot; (1977), and was released before the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; from TSR. Perrin later worked with Steve Henderson and Warren James on an idea for an original gaming system to be used with the world of Glorantha after a previous design team failed to produce a supplement to an existing game, and Ray Turney from the original team soon joined them; this new RPG was finally published in 1978 as &quot;RuneQuest&quot;.

Perrin officially joined Chaosium in 1981, although he only stayed with the company for a few years. He was one of several authors who contributed to their licensed &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; (1981) supplement. Perrin designed &quot;Worlds of Wonder&quot; (1982), which was the third game released by Chaosium using their &quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot; system (&quot;BRP&quot;). &quot;Superworld&quot; was originally one of worlds designed for &quot;Worlds of Wonder&quot; and was then published as its own game in 1983, although it was merely moderately successful and Perrin later admitted its similarity to &quot;Champions&quot; from Hero Games. In 1984 he wrote the &quot;BRP&quot; based &quot;Elfquest&quot;, based on the &quot;Elfquest&quot; comic book. While at Chaosium he also created &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, and contributed to &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;.

==Later career==
Hero Games published its sixth RPG, &quot;Robot Warriors&quot; (1986), by Perrin. He also wrote the 1987 &quot;Champions&quot; role-playing game supplement &quot;The Voice of Doom&quot;.

He worked at Interplay Productions, Maxis, and Spectrum Holobyte, doing game design, playtesting, and writing manuals for such computer games as &quot;Mechanized Assault &amp; Exploration&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Starfleet Academy&quot;, and &quot;Descent to Undermountain&quot;. He also worked freelance for many of the major companies in the games industry including TSR, FASA, Hero Games, West End Games, and Iron Crown Enterprises.

&quot;Steve Perrin&#x27;s Quest Rules&quot; (SPQR) was sold independently through Chaos Limited. In 2004, he collaborated with Taldren on &quot;Black 9 Ops&quot;, which Perrin decided to make available for free.

In 2010, Perrin began creating PDF adventures for the games &quot;Icons&quot; and &quot;Mutants &amp; Masterminds&quot;, and completed several scenarios for Vigilance Press and Fainting Goat Press. In 2019, he returned to Chaosium as a creative consultant. In 2020, he contributed to the &quot;Wild Cards&quot; novel &quot;American Hero&quot;.

On August 13, 2021, Chaosium announced Perrin&#x27;s death.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
While Sean Cassidy was working on a deep undercover mission for Interpol, his wife Maeve gave birth to their daughter, Theresa, at Cassidy Keep, County Mayo, Ireland. Maeve later dies in an IRA bombing, and with no means to contact Sean, his cousin Tom takes care of Theresa. When Sean returns and learns of his wife&#x27;s death, he is devastated. Before Tom can tell him about Theresa, Sean lashes out at Tom with his sonic scream for not having taken better care of Maeve. As Sean flies away in anger, Tom falls into a chasm and breaks his leg, leaving him with a limp. Tom swears to make Sean pay and vows to never tell him about his daughter, and raises her himself.

Tom (now known as Black Tom) trains Theresa as his apprentice in his criminal activities. As a young teen, she accompanies him and his then-partner, the Juggernaut, to San Francisco. She takes the name Siryn, aids them in a vibranium theft, and battles the original Spider-Woman. Due to her inexperience, she performs poorly in battle and is defeated by Spider-Woman again during Black Tom&#x27;s temporary capture. Initially believing her to be seriously hurt, Black Tom resolves to break all association with her so that she will not be exposed to further danger. While in custody, he absolves Theresa of all responsibility for her crimes, and writes a letter to Sean explaining who she is. The X-Men bring Theresa back to their headquarters, where she is joyfully reunited with her father.

===Muir Island===

Theresa moves to Muir Island, home of the research laboratories of Moira MacTaggert, a longtime ally of Professor Xavier. During an overnight visit to Xavier Institute, Siryn, Kitty Pryde, Illyana Rasputin, and a young Muir Island resident named Amp battle robotic duplicates of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants after accidentally releasing them from the Danger Room. Later in the evening, Siryn gets into a fist fight with Kitty after Amp convinces her that Kitty was trying to sabotage her chances with a young man named Dimitri. After the fight is broken up by Wolverine, the girls reconcile and leave on friendly terms. She also accompanies Wolverine and Kitty when they are asked by Professor Xavier to act as bodyguards for the mutant pop-star Dazzler. Dazzler is impressed with Theresa&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and asks her to act as a backing vocalist for her concert.

On the island, Siryn starts a romantic relationship with Jamie Madrox. This version of Multiple Man is revealed to be one of his many duplicates and not the original Multiple Man, leading to the end of the relationship. During this time Siryn and Multiple Man travel to New York City. She and Madrox search for two members of the New Mutants: Sunspot and Warlock, who had run away from the school. Siryn and Multiple Man find Sunspot and meet the association of street-level mutants known as the Fallen Angels, and they are all transported to Devil Dinosaur&#x27;s planet. They travel to the Coconut Grove, the home planet of the alien Ariel. While there, her superhuman powers are neutralized and she is made a captive by Unipar. She regains her superhuman powers and returns to Earth. She chooses to remain in the Fallen Angels for some time to help reform their criminal members.

Back on Muir Island, she briefly falls under the mental control of the Shadow King.

===X-Force===
Siryn becomes a core member of X-Force, a paramilitary superhero team and for a time was its field leader. As a member of X-Force, her teammate Warpath develops a romantic interest in her while she begins flirting with Deadpool. Deadpool and Siryn become involved when the two fight Black Tom Cassidy and the Juggernaut. Although Banshee warns Siryn that Deadpool is a madman and a murderer, she finds Deadpool attractive, and the feelings are reciprocated. Over time, Siryn becomes the voice of reason and sanity in Deadpool&#x27;s ear. She assists him in some of his missions, such as when Deadpool felt he needed blood from the Hulk to cure problems with his own healing powers. In the end Siryn becomes overwhelmed with balancing her duties with X-Force and the demands of Deadpool&#x27;s mental health. She promises him that she would consider progressing their relationship if he continues on the path of good, and once she has her X-Force responsibilities secured. Warpath continues to seek Siryn&#x27;s affections, and makes his dislike for Deadpool clear during a visit to the baseball diamond used in &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;.

Siryn confronts various adversaries during her time in X-Force: she puts down a coup in Asgard, and confronts Onslaught, Mojo, and S.H.I.E.L.D. on more than one occasion. Warpath helps her cope with her drinking problems, eventually leading her to become sober.

She becomes a vital part of the team, as opined by an aspect of Charles Xavier, which saves the entire team from a near-death experience.

She leaves when Feral, a former teammate turned villain, slashes her throat, destroying her vocal cords and rendering her temporarily mute and powerless.

===X-Corporation===
Deadpool tracks down Wolverine and steals a sample of his blood to heal Siryn, who regains the use of her vocal cords.

Siryn joins the Paris branch of X-Corporation, claiming to atone for her father&#x27;s sins for his failed X-Corps idea, where she reunites with Multiple Man, Rictor and Cannonball. She works with Monet St. Croix for the first time. Their first mission does not go well and Siryn deals with the loss of her teammate, Darkstar.

===X-Factor Investigations===
Siryn leaves X-Corporation to become a member of X-Factor Investigations. As part of her initial duties for X-Factor Investigations, she investigates the murder of a woman who died in a movie star&#x27;s penthouse, on behalf of the victim&#x27;s sister. A rival firm, Singularity Investigations, represents the actor with Damian Tryp as the defense counsel. Siryn and X-Factor Investigations manage to incriminate the star and thwart Singularity Investigation&#x27;s assassination attempt on Rictor. Tryp later ambushes Siryn and beats her, leaving her to die in an alley. She is later found and taken hostage by a mentally ill former mutant only to be rescued by Rictor.

While recovering from her injuries, Cyclops approaches Theresa and informs her Banshee has died. She goes into a state of denial, holding on to how many X-Men have been believed dead have returned alive.

During &quot;Civil War&quot;, Theresa opposes the registration act and is tasked with contacting more high-profile superheroes about the Decimation. After speaking with Spider-Man, X-Factor gets into contact with Quicksilver and Cyclops&#x27; team of X-Men, demanding they answer why the reason behind the Decimation was kept secret and defy the registration act.

Siryn&#x27;s relationships with Multiple Man and Monet become strained. After spending a night drinking, Madrox awakens to learn that he and one of his duplicates slept with Theresa and Monet. Although he is initially uncertain as to which was which, he concludes with near certainty that he slept with Theresa, and the dupe slept with Monet, though this does little to assuage Theresa and Monet&#x27;s anger. Theresa resolves her differences with both Madrox and Monet, and the two women develop a budding friendship after a shopping trip to Paris and partner together on later missions.

Siryn and Monet are sent to retrieve two famous child singers (who specialize in mutant hate songs) from their parents. The two are ambushed, knocked out, and kidnapped by the children&#x27;s mutant bodyguards, Solo and Clay. They awake imprisoned, but they both escape and return the children to their grandparents. It is revealed that the entire mission was a ruse by Josef Huber to lure the women away from their X-Factor teammates, as both Monet and Siryn&#x27;s mental-based powers negatively affect Huber&#x27;s mind-control abilities.

===Messiah Complex===
Theresa assists Rictor&#x27;s infiltration of the Purifiers and accompanies the X-Men to rescue the mutant baby and X-Force. She later receives a call from Peepers, who is being pursued by Predator X, but Theresa arrives too late to help him and finds his remains. Siryn prays at Madrox&#x27;s bedside when he awakes, and takes part in the X-Men&#x27;s assault on the Marauders&#x27; base with Monet and Guido, fighting Exodus in the battle.

===Divided We Stand===
Siryn reveals that she is pregnant with Jamie&#x27;s child, and after talking with Monet reveals she intends to keep it. When she attempts to tell Jamie he mistakenly believes that she wants to quit X-Factor. Monet later helps Siryn realize that she still loves Jamie. Siryn tries to tell him again, but Arcade appears and destroys Mutant Town. Afterwards, Jamie reveals he knows she is pregnant and the team moves to Detroit, Michigan, to get away from Val Cooper and O*N*E.

===Sean===
After moving to Detroit, Theresa becomes inactive during X-Factor&#x27;s field missions. She gets into an argument with Val upon finding out X-Factor has been under the employ of O*N*E since the destruction of Mutant Town. Val reveals her interest in Theresa&#x27;s child and during a heated discussion, Theresa&#x27;s water breaks and she is taken to a hospital. As Theresa goes into labor, she proposes to Jamie, who accepts. She gives birth to a boy, and they name him Sean after her father, whose death she finally accepts. Hours after his birth, baby Sean is absorbed into Jamie&#x27;s body as Jamie holds him, to his horror. Theresa attempts to save the baby and claws at Jamie&#x27;s chest to get him back but pops some of her stitches and goes back into surgery. Jamie reveals Sean was an &quot;infant dupe&quot;, and was absorbed into him as a duplicate would, but Theresa declares that she would break his neck the next time she sees him after breaking his fingers.

===Assuming leadership and departure===
After the pregnancy, Jamie leaves the team and Theresa takes charge, though she sinks into a depression. Following Jamie&#x27;s return to the present, he offers to leave the team headquarters in Detroit and start a branch with Guido in New York. She disbands the Detroit team, with the remaining members defecting to the New York branch. Theresa returns home to Ireland where she runs into Reverend John Maddox, one of Jamie&#x27;s dupes, who helps her cope with depression. She later has a one-night stand with Deadpool. After coming to terms with Banshee&#x27;s death and reconciling her grief, Theresa retires the codename Siryn and takes her deceased father&#x27;s codename as her own, calling herself Banshee in honor of his memory.

===Return to X-Factor Investigations===
After Cable and Hope Summers return to the present during &quot;X-Men: Second Coming&quot;, agents of the Mutant Response Division target Theresa for assassination when she attempts to return to America. She is rescued by Layla Miller and Shatterstar, and they teleport back to America and rejoin X-Factor in the final battle with the Mutant Response Division.

Afterwards, Jamie accepts a new assignment from a disguised Hela, who is searching for a missing pendant of Thor&#x27;s hammer. When Jamie and Theresa track it down and take it off of the neck of a drunken bar patron, he reveals he is Pip the Troll. After a brief fight, Hela appears, captures Pip, and teleports back to her base in Las Vegas. The team travel to Las Vegas and with the help of Thor, retrieve Pip from Hela&#x27;s domain.

The team is later hired by J. Jonah Jameson when an old friend of his is killed. Thinking the murderer may come after him, Theresa acts as his personal bodyguard. During a protest, Theresa receives an image of the murderer, who is revealed to be a woman named Ballistique. At that moment, Theresa sees Ballistique talking to J. Jonah Jameson and tries to attack by launching a powerful sonic scream at her but due to Ballistique&#x27;s close proximity to Jameson, the police think Theresa is attempting to attack Jameson. The police attempt to stop Theresa by attacking her with their nightsticks but not before she can warn Monet about Ballistique. During the ordeal, Guido is seriously wounded, and Monet takes him to the hospital where Theresa attempts to console her.

Theresa and the rest of X-Factor later become the target of various mystical canine and feline deities who attempt to capture Wolfsbane and her unborn baby. After the baby is born, it attempts to attack Theresa and Jamie but not knowing it is Rahne&#x27;s son, Theresa uses one of her screams to blast it away from the duo. Later, while tracking a demon by the name of Bloodbath, Theresa witnesses it kill Jamie. After it is revealed Layla can bring back the dead, minus their soul, Theresa has no problems in asking Layla to return Jamie, putting her at odds with Monet for a while.

After Havok and Polaris rejoin X-Factor, Theresa is present when Layla reveals Jamie has come back from the dead but not by her doing. After returning from one of X-Factor&#x27;s missions, Theresa and Polaris share concern for Wolfsbane&#x27;s wellbeing as she barely comes out of her room unless it is for missions. The two women decide to take Rahne on a road trip to Reverend John Maddox to help her. During the trip, Theresa and Lorna bond and develop a friendship.

===The Morrigan===
Wolverine learns that a woman matching Theresa&#x27;s description has been attacking and killing people in Ulster County, New York. Pairing up with Havok, the two investigate the murders. Upon questioning the family of the murder victims, Theresa notices two photos featuring the family&#x27;s grandmother and granddaughter, both wearing triquetras. Although she first believes the little girl to be a mutant, Theresa realizes the girl is not when she summons a Celtic goddess, the Morrigan. The girl attempts to send the Morrigan back but she ignores the girl and takes Theresa, furious that she has been using the name Banshee, one of the many names associated with the Morrigan. The Morrigan takes Theresa to a lighthouse and offers her a choice: apologize and worship her, or die. Theresa rejects the Morrigan&#x27;s offer and is thrown to her death as her vocal cords had been weakened by the ordeal. Havok arrives to see Theresa falling to her doom when she is rescued by a demon named Jezabel. Havok destroys the lighthouse, leaving the Morrigan trapped under rubble. Jezebel advises them the apocalypse is coming and Theresa will have to make a tough choice sometime within the near future: to become part of a race of new gods or perish with the rest of humanity.

Over the next few days, Theresa considers drinking alcohol to help deal with what is going on when she is stopped by her father. Unsure if he is real, she attempts to seek help from the other members of X-Factor only to find Polaris has lost her mind. Theresa goes back to her room, where she continues to converse with Sean about the Morrigan and if he is real or some kind of hallucination when Layla enters, who reveals she knows what is going on. Theresa and Layla attempt to summon the Morrigan but Theresa is teleported to Ireland instead. During the confrontation, Theresa asks if the Morrigan can heal Lorna but the Morrigan advises her she cannot, as Lorna does not believe in her. The Morrigan reveals she is tired of being a goddess and misses her own father; if Theresa wants to help Lorna, she must become the Morrigan. Theresa agrees and hurls a sonic lance through the Morrigan, killing her. In that moment, Lorna is completely healed of her insanity. Theresa teleports back to headquarters, appearing before Jamie as the Morrigan and telling him goodbye. Theresa lets him know she never stopped loving him and if he needs her, all he has to do is pray before departing.

After Jamie is transformed into a demon, he takes her up on this offer so she rescues and transforms him back into human form. She then asks the now-married Madrox and Layla if they want to reform the team but, they decline saying that they have a farm to start up and a baby on the way.

===House of X===
Theresa Cassidy, back in her mortal form, is seen on Krakoa reunited with her father. During the celebration after the Quiet Council&#x27;s first meeting, she uses her sonic powers in conjunction with Dazzler&#x27;s light abilities to put on a light show for the people.

==Powers and abilities==
Theresa Cassidy possesses the ability to emit high-decibel sonic screams to create various sonic effects with her vocal cords. She can vary the pitch to deflect projectiles. She possesses an enhanced sense of hearing and can use her voice to detect objects via echolocation. Siryn is able to fly at the speed of sound while screaming. She has potent sonic attacks that can shatter objects, project concussive blasts of sonic force (a &quot;sonic lance&quot;). and cause immediate pain, nausea and vomiting, and unconsciousness. She has shown a degree of resistance to sounds and vibrations that would be harmful or painful to normal humans and mutants without sonic-based powers. Theresa Cassidy is able to influence and control other human beings with her sonic voice, and cause them to enter a hypnotic state. She can cause the intended person to fall in love with her without regard to gender or sexual orientation and carry out her wishes and commands, like mythical Sirens. Theresa Cassidy once used this ability on Spider-Man, forcing him to divulge the truth about the Decimation of the mutants. She can prevent others from hearing external sounds by a certain vocal pitch so that she can secretly deliver messages to them.

Theresa Cassidy gained numerous undefined mystical abilities when she killed the Morrigan. Her known powers include the ability to teleport by her own free will or to people who summon her using the correct ritual, heal her followers and people with a personal bond to her, and some form of immortality or longevity. She is able to revert Jamie to his human form and absorb laser blasts from a gun that can destroy Layla Miller&#x27;s force field.

<text>is a rural district in Miyagi Prefecture, in the Tōhoku region of northern Japan.

At present, the district consists only of the town of Minamisanriku with a combined population () of 11,860 people, a population density of 72.6 people per km2 and an area of . All of the city of Kesennuma and a small part of the city of Tome and part of the city of Ishinomaki were formerly part of the district.

==History==
Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the district was within Mutsu Province and was under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain. In 1869, following the Meiji restoration, Mutsu Province was divided, with the area of Motoyoshi District becoming part of Rikuzen Province, and from 1872, part of Miyagi Prefecture. In the establishment of the modern municipalities system, the district was organized into one town (Kesennuma (気仙沼)) and sixteen villages (Nusazaki (麻崎村), Yokoyama (横山村), Jusanhama (十三浜村), Tokura (戸倉村), Iriya (入谷村), Motoyoshi (本吉村), Utatsu (歌津町), Koizumi (小泉村), Mitake (御嶽村), Oya (大谷村), Hashigami (階上村), Matsuiwa (松岩村), Niizuki (新月村), Shishiori (鹿折), Karakura (唐桑村), Oshima (大島村)).

*October 31, 1894: The village of Motoyoshi was elevated to town status and renamed Shizugawa (志津川町)
*November 1, 1906: The village of Nusazaki was elevated to town status and renamed Yanaizu (柳津町)
*November 3, 1941: The village of Mitake was elevated to town status and renamed Tsuya (津谷町)
*April 1, 1951: The village of Shishiori was elevated to town status
*June 1, 1953: Shishiori and the village of Matsuiwa merge with Kesennuma
*February 11, 1955: The village of Karakuwa was elevated to town status
*March 1, 1955: The villages of Tokura and Iriya merge with Shizugawa town.
*March 30, 1955: The town of Tsuya and villages of Koizumi and Oya merge to for the two o Motoyoshi (本吉町); the village of Jusanhama was transferred to Monou District
*April 1, 1955: The villages of Niizuki, Hashikami and Oshima merge form the town of Utatsu (歌津町)
*On April 1, 2005, the town of Tsuyama merged with the eight other towns of the former Tome District to form the city of Tome.
*On October 1, 2005, the town of Shizugawa and the town of Utatsu merged to form the new town of Minamisanriku.
*On March 31, 2006, the town of Karakuwa merged into the city of Kesennuma.
*On September 1, 2009, the town of Motoyoshi merged into the city of Kesennuma.

Motoyoshi District was devastated by the magnitude 9.0 March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami which occurred off the coast of Japan; an estimated 9,500 people are reported missing from the town of Minamisanriku alone. Early estimates indicate that this could represent as much as 90% of the total casualties in Japan.

<text>Red Shi&#x27;sm vs. Black Shi&#x27;ism is an essay written by the Iranian author Ali Shariati which discusses his ideas on the perceived dual aspects of the Shi&#x27;a religion throughout history. &quot;Red Shi&#x27;ism&quot;, which he sees as the pure form of the religion, is concerned with social justice and salvation for the masses and is devoid of idolatrous rituals and established clergy. &quot;Black Shi&#x27;ism&quot;, which he sees as the deviated form of the religion, falls under the domination of both monarchy and clergy, out of touch with the needs of the masses, and which came to be established in Iran under the Safavids.

It must be known that the Safavid dynasty did not form the idea of &quot;Black Shi&#x27;ism&quot;, but that this idea was formed after the defeat of Shah Ismail against the Ottoman leader Yavuz Sultan Selim. &quot;Black Shi&#x27;ism&quot; is a product of the Post-Safavid-Period.

<doc id="898240" wikidata="Q6368168" url="?curid=898240" title="Karakuwa, Miyagi">
<text>was a town located in Motoyoshi District, in the extreme northeast of Miyagi Prefecture, bordering Kesennuma to the north-west and Rikuzentakata, part of Iwate Prefecture, to the north, and with Kesennuma Bay including Oshima island to the west, Hirota Bay to the north-east, and the Pacific Ocean to the south and east.

On March 31, 2006, Karakuwa was merged into the expanded city of Kesennuma and is no longer an independent municipality.

The highest point in former Karakuwa is Sasanagane-yama (笹長根山 meaning &#x27;bamboo grass with long roots mountain&#x27;) (520 m), near the border with Rikuzentakata, and the lowest point is sea level.

==Name origin==
Karakuwa&#x27;s name (唐桑) literally means &quot;China (Tang dynasty, specifically) Mulberry&quot;, and has been used to refer to the area back to the times when it was part of a larger Kesen District in Mutsu Province. According to the story of where the name came from, a Chinese shipwrecked on the rocky coast, and in its hold was a mulberry tree. The tree was rescued and planted, and it survived and spread to become common in the area, as did the legend.

==History==
Around 700 A.D., there is record of Emishi presenting local marine products at the Imperial Court, which may have encouraged immigration to the area. The area remained peaceful during the Nara period, due to the powerful influence of the Minamoto clan. However, during the Heian period, the Minamotos were defeated by Taira no Kiyomori in the Heiji rebellion. The Kasai Clan received the region but were left heirless near the end of the Azuchi–Momoyama period. After the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, the area was given to Date Masamune as part of his lands.

During the Meiji Restoration, it was taken from the Date clan as punishment for their involvement and given to the Takasaki Clan to administer, becoming part of Motoyoshi District in 1868, then becoming part of several short-lived prefectures before finally becoming part of Miyagi Prefecture on April 18, 1876.

In 1889, the two villages in the area, Karakuwa and Koharagi (小原木 meaning &#x27;small, original tree&#x27;) merged to form a larger village called Karakuwa, then incorporated into a town in 1955.

In 2004 and 2005, there were discussions with Motoyoshi and Kesennuma regarding a merge to create a larger city. Although Motoyoshi withdrew from the talks, an agreement to merge was made with Kesennuma. On March 31, 2006, Karakuwa ceased to exist as a separate town.

==Geography==
The town center was located at the base of a rocky peninsula which juts out into the Pacific Ocean, a small extension of the north–south running mountains in the area. Most of the underlying rock is granite, though there is significant marble as well. These hard rock mountains make the land an abundance of sharp hills and valleys, and also give the area many small bays. There is some farmland, but the hills make large open fields impossible.

Like much of Japan, Karakuwa is prone to earthquakes. Large earthquakes with centers in the ocean from those off western Hokkaido to those off to Oshika peninsula to the south have been felt in the area. Tsunami can also be a danger; in recent times, large waves hit the area after a local earthquake in 1896, and after the Chilean earthquake of 1960.

The peninsula area of the former town, from the town center to the south-east is about long, and about wide. The town extended another up the coastline to include the Koharagi area, and along the coast facing Oshima island. There are a few small streams along the peninsula, the largest stretching inland towards Sasanagane-yama, which lies another kilometer (0.6 miles) beyond the streams source at the widest point in Karakuwa.

==Economy==
The local economy has some mixed farming, including a few apple orchards, but due to the rocky granite and marble coastline, which favours small ports over farmland, the focus is on commercial deep-sea fishing. There is also some commercial activity in processing the catch, and the rugged beauty of the coastline encourages significant tourism.

==Education==
There are three elementary schools and two junior high schools in former Karakuwa. Nakai (中井小学校 -shōgakkō) and Karakuwa Elementary in the south feed Karakuwa Junior High, and in the north Koharagi Elementary students go to Koharagi Junior High. There were no high schools in the town; students must go to Kesennuma, Rikuzentakata or farther to continue their education.

==Transportation==
*Route 45, to Sendai via Kesennuma, major highway
*Route 26, to Kesennuma, older, winding highway
*Route 239, connects Route 45 and 26 along the east coast of the Karakuwa peninsula
*JR East Kesennuma Line (rail), to Maeyachi Station in Ishinomaki with connections to Sendai from Kesennuma Station in Kesennuma
*JR East Ōfunato Line (rail), to Ichinoseki Station in Ichinoseki and Sakari Station in Ōfunato from Shishiori-Karakuwa Station or Kesennuma Station in Kesennuma.
(Note: There are no train stations in Karakuwa itself.)

==Tourist attractions==
* is located off Route 26, on the east coast of the Karakuwa peninsula. It is a park area with walking trails along the rugged, dark marble of the coastline. The feature attraction and the former town&#x27;s symbol, Oreishi (折石), is here, a marble column rising from the ocean which stands 16 m tall and 3 m wide. Prior to the Sanriku tsunami breaking off the top in 1896, it stood an additional 2 m taller.
* is located at the end of Route 26 at the southernmost tip of the Karakuwan peninsula. A large shrine is here, with paths with branches entwined above and more views of the rocky coastline. A connecting path leads up the coast to eventually join with Oogama-Hanzou. The Karakuwa Tsunami Museum is located in the same area. Built in 1984, it&#x27;s billed as the only place in Japan where you can feel the simulated experience of a tsunami.
* is located off Route 26. Isaribi Park contains the highest point on the Karakuwan peninsula, a restaurant, gift shop, small playground and go-kart track are at the base. A short climb to the top reveals a small shrine and a lookout that allows views of the Karakuwan peninsula to the south, Oshima island and Kesennuma to the west, and Iwate to the northeast.
* is located off Highway 26 between the former town centre and Kesennuma, with an approximately three-kilometre walk from the access point to the beach. The beach is so named because the mixed porcelain, granite, and sandstone of the beach is said to make a &#x27;kyuu-kyuu&#x27; or &#x27;ku-ku&#x27; sound when walked on. (Kyuu (きゅう) and ku (く) are the two pronunciations of the number nine (九) in Japanese.)
* is located off Highway 45 close to the Miyagi-Iwate border. The coastline of this area features white marble, contrasting the darker colours found in most of the area.
* The entire coastline of Karakuwa forms part of Rikuchu Coast National Park. (陸中海岸国立公園)

<text>was a town located in Motoyoshi District, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan.

In 2003, the town had an estimated population of 5,501 and a population density of 139.34 persons per km2. The total area was 39.48 km2.

On October 1, 2005, Utatsu merged with the town of Shizugawa (also from Motoyoshi District) to create the town of Minamisanriku, and no longer exists as an independent municipality.

In 2003, the town had an estimated population of 11,716 and a population density of 109.80 persons per km2. The total area was 106.70 km2.

Motoyoshi was divided into four districts: Magome, Koizumi, Tsuya, and Ohya. Koizumi and Ohya were both home to spectacular beaches until the disaster of March 11. Tsuya constitutes &quot;downtown&quot; Motoyoshi. Fishing and farming are the main industries though a printing company is also a large local employer. Motoyoshi, like many of Japan&#x27;s smaller towns, had a declining population as young people increasingly moved to the large regional cities of Kesennuma and Sendai, or further South to Tokyo.

The Motoyoshi Board of Education also employs Assistant Language Teachers (ALTs) that teach English at the local Elementary and Junior High Schools.

A planned merger of municipalities was implemented on September 1, 2009; Motoyoshi was merged into the expanded city of Kesennuma.

<text>Faroe–Soviet Friendship Association (Danish: &quot;Færøsk-Sovjetisk Venskabsforening&quot;), was a pro-USSR organization in the Faroe Islands founded in 1979, as a section of &quot;Landsforeningen Danmark-Sovjetunionen&quot; (National Association Denmark-Soviet Union). The chairman of the association was Andreas S. Højgaard, who was not a declared Communist. The association arranged cultural exchanges and study trips to the Soviet Union. As of 1983, it had 100 members.

In 1978, Højgaard, the rector of the teacher&#x27;s seminary in Tórshavn, was invited to visit the Soviet Union with his brother and 20 other Danish citizens. Following the trip, he contacted the Denmark–Soviet national association for help in organising a chapter in the Faroe Islands. The Faroe–Soviet Friendship Association was established in November 1979. 

In 2000, Danish historian Bent Jensen was commissioned by the Faroese government to conduct research into &quot;The Faroe Islands during the Cold War&quot;, including the history of the Faroe–Soviet Friendship Association.

<text>Addu City is a city in Maldives that consists of the inhabited islands of Addu Atoll, the southernmost atoll of the archipelago. Addu City is the second-largest urban area in Maldives, in terms of population, and is one of the two urban areas to get the status of &quot;city&quot; other than the capital city, Malé, and Fuvahmulah. Addu City has 6 districts. They are Hithadhoo, Maradhoo-Feydhoo, Maradhoo, Feydhoo, Meedhoo and Hulhudhoo. These divisions are naturally islands, but are well connected. In addition, Addu Atoll has other uninhabited islands.

==History==
===Beginnings===

Addu is one of the oldest populated atoll in the country with the Island of Meedhoo having traces of settlements as far back as 2000 BCE.

The original settlers are said to be from Western regions of Gujarat and Bihar state of modern-day India.

===Britain&#x27;s secret base===
In August 1941, the netlayer HMS &quot;Guardian&quot; landed Royal Navy construction crews on Addu Atoll in the Maldives Islands to begin work on a secret naval base for Britain&#x27;s Eastern Fleet. Though in public British leaders continued to point to Singapore as the lynchpin of the Far Eastern defenses, they had already grown concerned that the “Malay Barrier” of Malaya, Sumatra and Java could not be held in the event of a Japanese attack.

The British Eastern Fleet had left most of its base facilities in Singapore, including drydocks and repair sheds. In the event of Singapore&#x27;s loss, it was to fall back on Trincomalee on Ceylon&#x27;s eastern coast. But Admiral James Somerville, the fleet commander, found the port inadequate and doubted that it could be defended from determined attack. He wanted an alternative base somewhere in the middle of the Indian Ocean, which became known as “Port T.” Not openly stated, but understood, was that such a secret island base would also be secure from the prying eyes of Indian nationalists, all of whom were suspected of being in league with the Japanese during the paranoid days of late 1941.

Addu Atoll, also known as Seenu, is the southernmost island group in the Maldives. It consists of several large islands ringing a deep lagoon. There are several channels leading into the lagoon, with the best of these at the southern end of the atoll. The Royal Navy selected the southernmost island, Gan (pronounced &quot;Yahn&quot;) for their airfield and began construction of three crushed-coral airstrips for the Fleet Air Arm. This was turned over to the Royal Air Force in 1957 and became “RAF Station Gan,” an airfield that would be used intermittently until 1971. The FAA airfield on Gan in theory could handle all aircraft in the British inventory, but it had short runways and larger bombers often crashed on landing.

While troops hacked down the jungle on Gan and prepared the airstrips, Catalina and Sunderland flying boats began operating from the jetties on the north shore of Gan. The airfield&#x27;s most important facilities were the big oil tanks built on Gan and on Hitaddu Island on the western edge of the atoll. These would by necessity be visible from far out at sea, but the islands’ low elevation made this inevitable, no matter where they were placed.

The 1st Royal Marine Coast Defence Regiment provided the garrison troops, manning shore batteries and anti-aircraft guns on all six of the atoll&#x27;s major islands. To facilitate the defence, the important islands on the western edge of the atoll would eventually be linked by a light railway across causeways built up between the islands, but this was not operational until much later in the war. Except for the Gan Channel, the other openings were permanently closed by anti-submarine nets.

A pair of Australian refrigerator ships were requisitioned in Sydney, loaded with canned foods, several tons of American-made cigarettes and 5,200 gallons of rum, and stationed in the lagoon to re-supply British warships. These had Chinese crews and Australian civilian officers, and most of the work was handled by Maldivians hired from the local population.

Addu Atoll has since become a major tourist destination, but British personnel assigned there in 1942 despised the post. Morale appears to have been very low among the garrison, and ships’ crews considered it a hardship post. Forty miles south of the equator, the islands are very hot and extremely humid. Gan had no recreational facilities and the local women were strictly off-limits.

The Japanese were not aware of the base&#x27;s existence during the April 1942 carrier raids in the Indian Ocean, and Somerville&#x27;s fleet used it extensively. Later in the war, submarine reconnaissance established the base&#x27;s existence, but by this point the Imperial Navy had no designs for a large-scale offensive in the Indian Ocean. The German submarine U-183 did torpedo the tanker British Loyalty in March 1944, making a long-range shot from outside the atoll through a gap in the anti-torpedo nets.

===British naval base===

The Royal Navy established a base (&quot;Port T&quot;) – later RAF Gan from 1957 – on the island of Gan (Addu City) (pronounced “Gun”) in 1941, during World War II. During the Cold War it was used as an outpost.

The original naval base was established as a fall-back for the British Eastern Fleet. Despite public pronouncements to the contrary, the official view was that the main base at Singapore would be untenable if the Japanese made serious headway in Malaya and Java – which, in the event, is what happened in 1942. The intention had been to operate from Trincomalee, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Upon inspection, however, the naval commander-in-chief, Admiral James Somerville found the port inadequate, vulnerable to a determined attack and open to spying. An isolated island base with a safe, deep anchorage in a suitably strategic position was required, and Addu City met the requirements. Once available, its facilities were used extensively by the Fleet.

Royal Navy engineers landed in August 1941 from HMS &quot;Guardian&quot; to clear and construct airstrips on Gan for the Fleet Air Arm. In the interim, Catalina and Sunderland flying boats operated from jetties on the northern, sheltered side of Gan. Large oil tanks were built on Gan, and on Hitaddu Island on the western edge of the atoll; vital elements for a naval base. These were visible from a long distances at sea, but this was unavoidable, given the atoll&#x27;s low profile.

Ship&#x27;s supplies for the fleet were provided from a pair of Australian refrigerated ships, &quot;Changte&quot; and &quot;Taiping&quot; that included Attu in a number of bases that they serviced regularly. Three times these ships replenished forty or more ships of the Eastern Fleet. Several large Second Australian Imperial Force troop convoys also refueled at Addu on their way from Aden to Fremantle, Western Australia.

The six major islands were garrisoned by the 1st Royal Marine Coast Defense Regiment, manning shore batteries and anti-aircraft guns. To facilitate the defense, causeways were built connecting the western islands of Gan, Aboohéra, Maradhoo and Hithadhoo. And, much later in the war, they were linked by a light railway. Addu was an unpopular posting due to the hot, humid climate, lack of recreational facilities and lack of socializing with the local population.

The Japanese remained unaware of the base&#x27;s existence until their plans for expansion in south-east Asia had come to nothing, even during their carrier raids in the Indian Ocean in April 1942. Later in the war, submarine reconnaissance established the base&#x27;s existence. Despite openings into the lagoon being permanently closed by anti-submarine nets, the torpedoed the tanker &quot;British Loyalty&quot; in March 1944 (she had been previously torpedoed and sunk at Diego Suarez); it was an impressive long-range shot from outside the atoll through a gap in the anti-torpedo nets. Although seriously damaged, the tanker did not sink. She was not fully repaired but kept as a Ministry of War Transport Oil Fuel Storage Vessel. There was significant oil pollution after this incident and British personnel were used to clean the lagoon.

On 5 January 1946, &quot;British Loyalty&quot; was scuttled in a lagoon southeast of Hithadhoo Island in the Addu City. After some years of leaking oil, she has become a popular dive location and a haven for the local marine life.

In 1957, the naval base was transferred to the Royal Air Force. As RAF Station Gan, it remained in intermittent service until 1975, when British Forces withdrew.

Most of the employees who had experience working for the British military had good English fluency. When RAF Station Gan closed, they turned to the nascent tourism industry for employment. As a result, there was an influx of Addu people to Malé seeking employment in the nearby resorts and also looking for education to their children. Ex RAF Gan is now a tourist resort, an equator village, with the airstrip now being Gan International Airport.

===The United Suvadive Republic===
The United Suvadive Republic (Dhivehi: އެކުވެރި ސުވާދީބު ޖުމްހޫރިއްޔާ) or Suvadive Islands was a short-lived breakaway nation in the remote Southern Atolls of the Maldive Islands, namely Addu Atoll, Huvadhu Atoll and Fuvahmulah that geographically make up the Suvadive archipelago.

The name of this nation was originally an ancient name for the three southernmost atolls of the Maldives. Suvadive (Dhivehi: ސުވާދީބު) is based on the ancient name for Huvadhu Atoll, which is by far the largest in the small southern atoll group if fact Huvadhu\Suvadive atoll is the second largest atoll formation. Huvadhu Atoll was also called Suadou by Pyrard. Huvadhu atoll was marked as &#x27;Suvadina&#x27; in Dutch colonial era Maps.

The Suvadive secession occurred in the context of the struggle of the Maldives emerging as a modern nation. The alleged causes were the centralist policies of the government in Malé and the recent independence of both neighboring countries, India and Ceylon. At that time the Maldives had remained a British protectorate. The Suvadives declared independence on 3 January 1959. They capitulated, rejoining the rest of the nation on 23 September 1963.

===Addu City===

Speaking to press at the President&#x27;s Office, Nasheed said that after official discussions with the main opposition Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party (DRP), the parties agreed to jointly propose amendments to the Decentralisation Act, based on the results of the referendum, and list administrative constituencies by October 2017.

“When the islands are announced, there will be a major change to the largest atoll in the south, Addu Atoll” he said, “In my view, the results of the referendum showed very clearly that citizens of the atoll want to develop as a city. So we will designate Addu Atoll as one city island. Addu Atoll is an island with the districts Hithadhoo, Maradhoo-Feydhoo, Maradhoo, Hulhudhoo and Meedhoo.”

Instead of an atoll office, he continued, the southernmost atoll will have a municipality run by an elected municipal council.

With over 30,000 inhabitants, Addu Atoll is the second largest population centre in the country. However, as much as 60 percent of some islands currently reside in the capital Male’.

President Nasheed denied that the results and the low turnout was a failure of the government, as small islands rejected the government proposal for administrative consolidation with larger islands.

“In a democracy, if an election is seen as useless, there’s nothing I have to say about that,” he said.

Moreover, Nasheed argued that establishing a nationwide transport network was the government&#x27;s policy on population consolidation, as outlined in the ruling Maldivian Democratic Party&#x27;s (MDP) manifesto, as opposed to “taking a population and settling them in another island.”

While the referendum revealed that small islands did not want to “lose their identity”, Nasheed said that a secret ballot was needed to determine the views of the electorate as he routinely received petitions from islanders requesting relocation.

According to official results, of 26,676 people who participated in the referendum, 16,695 voted in favour of the proposal while 8,402 voted against it.

However, of the six islands in Addu Atoll where voting took place, citizens of Hithadhoo, Maradhoo, Maradhoo-Feydhoo, Feydhoo, meedhoo and Hulhudhoo endorsed the proposal, while islanders of Feydhoo and Meedhoo rejected it.

The first and only mayor of the city is Abdulla Sodiq, who was elected in February 2011 to a three-year term and re-elected in February 2014 to another three-year term.

==Districts==

* Hithadhoo Population: 15,146
* Maradhoo Population: 5,203
* Feydhoo Population: 6,502
* Hulhumeedhoo Population: 6,492

Addu City: Population: 32,062

Hithadhoo (Dhivehi: ހިތަދޫ)is the main administrative district of Addu City, with many of the administrative buildings in this district. The town is situated on the island of the same name, the westernmost of Seenu (Addu). In terms of population count, Hithadhoo is home to the largest population in Addu City.

==Healthcare==

The government owned Addu Equatorial Hospital is the only tertiary hospital in the southern region and is mandated to function and provides around-the-clock care. Health Centers are also established in the Islands to provide basic and emergency services.
Private clinics such as AIMS Diagnostic Care, Eye Care Clinic and IMDC (International Medical and Diagnostic Center) also have opened their branches in Addu.

All citizens are covered through Government&#x27;s Universal health coverage system Aasandha.

==Linguistics==
The dialect spoken in this atoll (Addu bahuruva) is quite different from the official form of the Dhivehi language. It has some affinities with the dialect of Fuvahmulah (Mulaku dialect).

Traditionally all educated islanders from the three different atolls of the south adopted the Addu dialect as lingua franca. Hence, when for example an islander of Huvadhu met with another from Fuvahmulah, they would use the Addu dialect to talk to each other. Addu dialect is the most widespread and famous dialect in the southern region of Maldives.

The secessionist government of the United Suvadive Republic (Suvadives) however, used the Malé dialect in its official correspondence.

==Culture and significance==
Addu has some of the earliest settlements in the Maldives. The culture and linguistics compared to all other parts of Maldives are different.

It was distinguished by strong social divisions and a strong hierarchical system. Traditionally, the upper classes—with names like Don Seedi, Don Kaloa, Fulhu, Manik, and Didi—were close friends and relatives of the sultan and his royal family. Yet, even among these families, there were marked differences. Well into the 20th century, HCP Bell noted that &quot;a Didi marrying a Maniku lady raises her to his own rank; but the children of a Maniku father and Didi mother are, strictly speaking, not entitled to the appellation Didi&quot;.

Years ago, it was unacceptable to eat with a member of an inferior class, and people of a lower class mixing with a superior only sat on a low stool. Now these distinctions are not acceptable in the society.

The number of islands a person leases, or the number of boats they own, was also crucial to their social standing during the sultanates&#x27; era. The boat owner took about half the day&#x27;s catch, while the skipper (keyolhu) earned about one-fifth. The rest was divided equally among the fishermen. The men who make the boats (Maavadi meehaa) were respected craftsmen; the fishermen&#x27;s lives, and thus the well-being of the community, depended upon their skill. The medicine men (Hakeem) stood on the same social rung. Skilled tradesmen, like blacksmiths and jewelers, also commanded a great deal of respect. At the bottom of the social heap was the toddy-tapper (Raaveria) who looked after the coconuts and tapped sap for toddy and syrup.
The sharp division of labor not only reflects the exigencies of island life, but the injunctions of traditional Islam.

The rapid economic growth and educational development of Maldives has completely wiped out the traditional class system.

==White tern==
The White tern (Gygis alba) locally known as Dhondheeni(ދޮންދީނި), sometimes called as Kandhuvalu dhooni is a small seabird traditionally only confined to the Addu Atoll, the southern uttermost atoll in the Maldives.

The White tern is one of the most beautiful and interesting resident birds found in the Maldives. It has its body white with black eye-ring and black bill with blue at the base. Legs and feet are also blue, with yellow to webs. In recent decades the white tern has been proudly used as a symbol by the people of Addu Atoll to represent their atoll in the Maldives.
===Feeding habits===
The White tern primarily feed on smaller fish which it catches by plunge diving down on the surface, but it does not submerge fully. It is a long-lived bird, having been recorded living for 18 years.

===Breeding===
This small sea bird is well known for laying a single speckled egg on exposed thin branches in a small joint or depression without a nest. The thin branches it chooses is act of predator-avoidance behavior, crows (Corvus splendens maledivicus) and even rats avoid sitting or climbing small branches. However, terns are vulnerable to strong winds and the chicks have sophisticated sharp clawed feet to cling on fragile branches.

==Addu Kandu==

Addu Kandu is the local name for the broad channel between Huvadu Atoll and Addu Atoll. The old French maps called it &#x27;Courant d&#x27;Addoue&#x27;.

==Tourism==
Addu City is known as the &#x27;second city&#x27; of the Maldives, and the resorts here are the best base from which to visit traditional Maldivian island communities. The Addu people are fiercely independent, speak differently from folk in the capital and at one time even tried to secede from the republic. The biggest influence on Addu&#x27;s modern history has been the British bases, first established on the island of Gan during WWII, as part of the Indian Ocean defences. In 1956, the British developed a Royal Air Force airfield as a strategic Cold War outpost. The station had around 600 permanent personnel, with up to 3000 during periods of peak activity. They built a causeway connecting the islands of Feydhoo, Maradhoo, and Hitadhoo and employed most of the local men. In 1976, the British pulled out of the islands, leaving many of their now English-speaking employees well qualified for jobs in the soon-to-be booming tourist industry.

Tourist development in Addu itself has been slow to start, but a resort has been established in the old RAF buildings on Gan and there are now reliable connections to the capital via Maldivian, Mega Maldives and Flyme. The Ocean Reef Resort is not a typical Maldives tropical paradise resort island, but the old military base is a unique feature. Gan is linked by causeways to the adjacent islands, and it&#x27;s easy and pleasant to get around them by bicycle, giving unmatched opportunities to visit the local villages and see village life. There are two island resorts in Addu City. Shangril&#x27;a Vilingili Maldives Resort and Canareef Addu. 

Hankede Island has been proposed as a location for a new resort. However, for years this plan has been halted by the government even after interests from several foreign developers.

Gan International Airport has been open since 2013 for international flights. SriLankan Airlines became the first international airline to fly to the Gan International Airport, facilitating a direct connection between Colombo and Ganat.

==Events==

===17th SAARC Summit 2011===

The 17th SAARC summit was hosted by Addu City and neighboring Fuvahmulah in November 2011. The preparations for the summit brought numerous developments to the city, including the building of a convention centre, development of roads and public places, renovation of Gan International Airport and the regional hospital, more job opportunities among many others.

==== Equatorial Convention Centre ====
Equatorial Convention Centre (ECC) is a convention centre which is located in Hithadhoo, Addu City of Maldives. It was specially built for the seventeenth SAARC summit which was held in November 2011 in Addu City and nearby Fuvahmulah island.[1] ECC was formally opened by the President of the Maldives H.E Mohamed Nasheed on 10 November 2011. Equatarial convention center has now been converted to a tertiary hospital and was later renamed as Addu Equatorial Hospital. 

===== Halls and rooms =====
The names of the halls and rooms in the convention centre have been named after historical and cultural places and aspects of Addu and the atolls of the Maldives with the main convention hall called &#x27;Bodu Kiba&#x27;.[3]

The public lobby has been named ‘Addu Thalhanmathi’ with ‘Velaanaa Fendaa’, ‘Eggamu Fendaa’, ‘Kakaa Fendaa’ and ‘Athiree Fendaa’ declared as names for the rooms of the convention centre. ‘Rasruku Kibaa’ is the name of the main banquet hall.[3]

The two-storey convention centre, which has been built for the SAARC Summit with an Rf150 million budget, has an administrative office named ‘Mulee Kotari’, a Business Centre called ‘Badikoshee Kotari’ and a Meeting Room named ‘Dhandikoshee’.[3]

The delegation offices have been named after the atolls of the Maldives; ‘Thiladhunmathi Kotari’, Faadhippolhu Kotari’, ‘Ihavandhippolhu Kotari’, ‘Hadhunmathi Kotari’, ‘Huvadhoo Kotari’, ‘Kolhumadulu Kotari’, ‘Nilandhe Kotari’ and ‘Maalhosmadulu Kotari’.[3]

Rooms located on the first floor include the ‘Dhondhanbu Kibaa’ and ‘Jaafaanu Kibaa’ Function Rooms. The Seminar Rooms located on the first floor have been named as ‘Mas’udi Kotari’, ‘Pyrad Kotari’, ‘Abu’l Barakat Kotari’, ‘Batuta Kotari’, ‘Kalhuoh Fummi Kotari’, ‘Thirnaa Kotari, ‘Jaliyaa Kotari’ and ‘Kalhihaara Kotari’.

==Transportation==

===Addu Linkroad===
The 16-kilometres (9.9 mi) Addu Link Road causeway is the second longest paved causeway in the Maldives. It joins Hithadhoo, Maradhoo, Maradhoo-feydhoo, Feydhoo, and Gan.

The Addu Link Road was the site of the second longest banner ever to be displayed in the Maldives.

Since its construction, a number of fatal accidents have occurred on the Addu Link Road, which local news sources have ascribed to high speeds and reckless driving. Addu City is connected via ferry from Hulhumeedhoo ward to Feydhoo.

===Gan Airport===

Gan International Airport is the airport serving Addu City, located on the island of Gan nearby. First built by the British Royal Navy, and transferred to the Royal Air Force as RAF Gan, the Gan International Airport was originally a military airbase built during World War II and commissioned until the 1970s. The United Kingdom transferred ownership to the government of the Maldives, and it was converted for use as a domestic airport. Recently the airport was upgraded to international standards in preparation for international flights expected with the opening of tourist resorts in the area. The airport was privatised under a 30-year contract signed in June 2010. A new VVIP lounge also has been built for the SAARC summit.

<text>Asafa Powell (born 23 November 1982) is a retired Jamaican sprinter who specialised in the 100 metres. He set the 100 metres world record twice, between June 2005 and May 2008 with times of 9.77 and 9.74 seconds. Powell has consistently broken the 10-second barrier in competition, with his personal best of 9.72 s ranking fourth on the all-time list of men&#x27;s 100-metre athletes. As of 1 September 2016, Powell has broken the ten-second barrier more times than anyone else—97 times. He currently holds the world record for the 100-yard dash with a time of 9.09 s, set on 27 May 2010 in Ostrava, Czech Republic. In 2016, he became Olympic champion in the 4 x 100 metres relay.

Powell competed in the 100 m at the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Olympics, finishing fifth in 2004 and 2008 and eighth after injuring his groin during the race in 2012. At the 2007 Osaka World Championships, he achieved a bronze and a silver medal in the 100 m and 4 × 100 m relay respectively, and he was successful at the Commonwealth Games, winning twice plus achieving a silver medal. At the 2009 World Championships, he achieved the 100 m bronze and became champion in the relay. Powell has won five times at the IAAF World Athletics Final and was the former 100 m world record holder in the event.

In 2013, Powell tested positive for the stimulant oxilofrine along with teammate Sherone Simpson and voluntarily withdrew from the 2013 World Athletics Championships as a result, though both maintained they did not take any banned supplements knowingly or willfully. On 10 April 2014, they received an 18-month suspension from competing, which was set to expire in December that year. However the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) lifted both athletes&#x27; suspensions on 14 July 2014, finding that the positive tests were caused by the presence of oxilofrine, undisclosed by the manufacturer, in a supplement taken by the pair.

==Biography and sprinting career==
Born in Spanish Town, Jamaica, Asafa Powell is the youngest of six sons of two ministers. Asafa attended Ewarton Primary School and Charlemont High School, both in St. Catherine, Jamaica. Powell planned to be a mechanic before he took up running while studying in Kingston, Jamaica. His eldest brother Donovan, was a 60 m finalist in the 1999 World Indoor Championships. Running runs in the family: His brothers clocked 9.5 seconds for the 100 yd dash, his mother 11.4 s, and his father 10.2 s. Powell is a member of the MVP (Maximising Velocity and Power) Track &amp; Field Club based at the University of Technology, Jamaica and has been coached by Stephen Francis since 2001.

===2000–2005: Early career===

Powell represented his school Charlemont High at the ISSA High School Championships. On 11 April he finished fourth in the Class 1 200 m, in 23.07 with a −1.7 m/s headwind. On 13 April, he finished third in his heat of the Boy&#x27;s Class 1 100 m, recording 11.45 with a −2.3 m/s headwind. Neither time recorded in the heats was quick enough to advance him to the next round of competition.

Powell again represented Charlemont High at the ISSA High School Boy And Girls Championships, finishing seventh in the Class 1 100 m Final. Recognizing some talent, coach Stephen Francis started coaching Powell one week later. The coach looked for a way to give the tall teenager a faster start. After searching the island, Stephen Francis found a 100 m stretch of road with a 10% slope and trains his runners on that. Powell vindicated Francis by winning the Boys Under-20 100 m event in 10.50 seconds at the JAAA National Championships on 22 June.

At the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Powell finished fifth in the semi-finals of the 100 m event, setting a personal best of 10.26 s. Powell, along with Michael Frater, Dwight Thomas and Christopher Williams formed the Jamaican 4×100 m relay team that went on to win a silver medal. Powell finished just behind Darren Campbell in the last leg of the relay, with both men finishing in 38.62 s.

Powell won the Jamaican 100 m National Championship in 2003.

Powell came to attention within the world of athletics at the 2003 World Championships, when he suffered the ignominy of being &#x27;the other athlete&#x27; disqualified for a false start in the quarter-final. This was when Jon Drummond memorably refused to leave the track having suffered the same fate, both athletes moved less than 0.1 s after the gun had fired, with Powell&#x27;s reactions being timed at 0.086 s. Six days later Powell was added to the 4 × 100 m relay team for the semi-final, running as the anchor. He helped the team qualify for the final, recording the second fastest time. Powell never had a chance to run for a medal in the final as the second baton exchange was not executed cleanly and the Jamaican team failed to finish. During the 2003 season, Powell won two IAAF Grand Prix events, one of which was an AF Golden League event. He finished seventh in 10.23 s in the 100 m at the IAAF World Athletics Final.

In 2004 on 12 June, Powell recorded his first sub-10 100 m race time (9.99 s +1.8 m/s) while participating in the National Junior Track and Field Championships, held at the GC Foster College in Spanish Town. Two weeks later Powell became one of the favourites for a medal in the 100 m at the 2004 Athens Olympics after winning the Jamaican National Championships with a personal best time of 9.91 s. Although he ended the season with a record-equaling nine sub-10 second runs, Powell finished just fifth in the highly competitive Olympic final, with a time of 9.94 s. Following this he pulled out of the 200 m final, even though he had already qualified eighth for it earlier on. Powell did not get the chance to run for a medal in the 4 × 100 m relay, as the Jamaican team failed to qualify for the final with a season best 38.71 s fourth-place finish in their heat. Following his Olympic disappointment Powell set a new national record of 9.87 s for the 100 m at the Memorial Van Damme in Bruxelles on 3 September. He recorded five IAAF Grand Prix wins in 2004. In addition, he became the first man to win both the 100 m and 200 m races at the World Athletics Final in championship record time. Powell was world ranked number one for the 100 m and number four for the 200 m at the end of the season.

A year later Powell set a new national record of 9.84 s at the Jamaica International Invitational in May. He gained some consolation for his Olympic performance by breaking the 100 m world record in Athens on 14 June 2005, setting a time of 9.77 s, beating American Tim Montgomery&#x27;s 2002 record of 9.78 s (which was later annulled due to doping charges against Montgomery) by just 0.01 s. Coincidentally, Powell achieved the feat on the same track as Maurice Greene&#x27;s 1999 world record run of 9.79 s. Wind assistance for Powell was measured at 1.6 m/s, within the IAAF legal limit of 2.0 m/s. Powell again won the 100 m final at the Jamaican National Championships. A groin injury in July cut short his season and forced him to miss the World Championships. His season ended with just two IAAF Grand Prix event wins. Despite his shortened season, Powell had the three fastest 100 m times of the year, received the Caribbean And Central American (CAC) Male Athlete of the Year award, and ranked second in the world.

===2006–2007: Worldwide success===

2006 was Powell&#x27;s most successful season. He won the 2006 Commonwealth Games 100 metres race after a drama-filled semi-final which saw two disqualifications and three false starts. Powell himself ran into another competitor&#x27;s lane while looking at the scoreboard; however, he was held not to have impeded the runner. He also anchored the 4 × 100 m relay team, and finished the Commonwealth Games with two gold medals. In May, he won the 100 m at the Jamaica International Invitational in 9.95 s. In addition to winning the 200 m at the Jamaican National Championships in June, he won ten 100 m IAAF Grand Prix events, including all six Golden League events.

Powell then equalled his world record time on 11 June 2006 at Gateshead International Stadium with wind assistance measured at +1.5 m/s. The exact time was 9.7629 s, which was rounded up to 9.77 s as per IAAF rules. On 18 August 2006 in Zürich, Powell equalled it again for the second time with wind assistance at +1.0 m/s. He won his sixth IAAF Golden League event (for the 100 m) in the same season, thus earning him a total of $250,000 in prize money. Powell also won the 100 m at the World Athletics Final, again setting a new championship record on 9 September. One week later at the World Cup in Athletics, the Americas team anchored by Powell recorded a DNF. In October, Powell again received the Caribbean And Central American (CAC) Male Athlete of the Year award. On 12 November 2006, he was awarded the title of 2006 Male IAAF World Athlete of the Year along with a cheque for $100,000. He also received the honour of Track &amp; Field Athlete of the Year for 2006.

On 5 January 2007, Powell received the Commonwealth Games Sports Foundation Athlete of the Year award. On 3 February he was honoured at the International Sports Group (ISG) Awards Banquet, held in New York. In addition, Powell was nominated for the Laureus World Sports Awards Sportsman of the Year award. Suffering from knee Tendinitis and missing weeks of training Powell missed competing at the Penn Relays and the Jamaica International Invitational in May. Powell was again the Jamaican National Champion for the 100 m. Unfortunately, Powell again injured his groin while running the final at the Jamaica Championships. He only managed to finish third in the 100 m final at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan, behind Tyson Gay, who was considered Powell&#x27;s biggest rival building up to the Championships. Derrick Atkins, Powell&#x27;s second cousin, came second in 9.91 s. Powell himself finished in a time of 9.96 s (running in a 0.5 m/s headwind) after being passed by Gay and Derrick Atkins in the late stages of the race. Later, Powell admitted that he panicked and gave up after seeing Gay pass him, allowing Atkins also to overtake.

American former sprinter Michael Johnson was critical of Powell&#x27;s performance, stating: 

However, Powell did help to win the silver medal in the 4 × 100 m relay race. Running the anchor leg for the Jamaican team, he came from fifth and passed Great Britain at the line to help record a Jamaican national record of 37.89 s. The United States meanwhile took gold.
On 9 September 2007, in the opening heats of the IAAF Grand Prix in Rieti, Italy, Powell ran a new world record time of 9.74 s (+1.7 m/s) in the 100 m, thus fulfilling the promise he had made earlier after his bronze medal in Osaka, that he would break the record by the end of the year. This was intended to make up for the disappointment of not becoming World Champion. Remarkably, Powell eased up in the final few metres of his record-setting run, indicating that he was saving his strength for the final. In the final itself, Powell finished in 9.78 s (0 m/s windspeed) and bettered his semi-final time when adjusted for wind assistance.

Powell ended his season on 30 September with a left hamstring injury, which came about while running in the lead of the 200 m race at the Super Track &amp; Field meet in Yokohama, Japan. Powell finished 2007 with a total of five IAAF Grand Prix event wins, plus his second consecutive World Athletic Final 100 m win, with yet another championship record. For the third consecutive year Powell won the Caribbean And Central American (CAC) Male Athlete of the Year award. Powell closed the year receiving the IAAF Performance of the Year award, for his 9.74 s world record, and was ranked second in the world.

===2008–2009: Olympics and World Championships===

On 29 January 2008, Powell received the RJR Sports Foundation&#x27;s 2007 Sportsman of the Year award. Powell&#x27;s 2008 season started much as his 2007 season ended: with another injury. Powell was forced to pull out of the Sydney Grand Prix meeting, having suffered a gash to his left knee that required four stitches. The injury was a result of tripping on the steps of his home, hours before getting on the flight to Sydney on 12 February.

Powell was again injured in April, this time with damage to his pectoral muscles. The injury forced Powell out of competition for two months, and was sustained while weight training in Jamaica during mid-April. Surgery was required, and a visible scar was left on his right underarm.

On 31 May, fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt ran a time of 9.72 s at the Reebok Grand Prix in New York, breaking Powell&#x27;s 3-year dominance of the 100 m world record.

On 11 July, Powell suffered his third injury of 2008 while leading in Heat 1 of the Golden Gala Roma, eventually finishing fifth. He had injured his groin (described as a &quot;strain&quot; and a &quot;cramp&quot;), and was forced to miss the next two events on the Grand Prix schedule. Powell made his comeback at the DN Galan meet, where he beat the new World Record holder Bolt, in a close race. The meet&#x27;s top performers were a Jamaican 1–2–3–4 with Nesta Carter and Michael Frater following the pair. This top four would later combine to run the 4 × 100 m relay at the Olympics.

Prior to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, Powell hit back at the claims saying he lacked the mental strength needed to win an Olympic gold medal.
Despite his words, the 100 m final saw Powell again finish in a disappointing fifth, recording a time of 9.95 s. Teammates Bolt and Michael Frater also raced in the final. Bolt won and broke the record he set months earlier (finishing in 9.69 s) and Frater came sixth, recording his first sub-10 clocking at 9.97 s.

Seven days later, Powell finally got his first Olympic medal as he anchored the Jamaican 4 × 100 m relay team to victory, helping establish a new world record in the process. His split time was recorded at 8.70 s (USATF High Performance Registered Split Analysis), bettering his previous record of 8.84 s set in Osaka, 2007. This is the fastest electronically timed anchor run in history, as Bob Hayes was hand timed as running between 8.6 and 8.9 seconds in the 1964 Olympics. The gold medal was later vacated by the IOC in 2017 when a retest of teammate Nesta Carter found the presence of the prohibited substance methylhexaneamine.

On 2 September 2008, Powell ran a new personal best of 9.72 s in the 100 m with windspeed measured at +0.2 m/s. He accomplished this feat at the Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne, Switzerland. After the run, he said that Bolt&#x27;s record performance at the Olympics had inspired him to target a time of 9.59 s:
Powell was optimistic about his future chances on the track, and philosophical as to why he could not peak in past major championships:
Following his fifth-place finish in Beijing on 16 August, Powell recorded seven consecutive 100 m races under 9.90 s, including two races under 9.80 s. In addition, 2008 was Powell&#x27;s second-best season on the Grand Prix circuit, claiming seven victories, plus his third consecutive win (and fourth overall) in the 100 m at the World Athletics Final.

On his return to Jamaica, Powell was honoured in a homecoming celebration and received an Order of Distinction (Commander Rank) in recognition
of his achievements at the Olympics. For the second consecutive year Powell ranked second in the world.

Powell opened his 2009 season on 31 January at the Grace Jackson Invitational, held at Stadium East, Kingston, Jamaica. He ran the 400 metres, winning his heat in 47.75 s, placing him second overall in the four heat time-final.

Powell ran the anchor leg for two relay teams at the Milo Western Relays held at the GC Foster College on 14 February. In his first race, his MVP team recorded a new meet record and world leading time of 38.72 s for the 4 × 100 m relay. Later, he was timed at 46.27 s for his leg of the 4 × 400 metres relay, again winning the race for his MVP team.

Powell next competed at the Sydney Track Classic in Australia on 28 February, again running the anchor leg in the 4 x 100 m relay and winning it in a new world leading time of 38.62 s. Two hours later, he ran a 400 m race, finishing 4th in a new personal best 45.94 s and shaving 1.23 s off his previous best time.

After the 400 m race, Powell said:
Five days later, Powell ran his first 100 m race of the season. Competing at the Melbourne Track Classic he ran a world leading 10.23 s, wind measuring −1.4 m/s on the coldest day of the year to date.

On 16 April, Powell was nominated for the Laureus World Team of the Year award, as a member of the 2008 Jamaica Olympic Sprint Team.

Powell then found himself involved in controversy when he was a last-minute &quot;no show&quot; at the UTech Track and Field Classic on 18 April. He had previously been advertised to run the 200 m and 4 × 100 m relay races. Powell attended as a spectator. A press conference called three days later by the MVP Track Club did not fully answer questions as to why Powell did not compete. The matter was reported to the Jamaica Fair Trading Commission which started investigations on 23 April.

Powell was next to run at the Penn Relays on 25 April, but on the morning of the event, the Jamaica Observer reported that he had withdrawn from the 4 × 100 m relay. His manager Paul Doyle stated that Powell would not run due to concerns with his ankle while running the curve on the Franklin Field track. The Jamaica Observer cited a &quot;highly placed source&quot; when reporting that Powell had turned his ankle in training at Utech. Despite the report, Powell ran the anchor leg of the relay but aggravated the ankle injury, pulled up and finished ninth in 41.24 s.

Scheduled to run at the IAAF Super Grand Prix in Doha on 8 May, Powell withdrew from the event, citing the need for sufficient time for his injured ankle to properly heal. He finished seventh in his first event returning from injury, the Reebok Grand Prix held in New York at Icahn Stadium on 30 May. When interviewed he stated that his ankle was very weak but not painful. He finished second in his next event, the Prefontaine Classic eight days later. On 27 June, he qualified for the 100 m at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics with a second-place finish in 9.97 s at the Jamaican national championships. At the Bislett Games on 3 July, Powell overcame a poor start to win the 100 m in a 10.07 s photo finish. Four days later he recorded the same time in winning the Athletissima 100 m. Although he improved his season&#x27;s best to 9.88 s, he finished second to Tyson Gay at the Golden Gala Roma on 10 July. Powell next ran the 100 m at
the International Meeting of Athletics&#x27; Sports Solidarity, a charity event that encourages the participation of disabled athletes, finishing third.

At the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, Powell took bronze in the finals of the 100 m meet with a time of 9.84 seconds, while compatriot Bolt broke his own world record by running 9.58 seconds. Eight days later, on 22 August, Powell helped Jamaica claim gold in the 4 × 100 m relay by running the anchor leg. The time of 37.31 seconds set was a new Championship Record for the event.

===2010–2011===
Asafa Powell opened his 2010 season on 20 February at the UWI Invitational Meet in Jamaica by competing in the 400 m. He won his heat in a time of 47.56 s but was placed 3rd overall according to his time. He then ran the 200 m at the UTech Classic on 17 April 2010, also in his homeland. He competed in the 200 m in heavy rain and cold conditions. Powell opened up a huge lead in the first 100 m, after which he slowed drastically and won his heat in 21.27 s in a 1 m/s headwind. Later, it was reported that Powell had suffered minor cramps on his left calf muscles, which was why he had to slow down. Powell was next scheduled to run in the highly anticipated 4×100 m Penn Relays featuring Jamaica Yellow, and competing against Usain Bolt (Jamaica Black). However, he pulled out of the race as it was reported by his assistant coach that he had an injured toe, which would need some time to heal. At the IAAF Diamond League in Doha, Powell made a wind aided time of 9.75 s in the heat and 9.81 s in the final, also wind-aided. He subsequently set a 100 m world leading time of 9.83 s. En route to this performance, he also set the rarely run 100 yards dash world best at 9.07 s, beating the previous record of 9.21 s set by Charlie Greene.

Powell next competed at the DKF Bislett Games in Oslo, Norway, where he powered to a splendid victory with a wind-aided 9.72 s. A week later, he competed at the Golden Gala in Rome, Italy, where he overcame a very poor reaction time at the start to take another victory in a World Leading time of 9.82 s. It was reported that Powell ended his six-year contract with leading sports brand Nike due to sponsorship problems, and rumours spread that he has a new contract with fast upcoming Chinese sports brand Li-Ning. Asafa next competed in the 200 m of the Jamaican Senior Trials where he won the final in 19.97 s, his second fastest ever. There, for the first time, he promoted his new Li Ning outfit. Powell next competed in Gateshead where he got off to a terrific start but lost to fast finishing Tyson Gay, who took the victory in 9.94 s to Powell&#x27;s 9.96 s in a strong 1.7 m/s headwind. Powell was not very disappointed as he mentioned that he got too relaxed, thus allowing Gay to outdo him in the final strides. The next race in Paris against Usain Bolt was a disappointing one. Although he had a good start, Bolt caught him at halfway point, and Asafa began to lose his fluent running form. He finished 2nd to Bolt in 9.91 s, 0.07 s slower than his rival and also into a slight headwind. Asafa said that he had a very bad race, which he hoped to improve in his upcoming races. Unfortunately for Powell, there was not a &#x27;next race&#x27; for him. He picked up strains from his Paris meeting, which aggravated to hamstring and back problems. Powell missed his next two outings where he was scheduled to clash against Bolt and Gay. Powell ended his splendid 2010 season on a disappointing note, even though he expressed satisfaction on the races that he competed for the year.

Asafa opened his 2011 season on 16 April at the National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica. He ran the 200 m where he came in third after what looked to be a good first 140 m, slowing down significantly at the last quarter of the race. His time was 20.55 s for the race behind Yohan Blake and Daniel Bailey. Powell ran his next race was the 4 × 100 m relay, USA vs The World, at the Penn Relays 2011, on 28 April. He ran the unusual first leg for Jamaica as he blasted off like a bullet to give Jamaica the lead. Jamaica won the event in a world leading time of 38.33 s, ahead of USA Red and USA Blue teams respectively. He stated after the run that he was in good shape, and looking forward to do great things in the year ahead. Powell next ran the 200 m at the Jamaica International Invitational Meet on 7 May. He looked promising in the first 120 m, after which he slowed down drastically, finishing in last place with a time of 21.40 s, in a race won by Jamaican Nickel Ashmeade. He later stated that he felt a minor pain in his hamstring, and backed off as a precaution, but insisted that it was nothing serious.

In the second meeting of the 2011 IAAF Diamond League at Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, Powell won the 100 m with a time of 9.95 seconds. Powell next ran at the IAAF Diamond League in Rome against Usain Bolt on 26 May. Powell had a superb start and mid, but he faded towards the end, only to allow the world record holder to surpass him in the final 10–12 m of the race. Bolt won in 9.91 s, and Powell came second in 9.93s. He said that he had lost focus, but is confident about beating Bolt after what he had done that day. Powell next competed in the IAAF World Challenge in Rabat, Morocco, in a low key meet. There, after running the first 20 m, he pulled up and finished last in 36.13 s, citing a precaution against a serious hamstring injury. Reports said that it was nothing serious, and he would be ready for the Jamaican Trials later in the month. At the Jamaican Trials 23–24 July, Powell looked impressive as he qualified through the rounds. He posted a season best of 9.90s in his semi-final, despite easing off in the final 1 5m. Later, after overcoming a bad start, Powell won the final to be titled National Champion for the fifth time in his career. He won in a time of 10.08 s into a 1.8 m/s headwind. Yohan Blake and Steve Mullings were second and third respectively with only 0.01 s separating them.

Next up for Powell was the Diamond League Athletissima in Lausanne on 30 June. In chilly conditions not ideal for sprinting, the former world record holder bulleted out of his blocks and ran to the tape, recording a world-leading 9.78 s with a following wind of 1.0 m/s. Powell was indeed happy with his strong performance, his fastest in three years, and full of confidence about the rest of the season and IAAF World Championships in Daegu, South Koreaa in late August. Next up for Powell was the IAAF Diamond League Meeting in Birmingham, England on 10 July. He became the first man in history to break the 10 seconds barrier in the Sir Alexander Stadium when he clocked a very easy looking 9.95 s in his heat. Later, in the final, he eased to a 9.91 s victory where compatriots Nesta Carter and Michael Frater finished second and third respectively. Powell was satisfied with both his races, stating that he took both the races easy due to very chilly and rainy conditions. Asafa seemed more and more confident heading into the World Championships in late August. Powell next competed on 30 July in Budapest at the Hungarian Grand Prix. He ran 9.90 s in his heats and eased through the final to win in 9.86 s, having followed winds of 1.8 m/s and 2.0 m/s respectively, in cold conditions.

Powell was next slated to run the Aviva London Grand Prix, but he pulled out, citing a groin strain. Later in late August, just a couple of days before the start of the World Championships in Daegu, Powell shocked the world by pulling out of the highly anticipated 100 m as his groin strain was re-aggravated and did not allow him to compete. Powell expressed great disappointment but vowed to come back strong for the London Olympics in 2012, but still hoped to run the 4x100 m relay in Daegu. However, he was unfit to run the relay and had to watch his compatriots win gold in a world record time of 37.04 s. Powell competed in the 100 m at the Diamond League Final in Zürich on 9 September. He looked very impressive in the first 60 m, but faded to second place as newly crowned world champion, Yohan Blake, took victory in 9.82 s. Powell registered a 9.95 s run, which was impressive given the fact that his injury was still present. By completing the race, the sprinter took the Samsung Diamond Trophy with $40,000 in cash. Powell ended his season with another injury, almost a repeat of year 2010, where he showed excellent form in the first half of the year but unfortunately suffered injuries.

====2012 London Olympics====
In a ceremony held on 24 February, Powell received the University of Technology (UTech) Chancellor&#x27;s Medal as well as Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Award International Ambassador role. He ran a personal best for the 60 metres at the Birmingham Indoor Grand Prix, setting a time of 6.50 seconds. On the 2012 IAAF Diamond League circuit, he was narrowly beaten by Justin Gatlin in Doha (runner-up in 9.88 seconds), then won the 100 m at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix a week later.

On 5 August 2012, Asafa Powell ran in the final of the 100 m race at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom. After back-to-back 5th-place finishes in Athens and Beijing, 2004 and 2008 respectively, Powell had his most disastrous final yet when he finished dead last with a time of 11.99 seconds, pulling up after seeing others pulling ahead of him, but it was ultimately due to a persistent groin injury. Powell said:&quot;It was my old groin injury that reoccurred. I felt it and it started to go. You never want to get injured, but it is a bit of a disaster when it happens in the Olympic final.&quot;

Usain Bolt took the gold with Yohan Blake getting the silver and Justin Gatlin the bronze. As a result, Powell along with longtime rival Tyson Gay who finished 4th, remain as two of the three fastest men of all time to never have won any individual Olympic medals of any type.

After the race, Jamaica&#x27;s track and field manager Ludlow Watts lavished praise on Powell:Powell actually started this great change in our sprinting, and he&#x27;s still a champion.

Following the race, Powell had an ultrasound showing new tears in his adductor muscles as well as scar tissue in a previous injury. The groin injury appears to be season-ending as manager Paul Doyle believes he will miss the remainder of the year. &quot;I don&#x27;t think it looks good for the rest of the season for Asafa,&quot; he lamented. Powell was not able to compete for Jamaica in the men&#x27;s 4 × 100 m relay on 10 August.

Powell released an apparel and accessories line branded &quot;Sub 10 King&quot; and many others, also opening up his personal website www.iamasafa.com for people&#x27;s viewing and a platform to purchase his products.

====2013–2014 suspension and appeal====
On 14 July 2013 Powell announced he had tested positive for the banned drug oxilofrine in 2013 and withdrew from the 2013 World Athletics Championships as a result, but maintained that he did not take any banned supplements knowingly or willfully. Powell and fellow Jamaican sprinter, Sherone Simpson had taken the supplement Epiphany D1 as part of their training regimen, not knowing it contained oxilofrine. It was later revealed that Acacia was substituted with oxilofrine, and not revealed by the manufacturer. The duo sued the company that sold the supplement, Dynamic Life Nutrition (DLN), in order to clear their names. Both Powell and Simpson reached an out of court settlement for an undisclosed amount in September 2015. After the settlement, Simpson released a statement stating: &quot;Both Asafa and I are happy that we were able to settle this out of court.&quot; In April 2014, the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission suspended him for 18 months over doping charges, expiring in December that year. However, after he and Simpson appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), the suspensions were reduced to the 6 months already served as CAS accepted the explanation that the offense was minor and due to contamination of the Epiphany D1 supplement.

====2016 Rio Olympics====
On 19 August 2016, Powell made a triumphant Olympic return, competing as part of the Jamaican 4 × 100 m men&#x27;s relay team and winning a gold medal. After Jamaican team gold medal in 2008 Olympics were stripped, this medal win will be his only gold medal at Olympic Games.

===Physiology and running style===
Despite Powell&#x27;s size ( tall, weighing ), he has fast initial acceleration. In the Japanese sports Science institute in 2008, Asafa Powell was measured to have a small cross sectional area of his quadriceps tendon stretched with 114 kilograms of pull force, compared to sprinter Nobuharu Asahara&#x27;s measurement of 59 kilograms, and the average mans as being 43 kilograms. Powell was also noted as having a large Psoas major muscle in the Japanese sports science institute. Coupled with comparatively high stiffness in his ligaments and tendons, his long legs provide a long stride of 2.6 metres with rapid progression between each stride.

==Personal life==
Powell is deeply religious, citing his mother and father and his strict upbringing as the reason for this.

In 2002, tragedy struck the Powell family when one of Asafa&#x27;s brothers, Michael Powell, was shot dead in a taxi in New York. This emotional event happened the week of the Jamaica National Trials. In 2003, Asafa lost another brother during the week of the Jamaica National Championships. One year after the death of Michael, Vaughn Powell suffered a heart attack while playing a game of American football. In April 2007, Corey Reid, an uncle of Powell, was stabbed in Waterloo, Ewarton, St. Catherine. He later died in hospital.

Powell married Ghanaian-born Canadian model Alyshia Powell in 2019. Powell has four children—two with his wife, Amieke Powell and Azhaf Powell and two from previous relationships, Avani Powell and Liam Powell. Mercedes Formula 1 junior Alex Powell is a nephew of his.

He is good friends with compatriot, 100 and 200-metre world record holder Usain Bolt. The two are often seen joking around and do meet off the track.

Powell is an avid car enthusiast.

Powell announced his retirement from Track and Field on 23 November 2022.

<text>John Poynder Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington (31 October 1866 – 6 December 1936), born John Poynder Dickson and known as Sir John Poynder Dickson-Poynder from 1884 to 1910, was a British politician. He was Governor of New Zealand between 1910 and 1912.

==Early life==
The son of Rear Admiral John Bourmaster Dickson and Sarah Matilda Dickson (née Poynder), he was born on the Isle of Wight and educated at Twyford School, Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford. In 1884 he succeeded his uncle as sixth baronet, and on succeeding to his maternal uncle&#x27;s property he assumed by royal licence the additional surname of Poynder in 1888. The Poynder estates in Wiltshire included Hilmarton near Calne, and Hartham near Corsham, where Dickson-Poynder carried out alterations c. 1888.

He married Anne Beauclerk Dundas (c.1869-1958) the daughter of James Dundas of Dundas and granddaughter of Baron Napier of Magdala. They had one daughter, Joan, who was later Joan, Lady Altrincham who organised nursing in Africa.

==Member of Parliament==
He was appointed High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1890. Elected Conservative Member of Parliament for the Chippenham constituency in 1892, he joined the Liberals in 1905. He was a member of London County Council from 1898 to 1904.

In late 1902 he visited British India and attended the 1903 Delhi Durbar.

== Military career ==
Dickson-Poynder was first commissioned into the volunteer battalion of the Royal Scots, but transferred to the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry where he was promoted to captain on 7 December 1898. He volunteered for active service in the Second Boer War, and was commissioned a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion (Wiltshire Company) Imperial Yeomanry on 7 February 1900, leaving Liverpool for South Africa on the SS &quot;Cymric&quot; in early March 1900. Appointed a quartermaster during the voyage (dated 10 March 1900), he was back as a regular lieutenant in the Wiltshire company of the 1st battalion the following month. He later served on the Staff as aide-de-camp to Lord Methuen, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 29 November 1900. Following his resignation from the Imperial Yeomanry, he was on 5 February 1901 granted the rank of honorary lieutenant of the Army. The following year, he was promoted to major in the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry on 31 May 1902.

==Governor of New Zealand==

In 1910 Dickson was appointed Governor of New Zealand, a post he held for two years, and on 27 April that same year, was created Baron Islington, of Islington in the County of London. He was the last Governor of New Zealand to hold the title before it was changed to Governor-General of New Zealand during the term of his successor. He was made a KCMG and Privy Counsellor in 1911, and in 1912 was appointed President of the Royal Commission on the Public Services of India, on which he served with Lord Ronaldshay, Herbert Fisher, Mr Justice Abdur Rahim, and others.

==Later career==
Earlier on he was appointed for the Royal Commission on London Traffic in 1904, and worked on trade relations between Canada and the West Indies in 1909. A few years later he became Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, and in 1915 he became Under-Secretary of State for India. He also chaired the Imperial Institute for eight years, and was in charge of the National Savings Committee from 1920 until 1926, when he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE), having become Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) thirteen years before.

==Death==
Lord Islington died on 6 December 1936 aged 70 at Hyde Park Gardens, London, and was buried at Hilmarton, Wiltshire, his barony and baronetcy becoming extinct at his death. Lady Islington subsequently rented Dyrham Park in Gloucestershire, where she ran a nursery during the Second World War.

<doc id="898284" wikidata="Q1423019" url="?curid=898284" title="Valet parking">
<text>Valet parking is a parking service offered by some restaurants, stores, and other businesses. In contrast to &quot;self-parking&quot;, where customers find a parking space on their own, customers&#x27; vehicles are parked for them by a person called a &quot;valet&quot;. This service either requires a fee to be paid by the customer or is offered free of charge by the establishment.

==Explanation==
A valet is usually an employee of the establishment or an employee of a third-party valet service. When there is a fee, it is usually either a flat amount or a fee based on how long the car is parked. It is customary in the United States to tip the valet who actually parks the car. Valet parking is most often offered (and is most useful) in urban areas, where parking is scarce, though some upscale businesses offer valet parking as an optional service, even though self-parking may be readily available. For example, in wealthy suburban areas like California&#x27;s Silicon Valley, some hospitals (like Stanford University Medical Center) offer valet parking for the convenience of patients and their visitors.

Some cars come with an additional key, known as a valet key, that starts the ignition and opens the driver&#x27;s side door, but prevents the valet from gaining access to valuables that are located in the trunk or the glove box.

==Efficiency==
The main advantage of valet parking is convenience. Customers do not have to walk from a distant parking spot carrying heavy loads. Many disabled drivers rely on valet parking when they can&#x27;t walk from and to a distant parking spot. Likewise, people who do not have time to search for a parking spot can valet park without the hassle. Valet parking is especially convenient in bad weather. Most professional valet attendants are well insured, and knowledgeable about nearly every make and model of car and their quirks; including aftermarket alarm systems, and keyless ignitions.

An advantage of valet parking is that it is possible to pack more cars into a given physical space, in what is generally known as &quot;stack parking&quot;. The valet holds all the keys and can park the cars two or more deep, as they can move cars out of the way to free a blocked-in car.

Another type of stacking is called lane stacking. This method is useful for events where guests all arrive around the same time, such as for a wedding reception. The point of this procedure is to keep the lane (or lanes) of incoming traffic flowing forward so that guests are spared a long wait time for valet service. This method is usually accomplished by designating one or two of the valets to be &quot;stackers&quot;, who simply &quot;push&quot; each car up fifty feet or so and prepare it for a quick &quot;takeaway&quot; for a returning valet to park. The process is then repeated until all cars are parked, utilizing as much lane space as possible, meanwhile keeping the lanes moving.

An additional advantage of valet parking, aside from stacking, is that valets can park cars closer and straighter than some customers may park. This will save the space in the parking lot or garage, and prevent the inconvenience of going to different floors by cramming everything in.

An efficient valet service will implement (or at least prepare) a system to handle the expected number of cars and guests. This may include, but is not limited to, any of the following: designated greeters, stackers, and parkers, a system for marking car locations, and sometimes even a shuttle service for valets at large venues in order to expedite car return times at the end of the event.

==Luxury==
Valet parking can offer a sense of luxury and convenience beyond what self-parking typically provides. Many venues and events that offer valet parking go beyond simply parking the vehicle, providing added services such as bringing the car to the entrance, assisting guests with doors, and in some instances performing light cleaning or detailing. 

These touches, often found at luxury hotels, restaurants, and event spaces, are designed to enhance the overall customer experience. In addition to these benefits, valet parking can also improve security by having trained personnel park and monitor vehicles in designated areas. Although often associated with a higher cost, these features may appeal to individuals who value a more luxurious and refined arrival and departure process.

==Venues==
As described above, several different types of venues offer valet parking. These include:
*Single event: These valets are usually hired for just the evening and have assigned roles for efficiency. Parking may be at an off-site location that can handle many cars and can range from a dirt field to a multi-story parking lot. It might also be in the streets near the pickup location. At a wedding the cars may be stacked in order, respecting the hierarchy of importance of the visitors. For instance, at a Middle Eastern oil company executive party, the vehicles might be stacked in the order of the importance of the executives of the company.
*Restaurant or bar location: In this setting, parking is usually in the establishment&#x27;s own lot, but may also be a blocked-off section of a nearby parking house or multilayer lot. Often a dozen spots in front will be reserved for the big spenders or frequent visitors. When the restaurant is not busy, the nicest, most unusual or newest vehicles will be parked in front of the restaurant. This can be a sales and marketing stipulation. Restaurants trying to attract tourists may park rental vehicles or common vehicles in front. Expensive restaurants looking to attract less frugal customers may park expensive cars in front, including those of the restaurant employees or owners. 
*Bar or crowded urban setting: Here, space is a premium, yet the cars on the street may have a huge bearing on the clientele inside.
*Hotel location: Hotels can have all types mentioned above. Lots, multi-layer lots, parking houses, hydraulic structures, parking in front, parking in back, shuttles for car owners, shuttles for valets and more. The biggest difference between hotels and other types is the cost. Hotels usually charge double or more for valet parking when compared to bars, restaurants and major events. Usually this is because of a captive market and the need for overnight parking.
*Airports: In the United Kingdom, companies have offered valet parking at airports. The service is also offered when parking at an airport hotel.
*Casinos: The major casinos in the U.S., particularly those in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Niagara Falls and most larger Native American casinos provide either free or low-cost valet parking.
*Hospitals
*Malls: Major shopping centers with high traffic volume often results in full parking facilities. Some malls offer valets (with fees) to park the vehicle at a temporary location or a reserved lot. Keys are given to the valet and a ticket is issued to the driver. Upon the return of patron, the valet will drive the vehicle back to the valet booth. Temporary mall parking valets may be found during major holiday periods, like Christmas.

==Valet parking equipment==
Common valet parking equipment includes articles such as valet podiums and key boxes for storing and protecting keys and valet tickets which are used to keep track of keys and their corresponding vehicles. Some valet parking providers also use specially designed umbrellas and signs to direct customers or display prices.

==Bike valet==

In some urban areas where parking is exceptionally scarce, events and universities sometimes sponsor a valet parking service for bikes. This service is normally free of charge and offered to encourage riding a bike to the location.

==Motorcycle valet parking==
Motorcycle valet parking can be found in the city of Surakarta, Indonesia at places such as Pasar Gede, Pasar Singosaren, Pasar Sidodadi, Pasar Kleco, Pasar Klewer.

<doc id="898290" wikidata="Q956086" url="?curid=898290" title="Bug tracking system">
<text>Tracking system or defect tracking system is a software application that keeps track of reported software bugs in software development projects. It may be regarded as a type of issue tracking system.

Many bug tracking systems, such as those used by most open-source software projects, allow end-users to enter bug reports directly. Other systems are used only internally in a company or organization doing software development. Typically bug tracking systems are integrated with other project management software.

A bug tracking system is usually a necessary component of a professional software development infrastructure, and consistent use of a bug or issue tracking system is considered one of the &quot;hallmarks of a good software team&quot;.

== Making==

A major component of a bug tracking system is a database that records facts about known bugs. Facts may include the time a bug was reported, its severity, the erroneous program behavior, and details on how to reproduce the bug; as well as the identity of the person who reported it and any programmers who may be working on fixing it.

Typical bug tracking systems support the concept of the life cycle for a bug which is tracked through the status assigned to the bug. A bug tracking system should allow administrators to configure permissions based on status, move the bug to another status, or delete the bug. The system should also allow administrators to configure the bug statuses and to what extent a bug in a particular status can be moved. Some systems will e-mail interested parties, such as the submitter and assigned programmers, when new records are added or the status changes.

== Usage ==

The main benefit of a bug-tracking system is to provide a clear centralized overview of development requests (including both bugs and improvements; the boundary is often fuzzy), and their state. The prioritized list of pending items (often called backlog) provides valuable input when defining the product road map, or maybe just &quot;the next release&quot;.

In a corporate environment, a bug-tracking system may be used to generate reports on the productivity of programmers at fixing bugs. However, this may sometimes yield inaccurate results because different bugs may have different levels of severity and complexity. The severity of a bug may not be directly related to the complexity of fixing the bug. There may be different opinions among the managers and architects.

A &quot;local bug tracker (LBT)&quot; is usually a computer program used by a team of application support professionals (often a help desk) to keep track of issues communicated to software developers. Using an LBT allows support professionals to track bugs in their &quot;own language&quot; and not the &quot;language of the developers.&quot; In addition, an LBT allows a team of support professionals to track specific information about users who have called to complain—this information may not always be needed in the actual development queue. Thus, there are two tracking systems when an LBT is in place.

== Part of integrated project management systems ==
Bug and issue tracking systems are often implemented as a part of integrated project management systems.
This approach allows including bug tracking and fixing in a general product development process, fixing bugs in several product versions, automatic generation of a product knowledge base and release notes.

== Distributed bug tracking ==

Some bug trackers are designed to be used with distributed revision control software. These distributed bug trackers allow bug reports to be conveniently read, added to the database or updated while a developer is offline. Fossil and Veracity both include distributed bug trackers.

Recently, commercial bug tracking systems have also begun to integrate with distributed version control. FogBugz, for example, enables this functionality via the source-control tool, Kiln.

Although wikis and bug tracking systems are conventionally viewed as distinct types of software, ikiwiki can also be used as a distributed bug tracker. It can manage documents and code as well, in an integrated distributed manner. However, its query functionality is not as advanced or as user-friendly as some other, non-distributed bug trackers such as Bugzilla. Similar statements can be made about org-mode, although it is not wiki software as such.

==Bug tracking and test management==
While traditional test management tools such as HP Quality Center and IBM Rational Quality Manager come with their own bug tracking systems, other tools integrate with popular bug tracking systems.

<doc id="898293" wikidata="Q1183721" url="?curid=898293" title="Force play">
<text>In baseball, a force play or force out occurs when a runner is required to advance to a base which a player on the opposing team has already reached while in possession of the ball. 

There are two situations in which a force play occurs: One, a batter becomes a runner and gets put out because an opponent with possession of the ball reaches first base before the batter can get there. Two, a runner is forced to vacate their starting base (usually because another runner on their team is attempting to advance to that base), meaning that the runner must attempt to advance to the next base, but is forced out because an opponent with possession of the ball reached that base before they did. 

Baserunners are forced to attempt to advance to the next base whenever a teammate is forced to advance to their own base. Because of this, a runner at first base is always forced to attempt to advance to second base when the batter becomes a runner, and runners at second or third base are forced only when all bases preceding their time-of-pitch base are occupied by other base-runners and the batter becomes a runner. However, runners are no longer forced to advance to the next base if any runner behind them on the base-paths is put out.

==Explanation==
A forced runner&#x27;s &quot;force base&quot; is the next base beyond his time-of-pitch base. Any play in which there is a successful attempt made by fielders to put a forced runner out is a force play.

The forced runners can be compared to bumper cars. If, with a runner on first, the batter hits a ground ball, the batter may run to first, and since two runners are not allowed to stay on one base at one time, the runner who was on first to begin with is now bumped by the advancing batter over to second. If there already was a runner on second as well, that runner is now bumped over to third, and if the bases are loaded (i.e., there are runners on all three bases) then the runner on third must attempt to reach home plate. If a runner is bumped over to the next base by the advancing batter or by another runner who was bumped by the advancing batter, then that runner is considered to have been forced to advance to the next base. If however, with a runner on third, for example, the batter hits a ground ball, the batter may run to first, but the runner on third, not having been bumped by the batter, is not forced to advance and can stay where they are if they elect to do so.

Force plays, or force outs, are one of the two ways to get a runner out on a ground ball. For a fielder to get a forced runner out, he must, while possessing a batted fair ball, either (1) touch the base to which the forced runner must advance before the forced runner does so, or (2) tag that runner before the runner touches that base. For example, with a runner on first, the batter hits a ground ball to the second baseman. The runner on first is forced to second. The second baseman can record an out by touching second base while possessing the ball or by tagging the runner before the runner touches second base.

===Removing the force===
A force on a runner is &quot;removed&quot; when the batter or a following runner (in other words, any runner behind him on the base-paths) is put out. This most often happens on fly outs—on such, the batter-runner is out, and the other runner(s) must return to their time-of-pitch base, known as tagging up. It also occasionally happens when a sharply hit ground ball is fielded by the first baseman, who then quickly steps on first base to put out the batter-runner. This removes the requirement that the runner already on first must advance to second base; he cannot be forced out by a defensive player holding the ball while touching second base, and the runner can try to escape from a rundown by returning to first base.

Force outs may also result from neighborhood plays.

==Scoring on force outs==

No run can be scored during the same continuous playing action as a force out for the third out, even if a runner reaches home plate before the third out is recorded. As a result, on a batted ball with two outs, fielders will nearly always ignore a runner trying to score, attempting instead to force out the batter or another runner. For example, suppose there are runners on first and third with one out. The batter hits a ground ball to the second baseman. The second baseman, seeing a forced runner on first heading his way, retrieves the ball and steps on second to get him out to force him out for the second out of the inning. In this scenario, if the runner on third had run home and touched home plate, his run would count if the batter reached first base safely. But suppose the same play happened with two outs. The second baseman, seeing the forced runner on first heading his way, retrieves the ball and steps on second to get him out on the force play for the third out of the inning. If the runner on third had meanwhile run home and touched home plate, that run would not have counted. Note that the second baseman, tagging such a forced runner coming from first for the third out, also prevents scoring by the speedy runner from third as this tag is considered a force out (any out, tag, or touching the force base, on a forced runner is a force out).

An appeal play may also be a force play; for example, with runners on first and third bases and two out, the batter gets a hit but the runner from first misses second base on the way to third. After a proper appeal, this runner will be called out. This is a force out because the runner was out for failing to touch a base to which he was forced; this force out is the third out ,and thus the run does not score. However, most appeals are not forced plays, because they usually do not involve a forced runner.

==Tagging up is not equivalent to being forced==
It is not a force out when a runner is put out while trying to tag up after a caught fly ball. Because this out is similar to a true force out in that the runner can be put out by a fielder possessing the ball at the base that the runner needs to reach, there is a widespread misconception that this out is a force out. But it is not, which means the run would count if it scored before the third out is made on a different runner trying to tag up.

<text>The Sogdian Rock or Rock of Ariamazes, a fortress located north of Bactria in Sogdiana (near Samarkand), ruled by Arimazes, was captured by the forces of Alexander the Great in the early spring of 327 BC as part of his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire.

==Background==
Oxyartes of Bactria had sent his wife and daughters, one of whom was Roxane, to take refuge in the fortress, as it was thought to be impregnable, and was provisioned for a long siege.

When Alexander asked the defenders to surrender, they refused, telling him that he would need &quot;men with wings&quot; to capture it.

==Siege==
Alexander asked for volunteers, whom he would reward if they could climb the cliffs under the fortress. There were some 300 men who from previous sieges had gained experience in rock-climbing. Using tent pegs and strong flaxen lines, they climbed the cliff face at night, losing about 30 of their number during the ascent. In accordance with Alexander&#x27;s orders, they signalled their success to the troops below by waving bits of linen, and Alexander sent a herald to tell the defenders that if they looked up, they would see that he had found his winged men. The defenders were so surprised and demoralised by this that they surrendered, even though they outnumbered the mountaineers by a hundred to one and Alexander&#x27;s main force still had no way to reach the summit. The defenders had thought that the Rock was impregnable, and with one bold stroke Alexander showed them how wrong they were. The enemy&#x27;s quick surrender validated Alexander&#x27;s insightful use of psychological warfare.

==Aftermath==
Alexander is said to have fallen in love with Roxane on sight. The Macedonians claimed that Roxane was &quot;the loveliest woman they had seen in Asia, with the one exception of Darius&#x27; wife&quot;.

From Sogdian Rock, Alexander advanced into Parsetakene which contained another supposedly impregnable craggy fortress known as the Rock of Chorienes, but it was no match for Alexander and it was soon captured. From there Alexander went to Bactra while he sent Craterus with a division of the Macedonian army to complete the pacification of Parsetakene. Alexander remained at Bactra, preparing for his expedition across the Hindu-Kush into India. It was while in Bactra that he married Roxana.

==Historiography==
The story of the siege of the Sogdian Rock is told in many histories, but it is based on the history written by the Greek historian Arrian of Nicomedia, in his &quot;Anabasis&quot; (section 4.18.4-19.6). However P. J. Rhodes points out that &quot;this version [of events] produces a very empty 328 and a very full early 327, so we should probably prefer the alternative tradition. In this second tradition instead of the Sogdian Rock and the Rock of Chorienes the same stratagems are used against the Rock of Arimazes and the Rock of Sisimithres in the summer of 328&quot;.

<doc id="898319" wikidata="Q2469181" url="?curid=898319" title="Scylding">
<text>The Scyldings (OE Scyldingas) or Skjǫldungs (ON Skjǫldungar), both meaning &quot;descendants of Scyld/Skjǫldr&quot;, were, according to legends, a clan or dynasty of Danish kings, that in its time conquered and ruled Denmark and Sweden together with part of England, Ireland and North Germany. The name is explained in many texts, such as Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann&#x27;s &#x27;Research on the Field of History&#x27; (), by the descent of this family from an eponymous king Scyld, but the title is sometimes applied to rulers who purportedly reigned before him, and the supposed king may be an invention to explain the name. There was once a Norse saga on the dynasty, the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;, but it survives only in a Latin summary by Arngrímur Jónsson.

==Descent from Sceaf==
According to Anglo-Saxon legends recounted in &quot;Widsith&quot; and other sources such as Æthelweard (&quot;Chronicon&quot;), the earliest ancestor of Scyld was a culture-hero named Sceaf, who was washed ashore as a child in an empty boat, bearing a &quot;sheaf&quot; of wheat. 
This is said to have occurred on an island named Scani or Scandza (Scania), and according to William of Malmesbury (&quot;Gesta regum Anglorum&quot;) he was later chosen as King of the Angles, reigning from Schleswig. His descendants became known as Scefings, or more usually Scyldings (after Sceldwea). 
Snorri Sturluson adopted this tradition in his Prologue to the Prose Edda, giving Old Norse forms for some of the names.
The following list gives the supposed pedigree.

==From Skjöld to Halfdan==

The number, names, and order of the Skjöldung kings vary greatly in different texts until one comes to Halfdan/Healfdene.

All Old English texts call Scyld&#x27;s son and successor Beaw or some similar name. (The name was expanded to Beowulf in the poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, probably in error by a scribe who thought it was an abbreviation for the name of the poem&#x27;s hero, who is quite a different person). Halfdan/Healfdene seems to be the direct son of Beaw in the poem. But all Scandinavian sources that mention both Skjöld and Halfdan put Halfdan some generations after Skjöld and make no mention of King Beaw (save for a genealogy in the Prologue to Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Edda&quot; which is taken from English traditions).

According to Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (Book 1), Skjöld was succeeded by a son named Gram. Since &quot;gram&quot; is also a simple adjective meaning &quot;fierce&quot; and a common kenning for &quot;king&quot;, it might be that Saxo or a source has misunderstood some account referring to Beaw as being &quot;gram&quot; or a &quot;gram&quot; and wrongly taken it here as a personal name. Saxo has much to tell of this Gram who becomes the father of Hadingus of whom he has even more to relate, Hadingus in turn becomes the father of a king Frotho I who is father of Haldanus I.

Snorri Sturluson in his &quot;Edda&quot;, along with some other Old Norse texts, makes Skjöld to be father of Fridleif father of Fróði under whose reign the world was at peace. Snorri mentions this Fróði son of Fridleif in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; also. But in this work Snorri also introduces a second, later Fróði, said to be son of certain Dan Mikilláti. The second Fróði is known both as Fróði Mikilláti and Fróði the Peace-lover and looks suspiciously like a duplicate of the other peaceful Fróði. Snorri makes this second Fróði the father of Halfdan and of another son named Fridleif.

Saxo in Books 4–5, long after the reign of Halfdan and the fall of the Skjöldung dynasty, also introduces a king named Dan, the third king with that name in his account, whose son is Fridleif whose son is Fróði under whose reign the world achieves peace. This Fróði is also the father of a son named Fridleif according to Saxo.

There are other differing accounts of Halfdan&#x27;s ancestors. The names, number, and order of legendary Danish kings are very inconsistent in extant texts and it would appear that different writers and story tellers differently arranged what tales of legendary Danish kings they knew in whatever order seemed best to them.

==Halfdan and his descendants==
In all accounts Halfdan is father of Helgi (called Halga in &quot;Beowulf&quot;) and Hróar (called Hrothgar in &quot;Beowulf&quot;). Helgi is father of the famous Hrólf Kraki (called Hrothulf in &quot;Beowulf&quot;). In &quot;Beowulf&quot;, another son of Healfdene/Halfdan named Heorogar is father of Heoroweard who corresponds to Hjörvard in the Old Norse accounts where Hjörvard&#x27;s parentage is not told. The Old Norse accounts make Hjörvard to be the husband of Hrólf&#x27;s sister and tell how Hjörvard rebelled against King Hrólf and burned him in his hall. But Hjörvard was himself soon slain and with him the rule of the Skjöldung dynasty ended.

==Other Skjöldungar==
A later lineage said to be of Skjöldung descent:
*Halfdan the Valiant
*Ivar Vidfamne
*Harald Hildetand
*Östen Beli

* Beowulf and Hrólf Kraki
* Rurik Dynasty, a possible branch of the Scyldings in the Garðaríki (allegedly through Rorik of Dorestad)

<doc id="898330" wikidata="Q831852" url="?curid=898330" title="Coppélia">
<text>Coppélia (sometimes subtitled: La Fille aux Yeux d&#x27;Émail (The Girl with the Enamel Eyes)) is a comic ballet from 1870 originally choreographed by Arthur Saint-Léon to the music of Léo Delibes, with libretto by Charles-Louis-Étienne Nuitter. Nuitter&#x27;s libretto and mise-en-scène was based upon E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s short story &quot;Der Sandmann&quot; (&quot;The Sandman&quot;). In Greek, &quot;κοπέλα&quot; (or &quot;κοπελιά&quot; in some dialects) means &quot;young woman&quot;. &quot;Coppélia&quot; premiered on 25 May 1870 at the Théâtre Impérial de l&#x27;Opéra, with the 16-year-old Giuseppina Bozzacchi in the principal role of Swanhilda and ballerina Eugénie Fiocre playing the part of Frantz &quot;en travesti&quot;. The costumes were designed by Paul Lormier and Alfred Albert, the scenery by Charles-Antoine Cambon (Act I, scene 1; Act II, scene 1), and Édouard Desplechin and Jean-Baptiste Lavastre (Act I, scene 2).

The ballet&#x27;s first flush of success was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War and the siege of Paris (which also led to the early death of Giuseppina Bozzacchi, on her 17th birthday), but eventually it became the most-performed ballet at the Opéra.

Modern-day productions are traditionally derived from the revivals staged by Marius Petipa for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg in the late 19th century. Petipa&#x27;s choreography was documented in the Stepanov method of choreographic notation at the turn of the 20th century. These notations were later used to stage the St. Petersburg version for such companies as the Vic-Wells Ballet (precursor of today&#x27;s Royal Ballet).

==Plot==

Dr. Coppélius is a doctor who has made a life-size dancing doll. It is so lifelike that Franz, a village youth, becomes infatuated with it and sets aside his heart&#x27;s true desire, Swanhilda. She shows him his folly by dressing as the doll, pretending to make it come to life and ultimately saving him from an untimely end at the hands of the inventor.

;Act I

The story begins during a town festival to celebrate the arrival of a new bell. The town crier announces that, when it arrives, anyone who becomes married will be awarded a special gift of money. Swanhilda and Franz plan to marry during the festival. However, Swanhilda becomes unhappy with Franz because he seems to be paying more attention to a girl named Coppélia, who sits motionless on the balcony of a nearby house. The house belongs to a mysterious and faintly diabolical inventor, Doctor Coppélius. Although Coppélia spends all of her time sitting motionless and reading, Franz is mesmerized by her beauty and is determined to attract her attention. Still upset with Franz, Swanhilda shakes an ear of wheat to her head: if it rattles, then she will know that Franz loves her. Upon doing this, however, she hears nothing. When she shakes it by Franz&#x27;s head, he also hears nothing; but then he tells her that it rattles. However, she does not believe him and runs away heartbroken.

Later on, Dr. Coppelius leaves his house and is heckled by a group of boys. After shooing them away, he continues on without realizing that he dropped his keys in the melée. Swanhilda finds the keys, which gives her the idea of learning more about Coppélia. She and her friends decide to enter Dr. Coppelius&#x27; house. Meanwhile, Franz develops his own plan to meet Coppélia, climbing a ladder to her balcony.

;Act II

Swanhilda and her friends find themselves in a large room filled with people. However, the occupants aren&#x27;t moving. The girls discover that, rather than people, these are life-size mechanical dolls. They quickly wind them up and watch them move. Swanhilda also finds Coppélia behind a curtain and discovers that she, too, is a doll.

Dr. Coppelius returns home to find the girls. He becomes angry with them, not only for trespassing but for also disturbing his workroom. He kicks them out and begins cleaning up the mess. However, upon noticing Franz at the window, Coppélius invites him in. The inventor wants to bring Coppélia to life but, to do that, he needs a human sacrifice. With a magic spell, he will take Franz&#x27;s spirit and transfer it to Coppélia. After Dr. Coppelius proffers him some wine laced with sleeping powder, Franz begins to fall asleep. The inventor then readies his magic spell.

However, Dr. Coppelius did not expel all the girls: Swanhilda is still there, hidden behind a curtain. She dresses up in Coppélia&#x27;s clothes and pretends that the doll has come to life. She wakes Franz and then winds up all the mechanical dolls to aid their escape. Dr. Coppelius becomes confused and then saddened when he finds a lifeless Coppélia behind the curtain.

;Act III

Swanhilda and Franz are about to make their wedding vows when the angry Dr. Coppelius appears, claiming damages. Dismayed at having caused such an upset, Swanhilda offers Dr. Coppelius her dowry in return for his forgiveness. However, Franz tells Swanhilda to keep her dowry and offers to pay Dr. Coppelius instead. At that point, the mayor intervenes and gives Dr. Coppelius a bag of money, which placates him. Swanhilda and Franz are married and the entire town celebrates by dancing.

(Note: In some Russian versions of the ballet, after getting caught, Swanhilda confesses to Dr. Coppelius about what she and her friends did and her situation with Franz. Coppelius decides to forgive Swanhilda and teach her how to act like a doll coming to life to fool Franz, thus ending Act 2 on a happier note.)

==Influence and background==
Doctor Coppelius is not unlike Hoffmann&#x27;s sinister Herr Drosselmeyer in &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; or the macabre Svengali-like travelling magician of the same name in Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;.

The part of Franz was danced &quot;en travesti&quot; by Eugénie Fiocre, a convention that pleased the male members of the Jockey-Club de Paris and was retained in Paris until after World War II.

The festive wedding-day &quot;divertissements&quot; in the village square that occupy Act III are often deleted in modern danced versions.

Some influence on this story comes from travelling shows of the late 18th and early 19th centuries starring mechanical automata. This field of entertainment has been under-documented, but a recent survey of the field is contained in &quot;The Mechanical Turk&quot; by Tom Standage (2002).

==Alternative versions==
===Opera Variant===
A variation of the &quot;Coppélia&quot; story is contained in Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s opera, &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, a fictional work about the same Hoffmann who wrote the story that inspired &quot;Coppélia&quot;. The opera consists of a prologue, three fantastic tales in which Hoffmann is a participant, and an epilogue. In the first story, based on &quot;Der Sandmann&quot;, Hoffmann falls in love with a mechanical doll, Olympia, but in this case, the story has a melancholy tinge as the doll was destroyed by Dr. Coppelius, who share the same name as Coppelius who wants Coppélia to come to life, after he didn&#x27;t get a check from Spalanzani for Olympia&#x27;s eyes.

===San Francisco Ballet===
In 1939, San Francisco Ballet produced a version of &quot;Coppélia&quot; choreographed by Willam Christensen which was the first American complete version of the ballet. It starred Willam Christensen as Franz, Earl Riggins as Dr. Coppelius, and Janet Reed as Swanhilda and was an instant hit.

===Balanchine===
In 1974, George Balanchine choreographed a version of &quot;Coppélia&quot; for the New York City Ballet. He was assisted by Alexandra Danilova, who had performed the title role many times during her dancing career. She staged the Petipa choreography for Act II. Balanchine created new choreography for Act III and for the mazurka, czardas and Franz&#x27;s variation in Act I. Patricia McBride danced the role of Swanhilda the friendliest girl; Helgi Tomasson danced the role of Franz; Shaun O&#x27;Brian portrayed Dr. Coppélius. In Act III, Balanchine added 24 young girls to dance and be in the scene during Waltz of the Hours, Dawn (L&#x27;aurore), Prayer, and Work (Le travail) variations.

===Second Life - LPBA===
From 2011 the Little Princess Ballet Academy (LPBA) has performed &quot;Coppélia&quot; on the virtual platform &quot;Second Life&quot;. The adaptation follows the original in three acts, but the mime parts are problematic to perform in Second Life and has been changed, together with some changes in the sequences. All parts are played by individual avatars.

===Louisville Ballet===
In 2015, the Louisville Ballet produced a version of &quot;Coppélia&quot;, choreographed by Robert Curran, that is set in Louisville&#x27;s Germantown neighborhood in 1917, just months after the United States has entered World War I. In this version, Franz and a handful of other enlistees stationed at Camp Taylor all plan to marry their fiancées the next day, right before they depart for Europe.

===Monte Carlo Ballet Company - Coppel-I-A===
In 2019 Jean-Christophe Maillot created a modernized version of &quot;Coppélia&quot; for the Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo&quot;,&quot; calling it &quot;Coppél-i-A&quot;. In it, Coppelia is an android with artificial intelligence. The original music was rewritten by Maillot&#x27;s brother Bertrand Maillot to suit the dystopian theme.

=== Coppelia - feature film ===

A family feature film, &quot;Coppelia&quot;, was released in 2021, directed and written by Jeff Tudor, Steven De Beul and Ben Tesseur. The film has no dialogue and mixes live action dance with animation. It was inspired by choreographer Ted Brandsen&#x27;s 2008 production created for Dutch National Ballet. In Brandsen&#x27;s production, and in the film, Doctor Coppelius is updated from toymaker to cosmetic surgeon and Coppelia is a robot. The movie deals with issues such as the pressures of social media, the lure of superficial beauty and the importance of being yourself. The film stars ballerina, author and activist Michaela DePrince, Daniel Camargo, Vito Mazzeo, Darcey Bussell, Irek Mukahmedov, Sasha Mukahmedov, Jan Kooijman, Igone de Jongh and artists of Dutch National Ballet. Composer Maurizio Malagnini wrote the original score. The movie premiered at Annecy Festival 2021 and won the Golden Punt for Best Fiction Feature at the 40th Cambridge Film Festival.

<text>Soewondo Air Force Base is currently a military airbase in Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia. Before 2013, this airport served commercial flights, and was known as Polonia International Airport () which was the principal airport serving Medan, about from the downtown; it used to serve flights to several Indonesian and Malaysian cities, along with a flight to Singapore and Thailand. Previous international flights had been opened to Hong Kong, Taipei, Amsterdam, Abu Dhabi, Phuket, Chennai, Johor Bahru, Malacca and Ipoh.

At the end of its service as civil airport, Polonia was the fourth largest airport in Indonesia after Soekarno–Hatta, Juanda, and I Gusti Ngurah Rai, in terms of passenger numbers. Passenger service charges for each passenger departing through the domestic terminal was IDR 35,000 ($4.1) and IDR 75,000 ($8.8) for the international terminal.

All flights and services from this airport shifted to Kuala Namu International Airport on 25 July 2013. Following the airport&#x27;s opening, Polonia&#x27;s ICAO code was changed from WIMM to WIMK, since WIMM is assigned for Kuala Namu.

Now as Soewondo Air Force Base, the airport belongs to the Indonesian Air Force. It hosts the Western Surveillance Wing including eight CN-235 tactical surveillance airplanes.

==History==
The airport&#x27;s former name is taken from the plantation area owned by a Pole, Baron Ludwik Michalski in which it is situated. Polonia originates from the Latin name of the country of Poland. Michalski was a veteran of 1863 January Uprising against the Imperial Russian rule, after which he fled to Switzerland. In 1872, Michalski obtained a concession from the Dutch East Indies administration for a tobacco plantation in Medan. He named the plantation after the country of his birth, which at that time was not an independent state.

In 1879 the concession was handed over to &quot;Deli Maatschappij&quot; (Deli MIJ) or &quot;NV Deli Maskapai&quot;. In 1924, Dutch KLM test pilot N. J. Thomassen à Thuessink van der Hoop planned to fly on a Fokker F.VII in a pioneering flight from the Netherlands. Therefore, Deli MIJ who controlled that piece of land handed it over for the land to become the first airstrip in Medan.

By the time the news had arrived, it was too late to prepare a proper landing strip at Polonia. As a result, van der Hoop, together with Lieutenant H van Weerden Poelman of the Army Aviation Department and KLM flight engineer P. A. van den Broeke landed on a horse-racing track called Deli Renvereeniging and were greeted by the Sultan of Deli, Sulaiman Syaiful Alamsyah.

After this first landing, the Assistant Resident of Eastern Sumatra C.S. Van Kempen urged the Netherlands East Indies administration in Batavia to allocate the necessary funding to finish the airport at Polonia. In 1928 the airport was officially opened which was marked with the landing of six aircraft owned by KNILM, (&quot;not&quot; a subsidiary of KLM) on a temporary hardened dirt runway. From 1930, KLM and KNILM started expanding its network to Medan. It was only in 1936 that the airport&#x27;s 600-metre permanent runway was finished.

In 1975, according to a joint decree issued by the Department of Defence and Security, Department of Transportation, and Department of Finance, the airport was jointly managed between the Indonesian Air Force and the Civil Aviation. From 1985, according to the Government Regulation No. 30-year 1975, the management became the responsibility of Perum Angkasa Pura which subsequently became PT Angkasa Pura II (Persero) after 1 January 1994.

Polonia Airport is now closed to commercial aviation and replaced by Kualanamu International Airport.

The airport&#x27;s last arrival on 24 July 2013 was AirAsia from Bandung at 23:50 WIB. The airport was closed right after the last landing. The last activities in the airport were the ferry flights after official closing ceremony at 00:00 WIB and the cease of transportation at 00:30 WIB. The first ferry flight, a Garuda Indonesia aircraft, received a water salute before taking off from Polonia Airport and after landing at Kualanamu Airport. It carried the Minister of State-owned Enterprise Dahlan Iskan along with the Deputy Minister of Transportation and other officials.

After the ferry flights were completed, all of the Polonia Airport&#x27;s activity officially shifted to Kualanamu International Airport. Polonia Airport is now used as an air force base.

==Facilities==
The airport is located on 144 hectares land area. There is a single asphalt runway (05/23) which is 3000 m long and 45 m wide, but has only 2,900 m of usable length. There is no run-off space beyond the runway thresholds, and the airfield is surrounded by residential areas. It is often said that its location in a residential district, the wealthy Polonia area, is due to a superstition that the loud noises from aircraft drive away malevolent spirits.

Until recently, the airport consisted of an international and domestic terminal. A fire in the international arrivals area in 2006 caused damage to the airport, reducing the baggage reclaim area to a small section inside the terminal. On 2 December 2007, the domestic terminal was damaged by another fire. There were no injuries, and the separate international terminal was not affected.

The airport suffered from overcrowding, serving 7.5 million passengers annually in facilities designed to handle only 900,000 passengers. The other problems were no orderly parking space for taxis, too many porters and garbage control. These problems should be resolved by the construction of Kualanamu International Airport. Construction commenced 29 June 2006. It became Indonesia&#x27;s 2nd-largest airport after Soekarno–Hatta International Airport and commenced operations on 25 July 2013.

Once, there was a dilemma of whether or not to upgrade Polonia International Airport, due to the delay of the finishing of the new Kualanamu International Airport. This dilemma made PT Angkasa Pura II pledge to fix access roads between Mustang Street and Imam Bonjol Street.

<doc id="898348" wikidata="Q10314595" url="?curid=898348" title="Kōmeitō (1962–1998)">
<text>The Kōmeitō (), also known as the Kōmei Party and Clean Government Party (CGP), was a political party in Japan, initiated by Daisaku Ikeda, and described by various authors as the &quot;political arm&quot; of Soka Gakkai.

Kōmeitō was considered a centre to centre-left political party of the progressive camp until the 1990s. However, since the 1990s, Kōmeitō has become politically closer to the right-wing LDP and has become a centre to centre-right conservative party.

==History==
The party was established in January 1962 as the Kōmei Seiji Renmei (&quot;Clean Government League&quot;) by the Sōka Gakkai, an organization that promoted Nichiren Buddhism. Running as independents, three members of the Sōka Gakkai had been elected to the House of Councillors in the 1956 elections, with the 1959 elections seeing nine members elected. It also had several members elected to local assemblies.

In 1957, a group of Young Men&#x27;s Division members campaigning for a Gakkai candidate in an Osaka House of Councillors by-election were arrested for distributing money, cigarettes, and caramels at supporters&#x27; residences, in violation of elections law, and on July 3 of that year, at the beginning of an event memorialized as the &quot;Osaka Incident,&quot; Daisaku Ikeda was arrested in Osaka. He was taken into custody in his capacity as Sōka Gakkai&#x27;s Youth Division Chief of Staff for overseeing activities that constituted violations of elections law. He spent two weeks in jail and appeared in court forty-eight times before he was cleared of all charges in January 1962.

Amongst its policies, the new party supported the 1947 constitution and opposed nuclear weapons. Headed by Harashima Kōji. In the July 1962 elections the new party won nine seats in the House of Councillors.

On 17 November 1964 the party was renamed Kōmeitō. In 1968, fourteen of its members were convicted of forging absentee ballots in Shinjuku, and eight were sentenced to prison for electoral fraud. In the 1960s it was widely criticized for violating the separation of church and state, and in February 1970 all three major Japanese newspapers printed editorials demanding that the party reorganize. It eventually broke apart based on promises to segregate from Soka Gakkai.

In 1969, the party was struck by a scandal, known as the &quot;Freedom of press incident&quot;. It was revealed that Daisaku Ikeda had tried to stop the publication of two books critical of the Soka Gakkai and the Komeito. Ikeda was forced to make a public apology, and then announced the separation of the party and the religious organization.

In the 1980s &quot;Akahata&quot; discovered that many Soka Gakkai members were rewarding acquaintances with presents in return for Komeito votes, and that Okinawa residents had changed their addresses to elect Komeito politicians. It was also revealed that while the party was technically separate from the Soka Gakkai, monetary donations made that were tax exempt were being funneled into funding for the Kōmeitō party as revealed by an expelled Kōmeitō member of the Tokyo municipal assembly.

It was usually supportive of the Japan Socialist Party, and opposed the LDP (Liberal Democratic Party), the major ruling party at that time.

Kōmeitō did quite well, and in 1993, when the LDP was for the first time declared an opposition party, the Kōmeitō became one of the ruling parties, headed by the liberal Japan New Party, but which also included the Democratic Socialist Party, Japan Renewal Party, the New Party Sakigake, and the Japan Socialist Party. In 1994, the latter two parties left the coalition, and in July they took over the rule, making another coalition with the LDP. The Kōmeitō was again thrown into opposition.

On December 5, 1994, The Kōmeitō split into two parties. The Lower House chairs and some of Upper House chairs formed Kōmeitō New Party, and five days later, they joined into the New Frontier Party. The others, i.e. local assembly members and the rest of the Upper House chairs, formed Kōmei and independent friend of the New Frontier Party.

In 1998, however, the New Frontier Party dissolved, and former Kōmeitō members formed New Peace Party and Reform Club. They merged with Kōmei in the same year and then became known as the NKP (New Kōmeitō Party). The NKP adopted a more conservative agenda than the former Kōmeitō and in 1999 they supported the ruling party, the LDP.

<doc id="898349" wikidata="Q13426124" url="?curid=898349" title="Aretas Akers-Douglas, 1st Viscount Chilston">
<text>Aretas Akers-Douglas, 1st Viscount Chilston (born Aretas Akers; 21 October 1851 – 15 January 1926) was a British Conservative statesman who sat in the House of Commons from 1880 until he was raised to the peerage in 1911. He notably served as Home Secretary under Arthur Balfour between 1902 and 1905. He was highly effective as Conservative Party whip, keeping the rank and file in line.

==Background and education==
Akers-Douglas was born in West Malling, Kent, the son of Reverend Aretas Akers, parson of West Malling, and his wife Frances Maria, daughter of Francis Holles Brandram. He was educated at Eton and University College, Oxford, before being called to the Bar, Inner Temple, in 1875. That same year he took the additional surname of Douglas under royal licence in accordance with a relative&#x27;s will.

==Political career==

In 1880, Akers-Douglas was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament for East Kent and held it until it was divided under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. In 1883, Akers-Douglas was appointed whip to the Conservatives, where he proved highly effective in keeping the back-benchers in line and working with the party leader Lord Salisbury.

In the 1885 general election, he was elected MP for St Augustine&#x27;s in the county of Kent. He became Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, and retained this post (with a short interval in 1886 when Gladstone returned to power) for the next seven years. He became a Privy Counsellor in 1891.

In 1895, Akers-Douglas was appointed First Commissioner of Works, with a seat in the Cabinet. Seven years later, when Arthur Balfour became Prime Minister, he became Home Secretary on 11 August 1902, and resigned three and a half years later when the Liberals took power.

In 1911, Akers-Douglas was created Viscount Chilston, of Boughton Malherbe in the County of Kent, and Baron Douglas of Baads, in the County of Midlothian. The viscountcy was named for his country house at Chilston Park. During the First World War, Lord Chilston was Chief County Director for the British Red Cross Society and St John Ambulance, in recognition of which he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours. Apart from his political career he was a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for Kent, Edinburgh and Dumfries and a lieutenant in the East Kent Yeoman Cavalry. He was chairman of the Midland Counties Electric Supply Company Limited. 

==Family==
Lord Chilston married Adeline Mary, daughter of Horatio Austen-Smith, in 1875. They had two sons and five daughters. 
He died at his London home in January 1926, aged 74, and was buried at Boughton Malherbe, Kent. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, Aretas, who became British Ambassador to Russia. Lady Chilston died in February 1929.

<text>The Philadelphia Big 5, known simply as the &quot;Big 5&quot;, is an association of six college athletic programs in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is not a conference, but rather a group of NCAA Division I basketball schools who compete for the city’s collegiate championship.

The Big 5 originally consisted of the University of Pennsylvania, La Salle University, Saint Joseph&#x27;s University, Temple University, and Villanova University. At the start of the 2023–24 season, the Big 5 expanded to include Drexel University. Drexel, La Salle, Penn, Saint Joseph&#x27;s, and Temple are located in Philadelphia proper, while Villanova is located in a nearby Main Line suburb of the same name. Three of the six schools (La Salle, Saint Joseph&#x27;s and Villanova) are Catholic, while Temple is the only public university in the Big 5.

From its founding in 1955 until 2023, the five teams teams played each other once in a round-robin format to determine the Big 5 champion. The team(s) with the best record was then determined as the Big 5 champion. After the addition of Drexel, the format was changed, and the six teams were split into two pods, with all of the teams participating in a same-day, triple-header showcase event on the first Saturday in December known as the Big 5 Classic. The winner of the first-place game during the showcase, which features the winners of each pod, determines the Big 5 champion for the season.

The women&#x27;s teams competed in the same round-robin format from 1979 until 2024, when the women&#x27;s counterpart of the Big 5 Classic was created. Following the same scheduling structure as the men&#x27;s, the women&#x27;s Big 5 Classic is played on the first Friday in December, one day before the men&#x27;s showcase.

Big 5 schools represent some of the oldest and most successful men&#x27;s basketball programs in the nation. Three of the six teams—Temple (7th), Villanova (19th), and Penn (22nd)—are in the top-50 for all-time Division I basketball victories. From 1977 to 2022, at least one team from the Big 5 appeared in the men&#x27;s NCAA Tournament. 

Both Villanova&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams hold the most Big 5 titles, with 29 and 21 titles, respectively. 

Each year the Herb Good Basketball Club selects All-Big 5 teams, as well as a coach of the year. The most outstanding player in Big 5 competition receives the Robert V. Geasey Trophy.

The Big 5 creed reads: &quot;They say there&#x27;s no trophy for winning the Big Five. They must not be from Philadelphia.&quot;

==History==
===Original format (1955–2023)===

The Big 5 was formed in 1955, a year after La Salle won the 1954 NCAA basketball tournament. The group showcased Philadelphia&#x27;s basketball talent and helped pay for the upkeep on the Palestra, located on the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s campus, where the games historically took place. Nicknamed &quot;Palestra Pandemonium&quot;, games were typically scheduled as double or triple-headers. All schools agreed to split ticket and concessions revenues equally once Penn was paid for upkeep costs on the Palestra. The arrangement promoted already intense intra-city collegiate basketball rivalries dating back three decades or more.

In 1979, a women&#x27;s version of the competition began play, following the same round-robin format as the men&#x27;s.

During the heyday of the Big 5, many major college programs, especially in the northeastern United States, were independents. As the Big East and Atlantic 10 conferences expanded to cover most of the Northeast (Villanova joined the Big East, while Temple, Saint Joseph&#x27;s, and La Salle joined the Atlantic 10; Penn is a member of the Ivy League), and as college basketball became increasingly driven by television and its need to appeal to a broad national audience, the local character of the Big 5 became a liability. The men&#x27;s round-robin series ended in 1991.

In 1999, the men&#x27;s round-robin series was revived and continued until the 2022–23 season. However, the revival resulted in some changes, as the schools would no longer evenly split the proceeds from the games, and the Palestra was no longer used for every game in the series.

The Big 5 formed intense rivalries among some of the schools. The most notable is the rivalry between Saint Joseph&#x27;s and Villanova, also known as the Holy War. The rivalry is influenced by the two schools&#x27; Catholic affiliations, with Saint Joseph&#x27;s being a Jesuit university, and Villanova being Augustinian.

The rivalry between Saint Joseph&#x27;s and Temple saw increased tension in the 2000s after an incident known as &quot;Goon Gate&quot;. In a 2005 matchup between the two schools, Hall of Fame Temple head coach John Chaney, who was frustrated with the officiating in the game, ordered his players to intentionally foul Saint Joseph&#x27;s forward John Bryant, a move that Chaney described as sending in &quot;the goons&quot;. Bryant fractured his arm as a result of the fouling, drawing anger from many Saint Joseph&#x27;s fans, and Chaney&#x27;s actions were seen as highly unsportsmanlike. Chaney would serve a suspension for the remainder of the season as a result of the incident.

Following Villanova&#x27;s national championships in 2016 and 2018, a debate has emerged among Philadelphia sports fans about whether Villanova should be classified as a &quot;Philly school&quot;, along with whether their national championships should be considered part of Philadelphia sports. Fans of other Big 5 schools contend that Villanova does not qualify because its campus is outside Philadelphia&#x27;s city limits. In contrast, Villanova fans argue that because the team plays select home games are at the Wells Fargo Center, and that their championship parades in both 2016 and 2018 were held in Center City, Philadelphia, the school has a clear connection to the city.

===Addition of Drexel and Big 5 Classic (2023–present)===

Throughout the Big 5&#x27;s existence, some suggested adding Drexel. Drexel is a member of the City 6, which is an intra-city intramural competition among the six schools. These talks amplified during the 2006–07 season, as Drexel beat three of the four Big 5 teams it played, but no changes were made.

In December 2022, &quot;The Athletic&quot; reported that administrators at the Big 5 schools and Drexel were discussing &quot;trying to find a way to resuscitate the Big 5.&quot; The meetings came after a sparsely attended Big 5 doubleheader at the Palestra. According to &quot;The Athletic&quot;, talks about reforms to the Big 5 began prior to the doubleheader as school administrators felt there was a decline in the series due to Villanova&#x27;s recent dominance and many of the top local recruits opting not to play college basketball in Philadelphia.

In January 2023, the Big 5 announced a new format for the men&#x27;s competition, which would include the addition of Drexel as a member of the series. In the new format, the six teams are split into two three-team pods, who play each other in November. On the first Saturday in December, the &quot;Big 5 Classic&quot;, a triple-header showcase event, is held with a fifth place, third place, and championship game all taking place at the Wells Fargo Center. Some criticized the move as it eliminated the full round-robin nature of the Big 5 and games would no longer be primarily played at the Palestra.

In June 2024, the athletic directors of the Big 5 member schools introduced the women&#x27;s Big 5 Classic, along with the addition of Drexel for the women&#x27;s competition. Like the men&#x27;s showcase, the six teams are split into the same two pods, and a same-day, triple-header event is held on the day before the men&#x27;s edition of the showcase, the first Friday in December. However, unlike the men&#x27;s showcase, the women&#x27;s event is held at the Finneran Pavilion, located on the campus of Villanova University.

===Men===


From 1955–56 to 1990–91, and again from 1999–00 to 2022–23, all Big 5 men&#x27;s basketball teams played each other once per season for a total of four games per team. Since 1956, there have been three instances of a five-way tie among all member schools, which occurred in 1980–81 (2–2 records), 1991–92 (1–1 records), and 1997–98 (1–1 records), though the latter two cases were during the period when there was no full round-robin series, so not every team played all four other teams.

==Other uses==
Although known primarily of an association of the Philadelphia college basketball teams, students from Big 5 schools also coordinate frequent student government meetings. The governments consist of La Salle, the University of Pennsylvania, Temple, Saint Joseph&#x27;s, and Drexel. Prior to Drexel&#x27;s admission to the Big 5, the school would typically be represented instead of Villanova due to meetings primarily revolving around issues in Philadelphia proper. Villanova is the only Big 5 college not located within the city limits.

<doc id="898358" wikidata="Q6978844" url="?curid=898358" title="National Taxpayers Union">
<text>The National Taxpayers Union (NTU) is a fiscally conservative taxpayer advocacy organization and taxpayers union in the United States, founded in 1977 by James Dale Davidson. NTU says that it is the oldest taxpayer advocacy organization in the nation. It is closely affiliated with a non-profit foundation, the National Taxpayers Union Foundation (NTUF). The organization has ranked politicians on their perceived fiscal responsibility, in the eyes of the National Taxpayers Union.

==Policy positions==
The National Taxpayers Union has worked to enact constitutional limits on government taxes, spending and debt. The organization also played a role in Federal income tax indexing It also worked for the passage of a Taxpayer Bill of Rights.

The NTU favors either a Flat Tax or the FairTax (a national sales tax with rebate) for the United States, as opposed to the current income tax system. The organization argues in favor of the line-item veto for the president. NTU generally opposes crop subsidies by the government (such as for sugar and ethanol). The organization&#x27;s briefs and policy papers oppose the federal estate tax and support deregulation. NTU also provides information on &quot;Congressional &amp; Executive Pay/Perks&quot; (e.g., NTU estimates the public pensions payments for Members of Congress), and NTU has called for reforms to deny a publicly funded pension to Members of Congress convicted of a felony.

==Legislation==

===Opposed===
* Temporary Debt Limit Extension Act (S. 540; 113th Congress) – a bill that would suspend the United States debt ceiling until March 15, 2015. The National Taxpayers Union opposed this bill and criticised politicians from both parties saying, &quot;this year, as the limit approached, most Democrats refused to discuss the debt problem at all. Republicans opted to stress important, though mostly unrelated policy goals, thus failing to focus on the key issue at hand.&quot; NTU expressed the opinion that spending reforms should be dealt with, instead of just increasing the debt limit.

===Supported===
* Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (S. 994; 113th Congress) – a bill that aims to make information on federal expenditures more easily accessible and transparent. The bill would require the U.S. Department of the Treasury to establish common standards for financial data provided by all government agencies and to expand the amount of data that agencies must provide to the government website, USASpending. The NTU urged Representatives to vote in favor of the bill, saying that &quot;this legislation would take an important step toward greater accountability to taxpayers by providing more information on how their hard-earned dollars are spent.&quot; The NTU argued that &quot;the DATA Act would bring increased transparency to a system that is too often rife with favoritism, waste, and fraud. As the federal government continues to make heavy demands on the public&#x27;s paychecks, taxpayers deserve the opportunity to find out more details about how the money they send to Washington is being spent.&quot;
* American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014 (H.R. 4438; 113th Congress) – a bill that would amend the Internal Revenue Code to modify the calculation method and the rate for the tax credit for qualified research expenses that expired at the end of 2013 and would make that modified credit permanent. NTU &quot;urged&quot; Representatives to vote in favor of the bill because it &quot;would simplify and make permanent the 20 percent tax credit for research and development expenses.&quot; The NTU argued that making this tax credit permanent was &quot;an important step toward creating a healthier business climate, providing broad-based relief, and promoting economic growth.&quot; The NTU also argued that it was important for the credit to become permanent because major research and development investments often take multiple years to do and it can be difficult to plan them when a tax credit is only going to last for one or two years.

==Activities==

* Balanced Budget Amendment – NTU has been a proponent for a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) to the Constitution.
* Government Spending Transparency – The National Taxpayers Union has been a proponent of the &quot;Google Government&quot; movement. More specifically, the organization calls for the creation of searchable Internet databases that provide information on state government grant and contract expenditures.

NTU is a founding sponsor of www.ShowMeTheSpending.org, a website dedicated to online government spending transparency.
* NTU Rates Congress – NTU rates U.S. Representatives and Senators on their congressional votes. NTU Rates Congress includes &quot;every vote that significantly affects taxes, spending, debt, and regulatory burdens on consumers and taxpayers.&quot; NTU then assigns weights to the votes, reflecting the importance of each vote&#x27;s effect on federal spending, when calculating each officials score.

A grade of &quot;A&quot; indicates the organization views the member as a strong supporter of responsible tax and spending policies. The organization gives these members of Congress the &quot;Taxpayers&#x27; Friend Award.&quot;
* Research – NTU writes policy papers on many subjects they view as important to taxpayers. The organization also sends issue briefs to its members throughout the country outlining topics and issues that might be of interest to them.
* NoTaxHikers.org – NTU launched www.NoTaxHikers.org in fall 2008. The site asks visitors to pledge not to vote for tax hikers.
* Keep The Caps – NTU launched www.KeepTheCaps.com and BillionDollarBaseball.org in fall 2013. The campaign sought to foster grassroots support and pressure Congress to maintain the spending caps created in the Budget Control Act two years prior.

==History==

James Dale Davidson began the organization in 1969.

In 1977, the National Taxpayers Union Foundation was chartered to be the educational affiliate of the National Taxpayers Union in order to provide information about the benefits of lower taxes and limited government.

In 1970, Davidson hired A. Earnest Fitzgerald, a United States Air Force analyst, as the president of NTU. In 1978 Grover Norquist was named executive director; after his departure in 1982, he was replaced by former Maryland State Senate Majority Leader George Snyder.

In 1991, The National Taxpayers Union Foundation&#x27;s signature project, the &quot;BillTally&quot;, was started to reveal the legislative spending agendas of Members of Congress by analyzing the costs and savings of nearly every bill that they sponsor and cosponsor. BillTally provides the public and media with the only comprehensive look at how individual Members of Congress want to spend your tax dollars.

In 1997, Davidson left NTU; John Berthoud was named president and served until his death in late 2007. Duane Parde was named president of the organization following the death of Berthoud.

The current President of the National Taxpayers Union is Pete Sepp. Taking over the position in 1988, Sepp has made Congressional testimonies, policy papers, initiated tax revolts and played a role in the creation of the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment. Through appearances on Fox, CNN and CNBC as well as publications such as the Wall Street Journal and USA Today, Sepp has made a large impact over his time in the Presidency. He states, &quot;We here at NTU promise to fight for taxpayers, so as to ensure that all Americans are able to pursue their dreams without the heavy hand of government holding them back.&quot; Together with board chair Rob Solt, and executive vice-president Brandon Arnold, the operations team of the National Taxpayers Union work towards favorable legislative outcomes for America&#x27;s taxpayers such as less unnecessary government spending, tax reforms and free enterprise.

On April 15, 2009 hundreds of thousands of people around the country showed up at Tea Party Protests. They were protesting the new government spending plan proposed by the Obama administration.

There was a National Taxpayers Union conference held from June 11–13 in 2009 held in Arlington, VA at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City Hotel. The convention was geared toward taxpayer activists who were working on taxpayer initiatives at a local and state level. The purpose of this conference was to keep the initiatives of the National Taxpayers Union alive and to get more of the public to understand their ideas.

In 2009 at the National Taxpayers convention, former Ohio secretary of State Ken Blackwell and former Missouri Governor Matt Blunt were guest speakers.

<text>Føroyskir Sosialistar (English: &quot;Faroese Socialists&quot;) or FS was a left-wing political party founded by Faroese students in Denmark in 1962.

== History ==
The party was first established in 1962 by Faroese students in Denmark under the name Oyggjaframi (). Initially the group was linked to &quot;Tjóðveldisflokkurin&quot;, but due to increasing communist influence in Oyggjaframi the party eventually broke relations with the group. In 1969 Oyggjaframi changed its name to Oyggjaframi–Føroyskir Sosialistar (English: &quot;Advancement for the Islands—Faroese Socialists&quot;). In 1972, the Tórshavn chapter of the party broke away to form Oyggjaframi (M-L). The remaining group was renamed Føroyskir Sosialistar. 

FS fought for the creation of a Faroese socialist republic and actively struggled against NATO. At the World Federation of Democratic Youth General Assembly in Varna, Bulgaria in 1974 FS was accepted as a member.

FS published the monthly magazine &quot;Framin&quot;, which carried the subtitle &quot;Føroyskt tíðarrit fyri sosialismu og sjálvstýri&quot; (English: &quot;Faroese magazine for socialism and independence&quot;) between 1962 and 1984 and &quot;Roðin&quot; between 1971 and 1982.</text><links>

<doc id="898363" wikidata="Q561494" url="?curid=898363" title="Pik Botha">
<text>Roelof Frederik &quot;Pik&quot; Botha, (27 April 1932 – 12 October 2018) was a South African politician who served as the country&#x27;s foreign minister in the last years of the apartheid era, the longest-serving in South African history. Known as a liberal within the party, Botha served to present a friendly, conciliatory face on the regime, while criticised internally. He was a leading contender for the leadership of the National Party upon John Vorster&#x27;s resignation in 1978, but was ultimately not chosen. Staying in the government after the first non-racial general election in 1994, he served under Mandela as Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs from 1994 to 1996.

While testifying at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Botha was one of the few officials to repent for his involvement in the apartheid government. He said he&#x27;d realized that apartheid was morally wrong in the 1970s, but didn&#x27;t do enough to &quot;turn the tide&quot; against the regime and prevent atrocities from being committed.

Botha was nicknamed &#x27;Pik&#x27; (short for &quot;pikkewyn&quot;, Afrikaans for &#x27;penguin&#x27;) because of a perceived likeness to a penguin in his stance, accentuated when he wore a suit.

He was not related to Prime Minister (later State President) P. W. Botha, under whom he served as foreign minister for 11 years.

==Early life==
Botha was born at Rustenburg in the Transvaal, to Roelof Frederik Botha and Maria Elizabeth Dreyer. 
At the age of four, he was struck by meningitis in Lourenço Marques (modern-day Maputo, Mozambique); he received treatment at a small hospital in Barberton, Transvaal, and his mother vowed that if he survived, he would become a church minister.

Botha attended Paul Kruger Primary School, where his father was principal. He excelled in high school, becoming chairman of the debating society and officer in the school cadets. Botha was also a writer of both prose and poetry in Afrikaans, and his writing supplemented his salary in his early years as a diplomat. In his first year studying law at the University of Pretoria, a theologian explained to him that God would not expect him to keep his mother&#x27;s promise to become a church minister.

== Diplomat and lawyer ==

Botha began his career in the South African foreign service in 1953, serving in Sweden and West Germany. From 1963 to 1966, he served on the team representing South Africa at the International Court of Justice in The Hague in the matter of &quot;Ethiopia and Liberia v. South Africa&quot;, over the South African occupation of South-West Africa (now Namibia).

In 1966, Botha was appointed legal adviser at the Department of Foreign Affairs, in which capacity he served on the delegation representing South Africa at the United Nations from 1967 to 1977. In 1974, he was appointed South Africa&#x27;s permanent representative to the United Nations and presented his credentials to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim on 15 October 1974; in November of that year, however, South Africa was suspended from membership of the General Assembly and, over the ensuing years, the country was excluded from official participation in virtually all of the UN&#x27;s organs and agencies.

== Politician ==

In the elections of 1970 and 1974, Botha was elected to the House of Assembly as MP for Wonderboom in the Transvaal. In 1975, he was appointed South Africa&#x27;s Ambassador to the United States, in addition to his UN post. In 1977, he re-entered Parliament as MP for Westdene, and was appointed minister for foreign affairs by Prime Minister B. J. Vorster. He continued to represent Westdene for the remainder of his political career.

Botha entered the contest to be the leader of the National Party in 1978. He was allegedly considered Vorster&#x27;s favourite and received superior public support among whites (&quot;We want Pik!&quot;) but withdrew after criticism concerning his young age, lack of experience (having spent 16 months as foreign minister) and alleged liberal beliefs as opposed to the ultra-conservative NP machinery (in which he lacked a significant position), instead throwing his support behind P. W. Botha, who was ultimately elected.

In 1985, Botha helped to draft a speech that would have announced common decision-making on all levels in a single constitutional unit and a formula for bringing about the release of Nelson Mandela, but this draft was rejected by P. W. Botha.

The next year, he stated publicly (during a press conference in Parliament, asked by German journalist Thomas Knemeyer) that it would be possible for South Africa to be ruled by a black president provided that there were guarantees for minority rights, but was quickly forced to acknowledge that this position did not reflect government policy. Botha recalled in 2011 that he had been &quot;severely reprimanded and almost fired&quot; over his remarks. In early 1986 he was also an instrumental figure in the South African government&#x27;s negotiations with the Commonwealth Eminent Persons&#x27; Group (EPG). Although the Group&#x27;s mission was aborted after the South African Military launched cross-border raids on ANC bases on 19 May, in the preceding months Pik Botha had engaged in extensive talks with the Group about a possible path to negotiations, including calls for a suspension of violence and the unbanning of the ANC.

Throughout 1988 Botha was instrumental in lengthy peace talks between South Africa, Cuba, and the People&#x27;s Republic of Angola aimed at ending the South African Border War. On 13 December 1988, Botha and Defence Minister Magnus Malan ratified the Brazzaville Protocol, which led to the effective cessation of hostilities in that conflict.

=== Namibian independence ===

On 22 December 1988, Botha signed the Tripartite Accord involving Angola, Cuba and South Africa at United Nations headquarters in New York City which led to the implementation of Security Council Resolution 435, and to South Africa&#x27;s granting of independence to Namibia.

On 21 December 1988, Botha, with a 22-strong South African delegation from Johannesburg, was initially booked to travel to the Namibian independence ratification ceremony in New York on Pan Am Flight 103 from London. Instead, the booking was cancelled as he and six delegates took an earlier flight, thereby avoiding the fatal PA103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.

===National unity===
Botha subsequently served as Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs in South Africa&#x27;s first post-apartheid government from 1994 to 1996 under President Nelson Mandela. Botha had first met Mandela in May 1990 at the historic Groote Schuur Minute, and was highly impressed by Mandela&#x27;s knowledge of Afrikaner history.

Botha became deputy leader of the National Party in the Transvaal from 1987 to 1996. He retired from politics in 1996 when F. W. de Klerk withdrew the National Party from the government of national unity.

While testifying at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Botha was one of the few officials to repent for his involvement in the apartheid government. He said he&#x27;d realized that apartheid was morally wrong in the 1970s, but didn&#x27;t do enough to &quot;turn the tide&quot; against the regime and prevent atrocities from being committed, which he blamed on South African security forces.

In 2000, Botha declared his support for President Thabo Mbeki. 

In 2013, Botha expressed criticism for the government&#x27;s affirmative action policies saying that the South African government of 1994 would never have reached a constitutional settlement with the ANC had it insisted on its current affirmative action programme. In an interview on affirmative action, Botha publicly declared that he had never been a member of the ANC, and would not join under its current policies.

On 12 December 2013, Botha appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot;, hosted in Johannesburg, discussing the life and legacy of Nelson Mandela.

==Personal life==
Botha married Helena Bosman in 1953, with whom he had two daughters, Anna Hertzog and the artist Lien Botha as well as two sons, the rock musician Piet Botha (1955-2019) and the economist Roelof Botha. Among Botha&#x27;s eight grandchildren is grandson Arend Botha theologian and musician, and Roelof Botha, former CFO of PayPal. Helena died in 1996, after having been ill, including being partially paralysed, following a fall in her home in 1991. Two years later, Botha married Ina Joubert, a former journalist with the SABC.

Botha died of natural causes at his home in Pretoria on 12 October 2018 at the age of 86.

<text>Automatix Inc., founded in January 1980, was the first company to market industrial robots with built-in machine vision. Its founders were Victor Scheinman, inventor of the Stanford arm; Phillippe Villers, Michael Cronin, and Arnold Reinhold of Computervision; Jake Dias and Dan Nigro of Data General; Gordon VanderBrug, of NBS, Donald L. Pieper of General Electric and Norman Wittels of Clark University.

== Products ==
Initial product offerings included the Autovision machine vision system, the Robovision welding robot and the Cybervision electronic parts assembly system. Automatix was one of the first users of Motorola 68000 microprocessors, but because almost no software existed for the 68000 in 1980, Automatix had to develop its own operating system and a robotics scripting language, called &quot;RAIL&quot;. Its initial machine vision offering was based on software and hardware licensed from Stanford Research Institute. In the late 1980s, Automatix replaced the proprietary 68000 computer in its vision products with an Apple Macintosh II.
Automatix mostly used robot mechanisms imported from Hitachi at first and later from Yaskawa and KUKA. It did design and manufacture a Cartesian robot called the AID-600. The 600 was intended for use in precision assembly but was adapted for welding use, particularly Tungsten inert gas welding (TIG), which demands high accuracy and immunity from the intense electromagnetic interference that the TIG process creates. Automatix was the first company to market a vision-guided welding robot called Seamtracker. Structured laser light and monochromatic filters were used to allow an image to be seen in the presence of the welding arc. Another concept, invented by Mr. Scheinman, was RobotWorld, a system of cooperating small modules suspended from a 2-D linear motor. The product line was later sold to Yaskawa.

===Machine vision systems===
Automatix introduced several different machine vision systems during its history:
* Autovision I, 1981, designed for fast time to market, was based on Vision Module technology licensed from Stanford Research Institute (SRI). The AV I used an early Motorola 68000 KDM prototype board interfaced to a Unibus frame grabber board purchased from SRI. The frame grabber was designed for the General Electric TN-2200, an early solid state video camera with a 128 by 128 pixel array and C-mount lens. DECtape II drives were used for program and data storage.
* Autovision II, 1982, used a custom designed Versabus 68000 processor with a custom 8-channel RS-170 Versabus frame grabber employing an AMD Am2900 bit slice micro-controller, packaged in an industrially hardened NEMA-12 enclosure.
* Autovision IV, similar to AV II, but with a patented frame grabber using dual 68000s. Then-new Sony -inch floppy drives replaced DECtape.
* AV 5, same electronics as the AV IV, but in a rack mount package.
* AI 90, 1987, vision system based on an Apple Macintosh II repackaged in a rack mount industrial enclosure, with RAIL ported to Mac OS (MacRAIL). It was announced at the MacWorld Expo in Boston in 1987.
* Autovision 90, a rack mount Apple Quadra 950.
* Image Analyst, a software package for Macintosh computers, based on MacRAIL.

The Automatix AI-32 robot controller used the same processor, bus and RAIL language as the AV II, IV and 5, allowing frame grabber and processing boards to be added for integrated machine vision.

==Evolution and corporate merger==

Automatix raised large amounts of venture capital, and went public in 1983, but was not profitable until the early 1990s. In 1994, Automatix merged with another machine vision company, Itran Corp., to form Acuity Imaging, Inc. Acuity was acquired by &quot;Robotics Vision Systems Inc.&quot; (RVSI) in September 1995. As of 2004, RVSI supported the evolved Automatix machine vision package under the PowerVision brand.

In August 2005 RVSI itself was acquired by Siemens Energy and Automation who by mid-2008 are marketing the RVSI Visionscape and Hawkeye products alongside their own SIMATIC brand, some of which are re-branded DVT/Cognex smart cameras. In September 2008, Microscan Systems, Inc., of Renton, Washington, acquired Siemens&#x27; Machine Vision business, including Visionscape and Hawkeye. As of August 2016, the Powervision system developed by Automatix was still available from RPC Machine Vision Systems, a value added reseller of Microscan. However, in December 2017, Microscan was purchased by Omron Corporation, and its product lines, including MicroHawk and Visionscape, are sold through Omron&#x27;s distribution network.

<doc id="898378" wikidata="Q1564567" url="?curid=898378" title="Hidden ball trick">
<text>A hidden ball trick is a play in which a player deceives the opposing team about the location of the ball. Hidden ball tricks are most commonly observed in baseball, where the defence deceives the runner about the location of the ball, to tag out the runner. In goal-based sports (e.g., American football and lacrosse), the offence deceives the defence about the location of the ball, in an attempt to get the defense running the wrong way, such as in a fumblerooski.

==Baseball and softball==
In the sports of baseball and softball, the hidden ball trick usually involves a fielder using sleight of hand or misdirection to confuse a baserunner as to the location of the ball, allowing the fielder to tag out the runner unawares. Though several variations of the play exist, they usually involve a fielder keeping the ball without the runner&#x27;s knowledge, waiting for the runner to step off a base, and then quickly tagging the runner out. For the trick to work, the fielder (generally an infielder) must get the ball while the ball is still in play, and the runner must either not know that the fielder has the ball or think that the play is over. 

Fielders usually try to fool the runner by miming a throw to the pitcher or another defender while keeping the baseball out of sight, often in his glove. If the runner is not paying attention and assumes that the closest fielder no longer has the ball, he may stray off the base and be tagged out. A related tactic is to quickly re-tag the runner after an unsuccessful tag in the hope that his hand or foot has lost contact with the base after a slide but before time has been called.

In most situations, the balk rule precludes a pitcher from performing a hidden ball trick. In high school and college baseball, a balk is called (NFHS R6-S2-A5) if a runner or runners are on base and the pitcher, while he is not touching the pitcher&#x27;s plate, makes any motion naturally associated with his pitch, or he places his feet on or astride the pitcher&#x27;s plate or positions himself within approximately five feet of the pitcher&#x27;s plate without having the ball. In professional baseball, under Rule 6.02(a)(9), a balk occurs if the pitcher is standing on or astride of the pitching rubber without the ball. As play after a foul ball, hit batsman, or time out, must not resume until the pitcher is on the pitcher&#x27;s mound, the infielder cannot use these times to obtain the ball.

===Examples===
While variations exist, the use of the play in major league baseball is somewhat rare. Some say that the hidden-ball trick has been pulled fewer than 300 times in over 100 years of major league baseball.

A first baseman may attempt the play after a pitcher, in an attempt to pick off a runner, throws to first. The first baseman then fakes the throwback to the pitcher while keeping the ball in his glove, and if and when the runner leaves the base, tags the runner. Dave Bergman is a former first baseman who pulled this off on multiple occasions. A second baseman could attempt a similar play after a successful steal of second base, having received a throw from the catcher.

Third baseman Bill Coughlin was reputed to have been the master of the hidden ball trick. Although not verified, Coughlin reportedly pulled it off seven times. The first known recorded and successful example of Coughlin&#x27;s hidden ball trick was against the Detroit Tigers on September 24, 1901, as seen from a contemporary description of the game:In returning the sphere to the infield the ball was thrown to our tricky third baseman and he promptly did a little sleight-o&#x27;-hand work, his hands moving faster than coachers&#x27; eyes, and shoved the ball up under his arm and assumed his position as it there were nothing wrong. Carrick was standing in the box as if he were about to toss the globule over, and Cronin eased off the ottoman slightly, but enough to get him caught, and he returned to the bench amidst the jeers and howls of the populace.He did it again on September 3, , catching George Stone in the first inning. In Game 2 of the 1907 World Series, Coughlin caught Jimmy Slagle with a hidden ball trick, the only one in World Series history. The play went from Germany Schaefer to Coughlin.

Former second baseman Marty Barrett also successfully performed the trick more than once. After a runner reached second base on a ball hit to the outfield, and after receiving the throw-in from the outfield, he faked a throw to the pitcher while retaining the ball. To aid the deception, Barrett took the throw with his back to the runner, then placed the ball between the back of his glove and one of his fingers: this way, he exposed his glove to the runner without the ball in the pocket, suggesting that he did not have the ball. Other players have hidden the ball in their armpits.

Former third baseman Matt Williams used a different technique which asked the runner to step off the base so that Williams could sweep the dirt off it, then tagged out the runner when the runner complied. This worked twice.

Former third baseman Mike Lowell also made the trick work twice, each time after a throw-in from the outfield. The key to Lowell&#x27;s success was acting, placement, and waiting: acting as if nothing was on, standing away from the bag but not too far from it, and waiting, at least 10 seconds, until the runner on third took a few steps.

Willie Kamm was considered another master of the trick. On April 30, , in a game against the Cleveland Indians, Kamm was involved in a rare triple play involving a hidden-ball trick. The Indians had baserunners on first and second bases when Carl Lind grounded out to the shortstop. Johnny Hodapp, who had been on second base, tried to score but got caught in a rundown between third and home. Charlie Jamieson advanced to third. Kamm retrieved the ball and tagged both runners, whereupon the umpire ruled Hodapp out. Kamm then hid the ball under his arm and waited for Jamieson to step off the base. When he did so, Kamm tagged him out to complete the triple play.

On June 8, , shortstop Julio Lugo of the Boston Red Sox caught Alberto Callaspo of the Arizona Diamondbacks. However, third baseman Lowell, Lugo&#x27;s teammate, claimed it was not a true hidden ball trick since the pitcher did most of the work &quot;selling&quot; the trick. Before Lugo caught Callaspo, Lowell laid claim to the last successful hidden ball trick and held that position for eight years to the day. Lowell&#x27;s occurred on August 10, , when he, then with the Florida Marlins, caught the Arizona Diamondbacks Luis Terrero, with reliever Todd Jones on the mound. Lowell also caught Brian Schneider of the Montreal Expos in .

On July 12, 2013, San Diego Padres shortstop Everth Cabrera attempted to execute the hidden-ball trick on San Francisco Giants third baseman Pablo Sandoval after Sandoval hit a double. As pitcher Sean O&#x27;Sullivan walked onto the mound and Sandoval took his lead, Cabrera, while holding the ball, tagged Sandoval. However, Sandoval had requested and was granted time by second base umpire Laz Díaz immediately after his double. Because O&#x27;Sullivan never assumed his position on the pitcher&#x27;s plate with the baseball, the umpires appropriately never called &quot;Play&quot; and Cabrera&#x27;s tag of Sandoval was therefore not legal. The &quot;Umpire Ejection Fantasy League&quot; explains this is why a hidden-ball trick may never be executed after a base hit, mound visit, or other events in which &quot;time&quot; is called: to put the ball back into play, the pitcher must engage the rubber and if the pitcher engages the rubber without the ball, it is a balk under Rule 8.05(i).

On August 10, 2013, in a Tampa Bay loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, 5–0, Evan Longoria, Tampa Bay Rays&#x27;s third baseman pulled the trick in the fourth inning on Juan Uribe. With the bases loaded and no outs, A.J. Ellis flew out to the center field, with Andre Ethier tagging to score, Uribe tagging to third and Skip Schumaker tagging to second. Tampa first baseman (and former Dodger) James Loney cut off-center fielder Wil Myers&#x27; throw at the mound, flipped to shortstop Yunel Escobar, who flipped to third baseman Longoria standing several feet behind third base, out of Uribe&#x27;s line of sight. Longoria just stood behind the bar looking bored and kicking the dirt for several seconds before he got his chance. &quot;I was watching it, and I didn&#x27;t know what to do to stop it&quot;, said pitcher Zack Greinke, who was on deck. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to yell at Uribe, because I might get him off [the bag]. I didn&#x27;t know what to do. He just lifted his foot for a tenth of a second and Longoria was ready for it. As Uribe shifted his weight and took his foot off the third-base bag, Longoria sneaked from behind and slapped Uribe&#x27;s thigh with a tag. Longoria looked over his shoulder at umpire Angel Hernández, who called Uribe out for an 8-3-6-5 double play. In an after-the-game stunt from his teammates, Uribe was presented with a baseball shoe taped to a base.

On September 19, 2013, Colorado Rockies first baseman Todd Helton caught Matt Carpenter of the St. Louis Cardinals for the final out of the first inning in a day game at Coors Field. Helton, who days earlier had announced his retirement after 17 seasons with the Rockies, tagged Carpenter after faking a throwback to pitcher Roy Oswalt following a pickoff attempt. Carpenter was dusting his hands after a head-first slide when he stepped off the backside of the first base towards 1B umpire Bill Miller. Cardinal&#x27;s first base coach Chris Maloney was unable to help Carpenter before Helton got him with a poking tag. &quot;I&#x27;ve been wanting to do that for 17 seasons. Now I can cross that off my bucket list&quot;, said the 40-year-old Helton, who at the time was the oldest active professional athlete in Denver. The Rockies went on to win 7-6 in a 15 inning game that was the second-longest in Coors Field history.

In the minor leagues, on August 31, 1987, catcher Dave Bresnahan of the Williamsport Bills pulled an unusual hidden ball trick against the Reading Phillies in the Eastern League. With a runner on third base, Bresnahan switched catcher&#x27;s mitts and put on a glove in which he had secreted a peeled potato. When the pitch came in, Bresnahan fired the white potato down the third-base line, enticing the runner to sprint home. Bresnahan then tagged the runner with the baseball which he kept in his mitt. The umpire awarded the runner home plate for Bresnahan&#x27;s deception. Bresnahan was subsequently released from the Bills for the incident, but the fans of the Bills loved the play and the team eventually retired Bresnahan&#x27;s number.

==Goal-based sports==
In goal-based sports (e.g., American football and lacrosse), the offence deceives the defence about the location of the ball, in an attempt to get the defence running the wrong way.

===American football===
A hidden ball trick is considered a trick play in American football. There are various executions of such plays, including the Statue of Liberty play and Fumblerooski.

On November 9, 1895 John Heisman executed a hidden ball trick utilizing quarterback Reynolds Tichenor to get Auburn&#x27;s only touchdown in a 6 to 9 loss to Vanderbilt. During the play, the ball was snapped to a half-back who was able to slip it under the back of the quarterback&#x27;s jersey and who in turn was able to trot in for the touchdown. This was also the first game in the south decided by a field goal. Heisman later used the trick against Pop Warner&#x27;s Georgia team. Warner picked up the trick and later used it at Cornell against Penn State in 1897. He then used it in 1903 at Carlisle against Harvard and garnered national attention.

The hidden ball trick was famously parodied in the 1930s by the Marx Brothers in the film &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; and by the Three Stooges in the comedy short &quot;Three Little Pigskins&quot;, and was used in the final play of the football game in the 1970 film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

===Other goal-based sports===
Hidden ball tricks can be used in rugby and lacrosse.

<text>Vieux Fort is one of 10 districts of the Caribbean island country of Saint Lucia. Vieux Fort is also the name of the main town in the district. It is the home of the second-largest town in Saint Lucia and is the home of Saint Lucia&#x27;s international airport, Hewanorra International Airport (Hewanorra is the island&#x27;s old Amerindian name). 

==Geography==
It has several small communities which include Augier, Pierrot, Belle Vue, Black Bay, Grace, La Resource, Pierrot, St. Urban, La Tourney, Vige, and Zaboo.

==Economy==
Every Friday and Saturday is market day where you can buy local goods such as spices, ground provisions and fruits. It also houses St. Lucia&#x27;s biggest fish market, and you can go to the mall every day which sells fashion products.

==History==
Dutch sailors built a fort here, though the first fort in St. Lucia was built by the &quot;Oliphe Blossome&quot; settlers in 1605.

In the second half of the 18th century, Vieux Fort was the center of Saint Lucia&#x27;s sugar industry; today it is more industrial.

Part of Vieux Fort is called Black Bay. It got its name because legend has it that the infamous pirate Blackbeard used this part of the country to stash his ill-gotten gains.

During the Second World War, Vieux Fort became a base for American troops. Some of the evidence can still be seen around town, such as the tunnel that runs from Clark Street all the way to St. Judes Hospital in Augier. This tunnel was used for storage of supplies and also a quick route to the hospital. Many people who reside in Vieux-Fort today have no idea about such a tunnel.

In recent years a new modern part of Vieux Fort has been erected to reflect the modern world, yet if you walk along Clark Street and its surrounding roads, you will still see what is known as The Old Town. Here you will see historic colonial houses that give Vieux Fort a touch of Old England and France (albeit they do need a bit of renovation now). In recent times Black Bay has become a haven for expatriates.

==Government==

The Vieux Fort district is divided into two electoral constituencies represented in the House of Assembly. The electoral constituencies has been represented since July 2021 by Moses Jean Baptiste (Vieux Fort North) and Kenny Anthony (Vieux Fort South) as Parliamentary Representatives. The district elected their representatives during the countries recent general election.

==Tourism ==
Whilst the majority of tourist activity in Saint Lucia is based on the west coast, some hotels are located in Vieux Fort District. A notable tourist attraction is the Maria Islands Nature Reserve, managed by the Saint Lucia National Trust, which is a nesting ground for leatherback turtles and is home to a species of iguana indigenous to St. Lucia.

<doc id="898385" wikidata="Q443370" url="?curid=898385" title="Kaci Kullmann Five">
<text>Karin Cecilie &quot;Kaci&quot; Kullmann Five (; 13 April 1951 – 19 February 2017) was a Norwegian politician for the Conservative Party. She served as a member of parliament from 1981 to 1997, as Minister of Trade and Shipping in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1989 to 1990 and as leader of the Conservative Party from 1991 to 1994. After she left politics in 1997, she held roles in private business, ran her own consultancy and was a board member of Statoil and other companies and organisations.

She was elected by the Storting as a member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2003, became a board member of the Nobel Foundation in 2009 and served as chairwoman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 2015 until her death; in this capacity she was responsible for awarding the Nobel Peace Prize.

==Biography==
Five was born Karin Cecilie Kullmann in Bærum, the daughter of a dentist, and was better known by the nickname &quot;Kaci&quot; (). After finishing upper secondary school at Nadderud in 1969 she was educated in law, French language and political science, and graduated with the cand.polit. degree in political science at the University of Oslo in 1981. Before she entered politics she was a consultant at the Norwegian Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NHO). In 1972 she married Carsten O. Five, former editor of the finance magazine &quot;Dine Penger&quot;. They have two children.

In early 2014, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and began treatment for it. While her initial prognosis was good, the illness worsened, and in 2016 she had to cancel several appearances.

Five died on 19 February 2017 from breast cancer, aged 65.

==Political career==
Five was member of the municipal council of Bærum 1975–81 and then served as deputy leader of the executive committee for Education. From 1977 to 1979 she was the first female President of the Norwegian Young Conservatives.

She was a member of the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, from 1981 to 1997. She was Deputy Chairwoman of the Conservative Opposition 1986–1989, and again 1990–1991. From 1982 to 1988 she also served as Deputy Party Chairwoman. She served as Minister of Trade and Shipping in the Cabinet Syse from 1989 to 1990. In 1991 she was elected chairwoman of the Conservative Party, succeeding Jan P. Syse, but resigned after four years in 1994.

==After politics==
After leaving parliament in 1997, Five served as managing director in Aker RGI until 2001, and since 2002 remained active as an independent consultant. She was a member of the Board of Directors of several large companies and organisations, including Statoil, Norway&#x27;s largest petroleum company, Scheiblers Legacy, SOS Kinderdorf Norway and Radio Channel P4.

==Nobel Prize roles==
Kaci Kullmann Five was elected by the Storting as a deputy member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the Nobel Peace Prize, for the term 2000–03. In 2003, she was elected as one of the five regular members and was reelected up until her death in 2017. In March 2015, she was elected by the committee as its new chairperson, succeeding Thorbjørn Jagland, marking the first time in the history of the 1900 founded committee that the incumbent chairman was replaced without retiring deliberately. From 2009 until 2017, she was one of the seven regular board members of the Sweden-based Nobel Foundation, which has the overall responsibility for all the five Nobel Prizes.

As a member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, she was involved in the decisions to award the Nobel Peace Prize to, among others, Shirin Ebadi, Al Gore, Martti Ahtisaari, Barack Obama, Liu Xiaobo, Juan Manuel Santos, and the European Union. She praised Thorbjørn Jagland for his leadership of the Nobel committee and stated that she supported all the prizes awarded when Jagland was chairman. She harshly criticized the People&#x27;s Republic of China over its treatment of Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo; she demanded that the Chinese communist regime releases Liu Xiaobo and &quot;stops persecuting his wife.&quot;

<text>Haslingden is a town in Rossendale, Lancashire, England. It is north of Manchester. The name means &#x27;valley of the hazels&#x27; or &#x27;valley growing with hazels&#x27;. At the time of the 2011 census the town (including Helmshore) had a population of 15,969. The town is surrounded by high moorland; 370 m (1215 ft) to the north; 396 m (1300 ft) Cribden to the east; 418 m (1372 ft) Bull Hill to the south.

Haslingden is the birthplace of the industrialist John Cockerill (1790–1840) and the composer Alan Rawsthorne (1905–1971), and 
was the home for many years of the Irish Republican leader, Michael Davitt (1846–1906). Haslingden Cricket Club is a member of the Lancashire League.

==History==

There is some evidence of Bronze Age human presence in the area of Haslingden. Thirteen Stones Hill is west of the town and probably dates from about 3000BC. There is now just one stone visible.

Part of what is now Haslingden, along with the neighbouring towns of Rawtenstall and beyond that Bacup were part of the Forest of Rossendale, part of the Forest of Blackburnshire. The Forest was a hunting park during the late 13th and 14th centuries; &#x27;Forest&#x27; referred to it being parkland rather than being heavily wooded, as the forest declined much earlier, during the Neolithic period. The Forest of Rossendale contained eleven vaccaries (cow-pastures) and was poorly populated, with Haslingden being the only town of significance and with a church.

Haslingden appears to have held markets during the sixteenth century, with the first reference in a Court Roll of 1555 where it records a John Radcliffe being fined for being a &#x27;forestaller of the lords market of Haslyngden&#x27;. There are later references to markets and fairs in The Shuttleworth Accounts (1582-1621) and the map-maker Richard Blome writing in 1673 describes Haslingden as originally having &#x27;a small Market-town on Wednesdays&#x27;, and later, at the time of Charles I, the market had been moved to Saturday. The market continued to grow and Haslingden was designated a Market Town in 1676. It became a coaching station and a significant industrial borough during the Industrial Revolution. Haslingden benefited in particular with the mechanisation of the wool and cotton spinning and weaving industries from the 18th to the 19th centuries, and the development of watermills, and later steam power. By the latter half of the nineteenth century, the diversity and wealth of industry earned the area the name &#x27;The Golden Valley&#x27;. 
In the 20th century the population declined from 19,000 in the 1911 census to 15,000 in the 1971 census. The 2001 census recorded a population of 16,849 living in the town.

== Industrial ==

===Quarrying===
Haslingden is notable for its stone quarrying, and Haslingden Flag (a quartz-based sandstone) was distributed throughout the country in the 19th century with the opening up of the rail network. This stone was used in the paving of London, including Trafalgar Square. Flagstone is a type of sedimentary rock, relatively easy to split or quarry in slabs, and hence ideal for paving. Locally it is also used for making fences and roofing. Geologists have found that it has a hardness and silica content not unlike granite, and its presence was the main reason for the growth of quarrying in Rossendale. Haslingden Flag is unique; two other, common types of flagstone (&#x27;rough rocks&#x27;) are found throughout the Pennines, but a third type is found only in the local Haslingden Flags.

===Textiles===
Like much of East Lancashire, Haslingden has a long association with the textile industry. From the 16th century, after the old Forest of Rossendale was opened up to settlement, farmers raised sheep on the moorlands and made woollen cloth. Initially this was small-scale and local but towards the end of the 18th century cloth workers came together to work in small groups of houses. At the same time advances in technology meant that the first mills were appearing in the area. Most of these were small, water-powered buildings; and Haslingden, with its elevated situation, was not a natural place for the development of these early mills. Locally they were situated lower down in the river valleys, such as at nearby Helmshore.

The long association with wool meant that Haslingden and the other Rossendale towns had expertise with the processes of cloth production, and so were able to switch easily to cotton weaving. Cotton was better suited than wool to industrialised spinning as its fibres were less likely to break than wool. Cotton cloth manufacture quickly became a highly successful industry, and its development was closely associated with its role in the expansion of the slave trade. African slaves being bartered for cotton goods, and cotton being picked by slaves in the Deep South of the U.S. The growth of mills also had an enormous impact on the landscape, and on the lives of its work force. Cotton weaving in the new factories was largely unregulated, and the workforce kept almost at starvation levels. Hunger drove men and women to fight back, and mobs attacked the power-looms that were seen to be the cause of the decline in status of the workforce. In 1826 almost 3,000 people were reported as &#x27;attacking machinery&#x27; in Haslingden. A troop of cavalry was stationed in the vicinity, and ring-leaders were arrested. It was reported from Haslingden in the same year, 1826, that &#x27;a great majority of the unemployed must literally perish from extreme want&#x27;. By the 1850 steam power began to supersede water power, and mills grew in size. Grudgingly a minimum wage was introduced, and through the efforts of reformers, the churches and a few enlightened mill-owners, conditions for factory workers slowly improved. Conditions were still harsh, despite the whole Rossendale area being known as the &#x27;Golden Valley&#x27;. No longer dependent on the rivers as a source of energy, the mill owners were freed to build elsewhere, and Haslingden began to find that successful mills, such as Hargreaves Street Mill, could be built on its higher land.

The long decline of the cotton industry began in the early years of the 20th century. During the First World War, India and Japan were able to develop their own industries, and after the Second World War, immigration - mainly from Pakistan - was encouraged to help bolster a failing industry. But by the 1950s, mills were closing at an ever-faster rate. The old buildings often re-occupied by small businesses specialising in other occupations.

===The Cockerill family===
William Cockerill (1759-1832) and his son John Cockerill (1790-1840), along with other family members, both sons and daughters, are worth a footnote to the industrial history of Haslingden. Both were born in Haslingden, and as a young man William showed great skill as an inventor of machinery. The Slubbing Billy, a roving or slubbing machine, which twists and draws out yarn, is named after him. Slubbing Billy is also the name of a North West Morris Team. Father and son eventually left Haslingden and settled in Belgium, where they built up one of the largest industrial and machinery complexes in mainland Europe. It is said that they instituted the spread of the Industrial Revolution in continental Europe. See John Cockerill (company).

William&#x27;s beginning are obscure, although it is likely that he worked as a blacksmith in Haslingden before travelling to St. Petersburg, Sweden, and finally to Verviers, near Liège in Belgium. Here he set up spinning and carding machines with his sons Willam, Charles James, and John. John had also been born in Haslingden but moved to Vervier at the age of 12. He was eventually offered a Chateau in Seraing which then became the heart of Belgium&#x27;s iron, steel and machine-building industries. He is considered to be the founder of Belgian manufacturing and was known as a humanitarian employer.

===Immigration and community===

In the 19th century when the cotton industry was thriving, the town became a magnet for immigrants to Britain. In particular the port of Liverpool was a gateway for waves of immigrants, and many of these were attracted by work in the mills. From the late 1840s a large influx of Irish immigrants forced out of Ireland by the Great Famine of 1846–1852, came to Lancashire and some ended up in Haslingden. At almost the same time, as a result of the political instability in Italy, Italians came to Liverpool and Manchester and a few families moved on to Haslingden. Similarly, in the 1930s various eastern European refugees fleeing Nazi persecution settled in the area. Immediately after World War II young women from Germany were brought over to work in the mills, and a few came to Haslingden and stayed.

From 1950 onwards migrants were encouraged to travel from Commonwealth countries to work in the post-war textile industry. Initially this tended to mean young men who travelled from Pakistan, and later Bangladesh, fully expecting to return home after building up their savings. But by the 1970s, many were joined by wives and families and settled permanently in Haslingden. As a result, the town is now home to a substantial and vibrant community of people with a South Asian heritage, mainly Bangladeshi and Pakistani. Many of the families come from just a few villages: from the Attock and Mirpur areas of north-west Pakistan, and from Patli Union in the Sylhet region of Bangladesh.

The town now houses two mosques and a considerable number of Asian grocers and other shops. In the 2011 census almost 4% of the Rossendale population identify as Muslim, with the majority of these living in Haslingden. 

==Governance==
A civil parish was created in 1866 from the township of Haslingden in the ancient parish of Whalley. A local board was formed for the town in 1875 and the district it governed was extended to cover parts of the townships of Henheads, Higher and Lower Booths in the parish of Whalley, and Musbury and part of Tottington in the ancient parish of Bury. Subsequently, Haslingden was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1891 and in 1894 the civil parish was extended to match the borders of the borough. Following the local government reorganisation in 1974 Haslingden became part of the Borough of Rossendale.

In 2005 the Audit Commission rated Rossendale District Council performance as &#x27;poor&#x27;, and in the Commission&#x27;s Comprehensive Performance Assessment it was listed as the worst performing district council in the country. By 2009 Rossendale Council was described as &#x27;performing well&#x27; by the Audit Commission, with a rating of three out of four stars.

== Landmarks ==

===St James&#x27;s Church and the &#x27;Top of the Town&#x27;===
Haslingden&#x27;s Anglican parish church, dedicated to St James the Great, was rebuilt in 1780 on a site occupied by a church building since at least 1284. The church is locally known as the &#x27;Top Church&#x27; by reason of its dominating position. Murray&#x27;s 1955 Guide says &quot;it stands well and is plain Georgian, dully Gothicised inside&quot;. In 1296 a deed of gift of the Earl of Lincoln to the monks of Stanlaw granted them the parish of Whalley. Haslingden was recorded as being one of Whalley&#x27;s seven independent chapelries, and was served by two priests. 
St James&#x27;s Church is now located well to the north of the present town centre, but until the 1930s it stood adjacent to the area known as the &#x27;Top of the Town&#x27; - the area between Town Gate and Church Street, and the old centre of Haslingden. This location embraced several public house drinking places, along with the original market, the town stocks, and Marsden Square, where travelling shows pitched their tents. Clearance began in 1932 and the area is now largely occupied by recently built housing.

By the west side of the parish church entrance is a large plague stone, with two carved holes. There is some uncertainty about its exact purpose, but most opinion is that such stones were used in times of plague to enable food (or other alms) to be offered to plague victims while avoiding direct contact. A Saxon Cross is mentioned in the Clitheroe court rolls of 1547, and the plague stone may have been placed at the base of the cross, which would date the stone to the 16th century at the latest.

===Other churches===
Beside the Memorial Gardens, the Manchester Road Methodist Church is a classic building with an Italian-inspired interior. Murray&#x27;s Guide also mentions St Thomas, Helmshore (1851); St Stephen, Grane (1867); St John the Baptist, Stonefold (1885); St Peter, Laneside (1893) and the Roman Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception (1859) and &#x27;various other nonconformist churches&#x27;, largely built in the early 19th century.

St Stephen&#x27;s, Grane, has a particularly interesting history. Construction started in 1863 and finished four years later, designed by James Maxwell of Haslingden. The church was not consecrated until 1883. The construction of the Ogden Reservoir (which opened in 1912), however, led to almost total depopulation of the community of Grane. St Stephen&#x27;s remained in use, with most of the villagers having moved to Haslingden town. In 1925 they decided to move the church stone by stone to a new site, away at Three Lanes End, near Holden Cemetery. The church building is now a Holden Wood antiques centre and cafe.

===The Public Hall===
The Public Hall was opened in 1868 and built by a private company formed by &#x27;gentlemen representing the working classes and temperance movement&#x27;. It was bought by the town council in 1898 but by the 1990s it was largely unused except for occasional entertainments. The hall had been used for 50 or more years by Rossendale Amateur Operatic Society and other local community groups, but it was finally closed by Rossendale Council in 2005. The hall was sold by the council to a group representing the Asian heritage community and is now a mosque.

The hall was once a venue of Winston Churchill during his early political career. Emmeline Pankhurst once addressed the people of Haslingden from the stage and, after the Battle of the Somme in 1916, it was a temporary hospital for the survivors of the Accrington Pals who were sent home for treatment.

===Schools===
The Wesleyan School, formerly on the site of the current health centre, was the site of the first experiment in the world at a standardised intelligence test. It followed from a suggestion by the industrialist and Liberal politician Sir William Mather in 1900, given after a prize-giving to students to members of the Haslingden Technical Instruction Committee. The test was set by Henry Holman, a schools inspector and educationalist, in 1903. It included questions like &#x27;is there a good reason for making a pie crust ornamental instead of plan?&#x27;. Mather introduced apprentice schemes at his factories which used testing as part of the selection method. He also introduced a 48-hour working week for employees.

Haslingden High School is a specialist arts, maths and computing college. Haslingden Primary School was last inspected by Ofsted on 11 March 2014 and received a grading of &#x27;Good&#x27;.
===Library===
Originally Haslingden Mechanics&#x27; Institute and opened in 1860, it became the public library in 1905. A blue plaque commemorates Michael Davitt. The young Davitt migrated to Haslingden with his family in 1840 as a result of the family being evicted from their tenant farm by a British Landlord. He began working in a cotton mill but at the age of 11 his right arm was entangled in a cogwheel and mangled so badly it had to be amputated. When he recovered from his operation a local benefactor, John Dean, helped to give him an education. He also started night classes at the Mechanics&#x27; Institute and used its library. Michael Davitt&#x27;s family home from 1867 to 1870 on Wilkinson Street is now marked by a memorial plaque. Amongst the library&#x27;s collection is an early photograph (c. 1892) of Thomas Frederick Worrall labelled &quot;Tom Worrall, artist&quot;, whose watercolours included a depiction of the Old White Horse Inn (long demolished).

===Railway===
Haslingden was once connected to Accrington and Bury by railway (Rush, 1983). The East Lancashire Railway built a station here, which remained open to passengers under British Railways until 7 November 1960 and to goods until 2 November 1964. The withdrawal of the passenger service was therefore not a victim of Dr. Beeching. The Bury – Accrington line itself remained in use until December 1966. Much of the trackbed of the railway is no longer visible, with the A56 by-pass built over it between Grane Road and Blackburn Road, however, the line can still be traced through Helmshore towards Stubbins where several magnificent viaducts still remain. The East Lancashire Railway Preservation Society was originally established at Helmshore Station in the mid 1960s with the aim of reopening the railway line to Stubbins, the project was abandoned with the organisation relocating to Bury in the 1970s and eventually reopening the Rawtenstall to Bury line.

The nearest National Rail station is 4 miles away, in Accrington. A regular service from Rawtenstall to Manchester has been proposed, using the Heritage East Lancashire Railway terminus station.

===Other notable places===
The town centre is home to the famous Big Lamp originally erected in 1841 and from where all distances in Haslingden are measured, although the original lamp has been replaced by a replica, the original being lost after being taken to America. Cissy Green&#x27;s Bakery can be found on Deardengate. People visit from across Lancashire to sample the handmade pies which are still made to the original 1920s recipe. To the north of the town is the Holland&#x27;s Pies factory, and Winfield&#x27;s, a large warehouse-style retail development selling footwear and clothing, and promoting itself as a family day out. Haslingden&#x27;s War Memorial is unusual in that it has no names recorded on it. To the northeast there is a 2 kW digital television transmitter serving a wide area.

Chris Aspin writes of the haunting of Tor View, a house no longer standing that was situated behind the Rose &amp; Crown pub on Manchester Road. Young Emma Walton died in the 1840s after a tragic love affair. This story was reported in 1956 by Joseph Braddock in his book &quot;Haunted Houses&quot;, where the author claimed to have had first-hand experiences of the ghost.

===Beauty spots===

There is an extensive area of moorland to the west of Haslingden. These moors are divided into Oswaldtwistle Moor and Haslingden Moor. The area forms part of the West Pennine Moors. Plans were made in 2007 to build a wind farm consisting of twelve wind turbines on the moors. This attracted both support and opposition, but the plan was approved by councillors in 2010. Further developments have yet to take place, and the plan remains controversial.

The nearby Snighole (&quot;eel-hole&quot;) in Helmshore is a well-known beauty spot. The Grane Valley including three reservoirs to the west of the town is popular with walkers.

Victoria Park has a bowling green, children&#x27;s playground, skateboard park and ball court. The top of the park affords views of Musbury Hill.

===The Halo===
The Panopticons competition was launched in May 2003 by RIBA Competitions organised by Mid-Pennine Arts. The Halo artwork designed by John Kennedy was selected and opened in 2007 and is sited in the hills above Haslingden as the centrepiece of a reclaimed landscape. It glows at night with an impressive viewpoint.

<text>Helge Lund (born 16 October 1962) is a Norwegian businessman who has been chairman of BP since January 2019, and chairman of the Danish healthcare company Novo Nordisk since 2018. He is the former chief executive officer (CEO) of BG Group, Statoil and Aker Kværner, and was a director of Schlumberger from June 2016 to April 2018.

==Early life==
Lund was born in Oslo, Norway, in 1962. He graduated with a Master of Arts in business management at the Norwegian School of Economics in Bergen in 1987. He has a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the INSEAD business school in France.

==Career==
He started his career as a management consultant for McKinsey &amp; Company and as political adviser for the Conservative Party in the Norwegian parliament Stortinget, before starting work for Hafslund Nycomed in 1993. In 1997-8 he was vice president in Nycomed Pharma before starting work in Aker RGI in 1999 as vice president before becoming CEO for Aker Kværner in 2002. After Olav Fjell withdrew as CEO of Statoil in 2004, Lund took over and was retained after Statoil merged with the oil &amp; gas division of Norsk Hydro in 2007 to create StatoilHydro.

On 15 October 2014, Lund resigned as CEO for Statoil with immediate effect, to join the management team of the UK&#x27;s BG Group as CEO from 9 February 2015.

On 1 December 2014, in response to pressure from shareholders, BG Group reduced a £12 million share award golden hello for Lund to between £4.7 million to £10.6 million, depending on the company&#x27;s future performance. His basic salary will be £1.5 million, but with bonuses, total compensation could reach £14 million per annum.

Following the takeover of BG Group by Royal Dutch Shell, Lund was out of a job, but did receive a total of £5.5 million for his 11 months work, and £9.7 million in shares in February 2016, as a result of the takeover.

In June 2016, Lund was appointed to the board of directors of Schlumberger. On 26 April 2018, it was announced by BP that he would join their board on the 1 September 2018 and succeed Carl-Henric Svanberg as chairman with effect from 1 January 2019.

Analysts and share holders have become critical of Helge Lund’s oversight. Many believe that the board’s mismanagement of Looney&#x27;s appointment and its failure to anticipate challenges to its net-zero strategy have damaged BP&#x27;s credibility.

In September 2023, Lund participated in a celebration in Azerbaijan related to the centenary of the birth of Heydar Aliyev, a former KGB officer who established an authoritarian regime in Azerbaijan after its independence from the Soviet Union. A press release from BP said that Lund was there to &quot;pay tribute&quot; to Aliyev&#x27;s &quot;exceptional contributions to the development of Azerbaijan and the entire region.&quot; BP is the largest foreign investor in Azerbaijan.

==Personal life==
He is married to Else-Cathrine Lund. They have a daughter and a son.

<text>The Gnadenhutten massacre, also known as the Moravian massacre, was the killing of 96 pacifist Moravian Christian Indians (primarily Lenape and Mohican) by U.S. militiamen from Pennsylvania, under the command of David Williamson, on March 8, 1782, at the Moravian missionary village of Gnadenhutten, Ohio Country, during the American Revolutionary War.

Due to their commitment to Christian pacifism, the Moravians did not take sides during the American Revolutionary War, which caused them to be viewed with suspicion by both the British and the Americans. As the Moravians were collecting crops, Pennsylvania militia encountered them and falsely promised the Moravians that they would be &quot;relocated away from the warring parties.&quot; Once they were gathered together, however, the American militia rounded the unarmed Moravians up and said that they planned to execute them for being spies, charges that the Moravians rebutted.

The Moravians asked their captors to be allowed to pray and worship on the night before their execution; they spent the night before their death praying as well as singing Christian hymns and psalms. Eighteen of the U.S. militiamen were opposed to the killing of the pacifist Moravians, though they were outvoted by those who wanted to murder them; those who opposed the murder did not participate in the massacre and separated themselves from the killers. Before murdering them, the American soldiers &quot;dragged the women and girls out into the snow and systematically raped them.&quot; As they were being killed, the Moravians sang &quot;hymns and spoke words of encouragement and consolation one to another until they were all slain&quot;. Believing in nonresistance, they pleaded for their lives to be spared, but did not fight back against their persecutors.

Moravian missionary David Zeisberger declared the slain Lenape and Mahican as Christian martyrs, who are remembered in the Moravian Church. More than a century later, Theodore Roosevelt called the massacre &quot;a stain on frontier character that the lapse of time cannot wash away.&quot;

The shrine to the Moravian Christian Indian Martyrs includes a monument that was erected and dedicated ninety years after the Gnadenhutten massacre by a Chief of the Christian Munsee tribe; the graves of the victims contain &quot;bones [which] were gathered by the faithful missionaries some time after the massacre&quot;. It also includes a large Christian cross dedicated to the Moravian Munsee and Christian Mahican Martyrs by a member of the tribe and descendant of one of the slain. With the site of the village being preserved, a reconstructed mission house and cooper&#x27;s house were built there. The burial mound is marked and has been maintained on the site; the village site has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Background ==
During the American Revolutionary War, the Lenni Lenape bands (also called Delaware) of the Ohio Country, both Munsee- and Unami-speaking, were deeply divided over which side, if any, to take in the conflict. The Munsee were generally northern bands originating from around the Hudson River and upper Delaware River. The Unami were from the southern reaches of the Delaware.

Years earlier, many Lenape had migrated west to Ohio from their territory on the mid-Atlantic coast to try to escape colonial encroachment, as well as pressure from Iroquois tribes based around the Great Lakes and western New York to the north. They resettled in what is now Ohio, with bands in several villages around their main village of Coshocton. These villages were named Schoenbrunn, Gnadenhutten, and Salem, and were located on what was then called the Muskingum River. Modern geography places Coshocton on the Muskingum River and the three smaller villages on the Tuscarawas River.

By the time of the Revolutionary War, the Lenape villages lay between the opposing sides, which both had western frontier strongholds: The rebel American colonists&#x27; military had an outpost at Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), while the British with their Native American allies were based around Fort Detroit, Michigan.

Some Lenape decided to take up arms against the American colonials and moved to the northwest, closer to Fort Detroit, where they settled on the Scioto and Sandusky rivers. Those Lenape sympathetic to the Colonists remained at Coshocton, and their leaders, including White Eyes, signed the Treaty of Fort Pitt with the revolutionaries in 1778. Through this treaty, White Eyes intended to secure the Ohio Country as a state to be inhabited exclusively by Native Americans, as part of the new United States.

A third group of Lenape, many of them converted Christian Munsee and Unami, lived in several mission villages in Ohio led by David Zeisberger and other Moravian Christian missionaries. From the mid-Atlantic area, they spoke the Munsee and the Unami dialects of Delaware, an Algonquian language. These Christian Lenape, being Moravians, held to Christian pacifism.

White Eyes, a Lenape chief and Speaker of the Delaware Head Council, negotiated the treaty. When he died in 1778, reportedly of smallpox, the treaty had not yet been ratified by Congress. United States officials never pursued it, and the Native American state was dropped. Years later George Morgan, a colonial diplomat to the Lenape and Shawnee during the American Revolution, wrote to Congress that White Eyes had been murdered by American militia in Michigan.

Many Lenape at Coshocton eventually joined the war against the Americans, in part because of American raids against friendly Lenape bands. In response, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led an expedition out of Fort Pitt and destroyed Coshocton on April 19, 1781. Surviving residents fled to the north. Colonel Brodhead convinced the militia to leave the Lenape at the Moravian mission villages unmolested since they were peaceful and neutral.

Brodhead&#x27;s having to restrain the militia from attacking the Moravian villages was a reflection of the brutal nature of frontier warfare. Violence had escalated on both sides. Relations between regular Continental Army officers from the east (such as Brodhead) and western militia were frequently strained. The tensions were worsened by the American government&#x27;s policy of recruiting some Native American tribes as allies in the war. Western militiamen, many of whom had lost friends and family in Native American raids against settlers&#x27; encroachment, blamed all indigenous people for the acts of some and did not distinguish between friendly and hostile tribes or bands.

== Removal and massacre ==

In September 1781 British-allied Native Americans, primarily Wyandot and Lenape, forced the Christian Native Americans and missionaries from the Moravian villages. They took them northwest toward Lake Erie to a new village called Captive Town on the Sandusky River. The British took the Moravian Christian missionaries David Zeisberger and John Heckewelder under guard back to Fort Detroit, where they tried the two men on charges of treason: the British had suspected them of providing military intelligence to the American garrison at Fort Pitt. The missionaries were acquitted during the trial.

The Moravian Christian Indians at Captive Town were going hungry because of insufficient rations. In February 1782, more than 150 were allowed to return to their old Moravian villages (such as Gnadenhutten, Salem and Shoenbrunn) to harvest the crops and collect stored food they had been forced to leave behind. The frontier war was still raging. On March 4, 1782, the Pennsylvania raiding party of 160 Pennsylvania militiamen led by Lieutenant Colonel David Williamson marched toward the Tuscarawas Valley and on the morning of March 6, they first saw Joseph Schebosh Jr., a Moravian Christian who was the son of a Welsh man and Christian Munsee Indian woman; he was brutally murdered by the Pennsylvania militia despite the fact that he pleaded for his life before them. After pressing on to the corn fields, the Pennsylvania militiamen acted friendly with the Moravian Christian Indians to gain their trust. The Moravian Christian Lenape fed the American militiamen, who falsely promised them that they would take them to Fort Pitt, where they would be safe. The Indians were requested by the American soldiers to hand over their guns (which they used for hunting) and hatchets. Some militiamen went to the Moravian settlement of Salem, where they acted friendly to the Christian Indians and persuaded them to come to Gnadenhutten.

When they arrived, the American soldiers bound all of the Indians and accused them of taking part in raids into Pennsylvania. Even though the Moravian Indians, who held to the doctrine of Christian pacifism, disputed these false charges, the militia held a council and voted to kill them anyway (with the exception of the minority of eighteen militiamen). After the Indians were told of the American militia&#x27;s vote, they requested time to prepare for death and spent the night praying to God and singing hymns. They were held in two buildings: one for men and one for women and children. While the Indians were worshipping, the Pennsylvania militiamen spent the night getting intoxicated on the communion wine they stole from the believers.

The next morning on March 8, the militia brought the Christian Indians to one of two &quot;killing houses&quot;, one for men and the other for women and children. The American militia tied the Indians, stunned them with mallet blows to the head, and killed them with fatal scalping cuts. Refusing to take part, some of the militiamen &quot;wrung their hands—and calling God to witness that they were innocent of the blood of these harmless Christian Indians, they withdrew to some distance from the scene of the slaughter.&quot; One of those who opposed the killing of the Moravian Indians was Obadiah Holmes, Jr. He wrote: 
One Nathan Rollins &amp; brother [who] had had a father &amp; uncle killed took the lead in murdering the Indians, ...&amp; Nathan Rollins had tomahawked nineteen of the poor Moravians, &amp; after it was over he sat down &amp; cried, &amp; said it was no satisfaction for the loss of his father &amp; uncle after all. While waiting to be executed, the Indians sang hymns and prayed, with many praying for their murderers. One example of their nonresistance was described in these terms:
An account of the &quot;Moravian Martyrs&quot; recalled:
While the massacre was under way, a messenger sent by the Moravian missionaries in Sandusky on March 3 reached Schoenbrunn on March 6, with the news that the missionaries would be moving to Detroit. Two of the Moravian Indians from Schoenbrunn went to inform their brethren in Gnadenhutten but on their journey, saw the mangled body of Joseph Schebosh Jr. They buried his body and quickly returned to warn their brethren in Schoenbrunn as they thought that the others at Gnadenhutten had met the same fate. As a result, Moravian Christian Indians at Schoenbrunn were able to flee to Sandusky, escaping the militiamen who had planned to visit Schoenbrunn and commit another massacre.

In all, the militia murdered and scalped 28 men, 29 women, and 39 children. Two Indian boys, one of whom had been scalped, survived to tell of the massacre. The militia piled the bodies in the mission buildings and burned the village down. They also burned the other abandoned Moravian villages.

The militiamen had looted the villages prior to their burning. The plunder, which needed 80 horses to carry, included everything the people had held: furs for trade, pewter, tea sets, and clothing. A few years later, Moravian Christian missionary John Heckewelder collected the remains of the Christian Munsee and Christian Mahican Martyrs and buried them in a mound on the southern side of the village.

== Aftermath ==

Obadiah Holmes, Jr., a militiaman who had opposed the Gnadenhutten massacre, rescued one of the Lenape children, whom he raised himself.

The surviving Moravian Christians from Schoenbrunn, Gnadenhutten, and Salem etc. moved from Sandusky towards the Thames River (present-day London, Ontario). Outraged by the massacre, the U. S. Congress granted them three town sites in 1785. In 1798, David Zeisberger led many of the Moravian Christian Indians back to Ohio, where they established the Goshen Mission near Schoenbrunn; there, Zeisberger lived until he peacefully died after which many of the Indians moved back to Ontario (cf. Delaware Nation at Moraviantown) and others to Kansas, along with missionaries who continued to live and work among them. The descendants of both Jacob and Ester, the children of Israel Welapachtshechen (who was martyred during Gnadenhutten massacre), make up the majority of the Christian Munsee tribe in Kansas today.

Reliable accounts regarding the Gnadenhutten massacre come from the Moravian missionaries, as well as the two Moravian Indian boys who escaped—Jacob and Thomas, as well as those who survived such as the Moravian Indians at Schoenbrunn. Many of the soldiers who participated in the slaughter denied their involvement, and neither did their descendants acknowledge their actions. At the time of the massacre, although many settlers were outraged by it, frontier residents generally supported the militia&#x27;s actions. Despite talk of bringing the murderers to justice, no criminal charges were filed and the conflict continued unabated. However, as &quot;the details of the Gnadenhutten massacre [published by the Moravian missionaries] became generally known, it was recognized as a crime against humanity.&quot;

The Lenape allies of the British sought revenge for the Gnadenhutten massacre. When General George Washington heard about the massacre, he ordered American soldiers to avoid being captured alive, as he feared what the hostile Lenape would do to their captives.

Washington&#x27;s close friend William Crawford was captured while leading an expedition against Lenape at Upper Sandusky, Ohio. Crawford had not been at Gnadenhutten but was killed in retaliation. David Williamson, the officer who had led the Gnadenhutten massacre, was also a survivor of the Crawford expedition. In 1814, decades after the war, he died in poverty. The leader of the Home Guard at the time was Captain John Hay who on November 24 led an attack on the Delaware. Captain Charles Bilderback had participated in the Gnadenhutten massacre and was a survivor of the June 1782 Crawford expedition. Seven years later, in June 1789, he was captured and killed by hostile Lenape in Ohio.

In 1810 Shawnee chief Tecumseh reminded future President William Henry Harrison, &quot;You recall the time when the Jesus Indians of the Delawares lived near the Americans, and had confidence in their promises of friendship, and thought they were secure, yet the Americans murdered all the men, women, and children, even as they prayed to Jesus?&quot;

In 1889, future president Theodore Roosevelt called the atrocity &quot;a stain on frontier character that the lapse of time cannot wash away.&quot;

==Shrine and village site==
Dedicated by Gerard F. Heath (a member of the Moravian Christian Delaware tribe and the grandson of the man who erected the monument) in 2019, the shrine includes a large Christian cross and monument to the Moravian Christian Indian Martyrs. The granite obelisk was dedicated ninety years after the massacre by Christian Moses Stonefish, a chief of the Christian Munsee tribe that had migrated to Moraviantown; the graves of the victims contain &quot;bones [which] were gathered by the faithful missionaries some time after the massacre&quot;. These missionaries included John Heckewelder and David Peter, who buried the remains in 1799. The state reconstructed a typical mission house and cooper&#x27;s shop on the site of the village. The village site has been preserved and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Gerard F. Heath, a descendant of the Delaware Martyrs and the grandson of Christian Moses Stonefish, stated at the 2019 service held to remember them, that though the area is a site of mourning, it is also a place of &quot;honoring the Christian people who died on the site during the American Revolutionary War.&quot;

<text>RTMark (stylized as ®™ark) is an anti-consumerist activist collective, whose stated aim is to subvert the &quot;Corporate Shield&quot; that &quot;protects&quot; American corporations. The name is derived from &quot;Registered Trademark&quot;.

RTMark is itself a registered corporation which brings together activists who plan projects with donors who fund them. It thus operates outside the laws governing human individuals, and benefits from the much looser laws governing corporations.

RTMark claimed as its first prank the &quot;Barbie Liberation Organization&quot;, in which the voiceboxes of talking Barbie and G.I. Joe toys were swapped, and the toys then returned to the store (1993). The first prank documentable as being truly RTMark-sponsored was the SimCopter &quot;hack&quot; (1996), carried out by founding member Jacques Servin

Other RTMark stunts were &quot;gwbush.com&quot; (a faked campaign Website for George W. Bush). They were also involved in the toywar and they brokered a deal so James Baumgartner, the original inventor of &quot;voteauction&quot; could sell the raw project to UBERMORGEN in Austria.

The group&#x27;s website was part of the Whitney Biennial in 2000.

<text>Naftule Brandwein, or Naftuli Brandwine, (, 1884–1963) was an Austrian-born Jewish American Klezmer musician, clarinetist, bandleader and recording artist active from the 1910s to the 1940s. Along with Dave Tarras, he is considered to be among the top klezmer musicians of the twentieth century, and has a continuing influence on musicians in the genre a century later. Along with Tarras and other contemporaries like Israel J. Hochman, Max Leibowitz and Harry Kandel, he also helped forge the new American klezmer sound of the early twentieth century, which gradually gravitated towards a sophisticated big-band sound.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===

Brandwein was born on September 20, 1884, in Przemyslany, Austro-Hungarian Galicia (now Ukraine). He was born into a dynasty of klezmer musicians, part of the Stretiner Hasidic dynasty founded by Rabbi Yehuda Hirsch Brandwein of Stratin. His father Peysekhe (Paul) played violin, clarinet, and was an improvising wedding poet (Badchen); of his thirteen sons, Moyshe played violin, French horn, and valve trombone, Mendel played piano, Leyzer played drums, and Azriel played cornet; Azriel became Naftule&#x27;s first music teacher, and had a lasting impact on his playing. He married his wife Dora, and they had their first son Moses, shortly before emigrating to America.

Brandwein emigrated to the United States in April 1909 (although some sources say 1908), sailing from Hamburg to New York City. He was joining his brother Israel who was already living on Rivington Street in the Lower East Side; Naftule and his wife and son settled on nearby Pitt Street. He applied for US citizenship in 1912, adopting the Anglicized name Nathan Brandwein, although in his music career he continued to be known as Naftule. He finally became a naturalized US citizen in 1919.

=== Music career ===
Naftule was already a highly skilled clarinetist when he arrived in the US and used his skills of self-promotion to build himself a reputation as a klezmer and bandleader. However, unlike Abe Elenkrig, Max Leibowitz and other klezmers who recorded during World War I, Naftule does not seem to have recorded until around 1920, first playing as an uncredited soloist in Abe Schwartz&#x27;s band. It was in 1922 that he began recording under his own name at Columbia Records, making a handful of tracks of klezmer dances and virtuosic Doinas, as well as making some Ukrainian music discs under the label . In early 1923, he left Columbia, first making a handfulful of klezmer recordings at Emerson Records before settling in at Columbia&#x27;s rival label Victor Records. He stayed there for several years, making roughly two dozen recordings from 1923 to 1927, consisting mostly of virtuosic klezmer music put out under the label Naftule Brandwein Orchestra. In 1923, he was sued by the violinist Max Leibowitz for allegedly recording a tune he had copyrighted the year before. The case ended up being dismissed because Leibowitz had still been a Romanian citizen when he had copyrighted the work, which gave him less protection than an American citizen would have had.

His career declined from the mid-1920s onward, as demand for his traditional approach to klezmer music waned; his run of Victor Records sessions ended in 1927. From being the top musician in New York, he was reduced to playing in the Borscht Belt. He finally returned to the Victor Records studio in 1941, recording a handful of klezmer dance pieces under his own label once again. By the 1950s, he had difficulty getting many gigs, because of the changing expectations in the music scene; he could not read sheet music and was not as comfortable with popular American music as some of his contemporaries like Dave Tarras, and especially as compared to the younger generations such as Sam Musiker and Max Epstein. Nonetheless, he continued to work regularly until shortly before his death.

Brandwein died in October 2, 1963 at age 79. He was buried in the Mount Hebron Cemetery in Flushing in the Progressive Musical Benevolent Society section.
His yahrtzeit is 14 Tishrei.

== Style ==

Brandwein was known as much for his colorful personality as for his musical talent, sometimes playing with a neon sign around his neck reading &quot;Naftule Brandwein Orchestra,&quot; with his back facing the audience to conceal his fingering tricks, or even by pulling down his pants. He also wore plugged-in Christmas lights as part of his costume on several occasions, which once shorted out when he perspired too much, almost electrocuting him. His wild style incorporated the many strands of Eastern European Jewish music which was influenced by Greek, Turkish, Hungarian and Gypsy music. His warm and lively playing style would constantly jump up and down the scale and express itself in trills, slides and other ornamentation; he is often contrasted to the other famous klezmer clarinettist of his time, Dave Tarras, who had a different style of sound and phrasing. Brandwein took risks in his playing, often improvising a wildly different interpretation of a passage with each attempt.

== Legacy ==

While he did not live to witness the resurgence of interest in klezmer that began in the mid-1970s, his legacy has been revived by a new generation of klezmer musicians, who cite him as a key source of inspiration. Among the klezmer revivalists who have been strongly influenced by him are David Krakauer, Hankus Netsky, Alicia Svigals, and Michael Winograd. The intricate traditions of klezmer music are not well preserved in sheet music, and his recordings are one of the main sources people look to for the &quot;original&quot; klezmer style.

<text>José Julio Sarria (December 13, 1922 – August 19, 2013), also known as The Grand Mere,Absolute Empress I de San Francisco, andthe Widow Norton, was an American political activist from San Francisco, California, who, in 1961, became the first openly gay candidate for public office in the United States. He is also remembered for performing as a drag queen at the Black Cat Bar and as the founder of the Imperial Court System.

==Family history==
José Sarria was born in San Francisco, California, to Maria Dolores Maldonado and Julio Sarria. His family was of Spanish and Colombian origin. His mother Maria was born in Bogotá to an upper class and politically active family. During the events of the Thousand Days War and following her mother&#x27;s death, Maria sought out the protection of her mother&#x27;s friend, General Rafael Uribe Uribe, to escape Colombia. The general located Maria&#x27;s surviving uncle, who took her to the American consulate. There she was made a ward of the United States and relocated to Panama. &quot;My mother got to Panama with directions to the home of a family called Kopp. He was the chairman of the big German beer company there&quot;, said Sarria. &quot;She went to work for the Kopps. ... My mother was the upstairs maid and took care of the children.&quot; In 1919, she relocated to Guatemala City but remained there for just six months and, in 1920, sailed to San Francisco. As Sarria reported it, &quot;Now on the boat is where my mother met my father, Julio Sarria. He came from a large and very wealthy family, very well known. ... His grandparents came from Spain.&quot;

Maria initially worked for the woman who sponsored her passage to the United States and then took a job as a maid with a family named Jost. Julio was the maitre d&#x27; at the Palace Hotel. Julio courted Maria until she realized she was pregnant. Their son José was born on December 12. His birth certificate reads 1923 but Sarria believed he was born in 1922. Julio and Maria never married.

==Early life==
Sarria&#x27;s mother continued to work for the Jost family, but it became increasingly difficult for her to fulfill her job responsibilities and care for an infant. Maria made arrangements for him to be raised by another couple, Jesserina and Charles Millen. Jesserina had recently lost her youngest child to diphtheria and suffered severe depression. Her doctor suggested she take in another child to raise and, after meeting with her, Maria agreed to let her raise José. José came to consider the Millens and their children to be his second family. Maria bought a house and moved the Millens and José into it.

Sarria did not have a relationship with his birth father, a man who showed no interest in him and failed to provide his family with financial support. Julio Sarria was eventually arrested for failure to pay child support. A judge ordered that he pay $5 to be released; this money was then turned over for Jose&#x27;s care. Julio was arrested each month until he returned to Nicaragua in around 1926 or 1927; each time he paid the $5 and was released. Julio died in Nicaragua in 1945. Years later, José learned that his father had acknowledged him as his first-born.

Sarria attended the Emerson School for kindergarten and then, because he spoke only Spanish, was sent to private schools until learning English. Sarria began dressing in female clothes at an early age and his family indulged him, allowing him occasionally to go on family outings dressed as a girl. In his youth, he studied ballet, tap dance, and singing.

When Sarria was around ten years old, he asked his mother how much money they had in the bank. Maria, who gave her money to her employer Mr. Jost to invest, asked to see the books. She discovered that Jost had been embezzling from her and from the other women whom she had referred to him. Jost was arrested, convicted and deported. Maria sued Jost&#x27;s corporate partners and received a settlement but never recovered the bulk of the money. Unable to afford her house payments, Maria moved José and the Millen family to Redwood City in 1932.

As a teenager, Sarria enrolled in Commerce High School, where he took advanced classes in French and German. With his Spanish and English, these brought his total languages to four. His facility with languages led to his first serious relationship with another man. Sarria tutored Paul Kolish, an Austrian baron who fled to Switzerland when the Nazis invaded Austria. He brought with him his wife and son Jonathan, each of whom suffered from asthma and tuberculosis. When his wife died, he brought Jonathan to America. Kolish found himself falling in love with his tutor and Sarria&#x27;s family welcomed him and his son. Sarria graduated from high school and enrolled in college to study home economics.

==Military service==

Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Sarria became determined to join the military, despite being, at just under tall, too short to meet the Army&#x27;s height requirement. He seduced a major who was attached to the San Francisco recruiting station on the condition that the major approve Sarria&#x27;s enlistment. Jose Sarria was approved and entered the Army Reserve, continuing his studies as he waited to be called up to active duty. Shortly before he was scheduled for induction in the regular Army, his beloved second father, Charles Millen, died of a heart attack. Sarria&#x27;s induction was delayed a month, then he was sworn in and ordered to Sacramento, California, for basic training with the Signal Corps.

Because of his fluency in several languages, Sarria was assigned to Intelligence School. However, following a routine background check for security clearance, he was advised that he would no longer be in the program. Sarria assumed that it was because investigators discovered his homosexuality. &quot;I mean I had no lisp, but I wasn&#x27;t the most masculine guy in town ... So I think that they figured that I was a little bit gay.&quot; Sarria officially remained attached to the Signal Corps but was ordered to Cooks and Bakers School and trained as a cook. After graduating from cooking school, he was assigned to train as a scout, but deliberately failed the training because of the dangerous nature of the assignment. He was then assigned to the motor pool.

Through his work at the motor pool, Sarria met a young officer named Major Mataxis. He became the major&#x27;s orderly, eventually running an officers&#x27; mess in occupied Germany where he cooked for Mataxis and about ten other officers. He was discharged from the Army in 1947, at the rank of Staff Sergeant.

Upon Sarria&#x27;s return from overseas, Kolish began to worry about their future. The United States had no legal recognition for same-sex relationships and Kolish looked for a way to provide for Sarria after Kolish&#x27;s death. He proposed marriage to Sarria&#x27;s mother Maria. Maria was willing, but José refused to allow it. Given no other choice, Kolish contacted his only remaining adult relative, a brother who lived in Hollywood, and left instructions for the care of Sarria and his family.

On Christmas Day 1947, Kolish and his son were struck by a drunk driver while driving to spend the holiday with Sarria and his family. Both were killed. The coroner determined that Jonathan died first, meaning that Paul&#x27;s brother inherited everything. The brother ignored Paul&#x27;s wishes regarding Sarria. &quot;I would have gotten one of the houses&quot;, Sarria claimed, &quot;but he only gave me a little money and one ring. He claimed that was all Paul wanted me to have. He was so evil. He said afterwards, &#x27;If you expect anything else, you&#x27;re not going to get it.&#x27; &quot;

==The Nightingale of Montgomery Street==
Following his military service, Sarria returned to San Francisco. He enrolled in college with plans of becoming a teacher. He and his sister Teresa began frequenting the Black Cat Bar, a center of the city&#x27;s beat and bohemian scene. Sarria and Teresa both became smitten with a waiter named Jimmy Moore and bet as to which of them could get him into bed first. José won the bet and soon Moore and he were lovers. Sarria began covering for Moore when he was unable to work and soon Black Cat owner Sol Stoumen hired him as a cocktail waiter.

At around this time, Sarria was arrested for solicitation in a sting operation at the St. Francis Hotel. Sarria maintained his innocence, stating that the arresting officer knew him personally. &quot;But they had to make an example of somebody ... I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.&quot; Nonetheless, he was convicted and subjected to a large fine. Sarria, understanding that his conviction meant he could never become certified as a teacher, dropped out of college. Unsure of how to find work, he took the advice of a drag performer named Michelle and entered a drag contest at an Oakland bar called Pearl&#x27;s. Sarria took second place, winning a two-week performance contract at the bar at $50 a week. &quot;I decided then to be the most notorious impersonator or homosexual or fairy or whatever you wanted to call me–and you would pay me for it.&quot; Returning to San Francisco, he picked up some small singing jobs while still cocktail waiting at the Black Cat.

One night at the Black Cat, Sarria recognized the piano player&#x27;s rendition of Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot; and began singing arias from the opera while he delivered drinks. This quickly led to a schedule of three to four shows a night, along with a regular Sunday afternoon show. Sarria was billed as &quot;The Nightingale of Montgomery Street&quot;. Initially he focused on singing parodies of popular torch songs. Soon, however, Sarria was performing full-blown parodic operas in his natural high tenor. His specialty was a re-working of &quot;Carmen&quot; set in modern-day San Francisco. Sarria as Carmen would prowl through the popular cruising area Union Square. The audience cheered &quot;Carmen&quot; on as she dodged the vice squad and made her escape.

Sarria encouraged patrons to be as open and honest as possible. &quot;People were living double lives and I didn&#x27;t understand it. It was persecution. Why be ashamed of who you are?&quot; He exhorted the clientele, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with being gay–the crime is getting caught&quot;, and &quot;United we stand, divided they catch us one by one&quot;. At closing time he would call upon patrons to join hands and sing &quot;God Save Us Nelly Queens&quot; to the tune of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. Sometimes he would bring the crowd outside to sing the final verse to the men across the street in jail, who had been arrested in raids earlier in the night. Speaking of this ritual in the film &quot;Word is Out&quot;, gay journalist George Mendenhall said:

It sounds silly, but if you lived at that time and had the oppression coming down from the police department and from society, there was nowhere to turn ... and to be able to put your arms around other gay men and to be able to stand up and sing &#x27;God Save Us Nelly Queens&#x27; ... we were really not saying &#x27;God Save Us Nelly Queens.&#x27; We were saying &#x27;We have our rights, too.&#x27;

Sarria fought against police harassment, both of gays and of gay bars. Raids on gay bars were routine, with everyone inside the raided bar taken into custody and charged with such crimes as being &quot;inmates in a disorderly house&quot;. Although the charges were routinely dropped, the arrested patrons&#x27; names, addresses and workplaces were printed in the newspapers. When charges were not dropped, the arrested men usually quietly pleaded guilty. Sarria encouraged men to plead not guilty and demand a jury trial. Following Sarria&#x27;s advice, more and more gay men began demanding jury trials, so many that court dockets were overloaded and judges began expecting that prosecutors have actual evidence against the accused before going to trial. One favored harassment technique, employed especially on Halloween after midnight, was to arrest drag queens under an old city ordinance that made it illegal for a man to dress in women&#x27;s clothing with an &quot;intent to deceive&quot;. In consultation with attorney Melvin Belli, Sarria countered this tactic by distributing labels to his fellow drag queens (hand-made, in the shape of a black cat&#x27;s head) that read &quot;I am a boy&quot;. If confronted, the queen would simply display the tag to prove that there was no intent to deceive. Sarria&#x27;s actions helped bring an end to Halloween police raids. Along with Guy Strait, Sarria formed the League for Civil Education (LCE) in 1960 or 1961. The LCE, like other homophile organizations, ran educational programs on the topic of homosexuality and provided support for men being ostracized for being gay and for those caught in police raids.

==Political candidacy==

During an intensive period of police pressure after the 1959 San Francisco mayoral election, in which the supposed leniency of city government toward homosexuals became an issue, Sarria ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1961, becoming the first openly gay candidate for public office in the United States. Although Sarria never expected to win
he almost did win by default. On the last day for candidates to file petitions, city officials realized that there were fewer than five candidates running for the five open seats, which would have guaranteed Sarria a seat. By the end of the day, a total of 34 candidates had filed. LCE co-founder Strait began printing the &quot;LCE News&quot; in part to support Sarria&#x27;s candidacy. Sarria garnered some 6,000 votes in the citywide race, finishing ninth. This was not enough to win a seat but was enough to shock political pundits and set in motion the idea that a gay voting bloc could wield real power in city politics. &quot;[He] put the gay vote on the map&quot;, said Terence Kissack, former executive director of the GLBT Historical Society. &quot;He made it visible and showed there was a constituency.&quot; As Sarria put it, &quot;From that day on, nobody ran for anything in San Francisco without knocking on the door of the gay community.&quot;

In 1962, Sarria along with bar owners and employees formed the Tavern Guild, the country&#x27;s first gay business association. The Guild raised money for legal fees and bail for people arrested at gay bars and helped bar owners coordinate their response to the harassment by the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control and the police.

Sarria continued to perform and agitate at the Black Cat until, after some 15 years of unrelenting police pressure, the bar lost its liquor license in 1963. The Black Cat stayed open as a luncheonette for a few more months before finally closing for good in February 1964.

==José I, The Widow Norton==

With the demise of the Black Cat, Sarria helped found the Society for Individual Rights (SIR) in 1963. SIR grew out of a split between Sarria and Strait over the direction that LCE was heading. Strait and his supporters wanted to focus more on publishing the group&#x27;s newsletter, while Sarria and his backers wanted to maintain focus on street-level organizing. SIR sponsored both social and political functions, including bowling leagues, bridge clubs, voter registration drives and &quot;Candidates&#x27; Nights&quot; and published its own magazine, &quot;Vector&quot;. In association with the Tavern Guild, SIR printed and distributed &quot;Pocket Lawyers&quot;. These pocket-sized guides offered advice on what to do if arrested or harassed by police. SIR lasted for 17 years.

Crowned Queen of the Beaux Arts Ball in 1964 by the Tavern Guild, Sarria, stating that he was &quot;already a queen&quot;, proclaimed himself &quot;Her Royal Majesty, Empress of San Francisco, José I, The Widow Norton&quot;. Sarria devised the name &quot;Widow Norton&quot; as a reference to the much-celebrated citizen of 19th century San Francisco, Joshua Norton, who had declared himself Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico in 1859. Sarria organized elaborate annual pilgrimages to lay flowers on Norton&#x27;s grave in the Woodlawn Cemetery in Colma, California. He purchased a plot adjacent to Norton&#x27;s where he is now interred.

Sarria&#x27;s assumption of the title of Empress led to the establishment of the Imperial Court System, a network of non-profit charitable organizations throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico that raises money for various beneficiaries. Sarria is much revered within the hierarchy of the Imperial Court System and is affectionately and informally known as &quot;Mama&quot; or &quot;Mama José&quot; among Imperial Court members. The &quot;José Honors Awards&quot; are presented to Imperial Court dignitaries and others in a bi-annual banquet held in Sarria&#x27;s honor.

==Restaurateur==
In 1964, Sarria went into business with restaurateur Pierre Parker, who owned restaurants called &quot;Lucky Pierre&quot; in Carmel, California, and New York City. They met when Parker wandered into the Black Cat one night and they struck up a friendship. In addition to his restaurants, Parker held the French food concession for the World&#x27;s Fair. He invited Sarria to join him at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

While working at the Fair, Sarria learned that his longtime companion, Jimmy Moore, had died. Moore had been a frequent drinker throughout their relationship and had been arrested a number of times for public drunkenness. A judge finally told Moore that the next time he was arrested he would be given the maximum sentence. Moore was arrested again and, scared of a long prison term, hanged himself in jail. Although devastated, Sarria could not come home from the exposition. At the end of the season he returned and he and Moore&#x27;s father consoled each other. &quot;And so, that ended my big romance. The great love of my life. It carried on for nine years.&quot;

Sarria and Parker worked together through both seasons of the New York fair, Expo 67 in Montreal, HemisFair &#x27;68 in San Antonio, Texas and Expo &#x27;74 in Spokane, Washington, after which Sarria retired. He and Parker moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where Sarria lived until returning to San Francisco in 1977. He remained politically active, endorsing the candidacies of Harvey Milk for the Board of Supervisors. In 1977, Milk would win the board seat that Sarria had sought in 1961.

==Later life==
Sarria and members of the Imperial Court appeared along with other notable drag queens in the 1995 film &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot;. They played the judges of the &quot;Drag Queen of the Year Contest&quot; that opened the film.

In 2005, Sarria found himself at the center of a legal controversy over his role on the jury in the 1991 murder trial of Clifford Bolden. Bolden had been sentenced to death in 1991 for the 1986 murder of Henry Michael Pederson, whom Bolden allegedly picked up in a bar in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro district. Bolden&#x27;s attorneys claimed that Sarria, who was not on the jury that convicted Bolden but was seated as an alternate for the penalty phase, had known Bolden&#x27;s lover, Pederson and another of the jurors. They alleged that he had concealed this knowledge in order to remain on the jury and push for a death sentence. Sarria acknowledged having spoken occasionally with the other juror but denied the rest of the allegations. Sarria was cleared of wrongdoing in February 2008.

Sarria was honored in 2005 with the San Francisco LGBT Pride Celebration Committee&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Grand Marshal Award. On May 25, 2006, Sarria&#x27;s lifetime of activism was commemorated when the city of San Francisco renamed a section of 16th Street in the Castro to José Sarria Court. A plaque outlining Sarria&#x27;s accomplishments is embedded in the sidewalk in front of the Harvey Milk Memorial Branch of the San Francisco Public Library, which is located at 1 José Sarria Court.
In 2009, the California State Assembly honored Sarria during an official celebration of LGBT Pride Month on June 21.

Sarria reigned over the Imperial Court System until February 17, 2007, abdicating the throne in favor of his first heir apparent, Nicole Murray-Ramirez, who assumed the title Empress Nicole the Great, Queen Mother of the Americas. This abdication marked the end of a 42-year reign of pioneering political activism and unforgettable queer pageantry.
Sarria left San Francisco in 1996, settling in the Palm Springs, California, area for more than a decade before moving to Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, New Mexico, a suburb of Albuquerque. On granting Sarria its Lifetime Achievement Award in March 2012, Albuquerque Pride noted that he was living in Los Ranchos in &quot;a cute little casita and is enjoying his time raising chickens.&quot; The &quot;casita&quot; was the guest house adjacent to the home of Tony Ross and his husband PJ Sedillo (also known as Fontana DeVine, Imperial Dowager Empress VI of the United Court of the Sandias); Ross and Sedillo served as Sarria&#x27;s caregivers in the last three years of his life.

==Death==
Sarria died of adrenal cancer at the age of 89 or 90 on August 19, 2013, at his home in Los Ranchos de Albuquerque. Obituaries and tributes appeared around the United States in media including &quot;The Advocate&quot;, KALW Public Radio (San Francisco), &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. Media outside the United States that reported the death include &quot;Gay Star News&quot;, an online newspaper based in London; &#x27;, a monthly LGBT magazine in Warsaw, Poland; &#x27;, a regional LGBT radio program and online magazine based in Enschede, Netherlands; the website of RTVE, the Spanish national public television network; and &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;, a daily newspaper in Stockholm, Sweden.

Sarria&#x27;s imperial-drag-themed funeral was held on September 6, 2013, at Grace Cathedral of San Francisco, with the Right Rev. Marc Handley Andrus, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of California, presiding; some 1,000 mourners attended the service. Various local and state elected officials participated, including California State Sen. Mark Leno, former San Francisco mayor Art Agnos, San Francisco Treasurer José Cisneros, and members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Leaders of the Imperial Court System and the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence attended in full regalia, with the formal mourning dress for the court dictated by Sarria in advance. Other dignitaries at the funeral included Stuart Milk, nephew of politician Harvey Milk and head of the Harvey Milk Foundation.

Immediately following the funeral, a cortege of approximately 500 mourners accompanied Sarria&#x27;s body to Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Colma, where he was buried with full military honors in a plot he had previously purchased at the foot of the grave of Joshua Norton.

==Archives &amp; memorabilia==
Sarria documented his public and private activities throughout his life, amassing an extensive collection of archival materials and artifacts. He donated the majority of his papers and memorabilia, along with a sampling of his costumes, to the GLBT Historical Society, an archives and research center in San Francisco. An initial donation came in 1996 followed by another substantial body of material in 2012.

In addition, Sarria gave a small selection of costumes, accessories and documents to the Oakland Museum of California—including a cape and headdress that he wore in performances of his comic version of &quot;Aida&quot; at The Black Cat. An article published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 2011 asserted that Sarria had also donated materials to the Smithsonian Institution. This claim appears to be erroneous, as Sarria stated in 2012 that he declined the Smithsonian&#x27;s request.

In 2016, a group of individuals associated with various Imperial Courts created the José Sarria Foundation to further Sarria&#x27;s memory and legacy. One of the aims of the group is to gather and preserve a collection Sarria&#x27;s costume jewelry and other personal belongings that were auctioned by his estate. Established as a 501(c)3 public charity in the state of Washington, the organization outlines its mission as follows: &quot;The foundation is dedicated to keeping José Julio Sarria&#x27;s memory alive for future generations ... continuing his life&#x27;s work of philanthropy, balanced with a healthy dose of fun.&quot;

==Awards and Honors==

The San Francisco Pride Board created the José Julio Sarria History Makers award to honor LGBT people who make newsworthy accomplishments that were not going to get the recognition. It was created shortly before Sarria&#x27;s death.

Sarria is one of the LGBT historic figures honored on the Rainbow Honor Walk in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro District. A bronze plaque in Sarria&#x27;s memory was dedicated as part of the honor walk on Castro Street in November 2017.

On Wednesday, June 12, 2019, José Sarria was featured in the daily segment: &quot;Pride Month F.Y.I.&quot; on the television talk show &quot;The View&quot; during a Pride Month salute. A leading LGBTQ pioneer was featured every day during the month of June on the show.

In June 2019, Sarria was one of the inaugural fifty American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall&#x27;s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

In 2022, Sarria was honored with a star on the Walk of Stars in Palm Springs. His star is on Museum Way near a statue of Marilyn Monroe.

In 2023, Sarria was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.

==Fictional portrayals==
In 2017, Michael DeLorenzo portrayed Sarria in the miniseries about the history of the modern LGBTQ movement called &quot;When We Rise&quot;.

In 2020, Sarria was portrayed in the HBO docu-drama &quot;Equal&quot;.

<text>&quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; is a rock and roll standard written and first recorded by American singer, songwriter and guitarist Carl Perkins in 1955. It is considered one of the first rockabilly records, incorporating elements of blues, country and pop music of the time. Perkins&#x27; original version of the song appeared on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Best Selling Singles list for 16 weeks and spent two weeks at the number two position.

Elvis Presley recorded &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; in 1956 and it appears as the opening track of his eponymous debut album &quot;Elvis Presley&quot;. Presley performed his version of the song three different times on national television. It was also recorded by Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran, among many others.

==Background==

There are differing accounts about the origin of the song. In his second autobiography &quot;&quot;, Johnny Cash recalled planting the seed for the song in the fall of 1955, while Carl Perkins, Cash, Elvis Presley and other &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; acts toured throughout the South. Cash told Perkins of a black airman, C. V. White, whom he had met when serving in the military in Germany, who had referred to his military regulation airmen&#x27;s shoes as &quot;blue suede shoes&quot;, and insisted that no one step on or scuff them. Cash suggested that Perkins write a song about the shoes. Perkins replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know anything about shoes. How can I write a song about shoes?&quot;

In another version, Perkins played a dance on December 4, 1955, and noticed a couple dancing near the stage. Between songs, he heard the boy scold his partner, &quot;Uh-uh, don&#x27;t step on my suedes!&quot; Looking down, he saw that the boy was wearing blue suede shoes and one had a scuff mark. Perkins was amused to see that the boy cared more about his shoes than the pretty girl he was with, and began working on a song about the incident that night.

In either case, Perkins decided to use a nursery rhyme for the basis of the song, settling on &quot;One for the Money&quot;. Working with his Les Paul guitar, Perkins started with an A chord and improvised some lyrics: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s one for the money... Two for the show... Three to get ready... Now go, man, go!&quot; Satisfied, he scribbled the song onto some scrap paper, spelling the title as &quot;Blue Swade&quot; in his haste. According to Perkins, &quot;On December 17, 1955, I wrote &#x27;Blue Suede Shoes&#x27;. I recorded it on December 19&quot;, for Sun Records. Sun&#x27;s producer, Sam Phillips, convinced Perkins to change the lyric from &quot;go, boy, go&quot; in the first take of the song to &quot;go, cat, go&quot; in the second, which became the release version.

==Release and sales==

Perkins&#x27; recording of &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; was released in early 1956, as Sun 234. Two copies of the song on 78-rpm records were sent to Perkins but arrived broken. He soon discovered that the song was available in the newer 7-inch microgrooved 45-rpm format and was disappointed that he didn&#x27;t have a copy in the older, more substantial 78-rpm format.

In Cleveland, Ohio, disc jockey Bill Randle played &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; often on his nightly show, and before the end of the month, Phillips shipped an additional 25,000 copies to Cleveland. In Memphis and Jackson, where Perkins lived, the song&#x27;s B-side, &quot;Honey Don&#x27;t&quot;, was initially more popular on the radio, but was eventually overtaken by &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;. On February 11, &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; was the number two single on Memphis charts; by the following week it was number one, a position it held for the next three months. A &quot;Song Hits&quot; review of the song, published on February 18, stated that &quot;Perkins has come up with some wax here that has hit the national retail chart in almost record time. Interestingly enough, the disk has a measure of appeal for pop and r&amp;b customers.&quot;

Perkins made four appearances on the radio program &quot;Big D Jamboree&quot; on station KRLD (AM) in Dallas, where he played the song every Saturday night. He was also booked for a number of one-night performances throughout the Southwest. The &quot;Jamboree&quot; was broadcast from the Dallas Sportatorium, with about 4,000 seats, which sold out for each of Perkins&#x27; performances. Music shops in Dallas ordered a huge number of copies of the record, and at one point it was being shipped out at a rate of 20,000 copies per day.

On March 17, Perkins became the first country artist to reach the number three spot on the rhythm and blues charts. That night, Perkins and his band first performed &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; on television, on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; (coincidentally, Presley was on &quot;Stage Show&quot; on CBS-TV that same night, for which he also performed the song).

Perkins was booked to appear on &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; on NBC-TV on March 24, but on March 22 he and his band were involved in a serious automobile crash on the way to New York City, resulting in the death of a truck driver and the hospitalization of both Perkins and his brother. While Perkins recuperated from his injuries, &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; rose to number one on most pop, R&amp;B and country regional charts. &quot;I was a poor farm boy, and with &#x27;Shoes&#x27; I felt I had a chance but suddenly there I was in the hospital&quot;, Perkins recalled bitterly. It also held the number two position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and country charts. Presley&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; held the number one position on the pop and country charts, while &quot;Shoes&quot; did better than &quot;Heartbreak&quot; on the R&amp;B charts.

Perkins never attained the stardom of Presley, who, according to Perkins, &quot;had everything. He had the looks, the moves, the manager, and the talent. And he didn&#x27;t look like Mr. Ed, like a lot of us did, Elvis was hitting them with sideburns, flashy clothes, and no ring on the finger. I had three kids.&quot; After Presley hit the chart with his version of &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, Perkins became known more for his songwriting than for his performing.

By mid-April, more than one million copies of &quot;Shoes&quot; had been sold, earning Perkins a gold record. &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; was the first million-selling country song to cross over to both the rhythm and blues and pop charts. He became the first Sun Records performer to reach this milestone.

Sam Phillips retained the rights to &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, although it was represented by the New York house of Hill &amp; Range as part of the agreement when Phillips sold Presley&#x27;s contract. Perkins acquired the rights to the song, along with all of his other songs recorded for Sun Records, in 1977.

Paul McCartney and his company MPL Communications purchased the rights to &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; and other Perkins&#x27; songs in 2003.

==Elvis Presley rendition==
During the 1940s and 1950s, it was common to record and release cover versions of hit songs, often in different styles or genres. RCA Victor wanted to promote Elvis Presley as a rock-and-roll artist, and believed a Presley cover of &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; could outsell the Perkins/Sun Records version, especially with RCA&#x27;s larger share of distribution and radio contacts. Presley, who had been signed at Sun Records and knew Perkins and Phillips, was reluctant to record a competing version. He eventually agreed to record the song if the company would delay its release as a single. Presley&#x27;s version, recorded at RCA Victor Studios in New York City, features two guitar solos by lead guitarist Scotty Moore, with Bill Black on double bass and D.J. Fontana on drums.

According to Moore, when the song was recorded, &quot;We just went in there and started playing, just winged it. Just followed however Elvis felt.&quot; According to reports confirmed by Sam Phillips, RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes agreed not to release Presley&#x27;s version of the song as a single while Perkins&#x27; release was hot. Moore has said that Presley recorded the song to help out Perkins after his accident. &quot;Elvis wasn&#x27;t really thinking at that time that it was going to make money for Carl; he was doing it as more of a tribute type thing. Of course, Carl was glad he did. It really helped as his record started going down.&quot;

Presley performed the song on national television three times in 1956. The first was February 11 on &quot;Stage Show&quot;. He also performed it again on his third appearance on &quot;Stage Show&quot; on March 17, and again on the &quot;Milton Berle Show&quot; on April 3. On July 1, Steve Allen introduced Presley on &quot;The Steve Allen Show.&quot; Presley, dressed in formal evening wear, said, &quot;I think that I have on something tonight that&#x27;s not quite right for evening wear,&quot; and showed the audience his blue suede shoes.

&quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; was the opening track on the groundbreaking album &quot;Elvis Presley&quot;, which was released in March. RCA Victor released two other records with &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; the same month: an extended play with four songs (RCA Victor EPA 747) and a double extended play with eight songs (RCA Victor EPB 1254). RCA Victor released the Presley version as a single on September 8, one of a number of singles RCA issued simultaneously, all culled from the album &quot;Elvis Presley&quot;. This single reached number 20, whereas Perkins&#x27; version had topped the chart. In 1999, Presley&#x27;s version was certified as a gold record by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), while in 2023, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified the song silver for sales and streaming figures exceeding 200,000 units.

==Legacy==

&quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; was chosen by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. In 1986, Perkins&#x27; version was inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame and in 1999, National Public Radio included &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; in the &quot;NPR 100&quot;, in which NPR&#x27;s music editors sought to compile the 100 most important American musical works of the 20th century.

In 2004, Perkins&#x27;s version was ranked number 95 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.&quot; Presley&#x27;s recording of the song was also on the list, ranked number 423. The National Recording Preservation Board included the song in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2006. The board annually selects songs that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

As a rock-and-roll standard, &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; has been performed and recorded by many artists. In 1969, a live performance by John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band was included on &quot;Live Peace in Toronto 1969&quot;. An album review described it as one of the album&#x27;s &quot;blues-based oldies... they lay it down in a dignified, noisy, glorified garage band manner&quot;.

One of the characters in the 1993 &quot;ClayFighter&quot; video game is called Blue Suede Goo, which is a parody of &quot;Blue Suede Shoes.&quot; He is an Elvis impersonator with wildly exaggerated features, including a big gut and even bigger hair.

Marc Cohn&#x27;s 1991 song &quot;Walking In Memphis&quot; from his album &quot;Marc Cohn&quot; references the song in the first line, &quot;Put on my blue suede shoes and I boarded the plane&quot;. The song is also referenced in country music band Confederate Railroad&#x27;s 1992 single, &quot;Queen Of Memphis&quot; from their album &quot;Confederate Railroad&quot; in the chorus, which says, I saw stars dancin&#x27; on the water, I heard Elvis singin&#x27; &#x27;Blue Suede Shoes&#x27;&quot;.

The song is also referenced in George Jones&#x27; 1985 single, &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Fill Their Shoes&quot; from his album &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Fill Their Shoes&quot; in the second verse, &quot;God bless the boys from Memphis, &#x27;Blue Suede Shoes&#x27; and Elvis.&quot;

<doc id="898424" wikidata="Q1144146" url="?curid=898424" title="Japan Socialist Party">
<text>The was a major socialist and progressive political party in Japan which existed from 1945 to 1996. The party was the primary representative of the Japanese left and main opponent of the right-wing Liberal Democratic Party for most of its existence.

The JSP was founded in 1945 by members of pre-war proletarian parties, including the Shakai Taishūtō. In the 1947 election, the JSP became the largest party in the National Diet and formed a government under Tetsu Katayama until 1948. From 1951 to 1955, the JSP was split into the Left Socialist Party and the Right Socialist Party, and in 1960 some of its members broke away to form the rival Democratic Socialist Party. In 1955, Japan&#x27;s two major conservative parties merged to form the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has held power near-continuously since. The JSP was the largest opposition party for the next 40 years, but was incapable of forming a government. Nonetheless, it managed to hold about one third of the seats in the National Diet during this period, preventing the LDP from revising the Constitution of Japan.

Under the leadership of Takako Doi, the JSP achieved brief resurgence in the 1990 election before losing many of its seats in the 1993 election. In 1994, JSP leader Tomiichi Murayama became prime minister of a coalition government before the coalition collapsed in 1996. The JSP&#x27;s period in the government alienated many of its traditional supporters, and it was reconstituted in 1996 as the Social Democratic Party, which became a minor party. The Democratic Party of Japan replaced the JSP as the main opposition to the LDP.

==History==
===Foundation===
The two major left-wing political parties in Japan in the 1930s were the Labour-Farmer Masses Party and Social Democratic Party. They merged into the Shakai Taishūtō in 1932, and were the third-largest party in the after the 1937 election. It was dissolved in 1940 due to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association.

Suehiro Nishio started talking about creating a new socialist party with Chōzaburō Mizutani and Komakichi Matsuoka shortly after Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s surrender broadcast. Thirteen former members of the National Diet announced their intention to form a new party on 5 September 1945. This organization was officially formed on November 2. It was given the Japanese name &quot;Nihon Shakai-tō&quot; (Socialist Party of Japan), but given the official English name of Social Democratic Party of Japan.

An inaugural committee of 25 members was formed. The founding convention was chaired by Tetsu Katayama and Nishio was elected General Secretary. Nishio, Mizutani, and other inaugural committee members were appointed to the party&#x27;s executive committee.

===Katayama government===
The Japanese Communist Party (JCP), unbanned and its leaders freed from prison in October 1945, asked the JSP to form a common political front of Japan&#x27;s democratic parties. The JSP declined stating that neither had formally established their parties or policies yet. The JSP believed that the coalition would aid the party, but did not believe that the JSP was organized enough to maintain control over it. Morito Tatsuo proposed the creation of a Democratic League for National Salvation after the 1946 election so that the JSP could establish itself as the leader. The JSP&#x27;s Central Executive Committee voted to end negotiations with the JCP on 14 July 1946.

The JSP initially selected a limited amount of candidates for the 1946 elections. However, the party drastically increased its candidate amount after the Purge Directive, issued on 4 January 1946, greatly reduced the membership of right-wing parties. Conservatives attempted to form a government with right-wing members of the JSP, but the Liberal Party and JSP were unable to.

The JSP rejected an offer from the JCP to work together in the 1947 election. The JSP became the largest party in the election with 143 seats. It formed a coalition government under Katayama with the Democratic Party and the Citizens&#x27; Cooperation Party. Katayama was the first socialist to lead Japan. Katayama&#x27;s coalition fell in February 1948, in large part due to inexperience and subsequent poor performance in leading the government. A new cabinet was formed under the leadership of Hitoshi Ashida, a member of the Democrats. Ashida&#x27;s tenure was marked by labor disputes and he resigned after eight months due to a corruption scandal. A caretaker government was formed under the leadership of Shigeru Yoshida. Nishio, who was involved in the corruption scandal and arrested, was expelled from the JSP, but later readmitted into the right-wing JSP in 1952.

Members of Hisao Kuroda&#x27;s JSP faction in the Diet were expelled after voting against the budget during Ashida&#x27;s tenure. Kuroda and his supporters broke away and formed the Labourers and Farmers Party. The JSP attempted to delay the 1949 election as it feared massive losses. The JSP&#x27;s seat total fell from 148 to 48. The JSP rejected efforts by the Sanbetsu to form a united opposition of the JSP, JCP, and Labourers and Farmers against Yoshida&#x27;s government. JSP members who left to form the Labourers and Farmers Party were readmitted in 1957.

In the period immediately following the end of World War II, the JSP had played a key role in the drafting of the new Japanese constitution, adding progressive articles related to issues such as health, welfare and working conditions. Unfortunately for the JSP and the broader Japanese left in the immediate postwar era, their time in power coincided with a change in U.S. policy towards Japan commonly known as the Reverse Course. Beginning around 1947, and intensifying with the victory of the Communists over the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the U.S. occupation government headed by Douglas MacArthur felt the need to revise its previously conciliatory stance towards the kinds of policies pursued by Japanese leftists, from the breakup of Zaibatsu, the country&#x27;s business conglomerates, to land reform, to the ousting of nationalist figures in government. Apart from reversing early steps taken towards implementing these policies, the U.S. occupation government oversaw and assisted in the purging of almost 30,000 workers deemed to be &quot;red&quot; between 1948 and 1950, frustrating leftist attempts to hold on to state power.

===Fracture and reunification===
The party&#x27;s 1949 convention was postponed until after the year&#x27;s election. The party leadership, including multiple members of the Central Executive Committee, resigned following the party&#x27;s defeat. The party&#x27;s right-wing wanted to rename the organization to the Social Democratic Party while the left-wing wanted to retain its name, which was approved. The left-wing wanted the entire right-wing leadership to resign, Katayama retained as chairman, and Mosaburō Suzuki appointed as Secretary General. Inejirō Asanuma was the right-wing candidate for Secretary General. Asanuma defeated Suzuki in the nominating committee&#x27;s vote with 31 to 30, but lost the convention vote 390 to 261. Katayama was reelected as chairman.

By the time of the 1950 convention the party&#x27;s factions formed two youth leagues. The left-wing controlled the official Youth Department while the right-wing formed the Independent Youth League. The Youth Department, which held its convention before the party&#x27;s, demanded the expulsion of all members of the Independent Youth League and prepared a motion of no confidence against Katayama. The left-wing held greater control over the convention than in the previous year, holding almost all of the committee chairmanships. Katayama declined to run for reelection and the right-wing walked out of the convention.

Members of the Diet who were not aligned with either faction formed the Unification Discussion Group. The two factions held separate conventions, but worked together in the Diet due to spring labor disputes and threats from the National Railway Workers&#x27; Union to pull its support for the party. The three groups reunited on 3 April, after three months of negation. The position of chairman was left vacant, but Asanuma was made Secretary General. The Central Executive Committee was divided between fifteen left-wingers, nine right-wingers, and six centrists.

In the 1950 elections the JSP won the governorship of Kyoto Prefecture and became the second-largest party in the House of Councillors while the JCP declined in strength. The party&#x27;s factions were heavily divided over the Treaty of San Francisco and Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan. The party&#x27;s convention was held on 23 October 1951, and divided into the Right Socialist Party of Japan and Left Socialist Party of Japan after seventeen hours. In the Diet the left-wing voted against both treaties while the right-wing opposed the peace treaty and supported the security treaty. The party remained united at the prefecture level until the final prefecture division in 1953.

The Left Socialists selected Suzuki as chairman and Masaru Nomizo as Secretary General while the Right Socialists selected Asanuma as Secretary General and left the position of chairman vacant. At the time of the schism the JSP&#x27;s House of Representatives membership was divided into 30 Right Socialists and 16 Left Socialists. Their seat totals rose to 57 for the Right Socialists and 54 for the Left Socialists after the 1952 election. Despite this divided membership the two groups worked together in the Diet with Kaishintō and disaffected Liberals to pass motions of no confidence against Minister of Finance Hayato Ikeda.

In 1953, Yoshida lost a vote of no confidence to the socialists and conservatives after disaffected Liberals abstained and new elections were called. The Left Socialists overtook the Right Socialists in seat count in the general election. In the House of Councillors election the Left Socialists rose from 30 to 41 seats while the Right Socialists declined from 30 to 26 seats. The Right Socialists attempted to form a coalition with the Left Socialists, Kaishintō, and disaffected Liberals. This failed as Minoru Takano failed to convince the Left Socialists, who wanted Suzuki as prime minister, to accept Mamoru Shigemitsu, the Kaishintō leader, as prime minister. Yoshida became prime minister again after two ballots and Kaishintō announced that it would end its partnership with the socialists.

Yoshida lost a motion of no confidence supported by the Japan Democratic Party and Socialists on 7 December 1954. Ichirō Hatoyama replaced him and new elections were called. The Left and Right Socialists, faced with Hatoyama&#x27;s popularity, adopted the same platform. The two groups held conventions on 18 January 1955, in which they called to reunify after the election. The combined Socialist seat total, 156, was greater than their seat total during Katayama&#x27;s government. Unification negotiation committees met in April and the platform it created was accepted by a united convention on 13 October. Suzuki was appointed as chairman and Asanuma as Secretary General. The Central Executive Committee and Control Commission was divided equally between the two factions. The left-wing gained a 22 to 18 seat majority on the Central Executive Committee at the 1957 convention.

The JSP made minor gains in the 1958 general election and 1959 House of Councillors election. It performed poorly in the 1959 gubernatorial election, including the loss of the governorship of Hokkaido. The JSP was harmed as the JCP, which had strategically withdrawn its candidates in other elections, declined to do so in the 1958 and 1959 elections.

===Divisions and Asanuma&#x27;s assassination===

The party split again in 1960 because of internal disagreement over how to conduct the ongoing Anpo protests against revision of the security treaty and whether or not to cooperate with the JCP in doing so. Left-wingers from Sōhyō and the Youth Division, with backing from supporters of Hiroo Wada and Jiichirō Matsumoto, had attempted to expel Nishio at the 1959 convention, but it failed in the Steering Committee. Nishio attacked the left-wing for serving Sōhyō. The Association for Party Reconstruction, which called for &quot;democratic socialism&quot; that received support from &quot;the whole nation, not merely the labor unions and farmers&#x27; organizations&quot;, held a convention attended by 300 right-wing leaders and 28 Diet members. The Socialist Club, under the leadership of Nishio, had 12 members in the House of Councillors and 21 in the House of Representatives. This organization broke away to form the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) on 24 January 1960.

Asanuma was elected chairman of the JSP at the 1960 convention. Asanuma was assassinated by a right-wing youth, Otoya Yamaguchi, during a televised election debate on 12 October 1960. Asanuma had been a charismatic figure who had been able to hold the antagonistic left and right factions of the party together through the force of his personality. Asanuma&#x27;s untimely death deprived the party of his adroit leadership, and thrust Saburō Eda into the leadership role instead. Eda was hastily named &quot;Acting Chairman&quot; of the JSP and became the party&#x27;s leader and candidate to become prime minister of Japan should the party triumph in the election. A centrist, Eda rapidly took the party in a more centrist direction, far faster than the left socialists were ready to accept. This led to growing infighting within the party, and drastically damaged its ability to present a cohesive message to the public.

In particular, Eda earned the enmity of the party&#x27;s left-wing due to his ambitious platform of and his related &quot;Eda Vision&quot; of socialism. The &quot;structural reform&quot; platform drew inspiration from the recently concluded Anpo protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which had achieved massive size and forced the resignation of conservative prime minister Nobusuke Kishi. Eda and his allies viewed these protests as having been an unalloyed success in having allowed the JSP to play a leading role in fomenting a mass movement. Eda&#x27;s &quot;structural reform&quot; platform called for a combination of parliamentary pressure tactics and Anpo-style extra-parliamentary mass movements that would gradually move Japan toward socialism by forcing the government into a series of piecemeal concessions. Above all, Eda and his fellow structural reformers hoped to broaden the base of the JSP beyond a hard core of labor unionists, leftist student activists, and Marxist intellectuals to encompass people from many walks of life, in order to dramatically increase the party&#x27;s potential supporters at the polls.

In an effort to build popular support for his reform program, Eda announced his &quot;New Vision of Socialism&quot;, better known by its nickname, the &quot;Eda Vision&quot;, in July 1962. Eda declared that &quot;[s]ocialism must be defined in sunny and cheerful terms that are easily understandable to the masses. I believe that &#x27;socialism&#x27; is that which allows human potential to blossom to its fullest extent. The main four accomplishments that humankind has achieved so far are America&#x27;s high standard of living, the Soviet Union&#x27;s thoroughgoing social welfare system, England&#x27;s parliamentary democracy, and Japan&#x27;s peace constitution. I believe that if we can integrate these, we can give birth to a broad-based socialism.&quot;

The &quot;Eda Vision&quot; of a more moderate form of socialism was received enthusiastically in the mainstream Japanese press, and polled well in public opinion polls. However, it did not lead to any significant expansion of party membership; in 1961, the JSP made a push to increase its membership to over 100,000 within the next three years, but only 363 members were added over the next six months. Moreover, the &quot;Eda Vision&quot; was the final straw for the more orthodox Marxist left-wing factions in the JSP, who had already chafed against the moderate tone of Eda&#x27;s &quot;structural reform&quot; platform. In particular, they could not accept praise of what they viewed as the &quot;imperialist&quot; United States and Great Britain, and the &quot;deviationist&quot; and &quot;Stalinist&quot; Soviet Union. At the 22nd Party Congress in November 1962, the left-wing of the JSP revolted, and succeeded in persuading a majority of party members present to adopt an &quot;Eda Vision Criticism Resolution&quot; that renounced the &quot;Eda Vision&quot; as antithetical to core party principles. Eda was forced to resign his position as Secretary General, and thereafter the party returned to a more dogmatically Marxist platform which emphasized the urban working classes as the party&#x27;s main political base.

Thereafter, a younger generation of reform-minded activists became disillusioned and began to drift away from the party. At the same time, the emergence of the &quot;Clean Government Party&quot; (&quot;Kōmeitō&quot;), the political wing of the Sokka Gakkai Buddhist religious movement, and the increasing electoral success of the Japan Communist Party, began to eat away at the JSP&#x27;s urban working class base. The Socialists slipped in the polls in the 1967 election, lost more ground in the 1968 Upper House election, and suffered a crushing repudiation in 1969, when they lost 51 seats in the National Diet.

===1970s===
In some regions, the party continued to perform well at the local level and by the 1970s many areas were run by JSP (or JSP-backed) mayors and governors, who supported environmental protection initiatives and introduced new social welfare programs.

Meanwhile, Saburō Eda continued his efforts to reform the party and expand its base. Eda ran numerous times for the post of party chairman, but was unsuccessful, although he did serve a second stint as Secretary General from 1968 to 1970. Nevertheless, Eda remained popular among the broader Japanese public and in the mid-1970s conservative prime minister Kakuei Tanaka said at a press conference, &quot;If the Japan Socialist Party were ever to make Eda its Chairman again, a general election would be terrifying. They would drastically expand their seats in the Diet.&quot; Eda could never overcome the undying animosity his &quot;Eda Vision&quot; had won him from his party&#x27;s left-wing.

In 1976, Eda lost his reelection bid and was booted from the Diet. Blaming his loss on his party&#x27;s dogmatic, doctrinaire Marxism and desperate for reform, he attempted to resign from the JSP but the party refused to accept his resignation and voted to expel him instead. The following year, Eda and Hideo Den () led a small group of JSP Dietmembers to split from the JSP and form a new party called the Socialist Democratic Federation ().

===1980s===
In July 1986, under party chairman Masashi Ishibashi, the JSP suffered a disastrous double defeat in both houses of the National Diet in the simultaneously held 1986 Japanese general election and 1986 Japanese House of Councillors election. Losing in a rout to the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) under popular prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, the JSP&#x27;s seats in the lower house fell from 112 to a new all-time low of 85 and its share of the popular vote dropped from 19.5 percent to 17.2 percent. This defeat led the party to elect Takako Doi as party chair, making her the first woman to ever lead a Japanese political party. Doi was popular with the Japanese public led the JSP to an electoral comeback with an impressive showing in the 1990 Japanese general election, winning 136 seats and 24.4 percent of the vote. Some electoral districts had more than one successful socialist candidate. Doi&#x27;s decision to put up more than one candidate for each of the 130 districts represented a controversial break with the past because unlike their LDP counterparts many party candidates did not want to run against each other; however, the great majority of the 149 socialist candidates who ran were successful, including seven of eight women.

Doi, a university professor of constitutional law before entering politics, had a tough, straight-talking manner that appealed to voters tired of the evasiveness of other politicians. Many women found her a refreshing alternative to submissive female stereotypes and in the late 1980s the public at large in opinion polls voted her their favorite politician (the runner-up in these surveys was equally tough-talking conservative LDP member Shintarō Ishihara); however, Doi&#x27;s popularity was of limited aid to the party, as the powerful Shakaishugi Kyokai (Japan Socialist Association), which was supported by a contingent of the party&#x27;s 76,000-strong membership, remained committed to orthodox Marxism, impeding Doi&#x27;s efforts to promote what she called &quot;perestroika&quot; and a more moderate program with greater voter appeal.

In 1983, Doi&#x27;s predecessor as chairman Masashi Ishibashi had begun the delicate process of moving the party away from its strong opposition to the Self-Defense Forces. While maintaining that these forces were unconstitutional in light of Article 9, he claimed that because they had been established through legal procedures, they had a legitimate status (this phrasing was changed a year later to say that the Self-Defense Forces exist legally). Ishibashi also broke past precedent by visiting Washington to talk with United States political leaders. By the end of the decade, the party had accepted the Self-Defense Forces and the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. It advocated strict limitations on military spending (no more than 1 percent of GNP annually), a suspension of joint military exercises with United States forces, and a reaffirmation of the three non-nuclear principles (no production, possession, or introduction of nuclear weapons into Japanese territory).

Doi expressed support for balanced ties with the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). In the past, the party had favored the Kim Il Sung regime in Pyongyang and in the early 1990s it still refused to recognize the normalization of relations between Tokyo and Seoul with Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea (1965). In domestic policy, the party demanded the continued protection of agriculture and small business in the face of foreign pressure, abolition of the consumption tax and an end to the construction and use of nuclear power reactors. As a symbolic gesture to reflect its new moderation, the party dropped its commitment to socialist revolution at its April 1990 convention and described its goal as social democracy, the creation of a society in which &quot;all people fairly enjoy the fruits of technological advancement and modern civilization and receive the benefits of social welfare.&quot; Delegates also elected Doi to a third term as party chairwoman.

Because of the party&#x27;s self-definition as a class-based party and its symbiotic relationship with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (), the public-sector workers&#x27; confederation, few efforts were made to attract non-union constituencies. Although some unions supported the Japanese Communist Party, the party remained the representative of Sohyo&#x27;s political interests until the merger with private-sector unions and the Japanese Trade Union Confederation () in 1989. Because of declining union financial support during the 1980s, some party Diet members turned to dubious fund-raising methods. One was involved in the Recruit affair. Like other parties, it sold large blocks of fund-raising party tickets and the LDP even gave individual party Diet members funds from time to time to persuade them to cooperate in passing difficult legislation.

=== 1990s ===

As part of the fallout of the Recruit Scandal, the party secured a mere 70 seats (down from 137) in the 1993 Japanese general election while the LDP lost its majority in the lower house for the first time since the 1983 Japanese general election and was out of government for the first time in 38 years. The anti-LDP coalition government of Morihiro Hosokawa was formed by reformists who had triggered the 1993 election by leaving the LDP (Japan Renewal Party and New Party Sakigake), a liberal party formed only a year before (Japan New Party), the traditional centre-left opposition (Kōmeitō, Democratic Socialist Party and Socialist Democratic Federation) and the Democratic Reform Party, the political arm of the trade union federation, together with the JSP. In 1994, the JSP and the New Sakigake Party decided to leave the non-LDP coalition. The minority Hata cabinet lasted only a few weeks.

The JSP then formed a grand coalition (&quot;dai-renritsu&quot;) government with the LDP and the New Party Sakigake under JSP Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, who was leader of the party from 1993 to 1996. Most of the other parties from the anti-LDP coalition, now forced back into opposition, united to form the New Frontier Party (NFP), which overtook the JSP as second largest political party in Japan. The JSP suffered a defeat in the 1995 Japanese House of Councillors election. In January 1996, the New Socialist Party of Japan split off from the JSP, Murayama resigned as Prime Minister, and the JSP changed its name from the JSP to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as an interim party for forming a new party.

==Factions and membership==
Nomizo and his faction were affiliated with agricultural workers and unions. Their power in the JSP waned after land reforms in the 1950s. Matsumoto and his faction found support among the Burakumin, whose rights Matsumoto advocated for. The JSP consistently received around 10-20% of the female vote. In 1957, women were estimated to account for 10% of the JSP&#x27;s membership and the party had eleven female members in the Diet.

===Agriculture===
The Japan Farmers&#x27; Union was officially not aligned with any party, but its leadership were members of the JSP. Five the union&#x27;s seven executive members were elected to the Diet, including Kuroda and Nomizo. Rikizō Hirano, the Minister of Agriculture and aligned with the JSP&#x27;s right-wing, led 15% of the union to break away into League for Revivifying the Japan Farmers&#x27; Union (later renamed to the All-Japan Farmers&#x27; Union) after continued disputes with the left-wing and communists at the union&#x27;s 1947 convention. 31 of the 143 seats won by the JSP in the 1947 election were held by officers of the Japan Farmers&#x27; Union and an additional 8 were held by members of Hirano&#x27;s union. Nomizo attempted to become Minister of Agriculture after Hirano&#x27;s dismissal, but the right-wing successfully opposed him.

In the face of rising communist influence in the union JSP members formed the League for the Establishment of Independence in 1948, while Kuroda and the communists formed the Unity Discussion Group. The union broke apart into the Independence Group and Unity Group as these two groups held separate conventions on 22 April 1949.

New agrarian groups were formed after the JSP broke apart into the Left and Right parties. The Independence Group was aligned with the Left JSP. The Right JSP had the New Village Construction Group of the Japan Farmers&#x27; Union, but it never held a convention during its existence and was poorly organized. The All-Japan Famers&#x27; Union federated with this organization and formed the General Federation of Farmers&#x27; Union after Hirano joined the Right JSP. A sample of 48 Left JSP and 33 Right JSP candidates in 1955 showed that 31 Left JSP candidates had farmer union support compared to 7 Right JSP candidates. The All-Japan Farmers&#x27; Union, New Village Construction Group, a rump faction of the Independence Group unified into the National Japan Farmers&#x27; Union in 1958. Another schism occurred as supporters of Nishio left to form the All-Japan Farmers&#x27; Federation aligned with the DSP.

===Labor===
Sōhyō, the largest labor federation in Japan, was aligned with the JSP&#x27;s left-wing while the National Railway Workers&#x27; Union was aligned with the right-wing. The Red Purge resulted in the amount of unions falling by 5,500 and union membership falling by 880,000 in 1949 alone. Sōhyō&#x27;s membership fell to below 47,000 in this period, but grew to 3.7 million by 1962. Sōhyō had three major factions during the JSP&#x27;s split in the 1950s. The left-wing Worker Comrades Society had ties to the Suzuki and Wada factions, a communist faction under Minoru Takano&#x27;s leadership, and right-wing Democratic Labor Movement Study Group. The Democratic Labor Movement Study Group broke away to form the All-Japan Trade Union Congress in April 1954. 26 representatives and 38 councilors were affiliated with Sōhyō after the 1956 election.

Polling by &quot;The Asahi Shimbun&quot; in October 1948, showed that 40% of unionized workers supported the JSP, but 18% of non-unionized workers supported them. These figures was 39% and 28% respectively in 1949, and 37% and 26% in 1950.

==Ideology==

===Domestic===
The JSP is generally regarded as having been a progressive &quot;left-wing&quot; party that opposed the conservative &quot;right-wing&quot; Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The JSP is also considered a centre-left party, but there was a far-left faction within the party. The so-called &quot;leftists&quot; in the JSP were Marxists in favour of scientific socialism. By contrast, the so-called &quot;rightists&quot; were in favour of social democracy and aimed at establishing a welfare state. The party was generally the mainstay of the &quot;Kakushin&quot; (radical-liberal forces) camp.

The JSP&#x27;s foundation program in 1945 was three sentences long and stated that the party was &quot;the national rally of the laboring strata&quot;. This program was maintained until 1955. Both nationalization, supported by the left-wing, and socialization, supported by the right-wing, were in the 1955 platform. In the 1950s the party supported a five-year plan to socialize the electricity, coal, iron and steel, chemical fertilizer, transportation, and cement industries. The party supported a minimum wage of in 1961.

After Takako Doi became party leader, the JSP established a European-style democratic socialism line. Apart from the party&#x27;s socialist identity, the Murayama Cabinet, which came to power between 1994 and 1996, supported social-liberal reform.

The JSP opposed Shintoist social conservatism, and was politically friendly with Christianity in the United States. There were quite a few Christians in the JSP. Former Japanese Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama was also a Christian.

===Foreign===
The JSP supported a neutralist foreign policy and opposed amending the Constitution of Japan, especially the Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan. Japan&#x27;s left-wing liberalism emerged as a &quot;peace movement&quot; and was largely led by the JSP. Suzuki stated that he wanted Japan to follow Yugoslavia&#x27;s brand of neutrality rather than Austria&#x27;s. The left-wing participated in anti-American military base protests in 1953, while the right-wing did not. The party was critical of nuclear testing done by the United States and Soviet Union.

The party interacted with the North Korea&#x27;s Korean Social Democratic Party. The party was also strongly opposed to the far-right South Korea&#x27;s anti-communist dictatorship, including Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo-hwan, and allied with South Korean liberals, including Kim Dae-jung. The JSP ended its support for the Two Chinas policy in 1957, and recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China rather than the Republic of China.

The JSP supported Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s nationalization of the Suez Canal. The party&#x27;s factions were heavily divided by the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, with the right-wing supported Hungary and the left-wing supporting the Soviet Union, before a compromise was made stating that &quot;the subsequent de-Stalinization and liberalization were somewhat taken advantage of by reactionary forces, the armed intervention of the Soviet Union cannot be condoned&quot;.

<doc id="898433" wikidata="Q335773" url="?curid=898433" title="Francis Grenfell, 1st Baron Grenfell">
<text>Field Marshal Francis Wallace Grenfell, 1st Baron Grenfell, (29 April 1841 – 27 January 1925) was a British Army officer. After serving as aide-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief, South Africa, he fought in the 9th Xhosa War, the Anglo-Zulu War and then the Anglo-Egyptian War. He went on to become Sirdar (Commander-in-Chief) of the Egyptian Army and commanded the forces at the Battle of Suakin in December 1888 and at the Battle of Toski in August 1889 during the Mahdist War. After that he became Governor of Malta and then Commander-in-Chief, Ireland before retiring in 1908.

==Early life and career==
Born in Maesteg House, Swansea on 29 April 1841, the fourth son of Pascoe St Leger Grenfell and Catherine Anne Grenfell (née Du Pre), and grandson of Pascoe Grenfell, Francis Wallace Grenfell was educated at Milton Abbas School in Dorset but decided to leave school early.

==Military career==
Grenfell purchased a commission as an ensign in the 3rd Battalion of the 60th Royal Rifles on 5 August 1859. He then purchased promotion to lieutenant on 21 July 1863 and to captain (in the last year in which purchase was allowed) on 28 October 1871. He became aide-de-camp to Sir Arthur Cunynghame, Commander-in-Chief, South Africa, in 1874. After taking part in the Battle of Quintana in February 1878 during the 9th Xhosa War in 1878, he was promoted to brevet major on 11 November 1878. He next fought at the Battle of Ulundi in July 1879 during the Anglo-Zulu War and then returned to England to become brigade major at Shorncliffe Army Camp shortly before he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 29 November 1879. He became brigade major of an infantry brigade in South Africa in April 1881 and, having been promoted to the substantive rank of major on 1 July 1881, he fought at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir in September 1882 during the Anglo-Egyptian War. Promoted to brevet colonel on 18 November 1882, he was made aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria that same year.

Grenfell became Deputy Sirdar (Commander-in-Chief) of the Egyptian Army in late 1882 and, after commanding the Egyptian troops stationed at Aswan during the Nile Expedition, he became Sirdar himself in April 1885. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath on 25 August 1885, and having led his troops at the Battle of Ginnis in December 1885, was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel on 7 January 1886. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 25 November 1886. He went on to command the forces at the Battle of Suakin in December 1888 and at the Battle of Toski in August 1889 during the Mahdist War and was promoted to major-general for distinguished service in the field on 3 August 1889. In recognition of the transformation he had achieved in making the Egyptian Army a successful fighting force, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) on leaving Egypt on 25 May 1892.
Returning to England Grenfell became Deputy Adjutant-General at the War Office in 1892 and Inspector General of Auxiliary Forces at the War Office in August 1894. He returned to Egypt as commander of the British Troops in Egypt (under the new Sirdar) in 1897, and having been promoted to lieutenant-general on 1 April 1898, he was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 15 November 1898. He became Governor of Malta with the local rank of general on 1 January 1899, serving as such until early 1903. The 1902 Coronation Honours list on 26 June 1902 included his name as a future peer, and he was created Baron Grenfell, of Kilvey in the County of Glamorgan on 15 July 1902. He took the oath on meeting in the House of Lords for the first time on 22 July 1902.

Lord Grenfell returned permanently to the United Kingdom to command the newly created 4th Army Corps from 1 April 1903. The IV Corps was based on the Eastern Command with headquarters in London. Following promotion to full general on 16 March 1904, he became Commander-in-Chief, Ireland and General Officer Commanding 3rd Army Corps in May 1904. He was promoted to field marshal on retirement on 11 April 1908. In May 1910 he attended the funeral of King Edward VII and in June 1911 he attended the coronation of King George V.

Grenfell served as colonel of the 1st Surrey (South London) Volunteer Regiment from 1889 to 1902, colonel of the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards and then colonel of the 1st Regiment of Life Guards as well as, latterly, colonel commandant the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps and colonel of the King&#x27;s Own Malta Regiment of Militia.

Grenfell was Governor and Commandant of the Church Lads&#x27; Brigade from 1908 to 1925. In 1914, he was responsible for raising the 16th (Service) Battalion, King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (Church Lads&#x27; Brigade) as a battalion for CLB members wishing to enlist. He was also a founding committee member of the Pilgrims Society in 1902.

Grenfell received the Honorary Freedom of the Borough from his native town Swansea in 1889.

He died aged 83 at Windlesham in Surrey on 27 January 1925 and was buried at St Mary and All Saints Churchyard at Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire.

==Legacy==
Grenfell Road, which runs through North Kensington, London was named for Grenfell; the road later lent its name to Grenfell Tower which was built in 1974. In June 2017, Grenfell Tower caught fire, causing 72 deaths.

==Family==
In 1887 Grenfell married Evelyn Wood, daughter of Major General Robert Blucher Wood; they had no children. Following the death of his first wife, he married Margaret Majendie (daughter of Lewis Majendie MP) in 1903; they had two sons and a daughter.
