<text>Sushilkumar Sambhaji Shinde (born 4 September 1941) is an Indian politician from the state of Maharashtra. He was the Minister of Home Affairs, Minister of Power in the Manmohan Singh government, and the Leader of the House in Lok Sabha until 26 May 2014. He previously served as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra from 18 January 2003 to 4 November 2004.

==Early life and education==
Shinde was born on 4 September 1941 at Solapur to Sambhaji Rao Shinde and Sakhu Bai. Shinde completed his education with an honours degree in arts from Dayanand College, Solapur and LLB from ILS Law College and New Law College, University of Bombay, Maharashtra.

==Early career==
Sushilkumar Shinde started his career as a bailiff in the Sessions court of Solapur where he worked from 1957 – 1965. He then joined the Maharashtra Police as a constable. Subsequently, he served in the Maharashtra CID for six years, as a sub-inspector of police, under Amukuraj Patil, his CID mentor.

==Political career==
In the year 1971, Shinde became a member of the Congress Party. He won the Maharashtra state assembly elections in 1974, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1992, 24 May 2003 to August 2004–(General) by-election, September 2004 to 2 October 2004–(General). Shinde was elected to Rajya Sabha from Maharashtra during July 1992 to March 1998. In 1999, he acted as campaign manager of the Congress chairperson Sonia Gandhi in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh. In 2002, Shinde lost the election for the post of Vice-President of India contesting against the National Democratic Alliance candidate Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. He served as the chief minister of Maharashtra from 2003 to 2004. He was appointed the Governor of Andhra Pradesh on 30 October 2004 replacing Surjit Singh Barnala, who became the Governor of Tamil Nadu. He left the office on 29 January 2006.

Shinde was elected unopposed to the Rajya Sabha for the second time from Maharashtra on 20 March 2006. Shinde became the leader of Lok Sabha after his predecessor Pranab Mukherjee was elected President of India. Shinde served as Power minister of India from 2006 to 2012. Later, he was appointed Home Minister of India in 2012. His tenure as a Home Minister saw two major decisions of hanging the terrorists Afzal Guru and Ajmal Kasab.

During the 2012 northern India power grid failure, Shinde deflected criticism by observing that India was not alone in suffering major power outages, as the United States and Brazil had both experienced similar blackouts within the previous few years. Officials in Uttar Pradesh, where the problem was believed to have begun, said the grid could not keep up with the huge demand for power in the hot summer. Uttar Pradesh power corporation chief Awanish Kumar Awasthi stated that the grid collapse was due to the states drawing more than their allotted power to meet the summer demand.

In 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Shinde was the Congress party nominee. He was defeated by BJP Candidate Mr. Sharad Bansode.

Sushilkumar Shinde contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Solapur. Shinde was the Congress party nominee. He was defeated by BJP Candidate Mr. Siddheshwar Maharaj by a margin of 156,261 votes.

According to him, 2019 Indian general elections were the last Lok Sabha elections contested by him.

<text>Krubera Cave (Abkhaz: Ӡоу Аҳаҧы; ; also known as Voronya Cave, sometimes spelled Voronja Cave) is the deepest known cave on Earth. It is located in the Arabika Massif of the Gagra Range of the Western Caucasus, in the Gagra District of Abkhazia, a disputed region of Georgia.
The difference in elevation of the highest cave entrance (Arbaika) and its deepest explored point is . It became the deepest known cave in the world in 2003 when the Ukrainian Speleological Association reached a depth of . This exceeded the previous record, Lamprechtsofen in the Austrian Alps, by . In 2006, for the first time in the history of speleology, the Ukrainian Speleological Association expedition reached a depth greater than 2,000 m (6,560 ft), and explored the cave to . Ukrainian diver Gennadiy Samokhin extended the cave by diving in the terminal sump to 46 metres&#x27; depth in 2007 and then to 52 m in 2012, setting successive world records of 2,191 m and 2,197 m, respectively. Krubera is one of the two known caves deeper than 2,000 metres.

== Naming ==

Georgian speleologists from &quot;Kipiani group&quot; who discovered the cave in 1963 named it for Russian geographer Alexander Kruber and explored it to -57 m. In the 1980s the cave was rediscovered by another group and called &quot;Siberian cave&quot;. It was rediscovered again by Ukrainian speleologists and called &quot;Voronya&quot; (Crows&#x27; cave) after the crows nesting in the entrance pit. Only a later exchange of information between the caving clubs revealed that they explored the same cave.

== Location and background ==

The Arabika Massif, the home of Krubera (Voronya) Cave, is one of the largest high-mountain limestone karst massifs in the Western Caucasus. It is composed of Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic limestones that dip continuously southwest to the Black Sea and plunge below the modern sea level.
To the northwest, north, northeast, and east, Arabika is bordered by the deeply incised canyons of Sandripsh, Kutushara, Gega and Bzyb rivers. The Bzyb River separates Arabika from the adjacent Bzybsky Massif, another outstanding karst area with many deep caves, including the Snezhnaja-Mezhonogo-Iljuzia System () and Pantjukhina Cave (). To the southwest, Arabika borders the Black Sea.
The Arabika Massif has a prominent high central sector with elevations above the tree line at ~. This is an area of classical glaciokarstic landscape, with numerous glacial trough valleys and cirques, with ridges and peaks between them. The bottoms of trough valleys and karst fields lie at elevations of , and ridges and peaks rise to . The highest peak is the Peak of Speleologists () but the dominant summit is a typical pyramidal horn of the Arabika Mount (). Some middle- to low-altitude ridges covered with forest lie between the central sector and the Black Sea. A plateau-like middle-altitude outlier of the massif in its south sector is Mamzdyshkha, with part of the plateau slightly emerging above the tree line.
Among several hundred caves known in the Arabika Massif, fifteen have been explored deeper than 400 m and five deeper than 1,000 m.
Krubera Cave is located at 2,256 m above sea level in the Ortobalagan Valley, a perfectly shaped, relatively shallow, glacial trough of the sub-Caucasian stretch, which holds the advanced position in the Arabika&#x27;s central sector relative to the seashore. Since 1980, Ukrainian cavers have been undertaking systematic efforts in exploring deep caves in the Ortobalagan Valley, resulting in exploration of the Krubera Cave to its current depth and of the surrounding caves, now mostly connected to it. Another deep cave in the valley, located in its very upper part and explored by Moldavian and Ukrainian cavers is Berchilskaya Cave, deep. All large caves of the Ortobalagan Valley likely belong to a single hydrological system, connected to large submarine springs at the Black Sea shore.

== Geology ==

The Ortobalagan Valley extends along the crest of the Berchil&#x27;sky anticline, which gently plunges northwest. The cave entrances are aligned along the anticlinal crest (Figure 2) but the caves are controlled by longitudinal, transverse, and oblique fractures and faults and exhibit complex winding patterns in the plan view, remaining largely within and near the anticlinal crest zone. The caves are predominantly combinations of vadose shafts and steep meandering passages, although in places they cut apparently old fossil passages at different levels (e.g., at in Kujbyshevskaja and Krubera caves, and in the non-Kujbyshevskaja branch of Krubera Cave, etc.). The deep parts of Krubera display a more pervasive conduit pattern with a mixture of phreatic morphology, characteristic of the zone of high-gradient floods, which can be up to 400 m above the low-flow water table, and vadose downcutting elements that are observed even below the water table.
The core part of the Arabika Massif is composed of the Upper Jurassic succession resting on the Bajocian Porphyritic Series, which includes sandstones, clays and conglomerates at the top, and tuff, tuffaceous sandstones, conglomerates and breccia, porphyry and lava. The Porphyritic series forms the non-karstic basement of Arabika, which is exposed only on the northern and eastern outskirts, locally in the bottoms of the Kutushara and Gega River valleys. In the central part of Arabika the Cretaceous cover (Valanginian and Hauterivian limestones, marls and sandstones) is retained only in a few ridges and peaks, but it lies intact through the low-altitude ridges to the south-west of the central part. There the Cretaceous succession includes Barremian and Aptian–Cenomanian limestones and marly limestones with abundant concretions of black chert.
The Upper Jurassic succession begins with thin-bedded Kimmeridgian–Oxfordian cherty limestones, marls, sandstones and clays, which are identified in the lower part of Krubera Cave. Above lies the thick Tithonian succession of thick-bedded limestones with marly and sandy varieties. Sandy limestones are particularly abundant through the upper 1,000 m sections of deep caves of the Ortobalagan Valley.
The tectonic structure of Arabika is dominated by the axis of the large sub-Caucasian anticline (oriented NW–SE), with the gently dipping southwestern mega-flank, complicated by several low-order folds, and steeply dipping northeastern flank (Figure 3). The axis of the anticline roughly coincides with the ridge bordering the Gelgeluk Valley to the north. Located on the southwestern flank of the major anticline is another large one (Berchil&#x27;sky), in which the crest is breached by the Ortobalagan Valley. There are several smaller sub-parallel anticlines and synclines farther southwest, between the Berchil&#x27; Ridge and the coast.
The dislocation structure of the massif is severely complicated by faults, with the fault-block structure strongly controlling both cave development and groundwater flow. Major faults of the sub-Caucasian orientation delineate several large elongated blocks that experienced uplift with different rates during Pliocene and Pleistocene. This had a pronounced effect on the development of deep groundwater circulation and of Krubera Cave in particular. Both longitudinal and transverse faults and related fracture zones play a role in guiding groundwater flow; the latter guide flow across the strike of major plicative dislocations, from the central sector toward the Black Sea.

== Cave entrances ==
The cave has six entrances, in the gallery below they are arranged by altitude, highest to lowest, after the main one. All are situated above the tree line.


== Hydrogeology ==
Major on-shore karst springs with individual average discharges of are located at altitudes ranging from (Reprua Spring) to (Gega waterfall). Two of them are located in the shore area; these are Reprua (average discharge ; altitude above sea level) and Kholodnaja Rechka (; a.s.l.). Two more major springs are located in the river canyons bordering Arabika to the east: Goluboe Ozero in the Bzyb canyon (; a.s.l.) and Gega waterfall in the Gega canyon (; a.s.l.). There are also several smaller springs in the Gagra town. The Reprua River, one of the shortest rivers in the world, about long, starts in the cave and flows toward the Black Sea.
Some boreholes located along the shore of the Black Sea yield karstic groundwater from depths of 40–280 m below sea level. Other much deeper boreholes tapped low-salinity karstic waters at depths of 500 and 1,750 m in the Khashupse Valley near Gantiadi and 2,250 m near Gagra. This suggests the existence of a deep karst system and vigorous karst groundwater circulation at depth.
Submarine springs are known in the Arabika area, emerging from the floor of the Black Sea in front of the massif. Shallow springs at depths of 5–7 m can be reached by free dive near Gantiadi. Tamaz Kiknadze (1979) reported submarine springs near the eastern part of Gagra at depth of 25–30 m and Buachidze and Meliva (1967) revealed submarine discharge at depths up to −400 m by hydrochemical profiling. Recently an outstanding feature of the sea floor topography near Arabika has been revealed from a digital bathymetric map that combines depth soundings and high-resolution marine gravity data. This is a huge submarine depression in front of the Zhovekvara River mouth, which has dimensions of about 5 x 9 km and a maximum depth of about . The Arabika Submarine Depression is a closed feature with internal vertical relief of about (measured from its lowest rim) separated from the abyssal slope by the bar at a depth of about . It has steep northern and northeastern slopes (on the side of the massif) and gentle south and southwestern slopes. Its formation is apparently karstic. Presently this depression seems to be a focus of submarine discharge of the karst systems of Arabika.
The speleological explorations and a series of dye tracing experiments conducted during the 1980s under the coordination of Alexander Klimchouk have radically changed previous notions of the hydrogeology of Arabika, revealed its outstanding speleological perspectives and strongly stimulated further efforts for exploration of deep caves. Tracers injected in the Kujbyshevskaja Cave and the Iljukhina System were detected in the Kholodnaja Rechka and Reprua springs, proving groundwater flow to the south-southwest across major tectonic structures over a distance of 13–16 km as the crow flies (Figure 1). The tracer from Kujbyshevskaja Cave was also detected in a borehole located between these two springs, which yields groundwater from a depth of below sea level. This has been interpreted as an indication of the connection of the cave with the submarine discharge. The large &quot;Central Karst Hydrologic System&quot;, which encompasses most of the southeastern flank of the Arabika anticline, had been identified in this way. The system became the deepest in the world with its overall vertical range of about (measuring to the borehole water-bearing horizon) or even (measuring to the deepest reported submarine discharge points).
Another tracer was injected in the Moskovskaja Cave (−970 m) and detected at the Gegsky Vodopad spring, indicating the presence of a karst hydrologic system comprising the northeastern flank of the Arabika anticline (the &quot;Northern System&quot;). No connections have been revealed with yet another major spring, Goluboje Ozero in the Bzyb River canyon, although it apparently drains a large area of the eastern sector of the massif (the hypothetical &quot;Eastern Karst Hydrological System&quot;). It is not clear where Sarma Cave (−1,550 m) drains to, Goluboje Ozero to the southeast or Reprua to the southwest, at the shore.
The results of the dye-tracing tests demonstrated that groundwater flow is not subordinate to the fold structure but is largely controlled by faults that cut across the strike of major folds, and that the large part of the central sector of Arabika is hydraulically connected to the springs along the seashore and with submarine discharge points.
Krubera Cave has an extremely steep profile and reveals a huge thickness of the vadose zone. The lower boundary of the vadose zone (the top of the phreatic zone) is at an elevation of about at low flow, which suggests a low overall hydraulic gradient of 0.007-0.008. Low-TDS groundwater is tapped by boreholes in the shore area at depths of 40–280, 500, 1,750, and 2,250 m below sea level, which suggests the existence of a deep flow system with vigorous flow. Submarine discharge along the Arabika coast is reported at depths up to ~400 m b.s.l.
It is difficult to interpret these facts in terms of the development of karst systems controlled by contemporary sea level, or within the range of its Pleistocene fluctuations (up to −150 m). In combination with the existence of the Arabika Submarine Depression, all these facts point to the possibility that karst systems in Arabika could have originated in response to the Messinian salinity crisis (5.96–5.33 Ma) when the Black Sea (Eastern Paratethys) could have almost dried up, as did the adjacent Mediterranean, where the dramatic sea level drop of ~1,500 m is well established.

== Biology ==

The biocenosis of Krubera-Voronja is composed of more than 12 species of arthropods of several groups, such as pseudoscorpions, spiders, opiliones, crustaceans, springtails, beetles and dipterans. Krubera-Voronja cave is inhabited by endemic species, including four springtails discovered during the CAVEX Team expedition of 2010: &quot;Anurida stereoodorata&quot;, &quot;Deuteraphorura kruberaensis&quot;, &quot; Schaefferia profundissima&quot;, and &quot;Plutomurus ortobalaganensis&quot;; the last of these is the deepest terrestrial animal ever found on Earth, living below the cave entrance. The beetle &quot;Catops cavicis&quot; inhabits Krubera-Voronja cave and also several caves around the Ortobalagan Valley. The subterranean amphipod crustacean &quot;Kruberia abchasica&quot; caught by Gennady Samokhin in August 2013, during dives in the siphon &#x27;Dva Kapitana&#x27;, dwells at the deepest part of the Krubera Cave (at the depth of −2,175 metres).

== History of exploration ==
=== Early exploration ===
At the beginning of the 20th century, Arabika was visited by French speleologist Édouard-Alfred Martel, who published several works about the massif. In 1909–10 Russian karst scientist Alexander Kruber, a founder of the study in Russia, performed some field studies in Arabika. He published his observations in a series of Arabika-specific papers and several monographs. During the subsequent 50 years no special studies were undertaken of the karst and caves in the region, although the karst of Arabika was referred to in many works dealing with regional geology and hydrogeology.

=== 1960s ===
In the early 1960s, Georgian geographers led by Levan Maruashvili began exploring caves in the high sector of the massif. Among several other caves, they made the first exploration of an open-mouthed 60 m shaft in the Ortobalagan Valley and named it after Alexander Kruber. The first explorers were stopped by impassable squeezes at −95 m in a meandering passage which led off from the foot of the entrance shaft. The cave remained largely neglected over the next 20 years, although occasionally visited by cavers from various caving clubs. Before 1980 there were no caves deeper than known in Arabika.

=== 1980s ===
The new era in cave explorations in the Arabika Massif began in 1980 when the Kiev Speleological Club, led by Alexander Klimchouk, started exploring caves there. They adopted an approach to cave search and exploration which included thorough investigations in a defined area and systematic testing of cave limits, through digging in boulder chokes and enlarging squeezes which had previously obstructed exploration. The Ortobalagan Valley had been selected as a primary focus for the Ukrainian efforts. This approach, followed in subsequent years by other caving clubs which joined exploration activity in different parts of Arabika, resulted in the discovery of many deep caves including five caves deeper than 1,000 m.
In the Ortobalagan Valley, the Ukrainian cavers made breakthroughs in Kuybyshevskaya Cave at −160 m and pushed it to by 1986 through a series of massive boulder chokes. They broke through an impassable squeeze at −120 m in Genrikhova Bezdna Cave and eventually connected it to Kuybyshevskaya at −956 m in 1987. The resultant system has been named the Arabikskaya System.
From 1982 onwards, the Kiev cavers started systematically working in Krubera Cave, located less than 200 meters from the Kuybyshevskaya entrance, hoping to connect with the Arabikskaya System and increase its total depth by 60 m. Exploration progressed slowly because critically tight meanders between the pits required enormous amounts of work to widen them to a passable size. The cave was pushed to −340 m during 1982–1987. Two &quot;windows&quot; in a vertical shaft at depths of 220–250 m were documented on the cave map but remained unexplored. During this time the cave received its second, alternative name (Crows&#x27;) Cave, owing to the number of crows nesting in the entrance shaft.

=== 1990s–early 2000s ===
The political and ethnic conflict in Abkhazia during 1992–94 resulted in instability and border problems which continued over subsequent years. This suspended speleological explorations in Arabika. Some stabilization of the situation in 1998 has since enabled a renewal of exploration efforts to take place in the region.
In 1999, the expedition of the Ukrainian Speleological Associations (Ukr. S.A.) led by Jurij Kasjan (also spelled Yuriy Kasyan) made a major breakthrough in Krubera Cave by discovering and exploring two branches behind the windows at a depth of 220–250 m. These branches stretched in two different directions. The &quot;Main Branch&quot; was explored to −740 m and the &quot;Nekuybyshevskaya Branch&quot; to −500 m.
In 2000, the Main Branch was quickly pushed by the multi-stage expedition of the Ukr. S.A. in August to −1,200 m and in September to −1,410 m.
In January 2001, the Ukr.S.A. expedition explored the cave to making it the deepest cave in the world. For the first time in the history of speleology, the deepest cave in the world had been established outside of Western Europe. Since 2001, the Krubera explorations by the Ukr.S.A. have been undertaken within the frame of the multi-year project named &quot;The Call of the Abyss&quot;, coordinated by A. Klimchouk, Y. Kasyan, G. Samokhin and K. Markovskoy. Besides the Ukrainian speleologists, cavers from many countries such as France, Spain, Russia, Moldova, Bulgaria, United Kingdom, Ireland, Israel and Lithuania have taken part in different expeditions of the Ukr.S.A.

=== 2001 onwards ===
The major events in the exploration of Krubera Cave in subsequent years were as follows (see Figure 4 for spot locations):

==== 2001 ====
* August: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Jurij Kasjan. Four underground camps established in the cave: in the Main Branch at −500, −1,200 and −1,400 m and in the Nekujbyshevskaja Branch at −500 m. Systematic inspection and probing of potential leads in the deep sections of the Main Branch; climbing in the Lamprechtsofen tributary; digging in the boulder choke in the Nekuybyshevskaya Branch.

==== 2003 ====
* August: the expedition of the Kiev Speleological Club and the CAVEX team. Tested and passed a sump at −1,440 m (now known as Sump 1), explored the post-sump section to roughly −1,660 m, continued climbing in the Lamprechtsofen tributary.

==== 2004 ====
* July: the CAVEX team started their separate explorations, beyond the Ukr.S.A. project, in Krubera Cave. Continued exploring a section beyond Sump 1 at −1,410 m and reached the next sump (Sump 2 – &quot;Blue Lake&quot;) at depth claimed to be −1,840 m. The depth of that point according to the subsequent Ukr.S.A. survey is −1,775 m.
* August: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Nikolay Solovyov and Alexander Klimchouk. In the Main Branch, surveyed the post-sump series, established a camp at −1,640 m, discovered a lead to a new section (&quot;The Way to the Dream&quot;) and explored to −1,840 m. Explored the Uzhgorodskaya Series in the upper part of Krubera by climbing an 80 m high shaft in the Meander Krym. Continued working in the Nekuybyshevskaya Branch.
* October: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Jurij Kasjan. In the Main Branch, discovered a lead into a new section beyond the Big Junction at −1,790 m. Explored this section named &quot;Windows&quot; to a blind chamber called &quot;Game Over&quot; at −2,080 m. &quot;The depth mark of 2,000 m had been passed for the first time in the history of speleology.&quot;

==== 2005 ====
* February–March: the Ukr. S.A. expedition led by Jurij Kasjan. In the Main Branch, continued exploring the &quot;Windows&quot; series where many side leads and several sumps were tested. A sump at −1,980 m called &quot;Kvitochka&quot; was passed by Nikolay Solovyov, and a continuation found behind it.
* July: the CAVEX team expedition. Explored the section beyond the Kvitochka Sump to a further sump called Dva Kapitana (&quot;Two Captains&quot;) at −2,140 m.
* August: the Ukr. S.A. expedition led by Nikolay Solovyov. Continued digging and broke through the boulder choke at −500 m in the Nekuybyshevskaya Branch, explored it to the next boulder choke at −640 m.
* October: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Jurij Kasjan. The exploration beyond the Kvitochka Sump had been cancelled due to a sudden flood. Established a camp at −1,960 m. Performed a verification survey to −1,200 m by hydrolevelling to assess the precision of the standard Ukr.S.A. survey (the Russian Geographic Society group). Continued climbing in the Lamprechtsofen tributary to +210 m relative to the junction.

==== 2006 ====
* August–September: the Ukr.S.A. expedition coordinated by Jurij Kasjan. In the Main Branch the terminal sump called &quot;Dva Kapitana&quot; (&quot;Two Captains&quot;) was tested by Gennadiy Samokhin to a depth of 17 m, which extended the total depth of Krubera Cave to . In the Nekuybyshevskaya Branch, a group led by Kyryl Markovskoy broke through the boulder choke at −640 m and explored a continuation to −1,004 m.

==== 2007 ====
* January: the CAVEX team expedition. Performed a dive in the terminal &quot;Dva Kapitana&quot; sump and claimed it to reach −30 m depth below the water table. However, characteristics of morphology of the underwater passage reported by the team were not confirmed by the subsequent exploration, and no safety line was found deeper than 16 m.
* August–September: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Jurij Kasjan. In the Main Branch, Gennadiy Samokhin dived the terminal &quot;Dva Kapitana&quot; Sump for a length of 140 m and depth of −46 m, which set the new depth for Krubera Cave at . After an elbow at -35 m the underwater passage continues to depth under steep angle. Also in the deep parts of the Main Branch, several side passages and sumps at various depths were explored. In a side branch which previously ended at −1,775 m by the &quot;Blue Lake&quot; sump, a series of air-filled passages was explored behind the sump, separated by six intermediary sumps. The farthest sump, &quot;Yantarny&quot;, was explored for 130 m in length and 19.5 m in depth and continues. The deepest point in this branch has been reached at −1,841 m. In the Nekuybyshevskaya Branch, a group led by Kyryl Markovskoy continued exploring new leads and extended the depth of this branch to −1,293 m.

==== 2008 ====
* September: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Jurij Kasjan. Explored the Nekuybyshevskaya Branch to a depth of . An international scientific expedition &quot;Towards the Centre of the Earth&quot;, led by Lithuanian Aidas Gudaitis (Aenigma), descended the main branch as far as , placing water level loggers at siphons here and in the &quot;Chamber of Soviet Speleologists&quot; at .

==== 2009 ====
* August–September: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Jurij Kasjan further pushed the Nekuybushevskaya Branch to a siphon at a depth of . The international &quot;Towards the Centre of the Earth&quot; expedition led by Aidas Gudaitis returned to the main branch to collect data from water level loggers, swap their locations and push exploration in the &quot;Spanish branch&quot; near camp 1400. 2008–2009 data collected from 1,710 m and 1,800 m indicated that the sump levels rose in two distinct periods: continuously from May–July 2009 and with an isolated pulse in October 2008, both sumps reaching a maximum flood depth of 12 m. New logger locations at depths of 1,800 m, 1,980 m (Kvitochka sump) and 2,140 m (Dva Kapitana&#x27;s sump).

==== 2010 ====
* July–August: The CAVEX Team Summer expedition led by Konstantin Mujin performed the first biospeleological studies in the Krubera-Voronya cave. The biospeleological studies led by the cave biologists Ana Sofia Reboleira and Alberto Sendra, provided the deepest subterranean arthropods of the Earth.
* August: During &quot;Towards the Centre of the Earth&quot; expedition led by Aidas Gudaitis, a Lithuanian member of Aenigma caving club Saulė Pankienė became the first woman to dive Kvitochka sump at 1,980 m, and subsequently to descend to the &quot;Two Captains&quot; sump at a depth of . Water level measurement results of 2009–2010, collected during this expedition, showed that the water level rose up to above the sump &quot;Two Captains&quot; during June 2010. Data logging devices were installed by Irish members of the expedition near to the entrance of the cave, to log surface conditions and enable correlation of data between surface and underground locations. &quot;Spanish Branch&quot; exploration was completed and a limit was reached with 131 m total passage surveyed.

==== 2012 ====
* August: A team of 59 spent 27 days exploring Krubera. Including members from nine different countries, the team set up a series of camps underground. Ukrainian cave diver Gennady Samokhin was responsible for reaching a new world depth record of .

==== 2024 ====

* August: total denivelation of the cave was reported to be –2224 metres after repeated survey of the whole cave and subsequent dive in the bottom sump.

<doc id="894349" wikidata="Q1196084" url="?curid=894349" title="MXML">
<text>MXML is an XML-based user interface markup language first introduced by Macromedia in March 2004. Application developers use MXML in combination with ActionScript to develop rich web applications, with products such as Apache Flex.

Adobe Systems, which acquired Macromedia in December 2005, gives no official meaning for the acronym MXML. Some developers suggest it should stand for &quot;Magic eXtensible Markup Language&quot; (which is a backronym). It is likely that the name comes from the MX suffix given to Macromedia Studio products released in 2002 and 2004, or simply &quot;Macromedia eXtensible Markup Language&quot;.

MXML is used mainly to declaratively lay out the interface of applications and can also be used to implement business logic and internet application behaviors. It can contain chunks of ActionScript code, either when creating the body of an event handler function, or with data binding where the curly braces ({) syntax is used.

MXML is often used with Flex Server, which dynamically compiles it into standard binary SWF files. However, the Adobe Flash Builder IDE (formerly Adobe Flex Builder) and free Flex SDK can also compile MXML into SWF files without the use of a Flex Server.

There is also a PHP PEAR package called XML_MXML, which is a framework to build Adobe Flex applications.

MXML is considered a proprietary standard due to its tight integration with Adobe technologies. It is like XAML in this respect. No published translators exist for converting an MXML document to another user interface language such as UIML, XUL, XForms, XAML, or SVG. However, there do exist third party vendor plugins for Flex Builder that are capable of generating a result other than a SWF file from Flex applications, for instance native mobile applications.

<text>Jason Lawrence Geiger (born September 17, 1974), professionally known as Austin St. John, is an American actor best known for his portrayal of Jason Lee Scott in the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise.

== Early life ==
Austin St. John is the son of U.S. Marine and martial artist Steve John and his wife, Sharon. He has one sibling, a brother named Stephen. With a parent in the armed forces, St. John lived all over the United States while growing up.

== Career ==
Austin St. John&#x27;s first acting role and most well-known role to date came to him when he was just 17 years old, when he was cast as teen superhero Jason Lee Scott, the Red Power Ranger in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, the first installment of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise, which debuted on Fox Kids in 1993. For his role, he took the stage name Austin St. John, Austin coming from &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;&#x27;s Steve Austin and St. John being a name of his own choosing.

Like St. John, his character had a background in martial arts. Though the series was hugely successful and brought St. John international recognition as an actor, long hours on set combined with low pay and no union recognition presented real challenges for him. As a result, St. John, along with all of his other co-stars including Jason David Frank agreed to leave the show during its second season if their employers rejected their pay demands and unionization attempts, but when time came, only Walter Emanuel Jones and Thuy Trang joined him in the ultimatum and ultimately left the show. St. John was replaced by Steve Cardenas as the Red Ranger.

St. John went on to reprise the role of Jason several times over, in both film and television, including a permanent role in &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;, and making an appearance as the character in 2002, in an episode of &quot;Power Rangers Wild Force&quot; entitled &quot;Forever Red&quot;. He also appeared alongside Jones, as himself, in the Power Rangers special The Lost Episode in 1999, which focused on the history of the franchise up to that point and showed the original pilot episode for the series, which had never before been aired.

In 2017, he made a cameo in the movie &quot;Surge of Power: Revenge of the Sequel&quot;. In 2018, he was acting in the television movie &quot;Monsters At Large&quot; and had a major role in the 2019 dramatic movie &quot;A Walk with Grace&quot;.

In 2020, St. John reprised the role of Jason in a second season episode of &quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot; titled &quot;Grid Connection&quot;.

In 2022, he had the lead role in the film &quot;Tres Leches&quot;, directed by John Schneider. The film is available for free on Schneider&#x27;s official YouTube channel.

=== Other ventures ===
Austin St. John began as a proficient martial artist, holding a second-degree black belt in Taekwondo, a first-degree black belt in Judo and a first-degree black belt in Kenpo and for a time, he worked as a martial arts instructor. Additionally, he published a book on the subject, &quot;Karate Warrior: A Beginner&#x27;s Guide to Martial Arts&quot;, in 1996.

In February 2024, he announced plans to start a controversial &quot;warrior&quot;-inspired clothing line featuring quotes from prominent historical figures — including Adolf Hitler. This drew fierce condemnation from fans, as well as Amy Jo Johnson, who costarred in the series as Kimberly Hart, the Pink Ranger. The clothing line debuted in April 2024, however, the theme had been altered from warriors to wise leaders, titled Wise Leader Wear, and now included quotes from Anne Frank. St. John debuted the line with a video on his X account in which he stated that his store would not be including Hitler.

== Personal life ==
Austin St. John attended Robert Frost Middle School and W.T. Woodson High School in Fairfax, VA, before moving to Fullerton, California, where he attended Sunny Hills High School, but did not graduate. As an adult, he went on to earn his G.E.D. and ultimately obtained his undergraduate degree from Concordia University.

=== CARES Act indictment ===
In May 2022, St. John was indicted on federal criminal charges related to the CARES Act. He allegedly conspired in a $3.5 million scheme to create businesses or use an existing business to submit applications to fraudulently obtain Paycheck Protection Program funding. Prosecutors said participants in the conspiracy would file false supporting documentation and misrepresent key details, including the number of their employees and the amount of their payroll, causing the Small Business Administration and financial institutions to issue loans. Prosecutors allege St. John and co-defendants paid the ringleaders of the scheme, and spent the money on personal purchases. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison.

Since the indictment, St. John agreed to be put on pre-trial release. He is only allowed to leave the state of Texas for work, with the permission of the court. This includes his previously scheduled convention appearances. On May 25, 2022, St. John released a video confirming these recent events as true and reiterated his legal inability to discuss said events at his entertainment-based public appearances. St. John pled guilty to the charges on April 22, 2024 as part of a plea agreement, the notice of which was published on May 1.

<doc id="894355" wikidata="Q316054" url="?curid=894355" title="Quintus Tullius Cicero">
<text>Quintus Tullius Cicero ( , ; 102 BC – 43 BC) was a Roman statesman and military leader, as well as the younger brother of Marcus Tullius Cicero. He was born into a family of the equestrian order, as the son of a wealthy landowner in Arpinum, some south-east of Rome. He is known for his political career, governorship of Asia, time serving as a general in Gaul under Caesar, and for his relationship with Cicero.

== Biography ==

Cicero&#x27;s well-to-do father arranged for him to be educated with his brother in Rome, Athens and probably Rhodes in 79–77 BC. Around 70 BC, he married Pomponia (sister of his brother&#x27;s friend Atticus), a dominant woman of strong personality. He divorced her after a long disharmonious marriage with much bickering between the spouses in late 45 BC. His brother, Marcus, tried several times to reconcile the spouses, but to no avail. The couple had a son born in 66 BC and named Quintus Tullius Cicero after his father.

Quintus was aedile in 66 BC, praetor in 62 BC, and propraetor of the province of Asia for three years (61-59 BC.) Under Caesar, during the Gallic Wars, he was legatus (accompanying Caesar on his second expedition to Britain in 54 BC and surviving a Nervian siege of his camp during Ambiorix&#x27;s revolt), and was under his brother when the latter was governor in Cilicia in 51 BC. During Caesar&#x27;s civil war, he supported the Pompeian faction, obtaining the pardon of Caesar later.

During the Second Triumvirate, when the Roman Republic was again in civil war, Quintus, his son, and his brother were all proscribed. He fled from Tusculum with his brother. Later, Quintus went home to bring back money for travelling expenses. His son hid his father and did not reveal the hiding place even under torture. When Quintus heard this, he gave himself up to try to save his son, but father, son, and famous brother, were killed in 43 BC as proscribed persons.

==Personality and relationship with brother Marcus==

Quintus is depicted by Caesar as a brave soldier and an inspiring military leader. At a critical moment in the Gallic Wars, he rallied his legion and retrieved an apparently hopeless position. Caesar commended him for this with the words &quot;He praised Cicero and his men very highly, as they deserved&quot;. However, later the legate was purportedly responsible for a near-disaster in Gaul but does not receive condemnation from Caesar as a result.

Quintus had an impulsive temperament and had fits of cruelty during military operations, a behaviour frowned on by Romans of that time. The Roman (and stoic) ideal was to control one&#x27;s emotions even in battle. Quintus Cicero also liked old-fashioned and harsh punishments, like putting a person convicted of patricide into a sack and throwing him into the sea. Such convicts were traditionally &quot;stripped, scourged, sewn up in a sack together with [a] dog, a cock, a viper, and a monkey, and thrown into a river or the sea to drown&quot;. This punishment he meted out during his propraetorship of Asia.

His brother confessed in one of his letters to his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus (written in 51 BC while he was Proconsul of Cilicia and had taken Quintus as legatus with him) that he dares not leave Quintus alone as he is afraid of what kind of sudden ideas he might have. On the positive side, Quintus was utterly honest, even as a governor of a province, in which situation many Romans shamelessly amassed private property for themselves. He was also a well-educated man who enjoyed reading Greek tragedies, and even wrote some tragedies himself.

The relationship between the brothers was mostly affectionate, except for a period of serious disagreement during Caesar&#x27;s dictatorship 49-44 BC. The many letters from Marcus &quot;ad Quintum fratrem&quot; show how deep and affectionate the brothers&#x27; relationship was, though Marcus Cicero often played the role of the &quot;older and more experienced&quot; sibling, lecturing to his brother on what the right thing to do was.

==Authorship==

As an author during the Gallic wars, he wrote four tragedies in the Greek style. Three of them were titled &quot;Troas&quot;, &quot;Erigones&quot;, and &quot;Electra&quot;, but all are lost. He also wrote several poems on the second expedition of Caesar to Britannia, three epistles to Tiro (extant) and a fourth one to his brother. The long letter &quot;Commentariolum Petitionis&quot; (&quot;Handbook on electioneering&quot;) has also survived. Although its authenticity has been much questioned, recently the scholar Andrew Lintott has argued that Quintus was the true author. It is in any case a guide to political behavior in Cicero&#x27;s time.

<doc id="894368" wikidata="Q2634309" url="?curid=894368" title="Productivity (linguistics)">
<text>In linguistics, productivity is the degree to which speakers of a language use a particular grammatical process, especially in word formation. It compares grammatical processes that are in frequent use to less frequently used ones that tend towards lexicalization. Generally the test of productivity concerns identifying which grammatical forms would be used in the coining of new words: these will tend to only be converted to other forms using productive processes.

==Examples in English==
In standard English, the formation of preterite and past participle forms of verbs by means of ablaut (as Germanic strong verbs, for example, &quot;sing&quot;–&quot;sang&quot;–&quot;sung&quot;) is no longer considered productive. Newly coined verbs in English overwhelmingly use the &#x27;weak&#x27; (regular) ending &quot;-ed&quot; for the past tense and past participle (for example, &quot;spammed&quot;, &quot;e-mailed&quot;). Similarly, the only clearly productive plural ending is &quot;-(e)s&quot;; it is found on the vast majority of English count nouns and is used to form the plurals of neologisms, such as &quot;FAQs&quot; and &quot;Muggles&quot;. The ending &quot;-en&quot;, on the other hand, is no longer productive, being found only in &quot;oxen&quot;, &quot;children&quot;, and the now-rare &quot;brethren&quot; (as a plural of &quot;brother&quot;). Because these old forms can sound incorrect to modern ears, regularization can wear away at them until they are no longer used: &quot;brethren&quot; has now been replaced with the more regular-sounding &quot;brothers&quot; except when talking about religious orders. It appears that many strong verbs were completely lost during the transition from Old English to Middle English, possibly because they sounded archaic or were simply no longer truly understood.

In both cases, however, occasional exceptions have occurred. A false analogy with other verbs caused &quot;dug&quot; to become thought of as the &#x27;correct&#x27; preterite and past participle form of &quot;dig&quot; (the King James Bible preferred &quot;digged&quot; in 1611) and more recent examples, like &quot;snuck&quot; from &quot;sneak&quot; and &quot;dove&quot; from &quot;dive&quot;, have similarly become popular. Some American English dialects also use the non-standard &quot;drug&quot; as the past tense of &quot;drag&quot;.

==Significance==
Since production of novel (new, non-established) structures is the clearest proof of usage of a grammatical process, the evidence most often appealed to as establishing productivity is the appearance of novel forms of the type the process leads one to expect, and many people would limit the definition offered above to exclude use of a grammatical process that does not result in a novel structure. Thus in practice, and, for many, in theory, productivity is the degree to which speakers use a particular grammatical process &quot;for the formation of novel structures&quot;. A productive grammatical process defines an open class, one which admits new words or forms. Non-productive grammatical processes may be seen as operative within closed classes: they remain within the language and may include very common words, but are not added to and may be lost in time or through regularization converting them into what now seems to be a correct form.

Productivity is, as stated above and implied in the examples already discussed, a matter of degree, and there are a number of areas in which that may be shown to be true. As the modern example of &quot;snuck&quot; from &quot;sneak&quot; shows, what has apparently been non-productive for many decades or even centuries may suddenly come to some degree of productive life, and it may do so in certain dialects or sociolects while not in others, or in certain parts of the vocabulary but not others. Some patterns are only very rarely productive, others may be used by a typical speaker several times a year or month, whereas others (especially syntactic processes) may be used productively dozens or hundreds of times in a typical day. It is not atypical for more than one pattern with similar functions to be comparably productive, to the point that a speaker can be in a quandary as to which form to use —e.g., would it be better to say that a taste or color like that of raisins is &quot;raisinish&quot;, &quot;raisiny&quot;, &quot;raisinlike&quot;, or even &quot;raisinly&quot;? 

It can also be very difficult to assess when a given usage is productive or when a person is using a form that has already been learned as a whole. Suppose a reader comes across an unknown word such as &quot;despisement&quot; meaning &quot;an attitude of despising&quot;. The reader may apply the verb+&quot;ment&quot; noun-formational process to understand the word perfectly well, and this would be a kind of productive use. This would be essentially independent of whether or not the writer had also used the same process productively in coining the term, or whether he or she had learned the form from previous usage (as most English speakers have learned &quot;government&quot;, for instance), and no longer needed to apply the process productively in order to use the word. Similarly a speaker or writer&#x27;s use of words like &quot;raisinish&quot; or &quot;raisiny&quot; may or may not involve productive application of the noun+&quot;ish&quot; and noun+&quot;y&quot; rules, and the same is true of a hearer or reader&#x27;s understanding of them. But it will not necessarily be at all clear to an outside observer, or even to the speaker and hearer themselves, whether the form was already learnt and whether the rules were applied or not.

==Examples in other languages==
One study, which focuses on the usage of the Dutch suffix &quot;-heid&quot; (comparable to &quot;-ness&quot; in English) hypothesizes that &quot;-heid&quot; gives rise to two kinds of abstract nouns: those referring to concepts and those referring to states of affairs. It shows that the referential function of &quot;-heid&quot; is typical for the lowest-frequency words, while its conceptual function is typical for the highest-frequency words. It claims that high-frequency formations with the suffix &quot;-heid&quot; are available in the mental lexicon, whereas low-frequency words and neologisms are produced and understood by rule.

<doc id="894369" wikidata="Q737645" url="?curid=894369" title="Kumar Sangakkara">
<text>Kumar Chokshanada Sangakkara (; born 27 October 1977) is a Sri Lankan former professional cricketer who represented Sri Lanka from 2000 to 2015. A former captain in all formats. He was born in Matale, Central Province. In first-class cricket, he played for Nondescripts Cricket Club from 1997–98 to 2013–14 and for Surrey County Cricket Club from 2015 to 2017. He was a key part of the Sri Lankan squads which won the 2001-02 Asian Test Championship, 2002 ICC Champions Trophy and 2014 T20 World Cup.

Sangakkara played mostly as a wicket-keeper-batter and is generally regarded as one of the greatest wicket-keeper-batters in cricket history. His 38 Test centuries and 25 in ODIs are both highest for a wicket-keeper. He batted left-handed and, although he rarely bowled, was a right-arm off spinner. In all three forms of international cricket, Sangakkara is the second-highest run-scorer, having amassed a total of 28,016 including 63 centuries.

He has highest average amongst the batsmen who have completed 10000 or more runs in Test Cricket.

Since retirement, he has worked as a commentator for Sky Sports and served as President of the MCC from October 2019 to September 2021. In January 2021, Sangakkara also became the coach of Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League from 2021-2024.He was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in June 2021, the second Sri Lankan player to be inducted after Muttiah Muralitharan.

He has recently come out of retirement to play for Dorset Division 3 side Shillingstone CC. He bats at 5 after claiming he is &quot;untested at this level&quot;.

==Early life==
Kumar Sangakkara was born in Matale, Central Province, on 27 October 1977. He is the fourth and youngest child of Kshema, a civil lawyer, and Kumari Sangakkara. Kumar was brought up in the family home near Kandy. His father was very keen on sport and would daily spend hours coaching his children.

Sangakkara&#x27;s childhood, youth and most of his cricket career were set against the background of the ruinous Sri Lankan Civil War (1983–2009) between the Tamil militants (mainly the Tamil Tigers) and the government of Sri Lanka. It is generally held that the war began with the Black July riots in 1983. During Black July, Sangakkara&#x27;s parents offered shelter to Tamil families, whom six-year-old Kumar viewed as his friends.

He was educated at Trinity College, Kandy. Musically talented, he was a chorister and played the violin. He excelled in several sports and his mother Kumari wanted him to concentrate on his best one. The choice was between cricket and tennis. Kumari sought the advice of college principal Leonard de Alwis, who said Kumar should focus on cricket. The Sangakkaras are a sporting family and Kumar&#x27;s three elder siblings all excelled in sports at Trinity. His two sisters, Thushari and Saranga, played basketball and tennis respectively, both at representative level. Saranga won a national tennis championship. Kumar&#x27;s elder brother Vemindra represented the college in both cricket and badminton.

Sangakkara represented his school&#x27;s Under-13, under-15, under-17, and first XI teams. In August 1994, when he was 16, he went to Kuala Lumpur with Sri Lanka&#x27;s national under-19 team and played in two one-day matches against Bangladesh under-19s. Even so, he modestly described himself as a &quot;run-of-the-mill&quot; cricketer while he was at school, but he said facing real competition at Nondescripts Cricket Club spurred him on to improve his game and strive to reach a high standard. Academically successful, he was the school&#x27;s Senior Prefect (Head Boy) and received its Trinity Lion and Ryde Gold Medal awards. He passed the Advance Level Examination and gained entry to the Faculty of Law at the University of Colombo. However, he had to indefinitely postpone his law degree due to his cricketing commitments; he said in 2011 that he would consider finishing it after his cricket career ended.

==Playing career==
===1997 to 2002===
====Nondescripts and the under-19s====
After he entered the University of Colombo in 1996, Sangakkara joined Nondescripts who were one of the city&#x27;s most notable clubs and he spent most of his domestic career, until 2014, with them. Having played for Sri Lanka under-19s while he was still at school, he made further appearances for the team in the 1996–97 season. In February 1997, he played in three Under-19 Tests against the touring India under-19 team, though he did not keep wicket. In the second match, he was run out for 96 in Sri Lanka&#x27;s first innings. In March, he played in three Under-19 One-Day Internationals (ODIs) against India under-19s.

====First-class and List A debuts====
Sangakkara began his professional career in the 1997–98 season when he was 20 years old. He made his List A debut on 28 December 1997 in a 50-over match, playing for Nondescripts against Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic Club at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo. The match was a Hatna Trophy semi-final which Nondescripts won by 71 runs. Sangakkara scored 18 in a total of 211. Nondescripts went on to win the tournament, defeating Tamil Union by 5 wickets in the final.

Soon afterwards, on 9 January 1998, he made his first-class debut in a Saravanamuttu Trophy match, also against Bloomfield C&amp;A, at the Nondescripts Cricket Club Ground in Colombo. This was a three-day national championship match which ended in a draw. Sangakkara kept wicket and was seventh in the Nondescripts batting order. He held three catches and, in his only innings, scored six runs. He played in six championship matches that season. Nondescripts finished third in Group A of the competition and marginally failed to gain a place in the play-offs.

In the 1998–99 season, the Saravanamuttu Trophy was rebranded as the Premier Championship and Sangakkara played in fourteen matches from January to June 1999. He had only moderate success as a batter, scoring 444 runs with a highest innings of 55; but he made his mark as a wicket-keeper by completing 33 dismissals (32 catches and one stumping). The two group system was abandoned and the championship became a straight league competition in which the sixteen teams played each other once. Nondescripts, with four wins in their fifteen matches, finished fifth. During the season, Sangakkara played in five one-day matches for Sri Lanka B in a triangular tournament with Sri Lanka A and the English team Leicestershire, who were on tour.

====Sri Lanka A (1999–2000)====
In November 1999, Sangakkara was selected for the Sri Lanka A team&#x27;s tour of South Africa. It was at this point that he decided to abandon his degree course and leave university. On the tour, he played in three limited overs and two first-class matches against South Africa A, his best performance being an innings of 89 in one of the limited overs games. On 20 May 2000, playing in a limited overs match for Sri Lanka A against the touring Zimbabwe A at the De Soysa Stadium in Moratuwa, Sangakkara played an outstanding innings of 156 not out, which helped him to obtain a place in Sri Lanka&#x27;s national team two months later.

He played in seven Premier Championship matches for Nondescripts in 1999–2000, but the team had a poor season. The two groups format was revived with Nondescripts in Group A and finishing fifth. Nondescripts played in Group B of the Premier Limited Overs Tournament but they again disappointed and did not qualify for the play-offs.

====Test and ODI debuts (July 2000)====
In July 2000, Sri Lanka hosted the Singer Triangular Series between themselves, Pakistan, and South Africa. The teams played each other twice in a round-robin league format and the top two, South Africa and Sri Lanka, qualified for the final which Sri Lanka won by 30 runs. Sangakkara made his One Day International (ODI) debut in the opening match when Sri Lanka played Pakistan at the Galle International Stadium on 5 July. Pakistan batted first and scored 164/8 from their 45 overs (reduced from 50 because of a delay caused by bad weather). Sangakkara kept wicket and made an important contribution when he caught Mohammad Yousuf off Nuwan Zoysa for a first-ball &quot;duck&quot;. Sri Lanka needed only 37.3 overs to score 166/5 and win the match by five wickets with 45 balls in hand. Sangakkara was fifth in the batting order and made 35 before he was run out by Imran Nazir at 131/4. ESPN&#x27;s cricket writer Charlie Austin wondered if Sangakkara had &quot;the head for international cricket and also the technique&quot;. He was impressed enough to describe Sangakkara as &quot;a down to earth man, both intelligent and mature, who was unfazed by the situation and was immediately off the mark with a fluid square drive&quot;.

In the second match, when Sri Lanka played South Africa at Galle on 6 July, Sangakkara was voted Man of the Match after he scored 85 before again being run out, this time by Makhaya Ntini. He shared a fifth wicket partnership of 120 with Russel Arnold (59 not out) and Sri Lanka totalled 249/7 in their 50 overs. South Africa were all out for 212, Sangakkara catching Jonty Rhodes off his first ball, and Sri Lanka won by 37 runs.

Sangakkara played in all five of Sri Lanka&#x27;s matches in the tournament, dismissing seven batters (3 caught, 4 stumped) and scoring 199 runs at 66.33 to secure his place in the upcoming Test series against South Africa.

He made his Test debut at Galle on 20–23 July in the first match of the three-match series. Sri Lanka won by an innings and 15 runs. In his team&#x27;s only innings, Sangakkara was fifth in the batting order and had scored 23 when he was dismissed leg before wicket (lbw) by Nicky Boje. Sri Lanka totalled 522 and then bowled South Africa out for 238 and 269 to win with a day to spare. Sangakkara kept wicket and held two catches to dismiss Gary Kirsten in the first innings and Lance Klusener in the second. Both catches were off the bowling of Muttiah Muralitharan who took 13 wickets in the match. Sangakkara also dismissed Kirsten in the second innings when he took a throw from Chaminda Vaas to complete a run out.

====2000–01 season====
Nondescripts won the Premier Championship in 2000–01 but Sangakkara missed most of their matches due to international commitments. In October 2000, he travelled to Nairobi and Sharjah for two limited overs competitions. Sri Lanka reached the final of the Coca-Cola Champions Trophy in Sharjah and defeated India by 245 runs. Batting first, Sri Lanka scored 299/5 in their 50 overs. Sangakkara was bowled for 8 by Sachin Tendulkar. India collapsed and were all out for 54 in just 26 overs, Sangakkara completing two dismissals (a catch and a run out).

From November 2000 to February 2001, he was on overseas tours with Sri Lanka who visited South Africa and New Zealand. In South Africa, he played in three Tests and six ODIs as well as some matches against provincial teams; Sri Lanka were heavily beaten in both series. On the second tour, Sri Lanka played ODIs only against New Zealand and Sangakkara played in all five; Sri Lanka won the series 4–1. Returning home, he played in three Tests and three ODIs against England, who toured Sri Lanka in February and March 2001. England won the Test series 2–1 and Sri Lanka won the ODI series 3–0. The second Test, played at the Asgiriya Stadium in Kandy, was highly controversial because of incompetent umpiring by B. C. Cooray whose errors probably cost Sri Lanka the match and the series. One of the consequences was bad feeling between the players and Sangakkara became involved in a heated argument with Michael Atherton, who was seen to be wagging a finger at him. When asked about it afterwards, Atherton alleged that Sangakkara had called the England team &quot;cheats&quot;.

The Premier Championship was re-vamped again so that the top four teams in each of Groups A and B formed a Super League. In this, the eight teams played each other once. Winning teams were awarded twelve points and there were also bonus points for achieving batting and bowling targets. Crucially for Nondescripts, the team with the highest first innings total in a drawn match was awarded eight points. Nondescripts, who had finished second in Group B, won only one Super League match while runners-up Burgher Recreation Club won three; and Burgher had a slight advantage in bonus points gained. What made the difference was that Burgher drew their other four games but led on first innings in only one of them, so their total was 44 plus bonuses. Nondescripts drew their other six games and, in all of them including the one against Burgher, were ahead on first innings for a points total of 60 plus bonuses. Sangakkara was only available for the last two matches including the decisive one against Burgher, although he made little impact. Playing as a specialist batter, he scored only 6 in his one innings. Nondescripts scored 372 and then bowled Burgher out for 125 to claim the first innings points. Burgher followed on and were 79/7 when the match ended in a draw. In the final round of matches, Nondescripts met Colombo Cricket Club while Burgher played Tamil Union. Nondescripts were eight points ahead of Burgher and knew they must gain first innings points at least. Sangakkara again made little impact. After Colombo had been dismissed for 246, he opened the innings and was out for 13. Nondescripts were dismissed for 245 and so, unable to claim first innings points, they had to win the match to remain top of the league. In the second innings, Colombo collapsed and were all out for 141 after off spinner Ruwan Kalpage took a career-best 7/27. Sangakkara scored only 14 and Nondescripts struggled, but they managed to reach 143/7 and win by three wickets. As things turned out, Nondescripts could have lost to Colombo and still won the title because Burgher drew with Tamil Union and were behind on first innings.

====2001–02 season====
Nondescripts won the Premier Limited Overs Tournament in 2001–02 but, as before, Sangakkara&#x27;s involvement was limited by his international commitments. The only match he played in was the final at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo on 19 January 2002. Nondescripts defeated Tamil Union by 44 runs. Batting third, Sangakkara scored 98 at exactly one run per ball. He shared a second wicket partnership of 153 with Aravinda de Silva (65) and Nondescripts totalled 278/8 from their 50 overs. Tamil Union were all out for 234. Seeking to defend their Premier Championship title, Nondescripts reached the play-off semi-final but lost to Colts by 2 wickets; Sangakkara scored 20 and 37.

Sri Lanka hosted three three-match Test series from August 2001 to January 2002. The visitors were India in August, West Indies in November and December, and Zimbabwe in December and January. Sri Lanka also took part in the 2001–02 Asian Test Championship.

In his first-class career to date, Sangakkara had been dismissed in the nineties three times, twice in Test matches. In the first Test against India at Galle, he scored 105 not out and helped his team to a ten-wicket victory. He scored his second century in the first Test against West Indies, also at Galle, in November. West Indies batted first and scored 448, largely due to an innings of 178 by Brian Lara which ended when Sangakkara caught him behind off the bowling of Muralitharan. Sri Lanka replied with 590/9 declared. Sangakkara made their top score of 140 before he was run out. He shared a third wicket partnership of 162 with Mahela Jayawardene (99), a forerunner of things to come. West Indies collapsed in their second innings and were all out for 144, Sri Lanka needing only six runs to win by 10 wickets.

India had withdrawn from the Asian Test Championship for political reasons but Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka continued. The latter two contested the final at the Gaddafi Stadium in March and Sri Lanka won by 8 wickets after Sangakkara scored his first double-century with an innings of 230. Pakistan batted first, totalling 234, and Sri Lanka replied with 528. Sangakkara and Jaywardene (68) added 173 for the third wicket. Pakistan were all out for 325 in their second innings, and Sri Lanka needed only 32 to win. Sangakkara was named Player of the Match.

===2002 to 2006===
By now an established member of the international team, Sangakkara continued to play mostly for Sri Lanka and travelled worldwide during this period. He toured England in both 2002 and 2006. In between those tours, Sri Lanka played series in each of Australia (3), Bangladesh, India, New Zealand (2), Pakistan, South Africa, West Indies, and Zimbabwe. They hosted home series against Australia, Bangladesh (2), England, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, and West Indies. They were in Kenya and South Africa for the 2003 Cricket World Cup, reaching the semi-finals, and hosted the 2004 Asia Cup, which they won.

In domestic cricket, Nondescripts were unable to challenge for further trophies after their successes in 2001 and 2002. In 2003–04, Sangakkara played in five Premier Championship matches and eight Premier Limited Overs Tournament matches, including the semi-final against Bloomfield, but that was the last season in which he was able to make more than a handful of appearances for them. Apart from 2016 and 2017 when he was playing regular first-class cricket in England for Surrey, 2003–04 was the only season in which Sangakkara achieved the target of a thousand runs. He played in sixteen matches and scored 1,191 runs at 44.11 per completed innings with three centuries and eight fifties. His highest score was 125. He also completed 55 dismissals, by far his highest season total, with 43 catches and 12 stumpings.

====2003 World Cup====

====2004 Asia Cup====

====Twenty20 debuts (2004 and 2006)====
Twenty20 (T20) was introduced to Sri Lanka on 17 August 2004 when the first round of the 2004 SLC Twenty20 Tournament was played. There were eight matches that day and a total of 176 players, including Sangakkara, made their T20 debuts. Sangakkara played for Nondescripts against Tamil Union at the Moors Sports Club Ground in Colombo. Batting third, he scored 39 off 21 balls as Nondescripts won by 17 runs. Nondescripts then played Colts at the R. Premadasa Stadium in the quarter-final but lost by 4 wickets; Sangakkara again scored 39.

He made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut on 15 June 2006 when Sri Lanka played England at the Rose Bowl, near Southampton. The match was Sri Lanka&#x27;s first-ever T20I but the team acquitted themselves well to win by 2 runs. They won the toss and, batting first, were all out for 163 (their last wicket fell to the final ball of the innings). Sangakkara came in fifth and hit 21 from 14 deliveries before he was caught by Andrew Strauss. He kept wicket as England replied and completed a catch and a run out. England were 161/5 when their innings closed. Sangakkara&#x27;s run out of Marcus Trescothick was a key moment in the match as Trescothick had scored 72 and the match seemed to be going England&#x27;s way. They needed twelve runs from eight balls after he was out and then needed nine from the 20th over bowled by Dilhara Fernando, who restricted them to six.

====2006 in England====
He made a poor return in his six first-class matches on this tour with only 347 runs at 31.54.

====Sri Lanka v South Africa, 2006====
Sangakkara and Jayawardene set the world record in both Test and first-class cricket for the highest partnership between two batters for any wicket. This was their stand of 624 for the third wicket in the first Test against South Africa in 2006. Sangakkara scored 287 and Jayawardene 374. The partnership is the only one to exceed 600 for any wicket in first-class history In addition, Sangakkara and Jayawardene hold the record for the highest partnership (166 for the 2nd wicket) for any wicket in ICC World T20 history.

===2007 to 2017===
====English county cricket====
Sangakkara played English county cricket with Warwickshire in the 2007 County Championship. In 2010, Sangakkara was contracted to represent Lancashire in the 2010 County Championship, but never represented the club because of international commitments. For the 2015 and 2016 seasons, Sangakkara was contracted to play for Surrey. After his international retirement, Sangakkara continued to play for Surrey and in 2017 scored his 100th century in all formats of the game combined on 13 June 2017.

===Sri Lanka vice-captain (2006–2009)===

When Sri Lanka toured Bangladesh in February 2006 regular captain Marvan Atapattu was injured and Mahela Jayawardene became captain while Sangakkara was made vice-captain. Pakistan toured Sri Lanka for two Test and three ODIs in March 2006, and with Atapattu still injured Jayawardene and Sangakkara remained captain and vice-captain respectively. The pair had only expected to hold the positions on an interim basis, but extended into a third series as Atapattu failed to recover in time to tour England in April and ended up filling the roles full-time. In July 2006, Sangakkara made his second-highest Test score to-date (287) against South Africa. In a record-breaking partnership with Mahela Jayawardene, he set up the world record for the highest partnership in Test cricket—624 runs—in this match.

By this time, Sangakkara was effectively playing as a specialist batter in Test cricket, his wicket-keeping duties having been handed over to Prasanna Jayawardene. Sangakkara continued to play as a wicket-keeper-batter in the limited overs forms.

On 6 December 2007 he made it to the top spot of ICC Test player rankings with a rating of 938, the highest rating ever achieved by a Sri Lankan player, and became the first batsman ever to score in excess of 150 in four consecutive tests. His skill was recognised worldwide when he earned selection for the ICC World XI One-Day International team that competed against Australia in the Johnnie Walker Series in October 2005. Despite the World XI losing all of the one-day games by considerable margins, Sangakkara left the series with some credit, averaging 46. He was one of the winners of the 2008 inaugural ESPNcricinfo awards for outstanding batting in Test cricket. He was once again named in the World Test XI by the ICC in 2010.

Sangakkara holds the record for being the fastest man to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000 (jointly held), 11,000 and 12,000 runs in Test cricket. During Sri Lanka&#x27;s tour to England in May 2006, he was named the vice-captain of the side. On 3 March 2009, a terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team convoy in Pakistan injured 6 Sri Lankan players including Sangakkara. Sangakkara suffered shrapnel wounds in his shoulder. In November 2006, Sangakkara was included in the ICC World XI Test team. Next year, he signed an agreement to join Warwickshire County Cricket Club. That year, he scored back-to-back double centuries in Tests and became only the fifth cricketer in the history to do so.

Sangakkara was in the Sri Lanka teams which reached the finals of the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. He won several awards including:

* ICC ODI Player of the Year: 2011, 2013
* Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World: 2011, 2014
* Wisden Cricketer of the Year: 2012
* ICC Cricketer of the Year: 2012
* ICC Test Player of the Year: 2012
* Wisden India Cricketer of the Year: 2013
* Surrey cap: 2015

===Indian Premier League===
Sangakkara has played in five seasons of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Winning bids for him in 2008 and 2011 were US$700,000 by Kings XI Punjab and US$300,000 by Deccan Chargers, respectively. He was the captain of the Sunrisers Hyderabad team. Sangakkara has scored 1567 runs with 10 half-centuries in 62 matches in IPL.

In January 2021, Sangakkara was named the director of cricket of Rajasthan Royals ahead of the IPL 2021, and subsequently the team&#x27;s head coach. With Rajasthan, he played a crucial role in leading them to the 2022 Indian Premier League final.

===Sri Lanka Premier League===
In the Sri Lanka Premier League which officially started in 2012, Sangakkara was named the captain and icon player of the Kandurata Warriors franchise. Unfortunately, he couldn&#x27;t participate as a player in the inaugural edition in 2012 as he suffered a finger injury weeks before the tournament during a One Day International against India. However, he appeared as a television commentator during some matches.

===Caribbean Premier League===
On 18 August 2013, Sangakkarra joined the Jamaica Tallawahs of the Caribbean Premier League.

===Sri Lanka captaincy===

In February 2009, the then captain of the Sri Lankan side, Mahela Jayawardene announced that he would step down from the captaincy &quot;in the best interests of the Sri Lankan team&quot;. He said he believed that it would give his successor around two years to build up to the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Therefore, at the age of 31 and with the experience of 80 Tests and 246 ODIs, Sangakkara succeeded Jayawardene as Sri Lanka&#x27;s captain in all formats of the game. His first engagement in the role was the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 hosted by England in June. Sri Lanka became runners-up in the series after winning all the game in group and knock-out stages and being defeated by Pakistan in the final. Sangakkara made 64 not-out in the final, but was unable to take Sri Lanka for the championship. He was named in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; by ESPNcricinfo for the 2009 T20I World Cup.

Sri Lanka failed to reach to the knock-out stage of the ICC Champions Trophy in September 2009. The next Indian tour proved to be disastrous for the team, with Sri Lanka being beaten by India in Test series 2–0 and ODI series 3–1.

Sri Lankan team under the captaincy of Sangakkara gained momentum and won the next Tri-series in Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka, beating India as well. The Sri Lankans&#x27; tour of Australia proved to be very successful, in winning both the T20 and ODI series. This was Sri Lanka&#x27;s first ever series victory in Australia.

A month in advance of the 2011 World Cup in March, Sangakkara decided that he would resign the captaincy after the tournament. Sri Lanka reached the final of the tournament. Throughout the tournament Sangakkara was in prolific form with the bat scoring 465 runs from 9 matches and was the third highest run-scorer behind teammate Tillakaratne Dilshan and India&#x27;s Sachin Tendulkar. He was named as captain and wicket-keeper of the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; for the 2011 World Cup by the ICC. He was also named in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; by ESPNcricinfo. During the final, loud crowd noise prevented match referee Jeff Crowe from hearing Sri Lankan captain Sangakkara&#x27;s call as the coin was tossed by Indian captain Dhoni. The toss had to be redone – an extremely unusual event, especially at as prominent an event as the World Cup final. He also criticised the decision of ICC in its attempt to tweak and alter the 2.5-metre rule while a tournament was in progress.

Days after guiding Sri Lanka to the finals of the World Cup, Sangakkara announced to the public he was stepping down as captain of the T20 and ODI teams. He offered to continue as Test captain if deemed necessary for transition to new skipper, but Dilshan was appointed captain across all formats. Reflecting on the decision afterwards, he said that &quot;captaining Sri Lanka is a job that ages you very quickly ... It&#x27;s rarely a job you will last long in ... I also had a two-year stint, and I enjoyed it at times, certainly on the field where our results showed we were one of the top two sides in the world for one-and-a-half years, especially in the shorter form of the game.&quot;

The same year, he was named the ODI Cricketer of the Year at the ICC awards ceremony. In 2012, he was honoured as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.

===Internationals (2011–2014)===
Sri Lanka&#x27;s first fixture after the World Cup was a Sri Lanka tour of England in 2011 beginning in May. During the second match of a three Test series Tillakaratne Dilshan, Sangakkara&#x27;s successor as captain, suffered a broken thumb. Sangakkara filled in while Dilshan was off the pitch and formally assumed the captaincy for the final Test. The match ended in a draw and the series ended in a 1–0 victory for England; Sangakarra scored a century in the match, his first against England in nine Tests.

Sangakkara was named the man of the series in Test series with Pakistan in 2011/12—his first man of the series award in Test cricket. He made 516 runs in the 3 match series which was won by Pakistan 1–0. On August in 2013, he was named the ODI Cricketer of the Year, wicket-keeper-captain of the ICC World XI Test team, and won the ICC People&#x27;s Choice Award in the 2011 ICC Awards. In 2012, he was named one of the Wisden&#x27;s five Cricketers of the Year. He was also named as captain and wicket-keeper of the 2011 World Test XI by the ICC and named in the 2012 World Test XI and ODI XI.

In 2012, Sangakkara received the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy having been elected ICC Cricketer of the Year. For his achievements in 2011, he was one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 2012 edition of &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;. In the same edition, he was named the 2011 Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World and he won this award again in the 2015 edition for his achievements in 2014, the first player to win the award twice (subsequently, Virat Kohli and Ben Stokes have won it three times each).

Sangakkara struggled with his form when England toured Sri Lanka in 2012. He failed to score a half century during The Two Test match series. But he regained his form in the ODI series against Pakistan where his batting score reached the 90s. In the Test series that followed, Sangakkara continued his form with a 199, the scoreboard originally said he had scored the double century but it turned out to be a mistake. Sri Lanka later won the Test match. He followed this up with 192 in the same game, again missing out on the double century. The next two matches were drawn, which meant Sri Lanka won the series 1–0. This was their first time winning a Test series since the retirement of Muttiah Muralitharan.

On the Sri Lankan tour of Bangladesh in 2014, Sangakkara hit his highest test score to date with 319 in the first innings of the second test. Making him only the third Sri Lankan player to hit a triple century after Sanath Jayasuriya and Mahela Jayawardene. He followed his triple century with a knock of 105 in the 2nd innings and the game finished as a draw. He continued his good batting run with another century in the 2nd ODI.

Along with teammate Mahela Jayawardene, he recorded the most partnership runs for the 3rd wicket in Test history, scoring 5890 runs surpassing the 5826 runs of Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, during the first Test match against Pakistan at Galle International Stadium. The two also hold the record for the highest partnership for any wicket in Test matches, scoring 624 runs for the 3rd wicket against South Africa in July 2006. This still stands as the largest partnership for any wicket in first-class cricket, anywhere.

His impressive form with the bat continued at the 2014 Asia Cup where he amassed a total of 245 runs in five innings. He started the tournament with a 63 against Pakistan before hitting a match winning 103 against India. He then added scores of 77 and 2 against Afghanistan and Bangladesh before being dismissed for a golden duck in the final against Pakistan. Sri Lanka went on to win the game and the tournament.

===Bangladesh Premier League===
In 2015, he was signed by Dhaka Dynamites for the 2015–16 Bangladesh Premier League. He was the leading run scorer of that season, scoring 349 runs in 10 matches. He was retained by Dhaka Dynamites for the 2016–17 Bangladesh Premier League.

===Pakistan Super League===
In 2015, Sangakkara joined the Quetta Gladiators of the Pakistan Super League. He was later released by the franchise and was picked by Karachi Kings as captain for the 2017 edition. Under his captaincy team reached play-offs. The following year, in the 3rd edition of PSL, Sangakkara was picked by Multan Sultans.

===Return to county cricket===
Before Sri Lanka&#x27;s Test series against England in 2014, Sangakkara returned to county cricket, playing two matches for Durham, which included 159 against Sussex in his final innings. On 16 January 2015, it was announced that he would be joining Surrey on a two-year contract. Sangakkara scored a brilliant century against Glamorgan, where he scored 149 runs, which was his maiden century for Surrey in this county season. After the match, he said that he was willing to see the comeback of English batsman Kevin Pietersen to international cricket.

Sangakkara represented Surrey from 2015 till 2017, helping them win Division Two of LV= 2015 County Championship and gaining promotion to Division One for the Specsavers 2016 County Championship season. Surrey also reached the finals of 2015 Royal London One-Day Cup before losing by six runs to Gloucestershire.

===Final season (2017)===

On 22 May 2017, Sangakkara announced that the following season would be his last in first-class cricket. He made the announcement after scoring four consecutive centuries becoming the fourth Surrey batsman to achieve this feat (Ian Ward was the last to do it in 2002), pass 20,000 first-class and having scored 592 runs in the said four games. He scored the fifth consecutive century on 26 May against Essex at the County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford. becoming only the eighth player to achieve this feat. In the quarter-final of the Royal London One-Day Cup against Yorkshire, he scored 121 from as many balls, which became his 100th century in all formats of the game combined, that now included 61 in first-class and 39 in List A games. Sangakkara became the first batsman to reach 1,000 runs for the season when he brought up his sixth century for the season against Yorkshire.

===MCC===
On the 2020 MCC tour of Pakistan, with all matches played in Lahore, Sangakkara played in all matches, registering 25 runs in the first T20 match with 1 catch behind the stumps, 3 runs in the only LA game (where he did not keep wicket), 1 catch behind the stumps and 10 with the bat in the second T20, and 52 and 1 catch keeping wicket in the third and tour-ending T20, giving him a total of 3 dismissals credited to his name and 90 runs in total on the tour, giving him a T20 average of 30 and a tour average of 22.5.

===Cricket All-Stars Series===
Sangakkara, though retired from international cricket, participated in the 2015 Cricket All-Stars Series for Warne&#x27;s Warriors under Shane Warne&#x27;s captaincy. In the three T20 matches, he scored 153 runs, more than any other cricketer in the series, and included one fifty. His average in the series was 51.00. He also hit the most fours and sixes, 12 apiece. For his overall performance, Sangakkara was judged player of the series.

===Masters Champions League===
Sangakkara also played for Gemini Arabians in the first edition of Masters Champions League T20 tournament which took place in the UAE. In the first match against Gemini and Libra Legends, Sangakkara scored 86 runs from just 43 balls and helped the team post a huge total of 234 runs in their allotted 20 overs. Libra Legends only scored 156 in their 20 overs and thus Gemini Arabians won the match courtesy of Sangakkara&#x27;s knock. Sangakkara was also awarded man of the match. Sangakkara scored four consecutive fifties (65, 51, 51, 62) in the other matches played during the series, this secured a place in the final for the Arabians. In the final against Leo Lions, he scored 30 runs to become top run scorer of the series. His team won the series and remained undefeated throughout the tournament. Sangakkara won player of the series for his 386 runs with 5 fifties.

===2014 ICC World Twenty20===
Sangakkara won the Man of the Match award in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 Final and was part of the Sri Lankan team who won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. He decided to retire from T20 internationals after playing in that tournament and, afterwards, Jayawardene followed him into retirement. Sangakkara under-performed in the World T20 until, in the final against India, he scored 51 not out off 33 balls and help his team win their second ICC trophy since 1996.

===Later international matches===
Sri Lanka played their first 7-match ODI series at home, against England, from 26 November to 16 December 2014. On 3 December 2014 Sangakkara reached 13,000 runs in One-day internationals in the third match of the series at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium, Hambantota, and became the fourth player in One-day history to achieve the feat after Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting, and Sanath Jayasuriya. He also became the second most prolific half-century maker in One-day internationals during this match. He scored 4 consecutive half-centuries followed by a century. On 13 December 2014, he scored his 20th ODI century, becoming the second Sri Lankan to score 20 ODI centuries, after 28 by Sanath Jayasuriya, and 9th overall to do so. He also took 4 catches as a wicket-keeper in this match taking the player of the match award. This match was his last match in his hometown due to his retirement from the ODI arena after the 2015 Cricket World Cup.

On 26 February 2015 in the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against Bangladesh, Sangakkara scored his 22nd ODI century in his 400th appearance in One-Day Internationals. The 210* second wicket partnership between Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan on that day was broken again on 1 March 2015, in the next group match in World Cup against England, where Sangakkara joined Lahiru Thirimanne with 212* for the second wicket.

He scored 124 runs in the next match against Scotland, becoming first batsman in World Cup history to score 4 consecutive hundreds.

Sangakkara&#x27;s last ODI innings were disappointing from him and his teams&#x27; point of view, where Sri Lanka lost the quarter-final against South Africa on 18 March 2015. He only scored 45 runs, it was Sri Lanka&#x27;s first World Cup defeat in a quarter final after 1999. His teammate Mahela also retired from ODI career with this match. He was named in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; for the 2015 World Cup by the ICC.

As a batter, Sangakkara tended to play off his front foot, using the cover drive as one of his regular scoring shots. He also liked to hit the ball square of the stumps on the offside, using the cut shot. The pull to leg or onside was another natural stroke for him.

===Wicket-keeping===
As a wicket-keeper, Sangakkara was noted for his energy and athleticism.

===Approach to controversy===
Sangakkara is noted for his willingness to speak openly about controversial topics and he was chosen by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to deliver the 2011 Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture at Lord&#x27;s. He was both the youngest person and the first active international player to do so. His speech was widely praised by the cricketing community which welcomed Sangakkara&#x27;s frank statements and outspoken style.

The one-hour-long speech focused on corruption within cricket administration in Sri Lanka. Sangakkara said:
He observed that the problems had arisen only after Sri Lanka&#x27;s 1996 Cricket World Cup victory and blamed &quot;a handful of well-meaning individuals&quot; who control the game, wasting the finances and resources of Sri Lanka Cricket. Immediately after the lecture, the Sri Lankan sports minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage ordered an investigation into Sangakkara&#x27;s allegations. Despite critical comments by officials in the Sri Lankan government, it has been described as &quot;the most important speech in cricket history.&quot;

One of cricket&#x27;s most controversial issues is so-called &quot;sledging&quot; and Sangakkara has won some admiration for being willing to talk about it openly. In an interview in 2004 he explained his approach to it:
===Tributes===
When Sangakkara retired from international cricket, he received praise from many sources which confirmed his popularity in the sport and underlined the respect his fellow professionals have always held for him. India&#x27;s captain Virat Kohli, for example, spoke of Sangakkara as &quot;a lovely human being&quot; who had been &quot;a wonderful player for Sri Lanka&quot; and someone whom &quot;a lot of left-handers really look up to, for the way he plays&quot;. Kohli emphasised: &quot;His technique and the way he has scored runs all over the world, his numbers speak for themselves&quot;. Angelo Mathews, Sri Lanka&#x27;s captain at the time, said Sangakkara was &quot;the &#x27;backbone&#x27; of their team&quot;. Cricket Australia said that, his batting feats aside, Sangakkara &quot;holds a reputation as one of the game&#x27;s true gentlemen&quot;.

Matches between Nalanda College, Colombo, and Trinity College, Kandy, have been part of Sri Lanka&#x27;s schools cricket calendar since 1978. Mahela Jayawardene was a student of the former and Kumar Sangakkara of the latter. In January 2019, the colleges created the Mahela-Sanga Challenge Trophy as the prize for their future matches against each other. The trophy is dedicated to &quot;two cricketing gentlemen who have shown their willingness to contribute to society on countless occasions&quot;.

==Post-retirement==
===Committee work for Sri Lanka Cricket===
Sangakkara joined Sri Lanka&#x27;s international selection committee on 7 March 2016, working with chairman Aravinda de Silva and fellow selectors Romesh Kaluwitharana, Ranjith Madurasinghe, and Lalith Kaluperuma. In 2021, Sangakkara was appointed to Sri Lanka Cricket&#x27;s four-man technical advisory committee panel, again working with de Silva; the other two members were Muttiah Muralitharan and Roshan Mahanama.

===Broadcasting===
Sangakkara has worked for Sky Sports since 2018 as a cricket commentatator. He has received much praise for the analytical aspect of his comments, which have been described as insightful.

===MCC President===
In January 2019, Sangakkara accepted an invitation from the incumbent President of Marylebone Cricket Club, Anthony Wreford, to be his successor. The decision was announced on 1 May 2019, at which time Sangakkara became the President-Designate. His one-year term began on 1 October 2019 and Sangakkara was the first non-British MCC President since the club was founded in 1787. He described MCC as &quot;the greatest cricket club in the world&quot; and said being named as its president was a &quot;huge honour&quot;. He had been awarded honorary life membership of MCC in 2012 and had joined its World Cricket Committee the same year. He was succeeded by Clare Connor, who became MCC&#x27;s first female president.

===Coaching===

Sangakkara is the current coach of Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, having been appointed in January 2021. Under his direction, the Royals reached the 2022 IPL Final but lost by 7 wickets to Gujarat Titans. In IPL 2023, Royals finished fifth in the points table.

===ICC Hall of Fame===
In June 2021, Sangakkara was elected to the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame, the second Sri Lankan player after Muttiah Muralitharan to receive the honour.

==Personal life==
Sangakkara met his wife, Yehali, when they were at school together; they have twin children who were born in 2009 soon after he assumed the Sri Lanka captaincy. Yehali has accompanied him on tour including nearly two months in the West Indies for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, in which Sri Lanka were the runners-up. In December 2011, Sangakkara collaborated with Mahela Jayawardene and veteran chef Dharshan Munidasa to open the &quot;Ministry of Crab&quot; which has developed into one of Colombo&#x27;s most successful restaurants.

Sangakkara is a devout buddhist. He is involved with Sri Lankan charities, mainly those which help children. He is a member of the &quot;Think Wise Initiative&quot;, which was launched by the ICC in co-operation with UNICEF and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. It is aimed at raising awareness of HIV prevention and eliminating discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS. Sangakkara is also a partner in the &quot;Foundation of Goodness&quot;, a children&#x27;s charity launched by Muttiah Muralitharan in Galle.

On 19 August 2015, just after the 2015 Sri Lankan parliamentary election, President Maithripala Sirisena appointed Sangakkara as Ambassador of Anti-narcotics, a program which aims to promote awareness of and reduce dependency on dangerous drugs.

<text>Thilan Thusara Samaraweera (; born 22 September 1976) is a former Sri Lankan international cricketer. Samaraweera played international cricket for Sri Lanka. Known as Sri Lanka&#x27;s crisis man and for his slow strike rate, He is also nicknamed “Bullet Samaraweera&quot; following his wounding during the 2009 terror attack on his national team bus in Pakistan. He retired after over 80 matches with a batting average over 48 in Test cricket. He was a part of the Sri Lankan squad which finished as runners-up at the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

==Personal life==

Thilan Samaraweera born in Colombo and had his education at Ananda College, Colombo. He is married to Erandathie Samaraweera and has two daughters: Osuni and Sidhya. His brother, Dulip Samaraweera, also played Test cricket, appearing in seven Tests from 1993 to 1995. His brother-in-law Bathiya Perera has represented Sri Lanka A.

== Early career ==
Thilan played school cricket for Ananda College and emerged as a prolific batsman in inter-school competitions. He initially was a frontline spinner at school level. He spearheaded the bowling attack of Ananda capturing 72 wickets in 1984 and 64 wickets in 1985 season. He amassed 1000 runs in 1994 and 1995 seasons. He won the Sri Lankan Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 1994 and 1995.

== Domestic career ==
He was drafted to the Kandurata Warriors side ahead of the inaugural edition of the Sri Lanka Premier League in 2012. He signed with Worcestershire County Cricket Club for the 2013 County Championship.

==International career==

Samaraweera managed a handful of ODI games in 1998 but did not play Test cricket until August 2001. He made his ODI debut against India on 6 November 1998 but he was not given the opportunity to bat in the middle order on his ODI debut as he was listed as no 10 batsman. In his next 2 ODI appearances, he batted at no 8 and in his fourth ODI match he batted as a tailender at no 11 position.

Having worked on his batting considerably with his shadow coach Chandika Hathurusingha he got due reward by scoring century on debut against a strong Indian side helping Sri Lanka to win the series 2–1. He continued to star with the bat by scoring another two centuries in his next five Tests, all on his home ground, the SSC in Colombo. This stunning start to international cricket cemented his spot in the middle order, a spot which had holes to fill with the retirements of Aravinda de Silva and Hashan Tillakaratne. He emerged as a frontline batsman in international arena at a time when many Sri Lankan batsmen were nearing the end of their prime. However, he was in and out of Sri Lankan limited overs team as he made a comeback return to the ODI side in 2005 after two years.

His off-spin has been rarely called upon by his captain but when he comes on he has earned a reputation as a partnership breaker. After a poor Test series in England in which he failed to reach double figures in any of his four innings, he was dropped from the side. He was made captain of Sri Lanka A before earning a recall for the first Test against Australia in Brisbane. He scored 13 and 20 and was promptly dropped when Kumar Sangakkara returned to the side for the second game in Hobart. This was followed by his non-inclusion in the squad to play England in the first Test in Kandy.

Samaraweera was included in the Sri Lankan team to play the Test series in Pakistan in February – March 2009. This series was conducted after the Indian team withdrew from a scheduled series in Pakistan, following the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Samaraweera started off the series in superb form, hitting consecutive double centuries – 231 in the first Test in Karachi and 214 in the second Test in Lahore. He too has the record for the highest individual score for Sri Lanka when batting at number 5 position in tests when he scored 231 against Pakistan. Also, Thilan Samaraweera was the first ever Sri Lankan to score a test century at number 8 position and holds the record for the highest score for Sri Lanka jointly with Kithuruwan Vithanage at number 8 position in tests (103*) During the test tour of Pakistan in 2009, he was highlighted for his machine gun celebration after scoring a century and it was considered as a quite new celebration by a player in international cricket at that time although he did it on numerous occasions in domestic circuit.

In February 2009, he shared a record-breaking partnership of 437 with Mahela Jayawardene. This is a world record for 4th wicket in Test cricket. The previous Test record was held by an English pair—Peter May and Colin Cowdrey—who put on 411 against West Indies at Birmingham in May 1957. The record stood for 6 years until surpassed on 11 December 2015 by two Aussies Adam Voges and Shaun Marsh with 449 for fourth wicket against West Indies. He ended the 2009 season on a high note with 1234 runs in 11 test matches at an average of 72.58.

In September 2009, he scored his maiden ODI century against New Zealand national cricket team at R. Premadasa Stadium, Colombo, almost eleven years after his ODI debut. He scored his next ODI century against India during a 50 over Tri-nation series in Bangladesh in 2010. He was often criticised of being a backyard bully mostly piling up runs in subcontinent amassing 4275 runs in 60 tests in Asia at an average of 54.11 and his record outside Asia was pity average scoring 1187 runs at an average of 35.96 in 21 tests. After being a victim of Lahore attack in 2009, he returned to competitive cricket and initially struggled to deliver on his comeback return.

In 2011, after poor form with the bat during a home series against Australia, he was dropped from Sri Lanka&#x27;s team for the series against Pakistan. He was also left out of the squad to tour South Africa, but was given a late call-up to cover for Mahela Jayawardene due to a knee injury. He scored two centuries in the three-Test series, and moved into the top ten of the ICC Player Rankings for Test batsmen for the first time in his career.

He was selected to the Sri Lankan team for the 2011 Cricket World Cup which was also his first and only World Cup appearance. He also appeared in the final of the 2011 Cricket World Cup and he played a crucial role by adding 57 runs for the fourth wicket with Mahela Jayawardene.

Samaraweera holds the record for scoring the most runs in ODI cricket with only scoring centuries without even dismissed between 50 and 99, he never had scores of unbeaten innings between 50 and 99. He has scored 2 ODI hundreds without a single ODI fifty. He also ended his ODI career without hitting a six despite two centuries to his name.

In March 2013, he announced his retirement from international cricket after being overlooked for a home Test series against Bangladesh.

==Lahore attack==

Samaraweera, along with five teammates, was injured in the 3 March 2009 attack on the bus that carried the Sri Lankan team to the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Pakistan. He was hospitalised with a thigh injury. Samaraweera was the most seriously injured player amongst them. Thilan suffered a major injury on his left thigh as a bullet fired by a terrorist pierced through his knee well inside his body by 12 inches. Six policemen that guarded the bus and two civilians were killed in the attack. He then underwent surgery, remained at hospital for two weeks and took brief break from cricket for roughly 4 months. The doctors advised him that he may not ever play cricket again but he soon overcame the obstacles and mental trauma following the attack. He also revealed that he was still haunted by the 2009 Lahore terrorist attack. He returned to cricket in June 2009 following his surgery. He was believed to have undergone 2 and half hours operation at the Nawaloka Hospital in Colombo and fears were also raised that he could be forced to retire from international cricket.

==Coaching career==
He became the batting consultant for Bangladesh in September 2016 ahead of the Bangladesh&#x27;s home Test series against England. He was employed by Cricket Australia as a consultant coach for Australian team for the test tour of Sri Lanka. He served as batting consultant for Bangladesh until the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy and BCB did not extend the contract after the Champions Trophy.

In November 2017, he was named as Sri Lanka&#x27;s batting coach till 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup. However, he stepped down from the role of Sri Lanka&#x27;s batting coach in 2018 following the end of Sri Lanka&#x27;s test series in New Zealand. During the New Zealand tour around 2018, he was known for serving as a personal mentor to Kusal Mendis and Thilan made sure that Kusal Mendis was not dropped for the test match at Wellington.

He was appointed as the fielding coach of the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2018 for the Indian Premier League. In 2019, he was roped in by New Zealand Cricket to work with New Zealand cricket team for the test tour of Sri Lanka.

In August 2021, he was included in New Zealand&#x27;s coaching staff for the New Zealand cricket team&#x27;s tour of Bangladesh and Pakistan.

<text>Najah Salah Ali (born c. 1980) is an Iraqi professional boxer, who was the only Iraqi boxer to qualify for the 2004 Athens, Greece Olympics.

==Career==
Ali became interested in boxing as a young child, but most boxing gyms in Iraq at the time were generally in bad shape, making it hard for him and his fellow young boxers to train.

Najah Ali grew during the Saddam Hussein era. He claims to have heard from other athletes about tortures committed against them by Hussein and his son Uday, but he himself was never hurt by them.

In 2002, Najah Ali won the Asian amateur boxing championship.

===Olympics===
After the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003, Ali met with Maurice Watkins, a former professional world title challenger who had been assigned by the American government to train Iraq&#x27;s Olympic boxing team.

Ali and eight other Olympic hopefuls were put on a strong training regime by Watkins. Despite losing in qualifying competitions at different countries, Ali became the only Iraqi to qualify for the 2004 Olympic Games, earning a wild-card spot because of his sportsmanship, among other things.

After securing their Olympic spot, Ali and Watkins moved to New York, where they began to train at the legendary Gleason&#x27;s Gym. Their story was subsequently shown at many United States outlets, including CNN.

Ali hoped to become Iraq&#x27;s first Olympic boxing medalist, the second one overall, and the first Iraqi to earn a medal since a wrestler earned a bronze medal at the 1960 Rome Olympics. He competed in the light flyweight weight class (the lightest, for all boxers under 48 kilograms), winning his first bout vs a North Korean by a healthy margin of 21–7. In the second round, however, he was defeated by Aleksan Nalbandyan.

===After Athens===
Ali, who earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science at Alrafdean University, applied to the University of Houston to continue his studies. He was accepted by the university, but has been denied a student visa four times by the United States Department of State.

At the Asian Games 2006 he lost his first match 21:30 to eventual runner-up Suban Pannon.

<doc id="894379" wikidata="Q3630864" url="?curid=894379" title="A3 motorway (Switzerland)">
<text>The A3 is a motorway in northeast Switzerland, running diagonally from France toward the southeast border, and passing by Zürich on the way. The total length of the A3 motorway spans roughly , but parts of the road share sections of the A1 and A2 motorways.

The A3 belongs to the Swiss motorway network. It starts at the border in Basel, where it connects to French motorway A35. From the Wiese Motorway Fork, the route is shared with the A2.

At Augst, the motorway splits, with the A2 branching off and the A3 continuing past Rheinfelden and Frick. After the Bözberg tunnel is the Birrfeld Motorway Fork, near Birmenstorf. Here, the A1 and A3 share the same route as far as Motorway Interchange Limmattal, where the A3 goes towards Urdorf and the Uetliberg Tunnel which was opened on May 4, 2009. After Zürich the motorway weaves through the hills of the south-east bank of Lake Zürich. It continues along the Walensee (Walen Lake), and on to Mels where it ends at a junction with the A13.

The A3 represents (together with a section of the A1) the most important connection between Basel and Zürich, and (together with a section of the A13) the most important connection Zürich–Chur.

== Sections ==
=== Weesen-Murg ===
A special feature is the highway section at Lake Walen. Between Weesen and Murg in 1964, the N3 center was opened as a main road and led by the six tunnels: &quot;Ofenegg&quot; (), &quot;Weisswand&quot; (), &quot;Standenhorn&quot; (), &quot;Glattwand&quot; (), &quot;Mühlehorn&quot; (), and &quot;Stutz&quot; ().

The highway section has been extended since 1986 with the opening of the Kerenzerberg Tunnel (), which handles the road to Murg / Sargans. The old six tunnels and the road on the shores of Lake Walen were converted to unidirectional operation and now form the carriageway to Weesen / Zürich.

=== Zürich Western Bypass ===
Since May 4, 2009, with the opening of the highway section between the port Birmensdorf and Zürich, the branch &quot;South&quot;- the last section of the so-called &quot;Western Bypass&quot; - the A3 motorway is continuous between Basel and Sargans.

With the opening to traffic of the new section on May 4, two existing sections of highway have been renumbered. The leader in the city of Zürich Autobahnast Limmattal - Hardturm (always officially recorded as N1) is now known as A1 (Switzerland) or A1H (Shuttle Hardturm) rather than A3. The leading out of town Autobahnast Wiedikon - Zürich south, the so-called Sihlhochstrasse is referred to as the new A3W (feeder Wiedikon).

Also initiated, with the opening of the Western Bypass, the first stage of the flanking measures pass the residential areas along the former &quot;West tangent&quot; in the city of Zürich. The existing road trains, which were used for urban transit highway connection endpoints and Wiedikon Hardturm, were temporarily contracted on May 2, each for one traffic lane in each direction. In the following months until the summer of 2010, dismantling will continue of the &quot;temporary&quot; transit routes to district roads (West Street and Sihlfeldstrasse) and urban main roads (Seebahnstrasse und Schimmelstrasse)). In addition to various structural measures that are placed on the axis of incidence via Wollishofen and Albisrieden, additional traffic lights are used to regulate traffic flow in the metering equipment and make the side-traffic into the residential neighborhoods unattractive.

<text>Demuni Nuwan Tharanga Zoysa (born 13 May 1978), or Nuwan Zoysa, is a former Sri Lankan cricketer. He was a tall left-arm seam bowler, who played 30 Tests and 95 One Day Internationals (ODIs) for Sri Lanka. Nuwan was educated at Isipathana College, Colombo.

In his eighth Test, Zoysa became the first player in history to take a hat-trick off his first three balls of a Test match. He achieved this against Zimbabwe at Harare in November 1999, dismissing Trevor Gripper, Murray Goodwin and Neil Johnson.

==International career==
Zoysa made his first-class debut in 1996/97 and during his first season he took his career best figures of 7 for 58, playing for Sinhalese Sports Club. He made his Test debut soon after in Dunedin against New Zealand. He took over 100 ODI wickets for Sri Lanka, becoming the eighth to have achieved the milestone in the 2004 Champions Trophy.

An aggressive lower order batsman, Zoysa once won an ODI against Australia with an unbeaten 47, his highest ODI score. Zoysa&#x27;s peak in international cricket came during the 2004 season when he took his best Test and ODI figures and only five-wicket hauls. In May, he took 5 for 20 against Zimbabwe in the first Test at Harare and in August he claimed 5 for 26 in a ODI against South Africa in Colombo.

==Domestic career==
He made his Twenty20 debut on 17 August 2004, for Sinhalese Sports Club in the 2004 SLC Twenty20 Tournament. He was also bought by the Deccan Chargers Franchise in the IPL but he was removed from the team for his poor performances.

==Coaching==
Nuwan Zoysa was appointed to the National Fast Bowling Coaching Department of Sri Lanka Cricket on 1 October 2015 prior to which he has worked in India with Goa Cricket Association and with Royal College &amp; Nondiscripts as Fast Bowling Coach before joining SLC.

In October 2018, he was charged by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for three breaches of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code. In November 2020, he was found guilty of three offences, and in April 2021, he was handed a six-year ban, backdated to 31 October 2018.

<text>Tillakaratne Mudiyanselage Dilshan (; born 14 October 1976), commonly known as TM Dilshan () is a former Sri Lankan cricketer and former captain of the Sri Lanka national cricket team. He is often regarded as the best rated Sri Lankan player in run-chases in ODI history and one of the most innovative players of all time. He was the top run scorer in the 2011 Cricket World Cup with 500 runs, and scored a century against England in the quarter-final. Dilshan is considered to be a rare example of a cricketer with notable skills in all aspects of the game, who can bat, bowl, field and keep wicket. He is an aggressive right-hand batsman who invented the scoop, which has come to be known as the Dilscoop, a shot that hits the ball over the keeper. Apart from being an opening batsman, he is also a capable off-break bowler. Energetic in the field, he usually fielded at the point region. He was part of the Sri Lankan team that won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20.

Dilshan made his Test and ODI debut during the Sri Lankan cricket team&#x27;s tour to Zimbabwe in 1999. He is also the second cap for Sri Lanka in Twenty20 Internationals. He is the first cricketer in the history of the game to score hundreds in all formats as a captain.

Dilshan won the Twenty20 International Performance of the Year award at the 2009 ICC Awards for his 96 off 57 ball shots against West Indies in the semi-final of the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England. He also won the man of the series trophy for his individual batting performances in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 tournament. He was also a key member of the team that won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and was part of the team that made the finals of 2007 Cricket World Cup, 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and 2012 ICC World Twenty20.

He is the fourth Sri Lankan, and eleventh player overall to score 10,000 ODI runs. Being the third overall and first Sri Lankan to score 1,500 runs in Twenty20 Internationals, he is also the first player to hit 200 fours in T20Is. Dilshan scored 1000 or more ODI runs in a calendar year four times and never failed to amass fewer than 800 runs in any calendar year between 2009 and 2015. His innings of 104 not out is currently the highest individual T20 score made by a Sri Lankan in the format.

Dilshan was under-estimated in the cricket world as an ordinary player when he batted at number 6 and 7, unlike his revered teammates Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara. When he gained the opening batting position, Dilshan became one of the finest cricketers in the world and a legend in modern cricketing history. His quick progression can be seen in his stats: after he moved to the opening position, he scored 21 ODI centuries and all his Test and T20I centuries.

In August 2016, Dilshan announced that he would retire from both ODI and T20I cricket at the end of the series against Australia. He retired from ODI cricket on 28 August 2016 and from T20I cricket on 9 September 2016.

He was educated at Jaffna Sinhala Madya Maha Vidyalaya in Jaffna for primary education, and then at the Kalutara Vidyalaya, where he started his cricket career as a teenager. However, his family did not want him to play cricket, so his only goal was to get ahead in sports.

His childhood coach Ranjan Paranavitana stated that even though Dilshan had a Muslim name, he and his siblings followed their mother&#x27;s religion during their childhood and officially changed his religion and name after his parents separated.

Dilshan was married to Nilanka Vithanage, with whom he has a son called Resadu Tillakaratne. After divorcing Dilshan, Nilanka filed a lawsuit over child alimony.

The case was later settled with Dilshan to pay about 200,000 LKR each month for his ex-wife and his son.

The court case was opened again in 2017, after Dilshan had failed to pay some of the monthly fees. On 24 April 2017, Colombo Magistrate Courts issued an arrest warrant to Dilshan due to his absence in the Court. However, Dilshan finally appeared on court on 25 April 2017.

Dilshan real talent came through in their match against India on 15 December 2009, where Sri Lanka nearly chased a mammoth target of 414 posted by India. The pitch at Rajkot was perfect to bat on, Dilshan started the run chase with Tharanga, instead of Jayasuriya. In a blistering knock he reached fifty off 38 balls and then scored hundred off 73 balls. His 150 runs came off 115 balls with Sri Lanka on the brink of a sensational win. His score of 160 was full of hooks, pulls and many scoops of his variety, leading the way to victory. But after Dilshan fell when bowled by Harbhajan Singh, the match opened for the Indian team. They took all the advantages and Sri Lanka were bowled out for 411 runs, losing by only 3 runs.

==Later career==
Dilshan played almost all his international matches as a middle-order all-round batsman during his early years. However, by 2007, he was selected to open the batting with Sanath Jayasuriya in ODI game against India, where he started to showcase himself as an attacking and threatening opening batsman. Since 2007, his strokeplay has included a host of aggressive strokes which has allowed him to dominate the ODI arena on many occasions. Until retirement, he slotted as the permanent opening batsman for Sri Lanka, as well as operating as a handy right-arm off-break bowler in both ODI and T20I matches.

Dilshan is credited for the creation of the Dilscoop, which he stumbled upon and then perfected, during the Indian Premier League 2009 tournament. His innovative stroke play is acknowledged by many commentators and pundits thereby earning the recognition of being known as one of the most aggressive batsmen of all time.

===Captaincy===

Dilshan said after his retirement in ODIs that, he did not want to take the captaincy, but Sri Lanka Cricket asked him to take the captaincy for six months until they found someone suitable. He accepted the task, but the many troubles in the team such as retirements and injuries led him to reduce performances.

However, his appointment as captain was questioned by cricket fans and pundits alike. Many wondered if he was the right man to lead Sri Lanka. Dilshan scored 193 runs against England at Lord&#x27;s, breaking the record for the highest individual score made by a Sri Lankan at the venue, and lead Sri Lanka to their maiden test win in South Africa. Losses to England, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa put strain on his captaincy, however, which he relinquished in January 2012.

He also said that he had a lack of support during captaincy tenure and help from former captains and coaches for the team. During Dilshan&#x27;s captaincy, four coaches were introduced, but none succeeded.

Dilshan became the 5th player in international cricket to score centuries in all forms of the game. During the Australian tour of Sri Lanka in 2011, Dilshan scored an unbeaten century of 104* from just 54 balls in the first Twenty20 match of the series, becoming the 5th player to achieve the milestone after West Indian Chris Gayle, New Zealander Brendon McCullum, Indian Suresh Raina and fellow Sri Lankan Mahela Jayawardena and it is also the highest individual twenty20 international score by a Sri Lankan in the history.

In December 2011, Sri Lanka registered their first ever Test win in South Africa. This also became their first Test win under Dilshan&#x27;s captaincy. However, after losing the Test series 2–1 and the subsequent ODI series 3–2, Dilshan resigned and was replaced by Mahela Jayawardene. In 2012, he was ranked the second-highest ODI run scorer, with 1119 runs, behind his teammate Kumar Sangakkara. For his performances in 2012, he was named in the ODI XI of the year by ESPNcricinfo.

<text>Deshabandu Romesh Shantha Kaluwitharana (; born 24 November 1969) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who represented the Sri Lanka national cricket team from 1990 to 2004. He was a key member and wicket-keeper for 1996 Cricket World Cup winning team and renowned for his aggressive batting style.

Kaluwitharana along with Sanath Jayasuriya, are credited for having revolutionized one-day international cricket with explosive batting in the mid-1990s, which initiated the hard-hitting modern-day batting strategy of all nations. He made his Twenty20 debut on 17 August 2004, for Colts Cricket Club in the 2004 SLC Twenty20 Tournament. He was appointed as the interim cricket coach of Malaysia on the 17 May 2008. He was educated at St. Sebastian&#x27;s College, Moratuwa.

==International career==
===ODI Career===
Kaluwitharana made his ODI debut against India at Margao in December 1990, but was not required to bat as Sri Lanka won by 7 wickets. He played his next ODI against New Zealand at Dunedin in February 1991, in which he opened the batting for Sri Lanka. Thereafter he batted in the middle order (mostly, in the late middle order) until the 1995–96 World Series in Australia.

He relished pace and would often be quick to put away any delivery off line or length. His greatest contribution to ODIs came after he was promoted to the top of the batting order to partner opener Sanath Jayasuriya during the 1995–96 Australian Tri-Series, helping to give birth to an aggressive batting approach in the first fifteen overs of fielding restrictions. This new strategy of aggressive batting from the outset heavily contributed to Sri Lanka to win all their matches and secure the 1996 Cricket World Cup later as all other teams were not prepared for such an attack. 

During the Australian Tri-Series, Kaluwitharana finally scored his maiden ODI half century after 34 innings. On 9 January 1996 against Australia in Melbourne, he scored match winning 77 runs during the chase of 214 and won the man of the match award. During the series, he then scored another fifty against the West Indies, where Sri Lanka posted 202 in 50 overs. He later involved with one catch and a stumping, and Sri Lanka won the match by 16 runs. This batting and wicket keeping display gave him another man of the match award. In the next match of the tri-series, he scored another master class innings against Australia. Australia batted first and scored 242/4 in 50 overs courtesy of Steve Waugh&#x27;s unbeaten century. In reply, Sri Lanka scored 246/7 within 49.4 overs, where Kaluwitharana top scored with 74 runs, particularly hammered Glenn McGrath, who achieved the worst figures by any Australian at this level in ODIs with one for 76. With that win, Sri Lanka qualified for the finals and Kaluwitharana won third consecutive man of the match award. However, in the two finals against Australia, he was dismissed for 13 and 0, where Sri Lanka lost both of them.

After the tri-series, Sri Lanka played 1996 Cricket World Cup, where Kaluwitharana was the wicket keeper and opened with Jayasuriya in that world cup that was captained by Arjuna Ranatunga. During the series, Kaluwitharana did not score heavily, but made brief onslaughts with Jayasuriya, who later became the player of the series. In the first, semi final against India, Kaluwitharana made match winning stumping to dismiss Sachin Tendulkar and turned the table towards Sri Lanka. After the crowd threw bottles at the deep fielders, Sri Lanka won by default and reached their first World Cup final. Sri Lanka won all the matches in the World Cup and eventually became the champions. 

On 28 August 1996 against India in the 1996 Singer World Series, Jayasuriya and Kaluwitharana made 129 runs for the first wicket, where he scored 53 runs and Jayasuriya scored a match winning unbeaten century. Eventually, Sri Lanka won by 9 wickets with 34 balls remaining. On 7 September 1996 against Australia in the final of the tournament, he scored 58 runs made a solid partnership with Asanka Gurusinha. Sri Lanka posted 234/3 in the innings with the fifties of Kaluwitharana and Aravinda de Silva. Australia were bowled out for 184 and Sri Lanka won the tournament by 50 runs.

In the first match of Sameer Cup 1996–97, also known as Kenya Cricket Association Centenary Tournament, Kaluwitharana scored his maiden ODI century. Kenya batted first and scored only 188/9, where Muttiah Muralitharan took four wickets. In the chase, Sri Lanka achieve the target within 30.4 overs, courtesy of Kaluwitharana&#x27;s unbeaten century off 89 balls with 17 fours and 1 six with a strike rate of 112.35.

After several single digit scores in opening slot, he was demoted to number 7 position. On 20 May 1997, in the 1997 Pepsi Independence Cup, Kaluwitharana won the man of the match award for scoring 44 runs and involved in 2 catches and 2 stumpings against New Zealand. After that, he again went through a lean patch of runs and his highest score in the next 11 innings was 30 runs. During that period, he was dismissed for single digit scores for 8 times. In the 2nd ODI against India on 25 December 1997, he was recalled for the opening slot with Jayasuriya. After the third over, match was called off due to the dangerous pitch.

Then on 7 April 1998 against Pakistan at Kimberley in the 1997–98 Standard Bank International One-Day Series, he scored 54 runs without boundaries and made 107-run partnership with Jayasuriya. Even though Sri Lanka posted a total of 295/7, Pakistan reached the target easily with Inzamam-ul-Haq&#x27;s unbeaten century. His next ODI fifty came on 5 July 1998 against New Zealand in 1998 Nidahas Trophy, where he scored 54 runs with 8 fours. In the 1998 Emirates Triangular Tournament, Kaluwitharana scored another fifty. England batted first and scored 256/8 in their 50 overs. After Jayasuriya was dismissed in the first over, Kaluwitharana along with Marvan Atapattu made 138-run partnership for the second wicket. He was got out for 68 runs in 27th over, but laid the foundation for the win, where Atapattu later made an unbeaten century. With this win, Sri Lanka won their fifth multilateral one-day tournament since their World Cup triumph. 

Against New Zealand on 26 October 1998 in the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy, Kaluwitharana made another match winning partnership, this time with skipper Ranatunga. New Zealand made 188 runs and in the chase, both Jayasuriya and de Silva were dismissed for naught. When the scorecard was 3-5, Ranatunga joined with Kaluwitharana and made 127-runs for the fourth wicket. Kaluwitharana run out for 48 runs, but Sri Lanka won the match by 5 wickets with 51 balls remaining. After the semi final berth, Sri Lanka lost the match to South Africa and did not advanced further in the tournament.

In January 1999, Sri Lanka went Australia for the 1998–99 Carlton and United Series. In the first match, Kaluwitharana top scored with 58 runs in a losing course to England. In the 7th match of the series, he scored a match winning fifty and made 116-run partnership with Atapattu to win the match for Sri Lanka. Then he scored 54 runs against England, where Sri Lanka posted 181/7 in 44 overs. In reply, England lost wickets at regular intervals and finally Sri Lanka won the match by 11 runs. In the next match against Australia, Kaluwitharana scored another fifty in a steep chase of 310 posted by Auslitralians. He along with Avishka Gunawardene made 145 for the first wicket within 19.5 overs, where he finally dismissed for 68 runs. Australia later won the match by 43 runs.

Sri Lanka entered to the 1999 Cricket World Cup as defending champions, but ended the tournament as their worst performance in a global competition. Kaluwitharana played all the matches as wicketkeeper middle order batsman, where he made one fifty in the tournament.

After disastrous world cup campaign, Sri Lanka played in 1999 Aiwa Cup, a triangular ODI series involved India and Australia. In the final against Australia, Kaluwitharana scored match winning knock of unbeaten 95 runs with 12 fours and also took 2 stumpings. Sri Lanka won the 1999 Aiwa Cup by 8 wickets and Kaluwitharana adjudged man of the match. After the tournament, Sri Lanka played Coca-Cola Champions Trophy 1999, another triangular tournament involved Pakistan and West Indies. Against Pakistan, he scored 75 runs and made 115-run partnership with Russel Arnold for the second wicket. However, match was ended in a tie despite Sri Lanka needed just 24 from ten overs with eight wickets remaining at one stage. 

During the Zimbabawe tour in 1999, Kaluwitharana was dismissed for 99 during the chase of 260 posted by Zimbabwe in the fourth ODI, becoming the first wicket keeper to got out for 99 in ODI cricket and 7th batsman overall. However, Sri Lanka won the match by 6 wickets. In January 2000 against South Africa, he made useful contribution at the top of the batting lineup, but eventually lost the series 5–1. However with the scores of 55, 2, 83, 74, 9, and 4, he finished the series as the highest run getter for Sri Lanka with 227 runs with an average of 37.83.

On 27 March 2001 against England, Kaluwitharana scored his second ODI century. England made 165 in 50 overs, where Kaluwitharana and Atapattu finished the game in 33.5 overs without a wicket. This is also the first time that England have lost by ten-wickets in ODI history. In the course, he scored an unbeaten 102 in 117 balls with 20 fours, where he was adjudged man of the match and whitewashed England 3-0. In the 2000–01 ARY Gold Cup, he scored a brisk 63 runs against Pakistan but Sri Lanka lost the match by 16 runs. 

In the first ODI against England, Kaluwitharana scored a fluent half century when chasing a target of 293. With the emergence of Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan in wicket keeping and batting credentials, Kaluwitharana lost his place in the ODI team and made sporadic appearances. In the match against New Zealand in the 2003 Bank Alfalah Cup, he was promoted up the order with Jayasuriya and scored 48 runs. He later adjudged man of the match after Sri Lanka won the match by 5 wickets. Against West Indies in the same year in first ODI, he laid the foundations for a moderate total of 201, where he scored 54 runs with painful blows to his helmet and midriff from West Indian pace attack. Sri Lanka finally won the match by 55 runs. 

After the first two ODIs against Australia at home, he was dropped from the squad and he later quit from international cricket after 14 years of career.

===Test career===
His early career made him look like a good Sri Lankan prospect, and the undoubted highlight of his career was the entertaining innings of 132 not out including 26 boundaries that he made on Test debut against a powerful Australian side in 1992. Then in 1995 against Australia, he made two fifties in first innings in the first and second test matches. During the test against Zimbabwe, he scored 71 runs with 10 fours and one six, and made sixth-wicket stand of 142 with Ranatunga. Sri Lanka later won the match by an innings and 77 runs.

In his ninth test match, he scored his second test century in a losing cause. Against New Zealand, Sri Lanka made follow on after New Zealand made a mammoth 586 and Sri Lanka bundled out for 222 in the first innings. His score of 103 included 13 fours and 2 sixes. He was caught and bowled by Daniel Vettori when the total was 270. He along with Chaminda Vaas added 137 for the seventh wicket, but finally Sri Lanka lost the match by an innings and 36 runs.

His third century came against Pakistan in Lahore in 1999. Pakistan batted first and scored 398 in their first innings. In reply, Sri Lanka posted 328 runs with the centuries by Kaluwitharana and Russel Arnold. In the second innings, Arnold and Mahela Jayawardene scored fifties before rain and bad light ended the game in a draw. After the century he played 23 Test matches, but scored only two fifties.

<doc id="894387" wikidata="Q519571" url="?curid=894387" title="Albanian Greek Catholic Church">
<text>The Albanian Greek Catholic Church, or the Albanian Byzantine Catholic Church, is an autonomous (&quot;sui iuris&quot; in Latin) Byzantine Rite particular church in full communion with the Catholic Church and the Pope of Rome, whose members live in Albania and which comprises the Apostolic Administration of Southern Albania. The Albanian Greek Catholic Church, with its Byzantine Rite, is closely linked to the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church sharing a significant commonality of history, identity and traditions.

==History==

The conversion to Christianity of Albania took place under Latin Christianity (and its Roman Rite liturgy) influence in the north and Byzantine Christianity in the south. Christianity was the first and the oldest monotheistic religion of Albanian people. After the fifteenth-century Ottoman conquest, some two thirds of the population accepted Islam. In 1967, Communist-ruled Albania was officially declared an atheist state.

Though the Greek liturgical rite was used in many of its churches, Albania was part of the patriarchate of Rome until 731, when Byzantine Emperor Leo III, in reprisal for the opposition of Pope Gregory III to the emperor&#x27;s iconoclast policy, attached the whole of Eastern Illyricum to the patriarchate of Constantinople.

Catholics of the Latin Church were long established in the north of the country. A Catholic mission worked in the south between 1660, when the Orthodox archbishop joined the Catholic Church, to 1765 when the effort was abandoned because of obstacles placed by the Ottoman rulers. In 1895 a group of villages in Mali Shpati, southeast of Elbasan in central Albania, decided to become Catholic and demanded a bishop of their own rite, a proposal to which the consular representatives of Russia and Montenegro raised objections with the civil authorities. At about the same time, another group of Greek Catholics arose, centred on an archimandrite, George Germanos, who was a nephew of the Orthodox metropolitan in 1900, and concluded a definitive movement of Catholic unity formed in Elbasan. Numbers grew only to a small extent, but enough for southern Albania to become in 1939 a separate ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the care of an Apostolic Administrator. However, after less than seven years, the administrator was expelled, and contact seemed lost with the Byzantine faithful, who found themselves under strict Communist rule.

Only in 1992 was it possible to appoint a new apostolic administrator. At first the post was given to the Holy See&#x27;s diplomatic representative in Tirana, Archbishop Ivan Dias, who later became Archbishop of Mumbai and a cardinal. Archbishop Dias&#x27;s successor as Apostolic Administrator of Southern Albania, not as Nuncio, is the Croatian-born Byzantine-Rite Franciscan bishop , who was appointed in 1996.

By 1998 there were no parishes or priests for the few Byzantine Catholic faithful. Later a small Byzantine parish was established in Elbasan, the same place where Friar Jorgji Germanos settled in 1900. Josif Papamihali was beatified in Shkodër on November 5, 2016. Due to the small number of faithful, the Albanian Greek Catholic Church ceased to be classified as an autonomous (sui juris) particular church since the Pontifical Yearbook 2020.

The apostolic administratorship of Southern Albania has 3,200 Catholics in nine parishes, with 11 churches, and is served by four diocesan and 10 religious priests, 10 male and 97 female religious, who administer 10 schools and 20 charitable institutions. The great majority of these are of the Latin Church.

<text>Kulasekara Mudiyanselage Dinesh Nuwan Kulasekara (; born 22 July 1982) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who played all formats of the game. He was educated at Bandaranayake College Gampaha

He was also a key member of the team that won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and was part of the team that made the finals of 2007 Cricket World Cup, 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and 2012 ICC World Twenty20. In June 2016, Kulasekara retired from test cricket to play limited overs cricket. In July 2019, he announced his retirement from international cricket. The third ODI between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh on 31 July 2019 was dedicated to Kulasekara.

Since retirement, he has moved to Colombo where he now resides.

==International career==
===Early years===
Kulasekara made his One Day International debut against England in Dambulla on 18 November 2003. He took 2–19 as England was bowled out for 88, and Sri Lanka took less than 14 overs to win the match by 10 wickets. Kulasekara made his test-cricket debut against New Zealand in Napier, New Zealand on 4 April 2005 as Sri Lanka&#x27;s 100th test cap. During the match, he took only one wicket and scored a duck as the match was drawn. Kulasekara made his Twenty20 International debut on 11 October 2008 against Pakistan. He secured 36 runs in 3.5 overs, although Pakistan won the match by three wickets.

===Breakthrough===
In 2008, Kulasekara took 4 for 40 against India. During the Bangladesh tri-series, he helped his team defeat Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. On 25 January 2009, Kulasekara was number two in the ICC rankings for ODI bowlers. He took 45 wickets for an average of 20.97, which included five wickets in the last two ODIs of the series against Pakistan.

Kulasekara topped the 2008 ICC ODI rankings for bowlers with 724 points. He took 47 wickets at 20.97 in 29 matches, with a strike rate of 28.00 and an economy rate of 4.45. Kulasekara was ranked number one among ODI bowlers on 11 March 2009, remaining in that position until 26 September of that year. The retirement of Chaminda Vaas and the inconsistency of Lasith Malinga helped him to emerge as the star strike bowler of the Sri Lankan side. His spell of 4 for 41 at Colombo was nominated as one of the best ODI bowling performances of the year by ESPNcricinfo.

During the Pakistan series at home in 2009, Kulasekara was the highest wicket-taker in the three-match test series. He received the man-of-the-match award for his bowling performance in the second test. Sri Lanka won the series 2–0, and Kulasekara received the player-of-the-series award. He took 17 wickets, for an average of 15.05 and an economy of 2.67. His 4 for 37 is his third four-wicket haul in his last two tests.

Kulasekara was on the 2009 World ODI team (captained by MS Dhoni), which was announced during the ICC Awards. On 23 May 2010 against New Zealand, he ripped through New Zealand&#x27;s batting with three wickets in his first over and ended with three for four runs. Sri Lanka won the match by seven wickets, and Kulasekara was man of the match. He was named to the test squad for the West Indies series in 2010.

===Ups and downs===
Kulasekara and Malinga spearheaded the Sri Lankan team since their debut in 2003 and 2004, where they combined to win matches. During a Twenty20 international against England in Bristol, they produced match-winning combined figures of three wickets for 30 runs in seven overs. Sri Lanka won the match by nine wickets.

Injured in October 2012, Kulasekara played in the semi-final of the fifty-over domestic tournament. He made a comeback with two for 37 in seven overs for Colts Cricket Club against Nondescripts, and was recalled for the test and ODI series against South Africa. Kulasekara did not play in the test series, but played all five ODIs without distinction; he took two wickets in the series, at an average of 107.00.

After a CB series in Australia, he was recalled to the test squad for the Pakistan series in 2012. Kulasekara was the highest wicket-taker in the two-match T20I series against Pakistan, taking four wickets at an average of 6.50; the series was drawn, 1-1. Kulasekara and Malinga took seven wickets apiece during the ODI series in Pakistan, which Sri Lanka won 3–0.

In July 2012, Kulasekara was ruled out of the five-ODI series against India after a first-match injury while attempting a catch to dismiss Virender Sehwag in the eleventh over. On 25 October of that year, he was named as vice-captain of Sri Lanka&#x27;s T20I squad for its tour against New Zealand.

On 18 January 2013, Kulasekara had his first (and only) five-wicket match with inswing bowling in the third ODI against Australia at Brisbane. His 5/22 bowling figures were the best of his ODI career. Australia crumbled to 74 all out, and Sri Lanka won by four wickets. Kulasekara&#x27;s performance was nominated as one of the best ODI bowling performances of 2013 by ESPNcricinfo.

===Injuries===
On 4 March 2012, he scored 74 against Australia for a close defeat in the first final of the CB Series. Kulasekara was the second-highest wicket-taker for Sri Lanka with 12 wickets, behind Malinga&#x27;s 18.

On 13 June 2013, against England in 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, Kulasekara helped skipper Kumar Sangakkara score a century and guided Sri Lanka to victory. Sangakkara and Kulasekara added an unbeaten 110 runs for the fourth wicket. In the powerplay, Kulasekara launched Graeme Swann&#x27;s off-spin for two successive leg-side sixes and continued to an unbeaten 58 from 38 balls. Soon after Sangakkara scored his hundred, he fell in mid-pitch while running. Recognizing the danger of being run out at the wicket-keeper&#x27;s end, Kulasekara ran alongside him to ensure that he (not Sangakkara) would be run out. After the Champions Trophy, Sri Lanka went to the West Indies for a triangular series with India. During the match against the West Indies, Kulasekara dislocated the ring finger of his left hand.

After three weeks of resting, Kulasekara was called up for the T20I series against South Africa in 2013; Sri Lanka lost the series, 2–1. At the end of an ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE, he tore a hamstring and missed the test series. After he recovered, Kulasekara was included in the Bangladesh series in Bangladesh. His form was off, however, and he missed part of the Bangladesh tour and the 2014 Asia Cup with a groin injury. During the first ODI against Bangladesh, Kulasekara bowled six overs for 38 runs before he was injured.

===2014===
Kulasekara played in the ODI series against England in 2014, and Sri Lanka won the series 3–2. In the second ODI, he and Sachithra Senanayake bowled-out England for 99 runs for their worst ODI showing at home. Kulasekara took 3 for 15 runs, and Sri Lanka finally won the match by 157 runs.

During a 2014 ICC World Twenty20 match against the Netherlands, Kulasekara set a record for the most economical bowling spell in a T20I or T20 world-cup match (0.00). He bowled two overs without conceding a run; the Netherlands were bowled out for 43, the lowest T20I total.

Kulasekara holds the world record for most T20I maiden overs bowled (six). He was named to CricBuzz&#x27;s 2014 T20I XI of the year for his limited-overs performance. Kulasekara forged a bowling partnership with Malinga, helping Sri Lanka to win 2014 ICC World Twenty20 by bowling four overs against strong Indian batters. Sri Lanka won 20 ODIs out of 32, a 62.5 winning percentage, that year.

===Late career===
Also in 2014, Sri Lanka went to India for an ODI series. They were whitewashed 5–0 in the series, the first such result in Sri Lanka cricket history. Rohit Sharma scored the highest individual ODI total (264); Kulasekara took 1 for 89 in nine overs, and missed the England series. On 30 December 2014, however, he was recalled to the ODI squad for the series against New Zealand at home. Kulasekara was the T20 Bowler of the Year at the 2015 Sri Lanka Cricket Awards. He was overlooked for the July series against Pakistan that year (after his World Cup campaign), but was recalled to the ODI squad for the series against the West Indies.

On 18 December 2015, Kulasekara replaced the injured Dhammika Prasad on Sri Lanka&#x27;s ODI squad against New Zealand. Sri Lanka won only one match in the series, losing in all three formats. In the first ODI, Kulasekara scored his fourth ODI fifty; he and Milinda Siriwardana formed a partnership with 98 runs. He was dismissed for 58 runs, and Sri Lanka scored a total of 188; New Zealand won the match by seven wickets. He played in 2016 Asia Cup and then 2016 ICC World Twenty20 in India,

On 5 November 2016, Kulasekara was recalled for the tri-series with Zimbabwe and the West Indies; he picked up two wickets against West Indies to go with his two in the first match against Zimbabwe. Sri Lanka won the series by defeating Zimbabwe in the final, and Kulasekara took one wicket in that final. He was the third-highest wicket-taker in the series, with eight wickets and an average of 22.50. During the Bangladesh tour of Sri Lanka in 2017, Kulasekara helped Sri Lanka end their ODI drought by taking four wickets for 37 runs; Sri Lanka won the third ODI match by 70 runs.

===Retirement===
On 1 June 2016, Kulasekara announced his retirement from test cricket to focus on limited-over internationals. He played 21 tests, picked up 48 wickets, and played his last test in June 2014 at Lord&#x27;s (a draw).

During the 2019 Cricket World Cup, fellow Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga had hinted that he would like to retire from ODI cricket with Kulasekara. However, Sri Lanka Cricket and the selection committee and omitted only Kulasekara from the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour. Kulasekara sent a letter to Sri Lanka Cricket asking them to consider Malinga&#x27;s request to play a farewell match together; after receiving no reply, he announced his retirement from international cricket on 24 July 2019.

Malinga also announced his retirement from ODI cricket after the first ODI series in Bangladesh. Sri Lanka Cricket announced that the third ODI of the series would be dedicated to Kulasekara. Sri Lanka won the match, shutting out Bangladesh in the series 3–0.

==Records==
*Highest ODI score for Sri Lanka when batting at the number-eight position - 73
* Most economical spell in a T20I by any bowler - 0.00 against the Netherlands
* Only bowler to record an economy of 0.00 in a T20I
* Most maidens in a T20I - five

==Bowling style==
Kulasekara used a long run–up and the seam to move both ways to trouble the batsman. Primarily an inswing bowler, he was seldom overly aggressive to batsmen. Kulasekara also developed an outswinger delivery.

==Professional cricket==
On 29 April 2009, Kulasekara was called to the Kings XI Punjab squad as an emergency replacement for injured Australian batsman Shaun Marsh. He joined the Chennai Super Kings for the 2011 Indian Premier League season.

Kulasekara played in the domestic T20I series for Kandurata Maroons. In the final, against Basnahira Greens, he took a match-winning three wickets. Kandurata won the match by seven wickets, and was selected for the 2013 Champions League Twenty20. Kulasekara played for Comilla Victorians in the Bangladesh Premier League in 2015. During the match against Rangpur Riders on 27 November 2015, he took four wickets for 12 runs. In 2016, Kulasekara signed a short-term NatWest T20 Blast contract with the Sussex Sharks.

== Coaching career ==
He was appointed as the bowling coach of the Kandy Tuskers franchise for the 2020 Lanka Premier League which also marks his maiden coaching stint in his career.

==Arrest==
Kulasekara was detained by Kadawatha police on 19 September 2016 after he was involved in a road accident which killed a 28-year-old motorcyclist. He appeared before the Mahara magistrate, and was released on SLR 500,000 bail. The accident occurred near the Kirillawala junction in Kadawatha during the afternoon; the rider was approaching Kulasekara&#x27;s vehicle, passed a bus, struck an embankment in the centre of the road, and was thrown into the path of Kulasekara&#x27;s vehicle.

<doc id="894399" wikidata="Q422980" url="?curid=894399" title="Brett Lee">
<text>Brett Lee (born 8 November 1976) is an Australian former international cricketer, who played all three formats of the game. During his international career, Lee was recognised as one of the fastest bowlers in the world. With his time representing Australia, Lee won multiple ICC titles with the team: the 2003 Cricket World Cup, the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, and the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy. Lee was the first bowler to take a hat-trick in the T20 format of the game which he did in 2007 ICC World Twenty20 in the inaugural tournament against Bangladesh, subsequently being the first bowler to do so at an ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup. Lee was also the first Australian bowler to take a hat-trick at a Cricket World Cup which he did in the 2003 Cricket World Cup Super Match game against Kenya.

In each of his first two years, Lee conceded fewer than 20 runs for every wicket taken, but later recorded figures in the low 30s. He was an athletic fielder and useful lower-order batter, with a batting average exceeding 20 in Test cricket. Lee finished his Test career with 310 wickets, and his One Day International career with 380 wickets. Considered one of the best bowlers of his generation, only Muttiah Muralitharan took more ODI wickets than Lee from 2000 to 2009.

He played his first Test in 1999 and retired from international cricket on 12 July 2012. He subsequently declined to renew his contract with his home state side New South Wales, but continued to play Twenty20 matches for several seasons after, notably in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Big Bash League.

In January 2015, Lee announced his retirement from all forms of the game, effective at the end of the 2014–15 Big Bash League season. He has since found work as a film actor and a Fox Sports commentator.

==Domestic career==
Lee started playing in the junior teams of his local side, Oak Flats Rats, and gradually worked his way up the ranks. He also played for Middleton cricket before he played first class career.
At 16 he began playing first grade cricket for Campbelltown, where he managed to claim the wickets of a few New South Wales cricketers, and Mosman, where at one point, he shared the new ball with Shoaib Akhtar and briefly played alongside England batsman Andrew Strauss.

Lee was called up to the Australian Under 17 &amp; 19 teams. In March 1994, he was forced out of the Australian under-19 team to tour India due to stress fractures in his lower back and it forced him to remodel his bowling action to minimise the impact on his back. He was awarded a scholarship to attend the AIS Australian Cricket Academy in the 1995–96 season. His contemporaries included fellow internationals Jason Gillespie and Mike Hussey.

Prior to making his first-class debut, Lee played for Mosman in the final of the 1996–97 Sydney Grade Cricket competition.

Lee was first named in the New South Wales Blues squad as the twelfth man for the 14–16 November match against Queensland in the 1997–98 Sheffield Shield. The following week, he made his first-class debut for the Blues against Western Australia and took 3 wickets at 114, including that of the captain Tom Moody. It would be his only appearance in the Sheffield Shield for the rest of the season. He ended a memorable month by taking a 5-wicket haul in the Sydney grade Limited-Overs Cup final against Bankstown on 30 November.

During the 1998–99 season Lee was a more regular presence in the latter stages of the Sheffield Shield. He took 14 wickets, including a 5-wicket haul against Tasmania in the second innings. He started the 1999–2000 season by claiming 8 wickets in his first two matches. Such performances impressed his New South Wales teammate Steve Waugh, who was then Australia captain, and culminated in his Test debut in December 1999. He finished the season as the Blues&#x27; second-highest wicket taker in the Pura Cup with 24 wickets in 5 matches.

After a successful Test series against India, Lee returned to domestic cricket and was named in the 2008 Pura Cup final. He hit his career best batting score, 97 against Victoria in the Blues&#x27; second innings and scored a record 176-run partnership with Beau Casson. In Victoria&#x27;s second innings, he took 4–72, dismissing the last four tailenders, as the Blues won the final.

In 2009 he battled back from injury and was a key player in New South Wales&#x27; success during the Champions League Twenty20. During the final he played an important part with both bat and ball and was named Man of the Match. He also won the Man of the Series award.

Following his retirement from Test cricket, Lee stopped playing first-class cricket to concentrate on the limited-overs formats. He was the Blues&#x27; highest wicket-taker in the 2010–11 Ryobi One-Day Cup with 15 wickets and had the second best economy rate of the top five wicket-takers despite missing the latter stages of the campaign due to international duty.

In June 2012 he declined to renew his contract with the Blues, ending his 15-year association with his domestic team.

He retired from Big Bash League after playing in the final for the Sydney Sixers on 28 January 2015. In the dramatic final over, he took two wickets clean bowled in successive deliveries, and his hat-trick ball, the sixth of the over, resulted in a missed run out and the Perth Scorchers win by 4 wickets.

==International career==
===Debut days===
One month after making his first class debut, Lee was chosen to represent the Australian A team on a tour of South Africa. He claimed two wickets but in that match stress fractures in his back from the previous injury re-opened and Lee was in a back brace for over three months.

===Test career===
By the late 1990s there were calls for Lee to be included in the national squad. Captain Steve Waugh, who also played with him for New South Wales, was impressed by Lee&#x27;s debut and pushed for his inclusion into the national team. He was eventually chosen in the final 14 for the Test series against Pakistan in 1999 but failed to make the starting 11. By the time the Test series against India came around, he was twelfth man. However, he duly made his Test debut for Australia in December 1999 against the touring Indians, becoming Australia&#x27;s 383rd Test cricketer.

Bowling first change, Lee took a wicket in his first over in Test cricket when he bowled Sadagoppan Ramesh with his fourth delivery. He also captured Rahul Dravid in his first spell before returning to take three wickets in six balls to finish the innings with figures of 5/47 from 17 overs, becoming the first Australian fast bowler since Dennis Lillee to take 5 wickets on debut. Lee took 13 wickets in his opening two Tests at the low average of 14.15.

Lee won the inaugural Donald Bradman Young Player of the Year Award at the Allan Border Medal award ceremony in 2000 soon after his debut.

Lee took 42 wickets in his opening three series, the most by any Australian bowler in the seven matches he played. He was selected for the Test series against the West Indies in late 2000. During the first Test he scored his first half-century in test cricket and in the next Test, took seven wickets including a five wicket haul in the second innings. However, he suffered a stress fracture of the lower back which kept him out of the next three Tests. He returned against Zimbabwe but soon suffered another setback a month later when he injured his right elbow and was sidelined until May 2001.

====Return from injury====
Lee returned to the international team for the 2001 Ashes series after recovering from an elbow injury. His comeback saw less success than his debut, managing only nine wickets in five Tests at 55.11. However, Lee was back as Australia&#x27;s leading wicket-taker in the first and third Test against New Zealand later that year, in a series which he captured 5 wickets in the second innings and made a contribution of 61 with the bat in the first Test match. The series ended in a 0–0 draw. He finished the series with 14 wickets at 25.14. The two home and away series against South Africa were not as productive, yielding 19 wickets in six Tests at 38.42.

Lee only took five wickets in a match on three occasions between the New Zealand series and the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Lee came under pressure for his position after taking only five wickets at 46.50 in the three-Test series against Pakistan in 2002. Andy Bichel, who was filling for the injured Jason Gillespie, took eight wickets at 13.25. With the other frontline bowlers all taking wickets at less than 13, Lee was dropped when Gillespie returned for the first two Tests during the 2002–03 Ashes series. He returned for the Perth Test, after claiming a five wicket haul in a Pura Cup match against Queensland for New South Wales. He took thirteen wickets at 41.23 in three matches, compared to Bichel&#x27;s ten at 35.1. After the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Lee took 17 wickets at 28.88 in four Tests against the West Indies. It was the first series in two years where he averaged under 30, and only the second in that period where he averaged under 40.

After a mid year break, he participated in a Two Test series against Bangladesh in northern Australia. He took six wickets at 31.66, and was Australia&#x27;s most expensive bowler, with the other specialist bowlers averaging 15.55 against the lowest ranked team in Test cricket. He followed this with six wickets at 37 in a comfortable 2–0 Test series against Zimbabwe, in which the other specialist bowlers averaged 23.15.

Against the Indian batting line-up in the 2003–04 home series, which ended in a 1–1 draw for Australia, Lee was out of the first two Tests recovering from a torn abdominal muscle, an injury which he sustained during the Zimbabwe series.

====Loss of Test position====
Lee took eight wickets in 100 overs in the final two Tests against India, at an average of 59.50. This Test included a double century to Sachin Tendulkar in the Indians&#x27; first innings of 7/705 where Sachin and V.V.S. Laxman freely attacked Lee and other bowlers in the final Test in Sydney. He ended the series with the worst average and economy rate of Australia&#x27;s front line bowlers.

He was subsequently replaced by fellow fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz in 2004 during the tour of Sri Lanka when Lee&#x27;s ankle injury worsened, forcing him to return home to have surgery. This injury would force Lee out of the game for four and a half months to ensure his full recovery.
Lee&#x27;s form in the Test arena had been ineffective, and from July 2001 to January 2004, he had a Test bowling average of 38.42, compared to an average of 16.07 in his earlier career.

Lee was unable to reclaim his position for eighteen months, when Kasprowicz took 47 wickets at 23.74 in thirteen Tests, taking his wickets at a much lower cost than Lee had done in the previous three years. This included 17 wickets at 26.82 on the spin friendly pitches of the Indian subcontinent, helping Australia to its first whitewash in Sri Lanka, and its first series win in India for 35 years.

====Test return====
After 18 months on the sidelines, Lee returned to the Test team in the 2005 Ashes series. With Kasprowicz and Jason Gillespie both struggling for form, Lee returned to take the new ball with Glenn McGrath. He averaged 40 with the ball for the series, which some commentators have put down to having to bowl longer spells than he was accustomed to at the time , but was retained, in part because of his defiant batting which yielded runs at an average of 26.33. During the Ashes, he claimed his 150th test wicket off Andrew Strauss with a straight yorker on Day 1 of the third test.

Part of Lee&#x27;s difficulty at Test level is that the benefits of his high speed, which give the batsmen less reaction time, also results in more erratic bowling. In recent times he has tried to concentrate solely on accuracy by reducing speed. During the first Test against the West Indies in late 2005 at the Gabba, after declaring that he would sacrifice pace and focus on &#x27;line and length&#x27;, Lee reverted to his initial style of bowling, based on the advice of his captain Ricky Ponting after his new method of bowling failed in the first innings. This saw him take 5/30 his fifth five-wicket haul in Tests, his first in four years.

In the 2005-06 Australian cricket season, Lee&#x27;s Test figures improved from his 2001–04 difficulties, with a season bowling average of 25.74.

During South Africa&#x27;s 2005–06 tour of Australia, Lee&#x27;s form saw a steady improvement, with figures of 5/93 in the first Test at Perth. He finished the three Test series with 13 wickets and of the Australian bowlers, was second only to Shane Warne&#x27;s 14 wickets in the series. Three Australian players including Lee, who was reprimanded in the Third Test in Sydney for showing dissent towards umpire Aleem Dar.

With the unavailability of Glenn McGrath for the tour of South Africa in March–April 2006, Lee became the spearhead of the Australian bowling line-up. In the second Test of that series, at Durban, Lee captured his 200th Test wicket in his 51st match and also captured figures of 5 for 69, on the back of 49 Test wickets in 2005. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He was unable to maintain his performance when Australia visited Bangladesh for a two Test series, taking two wickets at 93, coming bottom of Australia&#x27;s bowling averages.

In the first three tests of the 2006–07 Ashes series, he only took eight wickets and was fined for excessive appealing in the Third Test in Adelaide when a LBW decision was not in his favour. However, during the week period between the Adelaide and Melbourne tests, he worked with Troy Cooley, Australia&#x27;s bowling coach, to adjust his run up and came back in the 4th and final tests with more wickets. He finished the series 20 wickets, with his best bowling figures being 4 for 47 at an average of 33.20, including 6 in the final test. His tally was only bettered by his teammates Stuart Clark, Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath as the quartet claimed more wickets than the entire England bowling attack combined.

====Post McGrath-Warne era====
Following the retirements of Warne and McGrath, Lee rose to the challenge and was awarded the Man of the Series in the inaugural Warne-Muralidaran Trophy, a two-Test series against Sri Lanka in late 2007. In his first series as bowling spearhead reaped 16 wickets at an average of 17.5. This was achieved by bowling slower to improve accuracy. In the following series Lee took 24 wickets at 22.58 in four Tests against India. In this series he overtook Jason Gillespie to become Australia&#x27;s 5th highest wicket taker. His consistent efforts saw him rewarded with the Man of the Series Award for the Border–Gavaskar Trophy, 2007–08. He capped off the season by winning the Allan Border Medal, the award given to the player adjudged Australia&#x27;s best international cricketer of the past year.

Lee seemed underdone in the 2008 Australian tour of the West Indies, taking only 5 wickets in the first Test match, during which he seemed exhausted. He returned to productivity, taking eight wickets in the Second test, including a 5 wicket haul, and 6 in the Third Test.

During the Indian tour, Lee picked up a stomach virus and was unable to find his best form throughout the series. Lee showed glimpses of his best form when the team returned to Australia for a two test series with New Zealand, but generally seemed down on pace. However, he struggled in the two tests he played of the series with South Africa, which Australia lost 2–1, likely due to a niggling ankle injury and then a stress fracture he developed during the series (both in his left foot). The fracture broke completely during the second innings of the Boxing Day Test-match and he was forced to return home for surgery.

By the time he returned to the Australian team for the Ashes in 2009, his position as spearhead had been usurped by the left armer Mitchell Johnson. Additionally, the arrival of bowlers like Peter Siddle, Ben Hilfenhaus and Doug Bollinger ensured that Lee had to fight for a position in the team. However, he took six wickets in the first innings against the England Lions team in a practice match leading up to the Ashes. Lee was the only bowler to get reverse swing in this match and appeared to be in line for selection for the First Test at Cardiff. However, he picked up a left side strain and a sore rib in this match and he was ruled out of the first three Tests. He was then overlooked for a recall and never played test cricket again, announcing his retirement from test cricket at the beginning of 2010.

====Retirement====
Lee had been considering retiring from Test cricket for some time since 2008 due to the physical strain. In February 2010, he announced his retirement from Test cricket after consulting friend and England rival Andrew Flintoff, stating that bowling &quot;at 150 km/h for five days is very hard on the body&quot;. He had been out with a string of injuries and had not played a Test since December 2008. He ended his Test career with 310 wickets in 76 tests, at the time the fourth highest Australian total behind Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Dennis Lillee.

===One-day International career===

Lee made his One Day International debut for Australia against Pakistan on 9 January 2000 during the Carlton and United Breweries Series at the Gabba, Brisbane. He became the 140th ODI cricketer to represent Australia. In February 2002 against South Africa, he scored his first ODI half century, 51* not out.

In One-day Internationals, he was ranked by the ICC as the No. 1 ODI bowler in January 2006 and has been ranked among the top ten ODI bowlers since the start of 2003. His bowling strike rate of around 30 puts him amongst the most incisive in this form of the game. He also has a One-day International hat-trick to his name, achieved in the 2003 World Cup against Kenya. Lee was the first Australian and fourth bowler to ever achieve this feat in World Cup history.

In the matches Australia played in the 2005–06 triangular one day series, Lee gave a display of his useful batting abilities by making 57 in the second game in a 100 run partnership with Michael Hussey to pull Australia out of a middle order collapse. Lee finished the series with 15 wickets, the third highest tally behind Nathan Bracken and Muttiah Muralitharan.

His bowler-fielder partnership with long-time international teammate and wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist yielded 58 wickets in 151 matches, the fourth highest of all time in ODI history.

====2003 World Cup====
With main bowler Shane Warne banned from the 2003 World Cup the day before the opening match, Lee moved up the pecking order and, together with Andy Bichel and Glenn McGrath, formed one of the tournament&#x27;s most lethal attacks, claiming 59 wickets between them. Lee concluded the tournament with 22 wickets off 83.1 overs at an average of 17.90, a wicket behind Sri Lankan left-arm fastbowler Chaminda Vaas. Lee also had a third leading strike-rate of 22.68 behind West Indian fast bowler Vasbert Drakes and Australian counterpart Andrew Bichel who topped the strike-rates with 19.43 and 21.37 respectively. He also reached the mark thrice; his delivery to Marvan Atapattu in the semi-final reached and hit in his second over against England in the group stage.

Lee earned six of his 22 wickets during the group stage, 11 wickets during the Super-six stage, 3 from the semi-final and 2 wickets from the final which Australia won. He took one five-wicket haul, 5 for 42, against Trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand during their super-six encounter at Port Elizabeth to put Australia ahead after a dismal innings. He also earned his first international hat-trick with figures of 3 for 14 against Kenya during the last match of the super-six stage.

====Comeback====
After having to return home due to injury during the 2007 World Cup, Lee traveled with the squad to England for the 2009 &quot;English summer&quot; tour. He was left out of the test side during the Ashes but was in the one-day side for the NatWest Series in September. He was the highest wicket-taker for Australia with 12 and also took his ninth five-wicket haul in ODIs as Australia made a clean sweep winning all except one match in the series. With that five-wicket haul, he became the first person to take two five-wicket hauls in ODIs at Lord&#x27;s; the ball used is now on display at Lord&#x27;s MCC Museum. Later that month he was a part of the successful 2009 ICC Champions Trophy squad and was level on 6 wickets with teammates Peter Siddle and Shane Watson, the highest total for the Australian team. Injuries sustained in test matches forced him out until 2011, having not played for Australia for almost two years. In the subsequent ODI series, his return was more successful. He finished as the leading wicket-taker for the series with 11 scalps at 24.00, his series best figures of 3/27 coming in the third match at the SCG. His pace was consistently around the mid 140s km/h and on occasion he once again managed to break the mark..

Despite competition from younger bowlers and another injury setback, Lee managed to make the squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He finished the tournament with 13 wickets, the highest of all the bowlers in the team. Of the 13 wickets, 4 came in the match against Pakistan but it was not enough as Australia lost the match and eventually crashed out at the quarterfinals to rivals India.

Against the West Indies in March 2012 he hit his highest score, 59 before getting caught off a ball by Kemar Roach. His final ODIs were during the 2012 tour of England and Ireland. During the match against Ireland he opened the bowling and bowled William Porterfield and Ed Joyce in only his first three deliveries.

====Retirement====
Upon his retirement from international cricket, Lee had played in 76 Tests, 221 ODIs and 25 T20Is, and had equaled Glenn McGrath&#x27;s run of 380 wickets in ODI matches – the highest for Australia.

In July 2014, he played for the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord&#x27;s. In 2018, during his commentary for BT Sport in the 2017–18 Ashes series at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Lee revealed that he is an honorary member at Lord&#x27;s, but not a lifetime member on his home ground at the SCG.

===Twenty20===
Lee made his Twenty20 and T20 International debut on 15 February 2005 against New Zealand in the first ever T20 international match. He was called up to the squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20. During the tournament, he made history by claiming the first hat-trick in T20 internationals in the Group F match against Bangladesh and also won the Man of the Match award.

===Bowling style===
Lee was known for his pace and regularly clocked 140 km/h (87 mph) and above. He ranks only behind the Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar () who is ranked as the fastest bowler of all time. The strain of consistently bowling at caused a string of stress fractures and recurring injuries and forced him to alter his strategy, which he amassed effectively. Rather than relying on pace alone, he used a wide array of deliveries aimed at wearing down the batsman, although he has been known to bowl entire spells above the mark. His fastest ball was clocked at against New Zealand in 2005. In a match against West Indies in 2000/01 he bowled a delivery which was clocked at , but this was later shown to be an erroneous measurement of a 142 km/h delivery.

Early in his career, Lee was reported for a suspected illegal bowling action, but was cleared, and was also heavily criticised after bowling a series of beamers at batsmen during a number of ODIs in 2005. Captain Ricky Ponting defended Lee saying that it was not intentional. His slower balls also has dramatic falls of pace with varying length, often from a cutter grip, where it can go as slow as , but it hovers on average around the range. He is also known to celebrate many bowled wickets with a chainsaw celebration.

===Batting===
Lee was a competent lower-order batsman. Together with Mike Hussey, he has held the record for highest 7th wicket partnership for Australia in ODIs since 2005–06 with 123. During the 2005 Ashes series, Lee had numerous defiant innings, including a stand of 43 not out in the Second Test at Edgbaston, Australia&#x27;s highest individual score in that innings. This innings nearly won the match for Australia but the other batsman Michael Kasprowicz was caught behind by Geraint Jones and England won by just two runs. After the memorable match, England bowlers Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff went over to console Lee. The image of Flintoff consoling Lee was a moment which came to symbolise a hotly contested series.

On 2 April 2006, Lee hit his highest Test score of 64 in 68 balls against South Africa at Johannesburg. His previous highest score in Tests was 62 not out which he made against the West Indies in 2000 at the Gabba. Lee nearly surpassed this score on 3 January 2008 against India when he made 59 off 121 balls. Lee had also once again nearly surpassed his highest test score when he had made 63 not out, but unfortunately Ricky Ponting had declared the innings in the 2nd test against the West Indies. As a result of this, he fell one run short of his highest test score.

Lee&#x27;s highest score in ODI matches is 59 against West Indies at West Indies in March 2012.

==Career best performances==
==Media work==
After announcing his retirement from international cricket, Lee joined the Channel Nine cricket commentating team. He assisted author Michael Panckridge in the cricket-related Toby Jones novel series. In 2019, he performed in The Masked Singer Australia as Parrot, placing 11th in the leaderboard.

Lee was cast in the Indo-Australian film &quot;UnIndian&quot; opposite Tannishtha Chatterjee. The film was shot in Sydney. It was released in India in 2016 and had good takings at the box office.

==Personal life==
Lee is the second of three sons born to Bob, a metallurgist, and Helen (née Buxton), a piano teacher, and grew up in the Shellharbour suburbs of Oak Flats and Mount Warrigal. His older brother Shane is a retired all rounder and former international and younger brother Grant previously played cricket for New South Wales U-19, and is now an accountant. Lee attended Balarang Public School and Oak Flats High School, which later named its cricket ground in his honour.

The brothers first played cricket together in front of their house using a tennis ball and the garage door as the &quot;wicket-keeper&quot;. As a child he idolised Allan Donald and Dennis Lillee, the latter of whom would become a mentor to him as a teenager.

Lee has been known by his nicknames &#x27;Binga&#x27;, after the chain of electronics store Bing Lee, since his high-school days. He was once briefly nicknamed &quot;Oswald&quot; by former Australian captain and New South Wales teammate Steve Waugh during his early international career. During an ODI around 2000, he was in the batting order behind his brother Shane and Ian Harvey. When Waugh read out the batting order, instead of reading &quot;Lee, Harvey, Lee&quot;, he read out &quot;Lee, Harvey, Oswald&quot; (Lee Harvey Oswald).

Lee married Elizabeth Kemp in June 2006. They have a son. After two years of marriage Lee confirmed his separation from Kemp and they divorced in 2009. At the time of the split, media speculation suggested Kemp was having an affair with a rugby player in Brisbane; however, this was later disputed, with extended periods of loneliness due to Lee&#x27;s off-season commitments keeping him away from Kemp and his young son given as the reason for the marriage breakdown. He married Lana Anderson in 2014 after one year of dating; they have two children.

Lee is part of the rock band Six &amp; Out. The band is made up of his brother Shane and former New South Wales cricketers Brad McNamara, Gavin Robertson and Richard Chee Quee. Lee plays the bass guitar or acoustic guitar for the band.

During the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy in India, Lee wrote the lyrics for &quot;You&#x27;re the One for Me&quot; and recorded it with Indian singer Asha Bhosle. The song reached a peak position of number two on the Indian and South African charts. In 2008, he filmed scenes for his first Bollywood movie &quot;Victory&quot;.

In November 2011, Lee launched his autobiography, which he wrote with the help of author James Knight.

Politically, Lee is right wing. In September 2013, he tweeted his support for Tony Abbott, leader of the Liberal Party of Australia in the 2013 Australian federal election. He was approached by the Liberal Party to run as a candidate in the 2019 election. Lee again endorsed Abbott in the Division of Warringah in the election. In 2014, Lee was criticised after he signed bats for Indian politicians Rajnath Singh, and Sushma Swaraj. The bats were presented by immigration minister Scott Morrison as part of a deal by which India would agree to accept rejected Indian asylum seekers from Australia. Lee however stated that he was a strong supporter of human rights, and that signing these bats did not mean he was not a supporter of them.

==Charity work==
Lee supports a number of charities including the Salvation Army, the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) and the Make a Wish Foundation, in which Lee was named an &#x27;Official Friend&#x27; in honour of his long-standing association with the foundation. He began supporting ADRA along with his brother Shane when a close friend committed suicide. In 2007, Lee initiated Mewsic, a charitable foundation in India which has established six music centres across the country.

<text>Separamadu Lasith Malinga (; ; born 28 August 1983) is a Sri Lankan former cricketer who is widely regarded as one of the greatest limited overs bowlers of all time. Playing as a right-arm fast bowler, Malinga was commonly used as a specialist death bowler, and captained the Sri Lanka national cricket team to the 2014 T20 World Cup title. He was nicknamed &quot;Slinga Malinga&quot; due to his distinctive round-arm action, sometimes referred to as a sling action. Malinga announced his retirement from all forms of cricket on 14 September 2021.

Malinga&#x27;s unorthodox action and dipping slower ball yorkers are credited with much of his success. He changed the dynamics and landscape of death bowling in limited overs cricket through his technique and approach. Malinga is known for his ability to take wickets on consecutive balls, often through bowling in-swinging yorkers: he is the only bowler in the world to have two World Cup hat-tricks, the first bowler to take a double hat-trick, the only bowler to take 4 wickets in 4 balls twice in international cricket, the only bowler to have taken three hat-tricks in ODIs and only bowler to have two double hat-tricks. He is also the first bowler to take five hat-tricks across all formats of international cricket, and holds the record for most hat-tricks in international cricket.

On 22 April 2011, he announced his retirement from Test cricket. He has been named as the official event ambassador for the World Twenty20 Championships by ICC. On 26 July 2019, he retired from One Day International cricket after the first ODI against Bangladesh.

In September 2019, during the series against New Zealand, Malinga became the first bowler to take 100 wickets in Twenty20 International cricket. He achieved a hat-trick, becoming the first bowler to claim two T20I hat-tricks, and took four wickets in four consecutive balls in the third over of his spell. This feat made him the second bowler to accomplish this in T20I history, following Rashid Khan.

In January 2021, he retired from T20 franchise cricket. In September 2021, Malinga announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.

==Early years==
Malinga grew up in modest circumstances in Rathgama, a coastal village situated northwest of Galle. He often played cricket with friends on the sand banks and coconut groves by a river in his cricket-obsessed village. His father Separamadu Milton, is a retired bus mechanic who worked out of the Galle depot. He had his education at three schools, namely Mahinda College, Galle; Vidyaloka College, Galle and Vidyathilake Vidyalaya, Thiranagama. Malinga had his primary education at Vidyathilake Vidyalaya in Thiranagama, a school situated near by his village. He married Tanya Perera in 2010.

After passing the grade 5 Scholarship Examination in 1993, he entered Vidyaloka College, Galle for his secondary education, where he started his cricket career. Here Malinga was discovered by former Sri Lankan paceman Champaka Ramanayake. Champaka, so impressed by Malinga&#x27;s raw ability, invited him to join the Galle Cricket Club. Champaka also helped him to join the first XI cricket team of Mahinda College, Galle. Joining Mahinda College was the turning point of his cricket career and he was helped by some of its distinguished Old boys. A short-lived attempt to make Malinga&#x27;s action more upright led to much reduced pace and failing accuracy. Malinga promptly returned to his natural action with success, and with great encouragement from Ramanayake.

He didn&#x27;t pick up hard-ball cricket until relatively in his teenage but his talent was discovered by fast bowling coaches Champaka Ramanayake and Anusha Samaranayake. Both of them brought him to the domestic system and nurtured him during his early years.

==International career==
===Debut years===
Malinga made his Test debut on 1 July 2004 against Australia at Marrara Oval In Darwin. He was immediately successful, taking six wickets in the match (Darren Lehmann twice, Adam Gilchrist, Damien Martyn, Shane Warne and Michael Kasprowicz) He was impressed by the friendliness of the Australian team in general, and in particular Adam Gilchrist who sought him out after the game to present him with one of the match stumps in the Sri Lankan dressing room.

Malinga made his ODI debut in Sri Lanka&#x27;s opening match of the 2004 Asia Cup against the United Arab Emirates, becoming the 123rd player to do so. Easily winning the match by 116 runs, Malinga took the wicket of the Emirati captain, Khurram Khan to finish the match with figures of 1/39. Since then he has become a regular member on the ODI squad.

===Test retirement===
He developed into Sri Lanka&#x27;s fastest Test bowler and a regular member of both their Test and One Day International sides. He has earned a reputation for troubling batsmen with his lively pace and well-directed bouncer. He regularly bowls at speeds between and sometimes slightly faster. As time went by he started to lose pace, clocking around . His slower off cutter was also menacing. He burst onto the test scene after ripping through the New Zealand top order, helping Sri Lanka draw the test series on their 2006/07 tour of New Zealand. He announced his retirement from Test cricket on 22 April 2011 in order to prolong his career in ODI and T20 cricket.

===Golden World Cups===
During the 2007 Cricket World Cup Super 8 match on 28 March between Sri Lanka and South Africa, Malinga became the first player to take four wickets in four consecutive balls in One Day International cricket. Needing five runs for victory and with five wickets in hand, Malinga was handed the ball in the 45th over of the South African&#x27;s innings. In the final two balls of the over he cleaned bowled Shaun Pollock and had Andrew Hall caught at cover. In his next over, he removed Jacques Kallis caught behind then bowled Makhaya Ntini. This was only the fifth hat-trick in World Cup history, the third ODI hat-trick for Sri Lanka and the 24th overall in ODIs. He nearly took the final wicket as a ball shaved the stumps. Despite Malinga&#x27;s lethal spell, however, South Africa proceeded to win the match by 1 wicket with 10 balls still left.

<doc id="894406" wikidata="Q173789" url="?curid=894406" title="Justin Langer">
<text>Justin Lee Langer (born 21 November 1970) is an Australian cricket coach and former cricketer. He is the former coach of the Australia men&#x27;s national team, having been appointed to the role in May 2018 and leaving in February 2022 and became the coach of Lucknow based IPL franchise Lucknow Super Giants in July, 2023. A left-handed batsman, Langer is best known for his partnership with Matthew Hayden as Australia&#x27;s test opening batsmen during the early and mid-2000s, considered one of the most successful ever. Representing Western Australia domestically, Langer played English county cricket for Middlesex and also Somerset. He holds the record for the most runs scored at first-class level by an Australian. As Australia&#x27;s coach, he led the team to victory in the 2021 T20 World Cup.

Born in Perth, Western Australia, Langer excelled at cricket from an early age, representing Western Australia at under-age level, as well as the Australia under-19 team. He also won a scholarship to the Australian Cricket Academy at the Australian Institute of Sport in 1990. Langer made his first-class debut for Western Australia during the 1991–92 Sheffield Shield, and, after good form at state level, made his Test debut for Australia the following season at the age of 22, during the West Indies&#x27; 1992–93 tour. Although maintaining his place in the side, he struggled for form, and only made sporadic appearances for Australia until his selection for Australia&#x27;s 1998–99 tour of Pakistan, in which he scored his first Test century. Establishing himself at number three in the batting order, Langer maintained this role until the 2001 Ashes series. Having been injured for the first four Tests, he replaced Michael Slater as Matthew Hayden&#x27;s opening partner for the final Test, and scored a century in Australia&#x27;s innings win. This was the first of three centuries in consecutive matches that secured Langer&#x27;s position at the top of the order.

Except for injuries, the partnership between Hayden and Langer (with Ricky Ponting moving to Langer&#x27;s previous position at number three) persisted until Langer&#x27;s retirement at the conclusion of the 2006–07 Ashes series. Their partnership included a total of 5,655 runs over a period of 113 innings, second only to the partnership between West Indians Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes. Langer&#x27;s retirement came after several injuries had restricted his batting, including a concussion sustained during Australia&#x27;s 2005–06 tour of South Africa. Despite having been one of the leading runscorers in Australia&#x27;s domestic limited-overs competition, he only played eight One Day International matches for Australia, all during a period from 1994 to 1997. After his retirement, Langer played one final season with Western Australia (having served as the state&#x27;s captain since the 2002–03 season), as well as continuing as captain of Somerset in English domestic cricket. He retired from all forms of the cricket at the end of the 2009 English cricket season. Langer was the Australian national cricket team&#x27;s batting coach and senior assistant coach from November 2009 until November 2012, when he was appointed senior coach of the Perth Scorchers and Western Australia.

In 2016, Langer became interim coach for the Australian team while then coach Darren Lehmann took leave to scout for the Ashes and away matches late in 2016. In a fan poll conducted by the CA in 2017, he was named in the country&#x27;s best Ashes XI in the last 40 years.

On 3 May 2018, Langer was announced as coach of the Australian national cricket team, following a ball tampering scandal which led to the resignation of Darren Lehmann. His four-year term began on 22 May 2018.

On 4 February 2022, Langer announced his resignation as head coach of the Australia men&#x27;s team. His contract was set to expire in June 2022, and he turned down a short-term extension.

== International career ==

=== 1993–2000 ===
Langer made his Test debut against the West Indies at the Adelaide Oval, in January 1993. He received a rough welcome against an in-form West Indian bowling attack, including being hit on the back of the head by his very first ball in Test cricket, delivered by Ian Bishop, who went on to become a close friend in later life. Along with the rest of the Australian team, he took numerous blows from their pace bowlers. After only managing to score 20 in the first innings, Langer top-scored for Australia with 54 in the second, a famous chase by Australia that fell just 2 runs short. In the fifth and final Test of the series, Langer only managed to score 11 runs between his two innings in a match that was dominated by the bowling of Curtly Ambrose and Ian Bishop.

He retained his place for the following tour of New Zealand. After decent but not awe-inspiring totals in the first two Tests (63 &amp; 24), Langer suffered the indignity of getting a pair in the third Test, falling for a duck in both innings. He was subsequently dropped, and other than a few scattered appearances did not return to the Australian Test team until October 1998, for the tour of Pakistan.

In November 1999 at Bellerive Oval in Hobart, he shared a match-winning 238-run partnership with Adam Gilchrist to rescue Australia from 126/5 chasing a victory target of 369 against Pakistan. The century scored in this innings was scored in 388 minutes, an Australian record for the slowest century.

=== 2001–2002 ===
Langer was a number three batsman until 2001 when he was dropped after failing to convert a series of starts during Australia&#x27;s 2–1 loss in India. During the second Test in Kolkata, he bowled a single over when V. V. S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid defied the Australian attack for the entirety of the fourth day, forcing captain Steve Waugh to try almost all his players as bowlers; it was the only time Langer ever bowled at Test level. Shortly after though, he replaced Michael Slater as an opening batsman for the final 2001 Ashes series Test at The Oval where he celebrated his return with a century. He did not get dropped again and as an opening batsman he averaged 52.38 and scored 14 centuries in 44 matches; previously he scored 7 centuries in 41 matches at an average of 39.04. Langer returned to Australia in the 2002–03 Ashes series, where his very successful partnership with Matthew Hayden developed. In this series, Langer scored his top score of 250 against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

=== 2003–2007 ===

Langer personally outscored the entire Pakistan side in the Perth Test of 2004. He scored 191 and 97 while Pakistan made 179 and 72. It was the first occasion of a player being dismissed in both the 190s and 90s in a Test.

He captained the Prime Minister&#x27;s XI in December 2005 in their match against the West Indies.

In the 2005 Ashes series, Langer top-scored for an unsuccessful Australian team, with 391 in the series. His top score was 105, scored in the final test.

After this, pressure was mounting on the opening partnership of Hayden and Langer. Calls were coming to have the pair replaced by a younger duo, that would ensure the future and stability of the team to come. However, the partnership had support from the Australian selectors and was only disrupted in the 2006 Summer series when Langer was out with injury. He was replaced by Mike Hussey and Phil Jaques for two tests.

Langer then suffered a number of injuries, increasing the pressure on selectors to drop him for rising star Phil Jaques. Langer was selected over Jaques for the 2007 Ashes series, which turned out to be his last. Langer scored an 80 and a century in the first test, but it was slim pickings to follow for him.

Despite success in the Australian Test team, he did not get recalled to the one-day team, even after he was named as the domestic ING Cup&#x27;s player of the season in 2002/03.

=== Retirement ===
On 1 January 2007, Langer announced his retirement from Test cricket after the fifth Ashes Test against England, starting at the Sydney Cricket Ground the following day. In doing so, he joined Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath who had both announced their retirements earlier in the month, and it came only three matches after the surprise departure of Damien Martyn. He came to the decision during the previous match in Melbourne, having earlier decided against retiring after the tour of South Africa to help Australia reclaim the Ashes. He said of his decision: &quot;Everyone keeps saying &#x27;you&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s time&#x27;. Well, at one o&#x27;clock two days ago I knew it was time – it just came to me.&quot;

Despite his retirement from international cricket, Langer opted to continue to play first-class cricket, with Somerset announcing on the same day that Langer had agreed to return to the English county in 2007 as captain. Langer had said during his retirement announcement that he was relishing returning to Somerset: &quot;There&#x27;s an amazing challenge at Somerset. They&#x27;re at the bottom of everything, and I&#x27;ve got a great regard for the coach over there and I&#x27;m looking forward to that challenge.&quot; Langer also stayed on with Western Australia for a final season in 2007–08.

==List of international centuries==
Langer scored his first Test century against Pakistan at Peshawar in October 1998, scoring 116. He scored his final Test century against England at The Gabba in November 2006. His highest Test score is 250, scored against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in December 2002.

Langer never made a century in the ODI format; his highest score was 36, which he made against India at Sharjah in 1994.

== Domestic career ==

=== Western Australia ===
Langer was the captain of the Western Warriors until the end of the 2006/2007 season. He became the highest run-scorer for Western Australia in 4-day matches, after passing Tom Moody&#x27;s old record of 8853 runs on 5 December 2007 against Tasmania at Bellerive Oval. On 5 March 2008, Langer announced his retirement from Australian first-class domestic cricket. Earlier in the year, Langer had announced his retirement from the Australian domestic one-day cricket. However, Langer said that he would play another season for Somerset in county cricket. Langer played for Western Australia in a career spanning 17 years, leaving as the highest run-scorer in Western Australia&#x27;s history.

=== County Cricket ===
Langer played county cricket for Middlesex County Cricket Club from 1998 to 2000, captaining the side in 2000. In his first season, he scored his maiden century in English domestic cricket in superb fashion with 233 not out against Somerset at Lord&#x27;s, in the same match that he was awarded his county cap. He went on to score centuries in his next two County Championship matches, and achieved 1,000 runs for the season after only eight matches. He finished the season with the second highest runs total and batting average in the Championship, behind John Crawley on both counts.

In June 2006 it was announced that he would join Somerset later that month for six weeks, while fellow countryman Dan Cullen was on duty with Australia A. On 20 July 2006, he made his highest first-class score of 342 playing for Somerset in a County Championship match against Surrey at the Woodbridge Road ground in Guildford. This was also the highest score ever by a Somerset batsman, breaking the record of Sir Viv Richards who made 322 against Warwickshire at Taunton in 1985, and is the 10th highest score in a first-class match in England. During his six-week spell at the club, Langer also enjoyed particular success in the Twenty20 competition, topping the batting charts along with fellow Australian Cameron White.

On 20 April 2007 he became the first Somerset player to score two triple centuries in the County Championship when he hit 315 against Middlesex in a match noted for its batting. Responding to a Middlesex first innings of 600, Somerset set a new ground record at the County Ground, Taunton with 850–7 declared. On 19 September 2007 it was announced that Langer would stay with Somerset (as captain) for the 2008 season. In 15 first-class matches for the county in 2007, Langer scored 1215 runs at 57.85 and a further 764 in one-day competitions.

Early in the 2008 season, Langer and Marcus Trescothick put on a 272-second wicket partnership during the second innings against Hampshire at the County Ground, Taunton; falling just 18 short of the 1924 ground record.

On 23 July 2009, playing his 615th innings, he surpassed Sir Donald Bradman as the leading Australian first-class run scorer when he scored his 86th century while playing Worcestershire. At the end of the 2009 season, Langer announced that he would not be returning to Taunton in a playing capacity the following season, and retiring from all competitive cricket. He commented in an interview with BBC Somerset that he was in discussions to potentially return at some point to the county in the future in a coaching capacity. Langer played his last home game in English domestic cricket on 27 September 2009, captaining Somerset against Durham in the Nat West Pro40. A game which Somerset lost by two runs. Langer&#x27;s last act as Somerset captain was to lead the side to the second stage of the 2009 Twenty20 Champions League.

==Career best performances==
== Post-playing career ==
Langer through to the end of his career remained publicly undecided about what he wanted to do after his retirement. Speculation hence rose in the media with suggestions of a coaching position with Middlesex, and an open invitation to return to Somerset in some capacity. In November 2009, Cricket Australia announced the appointment of Langer as assistant coach of their Test team under national boss Tim Nielsen, as a batting coach and mentor. In November 2012, Langer was appointed to the position of senior coach of Western Australia and the Perth Scorchers, after the resignation of Lachlan Stevens, with a contract until the end of the 2015–16 season.

In July 2017, Langer was appointed to the board of the West Coast Eagles football club.

In May 2018, Langer was announced as the coach of the Australian national cricket team, and then in October 2019, Andrew McDonald was appointed as his assistant coach. In 2019, he coached Australia to the semi-finals of the 2019 Cricket World Cup, losing to England by 8 wickets. It was noted before the game that Langer had got Australia to walk barefoot around the edge of Edgbaston before the match in a bid to capture &quot;positive energy coming out of the earth&quot;.

Langer was announced as the head coach of Lucknow Super Giants in July 2023 replacing Andy Flower.

== Famous duels and partners ==

In his 100th test, Langer was hit by a bouncer from Makhaya Ntini (South Africa v Australia, 3rd Test, Johannesburg, 2nd day). He suffered concussion and underwent scans in hospital. Despite the risk of being killed if hit on the head again, Langer padded up to bat in the second innings if it was required of him. Captain Ricky Ponting wrote in his diary that because of Langer&#x27;s intention of defying medical advice, he would have had to declare the run chase and forfeit the match to prevent Langer from facing the bowling. Brett Lee scored the winning runs before Langer was needed.

Langer&#x27;s most notable opening batting partner was Matthew Hayden. The opening pair represented Australia in more than 100 Test innings. The pair made 5654 runs while batting together in partnerships, with an average of 51 runs per partnership; only Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes of the West Indies have scored more Test runs as a partnership, with 6482.

== Personal life ==
Langer is an alumnus of Perth schools Newman College and Aquinas College. The Justin Langer Shield is played between year sevens of Newman and Aquinas.

He is the nephew of Rob Langer, a left-handed batsman for Western Australia during the 1970s and 1980s. Langer is married to his high school sweetheart, Sue, and has four daughters. When resident in Somerset, the family stayed in a rented home in Hatch Beauchamp: &quot;Mate, I say this with the utmost affection and respect, but it&#x27;s like living in the olden days.&quot;

He is a martial artist and has obtained the rank of Shodan-Ho (probationary 1st degree black belt) in Zen Do Kai.

Langer has written five books. His first was entitled &quot;From Outback to Outfield: A Revealing Diary of Life on the County Cricket Circuit&quot;. His second, an autobiography released after his return from rock bottom in 2001, entitled &quot;The Power of Passion&quot;. He also released a book with Steve Harmison entitled &quot;Ashes Frontline: The Ashes War Diaries of Steve Harmison and Justin Langer&quot; about the 2006–07 Ashes series in Australia. He also wrote &quot;Seeing the Sunrise&quot; which has been described as &quot;a handbook for overcoming self-doubt, for revelling in success, for aiming high. It is about mastering physical and mental goals, enjoying victories and fighting adversity.&quot; His most recent book is &quot;Keeping My Head: A Life in Cricket&quot;.

Melbourne rock band Telemachus Brown wrote a song about Langer entitled &quot;(Wrong about) Justin Langer&quot;. It was released on their 2006 EP &quot;Medicine Songs&quot; and was a hit for the band on Melbourne university radio. The song could be a reference to Langer&#x27;s transformation from being an average Test batsman in his early career to a world-class opener later in his career.

Langer is a devout Catholic, as was his Australian opening batsman partner Matthew Hayden. Politically, he is conservative, an admirer of former Liberal Australian Prime Minister John Howard, and considered running for office as a member of the Liberal Party of Australia.

<text>Charles Bannerman (3 July 1851 – 20 August 1930) was an English-born Australian cricketer. A right-handed batsman, he represented Australia in three Test matches between 1877 and 1879. At the domestic level, he played for the New South Wales cricket team. Later, he became an umpire.

He is most famous for facing the first ball ever bowled in Test cricket, scoring the first run in Test cricket and making the first Test century. This innings of 165 remains the highest individual share of a completed team innings in Test cricket history, despite more than 2,500 Test matches being played since that first Test. Ironically in another first, he was forced to retire hurt; when a ball broke his finger.

==Early life==
Bannerman was born in Woolwich, Kent, England to William Bannerman and his wife Margaret. Not long afterwards the family migrated to New South Wales, Australia, where he joined the Warwick Cricket Club in Sydney. At the club he was trained by William Caffyn, a former Surrey cricketer who was then a representative of New South Wales. Bannerman started playing professional cricket in 1871, before making his first-class debut for New South Wales. In his first match, against Victoria, he made 32 and 3 runs.

==Test matches==

Bannerman played in the first three matches that were later designated as Test matches. The first of these, between Australia and England was held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in March 1877 and Australia batted first. Bannerman opened the Australian innings and is thus retrospectively deemed to have had the honour of facing the first ball ever bowled in Test cricket (the bowler being England&#x27;s Alfred Shaw) and scoring the first ever run in Test cricket. Dropped before he reached double figures, he went on to score 126 on the first day and then added 39 on the second day to reach 165 when he was forced to retire hurt, his finger having been broken by a ball from George Ulyett. Only Harry Jupp (England) scoring 54 on the second day bettered Charles Bannerman&#x27;s 39 runs on the second day. Again retrospectively, his innings was the first-ever Test century. It remains the highest score by an Australian batsman on debut and his 165 runs, out of Australia&#x27;s total of 245, is still the highest proportion (67.35%) of a completed innings in a Test match. No other Australian exceeded 20 in either innings, as Australia won the match by 45 runs. For his feat, spectators at the match collected £83 7s 6d to present to him.

Bannerman played in two more matches now recognised as Tests, the second in 1877 and one in 1879. His Test record is 239 runs at an average of 59.75.
At the end of the first Test on 19 March 1877 Charles Bannerman had become the first Test batsman to score 150 runs in a Test career. He finished the Test on 169. In terms of batting partnerships. Charles Bannerman and Nat Thomson were the first ever international batting partnership (the first ever international opening batting partnership) and they made 2 runs together before Nat Thomson was bowled by Allen Hill for 1.

Charles Bannerman was selected for the 2nd Test of the 1876–77 Series. He opened the batting at No. 2 once again partnering Nat Thomson. He and Thomson added 29 for the first Wicket when Thomson was dismissed for 18. Charles was then joined by Australia&#x27;s wicket-keeper, batting at No. 3, Jack Blackham. However, after batting for 55 minutes he was bowled by Allen Hill for 10. He had now increased the record career score to 179. On the 3rd day (3 April 1877) Charles batted at No. 3. He came in when Australia were 88 for 1 to partner Nat Thomson. He partnered Thomson and Thomas Kelly. After just 13 minutes when on 30, he hit George Ulyett&#x27;s bowling to Harry Jupp. He became the first, at that time, to score 200 runs in a career and now had scored 209.

On the first official Australian tour of England in 1878, Bannerman topped the averages and scored the first century by an Australian in England, but no matches recognised as Tests were played on this tour. He had a career first-class batting record of 1,687 runs at 21.62. He did not represent Australia again, officially because of ill-health, but it was suggested that he could not cope with celebrity status, and that gambling debts and alcohol left him impoverished. He continued to play for New South Wales until 1888.

==Umpiring==
Between 1887 and 1902, Bannerman stood as umpire in 12 Test matches in Australia. His first match was between Australia and England at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) from 28 to 31 January 1887. England won by 13 runs after scoring only 45 runs in their first innings. His colleague was Elisha Rawlinson, standing in his only Test match. Bannerman&#x27;s last match, at Melbourne in the 1901–02 season, was also a close low-scoring affair with Australia winning by 32 runs. On this occasion his colleague was Bob Crockett standing in his first season as a Test umpire. In two of the matches in which Charles Bannerman officiated, his brother Alick was a player, but no accusations of bias could be made as Alick scored only 23 runs in four innings.

In the fifth Test of the 1897–98 series, Bannerman turned down a confident lbw appeal against Australian batsman Joe Darling when the match was in a tense situation. The lbw was reportedly &quot;obvious&quot; but the bowler had run in front of the umpire who was unsighted and had to reject the appeal. Darling, then on 50, went on to score 160 and Australia won the match. After the game Bannerman lodged an official complaint against the English wicket-keeper who had accused him of cheating, and the player was rebuked.

In all, Bannerman umpired 58 first-class matches between 1887 and 1905. In December 1892, he and George Searcy umpired the first-ever Sheffield Shield match. His last matches were the two played by the Australian touring team against New Zealand in Christchurch and Wellington in March 1905.

==Benefit and family==
In the 1922–23 season, the first radio broadcast of a cricket match anywhere in the world was a match played as a benefit for Charles Bannerman, from which he received £490.

He died in Sydney, survived by his widow Mary Ann, née King, two sons and three daughters; three of the children were the issue of his first marriage to Ellen, née Neale.

<text>Deepal Warakagoda is a prominent Sri Lankan ornithologist. His early working career was in electronics, but since his childhood he has studied the island&#x27;s bird fauna and for many years he has been working as a professional guide for birding and wildlife tours of the island. He is mostly known for his records as one of the few ornithologist who has seen the greatest amount of species in Sri Lanka. Deepal Warakagoda is also one of the major roles of the Ceylon Birds Club . He works with great passion to educate on birdlife in Sri Lanka and its rich diversity of fauna in soundscapes of natural habitats, and their conservation , and has his own career experience for over 30 years .

== Discoveries ==
He discovered a new species of bird endemic to Sri Lanka, the Serendib Scops owl. His expertise in vocalizations had enabled him to realize that an owl he heard calling near Kitulgala rain forest was an unknown species, and he later saw this bird in January 2001 in the Sinharaja rain forest with assistance of a few. He surrounded the bird&#x27;s habitat and took photographs while it was roosting under a thick bush. This new-found species of scops owl is now on the IUCN Red List. He has also identified (each for the first time) 15 new migrant species of birds in Sri Lanka, and has published a large number of articles on the avifauna of Sri Lanka.

== Creations and experiences ==
Warakagoda is Sri Lanka&#x27;s foremost sound recordist in natural history subjects, and has produced and published the only comprehensive audio guide to the island&#x27;s birds (on tape and CD). He has an unmatched knowledge of Sri Lanka&#x27;s bird songs and calls. His audio recordings of the island&#x27;s distinct bird species have played a major role in the recognition of several of them as endemic to Sri Lanka in the book &quot;Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide&quot; (2005) by Pamela C. Rasmussen and John C. Anderton.

Although best known for his knowledge of the avifauna of Sri Lanka, and expertise in finding and identifying birds, his keen interest extends to the island&#x27;s other wildlife too.

Warakagoda founded the Drongo Nature Sounds Library in 1997, the only one of its kind in Sri Lanka, which now holds the largest collection of audio recordings of individual species of fauna and soundscapes of natural habitats of the country. He was joint secretary of the Ceylon Bird Club, and is a national coordinator in Sri Lanka for the Asian Waterbird Census.
He is a founder of Bird and Wildlife Team, a company specializing in natural history tours of Sri Lanka and India, and works as one of its senior tour leaders. He is also a leading tour guide of the organization &#x27;Wings birds&#x27;

He is currently working on several new publications in the print and audio/video media, for the betterment of education of the country&#x27;s bird fauna and bird watching in the nature-based tourism industry in Sri Lanka.

<text>Dennis Keith Lillee, (born 18 July 1949) is a retired Australian cricketer rated as the &quot;outstanding fast bowler of his generation&quot;. Lillee formed a new ball partnership with Jeff Thomson which is recognised as one of the greatest bowling pairs of all time.

In the early part of his career Lillee was an extremely fast bowler, but a number of stress fractures in his back almost ended his career. Taking on a strict fitness regime, he fought his way back to full fitness, eventually returning to international cricket. By the time of his retirement from international cricket in 1984 he had become the world record holder for most Test wickets with 355, and had firmly established himself as one of the most recognisable and renowned Australian sportsmen of all time. He was a part of the Australian squad which finished as runners-up at the 1975 Cricket World Cup.

In a fan poll conducted by the CA in 2017, he was named in the country&#x27;s best Ashes XI of the previous 40 years. On 17 December 2009, Lillee was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

==Cricket career==
Aged 20, Lillee made his first-class debut for Western Australia in 1969–70 and impressed with his raw pace. Lillee took 32 wickets in his debut season to be WA&#x27;s leading wicket-taker.
At the end of the season, he toured New Zealand with an Australian second team and took 18 wickets at 16.44 average.

===Early career===
The following season, Lillee made his Test debut in the Sixth Test at Adelaide in the 1970–71 Ashes series, taking 5/84 from 28.3 eight-ball overs. His first Test wicket was John Edrich, caught by Keith Stackpole for 130, but it was not until the Seventh Test at Sydney that John Hampshire became the first batsman to be &quot;caught Marsh, bowled Lillee&quot;. The following season, during the series against the Rest of the World XI, which had been arranged in place of the cancelled series against South Africa, Lillee announced himself during the first innings of the second unofficial &quot;Test&quot; match at his home ground in Perth, destroying a powerful batting lineup that included Garry Sobers, Clive Lloyd, Rohan Kanhai and Sunil Gavaskar to finish with 8/29 in only 7 overs, which would remain his career-best bowling figures in an innings. Sobers would later comment that as far as particular spells went, Lillee&#x27;s bowling that day was the fastest he had ever faced. Lillee then backed up with 4/63 in the second innings to end with match figures of 12/92 as Australia won by an innings.

Lillee followed this performance with a successful Ashes tour of England in 1972, when he &quot;asserted himself as a great bowler&quot;. In a series that ended 2–2, he was the outstanding bowler on either team, taking 31 wickets at an average of 17.67. This earned him selection as one of &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; five Cricketers of the Year for 1973.

John Snow believes that Lillee saw reduced effectiveness after being overbowled by Western Australia and Australia in 1971–73.

===Back injury===
During a Test against Pakistan in the 1972–73 season, Lillee felt sharp pain in his back for the first time, but continued to play. On the tour of the West Indies that followed, Lillee broke down completely and was diagnosed with stress fracture in his lower vertebrae. Forced out of cricket, he spent six weeks during the winter of 1973 wearing a plaster cast that encased his entire torso. After the removal of the cast, he played club cricket for Perth as a specialist batsman. He returned to the bowling crease towards the end of the season, guiding Perth Cricket Club to the final at the WACA Ground.

There was speculation that his bowling career was nearly over. Lillee persevered, undergoing an intensive physiotherapy routine, formulated by sports scientist Frank Pyke, and remodelling his bowling action. In 1974–75, he returned to Test cricket for the Ashes series and was paired with New South Wales fast bowler Jeff Thomson to form one of the most effective opening bowling combinations in Test cricket. The pair was a major factor in Australia&#x27;s emphatic 4–1 victory. In 1975, the University of Western Australia timed Lillee&#x27;s bowling at 154.8 km/h.

===Lillee and Thomson===
The impact of the Lillee/Thomson bowling attack was summarised during the 1974–75 Ashes series, when Sydney newspaper &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; ran a photo of Lillee and Thomson with a cartoon caption underneath that read:
Lillee toured England again in 1975. During the inaugural World Cup he captured eight wickets in five matches, including 5/34 against Pakistan at Leeds, which was the first five wicket haul in ODIs. His aggressive bowling was not always suited to the run-containing style required in the one-day game. In the subsequent four-Test series against England, Lillee claimed 21 wickets as his team finished winners by 1–0. With the bat, he made 73 not out at Lord&#x27;s to rescue Australia from a difficult situation.

Another 27 wickets (at 26.37 average) followed in the summer of 1975–76 against the West Indies. At this time, Lillee was one of the most marketable personalities in Australia, but he was frustrated by the small amounts that he earned from the game. Outspoken in his opinions, he came into conflict with the game&#x27;s administrators. Lillee suggested that a made-for-television exhibition series could be played each season with profits given to the players. John Cornell, his manager, took this idea to Kerry Packer, who later fashioned it into World Series Cricket (WSC).

An injury to Thomson early in 1976–77 forced Lillee to take on a greater workload during the six Tests of the season. He responded with 47 wickets including match figures of 10/135 against Pakistan at the MCG and 11/123 at Auckland against New Zealand. In the Centenary Test, his 11/165 was the
decisive performance in Australia&#x27;s victory. However, the extra exertion created &quot;hot spots&quot; in his back and not wanting to reaggravate his previous condition, he made himself unavailable for the 1977 tour of England.

===World Series Cricket===

Remaining in Australia to do television commentary on the tour, Lillee was isolated from the furore in England surrounding the plans for the breakaway professional competition, WSC. He was announced as one of the WSC players in May 1977. The Lillee image and personality were key components in WSC&#x27;s innovative marketing of their games. However, he struggled on-field during the first season of WSC and in the winter of 1978 made further adjustments to his action. He also spent time working with ex–World professional sprint champion Austin Robertson, improving his running technique and fitness. In nine &quot;Supertests&quot; (four in Australia and five in the West Indies) during 1978–79, Lillee captured 46 wickets at 22.5 average, with a best of 7/23 against the West Indies XI at the SCG.

Cutting down his pace and the length of his run up, Lillee now concentrated on moving the ball off the seam with an occasional faster or slower ball for variation. During the season of his return to official cricket, Lillee collected 35 Test wickets in six matches against the West Indies and England, and gave Australia&#x27;s bowling attack stability while the selectors experimented with the team. In the World Series Cup, his changed style helped to bring him 20 wickets (at 12.7 average) in eight ODIs, including 4/12 against West Indies and 4/28 against England, both at the SCG. However, the tour of Pakistan that followed was ruined for Lillee by flat batting pitches prepared by local curators to blunt his effectiveness. He managed just three wickets in three Tests.

===Australian and world records===

Against New Zealand and India in 1980–81, Lillee took 37 wickets in six Tests and was the leading bowler in the World Series Cup for the second successive season. He contributed 25 wickets to Australia&#x27;s first victory in the competition. After breaking Richie Benaud&#x27;s Australian Test record of 248 wickets, Lillee toured England in 1981 when his preparation was compromised by a viral infection. A return of 39 Test wickets (at 22.30) for series was the best of his career and he won man of the match awards in the first and last Tests. Lillee formed a penetrative partnership with fellow West Australian Terry Alderman, who claimed an Australian record of 41 wickets. Despite possessing this potent attack, Australia lost the series by 1–3 when Ian Botham turned in a series of brilliant individual performances. Yet, these efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowling Rankings for the year 1981.

Granted a testimonial for 1981–82, Lillee&#x27;s season got off to a poor start when he was involved in the infamous incident with Javed Miandad (see below) in the first Test of the summer. Suspended for two ODIs, the level of his on-field aggression was again criticised. However, he continued taking wickets: 15 in three Tests against Pakistan and 16 in three Tests against the West Indies. Against the latter, his 7/83 and 3/44 at the MCG in the first Test took him past the world record for the most Test wickets held by Lance Gibbs. His ODI season was less successful, with 12 wickets in 12 games. His best effort was 2/18 in ten overs against the West Indies during the third final of the World Series Cup, the only match in the final series Australia was able to win.

===Retirement===
Bowling as a first-change, Lillee had an uneventful tour of New Zealand in March and April 1982 before suffering a serious knee injury in the first Ashes Test at the WACA Ground in November of the same year. This forced him to miss the rest of the series and Australia&#x27;s 2–1 victory, which reclaimed the Ashes. Returning to the team for the latter stages of the World Series Cup, Lillee was no longer an automatic choice to take the new ball. Nevertheless, his 11 wickets in six ODIs helped Australia win the tournament with a victory over New Zealand in the final.

His wicket-taking capacity was diminishing. During Australia&#x27;s brief tour of Sri Lanka in 1983, Lillee took three wickets at Kandy in the inaugural Test between the two nations and went wicket-less in two ODIs. Later in the year, his ODI career finished during the third World Cup in England when he conceded 52 runs from 12 overs in the match against the West Indies at Lord&#x27;s. Dropped from the team, Lillee acknowledged that he was not fully fit.

During the first two Tests of 1983–84 against Pakistan at Perth, he took only one wicket and looked set to be dropped from the Test team as well. Fate intervened when Carl Rackemann, the man of the match from the second Test, was injured. This allowed Lillee to play the rest of the Test series and he finished with 20 wickets at 31.65. Along with Greg Chappell he announced his retirement during the final Test at Sydney, and took eight wickets, including a wicket with his last delivery in the match.

===Caught Marsh bowled Lillee===

Throughout his career, whilst playing for both Australia and Western Australia, Lillee was also famous for his partnership with wicket-keeper Rod Marsh. The scorecard entry &#x27;c Marsh b Lillee&#x27; appeared 95 times in Tests, a partnership record between wicket-keeper and bowler that is yet to be broken. Coincidentally, both players ended their careers with 355 Test dismissals; Marsh took 343 catches and had 12 stumpings. In 1988 the Western Australian Cricket Association honoured the two players by naming a new grandstand at the WACA Ground the &quot;Lillee-Marsh Stand&quot;.


==Controversy==

===Aluminium bat incident===
During a Test at the WACA Ground in December 1979 between Australia and England, Lillee went to the crease with an aluminium bat manufactured by a company owned by a friend. There were no rules against using such a bat, but trouble began when Lillee hit a ball that went for three runs. Australian captain Greg Chappell thought that the ball should have gone for a four, and instructed Rodney Hogg to deliver a conventional wooden bat to Lillee. As this was happening, English captain Mike Brearley complained to the umpires that using such a bat was against the spirit of the game and that it was damaging the ball.

Lillee refused to change the bat. Brearley, Lillee, and the umpires held an animated discussion for almost ten minutes, before Chappell insisted that Lillee should change bats. In a fit of pique, Lillee threw &quot;the offending lump of metal fully 40 yards towards the pavilion&quot;, and grudgingly took the wooden bat. He was not disciplined by the ACB for this incident. After the game, sales of the bat skyrocketed for a few months, before the laws of the game were amended, specifying that bats had to be made from wood.

===Betting===
At Headingley on the 1981 tour of England, Australia was in such a strong position at one stage of the third Test that bookmakers at the ground were offering odds of 500–1 against an England victory. These odds were flashed on the scoreboard during a break in the game and noticed by the Australian players. Lillee and Rod Marsh believed that the odds were so ludicrous that, via a third party, they each put a small wager on the outcome, later describing their actions as a &quot;joke&quot;. Between them, they collected 7,500 pounds when England pulled off a comeback victory. Both men openly discussed the incident and received no official censure or sanction, although some criticised their actions. There has never been a suggestion that the bets compromised their efforts in the game. The issue has been re-examined in modern times following the match-fixing scandals that have plagued international cricket since the mid-1990s.

==After retirement==
Lillee made a brief comeback to first-class cricket in 1987–88 for Tasmania, taking a wicket with his first ball. In 1988, he played eight matches for English county team Northamptonshire before suffering a severe ankle injury. In his autobiography, Lillee claimed that he played again as a preparation for a possible comeback to the Australian team that was suggested by the then captain Allan Border.

Since retirement Lillee has dedicated himself to mentoring and coaching young bowlers, most notably Brett Lee, Shaun Tait, and Mitchell Johnson. He was also associated with MRF Pace Foundation in India. Lillee continued playing cricket until 1999 for the traditional Australian Cricket Board President&#x27;s XI match against touring sides at Lilac Hill. In his final match he took three wickets and played alongside his son Adam.

From 2004 until his sudden resignation in September 2015, Lillee was the president of the Western Australian Cricket Association.

<doc id="894417" wikidata="Q5212475" url="?curid=894417" title="Damien Martyn">
<text>Damien Richard Martyn (born 21 October 1971) is an Australian cricket commentator and former cricketer, who played Tests and ODIs. He played for the national team sporadically in 1992–1994 before becoming a regular ODI player from 1999 to 2000 and a regular Test player in 2000 until his retirement in late 2006. He was primarily a right-handed middle-order batsman with a &#x27;classical&#x27; technique, known in particular for his elegant strokemaking square of the wicket on the off-side and through the covers. Martyn was a member of the Australian team that won two consecutive world titles in a row: the 1999 Cricket World Cup, the 2003 Cricket World Cup, as well as being a member of the team that won the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy.

Martyn was also an occasional medium-pacer and distinguished fieldsman primarily in the covers who was capable of creating spectacular run-outs. He also very occasionally kept wicket at first-class level. He was named man of the series in the Border–Gavaskar Trophy in 2004, to help Australia defeat India on the subcontinent for the first time in more than 30 years, and was named in early 2005 as the Australian Test Player of the Year at the annual Allan Border Medal presentations.

==Domestic career==
Martyn moved with his family to Perth, Western Australia at the age of three, and was educated at Girrawheen Senior High School, before being selected for the Australian Cricket Academy in Adelaide in 1990. He made his first class debut for Western Australia the following season, in which he scored 822 runs at 51.37.

After returning to the domestic arena Martyn was appointed as captain of Western Australia in the 1994/95 season at the age of 23, the youngest player to have been given the honour. He also captained Australia A in the international ODI tournament of the same season. The following season, he relinquished the captaincy to Tom Moody, in order to concentrate on his batting.

On 1 September 2007, it was reported in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; that Martyn had joined the break-away Indian Cricket League. However, since then he has pulled out of the event due to the birth of his first son, Ryder, but rejoined the ICL for 2008.

On 19 January 2010, Martyn was signed for US$100,000 to play for the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.

==International career==
Noted for his daring and sometimes cavalier strokeplay, Martyn was selected to make his Test debut against the West Indies in November, 1992 at the Gabba, a surprise replacement for Dean Jones. He batted in the middle-order, scoring 36 and 15. He played in all Tests in that season, apart from the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval where he was replaced by fellow Western Australian Justin Langer after sustaining an injury before the match.

However, his performances were unconvincing, totalling 168 runs at 28.16 for the series, passing 50 only once with an unbeaten 67* at the MCG. Martyn was also a member of the ODI squad in that season, playing less regularly in only four of eleven matches, and aggregating 45 runs at 22.5.

===Struggling form===
Martyn was subsequently dropped from the Test team in the early 1993 tour to New Zealand, until being recalled for the Third Test at Eden Park, Auckland after Mark Waugh was dropped, scoring 74. Martyn also played in some of the subsequent ODIs on the New Zealand tour as well as on the 1993 Ashes tour to England, but was dropped from the Test team after Waugh scored centuries in the warm-up matches and had been the leading run scorer in the New Zealand ODIs. Waugh was third in the Test batting averages, confining Martyn to playing in tour matches against county teams. Martyn was given another chance in the 1993–94 Australian season when Steve Waugh tore a hamstring and Martyn played in the Boxing Day and New Year&#x27;s Tests at the MCG and SCG respectively. Although he managed 59 in the first innings of a low scoring match in Sydney, it was his performance in the second innings which blighted his reputation for many years into the future. With Australia stumbling while chasing a small target of 117 against South Africa, Martyn had trouble scoring, with an unconvincing 6 from 59 balls in almost two hours as he and Craig McDermott took the total from 8–75 to within sight of victory at 8–110. He then attempted an airborne cover-drive off Allan Donald and was caught, and Australia lost the Test. Martyn was heavily criticised by the media who blamed him for the defeat. He played three more ODIs in that season, before being dropped upon Waugh&#x27;s return from injury. Although Waugh would have reprised his position in any case, Martyn lost his position as the reserve batsman and was dropped from subsequent national squads altogether. He would not play ODI cricket again until 1997 and Tests until 2000.

=== Late career ===
He re-appeared at the start of the millennium when he replaced an injured Ricky Ponting on the tour to New Zealand in early 2000. Despite topping the averages in New Zealand he made way for Ponting for the home series against the West Indies in 2000/01. He played one test during that summer, replacing an injured Steve Waugh for Australia&#x27;s victory at Adelaide where he remained not out in both innings.

He was selected on Australia&#x27;s tour to India in 2001 and was considered unlucky not to replace a struggling Ponting. His chance to consolidate a permanent position in the side came during the 2001 Ashes tour where he replaced fellow West Australian Justin Langer in the first test. He posted his maiden test century in the first test at Edgbaston. He was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year as a result of his performances in The Ashes in the summer of 2001.

Martyn subsequently put in regular appearances for Australia, becoming integral to the middle-order and eventually filling the void at no. 4 left by Mark Waugh&#x27;s international retirement. His best form came over a twelve-month period beginning in March 2004 where he scored two crucial centuries to help Australia to a 3–0 series whitewash in Sri Lanka. He was then man of the series in India when Australia claimed their first series victory on Indian soil in over 30 years. He made two centuries and narrowly missed out on becoming the first Australian batsman since Don Bradman to make three centuries in three innings when he was dismissed for 97 in the second innings of the third test. Two centuries at home against Pakistan over the 2004/05 season and another in New Zealand in 2005 rounded out a stellar 12 months in which Martyn had made 1608 runs at an average of 61.84 in 12 months including 7 test centuries.

Martyn was presented with the McGilvray Medal in 2005 as the ABC&#x27;s Test cricketer of the year as well as being adjudged Test Player of the Year at the 2005 Allan Border Medal.

Following a poor Ashes tour of England in 2005, where he recorded a total of 178 runs at an average of 19.77, Martyn was dropped from the Australian Test side to play in the ICC Super Series 2005. However, he was retained in the ODI side over the 2005/06 summer.

He was recalled to the Test squad at the expense of Brad Hodge for the three-Test series in South Africa in March and April 2006. Chairman of Selectors Trevor Hohns cited his experience as the major reason for his recall. His contributions in the first two tests were minimal but he repaid the selectors&#x27; faith with an important century in the second innings of the third test that helped guide Australia to victory.

In the 2006 Champions Trophy Tournament, Martyn won back-to-back man of the match awards against England and India. He also played an important unbeaten innings in the final against the West Indies to help Australia win the tournament for the first time. He was Australia&#x27;s leading runscorer in the tournament.

=== Retirement ===
Martyn played in the first two Tests of the 2006/07 Ashes series, where he managed to score just 45 runs in three innings. Dismissed for only 5 playing a rash shot in Australia&#x27;s run chase in the second Test, his place in the side came under increasing scrutiny in the media, although he received several statements of support from members of the Australia team, notably Mike Hussey and Justin Langer.

Despite his poor form Martyn was widely expected to retain his place due to Shane Watson&#x27;s lack of fitness and the fact that the third test was to be played at the W.A.C.A. Ground, Martyn&#x27;s home ground. It came as a surprise when on 8 December 2006, Martyn announced his immediate retirement from all domestic and international cricket. Commenting on his decision, Martyn said: &quot;I would like to advise of my retirement from cricket, effective from today. I do so with a deep awareness of the opportunities that the game and Cricket Australia have provided for me.&quot; Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland insisted that Martyn had not been pushed and that Martyn was originally going to be named in the squad for the third Test.

==Records and achievements==
===International centuries===
Martyn scored a century (100 runs or more) on 13 occasions in Test cricket and 5 in One Day International (ODI) matches, but has not scored a century in Twenty20 international.

==== Test centuries ====
Martyn scored his first century, about 9 years after making his debut, in The Ashes, against England on 5 July 2001 at Edgbaston Cricket Ground, Birmingham scoring 105 runs in the process. His performance in the series earned him the Wisden cricketer of the year award for 2001. His highest score of 165 runs came against New Zealand on 18 March 2005 at Basin Reserve, Wellington. His last Test century was against South Africa on 31 March 2006 at The Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg where he scored 101 runs. Out of his 13 Test centuries, 8 has been scored on the first innings and the rest 5 in the second innings.

====ODI centuries ====
Martyn&#x27;s first ODI century came against New Zealand on 3 March 2000 at Eden Park, Auckland, he scored 116 and remained not out. A knock of 144 runs from 149 balls against Zimbabwe on 4 February 2001 at the WACA Ground, Perth is his highest ODI score. His last ODI century was against India on 1 November 2003 at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai where he scored 100 runs and also won the man of the match award.

<doc id="894421" wikidata="Q207101" url="?curid=894421" title="Sociolect">
<text>In sociolinguistics, a sociolect is a form of language (non-standard dialect, restricted register) or a set of lexical items used by a socioeconomic class, profession, age group, or other social group.

Sociolects involve both passive acquisition of particular communicative practices through association with a local community, as well as active learning and choice among speech or writing forms to demonstrate identification with particular groups. The term &quot;sociolect&quot; might refer to socially restricted dialects, but it is sometimes also treated as equivalent with the concept of register, or used as a synonym for &quot;jargon&quot; and &quot;slang&quot;.

Sociolinguists—people who study sociolects and language variation—define a sociolect by examining the social distribution of specific linguistic terms. For example, a sociolinguist would examine the use of the second person pronoun &quot;you&quot; within a given population. If one distinct social group used &quot;yous&quot; as the plural form of the pronoun, then this could indicate the existence of a sociolect. A sociolect is distinct from a regional dialect (regiolect) because social class, rather than geographical subdivision, substantiates the unique linguistic features.

==Overview==
A sociolect, defined by leading sociolinguist and philosopher Peter Trudgill, is &quot;a variety or lect which is thought of as being related to its speakers&#x27; social background rather than geographical background.&quot; This idea of a sociolect began with the commencement of dialectology, the study of different dialects in relation to society, which has been established in countries such as England for many years, but only recently has the field garnered more attention. However, as opposed to a dialect, the basic concept of a sociolect is that a person speaks in accordance with their social group whether it is with regard to one&#x27;s ethnicity, age, gender, etc. As William Labov once said, &quot;the sociolinguistic view ... is that we are programmed to learn to speak in ways that fit the general pattern of our communities.&quot; Therefore, what we are surrounded with in our environment determines how we speak; hence, our actions and associations.

==Distinguished from dialect==
The main distinction between sociolects (social dialects) and dialects proper (geographical dialects), which are often confused, is the settings in which they are created. A dialect&#x27;s main identifier is geography: a certain region uses specific phonological, morphosyntactic or lexical rules. Asif Agha expands the concept by stating that &quot;the case where the demographic dimension marked by speech are matters of geographic provenance alone, such as speaker&#x27;s birth locale, extended residence and the like&quot;. However, a sociolect&#x27;s main identifier is a socioeconomic class, age, gender, and/or ethnicity in a certain speech community.

An example of a dialectal difference, based on region, is the use of the words &quot;soda&quot; or &quot;pop&quot; and &quot;coke&quot; in different parts of the United States. As Thomas E. Murray states, &quot;&quot;coke&quot; is used generically by thousands of people, especially in the southern half of the country.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;pop&quot; is known to be a term that is used by many citizens in the northern half of the country.

An example of a sociolect difference, based on social grouping, is the zero copula in African American Vernacular English. It occurs in a specific ethnic group but in all areas of the United States. William Labov gives an example: &quot;he here&quot; instead of &quot;he&#x27;s here.&quot;

==Definitions==

Code switching is &quot;the process whereby bilingual or bidialectal speakers switch back and forth between one language or dialect and another within the same conversation&quot;.

Diglossia, associated with the American linguist Charles A. Ferguson, which describes a sociolinguistic situation such as those that obtain in Arabic-speaking countries and in German-speaking Switzerland. In such a diglossic community, the prestigious standard of &#x27;High&#x27; (or H) variety, which is linguistically related to but significantly different from the vernacular or &#x27;Low&#x27; (or L) varieties, has no native speakers.

Domain is &quot;different language, dialects, or styles are used in different social contexts&quot;.

Language attitudes are &quot;social in origin, but that they may have important effects on language behavior, being involved in acts of identity, and on linguistic change.&quot;

Linguistic variable is &quot;a linguistic unit...initially developed...in order to be able to handle linguistics variation. Variables may be lexical and grammatical, but are most often phonological&quot;. Example of British English (h) which is sometimes present and sometimes not.

Pragmatics is the meaning of a word in social context, while semantics has &quot;purely linguistic meaning&quot;.

Register is &quot;a language variety that is associated with a particular topic, subject, or activity...&quot; Usually, it is defined by vocabulary, but has grammatical features as well.

== Examples ==

===Tamil caste system===

The following is an example of the lexical distinction between the Mudaliyar and the Iyengar groups of the Tamil-speaking people in India. The Iyengar group is part of the Brahmin caste which is scholarly and higher in the caste hierarchy than the non-Brahmin or Mudaliyar, caste. The Mudaliyars use many of the same words for things that are differentiated within the Iyengars&#x27; speech. For example, as seen below, the difference between drinking water, water in general, and non-potable water is used by one word in the non-Brahmin caste and three separate words in the Brahmin caste. Furthermore, Agha references how the use of different speech reflects a &quot;departure from a group-internal norm&quot;. For example, if the non-Brahmin caste uses Brahmin terms in their mode of speech it is seen as self-raising, whereas if people within the Brahmin caste use non-Brahmin speech it is seen as pejoratives. Therefore, depending on which castes use certain words the pragmatics change. Hence, this speech system is determined by socioeconomic class and social context.

===Norwegian dialect-based sociolect===

Norwegian does not have a spoken standard and is heavily dependent on dialect variants. The following example shows the difference between the national written standard and a spoken variant, where the phonology and pronunciation differ. These are not sociolectic differences per se. As Agha states, &quot;Some lexical contrasts are due to the phonological difference (e.g., R makes more consonantal and vocalic distinctions than B), while others are due to the morphological difference (e.g., difference in plural suffixes and certain verb inflections) between two varieties.

=== Diglossia ===

The chart below gives an example of diglossia in Arabic-speaking nations and where it is used. Diglossia is defined by Mesthrie as &quot;[a] situation where two varieties of a language exist side by side&quot;. The Classical Arabic is known as الفصحى, or al-fuṣḥā, while the colloquial dialect depends on the country. For example, شامي, or šāmi, is spoken in Lebanon and parts of Syria. In many situations, there is a major lexical difference among words in the classical and colloquial speech, as well as pronunciation differences, such as a difference in short vowels, when the words are the same. Although a specific example of diglossia was not given, its social context is almost if not more important. For example, Halliday states that &quot;in areas with Diglossia, the link between language and success is apparent as the higher, classical register is learned through formal education&quot;.

===African American Vernacular English (AAVE)===

Below is an example of African American Vernacular English, showing the addition of the verbal -s not just on third-person singular verbs in the present tense such as in Standard American English, but added onto infinitives, first-person present verbs, and third-person past perfect verbs.

# He can goes out.
# I don&#x27;t know how to gets no girls.
# He&#x27;d knows that.

Further examples of the phenomenon in AAVE are provided below.

Below are examples of the lack of the possessive ending; -s is usually absent in AAVE but contains a rule
As Labov states, &quot;[the] use -s to indicate possession by a single noun or pronoun, but never between the possessor and the possessed.&quot;

&quot;This is hers, This is mines, This is John&#x27;s, but not in her book, my book, John book&quot;

&quot;Interview with Bryan A., seven years old, a struggling reader in a West Philadelphia elementary school: 
# If I don&#x27;t get out my mom room, I get in trouble and when I don&#x27;t get out my sister room she hit me.
# Bernicia penpal gave me one.
# That&#x27;s what he did to my cousin Raymond dog at my cousin house.
# I was acting like I stole my sister food.
# At the museum, it was fun, we went in somebody heart.&quot;

==Effects==

===Code-switching===

Many times within communities that contain sociolects that separate groups linguistically it is necessary to have a process where the independent speech communities can communicate in the same register; even if the change is as simple as different pronunciation. Therefore, the act of code-switching becomes essential. Code-switching is defined as &quot;the process whereby bilingual or bidialectal speakers switch back and forth between one language or dialect and another within the same conversation&quot;. At times code-switching can be situational, depending on the situation or topical, depending on the topic. Halliday terms this the best when he defines the role of discourse, stating that &quot;it is this that determines, or rather correlates with, the role played by the language activity in the situation&quot;. Therefore, meaning that which register is used depends on the situation and lays out the social context of the situation, because if the wrong register is used, then the wrong context is placed on the words. Furthermore, referring back to the diglossia expressed in the Arab-speaking world and the Tamil caste system in India, which words are used must be appropriate to not only the social class of the speaker, but the situation, the topic, and the need for courtesy. A more comprehensive definition is stated, &quot;Code-switching is not only a definition of the situation but an expression of social hierarchy.&quot;

<doc id="894422" wikidata="Q3534041" url="?curid=894422" title="Russel Arnold">
<text>Russel Premakumaran Arnold (; born 25 October 1973), or Russel Arnold, is a former Sri Lankan cricketer of Tamil descent, who played all forms of the game. He played as the finisher role in the Sri Lankan team batting down the order at international level. Arnold currently works as an international commentator. He was the first Twenty20 International cap for Sri Lanka as he was part of Sri Lanka&#x27;s first ever T20I team. He retired from cricket in 2007 after playing the final in 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup. 

== Early life ==
Arnold was encouraged to take the sport of cricket by his grandfather. He played school cricket at the St. Peter&#x27;s College, Colombo where he received his primary and secondary education. He played for Sri Lanka Under19 cricket team and impressed in the tour of England in a 3 match test series in 1992 where he scored 242 runs at the average of 48.40. He first arrived to domestic cricket in 1993 at the age of 20.

==International career==
Arnold made his Test debut against Pakistan on April and his One day international debut against South Africa later in the year on 6 November 1997. His test debut came as a blessing in disguise as he came as an injury replacement to Roshan Mahanama who was injured in a batting session in the nets. He was initially called into the Sri Lankan reserve squad for the home series against Pakistan in 1997 following his performances in domestic circuit.

Originally an opening batsman, Arnold has since moved down the batting order mainly due to the rise of Marvan Atapattu. He is most famous in the pearl island as a very versatile player, making him ideally suitable for the limited over version of the game. However, when he started his career, he was seen primarily as a solid top order batsmen where he impressed against Australia during the AIWA Cup of 1999, as well as the subsequent test series against them, where he batted at no 3. He batted at no 6 for the first time in his career during the Coca-Cola Champions Trophy 1999. The then Sri Lankan team head coach Dav Whatmore had felt that Russel could be utilised well when he plays down the order.

In an ODI match against Zimbabwe in 1999, Arnold along with Sajeewa de Silva set the record for the highest 10th wicket stand for Sri Lanka in ODI history (51). During the final of the 2000–01 Sharjah Champions Trophy against India in 2000 at Sharjah, Arnold helped Sanath Jayasuriya to post his highest individual score of 189. Sanath and Arnold had a good partnership until Sanath stumped after a brilliant 189. Russel provided good support scoring unbeaten 52 off 62 balls in the match. Sri Lanka eventually won the final by a big margin of 245 runs. He was part of the Sri Lankan team captained by Sanath Jayasuriya which won the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy jointly with India.

Arnold&#x27;s failure in the 2003 Cricket World Cup saw him sidelined for many months as selectors opted to groom the youngsters into the side. However, he fought his way back into the side with a string of good scores in domestic cricket for his club, Nondescripts. A calm and cool player in a crisis situation, Arnold has dragged Sri Lanka out of many sticky situations. He is highly valued for his gritty qualities and is considered an unselfish team man. He is considered an ideal No. 6; he is a Methodist Christian of Tamil descent.

Arnold has been nicknamed &quot;Rusty&quot; by Roshan Mahanama and Pramodya Wickramasinghe, due to it being a very common nickname for the name Russel, and for his batting style as tough and durable, though not really pretty. His late cut shot is admired by many critics at that time where he used the shot so often to spin bowling.

Arnold made his T20I debut against England on 15 June 2006, which was incidentally Sri Lanka&#x27;s first-ever T20I match. It was also his only T20I match in his career and Sri Lanka won the match by two runs.

==Retirement==
During April 2007 he announced, through team manager Michael Tissera, that he intended to retire from international cricket after the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup final, which came as a shock to Sri Lankan cricket. He cited the pressure of too much travel as his reason.

After retirement, he played A-grade cricket in Sydney for Hornsby District Cricket Club and has also played numerous games for the Melbourne Super Kings in Melbourne. He also played for Chennai Superstars in the Indian Cricket League. He also coached at Barker College, a prestigious private school in Sydney&#x27;s north. He also was assistant coach to Deccan Chargers in the IPL before the team was removed from the competition.

In 2018, he was appointed as the tournament director of the Lanka Premier League by the Sri Lanka Cricket but the proposed 2018 edition of the LPL was cancelled due to the dissolution of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board.

<text>Ajit Bhalchandra Agarkar (; born 4 December 1977) is a former Indian cricketer and a commentator. He is the current chairman of the BCCI selection committee since July 4, 2023. He has represented India in more than 200 international matches across all three formats of the game.
He is the third highest wicket-taker for India in One Day Internationals (ODIs). He was the part of the Indian squads which won the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy and the 2007 T20 World Cup and finished as runners up at the 2003 Cricket World Cup and the 2000 ICC Champions Trophy. He was the Chairman of Selection Committee for 2024 T20 World Cup winning Indian team.

He played for the Delhi Daredevils (Now Delhi Capitals) and the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, and captained Mumbai to its 40th Ranji Trophy title in 2013. He made his Test and ODI debuts in 1998 and T20I debut in 2006. In 2013, Agarkar announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. Post-retirement, he began a new career as a cricket analyst. He holds the record for the quickest 50 in ODIs by an Indian coming off just 21 balls (against Zimbabwe in 2000).

Post retirement Ajit Agarkar took liking for Golf won the India Finals of BMR World Corporate Golf Challenge held at Prestige Golfshire, Bengaluru. Ajit Agarkar and his team mate Shabbir Rawjee, playing off handicaps 17 and 19 respectively, triumphed with a total of 62 stableford points

==Personal life==
Agarkar was born on 4 December 1976 in Mumbai, to Meena and Balachandra Agarkar. He has one sister, Manik Agarkar. Agarkar started out as a batsman since his childhood before he was entrusted to cricket coach Ramakant Achrekar by his father. On Achrekar&#x27;s insistence, Agarkar shifted his school from IES to Shardashram Vidyamandir for Grade six. He developed as a batsman who could bowl a bit during this time while practicing at the Shivaji Park. He went on to perform consistently as a batsman scoring heavily in the inter-school Giles Shield tournament for the Under-16s making a triple century when he was 15. He carried the form into the Harris Shield under-19 tournament scoring consistently &quot;showing signs of being another Tendulkar in the making.&quot; It was during this time that he began shifting focus to his bowling after it was &quot;pointed out to [him] that it would be hard to make it into the Mumbai team as a pure batsman, and that he stood a better chance as an all-rounder&quot;. As a child, Agarkar idolized pacers Kapil Dev, Michael Holding and Ian Botham; later also taking a liking to Allan Donald.

Agarkar is an alumnus of Ruparel College in Matunga. He married Fatima Ghadially and has a son named Raj with her. He resides in Narayan Pujari Nagar on the Worli Seaface in South Mumbai in Maharashtra.

==Bowling style==
He is relatively short compared to other fast bowlers, but he could still bowl at speeds more than 90 mph (~142–150 km/h).

He was generally a wicket taking bowler being the fastest (at the time) to 50 wickets. During his career, many questions arose about his economy rate. However, his career economy rate was fair (5.07).

==International career==
Agarkar made his ODI debut against Australia at Kochi, on 1 April 1998. He took the wicket of Adam Gilchrist in that match.

Soon after his debut, a 20-year-old Agarkar achieved his first Man of the match award in a crucial Coca-Cola champions trophy match against New Zealand taking four wickets including the crucial wickets of Stephen Fleming and Craig McMillan while India was defending just 220 on 17 April 1998.

The positive start to his early career, Indian fans were hopeful of him forming a strong bowling partnership with Javagal Srinath. Srinath had been sidelined by injury during Agarkar&#x27;s 1st season and was the only successful pace bowler in the National Team. The emergence of Ashish Nehra in 1999 and Zaheer Khan in 2000 created further competition for pace bowling options especially in home conditions. Frequent injuries to Srinath, Nehra, and Agarkar meant India struggled with pace bowling resources.

While Agarkar remained a part of the team, he was not able to hold down a guaranteed place due to frequent injuries and severe competition for places especially after the emergence of Irfan Pathan in 2004. He was an important part of the hugely successful Indian team in 2002 and 2003 with Agarkar contributing some memorable performances with the bat and the ball. During this period, he was also a member of the Indian team which finished in the runner-up spot in the 2003 World Cup in South Africa, although he did not play in a single game throughout the tournament.

Amongst Agarkar&#x27;s better performances were his performances in Australia in the Test series of 1999, and also in the test series in 2003. At Adelaide Oval in 2003, Agarkar took 6/41, to help India to win their first test in Australia in over 20 years. Agarkar has performed better in ODI cricket, where he takes wickets regularly, although his economy rate is high. He has also had a number of good batting performances. He was the best Indian bowler in the one-day series during India&#x27;s tour of West Indies in 2006.

As a batsman, Agarkar is one of the few players who scored a Test century at Lords against England during India&#x27;s tour to England in 2002 when he scored 109 not out. Although India lost the test, his batting skills were quite noticeable. He also holds the record of the fastest fifty in ODI&#x27;s for India when he scored 67 not out in 25 balls at Rajkot against Zimbabwe in 2000. However, his batting exploits have been frequently overshadowed by seven consecutive instances of no scoring against Australia, five in Australia and two at home. His first four dismissals also happened to have been on the first ball he faced.

He is currently the 3rd highest wicket taker (288) for India in ODI&#x27;s after Javagal Srinath (315) and Anil Kumble (337).
One of the notable performances in the domestic cricket came in the 2009–10 Ranji trophy finals against Karnataka in which he took 5 wickets in the second innings ensuring a narrow win for Mumbai.

On 16 October 2013, Agarkar announced his retirement from all forms of cricket just before the start of the 2013–14 Ranji season.

=== As an all-rounder ===
John Wright used to send Agarkar as a pinch hitter in ODIs up the order to increase the scoring rate. He demonstrated good batting skills with extra slogging. Some of his acclaimed knocks in ODIs are when he smacked the fastest 50 in 21 balls in 2000 against Zimbabwe and took 3 wickets as well in that match, in another knock his 95 against West Indies in 2002 at Jamshedpur when he was sent up the order at number 3.
In the same season in 2002 he joined the group of few Indians to have scored a century at Lord&#x27;s, when he scored a century in the first test of series batting at no. 8. He got a runner-up medal in 2003 World Cup.

===Records===
Early in his career, Agarkar broke Dennis Lillee&#x27;s world record for the fastest 50 wickets in ODIs, achieving the feat from only 23 matches. He held the record from 1998 until 2009 when Ajantha Mendis achieved the feat from just 19 matches. Agarkar holds the Indian record of scoring the fastest 50 in ODI: he scored 50 off 21 balls. Agarkar also holds another ODI record, which is the quickest in terms of fewest matches played to take 200 wickets and complete 1000 runs. Agarkar achieved this feat in 133 matches breaking the previous record held by South African Shaun Pollock, who accomplished this feat in his 138th match.

During India&#x27;s 1999-2000 tour of Australia, Agarkar set a record of five consecutive innings (seven consecutive innings against Australia)
resulting in ducks (four of them first ball), which earned him the nickname &quot;Bombay Duck&quot;. The wicket takers were Damien Fleming, Brett Lee(twice), Mark Waugh and Glenn McGrath.

==Domestic career==
Agarkar represented Kolkata Knight Riders in Indian Premier League for three seasons. In the fourth season, he was contracted by Delhi Daredevils for US$210,000.

In February 2012 it was announced that Agarkar would captain Mumbai in the 2012 Vijay Hazare Trophy.

He was also the captain of the Mumbai team that won the 2013 Ranji Trophy. In the quarter-final, he scored 52* (from 53 balls) against Baroda to ensure a mammoth total of 645/9 declared. In the semi-final against Services, he scored 145 and made a 246-run 7th wicket partnership with wicketkeeper Aditya Tare (120) to rescue Mumbai from 169/6, and take the total to 454/8 declared.

<doc id="894432" wikidata="Q2722507" url="?curid=894432" title="Zaheer Abbas">
<text>Syed Zaheer Abbas Kirmani PP, (in Punjabi and Urdu: سید ظہیر عباس کرمانی; born 24 July 1947), popularly known as Zaheer Abbas, is a Pakistani former cricketer. He is among the few professional cricketers who used to wear spectacles in the cricket ground. In 1982/1983, he became the first batsman to score three consecutive centuries in one-day internationals. Sometimes known as &#x27;the Asian Bradman&#x27;, Zaheer Abbas is regarded as one of the finest batsmen in the history of cricket. In August 2020, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

==Career==
Abbas made his Test match debut in 1969; in his second Test he scored 274 against England, which is still the sixth-ever highest score by a Pakistani batsman. This was the first of his four Test double-centuries; only two men from Pakistan (Younis Khan and Javed Miandad) have scored more. The last was an innings of 215 against India in 1983, the first of three centuries in consecutive Tests, and his hundredth first-class century; Abbas and Geoffrey Boycott are the only two batsmen to have scored their hundredth first-class century in a Test match.

Abbas had great success in first-class cricket, and is the only Asian batsman to score one hundred first-class centuries. He had a long stint with Gloucestershire; joining the county in 1972, he remained there for thirteen years. During that time he scored over a thousand runs in the majority of his thirteen seasons. He also made over two thousand runs in a single season on two occasions for the club (1976 and 1981). During those thirteen years at Gloucestershire, he played 206 first-class games, scoring over 16,000 runs. He averaged 49.79, hitting 49 hundreds and 76 fifties. Abbas is the only player to have scored a century and double century in a first-class match four times, finishing each of the eight innings not out.

Sunil Gavaskar, the former Indian Test captain, once said while commentating that the Indian players would often say to Zaheer, &quot;Zaheer Ab-bas karo&quot;, which means &quot;Zaheer, stop it now&quot; in Urdu and Hindi, referring to Abbas&#x27; free scoring.

Abbas had two stints as captain of the national team in 1981 and 1984. He retired from international cricket in 1985, and has officiated as a match referee in one Test and three ODI matches. He has also worked as the manager of the national team. Zaheer was one of the player who was famous for his title. Zaheer Abbas was called Asian Bradman. In 2018 Government of Pakistan awarded him Sitara-e-Imtiaz. In 2015 he became ICC president, the third cricketer after Colin Cowdrey and Clyde Walcott, to hold the post.

Zaheer Abbas held the record for scoring the most runs by any batsman in a 4 match bilateral ODI series (346 runs) from 1982 to 2015. The record was broken by Hashim Amla of South Africa in 2015.

==Personal life==
Zaheer Abbas married Indian born Rita Luthra (now known as Samina Abbas) in 1988.

His first marriage was to Najma Bokhari with whom he has three daughters, Rudabah, Roshana and Hiba.

==Autobiography==
In 1983 he co-wrote his autobiography &quot;Zed&quot; with the British cricket journalist David Foot.

==Awards and recognition==
*Pride of Performance Award in 1971 by the Government of Pakistan
*Inducted in ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2020.
*Inducted in PCB Hall of Fame in 2021.

Younis&#x27; trademark was his ability to reverse swing a cricket ball at high speed. He took 373 Test wickets and 416 One Day International wickets during his career. Together with bowling partner Wasim Akram, he formed one of the world&#x27;s most feared bowling attacks. Younis has the second best strike rate, after Dale Steyn, for any bowler with over 350 Test wickets. He is the youngest bowler to take 400 wickets in ODI cricket.

He is also placed in the top ten of all time based on ICC rankings.

He worked as a bowling coach with the national side from 2006 to 2007. Waqar was appointed the coach of the Pakistan cricket team on 3 March 2010. He resigned as Pakistan&#x27;s cricket coach on 19 August 2011 citing personal reasons. He joined Sunrisers Hyderabad as their bowling coach for the Indian Premier League 2013 season.

On 4 September 2019, Younis was appointed by the PCB as Pakistan&#x27;s new bowling coach on a 3-year contract. He replaced Azhar Mahmood, who was sacked after Pakistan&#x27;s disappointing performance in the ICC World Cup 2019 tournament.

==Early and personal life==

=== Education ===
Younis was born in Burewala, Vehari district, Punjab, Pakistan to a Punjabi Jat family.

He studied in a boarding school in Lahore for some three years before joining the Sadiq Public School, Bahawalpur and later the Government College, Burewala, studying arts and economics.

=== Athleticism during his youth ===
He was raised in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, where his father was a contract worker for a Chinese construction company. He returned to Pakistan and started playing cricket there during his adolescent years. He used to travel to Burewala to play cricket which garnered him the nickname of the &quot;Burewala Express&quot;.

During his school and college days he was what he himself calls an all-round athlete, being a runner, a javelin thrower, a high jumper and a pole-vaulter in different competitions, initially being a leg-spinner before choosing pace bowling.

=== Family ===
Since 2000 he is married to Faryal, a Pakistani-Australian doctor, the family residing in Castle Hill, New South Wales, in Australia. They have three children, two daughters and a son.

His younger brother Ali Younis, a former banker turned cricket commentator, is married to cricketer Aliya Riaz. Another younger brother, Captain Faisal Younis, has been a PIA pilot.

=== Cricket commentary ===
Younis has worked as a television sports commentator for the Nine Network in Australia and for Ten Sports in the United Arab Emirates.

==Cricket career==

=== Early career ===
Younis began his cricket career in 1987/88 in Pakistan, playing for several first-class cricket clubs, and got his break with the Multan under-19 team. However he suffered an injury in which he lost the little finger on his left hand, after he had jumped into a canal. He recovered from this accident and went on to continue his sporting career. He was eventually discovered by former Pakistan captain, Imran Khan and was selected to be part of the national side. He had played only six first-class games when he got picked for the Pakistan camp out of the blue. Waqar says &quot;I remember Imran was not feeling well at the time, and was not present at the camp. Luckily the Super Wills Cup was going on, and there was a match between United Bank and Delhi XI. Saleem Jaffar got injured, and I got the opportunity to play that game. Imran watched me on TV, and actually came to the ground to watch the end of the game. The very next day, he met me and told me that I will be going to Sharjah next month. Just meeting Imran at the time was enough of an experience for me, but for him to notify me of my selection was just out of this world.&quot;

===Domestic===
English audiences became aware of Waqar&#x27;s talent during the early 1990s, when he played for Surrey. By taking 113 wickets in 582 overs for Surrey in 1991, at a mere 14.65 apiece (thereby topping the season&#x27;s first-class bowling averages), and by carrying on his shoulders an otherwise moderate county attack, he announced himself as one of the finest contemporary bowlers. There he displayed excellent cricketing performances and attracted attention from the sporting public. He went on to win the English County Championship with Glamorgan in 1997. He took 7 wickets for 25 against Lancashire at Liverpool on 21 June 1997, which included a hat-trick achieved after narrowly missing a hat-trick and took 68 wickets in the season.

===International===
Younis made his International cricket debut for Pakistan against India on 16 November 1989, in the same match that Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar made his debut. Waqar took 4 wickets in the drawn match including the wickets of Tendulkar and Kapil Dev. He made an immediate impression with his speed and became known in the cricket media as &quot;Wiki&quot; or the &quot;Burewala Express&quot;. Waqar along with Wasim Akram opened the bowling attack regularly for Pakistan, becoming a feared and potent attack. At his peak, he developed into a very quick fast bowler and achieved a hat-trick in a One Day International match against New Zealand in 1994. During the early periods of 2000, he stayed out of the Pakistan team for a brief period allegedly due to suspension and conflicts with bowling partner and captain Akram.

His return to cricket came with him being appointed the captain of Pakistan. However, he had to deal with allegations of ball-tampering and a number of controversies. In July 2000 Waqar was banned for one international match for ball tampering and was fined 50% of his match fee. He was the first cricketer to be banned from playing in a match for such incident. He was involved in further controversy during 2003 World Cup matches. In the opening match against Australia, Waqar was removed from the attack after bowling a beamer at Andrew Symonds, becoming the first bowler to be disciplined in such a way during an international match. The Pakistanis then crashed out of the group stage after winning only two matches, both against associate member teams. After the tournament he conceded the captaincy and was dropped from international selection. After a nearly 15-year career, Waqar announced his retirement from cricket altogether in April 2004. At the end of his career he finished as the second highest wicket taker for Pakistani in Test cricket with 373 wickets.

==Coaching career==

In March 2006, he was appointed as the bowling coach for Pakistan. He resigned from this position on 6 January 2007 in protest against the Pakistan Cricket Board decision to retain him only for the Test series against South Africa and not for the subsequent series of five One Day International matches. He also blamed captain Inzamam-ul-Haq for going with Mushtaq Ahmed instead of him for the bowling coach position. He was re-appointed as Pakistan&#x27;s bowling and fielding coach for their tour of Australia in December 2009.
In March 2010, Waqar was appointed the head coach of Pakistan after Intikhab Alam was sacked as coach, owing to the poor performances of the national side during the tour of Australia earlier that year.

Waqar&#x27;s first job as coach was to lead an inexperienced Pakistan side missing Younis Khan, Mohammad Yousuf and Shoaib Malik to the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 as a consolation, though Waqar had two top-notch bowlers in Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif at his disposal. He guided the defending champions to the semi-final of the tournament before they were eliminated by Australia, whose Mike Hussey struck three sixes in the final over.

The World Twenty20 was followed with the 2010 Asia Cup in which Pakistan lost to Sri Lanka by a narrow margin as Pakistan&#x27;s top order collapsed and Shahid Afridi&#x27;s 109 just failed to guide Pakistan to victory. In the following match Pakistan lost narrowly against India courtesy of a six by Harbhajan Singh from the third ball of the final over. The following match was a dead rubber between Pakistan and Bangladesh and another Afridi century meant Pakistan scored 385 runs and they comfortably won the match by 139 runs.

A tour of England followed, with two Twenty20&#x27;s against Australia and two Test matches. Pakistan won both Twenty20&#x27;s comfortably and the first Test saw Pakistan defeated by 154 runs. Pakistan rallied in the second Test and for the first time in 15 years Pakistan defeated Australia in a Test match. The previous victory in 1995 was also assisted by a superb bowling spell by Waqar Younis.

This tour was followed by a controversial tour of England as Pakistan headed in to the final Test match needing to win it to level the series 2–2. The News of the World broke the news that Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif and captain Salman Butt were involved in Spot-fixing. This saw the three players temporarily suspended and Pakistan lost by an innings and 225 runs – their biggest defeat in history. Low team morale meant the next two T20 matches were won comfortably by England, and the subsequent ODI series was won 3–2 by England as well.

This was followed by a tour of Abu Dhabi against South Africa. Pakistan lost the first Twenty20 match by six wickets following a batting collapse. Pakistan also lost the ODI series of five matches 3–2. Pakistan won the second ODI due to Abdul Razzaq&#x27;s superb performance of 109* off 72 balls. The Test series of two matches with South Africa was drawn. He also stated that now it was the time for Pakistan to rally and prepare for the World Cup.
Pakistan started the World Cup campaign in a strong fashion winning 5 out their 6 group matches and finishing on top of their group. Pakistan went on to beat West Indies in the quarter-finals by 10 wickets but lost to India in the semi-finals by 29 runs. Waqar eventually stepped down as Pakistan coach in August 2011 citing personal reasons but a rift with captain Shahid Afridi may have been a contributing factor.

In March 2013, it was announced that he would join Sunrisers Hyderabad as their bowling coach for the Indian Premier League 2013 season.

In May 2014, Waqar was reappointed as the head coach of Pakistan Cricket team for a period of two years, commencing from June 2014, hence serving in that capacity for the second time.

Waqar resigned from the position of Head Coach of Pakistani Cricket team, on April 4, 2016, citing the cricket board&#x27;s failure to work on his recommendations and leak of a confidential report after the World T20. He will serve as the head coach for Multan Sultans During the Third season of the Pakistan Super League.
On 16 November 2017 Waqar appointed as a mentor for Sylhet Sixers a team of Bangladesh Premier League for 2017. As of March 15, 2018 Waqar appointed for their head coach for the next two editions of Bangladesh Premier League

After the Cricket World Cup 2019, Waqar was reappointed as bowling coach of Pakistan Cricket team for a fourth time.

=== 2016 ICC World Twenty20 ===
Waqar Younis faced great criticism after Pakistan was unable to make it to the semi-finals, with less focus on the fact that the country had not seen international cricket for a number of years. After winning against Bangladesh in the Twenty20 2016, the team lost against New Zealand, India and Australia, leading to their ouster. Waqar &#x27;begged&#x27; for forgiveness to the nation and said he was ready to retire if it was needed but also said it could have been due to the lack of cricket in their own country.

However, he later wrote in his report that he blamed Pakistan&#x27;s poor performance in the matches on player Shahid Afridi. Younis submitted the report to the PCB where it was somehow leaked to the media. He expressed his anger and said that the report was confidential – it caused fans, on social media sites, to express disappointment in him to see him shifting the blame onto Afridi. Younis, in the report, accused Afridi of being &#x27;non-serious&#x27; during the matches and said Mohammad Hafeez hid his knee injury as well, which also affected their performance. He also said Afridi either performed poorly himself, or that other players did not listen to him as a captain. Regarding the report, he said the PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) were painting him as the &quot;bad guy&quot; and skipped meeting with him regarding the issue later on as it was most likely that they leaked the report. He then also scrapped plans of retirement and said he wanted to focus on the leak, despite his contract as coach ending in June 2016.

Younis said he did not want to blame individuals but largely singled out players, particularly Afridi. He said Akmal should not have been selected, instead it should have been players who were &#x27;proud&#x27; to represent their country. He also said that the team lost the Asia cup in February 2016 because they were &#x27;unfit&#x27; as they had not trained during PSL season and said it was like a &#x27;holiday for them&#x27;. Overall, he blamed it on &quot;poor captaincy&quot; from Afridi. He said it was unfair for him to first use Mohammad Nawaz, a new player, as a bowler in the Asia Cup 2016 because it &#x27;destroyed&#x27; his confidence when he was unable to handle it after being hit for 38 runs in 3 overs. Younis later posted on his Twitter – &#x27;no one wants to hear the truth&#x27;.

On 4 April 2016, Waqar resigned as Head Coach of the team, just after Shahid Afridi resigned as T20 captain. His reason behind it was the PCB who he said had used him as the &quot;scapegoat&quot; and shown him as a &quot;villain&quot; by leaking the Twenty20 report. He stepped down as coach 3 months before his contract would end and said that his scrapped salary should definitely be invested in domestic cricket. He added that he had tried his best to revive the team but they were still unable to better their performance and his recommendations in the report were badly handled by the PCB, who refused to even talk about the leak. Waqar Younis said his services to Pakistan cricket should not be forgotten and said he was stepping down with a heavy heart.

==Playing style==

=== Reverse swing ===
Waqar is one of several Pakistani fast bowlers, beginning with Sarfraz Nawaz, who have been successful at bowling reverse swing, because he was used as an old-ball bowler early in his career until Imran Khan retired. In partnership with Akram, Younis opened the Pakistan bowling attack in the 1990s. Cricket critics and scholars attribute Younis and Akram to be one of the most effective fast bowling partnerships in cricket history, due to their ability to swing the ball at high speed. The ability to reverse swing and his speed led to him becoming one of the most talented bowlers in modern cricket.

Waqar explained his ability to reverse swing by the manipulation of an old ball; with one side shiny, one side rough, the ball would move in the opposite direction to conventional swing. This led to Waqar having the ability to bowl inswingers and outswingers in the cricket pitch and in effect both Waqar and Akram became successful in taking wickets with this variation of swing bowling. His fastest timed delivery in cricket was 153 km/h or 95.1 mph, a delivery he bowled against South Africa in 1993 but this was after he had suffered serious back injuries which had really reduced his bowling speeds. He was also effective in the use of bouncers or short-pitched deliveries; Waqar&#x27;s bowling against South Africa in Sheikhupura in Pakistan, is remembered for his effective use of the short-pitched delivery.

Following Pakistan&#x27;s victory during the Test match series versus England in 1992, the English media were suspicious of the reverse swing delivery. It was relatively unknown to the cricketing world during that period and this led to accusations of foul play by critics, however cricket officials found no evidence of foul play and the skill of the reverse swing delivery has been accepted in cricket.

=== Influence ===
Sri Lanka fast bowler, Lasith Malinga, who became the first bowler in World Cup history to take two hat-tricks, has said that he learnt to bowl his deadly yorkers by watching Pakistan&#x27;s legendary pair of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. No doubt over the years several bowlers have learned and mastered the skill of reverse swing but there are still some techniques which haven&#x27;t have been explored, e.g. banana swing. The title of Banana Swing Bowler was given to Waqar Younis because of his unique technique of swinging the ball in the air at very high speed before hitting the ground. In most of his hat tricks he delivered banana swing balls which were unplayable.

=== Criticism ===
Despite his qualities as a fast bowler, he was expensive at times and sometimes lacked the consistency of bowlers such as West Indian fast bowler Curtly Ambrose and Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath. This may be partly due to the mentality of his former captain, Imran Khan, who prioritised aggression and speed.

==Legacy==

=== Usain Bolt ===
The world&#x27;s fastest sprinter and runner Usain Bolt, who is from Jamaica (in the West Indies), once replied while being asked about who were his heroes when he was a child: &quot;When I was really small I loved the Pakistan cricket team. Waqar Younis was one of the greatest bowlers ever, and I was a bowler so I really enjoyed watching him. I was a big Pakistan fan until I got older, when I noticed that I should actually support my home team.&quot; When asked what if there was a match between Pakistan and Windies, Bolt remarked &quot;I would still have supported Pakistan, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying – when I was little, it was all about Pakistan.&quot;

=== ICC Hall of Fame ===
Younis was inducted in the ICC Hall of Fame of 9 December 2013. He became the 70th male inductee into the Hall of Fame, joining compatriot Hanif Mohammad and 
Zaheer Abbas as well as his former teammates Imran Khan, Javed Miandad and Wasim Akram. On his induction he said: &quot;It&#x27;s a huge honour for me, I&#x27;m truly grateful to the people who&#x27;ve considered me worthy of such an honour.&quot;

<text>Saeed Anwar (; born 6 September 1968) is a Pakistani former cricketer and a former captain for Tests and ODIs. An opening batsman and occasional slow left arm orthodox bowler, Anwar played international cricket between 1989 and 2003. Considered one of greatest opening batsmen Pakistan has ever produced and also regarded as one of the finest batsmen of his era. Anwar has scored twenty centuries in ODIs, more than any other Pakistani batsmen in this format. He played 55 Test matches, scoring 4052 runs with eleven centuries, average 45.52. In 247 One Day Internationals (ODIs) he made 8824 runs at an average of 39.21. Anwar is credited for being one of the most stylish batsmen of 1990s alongside Mark Waugh, Damien Martyn and Sourav Ganguly. His timing, elegance and placement of cricket shots are widely admired by cricket fans. He was a part of the squad which finished as runners-up at the 1999 Cricket World Cup.

Anwar got a pair at his Test debut against the West Indies in 1990, and scored 169 runs in his third Test against New Zealand in February 1994. In 1998–99, he became the third Pakistani to carry his bat through a Test innings, and scored his highest Test score of 188 not out. He made seven ODI centuries at Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium, including three consecutive during 1993–94. Anwar scored two successive hundreds on three occasions in his career. He is most notable for scoring 194 runs against India in Chennai in 1997, the highest score for that time, and now the tenth highest individual score in an ODI. Anwar participated in three Cricket World Cups, and captained Pakistan in seven Tests and 11 ODIs. In August 2003, he announced his retirement from International cricket.
Saeed Anwar was the highest runs scoring batsman for Pakistan in 1996,1999 and 2003 World Cup.

== Personal life ==

Saeed Anwar was born on 6 September 1968 in Karachi. In 1973, he shifted with his family to Canada and came back to Karachi in 1977. Anwar went to high school at Government Degree Science College, Malir Cantt and went to university at NED University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi. He graduated from NED in 1989 majoring in Computer System Engineering. He was planning to go to the United States for his Master&#x27;s studies before becoming a professional Test cricketer. His father, a businessman by profession, played cricket at club level whereas his brother, Jawed Anwar, represented Lahore Under-19 cricket team.

Anwar married his cousin, Lubna, a doctor by profession, in March 1996. He faced a personal tragedy in 2001 when his daughter, Bismah, died after a prolonged illness. As a result, he turned religious and starting preaching Islam across Pakistan with the Tablighi Jamaat. He made his return to cricket after a long hiatus and was one of the most consistent Pakistani batsmen in the 2003 World Cup. However upon his return, he lost his previous touch and could not perform as he did before. He was criticized for the loss of form which led to his retirement from cricket soon. &quot;I retired because I felt unwanted&quot;, he said. At the time he left cricket he was a computer engineer by profession. During his career, he was an elegant batsman and played particularly well on the off side, his trademark flick being a sure shot feature in almost all of his innings. He led the funeral prayers for his former teammate Wasim Akram&#x27;s spouse, Huma Akram, in Lahore.
==International career==

Anwar was an outstanding opener in Test cricket. He played 55 Test matches for Pakistan and scored 4052 at the average of 45.52. He is the seventh-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket, and scored 11 centuries and 25 half-centuries during his international career. As an aggressive opening batsman, most of his centuries turned into relatively big scores. He scored many of his centuries away against almost every team he toured, and averaged more than 40 against three of the four nations – South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and England – which have been most difficult for Asian batsmen. He has the highest Test batting average (59.06) of any Pakistani against Australia, and once scored two consecutive centuries against them. Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja commented the &quot;[Anwar] used an eclectic approach to batting – classical betrothed to unorthodox, footwork against spin as quick as a hiccup supple yet powerful to brush the field like a Picasso.&quot;

He made his Test debut against the West Indies in a match which Pakistan lost at Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad, in 1990. He got a pair in the match. Curtly Ambrose and Ian Bishop dismissed him in the first and second innings respectively. In the third Test of his career, Anwar scored 169 runs in Pakistan&#x27;s solitary innings against New Zealand in February 1994; Pakistan won the match by an innings and 12 runs. Later in the same year during Pakistan&#x27;s tour to Sri Lanka, his 94 and 136 runs in the first match at Colombo earned him a man of the match award, and ensured Pakistan&#x27;s victory by 301 runs. Scroring fifties—85 and 77 runs—in both the innings of the first Test against Australia at Karachi in September 1994, Anwar helped Pakistan led the three match series 1–0. In the same season against Zimbabwe, he was unsuccessful with bat in the away series; he only managed 45 runs playing in four innings of two Tests. Anwar scored three consecutive fifties against Sri Lanka in the 1995 home series. In the series, he played three innings scoring 154 runs with an average of 51.50.

In the 1996 Pakistan&#x27;s tour of England, a three-Test match series was played between the teams. Pakistan won the series by 2–0, their fifth consecutive series win against England. Anwar remained the second highest run scorer with 362 runs – only behind Alec Stewart&#x27;s 396 – with an average of 60.33. He scored 88 and 74 runs in the first Test at Lord&#x27;s, and 176 and one runs in the third match at The Oval. In the 1996–97 season, he played two Tests against the touring Zimbabwe and aggregated 182 runs in three innings, the second highest after Wasim Akram&#x27;s 292. In the same season, Anwar replaced injured Akram as captain for the home series against New Zealand. He was the second highest run-scorer once again, accumulating 157 runs in three innings, including 149 in the second Test at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. In the next home series, against South Africa in 1997–98, he only scored 40 runs in four innings at the average of 8.00. He aggregated 236 runs in the away series against the same team—only behind Azhar Mahmood&#x27;s 327. He scored 118 runs in the second Test at Kingsmead Cricket Ground, which allowed Pakistan to win a Test match for the first time in South Africa. Anwar scored 150 runs at the average of 37.50, during Pakistan&#x27;s tour to Zimbabwe.

In the 1998–99 season, Anwar played two Tests against the touring Australia, and scored 290 at the average of 96.66, including two centuries. His partnership of 120 runs with Mushtaq Ahmed, for the ninth, prevented Pakistan&#x27;s collapse in the first innings of the first Test at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. He scored 145 runs in the match, but Pakistan lost the match by an innings and 99 runs. In the next home series, Anwar played two matches against Zimbabwe, scoring 142 runs at the average of 47.33. He was ineffective against India, scoring 101 runs in two matches, during Pakistan&#x27;s tour to India.

In the first Test of the 1998–99 Asian Test Championship, Anwar became the third Pakistani to carry his bat through a Test innings, following father and son Nazar Mohammed and Mudassar Nazar. Anwar&#x27;s career best 188 not out in the second innings at the Eden Gardens—beating the team&#x27;s total at the previous innings (185) where he made a duck—was 60 per cent of the total, 316. It was also the highest Test score by a Pakistani on Indian soil which was surpassed by Younus Khan; Younus scored 267 runs at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in the third Test of the 2004–05 series between the teams. He was the fourth highest run-scorer of the tournament, with 290 runs from five innings, averaged 72.50.

Anwar played three Test during Pakistan&#x27;s tour of Australia in 1999–2000 season, scoring 282 runs at the average of 47.00. His performance in the series, a century and two fifties, could not prevent Pakistan&#x27;s defeat of 3–0. Anwar captained Pakistan in the first two Tests during the Sri Lanka tour to Pakistan, and scored 217 runs at the average of 54.25. In the reply series in 2000, Pakistan and Sri Lanka played three matches and won the series 2–0. Anwar scored 185 runs, including a century and a fifty. During the 2000–01, he played five matches against England, three at home and two at away; in both the series, he scored at averages less than 31 and 16 respectively. Anwar&#x27;s last Test was against Bangladesh during the 2001–02 Asian Test Championship; he scored 101 runs in Pakistan&#x27;s solitary innings which ensured an innings and 264 runs win at the Multan Cricket Stadium. His daughter died the same day.

=== One Day International career ===
Anwar played 247 ODI matches for Pakistan and scored 8824 runs from 244 innings at the average of 39.21. He is third in the list of leading run-scorers for Pakistan in the format after Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Yousuf. With 20 centuries, he is Pakistan&#x27;s leading century-maker in ODIs. Anwar was the first Pakistani batsman to score a century against India on Indian soil in an ODI match.

Under the captaincy of Imran Khan, Anwar started his international career in January 1989 with an ODI match played at WACA Ground which Pakistan lost to West Indies. He scored only 3 runs in the match. His first match-winning performance came against India in December 1989 at Jinnah Stadium, Gujranwala. He scored unbeaten 42 runs off 32 balls in the match. In the 1989–90 World Series Cup, Anwar played nine matches and scored 293 runs with the help of a century, and at the average of 32.55. His best performance in the series was 126 runs against Sri Lanka at Adelaide Oval. His next performance was against New Zealand in 1990–91, when he was the top-scorer of the series, with 203 runs. Pakistan won the three-match series 3–0. In 1993, he made four ODI centuries at Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium, including three consecutive centuries against Sri Lanka, West Indies and Sri Lanka respectively, during 1993–94 Wills Trophy and became the second of the four players to do so. He scored two successive hundreds on three other occasions in his career, and was the first batsman to complete this feat in ODIs—in 1996, in 1999, and in 2000. In six matches of the 1994–95 Wills Trophy, he scored 202 runs at the average of 40.40, including a century. He scored a century against Sri Lanka at Gymkhana Club Ground in October 1996, while captaining the team.

On 21 May 1997 in Chennai, Anwar scored 194 against India in India in an ODI match in the 1997 Pepsi Independence Cup. Charles Coventry equalled the feat on 16 August 2009, against Bangladesh. This was the highest individual score by any men&#x27;s batsman in the world till Sachin Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 200 against South Africa on 24 February 2010. Anwar&#x27;s record stood as the overall ODI record across both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s play for seven months as in the 1997 Women&#x27;s Cricket World Cup, Australian batswomen Belinda Clark record a 229 not out. He accumulated 315 runs from the five matches of the 1998 Silver Jubilee Independence Cup, including 140 runs in the third final against India at Dhaka; India won the match by three wickets.

====World Cup Performance====
Anwar played in three Cricket World Cups for Pakistan: 1996, 1999 and 2003. He played 21 matches and scored 915 runs at the average of 53.82, and his highest score in a world cup match remained 113 not out. In 1996 Cricket World Cup, Anwar made three fifties, Against India in the second Quarter-final at Bangalore, he made 48. Pakistan lost the match by 39 runs. He made 329 in the tournament. In 1999 Cricket World Cup, he made two consecutive centuries, 103 against Zimbabwe and 113 not out against New Zealand in the Semi-final, and led Pakistan into the Final. He scored 368 runs in the tournament. He played his last match against Zimbabwe during the 2003 World Cup in which he made unbeaten 40 runs. The match ended without result due to rain. In the previous match played against India which Pakistan lost by six wickets, he scored his fourth century against them and 20th overall. Anwar dedicated the century to his daughter, who died in 2001.

<doc id="894438" wikidata="Q7294910" url="?curid=894438" title="Rashid Latif">
<text>Rashid Latif (born 14 October 1968), is a Pakistani cricket coach and former cricketer who played for the Pakistan national cricket team in Tests and One Day Internationals from 1992 to 2003 as a right-handed wicket-keeper batsman. He also served as the captain of the Pakistan team in 2003, leading the country in 6 Test and 25 one-day matches.

In February 2014, he became the chief selector of Pakistan national cricket team.

==Early life and domestic career==
Latif was born in Karachi to Abdul Latif Quraishi, who migrated to Pakistan from Uttar Pradesh, India, during the 1950s while Rashid&#x27;s half-brother, Shahid Latif, remained in India where he worked for a newspaper in Kolkata, West Bengal.

He earned a BSc in computer systems engineering from NED University of Engineering and Technology with Saeed Anwar, where he joined APMSO. In April 2006, Latif retired from first-class cricket as he toured with the Pakistani senior players to play against Indian senior players in April 2006 in a series played between players who have retired from professional cricket. Latif has not participated in domestic first-class cricket since 2005. His last match was in 2006, when he played for Lashings Cricket Club, a club in England.

==International career==
Latif started playing for the Pakistan national cricket team in 1992 after the 1992 Cricket World Cup. He impressed the national selectors by scoring 50 runs on his Test debut, however it did not cement his place in the national squad as throughout his career he had to compete with another Pakistani wicket-keeper, Moin Khan. Despite having a significantly similar Test batting average, Moin had a higher ODI average than Latif and scored more runs than Latif in international cricket. However, Moin had the keeping record of 2.14 dismissals per test against Latif 3.51 per test. Moreover, in all time Pakistani XI Latif picks as wicket-keeper and hence 69 test matches of Moin is a question mark in Rashid Latif tenure. In 1996, Latif announced his retirement after conflicts with some players and the team management. He returned to the Pakistan team and became the captain of the National side in 1998.

Latif remained out of the national squad until 2001, when after a string of poor performances, the Pakistan team replaced Moin Khan. After returning to the squad, he secured his place by keeping the wicket and giving a string of good batting performances. The highlight of his career came after the 2003 Cricket World Cup, when he was named the captain of the Pakistan team. Under his leadership, Pakistan successfully experimented with several new players and the team gave positive results. He was also involved with uniting the players through his captaincy both on and off the cricket field. However, problems between Latif and the team management again surfaced in 2003–04, which resulted in him giving away the captaincy to former Pakistan batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq. He was omitted from the squad and was never recalled in the team, despite his attempts to get back into the squad during 2003–05.

== Dropped catch controversy and end of Test career ==
Rashid Latif claimed a catch against Bangladesh batsman Alok Kapali in Multan in 2003. However, replays showed clearly that the catch was dropped and Rashid deliberately claimed a dropped catch. At the time, he maintained his innocence and stated that had he known he had not taken a clean catch, he would have called the batsman back. Mike Procter, the match referee, found Rashid guilty and banned him for five international matches. The game was very close, and Bangladesh lost the game by just one wicket. Rashid Latif later acknowledged that he knowingly and wrongfully claimed that catch. However, he stated that he had no regret over his action. &quot;I did realize immediately that the ball rolled out of my hand and it touched the ground. I conveyed that to my senior players. I gave an option to recall the batsman but it was decided that we will let him go. But I have no regrets.&quot; - Rashid Latif He never got back in the Pakistan test squad after this incident.

==Coaching career==

===Afghan coaching===
In July 2010, Latif was appointed as the batting coach of the Afghanistan national cricket team. Latif stated that the Afghan players were keen to learn from him. Latif further added that he liked the challenge of coaching the team and helping at the grassroots level of Afghan cricket; in July 2010 he also talked about having a Pakistan-Afghanistan cricket series in late 2010 to help Pakistan return to staging international cricket. As a wicket-keeper, Latif also commented on the form of Pakistani wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal by stating that &quot;Kamran has gained weight for a wicket-keeper, his wicket-keeping has been poor due to that and a lot of workload as a cricketer. I strongly suggest to all wicket-keepers that when they are struggling they take a rest and then comeback to the scene stronger as poor wicket-keeping can destroy your confidence as a batsman.&quot; In August 2010, the coach of the Afghan team Kabir Khan announced that he was going to leave his post because of consistent interference by the board. This led to Latif, who was the batting coach at the time, to be named his successor. However, soon after that Latif announced his resignation also, citing consistent interference by the board.

Latif&#x27;s stint as the Afghan coach got off to a good start when Afghanistan registered a 162-run win over Kenya in the ICC Intercontinental Cup but then lost the first ODI by 92 runs; Kenya were bowled out for 160 but Afghanistan&#x27;s batting order collapsed for 88. The team took a six-wicket victory during the second ODI as Kenya succumbed to 139 and Afghanistan suffered a poor start with opener Noor Ali retiring hurt and Karim Sadiq being caught. However, Asghar Stanikzai scored his second half-century and along with Mohammad Shahzad, who scored 37, guided the run chase. The finest moment of Latif&#x27;s coaching career came at the 2010 Asian Games when Afghanistan upset the cricket super-power Pakistan in the semi-final as Afghanistan sealed a comfortable 22-run victory and set up a final tie with Bangladesh. Afghanistan lost the final but celebrated the accomplishment of collecting their first ever Asian Games medal with a second-place silver.

The next assignment of Latif&#x27;s team was the ICC Intercontinental Cup where Afghanistan played Scotland in the final. Latif stated that Afghanistan liked to play aggressive cricket and the players were mentally very tough and hated to lose. On 2 December, the match against Scotland started and because of Hamid Hassan Scotland were bowled out for 212. More than half of Scotland&#x27;s runs came from Neil McCallum who scored 104*. Afghanistan got off to a good start but collapsed to 171 all out, giving Scotland a 41-run lead. Despite this, another great bowling performance from Hassan and Samiullah Shenwari meant that Scotland were skittled for just 82 in their second innings. On the third day, Afghanistan sealed victory early in the day with seven wickets in hand, courtesy of a superb 56* by Mohammad Shahzad.

===Controversy===
In 2010, Latif responded to the spot-fixing allegations against the Pakistan team by saying that ICC needed to re-design its laws and rules to root out the match-fixing and spot-fixing problem. Latif wrote a letter to the ICC citing his concerns back in 2003. &quot;In that letter, I told them to change the rules and laws in one-day internationals which, were more prone to spot-fixing. I even offered to assist the ICC&#x27;s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit but I got no response,&quot; he said.

&quot;The key is to design laws and rules that do not allow players and bookmakers to manipulate things. I told the ICC remove the fielding restrictions and they introduced the power-play which only encouraged fixing.&quot;

Following this statement, Latif resigned as the wicket-keeping coach at the Pakistan National Cricket Academy and subsequently reconciled with the Afghan Cricket Board and returned as the team&#x27;s coach. He stated that his aim was to help the team get the status to play Test cricket in two years&#x27; time. Latif also stated that he believed that a broadcast delay of 30 seconds would help curb fixing.

==Pakistan Super League==
He is currently one of the members of the advisory board as well as director of PSL&#x27;s franchise Karachi Kings.

=== Rajasthani architecture ===
An admirer of Rajasthani architecture, he asked Pakistani architect Nayyar Ali Dada to design his Lahore house on the pattern of Jaipur&#x27;s Rambagh Palace.

==Domestic career==
Raja made his first-class cricket debut in 1978, scoring over 9,000 runs in List A and 10,000 runs in first class matches. He made his Test debut against England in 1984 and ODI debut against New Zealand in 1985. Raja was regarded as one of the prominent batters playing in Pakistan&#x27;s domestic cricket.

==International career==
===Golden years===
When he got his first opportunity to play in a Test match, against England, Raja&#x27;s performance was unimpressive, as he was dismissed for 1 run in each innings. However, with the retirement of several players in the Pakistan squad and with the help of his years of experience in first-class cricket, Raja was able to secure a spot in the national side.

He played international cricket for 13 years, appearing in 57 Test matches, with a career average of 31.83 and scoring two centuries. In the One Day International arena, he played 198 matches and scored 9 centuries. He was a member of the national side that reached the semi-finals of the 1987 World Cup. He scored 2 centuries in the 1992 World Cup, which was held in Australia, including a century against New Zealand, who had been undefeated during that period. He was awarded the man of the match for his match winning performance which earned Pakistan a place in the semi-finals of the tournament. In the final against England, Raja had the honour of taking the final catch which won the World Cup for Pakistan. This became the pinnacle of his cricketing career, as within a year of this triumph, he had lost form and was dropped from the national side.

=== Obstructing the field ===
Raja became the first player in One Day International history to be given out &quot;obstructing the field&quot; against England, in a match at Karachi in 1987. England had scored 263 runs for 6 wickets during their 44 over innings. For Pakistan, Raja opened the batting and had reached 98 runs when the last ball of the match was bowled, with Pakistan needing 25 runs to win in the last over. During this last over, he hit the ball and sprinted for two runs that would have given him his century, but was well short of the crease when the fielder&#x27;s return came towards him and Raja knocked the ball away with his bat and was given out for &quot;obstructing the field&quot;.

===Late career===
He was recalled to the Pakistan squad and played in the 1996 Cricket World Cup. During the 1995–1996 season, he was removed from the captaincy, after Pakistan lost their first home series to Sri Lanka. His final game in a Test match for Pakistan was as captain in the 1996–1997 tour of Sri Lanka, however the team failed to win a match during the series. He retired from all forms of cricket in 1997 and since then he has been active as a television commentator and analyst as an administrator for both Pakistan and international cricket.

== Post-retirement ==

=== Commentary career ===

Raja has worked as a commentator on &quot;Test Match Special&quot; and Sky Sports, during the 2006 England Test series against Pakistan. He has also worked as the chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board, but resigned from his job in August 2004, citing increasing media commitments. He continues to provide commentary on Pakistan cricket team&#x27;s tours as well as in many domestic tournaments and international ICC tournaments.

=== Cricket administration ===
Raja served as the 35th Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board between September 2021 and December 2022.

=== Hosting ===
In 2024, Raja launched &quot;Showtime With Ramiz Raja&quot; on Suno News, a late-night entertainment show where he interviews celebrities.

<text>Shabbir Ahmed Khan (; born 21 April 1976) is a Pakistani former cricketer who played for the Pakistani national cricket team between 2003 and 2007 before got banned for an illegal bowling action.

He was a line-and-length pace bowler who took eight wickets for 109 runs on his Test debut against Bangladesh in the first of their 2003–04 three-Test series, including five wickets in the second innings. He also had an impressive start to his One-Day International career after picking up three wickets (all three bowled out) with two wickets in his first over, in his debut against the West Indies at Toronto.

==Style==
Shabbir Ahmed is a tall (6&#x27;5&quot;), Pakistani fast bowler. He extracts a great deal of bounce, even on lifeless wickets, and bowling from close to the stumps – much like Glenn McGrath – allows him to stick to a tight wicket-to-wicket line. He seams and cuts more than he swings, often sharply and both ways and is a sound exponent of reverse swing.

==One year ban==
Shabbir had taken 51 wickets in 10 tests, when in 2005 after playing the first Test against England he was reported to the ICC for an illegal bowling action. Following an investigation into his action, Ahmed was banned from cricket for one year in December 2005.

==Return to cricket==
As of 21 December 2006, having completed his one-year term, Shabbir was once again eligible to play International Cricket. However, the clause was that if Shabbir was reported again, he would be suspended from bowling at international level until his action is reassessed.

Shabbir played in the Pakistani domestic competition till 2013 after which he called it quits.

<doc id="894453" wikidata="Q887250" url="?curid=894453" title="Anthicidae">
<text>The Anthicidae are a family of beetles that resemble ants. They are sometimes called ant-like flower beetles or ant-like beetles. The family comprises over 3,500 species in about 100 genera.

==Description==
Their heads constrict just in front of the pronotum, forming a neck, and the posterior end of the pronotum is usually narrow as well. Legs and antennae are slender, heightening the ant-like appearance, and the body is sparsely covered with small hairs, called setae.

==Biology==
Adult beetles are omnivorous, being known to consume small arthropods, pollen, fungi, and whatever else they can find. Some species are of interest as biological control agents, as they can eat the eggs or larvae of pests. Larvae are either omnivorous, predators, or fungus-eaters; the young of one species of &quot;Notoxus&quot; have been observed boring into sweet potato tubers.

Many members of the family are attracted to cantharidin, which they seem to accumulate and that deters possible predators.

==Taxonomy==
Synonyms of the family include Notoxidae and Ischaliidae. The earliest known members of the family are from the Early Cretaceous (Barremian) aged Lebanese amber, including &quot;Camelomorpha&quot; of the subfamily Macratriinae.

<text>Roselyn Milagros Sánchez Rodríguez (born April 2, 1973) is a Puerto Rican singer-songwriter, dancer, model, actress, producer, and writer. On television, she is best known for her roles as Elena Delgado on the CBS police procedural &quot;Without a Trace&quot; (2005–2009), as Carmen Luna on the Lifetime comedy-drama &quot;Devious Maids&quot; (2013–2016), and as Elena Roarke on the new &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; (2021–2023).

==Early life==
Sánchez was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and is the youngest of four siblings, having three older brothers. She received her primary education in San Juan. At a young age, she showed an interest in both dancing and acting and would put on shows for her family. Sánchez enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico, where like her father and brothers she was to study marketing. However, after three years she left the course. In 1991, at the age of eighteen, Sánchez moved to New York City, where she took classes in dancing, acting and singing. She returned to Puerto Rico and, in 1992, she made her movie debut, having landed a small part as an island girl in the movie &quot;Captain Ron&quot;, which was partly filmed in Puerto Rico.

==Career==
In Puerto Rico, Sánchez gained public attention as a dancer and as co-host of a variety show called &quot;Qué Vacilón&quot;. At that time, in 1993, Sánchez won the Miss Puerto Rico Petite contest and, in 1994, she won the international title of Miss American Petite, bringing her international fame. Sánchez has been named in numerous annual lists of beautiful women including &quot;Maxim Magazine&quot;″s &quot;Hot 100&quot; in 2001, 2002 and 2006; AskMen.com&#x27;s &quot;Top 99 Most Desirable Women&quot; in 2005 and 2006; and &quot;FHM&quot;″s &quot;100 Sexiest Women&quot; in 2005 and 2006.

In 2001, Sánchez was cast as Isabella Molina, an undercover United States Secret Service agent who was Jackie Chan&#x27;s love interest in the hit movie &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;. In 2003, she played the role of Lorena in the movie &quot;Chasing Papi&quot;, starring alongside Jaci Velasquez and Sofia Vergara. Sánchez has acted in some 20 movies, including as Maria in &quot;Edison&quot; and as Karen Lopez in &quot;Underclassman&quot;. She starred in the Puerto Rican film &quot;Cayo&quot;, released in 2005.

In 2003, her first musical recording, &quot;Borinqueña&quot;, was released. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Amor Amor&quot;, gained a lot of attention as well as a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Music Video. She appeared in Craig David&#x27;s music videos &quot;Hidden Agenda&quot; and &quot;Personal&quot;, and in the Fabolous video for the song &quot;Make Me Better&quot;.

In the fall of 2005, Sánchez joined the cast of the CBS television series &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, where she played Agent Elena Delgado to 2009. She composed the musical &quot;Yellow&quot;, about a singer/dancer/actress who leaves Puerto Rico to hit the big time in New York, in which she played the principal part. The movie was filmed in 2005 and released in 2007. Also in 2007, she acted as Monique, the ballet teacher, in &quot;The Game Plan&quot;, and in 2009, starred in &quot;The Perfect Sleep&quot;, a neo-noir drama, co-starring Patrick Bauchau, Tony Amendola, Isaac Singleton, and Peter Lucas. In 2011, Sánchez made a guest appearance on TNT&#x27;s &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot;, playing villainous attorney Valerie Delgado.

In 2012, Sánchez was cast opposite Ana Ortiz of ABC comedy-drama pilot &quot;Devious Maids&quot;, created by Marc Cherry. On May 14, 2012, the pilot was not picked to series by ABC for the 2012–13 United States network schedule. However, on June 22, 2012, Lifetime picked up the pilot with a thirteen-episode order. The series premiered June 23, 2013 on Lifetime.

==Personal life==
From August 9, 1998, to April 15, 2001, Sanchez was married to English actor, former boxer, and former model Gary Stretch. After her divorce, she started a relationship with Puerto Rican salsa singer Víctor Manuelle. In December 2005, she announced that she had ended their relationship.

Sánchez became engaged to actor Eric Winter in December 2007 after two years of dating and they married on 29 November 2008, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Sánchez gave birth to their daughter in January 2012 (she miscarried her daughter&#x27;s twin early in the pregnancy). The couple had a son in November 2017. Both children were conceived with the help of IVF.

Sánchez has spoken openly about her struggles with endometriosis and infertility while trying to get pregnant later in life.

Sánchez is the spokesperson of the Fundación de Niños San Jorge, which assists sick children from poor families.

<doc id="894463" wikidata="Q1025908" url="?curid=894463" title="Projekt Revolution">
<text>Projekt Revolution was a music festival hosted by Linkin Park, bringing artists of various genres of music together. Linkin Park started Projekt Revolution in the year 2002 with just one stage. Then, in 2004, they announced the Revolution Stage (Second Stage) where the smaller bands/artists would perform.

== 2002 ==
2002 brought Linkin Park the idea to plan the Projekt Revolution Tour series, and the series began in that year. They thought it was part festival tour, part concert tour, part national tour. It is the first of the Projekt Revolution Tour Series. For this edition, Linkin Park was supporting their debut album, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. It was also one of the shortest of the PR Series.
* Main Stage
** Linkin Park
** Cypress Hill
** Adema
** DJ Z-Trip (Except the first two shows)

Setlist

== 2003 ==
The 2003 Projekt Revolution Tour, was the shortest of the PR tour series until the 2011 edition. This marked the first of two Projekt Revolutions in support of Linkin Park&#x27;s second album, &quot;Meteora&quot;.
* Main Stage
** Linkin Park
** Mudvayne
** Xzibit
** Blindside
** Cold (July dates only)
** Revis (last two dates only)

Setlist

== 2004 ==
The Projekt Revolution 2004 Tour&#x27;s Stage has a big bit change. It was divided into the Main Stage and Revolution stages, while its set stays connected. The 2004 PR Tour was the longest of the Projekt Revolution Tour series. This was also Korn&#x27;s last tour to feature their full original lineup with original guitarist Brian Welch, who leaves the band in February the following year until his return in 2013. Jonathan Davis of Korn would come out on &quot;One Step Closer&quot; to sing the reanimated part of the song.
* Main Stage
** Linkin Park
** Korn
** Snoop Dogg
** The Used
** Less Than Jake (except the Dallas show due to one of the band members being sick. Ghostface Killah replaced them on the main stage)
* Revolution Stage
** Ghostface Killah with P.A.W.N. LASERS / Louis Capet XXVI
** Funeral for a Friend (except shows from 27 to 30 August due to Reading and Leeds Festivals)
** downset.
** M.O.P. (except the first show due to travel plans)
** Mike V. and The Rats (select shows)
** No Warning (from 24 July to 13 August)
** Instruction (from 14 to 28 August)
** Autopilot Off (from 30 August to 5 September)

Setlist


== 2007 ==
For 2007, Linkin Park decided to make the tour ostensibly &quot;green&quot; by donating $1 of every ticket to American Forests through their charity Music for Relief and using biodiesel on a majority of their buses, eliminating an estimated 350 tons of carbon emissions. There were also informative booths that showed concert goers how to lower their greenhouse gas emissions.

It was revealed in Revolver magazine that Muse was in the list of bands Linkin Park had picked but couldn&#x27;t join Projekt Revolution as they had other commitments to deal with.

On August 22, 2007, MySpace.com streamed the concert live, allowing MySpace users to watch the concert for free from their performance at DTE Energy Music Theatre in Clarkston, Michigan. The event was hosted by Matt Pinfield.

Linkin Park sold their performance from the 2007 PR tour at the merchandise booth. Each CD came with a blank disc and a special code that allowed fans to download and burn that specific Linkin Park performance from the venue it was purchased at. The price of purchase for the CD was $11.00. It was sold at every venue except for Jones Beach in Wantagh, NY due to disagreements with the venue wanting a portion of the CD sales. In October 2013, Linkin Park revealed that they will relaunch Projekt Revolution in 2014; it is on the list for To-Come.

* Main Stage
** Linkin Park
** My Chemical Romance
** Taking Back Sunday
** HIM
** Placebo
** Julien-K
* Revolution Stage
** Mindless Self Indulgence
** Saosin
** The Bled
** Styles of Beyond
** Madina Lake (missed shows from 10 to 13 August due to Summer Sonic 2007)
**Art of Chaos (Winner of the Battle of the Bands selected to 7 dates on the tour from 28 July to 5 August)
Setlist


== 2008 ==
This was the first time the tour was also outside of North America. Their performance in Milton Keynes was announced months beforehand, which made it highly anticipated amongst fans waiting to attend. Jay-Z came out and performed a modified &quot;Numb/Encore&quot; and &quot;Jigga What/Faint&quot; with the band. This show turned out to be the biggest capacity Projekt Revolution to date. Camera operators obtaining interviews revealed intentions for a DVD, which has been confirmed by Mike Shinoda to be a CD/DVD set on November 25, 2008. Shinoda posted on the band&#x27;s online forum that anyone 18 or older can submit a title for the live CD/DVD which will later be turned into a poll for fans to vote for their favorite. Concerning the release date, Shinoda stated &quot;we will be releasing it in a DVD/CD combo pack as soon as we can get it done&quot;.

Linkin Park changed the set-lists up a little bit, giving new intros and outros to a few songs and playing &quot;We Made It&quot; every show, until Busta Rhymes left the tour. Chris Cornell also collaborated with the band by singing on &quot;Crawling&quot;. Also Chester Bennington performed &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; with Cornell. Street Drum Corps also performed a few songs with the band. On the two dates in Ohio, local band State Your Cause was asked to open the Revolution Stage.

=== Controversy during 2008 tour ===

During the Projekt Revolution Tour of 2008, Busta Rhymes was announced to have left the tour after only eleven days due to &quot;complicated business matters&quot;, amidst rumors he had been removed from the lineup after an alleged backstage confrontation with Linkin Park&#x27;s Mike Shinoda. Shinoda later posted on his blog that he and the rest of his band were disappointed to see Rhymes leave, implying that the rumour was false. Busta actually left the tour due to an argument with his now former label Interscope Records. Since he left the label, he no longer had support to be on the tour.

== 2011 ==

<doc id="894473" wikidata="Q1503458" url="?curid=894473" title="Howick, South Africa">
<text>Howick is a town located in the UMngeni Local Municipality of KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. The town is 1050 m above sea level, and about 88 kilometres from the port city of Durban. It experiences warm summers and cool, dry winters. A snappy chill descends upon Howick when snow falls on the nearby Drakensberg. The town is located on the N3 freeway, connecting it with the rest of South Africa.

The town is the location of Howick Falls, which is a large waterfall that occurs when the Umgeni River falls 95 metres (311 feet) over dolerite cliffs on its way to the Indian Ocean. The waterfall was known as kwaNogqaza or &quot;The Place of the Tall One&quot; by the original Zulu inhabitants. There are several other waterfalls in the vicinity and all of them have claimed human lives. Near Howick are Cascade Falls (25 m) and Shelter Falls (37 m), while Karkloof Falls (105 m) is 16 km to the east.

There are also a number of schools in Howick, including Howick High School.

== History ==

During the 1840s colonisers moving north from Pietermaritzburg crossed the Umgeni River just west of present-day Howick at the Alleman&#x27;s Drift. In 1849, the Wesleyan Missionary James Archbell bought three farms above the northern bank of the Umgeni River. Title deeds of the original plots simply named the area &quot;The Village on the Umgeni Waterfall&quot;. In 1850, the river crossing was moved to the dangerous but more convenient spot at the top of the Falls. This was less than from where the river plunged over the cliff&#x27;s edge. It was a treacherous spot, and many travellers and wagons were swept over the falls. With the increase in traffic to the north, the Government decided to establish a village at the crossing, and purchased part of James Archbell&#x27;s farm. In November 1850, a proclamation appeared in the Natal Government Gazette, offering 36 village allotments on the Umgeni Waterfall Drift for sale. This marked the beginning of the town. In choosing a name for the new town, Government officials decided to honour their Secretary of State for the Colonies in London. He was Earl Grey, and had recently acquired the title of Lord Howick. The name derived from his ancestral home of Howick Hall in Northumberland, England. Two other towns were named &quot;Howick&quot; at the same time: one in New Zealand, and the other in Ontario, Canada.

Howick is possibly the location of the first crewed flight in the world. Evidence exists that a John Goodman Household flew a self made glider in 1871 and again in 1875 on the outskirts of Howick, close to Karkloof. The actual distance flown and altitude achieved differs from source to source (some sources say the distance was ) but what can be verified is that the distance flown was further, and the duration also longer, than either of the flights made by Lilienthal or the Wright brothers. Today there exists a memorial to Household&#x27;s achievement at Curry&#x27;s Post, also a small distance outside Howick.

The Umgeni Valley Ranch or Nature Reserve was established in the 1970s on the then outskirts of Howick by the Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa (WESSA). The nature reserve consists largely of the deep valley cut by the Mngeni River below the Howick Falls into the surrounding sandstone. WESSA reintroduced game into the area, such as zebra and wildebeest, and established a number of huts for overnight accommodation.

In December 1996 Nelson Mandela was awarded &quot;The Freedom of Howick&quot;. This followed his arrest some 34 years before, on 5 August 1962, on the main Durban-Johannesburg road, as it was then — more particularly, between Howick and Lidgetton West. The previously small plaque commemorating the event has since been revamped into a fully operational Mandela Monument with a museum and large bust sculpture of Nelson Mandela, only fully distinguished when viewed from the end of the path from the museum towards the sculpture. The sculpture was created by Marco Cianfanelli and is constructed of steel beams of between in length.

The annual Mandela day marathon takes place in Imbali, Pietermaritzburg and finishes at the Mandela capture site in Howick.

In recent years Howick has expanded significantly following the establishment of a number of major retirement villages, such as Amberfield, Amberglen, Amber Valley, Amber Ridge, BrandonsField and Amber Lakes, that flank the Karkloof Falls Road.

<doc id="894478" wikidata="Q2412152" url="?curid=894478" title="Israelites (song)">
<text>&quot;Israelites&quot; is a song written by Desmond Dekker and Leslie Kong for their group, Desmond Dekker &amp; the Aces, which reached the top of the charts in numerous countries in 1969. Sung in Jamaican Patois, some of the song&#x27;s lyrics were not readily understood by many British and American listeners at the time of its release. Despite this, the single was the first UK reggae #1 and among the first to reach the US top ten (peaking at #9). It combined the Rastafarian religion with rude boy concerns, to make what has been described by Allmusic as a &quot;timeless masterpiece that knew no boundaries&quot;.

==Song==

===Origin and lyrics===
Originally issued in Jamaica as &quot;Poor Me Israelites&quot;, it remains the best known Jamaican reggae hit to reach the United States Hot 100&#x27;s top 10, and was written almost two years after Dekker first made his mark with the rude boy song &quot;007 (Shanty Town)&quot;. Dekker composed the song after overhearing an argument: &quot;I was walking in the park, eating popcorn. I heard a couple arguing about money. She was saying she needs money and he was saying the work he was doing was not giving him enough. I related to those things and began to sing a little song: &#x27;You get up in the morning and you&#x27;re slaving for bread.&#x27; By the time I got home, it was complete.&quot; The title has been the source of speculation, but most settle on the Rastafarian Movement&#x27;s association with the Twelve Tribes of Israel. In the 1960s, Jamaican Rastafarians were largely marginalized as &quot;cultish&quot; and ostracized from the larger society, including by the more conservative Christian church in Kingston. Destitute (&quot;slaving for bread&quot;) and unkempt (&quot;Shirt dem a-tear up, trousers a-gone&quot;), some Rastafarians were tempted to a life of crime (&quot;I don&#x27;t want to end up like Bonnie and Clyde&quot;). The song is a lament of this condition.

===Musical structure===
The vocal melody is syncopated and centred on the tone of B flat. The chords of the guitar accompaniment are played on the offbeat and move through the tonic chord [B flat], the subdominant [E flat], the dominant [F], and the occasional [D flat], viz, [B flat] - [E flat] - [F] - [B flat] - [D flat]. It was one of the first reggae songs to become an international hit, despite Dekker&#x27;s strong Jamaican accent which made his lyrics difficult for many listeners to understand outside of Jamaica.

===Impact===
Despite &quot;Israelites&quot; being recorded and released in 1968, the Uni 45 discography shows its copyright as 1969. In June 1969, the record reached the Top Ten in the United States, peaking at #9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. &quot;Israelites&quot; hit #1 in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Jamaica and West Germany.

&quot;Israelites&quot; brought a Jamaican beat to the British top 40 for the first time since Dekker&#x27;s #14 hit &quot;007 (Shanty Town)&quot; in 1967.

The disc was released in the UK in March 1969 and was #1 for one week, selling over 250,000 copies.
A global million sales was reported in June 1969.

===Follow-up and reissues===
Dekker had two more UK Top 10 hits over the next year, &quot;It Miek&quot; and his cover of Jimmy Cliff&#x27;s song &quot;You Can Get It If You Really Want&quot;.

Dekker recorded on the Pyramid record label, and when its catalogue was acquired by Cactus Records in 1975, &quot;Israelites&quot; was re-issued in a first-time stereo mix. Just over six years after the original release, the song again reached a Top Ten position in the United Kingdom.

In 1980, Dekker released a new recording of the song on UK label Stiff Records, performed in an uptempo Two Tone style. It was taken from an album of similar re-recordings of his old hits, &quot;Black &amp; Dekker&quot;.

===Appearance in other media===
The song has appeared in numerous movies and television programs, including the soundtracks of the 1989 American film &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; and the 2010 British film &quot;Made in Dagenham&quot;.

On November 3, 2019, &quot;Israelites&quot; was prominently featured in the third episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Watchmen&quot;. Potentially because of this usage, the song charted again, entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; Digital Reggae Song Sales Chart at #2.

<text>A Master of Fine Arts (MFA or M.F.A.)
is a terminal degree in fine arts, including visual arts, creative writing, graphic design, photography, filmmaking, dance, theatre, other performing arts and in some cases, theatre management or arts administration.
It is a graduate degree that typically requires two to three years of postgraduate study after a bachelor&#x27;s degree, though the term of study varies by country or university. Coursework is primarily of an applied or performing nature, with the program often culminating in a thesis exhibition or performance. The first university to admit students to the degree of Master of Fine Arts was the University of Iowa in 1940.

== Requirements ==
A candidate for an MFA typically holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree prior to admission, but many institutions do not require that the candidate&#x27;s undergraduate major conform with their proposed path of study in the MFA program. Admissions requirements often consist of a sample portfolio of artworks or a performance audition.

== Comparison with related degrees ==
The Master of Fine Arts differs from the Master of Arts in that the MFA, while still an academic program, centers on professional artistic practice in the particular field, whereas programs leading to the MA usually center on the scholarly, academic, or critical study of the field. Additionally, in the United States, an MFA is typically recognized as a terminal degree for practitioners of visual art, design, dance, photography, theatre, film/video, new media, and creative writing—meaning that it is considered the highest degree in its field, qualifying an individual to become a professor at the university level in these disciplines.

<doc id="894495" wikidata="Q1364956" url="?curid=894495" title="Holy door">
<text>A Holy Door () is traditionally an entrance portal located within the Papal major basilicas in Rome. The doors are normally sealed by mortar and cement from the inside so that they cannot be opened. They are ceremonially opened during Jubilee years designated by the Pope, for pilgrims who enter through those doors to piously gain the plenary indulgences attached with the Jubilee year celebrations.

In October 2015, Pope Francis expanded the tradition by having each Latin Catholic diocese throughout the world designate one or more local Holy Doors during the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, so that Catholics could gain the plenary indulgences granted during the Jubilee year without having to travel to Rome.

==History==
In 1300, Pope Boniface VIII began the tradition of the Holy Year, known as a Jubilee. The Catholic Church has celebrated them every 25 years or so ever since. A major part of the Holy Year for Catholics is a pilgrimage to Rome. The ritual passing over the threshold of the holy door symbolises the passing into the presence of God. At the same time, remission of the temporal punishment for the pilgrims&#x27; sins is granted, known as an indulgence.

One of the earliest accounts of the Holy Year dates back to a Spanish historian, traveler and pilgrim called Pedro Tafur in 1437. Tafur connects the Jubilee indulgence with the right of sanctuary for those who had escaped persecution. He noted its existence in pagan times for all who crossed the threshold of the &quot;Puerta Tarpea&quot;, previously upon the site of the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran. Accordingly, at the request of Emperor Constantine I, Pope Sylvester I published a Papal Bull proclaiming the same immunity from punishment for Christian sinners who took sanctuary there.

The privilege was quickly abused and at some point was even commercialised, resulting in popes ordering the door to be sealed with a wall, only to be unsealed during Jubilee years. The wall was destroyed and the door opened once in a hundred years. This was later reduced to fifty years and now &quot;opened at the will of the Pope&quot;.

In 1450, the Florentine merchant Giovanni Rucellai of Viterbo cites that the first Jubilee door was opened in 1423 under the pontificate of Pope Martin V.

Rucellai, who lived at the time also speaks of the five doors of the Lateran basilica:

Pope Alexander VI expanded the rite of the Jubilee year of 1500 by opening other doors in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Basilica of Saint Mary Major, and the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. This jubilee year began on Christmas and ended on the Feast of the Epiphany 1501. During the reign of Pope John VII the holy doors were opened every 33 years, reflecting the number of years attributed to the lifespan of Jesus Christ. This was later amended to 50 years in commemoration of the Hebrew custom of Jubilees and later changed to a centenary or at any time at the will of the reigning Pontiff.
Between 1500 and 1974, the entrance portal was barricaded by a solid wall, not a door. The popes began the ritual destruction of these walls, followed by masons, who completed the task of demolishing it. This rite was nearly always the principal subject depicted on the Jubilee medals issued by the Popes who have opened and closed the holy door at the beginning and end of each Jubilee year. Each of the four basilicas has its own holy door.

After closing the Holy Year on Christmas day 1950, Pope Pius XII replaced the wooden doors installed by Pope Benedict XIV in 1748, which had begun to fall into disrepair, with the 16-panelled bronze doors, modelled by Vico Consorti and cast by Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry, that are seen today.

==Symbolism==

In John 10:9, Jesus is quoted as saying, &quot;I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will be saved.&quot; In Luke 11:9 is found, &quot;And I tell you, ask and you will receive; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.&quot; Revelations 3:20 says, &quot;Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, (then) I will enter his house and dine with him, and he with me.&quot; Dom Albert Hammenstede O.S.B. noted that Porter was one of the minor orders. Herbert Thurston suggests that &quot;the symbolism of this ceremony may also have been influenced by the old idea of seeking sanctuary&quot;.

In the papal bull, &quot;Incarnationis mysterium&quot; of 29 November 1998, Pope John Paul II formally announced the Great Jubilee of 2000 saying that the Holy Door &quot;evokes the passage from sin to grace&quot;. The Holy Door represents &quot;a ritual expression of conversion&quot;.

&quot;A Holy Door ... is a visual symbol of internal renewal, which begins with the willing desire to make peace with God, reconcile with your neighbors, restore in yourself everything that has been damaged in the past, and reshape your heart through conversion.&quot;

==After the Second Vatican Council==
The most distinctive feature in the ceremonial of the jubilee is the unwalling and the final walling up of the &quot;holy door&quot; in each of the four great basilicas which the pilgrims are required to visit. The doors are opened by the pope at the beginning of the jubilee and then sealed up again afterwards. Historically, the doors were sealed with concrete. The Pontiff would use a silver hammer to remove it at the opening and a silver trowel to seal it again after the Jubilee. The Pope would pound on the wall, which would then be set to collapse. In 1975, Pope Paul VI, in light of the modernising changes of the Second Vatican Council, revised the rite by removing the use of trowel and ornate bricks at the closing rite.

This ritual caused injury to bystanders, and to Pope Paul VI himself while striking down the door, so for the Great Jubilee of 2000, Pope John Paul II simplified the rite considerably. Workers removed the concrete before the ceremony, so that the Pope only had to push on the doors with his hands. The holy door of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica was opened by the Pope on 24 December 1999. The doors of St. John Lateran and St. Mary Major were opened on 25 December and 1 January, respectively. 

Breaking with tradition, the Pope opened both of these personally, rather than delegating this to a cardinal. The doors of the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls were opened in an ecumenical ceremony on 18 January, first day of the World Week of Prayer for Christian Unity by the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury and a representative of the Ecumenical Patriarch. The door in St. Peter&#x27;s was closed on 6 January 2001, with the others being closed one day earlier.

Until the Great Jubilee of 2000, the Pope knocked upon the door three times with a silver hammer, singing the versicle &quot;Open unto me the gates of justice&quot;.

Above the holy door in St. Peter&#x27;s are marble memorial plates commemorating the last two times that the door has been opened. Since John Paul II and Francis held the last two Jubilees, both plates indicate that they opened and closed the door.

==Holy Year of Mercy==

In 2015, in announcing the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, Pope Francis declared, &quot;The Holy Door will become a Door of Mercy through which anyone who enters will experience the love of God who consoles, pardons, and instills hope.&quot; On 8 December 2015, Pope Francis opened the Holy Door of Mercy in the Basilica of St. Peter, marking the official start of the Jubilee Year of Mercy. A few days later, he presided at the opening of the Holy Door at the Archbasilica of St John Lateran. The Holy Door at St Paul&#x27;s Outside the Walls was opened by the Archpriest of that Basilica, Cardinal James Harvey. Pope Francis later opened the Holy Door at St Mary Major and at the Caritas center near Rome&#x27;s central train station.

Francis broke with tradition in removing the necessity of traveling to Rome. In October 2015, a temporal privilege was extended by Pope Francis through the Papal bull of Indiction, &quot;Misericordiae Vultus&quot; for an ordinary bishop to designate his own Holy Door for the purpose of the &quot;Jubilee Year of Mercy&quot;. Holy Doors were to be designated in every diocese throughout the world, and could be located at the diocesan Cathedral or at other popular church shrines. 

On 29 November 2015, prior to the official 8 December start of the Jubilee Year of Mercy, Pope Francis opened the Holy Door at the Cathédrale Notre-Dame in Bangui, Central African Republic. Holy Doors were subsequently opened in 40 different countries around the world, including locations such as Westminster Cathedral, Prinknash Abbey in Gloucestershire, and St. Paul&#x27;s Basilica in Toronto. 
In 2024, religious officials in Bethlehem expressed the hope that the Pope would declare the Door of Mercy at the Church of the Nativity a holy door.

==Other Holy Doors canonically designated by the Holy See==

The following is a list of Holy Doors designated in perpetuity by the Holy See.

* The oldest Holy Door outside Rome is in Santa Maria di Collemaggio church in L&#x27;Aquila in Italy built in an uncertain year in the 14th century for the Celestinian Forgiveness.
* In 1295 there was mention of a Holy Door in the main church of Atri, which had been established in that period: it is therefore thought that originally there must have been a small portal which was then replaced with the current one in 1305. We do not know for sure which Pope granted this privilege, perhaps Celestine V (whose mother was from Atri) or Boniface VIII (who had already risen to the papal throne in 1295). Every year the Holy Door is solemnly opened on August 14th and closed 8 days later, on August 22nd.[1]
* Pope Alexander III granted this privilege to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Spain by pontifical decree through his papal bull &quot;Regis Æterni&quot; on 25 July 1178, the Feast of Saint James, principal patron of Spaniards. 
* Pope Benedict XVI granted the privilege of opening a holy door to the Sanctuary of Saint John Vianney, Cure of Ars, in Formans, France in July 2007 for the 150th memorial death anniversary of Saint John Vianney.
* Pope Benedict XVI granted a holy door to the Pontifical University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines on 21 December 2010, to honour the university&#x27;s 400th anniversary in 2011. 
* Pope Francis gave the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in the city of Quebec, Canada, the privilege of opening a Holy Door on 8 December 2023 to mark its Jubilee Year as the first Catholic parish in North America north of Mexico, celebrating the 350th anniversary since its foundation on 11 July 1666. It was sealed in December 2024 and would not be reopened during the 2025 Jubilee.


== Conspiracy theories ==
In December 2024, viral posts on Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, and Facebook variously claiming falsely that the pope would be opening &quot;spiritual portals&quot; or &quot;sacred portals&quot; in a &quot;never-before-performed&quot; ritual as part of the 2025 Jubilee celebrations. Some posts also erroneously claimed that the ritual included opening a &quot;tomb of Lucifer&quot; under the Vatican. The claim of a new ritual appeared to stem from a &quot;New York Post&quot; article with a misleading title referring to the opening of an additional door at a Rebibbia prison. 

It is unclear where the Tomb of Lucifer claim originated. Bible scholar Daniel McClellan stated that a tomb in the Vatican Necropolis labeled as the &quot;Tomb of Lucifer&quot; may have begun the rumor and explained that that in pre-Constantinian times when the tomb was constructed, the name Lucifer did not have Satanic connotations and that contemporary Christians even had Lucifer as their personal name.

<text>Giorgos Mitsikostas () (born 12 October 1968) is a famous Greek comedic impressionist in Greece.

==Biography==
He started his professional career by impersonating Greek public figures, mainly sports people (e.g. famous sportscaster Giannis Diakogiannis and Filippas Sirigos) and politicians (prime ministers Konstantinos Karamanlis and Andreas Papandreou) on radio satiric shows on FM Radio station &quot;Athens 98.4&quot;. The name of his show had the -completely- random title, &quot;The conspirators of the night, in the conspiracy of the patsas&quot; (Greek: &quot;Οι συνωμότες της νύχτας, στη συνωμοσία του πατσά&quot;), in which his co-presenator was, the later well-known TV presenter, Nikos Evaggelatos.

But he was doing amateur radio shows some time before as university student (in the Buness Management department of AUEB) on college radio. His debut on TV was in 1990. Since then he has been on many Greek channels, and afterwards started to impersonate actors, singers and journalists as well, and changed the form of his shows. All of the titles of his shows are a word play, usually with his name.

It is said that sometimes when a Greek celebrity called a restaurant or a hotel to book a seat, the persons on the other end of the line thought it was Mitsikostas making pranks. Mitsikostas has admitted he has done such things in the past.

There is a famous political anecdote concerning the Greek politician and former prime minister of Greece for many years Andreas Papandreou, who upon first hearing the then mostly unknown Mitsikostas imitating him on the radio having a conversation with leader of the then opposition and also former Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis, called his minister, alarmed about a scam being raised against his party by imposters.

Mitsikostas also impersonates sports people from Greece. Such persons include Giorgos Georgiou, Kostas Karamanlis, Vassilios Tsiartas, Giorgos Karagounis, Christoforos Papakaliatis, Terence Quick, Evangelos Marinakis, Nikos Alefantos, Fotini Pipili, Konstantinos Mitsotakis, Dora Bakoyannis, Margaret Chant-Papandreou, Dušan Bajević, Kostas Kazakos, Sakis Rouvas, Vasilis Leventis, Antonios Nikopolidis, Theodoros Roussopoulos, Sotiris Ninis, Alexis Papahelas, Constantinos Christoforou, Dimitris Ververelis, Adonis Georgiadis, Anna Vissi, Lakis Lazopoulos, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Andreas Mikroutsikos, George Papandreou, Nikos Chatzinikolaou, Alexis Kougias and Stefanos Kasselakis.

<text>The bean weevils or seed beetles are a subfamily (Bruchinae) of beetles, now placed in the family Chrysomelidae, though they have historically been treated as a separate family. They are granivores, and typically infest various kinds of seeds or beans, living most of their lives inside a single seed. The subfamily includes about 1,650 species and are found worldwide.

Bean weevils are generally compact and oval in shape, with small heads somewhat bent under. Sizes range from 1 to 22 mm for some tropical species. Colors are usually black or brown, often with mottled patterns. Although their mandibles may be elongated, they do not have the long snouts characteristic of true weevils.

Adults deposit eggs on seeds, then the larvae chew their way into the seed. When ready to pupate, the larvae typically cut an exit hole, then return to their feeding chamber. Adult weevils have a habit of feigning death and dropping from a plant when disturbed.

Host plants tend to be legumes, but species will also be found in Convolvulaceae, Arecaceae, and Malvaceae, and several species are considered pests.

One characteristic of the beetles which can be seen in the photo is that the elytra are short, not quite reaching the tip of the abdomen.

Several species are native to Great Britain, but there are also records of several introduced species from stored products in warehouses and dwellings, although these species cannot proliferate outside of heated buildings in that climate.

==Genera==
This list of genera uses the new classification, treating the bean weevils as a subfamily with six extant tribes, eight or nine subtribes, and one extinct tribe. The former names and ranks for the tribes and subtribes under the old classification, treating the been weevils as a family, are given in parentheses (except for Myanmaropini, which was established only for the new classification).

<text>The is a subcompact car which has been produced by the Japanese manufacturer Honda since 1981.

The City was originally a 3-door hatchback/2-door convertible for the Japanese, European and Australasian markets. The 3-door City was retired in 1994 after the second-generation and replaced by the Logo. The nameplate was revived in 1996 for use on a series of subcompact four-door sedans aimed primarily at developing markets, first mainly sold in Asia but later also in Latin America and Australia. Since then, it has been a subcompact sedan built on Honda&#x27;s Global Small Car platform, which is shared with the Fit/Jazz (a 5-door hatchback), the Airwave/Partner, and the first-generation Mobilio — all of which share the location of the fuel tank under the front seats rather than rear seats. The seventh-generation model launched in 2019 features a significant size growth, offering an exterior dimension on par with the ninth-generation Civic sedan. This generation also marks the introduction of the 5-door hatchback model starting from 2020.

From 2002 to 2008, the City was also sold as the in Japan. The City is also sold as the Honda Ballade in South Africa since 2011. The City was reintroduced in Japan in 2014, this time called the up to its discontinuation in 2020. Between 2015 and 2019, Dongfeng Honda sold a remodeled version of the City called the Honda Greiz, and its 5-door liftback counterpart Honda Gienia.

== First generation (AA/FV/FA; 1981) ==
The first Honda City (AA for sedans, VF for vans and FA for the wider Turbo II and Cabriolets) was introduced in November 1981 with the innovative &quot;Tallboy&quot; design; of unusual height it enabled four adults to fit comfortably in the very short City (under ). Produced as a 3-door hatchback in a variety of trim levels, the City was also available together with the Motocompo, a special 50 cc &#x27;foldaway&#x27; scooter with designed to fit in the City&#x27;s small luggage area (&quot;trunk&quot;); called a trunk bike, Honda called this type of scooter &quot;trabai&quot;. At the time of its introduction, it was Honda&#x27;s smallest car, while not being in compliance with Japanese government &quot;kei&quot; regulations. It was longer than the Honda N360 by , but shorter than the first-generation Honda Civic by .

The Honda City Turbo was introduced in September 1982. It was powered by a turbocharged version of the 1231 cc Honda ER engine. A Pininfarina designed drop-top Cabriolet utilized the wider fenders and bigger bumpers of the Turbo II &quot;Bulldog&quot;, but was only available with the naturally aspirated engine. There was also a Pro-series of van versions with either two or four seats. A high-roof &quot;R Manhattan Roof&quot; version with a taller roof also appeared.

Exports of the City were primarily to Europe (where it was renamed Honda Jazz, due to Opel having trademarked the City name), Australia (in two-seater &#x27;van&#x27; form, to circumvent Australian import restrictions on passenger vehicles at the time) and New Zealand (where it was locally assembled). Production ended in late 1986 with the introduction of the GA type City.


== Second generation (GA; 1986) ==
Honda replaced the original City series AA in November 1986 with this generation (designated GA1), and again with an update in 1989 (GA2). This model was produced until 1994. The Fit name also first appeared as a trim variant of the second-generation City. There was no convertible model, with both the convertible and Turbo models of the previous generation continuing on sale for a little while. In most markets aside from Japan, the City&#x27;s market position was left open until filled by the Honda Logo in 1999.

On 31 October 1986, the second-generation City was introduced with the slogan &quot;City of Talent.&quot; in Japan, and was available at &quot;Honda Clio&quot; dealerships. The &quot;Honda Clio&quot; dealership chain was being positioned as Honda&#x27;s purveyor of luxuriously equipped vehicles like the Honda Legend, the Honda Concerto, and the Honda Accord, and this generation City enabled &quot;Clio&quot; locations to sell economically priced vehicles normally found at &quot;Honda Primo&quot;.

In this remodel, there are major changes in the appearance of the vehicle Honda called &quot;Crouching form&quot;, which consisted of a low and wide design that contributed to lighter vehicle weight (basic trim 680 kg) combined with improvements in driving performance. The styling reflects a corporate decision to enact a shared appearance with the first-generation Honda Today &quot;kei car&quot;, the internationally strong seller, third-generation subcompact Honda Civic, and the third-generation compact Honda Accord AeroDeck. This generation shared its exterior dimensions and engine size almost exactly with the first-generation Civic. The Honda CR-X was the only three-door hatchback that adopted a fastback, sloping rear hatch, similar to the &quot;Honda Verno&quot; products during the mid-1980s.

The engine configuration introduced the Honda D series, in the form of the type D12A, a 1.2 L SOHC straight-four 16-valve unit only available with a single carburetor, and basic level of equipment. The differences between the &quot;GG&quot;, &quot;EE&quot;, and &quot;BB&quot; were only in the level of equipment. Power is at 6,500 rpm. A five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission were optional.

In October 1988, the main engine was changed to 1.3 L SOHC inline-four, type D13C. In addition to the traditional single carburetor, Honda&#x27;s PGM-FI fuel injection was also offered on the new 1.3. The 1.2 L &quot;BE&quot; was the base model and had a single carburetor, as did the 1.3-litre &quot;CE&quot; and &quot;CG&quot; variants. PGM-FI was fitted to the sporting &quot;CR-i&quot; and &quot;CZ-i&quot; models.

The &quot;CE&quot; trim equipment with enhanced savings &quot;CE Fit&quot;, PGM-FI specification is &quot;CR-i&quot; based only high-trim &quot;CR-i Limited&quot; was introduced, the late &quot;CZ-i&quot; is defined as the minor trim package. The word &quot;Fit&quot; appears as a trim package on the base trim &quot;CE&quot;.

At the end of this generation, by trim consolidation, &quot;Fit&quot; is used for all single carburetor vehicles. The trim package &quot;Fit&quot; later became the model name of the successor of the Honda Logo which replaced this car.

The second generation was discontinued in 1993. In Japan, the name &quot;City&quot; was retired at the end of this series&#x27; conclusion of production. The replacement vehicles introduced in 1996 on the GA base were renamed Honda Logo (three-door hatchback, GA3/5 series), and the Honda Capa with five-door hatchback bodywork.
== Third generation (3A/SX; 1996) ==


The City was revived as a subcompact four-door sedan, slotting beneath the Honda Civic, for developing markets in Asia. The third-generation City (first-generation as a sedan), codenamed SX8 but with chassis codes 3A2 (1.3) and 3A3 (1.5), was based on the EF Civic platform to cut costs. It was designed for and sold in the Southeast Asian market only, and launched with the slogan &quot;Smart for the new generation&quot; for the 1.3-litre version and &quot;Top-in-class smart&quot; slogan for the 1.5-litre model. First production began in an all-new plant in Ayutthaya, Thailand, in April 1996. The car had a dominant position in the market. From the beginning, the Thai-made City models had more than 70% local content. The bumpers were constructed in three separate pieces to allow for easier shipping from Japan. There were originally a lower trim LXi and a higher-spec EXi available. The sedan also marked Honda&#x27;s entrance in the Indian market in 1998 and it quickly became a success and one of the top selling cars in its segment.

The City was built in additional markets including: India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Taiwan. In Pakistan, the City received a lukewarm reception at first, but the third generation was a massive hit. A revised, facelifted third-generation City was released in 2000, called the &quot;Type Z&quot; in some markets. By 2001 a model powered by Honda&#x27;s 1.5 L VTEC engines (VTI) appeared, with a rear-stabilizer for better handling. The facelift model received new front end tail lights, as well as one-piece bumpers.

The third-generation City had fuel-injected SOHC 16-valve D-series engines, namely variations of the D13B and D15B. The original D13B produced at 6,400 rpm for a claimed top speed of 171 km/h and 0–100 km/h in 11.3 seconds. This was later complemented by the 1.5-litre D15B, which was reduced in power for the Asian markets where the car was sold. The D15B engine also arrived in a version with VTEC (B15C2 engine).

== Fourth generation (GD/GE; 2002) ==

The fourth-generation City (second-generation as a sedan) made its world debut at the Thailand International Motor Expo in Bangkok in November 2002. Development of the vehicle continued to be handled by Honda Thailand. It was launched in Japan as the Fit Aria on 20 December 2002, as a captive import sourced from Thailand. The word &quot;aria&quot; is a type of expressive melody, usually heard in opera. Honda chose the word, continuing its musical naming tradition used with the Honda Prelude, the Honda Accord, the Honda Ballade, the Honda Quint, and the Honda Concerto. It was offered as a four-wheel drive version.

The City was initially launched with a twin-spark, lean burn ‘i-DSI’ engine producing 88PS that was primarily designed to provide outstanding fuel economy. The VTEC version was unveiled late in the fourth-generation City&#x27;s lifespan in 2004. The VTEC variant of the City is offered with 15-inch alloy wheels compared to the 14-inch offered in the i-DSI and the rear brakes are solid discs on the VTEC variant instead of drums in the i-DSI. Also, the VTEC model uses a 7-speed Multimatic CVT automatic transmission.

===Facelift===

In September 2005, a facelifted version of the City was launched in Thailand, in October 2005 in Malaysia, and in November 2005 in Indonesia. In Thailand, it is known as the City ZX. The most significant changes are a new exterior (new front grille, new headlamps, new fog lights, new tail lights and bumpers). The front end has been extended forward by while the rear has been extended by . The side mirror is electronically foldable. Both the i-DSI and VTEC trim levels have 15-inch alloy wheels as standard equipment. The changes in interior are minor but it does include an armrest for the driver and additional map lights. The interior colour tone of the VTEC variant is now black.

The L-series engine remained but the intake manifold has been repositioned, resulting in a 6 °C drop in the intake air temperature, the suspension has been uptrimd as well.

The City in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand uses the CVT gearbox for both i-DSI and VTEC variants. The CVT gearbox for the VTEC simulates a 7-speed automatic transmission with Tiptronic style override using paddle shift buttons on the steering wheel itself.

The fourth generation was resurrected in China as the Everus S1, a new budget car brand for Honda models discontinued elsewhere. The S1 stopped production in 2014.

===Everus S1 (China)===
In 2011, Chinese joint venture Guangqi Honda released a badge-engineered version of the fourth-generation City under their new Everus brand, called the S1. With the release of Everus, Honda became the first foreign automaker to develop vehicles under a brand owned by its local joint venture automaker in China.

The S1 is the first Everus car available for sale. It shares most of the characteristics found in the fourth-generation City. Dimensions and powertrains are identical as well with the S1 sporting the same 4,420 mm length and 1.3-litre i-DSi or 1.5-litre VTEC L-series petrol engine. The engines are paired to either a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission. The S1 concluded production in 2014.

== Fifth generation (GM2/3; 2008) ==
The fifth-generation City (third-generation as a sedan) was unveiled in Bangkok, Thailand in September 2008 followed by launches in India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore and China (Guangzhou Honda) in the following months. For the third-generation of the City, Honda has given the car a longer front overhang and wheelbase as well as a lower roof than the hatchback to give it more of an ideal sedan proportions compared to its predecessor.

The City was available with a range of four-cylinder engines include a 1.3-litre engine producing at 6,000 rpm, a 1.5-litre engine L15A7 putting out (138 hp), which both are available in manual and automatic transmissions with a paddle shifters variant (India, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia) For the 1.8-litre R18A engine only produce in (China markets only).

The City became the best-selling model of the company in the country, with sales volume even surpassing that of Thailand, previously the best selling market for the City. The City has been the leader in the mid-sized sedan segment for a decade, with 35% market share in 2010. In India it came with a 1.5-litre petrol engine mated to a manual transmission or a 5-speed automatic.

In Pakistan, the City was launched on 31 January 2009, just four months after its international debut.

According to a Honda Australia executive, Yasuhide Mizuno, the City would compete with other light sedans such as the Japanese built Toyota Yaris, the Korean-made Holden Barina and the Nissan Tiida. This was the first City released in Australia since the 1980s. It replaced the formerly smaller-sized Civics.

The City was launched in 2011 in South Africa as the Ballade, to fit below the Civic and above the Jazz sold there.

===Facelift===

In September 2011, Honda Thailand revealed the revamped City, with new front grille design, new front and rear bumpers, new taillamps design, new alloy wheels, eco driving indicator and dual front airbags to every model.

<text>Harbour Air Seaplanes is a scheduled floatplane service, tour and charter airline based in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. The predominantly seaplane airline specializes in routes between Vancouver, Nanaimo, Victoria, Sechelt, Comox, Whistler and the Gulf Islands, primarily with de Havilland Canada floatplanes. Harbour Air operates de Havilland Beavers, Otters and Twin Otters.

== History ==


The airline was established and started operations in 1982 as Windoak Air Service to provide seaplane charter services for the forestry industry in British Columbia. In 1993, Harbour Air purchased Trans-Provincial Airlines, added charter flights to resorts, and increased scheduled services. Today, Harbour Air refers to itself as the &quot;world&#x27;s largest all-seaplane airline&quot; and became North America&#x27;s first carbon neutral airline. A small subsidiary, , was set up in June 2007 and a DHC-3 Turbo Otter floatplane is permanently based in Valletta, Malta for scheduled flights to Gozo and sightseeing trips around the islands. &quot;Harbour Air Magazine&quot; is the official in-flight magazine of Harbour Air.

In 2007, Harbour Air became the first airline in North America to achieve complete carbon neutrality in both flight services and corporate operations. Teamed up with Vancouver-based Offsetters, the airline started to include a carbon offset on each ticket used to mitigate the environmental impact of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG&#x27;s) associated with the flight. The funds are invested in renewable energy projects.

On February 16, 2010, Deloitte Canada announced that Harbour Air was a winner of a 2009 Canada&#x27;s 50 Best Managed Companies Award. This national award is sponsored by Deloitte, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, &quot;National Post&quot; and Smith School of Business.

On March 31, 2010, Harbour Air completed the acquisition of West Coast Air and consolidated their terminal services.

On May 20, 2011, Harbour Air grounded its service from Victoria Harbour to Langley Regional Airport due to low passenger numbers and fuel price surges.

On May 9, 2012, Harbour Air purchased Whistler Air.

In September 2013, Harbour Air launched a land-based charter carrier, , which operated one Cessna 182 Skylane as ICAO airline designator TTU, and telephony TANTALUS.

In November 2015, Salt Spring Air was purchased by the Harbour Air Group. Salt Spring Air&#x27;s fleet now joins Harbour Air, West Coast Air and Whistler Air and now claims to be largest seaplane airline in the world.

Harbour Air and Kenmore Air started a new seaplane service between Downtown Vancouver, and Downtown Seattle on April 26, 2018.

In March 2019, Harbour Air announced a partnership with magniX to electrify the entire Harbour Air fleet over the long term. Harbour Air has noted that its initial electric-powered commercial flights will be on routes of under 30 minutes&#x27; duration. The first converted aircraft was a DHC-2 Beaver which serves as the test prototype for the magniX motor, energy storage, and control systems. The prototype flew for the first time on December 10, 2019. The company hopes to have the aircraft certified for commercial use by 2021.

===Electric aviation===
In March 2019, Harbour Air announced plans to convert an aircraft to run on electricity, which would serve as a test prototype during a two-year duration regulatory approval process, and eventually hoped to convert its entire fleet to electric propulsion. The first plane to be converted was a de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver.

The electric prototype made its first flight over 4 minutes off the Fraser River near Vancouver on December 10, 2019. The Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior piston engine of the six-passenger ePlane was replaced by a , magni500, with swappable batteries allowing 30 minute flights plus 30 minutes of reserve power.
Harbour Air wants to convert all its aircraft, including Beavers and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6-powered Otters and Twin Otters.

Three years later, the plane completed its first point-to-point test flight, from Vancouver to Victoria Airport Water Aerodrome near Sidney on Vancouver Island, on August 18, 2022, travelling in 24 minutes. The aircraft was displayed at the British Columbia Aviation Museum open house on August 20 the same year.

== Awards and accolades==

Harbour Air has won the following awards:

* 2009 to 2014 – Canada&#x27;s Best Managed Companies
* 2009 to 2011 – BC&#x27;s Top 55 Employers

== Fleet ==
As of January 2025, the Harbour Air fleet consisted of 41 aircraft and 43 registered with Transport Canada:

== Accidents and incidents ==
On August 4, 1998, a de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, registration C-FOCJ, overturned after landing near Ging̱olx, at Kincolith Water Aerodrome. On the fourth approach, the floatplane touched down, apparently in a controlled manner, and skipped on the water surface. The floats then dug into the water followed by the right wing, which was severed from the fuselage on water impact. The aircraft quickly overturned. All five aboard drowned.

On June 8, 2024, a de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver (same airframe rebuilt from the 1998 crash), registration C-FFHA collided with a boat upon takeoff at Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre.

<text>The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering; previously Columbia School of Mines) is the engineering and applied science school of Columbia University, a private research university in New York City. It was founded as the School of Mines in 1863 and then the School of Mines, Engineering and Chemistry before becoming the School of Engineering and Applied Science. On October 1, 1997, the school was renamed in honor of Chinese businessman Z.Y. Fu, who had donated $26 million to the school.

The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science maintains a close research tie with other institutions including NASA, IBM, MIT, and The Earth Institute. Patents owned by the school generate over $100 million annually for the university. SEAS faculty and alumni are responsible for technological achievements including the developments of FM radio and the maser.

The current SEAS faculty include 27 members of the National Academy of Engineering and one Nobel laureate. In all, the faculty and alumni of Columbia Engineering have won 10 Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry, medicine, and economics.

The school consists of approximately 300 undergraduates in each graduating class and maintains close links with its undergraduate liberal arts sister school Columbia College which shares housing with SEAS students. The School&#x27;s current dean is Shih-Fu Chang, who was appointed in 2022.

==History==

===Original charter of 1754===
Included in the original charter for Columbia College was the direction to teach &quot;the arts of Number and Measuring, of Surveying and Navigation [...] the knowledge of [...] various kinds of Meteors, Stones, Mines and Minerals, Plants and Animals, and everything useful for the Comfort, the Convenience and Elegance of Life.&quot; Engineering has always been a part of Columbia, even before the establishment of any separate school of engineering.

An early and influential graduate from the school was John Stevens, Class of 1768. Instrumental in the establishment of U.S. patent law, Stevens procured many patents in early steamboat technology, operated the first steam ferry between New York and New Jersey, received the first railroad charter in the U.S., built a pioneer locomotive, and amassed a fortune, which allowed his sons to found the Stevens Institute of Technology. (Excerpt from SEAS website.)

When Columbia University first resided on Wall Street, engineering did not have a school under the Columbia umbrella. After Columbia outgrew its space on Wall Street, it relocated to what is now Midtown Manhattan in 1857.
Then President Barnard and the Trustees of the University, with the urging of Professor Thomas Egleston and General Vinton, approved the School of Mines in 1863. The intention was to establish a School of Mines and Metallurgy with a three-year program open to professionally motivated students with or without prior undergraduate training. It was officially founded in 1864 under the leadership of its first dean, Columbia professor Charles F. Chandler, and specialized in mining and mineralogical engineering.
An example of work from a student at the School of Mines was William Barclay Parsons, Class of 1882. He was an engineer on the Chinese railway and the Cape Cod and Panama Canals. Most importantly he worked for New York, as a chief engineer of the city&#x27;s first subway system, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. Opened in 1904, the subway&#x27;s electric cars took passengers from City Hall to Brooklyn, the Bronx, and the newly renamed and relocated Columbia University in Morningside Heights, its present location on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

===Renaming to the School of Mines===
In 1896, the school was renamed to the &quot;School of Mines, Engineering and Chemistry&quot;. During this time, the University was offering more than the previous name had implied, thus the change of name.

The faculty during this time included Michael I. Pupin, after whom Pupin Hall is named. Pupin himself was a graduate of the Class of 1883 and the inventor of the &quot;Pupin coil&quot;, a device that extended the range of long-distance telephones. Students of his included Irving Langmuir, Nobel laureate in Chemistry (1932), inventor of the gas-filled tungsten lamp and a contributor to the development of the radio vacuum tube. Another student to work with Pupin was Edwin Howard Armstrong, inventor of FM radio. After graduating in 1913 Armstrong was stationed in France during World War I. There he developed the superheterodyne receiver to detect the frequency of enemy aircraft ignition systems. During this period, Columbia was also home to the &quot;Father of Biomedical Engineering&quot; Elmer L. Gaden.

===Recent and future developments===

The university continued to evolve and expand as the United States became a major political power during the 20th century. In 1926, the newly renamed School of Engineering prepared students for the nuclear age. Graduating with a master&#x27;s degree, Hyman George Rickover, working with the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ships, directed the development of the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine, the Nautilus, which was launched in 1954.

The school&#x27;s first woman graduate received her degree in 1945. After a substantial grant of $26 million from Chinese businessman Z. Y. Fu, the engineering school was renamed again in 1997. The new name, as it is known today is the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. SEAS continues to be a teaching and research institution, now with a large endowment of over $400 million, and sits under the Columbia umbrella endowment of $7.2 billion.

==Admissions==
The admissions rate for the SEAS undergraduate class of 2018 was approximately 7%.

Approximately 95% of accepted students were in the top 10% of their graduating class; 99% were in the top 20% of their class. 58% of admitted students attended high schools that do not rank. The yield rate for the class of 2014 was 59%.

As for SAT scores, SEAS students within the Columbia University community have raised the composite SAT statistic for the undergraduates at Columbia University. The Class of 2013&#x27;s SAT interquartile range was 2060–2320 and 1400–1560 (old SAT). The ACT composite interquartile range was 32–34.

Those accepting enrollment at Columbia SEAS typically completed engineering programs at the undergraduate level and are pursuing professional graduate school in engineering, business, law, or medical school, so as to become what Columbia terms &quot;engineering leaders.&quot; Engineering leaders are those who pioneer or define engineering: patent lawyers, doctors with specialties in biophysical engineering, financial engineers, inventors, etc.

Columbia Engineering&#x27;s graduate programs have an overall acceptance rate of 28.0% in 2010. The PhD student–faculty ratio at the graduate level is 4.2:1 according to the 2008 data compiled by U.S. News &amp; World Report. PhD acceptance rate was 12% in 2010.

==Specialized centers==

Columbia Engineering faculty are a central force in creating many groundbreaking discoveries that today are shaping life tomorrow. They are at the vanguard of their fields, collaborating with other world-renowned experts at Columbia and other universities to bring the best minds from a myriad of disciplines to shape the future.

Large, well-funded interdisciplinary centers in science and engineering, materials research, nanoscale research, and genomic research are making step changes in their respective fields while individual groups of engineers and scientists collaborate to solve theoretical and practical problems in other significant areas. Last year, Columbia Engineering&#x27;s 2007–2008 research expenditures were $92,000,000, a very respectable number given the small size of the school. Harvard&#x27;s research expenditures in the same period were $35,000,000. Columbia Engineering PhD students have ~60% more monetary resources to work with using the research expenditure : PhD student ratio.

==Specialized labs==
The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science occupies five laboratory and classroom buildings at the north end of the campus, including the Schapiro Center for Engineering and Physical Science Research and the new Northwest Building on Morningside Heights. Because of the School&#x27;s close proximity to the other Morningside facilities and programs, Columbia engineering students have access to the whole of the University&#x27;s resources.

The School is the site of an almost overwhelming array of basic and advanced research installations which include both the NSEC and the MRSEC NSF-funded interdisciplinary research centers, as well as the Columbia High-Beta Tokamak, the Robert A.W. Carleton Strength of Materials Laboratory, and a 200g geotechnical centrifuge.

The Botwinick Multimedia Learning Laboratory is the School&#x27;s facility for computer-aided design (CAD) and media development. It is equipped with 50 Apple Mac Pro 8-core workstations, as well as a cluster of Apple Xserves with Xraid storage, that serve the lab&#x27;s 300-plus users per semester.

==Other programs==
* Undergraduate Research Involvement Program
**Each SEAS department sponsors opportunities to do novel undergraduate research which have applications in the real world. Departmental Chairs supervise students through the process, and mentoring with a professor is provided.
* Materials science and engineering
** Program in the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, sharing teaching and research with the faculty from Henry Krumb School of Mines.
* Computer engineering
** Administered by both the electrical engineering and computer science departments through a joint computer engineering committee.
* The combined plan program
** The 3–2, B.A./B.S., is designed to provide students with the opportunity to receive both a B.A. degree from an affiliated liberal arts college and a B.S. degree from SEAS within five years. Students complete the requirements for the liberal arts degree along with a pre-engineering course of study in three years at their college and then complete two years at Columbia.

<text>Lashio ( ; Shan: ) is the largest town in northern Shan State, Myanmar, about north-east of Mandalay. It is situated on a low mountain spur overlooking the valley of the Yaw River. Loi Leng, the highest mountain of the Shan Hills, is located to the south-east of Lashio.

Lashio is the administrative center of Lashio Township and Lashio District; before April 2010, it was also the administrative center of Shan State (North). The population grew from approximately 5000 in 1960 to 88,590 in 1983. It was estimated at approximately 131,000 in 2009. It was captured by rebel forces in early August 2024.

The population is made up of mostly Shan, Chinese and Burmans.

==History==
The British colonial period in this part of the country began in 1887, and the Myanmar Railways line from Mandalay reached Lashio in 1903.

Before British rule Lashio was also the centre of authority for the northern Shan States, but the Burmese post in the valley was close to the Nam Yao, in an old Chinese fortified camp. The Lashio valley was formerly very populous; but a rebellion, started by the sawbwa of Hsenwi, about ten years before the British occupation, ruined it.

In 1900, the town of Lashio consisted of the European station, with court house and quarters for the civil officers; the military police post, the headquarters of the Lashio battalion of military police; and the native station, in which the various nationalities, Shans, Burmans, Hindus and Muslims, who were divided into separate quarters, with reserves for government servants and for the temporary residences of the five sawbwas of the northern Shan States; and a bazaar.

Lashio became important during the Sino-Japanese War and World War II as the Burmese terminus of the Burma Road. In World War II, Lashio was taken by the Japanese on April 29, 1942 and liberated by the Allies on March 7, 1945.

During Operation 1027 of the Myanmar Civil War, the town was surrounded by the Ta&#x27;ang National Liberation Army and other rebel forces who took towns around Lashio, although fighting did not immediately take place in the town itself. Many people displaced from fighting elsewhere fled to Laisho for safety. After the ceasefire that ended the operation collapsed, the MNDAA and its allies launched a renewed attack to seize the town, culminating in the Battle of Lashio, where rebel forces were victorious. On 20 January 2025, the MNDAA and the junta agreed to a Chinese-brokered ceasefire, with several sources claiming that a withdraw of the former from Lashio was a condition for the deal. However, neither the junta nor the MNDAA has revealed any details of the deal.

<text>Cisco Videoscape (formerly NDS Group and currently known as Synamedia) was a majority owned subsidiary of News Corp, which develops software for the pay TV industry (including cable, satellite and others). NDS Group was established in 1988 as an Israeli start up company. It was acquired by Cisco in 2012 before being sold back to the private equity company Permira in 2018 for US$1 billion. The company is currently headquartered in Staines, United Kingdom.

Filling The Executive Chairman and CEO roles at NDS is Abe Peled with former CEO Dave Habiger having left in 2012. The company&#x27;s major product is the VideoGuard conditional access system, which is used by more than 85 leading pay TV operators around the world. NDS technology includes end to end connections for satellite, broadband IPTV, Hybrid, OTT, and EPGs. It has launched VideoGuard Connect, the DRM for Pay-TV, designed to help TV operators to seamlessly extend their pay-TV services to connected media devices, enabling secure ingestion, delivery and consumption of premium content over both managed and OTT networks while maintaining subscription privileges across devices.
NDS also provides advanced advertising, professional services and system integration services. New ways to secure content on PCs, tablets, and other devices are displayed at IBC and CES.

Cisco Systems announced the acquisition of the company in March, 2012. It was later acquired successfully and in 2014 its name was changed into Videoscape, becoming a part of Cisco. In 2018 it was announced that Cisco would sell this part of the business, with Permira successfully acquiring it and it being branded as Synamedia.

==History==

The development of the technology on the basis which the company was founded on, began in 1983, at the Weizmann Institute by Professor Adi Shamir (who had previously developed the RSA encryption algorithm), together with his research students Amos Fiat and Yossi Tulpen. The first application they developed was a digital rights management solution aimed at protecting software from being copied illegally. They then developed a smart card to prevent counterfeits, which were first intended to protect credit card transactions. The patent of the card is registered in the name of Yeda Research &amp; Development Co., the commercial arm of the Weizmann Institute of Science. In those years, media mogul Rupert Murdoch began to develop his television business, which included satellite TV broadcasts for a fee, and a pay-per-view service for movies and sporting events. In order to charge a fee based on viewing, and to maintain his agreements with the film companies and the owners of the sports broadcasting rights, he looked for a way to encrypt the broadcasts. An Australian entrepreneur named Bruce Hundertmark contacted Shamir and the Weizmann Institute and between them and Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp. corporation. News Corp. was impressed with their &quot;smart card&quot; technology and decided to invest in its development.

The company was established in 1988 as &quot;News Datacom (NDC)&quot; by Dr. Dov Rubin, Jonathan (Yoni) Hashkes, Michael Dick, and Yishai Sered - and soon joined by Mickey Cohen and Gershon Baron - in partnership with News Corporation and the Weizmann Institute, a university and research institute in Rehovot, Israel. The company was renamed News Datacom Research, and additional investors joined. The company signed a contract with BSkyB, in which News Corp. had a 35% stake, for the development of an encryption system. 

In 1992, one year after finalizing its product, the company was acquired by its primary customer, News Corp, for $15 million, and renamed &quot;News Digital Systems (NDS)&quot;. In 1996 NDS merged with Digi-Media Vision (DMV) a video compression company that News had acquired in 1995 which had been the Advanced Products Division [APD] of National Transcommunications Limited [NTL] in the UK. In 1999 the video compression division of NDS was sold to Tandberg Television (now MediaKind) and, separately, the company began trading as a public company on the NASDAQ stock exchange. In 2009, Permira and News Corporation announced a $3.6 billion arrangement for buying the public holding in NDS, turning it into a privately held company.

==Legal issues==

===Israeli tax investigation===
In 1996, NDS was investigated by Israeli authorities for allegations of tax irregularities. None was proven but NDS later paid a $3m settlement to close the case.

===Canal Plus lawsuit===
In 2002, Groupe Canal+ accused NDS of extracting the UserROM code from the MediaGuard cards and leaking it onto the internet.
According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the NDS laboratory in Haifa, Israel had been working on breaking the SECA-produced MediaGuard smartcards used by Canal+, ITV Digital and other non-Murdoch-owned TV companies throughout Europe. Canal+ brought a $3 billion lawsuit against NDS but later dropped the action. News Corporation agreed to buy Canal Plus&#x27;s struggling Italian operation Telepiù.

===Echostar lawsuit===
Echostar sued NDS for $1 billion for piracy and copyright infringement of the Echostar viewing card codes and for aiding the distribution and supply of pirate Echostar viewing cards for the Echostar-owned Dish Network. EchoStar alleged that in the 90&#x27;s NDS was responsible for the compromise of EchoStar&#x27;s satellite television programming platform through the posting of code on the DR7 website. NDS vigorously defended the allegations made against it, establishing that NDS played no part in the compromise of EchoStar&#x27;s security system. In 2008, a jury in California convicted NDS of violating the Federal Communications Act and California Penal Code, cleared NDS of other charges, and awarded $1,500 in damages.

In August 2010, the Ninth Circuit stated in its decision that “EchoStar did not succeed &#x27;on any significant issue&#x27; or &#x27;achieve any of the benefit it sought in bringing suit&#x27; under the Communications Act.” The Ninth Circuit awarded NDS US$18 million and concluded that “There is no question that NDS successfully defended against all of EchoStar’s claims based on or related to its theory that NDS was responsible for the compromise of EchoStar’s satellite television programming security system.”

In February 2011, the Ninth Circuit further stated, “NDS was the prevailing party in this litigation and that EchoStar fails to meet the legal definition of a prevailing party on any of its claims.”

In January 2012, the Supreme Court of the United States of America denied a petition to hear a challenge by EchoStar. EchoStar and NDS agreed that the terms for satisfying the judgment should be met by 9 March 2012.

On 9 March 2012, NDS received from EchoStar the remaining balance of US$18,935,399.49, in full satisfaction of the final judgment, including district court fees and costs, appellate court fees and costs and all interest.

===BBC Panorama===
On 26 March 2012, the BBC programme Panorama broadcast that NDS employed computer hacking to undermine the business of ONDigital. At the time, ONDigital was the primary TV rival in Britain of BSkyB, a News Corporation company. The accusations arise from emails obtained by the BBC, and an interview with Lee Gibling, the operator of a hacking website, who claims he was paid up to £60,000 per year by Ray Adams, NDS head of security. UK broadcasting watchdog Ofcom is to investigate these claims. These claims are vigorously denied by NDS and NewsCorp.

===Australian Financial Review Allegations===
On 27 March 2012, the Australian Financial Review published further allegations about NDS&#x27; involvement in hacking the systems of competitors. The Australian Financial Review also published online a sample of 14,400 emails allegedly taken from the computer of former NDS head of security Ray Adams. The investigation by the paper alleges that NDS illegally undermined rivals Austar, Optus and Foxtel at a time when parent company News Corporation was moving to take control of the Australian pay TV industry. In response to these allegations, Australia&#x27;s communication minister Steven Conroy called for a police investigation. In response to the allegations, News Limited, the Australian arm of News Corporation released the following statement: &quot;The story is full of factual inaccuracies, flawed references, fanciful conclusions and baseless accusations which have been disproved in overseas courts,&quot;

==Products and customers==
As of December 2011, NDS VideoGuard CA and DRM were deployed in more than 125 million digital pay-TV households. MediaHighway set-top-box software has been deployed in more than 214 million set-top boxes. XTV PVR/DVR technology is used by more than 20 operators in more than 47 million set-top-boxes.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kosaka has declined by more than two-thirds since 1960.

==History==
The area of present-day Kosaka was part of ancient Mutsu Province and was ruled by the Nambu clan of Morioka Domain during the Edo period. The “Kosaka-kaido” highway connecting Morioka Domain with Hirosaki Domain passed through Kosaka. Under the Nambu, major deposits of gold and silver were mined by the Fujita-gumi, the predecessor to modern Dowa Holdings for the Nambu clan at the Kosaka mine. After the start of the Meiji period, the area became briefly part of Rikuchū Province before being transferred to Akita Prefecture in 1871. It was organized as part of Kazuno District, Akita Prefecture in 1878. The village of Kosaka was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It was raised to town status on May 12, 1914.

==Economy==
The town prospered greatly as a mining center for gold, silver, copper and zinc in the Meiji period, and many modern buildings were built, including the Kosaka mining office. After the Second World War, mining resources were depleted and the town declined.
In recent years, there have been efforts to find ways to create a town that makes use of the modern architecture of the Meiji period and the tourism resources of Lake Towada. In addition to this, Dowa Holdings, the owner of the Kosaka Mine, is active in the metal recycling industry. In terms of light manufacturing, the Towada Audio Corporation, a manufacturer of shortwave radio sets, TV tuners and AC adapters in the Sony group, is based in Kosaka.

<text>The AEG B.III was a German two-seat biplane reconnaissance aircraft produced in very small numbers from 1915. It was a further refinement of the B.I and B.II, with a fresh tailplane assembly, but was still only just adequate in performance and did not attract much interest. The B.III was put into reconnaissance and training roles in 1915, but was soon replaced by armed aircraft in the German military.

<text>The AEG C.I was a two-seat biplane reconnaissance aircraft produced in small numbers from March 1915 by the German company Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG). It was essentially an AEG B.II armed with a single 7.92 mm (.312 in) Parabellum or Bergmann (rarely) machine gun mounted at the rear of the cockpit for the observer and a more powerful engine. The Benz engine increased maximum speed to a more respectable 130 km/h (81 mph). By October 1915, it had begun to be replaced by the AEG C.II.

<doc id="894546" wikidata="Q1205482" url="?curid=894546" title="Kamikoani">
<text>is a village located in Akita Prefecture, Japan. , the village had an estimated population of 2,012 in 1097 households, and a population density 7.8 persons per km2. The total area of the village is .

==Geography==

*Akita
*Gojōme
*Kitaakita
*Mitane
*Noshiro

===Climate===
Kamikoani has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;) with large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is heaviest from August to October. The average annual temperature in Kamikoani is 9.8 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1626 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 23.3 °C, and lowest in January, at around -3.2 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kamikoani peaked at around the year 1960 and has been in steady decline since then.

==History==
A “Kotani Village” in Dewa Province is mentioned in records of the area from the period of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. During the Edo period, the area came under the control of the Satake clan, who ruled the northern third of the province from Kubota Domain. After the start of the Meiji period, the area became part of Kitaakita District, Akita Prefecture in 1878. The village of Kamikoani was founded on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system.

===Physician shortage===
The village received considerable negative publicity in the 2000s due to widely publicized issues pertaining to doctor shortages in rural areas. According to these reports, in February 2008, a male doctor who had been working in remote areas for more than 20 years started working in Kamikoani. He said &quot;This village is the last place in my career as a doctor. I want to continue medication as I have love and interest for people.&quot; before working. In fourth month after starting, he intimated his intention of resigning, and quit two months later. In 2009, Yukiko Arisawa, a 61-year-old female doctor, started working Kamikoani, after working on isolated islands and in Thailand. She intimated her intention of resigning in March 2010, but postponed until March 2011 because of concerns that it would take time to find a replacement. For these sudden resignations, &quot;Kouhou Kamikoani&quot;, the official public relations magazine published by the village office, reported that the doctors suffered from constant harassment by the local villagers. According to the magazine, she had bullying phone calls, and her efforts were criticized. When she installed a light with a sensor in front of her house to deal with patients at night, she was accused of wasting tax money, even though she had paid for the light and the monthly electricity bill herself. Another villager said &quot;&quot;I wonder how you could go shopping with having patients waiting.&quot; when she went to buy sandwiches because she had no time to have lunch. She managed to have only 18 holidays in 2009, but some people said &quot;How can you have a holiday on weekdays?&quot;&quot; and criticized when she had a holiday on August 17. And, someone scattered defamatory leaflet in front of her house.

==Government==
Kamikoani has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral village legislature of seven members. Kamikoani, together with the city of Noshiro and the other municipalities of Yamamoto District contributes four members to the Akita Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the village is part of Akita District 2 of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The economy of Kamikoani is based on agriculture.

==Education==
Kamikoani has one combined elementary/middle school operated by the village government. The village does not have a high school.

==Transportation==

<text>is a rural district located in Akita Prefecture, Japan.

As of April 2022, the district consists of only the village of Kamikoani with an estimated population of 2,089 and an area of 256.82 km2. All of the cities of Kitaakita and Ōdate, and part of the city of Noshiro were formerly part of Kitaakita District.

==Towns and villages==
*Kamikoani

==History==
The area of Kitaakita District was formerly part of Akita District [ja], Dewa Province. Dewa Province was divided into the provinces of Ugo Province and Uzen Province following the Meiji restoration on January 19, 1869, with the area of Kitaakita becoming part of Ugo Province. At the time, the area consisted of two towns (Ōdate and Junishō) and 117 villages formerly under the control of Kubota Domain. Akita Prefecture was founded on December 13, 1871.


==History==
With the establishment of the municipality system on April 1, 1889, modern Kitaakita District, with two towns (Ōdate and Junishō) and 29 villages was established.

*1896 - Ogita was elevated to town status.
*1897 - Aniai was elevated to town status.
*1900 - Takanosu was elevated to town status.
*1902 - Yonaizawa was elevated to town status.
*1932 - Hanaoka was elevated to town status.
*1947 - Hayaguchi was elevated to town status.
*1951 - Ōdate was elevated to city status.
*1955 - Hanaoka was renamed Hanaya, Ogita was renamed Hinai, the town of Aikawa was established by the consolidation of four villages, and the town of Junisho was merged into Ōdate.
*1956 - Hayaguchi was renamed Tashiro, and Yonaizawa became Moriyoshi.
*1967 - The town of Hanaya was absorbed into Ōdate.
*On March 22, 2005 - the towns of Aikawa, Ani, Moriyoshi and Takanosu were merged to create the city of Kitaakita.
*On June 20, 2005 - the towns of Hinai and Tashiro were merged into the expanded city of Ōdate. Following this merger, Kitaakita District was left with only the village of Kamikoani.

<text>The AEG C.II was a German two-seat biplane reconnaissance aircraft produced in small numbers from October 1915. It was a slightly smaller version of the C.I with better performance, redesigned cockpit for both pilot and observer/bombardier, new rear mounting for a 7.92 mm (.312 in) Parabellum MG14 machine gun, and the ability to carry four 10 kg (22 lb) bombs for light attack duties.

Only one C.II was shown in German front inventory, on 30 April 1916.

<text>The AEG C.III was a two-seat biplane reconnaissance aircraft, a single prototype of which was built during World War I. The aircraft featured an unusual fuselage design that completely filled the gap between the upper and lower sets of wings, to provide the pilot with improved vision, and to allow the observer a wider field of fire for his 7.92 mm (.312 in) machine gun. The pilot sat to the rear of the observer, who was stationed over the upper wing. This design was not as successful as had been hoped, and the C.III was never entered into service. Despite being heavier than the C.II, its maximum speed increased to 158 km/h (98 mph).

<doc id="894556" wikidata="Q291359" url="?curid=894556" title="AEG C.IV">
<text>The AEG C.IV was a two-seat biplane reconnaissance aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft.

The C.IV was developed from the earlier AEG C.II in response to an urgent requirement from the Luftstreitkräfte (Imperial German Army Air Service) for better fixed-wing aerial reconnaissance platforms. Featuring a relatively short fuselage in comparison to its wingspan, it appeared somewhat ungainly. The aircraft&#x27;s structure was largely composed of steel tubing; uncommon features of the design included a distinctive &#x27;bite&#x27; on the trailing edge of the wing on production aircraft, and the three-position adjustable tail plane incidence. To accelerate production, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker were ordered to produce the C.IV under license.

Entering service with the Luftstreitkräfte during 1916, the C.IV promptly proved itself to be a capable aircraft. In addition to performing reconnaissance missions, it was also used as a bomber escort, despite being inadequately powered for this role. Several variants, including the &quot;C.IV.N&quot; and the &quot;C.IVa&quot;, were developed. It continued to be operated by the Luftstreitkräfte through to the end of the conflict. In addition to its use by the German Empire, the C.IV also drew the attention of other nations, both the Turkish Flying Corps and Polish Air Force would operate numerous aircraft while other nations, such as Belgium, evaluated the type. It saw extensive combat use during the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920 prior to being withdrawn for good during the early 1920s.

==Design and development==
By 1916, a growing number of senior officers within the Luftstreitkräfte (Imperial German Army Air Service) were advocated for greater emphasis to be placed upon aerial reconnaissance, noting both its value and the increased capability for such missions that the production of a new generation of purpose-build reconnaissance aircraft could bring to Germany&#x27;s war effort. As such, several factories were tasked with the rapid development and production of C type aircraft with the intention of equipping several new frontline squadrons as soon as feasibly possible. It was under this programme that the C.IV would be selected and placed into production.

The design of the C.IV was heavily derived from the earlier AEG C.II, the most visually obvious differences being the new aircraft&#x27;s enlarged wingspan and the adoption of an additional forward-firing Spandau-type 7.92 mm (.312 in) machine gun. It had a relatively short fuselage that gave it a somewhat ungainly appearance. Structurally, aside from the wooden ribs within the wing, various gauges of steel tubing were used, the fuselage featuring braced box-girder construction, which was mostly welded together; this construction approach was uncommon at the time amongst German aircraft. Key locations were strengthened via steel lug nuts, which were also used as mounting points for the attachment of bracing cables.

The C.IV was powered by a single Mercedes D.III six-cylinder inline piston engine, capable of producing up to 160 hp, that was housed within the aircraft&#x27;s bulbous nose. A sizable radiator was located on the direct underside of the aircraft&#x27;s main spar to cool the engine, while a large exhaust manifold was set above the top wing. The wings were supported by a pair of steel tube spars; the wooden ribs were interspaced with false ribs while the aileron wires ran inside a steel tube in the lower wing mounted after aft of front spar, providing additional structural strength. The trailing edge of the wing was slightly scalloped, as per typical German aircraft conventions of the era, and had a distinctive &#x27;bite&#x27; on production aircraft. Both the tail surfaces and ailerons were unbalanced and featured metal construction; a somewhat unique feature was the adjustable tail plane incidence.

In order to achieve a sufficient rate of production, multiple companies were engaged in the programme. The Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker were ordered to produce the C.IV under license, despite the alleged dissatisfaction of the company&#x27;s founder, Anthony Fokker. By June 197, around 170 aircraft were believed to have been in service across all battlefronts of the Central Powers; as late as August 1918, at least 40 C.IVs remained in an operational condition.

The C.IV was easily the most successful of AEG&#x27;s First World War-era B- and C-type reconnaissance aircraft, roughly 687 were reportedly built while the model remained in service right up to the end of the conflict. Various initiatives were undertaken towards improving the aircraft. One variant that was developed in 1917, the &quot;C.IV.N&quot;, was designed specifically as a prototype night bomber; it was outfitted with the Benz Bz.III engine used in other C-types along with a lengthened wingspan. Another variant, the &quot;C.IVa&quot;, was powered by a 130 kW (180 hp) Argus As III engine.

A large number of 91 C.IVs were captured by the Polish in 1919, the majority of them having been in Poznań during the Greater Poland Uprising. Most of these aircraft were retained and entered service with the newly emerged Polish Air Force. It became one of the service&#x27;s standard aircraft, and was frequently used to conduct reconnaissance, bombing, and strafing actions during Polish-Soviet War of 1919–1920. Shortly after the conflict&#x27;s end, the majority of Polish C.IVs were permanently withdrawn.

<doc id="894557" wikidata="Q5510489" url="?curid=894557" title="Futatsui, Akita">
<text>was a town located in Yamamoto District, Akita Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 11,421 and a population density of 62.96 persons per km2. The total area was 181.40 km2.

While Futatsui is the name of the settlement at the center of town, Futatsui actually consists of a collection of several villages at its outskirts. To the north is Taneume, to the east Tenjin, to the south is Nibuna and Tashiro, and to the west is Kirishi and Tomine.

Futatsui is famous for having the tallest virgin cedar tree in Japan, as well as a hill, Kimimachi-zaka—named by the Emperor when he came to visit the town. Kimimachi-zaka is especially well known for its autumn leaves, and the park that covers the hill is extensive and well maintained.

The town has several small Shinto shrines, one of which, at the center of town, holds the heaviest portable shrine in the area. Locals carry this shrine across town on Children&#x27;s Day (May 5) as a climax to Golden Week.

To the east, near the Route 7 overpass is the town&#x27;s Buddhist temple. The temple was transported on top of a hill to make way for Route 7, as was the graveyard.

Among its less savory attractions is the so-dubbed &#x27;Million Dollar Toilet,&#x27; an unofficial tribute to pork barrel spending just off of Route 7 on the east side town.

On the eastern border of Futatsui is Yakushi, a hill that sports a large Sugichi-kun in summer and autumn, and operates as a small ski area in winter. It is one of few ski areas in northern Akita that offers night skiing.

On March 21, 2006, Futatsui was merged into the expanded city of Noshiro.

<doc id="894562" wikidata="Q1206039" url="?curid=894562" title="Fujisato, Akita">
<text>is a town located in Akita, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 2,890 in 1315 households, and a population density of 10 persons per km2. The total area of the town is .

==Geography==
Fujisato is located at the confluence of the Kasuge River and the Fujikoto River in the Yoneshiro River system in far northwestern of Akita Prefecture. It is bordered by the World Heritage Site Shirakami Mountains to the south, and by Aomori Prefecture to the north. The town itself is nestled in a small valley at the base of the Shirakami Mountains. The hillsides are brimming with lush green in the summer, amazing orange in the autumn, and covered in white snow during the winter. Due to its location in the middle of the mountains, the temperature in Fujisato can get remarkably cold at night, with snowfall tending to be somewhat greater than that in neighboring municipalities.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Akita Prefecture
*Happō
*Kitaakita
*Noshiro
*Ōdate
Aomori Prefecture
*Ajigasawa
*Nishimeya

===Climate===
Fujisato has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is heaviest from August to October. The average annual temperature in Fujisato is 10.3 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1471 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 24.3 °C, and lowest in January, at around -2.1 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Fujisato peaked around the year 1950 and has been in steady decline since then.

==History==
The area of present-day Fujisato was part of ancient Dewa Province, dominated by the Satake clan during the Edo period, who ruled Kubota Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. The area was organized into villages within Yamamoto District, Akita with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1884. The village of Fujisato was established on March 31, 1955 from the merger of the villages of Fujigoto and Kasuge, both from Yamamoto District. It was raised to town status on November 1, 1963.

==Government==
Fujisato has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of ten members. Fujisato, together with the city of Noshiro and the other municipalities of Yamamoto District contributes four members to the Akita Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Akita 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The economy of Fujisato is based on agriculture and forestry. Economic development has been hampered by the town&#x27;s isolation: there are no railway lines, national roads, or major local roads to any neighboring municipality.

==Education==
Fujisato has one public elementary school and one public middle school operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school.

==Transportation==
Fujisato has no railways and is not served by the Japanese national highway system. Access is primarily through Akita Prefectural Road 200 or 317.
