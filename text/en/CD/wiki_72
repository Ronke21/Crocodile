<text>Advanced Intelligent Tape (AIT) is a discontinued high-speed, high-capacity magnetic tape data storage format developed and controlled by Sony. It was introduced in 1996 to utilise Advanced Metal Evaporated (AME) technology. It competed mainly against the DLT, LTO, DAT/DDS, and VXA formats. AIT uses 8mm tape in a cassette similar to Video8. Super AIT (SAIT) is a higher capacity variant using wider half inch (1/2&quot;) tape in a larger, single-spool cartridge. Both AIT and SAIT use the helical scan method of reading and writing to the tape.

== Form factors ==

AIT technology was available in two form factors.

* AIT – 8 mm, dual reel cartridge, similar to Sony&#x27;s 8 mm videotape products and Exabyte&#x27;s 8 mm data tape products.
* SAIT – 1/2&quot;, single reel cartridge, similar to DLT and LTO.

In March 2010, Sony announced the discontinuation of the AIT product line, and renewed collaboration with Hewlett-Packard on further development of the DDS tape format,

== Compatibility ==
One of the most compelling features of the AIT format is that many generations are both backwards and forwards compatible. This allows multiple generations of tape drives to both read and write to multiple generations of tape media.

== AIT generations ==
=== AIT-1 ===
* Original specification&#x27;s data capacity up to 25 GB native and up to 65 GB compressed, with a data transfer speed of 3 MB/s.
* Extended length tape, introduced in 1999 gave additional capacity, 35 GB.
* Speed increased to 4 MB/s in 2001.
* Turbo variant, introduced in 2004, is 50% faster (6 MB/s) and holds 40 GB.
* A budget version, AIT-E Turbo, was also introduced in 2004 to compete with DDS.
* SATA version of AIT-1 Turbo available in 2006.

=== AIT-2 ===
* Doubled capacity and transfer speed
* WORM technology introduced
* Turbo variant is 100% higher capacity, 100% faster (same speed as AIT-3)
* Turbo variant introduced R-MIC technology
* SATA version of AIT-2 Turbo available in 2006
* Higher capacity TAIT2-80N (Turbo) 80Gb native.

=== AIT-3 ===
* Doubled capacity and transfer speed
* Ex variant is 50% higher capacity, 50% faster

=== AIT-4 ===
* Doubled capacity and transfer speed
* New tape formulation, AME-2
* Not compatible with previous generations

=== AIT-5 ===
* Available September 27, 2006
* Announced July 2006, hardware and media expected &quot;in the fall.&quot;
* Doubled capacity (via halved tracked pitch to 2.2 μm), maintained transfer speed.
* Backwards compatible with AIT-3, AIT-3Ex, AIT-4
* New tape formulation, AME-3, which uses finer Cobalt particles resulting in SNR gain of 1 dB compared with AIT-4/AME-2.
* A switch to GMR head technology (Flux Guide GMR).

== SAIT generations ==

=== SAIT-1 ===
* Highest capacity tape cartridge from 2003 to 2006. Displaced by DLT-S4 (800 GB).
The AIT format was developed and is controlled by Sony.

=== SAIT-2 ===
Released in 2006 by Sony, available only in libraries, 800 GB native and 45 MB/s sustained transfer rate.

== Notes ==
* Data Capacity and Speed figures above are for &quot;uncompressed&quot; data. Sony assumes a 2x or 2.6x compression factor in their marketing material.
* According to Sony, &quot;All future products are based on technology projections.&quot;

== Technical features ==
=== AME ===
Advanced Metal Evaporated is a different formulation of tape media.

=== MIC ===
Memory-in-Cassette
is a 16-64KB memory chip in the cartridge that keeps relevant information about the data on the tape to allow quicker access. The drive did not have to read the whole tape until it came across the file required like a file index.

=== R-MIC ===
Remote - Memory in Cassette
Like MIC except it does not require physical contact.

=== WORM ===
Write Once Read Many functionality, useful for archive keeping.

<text>Lajos Bárdos (1 October 1899 – 18 November 1986) was a composer, conductor, music theorist, and professor of music at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, in Budapest, Hungary, where he had previously studied under Albert Siklós and Zoltán Kodály. His younger brother, György Deák-Bárdos, was also a composer.

Together with Kodály, Bárdos laid the foundations of 20th-century Hungarian choral music. From 1928 to 1967 he was a professor at the Academy, where he reformed the syllabus––emphasizing the training of choral conductors, the teaching of church music history, and instruction in music theory and prosody. In 1931, along with György Kerényi and Gyula Kertész, he founded the publishing company Magyar Kórus (Hungarian Chorus), publishing 2,000 works of old masters and modern composers over the next 20 years, before being shut down by the communist regime in 1950. As the most active disseminator of sacred music in Hungary, Bárdos was targeted at the time with threatening criticism. (For example, one writer in the new journal Éneklö Nép (Singing People) proclaimed, &quot;We must take care to eradicate men such as Lajos Bárdos as soon as possible!&quot;) The irony is that the rich supply of music provided by Magyar Kórus had allowed schools across Hungary to organize concerts based on those works. That same group of works also served as the basis for the &quot;Singing Youth&quot; movement, which Bárdos founded in 1934, and which encouraged young people across Hungary to join choral groups and learn the basics of music. And the impetus to promote choral music in the first place came largely from Kodály&#x27;s observation––made when both he and Bárdos were young musicians––that whereas only a few of the elite had the privilege of having an education in instrumental music, on the other hand, &quot;everybody has a voice&quot;.

Through his work as a conductor Bárdos raised the standards of Hungarian choral singing to the highest international level within decades. He directed several choirs and encouraged the development of choral activity in remote areas of the country. His repertory was pioneering: he included choral music from before Palestrina––especially that of Josquin––while also promoting new music (for instance, he directed the Palestrina Choir&#x27;s performance of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot; in 1932, to great success––and praises from Stravinsky). He also promoted new music in other ways. For example, in 1947 he invited Olivier Messiaen to Budapest, where he both lectured and performed for two weeks.

Bárdos&#x27; own compositions draw on Renaissance polyphony and Hungarian folk music, following in the tradition of Bartók and Kodály. In all, he composed some 800 pieces––including folk song arrangements, choral masses, motets, secular pieces based on poems, theatrical accompaniments, songs, and instrumental music.

Bárdos&#x27; work as a musicologist included major studies of Gregorian melody, modal and Romantic harmony, and the analysis of works by Liszt, Bartók, and Kodály. Well known papers include &quot;The Modal Harmony in Liszt&#x27;s Work&quot;, and &quot;Heptatonia Secunda&quot; (which is considered by some to be the best study of Kodály in all of musical literature). When the first essay of the volume &quot;Folk Rhythm in Bartók&#x27;s Music&quot; was published, it inspired a younger generation to research Bartók further.

His lectures at the Academy were famous for their clarity and liveliness, and he had a full house at all times, regardless of the subject matter. His pupils at the Academy included György Kurtág, who decades later dedicated two compositions to him (Op. 11, song #2, and Op. 12). György Ligeti took the unusual step of regularly attending Bárdos&#x27; lectures while they were both teaching at the Academy. He later credited Bárdos&#x27; lectures with having an influence on his own early compositions.

Between the wars (for almost 20 years, until 1944) Bárdos composed the music for several large-scale &quot;movement dramas&quot; produced by the pioneering Hungarian modern dancer Valéria Dienes (herself a former student––and only authorized translator into Hungarian––of the French philosopher Henri Bergson, as well as being the founder of the first school of eurhythmics in Hungary).

The teaching methods that Bárdos developed contributed to what has since come to be known as the Kodály Method of musical training.

&quot;Lajos Bárdos Music Week&quot; has been an annual festival in Hungary since 1977.

<text>Douglas Andrew Mientkiewicz ( ; born June 19, 1974) is an American former professional baseball player and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman from 1998 to 2009, most prominently as a member of the Minnesota Twins where he was a Gold Glove Award winner. He was also a member of the 2004 World Series winning Boston Red Sox team. He is one of six players to win both an Olympic gold medal and a World Series championship.

After his playing career, Mientkiewicz briefly worked as a television sports analyst before serving as a minor league manager in the Los Angeles Dodgers and Detroit Tigers organizations.

==Amateur career==
Mientkiewicz attended Westminster Christian School in Palmetto Bay, Florida, where he was a teammate of Alex Rodriguez and Dan Perkins. Mientkiewicz had a batting cage in his backyard which his high school teammates would use as they pleased. He and Rodriguez were on the WCS basketball team. Mientkiewicz also was a tight end on the football team while Rodriguez was a quarterback. 

After Mientkiewicz graduated from high school, the Toronto Blue Jay selected him in the 12th round of the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, but he chose instead to attend Florida State University in Tallahassee to play college baseball for the Florida State Seminoles. In his third season with the Seminoles, he led the team with a .371 batting average, 19 home runs, and 80 runs batted in (RBIs). Florida State won their first Atlantic Coast Conference Championship, and Mientkiewicz was named Atlantic Coast Conference Atlantic I Regional Most Valuable Player. After the season, he was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the fifth round of the 1995 Major League Baseball Draft. He was elected to the Florida State University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005.

==Minor league career==
In 1998, he batted .323, with a .432 on-base percentage and .508 slugging percentage in 509 at-bats for the New Britain Rock Cats to earn Eastern League (Double-A) All-Star honors, and a September call-up to the Twins. He batted .200 with two runs batted in in 25 at-bats for the Twins.

Mientkiewicz earned a roster spot with the Twins the following spring without having playing in Triple-A, and batted .229 with two home runs and 32 runs batted in sharing playing time with Ron Coomer at first base in 1999. After a full season in the majors, Mientkiewicz spent the 2000 season with the Twins&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, the Salt Lake Buzz. He was the Triple-A All-Star first baseman, and Pacific Coast League All-Star designated hitter. He batted .334, with a .446 on-base percentage and a .524 slugging percentage in 485 at-bats for Salt Lake, while both scoring and driving in 96 runs.

After the Triple-A season, Mientkiewicz joined the U.S. Olympic team at the 2000 games in Sydney. Mientkiewicz hit the go-ahead grand slam against South Korea in the semi-finals to help the U.S. capture its first-ever gold medal in baseball. After having doubts about his future as a ball player, he credits this experience for saving his career. After the Olympics, he played three games with the Twins, collecting six hits in fourteen at-bats.

In LVBP he played one season with Navegantes del Magallanes in the 1999-2000 season batting for .268 with 2 homers and 10 RBI.

==Major league career==

===Minnesota Twins===
In 2001, Mientkiewicz was awarded the starting first base job for the Twins, and responded by batting .306 with fifteen home runs and 74 runs batted in (all career highs) while earning the American League Gold Glove award for top defensive first baseman. His numbers dipped in 2002; however, he reached the post-season for the first time in his career, and hit two home runs in the 2002 American League Division Series against the Oakland Athletics. The Twins battled the Chicago White Sox and Kansas City Royals for the division crown all season long in 2003.

Mientkiewicz drew the ire of the Chicago White Sox and their fans by suggesting that the All-Star Game, scheduled to be played at U.S. Cellular Field on July 15, should be moved to a different venue after a fan attacked umpire Laz Diaz during an April 15 game between the White Sox and Royals. Chicago White Sox General Manager Kenny Williams shot back that Mientkiewicz should not worry about the game&#x27;s location because he would not be there. 

After a mid-September three-game sweep over the White Sox at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome that gave the Twins a game lead in the American League Central, Mientkiewicz again got himself in the crosshairs by commenting in a postgame television interview, &quot;They&#x27;re done,&quot; about his Central Division rivals. The Twins won the division by four games over the Chicago White Sox, but were eliminated by the New York Yankees in the 2003 American League Division Series.

===Boston Red Sox===
As the trade deadline approached, the 2004 Boston Red Sox found themselves games in back of the New York Yankees in the American League East, and one game in back of the Texas Rangers in the wild card race. With infield defense proving to be their Achilles&#x27; heel, they made a four-team trade deadline deal on July 31 that landed Mientkiewicz and Montreal Expos shortstop Orlando Cabrera with the Boston Red Sox, and sent Justin Jones to the Twins. The Red Sox also sent Nomar Garciaparra and Matt Murton to the Chicago Cubs, and the Cubs sent Francis Beltrán, Alex Gonzalez and Brendan Harris to the Expos as part of this trade. Coincidentally, the Twins were playing a home series against the Red Sox at the time. On July 30, 2004, Mientkiewicz went 2-4, scoring one run as a member of the Minnesota Twins. The next day, July 31, 2004, Mientkiewicz was in the visiting dugout as a member of the Boston Red Sox, and started at first base and hit sixth in the lineup.

Mientkiewicz and Cabrera proved valuable additions to their new franchise as the Red Sox surged to within three games of the Yankees by the end of the season, and took the A.L. wild card by seven games over the Oakland A&#x27;s. On August 16, Mientkiewicz made an emergency start at second base, a position he had only ever played four times in the minor leagues, and never in the majors.

Mientkiewicz went 4-for-10 in the post-season. He did not appear in any of the first three games of the 2004 American League Championship Series that the Red Sox lost to the New York Yankees; however, he appeared in all of the final four that they won in their come-from-behind series win. In the final game of the 2004 World Series, Mientkiewicz was playing first when St. Louis Cardinals shortstop Édgar Rentería grounded back to pitcher Keith Foulke. When he threw the ball to first to complete Boston&#x27;s four-game sweep of the World Series, Mientkiewicz kept the ball, as dictated by baseball tradition. As Boston had not won a World Series in 86 years, the ball symbolized the end of the so-called &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot;, and was of considerable interest to memorabilia collectors.

Controversy resulted when Mientkiewicz joked to a reporter that he would sell the ball. The Red Sox then asked for the ball&#x27;s return so it could be displayed in a museum, and Mientkiewicz refused to give it back. He talked directly with team president Larry Lucchino and principal owner John Henry about the ball. Years later, Mientkiewicz said he suggested that a portion of the admissions should go to charity, but Lucchino refused. Shortly after his January 27 trade to the New York Mets, Mientkiewicz and the Red Sox reached an agreement that the Red Sox would hold the ball temporarily and could display it across New England, along with the World Series trophy. The agreement called for Mientkiewicz to get the ball back at the end of 2005 unless the ultimate issue of ownership has been otherwise resolved. In the controversy that followed, Mientkiewicz received death threats against himself and his wife.

On November 30, 2005, lawyers for the Red Sox filed suit in Suffolk Superior Court asking the court to place the ball in a secure location until ownership was decided. The club&#x27;s legal team said that Mientkiewicz had gained possession of the ball only because he was a Red Sox employee and that the ball remained the team&#x27;s property. The organization soon after dropped the case in order to grieve the issue in arbitration. On April 23, 2006, it was announced that he had reached an agreement with the Red Sox, and the ball would go to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

===New York Mets===
In January 2005, Mientkiewicz was traded to the Mets for minor league first baseman Ian Bladergroen and cash. He began the 2005 season as the Mets&#x27; everyday first baseman, but lost his starting job to prospect Mike Jacobs by the end of the season after missing time due to multiple injuries.

===Kansas City Royals===
Mientkiewicz signed a one-year deal with the Kansas City Royals. During the following season with the Kansas City Royals, he compiled a .283 batting average and 43 runs batted in, his most since playing with Minnesota. He was not offered a contract by the Royals, and on January 5, 2007, he signed a one-year deal with the New York Yankees.

===New York Yankees===
On June 2, 2007, Mientkiewicz collided with Mike Lowell of the Boston Red Sox while trying to field a throw from shortstop Derek Jeter. He suffered a mild concussion and a fractured scaphoid bone in his right wrist and was placed on the disabled list. Mientkiewicz missed three months of the season, and did not return until September 4. He made his first start since the injury on September 16, and went two-for-three in the Yankees&#x27; 4–3 victory over the Red Sox. Mientkiewicz was injured in an on-field incident when a cameraman collided with him before Game 1 of the ALDS.

For the season, he batted .277 with five home runs and 24 runs batted in. He made the post-season for the fourth time in his career, and was hitless in six at-bats.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===

On February 11, 2008, Mientkiewicz signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Pittsburgh Pirates. In his only season in Pittsburgh, he batted .277 with two home runs and 30 runs batted in, mostly backing up Adam LaRoche at first base. He also made 33 appearances at third base and ten in right field. He briefly left the team during the season while his wife, Jodi, had heart surgery.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On February 26, 2009, Mientkiewicz signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He made the Major League roster as a pinch hitter and appeared in seven games for the Dodgers in April before dislocating his shoulder sliding into second base and being placed on the 60-day disabled list. After a brief rehab stint with the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes from July 28 to August 17, Mientkiewicz rejoined the Dodgers in September, seeing sporadic action as a pinch hitter down the stretch. He had six hits in eighteen at-bats, only one of which was for extra bases, and had three runs batted in.

Mientkiewicz signed a minor league contract with the Dodgers for the 2010 season, and came to camp to compete for the left-handed pinch hitter role. He was offered a coaching position with the team when he did not make the club out of spring training, but opted instead to keep playing and become a free agent.

===Florida Marlins===
On May 5, 2010, he signed a minor league contract with the Florida Marlins, but was released just nine days later after playing four games for the Marlins&#x27; Triple A affiliate, the New Orleans Zephyrs. Mientkiewicz&#x27;s deal included a one-day out clause for May 16, and the Marlins chose to cut him loose before he could exercise it.

Following his release, Mientkiewicz chose to retire from baseball.

==Broadcasting==
After retirement, Mientkiewicz worked as an analyst for the 2010 MLB post-season for CBSSports.com. He was hired in 2020 as an on-air personality for ESPN&#x27;s ACC Network alongside Gaby Sanchez, Javier Lopez, and Adam Greenberg.

Mientkiewicz has been a frequent and outspoken guest on former teammate A.J. Pierzynski&#x27;s podcast Foul Territory. During his appearances, he has spoken out against the Red Sox organization&#x27;s handling of the final out ball from the 2004 World Series. Mientkiewicz also voiced his displeasure with his former high school teammate Alex Rodriguez, saying he will &quot;die a lonely man.&quot; Soon afterwards, he also criticized the Twins organization for the way it handled its top prospect Byron Buxton during his time as a manager in the minors.

==Coaching/managing==
Mientkiewicz made his coaching debut in 2012 in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization as the hitting coach of the rookie league Ogden Raptors in the Pioneer League. After 2012, he was hired by the Minnesota Twins organization as the manager of the high-Class A Fort Myers Miracle, the team he played for in 1995–96 to start his baseball career. He got the Miracle off to a fast start in 2013 as the team tied a franchise record by winning their first 14 games of the season (equaling the mark set in 1995 and tied in 2007) and ended April with a Minor League best 21 wins (21-4).

In October 2014, Mientkiewicz was a finalist to become the manager of the Minnesota Twins. Paul Molitor was selected as Twins manager, and Mientkiewicz managed the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts in 2015–16 before returning to Fort Myers for a second term as the Miracle&#x27;s skipper. In 2017, Mientkiewicz won Coach of the Year honors and made the Florida State League All-Star roster. He was fired after the 2017 season.

On November 16, 2017, Mientkiewicz was named the manager of the Toledo Mud Hens, the Detroit Tigers&#x27; Triple-A affiliate. On October 31, 2019, he was fired by the Mud Hens.

Mientkiewicz has served as a team manager for MLB&#x27;s and USA Baseball&#x27;s Prospect Development Pipeline League since 2022.

<text>Linear Tape-Open (LTO), also known as the LTO Ultrium format, is a magnetic tape data storage technology used for backup, data archiving, and data transfer. It was originally developed in the late 1990s as an open standards alternative to the proprietary magnetic tape formats available at the time. Upon introduction, LTO rapidly defined the &quot;super tape&quot; market segment and has consistently been the best-selling super tape format. The latest generation as of 2021, LTO-9, can hold in one cartridge.

Cartridges contain hundreds of meters of half-inch (12.65 mm) wide tape media wound onto a single reel. Mechanisms (a.k.a. tape drives, streamers) extract the tape from the cartridge and spool it up on a second reel in the mechanism, reading or writing data as the tape moves between reels. Robotic libraries exist that can hold hundreds or thousands of LTO cartridges and dozens of mechanisms.

The original version of LTO Ultrium, called LTO-1, was released in 2000 and stored of data in a cartridge; throughout newer generations, the capacity has increased while maintaining the same physical size. They feature built-in encryption for safer storing and transporting of data, and the partition feature enables usage of LTFS, generally having higher capacity, better long-term stability, and lower unit cost than other data storage formats. There are also write once read many LTO cartridges, useful to protect against accidental or malicious deletion.

== Historical context ==
Half-inch (12.65 mm) wide magnetic tape has been used for data storage since the 1950s, starting with the open reel formats IBM 7-track and later IBM 9-track.

In the mid-1980s, smaller, enclosed, single-reel cartridge formats were developed by IBM and DEC. Although the physical tape was nominally the same width in these new formats and the preceding open-reel formats, the technologies and intended markets were significantly different and there was no compatibility between them. The IBM 3480 tape format was designed to meet the demanding requirements of its mainframe products. DEC&#x27;s CompacTape was targeted at a broader market, including minicomputers and smaller systems.
Later on, it was renamed Digital Linear Tape (DLT) and eventually sold to Quantum Corporation.

In the late 1980s, Exabyte&#x27;s Data8 format, derived from Sony&#x27;s dual-reel cartridge 8 mm video format, saw some popularity, especially with UNIX systems. Sony followed this success with their own now-discontinued 8 mm data format, Advanced Intelligent Tape (AIT).

By the late 1990s, Quantum&#x27;s DLT and Sony&#x27;s AIT were the leading options for high-capacity tape storage for PC servers and UNIX systems. These technologies were tightly controlled by their owners and consequently, there was little to no competition between vendors and the prices were relatively high.

=== Birth of LTO ===
Seeing an opportunity, IBM, HP and Seagate formed the LTO Consortium, which introduced a more open format focusing on the same mid-range market segment. Much of the technology is an extension of the work done by IBM at its Tucson lab during the previous 20 years.

In 2000, and around the time of the release of LTO-1, Seagate&#x27;s magnetic tape division was spun off as Seagate Removable Storage Solutions, later renamed Certance, which was subsequently acquired by Quantum.

==== Unrealized variations ====
Initial plans called for two distinct LTO formats:
* Ultrium - with half-inch tape on a single reel, optimized for high capacity, and
* Accelis - with 8 mm tape on dual reels, optimized for fast access.

Despite the initial plans, only Ultrium was ever produced. So, in common usage, LTO refers to just the Ultrium form factor.

Another proposed variation was to have different length tapes. The first generation of Ultrium was going to be available with four types of cartridges, holding 10 GB, 30 GB, 50 GB, and 100 GB. However, only the full length 100 GB tapes were ever produced.

== Generations ==
As of 2020, nine generations of LTO Ultrium technology have been made available and five more are planned. Between generations, there are strict compatibility rules that describe how and which drives and cartridges can be used together.

While data capacity and speed figures vary with &quot;uncompressed or compressed&quot; data, most manufacturers list compressed capacities and speeds on their marketing material. Capacities are often stated on tapes assuming that data will be compressed at a fixed ratio, commonly 2:1. See Compression below for algorithm descriptions and the table above for LTO&#x27;s advertised compression ratios.

The units for data capacity and data transfer rates generally follow the &quot;decimal&quot; SI prefix convention (e.g. mega = 106), not the binary interpretation of a decimal prefix (e.g. mega = 220).

Minimum and maximum reading and writing speeds are drive-dependent.

Drives usually support variable-speed operation to dynamically match the data rate flow. This nearly eliminates tape backhitching or &quot;shoe-shining&quot;, maximizing overall throughput and device/tape life.

The LTO Consortium provide a roadmap of future generations, which state that LTO-10 is expected to have 36 TB of storage and LTO-14 potentially 576 TB.

=== Compatibility ===

In contrast to other tape technologies, an Ultrium cartridge is rigidly defined by a particular generation of LTO technology and cannot be used in any other way (with the exception of LTO-M8, see below). While Ultrium drives are also defined by a particular generation, they are required to have some level of compatibility with older generations of cartridges. The rules for compatibility between generations of drives and cartridges are as follows:

* Up to and including LTO-7, an Ultrium drive &quot;can read&quot; data from a cartridge in its own generation and the two prior generations. Later generations reduce read compatibility to only the previous generation: LTO-8 drives can read LTO-7 and LTO-8 tape, but not LTO-6 tape; LTO-9 drives can read and write from LTO-8 and LTO-9 tapes, but not LTO-7 ones. 
* An Ultrium drive &quot;can write&quot; data to a cartridge in its own generation and to a cartridge from the one prior generation &quot;in the prior generation&#x27;s format&quot;.
* Some LTO-8 drives may write previously unused LTO-7 tapes with an increased, uncompressed capacity of 9 TB (&quot;Type M (M8)&quot;). Only new, unused LTO-7 cartridges may be initialized as LTO-7 Type M. Once a cartridge is initialized as Type M it may not be changed back to a 6 TB LTO-7 cartridge. LTO-7 Type M cartridges are only initialized to Type M in an LTO-8 drive. LTO-7 drives are not capable of reading LTO-7 Type M cartridges.
* An Ultrium drive &quot;cannot make any use&quot; of a cartridge from a more recent generation. For example, an LTO-2 cartridge can never be used by an LTO-1 drive; and even though it can be used in an LTO-3 drive, it performs as if it were in an LTO-2 drive.

Within the compatibility rules stated above, drives and cartridges from different vendors are expected to be interchangeable. For example, a tape written on any one vendor&#x27;s drive should be fully readable on any other vendor&#x27;s drive that is compatible with that generation of LTO.

== Core technology ==
=== Tape specifications ===

=== Physical structure ===

LTO Ultrium tape is laid out with four wide data bands sandwiched between five narrow servo bands. The tape head assembly, that reads from and writes to the tape, straddles a single data band and the two adjacent servo bands. The tape head has 8, 16, or 32 data read/write head elements and 2 servo read elements. The set of 8, 16, or 32 tracks are read or written in a single, one-way, end-to-end pass that is called a &quot;wrap&quot;. The tape head shifts laterally to access the different wraps within each band and also to access the other bands.

Writing to a blank tape starts at band 0, wrap 0, a forward wrap that runs from the beginning of the tape (BOT) to the end of the tape (EOT) and includes a track that runs along one side of the data band. The next wrap written, band 0, wrap 1, is a reverse wrap (EOT to BOT) and includes a track along the other side of the band. Wraps continue in forward and reverse passes, with slight shifts toward the middle of the band on each pass. The tracks written on each pass &quot;partially overlap&quot; the tracks written on the previous wrap of the same direction, like roof shingles. The back and forth pattern, working from the edges into the middle, conceptually resembles a coiled serpent and is known as linear serpentine recording.

When the first data band is filled (they are filled in 3, 1, 0, 2 order across the tape), the head assembly is moved to the second data band and a new set of wraps is written in the same linear serpentine manner. The total number of tracks on the tape is (4 data bands) × (11 to 52 wraps per band) × (8, 16, or 32 tracks per wrap). For example, an LTO-2 tape has 16 wraps per band, and thus requires 64 passes to fill.

=== Logical structure ===

Since LTFS is an open standard, LTFS-formatted tapes are usable by a wide variety of computing systems.

The block structure of the tape is logical so interblock gaps, file marks, tape marks and so forth take only a few bytes each. In LTO-1 and LTO-2, this logical structure has CRC codes and compression added to create blocks of 403,884 bytes. Another chunk of 468 bytes of information (including statistics and information about the drive that wrote the data and when it was written) is then added to create a &quot;dataset&quot;. Finally error correction bytes are added to bring the total size of the dataset to 491,520 bytes (480 KiB) before it is written in a specific format across the eight heads. LTO-3 and LTO-4 use a similar format with 1,616,940-byte blocks.

The tape drives use a strong error correction algorithm that makes data recovery possible when lost data is within one track. Also, when data is written to the tape it is verified by reading it back using the read heads that are positioned just &quot;behind&quot; the write heads. This allows the drive to write a second copy of any data that fails the verify without the help of the host system.

=== Positioning times ===

While specifications vary between different drives, a typical LTO-7 drive will take about 15 seconds to load the tape and 20 seconds to unload the tape. These drives have an average rewind time of 60 seconds and an average access time (from beginning of tape) of about 56 seconds. Because of serpentine writing methods, rewinding often takes less time than the maximum. If a tape is written to full capacity, there is no rewind time, since the last pass is a reverse pass leaving the head at the beginning of the tape (number of tracks ÷ tracks written per pass is always an even number).

=== Durability ===

LTO tape is designed for 15 to 30 years of archival storage. If tapes are archived for longer than 6 months they have to be stored at a temperature between and between 20 – 50% RH.
Both drives and media should be kept free from airborne dust or other contaminants from packing and storage materials, paper dust, cardboard particles, printer toner dust etc.

Depending on the generation of LTO technology, a single LTO tape should be able to sustain approximately 200-364 full file passes. There is a large amount of lifespan variability in actual use. One full file pass is equal to writing enough data to fill an entire tape and takes between 44 and 208 end-to-end passes. Regularly writing only 50% capacity of the tape results in half as many end-to-end tape passes for each scheduled backup, and thereby doubles the tape lifespan. LTO uses an automatic verify-after-write technology to immediately check the data as it is being written, but some backup systems explicitly perform a completely separate tape reading operation to verify the tape was written correctly. This separate verify operation doubles the number of end-to-end passes for each scheduled backup, and reduces the tape life by half.

== Optional technology ==

The original release of LTO technology defined an optional data compression feature. Subsequent generations of LTO have introduced new technologies, including WORM, encryption, and partitioning features. These features are built into the drives and/or tapes and can be ignored or enabled. Compression and encryption can also be performed in software prior to the data being sent to the tape drive. However, the partitioning function can only be done in hardware, and the WORM feature requires special WORM tapes.

=== Compression ===
The original LTO specification describes a data compression method LTO-DC, also called Streaming Lossless Data Compression (SLDC). It is very similar to the algorithm ALDC which is a variation of LZS. LTO-1 through LTO-5 are advertised as achieving a &quot;2:1&quot; compression ratio, while LTO-6 and LTO-7, which apply a modified SLDC algorithm using a larger history buffer, are advertised as having a &quot;2.5:1&quot; ratio. This is inferior to slower algorithms such as gzip, but similar to lzop and the high speed algorithms built into other tape drives. The actually achievable ratio generally depends on the compressibility of the data, e.g. for precompressed data such as ZIP files, JPEG images, and MPEG video or audio the ratio will be close to or equal to 1:1.

=== WORM ===
New for LTO-3 was write once read many (WORM) capability. This is useful for legal record keeping, and for protection from accidental or intentional erasure, for example from ransomware, or simply human error. Standard LTO cartridges do include a write-protect switch in the bottom-left corner, although it is easily overridden by the user and doesn&#x27;t provide any protection from accidental deletion by, for example, misidentification of a cartridge. An LTO-3 or later drive will not erase or overwrite data on a WORM cartridge, but will read it. A WORM cartridge is identical to a normal tape cartridge of the same generation with the following exceptions: the cartridge memory identifies it to the drive as WORM, the servo tracks are slightly different to allow verification that data has not been modified, the bottom half of the cartridge shell is gray, and it may come with tamper-proof screws. WORM-capable drives immediately recognize WORM cartridges and include a unique WORM ID with every dataset written to the tape. There is nothing different about the tape medium in a WORM cartridge.

=== Encryption ===
The LTO-4 specification added a feature to allow LTO-4 drives to encrypt data before it is written to tape. All LTO-4 drives must be aware of encrypted tapes, but are not required to support the encryption process. All current LTO manufacturers support encryption natively enabled in the tape drives using Application Managed Encryption (AME). The algorithm used by LTO-4 is AES-GCM, which is an authenticated, symmetric block cipher. The same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data, and the algorithm can detect tampering with the data. Tape drives, tape libraries, and backup software can request and exchange encryption keys using either proprietary protocols, or an open standard like OASIS&#x27;s Key Management Interoperability Protocol.

=== Partitioning ===
The LTO-5 specification introduced the partitioning feature that allows a tape to be divided into two separately writable areas, known as partitions. LTO-6 extends the specification to allow 4 separate partitions. The Linear Tape File System (LTFS) is a self-describing tape format and file system made possible by the partition feature. File data and filesystem metadata are stored in separate partitions on the tape. The metadata, which uses a standard XML schema, is readable by any LTFS-aware system and can be modified separately from the data it describes. The Linear Tape File System Technical Work Group of the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) works on the development of the format for LTFS. Without LTFS, data is generally written to tape as a sequence of nameless &quot;files&quot;, or data blocks, separated by &quot;filemarks&quot;. Each file is typically an archive of data organized using some variation of tar format or proprietary container formats developed for and used by backup programs. In contrast, LTFS utilizes an XML-based index file to present the copied files as if organized into directories. This means LTFS-formatted tape media can be used similarly to other removable media (USB flash drive, external hard disk drive, and so on). While LTFS can make a tape appear to behave like a disk, it does not change the fundamentally sequential nature of tape. Files are always appended to the end of the tape. If a file is modified and overwritten or removed from the volume, the associated tape blocks used are not freed up: they are simply marked as unavailable, and the used volume capacity is not recovered. Data is deleted and capacity recovered only if the whole tape is reformatted. In spite of these disadvantages, there are several use cases where LTFS-formatted tape is superior to disk and other data storage technologies. While LTO seek times can range from 10 to 100 seconds, the streaming data transfer rate can match or exceed disk data transfer rates. Additionally, LTO cartridges are easily transportable and the latest generation can hold more data than other removable data storage formats. The ability to copy a large file or a large selection of files (up to 1.5 TB for LTO-5 or 2.5 TB for LTO-6) to an LTFS-formatted tape, allows easy exchange of data to a collaborator or saving of an archival copy.

== Cartridges ==


Throughout the history of the format, there have been six compliance-verified, licensed manufacturers of LTO technology media: EMTEC, Imation, Fujifilm, Maxell, TDK, and Sony. All other brands of media are (or were) manufactured by these companies under contract. Since its bankruptcy in 2003, EMTEC no longer manufactures LTO media products. Imation ended all magnetic tape production in 2011, but continued making cartridges using TDK tape for a while. In 2017 they withdrew from all data storage markets, renaming themselves Glassbridge Enterprises. TDK withdrew from the data tape business in 2014. Maxell produced cartridges up to and including generation 6 in 2012, but has since withdrawn from the market. Verbatim and Quantegy both licensed LTO technology, but never manufactured their own compliance-verified media.

, only Fujifilm and Sony continue to manufacture current LTO media.

In addition to the data cartridges, there are also Universal Cleaning Cartridges (UCC), which work with all drives.

=== Dimensions ===

All formats use the same cartridge dimensions, .

=== Colors ===
The colors of LTO Ultrium cartridge shells are mostly consistent, though not formally standardized; HP is the notable exception. Sometimes similar, rather than identical, colors are used by different manufacturers (slate-blue and blue-gray; green, teal, and blue-green; dark red and burgundy).

WORM (write once, read many) cartridges are two-tone: the top half of the shell is the normal color of that generation for that manufacturer, and the bottom half of the shell is a light gray.

=== Memory ===
Every LTO cartridge has a cartridge memory chip inside it. It is made up of 511, 255, or 128 blocks of memory, where each block is 32 bytes for a total of 16 KiB for LTO-6 to 8; 8 KiB for LTO-4 and 5; and 4 KiB on LTO-1 to 3 and cleaning cartridges. This memory can be read or written, one block at a time, via a non-contacting passive 13.56 MHz RF interface. This memory is used to identify tapes, to help drives discriminate between different generations of the technology, and to store tape-use information. Every LTO drive has a cartridge memory reader in it. The non-contact interface has a range of 20 mm. External readers are available, both built into tape libraries and PC based. One such reader, Veritape, connects by USB to a PC and integrates with analytical software to evaluate the quality of tapes. This device is also rebranded as the Spectra MLM Reader and the Maxell LTO Cartridge Memory Analyzer. Proxmark3 and other generic RFID readers are also able to read data.

=== Labels ===
The LTO cartridge label in tape library applications commonly uses the bar code symbology of USS-39. A description and definition is available from the Automatic Identification Manufacturers (AIM) specification Uniform Symbol Specification (USS-39) and the ANSI MH10.8M-1993 ANSI Barcode specification.

=== Leader pin ===
The tape inside an LTO cartridge is wound around a single reel. The end of the tape is attached to a perpendicular leader pin that is used by an LTO drive to reliably grasp the end of the tape and mount it in a take-up reel inside the drive. Older single-reel tape technologies, such as 9-track tape and DLT, used different means to load tape onto a take-up reel. When a cartridge is not in a drive, the pin is held in place at the opening of the cartridge with a small spring. A common reason for a cartridge failing to load into a drive is the misplacement of the leader pin as a result of the cartridge having been dropped. The plastic slot where the pin is normally held is deformed by the drop and the leader pin is no longer in the position that the drive expects it to be.

=== Erasing ===
The magnetic servo tracks on the tape are factory encoded. Using a bulk eraser, degaussing, or otherwise exposing the cartridge to a strong magnetic field, will erase the servo tracks along with the data tracks, rendering the cartridge unusable. Erasing the data tracks without destroying the servo tracks can be done with an LTO drive or with special equipment. The erasing head used in these erasers has four magnetic poles that match the width and the location of the data bands. The gaps between the poles correspond to the servo tracks, which are not erased. Tapes erased by this equipment can be recorded again.

=== Cleaning ===
Although keeping a tape drive clean is important, normal cleaning cartridges are abrasive and frequent use will shorten the drive&#x27;s lifespan. LTO drives have an internal tape head cleaning brush that is activated when a cartridge is inserted. When a more thorough cleaning is required the drive signals this on its display and/or via Tape Alert flags. Cleaning cartridge lifespan is usually from 15 to 50 cleanings. There are 2 basic methods of initiating a cleaning of a drive: robot cleaning and software cleaning. In addition to keeping the tape drive clean, it is also important to keep the media clean. Debris on the media can be deposited onto drive components that are in contact with the tape. This debris can result in increased media wear which generates more debris. Removing excessive debris from tape can reduce the number of data errors. Cleaning of the media requires special equipment. These cleaners are also used by Spectra Logic to clean new media that is marketed as &quot;CarbideClean&quot; media. HP LTO Gen.1 drives have a cleaning strategy that will prevent the drive from using the cleaning tape if it is not needed. In a change of strategy, HP LTO Gen 2, 3 and 4 drives will always clean when a Universal Cleaning Cartridge is inserted, whether the drive requires cleaning or not.

== Mechanisms ==
, compliance-verified licensed manufacturers of current LTO technology mechanisms are IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Quantum, although both Hewlett Packard and Quantum have stopped new development of drive mechanisms. The mechanisms, also known as tape drives or streamers, are available in Full-height and Half-height form factors.

=== Libraries ===
These drives are frequently packaged into external desktop enclosures or carriers that fit into a robotic tape library.

== Sales and market ==

In the course of its existence, LTO has succeeded in completely displacing all other low-end/mid-range tape technologies such as AIT, DLT, DAT/DDS, and VXA. And after the exit of Oracle StorageTek T10000 of the high-end market, only the IBM 3592 series and LTO are still under active development. LTO also competes against hard disk drives (HDDs), and its continuous improvement has prevented the predicted &quot;death of tape&quot;.

=== LTO Sales ===
The presence of five certified media manufacturers and four certified mechanism manufacturers for a while produced a competitive market for LTO products. However, , there are only two manufacturers developing media, Sony and Fuji, and only IBM is developing mechanisms.
The LTO organization publishes annual media shipments measured in both units and compressed capacity. Media unit shipments peaked in 2008, at about 28 million. However, the 152.9 Exabytes of total compressed storage capacity shipped in 2023 is the highest ever reported. 

Public information on tape drive sales is not readily available. Unit shipment peaked at about 800,000 units in 2008, but have declined since then to about 400,000 units in 2010, and to less than 250,000 by the end of 2018

=== Comparison to Disk Storage ===

For decades, tape storage has primarily been used only in a few special situations, such as with mainframes or for backup and archiving, so the declining cost of disk made it seem possible that disk would completely take over the remaining uses of tape. In spite of this, the continuing evolution of tape technology, and particularly LTO, has kept tape storage relevant.

Tape and disk storage have some important fundamental differences. Tape generally has lower marginal costs, is more portable, and has better long term stability. These attributes make tape very appealing for large primarily offline data sets. Disk generally has much lower initial costs, much better access times, and is better suited to normal everyday usage.

Costs get complicated when considering large storage systems. Besides the simple unit cost of the data storage media, there are costs related to the hardware that makes use of and manages the media. Large robotic tape libraries are capable of managing hundreds of petabytes of data. Since most tapes in a library sit passively in their storage slot, the system uses relatively little power per TB stored. By contrast, disks must be kept powered on, spinning, and attached to some sort of computer system. The cost and capacity of storage arrays and tape libraries varies widely.

As HDD prices have dropped, disk has become cheaper relative to tape drives and cartridges. For decades, the cost of a new LTO tape cartridge plus the tape drive required to make use of it, has been much greater than that of an equivalently sized HDD. However, tape cartridges typically have a substantially lower price per gigabyte than HDDs, so that at very large subsystem capacities, the total price of tape-based subsystems can be lower than HDD based subsystems, particularly when the higher operating costs of HDDs are included in any calculation.

Tape is also used as &quot;offline&quot; copy, which can be protection against ransomware that cipher or delete data (e.g. tape is pulled out of the tape library, blocked from writing after making copy or using WORM technology). In 2019, many businesses used tape for backup and archiving.

<text>Friederich Pius Philipp Furtwängler (April 21, 1869 – May 19, 1940) was a German number theorist.

==Biography==
Furtwängler wrote an 1896 doctoral dissertation at the University of Göttingen on cubic forms (&quot;Zur Theorie der in Linearfaktoren zerlegbaren ganzzahligen ternären kubischen Formen&quot;), under Felix Klein. Most of his academic life, from 1912 to 1938, was spent at the University of Vienna, where he taught for example Kurt Gödel, who later said that Furtwängler&#x27;s lectures on number theory were the best mathematical lectures that he ever heard; Gödel had originally intended to become a physicist but turned to mathematics partly as a result of Furtwängler&#x27;s lectures. From 1916, Furtwängler became increasingly paralysed and, without notes, lectured from a wheelchair while his assistant wrote equations on the blackboard.

Some of Furtwängler&#x27;s doctoral students were Wolfgang Gröbner, Nikolaus Hofreiter, Henry Mann, Otto Schreier, and Olga Taussky-Todd. Through these and others, he has over 3000 academic descendants.

He is now best known for his contribution to the principal ideal theorem in the form of his &quot;Beweis des Hauptidealsatzes für Klassenkörper algebraischer Zahlkörper&quot; (1929).

Philipp Furtwängler was a grandson of the organ builder Philipp Furtwängler (1800-1867) and a second cousin of the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler.

<doc id="895357" wikidata="Q1863555" url="?curid=895357" title="English words of Greek origin">
<text>The Greek language has contributed to the English lexicon in five main ways:
*vernacular borrowings, transmitted orally through Vulgar Latin directly into Old English, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &#x27;butter&#x27; (, from Latin &lt; ), or through French, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &#x27;ochre&#x27;;
*learned borrowings from classical Greek texts, often via Latin, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &#x27;physics&#x27; (&lt; Latin &lt; );
* a few borrowings transmitted through other languages, notably Arabic scientific and philosophical writing, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &#x27;alchemy&#x27; (&lt; );
* direct borrowings from Modern Greek, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &#x27;ouzo&#x27; ();
*neologisms (coinages) in post-classical Latin or modern languages using classical Greek roots, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &#x27;telephone&#x27; (&lt; + ) or a mixture of Greek and other roots, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &#x27;television&#x27; (&lt; Greek + English &quot;vision&quot; &lt; Latin ); these are often shared among the modern European languages, including Modern Greek.

Of these, the neologisms are by far the most numerous.

==Indirect and direct borrowings==

Since the living Greek and English languages were not in direct contact until modern times, borrowings were necessarily indirect, coming either through Latin (through texts or through French and other vernaculars), or from Ancient Greek texts, not the living spoken language.
===Vernacular borrowings===

====Romance languages====

Some Greek words were borrowed into Latin and its descendants, the Romance languages. English often received these words from French. Some have remained very close to the Greek original, &quot;e.g.,&quot; &quot;lamp&quot; (Latin ; Greek ). In others, the phonetic and orthographic form has changed considerably. For instance, &quot;place&quot; was borrowed both by Old English and by French from Latin , itself borrowed from , &#x27;broad (street)&#x27;; the Italian and Spanish have the same origin, and have been borrowed into English in parallel. 

The word &quot;olive&quot; comes through the Romance from the Latin , which in turn comes from the archaic Greek &quot;elaíwā&quot; (). A later Greek word, &quot;boútȳron&quot; (), became Latin and eventually English &quot;butter&quot;. A large group of early borrowings, again transmitted first through Latin, then through various vernaculars, comes from Christian vocabulary:

* &quot;chair&quot; « (&quot;cf.&quot; &#x27;cathedra&#x27;)
* &quot;bishop&quot; « &quot;epískopos&quot; ( &#x27;overseer&#x27;)
* &quot;priest&quot; « &quot;presbýteros&quot; ( &#x27;elder&#x27;)
In some cases, the orthography of these words was later changed to reflect the Greek—and Latin—spelling: &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;quire&quot; was respelled &quot;choir&quot; in the 17th century. Sometimes this was done incorrectly: &quot;ache&quot; is from a Germanic root; the spelling &quot;ache&quot; reflects Samuel Johnson&#x27;s incorrect etymology from .

====Other====

Exceptionally, &quot;church&quot; came into Old English as &quot;cirice&quot;, &quot;circe&quot; via a West Germanic language. The Greek form was probably &quot;kȳriakḗ&quot; [&quot;oikía&quot;] ( &#x27;lord&#x27;s [house]&#x27;). In contrast, the Romance languages generally used the Latin words (French &quot;église&quot;; Italian &quot;chiesa;&quot; Spanish &quot;iglesia&quot;) or (Romanian &quot;biserica&quot;), both borrowed from Greek.

===Learned borrowings===

Many more words were borrowed by scholars writing in Medieval and Renaissance Latin. Some words were borrowed in essentially their original meaning, often transmitted through Classical Latin: &quot;topic&quot;, &quot;type&quot;, &quot;physics&quot;, &quot;iambic&quot;, &quot;eta&quot;, &quot;necromancy&quot;, &quot;cosmopolite&quot;. A few result from scribal errors: &quot;encyclopedia&quot; &lt; &#x27;the circle of learning&#x27; (not a compound in Greek); &quot;acne&quot; &lt; (erroneous) &lt; &#x27;high point, acme&#x27;. Some kept their Latin form, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;podium&quot; &lt; .

Others were borrowed unchanged as technical terms, but with specific, novel meanings: 

* &quot;telescope&quot; &lt; &#x27;far-seeing&#x27;, refers to an optical instrument for seeing far away rather than a person who can see far into the distance; 
* &quot;phlogiston&quot; &lt; &#x27;burnt thing&#x27;, is a supposed fire-making potential rather than something which has been burned, or can be burned; and
* &quot;bacterium&quot; &lt; &#x27;stick (diminutive)&#x27;, is a kind of microorganism rather than a small stick or staff. 

===Usage in neologisms===
But by far the largest Greek contribution to English vocabulary is the huge number of scientific, medical, and technical neologisms that have been coined by compounding Greek roots and affixes to produce novel words which never existed in the Greek language:

* &quot;utopia&quot; (1516; &#x27;not&#x27; + &#x27;place&#x27;)
* &quot;zoology&quot; (1669; + )
* &quot;hydrodynamics&quot; (1738; + )
* &quot;photography&quot; (1834; + )
* &quot;oocyte&quot; (1895; + )
* &quot;helicobacter&quot; (1989; + )

So it is really the combining forms of Greek roots and affixes that are borrowed, not the words. Neologisms using these elements are coined in all the European languages, and spread to the others freely—including to Modern Greek, where they are considered to be reborrowings. Traditionally, these coinages were constructed using only Greek morphemes, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;metamathematics&quot;, but increasingly, Greek, Latin, and other morphemes are combined. These hybrid words were formerly considered to be &#x27;barbarisms&#x27;, such as:

* &quot;television&quot; ( + Latin );
* &quot;metalinguistic&quot; ( + Latin + + ); and
* &quot;garbology&quot; (English &quot;garbage&quot; + ). 

Some derivations are idiosyncratic, not following the usual Greek compounding patterns, for example: 
* &quot;hadron&quot; &lt; with the suffix &quot;-on&quot;, itself abstracted from Greek &quot;anion&quot; (); 
* &quot;henotheism&quot; &lt; &#x27;one&#x27; + &#x27;god&#x27;, though &quot;&quot; is not used as a prefix in Greek;
* &quot;taxonomy&quot; &lt; &#x27;order&#x27; + &quot;-nomy&quot; ( &#x27;study of&#x27;), where the &quot;more etymological form&quot; is &#x27;, as found in , &#x27;taxiarch&#x27;, and the neologism &quot;taxidermy&quot;. Modern Greek uses in its reborrowing.
* &quot;psychedelic&quot; &lt; &#x27;psyche&#x27; + &#x27;make manifest, reveal&#x27;; the regular formation would be &#x27; or &#x27;;
* &quot;telegram&quot;; the regular formation would have been &quot;&quot;;

* &quot;heuristic&quot;, regular formation &quot;&quot;;
* &quot;chrysalis&quot;, regular spelling &quot;&quot;;
* &quot;ptomaine&quot;, regular formation &quot;&quot;;
* &quot;kerosene&quot;, &quot;hydrant&quot;, &quot;symbiont&quot;.
Many combining forms have specific technical meanings in neologisms, not predictable from the Greek sense:
* &quot;-cyte&quot; or &quot;cyto-&quot; &lt; &#x27;container&#x27;, means biological cells, not arbitrary containers.
* &quot;-oma&quot; &lt; , a generic morpheme forming deverbal nouns, such as &quot;diploma&quot; (&#x27;a folded thing&#x27;) and &quot;glaucoma&quot; (&#x27;greyness&#x27;), comes to have the very narrow meaning of &#x27;tumor&#x27; or &#x27;swelling&#x27;, on the model of words like &quot;carcinoma&quot; &lt; . For example, &quot;melanoma&quot; does not come from &#x27;blackness&#x27;, but rather from the modern combining forms &quot;melano-&quot; (&#x27;dark&#x27; [in biology]) + &quot;-oma&quot; (&#x27;tumor&#x27;).
* &quot;-itis&quot; &lt; , a generic adjectival suffix; in medicine used to mean a disease characterized by inflammation: &quot;appendicitis&quot;, &quot;conjunctivitis&quot;, ..., and now facetiously generalized to mean &quot;feverish excitement&quot;.
* &quot;-osis&quot; &lt; , originally a state, condition, or process; in medicine, used for a disease.

And some borrowings are modified in fairly arbitrary ways:
* &quot;gas&quot; (&lt; chaos) is irregular both in formation and in spelling;
* &quot;hecto-, kilo-, myria-&quot;, etymologically &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;&quot;;
In standard chemical nomenclature, the numerical prefixes are &quot;only loosely based on the corresponding Greek words&quot;, &quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;octaconta-&quot; is used for 80 instead of the Greek &quot;ogdoeconta-&quot; &#x27;80&#x27;. There are also &quot;mixtures of Greek and Latin roots&quot;, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;nonaconta-&quot;, for 90, is a blend of the Latin &quot;nona-&quot; for 9 and the Greek found in words such as ἐνενήκοντα &quot;enenekonta&quot; &#x27;90&#x27;. The Greek form is, however, used in the names of polygons in mathematics, though the names of polyhedra are more idiosyncratic.

Many Greek affixes such as &quot;anti-&quot; and &quot;-ic&quot; have become productive in English, combining with arbitrary English words: &quot;antichoice&quot;, &quot;Fascistic&quot;.

Some words in English have been reanalyzed as a base plus suffix, leading to suffixes based on Greek words, but which are not suffixes in Greek (&quot;cf.&quot; libfix). Their meaning relates to the full word they were shortened from, not the Greek meaning:
* &quot;-athon&quot; or &quot;&quot; (from the portmanteau word &quot;walkathon&quot;, from &quot;walk&quot; + &quot;(mar)athon&quot;). 
* &quot;-ase&quot;, used in chemistry for enzymes, is abstracted from &quot;diastase&quot;, where -ασις is not a morpheme at all in Greek.
* &quot;-on&quot; for elementary particles, from &quot;electron&quot;: &quot;lepton&quot;, &quot;neutron&quot;, &quot;phonon&quot;, ...
* &quot;-nomics&quot; refers specifically to economics: &quot;Reaganomics&quot;.
&quot;Nostalgia&quot; was formed in German as a calque of &quot;Heimweh.&quot;

===Through other languages===

Some Greek words were borrowed through Arabic and then Romance. Many are learned: 
* &quot;alchemy&quot; (&quot;al-&quot; + or )
** &quot;chemist&quot; is a back-formation from &quot;alchemist&quot;
* &quot;elixir&quot; (&quot;al-&quot; + )
* &quot;alembic&quot; (&quot;al-&quot; + )

Others are popular: 
* &quot;bottarga&quot; ()
* &quot;tajine&quot; ()
* &quot;carat&quot; ()
* &quot;talisman&quot; ()
* possibly &quot;quintal&quot; ( &lt; Latin ). 

A few words took other routes:
* &quot;seine&quot; (a kind of fishing net) comes from a West Germanic form *&quot;sagīna&quot;, from Latin , from . 
* &quot;effendi&quot; comes from Turkish, borrowed from Medieval Greek (/afˈθendis/, &#x27;lord&#x27;).
* &quot;hora&quot; (the dance) comes from Romanian and Modern Hebrew, borrowed from &#x27;dance&#x27;.

===Vernacular and learned doublets===

Some Greek words have given rise to etymological doublets, being borrowed both through a later learned, direct route, and earlier through an organic, indirect route:
* &quot;adamant&quot;, &quot;diamond&quot;;
* &quot;amygdala&quot;, &quot;almond&quot;;
* &quot;antiphon&quot;, &quot;anthem&quot;;
* &quot;apothec(ary)&quot;, &quot;boutique&quot; via French, &quot;bodega&quot; via Spanish;
* &quot;asphodel&quot;, &quot;daffodil&quot;;
* &quot;authentic&quot;, &quot;effendi&quot; (αὐθέντης via Turkish);
* (probably itself a borrowing from Semitic) &quot;balsam&quot;, &quot;balm&quot;;
* &quot;basis&quot;, &quot;base&quot;, &quot;bass&quot; (voice);
* &quot;blasphemy&quot;, &quot;blame&quot;;
* &quot;butyr(ic)&quot;, &quot;butter&quot;;
* &quot;diabol(ic)&quot;, &quot;devil&quot;;
* &quot;drachma&quot;, &quot;dram&quot;, &quot;dirhem&quot; via Arabic;
* &quot;elaeo-&quot;, &quot;oil&quot;, &quot;olive&quot;, &quot;oleum&quot;, &quot;latke&quot; via Russian and Yiddish;
* &quot;eleemosynary&quot;, &quot;alms&quot;;
* &quot;episcop(al)&quot;, &quot;bishop&quot;;
* &quot;zeal&quot;, &quot;jealous&quot;;
* &quot;hemicrania&quot;, &quot;migraine&quot;;
* &quot;thesaurus&quot;, &quot;treasure&quot;;

* &quot;iota&quot;, &quot;jot&quot;;
* &quot;cathedra(l)&quot;, &quot;chair&quot;, &quot;chaise&quot;;
* &quot;cannabis&quot;, &quot;canvas&quot;;
* / &#x27;horn&#x27; &quot;keratin&quot;, &quot;carat&quot; via Arabic;
* &#x27;lap, womb, hollow, bay&#x27; &quot;colp(itis)&quot;, &quot;gulf&quot;;
* &quot;cybernetics&quot;, &quot;govern&quot;;
* &quot;papyrus&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;;
* &quot;parochial&quot;, &quot;parish&quot;;
* &quot;podium&quot;, &quot;pew&quot;;
* &quot;presbyter&quot;, &quot;priest&quot;;
* &quot;pyx(is)&quot;, &quot;box&quot;;
* &quot;scandal&quot;, &quot;slander&quot;;
* / &quot;tripod&quot;, &quot;tripos&quot; (both learned);
* &#x27;drum&#x27; &quot;tympanum&quot; &#x27;eardrum&#x27;, &quot;timbre&quot;, &quot;timpani&quot;;
* &quot;frenetic&quot;, &quot;frantic&quot;;
* &quot;chirurgical&quot;, &quot;surgeon&quot;;
* &quot;chorus&quot;, &quot;choir&quot;, &quot;hora&quot; (via Turkish, Romanian, and modern Hebrew);
* &quot;chrism&quot;, &quot;cream&quot;;
* &quot;Christian&quot;, &quot;christen&quot;, &quot;cretin&quot;;
* &quot;horo(scope)&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;.
Other doublets come from differentiation in the borrowing languages:
* &quot;grammatic(al)&quot;: &quot;grammar&quot;, &quot;glamor&quot;, &quot;grimoire&quot;;
* &quot;discus&quot;: &quot;disc&quot;, &quot;dish&quot;, &quot;dais&quot;, and &quot;desk&quot;;
* &quot;cither&quot;: &quot;guitar&quot;, &quot;zither&quot;, &quot;gittern&quot;, &quot;cittern&quot;, &quot;etc.&quot;;

* &quot;crypt&quot;: &quot;grotto&quot;, &quot;(under)croft&quot;;
* &quot;parabola&quot;: &quot;parable&quot;; additional doublets in Romance give &quot;palaver&quot;, &quot;parol&quot;, and &quot;parole&quot;;
* &quot;phantasy&quot;, &quot;fantasy&quot;, &quot;fantasia&quot;; &quot;fancy&quot; in 15th-century English.
===From modern Greek===

Finally, with the growth of tourism and emigration, some words reflecting modern Greek culture have been borrowed into English—many of them originally borrowings into Greek themselves: 

* &quot;retsina&quot;
* &quot;ouzo&quot;
* &quot;souvlaki&quot; (&lt; Latin)
* &quot;taverna&quot; (&lt; Italian)
* &quot;moussaka&quot; (&lt; Turkish &lt; Arabic)

* &quot;baklava&quot; (&lt; Turkish)
* &quot;feta&quot; (&lt; Italian)
* &quot;bouzouki&quot; (&lt; Turkish)
* &quot;gyro&quot; (the food, a calque of Turkish &quot;döner&quot;).
==Greek as an intermediary==

Many words from the Hebrew Bible were transmitted to the western languages through the Greek of the Septuagint, often without morphological regularization:
* &quot;rabbi&quot; ()
* &quot;seraphim&quot; ()
* &quot;paradise&quot; ( &lt; Hebrew &lt; Persian)
* &quot;pharaoh&quot; ( &lt; Hebrew &lt; Egyptian)

==Written form of Greek words in English==

Many Greek words, especially those borrowed through the literary tradition, are recognizable as such from their spelling. Latin had standard orthographies for Greek borrowings, including: 

* Greek was written as &#x27;y&#x27;
* as &#x27;e&#x27;
* as &#x27;ch&#x27;
* as &#x27;ph&#x27;
* as &#x27;c&#x27;
* rough breathing as &#x27;h&#x27;
* both and as &#x27;i&#x27;

These conventions, which originally reflected pronunciation, have carried over into English and other languages with historical orthography, like French. They make it possible to recognize words of Greek origin, and give hints as to their pronunciation and inflection.

The romanization of some digraphs is rendered in various ways in English. The diphthongs and may be spelled in three different ways in English:

# the Latinate digraphs &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;oe&quot;;
# the ligatures &quot;æ&quot; and &quot;œ&quot;; and
# the simple letter &quot;e&quot;.

The ligatures have largely fallen out of use worldwide; the digraphs are uncommon in American usage, but remain common in British usage. The spelling depends mostly on the variety of English, not on the particular word. Examples include: &quot;encyclopaedia&quot; / &quot;encyclopædia&quot; / &quot;encyclopedia&quot;; &quot;haemoglobin&quot; / &quot;hæmoglobin&quot; / &quot;hemoglobin&quot;; and &quot;oedema&quot; / &quot;œdema&quot; / &quot;edema&quot;. Some words are almost always written with the digraph or ligature: &quot;amoeba&quot; / &quot;amœba&quot;, rarely &quot;ameba&quot;; &quot;Oedipus&quot; / &quot;Œdipus&quot;, rarely &quot;Edipus&quot;; others are almost always written with the single letter: &quot;sphære&quot; and &quot;hæresie&quot; were obsolete by 1700; &quot;phænomenon&quot; by 1800; &quot;phænotype&quot; and &quot;phænol&quot; by 1930. The verbal ending is spelled &quot;-ize&quot; in American English, and &quot;-ise&quot; or &quot;-ize&quot; in British English.

Since the 19th century, a few learned words have been introduced using a direct transliteration of Ancient Greek, including the Greek endings, rather than the traditional Latin-based spelling: &quot;nous&quot; (νοῦς), &quot;koine&quot; (κοινή), &quot;hoi polloi&quot; (οἱ πολλοί), &quot;kudos&quot; (κύδος), &quot;moron&quot; (μωρόν), &quot;kubernetes&quot; (κυβερνήτης). For this reason, the Ancient Greek digraph is rendered differently in different words—as &quot;i&quot;, following the standard Latin form: &quot;idol&quot; &lt; εἴδωλον; or as &quot;ei&quot;, transliterating the Greek directly: &quot;eidetic&quot; (&lt; εἰδητικός), &quot;deixis&quot;, &quot;seismic&quot;. Most plurals of words ending in &quot;-is&quot; are &quot;-es&quot; (pronounced [iːz]), using the regular Latin plural rather than the Greek &quot;-εις&quot;: &quot;crises&quot;, &quot;analyses&quot;, &quot;bases&quot;, with only a few didactic words having English plurals in &quot;-eis&quot;: &quot;poleis&quot;, &quot;necropoleis&quot;, and &quot;acropoleis&quot; (though &quot;acropolises&quot; is by far the most common English plural).

Most learned borrowings and coinages follow the Latin system, but there are some irregularities: 

* &quot;eureka&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; &quot;heuristic&quot;);
* &quot;kaleidoscope&quot; (the regular spelling would be &quot;calidoscope&quot;)
* &quot;kinetic&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; &quot;cinematography&quot;);
* &quot;krypton&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; &quot;cryptic&quot;);
* &quot;acolyte&quot; (&lt; ; would be the etymological spelling, but , , are all found in Latin);
* &quot;stoichiometry&quot; (&lt; ; regular spelling would be ).
* &quot;aneurysm&quot; was formerly often spelled &quot;aneurism&quot; on the assumption that it uses the usual &quot;-ism&quot; ending.

Some words whose spelling in French and Middle English did not reflect their Greco-Latin origins were refashioned with etymological spellings in the 16th and 17th centuries: &quot;caracter&quot; became &quot;character&quot; and &quot;quire&quot; became &quot;choir&quot;.

In some cases, a word&#x27;s spelling clearly shows its Greek origin:

* If it includes &quot;ph&quot; pronounced as /f/ or &quot;y&quot; between consonants, it is very likely Greek.
* If it includes &quot;rrh&quot;, &quot;phth&quot;, or &quot;chth&quot;; or starts with &quot;hy-&quot;, &quot;ps-&quot;, &quot;pn-&quot;, or &quot;chr-&quot;; or the rarer &quot;pt-&quot;, &quot;ct-&quot;, &quot;chth-&quot;, &quot;rh-&quot;, &quot;x-&quot;, &quot;sth-&quot;, &quot;mn-&quot;, &quot;tm-&quot;, &quot;gn-&quot; or &quot;bd-&quot;, it is likely Greek.

There are some exceptions to this pattern:
* &quot;Nephew&quot;, &quot;triumph&quot;, and &quot;sulphur&quot; are ultimately from Latin.
* &quot;Gnat&quot;, &quot;gnaw&quot;, &quot;gneiss&quot; are Germanic.
* &quot;Ptarmigan&quot; is from a Gaelic word, the &quot;p&quot; having been added by false etymology;
* &quot;Style&quot; and &quot;stylus&quot; are probably written with a &#x27;y&#x27; because the Greek word &#x27;column&#x27; (as in &quot;peristyle&quot;, &#x27;surrounded by columns&#x27;) and the Latin word &quot;stilus,&quot; &#x27;stake, pointed instrument&#x27;, were confused. 
* A few borrowings from Arabic are spelled with &quot;ph&quot;: &quot;cipher&quot;, &quot;nenuphar&quot;, &quot;caliph&quot;, &quot;saphena&quot;. 
* &quot;Algorithm&quot; is from Arabic, and was originally written &quot;algorism&quot;, but was respelled in the 16th century, influenced by &quot;arithmetic&quot;.
* &quot;Trophy&quot;, though ultimately of Greek origin, did not have a but a in its Greek form, .

==Pronunciation==

In clusters such as &quot;ps-&quot;, &quot;pn-&quot;, and &quot;gn-&quot; which are not allowed in English phonotactics, the usual English pronunciation drops the first consonant (&quot;e.g.&quot;, psychology) at the start of a word; compare &quot;gnostic&quot; [nɒstɪk] and &quot;agnostic&quot; [ægnɒstɪk]; there are a few exceptions, such as &quot;tmesis&quot; [t(ə)miːsɪs]. Similarly, initial &quot;x-&quot; is pronounced &quot;z&quot;. 

&quot;Ch&quot; is pronounced like &quot;k&quot; rather than as in &quot;church&quot;: &quot;e.g.&quot; character, chaos. The consecutive vowel letters &#x27;ea&#x27; are generally pronounced separately rather than forming a single vowel sound when transcribing a Greek εα, which was not a digraph, but simply a sequence of two vowels with hiatus, as in &quot;genealogy&quot; or &quot;pancreas&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot;, however, &quot;ocean&quot;, ωκεανός); &quot;zeal&quot; (earlier &quot;zele&quot;) comes irregularly from the η in ζήλος.

Some sound sequences in English are only found in borrowings from Greek, notably initial sequences of two fricatives, as in &quot;sphere&quot;. Most initial /z/ sounds are found in Greek borrowings.

The stress of borrowings via Latin generally follows the traditional English pronunciation of Latin, which depends on the syllable weight rules in Latin and ignores Greek stress. For example, in Greek, both ὑπόθεσις (&quot;hypothesis&quot;) and ἐξήγησις (&quot;exegesis&quot;) are accented on the antepenult, and indeed the penult has a long vowel in &quot;exegesis&quot;; but because the penult of Latin &quot;exegēsis&quot; is heavy by Latin rules, the accent falls on the penult in Latin and therefore also in English.

==Inflectional endings and plurals==

Though many English words derived from Greek through the literary route drop the inflectional endings (&quot;tripod&quot;, &quot;zoology&quot;, &quot;pentagon&quot;) or use Latin endings (&quot;papyrus&quot;, &quot;mausoleum&quot;), some preserve the Greek endings:

* -ον: &quot;phenomenon, &quot;criterion, &quot;neuron, &quot;lexicon;
* -∅: &quot;plasma&quot;, &quot;drama&quot;, &quot;dilemma&quot;, &quot;trauma&quot; (&quot;-ma&quot; is derivational, not inflectional);
* -ος: &quot;chaos, &quot;ethos, &quot;asbestos, &quot;pathos, &quot;cosmos&quot;;
* -ς: &quot;climax&quot; (ξ &quot;x&quot; = &quot;k&quot; + &quot;s&quot;), &quot;helix&quot;, &quot;larynx&quot;, &quot;eros, &quot;pancreas, &quot;atlas&quot;;
* -η: &quot;catastrophe, &quot;agape, &quot;psyche&quot;;
* -ις: &quot;analysis, &quot;basis, &quot;crisis, &quot;emphasis; 
* -ης: &quot;diabetes, &quot;herpes, &quot;isosceles&quot;.

In cases like &quot;scene&quot; and &quot;zone&quot; though the Greek words ended in -η, the final silent &quot;e&quot; in English is not derived from the η.

In the case of Greek endings, plurals sometimes follow the Greek rules: &quot;phenomenon, phenomena&quot;; &quot;tetrahedron, tetrahedra&quot;; &quot;crisis, crises&quot;; &quot;hypothesis, hypotheses&quot;; &quot;polis, poleis&quot;; &quot;stigma, stigmata&quot;; &quot;topos, topoi&quot;; &quot;cyclops, cyclopes&quot;; Normally, however, they do not: &quot;colon, colons&quot; not &quot;*cola&quot; (except for the very rare technical term of rhetoric); &quot;pentathlon, pentathlons&quot; not &quot;*pentathla&quot;; &quot;demon, demons&quot; not &quot;*demones&quot;; &quot;climaxes&quot;, not *&quot;climaces&quot;.

Usage is mixed in some cases: &quot;schema, schemas&quot; or &quot;schemata&quot;; &quot;lexicon, lexicons&quot; or &quot;lexica&quot;; &quot;helix, helixes&quot; or &quot;helices&quot;; &quot;sphinx, sphinges&quot; or &quot;sphinxes&quot;; &quot;clitoris, clitorises&quot; or &quot;clitorides&quot;. And there are misleading cases: &quot;pentagon&quot; comes from Greek &quot;pentagonon&quot;, so its plural cannot be *&quot;pentaga&quot;; it is &quot;pentagons&quot;—the Greek form would be &quot;*pentagona&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; Plurals from Latin and Greek).

==Verbs==

A few dozen English verbs are derived from the corresponding Greek verbs; examples are &quot;baptize&quot;, &quot;blame&quot; and &quot;blaspheme&quot;, &quot;stigmatize&quot;, &quot;ostracize&quot;, and &quot;cauterize&quot;. In addition, the Greek verbal suffix &quot;-ize&quot; is productive in Latin, the Romance languages, and English: words like &quot;metabolize&quot;, though composed of a Greek root and a Greek suffix, are modern compounds. A few of these also existed in Ancient Greek, such as &quot;crystallize&quot;, &quot;characterize&quot;, and &quot;democratize&quot;, but were probably coined independently in modern languages. This is particularly clear in cases like &quot;allegorize&quot; and &quot;synergize&quot;, where the Greek verbs ἀλληγορεῖν and συνεργεῖν do not end in &quot;-ize&quot; at all. Some English verbs with ultimate Greek etymologies, like &quot;pause&quot; and &quot;cycle&quot;, were formed as denominal verbs in English, even though there are corresponding Greek verbs, παῦειν/παυσ- and κυκλεῖν.

==Borrowings and cognates==

Greek and English share many Indo-European cognates. In some cases, the cognates can be confused with borrowings. For example, the English &quot;mouse&quot; is cognate with Greek /mys/ and Latin , all from an Indo-European word &quot;*mūs&quot;; none of them is borrowed from another. Similarly, &quot;acre&quot; is cognate to Latin and Greek , but not a borrowing; the prefix &quot;agro-&quot; is a borrowing from Greek, and the prefix &quot;agri-&quot; a borrowing from Latin.

==Phrases==

Many Latin phrases are used verbatim in English texts—&quot;et cetera&quot; (etc.), &quot;ad nauseam&quot;, &quot;modus operandi&quot; (M.O.), &quot;ad hoc&quot;, &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot;, &quot;mea culpa&quot;, and so on—but this is rarer for Greek phrases or expressions: 

* &quot;hoi polloi&quot; &#x27;the many&#x27;
* &quot;eureka&quot; &#x27;I have found [it]&#x27;
* &quot;kalos kagathos&quot; &#x27;beautiful and virtuous&#x27;
* &quot;hapax legomenon&quot; &#x27;once said&#x27;
* &quot;kyrie eleison&quot; &#x27;Lord, have mercy&#x27;

==Calques and translations==

Greek technical words were often calqued in Latin rather than borrowed, and then borrowed from Latin into English. Examples include:

* (grammatical) &quot;case&quot;, from &quot;casus&quot; (&#x27;an event&#x27;, &#x27;something that has fallen&#x27;), a semantic calque of Greek πτώσις (&#x27;a fall&#x27;);
* &quot;nominative&quot;, from &quot;nōminātīvus&quot;, a translation of Greek ὀνομαστική;
* &quot;adverb&quot;, a morphological calque of Greek ἐπίρρημα as &quot;ad-&quot; + &quot;verbum&quot;;
* &quot;magnanimous&quot;, from Greek μεγάθυμος (lit. &#x27;great spirit&#x27;);
* &quot;essence&quot;, from &quot;essentia&quot;, which was constructed from the notional present participle &quot;*essens&quot;, imitating Greek οὐσία.
* &quot;substance&quot;, from &quot;substantia&quot;, a calque of Greek υπόστασις (&quot;cf.&quot; hypostasis);
* Cicero coined &quot;moral&quot; on analogy with Greek ηθικός.
* &quot;recant&quot; is modeled on παλινῳδεῖν.

Greek phrases were also calqued in Latin. Sometimes English uses the Latin form:

* &#x27;god out of the machine&#x27; was calqued from the Greek &quot;apò mēkhanês theós&quot; (ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός).
* is a short form of &quot;Dioscorides&quot;&#x27; &quot;De Materia Medica&quot;, from .
* &quot;&quot; (Q.E.D.) is a calque of .
* &quot;quintessence&quot; is post-classical , from Greek .
Sometimes the Latin is in turn calqued in English:
* English &quot;commonplace&quot; is a calque of , itself a calque of Greek κοινός τόπος.
* &quot;subject matter&quot; is a calque of , itself a calque of Aristotle&#x27;s phrase &quot;.&quot;
* &quot;wisdom tooth&quot; came to English from , from Arabic , from , used by Hippocrates.
* &quot;political animal&quot; is from (in Aristotle&#x27;s Politics).

The Greek word has come into English both in borrowed forms like &quot;evangelical&quot; and the form &quot;gospel&quot;, an English calque (Old English &#x27;good tidings&#x27;) of , itself a calque of the Greek.

==Statistics==
The contribution of Greek to the English vocabulary can be quantified in two ways, &quot;type&quot; and &quot;token&quot; frequencies: type frequency is the proportion of distinct words; token frequency is the proportion of words in actual texts.

Since most words of Greek origin are specialized technical and scientific coinages, the type frequency is considerably higher than the token frequency. And the type frequency in a large word list will be larger than that in a small word list. In a typical English dictionary of 80,000 words, which corresponds very roughly to the vocabulary of an educated English speaker, about 5% of the words are borrowed from Greek.

===Most common===

Of the 500 most common words in English, 18 (3.6%) are of Greek origin: &quot;place&quot; (rank 115), &quot;problem&quot; (121), &quot;school&quot; (147), &quot;system&quot; (180), &quot;program&quot; (241), &quot;idea&quot; (252), &quot;story&quot; (307), &quot;base&quot; (328), &quot;center&quot; (335), &quot;period&quot; (383), &quot;history&quot; (386), &quot;type&quot; (390), &quot;music&quot; (393), &quot;political&quot; (395), &quot;policy&quot; (400), &quot;paper&quot; (426), &quot;phone&quot; (480), &quot;economic&quot; (494).

<doc id="895362" wikidata="Q3774509" url="?curid=895362" title="Southwest Asia Service Medal">
<text>The Southwest Asia Service Medal (SASM or SWASM) was a military award of the United States Armed Forces which was created by order of President George H.W. Bush on March 12, 1991. The award is intended to recognize those military service members who performed duty as part of the Persian Gulf War and for a time thereafter. The medal was designed by Nadine Russell of the Army&#x27;s Institute of Heraldry. The colors of the ribbon are tan, representing sand, with the black, white, red, blue, and green colors symbolizing the colors of coalition countries&#x27; national flags.

==History==

Individuals awarded the Southwest Asia Service Medal must have participated in or supported military operations in Southwest Asia between August 2, 1990, and November 30, 1995. That period of inclusion includes participation in Operations Desert Shield or Desert Storm:

* Iraq
* Kuwait
* Saudi Arabia
* Oman
* Bahrain
* Qatar
* United Arab Emirates
* Persian Gulf
* Red Sea
* Gulf of Oman
* Gulf of Aden
* that portion of the Arabian Sea that lies north of 10 degrees North latitude and west of 68 degrees East longitude

Individuals serving in Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria and Jordan (including the airspace and territorial waters) directly supporting combat operations between January 17, 1991, and April 11, 1991, are also eligible for this award.
To receive the award, a service member must be: attached to or regularly serving for one or more days with an organization participating in ground/shore military operations; attached to or regularly serving for one or more days aboard a naval vessel directly supporting military operations; actually participating as a crew member in one or more aerial flights directly supporting military operations in the areas designated; or serving on temporary duty for 30 consecutive days or 60 nonconsecutive days, except, if a waiver is authorized for personnel participating in actual combat.

For those service members who performed &quot;home service&quot; during the Persian Gulf War, such as support personnel in the United States, the Southwest Asia Service Medal is not authorized. The award is also not authorized for those who performed support of the Persian Gulf War from European or Pacific bases.

===2016 redesign===
In April 2016, the appearance of the suspension and service ribbon of the SWASM was slightly modified by the United States Department of Defense through the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). The DLA made the two vertical green bars and one vertical black bar in the middle wider than in the original 1991 version.

==Campaign phases and devices==
The following are the approved campaign phases and respective inclusive dates for the Southwest Asia Service Medal (SWASM):
The following ribbon devices are authorized for wear on the Southwest Asia Service Medal:
* Campaign stars (all branches)
* Fleet Marine Force Combat Operation Insignia (Navy personnel assigned to a Marine Corps unit in combat)

Examples of campaign stars worn on the Southwest Asia Campaign service ribbon:
While several operations occurred in the geographical areas described above between April 12, 1991, and November 30, 1995, including Operation Provide Comfort (June 1, 1992 – November 30, 1995), Operation Southern Watch (August 27, 1992 – April 29, 2003) and Operation Vigilant Warrior (October 14, 1994 – December 21, 1994), these operations were covered under the third campaign, Southwest Asia Cease-Fire. Service in Operations that extended beyond the final campaign date of November 30, 1995, were recognized by awards of either the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal or the Armed Forces Service Medal.

<doc id="895368" wikidata="Q840919" url="?curid=895368" title="Considered harmful">
<text>Considered harmful is a part of a phrasal template &quot;something considered harmful&quot;. , its snowclones have been used in the titles of at least 65 critical essays in computer science and related disciplines.
Its use in this context originated with a 1968 letter by Edsger Dijkstra published as &quot;Go To Statement Considered Harmful&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Considered harmful&quot; was already a journalistic cliché used in headlines, well before the Dijkstra article, as in, for example, the headline over a letter published in 1949 in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Rent Control Controversy / Enacting Now of Hasty Legislation Considered Harmful&quot;.

&quot;Considered harmful&quot; was popularized among computer scientists by Edsger Dijkstra&#x27;s letter &quot;Go To Statement Considered Harmful&quot;,
published in the March 1968 &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot; (CACM), in which he criticized the excessive use of the GOTO statement in programming languages of the day and advocated structured programming instead. The original title of the letter, as submitted to CACM, was &quot;A Case Against the Goto Statement&quot;, but CACM editor Niklaus Wirth changed the title to &quot;Goto Statement Considered Harmful&quot;. Regarding this new title, Donald Knuth quipped that &quot;Dr. Goto cheerfully complained that he was always being eliminated.&quot;

Frank Rubin published a criticism of Dijkstra&#x27;s letter in the March 1987 CACM where it appeared under the title &quot;″GOTO Considered Harmful&#x27; Considered Harmful&quot;. The May 1987 CACM printed further replies, both for and against, under the title &quot;GOTO Considered Harmful&quot; Considered Harmful&#x27; Considered Harmful?&quot;. Dijkstra&#x27;s own response to this controversy was titled &quot;On a Somewhat Disappointing Correspondence&quot;.

<text>The U.S. Soccer Player of the Year is given by the United States Soccer Federation to the American soccer players judged best in the calendar year. It is considered the highest accolade for American soccer players.

The U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year award originated in 1984, followed by the Female Player of the Year in 1985. Awards for Young Male and Young Female Players were added in 1998. An award for Player of the Year with a Disability was added in 2012 but discontinued after 2020 and replaced with the non-player-specific &quot;ADAPTandTHRIVE Disability Award,&quot; which &quot;recognizes an individual making an impact in the United States&#x27; broad landscape of disability soccer.&quot; In 2021, awards for female and male beach soccer as well as futsal are added.

Public voting for the awards account for 50 percent of the results. The other 50 percent are voted by members of the national media and U.S. Soccer representatives (from national team coaches to the National Board of Directors).

==U.S. Soccer Players of the Year==


=== Multiple winners ===
Landon Donovan and Christian Pulisic are the only male players to win the award four times. Marcelo Balboa was the first player to win the award twice, in 1992 and 1994, and Kasey Keller was the first player to win the award three times (1997, 1999 and 2005). Landon Donovan (2003 and 2004; 2009 and 2010) and Clint Dempsey (2011 and 2012) are the only players to have won the award in consecutive seasons.

Abby Wambach is the only female player to win the award six times, closely followed by Mia Hamm with 5. April Heinrichs was the first player to win the award twice, in 1986 and 1989, Mia Hamm was the first player to win the award three, four, and five times, and Abby Wambach was the first and only player to win the award six times. Hamm is the only player to have won the award five times in a row (1994–98), while Michelle Akers (1990 and 1991), Tiffeny Milbrett (2000 and 2001), Abby Wambach (2003 and 2004; 2010 and 2011) and Kristine Lilly (2005 and 2006) are the only players to have won the award in consecutive seasons.

<text>Ashtavinayaka () is a Sanskrit term which means &quot;eight Ganeshas&quot;. The Ashtavinayaka [[Yatra]] refers to a pilgrimage to the eight Hindu temples in the state of Maharashtra, India, centered around the city of Pune. The eight temples house eight distinct idols of Ganesha, the Hindu deity of unity, prosperity, learning, and removing obstacles. Each of these temples has its own individual legend and history, as distinct from each other as the murtis in each temple. The form of each murti of Ganesha and his trunk are distinct from one another. There are other temples of eight Ganesha in various other parts of Maharashtra; however, the ones around Pune are more well known and visited. To complete the Ashtavinayaka Yatra, one must revisit the first temple after visiting all the eight temples.

The Ashtavinayaka Yatra is a pilgrimage covering these eight holy abodes of Ganesha in and around Pune and Raigad District of Maharashtra. Out of these 8 Temples, 5 are in Pune, 2 are in Raigad and 1 is in Ahmednagar(Ahilya nagar) District. Ganesha is worshiped first before any other worship service is carried out to any other deity. The pilgrimage takes 3 days to complete. As per scriptures travel starts from Moreswar in Moregaon then Siddhivinayak temple of Siddhtek, Pali, Mhad, Theur Chintamani Ganesh in Pune, Lenyandri, Ojar, Ranjangaon then back to Moregaon where pilgrimage had started.

==Temples==
The eight temples/idols of the Ashtavinayaka in their religious sequence are:

Traditionally, Moreshwar of Moregaon is the first temple visited by the pilgrims. The temples should be visited in this order Moregaon, Siddhatek, Pali, Mahad, Theur, Lenyandri, Ozar, Ranjangaon. The pilgrimage is concluded with a second visit to Moregaon.

All these murtis are called svayambhu idols in Sanskrit (self-originating/self-existent images, and not carved images).

===Mayureshwar===

This is the most important temple on this pilgrimage. The temple, built from black-stone during the Bahamani reign, has four gates (it is supposed to have been built by one of the knights named Mr. Gole, from the court of Bidar&#x27;s Sultan). The temple is situated in the centre of the village. The temple is covered from all sides by four minarets and gives the impression of a mosque if seen from a distance. This was done to prevent attacks on the temple during Mughal periods. The temple has a 50-foot tall wall around it.

There is a Nandi (Shiva&#x27;s bull mount) sitting in front of this temple entrance, which is unique, as Nandi is normally in front of only Shiva temples. However, the story says
that this statue was being carried to some Shivamandir during which the vehicle carrying it
broke down and the Nandi statue could not be removed from its current place.

The murti of Ganesha, riding a peacock, in the form of Mayureshwara is believed to have slain the demon Sindhu at this spot. The idol, with its trunk turned to the left, has a cobra (&quot;Nagaraja&quot;) poised over it protecting it. This form of Ganesha also has two other murtis of Siddhi (Capability) and Riddhi (Intelligence).

However, this is not the original murti -which is said to have been consecrated twice by Brahma, once before and once after being destroyed by the asura Sindhurasur. The original murti, smaller in size and made of atoms of sand, iron, and diamonds, was supposedly enclosed in a copper sheet by the Pandavas and placed behind the one that is currently worshipped.

The cited temple is the Morgaon Temple, one of the Ashtavinayaka temples in Maharashtra, India. It is located in the village of Morgaon, some 55 kilometres from Pune, along the Karha River. The name of the village is taken from the Marathi word for peacock, and it is claimed to be laid out in the shape of a peacock.

The Ashtavinayaka temples are a significant pilgrimage circuit dedicated to Lord Ganesha in Maharashtra. This circuit&#x27;s temples are each associated with a different mythology and divinity. Morgaon Temple is one of these eight temples, and it is spiritually and culturally significant to Lord Ganesha worshippers.
===Siddhivinayak===

According to regional legend, Vishnu is believed to have vanquished the asuras Madhu and Kaitabha after propitiating Ganesha here.

This is the only murti of these eight with the trunk positioned to the right.

It is believed that the two saints Shri Morya Gosavi and Shri Narayan Maharaj of Kedgaon received their enlightenment here.

The temple is North-facing and is on a small hillock. The main road towards the temple was believed to be built by Peshwa&#x27;s general Haripant Phadake. The inner sanctum, 15 feet high and 10 feet wide is built by Punyashloka Ahilyabai Holkar. The idol is 3 feet tall and 2.5 feet wide. The idol faces North-direction. The stomach of the murti is not wide, but Riddhi and Siddhi murtis are sitting on one thigh. This murti&#x27;s trunk is turning to the right. The right-sided-trunk Ganesha is supposed to be very strict for the devotees. To make one round (pradakshina) around the temple one has to make the round trip of the hillock. This takes about 30 minutes with moderate speed.

Peshwa general Haripant Phadake lost his General&#x27;s position and did 21 Pradakshina around the temple. On the 21st day Peshwa&#x27;s court-man came and took him to the court with royal honor. Haripant promised the God that he will bring the stones of the castle which he will win from the first war he will fight as the general. The stone pathway is built from the Badami-Castle which was attacked by Haripant soon after he became the general.

This temple is situated off the Pune-Solapur highway about 48 km from the town of Srigonda in Ahmadnagar district. The temple is situated next to Bhima river. On Pune-Solapur railway, Daund Railway station is 18 km from here.

===Ballaleshwar===

Ganesha is believed to have saved this boy-devotee, Ballala, who was beaten by local villagers and his father (Kalyani-seth) for his single-minded devotion to him.

The original wooden temple was reconstructed into a stone temple by Nana Phadanavis in 1760. There are two small lakes constructed on two sides of the temple. One of them is reserved for the puja (worship) of the Deity.

This Temple faces the east and has two sanctums. The inner one houses the murti and has a Mushika (Ganesha&#x27;s mouse vahana) with modaka in his forepaws in front of it. The hall, supported by eight exquisitely carved pillars demands as much attention as the idol, sitting on throne carved like a cypress tree. The eight pillars depict the eight directions. Inner sanctum is 15 feet tall and outer one is 12 feet tall. The temple is constructed in such a way that after the winter (dakshinayan : southward movement of the sun) solstice, the sun rays fall on the Ganesha murti at sunrise. The temple is built with stones which are stuck together very tight using melted lead.

Like a few other murtis, this one has diamonds embedded in the eyes and navel, and with His trunk pointing to the left.

One speciality of this temple is that the prasad offered to this Ganapati at Pali is Besan Laadu instead of Modak that is normally offered to other Ganapatis.

The shape of the idol itself bears a striking semblance with the mountain which forms the backdrop of this temple. This is more prominently felt if one views the photograph of the mountain and then sees the idol.

The temple is located in the town of Pali, off the Mumbai-Pune highway, about 11 km before Nagothane on the Mumbai-Goa highway. This is located 30 km to the South-West of Karjat Railway Station. Mumbai-Panvel-Khopoli-Pali is 124 km. Pune-Lonavla-Khopoli-Pali is 111 km.

Behind this temple is the temple of Shri Dhundi-Vinayak which is West facing. This is a very rare idol which is facing the West. The story says that this idol was the same one which
was thrown by Ballala&#x27;s father (Kalyani-seth) while Ballala was worshipping it.

History of Temple

Ganesha Purana gives an elaborate picture of LEELAS of Ganesha. The legendary story of Ballaleshwar is covered in Upasana Khand Section -22 occurred in Pali – the old name Pallipur.

Kalyansheth was a merchant in Pallipur and was married to Indumati. The couple was childless for quite some time but later had a son known as Ballal. As Ballal grew, he spent much of his time in worshiping and praying. He was devotee of Ganesha and used to worship stone idol of Ganesha in the forest along with his friends and companions. As it used to take time, the friends would reach home late. Regular delay in returning house used to irritate the parents of the friends of Ballal who complained to his father saying that Ballal was responsible for spoiling the kids. Already unhappy with Ballal for not concentrating on his studies, Kalyansheth was boiling with anger when he heard the complaint. Immediately he reached the place of worship in the forest and devastated Pooja arrangements organized by Ballal and his friends. He threw away the Stone Idol of Ganesha and broke the pandal. All the kids were frightened but Ballal who was engrossed in Pooja and japa, did not notice the event. Kalayan beat Ballal mercilessly and tied him to the tree saying to get fed and freed by Ganesha. He left for home thereafter.

Ballal semiconscious and tied to the tree in the forest was lying as that with severe pain all over, started calling his beloved God, Ganesha.

&quot;O Lord, Ganesha, I was busy in praying you, I was right and humble but my cruel father has spoiled my act of devotion and hence I am unable to perform Pooja.&quot;

Ganesha was pleased and responded quickly. Ballal was freed. He blessed Ballal to be superior devotee with larger lifespan. Ganesha hugged Ballal and said that his father would suffer for his wrongdoings.

Ballal insisted that Ganesha should continue to stay there at Pali. Nodding His head Ganesha made his permanent stay at Pali as Ballal Vinayak and disappeared in a large stone. This is famous as Ballaleshwar.

===Shri Dhundi Vinayak===

In the above-mentioned story the stone idol which Ballal used to worship and which was thrown away by Kalyan Sheth is known as Dhundi Vinayak. The idol is facing west. The birth celebration of Dhundi Vinayak takes place from Jeshtha Pratipada to Panchami. From ancient time, it is a practice to take darshan of Dhundi Vinayak before proceeding to main idol Shree Ballaleshwar.

===Varadavinayak===

The handsome Prince Rukmangad refused sage Vachaknavi&#x27;s wife Mukunda&#x27;s illicit call, and was cursed to suffer from leprosy. Mukunda was satisfied by Indra who deceived her as Rukmangad and she bore a child by name Grutsamad. When Grutsamad discovered the truth, he cursed his mother Mukunda to become the tree of Bori and she in turn cursed him to bear a demon son named Tripurasur, the one who was defeated by Shiva after praying the Ranjangaon Ganesha. Grutsamad after being cursed went to the forest of Pushpak and worshipped Ganesha. Sage Grutsamad is famous for the mantra &quot;GaNanaN Tva&quot;. He founded the temple and called this Ganesha: Varada-Vinayak.

Ganesha is said to reside here in the form of Varada Vinayaka, the giver of bounty and success. The idol was found in the adjoining lake (to Mr. Dhondu Paudkar in 1690AD), in an immersed position and hence its weathered look. In 1725AD the then Kalyan subhedar, Mr. Ramji Mahadev Biwalkar built the Varadavinayak temple and the village of Mahad.

The idol faces the east, has its trunk to the left and has been in the constant company of an oil lamp - said to be burning continuously since 1892. There are four elephant idols on four sides of the temple. The hall is 8 feet by 8 feet. The dome is 25feet high and is golden at the top. The dome has designs of cobra.

This is the only temple where devotees are allowed to personally pay their homage and respects to the idol. They are allowed in the immediate vicinity of this idol to perform their prayers.

The temple is located three kilometers off the Mumbai-Pune highway near Khopoli (80 km from Pune), and is thus closest to Mumbai city. Karjat Railway Station, Karjat on Mumbai-Pune railway is 24 km from this place and 6 km from Khopoli.

===Chintamani===
Ganesha is believed to have got back the precious Chinatamani jewel from the greedy Guna for sage Kapila at this spot. However, after bringing back the jewel, sage Kapila put it in Vinayaka&#x27;s (Ganesha&#x27;s) neck. Thus the name Chintamani Vinayak. This happened under the Kadamb tree, therefore Theur is known as Kadambanagar in old times.

The lake behind the temple is called Kadambteertha. The temple entrance is North facing. The outer wooden hall was built by Peshwas. The main temple is supposed to have been built by Dharanidhar Maharaj Dev from the family-lineage of Shri Moraya Gosavi. He must have built this around 100 years before Senior Shrimant Madhavrao Peshwa built the outer wooden hall.

This idol also has a left trunk, with carbuncle and diamonds as its eyes. The idol faces east.

Theur&#x27;s Chintamani was the family deity of Shrimant Madhavrao I Peshwa. He suffered from tuberculosis and died at a very young age (~27 years). He is supposed to have died in this temple. His wife, Ramabai committed Sati with him on 18 November 1772.

The temple is located 22 km from Pune, off the Pune-Solapur highway, and is hence the nearest from Pune. The village of Theur sits at the confluence of three major regional rivers—Mula, Mutha &amp; Bhima.

===Girijatmaj===
It is believed that Parvati (Shiva&#x27;s wife) performed penance to beget Ganesha at this point. Girija&#x27;s (Parvati&#x27;s) Atmaj (son) is Girijatmaj. This temple stands amidst a cave complex of 18 caves of Buddhist origin. This temple is the eighth cave. These are called Ganesha-leni as well. The temple is carved out of a single stone hill, which has 307 steps. The temple features a wide hall with no supporting pillars. The temple hall is 53 feet long, 51 feet wide and 7 feet high.

The idol faces north with its trunk to the left, and has to be worshipped from the rear of the temple. The temple faces south. This idol seems little different from the rest of the Ashtavinayaka idols in a sense that it appears to be poorly designed or carved like the other idols. This idol can be worshipped by anyone. There is no electric bulb in the temple. The temple is constructed such that during the day it is always lighted by sunshine.

The temple is situated 12 km from Narayangaon, which is about 94 km from Pune on the Pune-Nashik highway. Nearest railway station is Talegaon. From Junnar, Lenyadri is about 5 km. Shivaneri castle is close by (5 to 6 km) where Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born.

===Vighneshwar===
The history encompassing this idol states that Vighnasur, a demon was created by the King of Gods, Indra to destroy the prayer organized by King Abhinandan. However, the demon went a step further and destroyed all vedic, religious acts and to answer the people&#x27;s prayers for protection, Ganesha defeated him. The story goes on to say that on being conquered, the demon begged and pleaded with Ganesha to show a mercy. Ganesha then granted in his plea, but on the condition that demon should not go to the place where Ganesha worshipping is going on. In return the demon asked a favour that his name should be taken before Ganesha&#x27;s name, thus the name of Ganesha became Vighnahar or Vighneshwar (Vighna in Sanskrit means a sudden interruption in the ongoing work due to some unforeseen, unwarranted event or cause). The Ganesha here is called Shri Vighneshwar Vinayak.

The temple faces east and is surrounded by a thick stone wall. One can walk on the wall. The main hall of the temple is 20feet long and the inner hall is 10feet long. This idol, facing the east, has its trunk towards the left and rubies in its eyes. There is a diamond on the forehead and some jewel in the navel. Idols of Riddhi and Siddhi are placed on the two sides of the Ganesha idol. The temple top is Golden and is possibly built by Chimaji Appa after defeating the Portuguese rulers of Vasai and Sashti. The temple is probably built around 1785CE.

This temple is located just off the Pune-Nashik Highway, in the town of Ozhar. It is enclosed on all sides by high stone walls, and its pinnacle is made of gold. The temple is situated on the banks of river Kukadi. Via Mumbai-Thane-Kalyan-Bapsai-Saralgaon-Otur, Ozhar is 182 km.

===Mahaganapati===
Shiva is believed to have worshipped Ganesha before fighting the demon Tripurasura here. The temple was built by Shiva where he worshipped Ganesha, and the town he set up was called Manipur which is now known as Ranjangaon.

Ranjangaon Ganpati is one among the Ashtavinayaka, celebrating eight instances of legends related to Ganesha. This Temple Ganpati Idol was inaugurated and donated by &quot;Khollam&quot; family one of the Gold Smith family in Ranjangaon. According to the history the temple was built in between 9th and 10th centuries.

While going from the Pune - Nagar highway the route is Pune - Koregaon - then via Shikrapur; Rajangaon is 21 km before Shirur. From Pune it is 50 km.

The idol faces the east, is seated in a cross-legged position with a broad forehead, with its trunk pointing to the left. It is said that the original idol is hidden in the basement, having 10 trunks and 20 hands and is called Mahotkat, however, the temple authorities deny existence of any such idol.

Constructed so that the rays of the sun fall directly on the idol (during the Southward movement of the sun), the temple bears a distinct resemblance to the architecture reminiscent of the 9th and 10th Centuries and faces the east. Shrimant Madhavrao Peshwa used to visit this temple very often and built the stone sanctum around the idol and in 1790 AD Mr. Anyaba Dev was authorised to worship the idol.

The Temple: Mahaganapati is portrayed, seated on a lotus, flanked by his consorts Siddhi and Ridhi. The temple dates back to the period of Peshwa Madhav Rao.

The temple of Maha Ganpati is very close to the centre of the town Ranjangaon. The temple was erected during the rule of the Peshwas. Peshwa Madhavrao had constructed the inner sanctum, to house the swayambhoo (naturally found) idol.

The temple faces east. It has an imposing main gate which is guarded by two statues of Jay and Vijay. The temple is designed in such away that during Dakshinayan, the apparent movement of the sun to the south, the rays of the sun fall directly on the deity.

The deity is seated and flanked on both sides by Riddhi and Siddhi. The trunk of the deity turns to the left. There is a local belief that the real statue of Mahaganpati is hidden in some vault and this statue has ten trunks and twenty arms. But there is nothing to substantiate this belief.

Festivals: As with all other Ashtavinayaka (Ganesha) temples, Ganesha Chaturti is celebrated in great splendor here.

Legend has it that when a sage had once sneezed he gave out a child; since being with the sage the child learnt many good stuff about lord Ganesha, however had inherited many evil thoughts within; when he grew he developed in to a demon by name Tripurasura; thereafter he prayed to Lord Shiva and got three powerful citadels (the evil Tripuram forts) of gold, silver and bronze with a boon of invincibility until all the three are in linear; with the boon to his side he caused suffering to all beings in the heavens and on earth. Upon hearing the fervent appeals of the Gods, Shiva intervened, and realized that he could not defeat the demon. It was upon hearing Narada Muni&#x27;s advice that Shiva saluted Ganesha and then shot a single arrow that pierced through the citadels, bringing an end to the demon.

Shiva, the slayer of the Tripura citadels is enshrined at Bhimashankaram nearby.

A variation of this legend is commonly known in southern India. Ganesha is said to have caused the axle in Shiva&#x27;s chariot to break, as the latter headed to battle the demon without saluting Ganesha before he set out. Upon realizing his act of omission, Shiva saluted his son Ganesha, and then proceeded victoriously to a short battle against the powerful demon. (See Acharapakkam - an ancient temple in Tamil Nadu glorified by the 1st millennium Tamil hymns enshrining Shiva associated with this legend, as well as Tiruvirkolam and Tiruvatikai - both over 1200 years old, associated with the legend of Tripurasamhaaram).

(The Tamil lines of 15th century saint poet Arunagirinathar: &#x27;Muppuram eri seida, Acchivan urai ratham, acchadu podi seida athi deera&#x27; where he describes Ganesha as the valiant hero, who caused the axle of Shiva&#x27;s chariot to crumble to dust, as Shiva headed out to destroy Tripurasura, narrate this legend.)

<text>Standing in the Shadows of Motown is a 2002 American documentary film directed by Paul Justman that recounts the story of the Funk Brothers, the uncredited and largely unheralded studio musicians who were the house band that Berry Gordy hand-picked in 1959.

==Background==
The Funk Brothers recorded and performed on Motown&#x27;s recordings from 1959 to 1972. The film was inspired by the 1989 book &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown: The Life and Music of Legendary Bassist James Jamerson&quot;, a bass guitar instruction book by Allan Slutsky, which features a biography of James Jamerson along with his bass lines.

The film covers the Funk Brothers&#x27; career via interviews with surviving band members, archival footage and still photos, dramatized re-enactments, and narration by actor Andre Braugher. The film also features new live performances of several Motown hit songs, with the Funk Brothers backing up Gerald Levert, Me&#x27;shell Ndegeocello, Joan Osborne, Ben Harper, Bootsy Collins, Chaka Khan, and Montell Jordan.

The impetus behind making the film was to bring these influential players out of anonymity. In addition to bassist James Jamerson, the Funk Brothers consisted of the following musicians: Jack Ashford (percussion); Bob Babbitt (bass); Joe Hunter (keyboards); Uriel Jones (drums); Joe Messina (guitar); Eddie Willis (guitar); Richard &quot;Pistol&quot; Allen (drums); Benny &quot;Papa Zita&quot; Benjamin (drums); Eddie &quot;Bongo&quot; Brown (percussion); Johnny Griffith (keyboards); Earl Van Dyke (keyboards); and Robert White (guitar).

The Funk Brothers produced more hits than the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys and Elvis Presley combined. It was their sound, according to Mary Wilson (of the Supremes), that backed the Temptations, the Supremes, the Miracles, the Four Tops, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and Mary Wells, among other noteworthy bands during their tenure from 1959 to 1972.

<text>The Mercury Mariner is a compact crossover SUV that was introduced in 2005. It is a sibling of the Mazda Tribute and Ford Escape, although it is more upmarket than the other two. The Mariner is Mercury&#x27;s first car-based SUV, and is slotted below the Mountaineer in the lineup. When Ford eliminated the Mercury brand, the Mariner ended production in October 2010.

The Mariner was officially offered in the U.S., Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the U.A.E.

== First generation (2005–2007) ==

Introduced during the 2005 refresh of the Ford Escape, the Mercury Mariner was positioned above both it and the Mazda Tribute in the compact sport utility vehicle group. It also includes stylistic differences, such as a two-tone interior, turn signal repeaters borrowed from the European-market Ford Maverick, monotone cladding, and the signature Mercury &quot;waterfall&quot; front grille. 
Unlike its counterparts, a manual transmission was not part of the powertrain lineup. The Mariner was the first Mercury with a four-cylinder since the Mercury Cougar was dropped in 2002. For 2006, the lineup was expanded with the introduction of the Mariner Hybrid.

== Second generation (2008–2011) ==

For the second generation for the Mariner, the 2008 model year boasted a thorough redesign, despite remaining on the Ford CD2 platform used by the outgoing generation.

The exterior changes included new seats, headlights, taillights, a new liftgate, a higher beltline, new doors, and new wheels. The interior was also significantly updated with higher quality materials and included more features. The engines remained the same but the 3.0 L Duratec V6 has been modified to reduce fuel consumption by 10%.

Mariner and its Ford Escape sibling were the first vehicles to feature Ford&#x27;s pull-drift steering compensation, an enhancement made possible by applying software control to the Electric Power Steering (EPS) system.

The first 2008 Mercury Mariner was unveiled at the South Florida International Auto Show on October 6, 2006, and was touted as a new direction for the Mercury brand.

===2009 changes===
The 2009 Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner were unveiled at the 2008 Washington Auto Show. Sporting a 2.5-liter engine and 6-speed automatic transmission that replaced the four-speed automatic transmission, the new powertrain improved the EPA fuel economy by 1 mile per gallon and increased power by 11% to . The existing 3.0-liter Duratec V6 was bumped from to .

The new 4-cylinder engine was also used in Ford&#x27;s Escape Hybrid and Mercury Mariner Hybrid. “For every eight Escape and Mariner vehicles we sell, one of them is a hybrid, and the appeal is growing,” says Sue Ciscke, Ford senior vice president, Sustainability, Environment and Safety Engineering.

===2010 changes===
For the 2010 model year, the Mariner added Ford&#x27;s MyKey and trailer sway controls as standard on all trim levels. The Mariner also saw the addition of Flex-Fuel, the ability to run using E85 fuel or regular unleaded gasoline with the V6 engine. Mercury removed the Euro-style turn signal repeaters for this model year.

===2011 changes===
For the 2011 model year, the Mariner featured HD Radio as a standard, but continued with the same features as the 2010 models. This version of the Mariner was its last, as Ford discontinued the Mercury brand due to declining sales. Ford ended production of the Mariner in October 2010.

The last Mariner was assembled on October 5, 2010.
==Variants==

=== Hybrid ===
The Mariner Hybrid powertrain was identical to its sibling, the &quot;Ford Escape Hybrid.&quot; It was launched to the U.S. market in 2006 and was discontinued in 2010 with the rest of the brand. The Mariner hybrid sold a total of 12,300 units.

Like the Ford Escape Hybrid, the Mariner Hybrid is a &quot;full&quot; hybrid electric system, meaning the system can switch automatically between pure electric power, pure gasoline engine power, or a combination of electric battery and gasoline engine operating together, for maximum performance and efficiency at all speeds and loads. When braking or decelerating, the Mariner&#x27;s hybrid system uses regenerative braking, where the electric drive motor becomes a generator, converting the vehicle&#x27;s momentum back to electricity for storage in the batteries. With , the Mariner Hybrid has nearly the same acceleration performance as the conventional V6 Mariner. Again, just like the Escape Hybrid, it gets a respectable average of and is sometimes said to be the most fuel efficient sport utility vehicle on the road.

=== Presidential Edition ===

On September 7, 2006, Ford delivered a special &quot;Presidential Edition&quot; Mercury Mariner Hybrid to former President Bill Clinton. Its custom features include:

* LED lighting
* A 120V outlet
* Rear bucket seats
* Center console &amp; rear seat fold-out writing desks
* Personal DVD players for each seat
* Refrigerator
* Increased rear seat legroom

There have also been several undisclosed security modifications made to the vehicle.

<doc id="895400" wikidata="Q1604565" url="?curid=895400" title="USS Patoka">
<text>USS &quot;Patoka&quot; (AO–9/AV–6/AG–125) was a replenishment oiler made famous as a tender for the airships , and . It was also notable in that its height () figured prominently in the design of the Rainbow Bridge in Texas (the bridge design required that the &quot;Patoka&quot;, then the tallest ship in the U.S. Navy, could sail under it; however, it never did).

==Construction and commissioning==

Named for the Patoka River, &quot;Patoka&quot; was laid down on 17 December 1918 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company of Newport News, Virginia and launched on 26 July 1919. Acquired by the Navy from the United States Shipping Board on 3 September 1919, and commissioned on 13 October 1919.

==1920s and 1930s==
Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, &quot;Patoka&quot; departed Norfolk on 4 November 1919 for Port Arthur, Texas, where she loaded fuel oil and sailed for Scotland, arriving on the Clyde on 6 December. She returned to Port Arthur for more oil and got under way on 9 January 1920 for the Adriatic Sea, arriving at Split on 12 February. Returning to the United States in April &quot;Patoka&quot; went back to the Near East, arriving at Istanbul in June. After duty in the Adriatic and Mediterranean she returned to the United States, and served on both the east and west coasts until 1924 when she was selected as a tender for the rigid airship .

A mooring mast some 125 feet above the water was constructed; additional accommodations both for the crew of &quot;Shenandoah&quot; and for the men who handled and supplied the airship were added; facilities for the helium, gasoline, and other supplies necessary for &quot;Shenandoah&quot; were built; as well as handling and stowage facilities for three seaplanes. This work by the Norfolk Navy Yard was completed shortly after 1 July 1924. &quot;Patoka&quot; retained her oiler hull classification symbol of AO–9 instead of receiving the Lighter-than-air aircraft tender (AZ) symbol.

&quot;Patoka&quot; engaged in a short series of mooring experiments with the &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, which had reported to the Commander, Scouting Fleet, for duty on 1 August 1924. The first successful mooring was made on 8 August 1924.

In October, &quot;Patoka&quot;, along with the cruisers and , were assigned stations in the mid-Atlantic to furnish the US Navy&#x27;s second operational airship, , with the weather reports and forecasts during her flight, 12 to 15 October 1924, from Germany, where she had been built, to Lakehurst Naval Air Station, New Jersey.

During 1925 &quot;Patoka&quot; operated with both &quot;Shenandoah&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles&quot; in demonstrating the mobility of airships, and in reducing the number of ground personnel required to handle them. A projected polar flight by &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, using &quot;Patoka&quot; as her base of operations, was cancelled when the airship was lost in a storm on 3 September 1925.

Between 1925 and 1932 &quot;Patoka&quot; operated with &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and served as her base of supply and operations on her long-range flights to Puerto Rico (1925), Panama (1928), Florida (1929), and during the fleet concentration off Panama (1931). During 1932 she also operated with the newly acquired airship , but the decommissioning of &quot;Los Angeles&quot; on 30 June 1932, and the loss of &quot;Akron&quot; on 4 April 1933 saw a reduced need for an airship tender, with &quot;Patoka&quot; decommissioned on 31 August 1933.

On 10 November 1939 &quot;Patoka&quot; recommissioned at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Comdr. C.A.F. Sprague in command, and reported to Patrol Wing 5, Aircraft, Scouting Force. Her classification had been changed to AV–6, seaplane tender, on 11 October 1939.

On 18 January 1940 she departed Puget Sound and, after taking on fuel and cargo at San Pedro, arrived at San Diego on the 31st. She steamed for the east coast on 5 February and reached Norfolk on 25 March. Next &quot;Patoka&quot; was assigned to the Naval Transportation Service in June and was reclassified AO–9 on 19 June 1940.

On 13 August she departed Norfolk and sailed to Houston. Between August and December 1940, she operated out of Houston and Baytown, Texas, delivering fuel oil to Boston, Melville, Norfolk, Charleston, and Key West.

From March 1941 to September &quot;Patoka&quot; delivered fuel oil and general cargo to various units of the Fleet in the Atlantic, Gulf, and Caribbean areas. On 28 September she departed Norfolk and proceeded, via Aruba, to Recife, Brazil. &quot;Patoka&quot; made one more round trip to Recife before the United States entered World War II.

==World War II, 1941–1943==

On 7 December 1941, &quot;Patoka&quot; was moored at Recife, acting as tanker, cargo, store ship, and repair ship. Here she supplied the units of Task Force 3 (later 23) with fuel, diesel, lubricating oil; gasoline stores; provisions; and repairs.

Shortly after the turn of the new year 1942, she got under way for Bahia, Brazil, anchoring there on 8 January. There, she received word that ships bearing rubber and other vital war goods had left French Indochina bound for the Axis controlled ports in Europe. &quot;Patoka&quot; requested and received permission to patrol the shipping lanes off Bahia. When she had completed her patrol duties she put into port and returned to Recife on 22 January. Six days later she was bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico, but en route she was diverted to Trinidad, BWI. Taking on fuel and stores she returned to Recife. Standing out of the harbor on 21 February, she again set course, changed several times to avoid reported submarines, and reached San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 4 March. Her return trip to Recife was made without incident.

On 25 May 1942, while again returning to Recife from Trinidad escorted by , &quot;Patoka&quot; sighted an enemy submarine on the surface. &quot;Jouett&quot; attacked, forcing the U-boat to dive and continued the attack until &quot;Patoka&quot; had escaped. &quot;Patoka&quot; remained at Recife, continuing to supply the ships of Task Force 23 with provisions, supplies and tender services until April 1943, with occasional trips to Puerto Rico and Trinidad for replenishment. &quot;Patoka&quot; then got underway for home, reaching Norfolk on 22 May for overhaul. She sailed for New York on 6 August to join a convoy bound for Aruba, N.W.I. and resumed operations along the coast of South America.

==1944–1945==

In April 1944, she carried 62 prisoners of war (German naval and merchant marine personnel) from Rio de Janeiro to Recife where they were turned over to the U.S. Army. &quot;Patoka&quot; departed on 24 March and arrived Norfolk on 6 April for an overhaul period, to prepare for duty in the Pacific.

On 15 June, &quot;Patoka&quot; departed from Norfolk for the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor. There she was outfitted for duty as a minecraft tender and was reclassified AG–125 on 15 August 1945. Shortly thereafter she sailed via Guam for Okinawa, reaching Buckner Bay on 5 September. &quot;Patoka&quot; provided the minecraft with tender services until 21 September at which time she got underway for Wakayama, Japan. Anchoring there on 23 September, she continued to provide logistic support to units of the 5th Fleet, servicing mine vessels of Task Group 52.6. She remained with the occupation forces until the spring of 1946, returning to the United States on 10 March 1946.

==Fate==

&quot;Patoka&quot; was decommissioned on 1 July 1946, transferred to the War Shipping Administration, and was struck from the Navy List on 31 July 1946. She was sold to Dulien Steel Products Co. for scrap on 15 March 1948.

<text>A mashgiach (, &quot;supervisor&quot;; , &quot;mashgichim&quot;) or mashgicha (pl. &quot;mashgichot&quot;) is a Jew who supervises the kashrut status of a kosher establishment. Mashgichim may supervise any type of food service establishment, including slaughterhouses, food manufacturers, hotels, caterers, nursing homes, restaurants, butchers, groceries, or cooperatives. Mashgichim usually work as on-site supervisors and inspectors, representing a kosher certification agency or a local rabbi, who actually makes the policy decisions for what is or is not acceptably kosher. Sometimes certifying rabbis (, &quot;Rav Hamachshir&quot;; pl., &quot;Rav Hamachshirim&quot;) act as their own mashgichim; such is the case in many small communities.

==Requirements==
The requirements for becoming a mashgiach/mashgicha are being Jewish, being Sabbath-observant (&quot;shomer Shabbat&quot;), being Torah-observant (&quot;shomer mitzvot&quot;), and personally fulfilling the laws of &quot;kashrut&quot; (&quot;shomer kashrut&quot;). According to Rabbi Matisyahu Salomon, a senior Orthodox rabbi in the United States, the most important criterion is &quot;Yirat Shamayim&quot; (fear of Heaven).

Many AKO (Association of Kashrus Organizations) member organizations worldwide require mashgichim to complete the AKO Mashgiach Course, created by the Kosher Institute of America, and obtain a Mashgiach ID Card as a prerequisite to working as a mashgiach or mashgicha.

Most mashgichim are Orthodox. However, there are also Conservative and Reform mashgichim. In 2003, the Kosher Law Enforcement Division of the New York Department of Agriculture and Markets issued fines to two Long Island butchers, Jeff and Brian Yarmeisch, because they had employed a Conservative mashgiach. The United States Supreme Court upheld a ruling by lower courts that New York&#x27;s 88 year old law regulating kashrut was unconstitutional because it favored an Orthodox interpretation of Jewish religious law. When New York state legislators and New York Governor George Pataki convened to consider new legislation, Conservative leaders complained that Orthodox Jews were being favored once again and that Conservative Jews were being excluded from the panel.

Rabbi Mary L. Zamore became the &quot;first Reform mashgiach&quot; when she supervised a kosher bakery in New Jersey from 1997 to 2001.

===Gender===
Although the vast majority of mashgichim are men, most supervising agencies employ women as mashgichot as well. While the profession has historically been very male dominated, an increasing number of women are becoming mashgichot. Shira Feder writing for The Forward has stated that in most kosher homes &quot;you&#x27;ll find a female &quot;mashgiach&quot; bustling about the kitchen — it is often women, after all, who are tasked with the job of maintaining a kosher kitchen... Yet this role rarely translates into the professional food industry.&quot; The greatest number of mashgichot work in the food services industry in the New York City and Los Angeles metropolitan regions. Women working as mashgichot sometimes report lower pay than male mashgichim, discriminatory hiring practices, and lack of respect from employers, coworkers, and customers.

The first training course for mashgichot was held in Baltimore in the fall of 2009, organized by Star-K.

In 2012, the Orthodox Jewish women&#x27;s advocacy group Emunah petitioned the Supreme Court of Israel concerning the rights of women to serve as mashgichot. In 2013, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel voted to allow women to serve as mashgichot. In 2014, nine women took the Chief Rabbinate&#x27;s kosher certification exam in Jerusalem. The liberal Orthodox Tzohar organization, which offers kosher certification independent of the Chief Rabbinate, employed 5 mashgichot as of 2019.

Rabbi Moshe Feinstein has permitted women to serve as mashgichot. Rabbi Meir Amsel issued a rebuttal to Rabbi Feinstein, arguing that women serving as mashgichot could lead to women rabbis.

==Responsibilities==
Depending on the assignment, mashgichim must be familiar with the halakhas of slaughtering meat, cooking meat and fish, and separating meat and dairy. They must be knowledgeable about the way boilers and shipping vessels work, since high temperatures and long storage times can affect the status of kosher foods. It has been said that in addition to knowledge of Jewish law, mashgichim must be familiar with &quot;engineering, entomology, metallurgy, boiler treatment, food chemistry, and world market trends&quot;.

Mashgichim are required whenever meat or fish is prepared or cooked. They check fresh eggs for blood spots before they are used in cooking, and must inspect all vegetables for forbidden insects before use. They are responsible for performing the dough offering, the tithe of dough set aside for consumption by a kohen. Some perform this in the diaspora, whereas in Israel it is always burnt.

Mashgichim must also light pilot lights and turn on cooking and heating equipment to satisfy minimum requirements of bishul Yisrael (food cooked by a Jew) and pas Yisroel (bread baked by a Jew), in a way that a Jew must be involved in the cooking of any kosher food &quot;fit for a king&#x27;s table.&quot; To satisfy requirements for Sephardic Jews, the mashgiah may be required to play an even more active role in the cooking process.

Often, the primary responsibility of mashgichim is washing and inspecting produce to ensure there is no infestation. The skill of inspecting produce properly requires much training and expertise. One of the most pressing jobs of mashgichim, however, is the checking in and verification of shipments. Mashgichim must ensure that every food product that arrives at the facility has a reliable hekhsher (certification) before it is used. Suppliers often substitute products that are out of stock with non-kosher products. Non-kosher establishments would generally not mind these substitutions. For a kosher establishment, however, these substitutions can cause major problems. If a product arrives without a hekhsher, mashgichim must make sure the product is clearly marked as non-kosher and is not used, but returned to the supplier. Sometimes a product arrives that is purportedly kosher, but no hekhsher can be found. In this case, the mashgiach/mashgicha obtains a valid letter of certification from the certifying rabbi or kashrut agency, usually by contacting the manufacturer. In addition to checking hekhsherim, mashgichim must also check that all meat products that arrive are double sealed, usually by inner and outer plastic bags or an inner plastic bag and a sealed box, and that all wine is kosher wine.

Great strides, in the last several years, have been made towards ensuring that kosher products are transported only in kosher approved tanker trucks.

In many settings, mashgichim are merely responsible for making sure that the above tasks are performed by responsible, knowledgeable, and well-trained persons. 

Mashgichim play social as well as technical roles in explaining kosher rules to the Jewish and non-Jewish community and forging close relationships with employees and customers.

<doc id="895405" wikidata="Q5209083" url="?curid=895405" title="Daidala">
<text>The daidala () is a type of sculpture attributed to the legendary Greek artist Daedalus, who is connected in legend both to Bronze Age Crete and to the earliest period of Archaic sculpture in Bronze Age Greece. The legends about Daedalus recognize him both as a man and as a mythical embodiment. 

== History ==
Daedalus was credited as the reputed inventor of &quot;agalmata&quot;, statues of the gods which had open eyes and moveable limbs. These statues were so lifelike that Plato remarked upon their amazing and disconcerting mobility, which was accomplished with techniques that are clearly those of the &quot;daidala&quot;. The writer Pausanias thought that wooden images were referred to as &quot;daidala&quot; even before Daedalus’s time. The name &quot;Daedalus&quot;, more specifically, has been suggested by Alberto Pérez-Gómez to be a play on the Greek word &quot;daidala&quot; which appears in archaic literature as a complement of the verb &quot;to make&quot;, &quot;to manufacture&quot;, &quot;to forge&quot;, &quot;to weave&quot;, &quot;to place on&quot;, or &quot;to see&quot;. Daidala were the implements of early society: defensive works, arms, furniture, and so forth.

== Description ==
Daedalic sculpture is representative of the Orientalizing period in Greek art. Eastern influences are particularly noticeable in the head seen from the front; it resembles an Eastern head, with wiglike hair, but is more angular, having a triangular face, large eyes, and a prominent nose. Furthermore, the hair usually forms two upward-facing triangles on either side of the face. The female body is rather flatly geometric, with high waist and formless drapery. Early sculpture exhibiting these attributes is known as &quot;Daedalic&quot;; it was used for figurines, on clay plaques, and in relief decorations on vases. It seems to have had a marked influence in the Peloponnese, Dorian Crete, and Rhodes. Its style is based on a simple formula which remained dominant, though with evolutionary modifications, for about two generations, before evolving into the Archaic style.

<doc id="895408" wikidata="Q1363145" url="?curid=895408" title="Municipalities of Lithuania">
<text>Lithuania is divided into three levels of administrative divisions. The first-level division consists of 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular – &quot;apskritis&quot;, plural – &quot;apskritys&quot;). These are sub-divided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: plural – &quot;savivaldybės&quot;, singular – &quot;savivaldybė&quot;), which in turn are further sub-divided into over 500 smaller groups, known as elderships (Lithuanian: plural – &quot;seniūnijos&quot;, singular – &quot;seniūnija&quot;).

At the end of its tenure as a Soviet Socialist Republic, Lithuania&#x27;s administrative divisions consisted of 44 regions, 12 cities, 80 towns, 19 settlements, and 426 rural districts. The reform of this system was an immediate concern for the new government. The Constitution of Lithuania, ratified in 1992, delegated the power of establishing future administrative units to the Lithuanian Parliament (Seimas). Accordingly, the Seimas passed two fundamental laws: a 1993 law on government representation and a 1994 law specifying the territorial-administrative units and their boundaries. The current system of a set of municipalities under 10 counties was codified by 1995. Several changes were made in 2000, resulting in 60 municipalities.

Ordinary municipal councilors are elected every four years from electoral lists using proportional representation. The mayor, who used to be a member of the council until 2023, is elected directly by the residents using the two-round system since 2015 reforms. Before then, the mayors were elected by the municipal councils.

The largest municipality by population in Lithuania is Vilnius City Municipality with 593,436 residents, home to one fifth () of the country&#x27;s population. The smallest municipality by population is Neringa Municipality with 4,173 () residents.

The largest municipality by land area is Varėna District Municipality, which spans , while the smallest is Alytus City Municipality at .

==Powers and functions==
Municipalities are established to perform certain functions provided by law. According to the abovementioned Republic of Lithuania Law on Local Self-Government, the functions of municipalities are &quot;functions related to local government, public administration and provision of public services defined by the Constitution and attributed to municipalities by this and other laws&quot;. The processes of integration into international organizations - like the EU and NATO - are considered to be important external factors influencing the development of municipal powers in the country. Lithuania, which has become a member of these organizations, has been assigned completely new responsibilities, some of which, naturally, also belonged to municipalities. In the case of EU integration, municipalities have been assigned the necessary information supply to the European Commission, and in the case of integration into NATO, municipalities have had new functions related to security issues.

<doc id="895409" wikidata="Q1146685" url="?curid=895409" title="Ford F-Series">
<text>The Ford F-Series is a series of light-duty trucks marketed and manufactured by Ford Motor Company since the 1948 model year. The F-Series is marketed as a range of full-sized pickup trucks positioned above the midsize Ranger but below the larger Super Duty in the Ford truck lineup. Alongside the F-150 (introduced in 1975), the F-Series also includes the Super Duty series (introduced in 1999), which includes the heavier-duty F-250 through F-450 pickups, F-450/F-550 chassis cabs, and F-600/F-650/F-750 Class 6–8 commercial trucks.

== History ==
The F-Series was first introduced in 1948 as a replacement for a previous pickup model line based on car platforms.

The most popular version of the model line is the F-150 pickup truck, currently in its fourteenth generation (introduced for the 2021 model year). From 1953 to 1983, the entry-level F-Series pickup was the ton F-100. Starting in 1984, the F-150 became the entry-level. The F-150 has a long-running high-performance off-road trim level introduced for 2010, the (SVT) Raptor currently consisting of three generations. Production of the F-150 SVT Raptor ended in 2014 and it was planned to be succeeded by a new F-150 Raptor, which is based on the thirteenth and fourteenth generation F-150.

The F-Series trucks have been developed into a wide range of design configurations. Alongside medium-duty trucks and &quot;Big Job&quot; conventional trucks (the forerunners of the Ford L-series), the model line has been marketed as a chassis-cab truck and a panel van (a predecessor of the Ford E-Series). The F-Series has served as the platform for various full-sized Ford SUVs, including the Ford Bronco, Ford Expedition/Lincoln Navigator, and Ford Excursion. The F-Series has been marketed by its three North American brands: by Mercury as the M-Series (in Canada from 1948 to 1968), and by Lincoln in the 2000s, as the Blackwood and the later Mark LT (2010s for the latter in Mexico only).

Since 1977, the F-Series has remained the best-selling pickup truck line in the United States; it has been the best-selling vehicle overall since 1981. The F-Series has been the best-selling truck in Canada for over 50 years. As of the 2018 model year, the F-Series generated $41 billion (~$ in ) in annual revenue for Ford. By January 2022, the F-Series models have sold over 40 million units. Currently, Ford manufactures the F-Series in four facilities in the United States.

== First generation (1948–1952) ==

The first-generation F-Series pickup (known as the Ford Bonus-Built) was introduced in 1948 as a replacement for the previous car-based pickup line introduced in 1942. The F-Series was sold in eight different weight ratings, with pickup, panel truck, parcel delivery, cab-over engine (COE), conventional truck, and school-bus chassis body styles.
== Second generation (1953–1956) ==
For the 1953 model year, Ford introduced a second generation of the F-Series trucks. Increased dimensions, improved engines, and an updated chassis were features of the second generation. In another change, the model nomenclature of the F-Series was expanded to three numbers; this remains in use in the present day. The half-ton F-1 became the F-100; the F-2 and F-3 were combined into the -ton F-250, while the F-4 became the one-ton F-350. Conventional F-Series trucks were F-500 to F-900; COE chassis were renamed C-Series trucks.

While the cabs, doors, radiator support, inner fenders, and hoods are the same from 1953 to 1956 F-100 and F-250s (the fenders varied on F-250, F-350, and F-500, and long boxes were only available on the F-250), in 1956, the cab underwent a major revision. Centered around a wraparound windshield, the cab was given new doors, a redesigned dashboard, and an (optional) panoramic rear window. In line with Ford cars, the 1956 F-Series offered seat belts as an option.

This was the final generation with separate front fenders.

== Third generation (1957–1960) ==

Introduced in 1957, the third generation F-Series was a significant modernization and redesign. Front fenders became integrated into the body, and the new &quot;Styleside&quot; bed continued the smooth lines to the rear of the pickup.

The cab-over F-Series was discontinued, having been replaced by the tilt-cab C-Series.

In 1959, Ford began its first production of factory four-wheel-drive pickups.
== Fourth generation (1961–1966) ==
Ford introduced a dramatically new style of pickup in 1961 with the fourth-generation F-Series. Longer and lower than its predecessors, these trucks had increased dimensions and new engine and gearbox choices. Additionally, the 1961–1963 models offered an optional unibody design with the cab and bed integrated. The traditional separate cab/bed was offered concurrently. The unibody proved unpopular, and Ford discontinued the option after the 1963 model year.

In 1965, the F-Series was given a significant mid-cycle redesign. A completely new platform, including the &quot;Twin I-Beam&quot; front suspension, was introduced, and continued to be used until 1996 on the F-150, and is still used today in the F-250 and F-350 4×2. 

A 300 cubic inch (4.9 L) six cylinder inline engine was added for the F-series in 1965. It was essentially the standard Ford 240 cubic inch (3.9 L) truck six with a longer stroke. Additionally, the Ranger name made its first appearance in 1965 on a Ford pickup; previously, the Ranger denoted a base model of the Edsel, but starting in 1965, it was used to denote a high-level styling package for F-Series pickups.
== Fifth generation (1967–1972) ==

Introduced in 1967, the fifth-generation F-Series pickup was built on the same platform as the 1965 revision of the fourth generation. Dimensions were increased, engine options were expanded, and plusher trim levels became available during the fifth generation&#x27;s production run.

Changes during the 1967–1972 run were minimal, but notable. In 1968, to comply with FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards), marker lights were added to the rear bedside and front sides of the hood. 1970 saw a switch from metal bar style grillwork to the plastic eggcrate style.

== Sixth generation (1973–1979) ==

The sixth-generation F-Series was introduced in 1973. This version of the F-Series continued to be built on the 1965 fourth-generation&#x27;s revised platform, but with significant modernization and refinements, including front disc brakes, increased cabin dimensions, full double-wall bed construction, and increased use of galvanized steel.

The FE engine series was discontinued in 1976 after a nearly 20-year run, replaced by the more modern 335 and 385 series engines.

In 1975, the F-150 was introduced in between the F-100 and the F-250 to avoid certain emission control restrictions. For 1978, square headlights replaced the previous models&#x27; round ones on higher-trim-package models, such as Lariat and Ranger, and became standard equipment for 1979. Also for 1978, the Ford Bronco was redesigned into a variant of the F-Series pickup; 1979 was the last year that the 460 engine was available in a half-ton truck.
== Seventh generation (1980–1986) ==

The seventh-generation F-Series was introduced for 1980, marking the first ground-up redesign of the model line since 1965. Alongside an all-new chassis, the pickup trucks received a completely new body. While distinguished by straighter body lines, the aerodynamics of the exterior were optimized to improve fuel economy. Sharing their cab structure with F-Series pickup trucks, medium-duty trucks (F-600 through F-800) underwent their first redesign since 1967.

The powertrain line of this generation underwent multiple revisions through its production. At its launch, the engine line was largely carried over from 1979. While the 7.5L V8 was dropped entirely (in half-tons), a 4.2L V8 was introduced as the smallest V8 engine. For 1982, a 3.8L V6 became the standard engine for the F-100. For 1983, to improve the fuel efficiency of the model line, the M-Series engines (the 5.8L &quot;351M&quot; and 6.6L &quot;400&quot; V8s) were dropped; the latter was replaced by the return of the 7.5L V8. In response to low demand and poor performance, the 4.2L V8 and 3.8L V6 were phased out in 1982 and 1983, respectively. For the F-250 and F-350, a 6.9L diesel V8 (sourced from a partnership with International Harvester) became an option for 1983. For 1984, a high-output version of the 5.8L V8 was introduced. The 5.0L V8 was fitted with fuel injection as standard equipment for 1986, becoming the first fuel-injected engine in an American-market pickup truck. The 4.9L was fuel injected on 1987 models.

In line with the previous generation, the SuperCab and four-door crew cab made their return in 1980 and 1982, respectively. For the first time, a dual-rear-wheel version of the F-350 was offered as a pickup truck.

For 1982, Ford revised the badging of the model line, replacing the &quot;FORD&quot; hood lettering with the Ford Blue Oval grille emblem, a design that remains in use on all F-Series trucks today (except the Raptor). The same year, the Ranger trims was dropped; the name shifted to the Ford Ranger compact pickup (replacing the Ford Courier). After 30 years as the smallest F-Series truck, the F-100 was dropped after 1983, eliminating model overlap with the F-150 (and payload overlap with the Ranger).

This generation was the final version of the F-Series to offer a three-speed, column-shifted manual transmission; it is also the second-to-last vehicle sold in the United States with this configuration. 

== Eighth generation (1987–1991) ==

The eighth-generation F-Series was introduced for 1987 as a major revision of the 1980–1986 generation. While the cab&#x27;s sheet metal was carried over, many body panels were revised, including a completely new front fascia; composite headlights, the first full size American truck to feature them; the interior also underwent a redesign. The long-running Flareside bed design was retired (until its return in the 1992 ninth-generation), with all examples produced with Styleside beds (except for a very small number of 1987 models).

Following the 1986 transition of the 5-liter V8 to fuel injection, the 4.9-liter inline-six followed suit for 1987, with the 5.8- and 7.5-liter engines doing so for 1988; the F-Series became the first American pickup truck model line sold without a carbureted engine option. The same year, the 6.9-liter diesel V8 was increased in size to 7.3 liters. Following the discontinuation of the three-speed manual, a five-speed manual became standard equipment (a four-speed remained a special-order option until 1992). For 1989, an &quot;E4OD&quot; four-speed automatic (overdrive version of the C6 heavy-duty three-speed) was introduced.

Slotted between the F-350 and F-600, the F-Super Duty was introduced in 1987 for the 1988 model year; an ancestor of the current F-450/F-550, the F-Super Duty was designed exclusively for chassis-cab applications.

== Ninth generation (1992–1997) ==

The ninth-generation F-Series was introduced for 1992 as the second redesign of the 1980 F-Series architecture. Adapting design elements from the newly introduced Explorer and redesigned E-Series and Ranger, the F-Series received a slightly lower hood line, rounding the front fenders, bumper, and grille. The light-duty F-Series received a driver-side airbag starting in the 1994 model year.

After a six-year hiatus, the Flareside bed made its return, becoming a sub-model of the F-150. To appeal to younger buyers, the bodywork of the Flareside bed was modernized, adapting the fenders of the dual-rear-wheel F-350 to a single-rear-wheel chassis. Also unlike previously, dual tanks became available on Flareside models, but only on 2WD models, and the Flareside bed was available with the SuperCab in addition to the regular cab.

To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the first Ford factory-produced truck (the 1917 Ford Model TT), Ford offered a 75th-anniversary package on its 1992 F-Series, consisting of a stripe package, an argent-colored step bumper, and special 75th-anniversary logos. In response to the Chevrolet 454SS pickup truck, Ford introduced the SVT Lightning, powered by a 240 hp 5.8L V8.

For 1993, a turbocharger became available on the 7.3L &quot;IDI&quot; diesel. In the middle of the 1994 model year (referred to as &quot;1994.5&quot;), International replaced the IDI with the new 7.3L T444E turbo diesel, the first engine branded as a Ford Power Stroke. While sharing its predecessor&#x27;s displacement, the engine was an entirely new design.

For the 1997 model year, the ninth generation was gradually phased out of production; the F-150 was replaced by the tenth-generation F-Series (see below), with the F-250 (rebranded as the F-250 Heavy Duty) and F-350 remaining in production through the 1997 model year. Introduced in mid-1998 (as 1999 models), the larger F-Series trucks (and the F-Super Duty) were replaced by the Ford Super Duty line of pickups and chassis-cabs.

== Tenth generation (1997–2004) ==

For the 1997 model year, Ford made a substantial change to the F-Series range of trucks, splitting its pickup line into two vehicle families. From the 1970s to the 1990s, pickup trucks had transitioned in usage. Alongside vehicles designed exclusively for work use, the market segment saw a major increase in demand for dual-purpose vehicles for both work and personal use, effectively serving as a second car. To further expand its growing market share, Ford sought to develop vehicles for both types of buyers, repackaging the F-150 in a more contemporary design (as a larger version of the Ranger) while retaining the heavier-duty F-250 and F-350 for customers interested in a work-use vehicle.

The tenth-generation F-Series was introduced on January 25, 1996 as a 1997 model. Initially released solely as the F-150, a higher-GVWR F-250 was released in 1997. The model line was marketed alongside its predecessor, pared down to the F-250HD and F-350; for 1999, these were replaced by the Super Duty trucks.

In the most extensive redesign of the F-Series in 17 years, the chassis received fully independent front suspension, ending the use of Twin-I-Beam front axles. Sharing only the transmissions with its predecessor, the 1997 F-150 received a range of engines new to the F-Series, including a 4.2L V6 and 4.6L V8; a 5.4L V8 was added during 1997. Introduced in the full-sized Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis/Town Car sedans, the Modular/Triton V8 was the first overhead-camshaft engine to be installed in a full-size pickup truck.

Distinguished by its rounded exterior, the tenth generation was again offered in standard- and extended-cab (SuperCab) configurations. To improve rear-seat access, a rear-hinged third door (curbside) was introduced for the SuperCab; following its popularity, the SuperCab received a fourth door for 1999. For 2001, the F-150 became the first &quot;-ton&quot; truck offered as a crew cab with full-sized doors; produced with a slightly shortened bed, the F-150 SuperCrew shared the length of a standard-bed SuperCab.

The SVT Lightning made its return for 1999, powered by a supercharged version of the 5.4L V8; over 28,000 were produced from 1999 to 2004. For 2002, Lincoln-Mercury introduced the Lincoln Blackwood, the first Lincoln pickup. Sharing the front bodywork of the Lincoln Navigator SUV and the same cab and chassis as the F-150 SuperCrew, the Blackwood was designed with a model-exclusive bed and was sold only in black. Due to very poor sales, the model line was discontinued after 2002.

For 1999, Ford redesigned the F-250 and F-350, introducing them as the first generation of the Ford F-Series Super Duty model line. While remaining part of the F-Series, the Super Duty trucks were designed with a different chassis, powertrain, and body design, as they are developed for heavier-duty work use. For 2000, the Super Duty line was expanded to include the medium-duty truck (F-650/F-750) series, designed in a joint venture with Navistar International.

== Eleventh generation (2004–2008) ==

For the 2004 model year, the F-150 was redesigned on an all-new platform, which has a fully boxed-in frame and introduced rear shocks to mount outside of the frame for decreased wheel hop and improved ride quality. This new body style kept the fully independent front suspension introduced in the last generation, but added vacuum-driven front wheel hubs for the four-wheel drive (4WD) versions. The previous generation had full-time connected front axles. The improvement saves fuel and by default goes into a wheel-locked position. Should a failure occur in the vacuum solenoid, system, or hoses, the wheel hub defaults to a 4WD position to keep from leaving a driver stranded. Internally, a three-valve version of the 5.4L V8 was introduced and replaced the previous two-valve version. Externally, the 11th-generation model was different from its predecessor, with sharper-edged styling; a major change was the adoption of the stepped driver&#x27;s window from the Super Duty trucks. Regardless of cab type, all F-150s were given four doors, with the rear doors on the regular cab providing access to behind-the-seat storage. Ford also introduced additional variants of the F-150. The FX4 Off-Road package available since the 2002 model year became its own trim level. A sportier version of the F-150 became available as STX, replaced by FX2 Sport in 2007.

From 2005 to 2008, Lincoln-Mercury dealers sold this version of the F-150 as the Lincoln Mark LT, replacing the Blackwood.

In late 2007 for the 2008 model year, the Super Duty trucks were given an all-new platform. While using the same bed and cabin as before, these are distinguished from their predecessors by an all-new interior and a much larger grille and headlamps. Previously available only as a chassis-cab model, the F-450 now was available as a pickup directly from Ford.

== Twelfth generation (2009–2014) ==

The twelfth-generation F-150 was introduced for the 2009 model year as an update of the Ford full-size truck platform. Similar to its predecessor, these trucks are distinguished by their Super Duty–style grilles (adding a third horizontal bar) and Edge/Expedition-style headlights. Regular Cab models now have two doors again instead of four from the last generation. The manual transmission was dropped for the first time, and the Flareside bed was continued until the end of 2009 (thus making it the very last factory stepside-style pickup truck to date). Outside of Mexico, the Lincoln Mark LT was replaced by the F-150 Platinum. A new model for 2010 included the SVT Raptor, a dedicated off-road model. Initially only available in a SuperCab configuration, a SuperCrew was added for 2011.

Also for 2010, Ford shifted its electronics from a general electric module base to the computerized and programmable body control module, allowing for fewer parts differences and programmable upgrade options from the dealer or factory.

As part of a major focus on fuel economy, the entire engine lineup for the F-150 was updated for the 2011 model year. Ford reintroduced the 5.0L V8 in the F-Series with its new &quot;Coyote&quot; dual overhead cam TiVVT engine producing up to 360 hp. The F-150 also gained a new 3.7L base V6 engine, and a powerful twin-turbocharged 3.5L V6, dubbed EcoBoost. A six-speed automatic transmission became the only version. Other modifications include the addition of a Nexteer Automotive electric power steering system on most models.

A recent study conducted by iSeeCars.com and published on the Ford Motor Company website listed the Ford F-250 Super Duty as the longest-lasting vehicle and Expedition, Explorer, and F-150 among the top-20 longest-lasting vehicles.

== Thirteenth generation (2015–2020) ==

Ford introduced the 13th-generation F-Series for model year 2015. Previewed by the Ford Atlas concept vehicle at the 2013 Detroit Auto Show, the new design was noted for its extensive use of aluminum to reduce curb weight by nearly 750 pounds without reducing its exterior footprint. Aluminum body stampings replaced steel with the exception of the firewall. The frame itself remained high-strength steel. To test the durability of the aluminum-intensive design during development, Ford entered camouflaged prototypes into the Baja 1000 endurance race, where the vehicles finished.

The 2015 F-150 was the first pickup truck with adaptive cruise control, using radar sensors on the front of the vehicle to maintain a set following distance from the vehicle ahead, decreasing speed if necessary.

The 3.7L V6 was dropped, replaced by a naturally-aspirated 3.5L V6 as the standard engine, with a 2.7L EcoBoost V6 added alongside the 3.5L EcoBoost V6. While the 6.2L V8 was withdrawn, the 5.0L V8 continued as an option, with a six-speed automatic as the sole transmission.

For the 2017 model year, Ford debuted the second-generation 3.5L EcoBoost along with the new 10-speed 10R80 transmission. The naturally-aspirated 3.5L V6, 2.7L EcoBoost, and 5.0L Coyote remained the same and both continued to be mated with the 6-speed 6R80 transmission. Following the introduction of the 2017 Super Duty model line, the F-Series (F-150 through F-550 and Ford Raptor) were again manufactured using a common cab, for the first time since 1996.

For the 2018 model year, the F-150 received a mid-cycle redesign, revealed at the 2017 New York International Auto Show. The three-bar grille design was changed to a two-bar design that debuted on the 2017 Super Duty model line. The naturally-aspirated 3.5L V6 was replaced by a 3.3L V6 mated to a six-speed transmission. The 2.7L EcoBoost V6 and 5.0L V8 engines were fitted with a 10-speed automatic (from the Raptor) and stop-start capability (previously only from the 2.7L EcoBoost). In 2018, a Power Stroke diesel engine was fitted to the F-150 for the first time, as Ford introduced a 250 hp/440 lb-ft torque 3.0L turbocharged V6 (from the &quot;Lion&quot; lineup of engines shared by PSA Peugeot Citroën and Jaguar Land Rover). Also new for 2018 was &quot;Pre-Collision Assist with Pedestrian Detection&quot; and &quot;Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop and Go&quot;.

The SuperCrew version of the 2018 F-150 received a IIHS Top Safety Pick rating.

==Fourteenth generation (2021–present)==
The 14th-generation Ford F-Series was introduced for MY 2021 through a streamed Internet presentation on June 25, 2020. Despite resembling the 13th generation, every exterior panel was revised.Powertrains include a 3.3L V6, 2.7L and 3.5L EcoBoost twin-turbo V6s, a 5.0L V8, and a 3.0L diesel V6. Marketed as &quot;PowerBoost&quot;, an optional gasoline/electric hybrid powertrain has been offered, pairing an electric motor with the 3.5L EcoBoost V6. The six-speed automatic has now been dropped, with all engines paired to a 10-speed automatic. The 5.0L V8 has received a cylinder deactivation system, marketed as &quot;Variable Displacement Engine&quot; technology, similar to GM&#x27;s Active Fuel Management and Chrysler&#x27;s Multi-Displacement System.

Along with exterior aerodynamic refinements, interior revisions included fold-flat front seats and larger touchscreens (including a digital instrument panel); as an option, Active Drive Assist was offered as a driver-assistance system.

A new F-150 Raptor was announced in January 2021, with a high-output version of the 3.5L V6 EcoBoost engine.

A fully electric version of the F-150 was unveiled on May 19, 2021, marketed as the Ford F-150 Lightning.

For the 2024 model year, the F-150 received a mid-cycle refresh, with revised grilles, taillights, and headlights. Now standard on all models are the LCD-based instrument cluster, 12&quot; touch-screen infotainment system, and LED headlights. Among the mechanical changes are the 3.3L V6 and SuperCab with 8&#x27; bed being withdrawn from the lineup, as well as four-wheel drive being standard on Lariat and above trims, SuperCrew with 6.5&#x27; bed, and PowerBoost models. The Limited trim becomes the &quot;Platinum Plus&quot; package for the Platinum trim.
== Special models ==

Throughout its production, variants of the Ford F-Series has been produced to attract buyers. While these variants primarily consist of trim packages, others are high-performance versions while other variants were designed with various means of improving functionality.

=== Unibody F-Series (1961–1962) ===
For 1961 into part of the 1963 model year, the Ford F-Series was offered with a third body configuration, integrating the Styleside bed with the cab. With the pickup bed stampings welded directly to the cab before both assemblies were mounted to the frame, the design simplified the assembly and paint process (the configuration was similar to that of the Ford Ranchero). Following a poor market reception, the unibody pickup bed design was withdrawn during the 1963 model year.

=== Specials (1962–1979) ===
From 1961 to 1979, Ford offered several &quot;Special&quot; option packages for the F-Series, typically designed for owners with specific uses for their vehicles. For 1961, the &quot;Camper Special&quot; option package was introduced; designed for owners of slide-in truck campers, the option package featured prewiring for the camper, heavy-duty transmission and engine cooling, and a larger alternator. For 1968, Ford introduced the &quot;Contractor&#x27;s Special&quot;, and &quot;Farm and Ranch Special&quot;, which featured toolboxes and heavier-duty suspension. The &quot;Explorer Special&quot; was introduced as a lower-priced variant of the Ranger trim. The &quot;Trailer Special&quot; was offered with trailer brake controller, heavy-duty radiator, transmission cooler, and tow hitch.

In 1980, the Special option packages were withdrawn as part of the F-Series redesign, while a number of features continued as stand-alone options; the Explorer continued as a variant of the Ranger trim through the 1986 model year.

=== F-150 Nite (1991–1992) ===
Sold from 1991 to 1992 on the Ford F-150 XLT Lariat, the Nite special edition was a monochromatic option package, featuring black paint and trim with a multicolor accent stripe. For 1991, it was exclusive to the regular-cab F-150; for 1992, it was available on all body styles of the F-150 and introduced on the Ford Bronco.

The Nite edition was available with two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive with either the 5.0L or 5.8L V8; it also included a sport suspension and alloy wheels on 235/75R15 white-letter tires.

=== Eddie Bauer (1994–1996) ===
For 1994, Ford introduced the Eddie Bauer trim level for the F-150. In a fashion similar to the same trim packages on the Aerostar, Bronco, and Explorer/Bronco II, it consisted of outdoors-themed interior trim with two-tone exterior paint.

=== SVT Lightning ===

==== 1993–1995 ====

Introduced as a 1993 model, the Ford Lightning is a high-performance version of the F-150 that was produced by the Ford Special Vehicle Team (SVT). Intended as a competitor for the Chevrolet 454SS, the Lightning was derived from the F-150; to improve its handling, extensive modifications were made to the front and rear suspension and frame. Powered by a 240 hp version of the 5.8L V8, the Lightning used a heavy-duty 4-speed automatic transmission from the F-350 (normally paired with the 7.5L V8 or 7.3L diesel V8). While slower in acceleration than the GMC Syclone, the Lightning retained nearly all of the towing and payload capacity of a standard Ford F-150. Produced from 1993 to 1995, the first-generation Lightning was withdrawn as Ford readied the 1997 Ford F-150 for sale.

==== 1999–2004 ====

After a three-year hiatus, Ford released a second generation of the SVT Lightning for the 1999 model year. In line with its 1993–1995 predecessor, the second-generation Lightning was based on the F-150 with a number of suspension modifications; in a design change, all examples were produced with a Flareside bed. In place of a model-specific engine, the second-generation was powered by a supercharged version of the 5.4L V8 from the F-150, producing 360 hp (increased to 380 hp in 2001). As before, the higher-output engine was paired with a heavier-duty transmission from the F-350 pickup.

For the 2004 redesign of the Ford F-150, the SVT Lightning was not included, leaving 2004 as the final year for the model line. While of an entirely different design focus from the SVT Lightning, the SVT/Ford Raptor is the succeeding generation of high-performance Ford F-Series pickup trucks.

=== Harley-Davidson Edition (2000–2012) ===
From 2000 to 2012, the Harley-Davidson Edition was an option package available on the F-150. Primarily an appearance package featuring monochromatic black trim, the edition included a slightly detuned version of the supercharged 5.4L V8 engine from the SVT Lightning from 2002 to 2003, and a naturally-aspirated 5.4L from 2004-10. For the 2011 model year, the 5.4L engine was replaced with a naturally-aspirated 6.2L V8. In 2003, a 100th Anniversary Edition was produced for F-150 SuperCrew trucks. For 2004, the Harley-Davidson option package became available for F-250/F-350 Super Duty trucks. After 2008, the option package adopted many of the options featured from the Platinum trim level, featuring leather seating produced from materials reserved for Harley-Davidson biker jackets.

For 2013, the Harley-Davidson Edition was replaced by the Limited trim level, retaining a monochromatic exterior appearance (shifting past motorcycle-themed trim).

=== SVT Raptor (2010–2014); Raptor (2017–present) ===

For 2010, the SVT Raptor was introduced as the second F-Series truck upgraded by Ford SVT. In contrast to the enhanced on-road performance of the SVT Lightning, the Raptor features upgraded off-road capability in line with a Baja 1000 desert racing truck (though preserving its status as a road-legal vehicle). Sharing only its cab with the F-150, the Raptor is fitted with a long-travel suspension, larger tires, and a model-exclusive front fascia. For the first time on a Ford vehicle since 1983, the Ford Blue Oval emblem was replaced by FORD lettering.

For the 2015 redesign of the F-Series, the model was placed on a two-year hiatus, with a second-generation Raptor (dropping the SVT prefix) released for 2017 production. Now derived from the thirteenth-generation F-Series, the Raptor adopted an aluminum-intensive body (reducing its weight by over 500 pounds). In another change, the V8 engine of the previous generation was replaced by a twin-turbocharged V6 unit.

The third-generation Raptor was released for 2021 (coinciding with the release of the fourteenth-generation F-Series). The rear suspension switched to coil springs (dropping the previous leaf springs), larger tires added, and the SuperCrew becoming the sole cab configuration. For 2023, a V8 engine returned to the Raptor as an option.

=== F-150 King Ranch (2001–present) ===
In 2001, Ford&#x27;s marketing department leveraged a partnership with the 825,000-acre King Ranch in south Texas, which is the largest ranch in both Texas and the United States and which operates a large fleet of Ford trucks. The truck was emblazoned with the King Ranch&#x27;s &quot;Running W&quot; brand and upholstered in saddle leather. It was the industry&#x27;s first full-size lightweight pickup truck with a full rear passenger compartment and four full-size doors, becoming the SuperCrew cab. Along with the Limited and Platinum, the King Ranch continues to comprise the luxury end of the F-150 spectrum. 40% of King Ranch F-150 sales are in Texas, Ford&#x27;s largest pickup truck market.

=== F-150 Platinum (2009–present) ===
Introduced for 2009, the Platinum is a luxury-oriented trim of the Ford F-150. Effectively replacing the Lincoln Mark LT in the United States and Canada (though its production continued through 2014 in Mexico), the Platinum adopted many of the luxury features and content from the Mark LT with more subdued exterior styling (the Platinum was fitted with an egg-crate grille similar to early models of the Ford Expedition).

In 2013, Ford began use of the Platinum trim for Super Duty trucks, from the F-250 to the F-450 pickup trucks. Until 2016, the Platinum trim was an add-on package to a Super Duty that was ordered as a Lariat. 2017 saw the Platinum become a separate trim level.

=== F-150 Tremor (2014, 2021–present) ===
For the 2014 model year, Ford introduced the Tremor model of the F-150. The Tremor was released as a high-performance sport truck for street truck enthusiasts. The regular-cab Tremor is based on the style of the FX Appearance Package with the 3.5L EcoBoost engine and a 4.10:1 rear axle ratio. The interior uses a console-mounted shifter, custom bucket seats, and a flow-through center console not found in any other F-150. The Tremor is available in both 4×2 and 4×4. Both options feature an electronic-locking rear differential and customized suspension. There were 2,230 Tremors built.

Ford reintroduced the Tremor with the 14th generation F-150 in 2021 as a standalone model, slotted between the FX4 and Raptor, with an updated 3.5L EcoBoost, producing 400 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The Tremor is available only as a SuperCrew model with a 5 1/2-foot bed with three specific trim levels (Base, Mid, and High) that offer updated luxury and convenience items. The updated Tremor features a revised shock and suspension system, unique external styling kit, custom seats, vented hood, powder-coated running boards, and various skid and bash plates. For the 2023 model year, Ford also offered the Tremor with the 5.0L Coyote engine, producing 400 horsepower and 410 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with Ford&#x27;s 10-speed automatic transmission. The trim levels were reduced to Standard and High.

=== Ford F-150 Lightning ===
At the 2019 Detroit Auto Show in January 2019, Ford announced the intention to produce a fully-electric light truck. Prototype test mules on an existing F-150 chassis were tested during 2019, including a record-setting demonstration test tow of on rails.

Ford unveiled the truck, called the F-150 Lightning, on May 19, 2021. It intends to begin production in the spring of 2022. Ford received 44,500 orders in the first two days after the announcement, and a further 25,000 in the next two days after that. The low-end configuration has , range, and its smaller battery allows a payload. The high-end configuration has , 300+ mile capacity, times in the mid-four-second range, and towing capacity of . Both models have of torque, full-time four-wheel-drive, independent rear suspension, and currently come in a crew-cab configuration only, with 5.5&#x27; bed. The active suspension provides real-time load weighing function. Like Tesla, the Ford F-150 Lightning has over-the-air software updates, and a significant software driving aids which allow limited hands-off highway driving, but fall short of full self-driving. The F-150 Lightning provides household-oriented V2G power, which can meet the electrical needs of a typical American home for three to ten days, and supply up to 9.6 kW of power through eleven 120V and 240V electrical outlets distributed around the truck.

As of May 27, 2021, Ford has begun discussing the other vehicles beyond the F-Series, such as the Expedition and Navigator, which will be underpinned by their full-size EV truck chassis, as well as the smaller chassis which will be used for the Bronco, Explorer, and Aviator.

== Variants ==
=== Medium-duty trucks ===
For most of its production, the F-Series was sold in a medium-duty conventional truck configuration alongside the traditional pickup trucks. Beginning in 1948 with the 1 ton F-5 (later F-500), the medium-duty trucks ranged up to the F-8 (F-800). Prior to the 1957 introduction of the Ford C-Series tilt-cab, the medium-duty range was offered as both a conventional and in a COE (cabover) configuration.

Following the introduction of the fifth-generation F-Series in 1967, the medium-duty trucks were designed separately from the pickup truck range. Although remaining part of the F-Series range, the medium-duty trucks shared only the cab and interior with the F-Series pickup trucks. Since 1967, the cab design has changed only in 1980 and in 2000. Redesigned on an all-new chassis, the 2016 F-Series medium-duty trucks retain an updated version of the 2000–2015 F-650/F-750 cab.

The medium-duty F-Series served as the donor platform for the B-Series cowled bus chassis produced from 1948 to 1998. Produced primarily for school bus bodies, the B-Series was discontinued as part of the sale of the Ford heavy-truck line to Freightliner in 1996.

=== Heavy-duty trucks ===
Above its medium-duty truck ranges, the F-Series also served as the basis of its commercial heavy truck lines for four generations. In 1951, Ford debuted the &quot;Big Job&quot; name for its F-7 and F-8 conventional trucks; the latter was optionally fitted with tandem rear axles.

For 1958, the Big Job trucks were replaced by the Extra Heavy Duty line. Coinciding with the debut of the Super Duty V8 engine line, trucks fitted with those engines were denoted as Super Duty trucks.

In 1963, Ford introduced the N-Series short-hood conventional, replacing the F-900 Super Duty/Extra Heavy Duty. The first conventional-hood Ford with a diesel engine, the N-Series sourced its cab from the F-Series, pairing it with a shorter, wider hood and mounting it higher.

Ford introduced the L-Series &quot;Louisville&quot; line of conventional trucks in 1970, ending all F-Series commonality with its heavy commercial trucks. The L-Series/Aeromax remained in production through 1998, coinciding with the sale of the Ford heavy-truck line to Freightliner (who sold the line as Sterling Trucks through 2009). Outside North America, Ford currently markets the Ford Cargo and Ford F-MAX COE trucks.

=== Vans ===

For the first three generations of the F-Series, Ford offered the model line in a panel van configuration, featuring an enclosed body for carrying cargo. In contrast to General Motors, Ford never offered a passenger &quot;carryall&quot; variant of this body (competing against the Chevrolet/GMC Suburban or the International Travelall). For 1961, the panel van was discontinued, following the introduction of the Ford Econoline van.

From 1968 to current production, the Econoline/Club Wagon/E-Series vans have a degree of shared powertrain commonality with F-Series trucks; during the 1970s, some body components were shared. While currently only produced as a cutaway chassis for commercial sale, the E-Series still shares its powertrain with current-generation Ford Super Duty trucks.

=== B-Series Carryall ===
Produced exclusively for Mexican and South American markets, the Ford B-Series Carryall (not to be confused with the Ford B series bus chassis) was a station wagon variant of the F-Series pickup sold from 1963 to 1994. Originally, trading laws had prevented the exportation of the US produced Ford Econoline van to Mexican and South American regions. To solve this issue, Ford decided to use the F-Series chassis (which was already being sold in Mexico and South America) to create a covered van as a substitute for the Econoline not being viable for export. The B-Series Carryall used the chassis, running gear, front fascia and doors of the Ford F-100 (later F-150) pickup, with the van conversion being outsourced to other companies and then sold through Mexican and South American Ford dealerships.

The original model, based on the fourth generation F-100 and sold as the B-100, was available as a two-door panel van or a two-door station wagon with seating for up to 10.

For 1967, the B-100 shifted to the fifth generation F-100 platform and gained the option of a three-door station wagon body style with a rear door exclusively on the right hand side of the vehicle. Versions sold in Argentina were known as the B-150.

For 1973, the B-100 adopted the sixth generation F-100 platform, with specific South American markets also offering a B-250 Carryall, based on the three-quarter ton F-250.

For 1980, the B-100 was renamed the B-150 in all markets and shifted to the seventh generation F-150 chassis.

For 1987, the model was renamed B-200 and shifted to the eighth generation F-150 chassis.

In 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement was established, which allowed for the exportation of the US produced Ford Econoline van to Mexican and South American markets due to more lenient trade laws. This led to the discontinuation of the B-Series Carryall the same year, with it being unofficially replaced by the Econoline.

=== Export ===
As of 2018, outside of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, the Ford F-150 is officially sold in most Caribbean countries (except Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Cuba), Suriname, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, the Middle East (including Afghanistan), Iceland, China, Cambodia, the Philippines, Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, the French Overseas Collectivities of French Polynesia and New Caledonia, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Madagascar, the Dutch territories of Aruba, Curaçao, Saint Maarten, and the British overseas territory of the Cayman Islands. The SVT Raptor is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Middle East (including Afghanistan), China, Ecuador, Chile, and Peru. Both are available in LHD only.

In Mexico, the F-150 (XLT and higher trim levels) is called the &quot;Ford Lobo&quot; (Ford Wolf) while the F-150 SVT Raptor is called the &quot;Ford Lobo Raptor.&quot; The F-150 XL remains as F-150 XL.

There is a strong grey market presence of Ford F-Series trucks around the world, most notably in Europe, China, and South Korea, and usually driven by wealthy car enthusiasts, as the higher-end trim models are the most sought-after versions. In Australia, they are popular with those wanting to tow heavier trailers and caravans.

In Bolivia, Ford F-series truck are imported from the United States. F-150 single, super cab and crew cab are available with short and long bed. F-series Heavy Duty like F-250, F-350 are available in Super Cab and Crew cab with long bed, but the F-450 is available only in a chassis version. The F-150 Raptor is available, too.

In the United Kingdom, most imported Ford F-Series trucks are the F-150 model in LHD, and usually the higher-end four door versions.

== Motorsports ==

The truck won the San Felipe 250 eight times between 1999 and 2007.

The F-Series represents Ford in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. Greg Biffle won the 2000 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series Championship, being the only Ford driver to do so. Ford also won the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship in 1999 and 2000.

Drivers such as Roger Norman and Larry Roeseler won the Primm 300 in 2003, 2007, and 2008.

In 2008, Ford announced its entrance into the Baja 1000 class-eight race for moderately modified, full-size pickups. The driver of record was Steve Oligos, supported by co-drivers Randy Merritt, Greg Foutz, and Bud Brutsman. The vehicle was built with collaboration between the Ford Special Vehicle Team (SVT), Ford Racing, and Foutz Motorsports, Inc. The Ford F-150 SVT Raptor R completed the 2008 41st Tecate SCORE Baja 1000 race in 25.28:10, and ranked third in its class. Tavo Vildosola and Gus Vildosola won the event in 2010.

In the Best in the Desert race series, an F-150 SVT Raptor R completed the &quot;Terrible&#x27;s 250&quot; race, placing second overall in the class 8000.

In January 2010, a single Raptor SVT (No. 439), driven by Chilean driver Javier Campillay, competed in the Argentina–Chile Dakar Rally. However, the pickup was unable to finish because of a catch-up crash with another car in the middle of the road during stage seven. In January 2011, two Raptors started in the Argentina–Chile Dakar Rally in Buenos Aires, with Campillay driving the more reliable Raptor (No. 375), and American female driver Sue Mead driving a T2 Raptor (No. 374). Mead crossed the finish line in Buenos Aires and won the &quot;super production&quot; class, the first North American class win in Dakar history. Campillay was unable to finish the 12th stage after losing time because of mechanical failure during the 11th stage, which led to his disqualification for failing to reach the race camp by the designated deadline.

==Police usage==

Ford F-150s are commonly used as police trucks. They are primarily used to patrol off-road areas such as mountains, forests, flooded areas, shorelines, and beaches, where a standard police car has difficulty maneuvering. In addition, they are often used for transporting SWAT teams, and can even have facilities to securely detain and transport a small number of suspects. Other common police uses include equipping the truck with cages for animal control or using them to transport mounted units or police boats.

== Awards and recognition ==
The Ford F-150 has won numerous awards; in 2009 alone, it received:
*&quot;Motor Trend&quot; 2009 Truck of the Year Award
* 2009 Best Redesigned Vehicle from Kelley Blue Book&#x27;s kbb.com

<doc id="895413" wikidata="Q545311" url="?curid=895413" title="Cadillac XLR">
<text>The Cadillac XLR is a two-passenger roadster manufactured and marketed by Cadillac from 2003 to 2009 across a single generation. It was noted for its power retractable hardtop, Bulgari designed interior instruments, head-up display, adaptive suspension, rear-mounted transmission and near 50/50 front-to-rear weight distribution. The XLR was introduced at the 2003 North American International Auto Show as a halo model for Cadillac, and began production for the 2004 model year. The design was inspired by the 1999 Evoq concept.

The Cadillac XLR, although sometimes thought of as a badge-engineered variant of the C6 Chevrolet Corvette, also manufactured at GM&#x27;s Bowling Green assembly, actually made its debut a year ahead of it. While the two share the GM Y platform, hydroformed perimeter frame, and composite bodywork construction technology, each has distinct engines, bodies, interiors, and suspension settings, with the XLR also featuring a unique power retractable hardtop.

The XLR was the first production Cadillac with radar-based adaptive cruise control (ACC) and the first to offer both heated and cooled seats.

The XLR was nominated for the &quot;North American Car of the Year&quot; award for 2004.

==Design==
The XLR was marketed as a luxury roadster and offered numerous features either as standard equipment or as options, including a touchscreen GPS navigation radio with an AM/FM radio, CD changer, XM Satellite Radio, full voice control, Bose premium amplified audio system, adaptive cruise control, Bulgari-branded instrument panel cluster, OnStar, High Intensity Discharge (HID) front headlamps, perforated luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces with power-adjustable, heated and cooled bucket seats with a driver&#x27;s memory system, luxury carpeted floor mats with embroidered &#x27;XLR&#x27; logos, premium aluminum-alloy wheels, and wood interior trim.

The XLR featured adaptive suspension with magneto-rheological shock absorber fluid for enhanced ride control. The system, marketed as &quot;Magnetic Ride Control&quot;, used four wheel-to-body displacement sensors to measure wheel motion over the road surface and responds by adjusting the shock damping almost instantly. The shock absorbers were filled with a fluid containing suspended iron particles responsive to magnetic signals. The system constantly monitored motion and changed the damping forces at all four corners of the vehicle — to modulate body motion for quick maneuvers or uneven road surfaces.

Whereas the Chevrolet Corvette (C6) was powered by a 6.0 L GM LS2 V8 engine and offered with a six-speed manual transmission, the XLR featured Cadillac&#x27;s 4.6 L Northstar V8 (supercharged in the XLR-V) and either a five-speed 5L50 automatic transmission, or a six-speed 6L80 automatic transmission. It produced and of torque in the standard trim. Optional XLR equipment included polished aluminum-alloy wheels, exterior and interior color options, and different interior trim options.

The XLR featured the traditional Cadillac, silver-painted upper &quot;Egg Crate&quot; (XLR) or chrome wire mesh (XLR-V) front grille.

For the 2009 model year, the XLR added a new front fascia, new rear fascia, and chrome side fender vents. Inside, Alcantara - a suede-like microfiber material - was added for the headliner. The interior added new instrument cluster trim rings with revised graphics, (removal of the Bulgari logo) and new wood dashboard trims. XLR production ended on March 31, 2009.

The base price of the XLR in the United States went from $75,385 ($ in dollars) at launch to $86,215 ($ in dollars) by the end of its run in 2009.

==XLR-V==

The Cadillac XLR-V is a high-performance variant of the XLR and part of the first-generation V-Series. Cadillac gave the public its first glimpse of the supercharged XLR-V in its Super Bowl commercial, which aired February 6, 2005. Super Bowl MVP Deion Branch was also awarded an XLR. The car was formally introduced at the 2005 New York International Auto Show.

The XLR-V used the same supercharged &quot;Northstar LC3&quot; V8 as the STS-V, although output was reduced somewhat. For the XLR-V, the engine produced and . The supercharger and four intercooler cores were built into the intake manifold. A six-speed automatic transmission, larger brakes from the Z51 Corvette, and 19-inch wheels were used.

The XLR-V could accelerate to in 4.6 seconds according to &quot;Car and Driver&quot;&#x27;s tests. The magazine also timed it at 11.3 seconds to and recorded a 13.0 second quarter mile at . Its top speed was electronically limited to .

The base price of the XLR-V in the United States went from $97,485 ($ in dollars) at launch to $104,215 ($ in dollars) by the end of its run in 2009.

<doc id="895415" wikidata="Q1978560" url="?curid=895415" title="Perennial candidate">
<text>A perennial candidate is a political candidate who frequently runs for elected office and rarely, if ever, wins. Perennial candidates are most common where there is no limit on the number of times that a person can run for office and little cost to register as a candidate.

==Definition==
A number of modern articles related to electoral politics or elections have identified those who have run for elected office and lost two to three times, and then decide to mount a campaign again as perennial candidates. However, some articles have listed a number of notable exceptions.

Some who have had their campaign applications rejected by their country&#x27;s electoral authority multiple times have also been labelled as perennial candidates.

==Reason for running==
It has been noted that some perennial candidates take part in an election with the aim of winning, and some do have ideas to convey on the campaign trail, regardless of their chance for winning. Others have names similar to known candidates, and hope that the confusion will lead to success.

Some perennial candidates may mount a run as a way to help strengthen their party&#x27;s standing in a parliamentary body, in an effort to become kingmaker in the event of a political stalemate.

Some perennial candidates have been accused of running for office continuously as a way to get public election funding. Some have also been accused of being backed by the government of their country, in an effort to make the government appear more rational in comparison.

Novelty candidates are those who run for office as a form of satire or protest, with no serious policies.

==Americas==
===Argentina===
*Jorge Altamira, leader of the Trotskyist Workers&#x27; Party, has run for President five times (1989, 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2011). His best performance was in 2011, with 2.30% of the votes.
* Nicolás del Caño, leader of the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party has run for political positions five times (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021). His best performance was in 2019, with 2.16% of the votes.

===Bolivia===
*Samuel Doria Medina, leader of National Unity Front, has run for President in 2005, 2009, and 2014 elections with best performance in 2014, with 25.1% of votes.

===Brazil===
Due to the complex and intricate political system in Brazil concerning political parties, there are more than 30 political parties. In this scenario, it is very useful to have hopeless candidates who can make a good number of votes and increase the overall votes count of a party (or coalition). As a consequence, there are thousands of small perennial candidates for local elections around the country, whose sole purpose is helping others get elected, then ask for a job in the elected government cabinet.

*José Maria Eymael, a fringe political figure, ran for the Presidency six times (1998, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022); he failed to reach 1% of the votes in any of those. He also unsuccessfully ran for mayor of São Paulo in 1985 and 1992, though he won two terms on the lower house of the National Congress of Brazil, from 1987 to 1995.
*Rui Costa Pimenta, leader and founder of the Trotskyist Workers&#x27; Cause Party (PCO), ran for the Presidency in 2002, 2010 and 2014 (his candidacy in 2006 was blocked by the Superior Electoral Court). He was last in all his runs, with his best performance being 0.04% of the votes in 2002.
* Vera Guasso, labor union leader and member of the Unified Socialist Workers Party (PSTU), ran for the Porto Alegre city assembly, mayor of Porto Alegre, the Brazilian Senate and other positions in a non-stop serial candidacy (every two years) from the early 90s on. In her best results, she had numbers of votes in local Porto Alegre elections similar to those of lesser-voted elected candidates but did not get a seat due to her party&#x27;s overall voting being small. PSTU traditionally enters elections with no visible chance to, allegedly, &quot;put a leftist set of points in discussion&quot; and &quot;build the party&quot; but has lately achieved some expressive numbers.
*Enéas Carneiro, a cardiologist and founder of the far-right Party of the Reconstruction of the National Order (PRONA), ran for presidency three times, in 1989, 1994 and 1998. He was mostly known for his comical style of speech on political broadcasts (due in part to the reduced TV time his party had) and his distinct beard. He also ran for mayor in São Paulo at the 2000 elections, before finally being elected federal deputy in 2002 with record voting. He was re-elected in 2006 but died in 2007 from myeloid leukemia.
*José Maria de Almeida, leader of the Trotskyist United Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSTU), ran for the Presidency on four occasions: 1998, 2002, 2010 and 2014. His best performance was in 2002 when he got 0.47% of the votes.
*Levy Fidelix, leader and founder of the conservative Brazilian Labour Renewal Party (PRTB), ran for all municipal and general elections held in Brazil from 1996 to 2020. He was twice candidate for the Presidency (in 2010 and 2014), twice candidate for the Governor of São Paulo (in 1998 and 2002) and five times candidate for the Mayor of São Paulo (in 1996, 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020), never being elected for any position in his political career. He succumbed to COVID-19 on April 23, 2021.

* Michael Baldasaro (1949–2016), a leader of the pro-marijuana Church of the Universe, ran for Mayor of Hamilton, Ontario in 1988, 1991, 1994, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2010, and 2014 and, among other federal and provincial campaigns, attempted to seek the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 1988.

He lost the 1995 Winnipeg Civic election and lost the 2004 and 2006 federal elections in Kildonan—St. Paul, then ran and lost in Winnipeg South in 2011. He ran in Winnipeg South again in 2015, this time winning the seat with 58% of the vote. He was re-elected for Winnipeg South in 2019 with 42% of the vote.

<text>Canadian studies is an interdisciplinary field of undergraduate- and postgraduate-level study of Canadian culture and society, the languages of Canada, Canadian literature, media and communications, Quebec, Acadians, agriculture in Canada, natural resources and geography of Canada, the history of Canada and historiography of Canada, Canadian government and politics, and legal traditions. Similar ranges of subjects centred on indigenous peoples in Canada (First Nations, Inuit, Métis) may be part of Indigenous (Native) studies, Canadian studies or both.

Several universities that offer Canadian studies undergraduate degrees recommend that students take a double major (e.g. political science, international relations or French), if not included in the course. Some careers for students who take Canadian studies include the foreign service and working at Canadian embassies or the foreign embassies in Canada.

Scholars known for their work in Canadian studies include Fernand Ouellet, Linda Hutcheon, George Ramsay Cook, William T. R. Fox, Annette Baker Fox, Susan Swan, Christl Verduyn, Sergey Rogov, and George Melnyk. The Governor General&#x27;s International Award for Canadian Studies is an award for excellence in the field and was established in 1995 by the International Council for Canadian Studies. The International Council for Canadian Studies is a confederal academic society including the Canadian Studies Network which is based in Canada, and Canadian studies associations in numerous other countries. The Association for Canadian Studies aims to connect Canadian studies scholarship with the Canadian public.

<text>The Second Servile War was an unsuccessful slave uprising against the Roman Republic on the island of Sicily. The war lasted from 104 BC until 100 BC. It was one of three Servile Wars, spaced approximately 30 years apart.

==Background==
The consul Gaius Marius was recruiting soldiers for the war against the Cimbri and Teutones in the North. He requested support from King Nicomedes III of Bithynia near the Roman province of Asia; but Nicomedes refused, on the grounds that every able-bodied man in Bithynia had been enslaved by Roman tax-gatherers for being unable to pay their dues. The Senate replied by issuing orders that no slaves were to be taken from among allies of Rome, and that all such slaves should be immediately freed.

The propraetor Publius Licinius Nerva, in obedience to the edict, at once freed (that is, manumitted) around 800 slaves in his province of Sicily. Aside from awakening discontent among slaves from other nationalities who were not freed, this had the effect of alienating the Sicilian plantation owners who saw their human chattels unceremoniously being taken out of their hands. Alarmed, Nerva revoked the manumission, which provoked the slave population into revolt.

==Salvius Tryphon==
Nerva failed to react decisively; by false promises he was able to return one body of the rebels to slavery, while neglecting to address a more serious outbreak near Heraclea. Eventually, Nerva dispatched a detachment of 600 soldiers to take care of the rebels near Heraclea but they were beaten and slaughtered; the slaves now gained confidence, having won a large supply of armaments and a strong leader, a former slave called Salvius. Taking the previous slave-leader Eunus for his example, who had proclaimed himself an Antiochus of the Seleucid line, he assumed the name Tryphon, from Diodotus Tryphon, a Seleucid ruler.

After his victory, Salvius besieged the city of Morgantina. Nerva now marched against him with Sicily&#x27;s militia but he was also defeated. The slaves then managed to take the city. After Morgantina, Salvius&#x27; slave army swelled to 2,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot. Meanwhile, another revolt had broken out in western Sicily; there Athenion, a Cilician slave with a career analogous to Cleon&#x27;s, rose in revolt. He marched his slave army to join with Salvius upon hearing about the victory at Morgantina.

==Lucullus==
In 103 BC the Senate sent the praetor Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who had just put down a revolt in Campania (the Vettian Revolt), to quell the rebellion. Lucullus, at the head of a 17,000 strong Roman and allied army, landed in western Sicily and marched on the rebel stronghold of Triocala.

===Battle of Scirthaea===
When Salvius Tryphon, the Slave King, heard of Lucullus‘ arrival he wanted to hold out against the Romans inside Triocala. His general Athenion, however, persuaded him not to hide but instead face the Romans in open battle. Marching to meet Lucullus, the rebels encamped at Scirthaea, twelve miles distant from the Roman camp and, the next day, the two sides lined up for battle. According to Diodorus, Tryphon&#x27;s host numbered around 40,000.

After much skirmishing, the main battle began as the two armies closed the gap and came together. At first it seemed as if the rebels would drive the Romans back, with Athenion and his cavalry inflicting heavy losses upon Lucullus‘ flanks. However, just as it seemed that the slaves might be victorious, Athenion was wounded and fell from his horse. He was forced to feign death in order to save himself. The rebels, believing their general to be dead, lost heart and fled. Salvius Tryphon, seeing his army routed, turned and joined them in flight back to Triocala. Later that night, under cover of darkness, the wounded Athenion escaped the battlefield. With thousands of slaves cut down in the rout, Diodorus estimates that, as night fell, around 20,000 rebels lay dead, half of Tryphon&#x27;s army.

===Siege of Triocala===
After the battle, Lucullus slowly but surely worked his way to Triocala, restoring Roman Rule while he marched. At Triocala the rebels had dug in; Lucullus started a siege while waiting for his command to be extended, but when he heard that he had been replaced he spitefully ended the siege, burned his siegeworks, camp and provisions, retreated and disbanded his army. Lucullus did this to render the task harder for his successor, Gaius Servilius the Augur; Lucullus intended, by ensuring the failure of his successor, to prove his own innocence from any alleged incompetence.

=== Other ===
According to &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; (early 3rd-century AD), referring to Posidonius, making mention of large slave revolt happened in Mines of Laurion around the times of the second servile war in Sicily.

==Athenion==
In 102 BC Athenion, who had succeeded as slave-king after Salvius&#x27; death (he had passed after the earlier battle) was able to take Gaius Servilius&#x27;s camp by surprise; Servilius&#x27; army was routed and dispersed, undoing all of Lucullus&#x27; previous success.

==Revolt suppressed==
Finally, in 101 BC, the Roman consul Manius Aquillius was given the command against the insurgents in Sicily. The Senior Consul, Gaius Marius, donated several cohorts from his army in Gaul to Aquillius. With these and the troops he recruited, equipped and trained en route he succeeded in defeating Athenion&#x27;s slave army upon arrival. He supposedly killed Athenion by his own hand. The revolt was quelled, and 1,000 slaves who surrendered were sent to fight against beasts in the arena back at Rome for the amusement of the populace. To spite the Romans, they refused to fight and killed each other quietly with their swords, until the last flung himself on his own blade. It was the second of a series of three slave revolts in the Roman Republic fueled by the same abuses in Sicily and Southern Italy.

== Second Servile War in literature ==
* F. L. Lucas&#x27;s short story &quot;The Boar&quot; (&quot;Athenaeum&quot;, 10 September 1920 ) is set in Sicily in the aftermath of the Slave War.
*In Steven Saylor’s novel Arms of Nemesis (the second book in his Roma Sub Rosa series) the Second Slave War (Servile War) is mentioned in detail during a dinner party with Marcus Licinius Crassus who is about to campaign against the rebel slaves of Spartacus in the Third Slave War.
*In Colleen McCullough‘s novel The First Man in Rome (the first book in her Masters of Rome series) the Second Servile War is mentioned several times. It figures as the background for the story line about Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.

<doc id="895423" wikidata="Q3296949" url="?curid=895423" title="Ramiro Mendoza">
<text>Ramiro Mendoza (born June 15, 1972), nicknamed &quot;El Brujo&quot; (The Witch Doctor), is a former Major League Baseball pitcher. Mendoza played with the New York Yankees (1996–2002, 2005) and Boston Red Sox (2003–04). He batted and threw right-handed. Although Mendoza made 62 starts in his major league career, he was primarily known as a middle relief pitcher. He threw a sinker along with a slider, a four-seam fastball and a changeup. In Mendoza&#x27;s ten seasons in the Major Leagues he was a part of five World Series champion teams.

==Major league career (1996–2005)==
In a nine-year career, Mendoza compiled a 59–40 record with 463 strikeouts and a 4.30 earned run average in 797 innings pitched.

===New York Yankees (1996–2002)===
Mendoza made his major league debut in 1996, going 4–5 with a 6.79 ERA in his rookie season. He did not appear on the postseason roster. In 1997, Mendoza went 8–6 with a 4.24 ERA, while starting 15 games, as both a starter and a reliever. He also appeared in his first two postseason games in 1997, going 1–1 with an ERA of 2.45 while throwing innings, a sharp increase from the 53 he pitched in 1996.

1998 was statistically Mendoza&#x27;s best season, as he went 10–2 with an ERA of 3.25, both career bests. In the postseason, he pitched scoreless innings against the Cleveland Indians over two games of the American League Championship Series. In the 1998 World Series against the San Diego Padres, Mendoza pitched one inning of two hit, one run, one strikeout ball in Game 3. He earned his second World Series ring when the Yankees swept the Padres.

The following year, Mendoza struggled to a 9–9 record with an ERA of 4.29 in innings pitched. That year, he started only six games and was quickly moved to the bullpen. He gave up 68 runs that year, a career worst, and was left off of the roster for the 1999 American League Division Series. He rejoined the team for the Championship Series, where he pitched innings and pickup up a save. In the World Series, he pitched innings of relief and surrendered 3 hits and 2 runs, all earned, however, he still earned the win as the Yankees went on to sweep the Braves, 4–0.

Mendoza&#x27;s performance improved slightly in 2000 as he went 7–4 with a 4.25 ERA in innings pitched, including his first complete game since 1998, and last of his career. Despite his improved performance, he was left off of the postseason roster. The following year, he was 8–4 with a 3.75 ERA, and returned to the postseason. In the 2001 American League Division Series, he pitched in relief during three games and allowed only two hits with no runs allowed. In the Championship Series, he appeared in relief during three games and allowed one home run, (his only earned run in that series), pitching innings to a 1.69 ERA. In the 2001 World Series, he pitched innings of 1-hit ball as the Yankees fell to the Diamondbacks in seven games. In 2002, Mendoza pitched in 62 games to an identical 8–4 record with a slightly better ERA of 3.44. He pitched innings in the 2002 American League Division Series against the Angels, surrendering only two earned runs as the Yankees were defeated three games to one. On October 28, 2002, his contract with the Yankees expired and he became a free agent. An unnamed source from the Yankees said that they were concerned about his work habits and conditioning. He was on the disabled list each of the past three seasons.

===Boston Red Sox (2003–2004)===
On December 30, 2002, Mendoza signed a two-year contract with the Boston Red Sox. On July 24, 2004, Mendoza pitched two hitless innings to pick up the win against his former team, the Yankees. The Red Sox were trailing 10–8 at the time, before winning the game, 11–10, in the bottom of the ninth.

Mendoza won another World Series ring with the Red Sox in 2004. He was included on the Red Sox roster in the 2004 American League Championship Series and made 2 appearances, getting tagged with the loss in Game 3.

===Return to the Yankees (2005)===
After recovering from shoulder surgery during the 2005 offseason, Mendoza returned to the Yankees after September 2005 callups, becoming one of three members of the 2004 Red Sox to play for the 2005 Yankees, along with Mark Bellhorn and Alan Embree. Mendoza&#x27;s stint with the 2005 Yankees was limited to one inning, in which he gave up two hits, 2 earned runs, and recorded one strikeout. After the 2005 season, Mendoza signed a minor league contract with the Yankees.

==Later career (2006–2009)==

He played for Panama in the 2006, 2009, and 2013 World Baseball Classics.

In February , he signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers and received an invitation to spring training, but departed spring training after failing a physical.

Following his release, he subsequently retired from major league baseball. He played for a season with the Newark Bears of the independent Atlantic League in 2009.

<text>The Third Servile War, also called the Gladiator War and the War of Spartacus by Plutarch, was the last in a series of slave rebellions against the Roman Republic known as the Servile Wars. This third rebellion was the only one that directly threatened the Roman heartland of Italy. It was particularly alarming to Rome because its military seemed powerless to suppress it.

The revolt began in 73 BC, with the escape of around 70 slave gladiators from a gladiator school in Capua. They easily defeated the small Roman force sent to recapture them, and within two years, they had been joined by some 120,000 men, women, and children. The able-bodied adults of this large group were a surprisingly effective armed force that repeatedly showed they could withstand or defeat the Roman military, from the local Campanian patrols to the Roman militia and even to trained Roman legions under consular command. This army of slaves roamed across Italy, raiding estates and towns with relative impunity, sometimes dividing into separate but connected bands with several leaders, including the famous former gladiator Spartacus.

The Roman Senate grew increasingly alarmed at the slave-army&#x27;s depredations and continued military successes. Eventually Rome fielded an army of eight legions under the harsh but effective leadership of Marcus Licinius Crassus that destroyed the army of slaves in 71 BC. This happened after a long and bitter fighting retreat before the legions of Crassus and after the rebels realized that the legions of Pompey and Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus were moving in to entrap them. The armies of Spartacus launched their full strength against Crassus&#x27;s legions and were utterly defeated. Of the survivors, some 6,000 were crucified along the Appian Way.

Plutarch&#x27;s account of the revolt suggests that the slaves simply wished to escape to freedom and leave Roman territory by way of Cisalpine Gaul. Appian and Florus describe the revolt as a civil war in which the slaves intended to capture the city of Rome. The Third Servile War had significant and far-reaching effects on Rome&#x27;s broader history. Pompey and Crassus exploited their successes to further their political careers, using their public acclaim and the implied threat of their legions to sway the consular elections of 70 BC in their favor. Their actions as consuls greatly furthered the subversion of Roman political institutions and contributed to the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.

== Background ==

To varying degrees throughout Roman history, the existence of a pool of inexpensive labor in the form of slaves was an important factor in the economy. Slaves were acquired for the Roman workforce through a variety of means, including purchase from foreign merchants and the enslavement of foreign populations through military conquest. With Rome&#x27;s heavy involvement in wars of conquest in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, from tens to hundreds of thousands of slaves at a time were imported into the Roman economy from various European and Mediterranean acquisitions. While there was limited use for slaves as servants, craftsmen, and personal attendants, vast numbers of slaves worked in mines and on the agricultural lands of Sicily and southern Italy.

For the most part, slaves were treated harshly and oppressively during the Roman Republic. Under Republican law, a slave was property, not a person. Owners could abuse, injure or even kill their own slaves without legal consequence. While there were many grades and types of slaves, the lowest—and most numerous—grades who worked in the fields and mines were subject to a life of hard physical labor.

The large size and oppressive treatment of the slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the First and Second Servile Wars erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found tens of thousands of willing followers wishing to escape the oppressive life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, they were never considered a serious threat to the Republic. The Roman heartland had never seen a slave uprising, nor had slaves ever been seen as a potential threat to the city of Rome. This changed with the Third Servile War.

== Beginning of the revolt (73 BC) ==

=== Capuan revolt ===

In the Roman Republic of the 1st century BC, gladiatorial games were one of the more popular forms of entertainment. In order to supply gladiators for the contests, several training schools, or &quot;ludi&quot;, were established throughout Italy. In these schools, prisoners of war and condemned criminals—who were considered slaves—were taught the skills required to fight in gladiatorial games. In 73 BC, a group of some 200 gladiators in the Capuan school owned by Lentulus Batiatus plotted an escape. When their plot was betrayed, a force of about 70 men seized kitchen implements (&quot;choppers and spits&quot;), fought their way free from the school, and seized several wagons of gladiatorial weapons and armor.

Once free, the escaped gladiators chose leaders from their number, selecting two Gallic slaves—Crixus and Oenomaus—and Spartacus, who was said either to be a Thracian auxiliary from the Roman legions later condemned to slavery, or a captive taken by the legions. There is some question as to Spartacus&#x27;s nationality. A &quot;Thraex&quot; was a type of gladiator in Rome, so &quot;Thracian&quot; may simply refer to the style of gladiatorial combat in which he was trained. On the other hand, names nearly identical to Spartacus were recorded among five out of twenty Thracian Odrysae rulers of Bosporan kingdom beginning with Spartokos I the founder of the Spartocid dynasty. The name came from the Thracian words *&quot;sparas&quot; &quot;spear, lance&quot; and *&quot;takos&quot; &quot;famous&quot; and thus meant &quot;renowned by the spear&quot;.

These escaped slaves were able to defeat a small force of troops sent after them from Capua, and equip themselves with captured military equipment as well as their gladiatorial weapons. Sources are somewhat contradictory on the order of events immediately following the escape, but they generally agree that this band of escaped gladiators plundered the region surrounding Capua, recruited many other slaves into their ranks, and eventually retired to a more defensible position on Mount Vesuvius.

=== Defeat of the praetorian armies ===
As the revolt and raids were occurring in Campania, which was a vacation region of the rich and influential in Rome, and the location of many estates, the revolt quickly came to the attention of Roman authorities. They initially viewed the revolt more as a major crime wave than an armed rebellion.

However, later that year, Rome dispatched a military force under praetorian authority to put down the rebellion. A Roman praetor, Gaius Claudius Glaber, gathered a force of 3,000 men, not regular legions, but a militia &quot;picked up in haste and at random, for the Romans did not consider this a war yet, but a raid, something like an attack of robbery.&quot; Glaber&#x27;s forces besieged the slaves on Mount Vesuvius, blocking the only known way down the mountain. With the slaves thus contained, Glaber was content to wait until starvation forced the slaves to surrender.

While the slaves lacked military training, Spartacus&#x27; forces displayed ingenuity in their use of available local tools, and in their use of clever, unorthodox tactics when facing the disciplined Roman infantry. In response to Glaber&#x27;s siege, Spartacus&#x27; men made ropes and ladders from vines and trees growing on the slopes of Vesuvius and used them to rappel down the cliffs on the side of the mountain opposite Glaber&#x27;s forces. They moved around the base of Vesuvius, outflanked the army, and annihilated Glaber&#x27;s men.

A second expedition, under the praetor Publius Varinius, was then dispatched against Spartacus. For some reason, Varinius seems to have split his forces under the command of his subordinates Furius and Cossinius. Plutarch mentions that Furius commanded some 2,000 men, but neither the strength of the remaining forces, nor whether the expedition was composed of militia or legions, appear to be known. These forces were also defeated by the army of escaped slaves: Cossinius was killed, Varinius was nearly captured, and the equipment of the armies was seized by the slaves.

With these victories, more and more slaves flocked to the Spartacan forces, as did &quot;many of the herdsmen and shepherds of the region&quot;, swelling their ranks to some 70,000. The rebel slaves spent the winter of 73–72 BC training, arming and equipping their new recruits, and expanding their raiding territory to include the towns of Nola, Nuceria, Thurii and Metapontum.

The victories of the rebel slaves did not come without a cost. At some time during these events, one of their leaders, Oenomaus, was lost—presumably in battle—and is not mentioned further in the histories.

== Motivation and leadership of the escaped slaves ==

By the end of 73 BC, Spartacus and Crixus were in command of a large group of armed men with a proven ability to withstand Roman armies. What they intended to do with this force is somewhat difficult for modern readers to determine. Since the Third Servile War was ultimately an unsuccessful rebellion, no firsthand account of the slaves&#x27; motives and goals exists, and historians writing about the war propose contradictory theories.

Many popular modern accounts of the war claim that there was a factional split in the escaped slaves between those under Spartacus, who wished to escape over the Alps to freedom, and those under Crixus, who wished to stay in southern Italy to continue raiding and plundering. This appears to be an interpretation of events based on the following: the regions that Florus lists as being raided by the slaves include Thurii and Metapontum, which are geographically distant from Nola and Nuceria.

This indicates the existence of two groups: Lucius Gellius eventually attacked Crixus and a group of some 30,000 followers who are described as being separate from the main group under Spartacus. Plutarch describes the desire of some of the escaped slaves to plunder Italy, rather than escape over the Alps. While this factional split is not contradicted by classical sources, there does not seem to be any direct evidence to support it.

Fictional accounts sometimes portray the rebelling slaves as ancient Roman freedom fighters, struggling to change a corrupt Roman society and to end the Roman institution of slavery. Although this is not contradicted by classical historians, no historical account mentions that the goal of the rebel slaves was to end slavery in the Republic, nor do any of the actions of rebel leaders, who themselves committed numerous atrocities, seem specifically aimed at ending slavery.

Even classical historians, who were writing only years after the events themselves, seem to be divided as to what the motives of Spartacus were. Appian and Florus write that he intended to march on Rome itself—although this may have been no more than a reflection of Roman fears. If Spartacus did intend to march on Rome, it was a goal he must have later abandoned. Plutarch writes that Spartacus merely wished to escape northwards into Cisalpine Gaul and disperse his men back to their homes.

It is not certain that the slaves were a homogeneous group under the leadership of Spartacus, although this is implied by the Roman historians. Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be told from the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus&#x27; people.

== Defeat of the consular armies (72 BC) ==
In the spring of 72 BC, the escaped slaves left their winter encampments and began to move northwards towards Cisalpine Gaul. The Senate, alarmed by the size of the revolt and the defeat of the praetorian armies of Glaber and Varinius, dispatched a pair of consular legions under the command of Lucius Gellius and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus. Initially, the consular armies were successful. Gellius engaged a group of about 30,000 slaves, under the command of Crixus, near Mount Garganus and killed two-thirds of the rebels, including Crixus.

At this point, there is a divergence in the classical sources as to the course of events, which do not correspond until the entry of Marcus Licinius Crassus into the war. The two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the war by Appian and Plutarch detail very different events. Neither account directly contradicts the other but simply reports different events, ignoring some events in the other account and reporting events that are unique to that account.

=== Appian&#x27;s history ===
According to Appian, the battle between Gellius&#x27; legions and Crixus&#x27; men near Mount Garganus was the beginning of a long and complex series of military maneuvers that almost resulted in the Spartacan forces attacking the city of Rome. After his victory over Crixus, Gellius moved northwards, following the main group of slaves under Spartacus who were heading for Cisalpine Gaul. The army of Lentulus was deployed to bar Spartacus&#x27; path and the consuls hoped to trap the rebel slaves between them. Spartacus&#x27; army met Lentulus&#x27; legion, defeated it, turned and destroyed Gellius&#x27; army, forcing the Roman legions to retreat in disarray.

Appian claims that Spartacus executed some 300 captured Roman soldiers to avenge the death of Crixus, forcing them to fight each other to the death as gladiators. Following this victory, Spartacus pushed northwards with his followers (some 120,000) as fast as he could travel, &quot;having burned all his useless material, killed all his prisoners and butchered his pack-animals in order to expedite his movement&quot;.

The defeated consular armies fell back to Rome to regroup while Spartacus&#x27; followers moved northwards. The consuls again engaged Spartacus at the Battle of Picenum somewhere in the Picenum region and were defeated again. Appian claims that at this point Spartacus changed his intention of marching on Rome—implying this was Spartacus&#x27; goal following the confrontation in Picenum—as &quot;he did not consider himself ready as yet for that kind of a fight, as his whole force was not suitably armed, for no city had joined him but only slaves, deserters, and riff-raff&quot;. Spartacus decided to withdraw into southern Italy again. The serviles seized the town of Thurii and the surrounding countryside, arming themselves, raiding the surrounding territories, trading plunder with merchants for bronze and iron (with which to manufacture more arms) and clashing occasionally with Roman forces which were invariably defeated.

=== Plutarch&#x27;s history ===

Plutarch&#x27;s description of events differs significantly from Appian&#x27;s. According to Plutarch, after the battle between Gellius&#x27; legion and Crixus&#x27;s men (whom Plutarch describes as &quot;Germans&quot;) near Mount Garganus, Spartacus&#x27; men engaged the legion commanded by Lentulus, defeated it, seized the Roman supplies and equipment, then pushed into northern Italy. After this defeat, both consuls were relieved of command of their armies by the Roman Senate and recalled to Rome. Plutarch does not mention Spartacus engaging Gellius&#x27; legion at all, nor of Spartacus facing the combined consular legions in Picenum.

Plutarch then goes on to detail a conflict not mentioned in Appian&#x27;s history. According to Plutarch, Spartacus&#x27; army continued northwards to the region around Mutina (modern Modena). There, a Roman army of some 10,000 soldiers—led by the governor of Cisalpine Gaul, Gaius Cassius Longinus—attempted to bar Spartacus&#x27; progress and was also defeated. Plutarch makes no further mention of events until the initial confrontation between Marcus Licinius Crassus and Spartacus in the spring of 71 BC, omitting the march on Rome and the retreat to Thurii described by Appian. As Plutarch describes Crassus forcing Spartacus&#x27; followers to retreat southwards from Picenum, it could be inferred that the rebel slaves approached Picenum from the south in early 71 BC, implying that they withdrew from Mutina into southern or central Italy for the winter of 72–71 BC. Why they might do so, when there was apparently no reason for them not to escape over the Alps—Spartacus&#x27; goal according to Plutarch—is not explained.

== The war under Crassus (71 BC) ==
=== Crassus takes command of the legions ===

Despite the contradictions in the classical sources regarding the events of 72 BC, there seems to be general agreement that Spartacus and his followers were in the south of Italy in early 71 BC. The Senate, alarmed at the apparently unstoppable rebellion, gave the task of putting it down to Marcus Licinius Crassus. Crassus had been a field commander under Lucius Cornelius Sulla during the civil war between Sulla and the Marian faction in 82 BC and had served under Sulla during the dictatorship that followed.

Crassus was given a praetorship and assigned six new legions in addition to the two formerly consular legions of Gellius and Lentulus, giving him an estimated army of some 32,000–48,000 trained Roman infantry plus auxiliaries (there being quite a range in the size of Republican legions). Crassus treated his legions with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving the punishment of unit decimation within his army. Appian is uncertain whether he decimated the two consular legions for cowardice when he was appointed their commander or whether he had his &quot;entire&quot; army decimated for a later defeat (an event in which up to 4,000 legionaries would have been executed).

Plutarch only mentions the decimation of 50 legionaries of one cohort as punishment after Mummius&#x27; defeat in the first confrontation between Crassus and Spartacus. Regardless of events, Crassus&#x27; treatment of his legions proved that &quot;he was more dangerous to them than the enemy&quot; and spurred them on to victory rather than running the risk of displeasing their commander.

=== Crassus and Spartacus ===
When the forces of Spartacus moved northwards once again, Crassus deployed six of his legions on the borders of the region (Plutarch claims the initial battle between Crassus&#x27; legions and Spartacus&#x27; followers occurred near the Picenum region, Appian claims it occurred near the region of Samnium). Crassus detached two legions under his legate, Mummius, to maneuver behind Spartacus but gave them orders not to engage the rebels. When an opportunity presented itself, Mummius disobeyed, attacked the Spartacist forces and was routed. Despite this initial loss, Crassus engaged Spartacus and defeated him, killing some 6,000 of the rebels.

The tide seemed to have turned in the war. Crassus&#x27; legions were victorious in several more engagements, killing thousands of the rebel slaves and forcing Spartacus to retreat south through Lucania to the straits near Messina. According to Plutarch, Spartacus made a bargain with Cilician pirates to transport him and some 2,000 of his men to Sicily, where he intended to incite a slave revolt and gather reinforcements. He was betrayed by the pirates, who took payment and then abandoned the rebel slaves. Minor sources mention that there were some attempts at raft and shipbuilding by the rebels as a means to escape but that Crassus took unspecified measures to ensure the rebels could not cross to Sicily and their efforts were abandoned. Spartacus&#x27; forces retreated towards Rhegium, Crassus&#x27; legions following; upon arrival Crassus built fortifications across the isthmus at Rhegium, despite harassing raids from the rebel slaves. The rebels were under siege and cut off from their supplies.

=== The end of the war ===

The legions of Pompey were returning to Italy, having put down the rebellion of Quintus Sertorius in Hispania. Sources disagree on whether Crassus had requested reinforcements or whether the Senate simply took advantage of Pompey&#x27;s return to Italy but Pompey was ordered to bypass Rome and head south to aid Crassus. The Senate also sent reinforcements under the command of &quot;Lucullus&quot;, mistakenly thought by Appian to be Lucius Licinius Lucullus, commander of the forces engaged in the Third Mithridatic War but who appears to have been the proconsul of Macedonia, Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus, the former&#x27;s younger brother. With Pompey&#x27;s legions marching from the north and Lucullus&#x27; troops landing in Brundisium, Crassus realized that if he did not put down the slave revolt quickly, credit for the war would go to the general who arrived with reinforcements and he spurred his legions on to end the conflict quickly.

Hearing of the approach of Pompey, Spartacus tried to negotiate with Crassus to bring the conflict to a close before Roman reinforcements arrived. When Crassus refused, Spartacus and his army broke through the Roman fortifications and headed up the Bruttium peninsula with Crassus&#x27;s legions in pursuit. The legions managed to catch a portion of the rebels – under the command of Gannicus and Castus – separated from the main army, killing 12,300.

Even though Spartacus had lost many men, Crassus&#x27; legions had also suffered greatly. The Roman forces under the command of a cavalry officer named Lucius Quinctius were destroyed when some of the escaped slaves turned to meet them. The rebel slaves were not a professional army and had reached their limit. They were unwilling to flee any farther and groups of men were breaking away from the main force to independently attack Crassus&#x27;s legions.

With discipline breaking down, Spartacus turned his forces around and brought his entire strength to bear on the legions. In this last stand, the Battle of the Silarius River, Spartacus&#x27; forces were routed, the vast majority of them being killed on the battlefield. All the ancient historians stated that Spartacus was also killed on the battlefield but his body was never found.

== Aftermath ==

The rebels of the Third Servile War were annihilated by Crassus. Pompey&#x27;s forces did not directly engage Spartacus&#x27;s forces but his legions moving from the north were able to chase down some 5,000 rebels fleeing the battle, &quot;all of whom he slew&quot;. After this action, Pompey sent a dispatch to the Senate, saying that while Crassus certainly had conquered the slaves in open battle, he, Pompey, had ended the war, thus claiming a large portion of the credit and earning the enmity of Crassus. While most of the rebel slaves were killed on the battlefield, some 6,000 survivors were captured by the legions of Crassus, all of which were crucified along the Appian Way from Rome to Capua.

Pompey and Crassus reaped political benefit for having put down the rebellion; both returned to Rome with their legions and refused to disband them, instead camping outside Rome. Both men stood for the consulship of 70 BC, even though Pompey was ineligible because of his youth and lack of service as praetor or quaestor. Both men were elected consul for 70 BC, partly due to the implied threat of their armed legions encamped outside the city.

In 60 BC, father of future emperor Augustus; Gaius Octavius sent by senate to put down a slave rebellion in Thurii. These slaves had previously taken part in the rebellions led by Spartacus and Catiline.

It is difficult to determine the extent to which the events of this war contributed to changes in attitudes toward, use of, and legal rights accorded to Roman slaves. However, the end of the Servile Wars seems to have coincided with the end of the period of the most ubiquitous use of slaves in Rome and the beginning of a new perception of slaves within Roman society and law. 

Certainly the revolt had shaken the Roman people, who &quot;out of sheer fear seem to have begun to treat their slaves less harshly than before.&quot; The wealthy owners of the latifundia began to reduce the number of agricultural slaves, opting to employ the large pool of formerly dispossessed freemen in sharecropping arrangements. With the end of Augustus&#x27; reign (27 BC – 14 AD), the major Roman wars of conquest ceased until the reign of Emperor Trajan (reigned 98–117 AD) and with them ended the supply of plentiful and inexpensive slaves through military conquest. This era of peace further promoted the use of freedmen as laborers in agricultural estates.

The legal status and rights of Roman slaves also began to change. During the time of Emperor Claudius (reigned 41–54 AD), a constitution was enacted that made the killing of an old or infirm slave an act of murder and decreed that if such slaves were abandoned by their owners, they became freedmen. Under Antoninus Pius (reigned 138–161 AD), laws further extended the rights of slaves, holding owners responsible for the killing of slaves, forcing the sale of slaves when it could be shown that they were being mistreated and providing a (theoretically) neutral third party to which a slave could appeal. While these legal changes occurred much too late to be &quot;direct&quot; results of the Third Servile War, they represent the legal codification of changes in the Roman attitude toward slaves that evolved over decades.

The Third Servile War was the last servile war and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.

== In popular culture ==
* The film &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), which was executive-produced by and starred Kirk Douglas, was based on Howard Fast&#x27;s novel &quot;Spartacus&quot; and directed by Stanley Kubrick. The film&#x27;s script was written by Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted during the McCarthyism period of the 1950s. The film&#x27;s success contributed to the collapse of the blacklist. The phrase &quot;I&#x27;m Spartacus!&quot; from this film has been referenced in a number of other films, television programs, and commercials.
* In 2004, Fast&#x27;s novel was adapted as a made-for-TV movie by the USA Network, with Goran Višnjić in the main role.
* One episode of 2007–2008 BBC&#x27;s docudrama &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; features Spartacus.
* The television series &quot;Spartacus&quot;, starring Andy Whitfield, and later Liam McIntyre, in the title role, aired on the Starz premium cable network from January 2010 to April 2013.
* The History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Barbarians Rising&quot; (2016) features the story of Spartacus in its second episode entitled &quot;Rebellion&quot;.
* The Netflix docudrama TV series &quot;Roman Empire&quot; features Spartacus as well as the Battle of the Silarius River in its 2nd season, recounting the story of Gaius Julius Caesar.
* The Third Servile War, and ancient slave revolts in general, play a central part in Arms of Nemesis by Steven Saylor.

== Notes ==
* References to the Mommsen text is based on the Project Gutenberg e-text edition of the books. References are therefore given in terms of line numbers within the text file, and not page numbers as would be the case with a physical book.
* References to &quot;classical works&quot; (Livy, Plutarch, Appian, etc.) are given in the traditional &quot;Book:verse&quot; format, rather than edition-specific page numbers.

<doc id="895425" wikidata="Q250064" url="?curid=895425" title="Hey Jude (Beatles album)">
<text>Hey Jude (original title: The Beatles Again) is a 1970 collection of non-album singles and B-sides by the Beatles. Originally released in the United States and various other markets, but not in the United Kingdom, it consists of non-album singles and B-sides not previously issued on an American Beatles LP; this includes &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, two singles released by Capitol Records whose only previous American album appearance had been on the &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; soundtrack album, which had been released by United Artists Records. The &quot;Hey Jude&quot; LP has been out of print since the late 1980s, although it remained available on cassette during the 1990s. The album was issued on CD for the first time in 2014, as an individual release and in a box set titled &quot;The U.S. Albums&quot;. It is named after the Beatles&#x27; longest-running No. 1 single &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, itself the seventh track of the compilation.

==History==
The &quot;Hey Jude&quot; album was conceived by Allen Klein and Apple Records. Klein had negotiated a more lucrative contract for the Beatles with Capitol Records in 1969 which required one compilation album per year. He directed Allan Steckler of ABKCO/Apple to work on one. Steckler chose songs that had not appeared on a Capitol album in the United States and that spanned the group&#x27;s career. He also focused more on recent singles than on earlier material. The absence of the songs from a US Capitol album was partially due to the EMI&#x27;S unwillingness to include single releases on their contemporaneous albums. This was a consequence of their arrangement with United Artists in 1964 and due to the habit of Capitol Records of recompiling the Beatles&#x27; British releases for local markets until 1967. Steckler chose not to include the original Parlophone single version of &quot;Love Me Do&quot;; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, which had been released as a single by Capitol and was available on the United Artists soundtrack album; &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot;, which was the B-side of &quot;Help!&quot;; and &quot;The Inner Light&quot;, the B-side of &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;. He also overlooked &quot;From Me to You&quot;, &quot;Misery&quot;, and &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot;, which were first issued in the US by Vee Jay Records but had not yet been issued on a Capitol album. &quot;Sie Liebt Dich&quot;, a German-language version of &quot;She Loves You&quot;, and the single version of &quot;Get Back&quot; were also passed over. (The single version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; and its B-side, &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)&quot;, had yet to be released.)

Steckler and Apple had become disappointed with the Capitol Records release schedules and determined to promote the new album themselves. Steckler also took the tapes to Sam Feldman at Bell Sound Studios for mastering, rather than delivering them to Capitol. He would do this for several releases thereafter.

Originally, the album was to be called &quot;The Beatles Again&quot;. Shortly before the record was released, however, the title was changed to &quot;Hey Jude&quot; in order to promote the inclusion of the top-selling song that led off side two. The title change occurred after the record labels were printed, and an untold number of copies of the LP were sold with labels with the title &quot;The Beatles Again&quot;. This was also true for cassette copies of the album, which retained the original title. Neither the front nor the back of the album jacket displayed the record&#x27;s title (or the name of the band), but most copies were sold in a jacket whose spine read &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. In an attempt to clear up any confusion caused by the pre-printed labels, initial copies of the album displayed a sticker on the cover bearing the title &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. The edition of the album with &quot;The Beatles Again&quot; label bore catalogue number SO-385 on the label but not on the jacket. This is because of a similarly timed decision to reduce the price from $6.98 (SO- prefix) to $5.98 (SW- prefix). The record jacket was prepared late enough so that it lists the catalogue number as SW-385. The SW-385 catalogue number appears on the label of later pressings that bear the title &quot;Hey Jude&quot; on the label.

Klein authorized the release of the album as a sales buffer during post-production of the delayed &quot;Let It Be&quot; album. In 2007 Neil Aspinall claimed that the back cover was supposed to be the front cover and vice versa but that Klein had reversed them in error. However, at least three prototype cover designs are known to exist, with the earliest of those showing the photos &quot;reversed&quot;: John Kosh seemingly made the determination that the photo that now appears on the front cover was better suited for that purpose. The front and back cover pictures were taken at the last-ever Beatles photo session, on 22 August 1969, at John Lennon&#x27;s home Tittenhurst Park by Ethan Russell.

==Release==
The compilation was released in many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, Spain, Germany, France, Greece, Japan, Mexico, Venezuela and most of South America. It was also available to other countries as an &quot;export&quot; from Britain (Parlophone/Apple CPCS-106) but was not at first issued in Britain, although it was a popular import to the UK. The first issue in New Zealand was on the gloss black Apple label with the catalogue number CPCS-106. The matrix numbers were identical to those on the UK &quot;export&quot; issue. Because of its popularity worldwide, EMI issued &quot;Hey Jude&quot; in Britain on the Parlophone label on 11 May 1979 (catalogue number PCS 7184). Until the release of &quot;1967–1970&quot; in 1973, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was the only way to own the extremely popular &quot;Hey Jude&quot; single on LP or in a stereo mix. The songs &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot; were also first mixed for stereo specifically for this album. Prior to the release of the &quot;Get Back&quot; single in the spring of 1969, all Beatles singles were issued in mono in the US. Several other countries adopted the original &quot;The Beatles Again&quot; title. Of these, the Spanish release omitted &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;, due to that song having been deemed offensive. (In addition to making repeated mention of Christ and crucifixion, the lyrics contain the line &quot;Gibraltar near Spain&quot; at a time when Spain&#x27;s Franco administration was contending with the UK over the ownership of Gibraltar.)

On the reel-to-reel and cassette tape releases, sides one and two are reversed. Although it is clear on the vinyl version that &quot;Hey Jude&quot; opens side two, when compiling this issue for audio tape, some compilers (at Capitol and Ampex) thought to make the change, which resulted in &quot;Hey Jude&quot; leading off the album. This was done because side two was the longer side, and it was the practice in some tape formats to lead the album with the longer side to avoid a large gap in the &quot;middle&quot; of the tape. The four-track tape cartridge, prepared by Ampex along with the reel-to-reel tape, has the songs in the original, chronological order. (The eight-track tape was treated to the usual re-ordering that eight-tracks received.)

The Compact Disc era saw the standardization of the Beatles&#x27; discographies worldwide, and for many years the &quot;Hey Jude&quot; compilation was not available in the CD format. Although no longer in print on LP, the &quot;Hey Jude&quot; album was still available on cassette tape until the 1990s. In January 2014, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was issued on CD both individually and in an American Beatles album compilation box set titled &quot;The U.S. Albums&quot;.

<text>Tabaré &quot;Tab&quot; Ramos Ricciardi (born September 21, 1966) is an American former soccer player and coach.

Over his thirteen-year professional career, Ramos played as a midfielder in Spain, Mexico, and the United States. The first player to sign with Major League Soccer, he spent the last seven years of his career with the MetroStars. He featured in three World Cups and was elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2005.

==Early career==

===Youth and school===
Born in Uruguay, Ramos immigrated to the United States with his family when he was 11. His father played professional soccer in Uruguay with CA River Plate and instilled a love for the game into Tab from an early age. While living in Uruguay, he played for the Union Vecinal Youth Soccer Club in Montevideo.

When his family arrived in the U.S., they settled in New Jersey where Ramos lived in Harrison and Kearny. He attended Saint Benedict&#x27;s Preparatory School, the same high school attended by Claudio Reyna a few years later. In 1982, he became U.S. citizen. He also played for local youth club Thistle FC where he played with future United States captain John Harkes. Ramos and Harkes played together from their youth through the U.S. National Team. They were both inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2005.

Ramos was a two-time high school All-America and the 1983 Parade Magazine National High School Player of the Year. That year he led St. Benedict&#x27;s to the New Jersey State Championship. Ramos still holds the New Jersey High School boys&#x27; soccer career scoring record of 161 goals, 57 of which he scored in his senior year. In 1999, he was named by &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; as one of the top ten New Jersey high school soccer players of the 1980s.
Apart from playing soccer, Ramos also ran indoor track at St. Benedict&#x27;s (60 yards and 4 × 100 m relay).

In 1984 the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League drafted Ramos with the 10th pick of the first round but he chose to go to college instead. The NASL folded about six months later.

===College===
Ramos attended college at NC State where he played NCAA soccer for four years. He was All ACC his four years and a three time All-American. He was tied with Bruce Murray for the Atlantic Coast Conference scoring title his senior year. In 1988, he left school briefly to play for the U.S. team at the 1988 Summer Olympics. However, he returned in 1989 to leave again when he signed with the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team. He finally graduated in 2001 with a Bachelor of Arts in Foreign Language (Spanish) and Literature after taking years of correspondence courses.

==Professional career==

===American Soccer League / MISL ===
Ramos played with the New Jersey Eagles of the American Soccer League in 1988. That same year the Tacoma Stars of the MISL selected him with the #1 pick in the draft. He didn&#x27;t play a game as he decided to only play the outdoor game. He then moved to the Miami Sharks for the 1989 season. He was selected as a league All Star that year.

===Spain===
Ramos and several other national team players signed contracts with the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) to play exclusively for the national team as it prepared for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Following the World Cup, USSF began seeking club opportunities for the national team players. On July 27, 1990, USSF agreed to loan Ramos to Spanish Second Division club Figueres for the 1990–1991 season. He played with Tito Vilanova who would later become FC Barcelona&#x27;s manager. In his first season with the team he played 38 games, scoring 5 goals. On June 23, 1991, Figueres purchased Ramos&#x27; contract from USSF for $250,000. His excellent play continued during his second year with the Figueres, bringing considerable attention from several Primera División clubs. However, Ramos sabotaged this interest when he was ejected from a Nov 24, 1991 game with Rayo Vallecano. He was suspended for three games and interest in him dried up until the end of the season. On July 31, 1992, Figueres sold Ramos to fellow Second Division club Real Betis for $400,000. In the 1993–1994 season Real Betis won Segunda División and earned promotion to La Liga. While Ramos remained with Betis for the 1994–1995 season, he never played a game in La Liga as he was recovering from a skull fracture suffered during the 1994 FIFA World Cup game with Brazil (see Senior national team section).

In 1994, Ramos was chosen as the CONCACAF Player of the Year.

===Mexico===
On January 3, 1995, Ramos became the first player to sign with Major League Soccer (MLS). The league had intended to begin play in the fall of 1995 but difficulties forced it to delay its start for a year. Rather than letting players such as Ramos sit idle, the league loaned him and several others to foreign teams. MLS sent Ramos to the Liga MX side México Primera División Tigres for the second half of the 1994–1995 season. Ramos became the first American player to appear for the side, seeing time in twelve games. He remained on loan with Tigres for the 1995-96 season, playing twenty-three games and scoring two goals as the team ran to the 1996 Mexico Cup championship, one of two Mexico Cups won by Tigres and its first title in 20 years.

===MetroStars===
While Ramos was in Mexico, MLS allocated him to the future New York/New Jersey franchise, eventually known as the MetroStars.

Following the end of the Mexican season in April 1996, Ramos returned to the United States for the inaugural MLS season in 1996. He would play seven seasons for the MetroStars, earning All Star recognition in 1996, 1998 and 1999. On May 14, 2002, he announced his intentions of retiring at the end of the 2002 season. When he retired, he was the last original member of the team. Unfortunately, his flashes of brilliance were interrupted by long injury spells, as he never lived up to his potential in a MetroStars jersey. Ramos totaled just eight goals and 36 assists in MLS play (ten goals and 39 assists in all competitions).

== U.S. national teams==

===1983 FIFA U-20 World Cup===
Ramos began his national team career playing at the U-20 level in 1982, just after gaining his U.S. citizenship. Ramos was 15 when he scored two goals in the regional qualifying for the 1983 FIFA U-20 World Cup. However, the U.S. went 0-2-1 and failed to advance out of group play in the championship tournament.

===Cut from 1984 Olympic team ===
Ramos represented the U.S. at the 1983 Pan American Games. In 1984, Ramos was the last player cut from the U.S. 1984 Summer Olympics soccer team. At 17 years old, he had just left high school, but was already known as an up-and-coming player. However, the International Olympic Committee had opened the Olympic soccer tournament to professionals for the 1984 games. The U.S., as the host nation, did not need to qualify, but had assembled a team of amateurs, mostly college players. When the IOC announced their decision, USSF dumped most of the original team, except for Paul Caligiuri, for professionals.

Ramos had further disappointment a year later when the U.S. failed to qualify for the 1985 FIFA U-20 World Cup, despite a 3-2-2 record in the qualifying tournament. He went on, however, to play for the U.S. team which went 0-1-2 at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.

===Senior national team===
It would be another year before Ramos earned his first cap for the senior U.S. team, on January 10, 1988, against Guatemala. He soon became an integral part of national team.

After playing for the United States in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, he was named U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year in 1990.

In 1994 Ramos once again played in the World Cup, being a starting player for the U.S. National Team in all its matches. In the round of 16 Ramos suffered a skull fracture, caused by an elbow to the head by Brazilian leftback Leonardo in the first half of the game, which resulted in a straight red for Leonardo. United States were eliminated as Bebeto scored Brazil&#x27;s winning goal. Tab Ramos was in the hospital for a few weeks where he was visited by Leonardo.

Ramos saw more success in 1995 as a member of the U.S. team when it placed fourth at the Copa América.

On September 7, 1997, Ramos scored against Costa Rica in a 1-0 World Cup qualifier win. In 1998, he played in his third World Cup. Ramos made his last national team appearance on November 15, 2000, in a 4-0 U.S. win against Barbados. Two days later he announced his retirement from the national team. He finished his national team career with 81 caps and eight goals.

Ramos also played 8 games, scoring 3 goals, for the U.S. Futsal team which finished 3rd at the 1989 FIFA Futsal World Championship.

===International goals===
==Coaching career==

===NJSA 04===
In 2004, with the help of partners, Ramos founded a soccer club based out of Aberdeen, New Jersey. NJSA 04 later morphed into Cedar Stars Monmouth and is currently one of four clubs in New Jersey to participate in the MLS Next League.

===United States U-20 national team===

Ramos is one of the most accomplished figures in U.S. Soccer history qualifying for the fourth World Cup as U-20 MNT head coach in 2019. He led the under-20 age group team to the final of the 2013 CONCACAF U-20 Championship where they lost to Mexico. The team qualified for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup, however they failed to make it out of the group stage, finishing bottom with 1 point.

In November 2013, he signed a contract to remain in the position. He won the 2017 CONCACAF U-20 Championship with the United States, with assistant coaches Omid Namazi and Brad Friedel. In 2019 Ramos qualified the team to the third straight FIFA U-20 World Cup quarterfinal. In 2015 after a scoreless draw through 120 minutes Serbia eliminated the team in quarterfinals on penalties. Ultimately Serbia won the championship beating Brazil 2–1 in the final of the FIFA Under-20 World Cup in Auckland 

===United States men&#x27;s national soccer team===
On March 31, 2014, Ramos was appointed to the assistant coach position of the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team by head coach Jürgen Klinsmann, less than three months before the 2014 World Cup, replacing Martín Vásquez.

===Houston Dynamo===
On October 25, 2019, Ramos was named head coach of Major League Soccer club Houston Dynamo.

===Hartford Athletic===
Ramos was named head coach of USL Championship club Hartford Athletic on August 22, 2022.

<doc id="895428" wikidata="Q856935" url="?curid=895428" title="Cadillac STS">
<text>The Cadillac STS (an initialism of Seville Touring Sedan) is a mid-sized luxury 4-door sedan manufactured and marketed by General Motors from 2004 to 2011 for the 2005 to 2011 model years. A version of the STS was marketed in China as the SLS through 2013. 

It was equipped with a six-speed automatic transmission with performance algorithm shifting and driver shift control.

== Origins ==
The STS was the successor to the Cadillac Seville, which beginning in 1987 was available as an upscale performance-oriented &quot;STS&quot; (for &quot;Seville Touring Sedan&quot;) version.

While smaller than the full-size DTS, the more expensive STS was the flagship sedan of the Cadillac brand.

== Safety ==
The Cadillac STS was rated with a four star frontal and five star rear passenger crash test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It was given an overall &quot;Good&quot; score in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety frontal crash test and an &quot;Acceptable&quot; rating in the side impact test. In the side impact test injury measurements to the driver&#x27;s pelvis was rated &quot;Poor&quot; and for the torso &quot;Acceptable.&quot;

== 2005-2007 ==
The front wheel drive Seville model name was retired in 2004, succeeded by an entirely new &quot;STS&quot; based on the rear wheel drive GM Sigma platform. The first Cadillac sedan to be offered with All wheel drive, it retained the Seville&#x27;s high-performance Magnetic Ride Control suspension. The Cadillac STS was assembled at GM&#x27;s Lansing Grand River facility in Lansing, Michigan along with the smaller CTS sedan.

Available engines were a 3.6 L High Feature LY7 V6 with and and the 4.6 L Northstar LH2 V8 which puts out and in the STS. All engine models feature dual overhead camshafts with variable valve timing. Remote ignition is standard.

Overall length was down 5&quot; to 196.3&quot;, yet wheelbase grew by 4&quot; to , resulting in increased interior space. A heads-up display was optional, as was a 300-watt Bose stereo system with MP3 capability. Base pricing at launch ranged from US$40,575 for the V6 model to US$47,025 for the V8.

== 2008-2011 ==
The STS for model year 2008 received minor exterior revisions, including a larger grille and chrome fender vents. The interior received revised materials and a new steering wheel.

The standard powertrain was a direct-injected 3.6 L V6 mated to a six-speed automatic transmission, which in the STS produced and of torque. Optional safety features included a lane departure warning system developed by Mobileye, a blind spot monitoring system, and an improved version of GM&#x27;s StabiliTrak stability control system, which could operate the steering system in addition to the brakes to help correct a skid. Options previously limited to the V8 model (such as HID headlamps and Automotive head-up display) were available with the V6. The 2008 Cadillac STS debuted at the 2007 New York Auto Show.

A 2010 update for the STS removed the GM badges, although early 2010 models still retained GM badging. For 2011, the V8 was dropped from the Cadillac STS lineup.

== STS-V ==
The Cadillac STS-V is a high-performance executive car of the V-Series introduced at the 2005 Detroit Auto Show, and was available for sale in late 2005.

The STS-V uses a supercharged 4.4 L version of the Northstar V8, producing and . This engine is mated to a driver-adjustable GM automatic transmission with two shifting modes, larger brakes by Brembo, larger 10 spoke alloy wheels (18&quot;x8.5&quot; front, 19&quot;x9.5&quot; rear), Pirelli run-flat tires, a faster steering ratio, and a stiffer suspension than the standard STS. The engine block and cylinder heads are aluminum, the camshafts are cast iron, and the crankshaft is forged steel. Suspension is fully independent and there are four settings for the traction control system and stability control. Also different from the standard STS, the STS-V has a cooler for the rear differential oil located on the underside of the car behind the 3rd member.

The STS-V had a 0- acceleration time of 4.6 seconds and a 13.2 second quarter mile time.

The STS-V&#x27;s primary visual difference from the standard STS was a wire mesh grille and a &#x27;power-dome&#x27; hood as well as six lug wheels normally seen only on larger SUVs, trucks and pickups. In addition to the grille, the front differences include the bumper, the fog light and turning signal cluster, and the hood which is slightly domed to fit over the supercharger. In the rear, the bumper is different from the standard STS and includes a wire mesh insert at the bottom which is made of the same mesh material used in the front grille. The rear spoiler is taller and wider, and encompasses the third brake light.

For the interior, the STS-V also has upgraded leather and suede trim contracted from the German company Dräxlmaier, whose prior credit includes the Maybach 57 and 62. Interior color choices were Ebony and Gray, both of which are offered on the standard STS as well, and a two-tone Ebony/Tango Red scheme which was unique to the STS-V.

Production numbers
The model was discontinued in 2009.
== Chinese Cadillac SLS ==

The Chinese market received the Cadillac SLS (for Seville Luxury Sedan) in November 2006 for the 2007 model year. It was assembled by Shanghai GM. Compared to the STS, the SLS has a longer wheelbase, unique interior appointments, and a near-identical exterior appearance. Engine choices included the 2.8-liter &quot;LP1&quot; V-6, 3.6 &quot;LY7&quot; V-6 and the 4.6-liter Northstar V-8 as in the STS V-8 from 2007 to 2009. The 3.6 liter &quot;LLT&quot; engine was available from 2010 to 2011 until it was replaced by the 2.0 liter &quot;LDK&quot; and the 3.0 liter &quot;LF1&quot; V6 for 2011 to 2013 models.
The Chinese-Spec SLS received a facelift at the end of 2009, and was sold as a 2010 model year. The grille, bumper and many other details were revised. It was available in 5 trim levels known as: 2.8 Elite, 2.8 Luxury, 3.6 Elite, 3.6 Luxury and 4.6 Flagship. The SLS was priced from 448,000RMB to 828,000RMB ($94,835 to $175,160 US - August 2022 exchange rate).

GM discontinued the production of the SLS in February 2013.

==Successor==
The final STS was assembled on May 4, 2011. The enlarged third generation rear-wheel drive CTS sedan introduced in 2013 as a 2014 model, similar in size and price to the STS, effectively succeeded it.

<text>The German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (), short Leopoldina, is the national academy of Germany, and is located in Halle (Saale). Founded on 1 January 1652, based on academic models in Italy, it was originally named the &quot;Academia Naturae Curiosorum&quot; until 1687 when Emperor Leopold I raised it to an academy and named it after himself. It was since known under the German name &quot;Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina&quot; until 2007, when it was declared to be Germany&#x27;s National Academy of Sciences.

==History==

The Leopoldina was founded in the imperial city of Schweinfurt on 1 January 1652 under the Latin name sometimes translated into English as &quot;Academy of the Curious as to Nature.&quot; It was founded by four local physicians – Johann Laurentius Bausch, the first president of the society, Johann Michael Fehr, Georg Balthasar Metzger, and Georg Balthasar Wohlfarth; and was the only academy like it at the time making it the oldest academy of science in Germany. The archives of Leopoldina are some of the oldest in the world based on the fact that the records date back to the 17th century. These records will provide a window into the German sciences of the last 350 years.

In 1670, the society began to publish the &quot;Ephemeriden&quot; or &quot;Miscellanea Curiosa&quot;, one of the earliest scientific journals and one which had a particularly strong focus on medicine and related aspects of natural philosophy, such as botany and physiology., pp. 7–8 It was recognized by Emperor Leopold I who raised it to an academy in 1677, and then declared it an Imperial Academy in 1687, naming it Sacri Romani Imperii Academia Caesareo-Leopoldina Naturae Curiosorum and allowing it to carry his name.

At first, the society conducted its business by correspondence and was located wherever the president was working., pp. 8–9 After Schweinfurt, the Academy was rooted in many places before it was permanently located in Halle in 1878. Following Schweinfurt in chronological order: Nuremberg, Augsburg, Altdorf, Erfurt, Halle, Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bonn, Jena, Dresden, and finally Halle., pp. 8–9

There were many efforts during years of national prosperity to elevate the Academy to the status of a &#x27;national institute,&#x27; but all such early efforts failed. In those times the Academy was not on the nation&#x27;s agenda at a political or academic level. Later, however, its members began to enrich the Academy with an obligation to be present at its proceedings so as to improve their public standing. Thus they began to hold regular monthly meetings, even in the challenging conditions of 1924, pp. 8–9 which had to be attended by all local members.

When Adolf Hitler became Germany&#x27;s Chancellor in 1933, the Leopoldina started to exclude its Jewish members. Albert Einstein was the first victim because of public pressure. 1938 followed a declaration to the Nazi government, that all jewish members had been excluded, while in reality the index cards of around 70 members just got hid behind a curtain, no official member lists got published anymore and the cards got reintegrated one day after the german capitulation. Eight of them were murdered by the Nazis over the course of World War II. Nevertheless, the Leopoldina did not suffer as much influence from the Nazi regime as other German academies, thanks to the president of the Leopoldina at the time, Emil Abderhalden. While Jewish members were &#x27;officially&#x27; expelled, the president of the Leopoldina made sure it did not go to the lengths that other academies went to at the time, the expelled did not even get a notification about the matter, still received the member magazines and did not get exposed in the public by a statement of the society. Abderhalden resisted the Nazi pressures by reorganizing Sections of the Academy and introducing a new series &#x27;Biographies of German Natural Scientists&#x27; in 1932.

After World War II, Halle became part of East Germany. During this time, the German Democratic Republic shut down all societies, leading the members of the Leopoldina to meet unofficially and in private. Efforts were made to reestablish the Academy, however. An edition of Goethe&#x27;s &#x27;The Works of Science&#x27; began to be edited under the Academy&#x27;s name in 1947, and lectures started again in 1948. However, the Academy was not officially reopened until 1952. This reopening came just in time for the Academy to celebrate its tercentenary.

After reopening, the Leopoldina successfully resisted attempts from the German Democratic Republic to reconstitute the Academy as a specifically East German institute and continued to think of itself as an institution for the whole of Germany. This was greatly affected by the building of the Berlin Wall in August 1961. The Academy was able to stay independent of national politics, which allowed it to bridge East and West Germany through scientific ideas. The yearly meeting of the Academy was planned for October of that year in West Germany; invitations had been sent out in June announcing that they would be discussing energy; but less than two months later letters of cancellation were sent out, stating that members living in the GDR would not be given permission to travel.

In 1991, after German reunification, the Leopoldina was granted the status of a non-profit organisation. It is funded jointly by the German government and the government of the state of Saxony-Anhalt., pp. 10–14 A new section was also created for the history of culture with the emphasis on medicine and the natural sciences.

In November 2007, German science minister Annette Schavan announced the renaming of the Leopoldina to &quot;German Academy of Sciences&quot; (&quot;Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften&quot;), and said that &quot;due to its international prestige, the Leopoldina is predestined to represent Germany within the circle of international academies.&quot; Karsten Jedlitschka says that the Academy was named the first national science Academy in Germany in February 2008. As the German Academy of Sciences, it is a counterpart to the rights and responsibilities of institutions such as Britain&#x27;s Royal Society and the United States&#x27; National Academy of Sciences. As the national academy, the Leopoldina will act as a consulting service on matters of science and science related policy for the German government, including parliament and social and political organizations.

== Activities ==
The Leopoldina is the first and foremost academic society in Germany to advise the German government on a variety of scientific matters, for instance on climate change and disease control.

The Leopoldina gives conferences and lectures and continues to publish the &quot;Ephemeriden&quot; under the name &quot;Nova Acta Leopoldina&quot;. It issues various medals and awards, offers grants and scholarships and elects new members to itself. The Academy also maintains a library and an archive and it also researches its own history and publishes another journal, &quot;Acta Historica Leopoldina&quot; devoted to this subject., pp. 15–33

Consistently with its national preeminence, it also collaborates extensively with other learned societies in international exchanges of ideas and policy recommendations. Details of such initiatives are included on its multilingual website.

== Honours ==
Apart from being a fellow, excellence can also be rewarded by receiving one of the following honours:
* Honorary membership
* Cothenius Medal (first awarded in 1792)
* Carus Medal (first awarded in 1896)
* Schleiden Medal (first awarded in 1955)
* (since 1965, in honour of Gregor Mendel)
* Darwin Badge (only awarded in 1959 – the centenary of the publication of The origin of species)
* Leopoldina Prize for Junior Scientists
* Georg Uschmann Prize for History of Science
* Leopoldina Research Prize (since 2001, funded by the Commerzbank Foundation)
* Thieme Prize of the Leopoldina for Medicine
* Medal of Merit (awarded by the Presidium only on special occasions)
* Greve Prize (first awarded in 2022)

== Membership ==

Three quarters of the members are from German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) and one quarter from about 30 other nations. The election to membership of the Leopoldina is the highest academic honour awarded by an institution in Germany.
Some laureates are also fellows of the Leopoldina.

Among the most noted of fellows are for instance:
* Christian Ludwig Brehm
* Adolf Butenandt
* James B. Conant
* Manfred Eigen
* Albert Einstein (excluded 1933 for being Jewish)
* Gerhard Ertl
* Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
* Ernst Haeckel
* Otto Hahn
* Theodor W. Hänsch
* Paula Hertwig
* Joseph Lister
* Alexander Oparin
* Wilhelm Ostwald
* Max Planck
* Carl Friedrich von Weizäcker
Members might also attribute discoveries and success to the academy. For example, the asteroid 893 Leopoldina is named in its honour.

== Leadership ==

At the head of the Academy there is a Presidium, elected by the Senate, consisting of the President, acting as the chair, four Vice Presidents, and other members at large. These position terms are five years long and can only be held twice by the same person. The Senate of the Academy currently consists of 39 members representing different sections and disciplines of science, as well as representatives from Switzerland and Austria. Senate members serve for four years and can only be re-elected once. The latest President of the Academy, Gerald Haug, from Berlin, became the Academy&#x27;s 27th president when he took office on 1 March 2020.

<text>Red Star was a revolutionary socialist organisation in Britain formed by former members of the Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee), the Alliance for Workers&#x27; Liberty and the Peace Party.

Founded in July 2004 as the Red Party, it produced five issues of its paper called the &quot;Red Star&quot;.

== History ==
=== Red Platform ===
Politically, the Red Party was a continuation of the Red Platform of the CPGB formed in April 2004 in opposition to the CPGB&#x27;s electoral support for Respect Party, with the aim to reverse the CPGB&#x27;s withdrawal from the Socialist Alliance Democracy Platform. It also argued for greater democracy and humanism in the party&#x27;s internal structure. Though it won the battle to take the CPGB back into the SADP, most of the platform members left following disputes over the publication of their views in the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot;.

The Red Party regarded the division of the left into separate groups as natural and even a healthy sign that socialists are arguing out complicated questions of programme. It believed the left had &quot;lost its way&quot; through &quot;sectarianism&quot;, which it defined as the refusal to unite in a single workers&#x27; party unless each group&#x27;s own programmatic demands are met. It further believed that the left focuses primarily on arguing these programmatic issues internally, rather than taking basic socialist arguments to the working class as a whole. It placed an emphasis on plain language arguments for socialism.

=== Red Party ===
Leninism became the rupture point within the group in the early summer of 2005. The discovery by group members of the writings of Maurice Brinton (pen name of Chris Pallis) and the Solidarity group led to a reassessment of the groups political orientation and the departure of one member to the AWL. The surviving &quot;Red Star&quot; group considers itself as a part of the libertarian left and has comrades who are active in Class War, the Anarchist Federation and Surrey Anarchist Group whilst maintaining a libertarian Marxist persona and links with parts of the traditional left through the Socialist Alliance.

David Broder, whose departure from the Red Party group in protest at its lack of Leninist purity, is now a leading figure in The Commune, an anti-Leninist and libertarian Marxist group that derives a great deal of its founding politics from the writings of Maurice Brinton and the Solidarity group.

<doc id="895441" wikidata="Q1934603" url="?curid=895441" title="Whaling in Japan">
<text>Japanese whaling, in terms of active hunting of whales, is estimated by the Japan Whaling Association to have begun around the 12th century. However, Japanese whaling on an industrial scale began around the 1890s when Japan started to participate in the modern whaling industry, at that time an industry in which many countries participated. 

During the 20th century, Japan was heavily involved in commercial whaling. This continued until the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium on commercial whaling went into effect in 1986. Japan continued to hunt whales using the scientific research provision in the agreement, and Japanese whaling was conducted by the Institute of Cetacean Research. This was allowed under IWC rules, although most IWC members opposed it. However, in March 2014, the UN&#x27;s International Court of Justice ruled that the Japanese whaling program called &quot;JARPA II,&quot; in the Southern Ocean including inside the Australian Whale Sanctuary, was not in accordance with the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, and was not for scientific purposes, as it had claimed. They ordered Japan to cease operations. In response to the ruling, Japan formulated a new Antarctic research whaling program, &quot;NEWREP-A&quot;, to replace JARPAII. Under this program, 333 Antarctic minke whales were hunted each year from 2015 to 2018. On 1 July 2019 Japan withdrew from the IWC and resumed commercial whaling, claiming that the IWC&#x27;s original goal of sustainable whaling had been lost. As a result, Japanese whaling will now only take place in Japan&#x27;s territorial waters and exclusive economic zones, moving away from the high seas in order to avoid trade violations under CITES. In 2024, Japan hunted 179 Bryde&#x27;s whales, 87 minke whales, 30 fin whales, and 25 sei whales.

Antarctic hunts were a source of conflict between pro- and anti-whaling countries and organizations. Antarctic minke whales abundance in the East Antarctic Ocean may have remained stable or declined slightly during JARPA, but this is thought to be due to a decline in krill as a result of the increase in humpback whales. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), on the other hand, listed it as Near Threatened (NT) in 2018. The UN&#x27;s International Court of Justice, in addition to other countries, scientists, and environmental organizations, consider the Japanese research program to be unnecessary and lacking scientific merit, and describe it as a thinly disguised commercial whaling operation. Japan, echoing Norway&#x27;s arguments on its own whaling activities, also argues it is entitled to continue whaling because of whaling&#x27;s place in its cultural heritage. The whale meat from these hunts is sold in shops and restaurants, and is showcased at an annual food festival that, in some cases, features the butchering of a whale for onlookers. A poll in 2014 found that few Japanese people have been eating whale meat regularly since whale-based dishes disappeared from school lunches in 1987.

==History==

Archeological evidence in the form of whale remains discovered in burial mounds suggests that whales have been consumed in Japan since the Jōmon period (between c. 14,000 and 300 BCE). Without the means to engage in active whaling, consumption at that time primarily stemmed from stranded whales. Surviving Ainu folklore reveals a long history of whaling and a spiritual association with whales. The earliest records of hand-thrown harpoons date from the 12th century.

===Organized whaling===

Organized open-boat shore whaling began in the 1570s; and continued into the early 20th century. Techniques were developed in the 17th century in Taiji, Wakayama. Wada Chubei Yorimoto established a fishery by organizing the group hunting system in 1606. Whalers would spot whales from stations along the shore and launch boats to catch them with harpoons and lances. His grandson, Wada Kakuemon Yoriharu, later known as Taiji Kakuemon Yoriharu, invented the whaling net technique called &quot;amitori-shiki&quot; (網取り式).

Primarily right whales, humpback whales, gray, and fin whales were hunted. Blue whales, sei, Bryde&#x27;s and sperm whales were however also taken when possible.

Once ashore, the whale was quickly flensed and divided into its separate parts for various warehouses and further processing. Although the primary use for whales was meat, the entire whale was used in a variety of products including lamp oil, soaps, fertilizer, folding fans (baleen), and more. This method of whaling required a significant financial investment from rich individuals to compensate for the sizable labor force. However, whaling remained entwined with ritual and unlike their contemporary European counterparts the early Japanese coastal whalers considered whales a valuable resource and did not over-exploit local stocks.

Domestically, Japanese writers have tried to call attention to historical whale declines due to whaling practices by other nations over hundreds of years, some of which continue today, and assert that motives and objectives of Japanese whaling customs differ from other nations. Supporters of the Japanese whaling tradition claim that the experience is both humble and emotional, and all parts of a whale are used, unlike westerners of the past who hunted only for whale oil. In addition, Japan has strictly controlled catch quotas, and whalers have never hunted juveniles or cow/calf pairs due to their respect for whales. When they kill whales, hunters invoke the Buddha and pray for the repose of whales&#x27; souls; they held funerals for whales, built cenotaphs for them, gave posthumous Buddhist names to them, and when a dead fetus is removed from a butchered cow, an effort is made to release it into the sea. These practices are intended to encourage emotionally healthy or spiritual relationships with whales, and are connected with Japanese religious beliefs.

Even though Buddhists were opposed to hunting whales, due to the whales&#x27; great care for their calves, enforcement of the &quot;Shorui-Awaremi-no-rei&quot; (ordinances of animal protection) excluded whales due to being perceived locally as fish, despite the fulfillment of terms of protection for having &quot;mammalian natures&quot;, and that a paper regarding whales as mammals was published in Kyoto in 1758. As a precept, Buddhists and other concerned people created folklore tales about whaling communities and those who practiced whaling on an industrial scales met tragic downfalls by supernatural phenomenon such as phantoms and the curses of whales.

North Pacific right whales followed by grays and humpbacks were considered to be the primary targets, and the industries were devastating to the stocks as catch quantities had been reduced dramatically in relatively short periods. The effect of the industries were more notable on the whale populations than the later American whaling. This decline of coastal stocks resulted not only in financial solvency of many industrial groups but also in disputes between feudal domains in western Japan that required the intervention of the shogunate. As early as the Edo period, Japanese writers may have tried to call attention to overkill by American and Norwegian whalers, whose hunting practices led to depletion of whale populations, and the tragedy called &quot;Semi-nagare&quot;, an incident in which over 100 Taiji whalers were lost in the ill-timed pursuit of the only two whales they had seen in December 1878. The incident effectively marked the end of traditional Japanese whaling practice.

Some areas of Japan did not whale and opposed whaling, in particular in Northeast Japan where Japanese fishermen believed that whales were an incarnation of the god Ebisu.

===Modernization===
The modernization of Japanese whaling began with the adaptation of Western whaling methods around 1860. In 1861, the Tokugawa shogunate dispatched Nakahama Manjirō to the Bonin Islands on a Western-style schooner to practice whaling in the manner of the Western or &quot;Yankee&quot; whalers that were active in the West Pacific at that time. From whalers that had settled in the Bonin Islands, Manjirō purchased new tools such as the bomb lance, an explosive projectile that was used in whaling.

Norwegian-style modern whaling, based on the use of power-driven vessels, cannons and exploding harpoons, was introduced in the Meiji period largely through the efforts of Jūrō Oka who is considered the &quot;father of modern Japanese whaling&quot;. Oka traveled the world gathering information about whaling practices including to Norway for harpoons, cannons and expertise. He also established the first modern whaling company in Japan in 1899, Nihon Enyo Gyogyo K.K. which took its first whale on February 4, 1900, with a Norwegian gunner, Morten Pedersen.

In the early 20th century, Jūrō Oka dominated the whale meat market in Japan with assistance and instruction from Norwegian whalers and their leased or purchased ships. Another boost was provided by the capture of a Russian whaling fleet and subsequent transfer to Toyo GyoGyo Co. Ltd. As imperial Japan&#x27;s whaling industry expanded into the new territory opened up by their colonization of Korea and Taiwan, Oka&#x27;s company (renamed Toyo Hogei K.K.) returned significant profits to its investors which led to increased Japanese competition. Oka later became the first president of the Japan Whaling and Fishing Association, established in 1908.

Modernization efforts continued through the mid 20th century. Japanese whalers began to operate in specialized whaling fleets consisting of 6 to 10 whale catchers serving a factory ship. Catchers could range as far as 200 miles from their factory ship, communicating by marine VHF radio. Catchers could either deliver the whales directly to the factory ship, or float the whale carcass by inflating it with air and buoying it. The catcher would then mark the whale with radio buoys or radar reflectors to help the factory ship find and retrieve it.

==== Reactions to modernization ====
At the start of the 20th century local traditions conflicted with modern whaling practices. In 1911 the conflict turned violent in Same Village, Aomori Prefecture. Ocean pollution from the whaling stations, including large quantities of oil and blood runoff, angered the local fishermen and threatened their own fishing grounds. In protest the fishermen burned a Toyo Hogei facility down. The people of the Same region also did not consume whales and considered them sacred.

The League of Nations raised concerns about the over-exploitation of whale stocks and called for conservation measures in 1925. This eventually led to the Geneva Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which was presented in 1931 but did not enter into force until 1934 and was completely ignored by Japan and Germany.

Factory ships were not used by Japan until the 1930s. As whale catches diminished in coastal waters, Japan looked to Antarctica. Toyo Hogei K.K. purchased the Norwegian factory ship, &quot;Antarctic,&quot; renaming it the &quot;Tonan Maru&quot; in 1934. Refrigerator ships were sent along to freeze and transport the meat back to Japan. By capitalizing on both the meat and oil of whales, the Japanese industry continued to out-compete other whaling nations. Improvements in technology such as the world&#x27;s first diesel-powered whale catcher, the &quot;Seki Maru&quot;, also increased the capacity to take whales. In the years building up to World War II, the Germans purchased whale oil from Japan and both nations used it in preparation for war.

In 1937 London, the International Conference on Whaling, which Japan did not attend, led to additional limits on pelagic whaling in order to prevent excessive exploitation (and specifically the extinction of the blue whale) creating the International Agreement for the Regulation of Whaling. Regarding voluntary acceptance of restrictions:

Regardless of efforts to establish limits, in part due to Japan ignoring an 89-day season limit and continuing for 125 days, a record 45,010 whales were taken in a single season. The Protocol to the International Agreement for the Regulation of Whaling, signed in 1938, established additional restrictions on whaling.
Despite the attendance of Japanese representatives, Japan did not sign the agreement and started hunting for humpback and undersized whales five weeks prior to the defined start of the season.
By 1939 Germany and Japan accounted for 30% of the world&#x27;s whale take.

In 2016, according to the country&#x27;s Institute for Cetacean Research, Japan&#x27;s whaling fleet has killed 333 minke whales in the part of this year&#x27;s Antarctic whale hunt. Some 230 were female; about 90% of these were pregnant, according to the report.

===World War II===

During the Second World War, Japan&#x27;s whaling was significantly limited to more familiar hunting grounds, such as the Bonin Islands, to provide meat and oil for domestic and military use. Whaling there was halted in March 1945 when the islands were taken by US forces. By November 1945 the whaling stations received permission to reopen; however, most whaling ships had been commandeered by the Imperial Japanese Navy, and by the end of the war the factory ships and most of the whale catchers had been sunk.

General Douglas MacArthur encouraged the surrendered Japan to continue whaling in order to provide a cheap source of meat to starving people (and millions of dollars in oil for the US and Europe). The Japanese whaling industry quickly recovered as MacArthur authorized two tankers to be converted into factory ships, the &quot;Hashidate Maru&quot; and the &quot;Nisshin Maru&quot;. Whale catchers once again took blue whales, fins, humpbacks and sperm whales in the Antarctic and elsewhere.

The first post-war expedition was overseen by a US naval officer, Lieutenant David McCracken, and observed by Australian Kenneth Coonan. Coonan expressed disapproval of McCracken in his reports of violated regulations and waste dumped over the side when the fleet began killing whales faster than they could be processed. McCracken even briefly joined in whaling with the Japanese crew of a whale catcher and detailed the trip in his 1948 book, &quot;Four Months on a Jap Whaler&quot;.

The post-war recovery established whale meat as a nationwide food source for the first time. In 1947 whale meat made up over 50 percent of the meat consumed in Japan. The market significantly increased through commercial sale and public distribution. In 1954, the School Lunch Act also included whale meat in compulsory education (elementary and middle school) to improve the nutrition of Japanese children.

===ICRW and IWC===

The International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling was created in 1946 in Washington to &quot;provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry&quot;. Based on the previous 1937 International Agreement and subsequent Protocols to that agreement in 1938 and 1945, the ICRW led to the 1949 creation of the International Whaling Commission and consists of guidelines for the international regulation of coastal and pelagic whaling. Japan joined the IWC in 1951.

Japan would later make heavy use of one particular article of the ICRW despite the condemnation of environmental organizations and anti-whaling nations.

As the IWC enacted regulation regarding whaling a number of unregulated operations acting outside of the laws of member nations became notorious in the mid-late 20th century. For example, a large private whaling fleet was owned (through a variety of holding companies and flags of convenience) by shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis and gained notoriety for ignoring all limits of size and species. When the Peruvian navy finally stopped and seized the Onassis fleet in 1954, and just as sanctions were to be applied, the entire fleet was sold to Japan for $8.5 million. Onassis&#x27; factory ship, the &quot;Olympic Challenger&quot;, was renamed the &quot;Kyokuyo Maru II&quot;.

The Japanese trawler, &quot;Shunyo-maru&quot;, later became a combined catcher/factory whaling ship, MV &quot;Tonna&quot;, and was owned by Andrew M. Behr who also owned the whaling ship, &quot;Sierra&quot;. The &quot;Tonna&quot; is famous for its demise. In 1978 with full holds the &quot;Tonna&quot; landed another 50 ton fin whale. As the whale was being winched aboard for processing the ship listed over, took on water and quickly sank. Behr and the &quot;Sierra&quot; were also linked to Japan&#x27;s Taiyo Fisheries Co. through a Canadian subsidiary (Taiyo Canada Ltd.) and with whale product for Japanese markets. In July 1979, the &quot;Sierra&quot; was severely damaged after being rammed by activist Paul Watson aboard his ship, the &quot;Sea Shepherd.&quot; The &quot;Sierra&quot; was later (February 1980) sunk in port by unknown saboteurs with limpet mines. Taiyo and other Japanese fisheries have also been linked to whaling through subsidiary companies in Taiwan, the Philippines, Spain, South Korea, Chile and Peru.

===Consolidation===
As quotas and resources were reduced and restrictions increased, the commercial viability of large competing whaling fleets was also diminished. In order to preserve the industry, six Japanese whaling companies negotiated an agreement through the Japan Fisheries Agency in July 1975. The six companies (Nihon Suisan, Taiyo Gyogyo, Kyokuyo, Nitto Hogei, Nihon Hogei and Hokuyo Hogei) merged to create a new company, Nihon Kyodo Hogei Co., Ltd. on February 15, 1976. Former president of the Japan Fisheries Association and former Director-General of the Japan Fisheries Agency, Iwao Fujita, became the first managing director by appointment.

In April 1976, Shintaro Abe, the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, declared government support for the newly formed company.

Nihon Kyodo Hogei Co. Ltd. was later renamed Kyodo Senpaku Co. Ltd. and merged with the Japan Whaling Association and Institute of Cetacean Research to create the modern Institute of Cetacean Research in 1987.

===Moratorium===
In 1972, the United Nations Environmental Conference produced a 52–0 vote in favor of a 10-year global moratorium on commercial whaling. However, the UN resolution was not adopted by the IWC by a vote of 6-no, 4-yes and 4-abstain. Japan, the Soviet Union, Iceland, Norway, South Africa and Panama voted no.

In 1973, a moratorium was once again proposed and voted down in the IWC lacking the required 3/4 majority (8-yes, 5-no, 1-abstain). Japan, the Soviet Union, Iceland, Norway and South Africa voted no. Between 1973 and 1982 the IWC would see its membership increase from 14 nations to 37, perhaps stacking the vote in favor of anti-whaling nations. In 1980 and 1981 two more votes failed to establish a moratorium by a 3/4 majority (13–9–2 and 16–8–3).

In 1982, the IWC finally voted in favor of a moratorium on commercial whaling to go into force in 1986 (25–7–5). Japan objected to the moratorium and continued whaling (&quot;Under the ICRW an objecting nation is exempted from the disputed regulations. Japan also continued to hunt sperm whales despite a 1981 IWC zero catch quota.&quot;). The United States would play a significant role in Japan&#x27;s acceptance of a global moratorium on commercial whaling due to its domestic laws. In particular the 1971 Pelly Amendment to the US Fishermen&#x27;s Protection Act gives the US president legal authority to prohibit importation of fish products from any nation that is diminishing the effectiveness of fisheries conservation programs. It was later strengthened by the 1979 Packwood-Magnuson Amendment to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act giving the same sanctioning power with regard to the ICRW.

Potential US sanctions jeopardized access for Japanese fisheries to Alaskan waters, with an annual catch of a million tonnes of fish (), worth an estimated $425 million per year. A negotiated settlement was reached, allowing Japan to continue commercial whaling without the threat of US sanctions until 1988, with an agreement to drop Japan&#x27;s objection to the moratorium in 1985. However, conservation groups sued the United States Secretary of Commerce, claiming that the law did not allow any deals. That claim was defeated by a US Supreme Court decision in 1986, and, as agreed, Japan withdrew its objection to the moratorium and ceased commercial whaling by 1988. Japan&#x27;s access to Alaskan waters was later phased out anyway, due in part to pressure from US fishermen and conservationists, and also in response to Japan&#x27;s subsequent use of research whaling.

===Research whaling===
In 1976, the quota for Southern Hemisphere Bryde&#x27;s whales was set to zero by the IWC. However, Japan proceeded to take 225 of them during the 76–77 season by issuing itself a permit to take whales for scientific research under Article VIII of the ICRW. Following this event, the IWC recommended all future applications of Article VIII be reviewed by the IWC scientific committee.

In 1986, Japan introduced a similar proposal and later issued itself a scientific permit to take 825 minke whales and 50 sperm whales every year for ten years. Despite the fact that the IWC scientific committee rejected its research proposals, Japan continued whaling.

The IWC adopted a resolution in 1987 recommending Japan not proceed until disagreements over its research proposals were resolved. A second resolution was also adopted on February 14, 1988, recommending Japan not proceed. On February 9, 1988, Japanese whalers killed the first minke whale in Antarctic waters under the new self issued research whaling permit. US President Ronald Reagan responded by cutting off Japanese fishing privileges in US waters on April 6, 1988, under the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment.

Japan has conducted research whaling programs in the North Pacific (JARPN 1994–1999, JARPN II 2000 – present) and in Antarctica (JARPA 1988–2005, JARPA II 2005 – present). The IWC has asked its members that conduct research whaling programs to demonstrate that the research provides critical information, that the research is needed for whale management purposes, and that non-lethal research techniques are not able to provide the same information. The IWC has issued at least 19 resolutions criticizing Japan for failing to meet these conditions and asking it to stop issuing permits.

The current JARPA II permit has been &quot;for 850±10% Antarctic minke whales, 50 fin whales and 50 humpback whales annually. To date, Japan has refrained from taking humpback whales.&quot;

===Normalization===
In 1994, at its 46th annual meeting, the IWC established the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary in a 23–1–8 vote. Commercial whaling is prohibited within the sanctuary boundaries. Only Japan voted in opposition.

As the size of the IWC continued to grow, so did the influence of Japan within the commission. For example, many new Caribbean member nations voted in favor of whaling interests in 2000 including the defeat of a proposed South Pacific Whale Sanctuary. Additional support for whaling was gained in the Pacific, Africa and South-East Asia. As many of these nations received economic aid from Japan, accusations of vote buying were made by anti-whaling groups. In 2001, Japanese fisheries official Masayuki Komatsu stated Japan used overseas development aid as a tool to gain influence.

In 2006, the pro-whaling bloc won a symbolic victory in a non-binding resolution implying the moratorium on commercial whaling was both temporary and unnecessary (33–32–1).

Japan followed with a proposal to &#x27;normalize&#x27; the IWC. In the proposal, Japan&#x27;s representatives claimed the IWC had become dysfunctional in favor of the total elimination of whaling. It also suggested reforms such as the use of secret ballots and increased recognition of cultural differences in the IWC. A Conference for the Normalization of the International Whaling Commission was hosted by Japan in 2007.

After over 50 years of control, Japan&#x27;s center-right conservative party, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), lost in 2009 elections to the opposing left, Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). Environmental organizations had hoped the change in government would bring about an end to Japanese whaling. However, in 2009 the Foreign Minister of Japan, Katsuya Okada, explained that whaling would continue to receive support as a matter of policy.

A 2010 undercover investigation by reporters from the UK&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Times&quot; revealed the officials of many developing countries accepted financial compensation from Japan for support in the IWC. Separate from millions in overseas development aid, membership fees, paid flights, hotel stays and spending money was all provided, by Japan, to gain the support of IWC delegates. In some cases cash was presented in envelopes by Japanese officials. Despite recordings from the investigation, officials implicated in the report have denied accepting bribes in exchange for votes.

Japan ended its 2010–2011 Antarctic hunt early, citing harassment by conservationists. However, it was later announced in October 2011 that the 2011–2012 whale hunt would go on as planned. An Associated Press poll of the Japanese public conducted in July and August 2011 found that 52% of Japanese supported whale hunting, 35% were neutral, and 13% were opposed.

In 2011, at the 63rd meeting of the IWC, Japan demonstrated the progress of its &#x27;normalization&#x27; policy. When South American countries proposed a vote to establish a new whale sanctuary in the South Atlantic Ocean, Japanese delegates led Iceland, several Caribbean countries, and additional representatives in a walkout. As a result, the vote was postponed for one year along with other matters pending consideration by the commission.

===2010 IWC meeting===
At the 2010 meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Morocco, representatives of the 88 member nations discussed whether or not to lift the 24-year ban on commercial whaling. Japan, Norway and Iceland urged the organization to lift the ban. A coalition of anti-whaling nations offered a compromise plan that would allow these countries to continue whaling, but with smaller catches and under close supervision. Their plan would also completely ban whaling in the Southern Ocean. More than 200 scientists and experts opposed the compromise proposal for lifting the ban, and also opposed allowing whaling in the Southern Ocean, which was declared a whale sanctuary in 1994 (Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary).

===Post-ICJ ruling===
Following the temporary cessation of its activities in the Southern Ocean during 2014, Japan announced a research plan for the &quot;New Scientific Whale Research Program in the Antarctic Ocean&quot; in late November 2014, as a replacement of previous programs. In March 2014, the ICJ ruled that the new program&#x27;s predecessor was &quot;not for the purposes of scientific research&quot;. The replacement &quot;NEWREP-A&quot; plan, scheduled to commence in December 2015, covered a larger area of the Southern Ocean around the Antarctic, and 3,996 whales were to be targeted over 12 years, which is fewer than in previous seasons.

The plan was submitted to the IWC and its scientific commission, but approval was not required from either for Japan to proceed. The ICJ ruling did not prevent Japan from undertaking further whale research activities in the Antarctic region, but, in accordance with the ICJ&#x27;s decision, NEWREP-A needed to sufficiently meet two objectives:

#Improvement of both biological and ecological data on Antarctic minke whales.
#Investigation of the structure and dynamics of the Antarctic marine ecosystem through the development of ecosystem models.

Japan stipulated that it will only kill whales if non-lethal methods of data collection and biopsy sampling fail to meet the plan&#x27;s objectives. Furthermore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) has declared that information on the number of Antarctic minke whale &quot;data deficient&quot;. In early October 2015, Japan&#x27;s ambassador to the UN, Motohide Yoshikawa, announced that Japan does not accept the court&#x27;s jurisdiction over research, conservation, or exploitation of marine life and would proceed with NEWREP-A, without waiting for the court&#x27;s approval. On December 1, 2015, Japan sent a fleet to the Antarctic Ocean with the aim of hunting 330 minke whales. The fleet included the ship the &quot;Nisshin Maru&quot; and three smaller boats. The move was met with objections from the Australian and New Zealand governments.

===2018 Florianopolis Declaration===
On September 13, 2018, IWC members gathered in Florianópolis, Brazil, where they discussed and rejected a proposal by Japan to renew commercial whaling. Through the &quot;Florianopolis Declaration&quot;, it was concluded that the purpose of the IWC is the conservation of whales and that they would now safeguard the marine mammals in perpetuity and would allow the recovery of all whale populations to pre-industrial whaling levels. The non-binding agreement was backed by 40 countries, with 27 pro-whaling states voting against. Under this resolution, limited hunts by some indigenous communities are still permitted.

On December 26, 2018, Japan announced that since the IWC failed its duty to promote sustainable hunting, which is one of its stated goals, Japan is withdrawing its membership and will resume commercial hunting in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone from July 1, 2019, but will cease whaling activities in the Antarctic Ocean. While the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was cautious against leaving the IWC, the move was spearheaded by Toshihiro Nikai, a member of the Japanese National Diet and then-current secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party. Nikai&#x27;s electorate includes the town of Taiji, Wakayama. On July 1, 2019, two minke whales, the first catch after the resumption of commercial whaling were unloaded at Kushiro port in Hokkaido.

==Production==

Until 2018, Japanese whaling was conducted in both pelagic (open-ocean) areas in the North Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean near Antarctica. Coastal waters are also utilized for small-type coastal whaling of dolphins and other small cetaceans. Large and small whales are sometimes taken as bycatch in the nets of Japanese fishing vessels as well.

===Pelagic whaling===
Japan&#x27;s pelagic whaling fleet, which annually hunts large whales in the Southern Ocean, consists of a number of ships for hunting and processing whale catch as well as securing the hunt against protests. During the 2009–10 season, the Japanese fleet included a factory ship, four whale catchers and two security patrol vessels. The Japanese self-imposed quota includes 935 minke, 50 fin and 50 humpback whales per season.

When whales are spotted the whale catchers will engage in pursuit. A harpoon cannon with a grenade tipped harpoon is fired at the target whale. A rope is trailed from the harpoon in order to prevent the whale from being lost. If the whale is struck and not killed instantly by the explosive tipped harpoon, a second harpoon may be used or the whale may be shot with a rifle until dead. A past method of using a second harpoon to electrocute whales is now forbidden by the IWC. Environmental groups have reported whales being dragged backward and drowned.

Each caught whale is secured to the side of a whale catcher with rope. Lines are later used to transfer the whales from the whale catcher to the factory ship. Whales are next winched onto the factory ship through a slipway at the stern of the vessel. On the flensing deck several workers use specialized tools to butcher the whale. Usable product is delivered to the lower decks of the ship for further processing and refrigerated storage. Non usable product is dumped back into the ocean.

Additional regulations from the United Nations International Maritime Organization took effect on August 1, 2011, prohibiting ships using heavy oil from navigation in the Antarctic Treaty System area to prevent pollution. The IMO &quot;Guidelines For Ships Operating In Ice-Covered Waters&quot; also establishes requirements for a double-hull strengthened against ice-related damage. The Japanese factory ship &quot;Nisshin Maru&quot; does not currently meet these IMO standards.

===Small-type coastal whaling===

Coastal fishing fleets that hunt dolphins use many small boats in a coordinated effort. The fishermen bang metal poles in the water in order to frighten and therefore guide noise-sensitive dolphins toward the shore. A series of nets are then used to corral the dolphins in. Divers and fishermen in boats next lance or cut the throats of the dolphins and haul them away to a nearby shore station for processing. A few dolphins are selected for sale to aquariums and spared for the marine aquarium (dolphinarium) entertainment industry.

The practice of dolphin drive hunting in Taiji, Japan was the subject of a 2009 documentary film entitled &quot;The Cove&quot;.

Japanese whalers have hunted Baird&#x27;s beaked whales on the Bōsō Peninsula, Wada, since the 17th century. Once landed just off the coast of Japan, the beaked whales are pulled onto a landing station with ropes and then butchered for sale. The meat is sold as food and the rest is sold to be used as organic fertilizer.

In May 2007 the IWC rejected a proposal to expand coastal catches. The quota was limited to a total of 66 whales between four whaling towns. The whalers of Wada encourage local children to attend the first butchering of each season followed by a community event where whale meat is served.

According to the Japan Fisheries Agency up to 20,000 dolphins of several species will be taken, in many locations along the coast of Japan, over the course of a six-month season. Coastal whaling communities suffered significant damage as a result of the earthquake and tsunami disaster in March 2011.

===Bycatch===
In 2009, published DNA analysis of whale meat from Japanese markets suggested as many as 150 large whales from vulnerable coastal stocks were taken annually as bycatch. Japan legally allows the commercial sale of whales caught incidentally, entangled in fishing nets designed to catch coastal fish. Market surveys also detected migratory whales such as the endangered Humpback and endangered Gray whales, as well as the threatened Finback whale, and the non-endangered Bryde&#x27;s whales.

The impact on J-stock whales, which have protected status under the IWC, seemingly increased with changes in Japanese regulations that legalized the sale of bycatch in 2001. Between 1997 and 2000 only 19–29 whales were annually reported caught as bycatch. The number increased to 89 – 137 annually between 2001 and 2004. However, the study concluded from genetic information that the actual amount of bycatch was similarly high prior to the 2001 regulations but was under-reported. Up to 46% of the samples tested proved to be J-stock.

Prior to the 2001 change in regulations, fishermen could not legally sell minke whales to commercial firms and were supposed to sell them locally or destroy them and report the incident. The high percentage of J-stock bycatch presents a significant threat including the possibility of extinction within a few decades according to IWC population estimates.

===Whaling in coastal Japan===
In Japan, several whale species have been targets of illegal captures, including humpback, minke, sperm whales, western gray, the endangered North Pacific right, and northern fin whale while utilizing harpoons for dolphin hunts or intentionally drive whales into nets. Reports are later filed with administrative organs or research institutions as cases of entanglements where fishermen tried their best to save whales. As of 2005, products from internationally protected species&#x27; meat can also be found on markets mostly originating as &quot;by-products&quot; of entanglements, and there has been a case in which it was revealed that at least some humpbacks with other species were illegally hunted in EEZs of anti-whaling nations such as off the coast of Mexico or South Africa, and the whalers tried to transport the catch to Japan by hiring vessels from other countries and even trying to go on overland routes within other nations.

===Imports===
In 2009, Japan accepted imports of whale meat from Norway and Iceland for the first time in over a decade. The Norwegian shipment arrived in mid-2008 but was held by Japanese customs until January 2009 when the Japan Fisheries Agency finally approved the import.

The international trade of whale meat is prohibited by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). However, Japan, Norway and Iceland registered reservations with the treaty in order to remain exempt. The Norwegian company, Myklebust Trading, exports common minke whale and Iceland&#x27;s Hvalur hf exports Fin whale, which is a vulnerable species. Environmental organizations criticized the trade and expressed doubts that Japanese markets could absorb the increase in supply as thousands of tonnes of whale meat remained in cold storage in Japan. In 2010, Iceland&#x27;s proposed quota in killing fin whales was much larger than the amount of whale meat the Japanese market could absorb. In negotiations with Marc Wall, Economic Minister-Counselor at the US embassy in Tokyo, Jun Yamashita of the Japanese Fisheries Agencies, however, rejected a 2010 proposal to suggest to Iceland to reduce the number of killed fin whales to a more reasonable number.

===Disputes among the public in Japan===
The first whale watching in Japan was conducted in the Bonin Islands in 1998 by a group called Geisharen (), which was formed by groups of domestic and international people including both domestic and international celebrities and notable cetacean researchers and conservationists such as Roger Payne, Erich Hoyt, Richard Oliver, Jim Darling, John Ford, Kyusoku Iwamoto (cartoonist), Hutoushiki Ueki (science writer), Nobuyuki Miyazaki (head chief of the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute of The University of Tokyo), Nobuaki Mochizuki (one of the world&#x27;s first whale photographers to record a living North Pacific right whale underwater in 1990 in Bonin Islands), Junko Sakuma (freelancer), and so on. During the time leading up until the group reaching the destination, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan) as well as anonymous groups and individuals watched the group&#x27;s movements and threatened them not to conduct the tour. Prior to this movement, those who claimed conserving marine mammals including pinnipeds, or individuals who tried to correct illegal and over-extensive hunts (including C. W. Nicol who was a sympathizer to Japan&#x27;s whaling industries) or domestic medias that have done reporting assignments in Japan had been discriminated. Some of these including former fishermen who were ostracized in their communities later became whale-watching operators. Several other tours have been operated by former whalers or dolphin hunters such as at Abashiri, Muroto, and so on.

==Scientific research==

Scientific whaling is accepted under the Article VIII of the convention of IWC. The Article VIII claims that each member nation can grant its nationals a permit to take or kill whales for scientific purposes. Dissimilar from the international regulations on commercial and aboriginal whaling, the scientific researches and the number of whales killed for scientific purposes are unilateral. Although the Scientific Committee (SC) of the IWC attempted to provide expert assessment of national research plans, the nations carrying out scientific whaling, especially Japan, still use scientific whaling as an alibi for their excess in whaling.

After halting its commercial whaling in 1986, Japan began scientific research hunts to provide a basis for the resumption of sustainable whaling. According to environmental groups and the Australian Environment Minister, the ostensible research serves to disguise commercial whaling in circumvention of the IWC moratorium. The IWC Scientific Committee collects up-to-date data on catch limits and catches taken since 1985. Numbers have ranged from less than 200 in 1985 to close to 1,000 in 2007.

The research is conducted by the Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR), a privately owned, non-profit institution. The institute receives its funding from government subsidies and Kyodo Senpaku, which handles processing and marketing of the whale meat. Japan carried out its &quot;scientific&quot; whaling in two areas: the North-West Pacific Ocean (JARPN II) and the Antarctic Ocean (JARPA) Southern Hemisphere catch. The 2007/08 JARPA mission had a self-imposed quota of 900 minke whales and 50 fin whales.

On March 31, 2014, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) stated its decision (by 12–4 votes) that Japan&#x27;s whaling program was not for scientific purposes. The Court ordered that &quot;Japan revoke any extant authorization, permit or licence to kill, take or treat whales&quot; and refrain from granting any further permits.

===Catches===

===JARPA===
The JARPA research program took place near Antarctica from 1988 to 2005. Its stated objectives were to determine mortality rates, whale stock numbers and structure, the role of whales in the Antarctic ecosystem and how environmental changes affect whales. The whaling operation alternated between several pre-established areas intending to take 400 or more minke whales per season.

In 1997 the IWC scientific committee officially reviewed the JARPA program. The committee expected reasonable precision and usefulness of the data collected but disagreed on whether lethal methods were necessary. It was also noted that the results could potentially allow for an increase in the number of minke whales annually taken.

In the final 2007 review, the committee agreed with the initial 1997 mid assessment. It recognized that progress had been made in identifying stock structure and at least two stocks were found in the research area. Agreed estimates of abundance could not be developed and preliminary estimates may only reflect major changes in abundance over a long time line. Problems were identified with age and mortality rate data. Krill-related work was welcomed but relatively little progress was made toward understanding the role of whales in the Antarctic ecosystem. Data on pollution was also welcomed but disagreement continued over the interpretation of the results. Levels of toxic pollutants were lower in Antarctic whales than those sampled in the Northern hemisphere.

The commission made note of the fact that the catches took place in the IWC established Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary and that improving management of whaling in a sanctuary is unnecessary. The 2007-1 resolution on JARPA was one of several calling on Japan by majority vote to suspend its lethal research.

===JARPA II===
Like its predecessor, the JARPA II research whaling program took place near Antarctica. Starting in 2005 until 2018, the stated objectives included monitoring the Antarctic ecosystem, modeling competition between whale species, recording changes in stock structure and improving future management of Antarctic whales. The program calls for 950 minke whales, 50 fin whales and 50 humpback whales annually.

Disagreement over the value of the research, the use of lethal methods and the sample sizes continued in both the scientific committee and the commission. In 2005 and 2007 the commission passed resolutions by majority urging Japan to stop all lethal research in JARPA II.

On March 31, 2014, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that JARPA II was not for scientific purposes and forbade the granting of further permits. Following the ruling, Japan cancelled its Antarctic whaling hunt for the first time in more than 25 years, though it announced plans to propose a new research program designed to meet the standards set by the ICJ the following year.

===JARPN===
From 1994 to 1999 Japan carried out its research program JARPN in the western North Pacific. Its stated goals were to improve knowledge of stock identity, improve implementation simulation trials for North Pacific common minke whales and act as a feasibility study for a program on feeding ecology. The program called for 100 minke whales annually. The results were reviewed by the committee in February 2000. The committee agreed that the information was useful for management but no consensus was reached on whether lethal methods of research were necessary.

As with JARPA, the IWC issued resolutions calling for Japan to cease issuing permits for the take of minke whales citing concerns over the need for lethal methods such as the 1999-3 Resolution on whaling under Special Permit.

===JARPN II===
JARPN II began with a feasibility study from 2000 to 2001 to continue taking whales in the western North Pacific Ocean including 100 common minke whales, 50 Bryde&#x27;s whales and 10 sperm whales. The objectives of the program included study of feeding ecology (such as prey consumption), stock structure and the environmental impacts of cetaceans. In 2002 after the completion of the initial study, Japan proposed and began a long-term program to study how feeding ecology relates to sustainable use in the Pacific and within Japan&#x27;s exclusive economic zone. In 2008 the program included a proposal for an annual take of 340 minke whales, 50 Bryde&#x27;s whales, 100 sei and 10 sperm whales.

Disagreement over the objectives, methodology, effect on stocks and overall success of the program continued in the scientific committee review of the feasibility study and full program. The full program introduced a change from previous use of the ICRW Article VIII research provision by not specifying an end date. The objectives were deemed unnecessary for stock management by some members, and that it would not contribute significantly to previously identified research needs. The sample size and methods proposed were unlikely to satisfy the program objectives, and the ecosystem modeling was considered to be poorly developed.

Some contended the program placed undue emphasis on assumed negative effects of cetacean predation on fishery resources while failing to address the effects of fisheries on cetaceans. However, others believed determining the effects of cetaceans on fish stocks and more information on minke stock structure to be critically important. Some stated the feasibility study would provide valuable information on methodology and other aspects of the program would improve over time and contribute to fundamental questions. The committee identified that the pollution objective did not contribute to the goals of the IWC Pollution 2000+ project but remained relevant to the IWC for long-term study.

Disagreement over the value of data obtained through lethal methods continued as well. Some argued that a wide range of questions could be answered through non-lethal means such as &quot;for pollutant monitoring (biopsy sampling for fatty acid and stable isotope analysis), for stock structure (photo identification, biopsy sampling and faecal sampling), and for feeding ecology (faecal sampling).&quot; Others argued that prey data was required for modeling purposes that could not be acquired through non-lethal means. However, feeding ecology was not necessarily relevant to stock management according to some who argued biopsy sampling would allow for a greater amount of statistical data.

Argument continued over the potential negative effects of catches, such as depletion of O-stock and J-stock whales, when the only data on many of the populations came from selective extrapolations of JSV (survey) data. Proponents contended that the JSV data was reliable and the research area extended from coastal areas to offshore areas thus limiting pressure on coastal stocks.

In 2000, 2001 and 2003 more resolutions were passed by the IWC urging Japan to cease issuing special permits for whaling and limit research to non-lethal methods. Another Scientific Committee review was conducted in January 2009.

===Publications===
Over 120 publications have resulted from the lethal and non-lethal research conducted during the JARPA programs. Many of these articles are published in international peer-reviewed scientific journals, and some have both Japanese and non-Japanese scientists as co-authors. However, after killing 3,600 minke whales, the program produced just two peer-reviewed scientific papers since 2005. The presiding judge of the International Court of Justice ruled on March 31, 2014, that &quot;In light of the fact the Jarpa II has been going on since 2005, and has involved the killing of about 3,600 minke whales, the scientific output to date appears limited, Japan shall revoke any existent authorisation, permit or licence granted in relation to Jarpa II and refrain from granting any further permits in pursuance to the program.&quot;

In 2008, a study based on data gathered by JARPA research was published in a peer-reviewed Western academic journal, &quot;Polar Biology&quot;. The study, for which 4704 whales were killed, implied that Antarctic minke whales lost 9% of their blubber over 18 years due to a lack of ocean resources such as krill. Lars Walløe, a Norwegian of the University of Oslo, assisted with analyzing the data and claimed the study was first rejected by two other journals for political reasons. Nick Gales, of the Australian Antarctic Division, stated the study failed to address criticisms of its methodology when initially presented. The study contradicted previous JARPA studies indicating Antarctic minke whale populations were healthy.

==Resumption of commercial whaling==
Following the September 2018 Florianopolis Declaration where the IWC rejected Japan&#x27;s latest commercial hunt proposal, and concluded that the purpose of the IWC is the conservation of whales, Japan withdrew its IWC membership on December 26, 2018. It then resumed commercial hunting in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone on July 1, 2019, but ceased whaling activities in the Antarctic Ocean.

Japan expects to hunt 227 minke whales by the end of 2019, but without government subsidies, their whaling industry is not expected to survive. A subsidy of 5.1 billion yen (US$47.31 million) was budgeted for commercial whaling in 2019.

==Controversy==

Anti-whaling governments and groups have strongly opposed Japan&#x27;s whaling program. Greenpeace argues that whales are endangered and must be protected.
The Japanese government claims that it strongly supports the protection of endangered species, and the scientific whaling is essential to gather information about the status of the various populations. It further claims that the scale of the research is such that it does not affect the stock of the species. The 1985 IWC estimate put the Southern Hemisphere minke whale population at 761,000 (510,000–1,140,000 in the 95% confidence estimate). A paper submitted to the IWC on population estimates in Antarctic waters using CNB gives a population of 665,074 based on Southern Ocean Whale and Ecosystem Research Programme (SOWER) data.

Research methodology has come under scrutiny as it has been argued that non-lethal methods of research are available and that Japan&#x27;s research whaling is commercial whaling in disguise. The Japanese claim that the accuracy of tissue and feces samples is insufficient and lethal sampling is necessary.

In 2002, the World Wildlife Fund published an open letter to the Japanese (in both Japanese and English text) in &quot;the New York Times&quot; signed by a group of international scientists, stating their assertion that &quot;Japan&#x27;s whale &#x27;research&#x27; program fails to meet minimum standards for credible science&quot;. They accused Japan of &quot;using the pretense of scientific research to evade its commitments to the world community.&quot; Signatories to the letter included Sylvia Earle (former Chief Scientist of the NOAA), Giuseppe Notarbartolo di Sciara (former President of the European Cetacean Society) and Roger Payne (founder of the Ocean Alliance).

In Volume 53, No. 3 of the journal &quot;BioScience&quot;, twenty members of the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission confirmed &quot;that the signers of the open letter correctly summarized criticisms made by researchers very familiar with Japanese scientific whaling&quot;, and that &quot;so little of any significance to IWC management can be obtained only from whaling catches that it is impossible to justify killing animals on this basis.&quot;

A 2006 episode of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s popular science show &quot;Catalyst&quot;, which strongly argued against whaling, reported that of the 18 year JARPA I program, which lethally obtained samples from 6800 whales, less than 55 peer-reviewed papers were produced, of which only 14 were claimed on the program to be relevant to the goals of the JARPA program, and that only four would require lethal sampling. Some of the research includes a paper named &quot;Fertilizability of ovine, bovine, and minke whales spermatozoa intracytoplasmically injected into bovine oocytes&quot;. Joji Morishita of JARPA has said the number of samples was required in order to obtain statistically significant data.

Sea Shepherd Conservation Society contends that Japan, as well as Iceland and Norway, is in violation of the IWC moratorium on all commercial whaling.

Anti-whaling campaigners claim that the Japanese public does not support the government for its whaling policy. However, all the major political parties from the right wing LDP to the Japanese Communist Party do support whaling. The meat ends up at Tokyo&#x27;s famed Tsukiji fish market and other high-end restaurants. People previously involved in the industry have reported rampant meat embezzlement.

Japanese fisheries companies have expanded abroad and experienced pressure from partners and environmental groups. Five large fishing companies transferred their whaling fleet shares to public interest corporations in 2006.
In 2007, Kyokuyo and Maruha, two of Japan&#x27;s four largest fishing companies, decided to end their sales of whale meat due to pressure from partners and environmental groups in the US.

The International Court of Justice ruled in March 2014 that Japan can no longer conduct its JARPA II program, rejecting the country&#x27;s argument that it was for scientific purposes. All findings in the judgement refer specifically to the JARPA II program in the Antarctic, so the JARPN program in the NW Pacific is not affected.

In November 2014, Japan announced that it would resume hunting whales in the Southern Ocean, but that it would reduced its catch target by two-thirds. Japan&#x27;s Fisheries Agency said that Japan intends to catch 333 minke whales each year between 2015 and 2027, down from 935 minke and 50 fin whales. It said the hunts were needed for collecting scientific data and were exempt from a 1986 international ban on commercial whaling, despite the ICJ ruling.

===Cultural aspects===
Japanese have a long history of whaling. Some towns can show their whaling history for hundreds of years. This history plays an important role to answer the question why the Japanese have kept hunting whales in recent years. Attempts to stop the nation&#x27;s whaling are perceived as a threat to Japanese culture because eating whale meat is an aspect of Japanese tradition. &quot;No one has the right to criticize the food culture of another people,&quot; said Matayuki Komatsu of Japan&#x27;s Fisheries Agency.

Proponents of Japanese whaling (including the government of Japan) often argue that it is a cultural practice which foreigners should not oppose on the basis of cultural differences. Joji Morishita of Japanese Fisheries Agency in 2001 noted that the Japanese public also feels that anti-whaling groups are covertly racist. With Norway and Iceland hunting whales on a commercial basis, according to Morishita, &quot;Singling out [Japan&#x27;s] whaling is cultural imperialism – some people would say it&#x27;s racism. Norway and Iceland are also whalers, but the criticism of Japan is stronger.&quot; However, critics have forcibly attacked the &quot;cultural defense&quot;, with for example Sea Shepherd Conservation Society representatives comparing it to forced female genital cutting in Sudan, saying that although it is a practice that may have cultural roots, it still should be opposed out of necessity. A professor of environmental studies in Japan wrote in his book that Japan&#x27;s modern commercial whaling bears little resemblance to the small-scale subsistence whaling that, until the dawn of the 20th century, was limited to certain coastal regions, and Japan&#x27;s whale-eating culture was also very limited in scope and an invented tradition, only lasting 20 years from the end of World War II to the early 1960s to augment Japanese school lunch programs during the U.S. occupation.
===Debate in the IWC===

The most vocal opponents of the Japanese push for a resumption of commercial whaling are Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The Australian government&#x27;s stated purpose for opposing whaling is the need for conservation of endangered species. The New Zealand government is opposed to hunting whales for food or research and the UK government believes &quot;that whaling does not serve any genuine need and involves unacceptable cruelty.&quot;

In July 2004, it was reported that a working group of the Japan&#x27;s ruling Liberal Democratic had drawn up plans to leave the IWC in order to join a new pro-whaling organization, NAMMCO, because of the IWC&#x27;s refusal to back the principle of sustainable commercial whaling. Japan is particularly opposed to the IWC Conservation Committee, introduced in 2003, which it says exists solely to prevent any whaling. Any directives from the IWC are undertaken on a purely voluntary basis as state sovereignty means that there are few avenues by which international law can be enforced.

At an International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in 2006, a resolution calling for the eventual return of commercial whaling was passed by a majority of just one vote. There has been a failure to lift the ban on commercial whale hunting and Japan has since threatened to leave the IWC until the whaling moratorium has ended.

In 2007 the IWC passed a resolution asking Japan to refrain from issuing a permit for lethal research in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary – the main Japanese whaling area. After a visit to Tokyo by the chairman of the IWC, asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and anti-whaling nations on the commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed that no humpback whales would be caught for the two years it would take for the IWC to reach a formal agreement.

On March 31, 2014, the ICJ ruled that &quot;Japan must revoke any extant authorization, permit or licence to kill, take or treat whales&quot; in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary and refrain from granting any further permits. Following that ruling, Japan proposed to launch a &quot;reviewed&quot; research hunt. In response, the IWC voted and concluded on September 18, 2014, that &quot;Japan should abide by an International Court of Justice ruling&quot;, but Japanese officials vowed to continue whale hunting in the Antarctic in 2015.

===Australian opposition===

Due to the proximity to Antarctica, the government of Australia has been particularly vocal in its opposition to Japan&#x27;s whaling activity in the Southern Pacific. In 1994, Australia claimed a exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around the Australian Antarctic Territory, which also includes a southerly portion of the IWC Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.
In December 2007, the Rudd government announced plans to monitor Japanese whalers about to enter Australian waters in order to gather evidence for a possible international legal challenge and on January 8, 2008, the Australian government sent the Australian customs vessel &quot;Oceanic Viking&quot; on a 20-day surveillance mission to track and monitor the fleet. On February 7, 2008, the Australian government released photographs of the ICR harpoon ship &quot;Yūshin Maru&quot; killing several different whales, and a mother whale and her 1-year-old calf being taken on board the &quot;Nisshin Maru&quot; for processing (see photos at right and top of page). The Australian government also used that opportunity to reject ICR&#x27;s scientific research claims by calling them &quot;without foundation&quot;, and declaring that &quot;You do not have to kill a whale in the Southern Ocean to gain a deeper understanding of it.&quot;

In late 2009, the Prime Minister of Australia restated official objections to Japan&#x27;s whaling programs and threatened to take legal action through international courts.

====ICJ case====
On May 31, 2010, the Australian Government lodged formal proceedings against Japan in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, Netherlands. In a joint ministerial statement, the government stated that it &quot;has not taken this decision lightly.&quot;

On January 5, 2011, leaked US diplomatic cables revealed that the Australian legal challenge to Japanese whaling was heavily influenced by domestic political pressures and Australian government advisers were left deeply pessimistic about the prospects of success in the International Court. In its reports to Washington, the US Embassy reported that Australian government contacts were stating that the legal proceedings &quot;would be unlikely to stop the whale hunt entirely, but could well force modifications that would make it more difficult for the Japanese&quot;. The Australian public overwhelmingly supports governmental efforts to stop Japanese whaling, even at risk of losing valuable trade relations. The New Zealand government lodged a &quot;Declaration of Intervention&quot; with the ICJ on February 6, 2013, in which it deemed Japan as ineligible for a Special Permit that would allow whaling on the basis of scientific research.

As a result of the Australian government&#x27;s 2010 application, a court case was heard at the ICJ. The hearing ran from June 26, 2013, until July 6, 2013. In its deposition to the ICJ, the Australian government has claimed that Japan &quot;has breached and is continuing to breach&quot; its obligations under the international convention, and further asserted that Japan has refused to accept IWC recommendations. Solicitor-General of Australia Justin Gleeson appeared for Australia before the ICJ.

The ICJ&#x27;s 16-judge bench received and then decided upon the case. Rothwell stated that the case &quot;is a complex one which raises novel legal issues not previously considered by any international court&quot;.

Tony Press, CEO of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre at the University of Tasmania, Australia, provided weekly reports of the ICJ hearings for &quot;The Conversation Australia&quot; media publication. Following the second week, Press relayed that Japan articulated in certain terms its intentions in the Southern Ocean: &quot;the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry&quot;, further explaining that a whale must be killed to obtain certain types of information, such as the collection of ear plugs to estimate the age of a whale. During the second week, Professor Lars Walløe, of the University of Oslo and a former Norwegian Commissioner to the Whaling Commission was presented by Japan as its sole expert witness.

During the week beginning July 8, 2013, New Zealand delivered its intervention, in which it provided a history of the origin of the 1946 Whaling Convention and Australian Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus affirmed that his nation had not &quot;colluded&quot; with New Zealand to launch the ICJ proceedings. Dreyfus concluded Australia&#x27;s contribution by emphasizing the friendship shared by Australia and Japan, and stated: &quot;Australia respectfully requests the Court to bring Japan’s whaling program to an end.&quot;

The ICJ hearing concluded on July 16, 2013. In Japan&#x27;s final presentation Professor Payam Akhavan of McGill University stated: &quot;&quot;it would not be an exaggeration to say that Australia’s case now hangs by a thread&quot;.

On March 31, 2014, the ICJ ruled that Japan&#x27;s whaling program was not for scientific purposes. The Court ordered that &quot;Japan revoke any extant authorization, permit or licence to kill, take or treat whales&quot; and refrain from granting any further permits. The court&#x27;s judges agreed with Australia that the number of Japanese scientific research publications were not proportionate to the number of animals killed. Two former Australian Environment ministers applauded the decision and stated their hopes that Japan would respect it. The decision of the ICJ is final and the right of appeal does not apply in this context.

Japanese officials confirmed their nation&#x27;s recognition of the ICJ decision in March 2014, whereby the ruling would be upheld. A media report, published in September 2014, reported on the intention of Japanese officials to submit a revised programme to the IWC&#x27;s scientific committee in November 2014.

===Opposition by environmental groups===

The Japanese whaling fleet had several clashes with anti-whaling protesters and activists from various groups, including the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, endeavoring to follow, document and disrupt the whaling fleet since the 2005–2006 season. On January 15, 2008, two crew members traveling on the MV &quot;Steve Irwin&quot; boarded the whaling ship &quot;Yushin Maru 2&quot; without permission and were subsequently detained on board the ship for a number of days. Japan claimed that four crew members on board a Japanese whaling ship in Antarctic waters were injured March 3, 2008, when the anti-whaling group threw butyric acid on board.

Japan confirmed the later throwing of &quot;flashbang&quot; grenades onto the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society ship, MV &quot;Steve Irwin&quot; by their whaling factory ship, &quot;Nisshin Maru&quot;. Japan also confirmed firing a &quot;warning shot&quot; into the air. The captain of the &quot;Steve Irwin&quot;, Paul Watson, claimed to have been hit in the chest by a bullet from a Japanese whaling ship crewmember, and a piece of metal was found lodged into his bullet-proof vest he was wearing at the time. However, the Japanese government has denied the incident, but admitted that the whalers launched &quot;noise balls&quot;, described as &quot;loud explosive deterrent devices&quot;. On February 7, 2009, the MV &quot;Steve Irwin&quot; and the &quot;Yushin Maru No. 2&quot; collided as the Japanese vessel was attempting to transfer a whale. Both sides claimed the other had been at fault.

In 2008, two Greenpeace anti-whaling activists, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, also called the Tokyo Two were arrested and put on trial after trying to expose what they considered a theft ring within the whaling industry. An investigation was conducted into these practices, but was shortly ended concluding that the meat was taken as a souvenir and thus legal to possess. After his trial, Sato, Greenpeace Japan&#x27;s Director of Oceans Campaign said that Greenpeace is moving away from a confrontational strategy and is using words to persuade Japan to end the hunts. He feels that outside groups do not have a good understanding of Japanese culture which can result in some actions having counter-productive results.

In January 2010, it was revealed that the Japanese whaling fleet was chartering flights in Australian planes from Hobart and Albany to track the Sea Shepherd ships&#x27; movements and provide information on their location to the whaling fleet so the fleet could evade them. The flights were heavily criticised by the Australian Greens.

On January 6, 2010, the anti-whaling ship &quot;MY Ady Gil&quot; suffered severe damage to its bow after a collision with the Japanese whaling ship &quot;Shōnan Maru No. 2&quot;. The Ady Gil was abandoned and left to sink after it had taken on too much water to be towed. While the first officer of the Bob Barker has said that all the fuel, oil, batteries and other environmental contaminates were removed from the Ady Gil before towing began, photographic evidence released by the Institute for Cetacean Research showed the wreckage continued to leak fuel into the Southern Ocean after it had been abandoned by Sea Shepherd.

Japan&#x27;s Fisheries Agency announced on April 12, 2010, that the whaling fleet had caught about half of the 935 whales it has hoped to catch during the 2009–2010 whaling research season as a result of obstruction by Sea Shepherd Conservation Society protest operations. The whalers harvested 506 southern minke whales and one fin whale. In February 2011, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society caused Japan to call off annual whaling in Antarctic waters.

Atsushi Ishii, Japanese political scientist and professor at Tohoku University&#x27;s Center for Northeast Asian Studies stated in his 2011 book &quot;Kaitai Shinso: Hogei Ronso&quot; (&quot;Anatomy of the Whaling Debate&quot;), that Japan used the activities by conservationists like Sea Shepherd as a face-saving excuse to stop the unprofitable Antarctic hunt. Ishii asserts that the activities of environmental and animal rights activists were actually counterproductive because they fueled nationalism and increased the demand for whale meat in Japan. Ishii predicted that Japan would shift its whale hunting efforts to coastal waters and the Northwest Pacific.

In December 2011, The Japanese government confirmed that US$29 million out of their supplementary post-earthquake and tsunami reconstruction budget was spent to provide extra security to ensure the &quot;stable operation&quot; of the Japanese whaling fleet.

After a lengthy legal case in the United States, the Sea Shepherd agreed not to harass Japan&#x27;s whaling ships in August 2016, specifically not to physically attack Japan&#x27;s whaling vessels or crew, nor to approach within 500 yards of the vessels on the high seas. Sea Shepherd&#x27;s Australian branch however said they were not affected by the court ruling since the US court had no jurisdiction over Australian law.

===International opposition===
On March 6, 2008, members of the International Whaling Commission met in London to discuss reaching an agreement on whale conservation rules. Japanese whalers and anti-whaling activists clashed in the waters near Antarctica on March 7, 2008, with each side offering conflicting accounts of the confrontation. The IWC called upon the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society to refrain from dangerous actions and reiterated its condemnation of any actions that are a risk to human life and property in relation to the activities of vessels at sea.

Japan has continued to face accusations of vote-buying within the IWC, as an increasing number of developing countries with little or no tradition of whaling join. On March 8, 2008, Solomon Islands&#x27; Prime Minister Derek Sikua said that Japan had offered to pay for his country&#x27;s delegates to attend the March 6, 2008, IWC meeting in London, and that he had refused the offer. The whaling chief at Japan&#x27;s Fisheries Agency denied the allegation. A week before that IWC meeting, Japan hosted delegates from Angola, Cambodia, DR Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ghana, Laos, Malawi, Palau, Tanzania and Vanuatu in Tokyo. The delegates also visited the traditional whaling town of Taiji in western Japan.

===Commercial viability===
Due to its low food self-sufficiency rate, around 40%, Japan relies on stockpiling to secure a stable food supply. As of 2009, Japan&#x27;s 1.2 million ton seafood stockpile included nearly 5000 tons of whale meat. In 2005, the Japanese government began encouraging public schools to serve whale meat in school lunches as part of an initiative to reduce the country&#x27;s stockpiles. A reported 18 percent of public elementary and junior high schools offering lunches served whale meat at least once during the 2009/2010 fiscal year. However, there has been criticism of serving whale meat to school children due to allegations of toxic methylmercury levels. The World Wildlife Fund has also estimated that the Japanese government has had to invest $12 million into the 2008–09 Antarctic whale hunt alone just to break even, and that subsidies in total have amounted to about $150 million since 1988.

One study found levels of mercury in whale red meat at six times the limit set by the US FDA for food. Whale meat can also be contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls. Critics claim that, because of contamination, it constitutes a health risk. Thus children and pregnant women are advised to refrain from eating whale meat. On April 1, 2014, online retailer Tauten asked its sellers to stop selling whale and dolphin meat by the end of the month. The notice was a result of Japan calling off the whale hunt following a ruling by the International Court of Justice. UK based activist group Environmental Investigation Agency has accused Rakuten of being &quot;the largest online seller of whale products&quot;.

==Media attention==
Western media attention regarding Japan&#x27;s whaling industry has increased. Animal Planet&#x27;s television series, &quot;Whale Wars&quot;, places a camera crew on board the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society anti-whaling activist ships to document the annual interference with Japan&#x27;s Antarctic whaling program. Japan has denounced the program as deceptive and supportive of eco-terrorists to increase ratings. Animal Planet has made requests to also film from the perspective of Japan&#x27;s whaling fleet but the requests were denied.

The animated series &quot;South Park&quot; lampooned both Japan&#x27;s whaling traditions and the anti-whaling activists featured on &quot;Whale Wars&quot; in the episode &quot;Whale Whores&quot;.

A 2009 Oscar-winning documentary, &quot;The Cove&quot;, focused entirely on Japan&#x27;s dolphin drive fisheries, mercury content of dolphin meat and the whaling town, Taiji. The film also concentrated on the difficulty in observing Taiji fishermen at work due to obstruction from the local police.

The New Zealander Peter James Bethune received a two-year suspended sentence after boarding the ship which collided with his boat the &quot;Ady Gil&quot;, which subsequently sank.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the whaling town of Ayukawa, in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, was badly damaged by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. After the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster in 2011, radioactive cesium was found in two minke whales caught off the coast of Hokkaido.

<text>Irritator is a genus of spinosaurid dinosaur that lived in what is now Brazil during the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous Period, about 113 to 110 million years ago. It is known from a nearly complete skull found in the Romualdo Formation of the Araripe Basin. Fossil dealers had acquired this skull and sold it to the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart. In 1996, the specimen became the holotype of the type species Irritator challengeri. The genus name comes from the word &quot;irritation&quot;, reflecting the feelings of paleontologists who found the skull had been heavily damaged and altered by the collectors. The species name is a homage to the fictional character Professor Challenger from Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s novels.

Some paleontologists regard Angaturama limai—known from a snout tip that was described a few weeks later also in 1996—as a potential junior synonym of &quot;Irritator&quot;. Both animals hail from the same stratigraphic units of the Araripe Basin. It was also previously proposed that &quot;Irritator&quot; and &quot;Angaturama&quot;″s skull parts belonged to the same specimen. Although this has been cast into doubt, more overlapping fossil material is needed to confirm whether they are the same animal or not. Other spinosaurid skeletal material, some of which could belong to &quot;Irritator&quot; or &quot;Angaturama&quot;, was retrieved from the Romualdo Formation, allowing for a replica skeleton to be made and mounted for display at the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro in 2009.

Estimated at between in length, &quot;Irritator&quot; weighed around , making it one of the smallest spinosaurids known. Its long, shallow and slender snout was lined with straight and unserrated conical teeth. Lengthwise atop the head ran a thin sagittal crest, to which powerful neck muscles were likely anchored. The nostrils were positioned far back from the tip of the snout, and a rigid secondary palate on the roof of the mouth would have strengthened the jaw when feeding. Belonging to a subadult, &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot;″s holotype remains the most completely preserved spinosaurid skull yet found. The &quot;Angaturama&quot; snout tip expanded to the sides in a rosette-like shape, bearing long teeth and an unusually tall crest. One possible skeleton indicates it, like other spinosaurids, had enlarged first-finger claws and a sail running down its back.

&quot;Irritator&quot; had been mistaken initially for a pterosaur, and later a maniraptoran dinosaur. In 1996, the animal was identified as a spinosaurid theropod. The holotype skull was thoroughly prepared before being redescribed in 2002, confirming this classification. Both &quot;Irritator&quot; and &quot;Angaturama&quot; belong to the Spinosaurinae subfamily. A generalist diet—like that of today&#x27;s crocodilians—has been suggested; &quot;Irritator&quot; might have preyed mainly on fish and any other small prey animals it could catch. Fossil evidence is known of an individual that ate a pterosaur, either from hunting or scavenging it. &quot;Irritator&quot; may have had semiaquatic habits, and inhabited the tropical environment of a coastal lagoon surrounded by dry regions. It coexisted with other carnivorous theropods as well as turtles, crocodyliforms, and a large number of pterosaur and fish species.

==History of research==
The holotype of &quot;Irritator&quot; was excavated from a chalk concretion containing the rear of a large skull with lower jaws near the town of Santana do Cariri in northeastern Brazil. This fossil was acquired by dealers who sold it to Rupert Wild of the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart, Germany. At the time it was assumed to be the skull of a giant basal pterosaur, or flying reptile, since the Chapada do Araripe region is famous for its copious pterosaur finds, and the German museum often bought such pieces. As it promised to be a unique discovery of singular importance, German and British pterosaur experts were contacted to study the exemplar. A paper describing it as a pterosaur had already been submitted for publication when the authors, German paleontologist Eberhard Frey and British paleontologist David Martill, were disabused of this notion by the peer reviewers, who suggested the fossil belonged to a theropod dinosaur.

The skull was flattened sideways somewhat and, as is common with fossils, was partly crushed. The right side was well preserved, while the left was extensively damaged during collection. Some of the skull&#x27;s hindmost upper surface had eroded, and the lower jaw lacked its front end, both owing to breakage during fossilization. Parts of the specimen were also cracked due to being part of a septarian concretion. The tip of the upper jaw was also missing. Since there were no signs of erosion, it had most probably broken off during or after the fossil&#x27;s collection. Evident corrosion on certain bones indicates acid preparation had been attempted. A vertical fracture was present across the middle of the skull, which had apparently been sealed with car body filler. In hopes of making it look more complete and valuable, the fossil traders had severely obscured the skull beneath plaster; a widespread practice among local collectors in the Chapada do Araripe, especially on fish fossils. The buyers were unaware of the modifications to the specimen until it was sent to universities in the United Kingdom for CT scan imaging. This revealed the collectors had tried to reconstruct the skull by grafting parts of the maxilla (main upper jaw bone) onto the front of the rostrum (snout). The skull (designated SMNS 58022) became the holotype specimen of the new genus and species &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot; in February 1996, when it was first scientifically described by paleontologists David M. Martill, Arthur R.I. Cruickshank, Eberhard Frey, Philip G. Small and Maria Clarke. In this paper, Martill and his team wrote that the generic name &quot;Irritator&quot; came &quot;from irritation, the feeling the authors felt (understated here) when discovering that the snout had been artificially elongated.&quot; The type species, &quot;Irritator challengeri,&quot; was named after Professor Challenger, a character in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s novels, specifically &quot;The Lost World&quot;. Two years earlier, Frey and Martill had named a new pterosaur species from the Crato Formation &quot;Arthurdactylus conandoylei&quot;, after the novelist himself.

When Martill and colleagues first described &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot;, the holotype was still extensively encased in calcareous rock matrix. Under the supervision of American paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues, technician Diane M. Scott from the University of Toronto at Mississauga assumed the task of fully extracting the skull bones from the rock, allowing for a detailed redescription in 2002. Published by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, this inspection of the now fully prepared specimen negated many of Martill and colleagues&#x27; original observations, which were based on misinterpretations of the damaged and largely concealed skull. The estimated length of the complete skull was shorter than previously proposed. What was originally thought to be a prominent head crest proved to be an unattached, indeterminate bone fragment. As in the previous study, Sues and colleagues regarded the African and possibly South American genus &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; as the most similar taxon to &quot;Irritator&quot;, because they shared many dental features, including mostly straight conical tooth crowns, thin enamel, well-defined edges with no , and lengthwise fluting. Since little was known of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;″s skull at the time, these similarities were enough for the authors to suggest a possible junior synonymy of &quot;Irritator&quot; with &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;. Sues and colleagues noted that more overlapping skull material was needed for further diagnosis. As more of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;″s skull became known, later research maintained separation of the two taxa.

Although the site of discovery is uncertain, the specimen most probably stems from the Romualdo Formation (previously designated the Romualdo Member of the then Santana Formation). This assignment was confirmed by microfossils of the ostracod &quot;Pattersoncypris&quot;, and fish scales from the ichthyodectid &quot;Cladocyclus&quot;, both found in the Romualdo Formation. Questioning of local fossil dealers hinted at a locality near the village of Buxexé close to Santana Do Cariri at the flank of the Chapada do Araripe, at a height of approximately . Since the Romualdo Formation is indeed exposed there, and the matrix encasing the holotype has the same color and texture as those rocks, this locality can be regarded as the probable site of the discovery of the fossil. &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot; was the first dinosaur described from the Romualdo Formation, and its holotype specimen represents the most completely preserved spinosaurid skull known.

===Synonymy with &quot;Angaturama&quot;===
&quot;Angaturama limai&quot;, another spinosaurid from the same time and place as &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot;, was described by the Brazilian paleontologists Alexander W. A. Kellner and Diogenes de Almeida Campos in February 1996. Kept today under specimen number USP GP/2T-5 at the University of São Paulo, the holotype specimen consists of an isolated snout tip from the Romualdo Formation. It was extracted from a calcareous nodule using a technique originally developed for pterosaur fossils. The generic name Angaturama means &quot;noble&quot; in the aboriginal Tupi Indian language of Brazil. The specific name honors the late Brazilian paleontologist Murilo R. de Lima, who informed Kellner of the specimen in 1991.

In 1997, British paleontologists Alan J. Charig and Angela C. Milner considered &quot;Angaturama&quot; a likely junior synonym of &quot;Irritator&quot;, noting that both genera had retracted nostrils, long jaws, and characteristic spinosaurid dentition. Paul Sereno and colleagues in 1998 agreed with this possibility, and additionally observed that the holotype of &quot;Angaturama&quot; seems to complete that of &quot;Irritator&quot; (meaning that they could belong to the same specimen). Authors including Éric Buffetaut and Mohamed Ouaja in 2002, Cristiano Dal Sasso and colleagues in 2005, Tor G. Bertin in 2010, Darren Naish in 2013, and Madani Benyoucef and colleagues in 2015 supported this conclusion. In their redescription of &quot;Irritator&quot;, Sues and colleagues pointed out that both holotypes are equally as narrow, and share transversely round teeth with defined yet unserrated edges. They also noted that a sagittal crest on &quot;Angaturama&quot;″s premaxillae may correspond with that of &quot;Irritator&quot;″s nasal bones. Some objection has been raised to these assertions. Kellner and Campos in 2000 and Brazilian paleontologist Elaine B. Machado and Kellner in 2005 expressed the opinion that the fossils come from two different genera, and that the holotype of &quot;Angaturama limai&quot; was clearly more laterally flattened than that of &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot;.

A review of both fossils by the Brazilian paleontologists Marcos A. F. Sales and Cesar L. Schultz in 2017 noted that the specimens also differ in other aspects of their preservation: the &quot;Irritator&quot; specimen is brighter in color and is affected by a vertical crack, while the &quot;Angaturama&quot; specimen bears many cavities; the damage to the teeth of the &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot; holotype is also much less severe. Sales and Schultz also identified a possible point of overlap, the third left maxillary tooth, and observed that the skull of &quot;Angaturama&quot; could have been larger than that of &quot;Irritator&quot; based on the proportions of the closely related genus &quot;Baryonyx&quot;. They therefore concluded that the two specimens do not belong to the same individual, Sales and Schultz noted that synonymy at the genus level would need to be verified by more extensively overlapping remains. If &quot;Angaturama&quot; and &quot;Irritator&quot; are regarded as a member of the same genus, the latter would be the valid scientific name under rules of priority, since it was named almost a month earlier. The paleontologist Marco Schade and colleagues could not confirm the overlap in tooth positions in 2023 due to interpreting them differently, and could not provide information to resolve the issue.

=== Postcranial material and additional finds ===
Besides the skull, the snout fragment, and some isolated teeth, the Romualdo Formation has also yielded l remains that may belong to spinosaurids, many of which are hitherto undescribed, and all of them pertaining to the Spinosaurinae subfamily. In 2004, parts of a spinal column (MN 4743-V) were unearthed at the formation. Brazilian paleontologist Jonathas Bittencourt and Kellner assigned these, due to their structure, to the Spinosauridae. It is uncertain whether this specimen can be referred to &quot;Irritator&quot; or &quot;Angaturama&quot;, given that both are based only on skull material. In 2007, Machado and Kellner tentatively referred a rib fragment (MN 7021-V) to the Spinosauridae. However, the most complete spinosaur specimen retrieved from the Romualdo Formation is MN 4819-V, a partial skeleton lacking the skull. First reported in 1991, the specimen was referred by Kellner to the Spinosauridae in 2001 because of its tall sacral neural spines and the enlarged condition of the hand claw. The skeleton was fully described in 2010 in an as-of-yet unpublished master&#x27;s thesis by Machado. An incomplete hind limb (MPSC R-2089) mentioned in 2013 might also pertain to the Spinosauridae. In 2018, Tito Aureliano and his team described LPP-PV-0042, part of a left tibia from a particularly large individual. As is common with fossils from the Araripe Basin, the majority of spinosaurid material from the Romualdo Formation was collected under uncontrolled circumstances for use in the illegal fossil trade. As such, many specimens are partly damaged and without precise geological field data.

Some of the Romualdo Formation postcrania were used as the basis for the creation of a replica &quot;Angaturama&quot; skeleton, later mounted at the Federal University-owned Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro (National Museum of Rio de Janeiro). The skeleton depicted the animal carrying an anhanguerid pterosaur in its jaws. It was the centerpiece of the &quot;Dinossauros no Sertão&quot; (Dinosaurs of Sertão) exhibit, which opened to the public in March 2009, becoming the first large carnivorous Brazilian dinosaur to be put on display. Some of the original postcranial elements (including the fossil pelvis and sacral vertebrae) were presented alongside the mount. In press releases of the exhibit&#x27;s opening, Kellner informally implied MN 4819-V as belonging to &quot;Angaturama&quot;. This is also reflected in the specimen&#x27;s inclusion in the skeletal mount. In 2011, a third Brazilian spinosaur, &quot;Oxalaia quilombensis&quot;, was named and described from the Alcântara Formation of the Itapecuru Group, part of the São Luís Basin. This larger species, known only from an isolated snout tip and upper jaw fragment, lived during the Cenomanian stage, around six to nine million years after &quot;Irritator&quot; and &quot;Angaturama&quot;. &quot;Oxalaia quilombensis&quot; is differentiated from &quot;Angaturama limai&quot; by its broader, more rounded snout and lack of a sagittal crest on the premaxillae. In September 2018, a fire broke out at the palace housing the Museu Nacional, largely destroying the fossil collections and possibly the exhibited &quot;Angaturama&quot; skeleton and fossil elements. The holotype of &quot;Oxalaia quilombensis&quot;, which was stored in the same building, may also have been destroyed.

==Description==
Even by maximal size estimates, &quot;Irritator&quot; was smaller than other known spinosaurids. Gregory S. Paul calculated its length at and weight at . Thomas R. Holtz Jr. published a higher estimate of , with a weight between . Estimates by Dougal Dixon were lower at long and high. When scaled by Aureliano and colleagues, the reconstructions from the study by Sales and Schultz provided a length of for the &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot; holotype, and for the &quot;Angaturama limai&quot; holotype. Some of the skull bones of the former holotype had not yet fully co-ossified (fused), indicating that the specimen belonged to a subadult. The partial spinosaurine skeleton MN 4819-V represented a moderately sized individual, estimated by Machado at in length. Many elements from this specimen were incorporated into the skeletal mount in the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, which had a length of and a height of . However, spinosaurids from the Romualdo Formation possibly attained greater sizes. Although LPP-PV-0042 is represented only by a tibia fragment, Aureliano and colleagues estimated its length at roughly . Bone histology indicates that this individual was a subadult, so the mature animal may have been larger.

===Anatomy of the &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot; holotype===
The holotype skull of &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot;, although heavily damaged in certain places, is largely complete; missing only the tip of the snout and the front of the mandible. The preserved skull is tall and wide, its full length has been estimated at , based on comparisons with &quot;Baryonyx&quot;. &quot;Irritator&quot;″s skull was long, narrow, and somewhat triangular in cross section. The was inclined backwards, and deeper than it was long. Extending from it was an elongate and low snout, with both sides relatively flat and slightly angled towards the skull midline. Only the rear ends of the paired (frontmost snout bones) remain intact, forming the front upper and lower borders of the (bony nostrils). As in all spinosaurids, the (main upper jaw bones) extended below and past the nostrils in a long, low branch that formed the lower border of this opening, consequently separating the premaxillae and bones in that location. &quot;Irritator&quot;″s maxillary sinuses (located in the body of the maxillae) bore a large oval opening, as in &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. The nostril openings were oval and, as in all spinosaurids, positioned farther back on the skull than in typical theropods. &quot;Irritator&quot;″s nostrils were both proportionately and absolutely smaller than in &quot;Suchomimus&quot; and &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, but larger than those of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;. The opening behind the orbit (eye socket), the lateral temporal fenestra, was very large, while the antorbital fenestra, in front of the eyes, was long and elliptical. The orbit itself was deep and wider at the top (where the eyeball was placed) than the bottom. The bone separated the orbit from the antorbital fenestra, forming the upper and lower rear margins of the latter with two processes that enclosed a 40-degree angle; similar to &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, where it enclosed 35 degrees. Unlike in &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, &quot;Irritator&quot;″s lacrimal did not form a bony horn core. The prefrontal bones were large and sturdy, while the thinner bones, situated behind them, were smooth and concave on top; both of these bones formed the upper rim of the orbit.

A thin sagittal crest, constructed from the elongate nasal bones, extended along the skull midline before stopping just above the eye in a slightly flattened bulge. Although the complete shape and height of this structure is unknown in &quot;Irritator&quot;, these head crests were commonplace in spinosaurids, having possibly served a display function when the animal was alive. The preserved part of &quot;Irritator&quot;″s crest is deepest above the antorbital fenestra and lacks the vertical ridges seen in the crest of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;. Like others in its family, &quot;Irritator&quot; possessed a long and bony structure on the roof of its mouth called a secondary palate, separating the oral from the nasal cavity. This is a feature observed in extant crocodilians, but absent in most theropod dinosaurs. Also like its relatives, &quot;Irritator&quot; had two additional openings on the skull roof (called the postnasal fenestrae) as well as long and only partially diverging (bony extensions connecting the braincase with the palate). The back of the lower jaw was deep, its rear upper surface consisting mainly of the large bone, which with the shallower bone below it. The , a sideways-facing opening in the lower jaw, was oval and comparatively large. The (tooth-bearing bone of the mandible) is unknown in &quot;Irritator&quot;, save for a possible remnant at the front of the surangular. &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot;″s holotype is unique in that it is one of the few non-avian (or non-bird) dinosaur fossils found with a preserved stapes.

&quot;Irritator&quot; had straight or only faintly recurved conical teeth, bearing sharply defined but unserrated edges. Flutes (lengthwise ridges) were present on its tooth crowns, a common dental trait among spinosaurids. Both sides of &quot;Irritator&quot;″s teeth were fluted, as in &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, whereas &quot;Baryonyx&quot; exhibited them only on the lingual (inward facing) side of its teeth. &quot;Irritator&quot;″s teeth were circular in cross section, as opposed to the laterally flattened condition of most theropod teeth. The enamel (first layer of the teeth) was thin, with a finely wrinkled texture also observed in &quot;Baryonyx.&quot; Both of &quot;Irritator&quot;″s maxillae preserve nine teeth, although the left maxilla&#x27;s tooth crowns are more intact, and there are traces of a tenth tooth in the rock matrix. The teeth were deeply inserted into the jaw and widely spaced towards the front of the maxilla. The first and second preserved maxillary teeth were the largest, at and in crown length. The seven remaining teeth became progressively smaller towards the rear, one of the last ones measuring in estimated crown length. CT scans performed on the specimen revealed replacement teeth on both sides of the upper jaw. Their roots ran deep into the maxillae and converged close to the midline, nearly reaching the top of the skull. Based on comparisons with &quot;Irritator&quot;″s relatives, the maxillae were probably lined with a total of 11 teeth each, similar to the number of 12 teeth in MSNM V4047, an upper jaw fossil referred to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;. The hindmost tooth of the &quot;Irritator&quot; specimen&#x27;s left maxilla was not yet fully erupted, and only the tip of it was visible.

===Anatomy of the &quot;Angaturama limai&quot; holotype===
The holotype of &quot;Angaturama&quot; &quot;limai&quot; consists only of the front part of the upper jaw, comprising the tips of the paired premaxillae and the frontmost ends of the maxillae. The specimen measures in height and in length, with the width of the palatal region being . The suture between the maxilla and premaxilla was jagged at the front and straightened out towards the rear. The lower margin of the premaxillae was concave, with the concavity reaching its apex at the sixth premaxillary tooth. The front of the snout was expanded, forming the spoon-shaped terminal rosette characteristic of spinosaurids. This concave underside of the premaxillae would have complemented a convex and enlarged mandible tip. The premaxillae connected with each other on the bottom to form &quot;Angaturama&quot;″s secondary palate, which was also partially contributed to by two processes extending from the maxillae. The snout was strongly compressed laterally, and the premaxillae gently tapered towards the top to form a tall sagittal crest in thickness. This crest was larger and extended farther forwards on the snout than in other known spinosaurids. The frontmost upper border of the premaxilla had a small bulge that overhung the base of the crest. This bulge was apparently damaged on its upper surface, indicating that the top of the crest may have extended even farther over and forwards from that point. The front of &quot;Angaturama&quot;″s snout hence had a vertically straight or concave margin, atypical from the more smoothly sloping snouts of other spinosaurs.

In the premaxilla, a broken-off tooth with partial tooth crown was recovered. The strongly extended and straight teeth with unserrated conical crowns, which measured in length, were singly embedded. This indicates continuous tooth replacement where new teeth were pushed up between the old ones. Judging by the (tooth sockets), the premaxilla had seven teeth altogether, the third tooth being the largest. The frontmost three teeth of the maxilla were also preserved. The premaxillary teeth increased in size from the first to third, shrank from the third to the sixth, and enlarged again from the sixth premaxillary to third maxillary positions. A diastema (gap in tooth row) was present between the last premaxillary and first maxillary tooth.

===Postcrania===
Though no skeletal remains were discovered with the original &quot;Angaturama&quot; snout tip, one partial skeleton (MN 4819-V) from a different location may belong to the genus. But since there is no overlapping material between the two specimens, direct comparisons cannot be made. MN 4819-V comprises a largely intact pelvis, some dorsal (back) and (tail) vertebrae, five (hip) vertebrae, a partial right and (shin and calf bones), most of the right (thigh bone), and part of an (forearm bone). It also has the most complete hand known from a spinosaurid, including , , one , and one . Like in all spinosaurids, the claw of the first finger (the &quot;thumb&quot;) was enlarged.

The pelvic bones are well preserved, with the right side better articulated than the left. The fused sacral vertebrae are still attached to the pelvis, which lacks the distal ends of both of its and (lower and rearmost hip bones). The (main hip bone) is long. The (front expansion) of the ilium was curved on the bottom and was somewhat shorter and deeper than the (rear expansion). The preacetabular ala were somewhat enlarged at the front, in contrast to the more slender condition of the postacetabular ala. The (groove at the bottom of the postacetabular ala) was concave, as was the rear margin of the ischium. The pubis bore a relatively large and almost closed , an indentation in the lower margin of the rear part of the bone that allowed for the passage of the obturator nerve. The upwards projecting neural spines of the sacrum were elongated, as is typical in spinosaurs. In life, these would have been covered in skin, forming a &quot;sail&quot; down the animal&#x27;s back. MN 4819-V is distinguished from &quot;Suchomimus&quot; due to its longer and shallower ilium with a less curved upper margin, and from &quot;Baryonyx&quot; by having a more developed , a blade-like structure on the bottom of the ischium.

==Classification==
Martill and his team originally classified &quot;Irritator&quot; as a maniraptoran dinosaur in the clade Bullatosauria (a group no longer considered monophyletic), as a close relative to the feathered ornithomimosaurs and troodontids. Given that its dental morphology, particularly long snout, and assumed fin-shaped crest were features unknown in &quot;other&quot; maniraptorans, the researchers erected the new family Irritatoridae within the clade. They recognized &quot;Irritator&quot;″s affinities with &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, in that they both had similarly shaped and unserrated teeth, but noted that the latter&#x27;s mandible would not conform with the front of &quot;Irritator&quot;″s upper jaw, and that other non-avian dinosaurs like &quot;Compsognathus&quot; and &quot;Ornitholestes&quot; also bore no serrations on some or all of their teeth. Some of these claims were questioned in 1996 by Kellner who found that &quot;Irritator&quot;″s skull lacked the one autapomorphy (distinguishing feature) diagnosed in maniraptorans at the time, which was having its (cheek) bone forming part of the antorbital fenestra. He also pointed out that since &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot;″s holotype lacked the tip of its snout, it would not be possible to know if &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;″s dentary could complement it or not. Based on comparisons with &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, Kellner resolved &quot;Irritator&quot; as a spinosaurid and synonymized Irritatoridae with that family. &quot;Irritator&quot; was then assigned to the Baryonychidae along with &quot;Angaturama&quot;, &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, &quot;Suchomimus,&quot; and &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; by Oliver W.M. Rauhut in 2003. Thomas Holtz and colleagues in 2004 considered the Baryonychidae synonymous with Spinosauridae, and moved these genera to the latter family. Most later revisions have upheld these classifications. As spinosaurids, &quot;Irritator&quot; and &quot;Angaturama&quot; are placed within the superfamily Megalosauroidea, with Spinosauridae being a possible sister taxon to the Megalosauridae.

In 1998, Sereno and colleagues defined two subfamilies within the Spinosauridae based on craniodental (skull and tooth) characteristics. They were Spinosaurinae, where they placed &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Irritator&quot;; and Baryonychinae, to which they assigned &quot;Baryonyx, Suchomimus,&quot; and &quot;Cristatusaurus&quot;. Spinosaurines were distinguished by their unserrated, straighter, and more widely spaced teeth, as well as smaller first teeth of the premaxilla.&quot;&quot; In 2005, Dal Sasso and colleagues assumed &quot;Irritator&quot;″s nostrils as being located above the middle of the maxillary tooth row; more posteriorly than in baryonychines, but less so than in &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;. Sales and Schultz in 2017 found that &quot;Irritator&quot;″s nostrils were in fact positioned closer to the front of the jaw, as in &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and &quot;Suchomimus&quot;; this more forward nostril placement was typically considered characteristic of baryonychines. Nevertheless, &quot;Irritator&quot; also bore unserrated teeth, a trait associated with spinosaurines. Sales and Schultz thus noted that the Araripe Basin spinosaurids &quot;Irritator&quot; and &quot;Angaturama&quot; might represent intermediate forms between the earlier baryonychines and later spinosaurines, and that further research may eventually render the former a paraphyletic (unnatural) group.

&quot;Irritator&quot; is further distinguished from &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, &quot;Suchomimus&quot;, and &quot;Cristatusaurus&quot; by having slightly over half as many teeth in the maxilla, and from &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; due to its comparatively larger and more forwardly positioned nostril openings, which, unlike in &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, are also formed by the premaxilla. The narrow sagittal crest, which ends in a knob-like process above the frontals, is another autapomorphy separating &quot;Irritator&quot; from other spinosaurids. Although &quot;Angaturama limai&quot;″s snout is generally narrower than in other spinosaurids, this might be due to damage sustained by the fossil; the holotype appears partly crushed and broken on its lower margin, with some of the preserved teeth having been sectioned off along their length. Therefore, &quot;Angaturama&quot;″s only valid autapomorphy is its sagittal crest, which extends farther forwards on the rostrum and is more exaggerated than in other known spinosaurid skulls.

==Paleobiology==

===Diet and feeding===
In 1996, Martill and colleagues theorized that &quot;Irritator challengeri,&quot; with its elongated snout and unserrated conical teeth, likely had at least a partly piscivorous (fish-eating) diet. Although much of the holotype&#x27;s morphology turned out to be greatly different than they thought, later studies supported these observations. Spinosaurids had very narrow and elongated jaws with relatively homogeneous pointed teeth, an arrangement found particularly in animals like the Indian gharial—the most piscivorous extant crocodilian. The long conical teeth, which in spinosaurines did not possess serrated edges, were suitable for grabbing and holding prey. They differed from teeth of other theropods, which seemed geared towards tearing or cutting off seized body parts.

&quot;Irritator&quot; shared with crocodilians a stiff secondary palate and reduced antorbital fenestrae. In 2007, a finite-element analysis study by British paleontologist Emily J. Rayfield and colleagues found that these attributes, present in other spinosaurids as well, made the skull more resistant to torsion from prey item loads when feeding. The authors pointed out that in contrast, most theropods lacked secondary palates and had large antorbital fenestrae, exchanging strength for lighter skull builds. The nostrils of &quot;Irritator&quot; were shifted far back from the snout tip; this, along with the secondary palate, which separated the animal&#x27;s nasal passages from the inside of its mouth, made respiration possible even if most of the jaw was underwater or held prey. In particular, the sagittal crest of &quot;Irritator&quot; is an indication for pronounced neck musculature, which would have been necessary to close the jaws quickly against water resistance and withdraw the head rapidly. In 2015, German paleontologist Serjoscha W. Evers and colleagues found evidence for similar adaptations in the African spinosaur &quot;Sigilmassasaurus.&quot; The neck vertebrae of this genus have a heavily furrowed undersurface. This is consistent with the attachment of powerful neck muscles for use in fishing or rapidly snatching small prey, a trait also observed in extant crocodilians and birds. Sales and Schultz in 2017 found that &quot;Irritator&quot; and baryonychines might have relied more on their sense of smell for hunting than &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; did, since they had larger, less retracted nostrils and more room in their skulls for the nasal cavity. &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; itself probably made heavier use of senses like vision or the mechanoreceptors on the tip of its snout, like those used by crocodilians to sense prey moving in the water.

Another trait spinosaurs shared with gharials was an enlarged snout tip that wielded a rosette-shaped array of interlocking teeth, adept for impaling and catching fish. Although to a lesser degree than most known spinosaurs, this feature was also present in the &quot;Angaturama limai&quot; holotype. In 2002, Sues and colleagues pointed out, however, that there would be no reason to assume that the Spinosauridae specialized completely in fishing. They stressed rather that this head morphology indicates a generalistic feeding, particularly on small prey animals. In fact, portions of a young &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, a terrestrial herbivore, were found inside the fossil skeleton of one &quot;Baryonyx&quot;. Naish and colleagues in 2004 supported the theory that &quot;Irritator&quot; hunted both aquatic and terrestrial animals as a generalist within the coastal area and in addition probably searched for carrion. A tooth belonging to &quot;Irritator&quot; was discovered still inserted into the fossil neck vertebral column of an ornithocheirid pterosaur, likely with a wingspan of . This indicates that &quot;Irritator&quot; ate pterosaurs as well, although it is not known if it actively hunted these animals or simply scavenged the remains. In 2018, Aureliano and colleagues presented a possible scenario for the food web of the Romualdo Formation. The researchers proposed that spinosaurines from the formation may have also preyed on terrestrial and aquatic crocodyliforms, juveniles of their own species, turtles, and small to medium-sized dinosaurs. This would have made spinosaurines apex predators within this particular ecosystem.

Examinations and digital reconstructions of &quot;Irritator&quot; published in 2023 by Schade, Rauhut &quot;et al.,&quot; suggests that the lower jaws of this spinosaurid could rotate and open laterally, with a gape similar to that of modern pelicans; this would have allowed the theropod to swallow very large prey items. It was also discovered to have a very weak but rapid bite as a result of this analysis. The study also reaffirms that &quot;Irritator&quot; likely possessed binocular vision and would have held its snout at an inclined orientation. Additionally, the examinations reaffirmed classification of spinosaurids as megalosauroids and that megalosauroids and allosauroidea were part of a monophyletic Carnosauria, with &quot;Monolophosaurus&quot; standing as a sister taxon to spinosauridae.

===Aquatic habits===

Many spinosaurs likely had semiaquatic habits, as has been shown in studies using techniques like isotope analysis and bone histology. It has been found that they probably took advantage of aquatic prey and environments (usually marginal and coastal habitats) to occupy a distinct ecological niche, therefore avoiding competition with more terrestrial theropods. Spinosaurines appear to have been more adapted for such lifestyles than baryonychines. A 2018 study by British paleontologist Thomas M. S. Arden and colleagues examined the morphology of spinosaurine skull bones for possible aquatic traits. They found that the frontal bones of &quot;Irritator&quot;, &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot; were similar in being arched, concave on top, and narrowed at the front; features that would have resulted in the eyes being positioned further up on the head than in other theropods. In particular, the broad lower jaw and narrowed frontals of &quot;Irritator&quot; resulted in the orbits facing at a steep incline towards the midline of the skull, whereas most theropods had laterally facing orbits. These traits would have permitted the animal to see above the waterline when submerged.

In 2018, Aureliano and colleagues conducted an analysis on the Romualdo Formation tibia fragment. CT scanning of the specimen in the University of São Carlos revealed the presence of osteosclerosis (high bone density). This condition had previously only been observed in &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus,&quot; as a possible way of facilitating submersion in water by making its bones heavier. The presence of this condition on the Brazilian leg fragment showed that compact bones had already evolved in spinosaurines at least 10 million years before the appearance of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; in Morocco. According to phylogenetic bracketing—a method used to infer unknown traits in organisms by comparison with their relatives—osteosclerosis therefore might have been the norm in the Spinosaurinae. The significance of these traits was questioned in a later 2018 publication, where Canadian paleobiologist Donald Henderson argued that osteosclerosis would not have changed a theropod&#x27;s buoyancy to a significant extent.

===Neuroanatomy and senses===

In 2020, German paleontologist Marco Schade and colleagues analyzed the anatomy of the holotype skull braincase through CT scans, revealing numerous details about behavioral capabilities of &quot;Irritator&quot;. With the scans, they created a 3D model of the skull and braincase, discovering that &quot;Irritator&quot; had elongated olfactory tracts and a relatively large floccular recesses (area that pierces through the semicircular canals and connects the brain with the inner ear). The flocculus, itself, is an important element in the coordination and control of head and ocular movements during gaze stabilization (visual ability during head movement), by being involved in the coordination of the vestibulo-ocular (VOR) and vestibulo-collic (VCR) reflexes. The flocculus appears to be enlarged in taxa that rely on quick movements of the head body. In addition, the vestibular part of the endosseous labyrinth has a large anterior semicircular canal with a lateral oriented semicircular canal.

Both floccular recesses and semicircular canal suggest that &quot;Irritator&quot; could coordinate fast head movements and had a downward inclined snout posture, enabling an unobstructed, stereoscopic forward vision, which is important for distance perception and therefore precise snatching movements of the snout. These inferences seem to be an agreement with a piscivore life-style. They also noted that the relatively well-developed cochlear duct may have enable an average hearing frequency of 1,950 Hz with a frequency band width of 3,196 Hz. However, they considered these ranges as rough estimates and established an overall frequency range of 350–3,550 Hz, making &quot;Irritator&quot; to be placed under bird hearing but above crocodiles.

==Paleoenvironment and paleobiogeography==
&quot;Irritator&quot; and &quot;Angaturama&quot; are known from the Romualdo Formation, whose rocks are dated to the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous Period, about 110 million years ago. During this time, the Southern Atlantic Ocean was opening, forming the series of circum-Atlantic basins of southern Brazil and southwestern Africa, but the northeastern part of Brazil and West Africa were still connected. The Romualdo Formation is part of the Santana Group and, at the time &quot;Irritator&quot; was described, was thought to be a member of what was then considered the Santana Formation. The Romualdo Formation is a Lagerstätte (a sedimentary deposit that preserves fossils in excellent condition) consisting of limestone concretions embedded in shales, and overlies the Crato Formation. It is well known for preserving fossils three-dimensionally in limestone concretions, including many pterosaur fossils. In addition to muscle fibres of pterosaurs and dinosaurs, fish, preserving gills, digestive tracts, and hearts, have been found there. The formation is interpreted as a coastal lagoon with irregular freshwater influence that contended with cycles of transgressing and regressing sea levels. The climate of the formation was tropical and largely corresponded to today&#x27;s Brazilian climate. The regions surrounding the formation were arid to semi-arid, with most of the local flora being xerophytic (adapted to dry environments). Cycadales and the extinct conifer &quot;Brachyphyllum&quot; were the most widespread plants.

This environment was dominated by pterosaurs, including: &quot;Anhanguera&quot;, &quot;Araripedactylus&quot;, &quot;Araripesaurus&quot;, &quot;Brasileodactylus&quot;, &quot;Cearadactylus&quot;, &quot;Coloborhynchus&quot;, &quot;Santanadactylus&quot;, &quot;Tapejara&quot;, &quot;Thalassodromeus&quot;, &quot;Tupuxuara&quot;, &quot;Barbosania&quot;, &quot;Maaradactylus&quot;, &quot;Tropeognathus&quot;, and &quot;Unwindia.&quot; The known dinosaur fauna besides &quot;Irritator&quot; was represented by other theropods like the tyrannosauroid &quot;Santanaraptor,&quot; the compsognathid &quot;Mirischia,&quot; an indeterminate unenlagiine dromaeosaurid, and a megaraptoran. The crocodyliforms &quot;Araripesuchus&quot; and &quot;Caririsuchus&quot;, as well as the turtles &quot;Brasilemys&quot;, &quot;Cearachelys,&quot; &quot;Araripemys&quot;, &quot;Euraxemys&quot;, and &quot;Santanachelys&quot;, are known from the deposits. There were also clam shrimps, sea urchins, ostracods, and molluscs. Various well-preserved fish fossils record the presence of: hybodont sharks, guitarfish, gars, amiids, ophiopsids, oshuniids, pycnodontids, aspidorhynchids, cladocyclids, bonefishes, chanids, mawsoniids and some uncertain forms. According to Naish and colleagues, the lack of herbivorous dinosaurs could mean that the local vegetation was scant and thus incapable of sustaining a large population of them. The abundant carnivorous theropods would have then likely turned to the lush aquatic life as a primary food source. They also hypothesized that following storm events, pterosaur and fish carcasses might have washed up on the shoreline, providing theropods with plenty of carrion. Multiple piscivorous animals were present in the formation, which might in theory have led to high competition. Aureliano and colleagues stated there must have, therefore, been some degree of niche partitioning, where different animals would have fed on prey of varied sizes and locations within the lagoon.

Similarities between the fauna of the Romualdo and Crato Formations to that of Middle Cretaceous Africa suggest that the Araripe Basin was connected to the Tethys Sea, though this link was likely sporadic, because the lack of marine invertebrates indicates the basin had a non-marine depositional setting. Spinosaurids had already achieved a cosmopolitan distribution during the Early Cretaceous. Sereno and colleagues in 1998 suggested that with the opening of the Tethys Sea, spinosaurines would have evolved in the south (Africa, in Gondwana) and baryonychines in the north (Europe, in Laurasia).&quot;&quot; In following, Machado and Kellner theorized in 2005 that spinosaurines would have then spread to South America from Africa. Sereno and colleagues postulated that divergent evolution between spinosaurines in South America and Africa likely occurred as a consequence of the Atlantic Ocean, whose opening gradually separated the continents and contributed to differences between taxa. A similar scenario was suggested in 2014 by Brazilian paleontologist Manuel A. Medeiros and colleagues for the fauna of the Alcântara Formation, where &quot;Oxalaia&quot; has been found. But the paleobiogeography of spinosaurids remains highly theoretical and uncertain, with discoveries in Asia and Australia indicating that it may have been complex.

=== Taphonomy ===

The taphonomy (changes between death and fossilization) of the &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot; holotype specimen has been discussed by some researchers. The skull was found lying on its side. Preceding fossilization, several bones from the back of the braincase, as well as the dentary, splenial, coronoid, and right angular bones from the lower jaw, were lost. Other bones, mostly from the skull rear, had become and displaced towards alternate regions of the head before burial. Naish and colleagues in 2004 asserted that the Romualdo Formation dinosaur fauna is represented by animals that died near shorelines or rivers before being carried out to sea, where their floating remains were eventually fossilized. In 2018, Aureliano and colleagues argued against this scenario, stating that the &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot; holotype&#x27;s mandible was preserved in articulation with the rest of the skull, whereas it would have likely detached had the carcass been floating at sea. They also noted that the corpse would have quickly sunk due to the osteosclerosis of the skeleton. The researchers, therefore, concluded that fossils from the Santana Group represent organisms that were buried in their natural habitat, instead of having been deposited allochthonously (other than at their present position).

<text>The GM High Feature engine (also known as the HFV6, and including the 3600 LY7 and derivative LP1) is a family of modern DOHC V6 engines produced by General Motors. The series was introduced in 2004 with the Cadillac CTS and the Holden Commodore (VZ).

It is a 60° 24-valve design with aluminum block and heads and sequential multi-port fuel injection. Most versions feature continuously variable cam phasing on both intake and exhaust valves and electronic throttle control. Other features include piston oil-jet capability, forged and fillet rolled crankshaft, sinter forged connecting rods, a variable-length intake manifold, twin knock control sensors and coil-on-plug ignition. It was developed by the same international team responsible for the Ecotec, including the Opel engineers responsible for the 54° V6, with involvement with design and development engineering from Ricardo plc.

GM&#x27;s Australian auto division Holden produced a HFV6 engine under the name &quot;Alloytec.&quot;

== History ==
The HFV6 was designed, tested, and produced in a joint program by Holden and Cadillac. A majority of designs into the new alloy construction, transmission pairing, and first use in production were all undertaken in Detroit (and manufactured in St. Catharines, Ontario). Holden was charged with developing smaller engines (Holden 3.2 LP1 and Saab 2.8 Turbo LP9) as well as their own Holden 3.6 and 3.0 HFV6 (called the Alloytec V6) for local models.

Cadillac and Holden both tested variations of these engines in the United States and Australia.

== 2.8 ==
=== LP1 ===
A &quot;LP1&quot; variant was introduced in the 2005 Cadillac CTS. It was also used on the Chinese 2008 CTS. It has a bore and stroke, sequential multi-port fuel injection and a 10.0:1 compression ratio. The &quot;LP1&quot; was built in St. Catharines, Ontario.

Applications:
=== LP9 ===
&quot;This engine is also known as a A28NET, Z28NET, Z28NEL or B284.&quot;

The &quot;LP9&quot; is a 2.8L turbocharged version used for the Saab 9-3, Saab 9-5, and other GM vehicles. It has the same bore and stroke as the naturally aspirated LP1, however the compression ratio is reduced to 9.5:1. The engine is manufactured at Holden&#x27;s Fishermans Bend engine factory in Port Melbourne, Australia, while GM Powertrain Sweden (formerly Saab Automobile Powertrain) is responsible for turbocharging the engine. Global versions of this engine use the same horsepower rating for both metric and imperial markets – mechanical horsepower – while the Europe-only versions are rated in metric horsepower.

This engine is produced in several locations: St. Catharines (Ontario), Flint Engine South (Michigan), Melbourne (Australia), Ramos Arizpe (Mexico), and Sagara (Japan) by Suzuki.

Suzuki&#x27;s engine designation is &quot;N36A&quot;.

The dual-fuel &quot;LW2&quot; version was able to run on petrol and autogas. The LW2 engine was based on the low-output LE0 V6. It featured a factory-fitted dual-fuel system developed by IMPCO, different valves, and hardened titanium valve seats. This motor was available exclusively in Holden vehicles from 2005–2012.

Applications:
=== LLT ===
The &quot;LLT&quot; is a direct injected version based on the earlier LY7 engine. It was first unveiled in May 2006, and the DI version was claimed to have 15% greater power, 8% greater torque, and 3% better fuel economy than its port-injected counterpart. The &quot;LLT&quot; engine has a compression ratio of 11.3:1, and has been certified by the SAE to produce at 6300 rpm and of torque at 5200 rpm on regular unleaded (87 octane) gasoline. This engine debuted on the 2008 Cadillac STS and CTS. GM used an LLT in all 2009–2017 Lambda-derived crossover SUVs to allow class-leading fuel economy in light of the new Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. In these crossovers, the LLT engine produced up to and of torque.

Applications:
=== LFX ===
The &quot;LFX&quot; is an enhanced version of the LLT engine developed jointly by Holden and Cadillac. Introduced in the MY2012 Holden Commodore SV6 and the MY2012 Chevrolet Camaro LS/LT, it is lighter than the LLT, thanks to a redesigned cylinder head, integrated exhaust manifold, and composite intake manifold. Other components like the timing chains, fuel injectors, intake valves, and fuel pump have also been updated. They also updated the cam phasing and variable valve timing system compared to the LLT. Power and torque are up slightly from the LLT. The compression ratio is 11.5:1. The LFX also features E85 flex-fuel capability.

Applications:
=== LWR ===
The &quot;LWR&quot; is dedicated LPG 3.6-liter engine. Introduced in the MY2012 Holden Commodore, Based on the 3.6-litre LY7 engine, the LWR had a vapour injection system. The vapour injection system injected gas directly into the air intake runner, thereby preventing excess gas from circulating through the air intake system. Although liquid LPG injection generally produces more power, Holden justified vapour injection on the grounds of lower fuel consumption, lower emissions, reduced pumping and parasitic losses, and start-up reliability in hot weather.

The dedicated LPG LWR engine produced peak power and torque of at 6000 rpm and at 2000 rpm. The LWR engine was mated to GM&#x27;s six-speed 6L45 automatic transmission and, over the combined ADR 81/02 test cycle, the Commodore Omega achieved fuel consumption of – an improvement of 1.6 L/100 km compared to its dual-fuel LW2 predecessor. Furthermore, the LWR engine exceeded Euro 6 emissions standards.
* Specially hardened valves and valve seats.
* A redesigned cylinder head and manifold for improved air flow.
* Variable exhaust valve timing (the LW2 engine only had variable intake valve timing)
* Specially-developed fuel injectors.
* New pistons with pentroof-style centre-domes and valve eyelets for a higher compression ratio of 12.2:1 (compared to 10.2:1 for the dual fuel engine).
* A new fuel rail and a new LPG fuel filter.
Applications:
=== LCS ===
The &quot;LCS&quot; was derived from the direct-injected LLT for use in hybrids, using the two-mode system. Differences from the LLT included a slightly lower compression ratio, 11.3:1, and lower power and torque peaks. It was to debut in the 2009 Saturn Vue Hybrid, where it would have made at 6100 rpm and of torque at 4800 rpm. Fuel economy ratings would have been in city, and on highway. However, GM cancelled its plans for the Saturn Vue Hybrid.
=== LF3 ===
The 3.6L twin-turbocharged version for the 2014 Cadillac CTS and XTS was announced at the 2013 NYAS.

The engine is rated at of power at 5750 rpm and of torque at 3500–4500 rpm (with 90% of torque being available at 2500–5500 rpm) and helps the CTS achieve  time of 4.6 seconds with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

In essence, the twin-turbo 3.6L V6 is the forced-induction variant of the popular LFX V6 found in the Cadillac ATS, XTS, and SRX, among many other GM models, with several important upgrades, including:
* All-new cylinder block casting

Applications:
== 7.2L V12 ==
On March 21, 2007, &quot;AutoWeek&quot; reported that GM was planning to develop a 60-degree V12 based on this engine family to power the top version of Cadillac&#x27;s upcoming flagship sedan. This Cadillac would essentially have had two 3.6L High Feature V6s attached crankshaft-to-crankshaft and would have featured high-end technologies including direct injection and cylinder deactivation. If this engine were developed, it would have displaced 7.2 liters, and produced approximately and of torque. Development of the engine was reportedly being conducted in Australia by Holden, with a potential HSV or Statesman application.

In August 2008, GM announced that development of the V12 had been cancelled.

==Timing chain issues==
Earlier production 2.8L, 3.0L, 3.2L, and 3.6L engines with the three chain design suffered from premature timing chain failures because of a faulty PCV system and extended oil change intervals. Most of the problems occurred on pre-LFX engines.

==Holden High Feature engine==

Holden sold a HFV6 engine under the name Alloytec. The High Feature moniker on the Holden produced engine is reserved for the twin cam phasing high output version. The block was designed to be expandable from 2.8 L to 4.0 L. High Feature V6 engines were previously produced in Fishermans Bend, Port Melbourne, Australia, and remain in production at the following four manufacturing locations: St. Catharines Engine Plant, St. Catharines, Canada; Flint Engine South in Flint, Michigan, United States; Romulus Engine Plant in Romulus, Michigan; and Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila, Mexico. The assembly lines for the St. Catharines and Flint facilities were manufactured by Hirata Corporation at its powertrain facility in Kumamoto, Japan. Most of the designs of this motor happened in Flint. They were first produced for the Cadillac range. The engine block and cylinder heads are cast at Defiance Foundry in Defiance, Ohio.

<text>Duckwater is an unincorporated community located in the central portion of the U.S. state of Nevada, in the Duckwater Valley at about the same latitude as Sacramento, California. It is in Nye County, at the eastern edge of the Duckwater Indian Reservation, near the Red Mountain Wilderness at the end of Nevada State Route 379. The city of Las Vegas is about to the south-southeast.

A post office was established at Duckwater in 1873. The community was named for the ducks which frequented wetlands near the original town site.

==Education==
All children may attend the Nye County School District&#x27;s Duckwater School, but Native American children may elect to attend the Duckwater Shoshone Elementary School (D.S.E.S.), located on the reservation. D.S.E.S. is tribally-controlled and operated, with funding derived from the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). The BIE provides most of the tribal school&#x27;s funding. Both schools are K-8 one-room schools.

By 1975, Duckwater School, with one teacher, had an enrollment of six, since some students had withdrawn upon the opening of the reservation school. Prior to loss of Native American students, the school district provided hot lunches, and there were two teachers. By 1986 enrollment was thirteen, and the relationship between the Duckwater School and Duckwater Shoshone School community had mended. The teacher then had an aide, and used the aide and older students to ensure all students be on task. Of the thirteen students, nine had at least one sibling in their classes. Students came from ranching and mining families.

Duckwater Shoshone is in a building that previously functioned as a church. The school was established circa 1973 by tribal members who were dissatisfied with their children&#x27;s course in the Nye County School District. The school board was established on July 26 of that year, and it opened on November 26 of that year after the United States Office of Education granted $35,000. In 1975 its student count was 21. In 1982 the school was renovated. It maintains its own zoological garden.

Most students in grades 9-12 attend Eureka County High School, north of Duckwater. , the students on the reservation go to high school in Eureka, Eureka County High School of the Eureka County School District. Other high schools taking Duckwater area students, as of 1986, are Lund High School in Lund and White Pine High School in Ely, both of the White Pine County School District. As of 1986, residents of Ely and Eureka often take in high school students from Duckwater, who live with them while they attend high school.

<doc id="895473" wikidata="Q15189133" url="?curid=895473" title="Army Officer Selection Board">
<text>Army Officer Selection Board (AOSB) is an assessment centre used by the British Army as part of the officer selection process for the regular army and Army Reserve and related scholarship schemes. The board is based at Leighton House, Westbury in Wiltshire, England in a dedicated camp. It is commanded by the President AOSB, a colonel in the British Army, supported by a number of vice-presidents.

AOSB is an equivalent of the Navy&#x27;s Admiralty Interview Board and the Officer and Aircrew Selection Centre of the Royal Air Force.

== History ==

The AOSB has its roots in the War Office Selection Boards (WOSBs), created by Army psychiatrists in 1942 during World War II. They involved candidates taking a three-day stay in a country house, where tests were administered including written tests of mental ability, questionnaires, leaderless group tests and interviews. Psychiatrists and some psychological components of the WOSBs were removed from the Boards after the war. The Army Officer Selection Board was known as the Regular Commissions Board (RCB). In 1949, the RCB moved from Sussex to its current facilities at Leighton House in Westbury, Wiltshire. Both Regular and Army Reserve officers are screened here.

==Application process==
Applicants for the British Army undergo initial suitability assessments, through computer-based tests and interviews, along a number of routes. All officer candidates will be required to attend AOSB at a point determined by the type of entry. Candidates for scholarship and professionally qualified officers will attend only one board; other entrants will be required to attend both a briefing board and a main board.

Candidates will usually have undertaken insight or familiarisation visits to appropriate units prior to attendance at the board.

==Board structure==

Candidates are divided into groups of six to eight, each supervised by a group leader who is a major or captain and who runs the activities and records evidence.

A board consists of one or two groups and is presided over by a president or vice-president, with Professionally Qualified Officer boards supervised by an officer of the appropriate specialisation. Each group is assessed by a deputy president, who is a lieutenant colonel; their group leader; and an education advisor, who is a serving or retired officer of the AGC (ETS).

Up to three boards can be run concurrently.

==Types of board==

===AOSB briefing===
This takes place over two days and must be attended prior to being able to proceed to the main board. It is an opportunity for candidates to learn some of the techniques that will be tested at the main board, and for the AOSB assessors to offer advice and guidance to those attending about how prepared they are to attempt the much more challenging main board. It is designed to give potential officers an idea of what is required and expected at the main board. Candidates will participate in a number of assessments, including physical and intellectual ones. The results will be used by AOSB assessors when feeding back to candidates.

After attending AOSB briefing, candidates will be assigned a category based on the evidence available to the assessors. This will be:
# Allowed to proceed to the main board as soon as desired.
# Required to delay for between 3 and 24 months (often awarded to younger candidates with potential ability but insufficient maturity, or for remedial purposes such as to improve upon physical fitness)
# The candidate is thought unlikely to pass the Main Board based on the evidence presented at briefing. However, they are not prevented from attempting the Main Board if, after further consideration, they believe they can achieve the required standard.
# The candidate is not considered suitable for commissioned service based on the evidence available. This may be as a result of a number of issues, including their personality or their ability to apply their intellect. Candidates who receive a Category 4 at the briefing may appeal against this result if they believe that their performance was not representative. If successful (strong cases must be made) the candidate may be allowed to attend a Main Board.

===AOSB main board===
This is a four-day selection event that consists of a number of different but inter-linked intellectual, physical, mental and aptitude tests. It is designed to put candidates for both the Regular Army and Army Reserve under pressure whilst fostering their team spirit and competitiveness.

The Boards normally run from Tuesday until Friday but a small number each year take place from Thursday until Sunday.

On arrival, candidates are allocated a number (used instead of their name) and placed into groups. As candidates are assessed against a standard and not against each other&#x27;s performance, strong groups may see a large proportion of their members meet the standard.

On the last night of the course a formal dinner is held for the candidates. The staff are at pains to point out that the meal is not an assessment, and no directing staff are present at the event.

The details of the physical tasks, command tasks, interviews and academic tests are not made public. It is known that the assessment consists of a physical fitness assessment, an individual obstacle course, two multiple-choice tests on current affairs and general knowledge (in the past a third test covered military knowledge), three interviews, a group discussion and essay on current and moral affairs, a 5-minute lecture, individual planning exercise, and both leaderless team tasks and a series of command tasks where a team member commands the rest. There are also group races where each group gets an opportunity to test themselves against the other groups undergoing selection at the time.

Candidates are only permitted to make two attempts to pass the board, which must be separated by a minimum of eight months.

=== Chaplains ===
Selection for Army chaplains – including regular, reserve, and cadet force roles – takes place at the AOSB.

===CFCB (Cadet Forces) Board===
The Cadet Forces Commissions Board is used to select officers for the Army Cadet Force. Run over a weekend, the course is broadly similar to the AOSB Main Board, without physical tests. There is no set quota for selection and candidates are assessed against a standard, not each other.

Following completion of CFCB, a candidate is awarded one of four possible results:

# Selected – The candidate has been successful at the board and is recommended for an Army Cadet Force commission.
# Not Selected (Encourage) – The candidate has not been successful, however it has been recognised that they have potential and are encouraged to attempt the board again at a later date.
# Not Selected – The candidate has not been successful. If they wish, they can attempt the board again at a later date.
# Not Selected (Discourage) – The candidate has not been successful and is deemed to be unsuitable for a commission. The candidate cannot normally attend for another attempt, however in extenuating circumstances their county commandant can appeal to the President CFCB for an exception to be made.

If a candidate has not been successful at the board, they must wait at least a year before a second attempt. If the second attempt is unsuccessful, they must wait a minimum of five years for a third attempt.

===Army Scholarship Board===
The Army runs two Scholarship Boards each year for boys and girls aged between 16 and 17. The board is similar in many ways to the Main Board, with a fitness test, interviews, planning exercise and leadership tasks. The process takes 24 hours, and is tailored to suit candidates in this age range. The Board is designed to identify intelligence and leadership at a young age. Successful candidates are then subject to further scrutiny by Recruiting Group prior to potentially receiving a financial award whilst at sixth form, and then a subsequent annual award for each year whilst studying at university. They are also awarded a final lump sum on completion of the 44-week Commissioning Course after university. By passing the Board, scholars have a guaranteed place at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and they do not need to pass the AOSB Main Board to enter that establishment.

==Physical fitness requirements==
Following the roll-out of new standardised fitness tests across the entire army in April 2019, the general fitness requirements for both regular and reserve officer entrants consists of the Role Fitness Test (Entry):

* Reach 8.7 on a bleep test
* Throw a 4 kg medicine ball 3.1 metres from a seated position
* Lift 76 kg in a mid-thigh pull

Standards are the same for male and female candidates.

==Leighton House==
The estate on which Leighton House stands belonged to the Phipps family, a prominent family in Westbury&#x27;s cloth industry who first leased a house there in the early 18th century, and bought the property from the Earl of Abingdon in 1791. In 1800 Thomas Henry Hele Phipps, father of coffee merchants and politicians John Lewis and Charles Paul Phipps, built a new neoclassical box house, naming it Leighton House.

William Laverton (d.1925), who ran a wool mill inherited from his uncle Abraham Laverton, bought out the entire estate in 1888. He employed Bristol architect Sir Frank Wills to alter and extend the house, and planted trees, including a row of &quot;Araucaria araucana&quot; (Chilean pine) which still stands there today. Laverton ran his own in-house cricket team which played at W. H. Laverton&#x27;s Ground, across the road from the house (now part of Wiltshire Council&#x27;s Leighton Recreation Centre).

The estate and its farmland were sold off by Laverton in 1921. The house was briefly used by a prep school, Victoria College, before the War Office bought the estate in 1939. It previously housed a selection board for National Service. Since 1949 the Regular Commissions Board, later Army Officer Selection Board, has been based there.

The estate comprises a 19th-century manor house (Leighton House itself), a trout lake and an assault course where potential officers are put through their paces.

In 1978 Leighton House was designated as Grade II listed for its architectural significance, as it features designs from two periods.

== Future ==
In March 2016, the Ministry of Defence announced that the Westbury site was one of ten to be sold in order to reduce the size of the Defence estate. In November 2016 the estimated date of disposal of the site was given as 2024, with the Selection Board due to move to Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Berkshire. In 2021, this decision was reversed under the Future Soldier reforms and the board will remain in place.

<text>Rubus caesius is a Eurasian species of dewberry, known as the European dewberry. Like other dewberries, it is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, related to the blackberry and raspberry. It is widely distributed across much of Eurasia.

==Description==

&quot;Rubus caesius&quot; is similar to and often confused with forms of &quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot;. It is a small shrub growing up to tall with biennial stems which die after fruiting in their second year. It sends out long runners which root at the tip to form new plants. The stems are bluish-grey and sometimes prickly. The alternate leaves are hairy above and below. They are stalked and the leaf blades are palmate in shape, either consisting of three oval leaflets with serrated margins and acute points or just being three-lobed. The inflorescence is a loose cluster of several white flowers about in diameter. The calyx has five sepals and the corolla is composed of five spreading petals with finely toothed margins. There is a boss of stamens in the centre and there are several pistils. The fruit is an aggregate of several black, fleshy drupes with a bluish waxy bloom. The dewberry flowers from June to September.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Rubus caesius&quot; is widely distributed across much of Europe and Asia from Ireland and Portugal as far east as Xinjiang Province in western China. It has also become sparingly naturalized in scattered locations in Argentina, Canada, and the United States.

It most often inhabits areas with rocky, basic soil and light shade. It is often found in forest margins, coppices, rocky broadleaf woods and waterside thickets.

==Ecology==
The dewberry can hybridise with the raspberry (&quot;R. idaeus&quot;) and the stone bramble (&quot;R. saxatilis&quot;).

===Genome===
Alice &quot;et al.&quot;, 2001 find &quot;R. caesius&quot; is a tetraploid blackberry which hybridises especially with &quot;R. idaeus&quot; and others of the genus. Sochor &quot;et al.&quot;, 2015 finds this species has produced many new European blackberry species by speciation by hybridisation with &quot;R. idaeus&quot;. Carter &quot;et al.&quot;, 2019 find maternal descent is probably from &quot;Rubus&quot; subg. &quot;Rubus&quot;.

<doc id="895492" wikidata="Q6924826" url="?curid=895492" title="Mount of the Holy Cross">
<text>Mount of the Holy Cross is a high and prominent mountain summit in the northern Sawatch Range of the Rocky Mountains of North America. The fourteener is located in the Holy Cross Wilderness of White River National Forest, west-southwest (bearing 244°) of the Town of Red Cliff in Eagle County, Colorado, United States. The summit of Mount of the Holy Cross is the highest point in Eagle County and the northern Sawatch Range.

==Mountain==
Mount of the Holy Cross was named for the distinctive cross-shaped snowfield on its northeast face. On May 11, 1929. President Herbert Hoover designated the area surrounding the mountain as Holy Cross National Monument under United States Forest Service administration. The monument was transferred to the National Park Service in 1933. The mountain&#x27;s remote location made tourism difficult, and on August 3, 1950, President Harry Truman signed an act abolishing the national monument and returning the area to White River National Forest. The former national monument is now a part of the Holy Cross Wilderness.

This mountain has been the subject of painters, photographers and even a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, (&quot;The Cross of Snow&quot;). The first publicly available photograph was published in &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine. Thomas Moran depicted the mountain in an oil painting, which now is part of the collection of the Museum of the American West, part of the Autry National Center in Los Angeles, California. It is still much photographed but it is not as well known today as it was in the past.

Nearby features include Bowl of Tears Lake, directly under the east face of the peak, Tuhare Lakes, in a cirque that lies south of a significant subpeak, and several other lakes. Notable locations within include the Dotsero volcano (near Interstate 70), Vail and Aspen. US 24 runs near the peak through Gilman.
The first recorded ascent of Holy Cross was in 1873, by F. V. Hayden and photographer W. H. Jackson during one of Hayden&#x27;s geographical surveys. However, the peak may well have been ascended previously by miners or American Indians. The first winter ascent of the peak was made in 1943 by Russel Keene and Howard Freedman of the 10th Mountain Division, then stationed at Camp Hale.

The mining town of Holy Cross City was established in 1880 to serve the growing mining operations around the region. In 1883, the Holy Cross City Trail was built to the town, but the town was depopulated from a peak of 600 people the next year.
Holy Cross can be climbed by at least four different routes, with the easiest and most common route being the North Ridge, which involves of vertical gain over and is rated YDS Class 2 for moderate scrambling. The Cross Couloir route forms the vertical portion of the famous cross feature, and provides an advanced snow climb or extreme ski descent.
Mount of the Holy Cross has a history of endangering the lives of many hikers. Although the summit on Mount of the Holy Cross is frequently reached on a long day hike, hikers have become stranded or lost through missing the right turn down the ridgeline, heading straight down and into the wilderness; research and planning of the route is important to prevent tragedies. Efforts to improve safety have been made by the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative.

Mount of the Holy Cross is accessible from Tigiwon Road, south of Minturn, Colorado. The Half Moon Pass Trail is the standard route to the summit of Mount of the Holy Cross via the North Ridge. Following the Fall Creek Trail to an ascent of Notch Mountain Trail provides the best view of the Holy Cross snow feature from Notch Mountain Ridge.

<doc id="895493" wikidata="Q1102092" url="?curid=895493" title="Clock DVA">
<text>Clock DVA are a musical group from Sheffield, England, whose style has touched on industrial, post-punk, and EBM. They formed in 1978 by Adi Newton (born Gary Coates) and Steven &quot;Judd&quot; Turner. Along with contemporaries Heaven 17, Clock DVA&#x27;s name was inspired by the Russian-influenced Nadsat language of Anthony Burgess&#x27;s novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. &quot;Dva&quot; is Russian for &quot;two&quot;.

==History==

===1978–1981: &quot;White Souls in Black Suits&quot; and &quot;Thirst&quot;===

Newton had previously worked with members of Cabaret Voltaire in a collective called The Studs and with Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware in a band called The Future. He formed the first lineup of Clock DVA in 1978 with Judd Turner (bass), David J. Hammond (guitar), Roger Quail (drums) and Charlie Collins (saxophone, clarinet) (born 26 September 1958, Sheffield).

Clock DVA was originally known for making a form of experimental electronic music involving treated tape loops and synthesizers such as the EMS Synthi E. Clock DVA became associated with industrial music with the 1980 release of their cassette album &quot;White Souls in Black Suits&quot; on Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s Industrial Records.

Paul Widger joined on guitar. The LP &quot;Thirst&quot;, released on Fetish Records, followed in 1981 to a favourable critical reaction, and reaching the top of the NME Indie Charts, by which time the band had combined &quot;musique concrète&quot; techniques with standard rock instrumentation. &quot;4 Hours&quot;, the single from &quot;Thirst&quot;, was later covered by former Bauhaus bassist David J on his 1985 solo EP &quot;Blue Moods Turning Tail&quot;.

The band split up in 1981, with the non-original members of the band — Quail, Collins, and Widger — going on to form The Box.

Turner died in September 1981 due to an accidental drug overdose.

===1982–1984: &quot;Advantage&quot;===

In 1982, Newton formed a new version of the band that included future Siouxsie and the Banshees guitarist John Valentine Carruthers and signed a deal with the major label Polydor Records. The single &quot;High Holy Disco Mass&quot; (which was released under the name DVA) and the EP &quot;Passions Still Aflame&quot; were released in 1982, preceding the release of the album &quot;Advantage&quot; (with singles &quot;Resistance&quot; and &quot;Breakdown&quot;) in 1983. Trouser Press characterized &quot;Advantage&quot; as &quot;their strongest, most powerful LP, a funky concoction of intense dance-powered bass/drums drive with splatters of feedback, angst-ridden vocals by Newton, tape interruptions and dollops of white-noise sax and trumpet.&quot;

After a European tour in 1983, however, the band split acrimoniously. Adi Newton went on to form The Anti-Group, or T.A.G.C. They released several albums continuing in a similar vein to the early Clock DVA, yet more experimental.

===1987–1994: &quot;Buried Dreams&quot;, &quot;Man-Amplified&quot; and &quot;Sign&quot;===

In 1987, Newton reactivated DVA and invited Dean Dennis and Paul Browse back into the fold to aid Newton&#x27;s use of computer aided sampling techniques which he had been developing in The Anti Group. They released &quot;Buried Dreams&quot; (1989), an electronic album which (along with its single &quot;The Hacker&quot;) received critical acclaim as a pioneering work in the cyberpunk genre. It is also rumored to have been the CD found in Jeffrey Dahmer&#x27;s stereo at the time of his arrest, according to a 1990s piece published by Alternative Press.

Browse left the group in 1989 and was replaced by Robert E. Baker. The album &quot;Man-Amplified&quot; (1992), an exploration of cybernetics, was the next release. &quot;Digital Soundtracks&quot; (1992), an instrumental album, followed.

Following Dennis&#x27;s departure from the group, Newton and Baker produced the album &quot;Sign&quot; (1993).

===1995–2007: Hiatus===

After the release of &quot;Sign&quot; and related singles, Clock DVA toured Europe (line-up: Newton &amp; Baker with Andrew McKenzie and Ari Newton) and Newton relocated to Italy. However, their Italian record label at the time, Contempo, folded which caused a number of problems.

&quot;Collective&quot;, an anthology album and a box set was released in 1994. Newton began working on new material with Brian Williams, Graeme Revell (from SPK) and Paul Haslinger but continued problems with record labels eventually caused Newton and Clock DVA take a long break from the music scene.

In 1998, Czech record label Nextera released a reissue of &quot;Buried Dreams&quot;, sanctioned by Dean Dennis and Paul Browse but not by Newton.

===2008–present: Reactivation===
Adi Newton reactivated Clock DVA, along with his creative partner Jane Radion Newton, in 2008.

Since 2011, Clock DVA has performed at several electronic music festivals and venues throughout Europe with a new line-up consisting of Newton, Maurizio &quot;TeZ&quot; Martinucci and Shara Vasilenko.

In November 2011, a new Clock DVA track &quot;Phase IV&quot; was featured on Wroclaw Industrial Festival compilation album.

In January 2012, German record label Vinyl on Demand announced &quot;Horology&quot;, a vinyl box set compilation of early (1978–1980) Clock DVA material. Later on, the demo recordings included in this box set, namely &quot;Lomticks of Time&quot;, &quot;2nd&quot;, &quot;Sex Works Beyond Entanglement&quot;, &quot;Deep Floor&quot; and &quot;Fragment&quot;, were reissued separately early 2016.

A historical overview exhibition of Clock DVA (photographs, video and audio) took place at the Melkweg cultural centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands in February/March 2012.

In July 2013, a new Clock DVA album called &quot;Post-Sign&quot; was released on Anterior Research. It was produced and composed by Adi Newton in 1994–95 as an instrumental companion album to &quot;Sign&quot;, though it remained unreleased at that time due to problems with record labels.

According to Adi Newton, Mute Records were set to re-release the eight Clock DVA albums remastered in a box set in 2012.

In 2013, Clock DVA played at the Incubate festival in Tilburg, the Netherlands.

In 2014, Clock DVA released the album &quot;Clock 2&quot; on a USB drive through their label Anterior Research. This limited edition release consists of 3 new studio tracks and various remixes of them, in addition to 4 video files. A 12&quot; called &quot;Re-Konstructor / Re-Kabaret 13&quot; was released shortly after. A version of the release was also made available on streaming sites and for digital download. A further EP, &quot;Neo Post Sign&quot;, containing tracks recorded 1995–96 but omitted from the &quot;Post-Sign&quot; album, was released early 2015.

Also in 2014, members of Clock DVA and fellow Sheffield band In the Nursery joined former Cabaret Voltaire vocalist Stephen Mallinder in a performance under the name IBBERSON. The performance took place at the newly built John Pemberton Lecture Theatres in the School of Health and Related Research at the University of Sheffield, which was constructed in the approximate location of the original Western Works studio where the earliest Clock DVA recordings were made. The name &quot;IBBERSON&quot; is a reference to a sign which used to hang outside the studio building.

In July 2015, another vinyl box set of early material was released on Vinyl on Demand. &quot;Horology 2 - Clockdva, The Future &amp; Radiophonic Dvations&quot; features recordings made in late 1977/1978 period by Adi Newton prior to and during the formative period of development of Clock DVA, including the original The Future recordings made by the trio of Adi Newton, Martyn Ware, and Ian Craig Marsh before The Future developed into The Human League and Clock DVA.

In September 2016, Clock DVA performed a series of live dates in the United States.

<text>Marcus Bentley (born 4 October 1967) is a British actor, broadcaster and voice-over artist. Bentley is most known for narrating the British version of the Dutch reality television programme &quot;Big Brother&quot; since its inception in 2000. He also did other continuity announcements for Channel 4 until he left in July 2011 to continue narrating the revived &quot;Big Brother&quot; on Channel 5. Bentley&#x27;s voice-over work and distinctive Geordie accent has led to him becoming one of Britain&#x27;s most recognised voices.

Bentley has also appeared on stage and in &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot;. Although he rarely makes public appearances, his public profile has been raised since &quot;Big Brother&quot;″s revival on Channel 5.

==Early life==
Bentley was born in Gateshead, and brought up in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham. He attended East 15 Acting School.

==&quot;Big Brother&quot;==
Bentley was selected as the narrator of the Channel 4 (2000–2010), Channel 5 (2011–2018) and ITV2 (2023–) reality television programme &quot;Big Brother&quot;, which originated in the Netherlands, and this remains his best-known work. The producers of &quot;Big Brother&quot; gave him the job of narrator because they liked the way he said &quot;Chickens&quot;. His most notable catchphrase is &quot;Day [x] (in the Big Brother house...)&quot;. Bentley has narrated all twenty-one series of the show to date, as well as the spin-off shows &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, &quot;Teen Big Brother&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Hijack&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot;.

==Other work==
Before &quot;Big Brother&quot;, Bentley starred in several TV adaptations of Catherine Cookson&#x27;s novels where he honed his now familiar Tyne and Wear accent. He also starred in several TV commercials as well as minor parts in feature films, such as &quot;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&quot;, which starred Joss Ackland, C. Thomas Howell, and Elizabeth Hurley.

Aside from &quot;Big Brother&quot;, Bentley could be heard on Channel 4 as a continuity announcer until he left after ten years, when he reprised his &quot;Big Brother&quot; narrator role on the revived Channel 5 series.

Another of Bentley&#x27;s roles is the unseen question master on &quot;Sky One&quot; quiz show, &quot;Dirty Money&quot;.

===Channel 5===
From December 2011, Bentley began doing continuity links on Channel 5, complementing his role as narrator of &quot;Big Brother&quot; on the same channel.

==Personal life==
Bentley married his wife Jools in 1997. The couple have three children, and live in Kent.

<doc id="895506" wikidata="Q1666691" url="?curid=895506" title="Sphere (novel)">
<text>Sphere is a 1987 novel by Michael Crichton, his sixth novel under his own name and his sixteenth overall. It was adapted into the film &quot;Sphere&quot; in 1998.

The story follows Norman Johnson, a psychologist engaged by the United States Navy, who joins a team of scientists assembled to examine a spacecraft of unknown origin discovered on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The novel begins as a science fiction story but quickly transforms into a psychological thriller, developing into an exploration of the nature of the human imagination.

==Plot summary==
A group of scientists (psychologist Norman Johnson, mathematician Harry Adams, zoologist Beth Halpern, astrophysicist Ted Fielding, and marine biologist Arthur Levine), along with U.S. Navy personnel, travel to a deep sea habitat at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, where a long spacecraft has been discovered.

During the descent, Levine becomes claustrophobic and is returned to the surface. The other scientists arrive safely at Habitat DH-8. After their arrival and subsequent pressurization to the habitat&#x27;s exotic-gas environment, the Navy sends a robot to enter the spacecraft first, which locates and opens a panel near the spacecraft door.

As the robot&#x27;s cameras focus on the opened panel, labels in English indicate the spacecraft is actually a U.S. spacecraft constructed in the future and sent through time, appearing on the seabed at least 300 years before its creation. The robot is unable to open a hatch leading further inside, forcing the team to don pressure suits and explore the spacecraft. In a large cargo hold, the team discovers a mysterious spherical object that is clearly of extra-terrestrial origin.

Reasoning the ship&#x27;s future builders were apparently unaware that it had already been found in their past, Adams becomes convinced that the team will not survive to report their discovery. Remaining behind after the rest of the team returns to the habitat, Adams succeeds in opening and entering the sphere. Meanwhile, on the surface, a Pacific cyclone forces the supporting Naval ships to evacuate, trapping and isolating the scientists on the ocean floor for five days. Adams is found and returned to the DH-8 Habitat where he awakens with a terrible headache and little-to-no memory of how he opened the sphere or what occurred while he was inside. Immediately afterwards, the team is contacted by an intelligent, seemingly friendly alien entity that calls itself &quot;Jerry&quot;.

At first, Jerry communicates with the scientists using a numeric code transmitted to the habitat&#x27;s computer. While the team struggles to communicate with Jerry, increasingly bizarre and deadly events occur, including the appearance of impossible sea creatures that Halpern claims cannot exist (such as shrimp with no digestive organs), confirmed when Jerry informs them he is &quot;manifesting&quot; the creatures.

At this point, members of the team start to die in various attacks by giant squid, and the dwindling band of survivors struggle in their dealings with the unthinkably powerful, childlike, and temperamental alien entity. Johnson realizes he must use psychology to keep the remaining survivors (Johnson, Adams, and Halpern) alive.

After re-translating the original code, Johnson realizes by transposition the entity&#x27;s name is &quot;Harry&quot;. Johnson hypothesizes that the sphere is an object which allows a person&#x27;s subconscious thoughts to manifest in reality, and Harry Adams has acquired the power through entering it. This is confirmed by his childhood fear of squid, especially the giant squid in the novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;, manifested in the form of a vast number of small squid and later a giant squid that attacks the DH-8 Habitat.

Johnson and Halpern sedate Adams and wait for contact to be re-established with the surface, but the manifestations continue. Halpern accuses Johnson of having entered the sphere and gaining access to the power. While unable to recall this incident, Johnson comes close to yielding, until he watches a security video of Halpern entering the sphere herself. Rejecting the notion, Halpern decides that Johnson is an imminent threat and defends herself by planting powerful explosives around the spacecraft and habitat, and then attempts to suffocate Johnson by manipulating the habitat&#x27;s life-support system.

Escaping from the habitat, Johnson goes to the spacecraft and enters the presence of the sphere, then the sphere itself. Inside the sphere, he finds a large sea of translucent &quot;foam,&quot; and has a conversation in his thoughts with some sort of entity that speaks in cryptic riddles, who eventually tells Johnson that the greatest power humans possess is the ability to imagine things. After leaving the sphere, Johnson decides to escape using the submarine docked at Habitat DH-7, a nearby habitat for Navy personnel, but cannot abandon the other survivors. Now empowered in the same way as Adams and Halpern, Johnson returns to DH-8, and using the submarine the trio escape before the explosives set by Halpern count down and destroy the spaceship, research habitat, and surrounding site.

On the surface, confined to a decompression chamber, the trio ponder on what version of their story to tell the Navy. Realizing they could not control the power granted them by the sphere, they decide its knowledge to be too dangerous to be communicated, and resolve to use its power to remove it from themselves and alter their memories, replacing the fantastical experiences with more mundane memories of a technical failure, though it is hinted that Halpern has kept her power.

==Main characters==
*Norman Johnson—the protagonist and a psychologist who, years earlier, was responsible for defining the operational procedures should the US ever come into contact with alien life, although he admits that he treated the request to do so as a joke at the time. These procedures were outlined in a report entitled &quot;Recommendations for the Human Contact Team to Interact With Unknown Life Forms&quot;, often abbreviated ULF. Despite being the least physically fit team member in the context of an underwater habitat, he is arguably the most level-headed of the group. Nonetheless, Johnson takes time and trouble to convince the group to collaborate.
*Harold &quot;Harry&quot; Adams—a young, intelligent, African-American mathematician. While intellectually gifted and professionally secure, he is arrogant, unsympathetic, disdainful, and often uncooperative with the others, as a legacy of growing up as a mathematical prodigy who was often picked on as a child because of his lack of athletic talent.
*Elizabeth Halpern—a biochemist who is muscular, sometimes gentle and caring while simultaneously fierce, combative, and confrontational. She perceives herself as being dominated by the male scientists.
*Theodore Fielding—an astrophysicist and an enthusiastic opportunist, whose pretensions tend to cause conflict in his relationships with the others, despite his good intentions. It is later revealed his ambition is driven by anxiety and a conviction that he has to achieve fame and do so fast, as he believes that the time for him to do so is running out.
*Arthur Levine—a marine biologist and the sole member of the team not chosen by Norman. He is also the only team member who does not make the descent to the crash site.
*Harold C. Barnes—a retired Navy captain who has charge of the underwater scientific investigation. He is brusque, impatient, and distrustful, possibly as a result of his military background. This leads to conflicts with the other main characters. He withholds crucial information from the team and his crew, following his own agenda at the expense of the others with tragic consequences.
*Alice &quot;Teeny&quot; Fletcher—a Navy chief petty officer in charge of maintaining the habitat. She is friendly and competent, despite Norman&#x27;s initial skepticism. It is not specifically explained how she dies, but the survivors find a trail of blood and one of her shoes after the second giant squid attack.
*Tina Chan—a Navy petty officer and electronics technician who is in charge of communications. She develops a friendship with Halpern, and is one of the longest surviving Navy personnel killed by the manifestations.
*Rose Levy—a Navy seaman who serves as the habitat&#x27;s cook.
*Jane Edmunds—a Navy petty officer and data processing technician who serves as the operation&#x27;s archivist. She is responsible for recording events and transferring the tapes to the submarine at DH-7, which is pre-programmed to return to the surface if not reset before a failsafe 12-hour countdown reaches 0, intended to ensure that at the very least a partial record will survive in case of catastrophe.

==Background==
Crichton began writing the novel in 1967 as a companion piece to &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;. His initial storyline began with American scientists discovering a 300-year-old spaceship underwater with stenciled markings in English. However, Crichton later realized that he &quot;didn&#x27;t know where to go with it&quot; and put off completing the book until a later date.

The idea of doing a story about contact with superior intelligence, a time-honored theme, is that it&#x27;s very hard if you stop and think about it. Most writers evade the issue by making the aliens recognizably human. It&#x27;s 9 feet tall with spiky teeth and it wants to eat you. Or its 3 feet tall and it wants to hug you. In either case its humanlike... What&#x27;s more likely about first contact with an extraterrestrial is that the alien wouldn&#x27;t look humanlike at all. You might not even be able to see it or detect it. And its behavior would be absolutely inexplicable. Trouble is, it gets hard to dream up a story where at the center there is something inexplicable.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
The book was made into the film &quot;Sphere&quot; (1998), directed by Barry Levinson, with a cast including Dustin Hoffman (Norman Johnson, renamed Norman Goodman), Samuel L. Jackson (Harry Adams), Peter Coyote (Harold Barnes), Liev Schreiber (Ted Fielding), and Sharon Stone (Beth Halpern, renamed Beth Halperin).

The film largely follows the novel, although there are differences. The film received negative reviews from critics and has been described as having &quot;bombed&quot; at the box office. It was rated 12% by Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus opinion: &quot;Sphere features an A-level cast working with B-grade material, with a story seen previously in superior science-fiction films&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert described &quot;Sphere&quot; as &quot;a watered-down take on the sci-fi classic &quot;Solaris&quot; by Stanislaw Lem, which was made into an immeasurably better film by Andrei Tarkovsky&quot;.

===Planned television series===
In August 2020, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that HBO would be developing a television series based on the novel.

==Reception==

Reviews were mostly positive for the novel in contrast to its film adaptation. For example, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Robin McKinley wrote, &quot;Part of the fun of &quot;Sphere&quot; is that it keeps you going even when you&#x27;re pretty sure of what will happen next.&quot;

<doc id="895509" wikidata="Q330" url="?curid=895509" title="Battle of Marignano">
<text>The Battle of Marignano was the last major engagement of the War of the League of Cambrai and took place on 13–14 September 1515, near the town now called Melegnano, 16 km southeast of Milan. It pitted the French army, composed of the best heavy cavalry and artillery in the world, led by Francis I, newly crowned King of France, against the Old Swiss Confederacy, whose mercenaries until that point were regarded as the best medieval infantry force in Europe. With the French were German &quot;landsknechts&quot;, bitter rivals of the Swiss for fame and renown in war, and their late arriving Venetian allies.

==Background==

The campaign of Marignano followed years of Swiss successes, during which French fortunes in northern Italy had suffered greatly. The Swiss had taken control of Milan (for France the gateway to Italy) after their victory at the Battle of Novara (1513), and returned to its ducal throne Massimiliano, son of Ludovico Sforza, to make Milan a protectorate of Switzerland.

The prologue to the battle was an Alpine passage, in which Francis hauled pieces of artillery (72 huge cannons) over new-made roads over the Col d&#x27;Argentière, a previously unknown route. At Villafranca the French, led by Jacques de la Palice, surprised and captured the Papal commander, Prospero Colonna, in a daring cavalry raid deep behind the allied lines (the Chevalier Bayard providing the impetus and expertise). Colonna and his staff aside, the French seized a great deal of booty on the raid, including 600 horses.

The capture of Colonna, along with the startling appearance of the French army on the plains of Piedmont, stunned the allies. The Pope and the Swiss both sought terms with Francis, while the Spanish allies en route from Naples halted to await developments. The main Swiss army retreated to Milan, while a large faction, tired of the war and eager to return home with the booty of years of successful campaigning, urged terms with the French.

Though the parties reached a peace agreement that gave Milan back to the French, leading large portions of the Swiss army to return home, fresh troops also arrived from the Swiss cantons who refused to abide by the treaty. Discord swept through the Swiss forces until Matthäus Schiner, cardinal of Sion and an arch-enemy of King Francis, tricked the Swiss into doing battle with a far superior force by exaggerating the extent of a minor skirmish. The Swiss issued forth from Milan in disciplined columns.

==Battle==

The Swiss encountered Francis&#x27;s forces at the little burnt-out village of Marignano on a plain dotted with vineyards, farm fields, small orchards, and pastures. A treaty signed, the French were not expecting battle. Francis was in his tent, trying on a new suit of armor, when scouts reported the coming of the Swiss. The French army quickly sprang into action, forming up in three divisions. The French vanguard, under the joint command of Charles III, Duke of Bourbon and the Marshal Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, took possession of two shallow rises near San Giuliano. This formation consisted of crossbowmen (protected by earthworks and pavise shields) on the left, a large square of Landsknecht infantry at the center, and arquebusiers on the right, covering the artillery, which was arrayed in a crescent shape along the south-eastern and eastern edges of the formation. Two kilometers to their rear, Francis I of France personally led a force of cavalry and 6,000 Landsknechts recruited from the Netherlands known as the Black Band of Gueldern. Finally, the rearguard, a further kilometer to the center&#x27;s rear, was led by the King&#x27;s brother-in-law, Charles IV, Duke of Alençon. Unlike the French force, which had a good mix of pikemen, arquebuses, and cavalry, the Swiss force consisted almost entirely of pike infantry and only fielded less than a dozen artillery pieces.

Close to sunset, the Swiss approached the French in three divisions of their own, each a dense mass of pikemen. They had no artillery or cavalry, and had learned in past actions that a rapid advance into the enemy would sweep all before them. At Marignano, the battle began with a “forlorn hope” detaching from the Swiss vanguard phalanx, and charging the grand battery in front of the King’s position in the center with lowered pikes. Their intent, justified by experience in other battles, was to quickly overrun the French cannon and then turn them upon their owners.

At first the Swiss attack succeeded in driving back the landsknecht defenders and capturing a few of the guns, the speed of the Swiss advance rendering their fire ineffective. But Bourbon’s cavalry from the French right counter-attacked their flank, driving the forlorn hope back to the shelter of the Swiss vanguard. The pursuing French horse were themselves forced to retreat back a full kilometer after taking heavy losses.

Smoke and the coming of night obscured the battle; in the moonlight and confusion, the outcome hung in the balance. Furious French cavalry charges, often led by the king himself, with Bayard at his side, succeeded time and again in throwing back temporary Swiss gains. Many of the foremost French commanders were wounded or killed in the desperate night fighting, including the Prince of Tallemont, son of Louis II de la Trémoille, who died with sixty-two wounds on his body. The Black Legion counter-attacked and threw back the Swiss, only to be repulsed in turn. Bayard had to cut his way through the Swiss phalanx to rescue the Duke of Lorraine, stranded in the dark amongst his enemies. In the darkest hours, the fighting stopped, and both armies extracted themselves and reorganized. During the night, some of the Swiss soldiers, and even entire units, slipped away from the battlefield rather than fight another day. Those that remained were determined and the battle commenced again the following morning.

In the French center, the grand battery had been reassembled. Opposing them, the Swiss had reformed their largest phalanx. Encouraged by the evening before, the Swiss once again lowered pikes and charged the French guns. This time the grand battery was ready for them. Massed cannon fire tore bloody furrows deep in their ranks, slowing the advance. But the undaunted Swiss continually closed ranks and pushed forward. Again, the defending German landsknechts were driven back; but the massed fire of the guns at point blank range prevented the Swiss from pushing farther forward. Still another French cavalry charge, this time led by Bayard, forced the attacking Swiss to give ground.

Baffled by the artillery but as yet undaunted, the Swiss refocused their assault against Alençon’s left-wing division. After making some headway, this attack too was thrown back. In his report later to his mother, King Francis would boast that “thirty brave charges” were hurled by the French gendarmerie against the stubborn Swiss.

Only the mid-morning arrival of allied Venetian forces commanded by the &quot;condottiero&quot; Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano turned the tide against the Swiss. Their attacks repulsed everywhere, their ranks in bloody shambles, they grudgingly gave ground and withdrew by forming a single gigantic open square, maintaining extraordinary discipline in their retreat.

The battle was a decisive victory for Francis. This could be considered the expected outcome, seeing as the Swiss were heavily outnumbered and outgunned. But the Swiss during the preceding decades had almost habitually emerged victorious from such disadvantageous situations, and the French victory by no means came easily, the battle hanging in the balance until the arrival of the Venetian reinforcements.

The immediate causes of the Swiss defeat were their failure to capture the enemy artillery during the early phase of the battle and the arrival of the Venetians. But also contributing to the Swiss defeat were their lack of discipline and their ineffective command structure. Earlier in the same year of 1515, the Swiss diet had granted to each captain the authority to decide whether their company would continue their campaign or retreat. This made it impossible for the Swiss forces to act as a unit. The system of command consisted two captains elected as commanders-in-chief, besides the captains of the individual companies, as well as one representative elected by the men-at-arms of each canton. These commanders would vote on the policy of the Swiss army. In practice, this system broke down as soon as it was put to the test: the captains decided to honour the agreement not to attack, while the representatives of the troops, especially those of Uri, Schwyz, and Glarus, decided to attack regardless, motivated by the prospect of rich spoils.

==Results==

===French side===
“I have vanquished those whom only Caesar vanquished” was printed on the medal King Francis ordered struck to commemorate the victory. Considering the battle his most cherished triumph, Francis requested that he himself be knighted on the battlefield, in the ancient style, by the hand of none other than the Chevalier Bayard. Marshal Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, veteran of every war for the previous 40 years, praised Marignano as the “battle of giants” and stated that compared to it, all previous battles in his lifetime had been “child’s sport”.

Marignano established the superiority of French cast bronze artillery and gendarme cavalry over the heretofore invincible phalanx tactics of the Swiss infantry. French success at Marignano, however, eventually galvanized opposition in the divided peninsula and turned the European balance of power against Francis I. In the meantime, however, Francis gained the city, and more importantly, the Castello Sforzesco within it, the strategic key to control of Lombardy. There Massimiliano Sforza and his Swiss mercenaries and the cardinal-bishop of Sion retreated, only submitting when French sappers had placed mines under the foundations. The French regained Milan, and Massimiliano went into luxurious exile with a French purse of 30,000 ducats.

===Swiss side===
The retreating Swiss army retained control of their upper-Lombardy provinces of Bellinzona and adjacent valleys, leaving a rearguard to preside over them.

The battle ended once and for all Swiss aspirations in Milan, and the Swiss Confederacy never again went to war against France or Milan.
In fact, the Confederacy never went to war again at all after 1525, and (apart from the conquest of Vaud by the canton of Bern acting on its own in 1536) there never was any Swiss military offensive against an external enemy again. Swiss historiography has tended to attribute this to the &quot;lesson learned&quot; at Marignano, but at least as effective was the division created by the Swiss Reformation in the 1520s, dividing the Confederacy into two factions which would be occupied with internal hostilities throughout the period of the European Wars of Religion, as well as a number of painful defeats of Swiss mercenary regiments in the decade between 1515 and 1525 (at Bicocca, Sesia and Pavia).

===Perpetual Peace===
After lengthy negotiations, a peace treaty between the Thirteen Cantons and their allies (abbot and city of St. Gallen, Three Leagues, Valais, Mulhouse) on one hand and Francis as both King of France and Duke of Milan on the other was signed in Fribourg on 29 November 1516. In the treaty of Fribourg, known as &quot;Perpetual Peace&quot; (&quot;Ewiger Frieden&quot;, &quot;Paix perpétuelle&quot;), the Swiss Confederacy renounced all claims to the protectorate of Milan. In return, France paid 700,000 gold crowns in compensation to the Confederacy. Both parties agreed to abstain from giving any support to enemies of the other party (with the exception of pre-existing treaties) and agreed on an arrangement of arbitration in the case of future disputes. France offered another 300,000 crowns if the Swiss were willing to yield their transmontane territories (except for Bellinzona), but this offer was declined. The treaty furthermore granted trade privileges to the Swiss, both in Milan and in Lyon. Only the Ossola valley was passed back to Milan, while the other transmontane bailiwicks of the Swiss Confederacy remain part of Switzerland to this day, since 1803 as the canton Ticino (while the Three Leagues lost control of the Valtellina in 1797).

The &quot;Perpetual Peace&quot; with France was indeed kept for the remainder of the lifetime of the Kingdom of France, and was broken only during the French Revolutionary Wars, when the French Republic invaded Switzerland in 1798.
It opened a period of close ties between the Swiss Confederacy with France over the next three centuries (while at the same time Switzerland moved away from its association with the Holy Roman Empire). A next step of rapprochement to France was the service pact (&quot;Soldbündnis&quot;) with France, concluded in 1521, which made Swiss mercenary regiments a regular part of the French armed forces (see &quot;Gardes Suisses&quot;).
This arrangement also outlasted three centuries, with four Swiss regiments participating in Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia in 1812, foreign military service of Swiss citizens being finally outlawed in 1848 with the formation of Switzerland as a federal state.

===Other===
On 11 December 1515, Francis met with Pope Leo X in Bologna. After several lengthy conversations, it was agreed that Francis would renounce the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, and the pope would accept Francis&#x27; demands in the matter of the selection of French bishops. The terms of a concordat between France and the Papacy were negotiated by plenipotentiaries over the following six weeks, granting the king of France, among other things, the right to nominate candidates for all vacancies in bishoprics or abbeys, subject to confirmation by the pope. The Concordat was signed by Pope Leo X on 15 August 1516.

Also at the meeting in Bologna was Leonardo da Vinci, whom Francis persuaded to accompany him back to France, and granted him the Clos Lucé manor and a pension of 7,000 scudi.

Also present at the battle was Huldrych Zwingli, who since 1506 had been church patron at Glarus. In Glarus, there was political controversy on which side the young men seeking employment as mercenaries should take service, the side of France or that of the Holy Roman Empire and the Papal States.
The aim was to prevent that men of Glarus took service on both sides of the war, which would result in the unhappy constellation of &quot;brothers fighting brothers&quot; on the battlefield, as had been the case at Novara in 1500.
Zwingli had supported the Pope before Marignano, and even after the battle, he opposed the peace with France and continued to support the side of the Papal States.
Since public opinion in Glarus had shifted towards a clearly pro-French stance after the peace of 1516, Zwingli was forced to abandon his position in Glarus. He took employment at Einsiedeln, and from 1519 in Zürich.
Based on his experience in the Italian War, Zwingli became an outspoken opponent of mercenary service, arguing with Erasmus of Rotterdam that &quot;war is sweet only to those who have not experienced it&quot; (&quot;dulce bellum inexpertis&quot;). He also blamed the warmongery on the part of cardinal Schiner for the disaster at Marignano and began to preach against the &quot;red caps&quot; (&quot;rote hüetlin&quot;, i.e. the high clergy), the first signs of his radicalization that would culminate in the Swiss Reformation during the decade following Marignano.

==Legacy and commemoration==

Commemorating the event are a bas-relief of the Battle of Marignano by Pierre Bontemps, which decorates Francis I&#x27;s tomb at Saint-Denis; a painting by Antoine Caron for Fontainebleau (now at the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa); and the most famous musical composition of Clément Janequin, the chanson &quot;La guerre&quot;. The Swiss hero Hans Bär appears in a fresco on the tower of the Basel City Hall. The march Marignan (Marignano in the French language), composed in 1939 by Jean Daetwyler, is the official orchestral hymn of the Swiss canton Valais.

<text>SK Sigma Olomouc is a Czech professional football club based in the city of Olomouc. The club currently competes in the Czech First League, the first tier of Czech football. The club played in the first tier league for 30 years between 1984 and 2014, winning the Czech Cup and Czech Supercup in 2012. Being relegated to the Czech National Football League in 2014, the club won the league the subsequent season and were promoted back to the First League in 2015, but failed to stay in the top division and were relegated after only one season.

==History==
The club was founded as FK Hejčín Olomouc in 1919, playing in the national top league for the first time in the 1982–83 season as Sigma ZTS Olomouc. The club next played in the Czechoslovak First League in the 1984–85 season, remaining in the top level of football for the rest of the Czechoslovak era. Olomouc reached the quarterfinals of the 1991–92 UEFA Cup, their best result in the competition. In the following season&#x27;s competition, the club beat Turkish side Fenerbahçe 7–1 in the second leg of their second round tie and 7–2 on aggregate, before going out of the competition at the hands of Italian team Juventus.

The club qualified to play European football in 1996 after finishing as runners-up in the 1995–96 Czech First League.

Olomouc finished fourth in the 1998–99 Czech First League, again qualifying for European competition. The club was fined 5,000 Swiss francs in October 1999 for racist chanting in a UEFA Cup match against Real Mallorca&#x27;s black players.

In August 2011, the club was fined 4 million Czech koruna and deducted nine points as a result of a corruption enquiry by the Football Association of the Czech Republic. Olomouc won the Czech Cup that season, but were banned by UEFA from competing in the subsequent UEFA Europa League due to the corruption sanctions. In 2014 the club finished 15th in the league, resulting in their relegation after 30 years in the top level of competition.

<doc id="895512" wikidata="Q7776898" url="?curid=895512" title="The Zone (YTV)">
<text>The Zone is the flagship weekday afternoon programming block on the Canadian television channel YTV. It currently airs between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. ET and PT in Canada. On Saturday mornings, it is called The Zone Weekend (formerly &quot;Crunch&quot;), broadcasting between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.

Occasionally, guests appear on &quot;The Zone&quot;, such as children&#x27;s author Robert Munsch and environmentalist David Suzuki.

==Current version==
Currently, The Zone is unhosted; YTV dropped program jockeys in summer 2023 due to cuts from Corus CEO Doug Murphy.

==History and current developments==

&quot;The Zone&quot; began its life as the &quot;Afterschool Zone&quot; on YTV, debuting on September 2, 1991, with its first host Gordon Michael Woolvett (aka Gord the PJ Man).
 Other PJs would take turns hosting the block including PJ Phil (Phil Guerrero), PJ Robb (Rob Stefaniuk) and PJ Rockin&#x27; Chan (Chandra Galasso).

The &quot;Afterschool Zone&quot; was simply a small segment that played between airings of regular television programming, primarily as an entertaining segue into the next programming block to retain viewers and to provide some level of interaction with its young audience. Similar programming existed on YTV&#x27;s weekend morning broadcasts, also starring a variety of hosts, labelled &quot;PJs&quot;, or program jockeys, as a take on DJ (disc jockey) and VJ (video jockey). This was done primarily as a tactic to comply with Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission restrictions on advertising in children&#x27;s programming: popular imported programming would run a few minutes short due to fewer ads being permitted compared to US stations. Instead of filling the time with public service announcements or other filler material (which had been the previous practice of YTV in the late 1980s/early 1990s), the idea of devoting several minutes between programs to an interaction between live-action hosts was used and has proven successful to this day.

Eventually, the PJs were joined by a variety of puppets named the Grogs in 1992.

The &quot;Afterschool&quot; portion of the title was dropped in 1993 and PJ &quot;Fresh&quot; Phil was sometimes joined by another PJ, Jenn (although she featured more prominently during weekend morning programming and was rarely on The Zone). The segments usually involved discussion or banter on various topics, video clips, previews, and viewer mail.

July 1994 saw the introduction of the animatronic character Snit (Atul N. Rao), which displayed a pair of moving teeth on a television screen covered with what appeared to be purple bubble gum. When a primetime version of The Zone, &quot;YTV Shift&quot;, was cancelled, its former host Paul McGuire joined Phil. On October 31, 1997, the Phil and Daryn Jones sent Snit into space, and Snit was replaced with the prop Elvays, a plastic Elvis head with a digitally added moving mouth.

Eventually, a week of programming was devoted to a plotline that featured PJs Phil and Paul on a quest hunting for extraterrestrials and making a discovery. This discovery was revealed to be the return of the Snit character (minus its familiar purple colouring). Following cosmetic and technological upgrades, Snit went on to host &quot;Snit Station&quot;, a weekend morning programming block on September 18, 1999. The block was later renamed &quot;The Vortex&quot; before it was renamed &quot;CRUNCH&quot;.

A female co-host, Sandra Jackson, was added to the Zone in 1999. She began hosting alongside McGuire and Phil.

Another voice on the show was Egghead (the director Greg Dickinson, who worked on &quot;The Zone&quot; from 1993-2008) Egghead&#x27;s face was never seen. He also appeared several times as &quot;the guy in the gorilla suit&quot;.

As a slight format change, the &quot;You Rule!&quot; campaign was replaced with a &quot;Keep it Weird!&quot; theme. When the New Year came, Jackson, McGuire, and Phil were found to not be &quot;Y2K Compatible&quot; and left The Zone on November 12, 1999, venturing into other opportunities. 

The following week starting November 15, 1999, they were replaced with comedian Pat Kelly and Jennifer Racicot (previously PJ Katie on Treehouse, with no relation to the original PJ Jenn or PJ Jazzy Jan). Elvays was replaced with &quot;the Hand in the Toilet&quot;.

While Racicot and Kelly were hosts, they formed the band &quot;Nuclear Donkey&quot;, which was featured at the end of the YTV&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Big Fun Party Mix&quot; (with the exception of 7, 8, and 10).

During February and March 2001, a plotline emerged involving electronic insects known as Yokomites that were under the control of a mysterious chicken-man named Friendly Fowl. They were created by Fowl to destroy the station, should his demand to be given the station was ignored. In the end, there was an animated comic where Kelly and Racicot went into the Yokomites&#x27; lair to defeat them. The hand in the toilet was &quot;killed&quot; when it saved them.

With Racicot&#x27;s departure, Kelly had a brief breakdown as a one-week plotline, where he demanded a new co-host or he would no longer host. He built a giant wooden crate in the studio parking lot and locked himself inside it as a protest until YTV hired a new co-host. At the end of the week Sugar Beard came along claiming to be Kelly&#x27;s new co-host and she opened the crate with a crowbar to reveal a dishevelled Kelly who was in desperate need of a shower. The two co-hosted the block afterwards. However, Kelly himself soon also departed in early 2002, leaving Beard as the lone host. A plotline emerged where Beard would discover that one of the YTV&#x27;s janitors was playing with the cameras during off-hours, clandestinely acting out as a host for &quot;The Zone&quot;. Employing detective skills to track down this janitor, Beard eventually discovered Carlos Bustamante and invited him to become her co-host in 2002, a position he held until 2018.

Beard and Bustamante hosted together from 2002-2007, introducing such segments as &quot;A Dash of Sugar&quot; and &quot;Late Afternoon With Tito Lemmy&quot;, along with many characters such as Van Vogel, Pretty Tiffany, Johnny &quot;The Brick&quot; Wahl, and Wiwyam Birdie. They also co-wrote six songs together as the band &quot;Nuclear Donkey&quot;.

On January 19, 2007, Beard announced that she would leave &quot;The Zone&quot; on January 26, 2007. Sugar&#x27;s last &quot;Nuclear Donkey&quot; song, &quot;Z-Dot&quot;, appeared on &quot;Big Fun Party Mix 8&quot;, a compilation from YTV.

Bustamante hosted &quot;The Zone&quot; alone until Monday, December 31, 2007, on &quot;The Zone&quot;&#x27;s Countdown to Halfway to New Year&#x27;s party, where he introduced his new co-host, Joyce Quansah. She had recently appeared on &quot;The Zone&quot; working at the Tree Farm, where Bustamante chose &quot;The Zone&quot;s Christmas Tree. Quansah co-hosted until January 2, 2009, when she left to travel the world. In fall 2009, &quot;The Zone&quot; returned to starting at 3:00 p.m. instead of 4:00 p.m.

In October 2013, two new hosts were announced, &quot;The Next Star&quot;&#x27;s Mark &quot;Suki&quot; Suknanan and TFC&#x27;s Rachel Bonnetta. Suknanan is responsible for all things celebrities and Bonnetta talks about the latest trends. These are the first two new cast members since Andrew Chapman.

On December 31, 2013, Chapman announced he was leaving &quot;The Zone&quot;.

In November 2014, Bonnetta and Adam Christie left &quot;The Zone&quot;, and Lisa Gilroy from &quot;Undercover High&quot; got added to the team. Around the same time, a brand new contest called &quot;The Z-Head Zearch&quot; was introduced asking fans to submit videos to be aired on &quot;The Zone&quot;.

On January 7, 2017, Meisha Watson began co-hosting &quot;The Zone Weekend&quot;.

On May 23, 2018, Spencer Litzinger joined &quot;The Zone&quot;.

On December 3, 2018, Bustamante left YTV after 16 years to become a full-time reporter for Entertainment Tonight Canada, on YTV&#x27;s sister network Global.

On March 22, 2019, Watson left YTV and her hosting duties of &quot;The Zone&quot; and &quot;The Zone Weekend&quot;.

On March 23, 2019, Litzinger started co-hosting &quot;The Zone Weekend&quot;.

On September 3, 2019, Tyra Sweet joined &quot;The Zone&quot;. She left the block in 2022.

On October 26, 2019, Suknanan left &quot;The Zone&quot; and &quot;The Zone Weekend&quot; to be on &quot;Canada&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; as his drag alter ego Priyanka. He later won the first season of the show.

In March 2020, Alex Wierzbicki joined &quot;The Zone&quot;. Around the same time, the COVID-19 lockdowns were implemented in Canada. The Zone continued in the place of the hosts&#x27; room, called &quot;Zone From Home&quot;

On June 6, 2022, Melony Manikavasagar joined &quot;The Zone&quot;.

On October 13, 2022, Alex Wierzbicki announced his departure from The Zone to move on to different projects. His final segment aired on October 31. 

In summer 2023, Corus fired Spencer, Melony, and Kelsey, all hosts of the Zone due to cuts from Corus CEO Doug Murphy, therefore dropping program jockeys. Currently, The Zone is unhosted. Spencer sometimes still makes guest appearances sometimes.

==Set Changes==
When &quot;The Afterschool Zone&quot; began as a regular block on September 2, 1991, the set consisted of a multicoloured living room with abstract shapes and a map of Canada.

In late 1993, when the block was renamed to &quot;The Zone&quot;, the set featured a grey background with YTV written on the walls and a TV next to the host that showed what was being broadcast on TV.

In 1994, the set was changed to a more common, all-blue set with graffiti and eyeballs. In this set, you can see the red lizard with the 1991–1995 YTV wordmark. In 1994, Snit was added.

From 1998 to late 1999, the set was changed to have a purple and black spiral floor with &quot;The Zone&quot; logo in the middle and green walls. A large rotating fan was built into the wall. There was a couch and chairs for the host and guests. Later, a toilet with a TV inside was added.

In November 1999, it was changed to a subway train set that featured a TV set and Metro print ads-styled block bumpers of &quot;The Zone&quot;. There is also an orange checkerboard floor. The change coincided with a change in hosts.

In 2002, the set was changed to match YTV&#x27;s 2002–2007 look. The set was redesigned to feature a new logo of &quot;The Zone&quot;. There is also a silver fan.

In 2007, after Sugar left, the subway train set from 1999 to 2007 was gone, so the set was redesigned as a center stage with liquid stuff on it, and featuring the block&#x27;s logo in the middle of the floor. There were also HDTVs that were standing through the set. The walls also gained a green colour scheme.

In 2010, the set was simplified, the set now has lights under it and the words &quot;The Zone&quot; are put back. The walls are now glowing purple, sometimes other colours for certain occasions. The TVs are now put to the shelf again. In 2013, the entire set gained a green colour scheme.

In 2020, each host of The Zone received their own individual sets to practice physical distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each of their sets was decorated accordingly to the host. Occasionally, they will film segments outside at &quot;Sherbourne Common&quot;.

In late 2021, the individual sets have been removed after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, allowing the hosts to be together on camera. They filmed Zone segments in the lobby of Corus Quay, in front of a wood slat wall.

<text>Surface warfare is naval warfare involving surface ships. It is one of the four operational areas of naval warfare, the others being underwater warfare, aerial warfare, and information warfare. Surface warfare is the oldest and most basic form of naval warfare, though modern surface warfare doctrine originated in the mid-20th century.

==Description==
Modern surface warfare dates from the mid-20th century, when surface, air, and submarine warfare components were blended together as a tactical unit to achieve strategic objectives. In United States Navy doctrine, the two most important strategic objectives are interdiction and sea control.

* Interdiction is the process of intercepting an enemy transiting through a location. For example, German naval objectives against Britain during World War II&#x27;s Battle of the Atlantic were primarily focused on preventing ships from arriving intact with their cargoes.
* Sea control is the dominance of force over a given area that prevents other naval forces from operating successfully. For example, the mission of the Allied navies in the Atlantic during World War II was to maintain sea control and prevent Axis naval forces from operating. The Anti-access/area denial is an opposition to enemy&#x27;s sea control without itself being an attempt to gain sea control.

Surface warfare (SuW) is conducted by a surface ship to eliminate a threat, which may include Anti-surface warfare (ASuW), anti-air warfare (AAW), anti-submarine warfare (ASW), naval gunfire support (NGFS), riverine operations, mine warfare, and electronic warfare.

In the second half of the 20th century, the importance of naval surface power was reduced as air and submarine warfare platforms demonstrated their capabilities, as in the Battle of Taranto, the Battle of Pearl Harbor, and the sinking of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot;.

Following World War II, guided anti-ship missiles required new tactics and doctrines. Small, fast, relatively cheap missile boats became a threat for large ships, much more serious than previous torpedo boats, as in the War of Attrition, when Egyptian missile boats struck and sank the Israeli destroyer &quot;Eilat&quot; on 20 October 1967.

==Ships==
Surface combatant ships include battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and others. Surface combatants also include mine warfare ships, amphibious command ships, coastal defense ships, amphibious assault ships, and many others. An important facet of naval warfare are however the support ships (that is, non-combat ships): freighters, oilers, hospital ships, tugs, troop transports, and other auxiliary ships. In the U.S. Navy model, now widespread in the world, various types of ships would be primarily organized into the carrier battle group.

<doc id="895549" wikidata="Q6563167" url="?curid=895549" title="List of BBC Radio programmes adapted for television">
<text>Many BBC radio comedy programmes have been successful enough for the writers and performers to adapt them into television programmes. Unless otherwise stated these programmes were originally broadcast on BBC Radio 4, and then broadcast on one of the BBC&#x27;s TV channels. The following list gives some of the more notable ones.

==Television to radio transfers==
Some television series transfer in the other direction. Both the science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; have become short-lived radio series. Several comedies, such as &quot;To the Manor Born&quot; (in 1997) and &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;, have also been transferred.

As another example, in 2004 the Andy Hamilton comedy &quot;Trevor&#x27;s World of Sport&quot; transferred to Radio 4. Having largely failed in its television incarnation, it was felt the older medium might suit it better. This would seem to create the impression that, whereas popular radio shows are &quot;promoted&quot; to television, an unpopular television show was being &quot;demoted&quot; to radio. However, public opinion on the radio series has been mostly positive, suggesting that it was a good decision.

==Radio programmes transferred to independent television==
* A few early game shows from Radio Luxembourg transferred to ITV, when it started broadcasting in 1955. This included &quot;Take Your Pick&quot; and &quot;Double Your Money&quot;.

<doc id="895551" wikidata="Q175687" url="?curid=895551" title="FC Dnipro">
<text>Football Club Dnipro (, ) was a Ukrainian football club based in Dnipro. The club played its last season in the 2018–19 Ukrainian Amateur League. The club was owned by Ukrainian businessman Ihor Kolomoyskyi.

In 2018, FC Dnipro was forced into bankruptcy by FIFA due to multiple legal claims for failing to pay the promised monetary compensation to players and managers. SC Dnipro-1 formerly existed as an unofficial successor.

The club was founded in 1918. During the Soviet era, the club was a member of the Soviet Volunteer Sports Society &quot;Metallurg&quot; (therefore it carried names Metallurg/Metalurh and Stal) and until 1961 was under sponsorship of the Petrovsky Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Plant. After that, the club was sponsored by the Southern Machine-building Plant Yuzhmash and carried both names Russian Dnepr and Ukrainian Dnipro, while Dnepr was also used for international competitions. During the Soviet era, the club was the second most successful club, based in Ukraine, that participated in the Soviet Top League, winning in 1983 and 1988. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the club was privatized.

==History==

===BRIT===
The club was formed in 1918 by the Petrovsky factory and was called BRIT (Brianskyi Robitnychyi Industrialnyi Tekhnikum). The team participated in the regional competition, the Katerynoslav championship. BRIT played its games in the &quot;Sokil&quot; stadium, a small venue located at the corner of Pushkin and Yuriy Savchenko streets, which it shared with four other clubs.

===Petrovets – Stal – Metalurh===
With the outbreak of World War I, BRIT was disbanded until 9 May 1925, when a new team was formed in Dnipropetrovsk. The team participated during the first season under the name &quot;Petrovsky factory,&quot; which was changed in 1926 to &quot;Petrovets.&quot; The team entered the first Soviet competition under the name of &quot;Stal&quot; (steel) in 1936, participating in three championships before World War II. In 1947, the team re-entered the Soviet competition after merging with another club from Dnipropetrovsk, Dynamo Dnipropetrovsk. From 1949 until 1961, the team was called &quot;Metalurh&quot; (&quot;metal worker&quot;). From 1950 to 1952, it was relegated to amateur status due to poor results. In 1954, &quot;Metalurh Dnipropetrovsk&quot; reached the semi-finals of the USSR Cup, where it lost to Spartak Yerevan.

===Dnepr / Dnipro===
In 1961, the team was handed over to its new sponsor, the &quot;Yugmash&quot; (the Southern machine-producing factory), which at that time was one of the most powerful factories in the entire Soviet Union and was funded by the Ministry of Defense. It was part of the Zenit volunteer sports society. The new sponsor changed the team&#x27;s name to &quot;Dnepr/Dnipro&quot; after the Dnieper River. For the All-Union competitions such as Soviet Cup and the Soviet Top League as well as the international competitions there was used Russian version of the name as the Russian was the accepted language of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, while at republican level (within the Ukrainian SSR) Ukrainian version of the name was used. The team&#x27;s performance did not change much until after 1968, when &quot;Dnepr&quot; obtained Andriy Biba and the new coach – Valery Lobanovsky. After that, it took the team three years to get promoted to the Soviet Top League and eventually finished in sixth place in 1972.

===Golden generation===
In 1973 and 1976, Dnepr reached the semi-finals of the USSR Cup. In 1978, the team was relegated to the lower league for two years. Their next return to the top flight was not as inviting as their first one and the team languished at the bottom of the table for several years. In the following years, the governing body of the team hired new promising coaches – &quot;Volodymyr Yemets&quot; and &quot;Hennadiy Zhizdik&quot;. After those changes, &quot;Dnepr&quot; became a strong contender for the Soviet championship winning it twice: once with Yemets and Zhizdik in 1983, and another one with Yevhen Kucherevsky in 1988. Also, in 1989 &quot;Dnepr&quot; became the first professional football club in the Soviet Union. During those years, the team featured many notable players such as Oleg Protasov, Hennadiy Lytovchenko, Oleksiy Cherednyk and Oleh Taran.

===Ukrainian independence===
Just before the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1989 the club was transformed into a professional football club instead of the Soviet &quot;team of masters&quot;, a process through which all Soviet teams of masters went through. The club joined the football federation of the native country and remained one of the top contenders in the newly formed Ukrainian Premier League. The team received a silver medal in 1993, as well as the bronze in 1992, 1995, 1996, 2001 and 2004. The team also reached the Ukrainian Cup finals in 1995, 1997 and 2004, losing all three to Shakhtar Donetsk. In the beginning of the 1990s the control of the club took over a native of Rivne Ihor Bakai with his &quot;Respublika&quot; corporation who earlier in the 1980s was governor of the SKA Karpaty Lviv training center, part of the Carpathian Military District. Bakai who invited Bernd Stange to Dnipro became first who hired foreign manager to head the former Soviet club. At that time Bakai was a member of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) and a chairman of the Intergaz corporation which had exclusive rights of importing gas to Ukraine from Turkmenistan and in Ukraine was unofficially referred to as the &quot;Gaz King&quot;. The experience of the former manager of East Germany national football team Bernd Stange in Dnipro was described in the biographic book that was published in Germany in 2004 &quot;Trainer zwischen den Welten. Bernd Stange&quot; (Coach between the Worlds. Bernd Stange).

During the summer of 1996 Dnipro initiated &quot;repositioning&quot; of its best players along with Bernd Stange to CSKA-Borysfen which in the previous season placed 4th just behind Dnipro. Among those players were Oleksandr Yevtushok, Viktor Skrypnyk, Serhiy Kovalets, Serhiy Mizin, Andriy Polunin, Serhiy Nahornyak, Volodymyr Sharan, Oleksandr Palyanytsya. However, just few day before the start of the 1996–97 season in Ukrainian Vyshcha Liha (Higher League), on the joint session of the Professional Football League (PFL) and the Football Federation of Ukraine (FFU), CSKA-Borysfen was taken away from its original owners and handed over to Mikhail Grinshpon (&quot;Kiev-Donbass&quot;) connected with Semion Mogilevich. With the transfer of Dnipro players falling completely through, players ended up in danger of missing a season.

===Success and downfall===
On 14 May 2015, Dnipro qualified for the 2015 UEFA Europa League Final by defeating Napoli 1–0 in Ukraine after having drawn 1–1 in Italy, the first time in the club&#x27;s history that it reached the final in a European competition. Despite going up 1–0 in the sixth minute against Spanish side Sevilla, Dnipro eventually lost 3–2. Despite the defeat, the match crowned one of the club&#x27;s greatest seasons, during which Dnipro had to play all of their home matches some 400 kilometres away in Kyiv due to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. On 31 March 2016, the club was excluded by UEFA from participating in the next UEFA club competition for which it would otherwise qualify in the next three seasons (2016–17, 2017–18 and 2018–19) for violating the Financial Fair Play regulations.

In late June 2016, there were rumours that club owner Ihor Kolomoyskyi had stopped funding the club. Kolomoyskyi immediately denied this but did state, &quot;The club will not exist in the same form as before;&quot; and that it was &quot;not normal to spend crazy amounts of money&quot; to keep the current squad intact.

The 2016–17 season was disastrous for Dnipro. Due to outstanding debts owed to coach Juande Ramos and his staff, the FFU prevented Dnipro from signing new players other than free agents. On 26 October 2016, Dnipro was assessed a penalty of 6 points for the same reason. In April 2017, 3 additional points were deducted. At the conclusion of the 2016–2017 season, Dnipro were relegated directly to the Ukrainian Second League (third level) for the first time in club history.

In the 2017–18 season, the club with a new squad started well in the Group B of the Second League, for 13 matches in row going on high positions (second-fourth places). But the points have been deducted once more with their number reaching up to 18 until the end of the season, which resulted in club finishing on 8th place.

On 7 June 2018, FIFA decided to once more relegate the club and for the 2018–19 season the club was to play 
in the Amateur League. In the 2019–20 Amateur League the club did not participate. In 2019, some players, coaching, and managing staff joined SC Dnipro-1, particularly the whole coaching staff of Dnipro in full composition was appointed to the Dnipro-1&#x27;s under-21 team.

On 22 February 2021, FIFA dismissed the claim of Jaba Kankava who appealed with a request to recognize SC Dnipro-1 a sports successor of FC Dnipro in order to recover his unpaid salary from FC Dnipro.

===Reserves and the Academy===

Soon after being promoted to the Pervaya Liga (Soviet First League), in 1971 FC Dnipro built its own training grounds in a remote neighborhood of Dnipro, Prydniprovsk. Until 1971, the senior team&#x27;s reserves were based at the Yuzhmash resort &quot;Dubrava&quot;.

===Stadiums===

Since 1966, Dnipro&#x27;s home was Meteor Stadium in Dnipropetrovsk. Prior to that, the club played at the Metalurh Stadium (formerly Stal Stadium). Meteor Stadium was built by the Soviet rocket company Yuzhmash on the original site and has undergone several renovations since, the last one being in 2001. In 2002, however, after several spells in European competitions, it became clear that the club needed a new modern venue. Thus, in 2005, Pryvat Group started construction of Dnipro Arena in the centre of the city. The club played its last game at Meteor on 2 September 2008, against Metalist Kharkiv.

In April 2005, the club&#x27;s new arena broke ground. It was constructed by Germany&#x27;s largest construction company Hochtief. The construction itself took three years and four months, but a nine-month delay occurred due to a land dispute over a site where the stadium&#x27;s car park was planned. The stadium&#x27;s final capacity is 31,003 people and the initial estimated cost of the construction was set at €40 million.

The stadium was opened on 15 September 2008. The opening ceremony featured a speech by Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko, a concert performance by a number of famous Ukrainian musicians and two football matches: Veterans of Dynamo Kyiv vs. Spartak Moscow veterans, and Dnipro against Dynamo Kyiv. As a gift to the club from the city, the street that the stadium is situated on was renamed into Kucherevskyi Boulevard, in honour of Dnipro&#x27;s late coach Yevhen Kucherevskyi. Dnipro played their first official game on 29 September 2008 against their local rivals Metalurh Zaporizhya, but Dnipro lost 1–2. They set a new attendance record for the Ukrainian Premier League 2008–09 season at 31,000 spectators.

Since the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Dnipro have played their European matches at the Olympic Stadium in Kyiv at the behest of UEFA, although there has been comparatively less conflict in Dnipropetrovsk than other areas.

==Supporters and rivalries==
The first fan club in Dnipropetrovsk (today Dnipro) was officially registered by the city executive committee (ispolkom) on 25 July 1968. Before registration, the initiative group brought its draft of the fan&#x27;s club statute and program to the regional committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, department in control of development and propaganda of physical culture and sport in the region which imposed a resolution of approval with a signature, seal and date. Later the group met with the Dnipro head coach Leonid Rodos and his assistant.

The formation of the fan movement in Dnipropetrovsk began in the early 1980s, which saw the appearance of the first representatives of Dnipro ultras at the stadium. Later was established one of the largest fans unions – the &quot;Braty po Zbroyi&quot; () – involving Dnipro, Dynamo Kyiv and Karpaty Lviv.

Most of the fans hold right-wing ideological views (Ukrainian nationalism). Dnipro is considered the third most popular club in Ukraine, and home and away matches are attended by large crowds. The largest Dnipro ultras groups are the &quot;Voice of the North Stand&quot; () and &quot;Ultras&#x27;83&quot; (83).

The most famous derby in eastern Ukraine is the &quot;Skhidne Derby&quot; (English: Eastern Derby) between Dnipro and Metalist Kharkiv. The game at the stadium is very hard and almost every game ends in a fight between football fans from Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv. There was also a city derby in Dnipropetrovsk between Dnipro and Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih. In May 2016, Metalist Kharkiv was removed from Ukraine&#x27;s professional football leagues. Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih is, after its 2013 bankruptcy, an amateur club.

<text>Fettercairn (, ) is a small village in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, northwest of Laurencekirk in Aberdeenshire on the B966 from Edzell. Fettercairn is also reached via the Cairn O&#x27; Mount road (B974) from Deeside.

The name comes from the Scottish Gaelic &quot;Fothair&quot; and the Pictish &quot;carden&quot; and means &quot;slope by a thicket&quot;. The name appeared as Fotherkern in c. 970.

In the 2011 national census, Fettercairn had a population of 353.

==Overview==
The shaft of the old 16th century Kincardine Mercat cross stands in the square, and is notched to show the measurements of a Scottish ell. Nearby the ruins of the long since abandoned county town and royal castle of Kincardine (Gaelic: &quot;Cinn Chàrdainn&quot; meaning &quot;The head of the copse&quot;, including the Pictish word carden, &quot;copse&quot; ) similarly Fettercairn (Gaelic: &quot;Fothair Chàrdainn&quot; meaning &quot;Shelving or terraced slope at the copse&quot;, containing Pictish carden) Kincardine stood about northeast of Fettercairn, and by the end of the 16th century had declined to a mere hamlet, being represented now only by xv. 26 the ruins of the royal castle and an ancient burial-ground.

A memorial archway erected in 1864 commemorates the 1861 visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, while staying at Balmoral. Leaves from the journal of our life in the highlands describes aspects of their visit. Queen Victoria writes &quot;At a quarter-past seven o&#x27;clock we reached the small quiet town, or rather village, of Fettercairn, for it was very small-not a creature stirring, and we got out at the quiet little inn, &quot;Ramsay Arms&quot; quite unobserved&quot;. &quot;Louis and General Grey had rooms in an hotel, called &quot;The Temperance Hotel&quot; opposite&quot;. &quot;The evening being bright and moonlight and very still, we all went, and walked through the whole village, where not a creature moved:- through the principal little square, in the middle of which was a sort of pillar or Town Cross on steps, and Louis read, by the light of the moon, a proclamation for collections of charities which was stuck on it&quot;. &quot;Suddenly we heard a drum and fifes!&quot;. &quot;As we walked slowly back, we heard the noise from time to time- and when we reached the inn door, we stopped and saw six men march up with fifes and a drum (not a creature taking any notice of them), go down the street and back again&quot;. &quot;Albert asked the little maid, and the answer was, &quot;It&#x27;s just a band&quot; and that it walked about in this way twice a week. How odd! It went on playing some time after we got home&quot;.

Historically Fettercairn lies at the southern end of the Monboddo Estate, where the Scottish philosopher and precursor of evolutionary thought, James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, lived. Fettercairn houses the Fettercairn distillery (owned by Whyte and Mackay Ltd.) that produces the &quot;Fettercairn 1824&quot; single malt whisky.

== History ==
In 1504 Fettercairn was granted the status of a free burgh of barony, with the right to hold a weekly market and an annual fair that was dedicated to St Mark. The market and fair brought a period of growth and prosperity to the village which lasted until the village was sacked and burned by the army of the Marquis of Montrose in 1645 during as part of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Five years later, in 1650, Montrose would pass through Fettercairn, bound hand and foot on horseback, on his way to his execution in Edinburgh after being betrayed by Neil Macleod of Assynt.

=== 18 to 19th centuries ===
John Barclay founded the Berean protestant sect in Fettercairn in the late 18th century. Barclay was appointed the assistant to the Fettercairn parish minister, Antony Dow, in 1763. Although his charisma made him popular with the congregation, his antinomianist leanings resulted in Barclay being ostracised by the church hierarchy. In 1772, lacking a patron as then required by the church, he was rejected as successor after the death of Dow, and was also refused by the presbytery the testimonials required in order to obtain another living. Following his rejection, Barclay and his followers seceded, to form the first Berean congregation under his ministry. A place of worship was erected at Sauchieburn (approximately 3 miles south of Fettercairn). Barclay remained minister until 1775 before leaving to found additional congregations in Edinburgh and London. 

Fettercairn Distillery was founded in 1824 by Alexander Ramsay, owner of the Fasque estate, who converted a corn mill at Nethermill into a distillery. After losing his fortune, Alexander was forced to sell the estate to the Sir John Gladstone in 1829. In 1973, Whyte &amp; Mackay acquired Fettercairn distillery and it has remained with the company since.

== Education ==
Primary education and nurseries services are provided in the village by Fettercairn Primary School. The school&#x27;s catchment area includes the village and the surrounding rural area, it has approximately 70 pupils. The current school building was built in 1963 and originally had only two classrooms, it was extended in 1974, adding an additional two classrooms and a nursery room.

The majority of students travel to Mearns Academy in Laurencekirk to attend secondary school.
