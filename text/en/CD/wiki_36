<text>Fallen Angel is an American fictional comic book heroine created and owned by writer Peter David and artist David López, who appeared in her own self-titled monthly series. The series was originally published by DC Comics from July 2003 until it was canceled with issue #20 in May 2005 due to low sales. A second series, published through IDW Publishing, began in December 2005 and ran for 33 issues. It was followed by two mini-series, &quot;Fallen Angel: Reborn&quot; and &quot;Fallen Angel: Return of the Son&quot;, also published by IDW Publishing.

While not completely without humor, it is a very dark book with morally ambiguous characters. It was also one of the few &quot;mature readers&quot; books that DC published outside of its Vertigo imprint and was created to serve as a &quot;bridge&quot; between the general-audience DC titles and its Vertigo titles.

The first series was illustrated in the typical pen-and-ink method of the comic book industry by penciller David López and inker Fernando Blanco. The first five-issue arc of the second series was painted by J. K. Woodward, though both Woodward and guest artists have utilized the traditional pen-and-ink method since then.

==Publication history==
===DC Comics===
Launched by DC comics in 2003, the book reportedly suffered from low sales by its eleventh issue. When asked why this might be, Peter David suggested that the comics industry as a whole is intolerant of new ideas, and that a sizable segment of comic buyers prefer to wait for a monthly comic to be collected into trade paperbacks, driving down monthly sales.

In August 2004, in response to complaints that some retailers weren&#x27;t stocking copies of &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; for interested fans to purchase, David announced that he would be producing a limited-edition autographed bookplate which could be attached to the &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; trade paperback, which he would send to both interested retailers and fans.

In January 2005, David confirmed that he had been told &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; would not continue past issue #20, despite a reportedly successful promotional effort. Sales on the title were reported to be around 11,000 copies, about 4000 short of what DC required for the title to be profitable.

===IDW Publishing===

At the 2005 WizardWorld: Philadelphia convention, DC Comics representative Bob Wayne stated that Peter David had decided to move &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; to IDW Publishing. This prompted a response from David himself, who confirmed the news, but cautioned that the final contracts were not yet signed. Several days later, David and IDW Editor in Chief Chris Ryall discussed the move in an interview, in which they revealed that while López retained his ownership in the property, he would not be the artist on the new series. &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; resumed publication as a five-issue limited series, which was expanded to a regular monthly series due to high sales.

Although López provided some of the covers, the bulk of the interior art, in the early stages of the series, was provided by J. K. Woodward. Other artists like Kristian Donaldson also did short runs.

The final issue of the second volume, which was published on January 21, 2009, saw the conclusion of that volume&#x27;s Moloch storyline, with God accepting Liandra back into heaven. The series was relaunched in July 2009 as &quot;Fallen Angel: Reborn&quot;, a four-issue mini-series featuring the character Illyria from Joss Whedon&#x27;s Buffyverse. A second four-issue mini-series, titled &quot;Fallen Angel: Return of the Son&quot;, was launched in January 2011.

==Premise==
The story focuses on Lee (also known as the Fallen Angel) who is arguably a superheroine residing in the city of Bete Noire. The city is completely riddled with corruption, and supernatural characters who emerge at night, and is managed by the Magistrate, who answers to a mysterious organization. Lee is possibly the only force for justice in the city.

The city of Bete Noire is as much a character as a setting. It has been revealed to be the Biblical city of Enoch. During the day the city has no crime at all, but at night it is a haven for crime and corruption. Known as &quot;the city that shapes the world&quot;, some say that the events that happen in the city influence major global events. Bete Noire is often said to possess a sentience of its own; the city decides who enters and leaves. When entering and exiting Bete Noire, Lee experiences the city as simply appearing or vanishing around a deserted road. Time passes differently in Bete Noire than it does outside of it. People born and raised in the city appear to age normally, but outsiders who come to live in it either age more slowly or experience a total cessation of aging.

Bete Noire is run by an organization known as The Hierarchy. Lee has said that even God has no dominion over Bete Noire; it is run exclusively by The Hierarchy. The Hierarchy, in turn, typically exerts its will through the city&#x27;s Magistrate. The Magistrate, a direct descendant of Cain, manages the city. The position of Magistrate is passed from firstborn son to firstborn son by means of a mystical ritual performed on or after the son&#x27;s eighteenth birthday. The Magistrate constantly hears the voices of the city and is plagued by visions. This perception causes the Magistrate excruciating pain, and he must learn to tolerate and ignore it. All Magistrates bear the mark of Cain, which renders them effectively immortal and impervious to harm. Magistrates are even able to mentally control the actions of those trying to do them harm. However, it appears that both former Magistrates and agents of the Hierarchy are able to hurt, and possibly even kill, a Magistrate. After passing the duties of Magistrate on to his firstborn son, Dr. Juris attempted to leave the city and experienced a fatal aging effect after he crossed the city limits. During his tenure, a Magistrate is granted one &quot;day off&quot; per year, during which he is permitted to leave the city.

===Characters===

====Liandra====
Liandra leads a joyous life as a guardian angel—&quot;The Boss&#x27;s favorite&quot;—until one of her charges, a girl named Holly, develops the ability to see her. They develop a close bond, and when Holly is abducted and murdered, Liandra is devastated. The murderer is acquitted on a technicality, and Liandra kills him. As a result, Liandra is stripped of her wings and cast down to Earth.

She eventually makes her way to Bete Noire, adopting the name &quot;Lee&quot;. She makes her base of operations in a bar called &quot;Furors&quot;. People come to her seeking her help and if she believes that they have been wronged, she helps them; however, if she thinks they deserve their fate, not only might she refuse to help them, she might also help to further their destruction. By day, she works as a physical education teacher at a girls&#x27; school, until it is destroyed by Slate. She is a very enigmatic person whose actions often seem contradictory; in one issue she tortures Black Mariah, and shortly thereafter she saves her life. For some time, she maintains a sexual relationship with Bete Noire&#x27;s Magistrate, Doctor Juris, who in many ways is her counterpart in the city. She eventually gives birth to his son, Jude, and secretly leaves him in the care of an orphanage. Lee is not the first to serve as &quot;protector&quot; of Bete Noire; she has had more than one predecessor.

Lee has several superhuman abilities, including immense physical strength, the ability to leap large distances, and to project some type of mystical energy from her body, often from her eyes. Her invulnerability is tied to her level of concentration, and she can be harmed if extremely fatigued or distracted. She has also stated that she has a superhuman sense of direction. Since being cast down, she cannot touch Earth&#x27;s soil, and so floats just above the ground when barefoot. Because of the nature of time in Bete Noire, Lee, who was not born in the city, ages more slowly than Bete Noire native-borns, but has yet experienced some aging between the first and second volumes of the series because she spends half her time outside the city. When in the city, she physically appears to be the equivalent of a twenty-five-year-old human woman, but outside the city, appears to be a woman in her late 40s.

====Doctor Juris====
The Magistrate and &quot;manager&quot; of Bete Noire, Juris answers to a mysterious group called the Hierarchy. He is Lee&#x27;s prime antagonist throughout the first series and, strangely enough, her lover. He, like all other Magistrates, is a descendant of Cain. In the second series, twenty years after the events of the first, he is married to an Asian woman named Xia. He tries to pass on guardianship of Bete Noire to his son Jubal at the stroke of midnight on Jubal&#x27;s eighteenth birthday, but when the ritual fails, he realizes that Jubal is not his firstborn son, which leads him to discover that he has a twenty-year-old son, Jude, by Lee. Jude soon tracks him down in Bete Noire, however, and he is able to pass his legacy to his son. When Juris tries to leave Bete Noire after this, he rapidly ages and dies.

====Jude====
Jude is Lee and Juris&#x27; son, and older half-brother to Jubal. He first appears as an infant (with tiny emerging wings on his back) at the end of the first series, when Lee leaves him at an orphanage shortly after his birth. As an infant, his wings are torn off by Malachi, disguised as a dog. Twenty years later, Jude is a young priest. After a visit from Slate, he seeks out Bete Noire and Juris. He agrees to become the new Magistrate, believing that he can act as a force for good. As Magistrate, he struggles to do what he believes is right despite the interference of the Hierarchy and the corrupting influence of his power. After losing the role of Magistrate, he turns his back on his mother and attempts to gain his power back from her.

====Malachi====
An angel himself, Malachi is Liandra&#x27;s mentor and lover until her exile to Earth. Many years later, Malachi appears to Lee and claims that &quot;The Boss&quot; is offering her a chance to regain her wings and return to angelhood. However, he later reveals to her that he has been granted a &quot;transfer&quot; by God, and is now working for the Hierarchy. He also represents the Hierarchy to Jude, informing him when the Hierarchy disapproves of his actions as Magistrate. Malachi secretly approaches Jubal, and offers to help him become the next Magistrate of Bete Noire. Malachi is also Black Mariah&#x27;s lover.

Unlike Lee, Malachi has retained the full scope of his angelic powers, which include the ability to survive indefinitely without breathing.

====Jubal====
Jubal is Juris&#x27; eighteen-year-old son by Xia, half-brother to Jude. He has spent his life trying to please his father, and bears hatred towards Jude when Juris realizes that it is Jude to whom he must pass on management of Bete Noire. He appears to have an intimate relationship with his mother, Xia.

====Xia====
Xia is Juris&#x27;s wife by the time of the second series, and mother to Jubal. An Asian woman, Xia is not her real name, but one that Juris picked for her, which means &quot;glow of the sunrise&quot;. After Jude becomes Magistrate, Xia attempts to become close to him, and even tries to seduce him. When these efforts fail, she concentrates on manipulating Jude, with the eventual goal of leading him to his own destruction, which Xia believes will lead to Jubal becoming the next Magistrate.

====Black Mariah====
Black Mariah is a witch with the power to suck life out of anyone she touches. Her role in the city is to gather information worldwide for the Magistrate. Mariah lives in fear of her brother Wilde, who has stolen her death from the ether and can use it to kill her at any time; until then, Mariah is immortal. Shortly after Lee&#x27;s arrival in Bete Noire, she destroys Mariah&#x27;s white slavery ring and drives her out of town. Upon her return, she offers to give Lee a piece of The Shard—a fragment of Christ&#x27;s crucifix. Lee drugs and tortures Mariah for information, but later helps her recover her death from Wilde. Mariah learns that Doctor Juris was responsible for the death of Shadow Boxer, Mariah&#x27;s lover, and allies herself with Lee. Twenty years later, she also enters a relationship with Malachi.

====Shadow Boxer====
As a child in England, Shadow Boxer is granted the ability to merge with shadows by a member of the Hierarchy. This power allows him to essentially teleport between any two dark areas. He uses this power to rescue his abusive father, who was trapped in a mine, but his father later accuses him of being in league with the Devil. In his rage, Boxer&#x27;s father attacked his wife, causing her to miscarry her unborn child. Boxer killed his father as retribution. As an adult in Bete Noire, Shadow Boxer acts as Doctor Juris&#x27;s main enforcer. He is also Black Mariah&#x27;s lover, as her touch does not harm him. In a battle with Lee, Boxer is led to believe he has caused her to miscarry. Stricken with guilt, he confesses to Dr. Juris, who kills him.

====Asia Minor====
Living in a mausoleum in a graveyard, Asia Minor is an Asian drug lord who for various reasons often finds himself aiding Lee. He speaks in the broken English stereotypical of Asian immigrants, though it has been established that this is a facade, in that he is capable of speaking perfect English. He was once visited by the ghost of a girl named Tiffany, a girl who had been murdered by a junkie addicted to drugs supplied by Asia, and since then has been cursed with the ability to help only others, but never himself. Asia supplies the Magistrate with drugs that suppress the constant voices and visions that accompany the position.

====Slate====
Slate acts as Bete Noire&#x27;s Chief Examiner, and is considered the city&#x27;s best detective. Slate is also the closest thing to a police officer in the city. Before coming to Bete Noire, Slate was an officer in a northwestern African city called Maristan, which he says was even more corrupt than Bete Noire, until it was destroyed by a demon and vanished from human memory.

====Sachs and Violens====

Peter David brought two previously published characters, Sachs and Violens, into &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; in issue #19 of the DC Comics series. Co-owned by David and artist George Pérez, the characters had previously appeared in their own limited series from Marvel Comics&#x27;s Epic imprint in 1993. Although the characters were owned by the creators, David says their appearance in &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; nearly didn&#x27;t happen due to the legal costs involved. Co-creator George Pérez contributed covers to these issues. Sachs and Violens remained cast members in the series after it transferred to IDW Publishing. Juanita &quot;J.J.&quot; Sachs and Ernie &quot;Violens&quot; Shultz come to Bete Noire to find and destroy a child pornography ring. They decide to remain in the city, and Violens becomes the city&#x27;s Chief Enforcer after the death of Shadow Boxer. Sachs is the sister of Bumper Ruggs, the manager of a local brothel.

====Dolf====
The owner of &quot;Furor&#x27;s&quot;, a Bete Noire bar in which violence is prohibited. Dolf allows Lee to use Furors as a base of operations, and is indeed quite protective of her, christening her &quot;The Fallen Angel&quot;. It is implied that Dolf may be Adolf Hitler; in addition to the name of his bar&#x27;s similarity to Hitler&#x27;s title of Führer, Dolf claims that he has been a painter, a writer, &quot;dabbled&quot; in politics, and made enemies. He also owns a World War II-era Walther P38 pistol. When asked if he is a collector, Dolf again responds, &quot;I dabble&quot;. Dolf has also indicated that he considers dark skin to be an indicator of &quot;an inferior creature, barely above an animal...certainly not human&quot;.

====Guest stars====
Issues 17 through 19 of the second series feature an appearance by Billy Tucci&#x27;s Shi. Issue #17 was published as a flip-book, with one following Lee, and the other half telling the same story from Shi&#x27;s perspective.

Illyria from Joss Whedon&#x27;s &quot;Angel&quot; appeared in a four-issue crossover with &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;. According to Peter David, &quot;the story is set early in Illyria&#x27;s involvement with Angel &amp; Co. Having been deprived of her power by Wesley, she is drawn to Bete Noire as a potential source for not only becoming what she was before, but even achieving her previous status. Remember, what we see of her in &quot;Angel&quot; is not her true appearance&quot;. The collected edition was scheduled for a January 2010 publication.

==Religious themes==
&quot;Fallen Angel&quot; includes many references to Christianity and other religions, some of which provide an unusual perspective on faith and worship.

Liandra herself is a former guardian angel who had been employed by God (indeed, she was God&#x27;s favorite). She states that the role of Guardians is to protect humans they are assigned to by giving them orders; however, the humans merely hear this as a suggestion in their head, and have the free will to heed it or not. Guardians are typically invisible to humans, though there have been exceptions. Lee&#x27;s son Jude is a Catholic priest.

The city of Bete Noire itself is actually the Biblical city of Enoch, built by Cain and named after his son.

When asked by Jude why evil exists in the world, Liandra explains that God wants to die. She states that humanity was intended to be God&#x27;s crowning achievement, and was prepared to move on after its creation, but the constant prayers of people on Earth prevent him from being able to do this. For centuries, God has been sending disasters to Earth in the hope that people will stop believing in Him and let Him pass. Peter David acknowledged that this is a somewhat unusual and controversial take on God:
Lee states that Hell does not exist, and that a loving God would not subject people to endless torment without the opportunity to learn from the punishment. She also implies that the actual destination of those who believe they will go to Hell is somehow even worse.

Benny, a local pickpocket who also sometimes eats his victims, is the serpent from the Garden of Eden.

Jesus Christ seems to appear to Shi, and guides her towards the town of Yellow Springs, which is revealed to be Yomi, the Japanese realm of the dead.

==Censorship==
In late September 2008, IDW Publishing received a letter from the Department of Corrections in an unnamed U.S. state, informing them that copies of issues #1 and 2 of &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; that were mailed to a subscriber incarcerated in their prison were confiscated. The letter explained that the issues contained &quot;material that violates Operating Procedure 803.2, &quot;Incoming Publications&quot;, and could be detrimental to the security and good order of the institution and the rehabilitation of inmates.&quot; Peter David, in a blog entry on his website titled, &quot;Buy Fallen Angel so that criminals don&#x27;t get their hands on it!&quot;, responded to this explanation by saying, &quot;We are SO using this as a pull quote on the next trade paperback.&quot;

==Supergirl connection==
Before the move to IDW, Peter David acknowledged that &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; was based on ideas he had been unable to use during his time writing &quot;Supergirl&quot; before it was cancelled, but stopped short of admitting that Lee was, in fact, Linda Lee Danvers (Supergirl). The DC run of the title is consistent with this hypothesis, which would also jibe with the expressed intent to form a &quot;bridge&quot; between DC&#x27;s general-audience and mature-readers-imprint.

Though David remained coy as to whether the two characters were one and the same during the DC run of the title, after it moved to IDW, David revealed Lee&#x27;s origin, which clearly showed that Lee was not Danvers. However, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; #14 introduced &quot;Lin&quot;, who was said to be Lee&#x27;s &quot;predecessor&quot; in Bete Noire. Lin had recently escaped Limbo, an apparent metaphor for what happened to Danvers after the cancellation of &quot;Supergirl&quot;. David was more explicit as to whether Lin was Linda Danvers in his December 13, 2006 blog entry, in which he stated:
Since David could not explicitly claim that a character owned by DC and a character that he owned were one and the same, he admitted:
Furthermore, in the &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; Premier Edition hardcover, a bonus story was revealed detailing Malachi&#x27;s transfer out of God&#x27;s service. This story portrayed God as being a young boy wearing a baseball cap and holding a metal golf club, similar to Wally the God-Boy from Peter David&#x27;s run on &quot;Supergirl&quot;.

<text>Gezahegne Abera (Amharic: ገዛኸኝ አበራ; born April 23, 1978) is an Ethiopian athlete and winner of the marathon race at the 2000 Summer Olympics.

Born in Etya, Arsi Province, Gezahegne&#x27;s first international competition was the 1999 Los Angeles Marathon, where he finished fourth, behind three Kenyans. That earned him a place in the Ethiopian 1999 World Championships team, where he finished eleventh.

Later in the 1999 season, Gezahegne won his first international marathon, finishing first at Fukuoka marathon in Japan. He won that marathon again in 2001 and 2002. In 2000, Gezahegne finished second in the Boston Marathon.

At the Sydney Olympics, the marathon race came down to two Ethiopians, Gezahegne and Tesfaye Tola, and Kenyan Erick Wainaina. At the 37 km mark, Wainaina tried to make a break, but 2 km later Gezahegne surged to the lead and held the position to the finishing line. At 22 years old, Gezahegne was the youngest marathon champion since Juan Carlos Zabala in Los Angeles 1932.

In 2001, Gezahegne won the World Championships by a mere second ahead of Simon Biwott from Kenya to become the first person to achieve an Olympics-World Championships marathon double.

In 2003, Gezahegne won the London Marathon in 2:07:56. At the 2003 World Championships, Gezahegne had to abandon the race due to injury, but he was selected in the Ethiopian 2004 Olympic team. Again. injury kept him from the race. His wife Elfenesh Alemu was also selected to the 2004 Olympic team, finishing fourth in the women&#x27;s marathon.

Gezahegne&#x27;s repeated injuries ended his running career at a relatively young age. He and his wife own a hotel and property development business.
Gazagn is now a member committee of Ethiopian athletics federation.

<text>Ukmergė (; previously &quot;Vilkmergė&quot;; ) is a city in Vilnius County, Lithuania, located northwest of Vilnius. It is the administrative center of the Ukmergė District Municipality.

Ukmergė (Vilkmergė) was mentioned for the first time as a settlement in 1333. The Ukmergė Old Town contains structure of old streets and squares, also well-preserved buildings of the 19th-20th centuries, therefore it was included in the Registry of Cultural Property of Lithuania.

==Etymology and variant names==
The city took its original name &quot;Vilkmergė&quot; from the River, which was initially called Vilkmergė and assumed a diminutive form after the growth of the settlement. It is commonly thought that the name may be translated as &quot;she-wolf&quot;, from the combination of &quot;Vilkas&quot; (wolf) and &quot;Merga&quot; (maiden). More likely the second root of the dual-stemmed name is the verb &quot;merg-/merk-&quot; meaning &quot;to submerge&quot; or &quot;to dip&quot;. According to local legend, Vilkmergė was a girl raised by wolves, who bridged the divide between animals and humans, in the same way as Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s Mowgli. The folk etymology of &quot;Ukmergė&quot;, by contrast, is &quot;farm girl&quot; (Lith. &quot;ūkis&quot; = farm). The original name has been adopted by the local soccer team, &quot;Vilkmergė Ukmergė&quot; as well as popular HBH Vilkmergė beer.

Other historic names for the city include Wilkemerge or Wilkamergen in 1225, Vilkenberge (1333), Wilkinberg (1384, 1455), Vilkomir (1455), Wilkomir (1611), Wilkomirz (1613), Wilkomiria (1766), Ukmerge (1900), Aukmergė (1908); Ūkmergė (1911), Wilkomierz (1918), and Vilkmergė (1919).

==History==
===Early history===
Ukmergė was first mentioned in 1225, and named as a settlement in Hermann von Wartberge&#x27;s chronicle in 1333. It was essentially a wooden fortress that stood on a hill, near the confluence of the Vilkmergė River and the Šventoji River. Ukmergė was attacked by the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order in 1333, 1365, 1378, 1386, and even in 1391, already after the Christianization of Lithuania in 1387. During the last attack, Ukmergė was burned to the ground and had to be completely rebuilt.

The region began to adopt Christianity, along with the rest of Lithuania, in 1386. In the following year, 1387, its first Catholic church, St. Peter and St. Paul, was built. It was one of the first Roman Catholic churches established in Lithuania. The town was granted municipal rights at some time after the Battle of Wiłkomierz in 1435, and written sources dating from 1486 referred to it as a city. King Sigismund the Old confirmed these rights. During the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the city had been the center of powiat in the Vilnius Voivodeship.

In 1655, the Swedish and Russian armies plundered the city. Because of these incessant wars, the growth of Ukmergė suffered many setbacks. Jews began to settle in the city in the late 17th century, and built a synagogue and a cemetery. In the years 1711–1712, the bubonic plague swept through the town and wreaked havoc upon its population. At various times, the 1st Lithuanian National Cavalry Brigade, the 2nd and 3rd Lithuanian Vanguard Regiments and the 1st Lithuanian Infantry Regiment were stationed in the town. In 1792, by the initiative of the city&#x27;s representative in the Great Sejm, Józef Dominik Kossakowski, King Stanisław August Poniatowski renewed the town&#x27;s municipal rights and gave it its current coat of arms.

===18th and 19th centuries===

During the Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in 1795, the town was annexed by Russia, becoming a part of the Vilna Governorate. In 1812 the Battle of Deltuva, between the Russian and French armies, occurred not far from Ukmergė; Napoleon&#x27;s army raided the town during the French invasion of Russia. During the November Uprising in 1831, the city remained in the hands of rebel elements for several months. In 1843, the town became a part of the newly established Kovno Governorate. In 1863, the city participated in the January Uprising against Russia. In 1876 a match factory was established in Ukmergė. In 1877 a fire again ravaged the town. The future president of Lithuania, Antanas Smetona, was born in Užulėnis near Ukmergė, and was educated in the local school. In 1882 a printing-house was opened.

In 1899–1902, thirteen people (including two Lithuanian vicars: Kazimieras Šleivys and Vladislovas Opulskis) were punished for distributing books written in the Lithuanian language in Ukmergė and surroundings villages, which at the time were prohibited by the Russian tsarist authority&#x27;s imposed Lithuanian press ban. The so-called &#x27;Ukmergė case&#x27; has contributed quite a bit to the lifting of the Lithuanian press ban in 1904 and was one of the last cases of its kind.

===20th century===
In 1918, after Lithuania declared its independence, the city&#x27;s name was changed from Vilkmergė to Ukmergė. In 1919 Bolshevik forces occupied the city during the Lithuanian–Soviet War, but it was soon liberated by the Lithuanian army led by Jonas Variakojis. Over five hundred Bolshevik prisoners were taken during the Battle of Ukmergė. An iron foundry was established in the same year. In 1920, the Lithuanian army stopped Polish incursions into the rest of the country, after a series of battles that were waged to establish borders between the two newly re-established countries. An electric plant, a printing house and 120 other small businesses were opened. The city had five newspapers until 1939. In 1930, a monument named &quot;Lituania Restituta&quot; was erected to commemorate the first decade of restored Lithuanian independence. A Polish high school also operated in Ukmergė during the interbellum.

In 1940, after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, deportations of people from the town began. When the Germans attacked the Soviet Union and its occupied territories, on June 22, 1941, the retreating Soviets gave instructions to their operatives to kill some 120 prisoners; however, most of them escaped; only eight of them were tortured to death. After the German invasion, the Nazis rounded up and killed about 10,000 members of the town&#x27;s Jewish population with the help of Lithuanian collaborators. During World War II, the city center suffered from extensive bomb damage.

For years after the return of the Soviets, the city&#x27;s people organized and participated in resistance movements. The deportation of the city&#x27;s population to Siberia continued. In 1950 the monument to Lithuania&#x27;s Independence was destroyed. The city reconstructed it in 1990, even before the restoration of Lithuania&#x27;s independence was declared. Around 1964, two coupled Soviet R-12 Dvina (SS-4) nuclear missile bases were built in the woods near Ukmergė under Nikita Khrushchev. Each had four surface launch pads, semi-underground hangars to store the missiles and several accessory buildings. The bases were mentioned in the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. They both are in a ruined state at present, and freely accessible to the public.

<text>The Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) is a third-generation axial instrument aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The initial design and scientific capabilities of ACS were defined by a team based at Johns Hopkins University. ACS was assembled and tested extensively at Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp. and the Goddard Space Flight Center and underwent a final flight-ready verification at the Kennedy Space Center before integration in the cargo bay of the Columbia orbiter. It was launched on March 1, 2002, as part of Servicing Mission 3B (STS-109) and installed in HST on March 7, replacing the Faint Object Camera (FOC), the last original instrument. ACS cost US$86 million at that time.

ACS is a highly versatile instrument that became the primary imaging instrument aboard HST. It offered several important advantages over other HST instruments: three independent, high-resolution channels covering the ultraviolet to the near-infrared regions of the spectrum, a large detector area and quantum efficiency, resulting in an increase in HST&#x27;s discovery efficiency by a factor of ten, a rich complement of filters, and coronagraphic, polarimetric, and grism capabilities. The observations undertaken with ACS provided astronomers with a view of the Universe with uniquely high sensitivity, as exemplified by the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, and encompass a wide range of astronomical phenomena, from comets and planets in the Solar System to the most distant quasars known.

==Channels and detectors==

ACS includes three independent channels (one now disabled), each optimized for specific scientific tasks:

===Wide Field Channel (WFC)===
The WFC is the most utilized channel of ACS. Its detector consists of two butted 2048x4096, 15 μm/pixel charge-coupled devices (CCDs) for a total of 16 megapixels manufactured by Scientific Imaging Technologies (SITe). The WFC plate scale is 0.05 per pixel and it has an effective field-of-view of 202×202. The spectral range of the WFC detector is 350–1100 nm.

An example of a use of this channel was SWEEPS, which found 16 candidate exoplanets in the Galactic core.

===High-Resolution Channel (HRC)===

The HRC, which has been permanently disabled since 2007 due to an electrical fault, provided ultra-sharp views over a smaller field-of-view.

The HRC detector was a 1024×1024 SITe CCD which had a smaller field-of-view (26&quot;×29&quot;) than the WFC but twice the spatial sampling (0.025&quot; per pixel). This detector was also significantly more sensitive than the WFC at near-ultraviolet wavelengths (&lt;350 nm).

The channel used two light suppression options for imaging faint objects around bright stars, improving the contrast of targets close to bright sources by tenfold. The first was a commandable coronagraphic mask that included two occulting spots, one of diameter 1.8&quot; at the center of the field and the other of diameter 3.0&quot; nearer to a corner. The first spot was the most popular of the two, for example, for imaging circumstellar disks around nearby bright stars or the host galaxies of luminous quasars. The second was the so-called Fastie Finger, 0.8&quot; in width and 5&quot; in length, located at the entrance of the HRC dewar window.

===Solar Blind Channel (SBC)===
The Multi Anode Microchannel Array (MAMA) of the SBC is a low-background photon-counting device optimized for the ultraviolet in the wavelength range of 115–170 nm. It consists of a photocathode, a microchannel plate, and an anode array. Its spatial sampling is 0.034&quot;x0.030&quot; per pixel and its field-of-view is 34.6&quot;×30.0&quot;. The ACS SBC is in fact a flight spare from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).

==ACS problems and fixes 2006–2009==

On 25 June 2006 ACS suffered an electronic failure. It was powered up successfully on its redundant (side-2) electronics. The instrument subsystems, including the CCD detectors, proved to be working after engineering tests, and ACS resumed science operations on July 4, 2006. On 23 September 2006, the ACS again failed, though by 9 October the problem had been diagnosed and resolved.

On January 27, 2007, the ACS failed due to a short circuit in its backup power supply. The instrument&#x27;s Solar Blind Channel (SBC) was returned to operation on 19 February 2007 using the side-1 electronics.

The Wide Field Channel (WFC) was returned to service by STS-125 in May 2009. The High Resolution Channel (HRC), however, remains offline.

== Gallery ==

==Filters and dispersers==
ACS possesses a set of 38 filters and dispersers distributed among three wheels. Two of these wheels are shared by the HRC and WFC light paths while the third is dedicated to the SBC. The HRC and WFC elements consist of eleven broad-band filters, one medium-band filter, five narrow-band filters, three visible and three ultraviolet polarizers, one prism for the HRC, and one grism (580–1100 nm). Four of the filters have bandpasses in the near-ultraviolet and so can be used with the HRC only. The primary broad-band filters are equivalent to the &quot;u&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; filters of the ground-based Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Five linear ramp filters divided into three individual segments each provide continuous imaging capability from 380 nm to 1070 nm and so ensure adequate sampling of emission lines over a large range in redshift. Only the middle segment is accessible to the HRC. The SBC wheel is populated with one medium-band filter (Lyα), five long-pass filters, and two objective prisms.

<text>List of rulers of [[Wanga]] Kingdom in Kenya.

Though the Wanga kingdom king&#x27;s list actually starts from the re-known founder Wanga, some researchers date them back to the old Egyptian kings time where they were under the leadership of Makata. They assert that through their migration, they passed through many places such as Cameroon, Ethiopia where they were under the leadership of Simbi and Nangwera. While in Uganda they were ruled by several Buganda kings such as Muteesa, Kamaanyi, Mwanga (also Muwanga), Mbwoli (also Mbwoti), Muwanga II. Later, Wamoyi settled in Ibanda in Samia (Uganda), and Muwanga III, his son, migrated to Lela in Nyanza Kenya around the 10th century. The children of Muwanga III were Khabiakala, Wamoyi, Wanga, Wekhoba, Mukoya, Mutende and Sakwa. They all dispersed to different regions to search for a better place to live.

Muwanga III&#x27;s son called Sakwa migrated to Bondo along the Lake Victoria basin. The other son Mutende, migrated southwards and settled in Kuria. The other four sons: Wamoyi, Wanga, Wekhoba and Mukoya moved to Tiriki after being invited by a cousin of them called Mukolwe who had settled earlier in Maragoli. 

It is related that later, Wanga secretly moved towards the West alone and arrived in a place called Imanga in South Wanga in Mumias West sub-county. Nakhisa in his research mentions a list of kings who ruled the Wanga as follows:

<text>The Faint Object Camera (FOC) was a camera installed on the Hubble Space Telescope from launch in 1990 until 2002. It was replaced by the Advanced Camera for Surveys. In December 1993, Hubble&#x27;s vision was corrected on STS-61 by installing COSTAR, which corrected the problem with Hubble&#x27;s mirror before it reached an instrument like FOC. Later instruments had this correction built in, which is why it was possible to later remove COSTAR itself and replace it with a new science instrument.

The camera was built by Dornier GmbH and was funded by the European Space Agency. The unit actually consists of two complete and independent camera systems designed to provide extremely high resolution, exceeding 0.05 arcseconds. It is designed to view very faint UV and optical light from 115 to 650 nanometers in wavelength. FOC has been compared to a &quot;telephoto&quot; lens, providing a high resolution in a small field of view. FOC could distinguish between two points 0.05 arc-seconds apart.

Rather than CCDs the FOC used photon-counting digicons as its detector.

The camera was designed to operate at low, medium, or high resolution. The angular resolution and field of view at each resolution were as follows:

<doc id="884104" wikidata="Q156473" url="?curid=884104" title="Ferenc Szálasi">
<text>Ferenc Szálasi (; 6 January 1897 – 12 March 1946) was a Hungarian military officer, politician, Nazi sympathizer and leader of the far-right Arrow Cross Party who headed the government of Hungary during the country&#x27;s occupation by Nazi Germany during World War II.

Szálasi served with distinction during World War I as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1925, he became a staff officer of the restored Kingdom of Hungary under Regent Miklós Horthy. Initially apolitical, Szálasi embraced right-wing ultranationalism in the early 1930s and became a passionate advocate of the irredentist Hungarism. In 1937, he founded the Hungarian National Socialist Party, having retired from the military and fully devoted himself to politics. He attracted considerable support through his virulently nationalist and antisemitic program, while his followers became increasingly radical, leading to his imprisonment in 1938. While in prison, he was proclaimed leader of the far-right Nazi Arrow Cross Party, which quickly became one of the most powerful political forces in the country. Szálasi was granted amnesty in 1940, but had to operate his party clandestinely after Horthy outlawed it on the outbreak of World War II.

Following the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944 and Horthy&#x27;s ousting in October, Szálasi was made head of government and head of state. His pro-Nazi puppet government, known as the Government of National Unity, was dominated by members of the Arrow Cross Party. The regime imposed martial law, participated in Germany&#x27;s war efforts and recommenced the Holocaust in Hungary, which had been halted by Horthy. His militias were singularly responsible for the deportation of 650,000 Hungarian Jews to death camps and for the murder of 10,000–15,000 Hungarian Jews.

Szálasi&#x27;s collaborationist government, with its authority limited to the city of Budapest and its environs, only lasted 163 days. Facing the advance of Soviet and Romanian forces, Szálasi and his cabinet fled the country shortly before the Siege of Budapest began. He was captured by American troops in Austria in May 1945 and returned to Hungary to face trial. The Government of National Unity, which had relocated to Munich, was formally dissolved the next day. The People&#x27;s Tribunal in Budapest found him guilty of war crimes and high treason, and sentenced him to death. He was executed by hanging on 12 March 1946.

== Early life ==

=== Ancestry ===
Born the son of a soldier in Kassa, Abaúj-Torna County, Kingdom of Hungary (now Košice, Slovakia) of mixed Armenian (the surname of his great-grandfather was Salossian), German, Hungarian (one grandparent), Slovak and Rusyn ancestry. His Armenian ancestors settled down in Ebesfalva, Transylvania during the reign of Prince Michael I Apafi. Szálasi&#x27;s grandfather, who participated as a &quot;&quot; in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, married a German woman from Vienna, and their son, Ferenc Szálasi, Sr. (born 1866) attended a military cadet school in Kassa and later became an official in the Honvédség. Szálasi&#x27;s brothers, Béla, Károly and Rezső also served in the army.

Szálasi&#x27;s mother was the Greek Catholic Erzsébet Szakmár (born 1875), who had Slovak and Rusyn roots. She provided religious education to her sons. Szálasi once said &quot;I received the power of belief and faith in God through breast milk. My mother made to drink faith through and through me&quot;&quot;. Ferenc Szálasi lived with his mother until 1944.

===Military career===

Szálasi followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and joined the army at a young age. He finished elementary studies in his birthplace, then attended the military academy in Kőszeg, Marosvásárhely (now Târgu Mureș in Romania) and continued studies in Kismarton. Finally, he finished his military education in the Theresian Military Academy of Wiener Neustadt, where he was promoted to Lieutenant in 1915.

He eventually became an officer and served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. He served on the frontline for 36 months. At the end of the war, he was promoted to First Lieutenant and was involved in the 2nd regiment of k.u.k. Tyrolean Rifle Regiments, widely known as &quot;Kaiserjäger&quot;. He was stationed near Merano and Lake Garda in the Italian Front. Later the regiments were ordered to the north to Verdun at the last days of the war. For his service, he was honored with Third Class of the Order of the Iron Crown. Returning to Hungary, Szálasi performed courier service for the newly formed Ministry of Foreign Affairs after the Aster Revolution in November 1918.

Upon the dissolution and break-up of Austria-Hungary after the war, the Hungarian Democratic Republic and then the Hungarian Soviet Republic were briefly proclaimed in 1918 and 1919 respectively. The short-lived communist government of Béla Kun launched what was known as the &quot;Red Terror&quot; and ultimately involved Hungary in an ill-fated war with Romania. In 1920, the country went into a period of civil conflict with Hungarian anti-communists and monarchists violently purging the nation of communists, leftist intellectuals, and others they felt threatened by, especially Jews. This period was known as the &quot;White Terror&quot; and, in 1920, after the pullout of the last of the Romanian occupation forces, it led to the restoration of the Kingdom of Hungary (&quot;Magyar Királyság&quot;) under Regent Miklós Horthy. During that time, Szálasi was still an apolitical person, and he did not involve himself in events beyond the general interest.

In 1920–21, Szálasi finished non-commissioned officer training school in Hajmáskér; following that, he served in the 13th Infantry Regiment in Miskolc. In 1923, he enrolled to the General Staff officers&#x27; training course at the Ludovica Military Academy. For his outstanding achievements, he was promoted with priority to Captain in 1924. In 1925, Szálasi entered the General Staff of the restored Kingdom. He fulfilled his mandatory field-grade task in 1929 at the 11th Infantry Regiment in Debrecen as a company commander. According to some memoirs by former subordinates, Szálasi was a popular and beloved superior among the infantry. His fellow officers acknowledged his military skills and literacy, but some others thought Szálasi was pedantic and autonomous. According to his future Minister of Defence, Károly Beregfy, &quot;Szálasi&#x27;s name among the General Staff was a concept of excellent hunting and tactics, but also a concept with the regards of honesty, truthfulness and Puritanism.&quot; By 1933, Szálasi had attained the rank of Major and became Chief of the 1st Honvéd Mixed-Brigade&#x27;s General Staff in Budapest.

==Political career==

=== First steps in politics ===
Around this time, when Gyula Gömbös came to power, Szálasi became fascinated with politics and often lectured on Hungary&#x27;s political affairs. By this time, the hitherto apolitical Szálasi was a fanatical right-wing nationalist and a strong proponent of &quot;Hungarism&quot; and advocating the expansion of Hungary&#x27;s territory back to the borders of Greater Hungary as it was prior to the Treaty of Trianon, which in 1920 had reduced the country&#x27;s territory by 72%. In 1933, to summarize his views, he published his 46-page pamphlet with the title &quot;A magyar állam felépítésének terve&quot; (&quot;Plan for the Building of the Hungarian State&quot;) and sent his work to several politicians. Soldiers and military officers were banned from politicizing, thus Szálasi was sentenced to twenty-day detention and expelled from the General Staff by a military court. After his release, Szálasi was ordered to the 14th Infantry Regiment in Eger, where served as staff officer then first adjutant. Szálasi gradually became disillusioned with the army and requested resignation from that in October 1934.

On 1 March 1935, Szálasi left the army in order to devote his full attention to politics, after which time he established the Party of National Will, a nationalistic group.
It was eventually outlawed by the conservative government for being too radical. Unperturbed, Szálasi established the Hungarian National Socialist Party in 1937, which was also banned. However, Szálasi was able to attract considerable support to his cause from factory workers and Hungary&#x27;s lower classes by pandering to their aggrieved sense of nationalism and their virulent antisemitism.

After Germany&#x27;s &quot;Union&quot; (&quot;Anschluss&quot;) with Austria in 1938, Szálasi&#x27;s followers became more radical in their political activities, and Szálasi was arrested and imprisoned by the Hungarian Police. However, even while in prison Szálasi managed to remain a powerful political figure, and was proclaimed leader of the National Socialist Arrow Cross Party (a coalition of several right-wing groups) when it was expanded in 1938. The party attracted a large number of followers, and in the 1939 elections, it gained 30 seats in the Hungarian Parliament, thus becoming one of the more powerful parties in Hungary. Freed due to a general amnesty resulting from the Second Vienna Award in 1940, Szálasi returned to politics. When World War II began, the Arrow Cross Party was officially banned by Prime Minister Pál Teleki, thus forcing Szálasi to operate in secret. During this period, Szálasi gained the support and backing of the Germans, who had previously been opposed to Szálasi because his Hungarist nationalism placed Hungarian territorial claims above those of Germany.

=== Way to power ===
Following the Nazi occupation of Hungary in March 1944, the pro-German Döme Sztójay was installed as Prime Minister of Hungary. The Arrow Cross Party was then legalized by the government, allowing Szálasi to expand the party. When Sztójay was deposed in August, Szálasi once again became an enemy of the Hungarian government and Regent Miklós Horthy ordered his arrest. By this time, Horthy realized that Hungary&#x27;s position was untenable, and began putting out feelers to the Allies. The Germans were concerned that Horthy would succeed in extricating Hungary from the war. They had, however, waiting in the wings, a perfect ally in Szálasi.

When the Germans learned of the Regent&#x27;s plan to come to a separate peace with the Soviets and exit the Axis alliance, they kidnapped Horthy&#x27;s son, Miklós, Jr. and threatened to kill him unless Horthy abdicated in favor of Szálasi. Under duress, Horthy signed a document announcing his own abdication and naming Szálasi prime minister–effectively giving &quot;legal sanction&quot; to an Arrow Cross coup. In his memoirs, Horthy contended the appointment of Szálasi was invalid, saying, &quot;A signature wrung from a man at machine-gun point can have little legality.&quot; The Germans then pressured Parliament to install Szálasi as Head of State as well.

=== National leader ===

Szálasi&#x27;s Government of National Unity turned the Kingdom of Hungary into a puppet state of Nazi Germany formed on 16 October 1944 after Regent of Hungary Miklós Horthy was removed from power during Operation Panzerfaust (&quot;Unternehmen Eisenfaust&quot;).

The Hungarian parliament approved the formation of a Council of Regency (&quot;Kormányzótanács&quot;) of three. On 4 November, Szálasi was sworn as Leader of the Nation (&quot;nemzetvezető&quot;). He formed a government of sixteen ministers, half of which were members of the Arrow Cross Party. While the Horthy regency had come to an end, the Hungarian monarchy was not abolished by the Szálasi regime, as government newspapers kept referring to the country as the Kingdom of Hungary (&quot;Magyar Királyság&quot;, also abbreviated as &quot;m.kir.&quot;), although &quot;Magyarország&quot; (Hungary) was frequently used as an alternative.

Szálasi and his &quot;Quisling government&quot; had little other intention or ability but to execute the party&#x27;s ideology and to maintain control in Nazi-occupied portions of Hungary as the Soviet Union invaded. He did this in order to reduce the threat to Germany. Szálasi&#x27;s aim was to create a one-party state based on Hungarism.

Under his rule as a close ally of Germany, the Germans, with the assistance of the Szálasi government, recommenced the deportation of the Jews, which had been suspended by Horthy. He organised the so-called International Ghetto. During that time some diplomats like Raoul Wallenberg gave protective passports to some Jews, which protected them from deportation. Germans argued they weren&#x27;t valid according to international law, but Szálasi&#x27;s government accepted them nevertheless. His government promoted martial law and courts-martial, and executed those who were considered dangerous for the state and the continuation of the war. During Szálasi&#x27;s rule, Hungarian tangible assets (cattle, machinery, wagons, industrial raw materials, etc.) were sent to Germany. He conscripted young and old into the remaining Hungarian Army and sent them into hopeless battles against the Red Army.

Szálasi&#x27;s rule only lasted 163 days, partly because by the time he took power, the Red Army was already deep inside Hungary. For all intents and purposes, his authority was limited to a narrowing band in the centre of the country, including Budapest. On 19 November 1944, Szálasi was in the Hungarian capital when Soviet and Romanian forces began encircling it. By the time the city was encircled and the 102-day Siege of Budapest began, he was gone. The &quot;Leader of the Nation&quot; (&quot;Nemzetvezető&quot;) fled to Szombathely on 9 December. By March 1945, Szálasi was in Vienna just prior to the Vienna Offensive. Later, he fled to Munich.

== Trial and execution ==
The Arrow Cross Party&#x27;s cabinet, which had fled Hungary, was dissolved on 7 May 1945, a day before Germany&#x27;s surrender. Szálasi was captured by American troops in Mattsee on 6 May and returned to Hungary on 3 October. He was tried by the People&#x27;s Tribunal in Budapest in open sessions begun in February 1946, and sentenced to death for war crimes and high treason.

Szálasi was hanged on 12 March 1946 in Budapest, along with two of his former ministers, Gábor Vajna and Károly Beregfy, and the party ideologist József Gera. The hanging was conducted in the Austrian pole method. A large post had a rope attached to a hook at the top. Szálasi was marched up steps, placed with his back to the post, his legs and arms were tied, the noose placed around his neck, the rope tightened, and the steps were removed. With the post only leaving a couple feet between Szálasi and the ground it is likely that he died slowly due to strangulation rather than being instantaneously rendered unconscious and dying shortly after as would happen when utilizing the standard drop. This would also explain why his arms and legs were bound as to prevent struggle during the process. Before being executed, Szálasi received the last sacraments by a Catholic priest.

Thirty-two photos of the hanging were donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Other photographs of the execution are on display in the Holocaust Room of the Budapest Jewish Museum.

On 13 March 1946, the day after Szálasi&#x27;s death, the National Council of People&#x27;s Tribunals discussed the convicted politicians&#x27; plea for mercy and recommended its refusal to Justice Minister István Ries, when Szálasi and his ministers were already executed. Ries forwarded the decision to President Zoltán Tildy, who subsequently approved the death sentence and execution on 15 March 1946.

Szálasi was buried in Rákoskeresztúr New Public Cemetery in the Budapest Capital District, Budapest, Hungary, plot 298. In 2008, historian Tamás Kovács claimed the &quot;Political Department of the Hungarian State Police&quot; (PRO; predecessor of the feared secret police State Protection Authority) falsified his name and birth certificate, and buried him as &quot;Ferenc Lukács&quot; in section 298 of the New Public Cemetery. Other historians, however, rejected this claim, since no written source could be found.

<doc id="884109" wikidata="Q1194186" url="?curid=884109" title="Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2">
<text>The Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) is a camera formerly installed on the Hubble Space Telescope. The camera was built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and is roughly the size of a baby grand piano. It was installed by servicing mission 1 (STS-61) in 1993, replacing the telescope&#x27;s original Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WF/PC). WFPC2 was used to image the Hubble Deep Field in 1995, the Engraved Hourglass Nebula and Egg Nebula in 1996, and the Hubble Deep Field South in 1998. During STS-125, WFPC2 was removed and replaced with the Wide Field Camera 3 as part of the mission&#x27;s first spacewalk on May 14, 2009. After returning to Earth, the camera was displayed briefly at the National Air and Space Museum and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory before returning to its final home at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum.

==Design==
WFPC2 was built by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which also built the predecessor WFPC camera launched with Hubble in 1990. WFPC2 contains internal corrective optics to fix the spherical aberration in the Hubble telescope&#x27;s primary mirror.

The charge-coupled devices (CCDs) in the WFPC2 (designed at JPL and manufactured by Loral) detected electromagnetic radiation in a range from 120 nm to 1000 nm. This included the 380 nm to 780 nm of the visible spectrum, all of the near ultraviolet (and a small part of the extreme ultraviolet band) and most of the near-infrared band. The sensitivity distribution of these CCDs is roughly normal, with a peak around 700 nm and concomitantly very poor sensitivity at the extremes of the CCDs&#x27; operating range. WFPC2 featured four identical CCD detectors, each 800x800 pixels. Three of these, arranged in an L-formation, comprise Hubble&#x27;s Wide Field Camera (WFC). Adjacent to them is the Planetary Camera (PC), a fourth CCD with different (narrower-focused) optics. This afforded a more detailed view over a smaller region of the visual field. WFC and PC images are typically combined, producing the WFPC2&#x27;s characteristic stairstep image. When distributed as non-scientific JPEG files the PC portion of the image is shown with the same resolution as the WFC portions, but astronomers receive a raw scientific image package which presents the PC image in its native, higher detail.

To allow scientists to view specific parts of the electromagnetic spectrum the WFPC2 featured a rotating wheel which moves different optical filters into the lightpath (between the WFPC2&#x27;s aperture and the CCD detectors). The 48 filter elements included:

* A set of standard wideband photometric filters.
* A graduated filter, featuring a wide range of very narrowband filters. By positioning the target object at a precise part of the field, the operator can use an accurately picked narrowband filter.
* A number of narrowband optical filters tuned to the wavelengths of various atomic emission lines.

==Performance==

As predicted, over the course of its mission the WFPC2 experienced degradation of the CCDs, resulting in defective (&quot;hot&quot;) pixels. The telescope&#x27;s operators performed monthly calibration tests to catalog these; with the WFPC&#x27;s aperture closed a number of long exposures are taken, and pixels which differ significantly from near black are flagged. To avoid false positives caused by cosmic rays tripping a given pixel, the output of different calibration shots is compared. Pixels which are consistently &quot;hot&quot; are recorded, and astronomers who analyse raw WFPC2 images receive a list of these pixels. Typically, astronomers adjust their photo-processing software to ignore these bad pixels.

WFPC2 was largely superseded for broad-band imaging by the Advanced Camera for Surveys, installed during servicing mission 3B in 2002. However, the early 2007 failure of ACS resulted in WFPC2 returning to its role as Hubble&#x27;s primary visible light camera. WFPC2 was removed from HST during Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009, for return to Earth and eventual museum display. It was replaced by Wide Field Camera 3, which features two UV/visible detecting CCDs, each 2048x4096 pixels, and a separate IR CCD of 1024 x 1024, capable of receiving infrared radiation up to 1700 nm.

<text>Floyd Elliot Wray (born August 22, 1960), known professionally as Collin Raye and previously as Bubba Wray, is an American country music singer. He initially recorded as a member of the band The Wrays between 1983 and 1987. He made his solo debut in 1991 as Collin Raye with the album &quot;All I Can Be&quot;, which produced his first Number One hit in &quot;Love, Me&quot;. &quot;All I Can Be&quot; was the first of four consecutive albums released by Raye to achieve platinum certification in the United States for sales of one million copies each. Raye maintained several Top Ten hits throughout the rest of the decade and into 2000. 2001&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Back Down&quot; was his first album that did not produce a Top 40 country hit, and he was dropped by his record label soon afterward. He did not record another studio album until 2005&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Years and Change&quot;, released on an independent label.

Between 1991 and 2007, Raye charted 30 singles on the U.S. country charts; he has also charted twice on the Adult Contemporary format as a duet partner on two Jim Brickman songs. Four of Raye&#x27;s singles have reached Number One on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country music charts: 1992&#x27;s &quot;Love, Me&quot; and &quot;In This Life&quot;, 1995&#x27;s &quot;My Kind of Girl&quot;, and 1998&#x27;s &quot;I Can Still Feel You&quot;. He has also recorded a total of 11 studio albums, counting a Christmas album and a compilation of lullabies, in addition to releasing a Greatest Hits compilation, a live album, and a live CD/DVD package.

==Early years==
Floyd Elliot Wray was born in De Queen, Arkansas. His mother, Lois Wray, was a local musician; in the 1950s, she served as an opening act for several Sun Records artists, including Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins. Later, she became a solo musician in her own right; she would occasionally bring both Collin and his brother Scott (known professionally as Scotty Wray, died February 2022) onstage to sing harmony vocals. By the 1980s, the two brothers began a country-rock band called the Wray Brothers Band, in which Collin assumed the stage name Bubba Wray. The Wray Brothers Band performed primarily in the state of Texas; Corvallis, Oregon; and later in Reno, Nevada; eventually releasing singles on independent labels. By 1986, the band (which had shortened its name to The Wrays) signed to Mercury Records, releasing four singles. After the singles performed poorly on the charts, The Wrays disbanded.

==Solo career==
===&quot;All I Can Be&quot;===
After altering the spelling of his last name to Raye, he was signed to a record deal with Epic Records in 1990. His debut single, &quot;All I Can Be (Is a Sweet Memory)&quot;, entered the charts in 1991, reaching a peak of No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks charts. Raye&#x27;s first album, also titled &quot;All I Can Be&quot;, was released soon afterward.

The follow-up single, a ballad co-written by Skip Ewing and titled &quot;Love, Me,&quot; reached number 1 on the country music charts in early 1992, holding the peak position for three weeks. &quot;All I Can Be&quot; was then certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album&#x27;s final single was &quot;Every Second,&quot; which peaked at No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;.

===&quot;In This Life&quot; and &quot;Extremes&quot;===
Raye&#x27;s second album, titled &quot;In This Life&quot;, was released in 1992. The album&#x27;s title track, which served as its lead-off single, spent two weeks at number 1 and crossed over to the Adult Contemporary charts with a peak of number 21. In late 1992, Raye made an appearance on the Carl Weathers television drama series &quot;Street Justice&quot;, where he gave a live performance of &quot;In This Life&quot;. The second-season episode, entitled &quot;Country Justice&quot;, was directed by David Winning. The album produced three additional Top Ten country hits in &quot;I Want You Bad (And That Ain&#x27;t Good)&quot;, &quot;Somebody Else&#x27;s Moon&quot;, and &quot;That Was a River&quot;, in addition to achieving his second platinum certification.

&quot;Extremes&quot;, Raye&#x27;s third album, was released in 1993. It was his first to be produced by Paul Worley and Ed Seay, the latter of whom would serve as Raye&#x27;s co-producer until 2000. The lead single, &quot;That&#x27;s My Story&quot;, was co-written by Lee Roy Parnell, who recorded for Arista Nashville at the time. Following it was &quot;Little Rock&quot;, a song about a recovering alcoholic. The song&#x27;s accompanying music video also promoted Al-Anon, an international support group for friends and family of alcoholics. Also released from the album were the Top 10 hits &quot;Man of My Word&quot;, &quot;My Kind of Girl&quot;, and &quot;If I Were You&quot;. &quot;My Kind of Girl&quot; became Raye&#x27;s third number 1 hit, while the other two singles reached Top 10 as well.

Also in 1993, he was nominated by the Academy of Country Music for Top New Male Vocalist, along with Billy Ray Cyrus and Tracy Lawrence, but lost to Tracy.

===&quot;I Think About You&quot; and &quot;The Best of Collin Raye: Direct Hits&quot;===
&quot;I Think About You&quot; was the title of Raye&#x27;s fourth album. Released in 1995, it produced six singles overall and became Raye&#x27;s fourth consecutive platinum-certified album. Of the singles, the first three all reached Top 5: &quot;One Boy, One Girl&quot;, &quot;Not That Different&quot;, and the title track, whose music video won a Video of the Year award from the Academy of Country Music. While &quot;Not That Different&quot; was climbing the charts, the album track &quot;What If Jesus Comes Back Like That&quot; received unsolicited airplay which brought it as high as number 57. After &quot;I Think About You&quot;, &quot;Love Remains&quot; peaked at number 12, followed by an official release of &quot;What If Jesus Comes Back Like That&quot; which achieved a peak of number 21. The album&#x27;s sixth and final single was &quot;On the Verge&quot;, at number 2.

In 1996, Raye also released a Christmas album titled &quot;&quot;. He also appeared on Stars and Stripes Vol. 1, a Beach Boys album featuring lead vocals by country musicians. A year later, his first Greatest Hits package was issued; titled &quot;The Best of Collin Raye: Direct Hits&quot;, it comprised several of his hit singles from the past five years, as well as four new songs, of which three released as singles. &quot;What the Heart Wants&quot; and &quot;Little Red Rodeo&quot; both reached Top Five on the country music charts, while &quot;The Gift&quot;, a collaboration with Jim Brickman and Susan Ashton, was a top 5 hit on the Adult Contemporary charts. The album also included a cover of Journey&#x27;s &quot;Open Arms&quot;, with Raye&#x27;s version reaching a peak of number 70 from unsolicited airplay. &quot;Direct Hits&quot; received a gold certification from the RIAA for selling 500,000 copies in the United States.

===&quot;The Walls Came Down&quot;===
&quot;The Walls Came Down&quot; was the title of Raye&#x27;s fifth studio album. Released in 1998, it produced his fourth and final &quot;Billboard&quot; number 1 single in &quot;I Can Still Feel You&quot;. &quot;Someone You Used to Know&quot; and the Radney Foster-penned &quot;Anyone Else&quot; were both Top Five hits as well. &quot;Start Over Georgia&quot;, the fourth single (co-written by Raye&#x27;s brother), peaked at No. 39. Also included on &quot;The Walls Came Down&quot; was a ballad entitled &quot;The Eleventh Commandment&quot;, in which Raye addressed the issue of child abuse. Although not released as a single, &quot;The Eleventh Commandment&quot; was made into a music video, which featured a number for a child abuse hotline at the end. The same year, he appeared on compilation CD &quot;Tribute To Tradition&quot; (released on Columbia label) with cover versions of &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; (country classic recorded by Hank Williams in 1957) and &quot;Honky Tonk Heroes (Like Me)&quot; (a major hit for Waylon Jennings in 1973, written by Billy Joe Shaver). Raye duets with Joe Diffie on the latter song. In late 1999, Raye sang backing vocals on Phil Vassar&#x27;s debut single &quot;Carlene&quot;.

===2000–2005===
Raye released two albums in 2000: &quot;Counting Sheep&quot;, an album consisting of lullabies for his children, and &quot;Tracks&quot;. The first single release from &quot;Tracks&quot;, &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Last a Moment&quot;, was a top 5 hit on the country charts. &quot;Tired of Loving This Way&quot;, which followed, was a duet with singer and actress Bobbie Eakes. Although it was Raye&#x27;s first single to miss the Top 40 entirely, it provided Eakes with her only appearance on the country music charts. &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; and &quot;You Still Take Me There&quot; were also released, but they failed to make top 40 as well.

&quot;Can&#x27;t Back Down&quot;, Raye&#x27;s last album for Epic, was released in 2001. Neither of the album&#x27;s two singles entered Top 40 on the country music charts. Because of a conflict with his label, Raye asked out of his contract that year. Although he did not have a record label at the time, he entered the Adult Contemporary charts for the third time in 2003, as a duet partner on Jim Brickman&#x27;s single &quot;Peace (Where the Heart Is)&quot;. Raye released a live album, &quot;Live at Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas&quot;, in 2004, and a promotional single titled &quot;World History 101&quot; in 2005.

===2005–present===
In 2005, Raye signed to the independent Aspirion label, releasing his &quot;Twenty Years and Change&quot; album. Two singles were released from the album, although neither single charted. The same year, Raye appeared in television commercials for Fruit of the Loom underwear, in which he sang the jingle &quot;You Can&#x27;t Over-Love Your Underwear&quot;. Another studio album, &quot;Fearless&quot;, was released in 2006 on Country Roads Records, although it did not produce any singles.

In 2007, a CD/DVD combination titled &quot;The Power in You&quot; was released, followed by an EP titled &quot;Selected Hits&quot;. The latter includes &quot;That&#x27;s My Story&quot;, &quot;Little Rock&quot;, &quot;I Think About You&quot;, and &quot;Love, Me&quot;, as well as two new tracks: &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Prayer&quot; and &quot;Quitters&quot;, the latter of which was co-written by Canadian country singer George Canyon. Both of the new tracks were released as singles in 2007, and the former peaked at No. 59 on Hot Country Songs.

Raye&#x27;s next album, &quot;Never Going Back&quot;, was released on April 28, 2009, on the Saguaro Road label. Its first single is &quot;Mid-Life Chrysler&quot;. It also includes the track &quot;She&#x27;s With Me,&quot; which is a tribute to Raye&#x27;s granddaughter, Haley, who died from a severe but undiagnosed brain disorder.

Raye released his autobiography &quot;A Voice Undefeated&quot; in 2014.

==Musical stylings==
Raye is known primarily for his country pop ballads, such as &quot;Love, Me&quot; (a popular choice at funerals) and &quot;In This Life&quot; (one of the most popular wedding songs of the 1990s).

Raye is also known for dealing with social issues in his material. &quot;Little Rock&quot;, for example, tells of a recovering alcoholic; its music video included the number for Al-Anon, as a means of public service announcement. &quot;What If Jesus Comes Back Like That&quot;, from his &quot;I Think About You&quot; album, is a power ballad that poses questions about the return of Jesus Christ in the modern world. In &quot;The Eleventh Commandment&quot;, a track from &quot;The Walls Came Down&quot;, Raye addresses child abuse, suggesting &quot;honor thy children&quot; as an eleventh commandment to accompany the Ten Commandments. In the song&#x27;s music video, a telephone number for the child abuse hotline ChildHelp USA was included.

==Religious conversion==
Raye was raised as a Southern Baptist but became a Catholic when he was 23 years old. On February 17, 2016, Raye performed at the &quot;Two Nations, One Faith&quot; celebration at Sun Bowl Stadium in El Paso, Texas, prior to the stadium&#x27;s simulcast of the Mass celebrated by Pope Francis just across the Mexican border in Ciudad Juarez.

==Personal life==
Raye married Connie Parker in 1980; they divorced in 1987. They have a daughter, Brittany (born February 10, 1983), and a son, Jacob (born March 31,
1985). Raye lives in Nashville with his daughter and granddaughter.

==Social activism==
In 2011, Raye became the national spokesperson for the Terri Schiavo Life &amp; Hope Network.

<doc id="884122" wikidata="Q4887254" url="?curid=884122" title="Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore">
<text>Benedict Leonard Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore (21 March 1679 – 16 April 1715) was an English colonial administrator and politician who represented Harwich in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1714 to 1715. He was the second son of Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore and Jane Lowe, and became his father&#x27;s heir upon the death of his elder brother Cecil in 1681. 

The 3rd Lord Baltimore was a devout Roman Catholic, and had lost his title to the Province of Maryland shortly after the events of the Glorious Revolution in 1688, when the Protestant monarchs William III and Mary II acceded to the British throne. Benedict Calvert made strenuous attempts to have his family&#x27;s title to Maryland restored by renouncing Roman Catholicism and joining the Church of England.

In February 1715 Benedict became the 4th Baron Baltimore upon the death of his father, and he immediately petitioned King George I for the restoration of Maryland to his control. However, before the King could rule on the petition, Baltimore died aged 36, outliving his father by just two months. Shortly afterwards the King restored the title to Maryland to Calvert&#x27;s young son Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore.

==Early life and exile==

Benedict Calvert served as Governor of Maryland on behalf of his father from 1684 to 1688. Since he was just five years old at the time, this appointment was a purely honorary one, with the real work of governorship being carried out by his deputy, Henry Darnall.

Like his father, Benedict&#x27;s Catholicism caused him political difficulties. While still a boy he served as a cavalry officer in the regiment of James Cecil, 4th Earl of Salisbury; Salisbury was appointed a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the Catholic King James II in 1688 and he duly converted to Roman Catholicism and served the king as Colonel of a regiment of horse.

Unfortunately, Salisbury&#x27;s timing could not have been worse. The King was soon overthrown by the Glorious Revolution of October to December 1688, and both Salisbury and Calvert were outlawed by the new Protestant regime.

Worse was to come. The events following the Glorious Revolution also cost the Roman Catholic Calverts their rule in Maryland, which in 1688 became a Royal Colony, following a Puritan revolt known as the Protestant Revolution.

Benedict Calvert&#x27;s name was entered at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1690, but again his religion proved an impediment to his career. and he went into exile in St Germain, France, where he remained for 10 years.

==Return to England==
In 1698 Calvert was able to secure a license to return to England, and on 2 January 1699 he married the twenty-year-old Lady Charlotte Lee, daughter of the 1st Earl of Lichfield and Lady Charlotte FitzRoy, the illegitimate daughter of King Charles II.

The couple had seven children, all of whom were raised in the Catholic faith, but the union was not a happy one, and the couple separated in 1705. In 1711 Calvert petitioned for a divorce from his wife on the grounds of her &quot;open adultery&quot;, but the petition was unsuccessful and the divorce was not granted.

==Religion and the Restoration of Maryland to Calvert control==

Benedict Calvert correctly calculated that the chief impediment to the restoration of his family&#x27;s title to Maryland was the question of religion. Towards the end of 1713 he began to make overtures to Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, informing Oxford of his:
inclinations...to embrace the Protestant religion, which I have become hitherto deterred from by the apprehensions that my father would withdraw my sustinance.

Accordingly, he converted to Anglicanism in 1713, gambling that this move would win back his family&#x27;s lost fortune in the New World. Such a drastic move came at a cost, however. Benedict&#x27;s devoutly Catholic father Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, furious at his son&#x27;s apostasy, withdrew his son&#x27;s annual allowance of £450 and ended his support for his grandchildren&#x27;s education and maintenance. Fortunately Benedict was able to persuade the Crown to grant him an allowance of £300 a year, and Queen Anne even acceded to his nomination of John Hart as governor of the province, on condition that Hart would share with Calvert £500 per annum out of his profits from the office.

For Calvert, the political benefits associated with his new religion came quickly. He was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Harwich from 1714 to 1715, though he was not listed in any division lists, and was not an active member.

On 1 August 1714 Queen Anne died, leaving the Calverts with a new king and a new court to persuade of the merits of their family&#x27;s claim to Maryland.

==Petition to George I==
On 2 February 1715 Calvert reaffirmed his devotion to the Anglican faith and proclaimed his loyalty to the new Protestant king George I. Two weeks later the old Lord Baltimore died, aged 78, and Benedict succeeded him to become the 4th Baron Baltimore, immediately petitioning King George I for the restoration of Maryland to his control. However, before the King could rule on the petition, Baltimore himself died, outliving his father by just two months. Shortly afterwards, on 15 May 1715, the King restored the title to Maryland to Benedict&#x27;s son, the fifteen-year-old 5th Baron Baltimore.

==Family==
Calvert married on 2 January 1699 Lady Charlotte Lee, daughter of the Edward Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield, and his wife, Lady Charlotte Fitzroy, an illegitimate daughter of Charles II of England by Barbara Villiers, 1st Duchess of Cleveland. He and his wife had seven children, including:
* Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, 18th Proprietor Governor of Maryland (29 September 1699 – 24 April 1751), married on 20 July 1730 Mary Janssen (died Chaillot, Paris, 25 March 1770), daughter of Sir Theodore Janssen, 1st Baronet, and wife Williamza or Williamsa Henley.
* Edward Henry Calvert (Epsom, 31 August 1701 - Annapolis, Calvert House, 1730), held office of Commissary General and President of the Council of Maryland. Married in 1726 Margaret Lee (born 1705), but had no children.
*Benedict Leonard Calvert (1700–1732), Governor of the Maryland colony from 1727 through 1731, appointed by his brother, Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore. His health was poor and he died of tuberculosis on 1 June 1732 on his passage home to England.
* Cecil Calvert (6 November 1702 - 1765)
* Charlotte Calvert (born 6 November 1702, died December 1744), married Thomas Brerewood, by whom she had a son, Francis Brerewood. (Her father-in-law Thomas Brerewood owned My Lady&#x27;s Manor, in Maryland.)
* Jane Calvert (Epsom, 19 July 1703 - July 1778), married 4 May 1720 John Hyde (1695–1746), with whom she had many children.
* Barbara Calvert (1704–1704)
* Anne Calvert

Their descendants included the children of Robert E. Lee through Benedict Swingate Calvert, an illegitimate son of the 5th Baron Calvert. Benedict&#x27;s daughter, Eleanor married John Parke Custis, a stepson of George Washington. Swingate&#x27;s mother may have been Melusina von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham, an illegitimate daughter of George I of Great Britain, by his mistress, Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal.

==Legacy==
Benedict Calvert had arranged for his son Charles to be raised a Protestant, and in 1721 the young Charles came of age and assumed control of the colony of Maryland, which remained under the control of the Calvert family until 1776. However, Charles Calvert, like his father, had to embrace the Anglican faith to retain authority over his family&#x27;s province. The Calvert family&#x27;s dream of a haven in the Americas for Roman Catholics was at an end, and it took an American Revolution and the overthrow of the Calvert proprietary government to restore religious tolerance to Maryland.

Benedict&#x27;s portrait, along with those of the other Barons Baltimore, still hangs today in the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, the city that bears his family name.

<text>The Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) was a spectrograph installed on the Hubble Space Telescope. It was replaced by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph in 1997, and is now on display in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.
==FOS facts==
*Instrument type: Spectrograph
*Wavelength range: 115 to 850 nm

A technical description of the construction and operation of the FOS can be found in NASA technical report CP-2244. The instrument used two digicon detectors, &#x27;blue&#x27; and &#x27;red&#x27;, and had a spectral resolution of about 1300 over the 115 nm to 850 nm range. It had a number of apertures of varying size, but the aberration of the HST mirror meant that, until COSTAR was installed, the smallest apertures suffered very serious loss of light; even the largest 4.3-arcsecond aperture collected only 70% of the light from a point source.

The digicons suffered from inadequate magnetic shielding, which meant that a static image was smeared over several pixels; the red digicon suffered most from this. Also, either the blue detector or one of the mirrors in the system was contaminated in such a way as to remove sensitivity below 150 nm; this was a serious problem since it makes the Lyman-alpha line at 121.6 nm inaccessible.

<text>Timothy James &quot;Matthew&quot; Fox (born December 21, 1940) is an American priest and theologian. Formerly a member of the Dominican Order within the Catholic Church, he became a priest in the Episcopal Church following his expulsion from the order in 1993.

Fox has written 35 books that have been translated into 68 languages and have sold millions of copies and by the mid-1990s had attracted a &quot;huge and diverse following&quot;.

==Life==
===Dominican friar===
Timothy James Fox was born in Madison, Wisconsin. In 1960, when he entered the Catholic Dominican Order (the Order of Preachers), he was given the religious name &quot;Matthew&quot;. He received masters degrees in both philosophy and theology from the Aquinas Institute of Philosophy and Theology and later earned a Doctorate of Spiritual Theology, summa cum laude, from the Institut Catholique de Paris, studying with Marie-Dominique Chenu who named the Creation Spirituality tradition for him. It was Thomas Merton, the Catholic monk, who steered Fox to study at the Institut Catholique de Paris. After receiving his doctorate, Fox began teaching at a series of Catholic universities, including Loyola University in Chicago and Barat College of the Sacred Heart in Lake Forest, Illinois.

In 1976, Fox moved to Chicago&#x27;s Mundelein College (now part of Loyola University) to start the Institute of Culture and Creation Spirituality (ICCS), a master&#x27;s program in Creation Spirituality with a unique pedagogy that integrated both left and right brain centers and would eventually lead to conflict with Church authorities. His holistic pedagogy included among its faculty Jungian psychologist John Giannini, physicist/cosmologist Brian Swimme, feminist theologian Rosemary Radford Ruether, along with many artists teaching &quot;art as meditation.&quot; In 1983, Fox moved ICCS to Oakland, California, and began teaching at Holy Names University, where he was a professor for 12 years.

In 1984 Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger — the future Pope Benedict XVI, then head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith — asked the Dominican Order to investigate Fox&#x27;s writings. When three Dominican theologians examined his works and did not find his books heretical, Ratzinger ordered a second review, which was never undertaken.

Due to his questioning of the doctrine of original sin, in 1988 Ratzinger forbade Fox from teaching or lecturing for a year. Fox wrote a &quot;Pastoral Letter to Cardinal Ratzinger and the Whole Church,&quot; calling the Catholic Church a dysfunctional family. After a year &quot;sabbatical,&quot; Fox resumed writing, teaching, and lecturing. In 1991 his Dominican superior ordered Fox to leave the ICCS in California and return to Chicago or face dismissal. Fox refused.

On March 31, 1991, Fox made an extended appearance on the British television discussion program &quot;After Dark&quot;, alongside Piltdown Man debunker Teddy Hall; secular humanist activist Barbara Smoker; theologian N. T. Wright; playwright Hyam Maccoby (who theorized that Jesus was an apocalyptic Jew and Messianic claimant); author Ian Wilson (known chiefly for speculative writing on the Shroud of Turin); and others. In 1993, Fox&#x27;s conflicts with Catholic authorities climaxed with his expulsion from the Dominican Order for &quot;disobedience&quot;, effectively ending his professional relationship with the church and his teaching at its universities.

Among the issues Ratzinger objected to were his feminist theology; calling God &quot;Mother&quot;; preferring the concept of Original Blessing over Original Sin; not condemning homosexual behavior; and teaching the four paths of creation spirituality – the &quot;Via Positiva&quot;, &quot;Via Negativa&quot;, &quot;Via Creativa&quot;, and &quot;Via Transformativa&quot; — instead of the church&#x27;s classical three paths of purgation, illumination and union.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Molly O&#x27;Neill says that the Vatican was presented with a request on the part of the Dominicans that the theologian be dismissed. According to John L. Allen, Jr., it was largely in reaction to the unconventional programming at ICCS, with a faculty that included a masseuse, a Zen Buddhist, a yoga teacher, and Starhawk, a feminist Wiccan.

===Episcopal priest===
After his expulsion, Fox met young Anglican activists in England who were using &quot;raves&quot; as a way to bring life back to their liturgy and to attract young people to church worship. He was inspired to begin holding his own series of &quot;Techno Cosmic Masses&quot; in Oakland and other U.S. cities, events designed to connect people to a more ecstatic and visceral celebration and relationship with ritual and the building of community.

Fox was received into the Episcopal Church (Anglican Communion) as a priest in 1994 by Bishop William Swing of the Episcopal Diocese of California.

In 1996, Fox founded the University of Creation Spirituality in Oakland, an outgrowth of his institutes at Mundelein and Holy Names. The university offered similar master&#x27;s degree programs in creation spirituality and related studies. It was initially accredited through an affiliation with New College of California, before shifting in 1999 to affiliate with the Naropa Institute of Boulder, Colorado, creating and running Naropa&#x27;s master&#x27;s degree program. The university also added a separate doctorate of ministry degree, with a curriculum based on his 1993 book &quot;The Reinvention of Work: A New Vision of Livelihood for Our Time&quot;, which talked about a &quot;priesthood of all workers&quot;.

Fox led the University of Creation Spirituality for nine years, then was succeeded as president by James Garrison in 2005. The institution was subsequently renamed Wisdom University.

Since leaving the university, Fox has continued to lecture, write and publish books. In 2005, he founded an educational organization geared to reach out to inner-city youth called Youth and Elder Learning Laboratory for Ancestral Wisdom Education (YELLAWE). The YELLAWE program is based on a holistic approach to education and creativity derived from Fox’s master’s level programs. It also includes physical training in bodily meditation practices such as tai chi. YELLAWE has operated in inner-city school systems in Oakland and Chicago.

Fox&#x27;s proponents hold that his teachings are more gender-neutral, ecology sensitive, and accepting of non-traditional sexuality, than church orthodoxy.

==Creation Spirituality==
While some academic theologians refer to Fox as the next Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, others call him a populizer, not an intellectual. Robert Brow characterizes the teachings as &quot;esoteric excursions into ethics, theology, and mysticism&quot;.

===Basic tenets===
Fox&#x27;s conception of Creation Spirituality draws on both a close reading of biblical sources and early medieval mystics within Christian traditions as well as today&#x27;s science. It seeks common ground with numerous faiths from around the world, in an approach Fox called &quot;deep ecumenism&quot; for its connections across many spiritual practices. This was described most particularly in his book &quot;One River, Many Wells: Wisdom Springing from Global Faiths&quot;.

Creation Spirituality considers itself a “green” theology, emphasizing a holy relationship between humanity and nature. Accordingly, the sacredness of nature is considered a sacrament, and creation is considered an expression of God and the “Cosmic Christ&quot;. This approach was endorsed by eco-theologian Thomas Berry among others. Fox&#x27;s book &quot;The Coming of the Cosmic Christ: The Healing of Mother Earth and the Birth of a Global Renaissance&quot; delves more into these issues.

Fox also laid out other tenets of Creation Spirituality in some of his other books, particularly &quot;Original Blessing,&quot; &quot;A Spirituality Named Compassion,&quot; and &quot;Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the People of the Earth&quot;.

Fox’s 1996 autobiography, &quot;Confessions: The Making of a Post-Denominational Priest&quot;, describes his life as a Dominican priest and his struggle with the Vatican as he wrote about his experiences and understanding of early Christianity. This book was updated and published by North Atlantic Books in 2016.

Fox also has authored or edited nearly 35 other books, largely on various spiritual teachings, teachers, and mystics (listed below). He was the first to translate Meister Eckhart into English from the critical German editions along with a commentary on his work and helped to launch the Hildegard of Bingen revival. His book on the mysticism of Thomas Aquinas translates many of his works that have never before been translated into English, German or French.

Fox&#x27;s theological positions have been categorized as a type of monism, specifically panentheism. Some have claimed this approach is integral to Fox&#x27;s creation spirituality.

Fox&#x27;s theology has received plaudits from noted spiritual figures including Dom Bede Griffiths, OSB, who said: &quot;“(Matthew Fox’s) creation spirituality is the spirituality of the future and his Theology of the Cosmic Christ is the theology of the future.&quot; About the 25th-anniversary edition of &quot;Original Blessing&quot;, John B. Cobb, professor emeritus at the Claremont School of Theology, wrote: &quot;Fox&#x27;s accomplishment in &quot;Original Blessing&quot; was more than to recover a form of spirituality that had been obscured and to show its profound relevance and importance for our time. He used spirituality as an avenue into the depths of Christian faith and theology in general...Gradually the book is assuming the status of a classic. In due course, it will take its place in the history of spirituality and indeed in the history of theology.&quot;

===Techno Cosmic Mass===
Fox&#x27;s &quot;Techno Cosmic Mass&quot; (more recently called &quot;Cosmic Mass&quot;) is an attempt to combine the religious ritual of the Eucharist with dance and multimedia material, deejays, video jockeys, and rap music. They evoke and connect spiritual rituals and the ecstatic energy of techno and rave parties. They developed from a group called the Nine O&#x27;Clock Service in Sheffield, England, in the late 1980s and early 1990s and were brought to the United States and further developed by Fox. Over 100 Cosmic Masses have been celebrated in North America and numerous persons have studied how to present them.

===95 theses===
In 2005, while preparing for a presentation in Germany and following the election of Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI, Fox created 95 theses that he then translated into German. On the weekend of Pentecost, arrangements were made for him to nail these to the door of the Wittenberg church where Martin Luther nailed the original 95 Theses in the 16th century, an act often associated with the Protestant Reformation.

The action fueled the creation of a lively blog involving tens of thousands of Germans. In his theses, Fox called for a new reformation in Western Christianity. In his supporting book, &quot;A New Reformation&quot;, Fox argued that two Christianities already exist and it is time for a new reformation to acknowledge that fact and move the Western spiritual tradition into new directions.

<doc id="884142" wikidata="Q1746206" url="?curid=884142" title="Klein–Nishina formula">
<text>In particle physics, the Klein–Nishina formula gives the differential cross section (i.e. the &quot;likelihood&quot; and angular distribution) of photons scattered from a single free electron, calculated in the lowest order of quantum electrodynamics. It was first derived in 1928 by Oskar Klein and Yoshio Nishina, constituting one of the first successful applications of the Dirac equation. The formula describes both the Thomson scattering of low energy photons (e.g. visible light) and the Compton scattering of high energy photons (e.g. x-rays and gamma-rays), showing that the total cross section and expected deflection angle decrease with increasing photon energy.

== Formula ==
For an incident unpolarized photon of energy formula_1, the differential cross section is:

: formula_2

where

* formula_3 is the classical electron radius (~2.82 fm, formula_4 is about 7.94 × 10−30 m2 or 79.4 mb)
* formula_5 is the ratio of the wavelengths of the incident and scattered photons
* formula_6 is the scattering angle (0 for an undeflected photon).

The angular dependent photon wavelength (or energy, or frequency) ratio is
: formula_7

as required by the conservation of relativistic energy and momentum (see Compton scattering). The dimensionless quantity formula_8 expresses the energy of the incident photon in terms of the electron rest energy (~511 keV), and may also be expressed as formula_9, where formula_10 is the Compton wavelength of the electron (~2.42 pm). Notice that the scatter ratio formula_11 increases monotonically with the deflection angle, from formula_12 (forward scattering, no energy transfer) to formula_13 (180 degree backscatter, maximum energy transfer). 

In some cases it is convenient to express the classical electron radius in terms of the Compton wavelength: formula_14, where formula_15 is the fine structure constant (~1/137) and formula_16 is the &quot;reduced&quot; Compton wavelength of the electron (~0.386 pm), so that the constant in the cross section may be given as:
: formula_17

== Polarized photons ==
If the incoming photon is polarized, the scattered photon is no longer isotropic with respect to the azimuthal angle. For a linearly polarized photon scattered with a free electron at rest, the differential cross section is instead given by:
: formula_18
where formula_19 is the azimuthal scattering angle. Note that the unpolarized differential cross section can be obtained by averaging over formula_20.

== Limits ==

=== Low energy ===
For low energy photons the wavelength shift becomes negligible (formula_21) and the Klein–Nishina formula reduces to the classical Thomson expression:
: formula_22
which is symmetrical in the scattering angle, i.e. the photon is just as likely to scatter backwards as forwards. With increasing energy this symmetry is broken and the photon becomes more likely to scatter in the forward direction.

=== High energy ===
For high energy photons it is useful to distinguish between small and large angle scattering. For large angles, where formula_23, the scatter ratio formula_24 is large and
: formula_25
showing that the (large angle) differential cross section is inversely proportional to the photon energy.

The differential cross section has a constant peak in the forward direction:
: formula_26
independent of formula_27. From the large angle analysis it follows that this peak can only extend to about formula_28. The forward peak is thus confined to a small solid angle of approximately formula_29, and we may conclude that the total small angle cross section decreases with formula_30.

== Total cross section ==
The differential cross section may be integrated to find the total cross section:

: formula_31

In the low-energy limit there is no energy dependence, and we recover the Thomson cross section (~66.5 fm2):
: formula_32

== History ==
The Klein–Nishina formula was derived in 1928 by Oskar Klein and Yoshio Nishina, and was one of the first results obtained from the study of quantum electrodynamics. Consideration of relativistic and quantum mechanical effects allowed development of an accurate equation for the scattering of radiation from a target electron. Before this derivation, the electron cross section had been classically derived by the British physicist and discoverer of the electron, J.J. Thomson. However, scattering experiments showed significant deviations from the results predicted by the Thomson cross section. Further scattering experiments agreed perfectly with the predictions of the Klein–Nishina formula.

<text>The Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS or HRS) was an ultraviolet spectrograph installed on the Hubble Space Telescope during its original construction, and it was launched into space as part of that space telescope aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; on April 24, 1990 (STS-31). The instrument is named after 20th century rocket pioneer Robert H. Goddard.

One of the results was the discovery of tenuous atmosphere for Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa in 1995. The gas was determined to be mostly of molecular oxygen (O2). The surface pressure of Europa&#x27;s atmosphere is 0.1 μPa, or 10−12 times that of the Earth.

An example GHRS use was to observe the local interstellar medium in the direction towards Capella.

The Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph was removed from the Hubble Space Telescope during the February, 1997, Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; mission STS-82 (also called SM-2 for Servicing Mission 2). It, and the Faint Object Spectrograph, were replaced by two new instruments installed during the mission, the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph.

==Instrument details==
*Instrument type: Ultraviolet spectrograph
*Wavelength range: 1150 to 3200 Å (105 to 320 nm)
*Resolving power 
** Low - 2,000

<doc id="884145" wikidata="Q6727688" url="?curid=884145" title="Madian, Beijing">
<text>Madian ( &quot;Caravansary&quot; or &quot;Horse Pasture&quot;) is a community in Haidian District, Beijing, China. It is adjacent to the intersection of the 3rd Ring Road and the Jingzang Expressway (formerly Badaling Expressway), at the Haidian District-Xicheng District border. Two separate subdistrict offices serve portions of Madian.

A complex overpass links the northern segment of the 3rd Ring Road with an express route coming from Deshengmen on the 2nd Ring Road through to the Jingzang Expressway. Madian historically had a Hui population, and the Madian Mosque is located in the community.

Madian Bridge has been expanded twice to create two direct links to the expressway. A few years ago, the route to Deshengmen was expanded and is now a city express route.

==History==
Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and C. Cindy Fan, authors of &quot;Growth and Decline of Muslim Hui Enclaves in Beijing,&quot; wrote that Madian historically was in a &quot;relatively peripheral part of the city&quot; and in particular &quot;peripheral to the core areas of the city&quot;. During the Yuan dynasty Madian was within the Beijing city wall. After the wall was rebuilt during the Ming dynasty, Madian was outside of the city wall.

Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan stated that according to historical records the first Hui arrived in Madian during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty. Turmoil in northwestern China during the Qing dynasty caused many Hui to move eastward. A population of Hui, mostly horse and sheep traders, settled in Madian due to its access to horse and sheep trading routes. Therefore, a large trading market in horses and sheep was established there. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan argued that the name &quot;Madian&quot; may have originated from the horse trading that occurred there and argued that this &quot;may also be related to&quot; the prevalence of the Ma family name in Madian. Kangxi built the Madian Mosque in 1662. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan had interviewed an administrator of the mosque, who stated that the mosque &quot;probably&quot; opened due to a pre-existing Hui population.

Around the 1930s, traders of pigs and pork detoured around Madian because it was homogeneously Muslim. The head of a resident committee interviewed by Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan in August 2000 stated that Madian was over 90% Muslim in the 1950s. In the late 1950s, the community received an influx of people displaced by the construction of the Great Hall of the People.

In the initial years after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic in 1949 new housing developments appeared in Madian. Due to its location accessible to other areas, Madian was selected as a place for the development of new housing. Apartments were built in the place of the slaughterhouse and sheep market after those facilities were demolished. Han people moved into the apartments, causing the percentage of Hui people to decrease. Weiping Wu and Piper Gaubatz, authors of &quot;The Chinese City&quot;, wrote that the result was that &quot;lost much of its Muslim character&quot;. The resident head stated that in the 1980s fewer than 30% of the people in Madian were Muslim. In 1996 Dru C. Gladney, author of &quot;Muslim Chinese: Ethnic Nationalism in the People&#x27;s Republic&quot;, wrote that &quot;recent studies indicate that the [Hui] community continues to maintain a strong solidarity.&quot;

In the decades before 2002 the expansion of highways and roads further changed the character of Madian. Many Hui left Madian when the Dechang Road was constructed in the 1980s. This road later became a part of the Badaling Expressway. In the 1990s developers started renovation projects in Madian because of its location along the 3rd Ring Road. In 1993 the renovation of the Yulanyuan had been completed. The central buildings are three story residential buildings that do not reflect the Islamic culture. Prior to the renovation the area had been named &quot;Nancun&quot; or Southern Village (C: 南村, P: &quot;Náncūn&quot;). More Hui left the neighborhood during the construction of the 3rd Ring Road in the 1990s. After the renovation of Yulanyuan, 40% of the original residents returned. In other parts of Madian, the rates of return from former residents were lower. Ultimately most of the displaced Hui Madian residents settled in more inexpensive areas further from the Beijing city core, in the northern and northwestern parts of Beijing.

Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan stated that post-renovation Madian was &quot;relatively expensive&quot;. In 2000, many former residents of Madian would have been unable to move back there or have been required to buy a smaller living area if they wanted to move back as the purchase price of a new apartment was above 10,000 yuan per square meter. The resident head stated that in 2000 Madian was about 25% Muslim. In 2002 Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan stated that &quot;Madian has lost much of its character as a Hui enclave in terms of both residential and economic functions.&quot; The three authors added that Gladney&#x27;s conclusions about the solidarity of the community were &quot;quickly outdated.&quot;

As of 2002 the development plans state that a multifunctional building named &quot;CityChamp Palace&quot; would be the centerpiece of Madian.

==Demographics==
In 1982 there were 2,266 Han individuals in 660 households, 922 Hui individuals in 282 households, and 65 Manchu individuals in 30 households. The district was 28.6% Hui. 7.8% of the Han individuals have intermarried with Hui or Manchu, 11.2% of the Hui individuals have intermarried with Han or Manchu, and 80% of the Manchu individuals have intermarried with Han or Hui.

==Government and infrastructure==
In 2002 Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan argued that the fact that Madian is divided between two administrative offices instead of being under one has &quot;undermined&quot; the Hui community and therefore, unlike the Niujie area in Xicheng District, the city government was less willing to preserve the Hui community in Madian due to developmental pressures.

==Economy==
As of 2002 the community had several Hui groceries, three or four beef and mutton shops, and eight small Hui restaurants. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that it is &quot;likely&quot; that &quot;most of these businesses will disappear&quot; as the renovation project of Madian continues its course. In addition, in an interview in August 2000 the head of a Madian resident committee stated that even though going to Niujie from Madian meant a lengthy commute, many Madian Hui preferred to travel there to purchase beef and mutton. The three authors wrote that the decline of the Hui population in Madian furthers the decline of the Hui economy there, and vice versa in a repeating process.

Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that &quot;Historically, the Hui people in Madian were highly concentrated in businesses linked to the sheep market and were less proficient in other economic activities.&quot; During the reign of the Daoguang Emperor, the district sold a total of 130,000 head of animals in one year. The central street of Madian had 13 animal shops with a combined annual sale of 30,000 head of animals. Up until the 1950s a slaughterhouse in Madian was the primary source of mutton and beef of the Hui population of Beijing. The introduction of locomotives damaged the economy of Madian, since it caused the end of the caravan trade. During the late Republican period a heavy taxation was imposed, further damaging the economy. As a result, the Madian economy diversified. By the 1930s annual sales of sheep within Madian were between 30,000 and 50,000. The sheep market was demolished in the early part of the People&#x27;s Republic, prior to the Chinese economic reform. As the Hui population declined, the Hui business activity declined.

==Education==

The Beijing Haidian Minzu Primary School (S: 北京市海淀区民族小学, P: &quot;Běijīng Shì Hǎidiànqū Mínzú Xiǎoxué&quot;, &quot;Beijing Haidian Ethnic Group Primary School&quot;) serves ethnic minorities in the Madian area. It was previously named Madian Primary School (S: 马甸小学, P: &quot;Mǎdiàn Xiǎoxué&quot;).

<doc id="884146" wikidata="Q1827717" url="?curid=884146" title="Lisa Brown (actress)">
<text>Lisa Brown (August 2, 1954 – November 24, 2021) was an American actress. She was best known for two high-profile roles in daytime television, Nola Reardon on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and Iva Snyder on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;.

==Early years==
Brown was born on August 2, 1954, in Kansas City, Missouri.

== Career ==
Brown&#x27;s first notable role was on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, where she played the role of Nola Reardon Chamberlain from 1980 to 1985 and again from 1995 to 1998 (with an appearance in the show&#x27;s final weeks in 2009). She and actor Michael Tylo, who played Quint, were a popular pairing on the show.

Brown also created another notable soap role in the form of Iva Snyder on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, playing her from November 6, 1985, to 1994 and with several guest appearances from 1998 to 2003.

Both roles were created by writer Douglas Marland, and Brown was in some ways a &quot;muse&quot; for Marland&#x27;s writing.

After her acting roles on both shows concluded, she was an acting coach for &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

Brown appeared in the lead role of Broadway version of &quot;42nd Street&quot; in the early 80s, while simultaneously playing her &quot;Guiding Light&quot; role. Other daytime work includes a short stint as a corrupt FBI agent on &quot;Loving&quot; in 1995.

== Personal life ==
Brown was married to Tom Nielsen, an actor who played one of Brown&#x27;s love interests, Floyd Parker, on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, from 1979 to 1985. They had two children together, Victoria and James &quot;Buddy&quot; Anthony Nielsen, who as a child played her infant son on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and is now the lead singer of Senses Fail. Brown helped produce and direct several of their videos.

In 1997, she married Brian Neary.

Brown lived the remainder of her life in Jersey City, New Jersey.

Brown died on November 24, 2021, at the age of 67. In a post on his Instagram shortly after her death, Buddy Nielsen indicated that she had a &quot;quick battle with cancer.&quot;

<text>Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, (29 September 1699 – 24 April 1751) was an English politician and colonial administrator who served as the proprietary governor of the Province of Maryland. He inherited the title to Maryland aged just fifteen, on the death of his father and grandfather, when the colony was restored by the British monarchy to the Calvert family&#x27;s control, following its seizure in 1688. In 1721 Charles came of age and assumed personal control of Maryland, travelling there briefly in 1732. For most of his life, he remained in England, where he pursued an active career in politics, rising to become Lord of the Admiralty from 1742 to 1744. He died in 1751 in England, aged 52.

==Early life==
Charles Calvert was born in England on 29 September 1699, the eldest son of Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore, and Charlotte Lee, Lady Baltimore. His grandmother Charlotte Lee, Countess of Lichfield, was the illegitimate daughter of Charles II, by his mistress, Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland.

Like the rest of his Calvert family, Charles had been raised a Catholic but was withdrawn from his Jesuit school when his father Benedict converted to Anglicanism, largely for political reasons. Henceforth father and son would worship within the Church of England, much to the disgust of Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, who upheld his Catholic faith, despite the political drawbacks, until his death in 1715.

==Career in politics==
===Background===

In 1688, eleven years before Charles Calvert (1699–1751) was born, the Calvert family had lost their title to the Province of Maryland, following the events of the Glorious Revolution in England. In 1689 the royal charter to the colony was withdrawn, leading to direct rule by the British Crown. In 1715, when Charles was fifteen, his grandfather Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore died, passing his title, and his claim to Maryland, to his son Benedict Leonard Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore, (1679–1715). Benedict Calvert immediately petitioned George I for the restoration of the family&#x27;s proprietorial title to Maryland but, before the king could rule on the petition, Benedict Calvert himself died, just two months after his father, passing on his title in turn to his son Charles. Charles Calvert soon found himself, aged just fifteen, in the fortunate position of having had his family&#x27;s proprietorial title to Maryland restored by the king.

In 1721 Charles came of age and, at 21, assumed control of the colony of Maryland, though he appointed his cousin Charles Calvert, then a captain in the Grenadier Guards, as governor.

In 1722, Charles Calvert, fifth Baron Baltimore found himself in financial difficulties and sold the Kiplin estate, his family&#x27;s home since 1620, to his mother&#x27;s second husband (his stepfather) Christopher Crowe for £7,000 (approximately £550,000 in modern currency) (later purchased as historical inheritance for the State of Maryland by the University of Maryland).

In 1727 Lord Baltimore appointed his brother, Benedict Leonard Calvert, governor of the colony, replacing his cousin Captain Calvert. The handover of power from cousin to cousin was not entirely smooth. Captain Calvert insisted on retaining fifty per cent of the 3 pence tobacco duty which was his due under legislation passed in 1727. Benedict was unimpressed, and his younger brother Cecil wrote to him that family opinion in England was appalled at Captain Calvert&#x27;s behaviour, and &quot;thinks him mad&quot;. Lord Baltimore himself wrote that Benedict should receive the full benefit of the tax.

Unfortunately, Benedict&#x27;s health was poor and he died of tuberculosis on 1 June 1732, while sailing back to England. He was succeeded in 1732 by Governor Samuel Ogle under whose rule Maryland became engaged in a border dispute with Pennsylvania. Several settlers were taken prisoners on both sides and Pennsylvania sent a committee to Governor Ogle to resolve the situation. Rioting broke out in the disputed territory and Ogle appealed to the King for resolution.

===Journey to Maryland===
Faced with this situation, Charles sailed to Maryland and personally assumed charge of the colony in 1732, becoming for a brief period governor in his own right. His purpose in undertaking the long journey was chiefly to settle the dispute with Pennsylvania, as well as to attend to other pressing matters. Violence had broken out on the border with Pennsylvania, with Maryland loyalists such as Thomas Cresap engaging in violent exchanges with hostile Pennsylvanians.

Unfortunately for the Marylanders, Charles unwittingly agreed to a settlement of the territorial dispute with Pennsylvania, based on an inaccurate map, using calculations of latitude and longitude which were either wrong or were deliberately omitted. Upon realizing the scale of his deception, Lord Baltimore reneged on the agreement, but in 1735 The Penns brought proceedings in the Court of Chancery in London to enforce compliance. Chancery proceedings were notoriously slow and a final verdict was not reached until 1750, when Lord Chancellor Hardwicke found in favour of the claims of the Pennsylvanians in every respect. Charles&#x27;s error ultimately resulted in the loss to Pennsylvania of approximately one thousand square miles of Maryland territory.

===Return to England===
In 1732 Calvert returned to England, again leaving the government of Maryland in the hands of Governor Samuel Ogle, and pursued a successful career in English politics. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and a friend of fourth-cousin, Frederick Louis who was Prince of Wales and the eldest son of King George II of Great Britain. He was Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales between 1731 and 1747.

In 1739 he sailed on his new yacht &quot;Augusta&quot; for Russia to represent the British royal family at the marriage of Grand Duchess Anna Leopoldovna of Russia to Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. The union, designed to strengthen the relationships between the houses of Romanov and Habsburg, was celebrated in grand style. Francesco Algarotti, the Italian polymath accompanied Calvert and sent detailed accounts of the journey to and from St Petersburg to his friend Lord Hervey. Also in the party were mathematician Erasmus King, and young Thomas Desaguliers, son of Dr John Theophilus Desaguliers.

Baltimore was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for St Germains, a rotten borough in Cornwall, from 1734 to 1741, and was MP for Surrey from 1741 to 1751. He was Lord of the Admiralty from 1742 to 1744, and from 1747 to 1751 he was Surveyor-General of the Duchy of Cornwall. In addition, he was Cofferer of the Household to the Prince of Wales from 1747 to 1751.

Calvert was able to sit in the House of Commons as a member of the Irish peerage. Irish peerages were often used as a way of creating peerages which did not grant a seat in the English House of Lords and so allowed the grantee to sit in the House of Commons in London. As a consequence, many Irish peers had little or no connection to Ireland.

George II said of Charles Calvert: &quot;there is my Lord Baltimore, who thinks he understands everything, and understands nothing: who wants to be well with both Courts and is well with neither, and who, entre nous, is a little mad.&quot;

==Family==
On 20 July 1730, Charles married Mary Janssen, who died at Chaillot, Paris, on 25 March 1770, the daughter of Sir Theodore Janssen, 1st Baronet, and Williamza or Williamsa Henley. Mary&#x27;s sister, Barbara, married Thomas Bladen a year later. Charles and Mary had three children:
*Frederick Calvert (6 February 1731 – 4 September 1771) who succeeded his father to become the 6th and final Lord Baltimore, but led a life of idleness, indulgence and scandal.
* Caroline Calvert, born ca. 1745, who on 26 April 1763 married Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland, the last colonial governor of Maryland. His rule was overthrown during the events of the American Revolution in 1774–6.
* Louisa Calvert, married John Browning. On the death of her brother Frederick in 1771, Louisa contested his will, arguing that she should inherit the proprietorship of Maryland, rather than Frederick&#x27;s illegitimate son Henry Harford. Before the suit could be decided, Maryland was part of the independent United States of America.

Charles also had an illegitimate son, Benedict Swingate Calvert, born in around 1730–32. His mother&#x27;s identity is not clear but H. S. Lee Washington, writing in the New England Historic Genealogical Society Register in July 1950, suggests that she was Melusina von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham. Melusina was the daughter of George I of Great Britain and his mistress, Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal. Whatever the truth of this, it seems likely that Benedict&#x27;s mother was a person of some consequence. According to a letter of Benedict&#x27;s daughter-in-law Rosalie Stier Calvert dated 10 June 1814, his mother had been a woman &quot;of the highest rank in England&quot;. In 1742, aged about ten or twelve years, the young Benedict was escorted to America and placed in the care of Dr. George H. Steuart, an Annapolis physician and a political ally of the Calverts.

It appears Charles Calvert also had two illegitimate children by Cecil Mignon Bressan (b. 1717), daughter of Peter Bressan: Charles Cecil Bressan Calvert and Augustus Bressan Calvert.

==Woodcote Park==

Charles lived with his family at Woodcote Park in Epsom, Surrey, a grand estate originally built in the seventeenth century by Richard Evelyn, brother to John Evelyn the diarist. He made many changes to the house, though his brothers complained that he &quot;pulled down everything&quot; and &quot;finished nothing&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

Charles died in 1751 and was succeeded by his eldest legitimate son, Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore. Unlike his father, Frederick Calvert took little interest in politics, treating his estates, including Maryland, as mere sources of revenue to indulge his appetites, which were considerable. By 1776 Maryland had been engulfed in the American Revolution and the Calverts would lose control over their proprietary colony for good.

Charles Calvert&#x27;s portrait, along with those of the other Barons Baltimore, still hangs today in the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, the city that bears his family name.

The historian Thomas Carlyle described Calvert as &quot;something of a fool, judging by the face of him in portraits, and by some of his doings in the world&quot;, though other historians have been kinder to his reputation.

The official flag of the State of Maryland, uniquely among the fifty states, still bears the arms of the Barons Baltimore to this day.

Charles County and Charles Street in Baltimore is named for Charles Calvert.

<text>Justin Considine Green (July 25, 1945 – April 23, 2022) was an American cartoonist who is known as the &quot;father of autobiographical comics.&quot; A key figure and pioneer in the 1970s generation of underground comics artists, he is best known for his 1972 comic book &quot;Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary&quot;.

== Biography ==
Green was born in Boston, Massachusetts, but grew up in Chicago, Illinois, the son of a Jewish father and Catholic mother; he was raised Catholic. As a child he at first attended a Catholic parochial school, and later transferred to a school where most students were Jews. He rejected the Catholic faith in 1958 as he believed it caused him &quot;compulsive neurosis&quot; that decades later was diagnosed as obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD).

Green was studying painting at the Rhode Island School of Design when in 1967 he discovered the work of Robert Crumb and turned to cartooning, attracted to what he called Crumb&#x27;s &quot;harsh drawing stuffed into crookedly-drawn panels&quot;. He experimented with his artwork to find what he called an &quot;inherent and automatic style as a conduit for the chimerical forms in own psyche&quot;. He dropped out of an MFA program at Syracuse University when in 1968 he felt a &quot;call to arms&quot; to move to San Francisco, where the nascent scene was blossoming amid the counterculture there.

Green&#x27;s short comics pieces appeared in various titles and anthologies including Art Spiegelman&#x27;s and Bill Griffith&#x27;s anthologies &quot;Arcade&quot; and &quot;Young Lust&quot;. But in 1972, he was overwhelmed by an urgent desire to tell the story of his personal anxieties. &quot;Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary&quot; is a solo comic book that details Green&#x27;s struggle with a form of OCD known as scrupulosity, within the framework of growing up Catholic in 1950s Chicago. Intense graphic depiction of personal torment had never appeared in comic book form before, and it had a profound effect on other cartoonists and the future direction of comics as literature. Art Spiegelman was so inspired by &quot;Binky Brown&quot; that he thought he&#x27;d try his own memoir-type story, a strip he called &quot;Maus&quot; which some years later became the seed of &quot;Maus&quot;.

Green was also a master sign painter, which he described during the 1980s in his monthly comic strip for the trade publication &quot;Signs of the Times&quot;, that later became a book entitled &quot;Justin Green&#x27;s Sign Game&quot; (Last Gasp, June 1995).

In the 1990s, Green focused his cartooning attention on a series of visual biographies for &quot;Pulse!&quot;, the in-house magazine for Tower Records. It ran for ten years, later collected into an anthology known as &quot;Musical Legends&quot; (Last Gasp, 2004 ).

Green still made comics the way he did when he started, by dipping a pen nib into an ink bottle.

Justin and his wife Carol Tyler are the subject of the documentary film &quot;Married to Comics&quot; which presented in 2023 at the Small Press Expo event feature at the AFI Silver Theater and Culture Center.

== Personal life ==
Green&#x27;s younger brother Keith Green (c. 1951–1996) was also involved in the underground comix movement, as an underground distributor from c. 1968–1975, and publishing comics under the name Keith Green Industrial Realities (as well as the imprint Saving Grace) in the period c. 1971–1977. He later became an art dealer. Keith Green died in 1996.

Justin Green lived in Cincinnati, and was married to fellow cartoonist Carol Tyler. Green and Tyler met in San Francisco in the early 1980s; they have a daughter together, Julia, who is also an artist.

Green also has a daughter Catlin b. 1976 and was first cousins with film director William Friedkin (Green&#x27;s father and Friedkin&#x27;s mother are siblings).

== Death ==
Green died on April 23, 2022, in Cincinnati. His death was announced by Carol Tyler on her Facebook page.

<text>Santos Edward Ortega (June 30, 1899 – April 10, 1976) was an American actor and comedian. He was best known for playing Will Hughes in &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, taking over from Will Lee, who had played the role from the first episode on April 2, 1956, to May 31, 1956. Ortega continued in the role until his death in 1976.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ortega was born in New York City on June 30, 1899, to parents Rafael (born in Venezuela and of Spanish descent) and Isabella (née Corbett, from Ireland) Ortega. 
Rafael Ortega was a cigar maker by trade, which may have influenced his son&#x27;s habit of cigar smoking throughout his career.

Ortega initially had aspirations of joining the priesthood and studied briefly at the St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary of the De La Salle Christian Brothers in Pocantico Hills, New York, but changed his mind after landing a series of small acting roles in a series of Broadway productions.

===Stage===
He began his career when he was 17 in the theater in &quot;an extravaganza at the old Hippodrome Theater. Later, he went on tour with a singing group, returning to New York City to appear on the Broadway stage including roles in &quot;Jeb&quot; (1946), &quot;Puppets of Passion&quot; (1927), &quot;What Never Dies&quot; (1926-1927), &quot;What&#x27;s the Use&quot; (1926), and &quot;Marilyn&#x27;s Affairs&quot;.

===Radio===
As radio stations began to come on the air in large numbers, radio programs began to gain momentum, thus opening up new opportunities for Ortega. He first worked in radio in comedy, appearing on a variety show, &quot;Blackstone Plantation&quot;, where he played a character named Don Rodrigo. Ortega later said that he was hired for the role after a casting director hired the young unknown based on seeing Ortega&#x27;s name, assuming that he would be perfect for the role.

Despite Ortega&#x27;s ethnic-sounding name, and the fact that he did have Latino origins on his father&#x27;s side, he did not speak Spanish. He came to learn that if he convincingly mastered a Spanish dialect, more work would come his way, and it did.

He served as straight man for the duo of Frank Crumit and Julius Sanderson. Ortega said, &quot;It was a song and patter show, and I provided the laughter.&quot; He went on to be active in the medium, starring in &quot;The Adventures of Nero Wolfe&quot; (1943–1944) and narrating &quot;Gang Busters&quot;, as well as &quot;Stroke of Fate&quot;. Perhaps his most famous and notable radio role was Commissioner Weston on &quot;The Shadow&quot;. He played the title role in &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; (1942–43) and was heard in the daytime radio serials &quot;Valiant Lady&quot; (as Edward Curran), &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, 1948&#x27;s &quot;Roger Kilgore, Public Defender&quot;, and as the title character in &quot;The Adventures of Charlie Chan&quot; (1947–1948), &quot;The Affairs of Peter Salem&quot; from 1949 to 1953, and &quot;Hannibal Cobb&quot; (1950–1951).

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s and into the 1950s and early 1960s, the prolific Ortega lent his remarkable range of voice characterizations to numerous other radio drama series such as &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot;, &quot;The Mysterious Traveler&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Casey Crime Photographer&quot;, &quot;The Eternal Light&quot;, &quot;The Columbia Workshop&quot;, &quot;The Big Story&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;You Are There&quot;, &quot;Dimension X&quot;, and &quot;X Minus One&quot;.

He also originated the radio role of Inspector Queen on &quot;The Adventures of Ellery Queen&quot;.

===Television===
On television, he played Will Hughes (usually just referred to as &quot;Grandpa&quot;) on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, replacing Will Lee as of June 21, 1956. On November 22, 1963, he was in the middle of a scene with actress Helen Wagner when CBS suddenly cut in with the first bulletin on President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. (The cast, which was performing the episode live, was not yet aware of the situation.) Ortega continued in the role until shortly before his death in 1976.

===Film===
Ortega played character roles in two films during the 1950s: &quot;The Family Secret&quot; (1951) and &quot;Crowded Paradise&quot; (1956).

===Personal life===
Ortega was married twice. He married Evelyn Fairbank in 1926, but the couple had no children and later divorced. He later married Cynthia Beckett, 20 years his junior, when he was around 50 years old. They would go on to have two children.

Ortega was a lifelong tobacco user who often smoked cigars during his radio shows. However, during his tenure on &quot;As The World Turns,&quot; he was most often seen smoking a pipe.

===Death===
Ortega died on April 10, 1976, in Broward General Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, while he was visiting in that area. He was 76. Survivors included a son, a daughter and a sister. A memorial service was held April 25, 1976, at the Church of the Heavenly Rest in New York City.

<doc id="884173" wikidata="Q5497489" url="?curid=884173" title="Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore">
<text>Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (6 February 1731 – 4 September 1771), styled The Hon. Frederick Calvert until 1751, was an English peer and who was the last Baron Baltimore. Although he exercised almost feudal power in the Province of Maryland, he never once set foot in the colony, and unlike his father, he took little interest in politics, treating his estates, including Maryland, largely as sources of revenue to support his extravagant, often scandalous lifestyle. In 1768 he was accused of abduction and rape by Sarah Woodcock, a noted beauty who kept a milliner&#x27;s shop at Tower Hill. The jury acquitted Calvert, but he left England soon afterwards, and never recovered from the public scandal that surrounded the trial. Dogged by the criticism and poor health, he contracted a fever and died in Naples at the age of 40.

== Early life ==
Frederick Calvert was born in 1731, the eldest son of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, 3rd Proprietor Governor of Maryland (1699–1751). He was named after his godfather, Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of George II, and father of George III. The young Frederick was sent to Eton College to be educated, where he acquired some proficiency in the classics. Calvert had two sisters, Caroline Calvert, born about 1745, and Louisa Calvert.

== Adulthood and inheritance ==
In 1751 Charles Calvert died, and Frederick, aged just 20, inherited from his father the title Baron Baltimore and the Proprietary Governorship of the Province of Maryland, becoming at once both a wealthy nobleman in England and a powerful figure in America. Maryland was then a British colony administered directly by the Calverts. Frederick benefited from an income of some £10,000 a month from taxes and rents, an immense sum at the time. In addition, he controlled shares in the Bank of England, and an estate at Woodcote Park, in Surrey.

=== Maryland ===
Calvert&#x27;s inheritance coincided with a period of rising discontent in Maryland, amid growing demands by the legislative assembly for an end to his family&#x27;s authoritarian rule. Calvert, however, took little interest in the colony and, unlike his predecessors, never set foot there. Instead, he lived in England and on the European continent, particularly in Italy and, for a time in Constantinople, which he was eventually forced to leave after being accused of keeping a private harem. Calvert lived a life of leisure, writing verse and regarding the Province of Maryland as little more than a source of revenue.

During the 1750s, during the French and Indian War, when funds were needed to finance the common defence of the colonies, Maryland alone refused its share. Calvert was prepared to pass an Act raising taxes but only if his own vast estates were exempted. Benjamin Franklin later wrote: &quot;It is true, Maryland did not then contribute its proportion, but it was, in my opinion, the fault of the Government, and not of the people&quot;. The colony was ruled through governors appointed by Calvert, such as Horatio Sharpe and later Robert Eden. Governor Sharpe was keenly aware of the difficulties placed upon his subjects by Lord Baltimore&#x27;s intransigence, but his hands were tied. Calvert oversaw the end of the long-running Penn–Calvert Boundary Dispute.

=== Marriage ===
On 9 March 1753, he married Lady Diana Egerton (3 March 1732 – 13 August 1758), youngest daughter of Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater by Lady Rachel Russell. The union was not a success, and the couple spent most of their married life apart. They had no children, and in May 1756 they were formally separated due to &quot;incompatibility of temper&quot;. In 1758, Lady Diana died, &quot;from a hurt she received by a fall out of a Phaeton carriage&quot;, while accompanied by her husband. Although Calvert was suspected of foul play, no charges were brought.

=== European travels ===
Calvert&#x27;s reputation for exotic living spread quickly. In 1764 James Boswell (1740–1795) began his Grand Tour of Europe, having heard that Baltimore was &quot;living at Constantinople like a Turk, with his seraglio all around him&quot;.&quot; Boswell also observed that Baltimore &quot;... lived luxuriously and inflamed his blood, then he became melancholy and timorous, and was constantly taking medicines... he is living a strange, wild, life, useless to his country, except when raised to a delirium, and must soon destroy his constitution&quot;.

Calvert spent a good deal of time in Italy, where the German art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–1768) described him as being &quot;one of those worn-out beings, a hipped Englishman, who had lost all physical and moral taste&quot;.

Such was Calvert&#x27;s fascination with the Ottoman Turks that in 1766, on his return to England, he pulled down part of his London house, rebuilding it in the style of a Turkish harem. In 1767 Calvert published an account of his travels in the East, titled &quot;A tour to the East, in the years 1763 and 1764: with Remarks on the City of Constantinople and the Turks. Also Select Pieces of Oriental Wit, Poetry and Wisdom&quot;. The book, said Horace Walpole, &quot;deserved no more to be published than his bills on the road for post-horses&quot;, adding that it demonstrated how &quot;a man may travel without observation, and be an author without ideas&quot;. It gains a mention from a character in Tobias Smollett&#x27;s epistolary novel &quot;The Expedition of Humphry Clinker&quot;.

Calvert&#x27;s spending was prodigious, and he spent considerable sums of money on his family estate at Woodcote Park. According to Walpole, Calvert spent a great deal of money making the interior of the house &quot;tawdry&quot; and &quot;ridiculous&quot; in the &quot;French&quot; style.

== Trial, scandal and decline ==

In 1768, Calvert was accused of abduction and rape by Sarah Woodcock, a noted beauty who kept a milliner&#x27;s shop at Tower Hill. He was indicted at Kingston Assizes, and put on trial, pleading not guilty by reason of consent. After deliberating for an hour and twenty minutes the jury acquitted Calvert, believing that Woodcock did not make adequate attempts to escape.

Much salacious gossip accompanied the trial, and in the same year, one of Calvert&#x27;s willing sexual partners, Sophia Watson, found it opportune to write a salacious autobiography entitled &quot;Memoirs of the Seraglio of the Bashaw of Merryland, by a Discarded Sultana&quot; (London, 1768) Her readers were left in no doubt as to whom she was referring to, which further harmed Baltimore&#x27;s reputation. Sultana Watson offered many intimate details of life in the seraglio, including the predictable, unkind suggestion that Baltimore himself was barely able to satisfy one, let alone eight, mistresses.

Following his acquittal Frederick left England, presumably hoping that his notoriety did not extend to Europe. In this he seems to have been at least partly correct, as in July 1769 the British Ambassador to Russia reported that &quot;Lord Baltimore arrived here last week from Sweden; I had the honour to present him to the Empress, who was pleased to receive his Ld extremely graciously.&quot; Nevertheless, Calvert&#x27;s brush with the law does not appear to have affected his unconventional living arrangements. Count Maximilian von Lamberg wrote of his travels:

In 1769, my Lord was travelling with eight women, a physician, and two negroes, which he called his &quot;corregidores,&quot; who were entrusted with the discipline of his little &quot;seraglio.&quot; With the aid of his physician, he conducted odd experiments on his houris: he fed the plump ones only acid foods and the thin ones milk and broth. He arrived at Vienna with the train I have described; when the chief of police requested him to declare which of the eight ladies was his wife, he replied that he was an Englishman, and that when he was called upon to give an account of his sexual arrangements, if he could not settle the matter with his fists, it was his practice to set out instantly on his travels again.

By this time it is evident that he was suffering from financial difficulties, and in 1768 he sold the family&#x27;s great estate at Woodcote Park, apparently to a wealthy Soho upholsterer.

=== Death in Naples ===
Calvert never returned to his native England. His mother, Mary Janssen, died at Chaillot, Paris, on 25 March 1770. He remained on the continent, &quot;constantly moving ... that he might not know where he should be buried&quot;, and it was in Naples in September 1771 that he contracted a fever and died. His body was returned to London, lying in state at the Great Room of Exeter Exchange, Strand, and was interred in his family&#x27;s vault at St. Martin&#x27;s &quot;with much funeral pomp, the cavalcade extending from the church to the eastern extremity of Epsom&quot;. According to &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Quarterly&quot;: &quot;His Lordship had injured his character in his life by seduction, so that the populace paid no regard to his memory when dead, but plundered the room where his body lay the moment it was removed&quot;.

He was buried in Epsom, Surrey.

== Family and children ==

Calvert had numerous illegitimate children by various women, though he does appear to have attempted to support them. He is said to have left, on his death &quot;a whole &quot;seraglio&quot; of white, black, etc, to provide for.&quot;

Calvert had two children by Hester Whelan:
*Henry Harford (1758–1835), the last Lord Proprietor of Maryland.
*Frances Mary Harford (1759–1822) who married William Frederick Wyndham (1763–1828) on 21 July 1784. Their son George Wyndham became the 4th Earl of Egremont.

In 1765, he fathered twin daughters with Elizabeth Dawson of Lincolnshire, Sophia and Elizabeth Hales.

He had another daughter, Charlotte Hope, born in Hamburg in 1770, with Elizabeth Hope of Münster, Germany.

== Maryland and the War of Independence ==
In his will, Calvert left his proprietary Palatinate of Maryland to his eldest (perhaps only confirmed) illegitimate son, Henry Harford, then aged just 13. This was done against the wishes of his family, though Calvert did provide for cash bequests to his sisters, specifically £20,000 to be divided between Louisa and Caroline. The colony, perhaps grateful to be rid of Frederick at last, duly recognised Harford as Calvert&#x27;s heir. However, the will was challenged by the family of Calvert&#x27;s sister, Louisa Calvert Browning, who did not recognise Harford&#x27;s inheritance. Before the case could grind its way through the Court of Chancery, events in America changed Maryland forever. Unfortunately for the young Henry, by the time he had reached adulthood, Maryland had become engulfed by the American Revolution, and by 1776 was at war with Britain. Henry Harford ultimately lost almost all his colonial possessions, though he remained wealthy due to his extensive inheritance in Great Britain.

== Reputation and legacy ==

Calvert was not generally well-regarded by his contemporaries. One characterised him as &quot;Feeble in body, conceited, frivolous, and dissipated, but withal generous and sympathetic ... [a man] who gave himself up to a life of pleasure&quot;. Another described him as &quot;a disreputable and dissolute degenerate&quot;. Posterity has been little kinder to his reputation.

Some have said that Frederick County, Maryland, is named after the last Baron Baltimore, but this remains unproven. The official flag of the State of Maryland, uniquely among the 50 states, bears witness to his family legacy.

<text>Medical billing, a payment process in the United States healthcare system, is the process of reviewing a patient&#x27;s medical records and using information about their diagnoses and procedures to determine which services are billable and to whom they are billed. 

This bill is called a claim. Because the U.S. has a mix of government-sponsored and private healthcare, health insurance companies - otherwise known as payors - are the primary entity to which claims are billed for physician reimbursement. The process begins when a physician documents a patient&#x27;s visit, including the diagnoses, treatments, and prescribed medications or recommended procedures. This information is translated into standardized codes through medical coding, using the appropriate coding systems such as ICD-10-CM and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT). A medical biller then takes the coded information, combined with the patient&#x27;s insurance details, and forms a claim that is submitted to the payors.

Payors evaluate claims by verifying the patient&#x27;s insurance details, medical necessity of the recommended medical management plan, and adherence to insurance policy guidelines. The payor returns the claim back to the medical biller and the biller evaluates how much of the bill the patient owes, after insurance is taken out. If the claim is approved, the payor processes payment, either reimbursing the physician directly or the patient. Claims that are denied or underpaid may require follow-up, appeals, or adjustments by the medical billing department. 

Accurate medical billing demands proficiency in coding and billing standards, a thorough understanding of insurance policies, and attention to detail to ensure timely and accurate reimbursement. While certification is not legally required to become a medical biller, professional credentials such as the Certified Medical Reimbursement Specialist (CMRS), Registered Health Information Administrator (RHIA), or Certified Professional Biller (CPB) can enhance employment prospects. Training programs, ranging from certificates to associate degrees, are offered at many community colleges, and advanced roles may require cross-training in medical coding, auditing, or healthcare information management.

Medical billing practices vary across states and healthcare settings, influenced by federal regulations, state laws, and payor-specific requirements. Despite these variations, the fundamental goal remains consistent: to streamline the financial transactions between physicians and payors, ensuring access to care and financial sustainability for physicians. 

==History==
In 18th century England, physicians were not legally permitted to charge fees for their services or take legal action to collect payments. Instead, patients would offer &quot;honoraria,&quot; which were voluntary payments inspired by what was believed to be a Roman custom. This honorarium rule applied only to non-surgeon physicians. Meanwhile, surgery was treated as a &quot;public calling,&quot; allowing courts to cap surgeons&#x27; fees to reasonable amounts. The honorarium rule for non-surgeon physicians and the public calling status for surgeons highlighted the unique, non-commercial constraints on medical professionals at the time. These constraints further emphasized professionalism over commerce, distinguishing these professions from regular businesses. 

In the 19th century, the American colonies abandoned the English honorarium and public calling principles. Instead, physicians could use standard contract and commercial law to set and collect fees. Unlike in England, U.S. courts viewed medical services like goods with fixed prices, allowing physicians to sue for outstanding payments and freely set terms, independent of obligations tied to public service. 

Before the spread of health insurance, doctors charged patients according to what they thought each patient could afford. This practice was known as sliding fees and became a legal rule in the 20th century in the U.S. Eventually, changing economic conditions and the introduction of health insurance in the mid-20th century ushered an end to the sliding scale. Health insurance became a conduit for billing, and it standardized fees by negotiating fee schedules, eliminating additional charges, and restricting discounts that the sliding scale offered. 

For several decades, medical billing was done almost entirely on paper. However, with the advent of medical practice management software, also known as health information systems, it has become possible to efficiently manage large amounts of claims. Many software companies have arisen to provide medical billing software to this particularly lucrative segment of the market. Several companies also offer full portal solutions through their web interfaces, which negates the cost of individually licensed software packages. Due to the rapidly changing requirements by U.S. health insurance companies, several aspects of medical billing and medical office management have created the necessity for specialized training. Medical office personnel may obtain certification through various institutions who may provide a variety of specialized education and in some cases award a certification credential to reflect professional status.

==Billing process==

Visiting a doctor might feel like a straightforward one-on-one interaction, but it is actually part of a much larger and more complex system involving information exchange and payment processing. While an insured patient typically interacts only with a healthcare provider during a visit, the encounter is part of a three-party system.

The first party in this system is the patient. The second is the healthcare provider, a term that encompasses not only physicians but also hospitals, physical therapists, emergency rooms, outpatient facilities, and other entities delivering medical services. The third and final party is the payor, typically an insurance company, which facilitates reimbursement for the services rendered.

Medical billing involves creating invoices for services rendered to patients, a process known as the billing cycle or Revenue Cycle Management (RCM). RCM encompasses the entire revenue collection process for a healthcare facility, beginning with the design of the RCM workflow. This cycle can take anywhere from a few days to several months, often requiring multiple interactions before achieving resolution. The relationship between healthcare providers and insurance companies resembles that of a vendor and subcontractor: healthcare providers contract with insurers to deliver services to covered patients.

Step 1: Patient Registration

The process begins when a patient schedules an appointment. For new patients, this involves gathering essential information, including their medical history, insurance details, and personal data. For returning patients, the focus is on updating records with the latest reason for the visit and any changes to their personal or insurance information. This foundational step ensures the practice has accurate and up-to-date records for billing and care coordination.

Step 2: Determining Financial Responsibility

Once the patient is registered, the next step is to identify which treatments or services their insurance plan will cover. Insurance policies often include specific guidelines regarding covered procedures and exclusions, and these rules can change annually. To avoid billing complications, it is critical for the healthcare provider to stay informed about the most recent coverage requirements for each insurance plan.

Step 3: Assigning Codes

This is where medical billing departs from medical coding. Medical coders are responsible for this step and they rely on two standardized coding systems to document and classify the services provided, which will eventually be put into a bill by medical billers.

ICD Codes: Developed by the World Health Organization, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes describe the conditions or symptoms being evaluated or treated. The current version, ICD-10, will transition to ICD-11 in 2025, requiring updated coding practices.

CPT Codes: Created by the American Medical Association (AMA), Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes correspond to the procedures or treatments performed by the healthcare provider. These codes are essential for accurately billing and receiving reimbursement.

For every patient encounter, providers must record both ICD codes to identify the diagnosis and CPT codes to document the treatment. Given the vast number of codes—approximately 70,000 for ICD and over 10,000 for CPT—using advanced medical billing software is recommended to streamline the coding process, reduce errors, and ensure compliance with current standards.

These steps set the stage for efficient claims submission and payment, forming the backbone of the billing cycle.

Step 4: Creating the Superbill

Once a patient’s visit is complete and they check out, the next step is to compile all the relevant information into a document called the Superbill. This document serves as the foundation for the reimbursement claim submitted to the payor. The Superbill includes essential details about the provider, the patient, and the visit, ensuring that the claim is complete and accurate for efficient processing.

Components of a Superbill

Provider Information

Full Name

National Provider Identifier (NPI) Number

Practice Location

Contact Information

Referring Provider’s Name and NPI (if applicable)

Provider’s Signature

Patient Information

Full Name

Date of Birth

Contact Information

Insurance Details

Visit Information

Date of Visit

Relevant CPT and ICD Codes

Fees Charged for Services

Duration of Visit

By consolidating this information into the Superbill, healthcare providers create a structured summary that facilitates claim submission and ensures proper documentation for payor review. This step is vital in maintaining accuracy and minimizing errors during the medical billing process.

Step 5: Preparing and Submitting Claims

Using the Superbill, the medical biller creates a detailed claim and submits it to the insurance company for reimbursement. Accuracy and completeness are critical during this step to ensure the claim is accepted on the first submission—referred to as a clean claim. Achieving a high clean claims rate is a key metric for measuring the efficiency of the billing cycle. Creation of the claim is where medical billing most directly overlaps with medical coding because billers take the ICD/CPT codes used by the medical coders and creates the claim.

Step 6: Monitoring payor Adjudication

Once the payor receives the claim, they review it to determine whether it is accepted, denied, or rejected. Understanding these outcomes is essential:

Accepted Claims

Accepted claims are processed for payment.

Payment amounts depend on the specifics of the patient’s insurance plan and may not cover the entire billed amount.

Denied Claims

These claims are properly filed but do not meet the payor’s criteria for payment.

Common reasons include billing for services not covered by the plan, highlighting the importance of verifying insurance coverage during patient registration.

Denied claims require investigation to identify the issue and prevent future occurrences.

Rejected Claims

Rejected claims cannot be processed, typically due to errors or omissions in the filing process.

Unlike denied claims, rejected claims must be corrected and resubmitted.

Failure to address rejected claims can lead to significant revenue loss, making timely rework essential.

Step 7: Creating Patient Statements

After the payor processes the claim and pays their portion, any remaining balance is billed to the patient in a separate statement. Ideally, patients will promptly settle their accounts, completing the billing cycle. However, delays or non-payments are common, requiring providers to follow up to ensure full reimbursement.

Step 8: Following Up on Payments

Following up on outstanding claims and patient statements is a crucial step in capturing revenue that might otherwise be lost. Practices should focus on reducing payment barriers to make the process as simple as possible for patients.

Implementing a patient portal with online payment options can streamline the process, allowing patients to pay their bills at their convenience.

A self-service system encourages on-time payments and reduces the likelihood of accounts being sent to collections.

Consistent follow-ups and clear communication help address common billing issues and improve overall payment rates.

By maintaining an efficient follow-up system, practices can minimize revenue leakage and keep the billing cycle running smoothly.

Visiting a doctor might feel like a straightforward one-on-one interaction, but it is actually part of a much larger and more complex system involving information exchange and payment processing. While an insured patient typically interacts only with a healthcare provider during a visit, the encounter is part of a three-party system.

The first party in this system is the patient. The second is the healthcare provider, a term that encompasses not only physicians but also hospitals, physical therapists, emergency rooms, outpatient facilities, and other entities delivering medical services. The third and final party is the payor, typically an insurance company, which facilitates reimbursement for the services rendered.

===Electronic billing===
A practice that has interactions with the patient must now, under HIPAA law 1996, send most billing claims for services via electronic means. Prior to actually performing service and billing a patient, the care provider may use software to check the eligibility of the patient for the intended services with the patient&#x27;s insurance company. This process uses the same standards and technologies as an electronic claims transmission with small changes to the transmission format, this format is known specifically as X12-270 Health Care Eligibility &amp; Benefit Inquiry transaction. A response to an eligibility request is returned by the payor through a direct electronic connection, or more commonly their website. This is called an X12-271 &quot;Health Care Eligibility &amp; Benefit Response&quot; transaction. Most practice management/EM software will automate this transmission, hiding the process from the user.

This first transaction for a claim for services is known technically as X12-837 or ANSI-837. This contains a large amount of data regarding the provider interaction, as well as reference information about the practice and the patient. Following that submission, the payor will respond with an X12-997, simply acknowledging that the claim&#x27;s submission was received and that it was accepted for further processing. When the claim(s) are actually adjudicated by the payor, the payor will ultimately respond with a X12-835 transaction, which shows the line-items of the claim that will be paid or denied; if paid, the amount; and if denied, the reason.

===Payment===
In order to be clear on the payment of a medical billing claim, the health care provider or medical biller must have complete knowledge of different insurance plans that insurance companies are offering, and the laws and regulations that preside over them. Large insurance companies can have up to 15 different plans contracted with one provider. When providers agree to accept an insurance company&#x27;s plan, the contractual agreement includes many details, including fee schedules which dictate what the insurance company will pay the provider for covered procedures, and other rules such as timely filing guidelines.

Providers typically charge more for services than what has been negotiated by the physician and the insurance company, so the expected payment from the insurance company for services is reduced. The amount that is paid by the insurance is known as an &quot;allowed amount&quot;. For example, although a psychiatrist may charge $80.00 for a medication management session, the insurance may only allow $50.00, and so a $30.00 reduction (known as a &quot;provider write off&quot; or &quot;contractual adjustment&quot;) would be assessed. After payment has been made, a provider will typically receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) along with the payment from the insurance company that outlines these transactions.

The insurance payment is further reduced if the patient has a copay, deductible, or a coinsurance. If the patient in the previous example had a $5.00 copay, the physician would be paid $45.00 by the insurance company. The physician is then responsible for collecting the out-of-pocket expense from the patient. If the patient had a $500.00 deductible, the contracted amount of $50.00 would not be paid by the insurance company. Instead, this amount would be the patient&#x27;s responsibility to pay, and subsequent charges would also be the patient&#x27;s responsibility, until his or her expenses totaled $500.00. At that point, the deductible is met, and the insurance would issue payment for future services.

A coinsurance is a percentage of the allowed amount that the patient must pay. It is most often applied to surgical and/or diagnostic procedures. Using the above example, a coinsurance of 20% would have the patient owing $10.00 and the insurance company owing $40.00.

Steps have been taken in recent years to make the billing process clearer for patients. The Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) unveiled a &quot;Patient-Friendly Billing&quot; project to help healthcare providers create more informative and simpler bills for patients. Additionally, as the Consumer-Driven Health movement gains momentum, payors and providers are exploring new ways to integrate patients into the billing process in a clearer, more straightforward manner.

===Medical billing services===
Some providers outsource their medical billing to a third parties, known as medical billing companies, which provide medical billing services. One goal of these entities is to reduce the amount of paperwork for medical staff and to increase efficiency, providing the practice with the ability to grow. The billing services which can be outsourced include regular invoicing, insurance verification, collections assistance, referral coordination, and reimbursement tracking.

Practices have achieved cost savings through group purchasing organizations (GPO).

==== Medical billing vs medical coding ====
While medical billing and medical coding are closely related and often go hand-in-hand, they serve distinct functions in the healthcare industry. Medical coders are responsible for translating healthcare services, diagnoses, and procedures into standardized codes used for billing purposes. These codes ensure that healthcare providers receive accurate reimbursement from insurance companies. On the other hand, medical billing involves using these codes to create and submit claims to insurance companies and patients. In essence, medical coders lay the foundation by providing the necessary codes, while medical billers use those codes to process payments and manage patient accounts. Understanding both roles is crucial, as they work together to ensure the financial stability of healthcare providers.

<text>Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary is an autobiographical comic by American cartoonist Justin Green, published in 1972. Green takes the persona of Binky Brown to tell of the &quot;compulsive neurosis&quot; with which he struggled in his youth and which he blamed on his strict Catholic upbringing. Green was later diagnosed with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and came to see his problems in that light.

In the story, sinful thoughts that he cannot control torment Binky Brown; to his alarm, phallic objects become literal penises and project what he calls &quot;pecker rays&quot; at religious objects such as churches and statues of the Virgin Mary. He develops an internal set of rules to obey and punishments for breaking them. The torment does not subside, and he comes to reject the Catholic Church in defiance as the source of it. The work combines a wide variety of visual and narrative techniques in a style that echoes the torment of its protagonist.

&quot;Binky Brown&quot; had an immediate influence on contemporaries in : such cartoonists as Aline Kominsky, Robert Crumb, and Art Spiegelman soon turned to producing similarly confessional works. &quot;Binky Brown&quot; has gained a reputation as the first major work of autobiography in English-language comics, and many aspects of its approach have become widespread in underground and alternative comics.

==Background==
Justin Green (1945–2022) was born to a Jewish father and Catholic mother and raised Catholic. As a child he at first attended a Catholic parochial school, and later transferred to a school where most students were Jews. He rejected the Catholic faith in 1958 as he believed it caused him &quot;compulsive neurosis&quot; that decades later was diagnosed as obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD).

Green was studying painting at the Rhode Island School of Design when in 1967 he discovered the work of Robert Crumb and turned to cartooning, attracted to what he called Crumb&#x27;s &quot;harsh drawing stuffed into crookedly-drawn panels&quot;. He experimented with his artwork to find what he called an &quot;inherent and automatic style as a conduit for the chimerical forms in own psyche&quot;. He dropped out of an MFA program at Syracuse University when in 1968 he felt a &quot;call to arms&quot; to move to San Francisco, where the nascent scene was blossoming amid the counterculture there. That year Green introduced a religion-obsessed character in the strip &quot;Confessions of a Mad School Boy&quot;, published in a periodical in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1968. He named the character Binky Brown in &quot;Binky Brown Makes up His Own Puberty Rites&quot;, published in the 17th issue of the underground comic book &quot;Yellow Dog&quot; in 1969. &quot;The Agony of Binky Brown&quot; followed in the first issue of &quot;Laugh in the Dark&quot;, published by Last Gasp in 1971.

At the time, comic books had a reputation in the US as low-brow children&#x27;s entertainment, and the public often associated them with juvenile delinquency. Comics had little cultural capital and few American cartoonists had challenged the perception that the medium was inherently incapable of mature artistic expression.

==Synopsis==
Green (the cartoonist) takes the persona of Binky Brown, who opens the story writing a confession of the neurosis that has tortured him since puberty. In Binky&#x27;s childhood, he knocks over a statue of the Virgin Mary and feels intense guilt over this affront to his mother and to God. Binky is raised a Catholic and undergoes the religious indoctrination of nuns at a strict Catholic parochial school that commonly employs corporal punishment. He forms an image of a vengeful God, which fills him with feelings of fear and guilt.

Binky&#x27;s intrusive thoughts bring him to believe that his body is trying to lead him to sin and eternal punishment. He develops an internal system of rules to cope with these thoughts and punishes himself for violations. He wards off thoughts and fantasies he could not control, and that gives him guilt by silently repeating the word &quot;noyatin&quot; to himself, a contraction of the repentant &quot;not a sin&quot;.

As he approaches adolescence and becomes aware of his sexuality, he begins to see common objects as phalluses—phalluses that project unholy rays. These objects include Binky&#x27;s fingers, toes, and his own penis, and he obsessively tries to deflect their &quot;pecker rays&quot; from reaching holy items such as churches or statues of Mary. Binky finds his anguish all-consuming as he imagines the destruction he cannot avoid and spends hours praying to God for forgiveness. Eventually Binky comes to the conclusion that he has sinned so much through his thoughts that he is bound for hell no matter what, and decides to experiment with a variety of activities considered sinful, including beer, speed, self-harm, Hesse novels, and acid trips. The narrator tells us that bad acid trips were like &quot;water off a duck&#x27;s back&quot; to Binky, since everyday routines were already potentially traumatic experiences. As an adult, as the effects of an acid trip are beginning to wear off, Binky encounters a statue of the Virgin Mary in his path. Expecting to be tormented by his neuroses, he tries to dissolve the tension by facetiously singing &quot;Lady of Spain&quot;. Binky is shocked when he walks by the statue and no distressing thoughts occur. 
Emboldened by this, Binky confronts his faith and by smashing a set of miniature statues of the Virgin Mary, he declares himself free of his obsession with sexual purity. Noticing that one of the statues in the pile has survived unscathed, he puts it on his mantel and says to himself &quot;Mother of God, eh? Guess I&#x27;ll build up some new associations around you now... Let bygones be bygones!&quot; 

==Composition and publication==
Green spent about a year working on the 44-page &quot;Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary&quot;. He took a few months making cards of what he called &quot;factual incidents or neurotic habits&quot; to incorporate. During the seven months he drew the work Green received a monthly stipend of $150 from Ron Turner, the founder of underground publisher Last Gasp Eco-Funnies. Last Gasp published the story as a one-shot comic book in 1972—Green&#x27;s first solo title. It went through two print runs of 55,000 copies each with a &quot;Youngsters Prohibited&quot; label on the cover.

In 1990, Green had an essay published entitled &quot;The Binky Brown Matter&quot; in &quot;The Sun&quot;. In the essay, he describes the OCD with which he was diagnosed years after completing &quot;Binky Brown&quot;. Last Gasp reprinted the story in 1995 in &quot;The Binky Brown Sampler&quot;, a softcover anthology of Binky Brown strips with an introduction by Art Spiegelman and an expanded version of &quot;The Binky Brown Matter&quot;.

Green sold the original artwork to the strip in the 1970s; McSweeney&#x27;s staff contacted the owner of the artwork, Christine Valenza, to make fresh scans for a standalone reprinting in 2009, overseen by McSweeney&#x27;s editor Eli Horowitz. It had a print run of 5,000 copies and reprints the artwork at the full size of the originals; the page reproductions mimic the actual pages, including marks, smudges, and corrections. In 2011, the publisher Stara published a French translation by Harry Morgan titled &quot;Binky Brown rencontre la Vierge Marie&quot;, and La Cúpula published a Spanish translation by Francisco Pérez Navarro titled &quot;Binky Brown conoce a la virgen María&quot;.

===Editions===
==Style and analysis==
The story takes the form of a guilt-ridden confession. In the opening, the adult Binky hangs over a sickle, bound from head to toe and listening to &quot;Ave Maria&quot; as he draws with a pen in his mouth. He declares his intention: &quot;to purge myself of the compulsive neurosis which I have served since I officially left Catholicism on Halloween, 1958&quot;. He justifies the work to communicate with the &quot;many others are slaves to their neuroses&quot; and who, despite believing themselves isolated, number so many that they &quot;would entwine the globe many times over in a vast chain of common suffering&quot;.

Though Green built &quot;Binky Brown&quot; on an autobiographical base he fabricated many scenes—such as one in which Binky is bullied by two third-graders—&quot;to suggest or convey a whole generalized idea about some subjective feeling, such as order or fear or guilt&quot;. To critic Charles Hatfield &quot;Binky Brown&quot; displays a &quot;radical subjectivity&quot; that calls into question the notion of objectivity in autobiography. The presentation is insistently subjective and non-literal in its visuals.

Despite the heavy tone, humor is prominent. The work is conscious of its own creation—Green&#x27;s drawing of it frames the narrative proper and there are constant reminders of it throughout. Green patterned the opening after those featuring the Crypt-Keeper in EC Comics&#x27; &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; series from the 1950s. Green used the adult Binky as the narrator of the captions and as a way to tie together the past and present timeframes. There is a disconnect in that the narrator refers to his younger self as &quot;he&quot;. Other references to comics include a &quot;Sinstopper&#x27;s Guidebook&quot;, which alludes to Dick Tracy&#x27;s &quot;Crimestopper&#x27;s Textbook&quot; and a cartoon by Robert Crumb in the background.

Green employs numerous Catholic symbols, such as a word balloon adorned with symbols of Christ&#x27;s martyrdom to represent the depth of Binky&#x27;s desperation. Catholic works such as a catechism and &quot;Treasure Chest&quot; parochial comics appear throughout the work.

Despite strict censorship in other media in the US, explicit sexuality was common in underground . &quot;Binky Brown&quot; was the first work of autobiographical comics to depict explicit sexuality: penises appear throughout, and Binky masturbates in one scene. The central symbol of the penis recurs sometimes subtly as in the images of pencils used to craft the work, and more often explicitly, as every phallic-like object Green sees becomes a literal &quot;pecker ray&quot;-projecting penis in Binky&#x27;s mind.

Art Spiegelman described the artwork as &quot;quirky and ungainly&quot;. Though it appears awkward, Green put considerable effort into elements such as graphical perspective, and draws attention to his craft by depicting himself drawing and by placing the drawing manuals &quot;Perspective&quot; and &quot;Fun with a Pencil&quot; in the backgrounds. In contrast to the mundane tales of Harvey Pekar, another prominent early practitioner of autobiographical comics, Green makes wide use of visual metaphors. In &quot;Binky Brown&quot; symbols become literal, as when Binky imagines himself becoming a snowball hurtling into Hell or as a fish chased by a police officer who wears a crucifix. The work displays a wide array of visual techniques: diagrammatic arrows; mock-scholarly documentation; a great variety in panel size, composition, and layout; and a range of contrasting mechanical and organic rendering techniques, such as screentone alongside dense hand-drawn hatching. The symbolic and technical collide where the Virgin Mary becomes the vanishing point of Binky&#x27;s converging &quot;pecker rays&quot;.

Critic Joseph Witek sees the shifting between different modes of traditional comics representation at times presents a literalist view through &quot;windowlike panels&quot;, and at others &quot;representational, symbolic, allegorical, associative, and allusive&quot;, an approach analogous to &quot;Binky Brown&#x27;s massively and chaotically overdetermined subjectivity&quot;. Witek finds roots for the fractured psychological landscape of &quot;Binky Brown&quot; in the comics of earlier eras: the unrestrained psyches in the dreams of Winsor McCay&#x27;s &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot;, the irrational, shifting landscapes of George Herriman&#x27;s &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, and Superman&#x27;s obsessively contrarian nemesis Bizarro.

In &quot;Binky Brown&quot; Green blames the Catholic Church for his psychological troubles; years later, he was diagnosed with OCD, and came to see these episodes in that light rather than as the fault of the Church. He nevertheless continued to blame the Church for contributing to his anxieties and maintained that religion has a magnifying influence on the condition. He said the abandoning of both religion and recreational drugs made it easier to cope with his condition. In 1990 a Catholic priest raised concerns that &quot;Binky Brown&quot; may be harmful to minors; Green countered that he believed it was the Church that was harming minors. Green likened his OCD to a &quot;split vision&quot; which made him &quot;both the slave to the compulsion and the detached observer&quot;.

Literary scholar Hillary Chute sees the work as addressing feminist concerns of &quot;embodiment and representation&quot; as it &quot;delves into and forcefully pictures non-normative sexuality&quot;. Chute affirms that despite its brevity &quot;Binky Brown&quot; merits the label &quot;graphic novel&quot; as &quot;the quality of work, its approach, parameters, and sensibility&quot; mark a &quot;seriousness of purpose&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
Green recounted &quot;a strong energy&quot; that &quot;Binky Brown&quot; drew from his readership, the first significant response he got from his work. The story has had a wide influence on underground and alternative comics, where its self-mocking and confessional approach has inspired numerous cartoonists to expose intimate and embarrassing details of their lives. Under the influence of &quot;Binky Brown&quot;, in 1972 Aline Kominsky published her first strip, the autobiographical &quot;Goldie: A Neurotic Woman&quot; in &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot; . Other contemporary underground cartoonists were soon to incorporate confessional autobiography into their work. Robert Crumb followed the same year with &quot;The Confessions of R. Crumb&quot; and continued with numerous other such strips. Art Spiegelman, who had seen &quot;Binky Brown&quot; in mid-creation in 1971, went as far as to state that &quot;without &quot;Binky Brown&quot; there would be no &quot;Maus&quot;&quot;—Spiegelman&#x27;s most prominent work. The same year as &quot;Binky Brown&quot;s publication, Green asked Spiegelman to contribute a three-page strip to the first issue of &quot;Funny &quot;, which Green edited and was published by Apex Novelties. Spiegelman delivered the three-page &quot;Maus&quot; in which Nazi cats persecute Jewish mice, inspired by his father&#x27;s experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp; years later he revisited the theme in the graphic novel of the same name. Comics critic Jared Gardner asserts that, while underground was associated with countercultural iconoclasm, the movement&#x27;s most enduring legacy was to be autobiography.

&quot;Binky Brown&quot; went out of print for two decades after selling its initial print runs, during which time enthusiasts traded copies or photocopies. Green made his living painting signs, and contributed occasional cartoon strips to various publications. Green used the Binky Brown persona over the years in short strips and prose pieces that appeared in underground periodicals such as &quot;Arcade&quot; and &quot;Weirdo&quot;. &quot;Sweet Void of Youth&quot; in 1976 follows Binky from high school to age thirty-one, torn between cartooning and more respected forms of art. Aside from occasional one-off strips, his more regular cartooning appeared in the ongoing strips &quot;The Sign Game&quot;, in &quot;Signs of the Times&quot; magazine, and &quot;Musical Legends in America&quot;, in &quot;Pulse!&quot; Such later work has attracted far less attention than &quot;Binky Brown&quot;.
Though autobiographical elements had appeared earlier in the work of underground cartoonists such as Crumb, Spain, and Kim Deitch, &quot;Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary&quot; has gained credit as the first important work of autobiographical comics in English. To Charles Hatfield &quot;Binky Brown&quot; is &quot;the ur-example of confessional literature in comics&quot;; for Paul Gravett Green was &quot;the first neurotic visionary to unburden his uncensored psychological troubles&quot;; Douglas Wolk declared Green and his work &quot;ahead of the memoirist curve&quot;; Art Spiegelman declared: &quot;What the Brontë sisters did for Gothic romance, what Tolkien did for sword-and-sorcery, Justin Green did for confessionary, autobiographical &quot;; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called the work the &quot;Rosetta Stone of autobiographical comics&quot;. 

&quot;Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary&quot; has appealed mostly to comics fans and cartoonists, and has gained little recognition from mainstream audiences and arts critics. Spiegelman has speculated this neglect comes from the nature of the comics medium; in contrast to explicit works such as Philip Roth&#x27;s &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot;, the penises in Green&#x27;s work are visual.

According to underground historian Patrick Rosenkranz, Green represents a break with past convention by being &quot;the first to openly render his personal demons and emotional conflicts within the confines of a comic&quot;. Green denied credit, calling confessional autobiography &quot;a &quot;fait accompli&quot;, a low fruit ripe for the plucking&quot;, examples of which abounded in literary works he had read by James Joyce, James T. Farrell, and Philip Roth. He has accepted credit for &quot;anticipat the groundswell in literature about obsessive compulsive disorder by almost two decades&quot;, for which he knew of no precedent. Chute sees major themes of isolation and coping with OCD recurring in autobiographical works such as Howard Cruse&#x27;s &quot;Stuck Rubber Baby&quot; (1995) and Alison Bechdel&#x27;s &quot;Fun Home&quot; (2006). Hatfield sees echoes of Green&#x27;s unrestrained approach to dealing with a mental condition in Madison Clell&#x27;s &quot;Cuckoo&quot; (2002)—about Clell&#x27;s dissociative identity disorder—and in David B.&#x27;s &quot;Epileptic&quot; (2003).

To cartoonist Jim Woodring, Green&#x27;s autobiographical work &quot;has never been surpassed&quot;. Woodring&#x27;s own autobiographical work in &quot;Jim&quot; draws from his dreams rather than his waking life. British-American cartoonist Gabrielle Bell sympathized with Brown&#x27;s approach, which she described as &quot;talking about his feelings or his emotional state when he was illustrating it with striking images that were sort of absurd or a weird juxtaposition&quot;. Green&#x27;s influence extended overseas to cartoonists such as the Dutch Peter Pontiac, who drew inspiration from &quot;Binky Brown&quot; and &quot;Maus&quot; to produce &quot;Kraut&quot; (2000), about his father who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II. 

The story ranked No. 9 on &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;″s list of the best hundred English-language comics of the 20th century, and featured as the cover artwork for the autobiographical comics issue of the journal &quot;Biography&quot; (Vol. 31, No. 1). Artwork to &quot;Binky Brown&quot; appeared in an exhibition of Green&#x27;s work at Shake It Records in Cincinnati in 2009.

<doc id="884208" wikidata="Q752404" url="?curid=884208" title="Buddhist councils">
<text>Since the death of the historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, Buddhist monastic communities (&quot;sangha&quot;) have periodically convened to settle doctrinal and disciplinary disputes and to revise and correct the contents of the Buddhist canons. These gatherings are often termed Buddhist &quot;councils&quot; (Pāli and Sanskrit: &quot;saṅgīti&quot;, literally meaning &quot;reciting together&quot; or &quot;joint rehearsal&quot;). Accounts of these councils are recorded in Buddhist texts as having begun immediately following the death of the Buddha and have continued into the modern era. 
The earliest councils are regarded as real events by every Buddhist tradition. However, the historicity and details of these councils remains a matter of dispute in modern Buddhist studies. This is because various sources belonging to different Buddhist schools contain conflicting accounts of these events and the narratives often serve to bolster the authority and prestige of specific schools.

== First Buddhist council ==

All six of the surviving Vinaya sources of various early Buddhist schools contain accounts, in whole or in part, of the first and second councils. The story of the First Council seems to be a continuation of the story of the Buddha&#x27;s final days and death told in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta and its equivalents in the Agamas. Based on correlations and continuity between these two texts, Louis Finot concluded that they had originated from a single narrative that was later split between the Sutta Pitaka and Vinaya Pitaka. In most schools, the account of the First Council is located at the end of the &quot;Skandhaka&quot; section of the Vinaya but before any appendices.

The first Buddhist council is traditionally said to have been held just after Buddha&#x27;s final nirvana, and presided over by Mahākāśyapa, one of his most senior disciples, at a cave near Rājagṛha (today&#x27;s Rajgir) with the support of king Ajatashatru. Its objective was to preserve the Buddha&#x27;s sayings (suttas) and the monastic discipline or rules (Vinaya). The Suttas were recited by Ananda, and the Vinaya was recited by Upali. Even though the Buddha had said that the Sangha could abolish the minor rules after his passing, the council made the unanimous decision to keep all the rules intact. According to Charles Prebish, almost all scholars have questioned the historicity of this first council.

Numerous Vinayas also depict various disagreements in the first council. Various monks disagreed on whether to keep or get rid of some of the minor rules (since the Buddha had told Ananda that this may be done). Some monks even argued all the minor rules should be abolished. Also, numerous early sources state that Mahakasyapa criticized Ananda in various ways. Analayo quotes one passage from a Chinese parallel to the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta (T 1428 at T XXII 966b18), in which Mahākassapa says: &quot;Ānanda is [like] a lay person. I am afraid that, being with covetousness in his mind, he will not recite the discourses completely.&quot; Analayo writes there may have been &quot;actual conflict between two contending factions in the monastic community after the Buddha’s decease, with the more ascetically inclined faction emerging as the winning party in the accounts of the first saṅgīti&quot;.

According to some traditional accounts, following the Buddha&#x27;s death, 499 of the Buddha&#x27;s top arhats were chosen to attend the council. Ananda, then a sotapanna, trained himself until the dawn of day of the council, at which point he attained arahatship and was allowed to join the council.

Regarding the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the third major division of the Tipitaka, modern academic scholarship holds that it was likely composed at a later date because of its contents and differences in language and style. According to Theravada tradition, the Abhidhamma Pitaka, and the ancient Atthakathā (commentary) were also included at the first Buddhist council in the Sutta category, but its literature is different from Sutta because the Abhidhamma Pitaka was authored by Sāriputta.

=== Alternative groups ===
The various Vinayas also recount another curious event during this time. The &quot;Cullavagga&quot; mentions there was an arhat named Purāṇa who stated that he and his followers preferred to remember the Buddha&#x27;s teachings in the manner he had heard it and so did not rely on the textual collections of the council. This figure is also found in the &quot;Aśokāvadāna&quot; and the &quot;Tibetan Dulvā Vinaya&quot;, which depict Purāṇa and another monk, Gavampati which were not present at the council and who worry about what will happen to the Dharma after the death of the Buddha. This account is described in the Chinese versions of the Dharmagupta and Mahīsāsaka Vinayas and in the &quot;Vinayamātrika Sūtra&quot;. Gavampati is said to have also maintained a set of eight rules regarding food which are retained by the Mahīsāsaka Vinaya.

A similar event is described by Chinese sources like the writings of the Indian scholar Paramartha, Jizang, and the pilgrim Xuanzang. According to these sources, an alternative canon named the &quot;Mahasamghikanikaya&quot; (Collection of the Great Assembly) was compiled by an Arhat named Baspa and his followers. Xuanzang reports visiting a stupa near Rajgir which marked the site of this alternate council.

=== Historicity ===
Several modern scholars doubt whether the entire canon was really recited during the First Council, because the early texts contain different accounts on important subjects such as meditation. It may be, though, that early versions were recited of what is now known as the &quot;Vinaya-piṭaka&quot; and &quot;Sutta-piṭaka&quot;. Nevertheless, many scholars, from the late 19th century onward, have considered the historicity of the First Council improbable. Some scholars, such as orientalists Louis de La Vallée-Poussin and D.P. Minayeff, thought there must have been assemblies after the Buddha&#x27;s death, but considered only the main characters and some events before or after the First Council historical. Other scholars, such as Buddhologist André Bareau and Indologist Hermann Oldenberg, considered it likely that the account of the First Council was written after the Second Council, and based on that of the second, since there were not any major problems to solve after the Buddha&#x27;s death, or any other need to organize the First Council.

On the other hand, archaeologist Louis Finot, Indologist E. E. Obermiller and to some extent Indologist Nalinaksha Dutt thought the account of the First Council was authentic, because of the correspondences between the Pāli texts and the Sanskrit traditions. Indologist Richard Gombrich meanwhile holds that &quot;large parts of the Pali Canon&quot; do date back to the first council.

== Second council and first schism ==
=== Second council ===
The historical records for the Second Buddhist Council derive primarily from the canonical Vinayas of various schools. It was held 100 years after the parinirvana of Buddha in the Valukarama of Vaiśālī and was patronised by the king Kalashoka. While inevitably disagreeing on points of details, these schools nevertheless agree that the bhikkhus at Vaisali were accepting monetary donations and following other lax practices (which led to a controversy when other monks discovered this). The lax practices are often described as &quot;ten points&quot;. The main issue though was accepting money from laypersons. These practices were first noticed by a monk named Yasa Kākandakaputta, who alerted other elders and called out the monks. In response, both the monks of Vaiśālī and Yasa gathered senior members of the Sangha from the region to consult in order to fully settle the issue. This dispute about vinaya, according to traditional sources, resulted in the first schism in the Sangha. But some scholars think that a schism did not occur at this time and instead happened at a later date.

=== First Schism ===

==== Vinaya dispute ====
The Cullavagga of the Pali Canon of Theravāda Buddhism holds that the Vaiśālī (Vajjiputtakā) monks practiced ten points (dasa vatthūni) which were against the Vinaya rules.

# Storing salt in a horn (singilonakappa).
# Eating food when the shadow of the sun had passed two fingers&#x27; breadth beyond noon (duvangulakappa).
# Eat once and then go again to the village for alms (gāmantarakappa).
# Holding of the uposatha separately by monks dwelling in the same district (āvāsakappa).
# Carrying out an official act when the assembly is incomplete (anumatikappa).
# Following a practice because it is so done by one&#x27;s tutor or teacher (ācinnakappa).
# Eating of sour milk by one who has already had his midday meal (amathitakappa).
# Use of the strong drink before it has fermented (jalogikappa).
# Use of blankets which have unstitched hem (nisīdanakappa).
# Accepting of gold and silver (jātarūparajatakappa).
The orthodox monks refused to agree to these points, and one of their leaders, Yasa Kākandakaputta, publicly condemned the action of the Vajjiputtakas. Yasa then left Kosambī, and, having summoned monks from Pāvā in the west and Avanti in the south, sought Sambhūta Sānavāsi in Ahoganga. On his advice they sought Soreyya-Revata, and together they consulted Sabbakāmi at Vālikārāma. In the Council that followed the Ten Points were declared invalid, and this decision was conveyed to the monks. Soon after was held a recital of the Doctrine in which seven hundred monks took part under the leadership of Soreyya-Revata. The recital lasted eight months. The Vajjiputtakas refused to accept the finding of Revata&#x27;s Council and formed a separate sect, the Mahāsanghikas, numbering ten thousand monks, who held a recital of their own. Accordingly, Theravāda Buddhism suggests that Mahāsāṃghikas tried to change the traditional Vinaya by adding the above ten points to it.

However, Mahāsāṃghikas hold that the Sthaviras (&quot;Elders&quot;) wanted to &#x27;add&#x27; more rules to the Vinaya. Vinaya texts associated with the Sthaviras do contain more rules than those of the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya. The Mahāsāṃghika Prātimokṣa (list of rules) has 67 rules in the &quot;śaikṣa-dharma&quot; section, while the Theravāda version has 75 rules. The Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya discusses how the Mahāsāṃghika disagree with the Sthavira &#x27;additions&#x27; to the Vinaya (&quot;Mahāsāṃghikavinaya,&quot; T.1425, p. 493a28-c22.).

The Mahāsāṃghika &quot;Śāriputraparipṛcchā&quot; contains an account in which an old monk rearranges and augments the traditional Vinaya. As stated in the &quot;Śāriputraparipṛcchā&quot;:

Due to the conflicting claims from both sects, a clear conclusion cannot be reached on whether the Sthaviras&#x27; or the Mahāsāṃghikas&#x27; Vinaya was the original Vinaya.

==== The Mahādeva episode and the &quot;five points&quot; ====
The alternative view of what caused the first schism is found in several Sthavira sources including the Theravada &quot;Dipavamsa&quot;. According to these sources, some 35 years after the second council, there was another meeting in Pāṭaliputra. This was called to dispute five points held by a figure named Mahādeva. The five points generally see arhats as imperfect and fallible. Sthavira sources claim the schism was caused by Mahādeva, who often depicted as an evil figure (who killed his parents). The &quot;five points&quot; describe an arhat as one still characterized by impurity due to being affected by nocturnal emissions (&quot;asucisukhavisaṭṭhi&quot;), ignorance (&quot;aññāṇa&quot;), doubt (&quot;kaṅkhā&quot;), reaching enlightenment through the guidance of others (&quot;paravitāraṇa&quot;), and speaking of suffering while in samādhi (&quot;vacibheda&quot;).

According to the Sthavira accounts, the majority (Mahāsaṃgha) sided with Mahādeva, and a minority of righteous elders (Sthaviras) were opposed to it, thus causing the first schism in the Buddhist community. According to this account, Mahadeva was criticized and opposed by Sthavira elders, and he eventually went on to become the founder of the Mahāsāṃghika school. Mahasamghika sources do not claim Mahadeva as a founder and do not agree with this account. As such, most scholars think that the Mahādeva incident was a later event and that it was not the root cause of the first schism.

Vasumitra&#x27;s &quot;Samayabhedoparacanacakra&quot; (a Sarvāstivāda source) claims the dispute in Pātaliputra that led to the first schism was over the five heretical points of Mahādeva which degrades the attainment of arhats. These same points are discussed and condemned in the Theravadin &quot;Kathavatthu&quot;. The later Sarvāstivāda &quot;Mahavibhasa&quot; develops this story into against the Mahasanghika founder, Mahādeva. According to this version of events, the king ends up supporting the Mahasanghikas. This version of events emphasizes the purity of the Kasmiri Sarvastivadins, who are portrayed as descended from the arahants who fled the persecution of Mahādeva and, led by Upagupta, established themselves in Kashmir and Gandhara.

The &quot;Samayabhedoparacanacakra&quot; also records a &#x27;Mahādeva&#x27; who seems to be a completely different figure who was the founder of the Caitika sect over 200 years later. Some scholars have concluded that an association of &quot;Mahādeva&quot; with the first schism was a later sectarian interpolation based on much later events. Jan Nattier and Charles Prebish argue that the five points of Mahadeva are unlikely to have been the cause of the first schism and see this event as &quot;emerging in a historical period considerably later than previously supposed and taking his place in the sectarian movement by instigating an internal schism within the already existing Mahāsāṃghika school.&quot;

== Theravada accounts of a third council ==

Theravada sources contain narratives of a Third council of the Theravara school which occurred during the reign of Ashoka at Pataliputra, emperor Ashoka&#x27;s capital.

According to the Theravāda commentaries and chronicles, the Third Buddhist Council was convened by the Mauryan king Ashoka at Pātaliputra (today&#x27;s Patna), under the leadership of the elder Moggaliputta Tissa. Its objective was to purify the Buddhist movement, particularly from opportunistic factions and heretical non-buddhists (tirthikas) which had only joined because they were attracted by the royal patronage of the sangha. Due to the increased royal support of the sangha, large numbers of faithless, greedy men espousing wrong views tried to join the order improperly and caused many divisions in the sangha. Because of this the third council of one thousand monks were convened, led by Moggaliputtatissa. The emperor himself was in attendance and asked the suspect monks what the Buddha taught. They claimed he taught wrong views such as eternalism, etc., which are condemned in the canonical &quot;Brahmajala Sutta.&quot; He asked the virtuous monks, and they replied that the Buddha was a &quot;Teacher of Analysis&quot; (&quot;Vibhajjavādin&quot;), an answer that was confirmed by Moggaliputta Tissa.

The Theravadins say that council proceeded to recite the scriptures, adding to the canon Moggaliputta Tissa&#x27;s own book, the &quot;Kathavatthu,&quot; a discussion of various dissenting Buddhist views and the &quot;Vibhajjavādin&quot; responses to them. Only Theravadin sources mention this text. According to this account, this third council also seems to have led to the split between the Sarvastivada and the Vibhajjavāda schools on the issue of the existence of the three times (i.e. temporal eternalism). This doctrine seems to have been defended by a certain Katyayaniputra, who is seen as the founder of Sarvastivada. But according to K.L. Dhammajoti, the Sarvastivada lineage and the Vibhajyavāda lineage of Moggaliputta were already present during the time of Emperor Aśoka.

=== The Ashokan missions ===
Theravada sources mention that another function of this council was to send Buddhist missionaries to various countries in order to spread Buddhism. These reached as far as the Hellenistic kingdoms in the West (in particular the neighboring Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and possibly even farther according to the inscriptions left on stone pillars by Ashoka). Missionaries were also sent to South India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia (possibly to neighboring Burma). The fact that the Buddhist sangha was heavily involved in missionary activities across Asia at the time of Ashoka is well supported by the archeological sources, including numerous Indian inscriptions that match the claims of the Theravada sources.

According to the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; (XII, 1st paragraph), the council and Ashoka sent the following missionaries to various regions:

* Elder Majjhantika (Sanskrit: Mahyantika) led the mission to Kashmir and Gandhara
* Elder Mahadeva led the mission to Mahisamandala (Mysore, Karnataka)
* Elder Rakkhita led the mission to Vanavasi (Tamil Nadu)
* The Yona (Greek) elder Dharmaraksita led the mission to Aparantaka (&quot;Western border&quot;, consisting of Northern Gujarat, Kathiawar, Kachch and Sindh).
* Elder Mahadharmaraksita led the mission to Maharattha (Maharashtra)
* Maharakkhita (Maharaksita Thera) led the mission to the country of the Yona (Greeks), which likely refers to Greco-Bactria and maybe the Seleucid realm
* Majjhima Thera led the mission to the Himavant area (northern Nepal, the foothills of the Himalayas)
* Sona Thera and Uttara Thera led missions to Suvannabhumi (somewhere in Southeast Asia, possibly Myanmar or Thailand)
* The elder Mahinda, along with Utthiya, Ittiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala his disciples went to Lankadipa (Sri Lanka)

Some of these missions were very successful, such as the ones which established Buddhism in Afghanistan, Gandhara and Sri Lanka. Gandharan Buddhism, Greco-Buddhism and Sinhalese Buddhism would continue to be major influential traditions for generations after. Regarding the missions to the Mediterranean Hellenistic kingdoms, they seemed to have been less successful. However, some scholars hold that it is possible some Buddhist communities were established for a limited time in Egyptian Alexandria, and this may have been the origin of the so-called Therapeutae sect mentioned by some ancient sources like Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BCE – 50 CE). Religious scholar Ullrich R. Kleinhempel argues that the most likely candidate for the religion of the Therapeutae is indeed Buddhism.

== The two &quot;fourth councils&quot; ==
By the time of the Fourth Buddhist Councils, Buddhism had splintered into different schools in different regions of India. Scholars have also questioned the historicity of these councils. David Snellgrove considers the Theravada account of the Third Council and the Sarvastivada account of the Fourth Council &quot;equally tendentious,&quot; illustrating the uncertain veracity of much of these histories. The Milindapanho, a non-canonical Pali Buddhist text, is a dialogue between King Milinda and Venerable Nagasena from the 2nd century B.C. It remains widely read in Buddhist regions. The Fourth Buddhist Council was held around 100 A.C. in Jalandhara, Punjab. Notable Buddhist philosophers from Punjab include Asanga and Vasubandhu, who wrote many Sanskrit works in the 4th century A.C. Other significant Buddhist teachers from Punjab include Katyayana, Parsva, Vasumitra, and Manortha (1st century A.C.), Kumarlata (3rd century A.C.), and Vinitiprabha and Chandravarma (7th century A.C.).

=== Sinhalese Theravāda Council (Fourth Theravāda Council) ===
The Southern Theravāda school had a Fourth Buddhist Council in the first century BCE in Sri Lanka at Alu Vihāra (Aloka Leṇa) during the time of King Vattagamani-Abhaya also known as Valagamba. According to K. R. Norman there is a major discrepancy between the sources which cite the death of Valagamba of Anuradhapura as occurring in 77 BCE and his supposed patronization of the effort to commit the Buddhist oral traditions to writing in the period 29 to 17 BCE. Norman writes:The Dipavamsa states that during the reign of Valagamba (Vattagamani Abhaya) (29–17 BCE) the monks who had previously remembered the Tipitaka and its commentary orally, wrote them down in books, because of the threat posed by famine and war. The Mahavamsa also refers briefly to the writing down of the canon and the commentaries at this time.Valagamba is also associated with patronizing the site of Abhayagiri, building the stupa there and offering it to Kuppikala Mahatissa thero. This seems to have caused a dispute between Abhayagiri and the monks of the Mahavihara monastery (the ancient Theravada lineage).

Whatever the case, the sources state that a council was held at the cave temple of Alu Vihāra in response to Beminitiya Seya. Because at this time the Pali texts were strictly an oral literature maintained in several recensions by &quot;dhammabhāṇaka&quot;s (dharma reciters), the surviving monks recognized the danger of not writing it down so that even if some of the monks whose duty it was to study and remember parts of the Canon for later generations died, the teachings would not be lost.

=== Kashmiri Sarvāstivāda ===

Another Fourth Buddhist Council was held by the Sarvastivada tradition in the Kushan empire, and is said to have been convened by the Kushan emperor Kanishka I (c. 158–176), in 78 AD at Kundalvana vihara (Kundalban) in Kashmir. The exact location of the vihara is presumed to be around Harwan, near Srinagar. An alternate theory places its location in the Kuvana monastery in Jalandhar, though this is improbable.

The 4th Buddhist Council was convened by Kanishka, troubled by conflicting doctrines among various sects. He advised with the venerable Pársva, who organized a general assembly of theologians in Kundalabana near Srinagar, Kashmir. All 500 members were from the Hináyana School. Vasumitra was elected president, and Asvaghoṣa vice-president. They examined ancient theological literature and created detailed commentaries on the Canon&#x27;s three main divisions. After the council, these commentaries were inscribed on copper sheets and stored in a stupa built by Kanishka. Kanishka then renewed Asoka&#x27;s donation of Kashmir to the church before returning home via the Baramula Pass.

The Fourth Council of Kashmir is not recognized as authoritative for the Theravadins. Reports of this council can be found in scriptures which were kept in the Mahayana tradition. It is said that emperor Kanishka gathered five hundred Bhikkhus in Kashmir, headed by Vasumitra, to systematize the Sarvastivadin canon, which were translated from earlier Prakrit vernacular languages (such as Gandhari) into Sanskrit. It is said that during the council three hundred thousand verses and over nine million statements were compiled, a process which took twelve years to complete. Sarvastivada sources also claim that the encyclopedic &quot;Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra (&quot;Great Abhidharma Commentary&quot;)&quot; dates to the time of Kanishka. This massive text became the central text of the Vaibhāṣika tradition in Kashmir. Although the Sarvastivada are no longer extant as an independent school, its Abhidharma tradition were inherited by the Mahayana tradition. 

The new Vaibhāṣika texts were not accepted by all Sarvāstivādins. Some &quot;Western masters&quot; from Gandhara and Bactria had divergent views which disagreed with the new orthodoxy. These disagreements from the &quot;Sautrantikas&quot; can be seen in later works, such as the *&quot;Tattvasiddhi-Śāstra&quot; (成實論), the *&quot;Abhidharmahṛday&quot;a (T no. 1550), and the &quot;Abhidharmakośakārikā&quot; of Vasubandhu.

== Theravada Councils in Myanmar ==

=== Fifth Burmese Council (1871)===
Another Buddhist Council, this time presided by Theravada monks, took place in Mandalay, Burma, in 1871 in the reign of King Mindon. In the Burmese tradition, it is commonly known as the &quot;Fifth Council&quot;. The chief objective of this meeting was to recite all the teachings of the Buddha and examine them in minute detail to see if any of them had been altered, distorted or dropped.

It was presided over by three Elders, the Venerable Mahathera Jagarabhivamsa, the Venerable Narindabhidhaja, and the Venerable Mahathera Sumangalasami in the company of some two thousand four hundred monks (2,400). Their joint Dhamma recitation lasted for five months. It was also the work of this council to approve the entire Tripitaka inscribed for posterity on seven hundred and twenty-nine marble slabs in the Burmese script before its recitation. This monumental task was done by the monks and many skilled craftsmen who upon completion of each slab had them housed in beautiful miniature &#x27;pitaka&#x27; pagodas on a special site in the grounds of King Mindon&#x27;s Kuthodaw Pagoda at the foot of Mandalay Hill where it and the so-called &#x27;largest book in the world&#x27;, stands to this day. This council is not generally recognized outside Burma.

=== Sixth Burmese Council (1954) ===

The Sixth Council was called at Kaba Aye in Yangon (formerly Rangoon) in 1954, 83 years after the fifth one was held in Mandalay. It was sponsored by the Burmese Government led by the then Prime Minister, the Honourable U Nu. He authorized the construction of the Maha Passana Guha, the &quot;great cave&quot;, an artificial cave very much like India&#x27;s Sattapanni Cave where the first Buddhist Council had been held. Upon its completion The Council met on 17 May 1954.

As in the case of the preceding councils, its first objective was to affirm and preserve the genuine Dhamma and Vinaya. However it was unique insofar as the monks who took part in it came from eight countries. These two thousand five hundred learned Theravada monks came from Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal. Germany can only be counted as the nationality of the only two western monks in attendance: Venerable Nyanatiloka Mahathera and Venerable Nyanaponika Thera. They both were invited from Sri Lanka. The late Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw was appointed the noble task of asking the required questions about the Dhamma of the Venerable Bhadanta Vicittasarabhivamsa who answered all of them learnedly and satisfactorily. By the time this council met, all the participating countries had had the Pali Tripiṭaka rendered into their native scripts, with the exception of India.

The traditional recitation of the Buddhist Scriptures took two years, and the Tripiṭaka and its allied literature in all the scripts were painstakingly examined and their differences noted down and the necessary corrections made and all the versions were then collated. It was found that there was not much difference in the content of any of the texts. Finally, after the council had officially approved them, all of the books of the Tipitaka and their commentaries were prepared for printing on modern presses and published in the Burmese script. This notable achievement was made possible through the dedicated efforts of the two thousand five hundred monks and numerous lay people. Their work came to an end on the evening of Vesak, 24 May 1956, exactly two and a half millennia after Buddha&#x27;s Parinibbana, according to the traditional Theravada dating.

== Theravada Councils in the Thai tradition ==
The Thai Theravada tradition has a different way of counting the history of Buddhist councils and names many other councils besides the ones listed above. A common Thai historical source for the early councils is the &quot;Saṅgītiyavaṁsa&quot; (c. 1789) by Somdet Wannarat, abbot of Wat Pho.

The first three councils are the traditional councils in India (1. Rājagaha, 2. Vesālī, 3. Patāliputta).

The fourth council is seen by the Thai tradition of Buddhist history as having taken place under the reign of King Devānampiyatissa (247–207 BCE), when Buddhism was first brought to Sri Lanka. It was supposed to have been held under the presidency of the Venerable Ariṭṭha, the first pupil of the Elder Mahinda. This is not usually counted as a council in other traditions, but the &quot;Samantapāsādikā&quot; does mention a recital at this time.

The fifth council is that of King Vattagāmanī Abhaya, when the Pali Canon was first put into writing in Sri Lanka in the first century BCE at Āluvihāra under the presidency of Mahātthera Rakkhita.

The sixth council, according to the &quot;Saṅgītiyavaṁsa&quot;, comprises the activities of the Pāli translation of the Sinhalese commentaries, a project that was led by Ācariya Buddhaghosa and involved numerous bhikkhus of the Sri Lankan Mahavihara tradition.

The seventh council is believed to have taken place during the time of the Sri Lankan king Parākkamabāhu I and presided over by Kassapa Thera in 1176. During this council the Atthavaṇ­ṇ­a­nā was written, which explains the Pāli translation by Buddhaghosa of the original Sinhalese commentaries. Parākkamabāhu also unified the Sri Lankan sangha into one single Theravada community.

=== Councils held in Thailand ===
From this point onwards, the Thai tradition focuses on councils held in Thailand which were patronized by the Thai monarchy.

The first of these was held in the Mahā­b­o­dhārāma at Chiang Mai, which was attended by several monks. The Mahāthera Dhammadinnā of Tālavana Mahāvihāra (Wat Pā Tān) presided over the council, which was patronized by the King of Lan Na, Tilokaraj (r. 1441–1487). During this council, the orthography of the Thai Pali Canon was corrected and it was rendered into the Lan Na script. This council was held in 1477 CE.

A second Thai council was held in Bangkok from November 13, 1788, to April 10, 1789, under the aegis of King Rāma I and his brother. It was attended by 250 monks and scholars. A new edition of the Pali Canon was published, the &quot;Tipitaka Chabab Tongyai.&quot;

The third Thai council was held in 1878 during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). During this council, the Thai script was used to make copies of the Pali Canon (instead of a modified Khmer script) and the canon was published in modern book form for the first time.

The next Thai council was held in Bangkok during the reign of Rama VII (1925–1935). This council saw a new edition of the Pali Canon published in the Thai script which was distributed throughout the country.

<text>&quot;99 Luftballons&quot; (, &quot;99 balloons&quot;) is a song by the West German band Nena from their 1983 self-titled album. An English-language version titled &quot;99 Red Balloons&quot; (), with lyrics by Kevin McAlea, was also released by Nena on the album &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; in 1984 after widespread success of the original in Europe and Japan. The English version is not a direct translation of the German original and contains lyrics with a somewhat different meaning. In the US, the English-language version did not chart, while the German-language recording became Nena&#x27;s only US hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Lyrics==
While at a June 1982 concert by the Rolling Stones in West Berlin, Nena&#x27;s guitarist Carlo Karges noticed that balloons were being released. He watched them move toward the horizon, shifting and changing shapes like strange spacecraft (referred to in the German lyrics as a &quot;UFO&quot;). He thought about what might happen if they floated over the Berlin Wall to East Berlin.

Also cited by the band was a 1973 newspaper article from the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; about five high school students who played a prank to simulate a UFO by launching 99 (one was lost from the original 100) aluminized Mylar balloons attached with ribbons to a traffic flare. The red flame from the flare reflected by the balloons gave the appearance of a large pulsating red object floating over Red Rock Canyon outside the Las Vegas Valley in Nevada.

A direct translation of the title is sometimes given as &quot;Ninety-Nine Air Balloons&quot;, but the song became known in English as &quot;Ninety-Nine Red Balloons&quot;.

The lyrics of the original German version tell a story: 99 balloons are mistaken for UFOs, causing a military general to send pilots to investigate. Finding nothing but balloons, the pilots put on a large show of firepower. The display of force worries the nations along the borders and the defense ministers on each side encourage conflict to grab power for themselves. In the end, a cataclysmic war results from the otherwise harmless flight of balloons and causes devastation on all sides without a victor, as indicated in the denouement of the song: &quot;,&quot; which means &quot;99 years of war left no room for victors.&quot; The anti-war song finishes with the singer walking through the devastated ruins of the world and finding a single balloon. The description of what happens in the final line of the piece is the same in German and English: &quot;,&quot; or &quot;Think of you and let it go.&quot;

==English version and other re-recordings==
The English version retains the spirit of the original narrative, but many of the lyrics are translated poetically rather than being directly translated: red helium balloons are casually released by the civilian singer (narrator) with her unnamed friend into the sky and are mistakenly registered by a faulty early warning system as enemy contacts, resulting in panic and eventually nuclear war, with the end of the song near-identical to the end of the original German version.

From the outset, Nena (the lead singer) and other members of the band expressed disapproval of the English version of the song, &quot;99 Red Balloons&quot;. In March 1984, the band&#x27;s keyboardist and song co-writer Uwe Fahrenkrog Petersen said, &quot;We made a mistake there. I think the song loses something in translation and even sounds silly.&quot; In another interview that month, the band, including Nena herself, were quoted as being &quot;not completely satisfied&quot; with the English version, since it was &quot;too blatant&quot; for a group not wishing to be seen as a protest band.

Two re-recordings of the original German version of the song have been released by Nena the singer: a modern ballad version, which was included on &quot;Nena feat. Nena&quot; (2002), and a 2009 retro version, which originally aired as an animated video on the European Arte channel (as part of a special called &quot;Summer of the &#x27;80s&quot;) and included some portions in French (specifically, the second part of the first verse and the entire final verse). Nena later formally released this rendition on her 2010 &quot;Best of Nena&quot; compilation, but the French text was omitted and replaced with the original German lyrics.

Live recordings of the song are included on all seven of Nena&#x27;s live albums, dating from 1995 to 2018.

==Reception==
American and Australian audiences preferred the original German version, which became a very successful non-English-language song, topping charts in both countries, reaching number one on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; chart, Kent Music Report, and number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, behind &quot;Jump&quot; by Van Halen. It was certified gold by the RIAA. The later-released English translation, &quot;99 Red Balloons&quot;, topped the charts in Canada and on the UK singles chart and Irish Singles Chart.

In his 2010 book &quot;&quot;, critic and musician Scott Miller declared that the song possesses &quot;one of the best hooks of the &#x27;80s&quot; and listed it among his top song picks for 1984. Nonetheless, he cautioned: &quot;It must be admitted that this song suffers from an embarrassingly out-of-place disco funk interlude, and the word &quot;Kriegsminister&quot;.&quot;

==Music video==
The promotional video, which was originally made for the Dutch music programme &quot;TopPop&quot; and broadcast on 13 March 1983, was shot in a Dutch military training camp, the band performing the song on a stage in front of a backdrop of fires and explosions provided by the Dutch Army. Towards the end of the video, the band are seen taking cover and abandoning the stage, which was unplanned and genuine since they believed the explosive blasts were getting out of control.

VH1 Classic, an American cable television station, ran a charity event for Hurricane Katrina relief in 2006. Viewers who made donations were allowed to choose which music videos the station would play. One viewer donated $35,000 for the right to program an entire hour and requested continuous play of &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; and &quot;99 Red Balloons&quot; videos. The station broadcast the videos as requested on 26 March 2006.

<text>Sophie Calle (; born 9 October 1953) is a French writer, photographer, installation artist, and conceptual artist. Daughter of the contemporary art collector Robert Calle, Calle&#x27;s work is distinguished by its use of arbitrary sets of constraints, and evokes the French literary movement known as Oulipo. Her work frequently depicts human vulnerability, and examines identity and intimacy. She is recognized for her detective-like tendency to follow strangers and investigate their private lives. Her photographic work often includes panels of text of her own writing.

Since 2005, Calle has taught as a professor of film and photography at European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. She has lectured at the University of California, San Diego in the Visual Arts Department. She has also taught at Mills College in Oakland, California.

Exhibitions of Calle&#x27;s work took place at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia; Musée d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire du Judaïsme, Paris; Paula Cooper Gallery, New York; Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, Belgium; Videobrasil, SESC Pompeia, São Paulo, Brazil; Museum of Modern Art of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil; Whitechapel Gallery, London; , the De Pont Museum of Contemporary Art, Tilburg, Netherlands;, and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.

She represented France at the Venice Biennale in 2007.

In 2017 she was shortlisted for the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize for her publication &quot;My All&quot; (Actes Sud, 2016). In 2019 she was the recipient of the Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Centenary Medal and Honorary Fellowship.

== Works ==
=== 1979–1981 ===
In &quot;Suite Venitienne&quot; (1979), Calle followed a man she met at a party in Paris to Venice, where she disguised herself and followed him around the city, photographing him. Calle&#x27;s surveillance of the man, who she identifies only as Henri B., includes black and white photographs accompanied by text.

Calle&#x27;s first artistic work was &quot;The Sleepers &quot;(&quot;Les Dormeurs&quot;), a project in which she invited passers-by to occupy her bed. Some were friends, or friends of friends, and some were strangers to her. She served them food and photographed them every hour.

In order to execute her project &quot;The Hotel&quot; (1981), she was hired as a chambermaid at a hotel in Venice where she was able to explore the writings and objects of the hotel guests. Insight into her process and its resulting aesthetic can be gained through her account of this project: &quot;I spent one year to find the hotel, I spent three months going through the text and writing it, I spent three months going through the photographs, and I spent one day deciding it would be this size and this frame...it&#x27;s the last thought in the process.&quot;

=== Mid- and late 1980s ===
One of Calle&#x27;s first projects to generate public controversy was &quot;Address Book&quot; (1983). The French daily newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; invited her to publish a series of 28 articles. Having recently found an address book on the street (which she photocopied and returned to its owner), she decided to call some of the telephone numbers in the book and speak with the people about its owner. To the transcripts of these conversations, Calle added photographs of the man&#x27;s favorite activities, creating a portrait of a man she never met, by way of his acquaintances. The articles were published, but upon discovering them, the owner of the address book, a documentary filmmaker named Pierre Baudry, threatened to sue the artist for invasion of privacy. As Calle reports, the owner discovered a nude photograph of her, and demanded the newspaper publish it, in retaliation for what he perceived to be an unwelcome intrusion into his private life.

Another of Calle&#x27;s noteworthy projects is titled &quot;The Blind&quot; (1986), for which she interviewed blind people, and asked them to define beauty. Their responses were accompanied by her photographic interpretation of their ideas of beauty, and portraits of the interviewees.

Calle has created elaborate display cases of birthday presents given to her throughout her life; this process was detailed by Grégoire Bouillier in his memoir &quot;The Mystery Guest: An Account&quot; (2006). According to Bouillier, the premise of his story was that &quot;A woman who has left a man without saying why calls him years later and asks him to be the &#x27;mystery guest&#x27; at a birthday party thrown by the artist Sophie Calle. And by the end of this fashionable—and utterly humiliating—party, the narrator figures out the secret of their breakup.&quot;

=== 1990s ===
In 1996, Calle asked Israelis and Palestinians from Jerusalem to take her to public places that became part of their private sphere, exploring how one&#x27;s personal story can create an intimacy with a place. Inspired by the eruv, the Jewish law that permits to turn a public space into a private area by surrounding it with wires, making it possible to carry objects during the Sabbath, the &quot;&quot; is exhibited at Paris&#x27;s Musée d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire du Judaïsme.

The same year, Calle released a film titled &quot;No Sex Last Night&quot; which she created in collaboration with American photographer Gregory Shephard. The film documents their road trip across America, which ends in a wedding chapel in Las Vegas. Rather than following the genre conventions of a road trip or a romance, the film is designed to document the result of a man and woman who barely knew each other, embarking on an intimate journey together.

Calle asked writer and filmmaker Paul Auster to &quot;invent a fictive character which I would attempt to resemble&quot; and served as the model for the character Maria in Auster&#x27;s 1992 novel &quot;Leviathan&quot;. This mingling of fact and fiction so intrigued Calle that she created the works of art created by the fictional character, which included a series of color-coordinated meals. These works are documented in her publication &quot;Double Game&quot; (1999).

Auster later challenged Calle to create and maintain a public amenity in New York City. The artist&#x27;s response was to augment a telephone booth on the corner of Greenwich and Harrison Streets in Manhattan with a note pad, a bottle of water, a pack of cigarettes, flowers, cash, and sundry other items. Every day, Calle cleaned the booth and restocked the items, until the telephone company removed and discarded them. This project is documented in &quot;The Gotham Handbook&quot; (1998).

In 1999 Calle exhibited the installation &quot;Appointment&quot; especially conceived for the Freud Museum in London, working with the ideas of her private desires. In &quot;Room with a View&quot; (2002), Calle spent the night in a bed installed at the top of the Eiffel Tower. She invited people to come to her and read her bedtime stories in order to keep her awake through the night. The same year, Calle had her first one-woman show, a retrospective, at the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne at Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.

=== 2000s ===
&quot;Douleur Exquise&quot; (exquisite pain) was commissioned in 2003. She reluctantly chose to spend three months in Japan, deciding to make the journey take a month by taking the train through Moscow and through Siberia, then through Beijing, then to Hong Kong. She was supposed to meet her lover in New Delhi, but he didn&#x27;t turn up, instead sending her a telegram which said he was in an accident and couldn&#x27;t come. She found out that he only had an infected finger, a felon, and that he had actually found another woman. She took a photograph every day until the day they were supposed to meet in New Delhi, and wrote about how much she looked forward to meeting him. The second half of the book was all about the pain of the heartbreak. She would write about the horrible memory of the conversation where she realized he was breaking up with her on one page, and ask people to tell her their worst memory, which was placed on the right. Over the days, her story became shorter and shorter as her pain dissipated over the time. The juxtaposition of everyone&#x27;s terrible memories also played down the pain of a simple breakup.

Calle&#x27;s text &quot;Exquisite Pain&quot; was adapted into a performance in 2004 by Forced Entertainment, a theatrical company based in Sheffield, England.

At the 2007 Venice Biennale, Calle showed her piece &quot;Take Care of Yourself&quot;, named after the last line of the email her ex sent her. Calle asked friends, acquaintances, and recommended women of all ages—including a parrot and a hand puppet—to interpret the break-up e-mail and presented the results in the French pavilion. Calle explains the piece as follows: &quot;I received an email telling me it was over. I didn&#x27;t know how to respond. It was almost as if it hadn&#x27;t been meant for me. It ended with the words, &#x27;take care of yourself.&#x27; And so I did. I asked 107 women, chosen for their profession or skills, to interpret this letter. To analyze it, comment on it, dance it, sing it. Exhaust it. Understand it for me. Answer for me. It was a way of taking the time to break up. A way of taking care of myself.&quot; Jessica Lott, winner of the Frieze Writer&#x27;s Prize for her review of the piece, described it thus: &quot;Take Care of Yourself is a break-up letter (Calle&#x27;s) then-boyfriend (Grégoire Bouillier, dubbed ‘X’) sent her via e-mail. Calle took the e-mail, and the paralyzing confusion that accompanies the mind&#x27;s failure to comprehend heartbreak, and distributed it to 107 women of various professions, skills and talents to help her understand it – to interpret, analyze, examine and perform it to gain perspective on her perplexing situation. Calle insists that she did not need the other women&#x27;s sentiments for herself, but to ensure that the piece was well-rounded. The result of this seemingly obsessive, schoolyard exercise is paradoxically one of the most expansive and telling pieces of art on women and contemporary feminism to pass through (the major art centres) in recent years&quot;. At her gallery shows, Calle frequently supplies suggestion forms on which visitors are encouraged to furnish ideas for her art, while she sits beside them with an uninterested expression.

In 2009/2010, a major retrospective exhibition of her work, including &quot;Take Care of Yourself,&quot; &quot;The Sleepers,&quot; &quot;Address Book&quot; and others, was held opened at the Whitechapel Gallery in London. In 2010 another major exhibition opened in Denmark at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art.

=== 2010s ===
In 2011 her work &quot;True Stories&quot; was installed at the historic 1850 House at the Pontalba Building at Jackson Square in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana as part of the Prospect 2 Contemporary Art Festival. The house, an historic museum that is managed as part of the Louisiana State Museum, is furnished with historic furniture as it was in the mid-19th century. The artist inserted her own, personal historical objects and ephemera, with short, narrative explanatory text, into the scenes, affecting the notion that she had occupied the house shortly before the viewers&#x27; arrival.

In 2012, Calle&#x27;s &quot;The Address Book&quot; was published for the first time in its entirety. In 2015, &quot;Suite Vénitienne&quot; was redesigned and republished.

In 2014, Calle&#x27;s work &quot;Rachel, Monique&quot; was displayed at the Episcopal Church of Heavenly Rest in New York City. It involved video Calle took of her mother, Monique Sindler, on her deathbed, as well as excerpts of her diary, read by actress Kim Cattrall. Calle took her mother&#x27;s portrait and jewelry and buried them at the North Pole. Portraits of her doing so were also on exhibition. In 2017, Calle was commissioned to create a public artwork for Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, &quot;Here Lie the Secrets of the Visitors of Green-Wood Cemetery.&quot; The piece will remain in the cemetery for 25 years. In 2017–2018, Calle had a public art installation at Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature (the Museum of Hunting and Nature) in Paris.

=== 2020s ===
Calle&#x27;s work was featured in a site-specific installation occupying four floors in the Musée Picasso in 2023. Another retrospective, called &quot;Sophie Calle: Overshare&quot;, opened in 2024 at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis with plans to travel to the Orange County Museum of Art.
The Minneapolis exhibit debuted Calle’s project “On the Hunt”, which quotes dating ads from a French hunting magazine from 1895 to 2019, during which the men’s concerns shifted from the virginity of their prospective partners to their physical appearance. Alongside these quotes are images of hunted animals and hunting towers.

== Critical analysis ==
Christine Macel described Calle&#x27;s work as a rejection of the Poststructuralist notion of the &quot;death of the author&quot; by working as a &quot;first-person artist&quot; who incorporates her life into her works and, in a way, redefines the idea of the author.

Angelique Chrisafis, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, called her &quot;the Marcel Duchamp of emotional dirty laundry&quot;. She was among the names in Blake Gopnik&#x27;s 2011 list &quot;The 10 Most Important Artists of Today&quot;, with Gopnik arguing, &quot;It is the unartiness of Calle&#x27;s work—its refusal to fit any of the standard pigeonholes, or over anyone&#x27;s sofa—that makes it deserve space in museums.&quot;

In 2024, curator Henriette Huldisch noted that Calle&#x27;s work devised scenarios relevant to how people &quot;perform themselves in our current social media landscape&quot;, asking rhetorically, &quot;Is she the original oversharer?&quot;

<doc id="884220" wikidata="Q7409992" url="?curid=884220" title="Samodiva (folklore)">
<text>The samodiva (; plural: samodivi, ), samovila (; plural: samovili, ) or [[Vila (fairy)|vila]] (; plural: vili, ), are woodland fairies or nymphs found in South and West Slavic folklore.

==Etymology==
One of the hypotheses of the etymology of the word is that it comes from the Indo-European root *&quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;follow&#x27;, &#x27;chase&#x27;, or &#x27;blow&#x27;, for . The component has a function to highlight.

The origin of is uncertain. The main hypothesis is that there are traces of *&quot;&quot;, &#x27;god&#x27;.

==Appearance==
Samodivas are commonly depicted as ethereal maidens with long, loose hair, and in some cases, wings. They are typically dressed in free-flowing, feathered white gowns, which give them the power of flight. Samodivas are often described as having blonde or red hair, tall, slender women with pale, glowing skin and fiery eyes.

Sometimes, they are described as having a veil which could hold all their power. If they get deprived of their veil, they lose all their power.

==Habitat==
According to Bulgarian folklore, Samodivas can live inside trees or abandoned shacks or dark caves, or near rivers, ponds and wells. Mountains linked to the Samodivas include Vitosha, Belasitsa, Pirin, Rila, the Rhodopes, the Balkan Mountains in Bulgaria and Rudina mountains. However, mountain Pirin is their traditional favorite. Samodivas enter the human world during the spring, staying until autumn. During the winter, they live in the mythical village of Zmejkovo.

In Bulgarian folklore, they are associated with places related to water - wells, rivers, lakes. Thus, there are landmarks in Bulgaria that have the word &quot;samodiva&quot; or &quot;samovila&quot; in them. An example of that are the Samodivski Lakes in the Pirin Mountain. Specifically, they live under large old trees, in abandoned sheds or in dark caves that are near water sources.

In Macedonian folklore they are also said to inhabit trees like oak, willows and that they live in a far off village called Patelevo.

== Place in folklore ==

Samodivas have the power to bring about drought, burn a farmer&#x27;s crops, or make cattle die of high fever.

=== Bulgarian folklore ===
In Bulgarian folklore, Samodivas occur as the personified form of nature. They are protectors of nature and are often juxtaposed with the ways humans live their lives.

They are knowledgeable about herbs and plants, so they are associated with many plants with medicinal qualities. Some plants that are commonly associated with samodivas are &quot;Euonymus alatus&quot;, &quot;Gentiana Alba&quot;, and other herbs. There are many local beliefs about those plants and their qualities that are associated with the samodivas. For example, there is a belief that Еuonymus Alatus should be picked only on the eve of Ascension Day because the samodivas are more friendly and their healing powers are stronger.

Another important aspect of the figure of the Samodivas is their love for singing and dancing. They often engage in competitions with each other and with humans, and whoever wins gets to keep the loser for themselves. An example of this is the plot of Dimo the Caval player and Gyurgya Samodiva where the samodiva loses the musical battle and Dimo takes her to his village.

In certain parts of Bulgaria, samodivas are said to be related to various inexplicable natural events like chronic illnesses and whirlwinds. An exаmple of this is the folk song Samodiva Kidnaps a Musician This is a remnant from pre-Christian belief systems on the Balkans, similarly to the Ancient Greek mythology&#x27;s explanation of Nereids dancing in the winds.

=== Macedonian folklore ===
In Macedonian folklore, Samovilas are often seen that they have the ability to hurt people or to heal them. There is a way to kill a Samovila, and that is by making her prick herself on thorn bushes and evaporates. It is also known that they could enter the hearts of men and stay there for 5 years. Their goal was to join with the man&#x27;s soul and after go to heaven together. They usually gave the man magical powers and knowledge of healing plants. In North Macedonia, there are tales speaking of Samovilski Weddings, and if a random person was found walking by, they would offer him wine and in return he would give a golden coin to the bride. The wedding would then last all night until dawn.

It is also known that they can be seen by dogs with four eyes and mixed Samovilski children.

Their voices were hypnotic and could drive a man to go crazy. The Macedonian people feared of calling them by their name Vili, so sometimes they would speak of them as Mayki, Yudi, They.

Balkan mythology holds that Samodivas were the daughters of Lamia. This, combined with their mostly nocturnal nature, leads to them being considered negative, or at best neutral in their nature.

Much like the Vila in Slavic folklore, a Samodiva&#x27;s power is believed to come mostly from her long (usually blond) hair. A Samodiva would sometimes give a small portion of it to her lover to strengthen her control over him via its magical effects. However, if her hair is damaged in some way, she will either disappear entirely or be stripped of her powers and beauty.

==History==
In Bulgaria, the current understanding of Samodivas currently stems from collections of folk tales and folk songs. Many of those were compiled in the 19th century, as part of the Revival efforts of Bulgarian intellectuals. The secondary literature on the topic of Samodiva is very limited. The folklore that has been collected and stored reflects only a fraction of the complex understanding that the character of the Samodiva entails, since the folktales have gone through numerous sieves, both during the writing stages of the folklore collections, and later on, as a result of the regime and ideology shifts of the Balkan Peninsula (See People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, Yugoslavia).

Earliest written evidence of Samodivas dates back to the 13th century, where they presumably developed from Balkan traditions and myths. Researchers have also found influences from other Slavic folklore. It is widely believed that the image of the Samodiva and their behavior is actually based on ancient Thracian legends, especially those connected to the Cult of Orpheus, which included songs and dances performed by fire-priestesses.

== Prominent Samodivas in folklore ==

* Vila - Some folk tales describe Vila Samodiva as the Samodiva maiden who leads the others in their dances. She is described as the active participant of the contact between the protagonist of folktales and the mystical world, serving as a guide or giving the hero a task to test his valour and resolve. In one folk tale, Vila found Krali Marko as an infant and brought him up as a foster mother. As Marko grew on Samodiva milk, he acquired supernatural powers. The character of the Vila is attested in South Slavic fairy tales collected by Friedrich Salomon Krauss.
* Vida - Some stories say that she is the sister of Krali Marko, some stories describe her as a destructive force of nature. In &quot;Krali Marko and Vida Samovila&quot;, he encounters her and kills her in conflict. In another tale, she is responsible for the water shortage in the region because she locked up the twelve springs. 
* Gyurgya - One of Gyurgya&#x27;s appearances in Bulgarian Folklore is when she is enticed by a shepherd and ends up becoming his wife .

== Appearances in other literature ==

* In the 19th century, Bulgarian poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev mentioned Samodivas in a poem praising the late Voivoda Hadzhi Dimitar. The Samodivas provide comfort to the dying man in the last moments of his life, symbolizing bravery. They also appear to symbolize the union between him and the land he sacrificed himself to protect. Still, the Samodivas and the reaction of Hadzhi Dimitar to their presence is connected to the mischievous and seductive role they often play in mythology.
* Elin Pelin - &quot;Samodiva&quot;

==Samodiva as supernatural wife==
A Bulgarian folk song (&quot;The Samodiva married against her will&quot;) features a Samodiva: three girls, not related to each other, doff their magical garments to bathe, but are seen by a shepherd that takes their clothing. Each girl separately try to plead and convince the youth to return the clothing. He does so - but only to the first two; the third maiden he chose to wed after she revealed she was an only child. After the wedding, the village insists she dances for the amusement of everyone else, but the samodiva says she cannot dance without her garment. Once her husband delivers her the clothing, she flies away.

In the fairy tale &quot;The Youth and the Vila&quot;, the youngest son, who is considered a fool by his two elder brothers, manages to pluck the golden hairs of a vila who has been eating the silver pears of his father&#x27;s garden. He later takes her back to his father&#x27;s house.

In a second tale, &quot;The Vila in the Golden Castle&quot;, a father asks his three sons to guard his flower garden at night, because swans have been eating the flowers (in reality, the vilas were). The vila returns home to the golden castle, which prompts the youth to seek her. There, an old vila, the girl&#x27;s mother, sets tasks for him to perform.

<text>Tareq Ayyoub (, also Romanized &quot;Tareq Ayoub&quot;, &quot;Tariq Ayoub&quot;, &quot;Tarek Ayoub&quot;, &quot;Tarik Ayub&quot;, 1968 – 8 April 2003) was an Arab television reporter of Palestinian nationality, employed by Al Jazeera, and previously by Fox News. Ayyoub was killed in 2003 when two missiles, fired from by an American ground-attack aircraft, struck the Baghdad headquarters of the Al Jazeera Satellite Channel during the 2003 US-led Invasion of Iraq. The Al Jazeera station was clearly marked as a media centre, and the US military had been informed of its location in February.

==Biography==
Born in Kuwait in 1968, Ayyoub received his Masters in English from Calicut University. Beginning in 1998, he covered the domestic and international politics of Jordan for the English-language &quot;Jordan Times&quot;.

==Death==

On the morning of 8 April 2003, Ayyoub, along with his second cameraman, an Iraqi named Zuheir, was covering a pitched battle between the American and Iraqi troops from the roof of Al-Jazeera&#x27;s Baghdad office. At approximately 7:45 a.m., an American A-10 Warthog ground-attack aircraft turned toward Al-Jazeera&#x27;s office and began to descend upon it. Maher Abdullah, the station&#x27;s Baghdad correspondent, witnessed the A-10&#x27;s attack run and gave the following description, &quot;The plane was flying so low that those of us downstairs thought it would land – that&#x27;s how close it was. We actually heard the rocket being launched. It was a direct hit – the missile actually exploded against our electrical generator, and Tareq died almost at once, Zuheir was injured.&quot;

==Context==
On the same day, the Abu Dhabi satellite station was hit by &#x27;Army Fire&#x27; in a different section of Baghdad, and an American tank fired shells at Palestine Hotel, killing journalists Taras Protsyuk of &quot;Reuters&quot; and Jose Couso of the Spanish television station, Telecinco.

==Reaction==
The United States claimed later that day that the death had been an accident, and that hostile fire had been seen originating from the Al Jazeera headquarters.

<text>The Driver and Mechanic Badge is a military special skill badge of the United States Army which was first created in July 1942. The badge is awarded to drivers, mechanics, and special equipment operators to denote the attainment of a high degree of skill in the operation and maintenance of motor vehicles. The badge was originally referred to as the “Motor Vehicle Badge” and adopted its current title of Driver and Mechanic Badge during the Korean War.

The Driver and Mechanic Badge is awarded to soldiers who have received training and have met specific qualification standards to operate or repair military motor vehicles. For example, the Driver and Mechanic Badge for wheeled vehicles requires successful completion of military vehicle operations and maintenance training and be assigned duties and responsibilities as a driver or assistant driver of government vehicles for a minimum of 12 consecutive months or have driven at least 8,000 miles with no vehicle accidents or traffic violations before one can be awarded the badge. 

The badge is issued with a number of metal bars, suspended beneath the decoration, which denote the qualification received. The current bars which are issued to the Driver and Mechanic Badge are as follows:
* DRIVER - A (for amphibious vehicles)
* DRIVER - M (for motorcycles)
* DRIVER - T (for tracked vehicles)
* DRIVER - W (for wheeled vehicles)
* MECHANIC (for automotive or allied vehicles)
* OPERATOR - S (for special mechanical equipment)
From November 1962 to January 1966, the U.S. Army awarded this badge to Army aviation mechanics and crew chiefs. To distinguish them from other Driver and Mechanic Badges, aviation mechanics had a two-bladed propeller bar that hung suspended beneath the badge, just like the driver bars. Crew chiefs hung two metal bars from the badge, one with &quot;Crew Chief&quot; embossed on a bar followed by the propeller bar. The Driver and Mechanic Badge-Aviation Mechanic and Driver and Mechanic Badge-Crew Chief were replaced by the Army Aircrewman Badge, now known as the Army Aviation Badge.

The Driver and Mechanic Badge is a permanently awarded skill badge and is worn suspended beneath a service member’s standard decorations and to the wearer&#x27;s right of any Weapons Qualification Badges.

<text>The Awful Truth (1999–2000) is a satirical television show that was directed, written, and hosted by filmmaker Michael Moore, and funded by the British broadcaster Channel 4.

==Format==
The show emulated television newsmagazine shows (such as &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, or Moore&#x27;s own previous show, &quot;TV Nation&quot;) in that it comprised a series of documentary segments. For the first season the format involved presenting them to a studio audience (the second season moved to Times Square), often accompanied by a coda and commentary by Moore as to what happened after the segment was first filmed. The show focused on exposing problems in American government, business, and society. It often used outlandish sketches and stunts to point out the inherent absurdity of a situation and hint at potential solutions. At times, the show&#x27;s sometimes humiliating tactics drew enough attention to cause corporations involved to rethink their policies. For example, after initially denying a man coverage for a pancreas transplant, Humana agreed to pay for it.

==Episodes==
===Season 1 (1999)===
===Season 2 (2000)===
==Notable scenes==
* After legislation to display the Ten Commandments in public schools, Moore interviews the bill&#x27;s co-signers and asks them what the eighth commandment is; most cannot answer the question correctly. Dave Weldon does suggest &quot;thou shalt not steal,&quot; which is correct for most Protestants, but Michael was using the Roman Catholic/Lutheran list, as he is Catholic. (Moore was looking for &quot;thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor&quot;.)
* Moore creates an &quot;African American Wallet Exchange&quot; in Harlem, in response to four NYPD officers who fired on and killed Amadou Diallo, because they thought his wallet was a gun. Once all the wallets are exchanged, Moore deposited them in front of the NYPD headquarters.
* Staging a mock funeral outside of Humana&#x27;s corporate headquarters when a health care policyholder is denied a claim to fund a potentially life-saving pancreas transplant. This segment became the inspiration for Moore&#x27;s sixth feature film, &quot;Sicko&quot;, released by The Weinstein Company on 29 June 2007. Moore&#x27;s original plan for &quot;Sicko&quot; was to stage ten &#x27;stunts&#x27; like the mock funeral in front of health-care agencies, but eventually decided to scrap the idea.
* A group clad in Colonial clothing behaving in a manner reminiscent of the Salem Witch Trials in protest of Kenneth Starr, and his tactics during President Bill Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial, with the idea that colonials know how to conduct an economical witch trial. They also read parts of Starr&#x27;s report on Clinton while Starr was head of the Office of the Independent Counsel, and also highlight certain high-profile politicians own &#x27;anti-moralistic&#x27; behavior (in particular Newt Gingrich&#x27;s affair and subsequent divorce).
* Crackers the Corporate Crime Fighting Chicken (a character first introduced in &quot;TV Nation&quot;), played by producer Gideon Evans traveling to Disney World to confront Mickey Mouse about unfair labor practices.
* The Iowa Caucuses Mosh Pit, in which Alan Keyes dived onto a portable mosh pit and crowd-surfed to Rage Against the Machine to win the endorsement of &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; for the 2000 presidential election.
* The Sodomobile, a pink van loaded with homosexual men and women, traveling across the country to U.S. states that have on-the-books sodomy laws, to fight for gay rights. At one point they encounter Pastor Fred Phelps, infamous for picketing during funerals of homosexual men.
* An election special where a Ficus tree was run against the otherwise unopposed Republican incumbent Rodney Frelinghuysen for a seat in Congress. In total 23 plants ran as write-in candidates for House seats. The Ficus write-in votes were later refused to be counted by the election committee, but the ones that were showed the Ficus having a 4-1 lead over Frelinghuysen.
* A visit to Philip Morris (now Altria) headquarters, where a group of lung and throat cancer victims used their electronic voice boxes to sing Christmas tunes.

<doc id="884267" wikidata="Q1505459" url="?curid=884267" title="Pearl Carr and Teddy Johnson">
<text>Pearl Lavinia Carr (2 November 1921 – 16 February 2020) and Edward Victor &quot;Teddy&quot; Johnson (4 September 1919 – 6 June 2018) were English husband-and-wife entertainers who were best-known during the 1950s and early 1960s. They were the UK&#x27;s Eurovision entrants at the 1959 contest with &quot;Sing, Little Birdie&quot;, which came second.

==Early life==
Carr was born in Exmouth, Devon, and Johnson was born in Surbiton, Surrey. They were both successful solo singers before their marriage in 1955. Carr&#x27;s mother, who had worked on the variety stage, taught her to sing and dance. She worked in a C.B. Cochran show, and later joined the Three in Harmony singing group, which appeared in the revue &quot;Best Bib And Tucker&quot; starring Tommy Trinder at the London Palladium in November, 1942. During 1944, she toured with Phil Green and his Basin Street Orchestra, and then she became a singer with various RAF Bands led by Leslie Douglas in 1945. By the late 1940s, she was singing with Cyril Stapleton and his Orchestra as they toured the UK&#x27;s dance halls. Carr became the lead singer of a vocal quartet, The Keynotes, in 1949, who recorded popular songs such as 1951&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s a Harvest Moon Tonight&quot;. The Keynotes were regulars on the BBC radio show &quot;Take It from Here&quot; in 1949, whilst in 1950, Carr was a fixture on &quot;Breakfast with (Bernard) Braden&quot;, broadcast at 8:15 a.m. on the BBC Home Service. She moved with Bernard Braden to his programme &quot;Bedtime with Braden&quot; (9:30 p.m.) in September 1950. She was given her own BBC radio series, &quot;In the Blue of the Evening&quot;, commencing on 22 March 1951.

Johnson left school at 14 and initially worked in an office. Four years later, he obtained a first professional booking, as a drummer and assistant steward on the P&amp;O liner SS Corfu. He made his first broadcast in 1939 for Radio Ceylon, which provoked a fellow musician to tell him: &quot;You are a very good singer but a bloody awful drummer&quot;. During World War II, Johnson served in the merchant navy, working on the Queen Mary ship as a butcher on the transatlantic run. After the war, he was part of the resident band at the Locarno dance hall in Streatham, south London, and he also broadcast as a singer with the bandleader Jack Payne. In 1948, he was taken on as chief announcer for Radio Luxembourg and spent two years with them, presenting and compiling a range of shows, from request programmes to the first radio hit parade, compiled from British sales of sheet music. He was offered a recording contract by Columbia Records, and returned to London to begin a successful recording career. Johnson&#x27;s first record was &quot;Beloved, Be Faithful&quot;, a sheet music chart no. 1 hit. In total, he cut 60 sides for the Columbia label as a solo artist, including covers of hits including &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Love You&quot;. He was also a DJ on BBC Radio 2 as the first presenter of the popular programme &quot;All Time Greats&quot;.

==Joint success==
Carr and Johnson were married in 1955 and remained so for 63 years, until their deaths. They became known professionally as &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Music&quot;, and were frequently on British television light entertainment programmes. These included &quot;The Winifred Atwell Show&quot;, &quot;Big Night Out&quot;, &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; (with Morecambe and Wise), &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;, &quot;The Arthur Haynes Show&quot;, &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; and &quot;Blackpool Night Out&quot;. They were also regulars on the children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Crackerjack!&quot; with Eamonn Andrews and Ronnie Corbett. The duo were part of a record-breaking season at the London Palladium with Bruce Forsyth, and were chosen to appear in the 1960 Royal Variety Performance.

Carr and Johnson represented the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1959, Johnson being the first male Briton to take part, and they finished second with the song &quot;Sing, Little Birdie&quot;. The record peaked at No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart.

In 2011, Johnson revealed that they initially thought the contest to become the British entry was the extent of their booking. &quot;We had never heard of the Eurovision Song Contest before and were going to be booked as solo singers, but that consummated Pearl and Teddy as a double act. As far as we were concerned it was just another gig, but it was the easiest money we had ever had. There were two heats – one on the Monday and another on the Wednesday, with the final on Saturday night. When we won, the BBC Head of Television Light Entertainment Eric Maschwitz said he was thrilled that Pearl and I would now represent our country in the Eurovision Song Contest in Cannes. I said: &#x27;What? What do you mean?&#x27; I didn&#x27;t know we had to represent the country. We had no idea whatsoever. He gave me the dates for Cannes and I just hoped we had them available. As it happened, we did. Pearl flew out with three guys from the BBC but I was doing a small show for ATV and got a later flight.&quot;

They also tried to represent the United Kingdom again in 1960, entering two songs into the pre-selection, &quot;Pickin&#x27; Petals&quot; and &quot;When The Tide Turns&quot;; the latter made the final. It was up against Johnson&#x27;s own brother, Bryan. In the end, Bryan won and went on to represent the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1960. He came second, with &quot;Looking High, High, High&quot;. Carr and Johnson had another hit single the following year, &quot;How Wonderful to Know&quot;, which charted at No. 23 in the UK, which was frequently played on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Family Favourites&quot; programme.

Carr and Johnson continued to appear in summer seasons around the UK and on cruise ships for the Royal Viking Line. In 1986, they were the subject of an edition of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. After this, they appeared in the West End revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Follies&quot;, playing vaudeville couple Wally and Emily Whitman, singing &quot;Rain on the Roof&quot;. It was at the conclusion of its 18-month run in 1990 that they decided to retire. Shortly afterwards, EMI issued a CD of their joint recordings, &quot;The Magic of Pearl Carr and Teddy Johnson&quot;. That year, they received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Music Hall Society.

==Later life==
Following their retirement, Carr and Johnson moved into Brinsworth House, a home for retired entertainers in south west London.

Johnson appeared in a short piece to camera for a Morecambe and Wise tribute in 2018. He died on 6 June 2018, aged 98. Carr died on 16 February 2020, also aged 98.

<text>Christian Liberté Boltanski (6 September 1944 – 14 July 2021) was a French sculptor, photographer, painter, and film maker. He is best known for his photography installations and contemporary French conceptual style.

==Early life==
Boltanski was born in Paris on 6 September 1944. His father, Étienne Alexandre Boltanski, a physician, was Jewish and had come to France from Russia, while Marie-Elise Ilari-Guérin, his Roman Catholic mother originated from Corsica, descended from Ukrainian Jews. His Jewish heritage was a large influence in Boltanski&#x27;s household. During World War II, while living in Paris, his father escaped deportation by hiding in a space under the floorboards of the family apartment for a year and a half. Christian grew up with this knowledge, and his early experiences with wartime affairs deeply affected him. These experiences would influence his artwork later on. He dropped out of school at age 12.

==Early career==
Boltanski began creating art in the late 1950s, but did not rise to prominence until almost a decade later through a few short, avant-garde films and some published notebooks in which he referenced his childhood. He had his first one-man exhibition at the Théâtre Le Ranelagh in May 1968. His earliest works included imagery of ideal families and imaginary lifestyles (something Boltanski always lacked), made to display as if they were in museums.

==Installation art==

Boltanski began creating mixed media/materials installations in 1986 with light as essential concept. Tin boxes, altar-like construction of framed and manipulated photographs (e.g. &quot;Le Lycée Chases&quot;, 1986–1987), photographs of Jewish schoolchildren taken in Vienna in 1931, used as a forceful reminder of mass murder of Jews by the Nazis, all those elements and materials used in his work are used in order to represent deep contemplation regarding reconstruction of past. While creating &quot;Reserve&quot; (exhibition at Museum für Gegenwartskunst in Basel in 1989), Boltanski filled rooms and corridors with worn clothing items as a way of inciting profound sensation of human tragedy at concentration camps. As in his previous works, objects serve as relentless reminders of human experience and suffering. His piece, &quot; Monument (Odessa)&quot;, uses six photographs of Jewish students in 1939 and lights to resemble Yahrzeit candles to honor and remember the dead. &quot;My work is about the fact of dying, but it&#x27;s not about the Holocaust itself.&quot; In 1971 Boltanski produced his installation, &quot;L&#x27; Album de la famille D. 1939-1964&quot;. 

Additionally, his enormous installation titled &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (2010) at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City, is a great example of how his constructions and installations trace the lives of the lost and forgotten.

==Exhibitions==
Boltanski participated in over 150 art exhibitions throughout the world. Among others, he had solo exhibitions at the New Museum (1988), the Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein, Magasin 3 in Stockholm, the La Maison Rouge gallery, Institut Mathildenhöhe, the Kewenig Galerie, The Musée d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire du Judaïsme, and many others.

In 2002, Boltanski made the installation &quot;Totentanz II&quot;, a shadow installation with copper figures, for the underground Centre for International Light Art (CILA) in Unna, Germany. Nine years later, the Es Baluard museum in Mallorca exhibited &quot;Signatures&quot; from July to September 2011. The installation was conceived by Boltanski specifically for Es Baluard and which is focused on the memory of the workers who in the 17th century built the museum&#x27;s walls.

In the winter of 2017–2018, Boltanski created a new installation for the Oude Kerk, titled &quot;After&quot;. It tackled the theme of what will come after life has come to an end. The exhibition was shown from November 2017 until April 2018.

==Personal life==
Boltanski was married to Annette Messager, who is also a contemporary artist, until his death. They chose not to have children. They lived in Malakoff, outside Paris. He was the brother of sociologist Luc Boltanski and uncle of writer Christophe Boltanski.

Boltanski died on 14 July 2021 at Hôpital Cochin in Paris. He was 76, and suffered from an unspecified illness prior to his death.

Following his death, the artist&#x27;s moral rights — which prerogatives are the right of disclosure, the right of respect of the works&#x27; integrity and the right to authorship - were passed on to Angelika Markul.

<text>Napoléon Antoine Belcourt, (September 15, 1860 – August 7, 1932) was a Franco-Ontarian parliamentarian in Canada.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Belcourt was born in Toronto to French-Canadian parents, Ferdinand-Napoléon Belcourt and Marie-Anne Clair, and raised in Trois-Rivières, Quebec. He studied law at Université Laval, was called to the Quebec bar in 1882 and began his legal practice in Montreal in 1883 before moving to Ottawa in 1884. Belcourt was called to the Ontario bar in 1884. He joined the law faculty at the University of Ottawa in 1891, and became proprietor of the newspaper &quot;Le Temps&quot; which supported the Liberal Party of Wilfrid Laurier. Belcourt served as clerk of the peace and crown attorney for Carleton County from 1894 to 1896. In 1899, he was named Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

He was married twice: to Hectorine, the daughter of Senator Joseph Shehyn, in 1889 and to Mary Margaret Haycock in 1903.

===Career===
He first ran for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1891 election but was defeated. He won a seat in the 1896 election, and used his position as a Member of Parliament (MP) to lobby in favour of the Franco-Ontarian community.

In 1904, he became Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada but only remained in that position for the rest of that Parliament&#x27;s term. He stepped down following the 1904 election, but remained an MP.

In 1907, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Laurier.

Belcourt became a leader in the movement for French language Separate Schools in Ontario. He presided over the first Congress of Franco-Ontarians in 1910 called to oppose the Ontario government&#x27;s attempts to suppress the use of the French language in schools. He was also a leader in the struggle against Regulation 17 which was implemented by the provincial government in June 1912 to limit the use of French as a language of instruction in both the public and separate school systems. Opposition culminated in demonstrations of several thousand people in Ottawa with Belcourt speaking on behalf of the protesters.

He unsuccessfully argued against Regulation 17 in Ontario&#x27;s Supreme Court in 1914. He appealed all the way to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain, where he argued that the Regulation violated the rights of French taxpayers to have their money used in accordance to their wishes, and that it deprived citizens the right to use their own language and decide upon their children&#x27;s language of instruction. While Belcourt lost in court, the protest movement he led prevented the Regulation from being fully implemented.

In 1924, Belcourt was made Canada&#x27;s Minister Plenipotentiary to the Interallied Conference in London and, the next year, he presided over the meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Ottawa.

He died at Blue Sea Lake in Quebec at the age of 71.

The Municipality of Belcourt in Quebec, Canada, was named after him.

<doc id="884293" wikidata="Q8083949" url="?curid=884293" title="ʻAi Noa">
<text>The Ai Noa (Hawaiian: literally &quot;free eating&quot;), was a period of taboo-breaking which convulsed the Hawaiian Islands in October 1819. Women were allowed to eat forbidden food and to eat with men; the priests were no longer to offer human sacrifices; the many prohibitions surrounding the high chiefs were relaxed. 

Kamehameha I, the conqueror of the islands, had just died; his son Liholiho succeeded him (and was later known as King Kamehameha II). He came to power amid scenes of grief and licence. 

The usually strict rules of the Hawaiian religion and social system, known as kapu, were in abeyance during the usual mourning period. Women ate pork and bananas, people had sexual intercourse with whomever they pleased, routine life was completely overthrown. When a new high chief came to power, he usually re-imposed the kapu. 

Liholiho did attempt to reestablish the kapu, but he was opposed by his mother, Keōpūolani, the other wives of Kamehameha (including Kaahumanu, the powerful Maui chiefess), and Hewahewa, the &quot;Kahuna-nui&quot; of the kingdom. He took refuge in his canoe and after sailing about aimlessly for two days on the west coast of the Big Island of Hawaii, he landed and ate the feast of dogmeat (ordinarily reserved for women) that the chiefesses had prepared for him. Messengers were then sent over the islands announcing that eating was free and the kapu had fallen.

Some Hawaiian leaders opposed the efforts to abolish the Hawaiian religion. A faction led by Keaoua Kekuaokalani, a nephew of Kamehameha I and former student of Hewahewa, revolted against Kamehameha II and his court. Despite gathering some support, the rebels were defeated at the Battle of Kuamo&#x27;o in December 1819, marking the end of organized resistance against Hewahewa and his supporters.

The downfall of the old religion was further hastened by the arrival of Christian missionaries a few months later.

<doc id="884309" wikidata="Q275038" url="?curid=884309" title="Confiscation">
<text>Confiscation (from the Latin &quot;confiscatio&quot; &quot;to consign to the &quot;fiscus&quot;, i.e. transfer to the treasury&quot;) is a legal form of seizure by a government or other public authority. The word is also used, popularly, of spoliation under legal forms, or of any seizure of property as punishment or in enforcement of the law.

==Scope==
As a punishment, it differs from a fine in that it is not primarily meant to match the crime but rather reattributes the criminal&#x27;s ill-gotten spoils (often as a complement to the actual punishment for the crime itself; still common with various kinds of contraband, such as protected living organisms) to the community or even aims to rob them of their socio-economic status, in the extreme case reducing them to utter poverty, or if he or she is condemned to death even denies them the power to bequeath inheritance to their legal heirs.

Meanwhile, limited confiscation is often in function of the crime, the rationale being that the criminal must be denied the fruits of their fault, while the crime itself is rather punished in some other, independent way, such as prison term, physical punishments or even a concurring fine.

Often, police will auction items confiscated via police auction or asset forfeiture and keep the proceeds. Theoretically, it is possible for owners to buy back confiscated items. 

In airports, potentially dangerous items (such as hazardous chemicals, weapons, and sharp objects) are usually confiscated at inspections. Other items, such as certain food, may also be confiscated, depending on importation laws. Depending on the nature of the items, some may be returned at the end of the flight, while most are discarded or auctioned off. The musical comedian Anna Russell had an Irish harp confiscated by the U.S. Customs Service.

== History ==

=== Roman Law ===
Originally, in Roman law, confiscation was the seizure and transfer of private property to the &quot;fiscus&quot; (treasury) by the emperor; hence the appropriation, under legal authority, of private property to the state.

=== English Law ===
In modern English law, confiscation embraces forfeiture in the case of goods, and escheat in the case of lands, for crime or in default of heirs (see also Eminent domain). Goods may also be confiscated by the state for breaches of statutes relating to customs, excise or explosives. In the United Kingdom a confiscation order is a court order made under part 2 (England &amp; Wales), part 3 (Scotland) or part 4 (Northern Ireland) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 requiring a convicted defendant to pay a specified sum of money to the state by a specified date.

=== United States ===
During the American Revolution, customs racketeering became a serious problem. By harshly enforcing customs laws, particularly the more obscure regulations, corrupt customs officials could seize property almost with impunity. This caused significant conflict between the United States and Great Britain.

In the United States among the &quot;war measures&quot; during the American Civil War, acts were passed in 1861 and 1862 confiscating, respectively, property used for &quot;insurrectionary purposes&quot; and the property generally of those engaged in rebellion.

==Modern trends==
There was from the late 1980s onwards a resurgence of interest in confiscation as crime prevention tool, which went hand in hand with the interest in the criminalization of money laundering. A number of international instruments, starting with the 1988 Vienna Convention, have strongly suggested the enactment of legal provisions enabling confiscation of proceeds of crime. The 40 recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) have also stated its importance as a crime prevention tool.

A further trend has been the reversal of the burden of proof for the purpose of facilitating confiscation. To the surprise of many, it is actually quite legal for law enforcement agencies to take property from people who haven&#x27;t been convicted of a crime yet as civil asset forfeiture, a practice which brings in millions of dollars of revenue each year, disproportionately affecting people without means or access to a lawyer.

<text>Thomas Bain (14 December 1834 – 18 January 1915) was a Scottish born Canadian parliamentarian.

Bain was born in Scotland, the son of Walter Bain, and migrated to Canada with his family when he was three years old. They settled on a bush farm in Wentworth County near Hamilton, Ontario.

He was elected to the County Council in the 1860s and became Warden. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1872 federal election as a Liberal. He was re-elected on six subsequent occasions, serving as an MP for 28 years before retiring in 1900. In the House, he usually spoke on agricultural issues, and became Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Colonization in 1896.

In 1874, he married Helen Weir.

When the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, James David Edgar, died unexpectedly in July 1899, Wilfrid Laurier asked Bain to become the new Speaker for the remainder of Egar&#x27;s term.

Bain served as Speaker until the House was dissolved for the 1900 election in which he did not run.

After retiring from politics, Bain became President of the Landed Banking and Loan Company and the Malcolm and Souter Furniture Company. He died in Dundas, Ontario at age 80.

<doc id="884335" wikidata="Q163127" url="?curid=884335" title="Back to the Egg">
<text>Back to the Egg is the seventh and final studio album by the British-American rock band Wings, released in June 1979 on Parlophone in the UK and Columbia Records in North America (their first for the label). Co-produced by Chris Thomas, the album reflects band leader Paul McCartney&#x27;s embracing of contemporary musical trends such as new wave and punk, and marked the arrival of new Wings members Laurence Juber and Steve Holley. &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; adopts a loose conceptual theme around the idea of a working band, and its creation coincided with a period of considerable activity for the group, which included making a return to touring and work on several television and film projects.

Recording for the album began in June 1978 and lasted for almost a year. The sessions took place at Spirit of Ranachan Studios in Campbeltown, Scotland; Lympne Castle in Kent, London&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios, and Replica Studio – the last of which McCartney built as an exact replica of Abbey Road&#x27;s Studio Two when the latter became unavailable. Wings returned to Abbey Road in March 1979 to complete the album, before filming a series of promotional videos in Lympne and elsewhere, for what became the &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; TV special.

&quot;Back to the Egg&quot; received unfavourable reviews from the majority of critics, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine deriding it as &quot;the sorriest grab bag of dreck in recent memory&quot;. Although the album charted in the top ten around the world and was certified platinum in the United States, it was viewed as a commercial failure relative to previous Wings releases, particularly in light of the generous financial terms under which McCartney had signed with CBS-owned Columbia Records. Of its singles – &quot;Old Siam, Sir&quot;, &quot;Getting Closer&quot; and &quot;Arrow Through Me&quot; – only &quot;Getting Closer&quot; made the top 20 in Britain or America. The song &quot;Rockestra Theme&quot;, recorded with a cast of guest musicians from bands such as the Who, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1980.

Wings toured the UK in support of the album, but the planned world tour ended in January 1980, when McCartney was arrested in Japan for possession of marijuana, spending nine days in jail. The group disbanded early the following year after the departure of Laine. &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; was reissued in 1993, with bonus tracks, and in 2007 for iTunes, with the addition of Wings&#x27; 1979 non-album single &quot;Goodnight Tonight&quot;, in its extended form.

==Background==
After the release of the album &quot;London Town&quot; (1978), Wings band leader Paul McCartney hired two session musicians, drummer Steve Holley and lead guitarist Laurence Juber, to replace former members Joe English and Jimmy McCulloch. With the new line-up – Wings&#x27; sixth since its formation in 1971 – McCartney intended to record a raw rock and roll album and return to touring, for the band&#x27;s first concerts since their successful Wings Over the World tour of 1975–76. McCartney also hoped to realise his longstanding plan of making a film adaptation of the Rupert the Bear cartoon series, for which he owned the commercial rights, and commissioned English playwright Willy Russell to write a feature film starring Wings.

Holley and Juber were recruited by Wings co-founder and guitarist Denny Laine, who had appeared as a guest on &quot;The David Essex Show&quot; in 1977 when Juber was working as a guitarist in the house band. Holley, a neighbour of Laine&#x27;s, joined Wings in time to appear in the promotional video for &quot;London Town&quot;″s lead single, &quot;With a Little Luck&quot;, having turned down a position with Elton John&#x27;s band. According to Wings biographer Garry McGee, Juber and Holley were each paid a weekly sum less than one-fifth of that paid to McCartney, his wife Linda (the band&#x27;s keyboard player) and Laine.

For the new album, &quot;Back to the Egg&quot;, McCartney collaborated in the studio with producer Chris Thomas, with whom he had begun working on the audio for two films documenting Wings&#x27; last world tour: &quot;Wings Over the World&quot;, a television documentary, and the cinema release &quot;Rockshow&quot; (1980). This was the first time Wings recorded with an outside producer since their 1973 single &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, which George Martin had produced. After working with the Pretenders and the Sex Pistols, Thomas brought a punk rock and new wave influence to Wings&#x27; sound, matching McCartney&#x27;s desire to reflect contemporary musical trends.

==Songs==

Although &quot;London Town&quot; had featured a significant level of contribution from Laine as a songwriter, all but one of the songs on &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; are credited to McCartney alone. The album was originally planned around a loose conceptual theme, about which authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter write in their book &quot;Eight Arms to Hold You&quot;: &quot;The idea was to have a theme of a working band, getting back on the road ... or &#x27;back to the egg&#x27; (or protective shell) of touring.&quot; In the original LP format, the two album sides were labelled with the egg-related titles &quot;Sunny Side Up&quot; and &quot;Over Easy&quot;.

===&quot;Sunny Side Up&quot;===
The album&#x27;s opening song is &quot;Reception&quot;, an instrumental, in which McCartney attempted to capture the effect of turning a radio dial and finding &quot;about four stations at once&quot;. The track features a guitar-controlled synthesizer (played by Juber) over a funk-inspired bassline, and spoken voices, including a reading of part of &quot;The Poodle and the Pug&quot;, from Vivian Ellis&#x27;s opera &quot;Big Ben&quot; (1946). A brief segment from the track &quot;The Broadcast&quot;, which appears later on &quot;Back to the Egg&quot;, is previewed in this opening piece. The next three songs – &quot;Getting Closer&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re Open Tonight&quot; and &quot;Spin It On&quot; – adhere to the proposed album-wide concept. Writing in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in June 1979, Mark Williams interpreted &quot;Reception&quot; as representing a radio being tuned in a car, whereby &quot;the occupant is on his way to a gig, hence &#x27;Getting Closer&#x27; [to the venue] and, upon arrival, &#x27;We&#x27;re Open Tonight&#x27;&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams/MM&quot;&gt;Williams, Mark (16 June 1979). &quot;Wings: Taking off at Last&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (&quot;subscription required&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of live performance is then reflected in the sequencing of what Madinger and Easter term &quot;heavier rock tracks such as &#x27;Spin It On&#x27;&quot;.
McCartney had recorded a piano demo for &quot;Getting Closer&quot; in 1974, at which point the song had a slower tempo. Author and &quot;Mojo&quot; contributor Tom Doyle describes Wings&#x27; version as &quot;power-popping&quot; and reminiscent of the English band Squeeze. The mellow &quot;We&#x27;re Open Tonight&quot; was written at the McCartneys&#x27; farm in Campbeltown, Scotland, and was the album&#x27;s title track until Linda suggested &quot;Back to the Egg&quot;.

Another song composed in Scotland, the fast-tempo &quot;Spin It On&quot; was an obvious acknowledgment of punk and new wave; author Vincent Benitez terms it &quot;McCartney-esque whimsy on punk steroids&quot;. Laine&#x27;s composition &quot;Again and Again and Again&quot; similarly has &quot;echoes of the Clash&quot;, according to McCartney biographer Howard Sounes. This song was originally two separate pieces, which Laine combined on McCartney&#x27;s recommendation.

Although credited to McCartney alone, &quot;Old Siam, Sir&quot; marked &quot;the most collective band involvement&quot; as regards songwriting, Madinger and Easter suggest. Similar in style to &quot;Spin It On&quot;, the song features a keyboard riff written by Linda and a Holley-composed middle eight; in addition, Laine helped McCartney complete the composition, an early version of which the previous incarnation of Wings had demoed in July 1976. &quot;Arrow Through Me&quot;, a track more in keeping with McCartney&#x27;s melodic pop style, is a song written from the perspective of a rejected lover. With a musical arrangement that eschews guitar backing for synthesizer, Fender Rhodes piano and horns, Benitez views it as &quot;reminiscent of the techno-pop style of Stevie Wonder&quot;.

===&quot;Over Easy&quot;===
Opening side two, &quot;Rockestra Theme&quot; was a composition that McCartney had first recorded in 1974, on the same piano demo tape as &quot;Getting Closer&quot;. &quot;Rockestra Theme&quot; is an instrumental – except for the shouted line &quot;Why haven&#x27;t I had any dinner?&quot;, which author Robert Rodriguez describes as a &quot;deliberate evocation&quot; of Glenn Miller&#x27;s 1940 single &quot;Pennsylvania 6-5000&quot;. Another rock track, &quot;To You&quot; includes a lyric aimed at a lover who has wronged the singer. The guitar solo on the recording provides an unusual aspect for a Wings song, in that Juber played the part through an Eventide harmonizer while McCartney simultaneously altered the harmonizer&#x27;s settings from the studio&#x27;s control room.

McCartney deemed the two gospel-influenced pieces making up &quot;After the Ball/Million Miles&quot; as being of insufficient quality to merit inclusion as separate tracks; &quot;After the Ball&quot; ends with a guitar solo, edited from parts played by McCartney, Laine and Juber, after which &quot;Million Miles&quot; consists of a performance by McCartney alone, on concertina. This is followed by another medley, &quot;Winter Rose/Love Awake&quot;, both portions of which McCartney had demoed at Rude Studio, his home studio at Campbeltown, in 1977.

&quot;The Broadcast&quot; is another instrumental, designed to give the impression of several radio signals interlaced, and bringing full-circle the concept established in the album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Reception&quot;. Over a musical backing of piano, mellotron and gizmotron, it features readings taken from the plays &quot;The Sport of Kings&quot; by Ian Hay and &quot;The Little Man&quot; by John Galsworthy. As a return to the proposed working-band concept, &quot;So Glad to See You Here&quot;, Rodriguez writes, &quot;[evokes] the anticipation of a live act guaranteed to &#x27;knock &#x27;em dead&#x27;&quot; and so recalls Wings&#x27; 1975–76 show-opening medley &quot;Venus and Mars/Rock Show&quot;. During the outro, the band reprise a line from &quot;We&#x27;re Open Tonight&quot;. The album ends with a jazz-inflected ballad, &quot;Baby&#x27;s Request&quot;, which McCartney wrote for American vocal group the Mills Brothers, after seeing them perform in the South of France during the summer of 1978.

==Production==
The band first rehearsed material for &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; in London, at the offices of McCartney&#x27;s company MPL Communications in Soho Square, before carrying out further rehearsals in Scotland, in June 1978. As on his other Wings recordings over 1978–79, Thomas worked with Phil McDonald as his recording engineer, at McCartney&#x27;s insistence, rather than Bill Price, who was the producer&#x27;s preferred engineer.

===Recording and overdubbing===

====June–July 1978: Spirit of Ranachan Studios====
The recording sessions for &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; began on 29 June 1978 at Spirit of Ranachan Studios – another, larger recording facility on the McCartneys&#x27; Campbeltown farm – using equipment loaned from Mickie Most&#x27;s RAK Studio in London. The basic tracks were recorded with a spontaneity that had been absent in Wings&#x27; past work, employing an approach that Juber has described as a &quot;back-to-basics, garage band kind of feel&quot;.

Sessions at Spirit of Ranachan lasted until 27 July, during which the band taped and added overdubs to &quot;Arrow Through Me&quot;, &quot;Again and Again and Again&quot;, &quot;To You&quot;, &quot;Winter Rose&quot;, &quot;Old Siam, Sir&quot; and &quot;Spin It On&quot;. Basic tracks were also completed for &quot;Cage&quot;, a song that remained in the proposed running order for the album until early in 1979, &quot;Crawl of the Wild&quot;, &quot;Weep for Love&quot;, &quot;Ballroom Dancing&quot; and &quot;Maisie&quot;. These last three compositions would all appear on solo albums by members of Wings between 1980 and 1982.

In addition, the band filmed a promotional video for the &quot;London Town&quot; single &quot;I&#x27;ve Had Enough&quot; while in Scotland and, in early July, recorded demos of twelve pieces intended for the Rupert the Bear film soundtrack. In the case of the latter activity, none of these compositions were revisited for what became &quot;Rupert and the Frog Song&quot; (1984).

====September 1978: Lympne Castle====
After a break to allow for school summer holidays, recording recommenced on 11 September at Lympne Castle in Kent, using the RAK mobile recording equipment, as before. The choice of location was partly due to the castle&#x27;s proximity to the McCartneys&#x27; property &quot;Waterfall&quot;, in Peasmarsh, East Sussex. During sessions lasting through to 29 September, the band recorded &quot;We&#x27;re Open Tonight&quot;, &quot;Love Awake&quot;, &quot;After the Ball&quot;, &quot;Million Miles&quot;, &quot;Reception&quot; and &quot;The Broadcast&quot;.

Recording took place mainly in the castle&#x27;s great hall, with Holly&#x27;s drum kit positioned in the fireplace. McCartney and Juber taped their acoustic guitar parts for &quot;We&#x27;re Open Tonight&quot; in a stairwell. Excerpted from books found in the library, the readings for &quot;Reception&quot; and &quot;The Broadcast&quot; were overdubbed in the kitchen and performed by the owners of Lympne Castle, Harold and Dierdre Margary.

====October–December 1978: Abbey Road Studios====

Sessions moved to Abbey Road Studios in London on 3 October. That day, Wings joined with a supergroup of guest musicians, collectively known as &quot;Rockestra&quot;, to record the tracks &quot;Rockestra Theme&quot; and &quot;So Glad to See You Here&quot;. A camera crew led by Barry Chattington filmed the proceedings, and a 40-minute documentary, titled &quot;Rockestra&quot;, was later compiled from the footage. Equipment used for this session included 60 microphones, a pair of mixing consoles and a 16-track recording desk. James Honeyman-Scott of the Pretenders, Hank Marvin of the Shadows, the Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend, Pink Floyd&#x27;s David Gilmour, Led Zeppelin&#x27;s John Paul Jones and John Bonham, and the Attractions&#x27; Bruce Thomas all took part. Also among the line-up was the horn section from Wings&#x27; 1975–76 world tour, consisting of Howie Casey, Tony Dorsey, Thaddeus Richard and Steve Howard. Keith Moon was meant to participate, but he had died shortly before the session; Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton were also scheduled to appear.

On 10 October, Wings taped &quot;Getting Closer&quot; at Abbey Road, along with a demo of &quot;Baby&#x27;s Request&quot;. McCartney had intended this recording of &quot;Baby&#x27;s Request&quot; for the Mills Brothers to use as a guide, but after they asked to be paid for recording the song, he instead included the demo on &quot;Back to the Egg&quot;. The band then continued with overdubs on these and other songs intermittently through October and November, finishing at Abbey Road on 1 December.

====December 1978–February 1979: Replica Studio====
Towards the end of the year, Wings also carried out overdubs at the newly built Replica Studio, located at MPL&#x27;s Soho Square offices. Frustrated at the impending unavailability of Abbey Road&#x27;s Studio Two – which studio owner and record company EMI needed for its other acts, besides Wings – McCartney had constructed an exact replica of Studio Two in the basement at MPL. Among the work done on &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; at Replica, the band replaced the final twenty seconds of &quot;So Glad to See You Here&quot; with what Madinger and Easter describe as &quot;a reggae-styled coda&quot;, containing the &quot;We&#x27;re Open Tonight&quot; reprise.

Sessions continued there in January and February 1979. During that time, the band recorded a non-album single – the disco-styled &quot;Goodnight Tonight&quot;, backed with &quot;Daytime Nighttime Suffering&quot; – as a release to coincide with the airing of the long-delayed &quot;Wings Over the World&quot; special. While noting that McCartney and Laine&#x27;s relationship was beginning to unravel at this point, Sounes compares the freshness of these new recordings with the drawn-out sessions for &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; and writes that the album &quot;was now so overworked it might more aptly have been titled &quot;Over-Egged&quot;&quot;. Impatient at the amount of time being spent in the recording studio, Laine publicly admitted that he was &quot;desperate&quot; to go out on tour.

===Final overdubbing and mixing===
In March, Wings moved back to Abbey Road Studios to complete the album. Vocal overdubs were then added to &quot;Winter Rose/Love Awake&quot; and an orchestral-sounding mellotron part to the end of &quot;Getting Closer&quot;. Having worked with the Black Dyke Mills Band in the 1960s, when he produced their 1968 single &quot;Thingumybob&quot; for Apple Records, McCartney invited the band down from Yorkshire to overdub brass accompaniment on &quot;Winter Rose/Love Awake&quot;.

While mixing the album during March, Wings finally discarded the song &quot;Cage&quot;, which had been sequenced as the second track, following &quot;Reception&quot;. The same alternative running order paired the Rockestra recordings at the end of side two, so that the album closed with the &quot;We&#x27;re Open Tonight&quot; coda. Holly later recalled that whereas beforehand the band had been confident that &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; would be a strong album, during the final mixing process &quot;[it] dawned on us there might be problems&quot;. At the last minute, &quot;Baby&#x27;s Request&quot; replaced &quot;Cage&quot; and the running order was revised, with the result that the working-band concept became less pronounced.

==Artwork and promotional videos==
The design for the album&#x27;s artwork was by Hipgnosis, the company responsible for previous Wings album covers such as &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; (1975) and the recent &quot;Wings Greatest&quot; compilation (1978). The front cover depicts the five members of Wings in a room, looking down through space at Planet Earth through an open hatchway in the floor; the statuette above the mantlepiece behind them is the same that appears in the &quot;Wings Greatest&quot; artwork. The picture was taken by photographer John Shaw at his London studio. Photos of the individual band members appeared on the back cover, credited to Linda and Paul McCartney.

Working with film company Keef &amp; Co., Wings filmed seven promotional videos for the album, which would later be compiled into the &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; TV special. Filming took place between 4 and 13 June, at locations including Lympne Castle&#x27;s main hall, a private airfield at Lympne, Camber Sands in East Sussex, and Keef &amp; Co.&#x27;s London studios. &quot;Old Siam, Sir&quot;, &quot;Getting Closer&quot;, &quot;Spin It On&quot; and &quot;Arrow Through Me&quot; were among the tracks for which videos were made.

==Release==
&quot;Goodnight Tonight&quot; had been issued on Columbia Records in America, marking McCartney&#x27;s break from EMI-affiliated Capitol Records, although he and Wings remained with EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label in the UK. McCartney&#x27;s contract with Columbia made him the highest-paid recording artist in the world. As an incentive for McCartney, Columbia&#x27;s parent company, CBS, had added to his publishing portfolio by giving him the highly profitable Frank Music catalogue – making McCartney the copyright holder to &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; and other popular musicals by Frank Loesser.

&quot;Back to the Egg&quot; was released on 24 May 1979 in the US (as Columbia FC-36057), and on 8 June in the UK (as Parlophone PCTC 257). In Britain, &quot;Old Siam, Sir&quot; was the album&#x27;s first single, whereas &quot;Getting Closer&quot; was the choice in America; in both cases, &quot;Spin It On&quot; was the B-side. On 11 June, an album launch party took place inside Abbey Road&#x27;s Studio Two, which had been blacked-out like a large frying pan, while tables carrying yellow parasols represented fried eggs sitting in the pan. Part of Chattington&#x27;s &quot;Rockestra&quot; documentary was screened during the event, the only public airing the film received.

The follow-up singles, issued in August, were &quot;Arrow Through Me&quot; in the US and &quot;Getting Closer&quot; in the UK, the latter release a double A-side with &quot;Baby&#x27;s Request&quot;. In some European countries, &quot;Rockestra Theme&quot; was released as a single.

Compared to the major commercial success of previous Wings albums, sales of &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; were disappointing, and none of its singles became significant hits. In the UK, &quot;Old Siam, Sir&quot; and &quot;Getting Closer&quot; climbed to number 35 and number 60, respectively. On America&#x27;s &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, &quot;Getting Closer&quot; peaked at number 20, and &quot;Arrow Through Me&quot; at number 29. &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; reached number 6 in the UK and number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, although US chart compilers &quot;Cashbox&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot; both listed it at number 7. With heavy promotion from Columbia, the album sold over 1 million copies in America; in Britain, retail outlets soon slashed its price in an attempt to dispense with their surplus of stock.

McCartney later reflected that for an act other than Wings, sales such as those for &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; would have been considered &quot;very healthy&quot;. Given CBS&#x27;s substantial investment in their new signing, Madinger and Easter write, the album&#x27;s apparent failure led to a period of &quot;mutual finger-pointing between Paul and Columbia Records&quot;, lasting until his contract expired in 1985.

==Reception==

&quot;Back to the Egg&quot; received predominantly negative reviews on release; author Alan Clayson writes of the album receiving &quot;a critical mauling as vicious as that for &quot;London Town&quot;&quot;. In an especially unfavourable critique for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Timothy White described it as &quot;the sorriest grab bag of dreck in recent memory&quot; and lamented that none of the songs were &quot;the least bit fleshed out&quot;, with the listener instead given &quot;an irritating display of disjointed images and unfocused musical snapshots&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;White/RS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After opining that, since 1970, &quot;this ex-Beatle has been lending his truly prodigious talents ... to some of the laziest records in the history of rock &amp; roll&quot;, White wrote: &quot;Who, one felt compelled to ask, is in charge here? &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; provides the final, obvious answer: &quot;no one&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau said of McCartney and the new Wings album: &quot;When he&#x27;s on, Paulie&#x27;s abundant tunefulness passes for generosity. Here he&#x27;s just hoping something will stick.&quot; In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Ray Coleman wrote that McCartney &quot;seems to be on a treadmill of banality&quot;. Coleman described &quot;Rockestra Theme&quot; and &quot;So Glad to See You Here&quot; as &quot;creditable, rolling, raunchy and at least efficient, with Paul&#x27;s voice at its rocking best on the last named track&quot;, but concluded: &quot;This album gets Wings nowhere ...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman/NME Originals&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Billboard&quot;″s reviewer gave &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; &quot;Spotlight&quot; status (meaning &quot;the most outstanding new product of the week&#x27;s releases and that with the greatest potential for top of the chart placement&quot;) and commented: &quot;The music features typical McCartney fare of late with nothing here that will distinguish it as one of his classics. The arrangements, though, are interesting, encompassing a variety of styles.&quot;

In a more positive assessment, for &quot;Creem&quot; magazine, Mitchell Cohen highlighted the album&#x27;s second side as &quot;a collection of McCartney performances that string together like abbey roadwork&quot;, and praised McCartney&#x27;s vocals relative to his past work, writing: &quot;all of the current tracks are terser, sung better, have less of what I suppose would be called the recording artist&#x27;s equivalent of camera consciousness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen/Creem&quot;&gt;Cohen, Mitchell (September 1979). &quot;Wings: &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; (Columbia)&quot;. &quot;Creem&quot;. Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (&quot;subscription required&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; To &quot;NME&quot; critic Bob Woffinden, the attempt at an album-wide concept was &quot;a pretty half-baked one&quot; and Hipgnosis&#x27; cover photo was &quot;easily the album&#x27;s strongest point&quot;. While identifying the songs as &quot;particularly weak lyrically&quot;, Woffinden concluded: &quot;It was the familiar McCartney problem. He had every essential creative requirement, except the discipline required to knead the parts into a perfect whole.&quot;

AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine views &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; as &quot;a set of [McCartney&#x27;s] most undistinguished songs&quot; that &quot;have no spark whatsoever&quot;, and bemoans &quot;the weak sound of the record and Wings&#x27; faceless performances&quot;. Among McCartney biographers, Vincent Benitez writes that the songs are &quot;uneven in quality&quot;, and Howard Sounes describes the album as &quot;a curate&#x27;s egg, good in parts, with token attempts at sounding contemporary&quot;. Tom Doyle views &quot;the new wave-ish rockers&quot; like &quot;Spin It On&quot; as &quot;too smoothed out to be truly edgy&quot; and the two spoken-word tracks as &quot;weird – and not in a good way&quot;. Doyle considers that while &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; has its &quot;moments of inspiration&quot;, &quot;There was too much material [recorded during the sessions], and yet not enough of it to gel into a cohesive album.&quot;

==Aftermath and reissues==

With the album falling well short of Columbia&#x27;s and McCartney&#x27;s expectations commercially, McCartney spent the remainder of summer 1979 recording in Peasmarsh and Campbeltown, without Wings, creating his solo album &quot;McCartney II&quot; (1980). During November and December 1979, US TV stations aired the 31-minute &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; special, as Wings undertook a nineteen-show UK tour, the first leg of the proposed world tour. Among the songs in the setlist, they performed several tracks from &quot;Back to the Egg&quot;: &quot;Getting Closer&quot;, &quot;Again and Again and Again&quot;, &quot;Old Siam, Sir&quot;, &quot;Spin It On&quot; and &quot;Arrow Through Me&quot;.

The band were scheduled to tour Japan during January and February 1980, but the concerts, together with their tour dates elsewhere in the world, were cancelled after McCartney was arrested for possession of drugs when entering the country. Around this time, &quot;Rockestra Theme&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Wings regrouped in October 1980 to finish off songs for the planned &quot;Cold Cuts&quot; album, a compilation that McCartney had suggested when CBS sought to recover part of its financial losses from &quot;Back to the Egg&quot;. The reunion with Wings was short-lived and the band discontinued upon Laine&#x27;s departure in April 1981.

On 20 June 1989, by which time McCartney had returned to Capitol Records, &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; was released on CD in America with three bonus tracks: &quot;Daytime Nighttime Suffering&quot;, McCartney&#x27;s 1979 Christmas single &quot;Wonderful Christmastime&quot;, and the latter&#x27;s B-side, &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reggae&quot;. In August 1993, Parlophone reissued the album as part of &quot;The Paul McCartney Collection&quot; with the same three bonus tracks. Samples of &quot;Reception&quot; and &quot;The Broadcast&quot; appeared on the Fireman&#x27;s &quot;Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest&quot; (1993) album, a collaboration between McCartney and Youth. In 2007, &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; was released on iTunes, with a remix of &quot;Goodnight Tonight&quot; as a bonus track.

<text>Edmund Rubbra (; 23 May 190114 February 1986) was a British composer. He composed both instrumental and vocal works for soloists, chamber groups and full choruses and orchestras. He was greatly esteemed by fellow musicians and was at the peak of his fame in the mid-20th century. The best known of his pieces are his eleven symphonies. Although he was active at a time when many people wrote twelve-tone music, he decided not to write in this idiom; instead, he devised his own distinctive style. His later works were not as popular with the concert-going public as his previous ones had been, although he never lost the respect of his colleagues. Therefore, his output as a whole is less celebrated today than would have been expected from its early popularity. He was the brother of the engineer Arthur Rubbra.

==Early life==
He was born Charles Edmund Rubbra at 21 Arnold Road, Semilong, Northampton. His parents encouraged him in his music, but they were not professional musicians, though his mother had a good voice and sang in the church choir, and his father played the piano a little, by ear. Rubbra&#x27;s artistic and sensitive nature was apparent from early on. He remembered waking one winter&#x27;s morning when he was about three or four years old, and noticing something different about the light in his bedroom; there was light where there was usually shadow, and vice versa. When his father came into the room, Edmund asked him why this was. His father explained that there had been a fall of snow during the night, and so the sunlight was reflecting off the snow and entering Edmund&#x27;s bedroom from below, instead of above, thus reversing the patterns of light and shade. When Rubbra was much older he came to realise that this &#x27;topsy-turveydom&#x27;, as he called it, had caused him to often use short pieces of melody which would sound good, both in their original form and when inverted (so that when the original melody goes up a certain amount, the inverted one goes down the same amount). He then set these two melodies together, but slightly offset from one another, so that the listener hears the melody going up, say, then an echo where it goes down instead.

Another childhood memory which Rubbra identified as later affecting his music, took place when he was nine or ten. He was out walking with his father on a hot summer Sunday. As they rested by a gate, looking down at Northampton, he heard distant bells, &#x27;whose music seemed suspended in the still air&#x27;, as he put it. He was lost in the magic of the moment, losing all sense of the scenery round about him, just being aware of &quot;downward drifting sounds that seemed isolated from everything else around&quot;. He traces the &#x27;downward scales that constantly act as focal points in [his] textures&#x27; to this experience.

Rubbra took piano lessons from a local woman with a good reputation and a piano with discoloured ivory keys. This instrument contrasted starkly with the piano on which Rubbra practised, which was a new demonstration upright piano, lent to his family by his uncle by marriage. This uncle owned a piano and music shop, and prospective buyers would come to Rubbra&#x27;s house, where he would demonstrate the quality of the piano by playing Mozart&#x27;s Sonata in C to them. If the sale went through, the Rubbra family was given commission, and a new demonstration piano took the place of the one sold.

In 1912, Rubbra and his family moved a little more than quarter of a mile away to 1 Balfour Road, Kingsthorpe, Northampton, moving again four years later so that his father could start his own business selling and repairing clocks and watches. At this house, above the shop, Edmund had the back bedroom for his work, but the stairs were not wide enough to allow the piano to be brought up, so the window frame of his room had to be removed to get the piano in from outside.

==Education and career==
Rubbra started composing while he was still at school. One of his masters, Mr. Grant, asked him to compose a school hymn. He would have been very familiar with hymn tunes, as he attended a Congregational church and played the piano for the Sunday School. He also worked as an errand boy whilst he was still at school, giving some of his earnings to his parents.

At the age of 14, he left school and started work in the office of Crockett and Jones, one of Northampton&#x27;s many boot and shoe manufacturers. Edmund was delighted to be able to accrue a number of stamps from parcels and letters sent to this factory, as stamp-collecting was one of his hobbies. Later, he was invited by an uncle, who owned another boot and shoe factory, to come and work for him. The idea was that he would work his way up from the bottom of the company, with a view to ownership when his uncle, who had no sons of his own, died. Edmund, influenced by his mother&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm for the idea, declined. Instead, he took a job as a correspondence clerk in a railway station. In his last year at school he had learned shorthand, which was an ideal qualification for this post. He also continued to study harmony, counterpoint, piano and organ, working at these things daily, before and after his clerk&#x27;s job.

Rubbra&#x27;s early forays into chamber music composition included a violin and piano sonata for himself and his friend, Bertram Ablethorpe, and a piece for a local string quartet. He used to meet with the keen, young composer, William Alwyn, who was also from Northampton, to compare notes.

Rubbra was deeply affected by a sermon he heard given by a Chinese Christian missionary, Kuanglin Pao. He was inspired to write &quot;Chinese Impressions&quot; – a set of piano pieces, which he dedicated to the preacher. This was the beginning of a lifelong interest in things eastern.

At the age of 17, Rubbra decided to organise a concert devoted entirely to Cyril Scott&#x27;s music, with a singer, violinist, cellist and himself on the piano, at the Carnegie Hall in Northampton Library. This proved to be a very important decision which would change his life. The minister from Rubbra&#x27;s church attended the concert, and secretly sent a copy of the programme to Cyril Scott. The result of this was that Scott took Rubbra on as a pupil. Rubbra was able to obtain cheap rail travel because of his job with the railway, so he was able to get to Scott&#x27;s house by train, paying only a quarter of the usual fare. After a year or so, Rubbra gained a scholarship to University College, Reading. Gustav Holst became one of his teachers there. Both Scott and Holst had an interest in eastern philosophy and religion, inspiring Rubbra to take a further interest in the subject.

Holst also taught at the Royal College of Music and advised Rubbra to apply for an open scholarship there. His advice was followed and the place was secured. Before Rubbra&#x27;s last term at the college, he was unexpectedly invited to play the piano for the Arts League of Service Travelling Theatre on a six-week tour of Yorkshire, since their usual pianist had been taken ill. He accepted this offer despite this meaning that he missed his last term. The tour provided him with invaluable experience in playing and composing theatre music, which he never regretted and which stood him in good stead for his later dramatic work. In the mid-1920s Rubbra used to earn money playing piano for dancers from the Diaghilev Ballet. At around this time he became firm friends with Gerald Finzi.

In 1941, Rubbra was called up for army service. After 18 months he was given an office post, again because of his knowledge of shorthand and typing. While he was there, he ran a small orchestra assisted by a double-bass player from the BBC orchestra. The War Office asked him to form a piano trio to play classical chamber music to the troops. Rubbra was happy to oblige, and the trio, with William Pleeth the cellist, Joshua Glazier violinist and himself on the piano took six months acquiring a repertoire of chamber music. &quot;The Army Classical Music Group&quot;, was formed and later expanded to seven people. On one occasion an overzealous entertainment officer thought there would be a better audience by advertising with big posters for &quot;Ed Rub &amp; his seven piece Band&quot;. They travelled all over England and Scotland and then to Germany, with their own grand piano which, with its legs removed for transport, became a seat for them in the back of the transport lorry.

After the war, on 4 August 1947 (the Feast of St Dominic), Rubbra became a Roman Catholic, writing a special mass in celebration. Also at this time, the University of Oxford was forming a faculty of music. They invited Rubbra to be a lecturer there. After much thought, he accepted the post. From 1947 to 1968 Rubbra was a lecturer at the Music Faculty and a Fellow of Worcester College, Oxford. The army trio kept meeting, playing at clubs and broadcasting, for a number of years, but eventually Rubbra was too busy to continue with it.

It is a measure of the high esteem in which Rubbra was held in the 1940s, that his &quot;Sinfonia Concertante&quot; and his song &quot;Morning Watch&quot; were played alongside such works as Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, Kodály&#x27;s &quot;Missa Brevis&quot; and Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Job&quot;, at the 1948 Three Choirs Festival.

When Vaughan Williams heard that the University of Durham was going to confer an Honorary D.Mus on Rubbra in 1949, he wrote him a very short letter: &quot;I am delighted to hear of the honour which Durham University is conferring on itself.&quot;

Rubbra received a request from the BBC to write a piece for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The result was &quot;Ode to the Queen,&quot; for voice and orchestra, to Elizabethan words. In connection with the same occasion, he was invited by Benjamin Britten to contribute to a collaborative work, a set of &quot;Variations on an Elizabethan Theme&quot;. He initially accepted, but later withdrew; Britten then asked Arthur Oldham and Humphrey Searle to take his place.

On Rubbra&#x27;s retirement from Oxford, in 1968, he did not stop working; he merely took up more teaching at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama where his students included Michael Garrett and Christopher Gunning. Neither did he stop composing. Indeed, he kept up this activity right until the end of his life: he started a 12th Symphony in March 1985, less than a year before his death, but only one page of manuscript short score (bearing the opus number 164) was completed. He died in Gerrards Cross on 14 February 1986.

Ronald Stevenson summed up the style of Rubbra&#x27;s work rather succinctly when he wrote, &quot;In an age of fragmentation, Rubbra stands (with a few others) as a composer of a music of oneness&quot;.

Sir Adrian Boult commended Rubbra&#x27;s work by saying that he &quot;has never made any effort to popularize anything he has done, but he goes on creating masterpieces&quot;.

==Personal life==
Rubbra was married three times, firstly in 1925 to his landlady Lilian Duncan. This marriage was never consummated and in 1933 Rubbra married Antoinette Chaplin, a French violinist. They toured Italy together, as well as giving recitals in Paris and radio broadcasts. They had two sons, Francis (1935–2012) and Benedict (1938-2024, painter), with the marriage lasting into the late 1950s.

In the 1930s Rubbra was a pacifist and vegetarian but gave up vegetarianism during World War II whilst he was in the army out of fear of starvation. Although he became a devout Catholic through a mid-life conversion, he was also interested in Eastern thought and mysticism, going through a Buddhist phase.

In 1975, Rubbra married Colette Yardley, with whom he had had one son (born 1974) called Adrian. Colette was at the time of Adrian&#x27;s birth married to Rubbra&#x27;s neighbour Hugo Yardley.

==Compositions==
Rubbra did not base his composition on formal rules, preferring to work from an initial idea and discover the music as he composed. His style is more concerned with the melodic lines in his music than with the chords, and this gives his music a vocal feel. He found his method of composition, working from a single melodic idea and letting the music grow from that, to be very exciting.

===Symphonies===
It was not until 1937 that Rubbra&#x27;s first symphony was completed. Symphonies 2, 3 and 4 followed in quick succession, the fourth being completed in March 1942. He described them as being &#x27;different facets of one thought&#x27;, since each was a reaction to the last.

His fifth Symphony was started in August 1947. Enough time had elapsed since the fourth Symphony, to allow this new symphony to be unrelated. Grover recognises a &quot;sense of relaxation engendered by a greater flexibility in the handling of materials&quot; which sets this work apart from earlier symphonies. The sixth and seventh symphonies followed in 1954 and 1957.

Rubbra&#x27;s last four symphonies again show a change of approach. He himself identified this when he said, &quot;in much of my later music a particular musical interval rather than a key underlies the building of the structure&quot;. These symphonies were composed between 1968 and 1979. All are available on CD. Richard Hickox recorded the complete cycle of symphonies on Chandos Records.

===Vocal music===
The vast majority (42 of 59 works) of Rubbra&#x27;s choral works have religious or philosophical texts, in keeping with his interest in these subjects. His first choral work was his Op. 3, written in 1924, and his last was Op. 164, written in 1984, only two years before his death. He wrote for children&#x27;s voices and madrigals, as well as producing masses and motets, including the &quot;Nine Tenebrae Motets&quot;, Op. 72, setting the responsories for Maundy Thursday in an intensely dramatic manner. In 1948, he composed &quot;Missa Sancti Dominici&quot;, Op. 66, to celebrate his conversion to Roman Catholicism. The reason for this particular title is that he was received into the church on the Feast of St. Dominic, 4 August. His &quot;Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis&quot; in A flat is still performed in Anglican cathedrals and larger parish churches.

Rubbra&#x27;s songs are not well known, but, again they spanned his whole composing lifetime: &quot;Rosa Mundi&quot;, Op. 2, was the first published, in 1921; &quot;Fly Envious Time&quot;, Op. 148, was the last, in 1974, being inscribed &quot;in Memoriam Gerald Finzi&quot;. Fewer than half of them have the piano specified for their accompaniment, though only one is unaccompanied. The others have string quartet, string orchestra or harp as their chosen accompaniment, except for the three songs published as &quot;Ode to the Queen,&quot; which have full orchestral accompaniment.

===Chamber music===
Although Rubbra was a fine pianist, his works for solo piano occupy only a minor part of his output. He did, however, write diverse chamber music throughout his career. He considered that his Violin Sonata, Op. 31, which he wrote in 1932, was the first of his compositions to be taken seriously in the musical world. His First String Quartet was composed only a year later. For a long time Rubbra was not satisfied with this piece, although Ralph Vaughan Williams was very interested in it. Finally he thoroughly revised it, and published it in 1946, with an inscription to Vaughan Williams, and destroyed the original finale. Three other string quartets followed at long intervals. The last was written in 1977 in memory of Bennett Tarshish, a young American admirer of Rubbra&#x27;s work, who died in his thirties. This piece shows the same method of reliance on a certain interval or intervals (here the seventh) instead of a particular key, which is also evident in Rubbra&#x27;s later symphonies.

The Cello Sonata of 1946 was dedicated to William Pleeth (the cellist in The Army Classical Music Group) and his wife. It was sometimes performed by Jacqueline du Pré, who was a pupil of William Pleeth. Rubbra&#x27;s Second Piano Trio, Op. 138, was first performed by the members of The Army Classical Music Group, who got together again especially for this performance in 1970, though Glazier had now been replaced by Gruenberg.

The repertoire for recorder was both augmented and enhanced by several works composed by Rubbra. Foreman considers that these pieces are &quot;significant for their demonstration of an idiomatic recorder style which successfully places the instrument as an equal with other instruments&quot;. This recorder music was written for Carl Dolmetsch, son of Arnold Dolmetsch, and almost every piece makes reference to 16th-century music, for example, &quot;Passacaglia sopra &#x27;Plusieurs Regrets&quot;&#x27; for treble recorder and harpsichord.

Other chamber works in Rubbra&#x27;s oeuvre include those for oboe, cor anglais and viola.The Quartets have all appeared on the Dutton Epoch label.

===Other works===
Incidental music for several plays formed a small but significant part of Rubbra&#x27;s output. The longest of these is the unpublished score for &quot;Macbeth&quot;. In 1933, he wrote a one-act opera, still in manuscript, which he originally called &quot;Bee-bee-bei&quot;, but renamed &quot;The Shadow&quot;. It reflects his interest in the East, as it is set in Kashmir.

All three of his works for brass instruments were commissioned. One of them, &quot;Variations on &quot;The Shining River&quot;&quot;, was a test piece for the Brass Band Championships of Great Britain, 1958, held in the Royal Albert Hall.

Rubbra&#x27;s last completed work was his &quot;Sinfonietta&quot; for large string orchestra, Op. 163, which was commissioned by the Albany Symphony Orchestra, for performance in 1986 as part of the tricentennial celebrations of the founding of New York. The dedication is &quot;For Adrian and Julian&quot;, Julian [Yardley] (b. 1942) being Adrian&#x27;s elder brother and Rubbra&#x27;s stepson following his marriage to Adrian and Julian&#x27;s mother in 1975. The &quot;Sinfonietta&quot; received excellent press reviews .

Rubbra is also well known for his 1938 orchestration of Johannes Brahms&#x27;s piano work &quot;Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel&quot;. He also orchestrated Rachmaninov&#x27;s Prelude in G minor, though when this was recorded by Frederick Fennell and the London Pops Orchestra in 1959 for &#x27;Mercury&#x27;, he was not given due credit on the LP sleeve or label.

==Publications==
Rubbra wrote numerous articles during his lifetime, about both his own music and that of others, including Gerald Finzi, Constant Lambert, John Ireland, Paul Hindemith, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst, Benjamin Britten, Johann Sebastian Bach, Alexander Scriabin, Béla Bartók and Dmitri Shostakovich. In the middle of the twentieth century he wrote &quot;Gramophone Notes&quot; for &quot;The Month&quot;, a Catholic magazine published in England. He also made several speech recordings for the BBC.

<text>Arnold Eric Sevareid (November 26, 1912 – July 9, 1992) was an American author and CBS news journalist from 1939 to 1977. He was one of a group of elite war correspondents who were hired by CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow and nicknamed &quot;Murrow&#x27;s Boys.&quot; Sevareid was the first to report the Fall of Paris in 1940, when the city was captured by German forces during World War II.

Sevareid followed in Murrow&#x27;s footsteps as a commentator on the CBS Evening News for thirteen years, for which he was recognized with Emmy and Peabody Awards.

== Early life ==
Sevareid was born in central North Dakota at Velva to Alfred Eric and Clara Pauline Elizabeth Sevareid (née Hougen). The town&#x27;s economy was largely dependent on wheat farming. According to Sevareid, his neighbors were extremely charitable towards friends but very wary of outsiders; it was an egalitarian but politically conservative community. After the failure of the bank in Velva in 1925, his family moved to nearby Minot, and then to Minneapolis, Minnesota, settling on 30th Avenue North. He attended Central High School in Minneapolis. Sevareid graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1935. A descendant of Norwegian immigrants, he preserved a strong bond with the country of Norway throughout his life.

Sevareid was adventurous from a young age; several days after he graduated from Central High School in 1930, he and his friend Walter Port embarked on an expedition sponsored by the &quot;Minneapolis Star&quot; to travel by canoe from Minneapolis to York Factory, on Hudson Bay. They canoed up the Minnesota River and its tributary, the Little Minnesota River, to Browns Valley, portaged to Lake Traverse, and descended the Bois des Sioux River to the Red River of the North, which led to Lake Winnipeg. They then went down the Nelson River, Gods River, and Hayes River to Hudson Bay, a trip of . Sevareid&#x27;s book &quot;Canoeing with the Cree&quot; (1935) was the result of this canoe trip and is still in print.

== Early career ==
At age 18, Sevareid entered journalism as a reporter for the &quot;Minneapolis Journal&quot; while he was a student at the University of Minnesota in political science. At the &quot;Journal&quot;, he wrote a five-part series on the Silver Shirts. He was disappointed with the way the editors portrayed the organization as ridiculous rather than a legitimate political threat. He received many personal threats of physical force in response to the story, but believed that the people issuing them were too cowardly to follow through.

He continued his studies abroad, first in London, and then at the Sorbonne University in Paris, where he also worked as an editor for United Press. Sevareid then became city editor of the &quot;Paris Herald Tribune&quot;, and later joined CBS as a foreign correspondent based in Paris.

Sevareid broadcast the Fall of Paris and followed the French government from there to Bordeaux and then Vichy before he left France for London and later Washington, D.C. He was appointed as CBS&#x27;s Washington bureau chief in July 1942.

He wrote about the Plains influence on his life in his early memoir, &quot;Not So Wild A Dream&quot; (1946). The book is still in print and covers his life in Velva, his family, the Hudson Bay trip, his hitchhiking around the U.S., mining in the Sierra Nevada, the Great Depression years, his early journalism, and (especially) his experiences in World War II.

== Wartime reporting ==
=== Relationship with Edward Murrow ===
Sevareid&#x27;s work during World War II, with Edward Murrow as one of the original Murrow&#x27;s Boys, was at the forefront of broadcasting. In 1940, he was the first to report on the Fall of France. Shortly afterward, he joined Murrow to report on the Battle of Britain. Later, Sevareid would refer fondly to the early years working with Murrow: &quot;We were like a young band of brothers in those early radio days with Murrow.&quot; In his final broadcast with CBS, in 1977, he would call Murrow the man who &quot;invented me.&quot;

=== Rescue in Burma ===
On August 2, 1943, Sevareid was on board a Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando that, having taken off from Assam in India, developed engine trouble over Burma while it was on a Hump airlift mission. He grabbed a bottle of Carew&#x27;s gin before he parachuted out of the plane. The U.S. Army Air Forces formed a search and rescue team to bring the group out from behind enemy lines. The operatives parachuted in, located the party, and evacuated them safely to India, for which John Paton Davies Jr. later won the Medal of Freedom. Davies was a U.S. diplomat who, having been a passenger himself, initially led the group away from the crash site and out of harm&#x27;s way before the rescuers arrived.

=== Yugoslavia ===
In Yugoslavia, Sevareid later reported on Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Yugoslav Partisans.

== Later career ==

After the war, Sevareid continued to work for CBS. He had begun his own program, &quot;Eric Sevareid and the News&quot;, on June 27, 1942, on CBS; it ran for five minutes, starting at 8:55 (ET) on Saturdays and Sundays. In 1946, he reported on the founding of the United Nations and then penned &quot;Not So Wild a Dream&quot; (University of Missouri Press, 1946). The book, whose title comes from part of the closing passage of Norman Corwin&#x27;s radio play &quot;On a Note of Triumph&quot;, appeared in eleven printings and became one of the primary sources on the lives of the generation of Americans who had lived through the Great Depression, only to confront the horrors of World War II. In the 1976 edition of the book, Sevareid wrote, &quot;It was a lucky stroke of timing to have been born and lived as an American in this last generation. It was good fortune to be a journalist in Washington, now the single news headquarters in the world since ancient Rome. But we are not Rome; the world is too big, too varied.&quot;

Sevareid always considered himself a writer first and often felt uneasy behind a microphone and even less comfortable on television. Nonetheless, he worked extensively for CBS News on television for decades after the war. During the middle and the end of 1950s, Sevareid found himself on television as the host and science reporter of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Conquest&quot;. He also served as the head of the CBS Washington bureau from 1946 to 1954 and was one of the early critics of Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s anticommunism tactics.
=== European correspondent ===
Sevareid wound up the 1950s as CBS&#x27;s roving European correspondent from 1959 to 1961. He contributed stories to &quot;CBS Reports&quot; during that time and served as moderator on a number of CBS series such as &quot;Town Meeting of the World&quot;, &quot;The Great Challenge&quot;, &quot;Where We Stand&quot;, and &quot;Years of Crisis&quot;. Sevareid also appeared in or on CBS coverage of every presidential election from 1948 to 1976, the year before his retirement.

=== Final interview with Adlai Stevenson ===
One of Sevareid&#x27;s biggest scoops from this time period was his 1965 exclusive interview with Adlai Stevenson II shortly before Stevenson&#x27;s death. The interview was not broadcast over CBS but instead appeared in &quot;Look&quot; magazine.

=== &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; appearances ===
On November 22, 1963, Sevareid joined Walter Cronkite on CBS television with a commentary about the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the road ahead for the new president, Lyndon Johnson. From 1964 to his 1977 retirement from the network, Sevareid&#x27;s two-minute segments on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; (anchored by Cronkite) inspired his admirers to dub him &quot;The Grey Eminence.&quot;

During his long run as a commentator, his segments earned both Emmy and Peabody Awards. In 1987, he was honored as an inductee into the Academy&#x27;s Fourth Hall of Fame. Those who disagreed with his views nicknamed him &quot;Eric Severalsides.&quot; Sevareid recognized his own biases, which caused some to disagree with him vehemently. He said that as he had grown older, he had tended to become more conservative in foreign policy and liberal in domestic policy.

His commentary touched on many of the day&#x27;s important issues. After a 1966 trip to South Vietnam, he commented that prolonging the war would be unwise and that the U.S. would be better off pursuing a negotiated settlement. He also helped keep alive another Murrow tradition at CBS that began with the interview show &quot;Person to Person&quot;. On &quot;Conversations with Eric Sevareid&quot;, he interviewed such famous newsmakers as West German Chancellor Willy Brandt and novelist Leo Rosten. In somewhat of a spoof of that tradition, he also had a conversation with King George III, portrayed by Peter Ustinov, titled &quot;The Last King in America&quot;.

In his final &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; editorial, on November 30, 1977, Severaid paid tribute to his colleagues and mentors, noting those who died, including Walter Lippmann and Edward R. Murrow, the latter of whom Severaid described as &quot;the man who invented me.&quot; Severaid ended his farewell by thanking the American public for their engagement with his work, noting that the work of journalism, in his eyes, involves the &quot;perception of honesty and fair intent.&quot;

Walter Cronkite ended the broadcast by celebrating Severaid as, in his view, &quot;one of the finest essayists of the century.&quot;

Sevareid later narrated the American history series &quot;Between The Wars&quot;. In 1981, Sevareid hosted a documentary series on PBS, entitled &quot;Enterprise&quot;, a profile on how America portrays business. The following year, he hosted the syndicated newsmagazine program &quot;Eric Sevareid&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;.

He made a guest appearance as himself in a 1980 episode of the sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot; and also played himself in the 1983 space flight film &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Sevareid married the former Lois Finger. They had twin sons, Peter and Michael, born in Paris while Sevareid was stationed there as a war correspondent for CBS.

Sevareid&#x27;s second marriage was to Belen Marshall. They had a daughter, Cristina, born in New York while he was working as a commentator at the New York bureau.

== Death ==
Sevareid died of stomach cancer in Washington, D.C., on July 9, 1992, at age 79.

<text>Software blacklisting is a tool used by manufacturers of software and music on CD and DVD to prevent copying.

Essentially the software on the disc will audit the user&#x27;s computer for certain types of virtual CD and CD authoring software, or for debugging software used by warez groups to create patches (known as cracks) that bypass copy protection schemes. If blacklisted software is found then certain actions are taken by the software on the game or music disc. Examples would be allowing the copying of the game to take place, but crashing the copied game when attempting to start it; allowing copies of games that will malfunction in subtle ways and simply disallowing the game to be run while this software exists.

This software blacklisting can be seen as a countermeasure to virtual CD/CD burning software used to bypass copy protection schemes such as SecuROM, SafeDisc and LaserLock.

In order to copy the CD, the user may have to copy the disc on another computer (real or virtual), uninstall the blacklisted software or wait for an update of the blacklisted software, which will have a countermeasure to the game or music disc&#x27;s own blacklisting countermeasure.

<text>In functional analysis, the Friedrichs extension is a canonical self-adjoint extension of a non-negative densely defined symmetric operator. It is named after the mathematician Kurt Friedrichs. This extension is particularly useful in situations where an operator may fail to be essentially self-adjoint or whose essential self-adjointness is difficult to show.

An operator &quot;T&quot; is non-negative if

:formula_1

==Examples==

Example. Multiplication by a non-negative function on an &quot;L&quot;2 space is a non-negative self-adjoint operator.

Example. Let &quot;U&quot; be an open set in R&quot;n&quot;. On &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;U&quot;) we consider differential operators of the form

:formula_2

where the functions &quot;a&quot;&quot;i j&quot; are infinitely differentiable real-valued functions on &quot;U&quot;. We consider &quot;T&quot; acting on the dense subspace of infinitely differentiable complex-valued functions of compact support, in symbols

:formula_3

If for each &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot; the &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix

:formula_4

is non-negative semi-definite, then &quot;T&quot; is a non-negative operator. This means (a) that the matrix is hermitian and

:formula_5

for every choice of complex numbers &quot;c&quot;1, ..., &quot;c&quot;n. This is proved using integration by parts.

These operators are elliptic although in general elliptic operators may not be non-negative. They are however bounded from below.

== Definition of Friedrichs extension ==

The definition of the Friedrichs extension is based on the theory of closed positive forms on Hilbert spaces. 
If &quot;T&quot; is non-negative, then

:formula_6

is a sesquilinear form on dom &quot;T&quot; and

:formula_7

Thus Q defines an inner product on dom &quot;T&quot;. Let &quot;H&quot;1 be the completion of dom &quot;T&quot; with respect to Q. &quot;H&quot;1 is an abstractly defined space; for instance its elements can be represented as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of elements of dom &quot;T&quot;. It is not obvious that all elements in &quot;H&quot;1 can be identified with elements of &quot;H&quot;. However, the following can be proved:

The canonical inclusion

:formula_8

extends to an &quot;injective&quot; continuous map &quot;H&quot;1 → &quot;H&quot;. We regard &quot;H&quot;1 as a subspace of &quot;H&quot;.

Define an operator &quot;A&quot; by

: formula_9

In the above formula, &quot;bounded&quot; is relative to the topology on &quot;H&quot;1 inherited from &quot;H&quot;. By the Riesz representation theorem applied to the linear functional φξ extended to &quot;H&quot;, there is a unique &quot;A&quot; ξ ∈ &quot;H&quot; such that

:formula_10

Theorem. &quot;A&quot; is a non-negative self-adjoint operator such that &quot;T&quot;1=&quot;A&quot; - I extends &quot;T&quot;.

&quot;T&quot;1 is the Friedrichs extension of &quot;T&quot;.

Another way to obtain this extension is as follows. Let :formula_11 be the bounded inclusion operator. The inclusion is a bounded injective with dense image. Hence formula_12 is a bounded injective operator with dense image, where formula_13 is the adjoint of formula_14 as an operator between abstract Hilbert spaces. Therefore the operator formula_15 is a non-negative self-adjoint operator whose domain is the image of formula_16. Then formula_17 extends T.

== Krein&#x27;s theorem on non-negative self-adjoint extensions ==

M. G. Krein has given an elegant characterization of all non-negative self-adjoint extensions of a non-negative symmetric operator &quot;T&quot;.

If &quot;T&quot;, &quot;S&quot; are non-negative self-adjoint operators, write

:formula_18

if, and only if,

* formula_19
* formula_20

Theorem. There are unique self-adjoint extensions &quot;T&quot;min and &quot;T&quot;max of any non-negative symmetric operator &quot;T&quot; such that

:formula_21

and every non-negative self-adjoint extension &quot;S&quot; of &quot;T&quot; is between &quot;T&quot;min and &quot;T&quot;max, i.e.

:formula_22

<text>Corabia () is a small Danube port located in Olt County, Oltenia, Romania, which used to be part of the now-dissolved Romanați County before World War II. Across the Danube from Corabia lies the Bulgarian village of Gigen.

==History==
Beneath Corabia, around the former village of Celei, lie the remains of Sucidava, an ancient Dacian and Daco-Roman town and fortress. Near the town, Emperor Constantine the Great built the longest European bridge over the Danube (). The bridge was destroyed during the Avar invasions, probably in the 7th century. The ruins also contain an old Roman bath and an old basilica. The name &quot;Corabia&quot; reflects the fact that the new settlement was built from the remains of a wrecked Genoan ship (&quot;corabia&quot; is the Romanian language term for &quot;sailing ship&quot;, specifically used for &quot;galley&quot;). It became a thriving port in the 1880s.

Under the communist regime, Corabia developed as a considerable manufacturing town, with a sugar mill, furniture factory, tannery, a fiber manufacturing plant, and various other facilities. However, in more recent times the town&#x27;s population has dwindled. Many inhabitants have migrated to larger towns in the wake of the closure of many of Corabia&#x27;s factories.

==Geography==
Corabia is located in the southern part of Olt County, on the left bank of the Danube, on the border with Bulgaria. It administers two villages, Tudor Vladimirescu and Vârtopu. The town houses a football club, several shops and bars, the remains of the Roman &quot;castrum&quot; &quot;Sucidava&quot;, dating back to the Roman period and featuring the &quot;Secret Fountain&quot; (an unusual piece of engineering); the Holy Trinity Orthodox Cathedral (one of the largest buildings of its kind in Romania), as well a monumental statue in the middle of the town square commemorating the use of Corabia&#x27;s facilities in the initial attack during the Romanian War of Independence of 1877. Corabia also has an important archaeological museum with, &quot;inter alia&quot;, a remarkable collection of Roman pottery. From the town harbour one can make trips along the Danube, with stops at the nearby Băloi Island.

<doc id="884363" wikidata="Q6547509" url="?curid=884363" title="The Lilac Domino">
<text>Der lila Domino (The Lilac Domino) is an operetta in three acts composed by Charles Cuvillier. The original German libretto is by Emmerich von Gatti and Bela Jenbach, about a gambling count who falls in love at a masquerade ball with a noblewoman wearing a lilac domino mask.

The operetta achieved far greater popularity in Britain and America than it did in Germany or France. Although &quot;The Lilac Domino&quot; became Cuvillier&#x27;s greatest international hit, he won success in his native Paris with the operetta &quot;La reine s&#x27;amuse&quot; (1912; &quot;The Naughty Princess&quot; in London, 1920). He was popular in Germany before the First World War, and &quot;Der lila Domino&quot; was the first of two operettas that he wrote for German theatres.

==Performance history==
&quot;Der lila Domino&quot; was first performed in Leipzig, Germany, on February 3, 1912, where it was a failure. Although produced with success in the U.S. (1914) and outstanding success in the UK (1918), the work was not seen in France until 1947, when a production was mounted at Mulhouse, with a cast including Willy Clément.

== English adaptations ==

=== Broadway version ===
Entitled &quot;The Lilac Domino&quot;, with an English libretto by Harry B. Smith, lyrics by Robert B. Smith, and additional songs by Howard Carr and Donovan Parsons, it opened on Broadway at the 44th Street Theatre on October 28, 1914, produced by Andreas Dippel. It received favourable notices and ran for 109 performances, starring Eleanor Painter and the English baritone Wilfrid Douthitt, followed by a North American tour. In the U.S. and UK versions, the setting was changed from Nice, France to Palm Beach, Florida.

==== Broadway cast, 1914 ====
*Vicomte de Brissac – George Curzon
*Georgine – Eleanor Painter
*Elledon – James Harrod
*Leonie D&#x27;Andorcet – René Detling
*Count André de St. Amand – Wilfrid Douthitt
*Prosper – John E. Hazzard
*Casimir – Robert O&#x27;Connor
*Baroness de Villiers – Jeanne Maubourg
*Istvan – Harry Herrosen

=== London version ===
A new version was presented in London, with revised dialogue by S. J. Adair Fitzgerald, opening at the Empire Theatre on February 21, 1918, and running there until September 27, 1919. After a brief break, the production transferred to the Palace Theatre in October 1919. The piece ran for a total of 747 performances, closing on December 13, 1919, an extraordinarily long run at that time. The London cast starred Clara Butterworth and Jamieson Dodds. It became the third of London&#x27;s great World War I hits after &quot;Chu Chin Chow&quot; (1916) and &quot;The Maid of the Mountains&quot; (1917). Some of its success in London was due to interpolated numbers by the Empire Theatre&#x27;s musical director, Howard Carr, a nephew of the composer Howard Talbot. One newspaper review commented, &quot;The music throughout is beautiful and even if the whole company were to dispense with costumes and sit in a ring like Christy Minstrels, the &quot;Lilac Domino&quot; would be a success&quot;. To which the humorous magazine &quot;Punch&quot; responded, &quot;We can well believe it.&quot;

==== London cast, 1918 ====
*Cornelius Cleveden – R. Stuart Pigott
*Leonie Forde – Josephine Earle
*Elliston Deyn – Vincent Sullivan
*Prosper Woodhouse – Frank Lalor
*Norman J. Calmain – Edwin Wilson
*The Hon. Aubrey D&#x27;Aubigny – Jamieson Dodds
*Carabana – Dallas Anderson
*Georgine – Clara Butterworth
*Baroness de Villiers – Andrée Corday
Pigott, who played the role of the heroine&#x27;s millionaire father, died suddenly in his dressing room, during the run, having not missed a single performance of the first 565.

&quot;The Lilac Domino&quot; remained in the British musical theatre repertoire until after World War II, also touring in Britain, Australia and elsewhere. Jamieson Doods, from the London cast, led the first Australian tour in 1920. Notable revivals included a 1944 production at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London starring Pat Taylor as Georgine, with a cast including Leo Franklyn, Bernard Clifton, Graham Payn and Elizabeth French. In 1953 a revised book was prepared by H. F. Maltby, which proved popular with amateur groups and removed the American elements of the original English version, restoring the setting to France.

===Film adaptation===
A film version, &quot;The Lilac Domino&quot;, was released in the UK in 1937 and in the U.S. in 1940, starring Michael Bartlett as Count Anatole and June Knight as Shari, the Lilac Domino. The setting was changed to Budapest.

==Synopsis==
At Hotel Parnasse in Nice, during Carnival, at a masquerade ball, everyone is amazed by news that the wealthy old Lyons silk merchant Gaston Le Sage has found a new young bride, a widow named Leonie Lemmonnier. However, Leonie is more interested in Gaston&#x27;s shy young step-nephew, Paul, who has been promised to Gaston&#x27;s 18-year-old daughter Georgine. Georgine arrives masked and identified only as the &quot;Lilac Domino&quot;. Meanwhile, three young men have lost heavily at cards. They agree that one must seek a wealthy bride in order to repay their gambling debts. Count André de St. Armand is chosen by the roll of dice to do the marrying. Fortunately, he has already fallen in love with a girl in a lilac domino. However, Georgine learns of the dice game, believes that André is wooing her only for her money, and breaks things off with him even though she returns his love. A gypsy violinist helps to solve the complications and unite the lovers. All ends happily.

<text>The [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] (in French: &quot;le Conseil exécutif de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador&quot;, but informally and more commonly, the Cabinet of Newfoundland and Labrador, and in French: &quot;le Cabinet de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador&quot;) is the cabinet headed by the lieutenant governor and composed of the ministers in office. The Executive Council is composed only of ministers in office, and is the official body by which Cabinet&#x27;s constitutional advice is given to the lieutenant governor.

The Executive Council is thus similar in structure and role to the federal King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, though smaller in size, and, whereas the federal cabinet is a committee of the King&#x27;s Privy Council, the Executive Council of Newfoundland and Labrador and Cabinet of Newfoundland one and the same. Also, unlike the King&#x27;s Privy Council, members of the Executive Council of Newfoundland and Labrador are not appointed for life, and are not entitled to post-nominal letters due to their position.

The Lieutenant-Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador, as representative of the King in Right of Newfoundland and Labrador, heads the council, and is referred to as the Governor-in-Council. Most cabinet ministers are the head of a ministry, but this is not always the case. The Lieutenant Governor, advised by the Premier, determines which portfolios will be created. Ministers organize their department and present legislation for the new ministry if none exists. Other members of the Cabinet, who advise, or minister, the vice-regal, are selected by the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador and appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor.

The Executive Council has offices and meetings at Confederation Building East Block.

==Current Cabinet==
Members are listed in order of precedence. The Table of Precedence prescribes that order of precedence within this group be determined in order of appointment to Executive Council with ties broken by order of election to the House of Assembly. On July 19, 2024, Premier Furey shuffled his cabinet.

<text>Ely Cathedral, formally the , is an Anglican cathedral in the city of Ely, Cambridgeshire, England.

The cathedral can trace its origin to the abbey founded in Ely in 672 by St Æthelthryth (also called Etheldreda). The earliest parts of the present building date to 1083, and it was granted cathedral status in 1109. Until the Reformation, the cathedral was dedicated to St Etheldreda and St Peter, at which point it was refounded as the Cathedral Church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Ely. It is the cathedral of the Diocese of Ely, which covers most of Cambridgeshire and western Norfolk, Essex, and Bedfordshire. It is the seat of the Bishop of Ely and a suffragan bishop, the Bishop of Huntingdon.

Architecturally, Ely Cathedral is outstanding both for its scale and stylistic details. Having been built in a monumental Romanesque style, the galilee porch, lady chapel and choir were rebuilt in an exuberant Decorated Gothic. Its most notable feature is the central octagonal tower, with lantern above, which provides a unique internal space and, along with the West Tower, dominates the surrounding landscape. 

The cathedral is a major tourist destination, receiving around 250,000 visitors per year, and sustains a daily pattern of morning and evening services.

==Anglo-Saxon abbey==

Ely Abbey was founded in 672, by Æthelthryth (St Etheldreda), a daughter of Anna, King of East Anglia. It was a mixed community of men and women. Later accounts suggest her three successor abbesses were also members of the East Anglian Royal family. In later centuries, the depredations of Viking raids may have resulted in its destruction, or at least the loss of all records. It is possible that some monks provided a continuity through to its refoundation in 970, under the Rule of St Benedict. The precise siting of Æthelthryth&#x27;s original monastery is not known. The presence of her relics, bolstered by the growing body of literature on her life and miracles, was a major driving force in the success of the refounded abbey. The church building of 970 was within or near the nave of the present building, and was progressively demolished from 1102 alongside the construction of the Norman church. The obscure Ermenilda of Ely also became an abbess sometime after her husband, Wulfhere of Mercia, died in 675.

==Present-day church== 

The cathedral is built from stone quarried from Barnack in Northamptonshire (bought from Peterborough Abbey, whose lands included the quarries, for 8,000 eels a year), with decorative elements carved from Purbeck Marble and local clunch. The plan of the building is cruciform (cross-shaped), with an additional transept at the western end. The total length is , and the nave at over long remains one of the longest in Britain. The west tower is high. The unique Octagon &#x27;Lantern Tower&#x27; is wide and is high. Internally, from the floor to the central roof boss the lantern is high. The cathedral is known locally as &quot;the ship of the Fens&quot;, because of its prominent position above the surrounding flat landscape.

===Norman abbey church===
Having a pre-Norman history spanning 400 years and a re-foundation in 970, Ely over the course of the next hundred years had become one of England&#x27;s most successful Benedictine abbeys, with a famous saint, treasures, library, book production of the highest order and lands exceeded only by Glastonbury. However the imposition of Norman rule was particularly problematic at Ely. Newly arrived Normans such as Picot of Cambridge were taking possession of abbey lands, there was appropriation of daughter monasteries such as Eynesbury by French monks, and interference by the Bishop of Lincoln was undermining its status. All this was exacerbated when, in 1071, Ely became a focus of English resistance, through such people as Hereward the Wake, culminating in the Siege of Ely, for which the abbey suffered substantial fines.
Under the Normans almost every English cathedral and major abbey was rebuilt from the 1070s onwards. If Ely was to maintain its status then it had to initiate its own building work, and the task fell to Abbot Simeon. He was the brother of Walkelin, the then Bishop of Winchester, and had himself been the prior at Winchester Cathedral when the rebuilding began there in 1079. In 1083, a year after Simeon&#x27;s appointment as abbot of Ely, and when he was 90 years old, building work began. The years since the conquest had been turbulent for the Abbey, but the unlikely person of an aged Norman outsider effectively took sides with the Ely monks, reversed the decline in the abbey&#x27;s fortunes, and found the resources, administrative capacity, identity and purpose to begin a mighty new building.

The design had many similarities to Winchester, a cruciform plan with central crossing tower, aisled transepts, a three-storey elevation and a semi-circular apse at the east end. It was one of the largest buildings under construction north of the Alps at the time. The first phase of construction took in the eastern arm of the church, and the north and south transepts. However, a significant break in the way the masonry is laid indicates that, with the transepts still unfinished, there was an unplanned halt to construction that lasted several years. It would appear that when Abbott Simeon died in 1093, an extended interregnum caused all work to cease. The administration of Ranulf Flambard may have been to blame. He illegally kept various posts unfilled, including that of Abbot of Ely, so he could appropriate the income. In 1099 he got himself appointed Bishop of Durham, in 1100 Abbot Richard was appointed to Ely and building work resumed. It is Abbot Richard who asserted Ely&#x27;s independence from the Diocese of Lincoln, and pressed for it to be made a diocese in its own right, with the abbey church as its cathedral. Although Abbot Richard died in 1107, his successor Hervey le Breton was able to achieve this and become the first Bishop of Ely in 1109. This period at the start of the twelfth century was when Ely re-affirmed its link with its Anglo-Saxon past. The struggle for independence coincided with the period when resumption of building work required the removal of the shrines from the old building and the translation of the relics into the new church. This appears to have allowed, in the midst of a Norman-French hierarchy, an unexpectedly enthusiastic development of the cult of these pre-Norman saints and benefactors.
The Norman east end and the whole of the central area of the crossing are now entirely gone, but the architecture of the transepts survives in a virtually complete state, to give a good impression of how it would have looked. Massive walls pierced by Romanesque arches would have formed aisles running around all sides of the choir and transepts. Three tiers of archways rise from the arcaded aisles. Galleries with walkways could be used for liturgical processions, and above that is the Clerestory with a passage within the width of the wall.

Construction of the nave was underway from around 1115, and roof timbers dating to 1120 suggest that at least the eastern portion of the nave roof was in place by then. The great length of the nave required that it was tackled in phases and after completing four bays, sufficient to securely buttress the crossing tower and transepts, there was a planned pause in construction. By 1140 the nave had been completed together with the western transepts and west tower up to triforium level, in the fairly plain early Romanesque style of the earlier work. Another pause now occurred, for over 30 years, and when it resumed, the new mason found ways to integrate the earlier architectural elements with the new ideas and richer decorations of early Gothic.

===The West Tower===
The half-built west tower and upper parts of the two western transepts were completed under Bishop Geoffrey Ridel (1174–89), to create an exuberant west front, richly decorated with intersecting arches and complex mouldings. The new architectural details were used systematically to the higher storeys of the tower and transepts. Rows of trefoil heads and use of pointed instead of semicircular arches, results in a west front with a high level of orderly uniformity.

Originally the west front had transepts running symmetrically either side of the west tower. Stonework details on the tower show that an octagonal tower was part of the original design, although the current western octagonal tower was installed in 1400. Numerous attempts were made, during all phases of its construction to correct problems from subsidence in areas of soft ground at the western end of the cathedral. In 1405–1407, to cope with the extra weight from the octagonal tower, four new arches were added at the west crossing to strengthen the tower. The extra weight of these works may have added to the problem, as at the end of the fifteenth century the north-west transept collapsed. A great sloping mass of masonry was built to buttress the remaining walls, which remain in their broken-off state on the north side of the tower.

===Galilee Porch===
The Galilee Porch is now the principal entrance into the cathedral for visitors. Its original liturgical functions are unclear, but its location at the west end meant it may have been used as a chapel for penitents, a place where liturgical processions could gather, or somewhere the monks could hold business meetings with women, who were not permitted into the abbey. It also has a structural role in buttressing the west tower. The walls stretch over two storeys, but the upper storey now has no roof, it having been removed early in the nineteenth century. Its construction dating is also uncertain. Records suggest it was initiated by Bishop Eustace (1197–1215), and it is a notable example of Early English Gothic style. But there are doubts about just how early, especially as Eustace had taken refuge in France in 1208, and had no access to his funds for the next 3 years. George Gilbert Scott argued that details of its decoration, particularly the &#x27;syncopated arches&#x27; and the use of Purbeck marble shafts, bear comparison with St Hugh&#x27;s Choir, Lincoln Cathedral, and the west porch at St Albans, which both predate Eustace, whereas the foliage carvings and other details offer a date after 1220, suggesting it could be a project taken up, or re-worked by Bishop Hugh of Northwold.

===Presbytery and East end===

The first major reworking of an element of the Norman building was undertaken by Hugh of Northwold (bishop 1229–54). The eastern arm had been only four bays, running from the choir (then located at the crossing itself) to the high altar and the shrine to Etheldreda. In 1234 Northwold began an eastward addition of six further bays, which were built over 17 years, in a richly ornamented style with extensive use of Purbeck marble pillars and foliage carvings. It was built using the same bay dimensions, wall thicknesses and elevations as the Norman parts of the nave, but with an Early English Gothic style that makes it &#x27;the most refined and richly decorated English building of its period&#x27;. St Etheldreda&#x27;s remains were translated to a new shrine immediately east of the high altar within the new structure, and on completion of these works in 1252 the cathedral was reconsecrated in the presence of King Henry III and Prince Edward. As well as a greatly expanded presbytery, the new east end had the effect of inflating still further the significance of St Etheldreda&#x27;s shrine. Surviving fragments of the shrine pedestal suggest its decoration was similar to the interior walls of the Galilee porch. The relics of the saints Wihtburh, Seaxburh (sisters of St Etheldreda) and Ermenilda (daughter of St Seaxburh of Ely) would also have been accommodated, and the new building provided much more space for pilgrims to visit the shrines, via a door in the North Transept. The presbytery has subsequently been used for the burials and memorials of over 100 individuals connected with the abbey and cathedral.

===Lady Chapel===

In 1321, under the sacrist Alan of Walsingham, work began on a large free-standing Lady Chapel, linked to the north aisle of the chancel by a covered walkway. The chapel is long and wide, and was built in an exuberant &#x27;Decorated&#x27; Gothic style over the course of the next 30 years. Masons and finances were unexpectedly required for the main church from 1322, which must have slowed the progress of the chapel. The north and south wall each have five bays, comprising large traceried windows separated by pillars each of which has eight substantial niches and canopies which once held statues.

Below the window line, and running round three sides of the chapel is an arcade of richly decorated &#x27;nodding ogees&#x27;, with Purbeck marble pillars, creating scooped out seating booths. There are three arches per bay plus a grander one for each main pillar, each with a projecting pointed arch covering a subdividing column topped by a statue of a bishop or king. Above each arch is a pair of spandrels containing carved scenes which create a cycle of 93 carved relief sculptures of the life and miracles of the Virgin Mary. The carvings and sculptures would all have been painted. The window glass would all have been brightly coloured with major schemes perhaps of biblical narratives, of which a few small sections have survived. At the reformation, the edict to remove images from the cathedral was carried out very thoroughly by Bishop Thomas Goodrich. The larger statues have gone. The relief scenes were built into the wall, so each face or statue was individually hacked off, but leaving many finely carved details, and numerous puzzles as to what the original scenes showed. After the reformation it was redeployed as the parish church (Holy Trinity) for the town, a situation which continued up to 1938.
In 2000 a life-size statue of the Virgin Mary by David Wynne was installed above the lady chapel altar. The statue was criticised by local people and the cathedral dean said he had been inundated with letters of complaint.

===Octagon===
The central octagonal tower, with its vast internal open space and its pinnacles and lantern above, forms the most distinctive and celebrated feature of the cathedral. However, what Pevsner describes as Ely&#x27;s &#x27;greatest individual achievement of architectural genius&#x27; came about through a disaster at the centre of the cathedral. On the night of 12–13 February 1322, possibly as a result of digging foundations for the Lady Chapel, the Norman central crossing tower collapsed. Work on the Lady Chapel was suspended as attention transferred to dealing with this disaster. Instead of being replaced by a new tower on the same ground plan, the crossing was enlarged to an octagon, removing all four of the original tower piers and absorbing the adjoining bays of the nave, chancel and transepts to define an open area far larger than the square base of the original tower. The construction of this unique and distinctive feature was overseen by Alan of Walsingham. The extent of his influence on the design continues to be a matter of debate, as are the reasons such a radical step was taken. Mistrust of the soft ground under the failed tower piers may have been a major factor in moving all the weight of the new tower further out.

The large stone octagonal tower, with its eight internal archways, leads up to timber vaulting that appears to allow the large glazed timber lantern to balance on their slender struts. The roof and lantern are actually held up by a complex timber structure above the vaulting which could not be built in this way today because there are no trees big enough. The central lantern, also octagonal in form, but with angles offset from the great Octagon, has panels showing pictures of musical angels, which can be opened, with access from the Octagon roof-space, so that real choristers can sing from on high. More wooden vaulting forms the lantern roof. At the centre is a wooden boss carved from a single piece of oak, showing Christ in Majestry. The elaborate joinery and timberwork was brought about by William Hurley, master carpenter in the royal service.
It is unclear what damage was caused to the Norman chancel by the fall of the tower, but the three remaining bays were reconstructed under Bishop John Hotham (1316–1337) in an ornate Decorated style with flowing tracery. Structural evidence shows that this work was a remodelling rather than a total rebuilding. New choirstalls with carved misericords and canopy work were installed beneath the octagon, in a similar position to their predecessors. Work was resumed on the Lady Chapel, and the two westernmost bays of Northwold&#x27;s presbytery were adapted by unroofing the triforia so as to enhance the lighting of Etheldreda&#x27;s shrine. Starting at about the same time the remaining lancet windows of the aisles and triforia of the presbytery were gradually replaced by broad windows with flowing tracery. At the same period extensive work took place on the monastic buildings, including the construction of the elegant chapel of Prior Crauden.

===Chantry Chapels===
In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries elaborate chantry chapels were inserted in the easternmost bays of the presbytery aisles, on the north for Bishop John Alcock (1486–1500) and on the south for Bishop Nicholas West (1515–33).

John Alcock was born in around 1430, the son of a Hull merchant, but achieved high office in both church and state. Amongst his many duties and posts he was given charge of Edward IV&#x27;s sons, who became known as the Princes in the Tower. That Alcock faithfully served Edward IV and his sons as well Henry VII adds to the mystery of how their fate was kept secret. Appointed bishop of Rochester and then Worcester by Edward IV, he was also declared &#x27;Lord President of Wales&#x27; in 1476. On Henry VII&#x27;s victory over Richard III in 1485, Alcock became interim Lord Chancellor and in 1486 was appointed Bishop of Ely. As early as 1476 he had endowed a chantry for his parents at Hull, but the resources Ely put at his disposal allowed him to found Jesus College, Cambridge and build his own fabulous chantry chapel in an ornate style. The statue niches with their architectural canopies are crammed so chaotically together that some of the statues never got finished as they were so far out of sight. Others, although completed, were overlooked by the destructions of the reformation, and survived when all the others were destroyed. The extent that the chapel is squashed in, despite cutting back parts of the Norman walls, raises the possibility that the design, and perhaps even some of the stonework, was done with a more spacious bay at Worcester in mind. On his death in 1500 he was buried within his chapel.
Nicholas West had studied at Cambridge, Oxford and Bologna, had been a diplomat in the service of Henry VII and Henry VIII, and became Bishop of Ely in 1515. For the remaining 19 years of his life he &#x27;lived in greater splendour than any other prelate of his time, having more than a hundred servants.&#x27; He was able to build the magnificent Chantry chapel at the south-east corner of the presbytery, panelled with niches for statues (which were destroyed or disfigured just a few years later at the reformation), and with fan tracery forming the ceiling, and West&#x27;s tomb on the south side.

In 1771 the chapel was also used to house the bones of seven Saxon &#x27;benefactors of the church&#x27;. These had been translated from the old Saxon Abbey into the Norman building, and had been placed in a wall of the choir when it stood in the Octagon. When the choir stalls were moved, their enclosing wall was demolished, and the bones of Wulfstan (died 1023), Osmund of Sweden, Athelstan of Elmham, Ælfwine of Elmham, Ælfgar of Elmham, Eadnoth of Dorchester and Byrhtnoth, eorldorman of Essex, were found, and relocated into West&#x27;s chapel. Also sharing Nicholas West&#x27;s chapel, against the east wall, is the tomb memorial to the bishop Bowyer Sparke, who died in 1836.

===Dissolution and Reformation===

On 18 November 1539 the royal commissioners took possession of the monastery and all its possessions, and for nearly two years its future hung in the balance as Henry VIII and his advisers considered what role, if any, Cathedrals might play in the emerging Protestant church. On 10 September 1541 a new charter was granted to Ely, at which point Robert Steward, the last prior, was re-appointed as the first dean, who, with eight prebendaries formed the dean and chapter, the new governing body of the cathedral. Under Bishop Thomas Goodrich&#x27;s orders, first the shrines to the Anglo-Saxon saints were destroyed, and as iconoclasm increased, nearly all the stained glass and much of the sculpture in the cathedral was destroyed or defaced during the 1540s. In the Lady Chapel the free-standing statues were destroyed and all 147 carved figures in the frieze of St Mary were decapitated, as were the numerous sculptures on West&#x27;s chapel. The Cathedrals were eventually spared on the basis of three useful functions: propagation of true worship of God, educational activity, and care of the poor. To this end, vicars choral, lay clerks and boy choristers were all appointed (many having previously been members of the monastic community), to assist in worship. A grammar school with 24 scholars was established in the monastic buildings, and in the 1550s plate and vestments were sold to buy books and establish a library. The passageway running to the Lady Chapel was turned into an almshouse for six bedemen. The Lady Chapel itself was handed over to the town as Holy Trinity Parish Church in 1566, replacing a very unsatisfactory lean-to structure that stood against the north wall of the nave. Many of the monastic buildings became the houses of the new Cathedral hierarchy, although others were demolished. Much of the Cathedral itself had little purpose. The whole East end was used simply as a place for burials and memorials. The cathedral was damaged in the Dover Straits Earthquake of 6 April 1580, where stones fell from the vaulting.

Difficult as the sixteenth century had been for the cathedral, it was the period of the Commonwealth that came nearest to destroying both the institution and the buildings. Throughout the 1640s, with Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s army occupying the Isle of Ely, a puritanical regime of worship was imposed. Bishop Matthew Wren was arrested in 1642 and spent the next 18 years in the Tower of London. That no significant destruction of images occurred during the Civil War and the Commonwealth would appear to be because it had been done so thoroughly 100 years before. In 1648 parliament encouraged the demolition of the buildings, so that the materials could be sold to pay for &#x27;relief of sick and maimed soldiers, widows and children&#x27;. That this did not happen, and that the building suffered nothing worse than neglect, may have been due to protection by Oliver Cromwell, although the uncertainty of the times, and apathy rather than hostility to the building may have been as big a factor.

==Restoration==

When Charles II was invited to return to Britain, alongside the political restoration there began a process of re-establishing the Church of England. Matthew Wren, whose high church views had kept him in prison throughout the period of the Commonwealth, was able to appoint a new cathedral chapter. The dean, by contrast was appointed by the crown. The three big challenges for the new hierarchy were to begin repairs on the neglected buildings, to re-establish Cathedral services, and to recover its lands, rights and incomes. The search for lost deeds and records to establish their rights took over 20 years but most of the rights to the dispersed assets appear to have been regained.

In the 1690s a number of very fine baroque furnishings were introduced, notably a marble font (for many years kept in St Peter’s Church, Prickwillow,) and an organ case mounted on the Romanesque pulpitum (the stone screen dividing the nave from the liturgical choir) with trumpeting angels and other embellishments. In 1699 the north-west corner of the north transept collapsed and had to be rebuilt. The works included the insertion of a fine classical doorway in the north face. Christopher Wren has sometimes been associated with this feature, and he may have been consulted by Robert Grumbold, the mason in charge of the project. Grumbold had worked with Wren on Trinity College Library in Cambridge a few years earlier, and Wren would have been familiar with the Cathedral through his uncle Matthew Wren, bishop from 1638 to 1667. He was certainly among the people with whom the dean (John Lambe 1693–1708) discussed the proposed works during a visit to London. The damaged transept took from 1699 to 1702 to rebuild, and with the exception of the new doorway, the works faithfully re-instated the Romanesque walls, windows, and detailing. This was a landmark approach in the history of restoration.

===Bentham and Essex===
Two people stand out in Ely Cathedral&#x27;s eighteenth-century history, one a minor canon and the other an architectural contractor. James Bentham (1709–1794), building on the work of his father Samuel, studied the history of both the institution and architecture of the cathedral, culminating in 1771 with his publication of &quot;The History and Antiquities of the Conventual and Cathedral Church of Ely&quot;. He sought out original documents to provide definitive biographical lists of abbots, priors, deans and bishops, alongside a history of the abbey and cathedral, and was able to set out the architectural development of the building with detailed engravings and plans. These plans, elevations and sections had been surveyed by the architect James Essex (1722–1784), who by this means was able to both highlight the poor state of parts of the building, and understand its complex interdependencies.

The level of expertise that Bentham and Essex brought to the situation enabled a well-prioritised series of repairs and sensitive improvements to be proposed that occupied much of the later eighteenth century. Essex identified the decay of the octagon lantern as the starting point of a major series of repairs, and was appointed in 1757 to oversee the work. 400 years of weathering and decay may have removed many of the gothic features, and shortage of funds allied to a Georgian suspicion of ornament resulted in plain and pared down timber and leadwork on the lantern. He was then able to move on to re-roof the entire eastern arm and restore the eastern gable which had been pushed outwards some .

Bentham and Essex were both enthusiastic proponents of a longstanding plan to relocate the 14th-century choir stalls from under the octagon. With the octagon and east roof dealt with, the scheme was embarked on in 1769, with Bentham, still only a minor canon, appointed as clerk of works. By moving the choir stalls to the far east end of the cathedral, the octagon became a spacious public area for the first time, with vistas to east and west and views of the octagon vaulting. They also removed the Romanesque pulpitum and put in a new choir screen two bays east of the octagon, surmounted by the 1690s organ case. Despite their antiquarian interests, Bentham and Essex appear to have dismantled the choir stalls with alarming lack of care, and saw no problem in clearing away features at the east end, and removing the pulpitum and medieval walls surrounding the choir stalls. The north wall turned out to incorporate the bones of seven &#x27;Saxon worthies&#x27; which would have featured on the pilgrim route into the pre-Reformation cathedral. The bones were rehoused in Bishop West&#x27;s Chapel. The choir stalls, with their misericords were however retained, and the restoration as a whole was relatively sympathetic by the standards of the period.

===The Victorians===
The next major period of restoration began in the 1840s and much of the oversight was the responsibility of Dean George Peacock (1839–58). In conjunction with the Cambridge Professor Robert Willis, he undertook thorough investigations into the structure, archaeology and artistic elements of the building, and made a start on what became an extensive series of refurbishments by restoring the south-west transept. This had been used as a &#x27;workshop&#x27;, and by stripping out more recent material and restoring the Norman windows and arcading, they set a pattern that would be adopted in much of the Victorian period works. In 1845, by which time the cathedral had works underway in many areas, a visiting architect, George Basevi, who was inspecting the west tower, tripped, and fell 36 feet to his death. He was given a burial in the north choir aisle. Works at this time included cleaning back thick layers of limewash, polishing pillars of Purbeck marble, painting and gilding roof bosses and corbels in the choir, and a major opening up of the West tower. A plaster vault was removed that had been put in only 40 years before, and the clock and bells were moved higher. The addition of iron ties and supports allowed removal of vast amounts of infill that was supposed to strengthen the tower, but had simply added more weight and compounded the problems.

====George Gilbert Scott====
George Gilbert Scott was, by 1847, emerging as a successful architect and keen exponent of the Gothic Revival. He was brought in, as a professional architect to bolster the enthusiastic amateur partnership of Peacock and Willis, initially in the re-working of the fourteenth-century choir stalls. Having been at the East end for 80 years, Scott oversaw their move back towards the Octagon, but this time remaining within the eastern arm, keeping the open space of the Octagon clear. This was Scott&#x27;s first cathedral commission. He went on to work on a new carved wooden screen and brass gates, moved the high altar two bays westwards, and installed a lavishly carved and ornamented alabaster reredos carved by Rattee and Kett, a new font for the south-west transept, a new Organ case and later a new pulpit, replacing the neo-Norman pulpit designed by John Groves in 1803. In 1876 Scott&#x27;s designs for the octagon lantern parapet and pinnacles were implemented, returning it to a form which, to judge from pre-Essex depictions, seems to be genuinely close to the original. Various new furnishings replaced the baroque items installed in the 1690s.

====Stained glass====

In 1845 Edward Sparke, son of the bishop Bowyer Sparke, and himself a canon, spearheaded a major campaign to re-glaze the cathedral with coloured glass. At that time there was hardly any medieval glass (mostly a few survivals in the Lady Chapel) and not much of post-reformation date. An eighteenth-century attempt to get James Pearson to produce a scheme of painted glass had produced only one window and some smaller fragments. With the rediscovery of staining techniques, and the renewed enthusiasm for stained glass that swept the country as the nineteenth century progressed, almost all areas of the cathedral received new glazing. Under Sparke&#x27;s oversight, money was found from donors, groups, bequests, even gifts by the artists themselves, and by Edward Sparke himself. A wide variety of designers and manufacturers were deliberately used, to help find the right firm to fill the great lancets at the east end. In the event, it was William Wailes who undertook this in 1857, having already begun the four windows of the octagon, as well as contributions to the south west transept, south aisle and north transept. Other windows were by the Gérente brothers, William Warrington, Alexander Gibbs, Clayton and Bell, Ward and Nixon, Hardman &amp; Co., and numerous other individuals and firms from England and France.

A timber boarded ceiling was installed in the nave and painted with scenes from the Old and New Testaments, first by Henry Styleman Le Strange and then, after Le Strange&#x27;s death in 1862, completed by Thomas Gambier Parry, who also repainted the interior of the octagon.

A further major programme of structural restoration took place between 1986 and 2000 under Deans William Patterson (1984–90) and Michael Higgins (1991–2003), directed by successive Surveyors to the Fabric, initially Peter Miller and from 1994 Jane Kennedy. Much of this restoration work was carried out by Rattee and Kett. In 2000 a Processional Way was built, restoring the direct link between the north choir aisle and the Lady Chapel.

In 1972, the Stained Glass Museum was established to preserve windows from churches across the country that were being closed by redundancy. It opened to the public in 1979 in the north triforium of Ely Cathedral and following an appeal, an improved display space was created in the south triforium opening in 2000. Besides rescued pieces, the collection includes examples from Britain and abroad that have been donated or purchased through bequests, or are on loan from the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Royal Collection, and Friends of Friendless Churches.

==Religious community==
Ely has been an important centre of Christian worship since the seventh century AD. Most of what is known about its history before the Norman Conquest comes from Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; written early in the eighth century and from the &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot;, an anonymous chronicle written at Ely some time in the twelfth century, drawing on Bede for the very early years, and covering the history of the community until the twelfth century. According to these sources the first Christian community here was founded by Æthelthryth (romanised as &quot;Etheldreda&quot;), daughter of the Anglo-Saxon King Anna of East Anglia, who was born at Exning near Newmarket. She may have acquired land at Ely from her first husband Tondberht, described by Bede as a &quot;prince&quot; of the South Gyrwas. After the end of her second marriage to Ecgfrith, a prince of Northumbria, in 673 she set up and ruled as abbess a dual monastery at Ely for men and for women. When she died, a shrine was built there to her memory. This monastery is recorded as having been destroyed in about 870 in the course of Danish invasions. However, while the lay settlement of the time would have been a minor one, it is likely that a church survived there until its refoundation in the tenth century. The history of the religious community during that period is unclear, but accounts of the refoundation in the tenth century suggest that there had been an establishment of secular priests.

In the course of the revival of the English church under Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Aethelwold, Bishop of Winchester, Ely Abbey was reestablished in 970 as a community of Benedictine monks. This was one of a wave of monastic refoundations which locally included Peterborough and Ramsey (see English Benedictine Reform). Ely became one of the leading Benedictine houses in late Anglo-Saxon England. Following the Norman conquest of England in 1066 the abbey allied itself with the local resistance to Norman rule led by Hereward the Wake. The new regime having established control of the area, after the death of the abbot Thurstan, a Norman successor Theodwine was installed. In 1109 Ely attained cathedral status with the appointment of Hervey le Breton as bishop of the new diocese which was taken out of the very large diocese of Lincoln. This involved a division of the monastic property between the bishopric and the monastery, whose establishment was reduced from 70 to 40 monks, headed by a prior; the bishop being titular abbot. From 1216 the cathedral priory was part of the Canterbury Province of the English Benedictine Congregation, an umbrella chapter made up of the abbots and priors of the Benedictine houses of England, remaining so until the dissolution. 

In 1539, during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Ely Cathedral Priory surrendered to Henry VIII&#x27;s commissioners. The cathedral was refounded by royal charter in 1541 with the former prior Robert Steward as dean and the majority of the former monks as prebendaries and minor canons, supplemented by Matthew Parker, later Archbishop of Canterbury, and Richard Cox, later Bishop of Ely. With a brief interruption from 1649 to 1660 during the Commonwealth, when all cathedrals were abolished, this foundation has continued in its essentials to the twenty-first century, with a reduced number of residentiary canons now supplemented by a number of lay canons appointed under a Church Measure of 1999.

As with other cathedrals, Ely&#x27;s pattern of worship centres around the &quot;Opus Dei&quot;, the daily programme of services drawing significantly on the Benedictine tradition. It also serves as the mother church of the diocese and ministers to a substantial local congregation. At the Dissolution the veneration of St Etheldreda was suppressed, her shrine in the cathedral was destroyed, and the dedication of the cathedral to her and St Peter was replaced by the present dedication to the Holy and Undivided Trinity. Since 1873 the practice of honouring her memory has been revived, and annual festivals are celebrated, commemorating events in her life and the successive &quot;translations&quot; – removals of her remains to new shrines – which took place in subsequent centuries.

==Music==
The cathedral retains six professional adult lay clerks who sing in the Cathedral Choir along with boy and girl choristers aged 7 to 13 who receive choristerships funded by the cathedral to attend the King&#x27;s Ely school as day or boarding pupils. From 2021, boy and girl choristers sing an equal number of services, and receive an equal scholarship off of school fees at King’s Ely. The Director of Music leads the Boy choristers, and the Girl choristers are led by Sarah MacDonald. 

The Octagon Singers and Ely Imps are voluntary choirs of local adults and children respectively.

===Organ===
Details of the organ from the National Pipe Organ Register 
===Organists===
The following is a list of organists recorded since the cathedral was refounded in 1541 following the Second Act of Dissolution. Where not directly appointed as Organist, the position is inferred by virtue of their appointment as Master of the Choristers, or most recently as Director of Music.
==Stained Glass Museum==
The south triforium is home to the Stained Glass Museum, a collection of stained glass from the thirteenth century to the present that is of national importance and includes works from notable contemporary artists including Ervin Bossanyi.

<text>Badaling () is the site of the most visited section of the Great Wall of China, approximately northwest of Beijing&#x27;s city center, in Badaling Town, Yanqing District, Beijing municipality. The portion of the wall running through the site was built in 1504 during the Ming Dynasty, along with a military outpost reflecting the location&#x27;s strategic importance. The highest point of Badaling is Beibalou (北八樓), approximately above sea level.

Badaling Great Wall was built in the Ming Dynasty (1505) to occupy a commanding and strategic position for protecting the Juyongguan Pass (Juyongguan section of the Great Wall) to its south, further protecting the city of Beijing.

The portion of the wall at Badaling has undergone restoration, and in 1957, it was the first section of the wall to open to tourism. Now visited annually by millions, the immediate area has seen significant development, including hotels, restaurants, and a cable car.

==Transport==
===Expressway===
The Badaling Expressway connects Badaling with central Beijing.

===Railway===
Two China Railway lines serve Badaling:

*The Beijing-Zhangjiakou intercity railway has CRH high-speed trains running from Beijing North station, stopping at the underground Badaling Great Wall station.
*Line S2 of the Beijing Suburban Railway serves people who want to go to the at-grade Badaling station from Huangtudian station.

===Bus===
The 877 bus runs frequently between Deshengmen Bus Station (adjacent to the Jishuitan station on Line 2 and Line 19 of Beijing Subway) and Badaling Great Wall.

==Fame==
It was here that President Richard Nixon and his wife, accompanied by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, visited on February 24, 1972, during his historic journey to China. Many other world leaders have made a trip to the site including Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev.

Badaling and the expressway were the site of the finishing circuit of the Urban Road Cycling Course in the 2008 Summer Olympics. Laps of the circuit passed through gates in the wall.

==Internal traffic==
===Gondola Lift===
===Funicular===
Badaling Great Wall Funicular starts from the opposite of Zhan Tianyou Memorial Hall and goes to the fourth floor of the best viewing point of Badaling Great Wall-South.

<doc id="884386" wikidata="Q5452450" url="?curid=884386" title="First Baptist Church in America">
<text>The First Baptist Meetinghouse, also known as the First Baptist Church in America is the oldest Baptist church congregation in the United States. The Church was founded in 1638 by Roger Williams in Providence, Rhode Island. The present church building was erected between 1774 and 1775 and held its first meetings in May 1775. It is located at 75 North Main Street in Providence&#x27;s College Hill neighborhood. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. It is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA.

==History==

Roger Williams had been holding religious services in his home for nearly a year before he converted his congregation into a Baptist church in 1638. This followed his founding of Providence in 1636. For the next sixty years, the congregation met in congregants&#x27; homes, or outdoors in pleasant weather. Baptists in Rhode Island through most of the 17th century declined to erect meetinghouses because they felt such buildings reflected vanity. Eventually, however, they came to see the utility of some gathering place, and they erected severely plain-style meetinghouses like those of the Quakers.

Roger Williams was a Calvinist, but within a few years of its founding, the congregation became more Arminian, and was clearly a General Six-Principle Baptist church by 1652. It remained a General Baptist church until it migrated back to a variety of Calvinism under the leadership of James Manning in the 1770s. Following Williams as pastor of the church was Chad Brown, founder of the famous Brown family of Rhode Island. A number of the streets in Providence bear the names of pastors of First Baptist Church, including Williams, Brown, Gregory Dexter, Thomas Olney, William Wickenden, Manning, and Stephen Gano. In 1700, Pardon Tillinghast built the first church building, a structure, near the corner of Smith and North Main Streets. In 1711 he donated the building and land to the church in a deed describing the church as General Six-Principle Baptist in theology. In 1736 the congregation built its second meetinghouse on an adjoining lot at the corner of Smith and North Main Streets. This building was about 40 × 40 feet square (i.e.).

When it was built in 1774–75, the current meetinghouse represented a dramatic departure from the traditional Baptist meetinghouse style. It was the first Baptist meetinghouse to have a steeple and bell, making it more like Anglican and Congregational church buildings. The builders were part of a movement among Baptists in the urban centers of Boston, Newport, New York, and Philadelphia to bring respectability and recognition to Baptists.

===Association with Brown University===
Central to the movement for greater recognition and growth was the creation of an educated ministry and the founding of a college. The Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches sent Dr. James Manning to Rhode Island to found the college in the colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (later renamed Brown University) in 1764. Beginning in Warren, the college then relocated to Providence in 1770. The college president, Manning, was also called to be the pastor of the Providence church in 1771. During his ministry the present Meeting House was erected &quot;for the publick worship of Almighty God and also for holding commencement in.&quot; Subsequent Brown presidents Jonathan Maxcy and Francis Wayland also served as ministers at the church.

The Brown family that soon gave its name to the university were prominent members of the church, and descendants of its founders and those of the Rhode Island Colony (the second pastor of the congregation after Roger Williams was Chad Brown). Although the university is now secular, in honor of its history and tradition, the meetinghouse continues to be used, as it has been since 1776, as the site of Brown University&#x27;s undergraduate commencement.

=== Construction, alterations and designations ===
Construction of the church began in the summer of 1774; at the time, the project was the largest building project ever attempted in New England. Due to the closure of the Massachusetts ports by the British as punishment for the Boston Tea Party, out-of-work ship builders and carpenters came to Providence to work on the meetinghouse. The main portion of the meetinghouse was dedicated in mid-May 1775, and the steeple erected in three and a half days in the first week of June.

Notable additions to the meetinghouse have included a Waterford crystal chandelier given by Hope Brown Ives (1792), a large pipe organ given by her brother Nicholas Brown Jr., the younger (1834); the addition of rooms for Sunday school, a fellowship hall, and offices on the lower level (1819–59), and an addition to the east end of the meetinghouse to accommodate an indoor baptistery (1884). The 1884 addition included a large stained glass window that was soon deemed inappropriate and shuttered over.

In 1957, John D. Rockefeller Jr. funded a restoration effort that removed Victorian additions to the building, returning much of the church&#x27;s interior to its original appearance.

Notably absent from the interior is a gallery originally constructed on the church&#x27;s western side for use by slaves and free black residents of Providence.

The building was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1960, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.

== Architecture ==
The building was designed by astronomer and amateur architect Joseph Brown. Brown&#x27;s design borrowed significantly from the designs English architect James Gibbs published in his 1728 &quot;Book of Architecture&quot;. The church&#x27;s steeple, for example, is an exact execution of one of three unbuilt designs for the spire of St Martin-in-the-Fields.

==Today==
In addition to weekly worship services, the Meeting House hosts concerts, talks, and lectures by world-renowned artists, performers, academics, and elected officials. Brown University holds commencement services of its undergraduate college at the meetinghouse.

In 2001, history professor J. Stanley Lemons wrote a history of the church, entitled &quot;First: The History of the First Baptist Church in America&quot;

==Affiliations==
The First Baptist Church in America is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches of Rhode Island (ABCORI) and the American Baptist Churches USA (ABCUSA). The church actively supports the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches, the Baptist World Alliance, and the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. Many members have served in various denominational, academic, and divinity school positions, including the presidency of Brown University.

<text>Argenta (Argentano: ) is a town and &quot;county&quot; in the province of Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna. It is located about southeast of Ferrara, and midway between Ferrara and Ravenna.

==Geography==
Argenta is situated in a flat agricultural region near the Valli di Comacchio lagoon wetlands. Much of the latter is today a wildlife sanctuary and Argenta is home to the Marsh Museum which offers many facilities for ornithology.

==History==
The town was founded by the Romans. In 1295 it was the seat of a convention of the main Ghibelline leaders of Romagna to decide the course of the war against the Papal forces.

In 1923 a Fascist squad murdered a Catholic priest, don Giovanni Minzoni, an anti-fascist and the voice of the poor farmers in Romagna, as well as a friend of several socialist politicians like Natale Galba.

During World War II the area was part of the German Gothic Line. In April 1945, in the Allied advance of Operation Roast, it was the location of the Battle of the Argenta Gap.

<doc id="884388" wikidata="Q5450257" url="?curid=884388" title="Finger wave">
<text>A finger wave is a method of setting hair into waves (curls) that was popular in the 1920s and early 1930s and again in the late 1990s in North America and Europe. Silver screen actresses such as Josephine Baker and Esther Phillips are credited with the original popularity of finger waves. In their return in the 1990s, the style was popularized by pop stars like Madonna, and hip-hop stars of the time, such as Missy Elliott. The popularity of finger waves in the 1990s was aided by a movement toward shorter, more natural hair in the African-American community. This also was a common hairstyle worn by slaves back in 1802 through generations to 1889 and only began to take effect of popularity when Bette Davis danced on live television. 

The process involved pinching the hair between the fingers and combing the hair in alternating directions to make an &quot;S&quot; shape wave. A waving lotion was applied to the hair to help it retain its shape. The lotion was traditionally made using karaya gum, but more modern styles often use liquid styling gels or hairspray. Over the years, the use of clips (and later tape) also became popular to hold the heavy damp waves until the gel dried. According to &quot;Techniques of the 1920s and 1930s&quot;:

Finger waves were developed in the 1920s to add style to, and soften the hard appearance of, the bobbed hairstyles that became very popular during the flapper period

Many Hollywood movie stars wore the latest finger waves which contributed to the popularity and evolution of this style

Finger waving is the shaping or moulding of hair while wet into &quot;s&quot;-shaped curved undulations with the fingers and comb. These waves, when dried without being disturbed, will fall into deep waves. Finger waving differs from marcel waving in that there are no heated irons used on the hair. Not only naturally curly or permanently waved hair can be finger waved, but it is equally successful on straight hair.
Finger waves are similar to the marcel wave in appearance and are easily confused. Unlike finger waves, the marcel wave is made with a hot curling iron, and is more permanent than finger waves. Another hairstyle often confused with finger waves is the croquignole method of curling hair used to create a permanent wave. In this method the hair is curled using heated curlers and then shaped into the waves.

The popularity of the hairstyle led to the invention of an improved comb by Paul Compan for hairdressers to more efficiently create the waves.

When casually wearing finger waves, it is common to soften the style by brushing out the waves. For a more dramatic effect the waves are left in the original shape. Some examples of modern finger waves can be seen in the 2016 runway shows for Marc Jacobs, Prada, Jason Wu, Stella McCartney, and Salvatore Ferragamo.

<doc id="884390" wikidata="Q940658" url="?curid=884390" title="Earth 2 (TV series)">
<text>Earth 2 is an American science fiction television series that aired on NBC from November 6, 1994, to June 4, 1995. The show was canceled after one season of 21 episodes. It follows the journey and settlement of a small expeditionary group called the Eden Project, with the intent to journey to an Earth-like planet called G889 in an attempt to find a cure to an illness called &quot;the syndrome&quot;. The series was created by Billy Ray, Michael Duggan, Carol Flint, and Mark Levin, produced by Amblin Entertainment and Universal Television, and filmed primarily in northern New Mexico around the Santa Fe area. The series&#x27; music was composed by David Bergeaud, and the executive producers were Duggan, Levin, and Flint.

The show had a successful premiere, reaching eighth place for the week; however, ratings dropped off quickly as the Nielsen ratings share had dropped from 23% to 9%. During its run, it had been nominated for a Primetime Emmy, Saturn, and other awards. In 2005, the entire series was released on DVD in a four-disc set.

== Plot ==
In 2192, most of the human population has fled Earth to live on large orbiting space stations. Only a small number of humans remain on the Earth&#x27;s surface as the Earth has become mostly uninhabitable.

Billionaire Devon Adair&#x27;s eight-year-old son, Ulysses Adair, has contracted a rare, fatal disease called &quot;the syndrome&quot;, a condition whose existence is not acknowledged by the government and medical community. It is theorized that this disease, which affects only children, is somehow caused by the lack of an Earth-like environment. Most children who are born with the disease do not live past the age of nine.

Desperate to save her son, Devon puts together a group who will pioneer the effort to settle a planet 22 light-years away from Earth, on which other families with members thus afflicted can settle. The eventual colonization of the planet, however, is opposed by the government. Secret monitoring and agent infiltration threaten the creation of the colony of New Pacifica. Hours before Adair&#x27;s group intends to leave, a bomb is discovered, set to explode the hour the ship would leave. The Eden Project leaves immediately, jettisoning the bomb before detonation. In &quot;The Church of Morgan&quot;, it is revealed this bomb was planted by the Council to stop the ship from leaving.

Twenty-two years later, the ship arrives at G889, but it crash lands a great distance from the planned landing site. With her group scattered on the planet and supplies missing, Devon marshals what survivors she can find and begins heading west to the planned site of New Pacifica.

During their travels, Adair and her companions slowly learn to cope with life on the alien world, which at first seems superficially Earth-like but which is gradually revealed to have a very different ecology, including at least two different native sentient and humanoid species—a short and stout race at the level of development of hunter-gatherers, with a propensity towards kleptomania, known as &quot;Grendlers&quot; and the much taller and lankier &quot;Terrians&quot;, who are capable of telepathic communication, can tear rents and tunnels in the earth through a pseudo-psychic process and whose well-being is somehow linked to that of the planet. The survivors also learn that the Council—a government group that seems to wield most of the power on the space stations—wants to gain control of G889 for resettlement. Through their various experiments, they have learned that they cannot remove the Terrians without killing the planet. This complicates matters, because Devon&#x27;s son, who has been healed by the Terrians and begun to exhibit some of their unique characteristics, has become the key to the Council&#x27;s plan for the planet.

== Characters ==
The interactions among the original crew, the convicts, the government and the local aliens and their planet forms the basis of many of the story&#x27;s plot lines, as the colonists learn more about their new home while trying to avoid detection by the Council.
; Devon Adair: The leader of the expedition whose own son is afflicted with the Syndrome. As the leader, she attempts to balance directing the group as obstacles are encountered while confronting the possibility that her son may not survive his sickness.
; Ulysses Adair: Nicknamed &quot;Uly&quot;, he is the eight-year-old son of the expedition&#x27;s leader, Devon Adair. He was born with the Syndrome, an illness which convinced his mother that he could be cured if raised on a planet with access to fresh air, clean water and sunshine. His arrival on G889 and eventual connection to the Terrians is one of the keys to the colonization of the world and a recurring plot theme.
; John Danziger: Previously an indentured worker aboard the space station from which the group leaves. His daughter is most important to him, but he also assumes the role of protector of the group.
; True Danziger: The ten-year-old daughter of John Danziger, and also previously an indentured worker on the space station from which the expedition departed. She forms a bond with Uly, initially one of jealousy and dislike, but eventually a close friendship.
; Yale: A former convict and cyborg whose memory has been erased and behavior altered under a government program for the purpose of becoming a tutor for the children of wealthy families. He later recovers some of his memories and learns he did not commit a violent crime but instead defied the Council.
; Dr. Julia Heller: A genetically modified junior physician the colonists later learn is an agent for the Council.
; Morgan Martin: A government official supervising the Eden Project, husband to Bess Martin.
; Bess Martin: Wife of Morgan Martin, who grew up in the mines of Earth.
; Alonzo Solace: A cold sleep pilot far older than he looks, and eventually a love interest of Dr. Heller.
; Reilly: Julia Heller&#x27;s contact on the council, who eventually is revealed to be a computer program. In &quot;All About Eve&quot;, the creator of the EVE program reveals that Reilly is part of the same program.
; Zero: The crew&#x27;s bipedal worker droid capable of multiple tasks.
; Commander Broderick O’Neill: Second in command, he is stung by a Koba which puts him into a coma that the colonists mistake for death. He is found, but is suspicious of Gaal and begins hunting for clues to his history. He is murdered by Grendlers at the end of the second episode.

== Life on G889 ==
The landscape and climate of the new planet where the ship crashed seems very much like that of harsher climates on Earth, such as the southwestern United States. Water is scarce and scrub grows out of rock formations. In this area, three different species of life are discovered by Devon Adair and her group.
; : Soon after arrival the colonists come into contact with a semi-intelligent race of traders and scavengers named Grendlers. In &quot;A Memory Play&quot;, it is revealed that a grendler&#x27;s saliva is a cure for virtually any disease.
; : Exploring further, the group encounters an intelligent subterranean indigenous species named the Terrians, who seem to have a symbiotic relationship with the planet and can only communicate with the colonists through a dreamscape that few of them understand.
; Kobas: Small monkey-like creatures with a leather-like skin and large eyes. Kobas possess sharp claws, which they use like darts to incapacitate their intended food source. Once struck by a Koba-claw, a victim falls into a near-death coma for two to three days, but awakens with no permanent damage. Kobas have a great talent for mimicry. They are friendly toward those who are friendly to them, but are quick to defend themselves against possible predators.
; Humans: During the series the colonists learn they are not the only humans on the planet; it had previously been used as a penal colony so the government could learn more about how to colonize the planet.

== Production ==

=== Notable aspects of the series ===
&quot;Earth 2&quot; broke new ground by placing Devon Adair as one of the first female commanders in a science fiction television show, preceding the much better-known Captain Kathryn Janeway of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; by more than two months.

The overarching plot of the show and various individual elements helped explore the Gaia hypothesis, mainly through the Syndrome, its effects on many children, and the subsequent healing of the illness after the Eden Project arrives on G889.

During the show, various political and social themes were addressed as well. Throughout the series aspects of the relation of Terrians to the planet and to the colonists reflect the history of colonies with native populations and slavery. In &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, Julia is left behind by the group because of her treachery, addressing briefly what punishments are moral or even inhumane. Another aspect of this issue is addressed in &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth (Two)&quot;, when the group meets a man named Gaal who claims to be an astronaut but is revealed as a marooned criminal; when it is revealed that G889 had been used for many years as a penal colony, questions arise as to the motivations of the Council and their right to do so. In &quot;Redemption&quot;, the group encounters a genetically enhanced killer called Z.E.D., who was left on the planet to dispose of all the humans he finds, who at the time had been criminals.

=== Filming locations ===
Exterior shots filmed in New Mexico locations such as Kasha Katuwe Tent Rocks and Diablo Canyon, provided the setting for the series.

== Episodes ==
(Note: Due to presentation choices of the network, some episodes of this series were aired out of narrative sequence. The table below includes the episode numbering of most recent home media release of the series.)

== Broadcast ==
The series premiered on November 6, 1994, with a two-hour pilot episode (&quot;Earth 2: First Contact&quot;) that ran from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. EST (including advertisements—it was later split into two episodes for syndication). The following week it moved to a regular time slot. On April 23, 1995, two individual episodes were aired back-to-back from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. EST.

It was also aired in Austria, Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Spain and United Kingdom, later in 1995 Greece and Egypt in the fall of 1997, and in Turkey and Norway in 1998. In 2011 it aired on TV4 Science Fiction in Sweden.

== Other media ==
=== DVD release and online streaming ===
The complete series, comprising 21 episodes including the two-hour pilot, was released on DVD on July 19, 2005, in the United States in Region 1 format, on four dual-sided discs. The two parts of &quot;First Contact&quot; originally aired as the pilot in one feature-length 90-minute episode (95 minutes and 30 seconds on the Region 4 DVD).

The set includes all 21 episodes in order according to the air date—not the production order—resulting in two episodes (&quot;Natural Born Grendlers&quot; and &quot;Flower Child&quot;) being ordered after the final episode, &quot;All About Eve&quot;. These two were originally not aired until after the planned season finale had been aired and it was then known that the series had been cancelled; with the series not renewed the season finale became the series finale. In the order of production, and more importantly of the story line, the episode &quot;Natural Born Grendlers&quot; should have followed &quot;Life Lessons&quot;. (Clue: Alonzo has a cut on his forehead in &quot;Promises&quot; which he got in &quot;Natural Born Grendlers&quot;. However, most people place it after &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; because the three Gaal episodes were shown as a group.) The episode &quot;The Boy Who Would Be Terrian King&quot; (day 104 on the planet) takes place before &quot;After the Thaw&quot; (day 109 on the planet), and &quot;Flower Child&quot; should have followed &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;. In addition to the episodes, the set includes eight deleted and extended scenes, and out-takes.

Another DVD set titled &quot;Earth 2: The Complete Series&quot; was released on May 28, 2012, for Region 2. It corrected the above-mentioned episode order problem by placing them in narrative order, and included a card explaining that the trailers attached to the end of some episodes would not match the corrected play order.

Netflix in the United States streamed the episodes in production order.

=== Novels ===
Three &quot;Earth 2&quot; novels were published between December 1994 and May 1995. The first was a novelization of the two-part premiere. The remaining two were original stories.
* &quot;Earth 2: A Novel&quot; (Melissa Crandall, December 1994) 
* &quot;Puzzle&quot; (Sean Dalton, February 1995) 
* &quot;Leather Wings&quot; (John Vornholt, May 1995)

<text>Jan Jacobus Wouters (born 17 July 1960) is a Dutch professional football coach and former player. He played as a defensive midfielder and was Dutch Footballer of the Year in 1990.

==Career==
Wouters played for several clubs including PSV, Utrecht, Bayern Munich and Ajax. He was also a Netherlands international team member (70 caps, four goals) and was hugely influential in 1988 when the Netherlands won the European Football Championship.

He was a coach of Scottish Premier League club Rangers under Dick Advocaat and then Alex McLeish. He left Rangers at the end of the 2005–06 season, along with McLeish and Andy Watson.

Wouters is infamous to England supporters after elbowing Paul Gascoigne and fracturing his cheekbone during a World Cup qualifier in 1993 at Wembley Stadium. Gascoigne was forced to wear a Phantom of the Opera style facemask to protect his fractured cheekbone until his injury healed. The following day, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; labelled Wouters a &quot;Dutch thug&quot;. The match was drawn 2–2 and damaged England&#x27;s hopes of qualifying for the 1994 World Cup finals in the United States, despite England leading the match 2–0.

<doc id="884402" wikidata="Q838840" url="?curid=884402" title="Cacomistle">
<text>The cacomistle (; Bassariscus sumichrasti), also spelled cacomixtle, is a primarily nocturnal, arboreal, omnivorous member of the carnivoran family Procyonidae (coatis, kinkajous and raccoons). Depending on the location, its preferred habitats are humid and tropical evergreen jungle and montane cloud forests; seasonally, it may venture into drier, deciduous forests.

Although its total population is listed as being of &quot;least concern&quot; (i.e., stable), the cacomistle is still a highly cryptic, secretive animal, and generally an uncommon sight throughout much of its range (from southern México to western Panamá); this fact is especially true in Costa Rica, where it inhabits only a very small area. Additionally, the species is completely dependent on trees and dense vegetation for habitat, making it particularly susceptible to deforestation.

The name &quot;cacomistle&quot; comes from the Nahuatl language (&quot;tlahcomiztli&quot;) and means &quot;half-cat&quot; or &quot;half-puma&quot;; the same name is also given, by some, to the North American &quot;Bassariscus astutus&quot;, more commonly known as the ringtail (or, semi-inaccurately, ringtail &#x27;cat&#x27;). This &quot;sister species&quot; of the cacomistle inhabits a much more northerly and less tropical range, from arid Northern Mexico into the Southwestern United States.

==Taxonomy==
The cacomistle is one of two extant species in the genus &quot;Bassariscus&quot;, along with its close relative, the North American ringtail (&quot;Bassariscus astutus&quot;). Together, they form the Procyoninae, a subfamily of the greater Procyonidae of the Carnivora order, thus placing them with raccoons, coatis, olingos and kinkajous. 

Currently, six regional subspecies of &quot;Bassariscus sumichrasti&quot; are recognized:

* Campeche cacomistle (&quot;Bassariscus sumichrasti campechensis&quot;)

* Central American cacomistle (&quot;B. s. sumichrasti&quot;)

* Guerrero cacomistle (&quot;B. s. latrans&quot;)

* Northern Central American cacomistle (&quot;B. s. variabilis&quot;)

* Oaxaca cacomistle (&quot;B. s. oaxacensis&quot;)

* Panamá cacomistle (&quot;B. s. notinus&quot;)

==Description==

&quot;Bassariscus sumichrasti&quot; can grow to around 38–47 cm long, followed by a tail of roughly the same length or longer, adding an additional 39–53 cm to the entire animal&#x27;s body length. The male cacomistle is often slightly longer-bodied than the female; however, both males and females weigh about the same, usually between 1 and 1.5 kg. Their bodies are usually covered in grey or light brownish fur, in stark contrast to the black-and-white, striped tail. The tail markings are most defined near the animal&#x27;s posterior end, gradually fading to a solid black at the tip of the tail. 

To the untrained eye, &quot;Bassariscus sumichrasti&quot; may be visually confused with its close relative, &quot;Bassariscus astutus&quot;, the ringtail; however, in addition to a more northerly distribution, the ringtail, unlike the cacomistle, does not have retractable claws. The cacomistle can also be identified by its faded tail markings and ears that end in a distinct point.

==Distribution and habitat==
The cacomistle inhabits the tropical and subtropical forests of North America (Mexico) and south into Central America, ranging through Panama. These animals are quite solitary and thus spread themselves out, with each cacomistle having a home range of at least 20 hectares (an area equivalent to 20 sports fields) and are typically seen in the middle and upper levels of the canopy. Throughout their broad range this species is found to inhabit a wide variety of different forest ecosystems. In Mexico, the cacomistle tends to avoid oak forests, secondary forest, and overgrown pastures, but in Costa Rica, the cacomistle has been shown to favor those exact habitats.

==Diet==
The cacomistle is usually considered a generalist species, as it can survive on a wide variety of different foods. Their diet varies from season-to-season, consisting primarily of fruits, flowers, nectar, invertebrates and also some small vertebrates, such as lizards, frogs, toads, and rodents. The specificity of these food options depends on what is available in the particular habitat in which an individual dwells. The various genera of bromeliads (Bromeliaceae family) found throughout the cacomistle&#x27;s range are often an excellent source for food, especially in the southern end of the species&#x27; range, as these plants naturally collect rain water, which in turn brings insects and many small animals found high in the canopy; in addition, the bromeliad itself is often consumed by some omnivorous species.

==Reproduction==
Mating season is the only time cacomistles interact with each other, and it is only briefly as the female is only receptive to male approaches for one day. After mating, the female cacomistle undergoes a gestation period of approximately two months before giving birth to a single offspring. When the cub is three months old it is weaned, and then taught hunting and survival skills by its mother before going off to develop its own territory.

<text>Kearsney College is a private boarding, English medium high school for boys in Botha&#x27;s Hill, a small town between the provincial capital of Pietermaritzburg and Durban, in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.

== History ==

Kearsney College was founded by Sir Liege Hulett in 1921. Hulett founded what would become Tongaat Hulett Sugar. Sir Liege Hulett cherished the idea of establishing a boys&#x27; school for Methodist ministers and their sons and those of the families of the free churches. Kearsney took its name from Kearsney, Kent where Sir Liege Hulett had moved to where his father established St Martin&#x27;s Academy.

He considered Kearsney House, the house he originally built for his family to be ideally suited for this purpose. On 29 November 1920, a contract was signed with the Wesleyan Church for the use of Kearsney House as a school. This was the birth of Kearsney College and remains a living memorial to Sir Liege. The school opened with 11 boys. Kearsney College remained at the Kearsney Estate until June 1939 when it moved to its present site at Botha&#x27;s Hill between Pietermaritzburg and Durban. The decision to move the school was based on the reluctance of parents to send their sons to a school on the north coast that suffered many cases of malaria in the 1930s, although none were reported at Kearsney. On hearing of this, Clement Stott of Botha’s Hill donated of land. At the same time, J.J. Crookes offered to build a boarding house. The move was completed a month before the beginning of World War II. The new Kearsney College opened with 196 boys.

Kearsney&#x27;s badge was designed by the then-headmaster, R.H. Matterson, and the chaplain, the Rev. W.H. Irving, in about 1923. The greyhound is taken from the arms of the founder, Sir James Liege Hulett The scallop shells and the dividing chevron are from the arms of the founder of Methodism, John Wesley. The pheon, or arrowhead, is taken from the badge of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where Matterson studied. The motto &quot;Carpe Diem&quot;, traditionally at Kearsney translated &quot;Seize the Day,&quot; comes from the Roman poet Horace.

<text>Henri Louis Frédéric de Saussure (; ; 27 November 1829 – 20 February 1905) was a Swiss mineralogist, taxonomist and entomologist specialising in studies of hymenopteroid and orthopteroid insects.

==Education, career and family==
Saussure&#x27;s elementary education was at Alphonse Briquet&#x27;s then, as an adolescent, at the Hofwyl school run by Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg. At the University of Geneva he was taught by François Jules Pictet de la Rive, who introduced him to entomology. After several years of study in Paris he received the degree of licentiate of the Faculty of Paris and obtained the degree of Doctor from the University of Giessen.

He worked mainly on Hymenoptera and Orthoptera. His first paper, in 1852, was on solitary wasps.

In 1854 he traveled to the West Indies, then to Mexico and the United States of America. There he met Louis Agassiz.

He returned to Switzerland in 1856 with collections of American insects, myriapods, crustaceans, birds and mammals. Also interested in geography, geology and ethnology, he co-founded the Geographical Society of Geneva in 1858.

He was also a member of the managing committee of the Natural History Museum of Geneva, ensuring that its collections of Hymenoptera and Orthoptera became one of the best in the world. In 1872 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Entomological Society of London. In 1873, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

He had nine children including the famous linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857), who was his eldest son; Horace (c 1859); Albertine Adèle (1861), named for Henri&#x27;s aunt and sister-in-law; Elisabeth &quot;Dora&quot; Théodora (1863); Léopold (1866); René de Saussure (1868); Jeanne (c 1869); Louis Octave (1871); and Maximilien (1873).

<doc id="884416" wikidata="Q449583" url="?curid=884416" title="Alvord Desert">
<text>The Alvord Desert is a desert located in Harney County, in southeastern Oregon in the Western United States. It is roughly southeast of Steens Mountain. The Alvord Desert is a dry lake bed and averages of rain a year. Two mountain ranges separate it from the Pacific Ocean—the Coast Range, and the Cascade Mountains. Along with Steens Mountain, these topographical features create a rain shadow. The Alvord Desert lies at an elevation of approximately .

During the dry season the surface is sufficiently flat for driving or landing small aircraft. Vehicle driving attempts to score land speed records are performed on the dry lake bed. The women&#x27;s world land speed record was set in 1976 by Kitty O&#x27;Neil at , later surpassed in 2019 by Jessi Combs at , although the latter died in the process because of a crash.

The nearest community is Fields, Oregon.

==Name==
The desert is named after General Benjamin Alvord, who served as commander of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Department of Oregon during the American Civil War.

==Climate==

The Alvord Desert experiences a cold desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;). The area receives very little rainfall throughout the year due to the rain shadow created by the Coast and Cascade mountain ranges as well the adjacent Steens Mountain. Some eastern areas of the desert may receive as little as of rain annually.

===Winter===
Winter temperatures in the Alvord Basin are moderated through airflow from the south that stops the temperature from dropping too heavily. While many areas in the Oregon High Desert frequently dip below through the winter months, the Alvord Desert rarely sees these frigid temperatures. On average, highs will commonly reach between , with a few rare instances where the temperature fails to break . At night, the temperature falls to between , but will not normally fall much further unless Arctic air masses arrive. The basin sees a moderate amount of its rainfall in the winter months from storms coming off the Pacific Ocean while the strong winter jet stream is aimed at the Pacific Northwest. Storms that are strong enough to bring moisture to the Southeastern area of Oregon are usually related to tropical storms feeding from the Hawaiian Islands. Snow does sometimes occur in the rare instances when cold air from the Arctic to the north meets a strong flow of moisture from the Pacific to the West.

===Spring===
Spring is when the bulk of precipitation falls from thunderstorms. These storms are attributed to the rainfall in April, May, and June that form in the south and move their way north across the desert and surrounding sagebrush plains. Clear nights continue to bring cold overnight temperatures which commonly drop to between , but afternoon warming raises temperatures to between in early spring and in late spring. This warming can help trigger thunderstorms in combination with the unstable spring atmosphere. Extremes in temperature can still be seen at this time of year where temperatures have fallen to in March, and climbed to over in early June. Rainfall turns the playa into a small lake, and for a short time, makes travel across it difficult.

===Summer===
Summer in the Alvord Desert has some of the hottest temperatures in the state of Oregon. High pressure sets in over the Pacific Northwest and the jet stream pushes north into Canada. This high pressure means very little precipitation, averaging less than throughout the summer months. Late day heat begins to set in by late June where highs reach between . In July the temperature commonly climbs to between . Night-time lows vary, with overnight temperatures dropping down between throughout much of the basin. In some locations temperatures will only drop to between . August remains hot with highs ranging between and lows between , though dropping towards the end of the month.

===Fall===
Fall is moderate with high temperatures ranging between and lows between . Fall is also one of the driest times of the year.

==Geology==
Three primary geothermal areas are along the western edge as well as cold springs following NE to SW trending normal faults. On the western edge of the desert is Alvord Hot Springs (). At the north is Mickey Hot Springs (): an assortment of bubbling mud, pools and, the occasional geyser. At the south is Borax Lake () which is a thermal spring complex. To the east is an unnamed natural hot spring, one of 40 or more along of the Alvord fault. To the southwest is seasonal alkali Alvord Lake which once extended north and south—covering the desert. Several of the geothermal features in Alvord Desert Basin have been examined by a team of scientists and geologists from the University of Idaho, Boise State University, and Idaho State University.

==Fauna==
Despite the barren nature of the playa, some opportunities for wildlife observation exist. Wild horses sometimes drink from the springs on the eastern edge of the desert. In areas where natural hot springs flow into the playa, especially around the Alvord Hot Springs, one can usually find nesting long-billed curlew. Further out into the playa proper are numerous killdeer and snowy plover, along with the occasional American avocet. The outlet waters from the springs typically flow roughly one mile into the desert, and their reach roughly delineates the bird habitat. The nearby Steens Mountain Wilderness contains populations of bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, and pronghorn. Further west is the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, which is popular for birding.

==Land speed record==
The previous women&#x27;s Land Speed Record was set at Alvord Desert by Kitty O&#x27;Neil, in the jet-powered &quot;SMI Motivator&quot;, in 1976. O&#x27;Neil reached .

On August 27, 2019, Jessi Combs died while making back and forth runs at Alvord Desert in an attempt to break O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s record, and in June 2020, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; recognized Combs&#x27; runs on that date as the official new world record of .

<text>The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam is a compilation of lectures delivered by Muhammad Iqbal on Islamic philosophy which got published in 1930. These lectures were delivered by Iqbal in Madras, Hyderabad, and Aligarh. The last chapter, &quot;Is Religion Possible&quot;, was added to the book from the 1934 Oxford Edition onwards.

In &quot;Reconstruction&quot;, Iqbal called for a re-examination of the intellectual foundations of Islamic philosophy. The book is a major work of modern Islamic thought. It was a major influence on Iranian sociologist Ali Shariati and other contemporary Muslim reformers, including Tariq Ramadan.

==Reviews==
D.S. Margoliouth, an orientalist and a professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford, wrote &quot;From the Qur&#x27;anic law of inheritance which makes the share of the male equal to that of two females the superiority of the male over the female has been inferred; such an assumption would, Sir M.Iqbal observes, be controversial to the spirit of Islam.&quot;The Qur&#x27;an says: &quot;And for women are rights over men similar to those for men over women&quot;.&quot; William Owen Carver (1898–1943) observed &quot;His [Iqbal&#x27;s] aim was &quot;to reconstruct Muslim religious philosophy with due regard to the philosophical traditions of Islam and the more recent developments of human knowledge.&quot; Edward Hulmes noted &quot;One of the author’s [Iqbal&#x27;s] motives was to encourage his fellow countrymen to explore their own cultural roots after years of British colonial rule. But his aim was also to transcend the limited boundaries of national identity in order to &#x27;build bridges&#x27; between peoples of different cultures and religious traditions.&quot;

<text>Bassariscus is a genus in the family Procyonidae. There are two extant species in the genus: the ringtail or ring-tailed cat (&quot;B. astutus&quot;) and the cacomistle (&quot;B. sumichrasti&quot;). Genetic studies have indicated that the closest relatives of &quot;Bassariscus&quot; are raccoons, from which they diverged about 10 million years ago in the Tortonian Age of the Miocene. The two lineages of &quot;Bassariscus&quot; are thought to have separated after only another two million years, making it the extant procyonid genus with the earliest diversification. Later diversification in the genus in the Pliocene and Pleistocene saw the emergence of two extinct species, &quot;Bassariscus casei&quot; and &quot;Bassariscus sonoitensis&quot;, respectively. Due to the more digitigrade stance of their legs compared to the plantigrade stance of other members of Procyonidae, some taxonomies place the genus as a separate family, &quot;Bassaricidae.&quot;. The name is a Greek word for fox (&quot;bassaris&quot;) with a Latinized diminutive ending (&quot;-iscus&quot;). The genus was named by Elliott Coues in 1887, having previously been described by Lichtenstein in 1830 under the name &quot;Bassaris&quot;. Coues proposed the word &quot;bassarisk&quot; as the English term for animals in this genus. Its habitat includes semi-arid areas in the southwestern United States, the whole of Mexico, as well as moist tropical forests in Central America.

<doc id="884421" wikidata="Q1036653" url="?curid=884421" title="Sensory processing sensitivity">
<text>Sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) is a temperamental or personality trait involving &quot;an increased sensitivity of the central nervous system and a deeper cognitive processing of physical, social, and emotional stimuli&quot;. The trait is characterized by &quot;a tendency to &#x27;pause to check&#x27; in novel situations, greater sensitivity to subtle stimuli, and the engagement of deeper cognitive processing strategies for employing coping actions, all of which is driven by heightened emotional reactivity, both positive and negative&quot;.

A human with a particularly high measure of SPS is considered to have &quot;hypersensitivity&quot;, or be a highly sensitive person (HSP). The terms &quot;SPS&quot; and &quot;HSP&quot; were coined in the mid-1990s by psychologists Elaine Aron and her husband Arthur Aron, who developed the Highly Sensitive Person Scale (HSPS) questionnaire by which SPS is measured. Other researchers have applied various other terms to denote this responsiveness to stimuli that is seen in humans and other species.

According to the Arons and colleagues, people with high SPS make up about 15–20% of the population. Although some researchers consistently related high SPS to negative outcomes, other researchers have associated it with increased responsiveness to both positive and negative influences. Aron and colleagues state that the high-SPS personality trait is not a disorder.

==Origin and development of the terms==
Elaine Aron&#x27;s book &quot;The Highly Sensitive Person&quot; was published in 1996. In 1997 Elaine and Arthur Aron formally identified &quot;sensory processing sensitivity&quot; (SPS) as the defining trait of highly sensitive persons (HSPs). The popular terms &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; (not to be confused with the medical term hypersensitivity) or &quot;highly sensitive&quot; are popular synonyms for the scientific concept of SPS. By way of definition, Aron and Aron (1997) wrote that &quot;sensory processing&quot; here refers not to the sense organs themselves, but to what occurs as sensory information is transmitted to or processed in the brain. They assert that the trait is not a disorder but an innate survival strategy that has both advantages and disadvantages.

Elaine Aron&#x27;s academic journal articles as well as self-help publications for the lay reader have focused on distinguishing high SPS from socially behavior and disorders with which high SPS can be confused; overcoming the social unacceptability that can cause low self-esteem; and emphasizing the advantages of high SPS to balance the disadvantages emphasized by others.

In 2015, journalist Elizabeth Bernstein wrote in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that HSPs were &quot;having a moment,&quot; noting that several hundred research studies had been conducted on topics related to HSPs&#x27; high sensitivity. The First International Scientific Conference on High Sensitivity or Sensory Processing Sensitivity was held at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. By 2015, more than a million copies of &quot;The Highly Sensitive Person&quot; had been sold.

=== Earlier research ===
Research pre-dating the Arons&#x27; coining of the term &quot;high sensitivity&quot; includes that of German medicine professor Wolfgang Klages, who argued in the 1970s that the phenomenon of sensitive and highly sensitive humans is &quot;biologically anchored&quot; and that the &quot;stimulus threshold of the thalamus&quot; is much lower in these persons. As a result, said Klages, there is a higher permeability for incoming signals from afferent nerve fibers so that they pass &quot;unfiltered&quot; to the cerebral cortex.

The Arons (1997) recognized psychologist Albert Mehrabian&#x27;s (1976, 1980, 1991) concept of filtering the &quot;irrelevant&quot;, but wrote that the concept implied that the inability of HSPs&#x27; (Mehrabian&#x27;s &quot;low screeners&quot;) to filter out what is irrelevant would imply that what is relevant is determined from the perspective of non-HSPs (&quot;high screeners&quot;).

==Attributes, characteristics and prevalence==
Boterberg &quot;et al.&quot; (2016) describe high SPS as a &quot;temperamental or personality trait which is present in some individuals and reflects an increased sensitivity of the central nervous system and a deeper cognitive processing of physical, social and emotional stimuli.&quot;

People with high SPS report having a heightened response to stimuli such as pain, caffeine, hunger, and loud noises. According to Boterberg &quot;et al.&quot;, these individuals are &quot;believed to be easily overstimulated by external stimuli because they have a lower perceptual threshold and process stimuli cognitively deeper than most other people.&quot; This deeper processing may result in increased reaction time as more time is spent responding to cues in the environment, and might also contribute to cautious behavior and low risk-taking.
The HSP Scale, initially (1997) a questionnaire designed to measure SPS on a unidimensional scale, was subsequently decomposed into two, three, or four factors or sub-scales. Most components have been associated with traditionally accepted negative psychological outcomes including high stress levels, being easily overwhelmed, increased rates of depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, as well as autistic traits; the diathesis–stress model focused on increased vulnerability to negative influences. However, the differential susceptibility theory (DST) and biological sensitivity to context theory (BSCT) and sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) suggest increased plasticity in terms of responsiveness to both positive and negative influences; and the vantage sensitivity (VS) concept emphasizes increased responsiveness to positive experiences. Researchers such as Smolewska &quot;et al.&quot; (2006) said positive outcomes were more common in individuals with high aesthetic sensitivity, who tend to experience heightened positive emotions in response to rewarding stimuli and more likely to score high on &quot;openness&quot; on the Big Five factors model.

Research in evolutionary biology provides evidence that the trait of SPS can be observed, under various terms, in over 100 nonhuman species, Aron writing that the SPS trait is meant to encompass what personality psychologists have described under various other names. Conversely, Aron has distinguished SPS from what she considers it is not, explicitly distinguishing high SPS from possibly similar-appearing traits or disorders (such as shyness, sensation-seeking, sensory processing disorder, and autism), and further, that SPS may be a basic variable that may underlie multiple other trait differences (such as introversion versus extraversion). Contrary to common misconception, according to Aron HSPs include both introverts and extroverts, and may be simultaneously high-sensation seeking and cautious.

In humans and other species, responsive and unresponsive individuals coexist and consistently display different levels of responsiveness to environmental stimuli, the different levels of responsiveness having corresponding evolutionary costs and benefits. This observation parallels Aron&#x27;s assertion that high SPS is not a disorder, but rather a personality trait with attendant advantages and disadvantages. Accordingly, Aron cautions medical professionals against prescribing psychoactive medications to &quot;cure&quot; the trait, which may or may not coexist with an actual disorder.

By 2015 the trait had been documented at various levels of study, including temperament and behavior psychology, brain function and neuronal sensitization, and genetics. For example, genetic studies provide evidence that higher levels of SPS are linked to the serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR short/short genotype, polymorphisms in dopamine neurotransmitter genes, and the ADRA2b norepinephrine-related gene variant.

A 2015 longitudinal study based on army medical records of Swedish men showed a correlation between low resting heart rate and violence and criminality, with the authors theorising that lower sensitivity to stimulation resulted in increased likelihood of risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviour – effectively a low sensitivity counterpart to SPS.

HSP Scale score patterns in adults were thought to be distributed as a categorical variable with a break point between 10% and 35%, with Aron choosing a cut-off of the highest-scoring 20% of individuals to define the HSP category. A 2019 review article stated that findings suggest people fall into three sensitivity groups along a normal distribution sensitivity continuum.

<text>Bradley D. Blum (born 1953) is the Co-Owner of FoodFirst Global Restaurants. He was the Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO of FoodFirst Global Restaurants, Inc., upon the establishment of the company in May 2018. Previously he was the CEO of Burger King from December 2002 to July 2, 2004. He joined the company from Darden Restaurants where he had headed the Olive Garden unit, but left after only 18 months citing strategic differences with Burger King&#x27;s board. Blum&#x27;s successor, Greg Brenneman, was appointed on August 1, 2004. Blum was the CEO of Romano&#x27;s Macaroni Grill from December 2008 to July 2010. In 2013 Blum co-founded Five to Seven, a restaurant investment firm that focused on “Good Food for the Planet” based on several central tenets.

==Education==
Blum graduated from Denison University with a BA in Economics and Urban Studies. He continued his formal education by earning an MBA in marketing and finance from Northwestern&#x27;s J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management.

==Career==

===General Mills===

After college, Blum worked with General Mills as a marketing executive. He worked at General Mills on both a national and international level. 

Blum helped to lead a start-up company called &quot;Cereal Partners Worldwide&quot; (CPW) in Switzerland; they had partnered up with Nestlé for an equal interest in the company, 50/50. Cereal Partners Worldwide is a large international company with an annual turnover of about two billion US dollars. Blum is credited with putting the first female athlete on a Wheaties box (Mary Lou Retton), and with putting the first African American athlete on a Wheaties box (Walter Payton). Blum also invented a new cereal for General Mills: Cinnamon Toast Crunch, the company&#x27;s most profitable brands

===Olive Garden===

Starting in 1994, Blum left General Mills and joined Olive Garden as its executive vice president of marketing. He was later promoted to president. For the next eight years he oversaw Olive Garden&#x27;s growth. Under Blum&#x27;s leadership as the chief executive, Olive Garden achieved 57 consecutive quarters of same-restaurant sales increases, with continually increasing profits. The company&#x27;s restaurant branch average increased by 67 percent during Blum&#x27;s time there. In 2000, he won the MUFSO (Multi-Unit Foodservice Operators) Operator of the Year, a very high honor within the restaurant industry. In early 2002, he left Olive Garden.

===Darden Restaurants===

In March 2002, Blum moved further up the ladder to become Vice Chairman of Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden restaurant chain. Because of his leadership, Olive Garden became Darden&#x27;s most successful and recognizable company. Blum oversaw Olive Garden and Smokey Bones (considered one of Darden&#x27;s most promising new restaurant companies). Darden was, and is, considered the largest casual dining restaurant company in the world, and Blum oversaw quality assurance, purchasing, and distribution for all the brand-name restaurants that Darden owned. Purchasing included the very fickle and mercurial business of global fish and seafood supply for Red Lobster. Blum also evaluated up and coming restaurants for newly prospective acquisitions.

===Burger King===

Blum was named the CEO of Burger King in late 2002, having been hired to turn the declining company around. He was hired after Diageo sold Burger King Corporation to the private equity group of Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs. During his tenure at Burger King, Blum oversaw the company&#x27;s improvement in its financial performance. In his first year, profits doubled and positive growth was trending; the average restaurant sales increased from a loss of 7% to a growth of 4%. This proved advantageous when the company initiated an IPO in 2006.

===Romano&#x27;s Macaroni Grill===

In late 2008, Romano&#x27;s Macaroni Grill was suffering declines in sales, profits, and market share of the casual dining industry, and hired Blum as its CEO. He oversaw a turnaround in the same-restaurant sales from an annual loss of 11% to a 3% profit. Macaroni Grill&#x27;s change in fortunes was partially based on a complete revamp the chain&#x27;s menu, reorienting its cooking style on a more Mediterranean method of preparing and cooking food. In the first fifteen months, the changes to the menu not only improved the quality of the chain&#x27;s products but also lowered its production costs. The caloric content of the products was reduced by 49% from the previous menu, along with a 59% reduction in fat and a 46% reduction in sodium. Blum&#x27;s name for the change was called &quot;Quality up, Costs down.&quot; As a result of these menu improvements, customer satisfaction rate for the chain grew. In May 2010, &quot;Nation&#x27;s Restaurant News&quot; named Blum the Menu Master&#x27;s Innovator of the Year in the restaurant industry for his accomplishments at Macaroni Grill.

===Five to Seven===
In 2013 Blum co-launched the investment vehicle Five to Seven with John Vincent. The goal of his work here was to invest in restaurants the would fall under the category of &quot;Good Food for the Planet&quot;. Blum has stated that the central tenets of this are that the food is &quot;exceptionally good tasting; remarkably good for you; a good everyday value; and good for the environment – plus you should feel good after eating it.&quot; Winter Park Magazine wrote of this work that, &quot;Blum is a visionary whose business accomplishments have made him a legendary figure in the food industry. Now, he’s tackling a worsening national problem — the obesity and diabetes epidemics, caused in large part by the food we eat — using insider knowledge and the same passion that he brought to bear as a CEO in the business world.&quot;

===FoodFirst Global Restaurants===
Blum and Brazilian-based investment firm GP Investments, Ltd. formed FoodFirst Global Restaurants, Inc. and acquired its first brands, Brio Tuscan Grille™ (Brio) and Bravo Cucina Italiana™ (Bravo) on May 24, 2018. In early 2020, Blum resigned as Chairman and CEO but remains a Co-Owner of the company.

== Personal life ==
Blum&#x27;s hometown is Cincinnati, Ohio. His hobby is auto racing.

<doc id="884434" wikidata="Q726096" url="?curid=884434" title="Alfonso Ferrabosco the elder">
<text>Alfonso Ferrabosco (baptized 18 January 154312 August 1588) was an Italian composer. While mostly famous as the solitary Italian madrigalist working in England, and the one mainly responsible for the growth of the madrigal there, he also composed much sacred music. He also may have been a spy for Elizabeth I while he was in Italy.

His father, Domenico Ferrabosco, and son, Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger were also composers.

==Life and career==
He was the eldest son of Domenico Ferrabosco, and a member of an aristocratic Bolognese family which had many musicians among its members. Alfonso was born in Bologna. Little is known about his early life, but he is known to have spent part of it in Rome and part in Lorraine in the service of Charles of Guise. In 1562, probably with his uncle, he came to England for the first time, where he found employment with Elizabeth I. Throughout his life he made periodic trips to Italy, not without controversy, for evidently neither the Pope nor the Inquisition fully approved of his spending time in England, which was in the late 16th century actively at war with Roman Catholic countries. While in England, he lost his Italian inheritance, and while away in Italy he was charged with certain crimes in England (including robbing and killing another foreigner). While he was successful in clearing his name, he left England in 1578 and never returned; he died in Bologna.

Many have said that he was a secret service agent for Elizabeth, working during a time when such intelligence was desperately needed; however, little more than circumstantial evidence has ever been produced on this allegation. He was certainly unusually well-paid for a musician at the court of Elizabeth. Attempts by Elizabeth to get him to return to England after 1580 were fruitless.

==Music==
Ferrabosco brought the madrigal to England. While he did not start the madrigal craze there—that really began in 1588 with the publication of Nicholas Yonge&#x27;s &quot;Musica Transalpina&quot;, the popularity of which was such that the madrigal instantly became the most prevalent type of composition in England—he did plant the seeds for this development. Ferrabosco&#x27;s style may have been tame and conservative by the standards of a Marenzio or a Luzzaschi, but it was harmonious with English taste. Most of his madrigals were for five or six voices, were light in style, and largely ignored the progressive developments in Italy such as expressive chromaticism and word-painting. Technically they were skillful, and this is the quality that impressed the English commentators the most: &quot;deep skill&quot; was the phrase Thomas Morley used to describe his work when he published several of his compositions in a collection of 1598, ten years after his death. Robert Dow also included two of his works in his manuscript, now known as the Dow Partbooks.

In addition to the madrigals, Ferrabosco wrote sacred music, including motets, lamentations, and several anthems, all in &quot;a cappella&quot; vocal style. He also wrote instrumental music: fantasias, pavans, galliards, &quot;In Nomines,&quot; and &quot;passamezzos,&quot; for a variety of instrumental combinations including lute and viols.

<text>The Cure for Insomnia is a 1987 experimental film directed by John Henry Timmis IV, which was, according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, the longest running film. At 5,220 minutes long (87 hours, or 3 days and 15 hours) in length, the film has no plot, instead consisting of artist L. D. Groban reading his 4,080-page poem &quot;A Cure for Insomnia&quot; over the course of three and a half days, spliced with occasional clips from heavy metal and pornographic videos.

It was first played in its entirety at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, (Illinois), from January 31 to February 3, 1987, in one continuous showing. It has not been released on DVD or other home video formats and all known copies are considered to be lost.

<doc id="884437" wikidata="Q177734" url="?curid=884437" title="Artesian well">
<text>An artesian well is a well that brings groundwater to the surface without pumping because it is under pressure within a body of rock or sediment known as an aquifer. When trapped water in an aquifer is surrounded by layers of impermeable rock or clay, which apply positive pressure to the water, it is known as an artesian aquifer. If a well were to be sunk into an artesian aquifer, water in the well-pipe would rise to a height corresponding to the point where hydrostatic equilibrium is reached.

A well drilled into such an aquifer is called an &quot;artesian well&quot;. If water reaches the ground surface under the natural pressure of the aquifer, the well is termed a &quot;flowing artesian well&quot;.

Fossil water aquifers can also be artesian if they are under sufficient pressure from the surrounding rocks, similar to how many newly tapped oil wells are pressurized.

Not all aquifers are artesian (i.e., water table aquifers occur where the groundwater level at the top of the aquifer is at equilibrium with atmospheric pressure). Aquifers recharge when the water table at its recharge zone is at a higher elevation than the head of the well.

== History ==
The first mechanically accurate explanation for artesian wells was given by Al-Biruni. Artesian wells were named after Artois in France, where many artesian wells were drilled by Carthusian monks from 1126.

<text>David Southall is a retired British paediatrician who specialised in international maternal and child hospital healthcare and in child protection. He worked in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1993-1995, for which he received an OBE in 1999. In 1995 he set up the charity Maternal and Childhealth Advocacy International (MCAI), of which he remains a trustee as of 2023. His child protection work and research into Munchausen syndrome by proxy attracted controversy and led to conflict with the General Medical Council. 

==Early career==
Prior to becoming a paediatrician, Southall spent four years in general adult medicine, one year in obstetrics and two years as a general practitioner.

==International humanitarian work==
In 1993, during the Bosnian War, Southall was invited by the Overseas Development Administration of the British Government (now DFID) to visit Sarajevo to identify and evacuate children in need of urgent medical treatment which could not be provided locally because of armed conflict.
After this mission he was asked by UNICEF to become a consultant and lead a programme from 1993-1995 to help children in Mostar and in camps for internally displaced families in other areas of Bosnia. Prompted by his experiences in Bosnia of what he described as &quot;trauma inflicted on children and their families, not only by warring factions, but also by the indolence of the international community&quot;, Southall established Child Advocacy International (CAI) on his return to the UK, to advocate for international child health issues. Since 2009, and in order to reflect the close involvement of CAI with the emergency care of pregnant women and adolescent girls, the charity was re-named Maternal and Childhealth Advocacy International (MCAI).

Some of the main advocacy undertaken involved campaigns against the arms trade, healthcare in refugee camps and the development of the Maternal and Child Friendly Healthcare Initiatives (see below). One particular success with advocacy involved the New Jalozai Afghan refugee camp where the Pakistan Government were encouraged by CAI to move the 70,000 refugees living in appalling circumstances into a more suitable camp. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) wrote a letter to Southall thanking CAI for this achievement.

From 1999 to 2004 Southall was Chairman of a working party developing the Child Friendly Healthcare Initiative (CFHI). In addition to CAI, UNICEF UK, The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the Royal College of Nursing were parties to this work.

Since 2002, and following on to CAI&#x27;s work in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and in collaboration with a British Medical Education charity a program called “Strengthening Emergency Healthcare” involving Emergency Maternal, Neonatal and Child Healthcare (EMNCH) was established. The program was originally started in the Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan and has subsequently been developed in Pakistan with assistance from the local offices of the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF. In 2006, it was successfully introduced into The Gambia following a recommendation from WHO Geneva. In November 2012 a similar programme was started in Liberia with financial support from THET and UKAID.

Additional programs of CAI and subsequently of MCAI involved apprenticeship based training in hospital care of pregnant women, newborn infants and children in Kosovo, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Uganda, The Gambia and Liberia. 

==Respiratory research and child protection work==
Between 1979 and 1983 a large prospective investigation funded by the British Heart Foundation and the Medical Research Council was led by Southall into the potential role of short episodes of absent breathing and heart rate and rhythm disorders in newborn infants. The study showed no evidence that these episodes in infants were related to subsequent SIDS leading to a major reversal of the role of apnoea monitors in SIDS prevention.

For his research work into SIDS, Southall was given The Mary Gray and William W Cobey Award from the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Institute in 1994, University of Maryland and in January 1995 the Annenberg Center Apnea of Infancy Award.

In 1993, Southall reported in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; a study investigating the performance of invasive procedures in the intensive care of infants and children. This study revealed inadequate pain control and sedation for a high proportion of painful procedures and led to a national review of this problem. As a consequence he was appointed chair of a working party of the British Paediatric Association to develop guidelines on the management of pain control in children in hospital in the UK.

Between 1986 and 1994, Southall led a programme of diagnostic and treatment-based clinical work at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, and the North Staffordshire Royal Infirmary in Stoke-on-Trent involving patients with unexplained life-threatening events from a wide area of the UK. This work, involving the police and social services departments, helped protect children from life-threatening episodes of Fabricated or Induced Illness (FII) mostly involving suspected intentional suffocation of infants and young children by one of their parents, usually the mother. Techniques included the controversial covert video surveillance (CVS) in hospital of infant and child patients by police or specially trained nursing staff to observe the interactions of their parents with the children. 
Surveillance revealed abuse in 33 of 39 suspected cases, with documentation of intentional suffocation observed in 30 patients. Poisonings (with disinfectant or anticonvulsant), a deliberate fracture, and other emotional and physical abuse were also identified under surveillance. Bleeding from the nose and/or mouth was reported in 11 of the 38 patients who had had episodes of near death and were undergoing CVS but in none of 46 controls. Four patients who had been subjected to recurrent suffocation before CVS suffered permanent neurologic deficits and/or required anticonvulsant therapy for epileptic seizures resulting from hypoxic cerebral injury. 
The 39 patients undergoing CVS had 41 siblings, 12 of whom had previously died suddenly and unexpectedly. Eleven of the deaths had been classified as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) but after CVS, four parents admitted to suffocating eight of these siblings. Other signs of serious abuse were documented in the medical, social, and police records of an additional 15 of the siblings. 
The project concluded in its report in the medical journal Pediatrics that “Induced illness is a severe form of abuse that may cause death or permanent neurologic impairment. It may be accompanied by other severe forms of abuse, may result in behavioural disorders, and may be accompanied by immeasurable suffering. Detection of this abuse requires careful history-taking; thorough examination of the health, social, and police records; and close and focused collaboration between hospital and community child health professionals, child psychiatrists, social workers, and police officers. Covert video surveillance (CVS) may help investigate suspicions and ensure that children are protected from additional abuse. When parents have failed to acknowledge that they have deceived health professionals, partnership with them in seeking to protect their children may be neither safe nor effective”.

The project attracted controversy for its methods and raised ethical implications. Critics argued that the desire of the implementers of CVS to observe the carers harming the children exposed the children to further abuse, that the betrayal of doctor-patient trust necessarily involved in the surveillance could cause harm to the subjects, and that &quot;a diagnosis should lead to treatment, not punishment&quot;. However, Southall and his team argued that the surveillance saved the lives of many of the children involved, and Southall himself said that &quot;By doing covert video surveillance we are betraying the trust of parents... but if a parent has been abusing his or her child in this way then the trust between child and parent has already gone.&quot;

The concerns of a campaigning group of parents accused of abuse, a small proportion of parents involved in the ventilator study described below and their advocates, including a woman who was imprisoned subsequently for conspiracy to abduct a child, led to an investigation of Southall&#x27;s child protection work, in particular covert video surveillance, by his employer the North Staffordshire Hospital. The campaigning group called themselves MAMA (Mothers Against Munchausen syndrome by proxy Allegations). The investigation by his employing hospital cleared Southall.

In the early 1990s, Southall led a randomised controlled study which pioneered continuous negative extrathoracic pressure therapy (CNEP), a non-invasive treatment for breathing difficulties in infants and young children involving the application of negative pressure to the patients&#x27; chests. The technique was found to reduce the duration of chronic lung disease in premature newborn infants and to reduce the need for intensive care in infants with bronchiolitis, a common and dangerous chest infection. This study was criticised by the MAMA campaigning group described above, with some parents of the children involved suggesting that the treatment was linked to subsequent death or brain injury of their children. Based on these allegations, the research was also the subject of investigations by the North Staffordshire Hospital which again found no wrongdoing or harmful effects of the treatment. An independent follow-up study concluded in 2006 that there was &quot;no evidence of disadvantage, in terms of long-term disability or psychological outcomes&quot; from the use of the technique. The infants treated were all very premature babies in whom mortality and morbidity was expected, but there were no differences between study infants and control infants in this regard in the independent follow up study conducted. The long &quot;saga&quot; to discredit the researchers, perpetuated by constant media exposure, caused “widespread unpredictable damage”.

In November 2005, Southall retired from Keele University and his honorary status as professor there came to an end; they did not award him an emeritus professorship. 

==General Medical Council Investigations==
The same campaigning group (MAMA) also complained about the randomised controlled trial of CNEP to the General Medical Council (GMC) who many years later in 2008 investigated Southall and two colleagues at a fitness to practice hearing. The hearing was brought to a premature end when it was revealed that the evidence put forward by the campaigners was incorrect.

In 2004, following more complaints from the MAMA campaign and Mr Clark, Southall was found guilty of serious professional misconduct by the General Medical Council (GMC), after alleging to a police child protection officer that the husband of Sally Clark, a mother wrongly convicted of murdering two of her babies, was himself almost certainly responsible for murdering the couple&#x27;s children. The children were later found to have died from natural causes based on withheld medical evidence Southall made the claim in confidence to a child protection officer of the Staffordshire police after watching a television documentary about the case as he was concerned about the safety of the surviving child. He subsequently presented his evidence to a formally convened child protection case conference, members of which expressed their view at a GMC hearing that his input was important. Despite this a GMC panel banned Southall from child protection work for three years. The Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence challenged the decision as insufficient and argued that he should be deregistered, but a High Court of Justice decision in 2005 held that the sanction was not unduly lenient.
In the General Medical Council’s (GMC) subsequent publication: &quot;Protecting children and young people: the responsibilities of all doctors July 2012 and active 3 September 2012&quot;, there is the following statement: &quot;You must tell an appropriate agency, such as your local authority children&#x27;s services, the NSPCC or the police, promptly if you are concerned that a child or young person is at risk of, or is suffering, abuse or neglect unless it is not in their best interests to do so (see paragraphs 39 and 40). You do not need to be certain that the child or young person is at risk of significant harm to take this step. If a child or young person is at risk of, or is suffering, abuse or neglect, the possible consequences of not sharing relevant information will, in the overwhelming majority of cases, outweigh any harm that sharing your concerns with an appropriate agency might cause&quot;.

In February 2007, The Attorney-General Lord Goldsmith, following further campaigning by the MAMA group, announced that a review would be held into a number of criminal cases in which Southall had given evidence for the prosecution, following allegations that his hospital department had kept up to 4,450 separate case files containing specialist clinical data on child patients mainly referred from other hospitals and including some child protection cases. These were kept separate from the standard hospital records but with a link to them which was fully known by hospital administrators. This investigation revealed no evidence that Southall&#x27;s actions had harmed criminal investigations.

On 4 December 2007, Southall was struck off the medical register after being found guilty of professional misconduct by the General Medical Council in another child protection case. Southall appealed against this decision in the High Court, but the appeal was dismissed. In his judgment, Mr. Justice Blake stated that Southall &quot;had speculated on non-medical matters in an offensive manner entirely inconsistent with the status of an independent expert.&quot; However, this ruling was subsequently overturned by the Court of Appeal in 2010. Neither the GMC Panel nor Mr. Justice Blake understood the importance of the presence of an independent senior social worker during the interview with the mother who had brought the complaint to the GMC. The mother, who was part of the long-standing MAMA campaign against his child protection work described above, complained that Southall had accused her of murdering her son. Southall denied this. The senior social worker present and taking notes throughout the interview gave evidence that the mother’s allegation was incorrect and also denied that Southall had made the accusation.

On 1 June 2009 Southall was the subject of an episode of the BBC&#x27;s current affairs programme Panorama, &quot;A Very Dangerous Doctor&quot;. This programme raised serious concerns about the way in which his child protection work had been investigated and damaged by the GMC and other inappropriate inquiries. The interest group &#x27;Professionals Against Child Abuse&#x27; subsequently commented in the medical journal The Lancet that the &quot;GMC should never have brought this case&quot; (against Southall) and criticised disciplinary proceedings brought against other doctors involved in child protection work.

On 4 May 2010 Southall was back on the medical register after winning his action in the Court of Appeal ending a long-running dispute with the General Medical Council. The Appeal Court&#x27;s decision meant that he was able to practice medicine again.

In September 2011 the GMC dropped its last remaining case against Southall involving the issue of the special case files raised by the campaigning group MAMA and Attorney General in 2007. Southall stated that this final closure of the GMC case in September 2011 was a &quot;victory over an orchestrated and dangerous campaign which has waged war over 16 years against my work in trying to protect children from life threatening abuse&quot;. He is continued to request that the GMC apologise for its misguided approach to his work and for breaching his right to a fair trial within a reasonable time.

==Work since 2011==

In 2011 Southall gave the annual David Harvey Lecture at the UK Neonatal Update at Imperial College London.

Southall was editor of a textbook, &quot;International Maternal &amp; Child Health Care: A practical manual for hospitals worldwide&quot;, published by MCAI in 2014 and provided free of charge to frontline health workers in public hospitals in low income countries.

As of 2023, Southall continues to be a trustee of the MCAI.

==Honours and awards==
Southall received an OBE in 1999 for services to childcare in Bosnia and Hercegovina.

<text>Virginia Grey (March 22, 1917 – July 31, 2004) was an American actress who appeared in over 100 films and several radio and television shows from the 1930s to the early 1980s. She was romantically involved with Clark Gable for several years, after his wife, Carole Lombard&#x27;s untimely death. 

==Biography==
Grey was born on March 22, 1917, in Edendale, California, the youngest of three daughters of Florence Anna Grey (née Pauly; 1890—1930) and director Ray Grey. One of her early babysitters was film star Gloria Swanson. Grey debuted at 10 in the silent film &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1927) as Little Eva. She continued acting for a few more years but left acting for three years to finish her education.

Grey abandoned her training as a nurse and returned to films in the 1930s, with bit parts and work as an extra. She eventually signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and appeared in several films, including &quot;The Hardys Ride High&quot; (1939) with Mickey Rooney, &quot;Another Thin Man&quot; (1939) with William Powell, &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; (1940), and &quot;The Big Store&quot; (1941) with the Marx Brothers.

She left MGM in 1942 and worked steadily for several film studios over subsequent years. During the 1950s and 1960s, producer Ross Hunter frequently included Grey in his popular soap melodramas such as &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot;, &quot;Back Street,&quot; and &quot;Madame X&quot;.

Grey had an intermittent love affair with Clark Gable in the 1940s. After Gable&#x27;s wife Carole Lombard died and he returned from military service, Gable and Grey were often seen together at restaurants and nightclubs. Many, including Grey herself, expected Gable to marry her, and tabloids often speculated on a wedding announcement. It was a great surprise when Gable hastily married Lady Sylvia Ashley in 1949, leaving Grey heartbroken. Gable divorced Ashley in 1952, never rekindling his romance with Grey, who never married.

In 1951, Grey portrayed Blanche Bickerson on the syndicated comedy TV series &quot;The Bickersons&quot;. She was a regular on television in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing on &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;U.S. Marshal&quot;, &quot;The Jane Wyman Show&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;, &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, &quot;Red Skelton&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (“The Honorable Don Charlie Story,” &quot;The Kate Parker Story,&quot; &quot;The Major Adams Story&quot;), &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, &quot;Ironside,&quot; and many others.

Grey died on July 31, 2004, at age 87, in Woodland Hills, California while a resident at the Motion Picture Home. She was cremated, and her ashes were scattered at sea on August 6, 2004, off the Los Angeles coast.

Anna Torv portrayed her in the HBO miniseries &quot;The Pacific&quot;.

<text>The [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]] of [[Prince Edward Island]] (informally and more commonly, the Cabinet of Prince Edward Island) is the cabinet of that Canadian province.

Almost always made up of members of the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island, the Cabinet is similar in structure and role to the Cabinet of Canada while being smaller in size. As federal and provincial responsibilities differ there are a number of different portfolios between the federal and provincial governments.

The Lieutenant-Governor of Prince Edward Island, as representative of the King in Right of Prince Edward Island, heads the council, and is referred to as the Governor-in-Council. Other members of the Cabinet, who advise, or minister, the vice-regal, are selected by the Premier of Prince Edward Island and appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor. Most cabinet ministers are the head of a ministry, but this is not always the case.

==Current cabinet==
The current cabinet was formed on February 21, 2025 following the resignation of Premier Dennis King from the Executive Council.

<text>Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Standish Grey (February 19, 1890, San Diego, California - April 18, 1925, Glendale, California) was an American film director, film actor, screenwriter and the father of actress Virginia Grey.

Grey got his start as an actor in Mack Sennett&#x27;s Keystone Studios films. His acting debut was in &quot;A Movie Star&quot; (1916). In the early 1920s, he switched off between being the main director of features and being a second unit or assistant director; such as with the film &quot;Molly O&#x27;&quot; (1921), Flickering Youth (1924), and Salome and Shenandoah.

Primary directed such films as &quot;Among Those Present&quot; (1919), &quot;Andy Takes a Flyer&quot; (1925), and &quot;Between Meals&quot; (1926). The last film was released after Grey&#x27;s early death at age 35 from pneumonia. Grey is buried at Forest Lawn in Glendale, California.
